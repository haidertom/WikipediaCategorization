Its seat is located in the city of [[Helsingborg]], which is Sweden's eighth largest city. The municipality had a population of 132,011 on January 1, 2013, and the population is increasing with roughly 1500 people annually.\n\nBetween 1912 and 1971 the name of the town was officially spelled '''H\u00e4lsingborg''' (rather like the region of [[H\u00e4lsingland]] but unlike neighbouring Danish [[Helsing\u00f8r]] and the Finnish capital Helsingfors ([[Helsinki]])). The spelling was changed back to the older version when the present municipality was created in 1971 through the amalgamation of the ''Town of H\u00e4lsingborg'' with four surrounding rural municipalities. Since the 1990s the municipality again styles itself ''Helsingborgs stad'' (''Town of Helsingborg''). This usage is only nominal and has no effect on the status of the municipality.\n\n==Localities==\nThere are 15 [[Urban areas in Sweden|urban area]]s (also called a T\u00e4tort or locality) in Helsingborg Municipality.

In doing so, Ford converted the automobile from an expensive curiosity into a practical conveyance that would profoundly impact the landscape of the 20th century. His introduction of the [[Ford Model T|Model T]] automobile revolutionized transportation and American [[industry]]. As the owner of the Ford Motor Company, he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. He is credited with \"[[Fordism]]\": mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers. Ford had a global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace. His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a [[Franchising|franchise]] system that put dealerships throughout most of North America and in major cities on six continents. Ford left most of his vast wealth to the [[Ford Foundation]] and arranged for his family to control the company permanently.\n\nFord was also widely known for his [[pacifism]] during the first years of [[World War I]], and for promoting [[antisemitic]] content, including ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' through his newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' and the book ''[[The International Jew]]'', having an influence on the development of [[Nazism]] and [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\n==Early life==\nHenry Ford was born July 30, 1863, on a farm in [[Greenfield Township, Michigan]].<ref>[http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/default.asp www.hfmgv.org The Henry Ford Museum: ''The Life of Henry Ford''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024223215/http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/default.asp |date=October 24, 2008 }}</ref> His father, [[William Ford (businessman)|William Ford]] (1826\u20131905), was born in [[County Cork]], Ireland, to a family that was originally from [[Somerset]], England.<ref>{{cite web|title=The history of Ford in Ireland Family Crest and Name History|url=http://www.ford.ie/AboutFord/CompanyInformation/HistoryOfFord}}</ref> His mother, Mary Ford (n\u00e9e Litogot; 1839\u20131876), was born in Michigan as the youngest child of Belgian immigrants; her parents died when she was a child and she was adopted by neighbors, the O'Herns. Henry Ford's siblings were Margaret Ford (1867\u20131938); Jane Ford (c. 1868\u20131945); William Ford (1871\u20131917) and Robert Ford (1873\u20131934).\n\nHis father gave him a pocket watch in his early teens. At 15, Ford dismantled and reassembled the timepieces of friends and neighbors dozens of times, gaining the reputation of a watch repairman.<ref>Ford, ''My Life and Work'', 22\u201324; Nevins and Hill, ''Ford TMC'', 58.</ref> At twenty, Ford walked four miles to their [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church every Sunday.<ref>Evans, Harold \"They Made America\" Little, Brown and Company.

Flower & Bros., and later with the [[Detroit Dry Dock]] Co. In 1882, he returned to Dearborn to work on the family farm, where he became adept at operating the [[Westinghouse Farm Engine|Westinghouse portable steam engine]]. He was later hired by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] to service their steam engines. During this period Ford also studied bookkeeping at [[Goldsmith, Bryant & Stratton Business College]] in Detroit.<ref>{{cite book |first=Steven |last=Watts |title=The People's Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century |publisher=Random House, Inc. |year=2006 |page=28 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LIDyU91YMHAC&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage and family==\n[[File:Henry Ford 1888.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Henry Ford in 1888<br />\n(aged 25)]]\nFord married Clara Jane Bryant (1866\u20131950) on April 11, 1888, and supported himself by farming and running a sawmill.<ref>{{cite news|title=Widow of Automobile Pioneer, Victim of Coronary Occlusion, Survived Him Three Years|quote=Friday, Sept. 29 (Associated Press) Mrs. Clara Bryant Ford, 84&nbsp;year-old widow of Henry Ford, died at 2 A.

After his promotion to Chief Engineer in 1893, he had enough time and money to devote attention to his personal experiments on gasoline engines. These experiments culminated in 1896 with the completion of a self-propelled vehicle which he named the [[Ford Quadricycle]]. He test-drove it on June 4. After various test drives, Ford brainstormed ways to improve the Quadricycle.<ref>[http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/showroom/1896/quad.html The Showroom of Automotive History: 1896 Quadricycle<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615125140/http://hfmgv.org/exhibits/showroom/1896/quad.html |date=June 15, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1896, Ford attended a meeting of Edison executives, where he was introduced to [[Thomas Edison]]. Edison approved of Ford's automobile experimentation. Encouraged by Edison, Ford designed and built a second vehicle, completing it in 1898.<ref name=birth>Ford R.

Murphy, Ford resigned from the Edison Company and founded the [[Detroit Automobile Company]] on August 5, 1899.<ref name=birth/> However, the automobiles produced were of a lower quality and higher price than Ford wanted. Ultimately, the company was not successful and was dissolved in January 1901.<ref name=birth/>\n\nWith the help of [[C. Harold Wills]], Ford designed, built, and successfully raced a 26-horsepower automobile in October 1901. With this success, Murphy and other stockholders in the Detroit Automobile Company formed the [[Henry Ford Company]] on November 30, 1901, with Ford as chief engineer.<ref name=birth/> In 1902, Murphy brought in [[Henry M. Leland]] as a consultant; Ford, in response, left the company bearing his name. With Ford gone, Murphy renamed the company the [[Cadillac Automobile Company]].<ref name=birth/>\n\nTeaming up with former racing cyclist [[Tom Cooper (driver)|Tom Cooper]], Ford also produced the 80+ horsepower racer \"999\" which [[Barney Oldfield]] was to drive to victory in a race in October 1902. Ford received the backing of an old acquaintance, [[Alexander Y. Malcomson]], a Detroit-area coal dealer.<ref name=birth/> They formed a partnership, \"Ford & Malcomson, Ltd.\" to manufacture automobiles. Ford went to work designing an inexpensive automobile, and the duo leased a factory and contracted with a machine shop owned by [[John F. Dodge|John]] and [[Horace E. Dodge]] to supply over $160,000 in parts.<ref name=birth/> Sales were slow, and a crisis arose when the Dodge brothers demanded payment for their first shipment.\n\n===Ford Motor Company===\n[[File:Ford Edison Firestone1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Henry Ford with [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Harvey Firestone]]. [[Fort Myers, Florida]], February 11, 1929.]]\n\nIn response, Malcomson brought in another group of investors and convinced the Dodge Brothers to accept a portion of the new company.<ref name=birth/> Ford & Malcomson was reincorporated as the [[Ford Motor Company]] on June 16, 1903,<ref name=birth/> with $28,000 capital. The original investors included Ford and Malcomson, the Dodge brothers, Malcomson's uncle [[John S. Gray (Michigan)|John S. Gray]], Malcolmson's secretary [[James Couzens]], and two of Malcomson's lawyers, John W. Anderson and [[Horace Rackham]]. Ford then demonstrated a newly designed car on the ice of [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]], driving {{convert|1|mi|km}} in 39.4 seconds and setting a new [[land speed record]] at {{convert|91.3|mph|km/h|abbr=off}}. Convinced by this success, the race driver [[Barney Oldfield]], who named this new Ford model \"[[Ford 999|999]]\" in honor of the fastest locomotive of the day, took the car around the country, making the Ford brand known throughout the United States. Ford also was one of the early backers of the [[Indianapolis 500]].\n\n====Model T====\nThe [[Model T]] was introduced on October 1, 1908. It had the steering wheel on the left, which every other company soon copied. The entire engine and transmission were enclosed; the four cylinders were cast in a solid block; the suspension used two semi-elliptic springs. The car was very simple to drive, and easy and cheap to repair. It was so cheap at $825 in 1908 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|825|1908|r=-1}}}} today) (the price fell every year) that by the 1920s, a majority of American drivers had learned to drive on the Model T.<ref>Richard Bak, ''Henry and Edsel: The Creation of the Ford Empire'' (2003) pp 54\u201363</ref>\n\nFord created a huge publicity machine in Detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about the new product. Ford's network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in almost every city in North America. As independent dealers, the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the Ford but the concept of automobiling; local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to encourage exploring the countryside. Ford was always eager to sell to farmers, who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business. Sales skyrocketed\u2014several years posted 100% gains on the previous year. Always on the hunt for more efficiency and lower costs, in 1913 Ford introduced the moving assembly belts into his plants, which enabled an enormous increase in production. Although Ford is often credited with the idea, contemporary sources indicate that the concept and its development came from employees [[Clarence Avery]], [[Peter E. Martin]], [[Charles E. Sorensen]], and [[C. Harold Wills]].<ref>Nevins (1954) 1:387\u2013415</ref> (See [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]])\n\n[[File:Ford assembly line - 1913.jpg|left|thumb|Ford assembly line, 1913]]\n\nSales passed 250,000 in 1914. By 1916, as the price dropped to $360 for the basic touring car, sales reached 472,000.<ref>Lewis 1976, pp 41\u201359</ref> (Using the consumer price index, this price was equivalent to $7,828.08 in 2015 dollars.)\n[[File:1924-1925 Ford - T Roadster, Coimbatore (1).jpg|thumb|A 1926 Ford T Roadster on display in India]]\nBy 1918, half of all cars in America were Model Ts. All new cars were black; as Ford wrote in his autobiography, \"Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black\".<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_p72\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA72#v=onepage&f=false p. 72].</ref> Until the development of the assembly line, which mandated black because of its quicker drying time, Model Ts were available in other colors, including red. The design was fervently promoted and defended by Ford, and production continued as late as 1927; the final total production was 15,007,034. This record stood for the next 45 years. This record was achieved in 19 years from the introduction of the first Model T (1908).\n\nPresident [[Woodrow Wilson]] asked Ford to run as a Democrat for the [[United States Senate]] from Michigan in 1918. Although the nation was at war, Ford ran as a peace candidate and a strong supporter of the proposed [[League of Nations]].<ref>Watts, pp 243\u201348</ref> Ford was defeated in a close election by the Republican candidate, [[Truman Newberry]], a former [[United States Secretary of the Navy]].\n\nHenry Ford turned the presidency of Ford Motor Company over to his son Edsel Ford in December 1918. Henry retained final decision authority and sometimes reversed the decisions of his son. Ford started another company, Henry Ford and Son, and made a show of taking himself and his best employees to the new company; the goal was to scare the remaining holdout stockholders of the Ford Motor Company to sell their stakes to him before they lost most of their value. (He was determined to have full control over strategic decisions.) The ruse worked, and Ford and Edsel purchased all remaining stock from the other investors, thus giving the family sole ownership of the company.<ref>Nevins and Hill (1957) vol 2</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1920s, sales of the Model T began to decline due to rising competition. Other auto makers offered payment plans through which consumers could buy their cars, which usually included more modern mechanical features and styling not available with the Model T. Despite urgings from Edsel, Henry refused to incorporate new features into the Model T or to form a customer credit plan.<ref>Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:409-36</ref>\n\n====Model A and Ford's later career====\nBy 1926, flagging sales of the Model T finally convinced Ford to make a new model. He pursued the project with a great deal of technical expertise in design of the engine, chassis, and other mechanical necessities, while leaving the body design to his son. Edsel also managed to prevail over his father's initial objections in the inclusion of a sliding-shift transmission.<ref name=\"Sorensen1956p223\">{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=223}}.</ref>\n\nThe result was the successful [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model A]], introduced in December 1927 and produced through 1931, with a total output of more than 4&nbsp;million. Subsequently, the Ford company adopted an annual model change system similar to that recently pioneered by its competitor General Motors (and still in use by automakers today). Not until the 1930s did Ford overcome his objection to finance companies, and the Ford-owned [[Universal Credit Corporation]] became a major car-financing operation.<ref>Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:459-78</ref>\n\nFord did not believe in accountants; he amassed one of the world's largest fortunes without ever having his company [[audit]]ed under his administration.\n\n====Labor philosophy====\n\n=====The five-dollar wage=====\n[[File:Timehenryford.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, January 14, 1935]]\nFord was a pioneer of \"[[welfare capitalism]]\", designed to improve the lot of his workers and especially to reduce the heavy [[turnover (employment)|turnover]] that had many departments hiring 300 men per year to fill 100 slots. Efficiency meant hiring and keeping the best workers.<ref>Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:508-40</ref>\n\nFord astonished the world in 1914 by offering a $5 per day wage (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1914|r=-1}}}} today), which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers.<ref>Using the [[consumer price index]], this was equivalent to $111.10 per day in 2008 dollars.</ref> A [[Cleveland, Ohio]], newspaper editorialized that the announcement \"shot like a blinding rocket through the dark clouds of the present industrial depression.\"<ref>Lewis, ''Public Image'' p 71</ref> The move proved extremely profitable; instead of constant turnover of employees, the best mechanics in Detroit flocked to Ford, bringing their human capital and expertise, raising productivity, and lowering training costs.<ref>Nevins, ''Ford'' 1:528-41</ref><ref>Watts, ''People's Tycoon,'' pp. 178\u201394</ref> Ford announced his $5-per-day program on January 5, 1914, raising the minimum daily pay from $2.34 to $5 for qualifying male workers.\n\nDetroit was already a high-wage city, but competitors were forced to raise wages or lose their best workers.<ref>Watts, ''People's Tycoon,'' pp. 193\u201394</ref> Ford's policy proved, however, that paying people more would enable Ford workers to afford the cars they were producing and be good for the local economy. He viewed the increased wages as profit-sharing linked with rewarding those who were most productive and of good character.<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_pp126-130\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA126#v=onepage&f=false pp. 126\u2013130].</ref> It may have been [[James Couzens|Couzens]] who convinced Ford to adopt the $5-day wage.<ref>Lewis, ''Public Image,'' 69\u201370</ref>\n\nReal profit-sharing was offered to employees who had worked at the company for six months or more, and, importantly, conducted their lives in a manner of which Ford's \"Social Department\" approved. They frowned on heavy drinking, gambling, and (what today are called) [[deadbeat parent|deadbeat dads]]. The Social Department used 50 investigators, plus support staff, to maintain employee standards; a large percentage of workers were able to qualify for this \"profit-sharing.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nFord's incursion into his employees' private lives was highly controversial, and he soon backed off from the most intrusive aspects. By the time he wrote his 1922 memoir, he spoke of the Social Department and of the private conditions for profit-sharing in the past tense, and admitted that \"paternalism has no place in industry. Welfare work that consists in prying into employees' private concerns is out of date. Men need counsel and men need help, often special help; and all this ought to be rendered for decency's sake. But the broad workable plan of investment and participation will do more to solidify industry and strengthen organization than will any social work on the outside.

On May 1, 1926, the Ford Motor Company's factory workers switched to a five-day 40-hour workweek, with the company's office workers making the transition the following August.<ref name=history>http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ford-factory-workers-get-40-hour-week/print</ref>\n\nFord had made the decision to boost productivity, as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time, and because he believed decent leisure time was good for business, since workers would actually have more time to purchase and consume more goods. However, altruistic concerns also played a role, with Ford explaining \"It is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either 'lost time' or a class privilege.\"<ref name=history/>\n\n=====Labor unions=====\nFord was adamantly against [[trade union|labor unions]]. He explained his views on unions in Chapter 18 of ''My Life and Work''.<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_pp253-266\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA253#v=onepage&f=false pp. 253\u2013266].</ref> He thought they were too heavily influenced by some leaders who, despite their ostensible good motives, would end up doing more harm than good for workers. {{Anchor|No_prosperity_without_productivity}} Most wanted to restrict productivity as a means to foster employment, but Ford saw this as self-defeating because, in his view, productivity was necessary for any economic prosperity to exist.\n\nHe believed that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere, whether within the same corporation or in others. Ford also believed that union leaders had a [[perverse incentive]] to foment perpetual socio-economic crisis as a way to maintain their own power. Meanwhile, he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers, because doing so would maximize their own profits. Ford did acknowledge, however, that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact. But Ford believed that eventually, if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right (i.e., both socialists and bad-manager reactionaries), the good managers would create a socio-economic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing.\n\nTo forestall union activity, Ford promoted [[Harry Bennett]], a former [[United States Navy|Navy]] boxer, to head the Service Department. Bennett employed various intimidation tactics to squash union organizing.<ref>Harris, J: ''Henry Ford'', pages 91\u201392. Moffa Press, 1984.</ref> The most famous incident, on May 26, 1937, involved Bennett's security men beating with clubs members of the [[United Automobile Workers]], including [[Walter Reuther]].<ref name=\"Wallace\">Wallace, Max. (2003). ''The American axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh, and the rise of the Third Reich''. New York: St. Martin's Press.</ref> While Bennett's men were beating the UAW representatives, the supervising police chief on the scene was Carl Brooks, an alumnus of Bennett's Service Department, and [Brooks] \"did not give orders to intervene.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Wallace|2003|p=311}}</ref> The following day photographs of the injured UAW members appeared in newspapers, later becoming known as [[The Battle of the Overpass]].\n\nIn the late 1930s and early 1940s, Edsel\u2014who was president of the company\u2014thought Ford had to come to some sort of [[collective bargaining]] agreement with the unions because the violence, work disruptions, and bitter stalemates could not go on forever. But Ford, who still had the final veto in the company on a ''de facto'' basis even if not an official one, refused to cooperate. For several years, he kept Bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company. Sorensen's memoir<ref name=\"Sorensen1956p261\">{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=261}}.</ref> makes clear that Ford's purpose in putting Bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached.\n\nThe Ford Motor Company was the last Detroit automaker to recognize the UAW. A sit-down strike by the UAW union in April 1941 closed the [[River Rouge Plant]]. Sorensen recounted<ref name=\"Sorensen1956pp266-272\">{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=266\u2013272}}.</ref> that a distraught Henry Ford was very close to following through with a threat to break up the company rather than cooperate, but his wife Clara told him she would leave him if he destroyed the family business. In her view, it would not be worth the chaos it would create. Ford complied with his wife's ultimatum, and even agreed with her in retrospect. Overnight, the Ford Motor Company went from the most stubborn holdout among automakers to the one with the most favorable UAW contract terms. The contract was signed in June 1941.<ref name=\"Sorensen1956pp266-272\"/> About a year later, Ford told Walter Reuther, \"It was one of the most sensible things Harry Bennett ever did when he got the UAW into this plant.\" Reuther inquired, \"What do you mean?\" Ford replied, \"Well, you've been fighting General Motors and the Wall Street crowd. Now you're in here and we've given you a union shop and more than you got out of them. That puts you on our side, doesn't it? We can fight General Motors and Wall Street together, eh?\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57172289|title=Putting the world together : my father Walter Reuther, the liberal warrior|last=Reuther.|first=Dickmeyer, Elisabeth|date=2004|publisher=LivingForce Pub|year=|isbn=9780975379219|location=Lake Orion, Mich.|page=63|oclc=57172289}}</ref>\n\n===Ford Airplane Company===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nFord, like other automobile companies, entered the aviation business during [[World War I]], building Liberty engines. After the war, it returned to auto manufacturing until 1925, when Ford acquired the [[Stout Metal Airplane Division of the Ford Motor Company|Stout Metal Airplane Company]].\n\n[[File:Ford 4ATF.jpg|thumb|left|Ford 4-AT-F (EC-RRA) of the Spanish Republican Airline, [[L.A.P.E.]]]]\nFord's most successful aircraft was the [[Ford Trimotor|Ford 4AT Trimotor]], often called the \"Tin Goose\" because of its corrugated metal construction. It used a new alloy called [[Alclad]] that combined the corrosion resistance of aluminum with the strength of [[duralumin]]. The plane was similar to [[Fokker]]'s V.VII-3m, and some say that Ford's engineers surreptitiously measured the Fokker plane and then copied it. The Trimotor first flew on June 11, 1926, and was the first successful U.S. passenger airliner, accommodating about 12 passengers in a rather uncomfortable fashion. Several variants were also used by the [[U.S. Army]]. Ford has been honored by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for changing the aviation industry. 199 Trimotors were built before it was discontinued in 1933, when the Ford Airplane Division shut down because of poor sales during the [[Great Depression]].\n\n====Willow Run====\n{{Main|Willow Run}}{{clear}}\n\n===Peace and war===\n\n====World War I era====\nFord opposed war, which he viewed as a terrible waste,<ref name=\"Ford-Bio-A&E\">Henry Ford, Biography (March 25, 1999).

In 1915, the pacifist [[Rosika Schwimmer]] gained favor with Ford, who agreed to fund a [[Peace Ship]] to Europe, where World War I was raging. He and about 170 other prominent peace leaders traveled there. Ford's Episcopalian pastor, Reverend Samuel S. Marquis, accompanied him on the mission. Marquis headed Ford's Sociology Department from 1913 to 1921. Ford talked to President Wilson about the mission but had no government support. His group went to neutral Sweden and the Netherlands to meet with peace activists. A target of much ridicule, Ford left the ship as soon as it reached Sweden.<ref>{{cite book|author=Watts|title=''The People's Tycoon''|year=2005|pages=225\u2013249}}</ref>\n\nFord plants in the United Kingdom produced tractors to increase the British food supply, as well as trucks and aircraft engines.

Wilson believed that Ford could tip the scales in Congress in favor of Wilson's proposed [[League of Nations|League]]. \"You are the only man in Michigan who can be elected and help bring about the peace you so desire,\" the president wrote Ford.

His [[Ford River Rouge Complex|River Rouge Plant]] became the world's largest industrial complex, pursuing [[vertical integration]] to such an extent that it could produce its own steel. Ford's goal was to produce a vehicle from scratch without reliance on foreign trade. He believed in the global expansion of his company. He believed that international trade and cooperation led to international peace, and he used the assembly line process and production of the Model T to demonstrate it.<ref>Watts 236\u201340</ref>\n\nHe opened Ford assembly plants in Britain and Canada in 1911, and soon became the biggest automotive producer in those countries. In 1912, Ford cooperated with [[Giovanni Agnelli]] of [[Fiat]] to launch the first Italian automotive assembly plants. The first plants in Germany were built in the 1920s with the encouragement of [[Herbert Hoover]] and the Commerce Department, which agreed with Ford's theory that international trade was essential to world peace.<ref>Wilkins</ref> In the 1920s, Ford also opened plants in Australia, India, and France, and by 1929, he had successful dealerships on six continents.

They saw the size, tempo, standardization, and philosophy of production demonstrated at the Ford Works as a national service\u2014an \"American thing\" that represented the [[culture of the United States]]. Both supporters and critics insisted that Fordism epitomized American capitalist development, and that the auto industry was the key to understanding economic and social relations in the United States.

It is difficult to remember what life was like before Mr. Ford began preaching his doctrine of salvation\".<ref>Nolan, p. 31.</ref> For many Germans, Ford embodied the essence of successful Americanism.\n\nIn ''My Life and Work'', Ford predicted that if greed, racism, and short-sightedness could be overcome, then economic and technological development throughout the world would progress to the point that international trade would no longer be based on (what today would be called) colonial or [[neocolonialism|neocolonial]] models and would truly benefit all peoples.<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_pp242-244\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA242#v=onepage&f=false pp. 242\u2013244].</ref> His ideas in this passage were vague, but they were idealistic.\n\n==Racing==\n[[File:Henry Ford and Barney Oldfield with Old 999, 1902.jpg|thumb|Ford (standing) launched [[Barney Oldfield]]'s career in 1902]]\n\nFord maintained an interest in auto racing from 1901 to 1913 and began his involvement in the sport as both a builder and a driver, later turning the wheel over to hired drivers. He entered stripped-down [[Model T]]s in races, finishing first (although later disqualified) in an \"ocean-to-ocean\" (across the United States) race in 1909, and setting a one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) oval speed record at Detroit Fairgrounds in 1911 with driver Frank Kulick. In 1913, Ford attempted to enter a reworked Model T in the [[Indianapolis 500]] but was told rules required the addition of another {{convert|1,000|lb|kg}} to the car before it could qualify. Ford dropped out of the race and soon thereafter dropped out of racing permanently, citing dissatisfaction with the sport's rules, demands on his time by the booming production of the Model Ts, and his low opinion of racing as a worthwhile activity.\n\nIn ''My Life and Work'' Ford speaks (briefly) of racing in a rather dismissive tone, as something that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general. He describes himself as someone who raced only because in the 1890s through 1910s, one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing was the way to prove the worth of an automobile. Ford did not agree. But he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success (flawed though the definition was), then his cars would be the best that there were at racing.<ref name=\"Ford_Crowther_1922_p50\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&pg=PA50#v=onepage&f=false p. 50].</ref> Throughout the book, he continually returns to ideals such as transportation, production efficiency, affordability, reliability, fuel efficiency, economic prosperity, and the automation of drudgery in farming and industry, but rarely mentions, and rather belittles, the idea of merely going fast from point A to point B.\n\nNevertheless, Ford did make quite an impact on auto racing during his racing years, and he was inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 1996.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9KOHEPbBBbIC&pg=PA33&dq=henry+ford+Motorsports+Hall+of+Fame+of+America+in+1996&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQtI2O5JjYAhUDzRQKHe_nBeEQ6AEIJDAA#v=snippet&q=Hall%20of%20fame%20henry%20ford&f=false|title=The Intellectual Devotional Modern Culture: Revive Your Mind, Complete Your Education, and Converse Confidently with the Culturati|last=Kidder|first=David S.|last2=Oppenheim|first2=Noah D.|date=October 14, 2008|publisher=Rodale|year=|isbn=9781605297934|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Later career and death==\nWhen Edsel Ford, President of Ford Motor Company, died of cancer in May 1943, the elderly and ailing Henry Ford decided to assume the presidency.

geography, the latter concentrating upon the study of human activities, by the application of [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[quantitative research]] methods.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of geography}}\n{{History of geography sidebar}}\nGeography was not recognized as a formal academic discipline until the 18th century, although many scholars had undertaken geographical scholarship for much longer, particularly through [[cartography]].\n\nThe [[Royal Geographical Society]] was founded in [[England]] in 1830,<ref>{{cite web|last=Royal Geographical Society|title=History|url=http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/History.htm|accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref> although the United Kingdom did not get its first full Chair of geography until 1917. The first real geographical intellect to emerge in [[United Kingdom]]'s geographical minds was [[Halford John Mackinder]], appointed reader at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in 1887.\n\nThe [[National Geographic Society]] was founded in the United States in 1888 and began publication of the ''National Geographic'' magazine which became, and continues to be, a great popularizer of geographic information. The society has long supported geographic research and education on geographical topics.\n\nThe Association of American Geographers was founded in 1904 and was renamed the [[American Association of Geographers]] in 2016 to better reflect the increasingly international character of its membership.\n\nOne of the first examples of geographic methods being used for purposes other than to describe and theorize the physical properties of the earth is [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s map of the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. Though Snow was primarily a [[physician]] and a pioneer of [[epidemiology]] rather than a geographer, his map is probably one of the earliest examples of [[health geography]].\n\nThe now fairly distinct differences between the subfields of physical and human geography have developed at a later date. This connection between both physical and human properties of geography is most apparent in the theory of [[environmental determinism]], made popular in the 19th century by [[Carl Ritter]] and others, and has close links to the field of [[evolutionary biology]] of the time. Environmental determinism is the theory, that people's physical, mental and moral habits are directly due to the influence of their natural environment. However, by the mid-19th century, environmental determinism was under attack for lacking methodological rigor associated with modern science, and later as a means to justify [[racism]] and [[imperialism]].\n\nA similar concern with both human and physical aspects is apparent during the later 19th and first half of the 20th centuries focused on [[regional geography]].The goal of regional geography, through something known as [[regionalisation]], was to delineate space into regions and then understand and describe the unique characteristics of each region through both human and physical aspects. With links to (possibilism) (geography) and [[cultural ecology]] some of the same notions of causal effect of the environment on society and culture remain with environmental determinism.\n\nBy the 1960s, however, the [[quantitative revolution]] led to strong criticism of regional geography. Due to a perceived lack of scientific rigor in an overly descriptive nature of the discipline, and a continued separation of geography from its two subfields of physical and human geography and from [[geology]], geographers in the mid-20th century began to apply statistical and mathematical models in order to solve spatial problems.<ref name=\"HGDICT\"/> Much of the development during the quantitative revolution is now apparent in the use of [[geographic information systems]]; the use of statistics, spatial modeling, and positivist approaches are still important to many branches of human geography. Well-known geographers from this period are [[Fred K. Schaefer]], [[Waldo Tobler]], [[William Garrison (geographer)|William Garrison]], [[Peter Haggett]], [[Richard Chorley|Richard J. Chorley]], [[William Bunge]], and [[Torsten H\u00e4gerstrand]].\n\nFrom the 1970s, a number of critiques of the positivism now associated with geography emerged. Known under the term '[[critical geography]],' these critiques signaled another turning point in the discipline. [[Behavioural geography|Behavioral geography]] emerged for some time as a means to understand how people made perceived spaces and places, and made locational decisions. The more influential 'radical geography' emerged in the 1970s and 1980s. It draws heavily on [[Marxist geography|Marxist]]'s theory and techniques, and is associated with geographers such as [[David Harvey]] and [[Richard Peet]]. Radical geographers seek to say meaningful things about problems recognized through quantitative methods,<ref>{{Cite book | author=Harvey, David| authorlink=David Harvey| title=Social Justice and the City| year=1973 | publisher=Edward Arnold | location=London | pages=128\u20139}}</ref> provide explanations rather than descriptions, put forward alternatives and solutions, and be politically engaged,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0066-4812&site=1 | title=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography: Celebrating Over 40 years of Radical Geography 1969-2009 | author=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography | year=2009 | accessdate=31 May 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010193949/http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0066-4812&site=1 | archivedate=10 October 2009 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> rather than using the detachment associated with positivists. (The detachment and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of the quantitative revolution was itself critiqued by radical geographers as being a tool of capital). Radical geography and the links to Marxism and related theories remain an important part of contemporary human geography (See: ''[[Antipode (journal)|Antipode]]''). Critical geography also saw the introduction of 'humanistic geography', associated with the work of [[Yi-Fu Tuan]], which pushed for a much more [[qualitative data|qualitative]] approach in methodology.\n\nThe changes under critical geography have led to contemporary approaches in the discipline such as [[feminist geography]], [[Cultural geography#\"New cultural geography\"|new cultural geography]], \"demonic\" geographies<ref>Simandan, D., 2017. Demonic geographies. Area. 49(4), pp. 503-509. https://doi.org/10.1111/area.12339</ref>, and the engagement with [[postmodern]] and [[post-structural]] theories and philosophies.\n\n==Fields==\nThe primary fields of study in human geography focus around the core fields of:\n\n===Culture===\n[[Cultural geography]] is the study of cultural products and norms - their variation across spaces and places, as well as their relations. It focuses on describing and analyzing the ways language, religion, economy, government, and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Jordan-Bychkov, Terry G. |author2=Domosh, Mona |author3=Rowntree, Lester | title=The human mosaic: a thematic introduction to cultural geography | year=1994 | publisher=HarperCollinsCollegePublishers | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-06-500731-2 | pages=}}</ref> \n[[File:Agriculture_in_Asia.jpg|thumb|This picture shows terraced rice agriculture in Asia.]]\n\n* Subfields include: [[Social geography]], [[Animal geographies]], [[Language geography]], [[Sexuality and space]], [[Children's geographies]], and [[Religion and geography]].\n\n===Development===\n[[Development geography]] is the study of the Earth's geography with reference to the [[standard of living]] and the [[quality of life]] of its human inhabitants, study of the location, distribution and spatial organization of economic activities, across the Earth. The subject matter investigated is strongly influenced by the researcher's methodological approach.\n\n===Economic===\n[[File:Shan Street Bazaar.JPG|thumb|Economic Geography: Shan Street bazaar, market in Myanmar]]\n[[Economic geography]] examines relationships between human economic systems, states, and other factors, and the biophysical environment.\n* Subfields include: [[Marketing geography]] and [[Transportation geography]]\n\n===Health===\n\n[[Health geography]] is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]]. Health geography deals with the spatial relations and patterns between people and the environment. This is a sub-discipline of human geography, researching how and why diseases are spread.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dummer|first=Trevor J.B.|date=2008-04-22|title=Health geography: supporting public health policy and planning|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=178|issue=9|pages=1177\u20131180|doi=10.1503/cmaj.071783|issn=0820-3946|pmc=2292766|pmid=18427094}}</ref>\n\n===Historical===\n[[Historical geography]] is the study of the human, physical, fictional, theoretical, and \"real\" geographies of the past. Historical geography studies a wide variety of issues and topics. A common theme is the study of the geographies of the past and how a place or region changes through time. Many historical geographers study geographical patterns through time, including how people have interacted with their environment, and created the cultural landscape.\n\n===Political===\n[[Political geography]] is concerned with the study of both the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures.\n* Subfields include: [[Electoral geography]], [[Geopolitics]], [[Strategic geography]] and [[Military geography]]\n\n===Population===\n[[Population geography]] is the study of ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to their environment or location.\n\n===Settlement===\n[[Settlement geography]], including [[urban geography]], is the study of [[urban area|urban]] and [[rural area]]s with specific regards to spatial, relational and theoretical aspects of settlement.  That is the study of areas which have a concentration of [[building]]s and [[infrastructure]].  These are areas where the majority of [[economy|economic]] activities are in the [[secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] and [[tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sectors]]. In case of urban settlement, they probably have a high [[population density]].\n{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Urban ===\n[[Urban geography]] is the study of cities, towns, and other areas of relatively dense settlement. Two main interests are site (how a settlement is positioned relative to the physical environment) and situation (how a settlement is positioned relative to other settlements). Another area of interest is the internal organization of urban areas with regard to different demographic groups and the layout of infrastructure. This subdiscipline also draws on ideas from other branches of Human Geography to see their involvement in the processes and patterns evident in an [[urban area]].<ref name=\"Palm\">{{Cite journal|last=Palm|first=Risa|date=2016-09-05|title=Urban geography: city structures|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/030913258200600104|journal=Progress in Geography|language=en|doi=10.1177/030913258200600104}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |author1=Kaplan, Dave H. |author2=Holloway, Steven |author3=Wheeler, James O. |title=Urban Geography, 3rd.

Fearing possible foreign intervention, President Woodrow Wilson sent U.S. Marines into Haiti in December 1914, just after the outbreak of World War I. They removed $500,000 from the Haitian National Bank, but rather than seize it to help pay the debt, it was removed for safe-keeping in New York, thus giving the United States control of the bank and preventing other powers from doing so. This gave a stable financial base on which to build the economy, and so enable the debt to be repaid.<ref>Office of the Historian, U.S. Government.

The Haitian president had been dragged from the French legation and killed in the street by local insurgents after he had ordered 167 political prisoners killed. The {{USS|Washington|ACR-11|6}}, under Rear Admiral [[William Banks Caperton|Caperton]], arrived in Port-au-Prince in an attempt to restore order and protect U.S. interests. This began a nearly 20-year occupation by U.S. forces. Within days, the Marines had taken control of the capital city and its banks and customs house, which controlled all the finances of the island nation. The Marines declared martial law and severely censored the press. Within weeks, a new pro-U.S. Haitian president, [[Philippe Sudr\u00e9 Dartiguenave]], was installed and a new constitution written that was favorable to the interests of the United States.  The new constitution included a clause that allowed, for the first time, foreign ownership of land in Haiti, which was bitterly opposed by the Haitian legislature and citizenry.\n\nThe occupation greatly improved some of Haiti's [[infrastructure]] and centralized power in Port-au-Prince. Infrastructure improvements were particularly impressive: 1700&nbsp;km of roads were made usable, 189 bridges were built, many irrigation canals were rehabilitated, hospitals, schools, and public buildings were constructed, and drinking water was brought to the main cities. Port-au-Prince became the first Caribbean city to have a phone service with automatic dialing. Agricultural education was organized, with a central school of agriculture and 69 farms in the country.{{sfn|Heinl|1996|pp=454\u2013455}} The roads were built using the Hatian\u2019s own corvee system that allowed the government/occupying forces to take people from their homes and farms, at gunpoint if necessary, to build roads, bridges, etc.<ref>Danticat, Edwidge (28 July 2015), ''New Yorker Magazine''.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Marines were instilled with a special brand of paternalism towards Haitians.

The northern highway, Route Nationale No. 1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince, winding through the coastal towns of [[Montrouis]] and [[Gona\u00efves]], before reaching its terminus at the northern port [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]].

The port's facilities include [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s, large [[Berth (moorings)|berth]]s, and [[warehouse]]s, but these facilities are not in good condition. The port is underused, possibly due to the substantially high port fees. The port of [[Saint-Marc]] is currently the preferred port of entry for consumer goods coming into Haiti. Reasons for this may include its location away from volatile and [[Traffic congestion|congested]] Port-au-Prince, as well as its central location relative to numerous Haitian cities.\n\nDuring the 2010 earthquake, the Port-au-Prince port suffered widespread damage, impeding aid to the victims. The main pier caved in and fell into the water. One of the main cranes also collapsed in the water. Port access roads were severely damaged as well.\n\nIn the past, Haiti used rail transport, however the rail infrastructure was poorly maintained when in use and cost of rehabilitation is beyond the means of the Haitian economy.\n\n===Airports===\n[[File:Toussaint Louverture International Airport.jpg|thumb|Toussaint L'Ouverture International Airport]]\n{{Main|List of airports in Haiti}}\n\n[[Toussaint Louverture International Airport]], located {{convert|10|km}} North/North East of Port-au-Prince proper in the commune of [[Tabarre]], is the primary transportation hub regarding entry and exit into the country.

It was inhabited by the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]], and [[Arawak peoples|Arawakan]] people, who variously called their island ''Ayiti'', ''Bohio'', or ''Kiskeya'' ''(Quisqueya)''. Columbus promptly claimed the island for the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]], naming it ''La Isla Espa\u00f1ola'' (\"the Spanish Island\"), later [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] to ''[[Hispaniola]]''. French influence began in 1625, and French control of what was called [[Saint-Domingue]]\u2014modern-day Haiti\u2014began in 1660. From 1697 on, the western part of the island was French and the eastern part was Spanish. Haiti became one of the wealthiest of France's colonies, producing vast quantities of sugar and coffee and depended on a brutal slave system for the necessary labor. Inspired by the message of the [[French Revolution]], Haitian slaves rose up in [[Haitian Revolution#The Revolution|revolt]] in 1791 and after decades of struggle the independent republic of Haiti was officially proclaimed in 1804.\n\n==Pre-Spanish history==\n{{Main|Chiefdoms of Hispaniola}}\n\nSuccessive waves of [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] migrants, moving northward from the [[Orinoco]] delta in South America, settled the islands of the [[Caribbean]]. Around A.D. 600, the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]], an Arawak culture, arrived on the island, displacing the previous inhabitants. They were organized into ''[[cacicazgo]]s'' (chiefdoms), each led by a ''cacique'' (chief).\n\n==Spanish history (1492\u20131625)==\n[[Christopher Columbus]] established the settlement, [[La Navidad]], near the modern town of [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]]. It was built from the timbers of his wrecked ship, [[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|Santa Mar\u00eda]], during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|first voyage]] in December 1492. When he returned in 1493 on his second voyage he found the settlement had been destroyed and all 39 settlers killed. Columbus continued east and founded a new settlement at [[La Isabela]] on the territory of the present-day [[Dominican Republic]] in 1493. The capital of the colony was moved to [[Santo Domingo]] in 1496, on the south west coast of the island also in the territory of the present-day Dominican Republic. The Spanish returned to western Hispaniola in 1502, establishing a settlement at Yaguana near modern-day [[L\u00e9og\u00e2ne]]. A second settlement was established on the north coast in 1504 called Puerto Real near modern [[Fort-Libert\u00e9]] \u2013 which in 1578 was relocated to a nearby site and renamed Bayaja.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haitiantreasures.com/HT_fort-liberte.htm |title=Fort-Libert\u00e9: A captivating Site |accessdate=2010-07-01 |publisher=Haitian Treasures |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527062805/http://www.haitiantreasures.com/HT_fort-liberte.htm |archivedate=27 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Clammer |first=Paul |author2=Michael Grosberg |author3=Jens Porup |title=Dominican Republic and Haiti |pages=339, 330\u2013333 |accessdate=2010-07-01 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kjde3Fmwb7IC&pg=PA340 |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2008 |isbn=1-74104-292-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://population.mongabay.com/population/haiti/3725170/fort-liberte |title=Population of Fort Libert\u00e9, Haiti |accessdate=2010-07-01 |publisher=Mongabay.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717220658/http://population.mongabay.com/population/haiti/3725170/fort-liberte |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the arrival of Europeans, La Hispaniola's indigenous population suffered greatly to near extinction, in possibly the worst case of depopulation in the Americas. A commonly accepted hypothesis attributes the high mortality of this colony in part to European diseases to which the natives had no immunity. A small number of [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00ednos]] were able to survive and set up villages elsewhere. Spanish interest in [[Hispaniola]] began to wane in the 1520s, as more lucrative [[gold]] and [[silver]] deposits were found in Mexico and South America. Thereafter, the population of Spanish Hispaniola grew at a slow pace.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe settlement of Yaguana was burnt to the ground three times in its just over a century long existence as a Spanish settlement, first by French pirates in 1543, again on May 27, 1592, by a 110-strong landing party from a four-ship English naval squadron led by [[Christopher Newport]] in his flagship Golden Dragon, who destroyed all 150 houses in the settlement, and finally by the Spanish themselves in 1605, for reasons set out below.<ref>''Historic Cities of the Americas: An Illustrated Encyclopedia'' (2005). David Marley. Page 121</ref>\n\nIn 1595, the Spanish, frustrated by the twenty-year [[Dutch Revolt|rebellion of their Dutch subjects]], closed their home ports to rebel shipping from the Netherlands, cutting them off from the critical salt supplies necessary for their herring industry. The Dutch responded by sourcing new salt supplies from Spanish America where colonists were more than happy to trade. So large numbers of Dutch traders/pirates joined their English and French brethren trading on the remote coasts of Hispaniola. In 1605, Spain was infuriated that Spanish settlements on the northern and western coasts of the island persisted in carrying out large scale and illegal trade with the Dutch, who were at that time fighting a war of independence against Spain in Europe and the English, a very recent enemy state, and so decided to forcibly resettle their inhabitants closer to the city of [[Santo Domingo]].<ref>Knight, Franklin, ''The Caribbean: The Genesis of a Fragmented Nationalism'', 3rd ed. p. 54 New York, Oxford University Press 1990.</ref> This action, known as the ''Devastaciones de Osorio'', proved disastrous; more than half of the resettled colonists died of starvation or disease, over 100,000 cattle were abandoned, and many slaves escaped.<ref>''Rough Guide to the Dominican Republic'', p. 352.</ref> Five of the existing thirteen settlements on the island were brutally razed by Spanish troops including the two settlements on the territory of present-day Haiti, La Yaguana, and Bayaja.

Routledge 2000, p. 397.</ref>\n\nThis Spanish action was counterproductive as English, Dutch, and French pirates were now free to establish bases on the island's abandoned northern and western coasts, where wild cattle were now plentiful and free. In 1697, after decades of fighting over the territory, the Spanish ceded the western\npart of the island to the French, who henceforth called it Saint-Domingue. Saint-Domingue developed into a highly lucrative colony for France. Its economy was based on a labor-intensive sugar industry which rested on vast numbers of African slaves. Meanwhile, the situation on the Spanish part of the island deteriorated. The entire Spanish empire sank into a deep economic crisis, and Santo Domingo was in addition struck by earthquakes, hurricanes and a shrinking population.\n\n==French Saint-Domingue (1625\u20131789)==\n{{Main|Saint-Domingue}}\n\n===The Pearl of the Antilles (1711\u201389)===\n[[File:D072- une sucrerie \u00e0 saint-domingue - Liv3-Ch16.png|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[sugar mill]] in Haiti (''L\u2019Homme et la Terre'' by [[\u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus]], 1830\u20131905)]]\n[[File:Cap_Fran\u00e7ais_-_Gravure_ancienne_-_1728.jpg|thumb|Engraving of [[Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]] in 1728]]\n\nIn 1711, the city of [[Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]] was formally established by [[Louis XIV]] and took over as capital of the colony from [[Port-de-Paix]]. In 1726, the city of [[Les Cayes]] was founded on the Southern coast which became the biggest settlement in the south. In 1749, the city of [[Port-au-Prince]] was established on the West coast, which in 1770 took over as the capital of the colony from Cap-Fran\u00e7ais, however that same year the [[1770 Port-au-Prince earthquake]] and tsunami destroyed the city killing 200 people immediately, and 30,000 later from famine and disease brought on by the natural disaster. This was the second major earthquake to hit Saint-Domingue as it followed the [[1751 Port-au-Prince earthquake]] which had left only a single stone built building standing in the town.\n\nPrior to the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u201363), the economy of Saint-Domingue gradually expanded, with sugar and, later, coffee becoming important export crops. After the war, which disrupted maritime commerce, the colony underwent rapid expansion. In 1767, it exported 72&nbsp;million pounds of [[raw sugar]] and 51&nbsp;million pounds of refined sugar, one million pounds of indigo, and two million pounds of cotton.<ref>{{cite book |first=CLR |last=James |title=The Black Jacobins |publisher=Vintage Books |place=New York |year=1963 |page=45}}</ref> Saint-Domingue became known as the \"Pearl of the [[Antilles]]\" \u2013 the richest colony in the 18th century [[French colonial empire|French empire]]. By the 1780s, Saint-Domingue produced about 40 percent of all the sugar and 60 percent of all the coffee consumed in Europe. This single colony, roughly the size of [[Hawaii]] or [[Belgium]], produced more sugar and coffee than all of [[British West Indies|Britain's West Indian colonies]] combined.\n\nIn the second half of the 1780s, Saint-Domingue accounted for a third of the entire [[Atlantic slave trade]].  The population of the African slaves imported for these plantations is estimated to have been 790,000.  Between 1764 and 1771, the average importation of slaves varied between 10,000\u201315,000, by 1786 about 28,000, and, from 1787 onward, the colony received more than 40,000 slaves a year. However, the inability to maintain slave numbers without constant resupply from Africa meant the slave population, by 1789, totaled 500,000, ruled over by a white population that, by 1789, numbered only 32,000.<ref>{{cite book |first=CLR |last=James |title=The Black Jacobins |page=55}}</ref> At all times, a majority of slaves in the colony were African-born, as the brutal conditions of slavery prevented the population from experiencing growth through natural increase [https://web.archive.org/web/20060617033237/http://www.africanaonline.com/slavery_colonial_era.htm]. African culture thus remained strong among slaves to the end of French rule, in particular the folk-religion of [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]], which commingled Catholic liturgy and ritual with the beliefs and practices of [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]], [[Kingdom of Kongo|Congo]], and [[Dahomey]].<ref>Vodou is a Dahomean word meaning 'god' or 'spirit</ref> Slave traders scoured the Atlantic coast of Africa, and the slaves who arrived came from hundreds of different tribes, their languages often mutually incomprehensible.\n\n[[File:Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re Aerial View.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re]], built by [[Henri Christophe]], is the largest [[fortress]] in the Americas.]]\nTo regularize slavery, in 1685 [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] enacted the ''[[Code Noir]]'', which accorded certain human rights to slaves and responsibilities to the master, who was obliged to feed, clothe, and provide for the general well-being of their slaves. The ''code noir'' also sanctioned corporal punishment, allowing masters to employ brutal methods to instill in their slaves the necessary docility, while ignoring provisions intended to regulate the administration of punishments. A passage from [[Henri Christophe]]'s personal secretary, who lived more than half his life as a slave, describes the crimes perpetrated against the slaves of Saint-Domingue by their French masters:\n\n{{quote|\nHave they not hung up men with heads downward, drowned them in sacks, crucified them on planks, buried them alive, crushed them in mortars? Have they not forced them to eat excretement? And, having flayed them with the lash, have they not cast them alive to be devoured by worms, or onto anthills, or lashed them to stakes in the swamp to be devoured by mosquitoes? Have they not thrown them into boiling cauldrons of cane syrup? Have they not put men and women inside barrels studded with spikes and rolled them down mountainsides into the abyss? Have they not consigned these miserable blacks to man-eating dogs until the latter, sated by human flesh, left the mangled victims to be finished off with bayonet and poniard?\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Robert Heinl |title=Written in Blood: The Story of the Haitian People, 1492\u20131995 |publisher=[[University Press of America]] |location=Lantham, Maryland |year=1996 |ref=harv}}</ref>}}\n\nThousands of slaves found freedom by fleeing from their masters, forming communities of [[maroon (people)|maroons]] and raiding isolated plantations. The most famous was [[Fran\u00e7ois Mackandal|Mackandal]], a one-armed slave, originally from [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]], who escaped in 1751. A [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] Houngan (priest), he united many of the different maroon bands. He spent the next six years staging successful raids and evading capture by the French, reputedly killing over 6,000 people, while preaching a fanatic vision of the destruction of white civilization in St. Domingue. In 1758, after a failed plot to poison the drinking water of the plantation owners, he was captured and burned alive at the public square in Cap-Fran\u00e7ais.\n\nSaint-Domingue also had the largest and wealthiest [[free people of color|free population of color]] in the [[History of the Caribbean|Caribbean]], the ''[[gens de couleur]]'' (French, \"people of color\"). The mixed-race community in Saint-Domingue numbered 25,000 in 1789. First-generation gens de couleur were typically the offspring of a male, French slaveowner and an African slave chosen as a concubine. In the French colonies, the semi-official institution of \"[[pla\u00e7age]]\" defined this practice. By this system, the children were free people and could inherit property, thus originating a class of \"mulattos\" with property and some with wealthy fathers. This class occupied a middle status between African slaves and French colonists. Africans who attained freedom also enjoyed status as gens de couleur.\n\nAs numbers of ''gens de couleur'' grew, the French rulers enacted discriminatory laws. Statutes forbade ''gens de couleur'' from taking up certain professions, marrying whites, wearing European clothing, carrying swords or firearms in public, or attending social functions where whites were present. However, these regulations did not restrict their purchase of land, and many accumulated substantial holdings and became slave-owners. By 1789, they owned one-third of the plantation property and one-quarter of the slaves of [[Saint-Domingue]].<ref>{{cite book |publisher=GMU |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap8a.html |title=Revolution |chapter=8 |page=1 |access-date=14 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105214459/http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap8a.html |archive-date=5 November 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Central to the rise of the ''gens de couleur'' planter class was the growing importance of coffee, which thrived on the marginal hillside plots to which they were often relegated. The largest concentration of ''gens de couleur'' was in the southern peninsula, the last region of the colony to be settled, owing to its distance from Atlantic shipping lanes and its formidable terrain, with the highest mountain range in the Caribbean.\n\n==Revolutionary period (1789\u20131804)==\n[[File:Toussaint L'Ouverture.jpg|thumb|As unofficial leader of the revolution, [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] is considered the father of Haiti.]]\n{{Main|Haitian Revolution}}\n\n===Og\u00e9's revolt (1789\u201391)===\nThe outbreak of [[French Revolution|revolution in France]] in the summer of 1789 had a powerful effect on the colony. While the French settlers debated how new revolutionary laws would apply to Saint-Domingue, outright civil war broke out in 1790 when the free men of color claimed they too were French citizens under the terms of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]. Ten days before the fall of the [[Bastille]], in July 1789, the French [[National Assembly]] had voted to seat six delegates from Saint-Domingue. In Paris, a group of wealthy mulattoes, led by [[Julien Raimond]] and [[Vincent Og\u00e9]], unsuccessfully petitioned the white planter delegates to support mulatto claims for full civil and political rights. Through the efforts of a group called [[Society of the Friends of the Blacks|''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Amis des Noirs'']], of which Raimond and Og\u00e9 were prominent leaders, in March 1790 the [[National Assembly]] granted full civic rights to the ''gens de couleur.''\nVincent Og\u00e9 traveled to St. Domingue to secure the promulgation and implementation of this decree, landing near Cap-Fran\u00e7ais (now [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]]) in October 1790 and petitioning the royal governor, the Comte de Peynier. After his demands were refused, he attempted to incite the ''gens de couleur'' to revolt. Og\u00e9 and Jean-Baptiste Chavennes, a veteran of the [[Siege of Savannah]] during the [[American Revolution]], attempted to attack Cap-Fran\u00e7ais. However, the mulatto rebels refused to arm or free their slaves, or to challenge the status of slavery, and their attack was defeated by a force of white militia and black volunteers (including [[Henri Christophe]]). Afterwards, they fled across the frontier to [[Hinche]], at the time in the Spanish part of the island. However, they were captured, returned to the French authorities, and both Og\u00e9 and Chavennes were executed in February 1791.\n\n===The rising of the slaves (1791\u201393)===\n[[File:Incendie_de_la_Plaine_du_Cap._-_Massacre_des_Blancs_par_les_Noirs._FRANCE_MILITAIRE._-_Martinet_del._-_Masson_Sculp_-_33.jpg|thumb|\"Burning of the Plaine du Cap \u2013 Massacre of whites by the blacks\". On August 22, 1791, slaves set fire to plantations, torched cities and massacred the white population.]]\nOn 14 August 1791, slaves in the northern region of the colony staged a revolt that began the [[Haitian Revolution]]. Tradition marks the beginning of the revolution at a [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]] ceremony at [[Bois Ca\u00efman]] (Alligator Woods) near Cap-Fran\u00e7ais. The call to arms was issued by a [[Houngan]] (Vodou priest) named [[Dutty Boukman]]. Within hours, the northern plantations were in flames. The rebellion spread through the entire colony. Boukman was captured and executed, but the rebellion continued to spread rapidly.\n\nIn 1792, [[L\u00e9ger-F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Sonthonax]] was sent to the colony by the French Legislative Assembly as part of the Revolutionary Commission. His main goal was to maintain French control of Saint-Domingue, stabilize the colony, and enforce the social equality recently granted to free people of color by the National Convention of France.\n\n===Toussaint Louverture ascendant (1793\u20131802)===\n[[File:Vue_de_l%27incendie_de_la_ville_du_cap_fran\u00e7ais_f1.highres.jpg|thumb|Fire of [[Cap Fran\u00e7ais]], 21 June 1793]]\n[[Image:Andr\u00e9 Rigaud.gif|thumb|Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]]\n{{main|:s:Constitution of Saint-Domingue}}\n\nOn 29 August 1793, Sonthonax took the radical step of proclaiming the freedom of the slaves in the north province (with severe limits on their freedom). In September and October, emancipation was extended throughout the colony. The French National Convention, the first elected Assembly of the [[French First Republic|First Republic]] (1792\u20131804), on 4 February 1794, under the leadership of [[Maximilien de Robespierre]], abolished slavery by law in France and all its colonies. The constitution of 1793, which was never applied, and the constitution of 1795, which was put into effect, did both contain an explicit ban on slavery.\n\nThe slaves did not immediately flock to Sonthonax's banner, however. White colonists continued to fight Sonthonax, with assistance from the British. They were joined by many of the free men of color who opposed the abolition of slavery. It was not until word of France's ratification of emancipation arrived back in the colony that [[Toussaint Louverture]] and his corps of well disciplined, battle-hardened former slaves came over to the French Republican side in early May 1794. A change in the political winds in France caused Sonthonax to be recalled in 1796, but not before taking the step of arming the former slaves.\n\nWhen the radical revolutionaries in Paris declared war against Spain in January 1793, the Spanish Crown sent its forces in [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] into battle on the side of the slaves. By the end of 1793, Spain controlled most of the north, except British-held M\u00f4le-Saint-Nicolas and French-held Le Cap Fran\u00e7ois and Port-de-Paix.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Haitian Revolution, 1789-1804|date=1973|publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press|page=79}}</ref> In 1795, Spain ceded Santo Domingo to France and Spanish attacks on Saint-Domingue ceased.\n\nIn the south the British suffered a series of defeats at the hands of the mulatto General [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]]. On October 6, 1794, Rigaud took L\u00e9ogane.

For a time, Leclerc met with some success; he also brought the eastern part of the island of Hispaniola under the direct control of France in accordance with the terms of the 1795 [[Peace of Basel|Treaties of B\u00e2le]] with Spain. With a large expedition that eventually included 40,000 European troops, and receiving help from white colonists and mulatto forces commanded by [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion]], a former lieutenant of Rigaud, the French won several victories after severe fighting. Two of Toussaint's chief lieutenants, Dessalines and Christophe, recognizing their untenable situation, held separate parleys with the invaders, and agreed to transfer their allegiance. At this point, Leclerc invited Toussaint to negotiate a settlement. It was a deception; Toussaint was seized and deported to France, where he died of [[pneumonia]] while imprisoned at [[Fort de Joux]] in the [[Jura Mountains]] in April 1803.\n\nOn 20 May 1802, Napoleon signed a law to maintain slavery where it had not yet disappeared, namely [[Martinique]], [[Tobago]], and [[Saint Lucia]]. A confidential copy of this decree was sent to Leclerc, who was authorized to restore slavery in Saint-Domingue when the time was opportune. At the same time, further edicts stripped the ''gens de couleur'' of their newly won civil rights. None of these decrees were published or executed in St. Domingue, but, by midsummer, word began to reach the colony of the French intention to restore slavery. The betrayal of Toussaint and news of French actions in Martinique undermined the collaboration of leaders such as [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]], [[Henri Christophe|Christophe]], and [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion|P\u00e9tion]]. Convinced that the same fate lay in store for Saint-Domingue, these commanders and others once again battled Leclerc. With the French intent on reconquest and re-enslavement of the colony's black population, the war became a bloody struggle of atrocity and attrition. The rainy season brought [[yellow fever]] and [[malaria]], which took a heavy toll on the invaders. By November, when Leclerc died of yellow fever, 24,000 French soldiers were dead and 8,000 were hospitalized, the majority from disease.<ref>{{cite book |first=CLR |last=James |title=Black Jacobins |page=355}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Leclerc was replaced by [[Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau]]. Rochambeau wrote to Napoleon that, to reclaim Saint-Domingue, France must 'declare the negroes slaves, and destroy at least 30,000 negroes and negresses.'<ref>{{cite book |first=CLR |last=James |title=Black Jacobins |page=360}}</ref> In his desperation, he turned to increasingly wanton acts of brutality; the French burned alive, hanged, drowned, and tortured black prisoners, reviving such practices as burying blacks in piles of insects and boiling them in cauldrons of molasses. One night, at Port-R\u00e9publican, he held a ball to which he invited the most prominent mulatto ladies and, at midnight, announced the death of their husbands. However, each act of brutality was repaid by the Haitian rebels. After one battle, Rochambeau buried 500 prisoners alive; Dessalines responded by hanging 500 French prisoners.<ref>{{harvnb|Heinl|1996|pp=108\u20139}}</ref> Rochambeau's brutal tactics helped unite black, mulatto, and mestizo soldiers against the French.\n\nAs the tide of the war turned toward the former slaves, Napoleon abandoned his dreams of restoring France's New World empire. In 1803, war resumed between France and Britain, and with the [[Royal Navy]] firmly in control of the seas, reinforcements and supplies for Rochambeau never arrived in sufficient numbers. To concentrate on the war in Europe, Napoleon signed the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in April, selling France's North American possessions to the United States. The Haitian army, now led by Dessalines, devastated Rochembeau and the French army at the [[Battle of Verti\u00e8res]] on 18 November 1803.\n\nOn 1 January 1804 Dessalines then declared independence,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/dol/images/examples/haiti/0001.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=National archives |place=UK |title=D\u00e9claration d'ind\u00e9pendance}}</ref> reclaiming the indigenous Ta\u00edno name of Haiti (\"Land of Mountains\") for the new nation. Most of the remaining French colonists fled ahead of the defeated French army, many migrating to [[Louisiana]] or [[Cuba]]. Unlike Toussaint, Dessalines showed little equanimity with regard to the whites. In a final act of retribution, [[1804 Haiti massacre|the remaining French were slaughtered by Haitian military forces]]. Some 2,000 Frenchmen were massacred at Cap-Fran\u00e7ais, 900 in Port-au-Prince, and 400 at J\u00e9r\u00e9mie.

At the time, there was a familiar situation going on back in their homeland, as these Polish soldiers were fighting for their liberty from the invading Russia, Prussia and Austria that began in 1772. As hopeful as the Haitians, many Poles were seeking union amongst themselves to win back their homeland. As a result, many Polish soldiers admired their enemy and decided to turn on the French army and join the [[Haiti]]an slaves, and participated in the Haitian revolution of 1804, supporting the principles of liberty for all the people. [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Franciszek Jab\u0142onowski]] who was half-Black was one of the Polish generals at the time. Polish soldiers had a remarkable input in helping the Haitians in the retaliation fights against the French oppressor. They were spared the fate of other Europeans. For their loyalty and support for overthrowing the French, some Poles acquired Haitian citizenship after Haiti gained its Independence, and many of them settled there to never return to [[Poland]]. It is estimated that around 500 of the 5280 Poles chose this option. Of the remainder, 700 returned to France to eventually return to Poland, and some \u2013 after capitulation \u2013 were forced to serve in British units.<ref name=\"North\" /> 160 Poles were later given permission to leave Haiti and some particular ones were sent to France at Haitian expense. To this day, many Polish Haitians still live in Haiti and are of [[Mulatto|mixed racial origin]], however some have blonde hair, light eyes, and other European features. Today, descendants of those Poles who stayed are living in [[Cazale]], [[Fond-des-Blancs]], [[La Vall\u00e9e-de-Jacmel]], [[La Baleine]], [[Port-Salut]] and [[Saint-Jean-du-Sud]].<ref name=\"North\" />\n\nDespite the Haitian victory, France refused to recognize the newly independent country's sovereignty until 1825, in exchange for 150&nbsp;million gold francs. This fee, demanded as retribution for the \"lost property,\"\u2014slaves, land, equipment etc.\u2014of the former colonialists, was later reduced to 90&nbsp;million.

Furthermore, owing to entrenched opposition from Southern slave states, Haiti did not receive U.S. diplomatic recognition until 1862 (after those states had seceded from the Union) \u2013 largely through the efforts of anti-slavery senator [[Charles Sumner]] of Massachusetts.\n\nUpon assuming power, General Dessalines authorized the Constitution of 1804. This constitution, in terms of social freedoms, called for:\n# Freedom of religion (Under Toussaint, Catholicism had been declared the official state religion);\n# All citizens of Haiti, regardless of skin color, to be known as \"Black\" (this was an attempt to eliminate the multi-tiered racial hierarchy that had developed in Haiti, with full or near full-blooded Europeans at the top, various levels of light to brown skin in the middle, and dark skinned \"Kongo\" from Africa at the bottom).\n# White men were forbidden from possessing property or domain on Haitian soil.

Yet two of his own advisers, [[Henri Christophe]] and [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion]], helped provoke his assassination in 1806. The conspirators ambushed him north of [[Port-au-Prince]] at Pont Larnage (now known as Pont-Rouge) on 17 October 1806 en route to battle rebels to his regime.\n\nThe state created under Dessalines was the opposite of what the Haitian mass or the peasantry preferred. While both the elite leaders, such as Dessalines, as well as the Haitian population agreed the state should be built on the ideals of freedom and democracy,<ref>Jean-Jaques Dessalines, Haitian Declaration of Independence, 1804.

The leaders of Haiti tied independence from other powers as their notion of freedom. However, the Haitian peasantry tied their notion of freedom to the land. Because of the mountainous terrain, Haitian slaves were able to cultivate their own small tracts of land. Thus, freedom for them was the ability to cultivate their own land, within a subsistence economy. Unfortunately, because of the leaders desires, a system of coerced plantation agriculture emerged.<ref>James Franklin, the Present State of Hayti with remarks on its agriculture, commerce, laws, religion, finances and population (Connecticut: Negro Universities Press, 1828), 189-190.</ref> Furthermore, while all Haitians desired a black republic,<ref name=\"faculty.webster.edu\"/> the cultural practices of African-Americans were a point of contention. Many within the Haitian population wanted to maintain their African heritage, which is a logical connection to wanting a black republic. However, the elites typically tried to prove the sophistication of Haitians through literature. Some authors wrote that the barbarism of Africa must be expelled, while maintaining African roots.<ref>Beaubrun Ardouin, Etudes sur l\u2019historie d\u2019Haiti suivies de la vie du general J.M. Borgella (Paris: Dezobry et Magdeleine, 1853-1860), quoted in Erin Zavitz, \"Revolutionary narrations: Early Haitian historiography and the challenge of writing counter-history,\" Atlantic Studies, 14, no. 3 (2017).</ref> Furthermore, other authors tried to prove the civility of the elite Haitians by arguing that blacks were capable of establishing and running a government by changing and augmenting the history of the revolution, to favor the mulatto and black elites, rather than the bands of slaves.<ref>Thomas Madiou, Histoire d\u2019Haiti, 1847. Quoted in Erin Zavitz, \"Revolutionary narrations: Early Haitian historiography and the challenge of writing counter-history,\" Atlantic Studies, 14, no. 3 (2017), 343.</ref> Furthermore, to maintain freedom and independence, the elites failed to provide a civil society that the Haitian mass desired. The Haitian peasants desired not only land freedom, but also civil rights, such as voting and political participation, as well as access to education.<ref name=\"Mimi Sheller 2000\"/> The state failed to provide these basic rights. The state was essentially run by the military, which meant that it was very difficult for the Haitian population to participate in democratic processes. Most importantly, the state failed to provide proper access to education that a state consisting of former slaves would need.<ref>M.B. Bird, the Black Man or Haytian Independence (New York: Published by Author, 1869), 220.</ref> It was nearly impossible for the former slaves to participate effectively because they lacked the basic literacy that was intentionally taken from them by French colonial rule. Through differing views on Haitian nationalism and freedom, the elites created a state that greatly favored them, over the Haitian population and the Haitian peasantry.\n\n===The struggle for unity (1806\u201320)===\n[[File:Duckworth's Action off San Domingo, 6 February 1806.jpg|thumb|The [[battle of Santo Domingo]] (1806) painted by \t\nNicholas Pocock in 1808]]\n\nAfter the Dessalines coup d'\u00e9tat, the two main conspirators divided the country in two rival regimes. Christophe created the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[State of Haiti]] in the north, and the [[Gens de couleur]] P\u00e9tion helped establish the [[Haiti|Republic of Haiti]] in the south. Christophe attempted to maintain a strict system of labor and agricultural production akin to the former plantations. Although, strictly speaking, he did not establish slavery, he imposed a semi-feudal system, fumage, in which every able man was required to work in plantations (similar to [[Latifundia|latifundios]]) to produce goods for the fledging country. His method, though undoubtedly oppressive, produced the most revenues of the two governments.\n\nBy contrast, P\u00e9tion broke up the former colonial estates and parceled out the land into small holdings. In P\u00e9tion's south, the [[gens de couleur]] minority led the government and feared losing popular support, and thus, sought to assuage class tensions with land redistribution. Because of the weak international position and its labor policies (most peasants lived through a subsistence economy), P\u00e9tion's government was perpetually on the brink of bankruptcy. Yet, for most of its time, it produced one of the most liberal and tolerant Haitian governments ever. In 1815, at a key period of [[Military career of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar's fight for Venezuelan independence]], he gave the Venezuelan leader [[right of asylum|asylum]] and provided him soldiers and substantial material support. It also had the least of internal military skirmishes, despite its continuous conflicts with Christophe's northern kingdom. In 1816, however, after finding the burden of the [[Senate]] intolerable, he suspended the legislature and turned his post into [[President for Life]]. Not long after, he died of [[yellow fever]], and his assistant [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]] replaced him.\n\n[[File:Kingdom of Haiti.jpg|thumbnail|The Kingdom of Haiti in the North and the Republic of Haiti in the South]]\nIn this period, the eastern part of the island rose against the new powers following general Juan S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez's claims of independence from France, which broke the Treaties of B\u00e2le attacking Spain and prohibited commerce with Haiti. In the Palo Hincado battle (7 November 1808), all the remaining French forces were defeated by Spanish-creole insurrectionists. On 9 July 1809, Santo Domingo was born. The government put itself under the control of Spain, earning it the nickname of \"Espa\u00f1a Boba\" (meaning \"The Idiot Spain\").\n\nIn 1811, Christophe proclaimed himself King Henri I in the North and commissioned several extraordinary buildings. He even created a nobility class in the fashion of European monarchies. Yet in 1820, weakened by illness and with a decreasing support for his authoritarian regime, he killed himself with a silver bullet rather than face a coup d'\u00e9tat. Immediately after, P\u00e9tion's successor, Boyer, reunited Haiti through diplomatic tactics, and ruled as president until his overthrow in 1843.\n\n===Boyer's domination of Hispaniola (1820\u201343)===\n{{main|Unification of Hispaniola}}\n[[File:President_Jean-Pierre_Boyer_of_Haiti_(Hispaniola_Unification_Regime)_Portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Pierre Boyer]]]]\n\nAlmost two years after Boyer had consolidated power in the west, in 1821, Santo Domingo declared independence from Spain and requested from Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar inclusion in the [[Gran Colombia]]. Boyer, however, responding to a party on the east that preferred Haiti over Colombia, occupied the ex-Spanish colony in January 1822, encountering no military resistance. In this way he accomplished the unity of the island, which was only carried out for a short period of time by [[Toussaint Louverture]] in 1801. Boyer's occupation of the Spanish side also responded to internal struggles among Christophe's generals, to which Boyer gave extensive powers and lands in the east. This occupation, however, pitted the Spanish white elite against the iron fisted Haitian administration, and stimulated the emigration of many white wealthy families. The entire island remained under Haitian rule until 1844, when in the east a nationalist group called [[La Trinitaria (Dominican Republic)|La Trinitaria]] led a revolt that partitioned the island into [[Haiti]] on the west and [[Dominican Republic]] on the east, based on what would appear to be a riverine territorial 'divide' from the pre-contact period.\n\nFrom 1824 to 1826, while the island was under one government, Boyer promoted the largest single [[Haitian emigration|free-Black immigration]] from the [[Thomas Jefferson and Haitian Emigration|United States]] in which more than 6,000 immigrants settled in different parts of the island. Today remnants of these immigrants live throughout the island, but the larger number reside in [[Saman\u00e1 Peninsula|Saman\u00e1]], a peninsula on the Dominican side of the island. From the government's perspective, the intention of the immigration was to help establish commercial and diplomatic relationships with the US, and to increase the number of skilled and agricultural workers in Haiti.\n\n[[File:Sans Souci Palace.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the [[Sans-Souci Palace]], severely damaged in the 1842 earthquake and never rebuilt]]\nIn exchange for diplomatic recognition from France, Boyer was forced to pay a huge indemnity for the loss of French property during the revolution. To pay for this, he had to float loans in France, putting Haiti into a state of debt. Boyer attempted to enforce production through the ''Code Rural'', enacted in 1826, but peasant freeholders, mostly former revolutionary soldiers, had no intention of returning to the forced labor they fought to escape. By 1840, Haiti had ceased to export sugar entirely, although large amounts continued to be grown for local consumption as ''taffia''-a raw rum. However, Haiti continued to export coffee, which required little cultivation and grew semi-wild.\n\nThe [[1842 Cap-Ha\u00eftien earthquake]] destroyed the city, and the [[Sans-Souci Palace]], killing 10,000 people. This was the third major earthquake to hit Western Hispaniola following the 1751 and 1770 Port-au-Prince earthquakes, and the last until the devastating earthquake of 2010.\n\nHaiti went through a long period of oppression and instability following the presidency of Jean-Pierre Boyer. Likewise, in the Dominican Republic, a succession of [[caudillo|strongmen]] ruled harshly during the last half of the 19th century, crushed frequent uprisings, and repelled Haitian invasions.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Kohn|editor1-first=George Childs|title=Dictionary of Wars|date=2013|publisher=Routledge}}</ref>\n\n==Political struggles (1843\u20131911)==\n[[File:Sacre de l'empereur Faustin Soulouque.jpg|thumb|The coronation of [[Faustin I of Haiti]] in 1849]]\n\n[[File:Palais-National incendi\u00e9 par Salnave.jpg|thumb|The National Palace burned down during the revolt against Salnave in 1868]]\n\n[[File:Haiti German legation 1900.jpg|thumb|Staff of the German legation and the Hamburg-Amerika Line agency at Port-au-Prince, Haiti in 1900.

Revolts soon broke out and the country descended into near chaos, with a series of transient presidents until March 1847, when General [[Faustin I of Haiti|Faustin Soulouque]], a former slave who had fought in the rebellion of 1791, became president. He purged the military high command, established a secret police, and eliminated mulatto opponents. In August 1849, he grandiosely proclaimed himself as Haiti's second emperor, Faustin I. Soulouque's expansive ambitions led him to mount several invasions of the Dominican Republic. The new emperor had been called a ''rey de farsa'' by the Dominicans. The white and mulatto rulers of the Dominican Republic he considered as his \"natural\" enemies, and he could never consolidate his rule without this conquest, for his reign had been founded on domination and would stand only by it.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baur|first1=John E.|title=Faustin Soulouque, Emperor of Haiti His Character and His Reign|date=1949|page=143}}</ref> When in 1849 Soulouque led his first invasion into the Dominican Republic, President [[Buenaventura B\u00e1ez]] declared war on Haiti.

When he rode into Port-au-Prince with what remained of his army he was loudly cursed by women who had lost their sons, brothers, and husbands in the war.<ref name=Smith/> Four years later, he was deposed by General [[Fabre Geffrard]], styled the Duke of Tabara.\n\nGeffrard's military government held office until 1867, and he encouraged a successful policy of national reconciliation. In 1860, he reached an agreement with the [[Roman Catholic Church|Vatican]], reintroducing official Roman Catholic institutions, including schools, to the nation. In 1867 an attempt was made to establish a constitutional government, but successive presidents [[Sylvain Salnave]] and [[Nissage Saget]] were overthrown in 1869 and 1874 respectively. A more workable constitution was introduced under [[Michel Domingue]] in 1874, leading to a long period of democratic peace and development for Haiti. The debt to France was finally repaid in 1879, and Michel Domingue's government peacefully transferred power to [[Lysius Salomon]], one of Haiti's abler leaders. Monetary reform and a cultural renaissance ensued with a flowering of Haitian art.\n\nThe last two decades of the 19th century were also marked by the development of a Haitian intellectual culture. Major works of history were published in 1847 and 1865. Haitian intellectuals, led by [[Louis-Joseph Janvier]] and [[Ant\u00e9nor Firmin]], engaged in a war of letters against a tide of racism and [[Social Darwinism]] that emerged during this period.\n\nThe Constitution of 1867 saw peaceful and progressive transitions in government that did much to improve the economy and stability of the Haitian nation and the condition of its people. Constitutional government restored the faith of the Haitian people in legal institutions. The development of industrial sugar and rum industries near [[Port-au-Prince]] made Haiti, for a while, a model for economic growth in Latin American countries.\nThis period of relative stability and prosperity ended in 1911, when revolution broke out and the country slid once again into disorder and debt.\n\nFrom 1911 to 1915, there were six different presidents, each of whom was killed or forced into exile.<ref>{{harvnb|Heinl|1996|p=791}}</ref> The revolutionary armies were formed by ''cacos'', peasant brigands from the mountains of the north, along the porous Dominican border, who were enlisted by rival political factions with promises of money to be paid after a successful revolution and an opportunity to plunder.\n\nThe United States was particularly apprehensive about the role of the German community in Haiti (approximately 200 in 1910), who wielded a disproportionate amount of economic power. Germans controlled about 80% of the country's international commerce; they also owned and operated utilities in Cap Ha\u00eftien and Port-au-Prince, the main [[wharf]] and a tramway in the capital, and a railroad serving the Plaine de Cul-du-Sac.\n\nThe German community proved more willing to integrate into Haitian society than any other group of white foreigners, including the French. A number married into the nation's most prominent mulatto families, bypassing the constitutional prohibition against foreign land-ownership. They also served as the principal financiers of the nation's innumerable revolutions, floating innumerable loans-at high interest rates-to competing political factions.\n\nIn an effort to limit German influence, in 1910\u201311, the US State Department backed a consortium of American investors, assembled by the [[Citibank|National City Bank of New York]], in acquiring control of the ''Banque Nationale d'Ha\u00efti'', the nation's only commercial bank and the government treasury.\n\nIn February 1915, [[Vilbrun Guillaume Sam]] established a dictatorship, but in July, facing a new revolt, he massacred 167 political prisoners, all of whom were from elite families, and was lynched by a mob in [[Port-au-Prince]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Fabre Geffrard (President d'Haiti 1859-1867).jpg|[[Fabre Geffrard]]\nFile:Charles Rivi\u00e8re-H\u00e9rard.jpg|[[Charles Rivi\u00e8re-H\u00e9rard]]\nFile:Michel Domingue (President d'Haiti 1874-1876).jpg|[[Michel Domingue]]\nFile:Salomon 200.jpg|[[Lysius Salomon]]\n</gallery>\n\n==United States occupation (1915\u201334)==\n{{See also|United States occupation of Haiti}}\n[[File:Occupation of Haiti.jpg|thumbnail|United States Marines and a Haitian guide patrolling the jungle in 1915 during the Battle of Fort Dipitie]]\n[[File:American Marines In 1915 defending the entrance gate in Cap-Haitian - 34510.jpg|thumb|American Marines in 1915 defending the entrance gate in Cap-Ha\u00eften]]\n[[File:Marines' base in Cap-Ha\u00eftien.jpg|thumb|Marine's base at Cap-Ha\u00eftien]]\n[[File:Inauguration du Mausol\u00e9e de P\u00e9tion et de Dessalines.jpg|thumb|Opening of the mausoleum of P\u00e9tion and Dessalines in 1926]]\n[[File:Bread market, St. Michel (Haiti) (15629128676).jpg|thumb|Bread market in St. Michel, 1928\u20131929]]\n\nIn 1915 the United States, responding to complaints to President [[Woodrow Wilson]] from American banks to which Haiti was deeply in debt, occupied the country. The [[United States occupation of Haiti|occupation of Haiti]] lasted until 1934. The US occupation was resented by Haitians as a loss of sovereignty and there were revolts against US forces. Reforms were however carried out.\n\nUnder the supervision of the United States Marines, the Haitian National Assembly elected [[Philippe Sudr\u00e9 Dartiguenave]] president. He signed a treaty that made Haiti a ''de jure'' US protectorate, with American officials assuming control over the Financial Adviser, Customs Receivership, the Constabulary, the Public Works Service, and the Public Health Service for a period of ten years. The principal instrument of American authority was the newly created ''Gendarmerie d'Ha\u00efti'', commanded by American officers. In 1917, at the demand of US officials, the National Assembly was dissolved, and officials were designated to write a new constitution, which was largely dictated by officials in the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] and [[United States Department of the Navy|US Navy Department]]. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Under-Secretary for the Navy in the [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] administration, claimed to have personally written the new constitution. This document abolished the prohibition on foreign ownership of land \u2013 the most essential component of Haitian law. When the newly elected National Assembly refused to pass this document and drafted one of its own preserving this prohibition, it was forcibly dissolved by ''Gendarmerie'' commandant [[Smedley Butler]]. This constitution was approved by a plebiscite in 1919, in which less than 5% of the population voted. The US State Department authorized this plebiscite presuming that \"the people casting ballots would be 97% illiterate, ignorant in most cases of what they were voting for.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Hans Schmidt |title=The United States Occupation of Haiti, 1915\u20131934 |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |year=1971 |isbn=9780813522036 |page=99 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThe Marines and ''Gendarmerie'' initiated an extensive road-building program to enhance their military effectiveness and open the country to US investment. Lacking any source of adequate funds, they revived an 1864 Haitian law, discovered by Butler, requiring peasants to perform labor on local roads in lieu of paying a road tax. This system, known as the [[corv\u00e9e]], originated in the unpaid labor that French peasants provided to their [[feudalism|feudal]] lords. In 1915, Haiti had {{convert|3|mi}} of road usable by automobile, outside the towns. By 1918, more than {{convert|470|mi|km}} of road had been built or repaired through the corv\u00e9e system, including a road linking [[Port-au-Prince]] to [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]].<ref>{{harvnb|Heinl|1996|pp=430}}</ref> However, Haitians forced to work in the corv\u00e9e labor-gangs, frequently dragged from their homes and harassed by armed guards, received few immediate benefits and saw this system of forced labor as a return to slavery at the hands of white men.\n\nIn 1919, a new ''caco'' uprising began, led by [[Charlemagne P\u00e9ralte]], vowing to 'drive the invaders into the sea and free Haiti.'<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Max Boot |last=Boot |first=Max |title=The Savage Wars of Peace: Small Wars and the Rise of American Power |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=046500721X |lccn=2004695066 |year=2003 |page=173}}</ref> The Cacos [[Battle of Port-au-Prince (1919)|attacked Port-au-Prince]] in October but were driven back with heavy casualties. Afterwards, a [[Haitian Creole language|Creole]]-speaking American ''Gendarmerie'' officer and two US marines infiltrated P\u00e9ralte's camp, killing him and photographing his corpse in an attempt to demoralize the rebels. Leadership of the rebellion passed to Beno\u00eet Batraville, a Caco chieftain from [[Artibonite (department)|Artibonite]], who also launched an [[Battle of Port-au-Prince (1920)|assault on the capital]]. His death in 1920 marked the end of hostilities. During Senate hearings in 1921, the commandant of the Marine Corps reported that, in the twenty months of active resistance, 2,250 Haitians had been killed. However, in a report to the Secretary of the Navy he reported the death toll as being 3,250.<ref>{{harvnb|Schmidt|1971|p=102}}</ref> Haitian historians have estimated the true number was much higher; one suggested, \"the total number of battle victims and casualties of repression and consequences of the war might have reached, by the end of the pacification period, four or five times that \u2013 somewhere in the neighborhood of 15,000 persons.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Farmer |authorlink=Paul Farmer |title=The Uses of Haiti |publisher=Common Courage Press |year=2003 |page=98}}</ref>\n\nIn 1922, Dartiguenave was replaced by [[Louis Borno]], who ruled without a legislature until 1930. That same year, General [[John H. Russell, Jr.]], was appointed High Commissioner. The Borno-Russel dictatorship oversaw the expansion of the economy, building over {{convert|1000|mi|km}} of road, establishing an automatic telephone exchange, modernizing the nation's port facilities, and establishing a public health service. [[Sisal]] was introduced to Haiti, and sugar and cotton became significant exports.<ref>{{harvnb|Heinl|1996|pp=454\u201355}}</ref> However, efforts to develop commercial agriculture had limited success, in part because much of Haiti's labor force was employed at seasonal work in the more established sugar industries of [[Cuba]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. An estimated 30,000\u201340,000 Haitian laborers, known as ''braceros'', went annually to the [[Oriente Province]] of Cuba between 1913 and 1931.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Bridget |last1=Woodling |first2=Richard |last2=Moseley-Williams |title=Needed but unwanted: Haitian Immigrants and their Descendants in the Dominican Republic |publisher=Catholic Institute for International Relations |place=London |year=2004 |page=24}}</ref> Most Haitians continued to resent the loss of sovereignty.

In December 1929, Marines in [[Les Cayes]] killed ten Haitians during a march to protest local economic conditions. This led [[Herbert Hoover]] to appoint two commissions, including one headed by a former US governor of the [[Philippines]] [[William Cameron Forbes]], which criticized the exclusion of Haitians from positions of authority in the government and constabulary, now known as the ''Garde d'Ha\u00efti''. In 1930, [[St\u00e9nio Vincent]], a long-time critic of the occupation, was elected president, and the US began to withdraw its forces. The withdrawal was completed under US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (FDR), in 1934, under his \"[[Good Neighbor policy]]\". The US retained control of Haiti's external finances until 1947.<ref>{{harvnb|Schmidt|1971|p=232}}</ref> All three rulers during the occupation came from the country's small [[mulatto]] minority. At the same time, many in the growing black professional classes departed from the traditional veneration of Haiti's French cultural heritage and emphasized the nation's African roots, most notably ethnologist [[Jean Price-Mars]] and the journal ''Les Griots'', edited by Dr. [[Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier]].{{Citation needed| date= January 2010}}\n\nThe transition government was left with a better infrastructure, public health, education, and agricultural development as well as a democratic system. The country had fully democratic elections in 1930, won by [[St\u00e9nio Vincent]]. The Garde was a new kind of military institution in Haiti. It was a force manned overwhelmingly by blacks, with a United States-trained black commander, Colonel D\u00e9mosth\u00e8nes P\u00e9trus Calixte. Most of the Garde's officers, however, were mulattoes. The Garde was a national organization;<ref name=oavommo /> it departed from the regionalism that had characterized most of Haiti's previous armies. In theory, its charge was apolitical\u2014to maintain internal order, while supporting a popularly elected government. The Garde initially adhered to this role.<ref name=oavommo>http://countrystudies.us/haiti/16.htm</ref>\n\n==Elections and coups (1934\u201357)==\n\n[[File:Stenio Vincent portrait.jpg|thumb|[[St\u00e9nio Vincent]]]]\n\n===Vincent's presidency (1934\u201341)===\nPresident Vincent took advantage of the comparative national stability, which was being maintained by a professionalized military, to gain absolute power. A plebiscite permitted the transfer of all authority in economic matters from the legislature to the executive, but Vincent was not content with this expansion of his power. In 1935 he forced through the legislature a new constitution, which was also approved by plebiscite. The constitution praised Vincent, and it granted the executive sweeping powers to dissolve the legislature at will, to reorganize the judiciary, to appoint ten of twenty-one senators (and to recommend the remaining eleven to the lower house), and to rule by decree when the legislature was not in session. Although Vincent implemented some improvements in infrastructure and services, he brutally repressed his opposition,censored the press, and governed largely to benefit himself and a clique of merchants and corrupt military officers.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nUnder Calixte the majority of Garde personnel had adhered to the doctrine of political nonintervention that their Marine Corps trainers had stressed. Over time, however, Vincent and Dominican dictator [[Rafael Trujillo|Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo Molina]] sought to buy adherents among the ranks. Trujillo, determined to expand his influence over all of Hispaniola, in October 1937 ordered the indiscriminate butchery by the Dominican army of an estimated 14,000 to 40,000<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barsamian |first1=David |title=Louder Than Bombs: Interviews from the Progressive Magazine |date=2004 |publisher=South End Press |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zWQkIPrIAAsC&pg=PA3&lpg=&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Haitians on the Dominican side of the [[Dajab\u00f3n River|Massacre River]]. Some observers claim that Trujillo supported an abortive coup attempt by young Garde officers in December 1937. Vincent dismissed Calixte as commander and sent him abroad, where he eventually accepted a commission in the Dominican military as a reward for his efforts while on Trujillo's payroll. The attempted coup led Vincent to purge the officer corps of all members suspected of disloyalty,  marking the end of the apolitical military.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n===Lescot's presidency (1941\u201346)===\n\n[[File:Elie Lescot portrait.jpg |thumb|[[\u00c9lie Lescot]]]]\n\nIn 1941 Vincent showed every intention of standing for a third term as president, but after almost a decade of disengagement, the United States made it known that it would oppose such an extension. Vincent accommodated the Roosevelt administration and handed power over to [[Elie Lescot]].<ref name=oavommo />\n\nLescot was a mulatto who had served in numerous government posts. He was competent and forceful, and many considered him a sterling candidate for the presidency, despite his elitist background. Like the majority of previous Haitian presidents, however, he failed to live up to his potential. His tenure paralleled that of Vincent in many ways. Lescot declared himself commander in chief of the military, and power resided in a clique that ruled with the tacit support of the Garde. He repressed his opponents, censored the press, and compelled the legislature to grant him extensive powers. He handled all budget matters without legislative sanction and filled legislative vacancies without calling elections. Lescot commonly said that Haiti's declared state-of-war against the Axis powers during World War II justified his repressive actions. Haiti, however, played no role in the war except for supplying the United States with raw materials and serving as a base for a United States Coast Guard detachment.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nAside from his authoritarian tendencies, Lescot had another flaw: his relationship with [[Rafael Trujillo]]. While serving as Haitian ambassador to the [[Dominican Republic]], Lescot fell under the sway of Trujillo's influence and wealth. In fact, it was Trujillo's money that reportedly bought most of the legislative votes that brought Lescot to power. Their clandestine association persisted until 1943, when the two leaders parted ways for unknown reasons. Trujillo later made public all his correspondence with the Haitian leader. The move undermined Lescot's already dubious popular support.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nIn January 1946, events came to a head when Lescot jailed the Marxist editors of a journal called ''La Ruche'' (The Beehive). This action precipitated student strikes and protests by government workers, teachers, and shopkeepers in the capital and provincial cities. In addition, Lescot's mulatto-dominated rule had alienated the predominantly black Garde. His position became untenable, and he resigned on 11 January. Radio announcements declared that the Garde had assumed power, which it would administer through a three-member junta.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n===Revolution of 1946===\n[[File:\"TOGETHER AGAIN FOR FREEDOM^\" - NARA - 535669.tif|thumb|\"Together again for freedom\", 1943 U.S. leaflet]]\n\nThe Revolution of 1946 was a novel development in Haiti's history, as the Garde assumed power as an institution, not as the instrument of a particular commander. The members of the junta, known as the Military Executive Committee (Comit\u00e9 Ex\u00e9cutif Militaire), were Garde commander [[Franck Lavaud|Colonel Franck Lavaud]], [[Antoine Levelt|Major Antoine Levelt]], and [[Paul E. Magloire|Major Paul E. Magloire]], commander of the Presidential Guard. All three understood Haiti's traditional way of exercising power, but they lacked a thorough understanding of what would be required to make the transition to an elected civilian government. Upon taking power, the junta pledged to hold free elections. The junta also explored other options, but public clamor, which included public demonstrations in support of potential candidates, eventually forced the officers to make good on their promise.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nHaiti elected its National Assembly in May 1946. The Assembly set 16 August 1946, as the date on which it would select a president. The leading candidates for the office\u2014all of whom were black\u2014were [[Dumarsais Estim\u00e9]], a former school teacher, assembly member, and cabinet minister under Vincent; [[F\u00e9lix d'Orl\u00e9ans Juste Constant]], leader of the [[Haitian Communist Party]] (Parti Communiste d'Ha\u00efti\u2014PCH); and former Garde commander [[D\u00e9mosth\u00e8nes P\u00e9trus Calixte]], who stood as the candidate of a progressive coalition that included the Worker Peasant Movement (Mouvement Ouvrier Paysan\u2014MOP). MOP chose to endorse Calixte, instead of a candidate from its own ranks, because the party's leader, [[Daniel Fignol\u00e9]], was only twenty-six years old\u2014too young to stand for the nation's highest office. Estim\u00e9, politically the most moderate of the three, drew support from the black population in the north, as well as from the emerging black middle class. The leaders of the military, who would not countenance the election of Juste Constant and who reacted warily to the populist Fignol\u00e9, also considered Estim\u00e9 the safest candidate. After two rounds of polling, legislators gave Estim\u00e9 the presidency.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n===Estim\u00e9's presidency (1946\u201350)===\n[[File:Dumarsais estime portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Dumarsais Estim\u00e9]] ]]\nEstim\u00e9's election represented a break with Haiti's political tradition. Although he was reputed to have received support from commanders of the Garde, Estim\u00e9 was a civilian. Of humble origins, he was passionately anti-elitist and therefore generally antimulatto. He demonstrated, at least initially, a genuine concern for the welfare of the people. Operating under a new constitution that went into effect in November 1946, Estim\u00e9 proposed, but never secured passage of, Haiti's first social- security legislation. He did, however, expand the school system, encourage the establishment of rural cooperatives, raise the salaries of civil servants, and increase the representation of middle-class and lower-class blacks in the public sector. He also attempted to gain the favor of the Garde\u2014renamed the Haitian Army (Arm\u00e9e d'Ha\u00efti) in March 1947\u2014by promoting Lavaud to brigadier general and by seeking United States military assistance.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nEstim\u00e9 eventually fell victim to two of the time-honored pitfalls of Haitian rule: elite intrigue and personal ambition. The elite had a number of grievances against Estim\u00e9. Not only had he largely excluded them from the often lucrative levers of government, but he also enacted the country's first income tax, fostered the growth of labor unions, and suggested that vodou be considered as a religion equivalent to Roman Catholicism\u2014a notion that the Europeanized elite abhorred. Lacking direct influence in Haitian affairs, the elite resorted to clandestine lobbying among the officer corps. Their efforts, in combination with deteriorating domestic conditions, led to a coup in May 1950.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nTo be sure, Estim\u00e9 had hastened his own demise in several ways. His nationalization of the Standard Fruit banana concession sharply reduced the firm's revenues. He alienated workers by requiring them to invest between 10 percent and 15 percent of their salaries in national-defense bonds. The president sealed his fate by attempting to manipulate the constitution in order to extend his term in office. Seizing on this action and the popular unrest it engendered, the army forced the president to resign on 10 May 1950. The same junta that had assumed power after the fall of Lescot reinstalled itself. An army escort conducted Estim\u00e9 from the National Palace and into exile in Jamaica. The events of May 1946 made an impression upon the deposed minister of labor, Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier. The lesson that Duvalier drew from Estim\u00e9's ouster was that the military could not be trusted. It was a lesson that he would act upon when he gained power.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n===Magloire's presidency (1950\u201356)===\n[[File:Paul Magloire portrait.jpg |thumb|[[Paul Magloire]] ]]\n\nThe power balance within the junta shifted between 1946 and 1950. Lavaud was the preeminent member at the time of the first coup, but Magloire, now a colonel, dominated after Estim\u00e9's overthrow. When Haiti announced that its first direct elections (all men twenty-one or over were allowed to vote) would be held on 8 October 1950, Magloire resigned from the junta and declared himself a candidate for president. In contrast to the chaotic political climate of 1946, the campaign of 1950 proceeded under the implicit understanding that only a strong candidate backed by both the army and the elite would be able to take power. Facing only token opposition, Magloire won the election and assumed office on 6 December.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nMagloire restored the elite to prominence. The business community and the government benefited from favorable economic conditions until Hurricane Hazel hit the island in 1954. Haiti made some improvements on its infrastructure, but most of these were financed largely by foreign loans. By Haitian standards, Magloire's rule was firm, but not harsh: he jailed political opponents, including Fignol\u00e9, and shut down their presses when their protests grew too strident, but he allowed labor unions to function, although they were not permitted to strike. It was in the arena of corruption, however, that Magloire overstepped traditional bounds. The president controlled the sisal, cement, and soap monopolies. He and other officials built imposing mansions. The injection of international hurricane relief funds into an already corrupt system boosted graft to levels that disillusioned all Haitians. To make matters worse, Magloire followed in the footsteps of many previous presidents by disputing the termination date of his stay in office. Politicians, labor leaders, and their followers flocked to the streets in May 1956 to protest Magloire's failure to step down. Although Magloire declared martial law, a general strike essentially shut down Port-au-Prince. Again like many before him, Magloire fled to Jamaica, leaving the army with the task of restoring order.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n===The rise of Duvalier (1956\u201357)===\nThe period between the fall of Magloire and the election of Duvalier in September 1957 was a chaotic one, even by Haitian standards. Three provisional presidents held office during this interval; one resigned and the army deposed the other two, Franck Sylvain and Fignol\u00e9. Duvalier is said to have engaged actively in the behind-the-scenes intrigue that helped him to emerge as the presidential candidate that the military favored. The military went on to guide the campaign and the elections in a way that gave Duvalier every possible advantage. Most political actors perceived Duvalier\u2014a medical doctor who had served as a rural administrator of a United States-funded anti-yaws campaign before entering the cabinet under Estim\u00e9\u2014as an honest and fairly unassuming leader without a strong ideological motivation or program. When elections were finally organized, this time under terms of universal suffrage (both men and women now had the vote), Duvalier, a black, painted himself as the legitimate heir to Estim\u00e9. This approach was enhanced by the fact that Duvalier's only viable opponent, [[Louis D\u00e9joie]], was a mulatto and the scion of a prominent family. Duvalier scored a decisive victory at the polls. His followers took two-thirds of the legislature's lower house and all of the seats in the Senate.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n==The Duvalier era (1957\u201386)==\n[[File:Duvalier (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier]] in 1968 ]]\n\n==='Papa Doc' (1957\u201371)===\nA former Minister of Health who had earned a reputation as a humanitarian while serving as an administrator in a U.S.-funded anti-[[yaws]] campaign, [[Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier]] (known as ''\"Papa Doc\"'') soon established another dictatorship. His regime is regarded as one of the most repressive and corrupt of modern times, combining violence against political opponents with exploitation of [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] to instill fear in the majority of the population. Duvalier's paramilitary police, officially the Volunteers for National Security (Volontaires de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Nationale \u2013 VSN) but more commonly known as the [[Tonton Macoute]]s, named for a Vodou monster, carried out political murders, beatings, and intimidation. An estimated 30,000 Haitians were killed by his government.<ref>{{citation |publisher=Country studies |place=US |url=http://countrystudies.us/haiti/17.htm |series=Haiti |title=Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier, 1957\u201371}}</ref> [[Sexual violence in Haiti|Duvalier employed rape]] as a political tool to silence political opposition.<ref>{{cite book |last=Girard |first=Philippe |title=Haiti: The Tumultuous History \u2013 From Pearl of the Caribbean to Broken Nation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L5KnihgGoIMC&pg=PA139 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |date=14 September 2010 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-230-11290-2 |ref=harv}}</ref> Incorporating many ''[[houngan]]s'' into the ranks of the Macoutes, his public recognition of Vodou and its practitioners and his private adherence to Vodou ritual, combined with his reputed private knowledge of magic and sorcery, enhanced his popular persona among the common people and served as a peculiar form of legitimization.\n\nDuvalier's policies, designed to end the dominance of the mulatto elite over the nation's economic and political life, led to massive emigration of educated people, deepening Haiti's economic and social problems. However, Duvalier appealed to the black middle class of which he was a member by introducing public works into middle-class neighborhoods that previously had been unable to have paved roads, running water, or modern sewage systems. In 1964, Duvalier proclaimed himself \"President for Life\".\n\nThe [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration suspended aid in 1961, after allegations that Duvalier had pocketed aid money and intended to use a [[Marine (military)|Marine Corps]] mission to strengthen the Macoutes. Duvalier also clashed with Dominican President [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] in 1963, after Bosch provided aid and asylum to Haitian exiles working to overthrow his regime. He ordered the Presidential Guard to occupy the Dominican chancery in [[P\u00e9tion-Ville]] to apprehend an officer involved in a plot to kidnap his children, leading Bosch to publicly threaten to invade Haiti. However, the Dominican army, which distrusted Bosch's leftist leanings, expressed little support for an invasion, and the dispute was settled by [[Organization of American States|OAS]] emissaries.\n\nIn 1971, Papa Doc entered into a 99-year contract with [[Don Pierson]] representing Dupont Caribbean Inc. of Texas for a [[free port]] project on the old [[buccaneer]] stronghold of [[Freeport Tortuga|Tortuga]] island located some {{convert|10|mi}} off the north coast of the main Haitian island of Hispaniola.\n\n==='Baby Doc' (1971\u201386)===\n[[File:Fleeing Duvaliers.jpg|thumb|Jean-Claude and Mich\u00e8le Duvalier en route to the airport to flee the country, 7 February 1986]]\n\nOn Duvalier's death in April 1971, power passed to his 19-year-old son [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]] (known as ''\"Baby Doc\"''). Under Jean-Claude Duvalier, Haiti's economic and political condition continued to decline, although some of the more fearsome elements of his father's regime were abolished. Foreign officials and observers also seemed more tolerant toward Baby Doc, in areas such as human-rights monitoring, and foreign countries were more generous to him with economic assistance. The United States restored its aid program in 1971. In 1974, Baby Doc expropriated the Freeport Tortuga project and this caused the venture to collapse. Content to leave administrative matters in the hands of his mother, Simone Ovid Duvalier, while living as a playboy, Jean-Claude enriched himself through a series of fraudulent schemes. Much of the Duvaliers' wealth, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars over the years, came from the R\u00e9gie du Tabac (Tobacco Administration), a tobacco monopoly established by Estim\u00e9, which expanded to include the proceeds from all government enterprises and served as a slush fund for which no balance sheets were ever kept.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://countrystudies.us/haiti/18.htm |publisher=Country studies |place=US |series=Haiti |title=Jean-Claude Duvalier, 1971\u201386}}</ref> His marriage, in 1980, to a beautiful mulatto divorc\u00e9e, [[Mich\u00e8le Bennett]], in a $3&nbsp;million ceremony, provoked widespread opposition, as it was seen as a betrayal of his father's antipathy towards the mulatto elite. At the request of Mich\u00e8le, Papa Doc's widow Simone was expelled from Haiti. Baby Doc's [[kleptocracy]] left the regime vulnerable to unanticipated crises, exacerbated by endemic poverty, most notably the epidemic of [[African swine fever virus]]\u2014which, at the insistence of [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] officials, led to the slaughter of the [[Creole Pig|creole pigs]], the principal source of income for most Haitians; and the widely publicized outbreak of AIDS in the early 1980s. Widespread discontent in Haiti began in 1983, when [[Pope John Paul II]] condemned the regime during a visit, finally provoking a rebellion, and in February 1986, after months of disorder, the army forced Duvalier to resign and go into exile.\n\n==The struggle for democracy (1986\u2013present day)==\n[[File:Fishing village in Haiti.jpg|thumb|Fishing village in Haiti, 1996]]\n[[File:Shopping streetin Haiti.jpg|thumb|Market street in Port-au-Prince, 1996]]\n\n===Transitional government (1986\u201390)===\nFrom 1986 to early 1988 Haiti was ruled by a provisional military government under General Namphy.

Various initiatives to end the political crisis through the peaceful restoration of the constitutionally elected government failed. In July 1994, as repression mounted in Haiti and a civilian human rights monitoring mission was expelled from the country, the United Nations Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 940]], which authorized member states to use all necessary means to facilitate the departure of Haiti's military leadership and to restore Haiti's constitutionally elected government to power.\n\n[[File:DD-SD-99-03743.jpg|thumb|President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returns triumphantly to the National Palace at Port-au-Prince, Haiti in 1994]]\n\n===The return of Aristide (1994\u201396)===\nIn mid-September 1994, with U.S. troops prepared to enter Haiti by force for [[Operation Uphold Democracy]], President [[Bill Clinton]] dispatched a negotiating team led by former President [[Jimmy Carter]] to persuade the authorities to step aside and allow for the return of constitutional rule. With intervening troops already airborne, C\u00e9dras and other top leaders agreed to step down. In October, Aristide was able to return. The [[Haitian general election, 1995]] in June 1995 saw Aristide's coalition, the Lavalas (Waterfall) Political Organization, gain a sweeping victory, and [[Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val]], a prominent Aristide political ally, elected President with 88% of the vote. When Aristide's term ended in February 1996, this was Haiti's first ever transition between two democratically elected presidents.\n\n===Preval's first Presidency (1996\u20132001)===\n[[File:U.S. Coast Guard intercepting Haitian refugees.GIF|thumb|U.S. Coast Guard intercepting Haitian refugees, 1998]]\n\n[[File:Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val on March 31, 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val]]]]\n\nIn late 1996, Aristide broke with Pr\u00e9val and formed a new political party, the Lavalas Family ([[Fanmi Lavalas]], FL), which won [[Haitian legislative election, 1997|elections in April 1997]] for one-third of the Senate and local assemblies, but these results were not accepted by the government. The split between Aristide and Pr\u00e9val produced a dangerous political deadlock, and the government was unable to organize the local and parliamentary elections due in late 1998. In January 1999, Pr\u00e9val dismissed legislators whose terms had expired \u2013 the entire Chamber of Deputies and all but nine members of the Senate, and Pr\u00e9val then ruled by decree.\n\n===Aristide's second presidency (2001\u201304)===\nIn May 2000 the [[Haitian legislative election, 2000]] for the Chamber of Deputies and two-thirds of the Senate took place. The election drew a voter turnout of more than 60%, and the FL won a virtual sweep. However, the elections were marred by controversy in the Senate race over the calculation of whether Senate candidates had achieved the majority required to avoid a run-off election (in Haiti, seats where no candidate wins an absolute majority of votes cast has to enter a second-round run-off election). The validity of the Electoral Council's post-ballot calculations of whether a majority had been attained was disputed. The [[Organization of American States]] complained about the calculation and declined to observe the July run-off elections. The opposition parties, regrouped in the Democratic Convergence ([[Convergence D\u00e9mocratique]], CD), demanded that the elections be annulled, and that Pr\u00e9val stand down and be replaced by a provisional government. In the meantime, the opposition announced it would boycott the [[Haitian presidential election, 2000|November presidential and senatorial elections]]. Haiti's main aid donors threatened to cut off aid. At the November 2000 elections, boycotted by the opposition, Aristide was again elected president, with more than 90% of the vote, on a turnout of around 50% according to international observers. The opposition refused to accept the result or to recognize Aristide as president.\n\nAllegations emerged of drug trafficking reaching into the upper echelons of government, as it had done under the military regimes of the 1980s and early 1990s ([[illegal drug trade in Haiti]]). Canadian police arrested Oriel Jean, Aristide's security chief and one of his most trusted friends, for money laundering.<ref>[http://www.sptimes.com/2004/04/03/Worldandnation/Taint_of_drugs_reachi.shtml Taint of drugs reaching Haiti's upper echelons]</ref> Beaudoin Ketant, a notorious international drug trafficker, Aristide's close partner, and his daughter's godfather, claimed that Aristide \"turned the country into a narco-country; it's a one-man show; you either pay (Aristide) or you die\".<ref>[[BBC]], 19 March 2004, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3524444.stm Haiti's drug money scourge]</ref>\n\nAristide spent years negotiating with the [[Convergence D\u00e9mocratique]] on new elections, but the Convergence's inability to develop a sufficient electoral base made elections unattractive, and it rejected every deal offered, preferring to call for a US invasion to topple Aristide.\n\n===The 2004 coup d'\u00e9tat===\n{{Main|2004 Haitian coup d'\u00e9tat}}\nAnti-Aristide protests in January 2004 led to violent clashes in Port-au-Prince, causing several deaths. In February, a revolt broke out in the city of [[Gona\u00efves]], which was soon under rebel control. The rebellion then began to spread, and Cap-Ha\u00eftien, Haiti's second-largest city, was captured. A mediation team of diplomats presented a plan to reduce Aristide's power while allowing him to remain in office until the end of his constitutional term. Although Aristide accepted the plan, it was rejected by the opposition, which mostly consisted of Haitian businessmen and former members of the army (who sought to reinstate the military following Aristide's disbandment of it).\n[[File:Port-au-Prince med.jpg|thumbnail|U.S. Marines patrol the streets of Port-au-Prince on 9 March 2004]]\nOn 29 February 2004, with rebel contingents marching towards Port-au-Prince, Aristide departed from Haiti. Aristide insists that he was essentially kidnapped by the U.S., while the U.S. [[United States Department of State|State Department]] maintains that he resigned from office. Aristide and his wife left Haiti on an American airplane, escorted by American diplomats and military personnel, and were flown directly to [[Bangui]], capital of the [[Central African Republic]], where he stayed for the following two weeks, before seeking [[right of asylum|asylum]] in a less remote location. This event was later characterized by Aristide as a kidnapping.\n\nThough this has never been proven, many observers in the press and academia believe that the US has not provided convincing answers to several of the more suspicious details surrounding the coup, such as the circumstances under which the US obtained Aristide's purported letter of \"resignation\" (as presented by the US) which, translated from [[Krey\u00f2l]], may not have actually read as a resignation.<ref name=\"Hallward2008\">{{cite web|url=http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/63/63-Resignation.pdf |title=Did he Jump or was he Pushed? |work=Press for Conversion! |year=2008 |pages=31\u201337 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630054053/http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/63/63-Resignation.pdf |archive-date=30 June 2013 |dead-url=no |first=Peter |last=Hallward |author-link=Peter Hallward |publisher=Coalition to Oppose the Arms Trade |location=Ottawa |issue=63 |format=PDF |issn=1183-8892 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAristide has accused the U.S. of deposing him in concert with the Haitian opposition.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/americas/03/01/aristide.claim/ |title=Aristide says U.S. deposed him in 'coup d'\u00e9tat' |publisher=CNN |date=2 March 2004 |accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> In a 2006 interview, he said the U.S. went back on their word regarding compromises he made with them over privatization of enterprises to ensure that part of the profits would go to the Haitian people and then \"relied on a disinformation campaign\" to discredit him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=55&ItemID=12166 |date=19 February 2007 |quote=Aristide's interview was conducted in French, in Pretoria, on 20 July 2006; originally published in London Review of Books |title=An Interview with Jean-Bertrand Aristide |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070222050105/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=55&ItemID=12166 |archivedate=2007-02-22 |accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nPolitical organizations and writers, as well as Aristide himself, have suggested that the rebellion was in fact a foreign controlled coup d'\u00e9tat.

Many criticized him for the slow progression of the reconstruction phase following the recent quake, or for taking credit for projects started in previous administrations. Some disliked him for his vulgar language and risque past which didn't seem to completely go away upon taking presidency. On the other hand, many believe that he was the most productive Haitian president since the Duvalier era.

Haiti's [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinate]]s are at a [[longitude]] of 72\u00b0 25&prime; west and a [[latitude]] of 19\u00b0 00&prime; north.\n\nHaiti's total area is {{convert|27750|km2|0}}, of which {{convert|27560|km2|0}} is land and {{convert|190|km2|0}} is water.  Haiti has {{convert|1771|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of [[coastline]] and a {{convert|360|km|0}}-border with the Dominican Republic.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Haiti K\u00f6ppen.svg|left|thumb|280px|K\u00f6ppen climate types of Haiti]]\nThe climate is tropical with some variation depending on altitude. Port-au-Prince ranges in January from an average minimum of {{convert|23|\u00b0C|1}} to an average maximum of {{convert|31|\u00b0C|1}}; in July, from {{convert|25|\u2013|35|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. The rainfall pattern is varied, with rain heavier in some of the lowlands and on the northern and eastern slopes of the mountains.\n\nPort-au-Prince receives an average annual rainfall of {{convert|1370|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. There are two rainy seasons, April\u2013June and October\u2013November. Haiti is subject to periodic droughts and floods, made more severe by deforestation. Hurricanes are also a menace.\n\n==Physical geography==\nHaiti's terrain varies, with more than 3/4ths of the territory above {{convert|700|ft|m}}. Its climate is predominantly [[tropical]], with some smaller areas of [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], [[subtropical climate|subtropical]], and [[oceanic climate]]. Fertile valleys are interspersed between the mountain ranges forming vast areas of contrast between elevations in many areas throughout the territory. Haiti (and Hispaniola) are separated from [[Cuba]] by way of the [[Windward Passage]], a {{convert|45|nmi|km mi|0|abbr=on|lk=in}} wide strait that passes between the two countries.\n\nHaiti's lowest elevation is reported by one source to be [[sea level]] (the [[Caribbean Sea]]<ref>CIA factbook</ref>), by another source to be below sea level (Gheskio clinic, [[Port-au-Prince]]<ref>Wall Street Journal, Feb 20-21, 2010</ref> or in [[Gona\u00efves]], <-1m<ref>Several sources, such as http://www.france24.com/en/20080911-disaster-aftermath-hurrican-ike-hanna-gonaives-haiti</ref>), while its highest point is [[Pic la Selle]] at {{convert|2680|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n* Haiti's most important valley in terms of crops is the ''Plaine de l'Artibonite'', which is oriented south of the ''[[Montagnes Noires, Haiti|Montagnes Noires]]''. This region supports the country's (also Ile d'Haiti's) longest river, the ''[[Artibonite River|Riviere l'Artibonite]]'' whose watershed begins in the western region of the Dominican Republic and continues most of its length through central Haiti and onward where it empties into the ''[[Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve]]''. The river is navigable for a distance by barge. The eastern and central region of the island is a large elevated plateau.\n* The northern region consists of the ''Massif du Nord'' (Northern Massif) and the ''Plaine du Nord'' (Northern Plain). The Massif du Nord is an extension of the ''Cordillera Central'' in the Dominican Republic. It begins at Haiti's eastern border, north of the ''Guayamouc River'', and extends to the northwest through the northern peninsula. The ''Plateau Central'' (Central Plateau) extends along both sides of the Guayamouc River, south of the Massif du Nord. It runs from the southeast to the northwest. To the southwest of the Plateau Central are the Montagnes Noires, whose most northwestern part merges with the Massif du Nord.\n* The southern region consists of the ''[[Plaine du Cul-de-Sac]]'' (the southeast) and the mountainous southern peninsula (also known as the [[Tiburon Peninsula, Haiti|Tiburon Peninsula]]).  The Plaine du Cul-de-Sac is a natural depression which harbors the country's saline lakes, such as ''[[Trou Ca\u00efman]]'' and Haiti's largest lake [[Etang Saumatre|Lac Azuei]] (also known as [[Etang Saumatre]]).  The Cha\u00eene de la Selle mountain range, an extension of the southern mountain chain of the Dominican Republic (the ''Sierra de Baoruco''), extends from the Massif de la Selle in the east to the ''[[Massif de la Hotte]]'' in the west. This mountain range harbors ''[[Pic la Selle]]'', the highest point in Haiti at 2,680 metres (8,793&nbsp;ft).\n\n==Islands==\n{{Further|List of islands of Haiti}}\n\nNumerous smaller islands make up a part of Haiti's total territory. The most notable islands are:\n#''[[Gon\u00e2ve Island|\u00cele de la Gon\u00e2ve]]'', the largest offshore island of mainland Hispaniola, is located to the west-northwest of [[Port-au-Prince]] in Haiti's [[Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve]], in the [[Caribbean Sea]] (the largest gulf of the [[Antilles]]). It has an area of 743&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Its [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] name was ''Guanabo''.  La Gon\u00e2ve was once a pirate base.\n#''[[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]]'' (''Turtle''), the second largest offshore island of the mainland, located off the northwest coast of Hispaniola, it is a [[Caribbean]] island. It has an area of 180&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The island was a major center of [[Piracy in the Caribbean|Caribbean piracy]] during the 17th century and has become famous in many works of literature and film. The island's name derives from the turtle-like shape of the island.\n#''[[\u00cele \u00e0 Vache]]'' (''Cow Island'') is a small and lush island located off southwestern de l'Ile d'Haiti with a total area is 52&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.\n#''[[Cayemites|Les Cayemites]]'', a pair of islands located in the Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve off the coast of southwest Hispaniola. It has a combined area of 45&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.\n#''[[Navassa Island|La Navasse]]'', is a rocky outcropping that has been subject to an ongoing territorial dispute with the United States. The island is located {{convert|40|nmi|mi km}} west of [[J\u00e9r\u00e9mie]] on the south west [[peninsula]] of Haiti,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/haiti/rock.htm |title=Whose Rock Is It?

The largest lake in Haiti, and the second largest lake of Ile d'Haiti and the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], is ''[[Etang Saumatre|Lake Azuei]]''. It is located in the ''Cul-de-Sac Depression'' with an area of 170&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. It is a [[saline lake]] with a higher concentration of salt than the sea water and harbors numerous [[fauna]] such as [[American crocodile]]s and [[American flamingo]]s.\n\n[[Lake P\u00e9ligre]] is an artificial lake created by the construction of the [[Peligre Hydroelectric Dam]].\n\n''[[Trou Ca\u00efman]]'' is a saltwater lake with a total area of 16.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

To repay the spirits, children perform two ceremonies where the ''Loua'' are given gifts like food and drinks. That does depend of the monetary status of these families, poorer families wait until there is a need to perform the rituals. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/haiti/33.htm|title=Haiti - RELIGION|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=2018-03-27}}</ref>\n\nVoodoo in relation to Christianity came along two different paths, the path with the Catholics and the path with the protestants. For the Catholic path; under the French the slaves were not allowed to practice [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]], but they were allowed to occasionally have dances on the weekend. These dances turned out to be Voodoo services, until they were liberated in 1804. Most Haitians see practicing Voodoo and Christianity as normal due to the many components they share. The catholic church wasn't always as accepting of Voodoo as it is now, in 1941-1942 a [[Religious war|holy war]] was waged against Voodoo killing many of the higher ups in the Voodoo religion. This war ended around 1950 when the Catholics decided give up the prosecution of those who practiced Voodoo and to have a relative peace. The path with the protestants was less peaceful. The Protestants came to Haiti in 1970 and since then they have been bitter enemies of Voodoo, most often calling it [[Theistic Satanism|devil worship]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.webster.edu/corbetre/haiti/voodoo/overview.htm|title=Haiti: Introduction to Voodoo|website=faculty.webster.edu|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n{{main article|Education in Haiti}}\nAlthough [[public education]] at the primary level is now free, [[Private school|private]] and [[Parochial school|parochial]] schools provide around 75% of educational programs offered.\n\nIn recent years, several annual literacy campaigns launched in by the Martelly administration has increased overall literacy among adults in Haiti.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-12003-haiti-social-the-fight-against-illiteracy-one-of-the-government-s-priorities.htm |title=Haiti \u2013 Social : The fight against illiteracy, one of the Government's priorities|website=Haitilibre.com|date=September 9, 2014}}</ref> [[UNESCO]] projects an overall literacy rate of 61.1% in Haiti by 2015.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/literacy-statistics-trends-1985-2015.pdf|title= \"Literacy Statistics trends 1985\u20132015\"|format=PDF|website=Uis.unesco.org|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>\nAs of December 2014, [[World bank]] has reported that school enrollment has increased from 78% to 90% in Haiti, very close to the goal of universal child enrollment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/12/11/haiti-the-day-that-the-news-were-good |title=Extreme poverty drops in Haiti.

Scholars have since referred to [[Haitian Creole]], the other language of Haiti as linguistically inferior. Creole grammar is said to be simplified and lacking sophistication compared to its European ancestors. This original demotion of the language created a subordinate sociopolitical, economic, and biological status for the country's majority that had been relocated by slavery.<ref>Piere-Michel Fontaine. \"Language and Society Development: Dialectic of French and Creole Use in Haiti,\" Latin American Perspectives 8(1981):28-46.</ref>\n\nToday, Creole is spoken by 90-95% of the country. The remaining are bilingual and speak both French and Creole. Per the 1987 Constitution, both Creole and French are official languages of Haiti.<ref>DeGraff, Michel. \"Against Creole Exceptionalism,\" Linguistic Society of America 79 (2003): 391-410.</ref> However, French is still the main language taught in schools and used in politics. With only 2-5% speaking the language of the politics, Creole speakers are politically disenfranchised. Haitian Creole and French are mutually unintelligible, so the vast majority of citizens cannot communicate with leaders in the language of their choice.<ref>DeGraff, Michel. \"Linguist's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Creole Exceptionalism,\" Language in Society 34(2005):533-591</ref>\n\nThis disenfranchisement is further aggravated by the lack of a systematic educational system. Literacy programs failed in the 1980s, and French is still the language being used to instruct students.<ref>Hebblethwaite, Benjamin. \"French and Underdevelopment, Haitian Creole and Development: Educational Language Policy Problems and Solutions in Haiti,\" Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages 27(2012)255-302.</ref> Haitian linguist, Yves Dejean, recalls warnings posted in the principal's office forbidding the use of Creole.  In the 1970s, only one percent of the children who entered kindergarten stayed on track to obtain state certificate at the end of the sixth grade.<ref>Dejean, Yves. \"An Overview of the Language Situation in Haiti,\" International Journal of Sociology of Language 102(2009): 73-83.</ref>\nEven after the literacy programs of the 1980s, 90% of the teachers ten years after the decree were still not able to fully integrate the Creole language into the education system. The language handicap makes education and furthermore, political enfranchisement almost impossible.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Government of Haiti]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Haiti topics}}\n{{Americas topic|Politics of}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Politics Of Haiti}}\n[[Category:Politics of Haiti| ]]", "sha1": "o1o64nt83x362rxu3rtli0izvyg1n6z"}}, {"title": "Economy of Haiti", "ns": "0", "id": "13378", "revision": {"id": "864867093", "parentid": "864483106", "timestamp": "2018-10-20T01:15:32Z", "contributor": {"username": "Obisteez", "id": "34935014"}, "comment": "I specified the inflation description and updated the figures accordingly.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "<!--{{Unbalanced}} begin-->{{Ambox\n| name =  Unbalanced\n| class = ambox-unbalanced\n| type  = content\n| subst = <includeonly>{{subst:substcheck}}</includeonly>\n| image = [[File:Unbalanced scales.svg|50x40px|link=]]\n| issue = This {{{1|article}}} '''may be [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view#Undue weight|unbalanced]] towards certain viewpoints'''.\n| fix   = Please [{{SERVER}}{{localurl:{{PAGENAME}}|action=edit}} improve the article] by adding information on neglected viewpoints, or discuss the issue on the [[:{{NAMESPACE}} talk:{{PAGENAME}}|talk page]].\n| date  = {{{date|August 2018}}} \n| cat   = Articles needing more viewpoints\n}}<!--{{Unbalanced}} end-->\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox economy\n|country         = Haiti\n|image           =Port_au_prince-haiti.JPG\n|image_size     = 280px \n|caption         =[[Port-au-Prince]], the [[financial centre]] of Haiti\n|currency        = [[Haitian gourde]] (HTG) \n|organs          = [[Bank of the Republic of Haiti]] <br> [[WTO]] [[CARICOM]]\n|year            = 1 October \u2013 30 September\n|organizations   = [[Caribbean Community]]<br>[[World Trade Organization]]\n|gdp rank        = 149th [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|by volume (at PPP)]] ({{As of|2017|alt=2017}}); 213th by [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|per capita (at PPP)]] ({{As of|2017|alt=2017}})\n|gdp             = $19.93 billion (2017 est.

One very significant economic obstacle in Haiti's early independence was its necessary payment of [[External debt of Haiti|150 million francs to France]] beginning in 1825; this did much to drain the country of its capital stock. \nAccording to a 2014 study, the Haitian economy stagnated due to a combination of weak state power and adverse international relations<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Frankema|first=Ewout|last2=Mas\u00e9|first2=Aline|date=2014-01-01|title=An Island Drifting Apart.

The authors write<ref name=\":0\" />:<blockquote>For the newborn \u2018Negro republic\u2019, it was hard to become recognised as a sovereign nation state, it was difficult to form strategic alliances, to get access to foreign loans, and to safeguard trade interests, and it was overloaded with debt under threat of external violence (the French indemnity). Self-chosen isolation, for instance by prohibiting foreign landownership, further reduced the choice set of successive Haitian administrations. When opportunities for export-led growth opened up in the late 19th century, the odds were stacked against Haiti.</blockquote>Under President [[Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val]] (President from 1996 to 2001 and from 2006 until 14 May 2011), the country's economic agenda included trade and tariff liberalization, measures to control government expenditure and increase tax revenues, civil-service downsizing, financial-sector reform, and the modernization of state-owned enterprises through their sale to private investors, the provision of private sector management contracts, or joint public-private investment. Structural adjustment agreements with the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[World Bank]], [[Inter-American Development Bank]], and other international financial institutions aiming at creating necessary conditions for private sector growth, have proved only partly successful.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1994 restoration of constitutional governance, Haitian officials have indicated their commitment to economic reform through the implementation of sound fiscal and monetary policies and the enactment of legislation mandating the modernization of state-owned enterprises. A council to guide the modernization program (CMEP) was established and a timetable was drawn up to modernize nine key [[parastatal]]s. Although the state-owned flour-mill and cement plants have been transferred to private owners, progress on the other seven parastatals has stalled. The modernization of Haiti's state-enterprises remains a controversial political issue in Haiti.\n\nComparative social and economic indicators show Haiti falling behind other low-income developing countries (particularly in the Western hemisphere) since the 1980s. Haiti's economic stagnation results from earlier{{When|date=November 2010}} inappropriate economic policies, political instability, a shortage of good arable land, environmental deterioration, continued use of traditional technologies, under-capitalization and lack of public investment in human resources, migration of large portions of the skilled population, and a weak national savings rate.\n\nHaiti continues to suffer the consequences of the [[1991 Haitian coup d'\u00e9tat|1991 coup]]. The irresponsible economic and financial policies of ''de facto'' authorities greatly{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} accelerated Haiti's economic decline. Following the coup, the United States adopted mandatory sanctions, and the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] instituted voluntary sanctions aimed at restoring constitutional [[Forms of government|government]]. International sanctions culminated in the May 1994 [[United Nations]] embargo of all goods entering Haiti except humanitarian supplies, such as food and medicine. The assembly sector, heavily dependent on U.S. markets for its products, employed nearly 80,000 workers in the mid-1980s. During the embargo, employment fell from 33,000 workers in 1991 to 400 in October 1994. Private, domestic and foreign investment has been slow to return to Haiti. Since the return of constitutional rule, assembly sector employment has gradually recovered with over 20,000 now employed, but further growth has been stalled by investor concerns over safety and supply reliability.\n\nIf the political situation stabilizes, high crime levels wane, and new investment increases, tourism could take its place next to export-oriented manufacturing (the assembly sector) as a potential source of foreign exchange.{{Original research inline|date=November 2010}} [[Remittances]] from abroad have consistently constituted a significant source of financial support for many Haitian households.\n\nThe Haitian Ministry of Economy and Finance designed{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} the [[Haiti economic reforms of 1996]] to rebuild the economy of Haiti after significant downturns suffered in the previous years. The primary reforms centered around the [[Emergency Economic Recovery Plan]] (EERP) and were followed by [[budget]] reforms.\n\nHaiti's real [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth turned negative in FY 2001 after six years of growth. Real GDP fell by 1.1% in FY 2001 and 0.9% in FY 2002. Macroeconomic stability was adversely affected by political uncertainty, the collapse of informal [[bank]]ing cooperatives, high [[budget deficit]]s, low investment, and reduced international capital flows, including suspension of IFI lending as Haiti fell into arrears with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and World Bank.\n\nHaiti's economy stabilized in 2003. Although FY 2003 began with the rapid decline of the gourde due to rumors that [[U.S. dollar]] deposit accounts would be nationalized and due to the withdrawal of fuel subsidies, the government successfully stabilized the gourde as it took the politically difficult decisions to float fuel prices freely according to world market prices and to raise interest rates. Government agreement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) on a staff monitored program (SMP), followed by its payment of its $32 million arrears to the IDB in July, paved the way for renewed IDB lending. The IDB disbursed $35 million of a $50 million policy-based loan in July and began disbursing four previously approved project loans totaling $146 million. The IDB, IMF, and [[World Bank]] also discussed new lending with the government. Much of this would be contingent on government adherence to fiscal and monetary targets and policy reforms, such as those begun under the SMP, and Haiti's payment of its World Bank arrears ($30 million at 9/30/03).\n\nThe IMF estimated that real GDP was flat in FY 2003 and projected 1% real GDP growth for FY 2004. However, [[GDP per capita]]\u2014 amounting to $425 in FY 2002 \u2014 will continue to decline{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} as population growth is estimated at 1.3% p.a. While implementation of governance reforms and peaceful resolution of the political stalemate are key to long-term growth,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} external support remains critical in avoiding economic collapse. The major element is foreign remittances, reported as $931 million in 2002, primarily from the U.S. Foreign assistance, meanwhile, was $130 million in FY 2002. Overall foreign assistance levels have declined since FY 1995, the year elected government was restored to power under a [[United Nations]] mandate, when the [[international community]] provided over $600 million in aid.\n\nA legal minimum wage of 36 gourdes a day (about U.S. $1.80) was set{{By whom|date=November 2010}} in 1995, and applies to most workers in the formal sector. It was later raised to 70 gourdes per day.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Actually this minimum is 200 gourdes a day(about U.S. $4.80). 39.175 gourds= a U.S dollar.\n\nHaiti's economy suffered a severe setback in January 2010 when a 7.0 magnitude earthquake destroyed much of its capital city, Port-au-Prince, and neighboring areas. Already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with 80% of the population living under the poverty line and 54% in abject poverty, the earthquake inflicted $7.8 billion in damage and caused the country's GDP to contract 5.4% in 2010. Following the earthquake, Haiti received $4.59 billion in international pledges for reconstruction, which has proceeded slowly.<ref name = \"CIA\" />\n[[File:Gioviboy00 wikipedia.svg|alt=Chart showing the history of Haiti's GDP.|thumb|Chart showing the history of Haiti's GDP.]]\nUS economic engagement under the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act, passed in December 2006, has boosted apparel exports and investment by providing duty-free access to the US. Congress voted in 2010 to extend the legislation until 2020 under the HELP Act; the apparel sector accounts for about 90% of Haitian exports and nearly one-tenth of GDP. Remittances are the primary source of foreign exchange, equaling nearly 20% of GDP and more than twice the earnings from exports. Haiti suffers from a lack of investment, partly because of limited infrastructure and a lack of security. In 2005, Haiti paid its arrears to the World Bank, paving the way for reengagement with the Bank. Haiti received debt forgiveness for over $1 billion through the Highly-Indebted Poor Country initiative in mid-2009. The remainder of its outstanding external debt was cancelled by donor countries following the 2010 earthquake but has since risen to over $600 million. The government relies on formal international economic assistance for fiscal sustainability, with over half of its annual budget coming from outside sources. The [[Michel Martelly]] administration in 2011 launched a campaign aimed at drawing foreign investment into Haiti as a means for sustainable development.<ref name = \"CIA\" />\n\n==Debt cancellation==\nIn 2005 Haiti's total external debt reached an estimated US$1.3 billion, which corresponds to [[List of countries by external debt|debt per capita]] of US$169, in contrast to the debt per capita of the United States which is US$40,000.<ref>http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_deb_ext_percap-economy-debt-external-per-capita</ref> Following the democratic election of Aristide in December 1990, many international creditors responded by cancelling significant amounts of Haiti's debt, bringing the total down to US$777 million in 1991. However, new borrowing during the 1990s swelled the debt to more than US$1 billion.\n\nAt peak, [[External debt of Haiti|Haiti's total external debt]] was estimated at 1.8 billion dollars, including half a billion dollars to the Inter-American Development Bank, Haiti's largest creditor. In September 2009, Haiti met the conditions set out by the IMF and World Bank's [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] program, qualifying it for cancellation of some of its external debt. This amounted to a cancellation of $1.2 billion. Despite this as of 2010 calls for cancellation of its remaining $1 billion debts came strongly from civil society groups such as the [[Jubilee Debt Campaign]] in reaction to the effects of the [[Haiti 2010 earthquake|earthquake]] that hit the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jubileedebtcampaign.org.uk/Haiti+3113.twl |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120065057/http://www.jubileedebtcampaign.org.uk/Haiti+3113.twl |archivedate=20 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Primary Industries==\n[[File:Haiti Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|Haiti Export Treemap]]\n[[primary sector of the economy|Primary industries]] include the following:\n\n===Agriculture, forestry, and fishing===\n{{See also|Agriculture in Haiti}}\nAlthough many Haitians make their living through subsistence farming, Haiti also has an agricultural export sector. Agriculture, together with forestry and fishing, accounts for about one-quarter (28% in 2004) of Haiti's annual gross domestic product and employs about two-thirds (66% in 2004) of the labor force. However, expansion has been difficult because mountains cover much of the countryside and limit the land available for cultivation. Of the total arable land of 550,000 hectares, 125,000 hectares are suited for irrigation, and of those only 75,000 hectares actually have been improved with irrigation. Haiti's dominant cash crops include coffee, mangoes, and cocoa. Haiti has decreased its production of sugarcane, traditionally an important cash crop, because of declining prices and fierce international competition. Because Haiti's forests have thinned dramatically, timber exports have declined. Roundwood removals annually total about 1,000 kilograms. Haiti also has a small fishing industry. Annual catches in recent years have totaled about 5,000 tons\n\n===Mining and minerals ===\nHaiti has a mining industry which extracted minerals worth approximately US$13 million in 2013. Bauxite, copper, calcium carbonate, gold, and marble<ref>{{cite web|title=Haiti marble blocks for export|url=http://www.export-forum.com/more/americas/4355-haiti-marble.html|accessdate=1 June 2012|quote=Haiti black marble portoro type}}</ref> were the most extensively extracted minerals in Haiti. Lime and aggregates and to a lesser extent marble are extracted. Gold was mined by the Spanish in early colonial times. Bauxite was mined for a number of years in recent times at a site near [[Mirago\u00e2ne]] on the Southern peninsula. Operating from 1960 to 1972 International Halliwell Mines, Ltd. (\"Halliwell\"), a Canadian corporation, through its wholly owned Haitian subsidiary, La Societe d'Exploitation et de Developpement Economique et Natural d'Haiti (\"Sedren\")<ref name=OJO>{{cite web|title=544 F. 2d 105 - International Halliwell Mines Limited v.

The copper ore was valued at about $83.5 million. The government of Haiti received about $3 million.<ref name=GRW /> As of 2012 there was promise of gold and copper mining in northern Haiti.<ref name=ReganGuardian />\n\n====Gold====\nIn 2012, it was reported that confidential agreements and negotiations had been entered into by the Haitian government granting licenses for exploration or mining of gold and associated metals such as copper for over {{convert|1000|mi2}} in the mineralized zone stretching from east to west across northern Haiti. Estimates for the value of the gold which might be extracted through [[open-pit mining]] are as high as US$20 billion. Eurasian Minerals and [[Newmont Mining Corporation]] are two of the firms involved. According to Alex Dupuy, Chair of African American Studies and John E.

Growth in both manufacturing and industry as a whole has been slowed by a lack of capital investment. Grants from the United States and other countries have targeted this problem, but without much success. Private home building and construction appear to be one subsector with positive prospects for growth.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn 2004 industry accounted for about 20 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), and less than 10 percent of the labor force worked in industrial production. As a portion of the GDP, the manufacturing sector has contracted since the 1980s. The United Nations embargo of 1994 put out of work most of the 80,000 workers in the assembly sector. Additionally, the years of military rule following the presidential coup in 1991 resulted in the closure of most of Haiti's offshore assembly plants in the free zones surrounding Port-au-Prince. When President Aristide returned to Haiti, some improvements did occur in the manufacturing sector.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nHaiti's cheaper labor brought some textile and garment assembly work back to the island in the late 1990s. Although these gains were undercut by international competition, the apparel sector in 2008 made up two-thirds<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=acLZCbL2jFvI&pos=8 Bloomberg.com]</ref> of Haiti's annual 490 million US dollars exports.<ref>[http://www.indexmundi.com/haiti/exports.html Index Mundi: Haiti exports 2008]</ref> USA economic engagement under the HOPE Act, from December 2006, increased apparel exports and investment by providing tariff-free access to the USA. HOPE II, in October 2008, further improved the situation by extending preferences to 2018.\n\n===Energy===\n{{See also|Electricity sector in Haiti}}\nHaiti uses very little energy, the equivalent of approximately 250 kilograms of oil per head per year. In 2003, Haiti produced 546 million kilowatt-hours of electricity while consuming 508 million kilowatt-hours. In 2013, it stood 135th out of 135 countries in net total consumption of electricity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/EG.USE.ELEC.KH/rankings |title=Electric power consumption (kWh) - Country Ranking |accessdate=12 July 2014 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=12 July 2014 |year= |month= |work=  |publisher=Index Mundi |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027022110/http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/EG.USE.ELEC.KH/rankings|archivedate=2012-10-27|dead-url=yes |quote= }}</ref>\n\nMost of the country's energy comes from the burning of wood. Haiti imports oil,  consuming about {{convert|11800|oilbbl/d}}, as of 2003. The P\u00e9ligre Dam, the country's largest, provides the capital city of Port-au-Prince with energy. Thermal plants provide electricity to the rest of the country. Even with the country's low level of demand for energy, the supply of electricity traditionally has been sporadic and prone to shortages. Mismanagement by the state has offset more than US$100 million in foreign investment targeted at improving Haiti's energy infrastructure. Businesses have resorted to securing back-up power sources to deal with the regular outages. The potential for greater hydropower exists, should Haiti have the desire and means to develop it. The government controls oil and gas prices, to an extent insulating Haitians from international price fluctuations.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Tertiary Industries==\n[[tertiary sector of the economy|Tertiary industries]] include the following:\n\n===Services===\nHaiti's services sector made up 52 percent of the country's gross domestic product in 2004 and employed 25 percent of the labor force. According to World Bank statistics, the services sector is one of the few sectors of Haiti's economy that sustained steady, if modest, growth throughout the 1990s.\n\n===Banking and finance===\nLack of a stable and trustworthy banking system has impeded Haiti's economic development. Banks in Haiti have collapsed on a regular basis. Most Haitians do not have access to loans of any sort. When reelected in 2000, President Aristide promised to remedy this situation but instead introduced a non-sustainable plan of \"cooperatives\" that guaranteed investors a 10 percent rate of return. By 2000, the cooperatives had crumbled and Haitians had collectively lost more than US$200 million in savings.\n\nHaiti's central bank, the [[Bank of the Republic of Haiti]], oversees 10 commercial banks and two foreign banks operating in the country. Most banking takes place in the capital city of Port-au-Prince. The United Nations and the International Monetary Fund have led efforts to diversify and expand the finance sector, making credit more available to rural populations. In 2002, the Canadian International Development Agency led a training program for Haitian Credit Unions. Haiti has no stock exchange.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Haiti}}\nTourism in Haiti has suffered from the country's political upheaval. Inadequate infrastructure also has limited visitors to the island. In the 1970s and 1980s, however, tourism was an important industry, drawing an average of 150,000 visitors annually. Since the 1991 coup, tourism has recovered slowly. The [[Caribbean Tourism Organization]] (CTO) has joined the Haitian government in an effort to restore the island's image as a tourist destination. In 2001, 141,000 foreigners visited Haiti. Most came from the United States. To make tourism a major industry for Haiti, further improvements in hotels, restaurants and other infrastructure still are needed.\n\n== Macro-Economic ==\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=33&pr.y=14&sy=1980&ey=2023&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=263&s=NGDP_RPCH,PPPGDP,PPPPC,PCPIPCH,GGXWDG_NGDP&grp=0&a=|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-09-07|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=en-US|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Year\n!1980\n!1985\n!1990\n!1995\n!2000\n!2005\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n|-\n|GDP in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|6.39 Bln.\n|8.05 Bln.\n|9.29 Bln.\n|9.58 Bln.\n|11.79 Bln.\n|12.88 Bln.\n|13.58 Bln.\n|14.41 Bln.\n|14.81 Bln.\n|15.38 Bln.\n|14.72 Bln.\n|15.85 Bln.\n|16.61 Bln.\n|17.59 Bln.\n|18.41 Bln.\n|18.83 Bln.\n|19.35 Bln.\n|19.93 Bln.\n|-\n|GDP per capita in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|1,077\n|1,241\n|1,310\n|1,224\n|1,378\n|1,391\n|1,443\n|1,507\n|1,526\n|1,561\n|1,471\n|1,562\n|1,614\n|1,686\n|1,741\n|1,758\n|1,783\n|1,814\n|-\n|GDP growth<br /><small>(real)</small>\n|7.3 %\n|0.8 %\n|\u22120.4 %\n|9.9 %\n|0.9 %\n|1.8 %\n|2.2 %\n|3.3 %\n|0.8 %\n|0.9 %\n|\u22125.5 %\n|5.5 %\n|2.9 %\n|4.2 %\n|2.8 %\n|1.2 %\n|1.5 %\n|1.2 %\n|-\n|Inflation<br /><small>(consumer prices)</small>\n|17.78 %\n|10.65 %\n|21.28 %\n|27.61 %\n|13.71 %\n|15.73 %\n|13.07 %\n|8.52 %\n|15.52 %\n| -0.02 %\n|5.7 %\n|8.4 %\n|6.29 %\n|5.85 %\n|4.57 %\n|9.02 %\n|13.83 %\n|14.67 %\n|-\n|Government debt<br /><small>(Percentage of GDP)</small>\n|...\n|...\n|...\n|...\n|55 %\n|47 %\n|39 %\n|35 %\n|38 %\n|28 %\n|17 %\n|12 %\n|16 %\n|21 %\n|26 %\n|30 %\n|34 %\n|32 %\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Haitian companies]]\n* [[List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP (nominal)]]\n* [[List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP (PPP)]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\nMuch of this article is based on [[public domain]] material from the U.S. government.

The hub of the road network is located at the old airport (at the intersection of Boulevard Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Autoroute de Delmas). From this intersection, Route Nationale #1 and Route Nationale #2 commence.\n\n* '''Route Nationale #1''' (RN1) heads north, passing through [[Saint-Marc]] and [[Gona\u00efves]] to its terminus at Rue 22 in [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]].\n* '''Route Nationale #2''' (RN2) is commonly known as \u201cBoulevard Jean-Jacques Dessalines\u201d  within Port-au-Prince and as \u201cRoute du Sud\u201d outside the capital region.  After heading south through downtown Port-au-Prince, it travels west through the capital\u2019s western boroughs and then through [[Petit-Go\u00e2ve]] and [[Aquin]] to its terminus at Avenue des Quatre Chemins in [[Les Cayes]]. (However, its \u201cextension\u201d continues southwest almost to the sea south of [[Port-Salut|Port Salut]].)\n* '''Route Nationale #3''' (RN3) begins where RN1 heads northwest from [[Bon Repos]], not far north of the road network\u2019s hub.  RN3 travels northeast, traversing the Plateau Centrale via [[Mirebalais]] and [[Hinche]] before finally re-joining RN1 in Cap-Ha\u00eftien.\n* '''Route Nationale #4''' (RN4) branches off from RN2 at Carrefour du Fort L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, not far south of [[L\u00e9og\u00e2ne]].  Commonly known as \u201cRoute de l\u2019Amiti\u00e9\u201d, RN4 climbs and descends the [[Cha\u00eene de la Selle]] mountain range on its meandering southward course to its terminus in the centre of [[Jacmel]].\n* '''Route Nationale #5''' (RN5) breaks off from RN1 on the northeast edge of Gona\u00efves, heading north and then northwest through [[Gros-Morne, Haiti|Gros Morne]] before terminating near the airport outside [[Port-de-Paix]].\n* '''Route Nationale #6''' (RN6) branches off from RN3 just as it is about to enter Cap-Ha\u00eftien from the south. RN6 heads southeast toward the [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] border through [[Terrier Rouge]] en route to [[Ouanaminthe]].  Its terminus is the bridge over the [[Massacre River (Dominican Republic)|Massacre River]].\n* '''Route Nationale #7''' (RN7) commences from the aforementioned Avenue des Quatre Chemins in Les Cayes, going northwest across Haiti\u2019s southern arm to the outskirts of [[J\u00e9r\u00e9mie]].\n* '''Route Nationale #8''' (RN8) is by far the shortest of the National Roads.  It breaks off RN1 at Carrefour Shada in [[Croix-des-Missions]].  Heading east, it passes through [[Croix-des-Bouquets]], skirts the southern shore of [[\u00c9tang Saum\u00e2tre]], and terminates at the [[Malpasse]] border crossing with the Dominican Republic.\n\nMaintenance for RN1 and RN2 lapsed after the 1991 coup, prompting the World Bank to loan US$50 million that was designated for road repairs. The project was cancelled in January 1999. The World Bank, who reasoned that the cancellation of those projects would ruin Haiti's road infrastructure progress created the FER (Fond d\u2019Etretient Routiers) in 2003. This was a way to cut down corruption, get local companies involved, and in restraining any stopping of these projects because of political instability or protests. President Rene Preval, on his campaign for his second term, vowed on his Maillages Routiers to rebuild the majority of these roads that had disintegrated rapidly and build new ones that would enable the country to move forward. When he wasn't able to get the funds from the World Bank, he pleaded to the international donors for assistance, which was heavily criticized by many politicians in the media, but was greatly embraced by a population desperate to see road infrastructure development come to their towns. Therefore, the European Union pledged to help build RN6, then RN3. In the meantime, the World Bank loaned Haiti US$200 Million to rebuild RN2, from River Froide, which is the starting point of RN2, all the way to Aquin and repair RN1 from Titanyen to Cap-Ha\u00eftien. The hurricane season of 2008 was a major setback in development, since many bridges in multiple areas had either collapse or suffered extensive damage and was in immediate need of repair. Most of those work on RN1 and RN2, that were already halted, suffered a major setback during the earthquake of January 12, 2010. For the construction of RN7, Canada pledged US$75 million and the IDB US$31 million for the construction of RN7, which started in 2009. It, too, suffered major setbacks because of the January 12 earthquake.\n\n===Statistics===\n* Total highways: 6,045&nbsp;km\n* Paved highways: 2,971&nbsp;km\n* Unpaved highways: 3,071&nbsp;km (2011 est\n\n===Public transportation===\nThe public transportation is mostly privately owned in Haiti, previously it was an individual business, with the new generation of entrepreneurs, it is mainly association. The most common form of public transportation in Haiti is the use of brightly painted pickup trucks as taxis called [[Tap tap|\"tap-taps\"]]. They are named this because when a passenger needs to be let off they use their coin money to tap the side of the vehicle and the driver usually stops. Most tap-taps are fairly priced at around 10-15 gourdes per ride within a city. The catch to the price is that the driver will often fill a truck to maximum capacity, which is nearly 20-30 people. The Government in an effort to structure the public transportation has attempted several time to bring BUS, in around 1979, It was the BUS called CONATRA a contract between the government and association of driver which quickly failed because of sabotage from different factor and poor maintenance. In 1998 another attempt was made with the Service Plus and Dignite for student and teacher. Sabotage, poor maintenance and the overthrow of Aristide in 2004 had severely undermined the effort, in 2006 at the return of Preval in power another effort was made to recover the majority of the bus left, and a Gift of 300 new bus from Taiwan an effort to bring back Service Plus in association of the drivers. Mini-vans are frequently used to cover towns close to Port-au-Prince, such as P\u00e9tion-Ville, Jacmel, Leogane and others. Today throughout the island, motorcycles are widely used as a form of taxi.\n\n== Water transport ==\nThe port at Port-au-Prince, [[Port international de Port-au-Prince]], has more registered shipping than any of the over one dozen other ports in the country. Its facilities include [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s, large [[Berth (moorings)|berth]]s, and warehouses, but these facilities are in universally poor shape. The port is under-used, possibly due to the substantially higher port fees compared to ports in the [[Dominican Republic]].\n\nThe port of [[Saint-Marc]] is currently the preferred port of entry for consumer goods entering Haiti. Reasons for this may include its location away from volatile and [[Traffic congestion|congested]] Port-au-Prince, as well as its central location relative to a large number of Haitian cities, including [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]], [[Carrefour, Haiti|Carrefour]], [[Delmas, Ouest|Delmas]], [[Desarmes]], [[Fonds-Parisien]], [[Fort-Libert\u00e9]], [[Gona\u00efves]], [[Hinche]], [[Artibonite (department)|Artibonite]], [[Limb\u00e9, Nord|Limbe]], [[P\u00e9tion-Ville]], [[Port-de-Paix]], and [[Verrettes]]. These cities, together with their surrounding areas, contain about six million of Haiti's eight million people.\n\nThe islands of \u00cele-\u00e0-V\u00e2che, \u00cele de la Tortue, Petite and Grand Cayemite, Grosse Caye, and \u00cele de la Gon\u00e2ve are reachable only by ferry or small sailing boat (except for \u00cele de la Gon\u00e2ve, which has an airstrip that is rarely used). The majority of towns near the coast of Haiti are also accessible primarily by small sailing boats.  Such boats are usually cheaper and more available than is public ground transportation, which is commonly limited to trucks loaded with merchandise and passengers on market days.\n\n===Statistics===\n;Waterways\n 150&nbsp;km navigable\n\n;Merchant Marine\nnone (1999 est.)\n\n===Ports and harbors===\n[[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]], [[Gona\u00efves]], [[Jacmel]], [[J\u00e9r\u00e9mie]], [[Les Cayes]], [[Mirago\u00e2ne]], Port-au-Prince, [[Port-de-Paix]], [[Saint-Marc]], [[Fort-Libert\u00e9]]\n\n===History===\nHaiti has one of the oldest maritime histories in the Americas.\n;Panama Canal Railway Company\nThe [[Panama Canal Railway]] Company ran a shipping line with three [[ocean liner]]s that traveled between New York City (USA) - Port-au-Prince (Haiti) - [[Crist\u00f3bal, Col\u00f3n|Cristobal]] (Panama).

In this cold climate plant life is mainly limited to grasses, lichens, and [[moss]]es.<ref>[http://heardisland.antarctica.gov.au/nature/plants Plants]. Australian Department of the Environment, Australian Antarctic Division. Updated 28 February 2005.</ref> Low plant diversity reflects the islands\u2019 isolation, small size, severe climate, the short, cool growing season and, for Heard Island, substantial permanent ice cover. The main environmental determinants of vegetation on subantarctic islands are wind exposure, water availability, parent soil composition, salt spray exposure, nutrient availability, disturbance by trampling (from seabirds and seals) and, possibly, altitude. At Heard Island, exposure to salt spray and the presence of breeding and moulting seabirds and seals are particularly strong influences on vegetation composition and structure in coastal areas.\n\n==== History ====\nEvidence from microfossil records indicates that ferns and woody plants were present on Heard Island during the [[Tertiary]] (a period with a cool and moist climate). Neither group of plants is present today, although potential Tertiary survivors include the vascular plant ''[[Pringlea|Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'' and six moss species. Volcanic activity has altered the distribution and abundance of the vegetation. The vascular flora covers a range of environments and, although only six species are currently widespread, glacial retreat and the consequent connection of previously separate ice-free areas is providing opportunities for further distribution of vegetation into adjacent areas.\n\n==== Flowering plants and ferns ====\nLow-growing [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] flowering plants and [[bryophyte]]s are the major vegetation components. The vascular flora comprises the smallest number of species of any major subantarctic island group, reflecting its isolation, small ice-free area and severe climate. Twelve vascular species are known from Heard Island, of which five have also been recorded on McDonald Island. None of the vascular species is endemic, although ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'', ''[[Colobanthus kerguelensis]]'', and ''[[Poa kerguelensis]]'' occur only on subantarctic islands in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nThe plants are typically subantarctic, but with a higher abundance of the cushion-forming ''[[Azorella selago]]'' than other subantarctic islands. Heard Island is the largest subantarctic island with no confirmed human-introduced plants. Areas available for plant colonisation on Heard Island are generally the result of retreating glaciers or new ice-free land created by lava flows. Today, substantial vegetation covers over 20&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of Heard Island, and is best developed on coastal areas at elevations below 250&nbsp;m.\n\n==== Mosses and liverworts ====\nBryophytes (mosses and liverworts) contribute substantially to the overall biodiversity of Heard Island, with 43 mosses and 19 liverworts being recorded, often occupying habitats unsuitable for vascular plants, such as cliff faces. Bryophytes are present in most of the major vegetation communities including several soil and moss-inhabiting species. A 1980 survey of McDonald Island found lower diversity than that on Heard Island; four mosses and a number of algal species are recorded from there.\n\n==== Algae ====\nAt least 100 species of terrestrial algae are known from Heard Island, commonly in permanently moist and ephemeral habitats. Forests of the giant Antarctic kelp ''[[Durvillaea antarctica]]'' occur at a number of sites around Heard Island and at least 17 other species of seaweed are known, with more to be added following the identification of recent collections. Low seaweed diversity is due to the island's isolation from other land masses, unsuitable beach habitat, constant abrasion by waves, tides and small stones, and the extension of glaciers into the sea in many areas.\n\n==== Vegetation communities ====\nHeard Island has a range of terrestrial environments in which vegetation occurs. Seven general vegetation communities are currently recognised, although vegetation composition is considered more of a continuum than discrete units:\n* [[Subantarctic]] vegetation is minimal and includes small types of shrubbery. Including mosses and liverworts.\n* [[cushion plant|Open cushionfield]] vegetation is the most widespread and abundant vegetation type on Heard Island. It is characterised by ''[[Azorella selago]]'' cushions interspersed with bryophytes, small vascular species and bare ground with 20\u201375% cover, and found mainly at altitudes between 30\u201370m asl.\n* [[Fellfield]] describes vegetation with abundant bare ground and less than 50% plant cover. Fellfield may occur as a result of harsh climatic and/or edaphic factors, or recent [[deglaciation]] which has exposed bare ground.\n* [[Moss]]y [[fellfield]] is a community with high species richness and consists of bryophytes and small ''Azorella selago'' cushions. It is found at altitudes between 30\u2013150&nbsp;m in areas with intermediate exposure.\n* [[Herbfield|Wet mixed herbfield]] occurs on moist substrate, mostly on moraines and moist lee slopes (often in association with burrowing petrels colonies) at low altitude (< 40&nbsp;m) where the water table is at or close to the surface. Species richness is highest here of all the communities, with dominant species being ''[[Poa cookii]]'', ''Azorella selago'', ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'', ''[[Acaena magellanica]]'', and ''[[Deschampsia antarctica]]''.\n* [[Coastal Strand|Coastal biotic]] vegetation is dominated by ''Poa cookii'' and ''Azorella selago'', occurring mainly on coastal sites of moderate exposure and in areas subject to significant influence from seals and seabirds.\n* [[Supralittoral zone|Saltspray vegetation]] is dominated by the salt-tolerant moss ''[[Muelleriella crassifolia]]'' and limited in extent, being found at low elevations on lavas in exposed coastal sites.\n* [[cushion plant|Closed cushionfield]] is found on moraines and sand at altitudes mostly below 60&nbsp;m, and is dominated almost entirely by ''Azorella selago'' cushions that often grow together to form continuous carpets which can be subject to burrowing by seabirds.\n\n==== Outlook ====\nOne of the most rapidly changing physical settings in the subantarctic has been produced on Heard Island by a combination of rapid glacial recession and climate warming.{{cn|date=February 2018}} The consequent increase in habitat available for plant colonisation, plus the coalescing of previously discrete ice-free areas, has led to marked changes in the vegetation of Heard Island in the last 20 years or so. Other species and vegetation communities found on subantarctic islands north of the [[Antarctic Convergence]] now absent from the Heard Island flora may colonise the island if climate change produces more favourable conditions.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nSome plant species are spreading and modifying the structure and composition of communities, some of which are also increasing in distribution. It is likely that further changes will occur, and possibly at an accelerated rate. Changes in population numbers of seal and seabird species are also expected to affect the vegetation by changing nutrient availability and disturbance through trampling.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nOne plant species on Heard Island, ''[[Poa annua]]'', a cosmopolitan grass native to Europe, was possibly introduced by humans, though is more likely to have arrived naturally, probably by [[skua]]s from the Kerguelen Islands where it is widespread. It was initially recorded in 1987 in two deglaciated areas of Heard Island not previously exposed to human visitors, while being absent from known sites of past human habitation. Since 1987 ''Poa annua'' populations have increased in density and abundance within the original areas and have expanded beyond them. Expeditioner boot traffic during the Australian Antarctic program expedition in 1987 may be at least partly responsible for the spread, but it is probably mainly due to dispersal by wind and the movement of seabirds and seals around the island.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe potential for introducing plant species (including invasive species not previously found on subantarctic islands) by both natural and human-induced means is high. This is due to the combination of low species diversity and climatic amelioration. During the 2003/04 summer a new plant species, ''[[Cotula plumosa]]'', was recorded. Only one small specimen was found growing on a coastal river terrace that had experienced substantial development and expansion of vegetation over the past decade. The species has a circumantarctic distribution and occurs on many subantarctic islands.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n=== Fungi ===\n71 species of [[lichen]]s have been recorded from Heard Island and they are common on exposed rock, dominating the vegetation in some areas.<ref>[http://www.heardisland.org/HD_documents/HE_Library/Management/HIMIMR_MP_Part3.pdf Part 3: A Description of the Heard Island and McDonald Islands Marine Reserve].

The surrounding waters are important feeding areas for birds and some scavenging species also derive sustenance from their cohabitants on the islands. The islands have been identified by [[BirdLife International]] as an [[Important Bird Area]] because they support very large numbers of nesting seabirds.<ref>BirdLife International. (2011).

The penguins mostly colonise the coastal tussock and grasslands of Heard Island, and have previously been recorded as occupying the flats and gullies on McDonald Island.\n\nOther seabirds recorded as breeding at Heard Island include three species of albatross ([[Wandering albatross|wandering]], [[Black-browed albatross|black-browed]] and [[light-mantled albatross]]es, [[southern giant petrel]]s, [[Cape petrel]]s, four species of burrowing petrels [[Antarctic prion|Antarctic]] and [[Fulmar prion]]s, [[Common diving-petrel|common]] and [[South Georgian diving-petrel]]s), [[Wilson's storm-petrel]]s, [[kelp gull]]s, [[subantarctic skua]]s, [[Antarctic tern]]s and the [[Heard shag]].<ref>Woehler, E.J.

Green, K. & Woehler, E.(Surrey Beattie.</ref> Although not a true seabird, the Heard Island subspecies of the [[black-faced sheathbill]] also breeds on the island. Both the shag and the sheathbill are endemic to Heard Island.\n\nA further 28 seabird species are recorded as either non-breeding visitors or have been noted during 'at-sea surveys' of the islands. All recorded breeding species, other than the Heard Island sheathbill, are listed marine species under the Australian Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act (1999, four are listed as threatened species and five are listed migratory species. Under the EPBC Act a recovery plan has been made for albatrosses and giant petrels, which calls for ongoing population monitoring of the species found at HIMI, and at the time of preparing this plan a draft recovery plan has also been made for the [[Heard Island shag|Heard Island cormorant (or shag)]] and Antarctic tern.\n\nThe recorded populations of some seabird species found in the Reserve have shown marked change. The king penguin population is the best studied seabird species on Heard Island and has shown a dramatic increase since first recorded in 1947/48, with the population doubling every five years or so for more than 50 years.\n\nA paper reviewing population data for the black-browed albatross between 1947 and 2000/01 suggested that the breeding population had increased to approximately three times that present in the late 1940s,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Woehler |first=E.

Report of the Twenty-First Meeting of the Scientific Committee for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, Hobart, Australia.</ref> as discussed in the paper. The discovery of a large, previously unknown, colony of Heard shags in 2000/01 at Cape Pillar raised the known breeding population from 200 pairs to over 1000 pairs.<ref name=\"Woehler, E.J. 2006\"/> The breeding population of southern giant petrels decreased by more than 50% between the early 1950s and the late 1980s.\n\n==== Terrestrial, freshwater and coastal invertebrates ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}\n\nHeard Island supports a relatively low number of terrestrial invertebrate species compared to other Southern Ocean islands, in parallel with the low species richness in the flora\u2013that is, the island's isolation and limited ice-free area. [[Endemism]] is also generally low and the invertebrate fauna is exceptionally pristine with few, if any, (successful) human-induced introductions of alien species.\nTwo species, including the thrip ''Apterothrips apteris'' and the mite ''[[Tyrophagus putrescentiae]]'' are thought to be recent, possibly natural, introductions. An exotic species of earthworm ''[[Dendrodrilus rubidus]]'' was also collected in 1929 from a dump near Atlas Cove, and has recently been collected from a variety of habitats including wallows, streams and lakes on Heard Island.\n\nThe arthropods of Heard Island are comparatively well known with 54 species of [[mite]] and [[tick]], one [[spider]] and eight [[springtail]]s recorded. A study over summer at Atlas Cove in 1987/88 showed overall densities of up to 60 000 individual springtails per square metre in soil under stands of ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]''. Despite a few recent surveys, the non-arthropod invertebrate fauna of Heard Island remain poorly known.\n\nBeetles and flies dominate Heard Island's known insect fauna, which comprises up to 21 species of ectoparasite (associated with birds and seals) and up to 13 free-living species. Approximately half of the free-living insects are habitat-specific, while the remainder are generalists found in a variety of habitats, being associated with either supralittoral or intertidal zones, ''[[Poa cookii]]'' and ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'' stands, [[bryophyte]]s, lichen-covered rocks, exposed rock faces or the underside of rocks. There is a pronounced seasonality to the insect fauna, with densities in winter months dropping to a small percentage (between 0.75%) of the summer maximum. Distinct differences in relative abundances of species between habitats has also been shown, including a negative relationship between altitude and body size for Heard Island weevils.\n\nThe fauna of the freshwater pools, lakes, streams and mires found in the coastal areas of Heard Island are broadly similar to those on other subantarctic islands of the southern Indian Ocean. Many species reported from Heard Island are found elsewhere. Some sampling of freshwater fauna has been undertaken during recent expeditions and records to date indicate that the freshwater fauna includes a species of [[Protista]], a gastrotrich, two species of [[tardigrade]], at least four species of nematode, 26 species of rotifer, six species of annelid and 14 species of arthropod.\n\nAs with the other shore biota, the marine macro-invertebrate fauna of Heard Island is similar in composition and local distribution to other subantarctic islands, although relatively little is known about the Heard Island communities compared with the well-studied fauna of some other islands in the subantarctic region, such as [[Macquarie Island|Macquarie]] and Kerguelen.\n\nDespite Heard Island's isolation, species richness is considered to be moderate, rather than depauperate, although the number of endemic species reported is low. The large macro-alga ''[[Durvillaea antarctica]]'' supports a diverse array of invertebrate taxa and may play an important role in transporting some of this fauna to Heard Island.\n\nThe rocky shores of Heard Island exhibit a clear demarcation between fauna of the lower kelp holdfast zone and the upper shore zone community, probably due to effects of desiccation, predation and freezing in the higher areas. The limpet ''Nacella kerguelensis'' is abundant in the lower part of the shore, being found on rock surfaces and on kelp holdfasts. Other common but less abundant species in this habitat include the chiton ''[[Hemiarthrum setulosum]]'' and the starfish ''Anasterias mawsoni''. The amphipod ''Hyale'' sp. and the isopod ''Cassidinopsis'' sp. are closely associated with the kelp. Above the kelp holdfast zone, the littornid ''Laevilitorina (Corneolitorina) heardensis'' and the bivalve mollusc ''Kidderia bicolor'' are found in well-sheltered situations, and another bivalve ''Gaimardia trapesina trapesina'' has been recorded from immediately above the holdfast zone. Oligochaetes are also abundant in areas supporting porous and spongy layers of algal mat.\n\n==== Wetlands ====\nHeard Island has a number of small wetland sites scattered around its coastal perimeter, including areas of wetland vegetation, lagoons or lagoon complexes, rocky shores and sandy shores, including the Elephant Spit. Many of these wetland areas are separated by active glaciers. There are also several short glacier-fed streams and glacial pools. Some wetland areas have been recorded on McDonald Island but, due to substantial volcanic activity since the last landing was made in 1980, their present extent is unknown.\n\nThe HIMI wetland is listed on the [[Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia]] and, in a recent analysis of Commonwealth-managed wetlands, was ranked highest for nomination under the [[Ramsar Convention|Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar Convention)]] as an internationally important wetland.\n\nSix wetland types have been identified from HIMI covering approximately 1860 ha: coastal \u2018pool complex\u2019 (237 ha); inland \u2018pool complex\u2019 (105 ha); vegetated seeps mostly on recent glaciated areas (18 ha); glacial lagoons (1103 ha); non-glacial lagoons (97ha); Elephant Spit (300 ha) plus some coastal areas. On Heard Island, the majority of these types suites are found below 150&nbsp;m asl. The wetland vegetation occurs in the \u2018wet mixed herbfield\u2019 and \u2018coastal biotic vegetation\u2019 communities described above.\n\nThe wetlands provide important breeding and feeding habitat for a number of Antarctic and subantarctic wetland animals. These include the southern elephant seal and macaroni, gentoo, king and southern rockhopper penguins, considered to be wetland species under the Ramsar Convention. Non-wetland vegetated parts of the islands also support penguin and other seabird colonies.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:FMIB 46007 Antarctic Sea-Elephant Fishery.jpeg|thumb|right|Heard Island 1887 by [[Henry Wood Elliott]]<ref>Goode, George Brown (1887) Fisheries and Fishery Industries of the United States, (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1887).</ref>]]\nNeither island-cluster had recorded visitors until the mid-1850s. Peter Kemp, a British sailor, may have become the first person to see the island.{{which|date=January 2013}} On 27 November 1833, he spotted it from the [[brig]] ''Magnet'' during a voyage from the [[Kerguelen Islands]] to the Antarctic and was believed{{by whom|date=January 2013}} to have entered the island on his 1833 chart.\n\nAn American sailor, [[Captain John Heard]], on the ship ''Oriental'', sighted Heard Island on 25 November 1853, en route from [[Boston]] to Melbourne. He reported the discovery one month later and had the island named after him. Captain William McDonald aboard the ''Samarang'' [[1854 in Australia#Exploration and settlement|discovered the nearby McDonald Islands]] six weeks later, on 4 January 1854.\n\nNo landing took place on the islands until March 1855, when sealers from the ''Corinthian'', led by Captain [[Erasmus Darwin Rogers]], went ashore at a place called Oil Barrel Point. In the sailing period from 1855 to 1880 a number of American sealers spent a year or more on the island, living in appalling conditions in dark smelly huts, also at Oil Barrel Point. At its peak the community consisted of 200 people. By 1880 sealers had wiped out most of the seal population and then left the island. In all the islands furnished more than 100,000 barrels of [[elephant seal|elephant-seal]] oil during this period.\n\nA number of wrecks have occurred in the vicinity of the islands. There is also a discarded building left from John Heard's sealing station which is situated near Atlas Cove.\n\nThe first recorded landing on McDonald Island was made by Australian scientists Grahame Budd and Hugh Thelander on 12 February 1971, using a helicopter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cerchi.net/destinations/2002_sioe/sioe_himi.html|title=SIOE 2002: Heard I. & The McDonald Is|date=1 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426052000/http://www.cerchi.net/destinations/2002_sioe/sioe_himi.html|archive-date=26 April 2012|last=Cerchi|first=Dan|website=www.cerchi.net}}</ref><ref name=\"aad\">{{cite web|url=http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=2177 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406140708/http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=2177  |archivedate=2011-04-06 |dead-url=yes |title=Gazetteer - AADC Name Details - Australian Antarctic Data Centre |via=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=29 March 2016|website=[[Australian Antarctic Data Centre]]}}</ref>\n\nThe islands have been a territory of Australia since 1947, when they were transferred from the UK<ref name=\"CIA World Factbook.\"/> The archipelago became a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1997.\n\nSeveral [[amateur radio]] operators have visited Heard, often associated with scientific expeditions.

Planned transmissions had been for ten days, although owing to the bad weather conditions and the high failure rate of the transmitter elements, used at a frequency below their design frequency, the transmissions were terminated on the sixth day, when only two of the original ten transducers were still working.\n\n== Administration and economy ==\n[[File:(The abode of science on Heard Island, BANZARE, 1929) (6173425701).jpg|thumb|right|Heard Island, 1929.]]\nThe United Kingdom formally established its claim to Heard Island in 1910, marked by the raising of the Union Flag and the erection of a beacon by Captain Evensen, master of the ''Mangoro''. Effective government, administration and control of Heard Island and the McDonald Islands was transferred to the Australian government on 26 December 1947 at the commencement of the first [[Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions|Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition]] (ANARE) to Heard Island, with a formal declaration that took place at Atlas Cove. The transfer was confirmed by an exchange of letters between the two governments on 19 December 1950.\n\nThe islands are a territory (Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands) of Australia administered from [[Hobart]] by the [[Australian Antarctic Division]] of the Australian [[Department of the Environment and Energy]]. The administration of the territory is established in the ''Heard Island and McDonald Islands Act 1953'', which places it under the laws of the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Heard Island and McDonald Islands Act 1953|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2008C00326|website=Federal Register of Legislation|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=7 May 2018}}</ref> The islands are contained within a {{convert|65000|km2|sqmi|adj=on}} marine reserve and are primarily visited for research, meaning that there is no permanent human habitation.<ref name=\"CIA World Factbook.\"/>\n\nFrom 1947 until 1955 there were camps of visiting scientists on Heard Island (at [[Atlas Cove]] in the northwest, which was in 1969 again occupied by American scientists and expanded in 1971 by French scientists) and in 1971 on McDonald Island (at [[Williams Bay, Australia|Williams Bay]]).

The legal status of the Catholic Church and its property was recognised by the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Constantine the Great]], and it became the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] by the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380.\n\nAfter the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476, the temporal [[Legal history of the Catholic Church|legal jurisdisction]] of the [[Papal primacy]] was further recognised as promulgated in [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|Canon law]]. The Holy See was granted territory in [[Duchy of Rome]] by the [[Donation of Sutri]] in 728 of [[List of kings of the Lombards|King]] [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] of the [[Lombards]], and [[sovereignty]] by the [[Donation of Pepin]] in 756 by [[List of Frankish kings|King]] [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] of the [[Franks]].\n\nThe [[Papal States]] held extensive territory and armes forces in 756\u20131870. [[Pope Leo III]] [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] [[Charlemagne]] as [[Roman Emperor]] by ''[[translatio imperii]]'' in 800. The [[Papal coronation]]s from 858 and the ''[[Dictatus papae]]'' in 1075 mark the zenit of the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power]] claims, and several contemporary states still trace their own sovereignty to recognition in medieval [[Papal bull]]s.\n\nSovereignty was retained despite multiple [[Sack of Rome (disambiguation)|sacks of Rome]] during the Early Middle Ages. Yet, relations with the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was at times strained, reaching from the ''[[Diploma Ottonianum]]'' and ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'' regarding the \"[[Patrimony of Saint Peter]]\" in the 10th century, to the [[Investiture Controversy]] in 1076-1122, and settled again by the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. The exiled [[Avignon Papacy]] during 1309-1376 also put a strain on the Papacy, which was however finally returned to Rome.

In addition to Spanish resources, the conquerors relied heavily on armed forces from Mexico\u2014[[Tlaxcalans]] and [[Aztec|Mexica]] armies of thousands who remained garrisoned in the region.\n\nResistance to conquest was led in particular by [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]]. Many regions in the north of Honduras never fell to the Spanish, notably the [[Mosquito Coast|Miskito Kingdom]]. After the Spanish conquest, Honduras became part of Spain's vast empire in the New World within the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Kingdom of Guatemala]]. Trujillo and [[Gracias a Dios Department|Gracias]] were the first city-capitals. The Spanish ruled the region for approximately three centuries.\n\n===Spanish Honduras (1524\u20131821)===\nHonduras was organized as a province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Kingdom of Guatemala]] and the capital was fixed, first at Trujillo on the Atlantic coast, and later at [[Comayagua]], and finally at [[Tegucigalpa]] in the central part of the country.\n\n[[Silver mining]] was a key factor in the Spanish conquest and settlement of Honduras.<ref name=Newson1>{{cite journal\n|last=Newson\n|first=Linda\n|title=Labour in the Colonial Mining Industry of Honduras\n|date=October 1982 |volume=39\n|journal=The Americas\n|publisher=The Academy of American Franciscan History\n|location=Philadelphia\n|page=185\n|doi=10.2307/981334\n|issue=2\n|jstor=981334|registration=yes\n}}</ref>  Initially the mines were worked by local people through the [[encomienda]] system, but as disease and resistance made this option less available, slaves from other parts of Central America were brought in.

They managed to found a few towns along the coast, at [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s|Puerto Caballos]] and Trujillo in particular, but failed to conquer the eastern portion of the region and many pockets of independent indigenous people as well. The [[Mosquito Coast|Miskito Kingdom]] in the northeast was particularly effective at resisting conquest. The Miskito Kingdom found support from northern European privateers, pirates and especially the British formerly English colony of [[Jamaica]], which placed much of the area under its protection after 1740.\n\n[[File:Exterior Fuerte de Omoa Honduras.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Battle of San Fernando de Omoa|Fortaleza de San Fernando de Omoa]] was built by the Spanish to protect the coast of Honduras from English pirates.]]\n\n===Independence (1821)===\nHonduras gained independence from Spain in 1821 and was a part of the [[First Mexican Empire]] until 1823, when it became part of the [[United Provinces of Central America]]. It has been an independent republic and has held regular elections since 1838. In the 1840s and 1850s Honduras participated in several failed attempts at Central American unity, such as the Confederation of Central America (1842\u20131845), the covenant of Guatemala (1842), the Diet of Sonsonate (1846), the Diet of Nacaome (1847) and National Representation in Central America (1849\u20131852). Although Honduras eventually adopted the name Republic of Honduras, the unionist ideal never waned, and Honduras was one of the Central American countries that pushed the hardest for a policy of regional unity.\n\n[[Neoliberal]] policies favoring [[international trade]] and investment began in the 1870s, and soon foreign interests became involved, first in shipping from the north coast, especially tropical fruit and most notably bananas, and then in building railroads. In 1888, a projected railroad line from the Caribbean coast to the capital, [[Tegucigalpa]], ran out of money when it reached [[San Pedro Sula]]. As a result, San Pedro grew into the nation's primary industrial center and second-largest city. [[Comayagua]] was the capital of Honduras until 1880, when the capital moved to Tegucigalpa.\n\nSince independence, nearly 300 small internal rebellions and civil wars have occurred in the country, including some changes of r\u00e9gime.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===20th century===\nIn the late nineteenth century, Honduras granted land and substantial exemptions to several US-based fruit and infrastructure companies in return for developing the country's northern regions.

Rural areas generally have basic drinking water systems with limited capacity for water treatment. Many urban areas have sewer systems in place to collect wastewater, but proper treatment of wastewater is rare. In rural areas sanitary facilities are generally limited to latrines and basic septic pits.\n\nWater and sanitation services were historically provided by the {{Interlanguage link multi|Servicio Aut\u00f3nomo de Alcantarillas y Aqueductos|es}} (SANAA). In 2003, the government enacted a new \"water law\" which called for the [[decentralization]] of water services.

Since this law passed, many communities have joined together to address water and sanitation issues on a regional basis.\n\nMany national and international non-government organizations have a history of working on water and sanitation projects in Honduras.

The middle star represents Honduras, located in the center of the Central American Union.\n\nThe coat of arms was established in 1945. It is an equilateral triangle, at the base is a volcano between three castles, over which is a rainbow and the sun shining. The triangle is placed on an area that symbolizes being bathed by both seas. Around all of this an oval containing in golden lettering: \"Republic of Honduras, Free, Sovereign and Independent\".\n\nThe \"[[National Anthem of Honduras]]\" is a result of a contest carried out in 1914 during the presidency of [[Manuel Bonilla]]. In the end, it was the poet [[Augusto Coello]] that ended up writing the anthem, with German-born Honduran composer [[Carlos Hartling]] writing the music. The anthem was officially adopted on 15 November 1915, during the presidency of {{Interlanguage link multi|Alberto de Jes\u00fas Membre\u00f1o|es|3=Alberto Membre\u00f1o}}. The anthem is composed of a choir and seven stroonduran.{{clarify|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe national flower is the famous orchid, ''[[Rhyncholaelia]] digbyana'' (formerly known as ''Brassavola digbyana''), which replaced the rose in 1969. The change of the national flower was carried out during the administration of general [[Oswaldo L\u00f3pez Arellano]], thinking that ''Brassavola digbiana'' \"is an indigenous plant of Honduras; having this flower exceptional characteristics of beauty, vigor and distinction\", as the decree dictates it.\n\nThe national tree of Honduras was declared in 1928 to be simply \"the Pine that appears symbolically in our [[Coat of Arms]]\" (''el Pino que figura simb\u00f3licamente en nuestro Escudo''),<ref>Acuerdo No. 429, 14 de mayo de 1928.</ref> even though [[pine]]s comprise a [[genus]] and not a [[species]], and even though legally there's no specification as for what kind of pine should appear in the coat of arms ''either''. Because of its commonality in the country, the ''[[Pinus oocarpa]]'' species has become since then the species most strongly associated as the national tree, but legally it is not so. Another species associated as the national tree is the ''[[Pinus caribaea]]''.\n\nThe national mammal is the [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus''), which was adopted as a measure to avoid excessive depredation{{clarify|date=July 2016}}. It is one of two species of deer that live in Honduras.\nThe national bird of Honduras is the [[scarlet macaw]] (''Ara macao''). This bird was much valued by the pre-Columbian civilizations of Honduras.\n\n===Folklore===\nLegends and fairy tales are paramount in Honduran culture. [[Lluvia de Peces]] (Rain of Fish) is an example of this. The legends of El [[Cadejo]] and [[La Llorona]] are also popular.\n\n===Sports===\nThe major sports in Honduras are football, basketball, rugby, volleyball and cycling, with smaller followings for athletics, softball and handball.

An important part of that prehistory was the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n presence around the city of [[Cop\u00e1n]] in western Honduras near the Guatemalan border. Cop\u00e1n was a major Maya city that began to flourish around 150 A.D. but reached its height in the Late Classic (700\u2013850 A.D.). It has left behind many carved inscriptions and [[stelae]]. The ancient kingdom, named ''[[Cop\u00e1n|Xukpi]]'', existed from the 5th century to the early 9th century, and had antecedents going back to at least the 2nd century.\n\nThe [[Mayan civilization]] began a marked decline in population in the 9th century, but there is evidence of people still living in and around the city until at least 1200.<ref>Paine, Richard R and Freter, AnnCorinne 1996 \"Environmental Degradation and the Classic Maya Collapse at Copan, Honduras\" ''Ancient Mesoamerica'' 7:37\u201347 Cambridge University Press</ref> By the time the Spanish came to Honduras, the once great city-state of Cop\u00e1n was overrun by the jungle, and the surviving [[Ch'orti' people|Ch\u2019orti\u2019]] were isolated from their Choltian linguistic peers to the west.

On 14 August 1502 Columbus landed on the mainland near modern [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]]. Columbus named the country Honduras (\"depths\") for the deep waters off its coast.\n\nIn January 1524, [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] directed captain [[Crist\u00f3bal de Olid]] to establish a colony in Honduras. Olid sailed with several ships and over 400 soldiers and colonists to Cuba to pick up supplies Cort\u00e9s had arranged for him. There Governor [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar]] convinced him to claim the colony he was to found as his own. Olid sailed to the coast of Honduras and came ashore east of [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s|Puerto Caballos]] at [[Triunfo de la Cruz]] where he settled and declared himself governor. Cort\u00e9s got word of Olid's insurrection however, and sent his cousin [[Francisco de las Casas]] with several ships to Honduras to remove Olid and claim the area for Cort\u00e9s. Las Casas, however, lost most of his fleet in a series of storms along the coast of [[Belize]] and Honduras. His ships limped into the bay at Triunfo, where Olid had established his headquarters.\n\nWhen Las Casas arrived at Olid's headquarters, a large part of Olid's army was inland, dealing with another threat from a party of Spaniards under [[Gil Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila]]. Nevertheless, Olid decided to launch an attack with two [[caravel]]s. Las Casas returned fire and sent boarding parties to capture Olid's ships. Under the circumstances, Olid proposed a truce. Las Casas agreed, and did not land his forces. During the night, a fierce storm destroyed his fleet and about a third of his men were lost. The remainder were taken prisoner after two days of exposure and no food. After being forced to swear loyalty to Olid, they were released. But Las Casas was kept prisoner, and soon joined by Gonz\u00e1lez, who had been captured by Olid's inland force.\n\nThe Spanish record two different stories about what happened next. [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]], writing in the 17th century, said that Olid's soldiers rose up and murdered him. [[Bernal Diaz del Castillo]], in his ''Verdadera Historia de la Conquista de Nueva Espa\u00f1a'', says that Las Casas captured Olid and beheaded him at Naco. In the meantime Cort\u00e9s marched overland from Mexico to Honduras, arriving in 1525. Cort\u00e9s ordered the founding of two cities, Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Navidad, near modern [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] and [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]], and named Las Casas governor. However, both Las Casas and Cort\u00e9s sailed back to Mexico before the end of 1525, where Las Casas was arrested and returned to Spain as a prisoner by Estrada and Alboronoz{{who|date=August 2017}}. Las Casas returnef to Mexico in 1527, and returned again to Spain with Cort\u00e9s in 1528.\n\nOn 25 April 1526, before going back to Mexico, Cortes appointed [[Hernando Arias de Saavedra|Hernando de Saavedra]] governor of Honduras with instructions to treat the indigenous people well. On 26 October 1526, Diego L\u00f3pez de Salcedo was appointed by the emperor as governor of [[Honduras]], replacing Saavedra. The next decade was marked by clashes between the personal ambitions of the rulers and conquerors, which hindered the installation of good government.{{cn|date=August 2017}} The Spanish colonists rebelled against their leaders, and the indigenous people rebelled against the Spanish and against the abuses they imposed.\n\nSalcedo, seeking to enrich himself, seriously clashed with [[Pedro Arias D\u00e1vila]], governor of [[Castilla del Oro]], who wanted Honduras as part of his domains. In 1528, Salcedo arrested Pedarias and forced him to cede part of his Honduran domain, but [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] rejected that outcome. After the death of Salcedo in 1530, settlers became arbiters of power.{{what|date=December 2017}} Governors hung and removed.{{what|date=December 2017}} In this situation, the settlers asked [[Pedro de Alvarado]] to end the anarchy. With the arrival of Alvarado in 1536, chaos decreased, and the region was under authority.{{what|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn 1537 [[Francisco de Montejo]] was appointed governor. He set aside the division of territory made by Alvarado on arriving in Honduras. One of his principal captains, [[Alonso de C\u00e1ceres]], quelled the indigenous revolt led by the [[cacique]] [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] in 1537 and 1538. In 1539 Alvarado and Montejo disagreed over who was governor, which caught the attention of the [[Council of India]]. Montejo went to [[Chiapas]], and Alvarado became governor of [[Honduras]].<ref>{{Cite book|year=1991|editor-last=Olson|editor-first=James Stuart|editor2-last=Shadle|editor2-first=Robert|title=Historical Dictionary of European Imperialism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyqepNdgUWkC&printsec=frontcover |location=Westport, Connecticut|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-26257-8|pages=284\u2013285|accessdate=11 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the period leading up to the conquest of Honduras by [[Pedro de Alvarado]], many indigenous people along the north coast of Honduras were captured and taken as slaves to work on Spain's Caribbean [[plantation]]s. It wasn't until Alvarado defeated the indigenous resistance headed by \u00c7ocamba near Ticamaya that the Spanish began to conquer the country in 1536. Alvarado divided the native towns and gave their labor to the Spanish conquistadors as ''[[repartimiento]]''. Further indigenous uprisings near [[Gracias a Dios Department|Gracias a Dios]], [[Comayagua]], and [[Olancho]] occurred in 1537\u201338. The uprising near Gracias a Dios was led by [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]], who is honored today by the name of the Honduran [[currency]].\n\n==Colonial Honduras==\n[[File:San Fernando de Omoa Fortress, Honduras.jpg|thumb|195px|The Fortress of [[San Fernando de Omoa]].]]\n[[File:Fuerte de San Crist\u00f3bal.jpg|thumb|175px|The Fortress of San Cristobal in Gracias.]]\nThe defeat of Lempira's revolt, and the decline in fighting among rival Spanish factions all contributed to expanded settlement and increased economic activity in Honduras. In late 1540, Honduras looked to be heading towards development and prosperity, thanks to the establishment of [[Gracias]] as the regional capital of the Audiencia of Guatemala (1544). However, this decision created resentment in the populated areas of  [[Guatemala]] and El Salvador. In 1549, the capital was moved to [[Antigua, Guatemala]], and Honduras and remained a new province within the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] until 1821.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/honduras/|title=Honduras: A Country Study|publisher=Tim Merrill for the Library of Congress|year=1995|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Colonial mining operations===\nThe first mining centers were located near the Guatemalan border, around Gracias. In 1538 these mines produced significant quantities of gold. In the early 1540s, the center for mining shifted eastward to the [[Guayape River|R\u00edo Guayape]] Valley, and silver joined gold as a major product. This change contributed to the rapid decline of Gracias and the rise of [[Comayagua]] as the center of colonial Honduras. The demand for labor also led to further revolts and accelerated the decimation of the native population.{{cn|date=August 2017}} As a result, [[African slavery]] was introduced into Honduras, and by 1545 the province may have had as many as 2,000 slaves. Other gold deposits were found near [[San Pedro Sula]] and the port of Trujillo.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n\nMining production began to decline in 1560, and thus the importance of Honduras. In early 1569, new silver discoveries briefly revived the economy, which led to the founding of [[Tegucigalpa]], which soon began to rival Comayagua as the most important city of the province. The silver boom peaked in 1584, and economic depression returned shortly thereafter. Honduran mining efforts were hampered by lack of capital and labor, and by difficult terrain. Mercury, vital for the production of silver, was scarce, besides the neglect of officials.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>\n[[File:Francoislollonais.JPG|thumb|195px|European pirates burned Honduran towns during the colonial era]]\n\n===The partially conquered northern coast===\nWhile the Spanish made significant conquests in the south, they had less success on the Caribbean coast, to the north. They founded a number of towns on the coast such as [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s|Puerto Caballos]] in the east, and sent minerals and other exports across the country from the Pacific coast to be shipped to Spain from the Atlantic ports. They founded a number of inland towns on the northwestern side of the province, notably Naco and [[San Pedro Sula]].\n\nIn the northeast, the province of [[Taguzgalpa]] resisted all attempts to conquer it, physically in the sixteenth century, or spiritually by missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries. Among the groups found along the northern coast and in neighboring [[Nicaragua]] were the [[Miskito people|Miskito]], who although organized in a democratic and egalitarian way, had a king, and hence were known as the [[Mosquito Coast|Mosquito Kingdom]].\n\nOne of the major problems for the Spanish rulers of Honduras, was the activity of the British in northern Honduras, a region over which they had only tenuous control. These activities began in the sixteenth century and continued until the nineteenth century. In the early years, European pirates frequently attacked the villages on the Honduran Caribbean. The [[Providence Island Company]], which occupied [[Providence Island colony|Providence Island]] not far from the coast, raided it occasionally and probably also had settlements on the shore, possibly around [[Cape Gracias a Dios]]. Around 1638, the king of the Miskito visited England and made an alliance with the English crown.<ref>[[Karen Ordahl Kupperman]], ''Providence Island: The Other Puritan Colony, 1631\u201341'' (Cambridge, 19xx), pp.</ref> In 1643 an English expedition destroyed the city of Trujillo, Honduras's main port.<ref name=\"Apuntes para la Historia de Honduras\">{{Cite book|last=Vera|first=Robustiano|year=1899|title=Apuntes para la Historia de Honduras|location=Tegucigalpa|publisher=Imprenta El Correo|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n===The British and the Miskito Kingdom===\nThe Spanish sent a fleet from [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] which destroyed the English colony at Providence island in 1641, and for a time the presence of an English base so close to the shore was eliminated. At about the same time, however, a group of slaves revolted and captured the ship on which they were traveling, then wrecked it at Cape Gracias a Dios. Managing to get ashore, they were received by the Miskito, which led within a generation to the [[Miskito Sambu|Miskito Zambo]], a mixed-race group that by 1715 had become the leaders of the kingdom.\n\nMeanwhile, the English captured [[Jamaica]] in 1655 and soon sought allies on the coast, and hit upon the Miskito, whose king [[Jeremy I]] visited [[Jamaica]] in 1687.\n\nA variety of other Europeans settled in the area during this time. An account from 1699 reveals a patchwork of private individuals, large Miskito family groups, Spanish settlements and pirate hideouts along the coast.<ref>M. W. \"The Mosqueto Indian and his Golden River,\" in [[Ansham Churchill]], ''A Collection of Voyages and Travels'' (London, 1732), vol. 6</ref> Britain declared much of the area a protectorate in 1740, though they exercised little authority there as a result of the decision. British colonization was particularly strong in the [[Bay Islands, Honduras|Bay Islands]], and alliances between the British and [[Miskito people|Miskito]] as well as more local supporters made this an area the Spanish could not easily control, and a haven for pirates.<ref>Troy Floyd, ''The Anglo-Spanish Struggle for Mosquitia'' (Albuquerque, 1967).</ref>\n\n===Bourbon reforms===\nIn the early eighteenth century, the [[House of Bourbon]], linked to the rulers of France, replaced the [[Habsburgs]] on the throne of Spain. The new dynasty began a series of reforms throughout the empire (the [[Bourbon Reforms]]), designed to make administration more efficient and profitable, and to facilitate defense of the colonies. Among these reforms was a reduction in tax on precious metals and of the price of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], a royal monopoly. In Honduras, these reforms contributed to the resurgence of the mining industry in the 1730s.<ref name=\"Honduras: A Country Study\"/>{{failed verification|date=June 2016}}\n\nUnder the [[Bourbons]], the Spanish government made several efforts to regain control of the Caribbean coast. In 1752, the Spaniards built the fort of [[San Fernando de Omoa]]. In 1780, the Spanish returned to Trujillo, which started out as base of operations against British settlements to the east. During the 1780s, the Spanish regained control of the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]] and took most of the British and their allies in the Black River area. They were not, however, able to expand their control beyond Puerto Caballos and Trujillo, thanks to determined Miskito resistance. The Anglo-Spanish Convention of 1786 issued the final recognition of Spanish sovereignty over the Caribbean coast.<ref name=\"Apuntes para la Historia de Honduras\"/>\n\n==Honduras in the nineteenth century==\n\n===Independence from Spain (1821)===\nIn the early 19th century, Napoleon's occupation of Spain led to the outbreak of revolts all across Spanish America. In New Spain, all of the fighting by those seeking independence was done in the center of that area from 1810 to 1821, what today is central Mexico. Once the Viceroy was defeated in the capital, Mexico City, in 1821, the news of the independence were sent to all the territories of New Spain including the Intendencies of the former Captaincy of Guatemala. Accepting this as a fact, Honduras joined the other Central American Intendencies in a joint declaration of independence from Spain. The public proclamation was done through the Act of Independence in 1821.\n\nAfter the declaration of independence it was the intention of the New Spain parliament to establish a commonwealth whereby the King of Spain, Ferdinand VII, would also be Emperor of New Spain, and in which both countries were to be governed by separate laws and with their own legislative offices. Should the king refuse the position, the law provided for a member of the House of Bourbon to accede to the New Spain throne. Ferdinand VII, did not recognize the independence and said that Spain would not allow any other European prince to take the throne of New Spain.\n\nBy request of Parliament, the president of the regency Agust\u00edn de Iturbide was proclaimed emperor of New Spain but the Parliament also decided to re name New Spain to Mexico. The Mexican Empire was the official name given to this monarchical regime from 1821 to 1823. The territory of the Mexican Empire included the continental intendencies and provinces of New Spain proper (including those of the former Captaincy General of Guatemala) (See: History of Central America).\n\n===Federal independence period (1821\u20131838)===\n\nIn 1823, a revolution in Mexico ousted Emperor [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], and a new Mexican congress voted to allow the Central American Intendencies to decide their own fate. That year, the United Provinces of Central America was formed of the five Central American Intendencies under General [[Manuel Jos\u00e9 Arce]]. The intendencies took the new name of \"states\".\n\nAmong the most important figures of the federal era include the first democratically elected president in Honduras, [[Dionisio de Herrera]], a lawyer, whose government, begun in 1824 established the first constitution, Gen. [[Francisco Moraz\u00e1n]], Federal President 1830\u20131834 and 1835\u20131839, whose figure embodies the ideal American Unionist, and [[Jos\u00e9 Cecilio del Valle]], editor of the Declaration of Independence signed in Guatemala on 15 September 1821 and Foreign Minister of Mexico in 1823.\n\nSoon, social and economic differences between Honduras and its regional neighbors exacerbated harsh partisan strife among Central American leaders and brought the collapse of the Federation from 1838 to 1839. General Moraz\u00e1n led unsuccessful efforts to maintain the federation. Restoring Central American unity remained the officially stated chief aim of Honduran foreign policy until after [[World War I]].\n\nHonduras broke away from the Central American Federation in October 1838 and became independent and sovereign state.\n\n==Democratic period between 1838 to 1899==\n{{Main article|History of Honduras (1838\u20131932)}}\n\nComayagua was the capital of Honduras until 1880, when it was transferred to [[Tegucigalpa]].\n\nIn the decades of 1840 and 1850 Honduras participated in several failed attempts to restore Central American unity, such as the Confederation of Central America (1842\u20131845), the covenant of Guatemala (1842), the Diet of Sonsonate ( 1846), the Diet of Nacaome (1847) and National Representation in Central America (1849\u20131852).\n\nAlthough Honduras eventually adopted the name Republic of Honduras, the unionist ideal never waned, and Honduras was one of the Central American countries that pushed hardest for the policy of regional unity.\n\nIn 1850, Honduras attempted to build, with foreign assistance, an Inter-Oceanic Railroad from Trujillo to Tegucigalpa and then on to the Pacific Coast.  The project stalled due to difficulties in the work, corruption and other issues, and in 1888, ran out of money when it reached [[San Pedro Sula]], resulting in its growth into the nation's main industrial center and second largest city. Since independence, nearly 300 small internal rebellions and civil wars have occurred in the country, including some changes of government.\n\n==Honduras in the twentieth century==\n\n===The internationalization of the north, 1899\u20131932===\nPolitical stability and instability both aided and distracted the economic revolution which transformed Honduras through the development of a [[plantation economy]] on the north coast.  As American corporations consolidated increasingly large landholdings in Honduras, they lobbied the US government to protect their investments.  Conflicts over land ownership, peasant rights, and a US-aligned [[comprador]] class of elites led to armed conflicts and multiple invasions by US armed forces.{{cn|date=December 2017}}  In the first decades of the century, US military incursions took place in 1903, 1907, 1911, 1912, 1919, 1924, and 1925.<ref>http://wais.stanford.edu/USA/us_supportforladictators8703.html</ref>  Because the country was effectively controlled by American fruit corporations, it was the original inspiration for the term \"[[banana republic]]\".<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/27/us-honduras-coup</ref>\n\n====The rise of US influence in Honduras (1899\u20131919)====\nIn 1899, the [[History of modern banana plantations in the Americas|banana industry]] in Honduras was growing rapidly. A peaceful transfer of power from [[Policarpo Bonilla]] to General [[Terencio Sierra]] marked the first time in decades that a constitutional transition had taken place.<ref name=fkpr /> By 1902, railroads had been built along the country's Caribbean coast to accommodate the growing banana industry.<ref name=fkpr /> However, Sierra made efforts to stay in office and refused to step down when a new president was elected in 1902, and was overthrown by [[Manuel Bonilla]] in 1903.<ref name=fkpr />\n\nAfter toppling Sierra, Bonilla, a conservative,<ref name=fkpr /> imprisoned ex-president [[Policarpo Bonilla]], a liberal rival,<ref name=fkpr /> for two years and made other attempts to suppress liberals throughout the country,<ref name=fkpr /> as they were the only other  organized political party.<ref name=fkpr />  The conservatives were divided into a host of personalist factions and lacked coherent leadership,<ref name=fkpr /> but Bonilla reorganized the conservatives into a \"national party.\"<ref name=fkpr /> The present-day National Party of Honduras (Partido Nacional de Honduras\u2014PNH) traces its origins to his administration.<ref name=fkpr />\n\nBonilla proved to be an even better friend to the banana companies than Sierra.<ref name=fkpr />  Under Bonilla's rule,<ref name=fkpr /> companies gained exemptions from taxes and permission to construct wharves and roads,<ref name=fkpr /> as well as permission to improve interior waterways and to obtain charters for new railroad construction.<ref name=fkpr />  He also successfully established the border with [[Nicaragua]] and resisted an invasion from [[Guatemala]] in 1906.<ref name=fkpr>http://countrystudies.us/honduras/15.htm</ref> After fending off Guatemalan military forces, Bonilla sought peace and signed a friendship pact with both Guatemala and El Salvador.<ref name=fkpr />\n\nNicaragua's president [[Jos\u00e9 Santos Zelaya]] saw this friendship pact as an alliance to counter Nicaragua and began to undermine Bonilla.<ref name=fkpr /> Zelaya supported liberal Honduran exiles in Nicaragua in their efforts to topple Bonilla,<ref name=fkpr /> who had established himself as a dictator.<ref name=fkpr /> Supported by elements of the Nicaraguan army, the exiles invaded Honduras in February 1907.<ref name=fkpr /> With the assistance of Salvadoran troops, Manuel Bonilla tried to resist, but in March his forces were decisively beaten in a battle notable for the introduction of machine guns into Central America.<ref name=fkpr /> After toppling Bonilla, the exiles established a provisional junta,<ref name=fkpr /> but this junta did not last.<ref name=oipnp />\n\nAmerican elites noticed: it was in their interests to contain Zelaya, protect the region of the new [[Panama Canal]], and defend the increasingly important banana trade. This Nicaragua-assisted invasion by Honduran exiles strongly displeased the United States government,<ref name=oipnp>http://countrystudies.us/honduras/16.htm</ref> which concluded that Zelaya wanted to dominate the entire Central American region,<ref name=oipnp /> sent marines to [[Puerto Cortes]] to protect the banana trade.<ref name=oipnp /> US naval units were also sent to Honduras and were able to successfully defend Bonilla's last defense position at [[Amapala]] in the [[Gulf  of Fonseca]]. Through a peace settlement arranged by the US [[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] in [[Tegucigalpa]],<ref name=oipnp />  Bonilla stepped down and the war with Nicaragua came to an end.<ref name=oipnp />\n\nThe settlement also provided for a compromise r\u00e9gime headed by General [[Miguel R. Davila]] in Tegucigalpa.<ref name=oipnp />  Zelaya however was not pleased by the settlement,<ref name=oipnp /> as he strongly distrusted Davila.<ref name=oipnp /> Zelaya made a secret arrangement with El Salvador to oust Davila from office.<ref name=oipnp />  The plan failed to reach fruition,<ref name=oipnp /> but alarmed American stakeholders in Honduras.<ref name=oipnp /> Mexico and the U.S. called the five Central American countries into [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] talks at the [[Central American Peace Conference]] to increase stability in the area.<ref name=oipnp />  At the conference, the five countries signed the [[General Treaty of Peace and Amity of 1907]],<ref name=oipnp /> which established the [[Central American Court of Justice]] to resolve future disputes among the five nations.<ref name=oipnp /> Honduras also agreed to become permanently neutral in any future conflicts among the other nations.<ref name=oipnp />\n\nIn 1908, opponents of Davila made an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow him.<ref name=oipnp /> Despite the failure of this coup, American elites became concerned over Honduran instability.<ref name=oipnp />  The Taft Administration saw the huge Honduran debt, over $120 million,<ref name=oipnp /> as a contributing factor to the instability and began efforts to refinance the largely British debt with provisions for a United States customs receivership or some similar arrangement.<ref name=oipnp />  Negotiations were arranged between Honduran representatives and New York bankers,<ref name=oipnp /> headed by [[J.P. Morgan]].<ref name=oipnp /> By the end of 1909,<ref name=oipnp /> an agreement had been reached providing for a reduction in the debt and the issuance of new 5% [[bond (finance)|bond]]s:<ref name=oipnp /> The bankers would control the Honduran railroad,<ref name=oipnp /> and the United States government would guarantee continued Honduran independence and would take control of custom revenue.<ref name=oipnp />\n\nThe terms proposed by the bankers met with considerable opposition in Honduras,<ref name=oipnp /> further weakening the D\u00e1vila government.<ref name=oipnp /> A treaty incorporating the key provisions of this agreement with J.P. Morgan was finally signed in January 1911 and submitted to the Honduran legislature by D\u00e1vila.<ref name=oipnp /> However, that body, in a rare display of independence, rejected it by a vote of thirty-three to five.<ref name=oipnp />\n\nAn uprising in 1911 against D\u00e1vila interrupted efforts to deal with the debt problem.<ref name=oipnp />  The [[United States Marines]] landed, which forced both sides to meet on a US warship.<ref name=oipnp /> The revolutionaries, headed by former president Manuel Bonilla,<ref name=oipnp /> and the government agreed to a cease-fire and the installation of a provisional president who would be selected by the United States mediator, [[Thomas Cleland Dawson|Thomas Dawson]].<ref name=oipnp /> Dawson selected [[Francisco Bertrand]], who promised to hold early, free elections,<ref name=oipnp /> and D\u00e1vila resigned.<ref name=oipnp />\n\nThe 1912 elections were won by Manuel Bonilla,<ref name=oipnp /> but he died after just over a year in office.<ref name=oipnp /> Bertrand, who had been his vice president, returned to the presidency and in 1916 won election for a term that lasted until 1920.<ref name=oipnp />  Between 1911 and 1920, Honduras saw relative stability.<ref name=oipnp /> Railroads expanded throughout Honduras and the banana trade grew rapidly.<ref name=oipnp /> This stability however would prove to be difficult to maintain in the years following 1920.<ref name=oipnp /> Revolutionary intrigues also continued throughout the period, accompanied by constant rumors that one faction or another was being supported by one of the banana companies.<ref name=oipnp />\n\nThe development of the banana industry contributed to the beginnings of organized labor movements in Honduras and to the first major strikes in the nation's history.<ref name=oipnp />  The first of these occurred in 1917 against the [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]].<ref name=oipnp /> The strike was suppressed by the Honduran military,<ref name=oipnp /> but the following year additional labor disturbances occurred at the [[Standard Fruit Company]]'s holding in La Ceiba.<ref name=oipnp /> In 1920, a general strike hit the Caribbean coast.<ref name=oipnp /> In response, a United States warship was sent to the area, and the Honduran government began arresting leaders.<ref name=oipnp />  When Standard Fruit offered a new wage -- equivalent to US$1.75 per day -- the strike ultimately collapsed.<ref name=oipnp />  Labor troubles in the banana trade however were far from over.<ref name=oipnp />\n\n====The fruit companies' activity====\n{{Main article|Banana production in Honduras}}\nThe Liberal government opted to expand production in mining and agriculture, and in 1876 began granting substantial grants of land and tax exemptions to foreign concerns as well as to local businesses. Mining was particularly important, and the new policies coincided with the growth of banana [[export]]s, which began in the Bay Islands in the 1870s and was pursued on the mainland by small and middling farmers in the 1880s. Liberal concessions allowed U.S.-based concerns to enter the Honduran market, first as shipping companies, then as railroad and banana producing enterprises. The U.S. companies created very large [[Banana production in Honduras|plantations]] worked by labor that flooded into the region from the densely-settled Pacific coast, other Central American countries, and thanks to the company's policies favoring English speaking people, from the [[English-speaking Caribbean]].<ref>Glen Chambers, ''Race, Nation and West Indian Immigration to Honduras, 1890\u20131940'' (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2010).</ref>  The result was an [[enclave economy]] centered on the settlements and activities of the three major companies, Cuyamel Fruit Company, [[Standard Fruit Company|Standard Fruit]] and particularly [[United Fruit Company|United Fruit]] after it absorbed Cuyamel in 1930.\n\nIn 1899, Vaccaro Brothers and Company (later known as [[Standard Fruit Company|Standard Fruit]]),a New Orleans-based fruit corporation, came to Honduras in 1899 to buy coconuts, oranges and bananas on [[Roat\u00e1n]].<ref name=oipnp /> After successfully selling the fruit in New Orleans,<ref name=oipnp /> the company moved to the mainland of Honduras.<ref name=oipnp /> In 1901, Vaccaro Brothers established offices in [[La Ceiba]] and Salado and eventually controlled the banana industry between [[Boca Cerrada]] and [[Balfate]] (an area of about 80 kilometers of coastline).<ref name=oanfavoal />  In 1900, American businessman [[Samuel Zemurray]] and [[United Fruit Company|United Fruit]] came to Honduras to purchase banana plantations.<ref name=oipnp /> In 1905,<ref name=oanfavoal /> Zemurray started buying his own plantations and in 1910, after purchasing {{convert|5,000|acre|km2}} of plantation land in Honduras,<ref name=oqqvoonq>http://www.unitedfruit.org/zemurray.htm</ref> formed his own company, the [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]].<ref name=oqqvoonq /> The two companies' wealth and powerful connections allowed them to gain extraordinary influence in the Honduran government.<ref name=oipnp />\n\nRivalries between the companies, however, escalated in 1910, when the [[United Fruit Company|United Fruit]] came to Honduras to set up operations;<ref name=oipnp /> the company had already been a local producer of bananas in Honduras.<ref name=oipnp /> By 1912, United Fruit had two concessions it had purchased with government approval.<ref name=oipnp />  One was to build a railroad from Tela to Progreso in the Sula Valley,<ref name=oipnp /> and the other was to build a railroad from Trujillo to the city of Juticalpa in Olancho.<ref name=oipnp /> In 1913, United Fruit established the Tela Railroad Company and shortly thereafter a similar subsidiary, the Trujillo Railroad Company;<ref name=oipnp /> these two railroads managed the concessions which the Honduran government granted them.<ref name=oipnp />  Through these two railroad companies, United Fruit dominated the banana trade in Honduras.<ref name=oipnp />\n\nAn 1899 census showed that northern Honduras had been exporting bananas for several years and that over 1,000 people in the region between Puerto Cortes and La Ceiba (and inland as far as San Pedro Sula) were tending bananas, most of them small holders.<ref>Soluri, ''Banana Culture: Agriculture, Consumption, and Environmental Change in Honduras and the United States'' (Austin:  University of Texas Press: 2005)</ref>  The fruit companies received very large concessions of land, often forcing small holders who had been growing and exporting bananas on their land out of business. In addition, they brought in many workers from Jamaica and Belize, both to work on the plantations, but also as lower managers and skilled workers. The companies often favored the West Indian workers because they spoke English and were sometimes better educated than their Honduran counterparts. This perception of foreign occupation, coupled with a growing race-prejudice against the African-descended West Indians, led to considerable tension, as the arrival of the West Indians drove demographic change in the region.<ref>Glen Chambers, Race Nation and West Indian Immigration to Honduras, 1890\u20131940 (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2010).</ref>\n\nThe connection between the wealth of the banana trade and the influence of outsiders, particularly North Americans, led [[O.

Through land subsidies granted to the railroads, they soon came to control vast tracts of the best land along the Caribbean coast. Coastal cities such as [[La Ceiba]], [[Tela]], and Trujillo and towns further inland such as [[El Progreso]] and La Lima became virtual company towns.<ref name=oipnp />\n\nFor the next twenty years, the U.S. government was involved in quelling Central American disputes, insurrections, and revolutions, whether supported by neighboring governments or by United States companies.<ref name=oipnp />  As part of the so-called [[Banana Wars]] all around the Caribbean, Honduras saw the insertion of [[U.S. Army|American troops]] in 1903, 1907, 1911, 1912, 1919, 1924 and 1925.<ref>http://www2.truman.edu/~marc/resources/interventions.html</ref>  For instance, in 1917 the Cuyamel Fruit Company extended its rail lines into disputed Guatemalan territory.<ref name=oipnp />\n\n====Renewed instability (1919\u20131924)====\nIn 1919, it became obvious that [[Francisco Bertrand]] would refuse to allow an open election to choose his successor.<ref name=ipavapnp>http://countrystudies.us/honduras/17.htm</ref> This course of action was opposed by the United States and had little popular support in Honduras.<ref name=ipavapnp /> The local military commander and governor of Tegucigalpa, General [[Rafael L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez]], took the lead in organizing PLH opposition to Bertrand.<ref name=ipavapnp />  L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez also solicited support from the liberal government of Guatemala and even from the conservative regime in Nicaragua.<ref name=ipavapnp />  Bertrand, in turn, sought support from El Salvador.<ref name=ipavapnp />\n\nDetermined to avoid an international conflict, the United States government, after some hesitation, offered to meditate the dispute, hinting to the Honduran president that if he refused the offer, open intervention might follow.<ref name=ipavapnp />  Bertrand promptly resigned and left the country.<ref name=ipavapnp />  The United States ambassador helped install an interim government headed by [[Francisco Bogr\u00e1n]], who promised to hold free elections.  General L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez, who now controlled the military, made it clear that he was determined to be the next president. After considerable negotiation and some confusion, a formula was worked out under which elections were held. L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez won easily in a manipulated election, and in October 1920 he assumed the presidency.<ref name=ipavapnp />\n\nDuring Bogr\u00e1n's brief time in office, he had agreed to a United States proposal to invite a United States financial adviser to Honduras.<ref name=ipavapnp />  Arthur N. Young of the Department of State was selected for this task and began work in Honduras in August 1920, continuing to August 1921.<ref name=ipavapnp />  While there, Young compiled extensive data and made numerous recommendations, even persuading the Hondurans to hire a New York police lieutenant to reorganize their police forces.<ref name=ipavapnp />  Young's investigations clearly demonstrated the desperate need for major financial reforms in Honduras, whose always precarious budgetary situation was considerably worsened by the renewal of revolutionary activities.<ref name=ipavapnp />\n\nIn 1919, for example, the military had spent more than double the amount budgeted for them, accounting for over 57 percent of all federal expenditures.<ref name=ipavapnp />  Young's recommendations for reducing the military budget, however, found little favor with the new L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez administration,<ref name=ipavapnp />  and the government's financial condition remained a major problem.<ref name=ipavapnp />  If anything, continued uprisings against the government and the threat of a renewed Central America conflict made the situation even worse.<ref name=ipavapnp />  From 1919 to 1924, the Honduran government expended US$7.2 million beyond the amount covered by the regular budgets for military operations.<ref name=ipavapnp />\n\n====Coups====\nFrom 1920 through 1923, seventeen uprisings or attempted coups in Honduras contributed to growing United States concern over political instability in Central America.<ref name=ipavapnp /> In August 1922, the presidents of Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador met on the [[USS Tacoma (CL-20)|USS Tacoma]] in the [[Gulf of Fonseca]].<ref name=ipavapnp /> Under the watchful eye of the United States ambassadors to their nations, the presidents pledged to prevent their territories from being used to promote revolutions against their neighbors and issued a call for a general meeting of Central American states in Washington at the end of the year.<ref name=ipavapnp />\n\nThe Washington conference concluded in February with the adoption of the General Treaty of Peace and Amity of 1923, which had eleven supplemental conventions.<ref name=ipavapnp /> The treaty in many ways followed the provisions of the 1907 treaty.<ref name=ipavapnp />  The Central American court was reorganized, reducing the influence of the various governments over its membership.<ref name=ipavapnp /> The clause providing for withholding recognition of revolutionary governments was expanded to preclude recognition of any revolutionary leader, his relatives, or anyone who had been in power six months before or after such an uprising unless the individual's claim to power had been ratified by free elections.<ref name=ipavapnp /> The governments renewed their pledges to refrain from aiding revolutionary movements against their neighbors and to seek peaceful resolution for all outstanding disputes.<ref name=ipavapnp />\n\nThe supplemental conventions covered everything from the promotion of agriculture to armament limitation. One, which remained unratified, provided for [[free trade]] among all of the states except [[Costa Rica]].<ref name=ipavapnp />  The arms limitation agreement set a ceiling on the size of each nation's military forces (2,500 men in the case of Honduras) and included a United States-sponsored pledge to seek foreign assistance in establishing more professional armed forces.<ref name=ipavapnp />\n\nThe October 1923 Honduran presidential elections and subsequent political and military conflicts provided the first real tests of these new treaty arrangements.<ref name=ipavapnp /> Under heavy pressure from Washington, L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez allowed an unusually open campaign and election. The long-fragmented conservatives reunited as the National Party of Honduras (Partido Nacional de Honduras\u2014PNH),<ref name=ipavapnp /> which ran as its candidate General [[Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino]],<ref name=ipavapnp /> the governor of the department of Cort\u00e9s.<ref name=ipavapnp />\n\nThe liberal PLH was unable to unite around a single candidate and split into two dissident groups, one supporting former president [[Policarpo Bonilla]],<ref name=ipavapnp /> the other advancing the candidacy of [[Juan Angel Arias Boquin|Juan Angel Arias]]. As a result, no candidate secured a majority.<ref name=ipavapnp /> Car\u00edas received the greatest number of votes, with Bonilla second and Arias a distant third.<ref name=ipavapnp /> Under the terms of the Honduran constitution, this stalemate left the final choice of president up to the legislature, but that body was unable to obtain a [[quorum]] and reach a decision.<ref name=ipavapnp />\n\nIn January 1924, L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez announced his intention to remain in office until new elections could be held, but he repeatedly refused to specify a date for the elections.<ref name=ipavapnp /> Car\u00edas, reportedly with the support of United Fruit,<ref name=ipavapnp /> declared himself president, and an armed conflict broke out.<ref name=ipavapnp />  In February the United States, warning that recognition would be withheld from anyone coming to power by revolutionary means, suspended relations with the L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez government for its failure to hold elections.<ref name=ipavapnp />\n\nConditions rapidly deteriorated in the early months of 1924.<ref name=ipavapnp /> On 28 February, a pitched battle took place in La Ceiba between government troops and rebels.<ref name=ipavapnp /> Even the presence of the [[USS_Denver_(CL-16)|USS Denver]] and the landing of a force of [[United States Marines]] were unable to prevent widespread looting and arson resulting in over US$2 million in property damage.<ref name=ipavapnp /> Fifty people, including a United States citizen, were killed in the fighting.<ref name=ipavapnp />  In the weeks that followed, additional vessels from the United States Navy Special Service Squadron were concentrated in Honduran waters, and landing parties put ashore to protect United States interests.<ref name=ipavapnp /> One force of marines and sailors was dispatched inland to Tegucigalpa to provide additional protection for the United States legation.<ref name=ipavapnp /> Shortly before the arrival of the force, L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez died, and what authority remained with the central government was being exercised by his cabinet.

Large areas, including most of those around Trujillo, were abandoned, and thousands of Hondurans were thrown out of work.<ref name=richca /> By 1937 a means of controlling the disease had been found, but many of the affected areas remained out of production because a significant share of the market formerly held by Honduras had shifted to other nations.<ref name=richca />\n\nCar\u00edas had made efforts to improve the military even before he became president.<ref name=richca /> Once in office, both his capacity and his motivation to continue and to expand such improvements increased. He gave special attention to the fledgling air force, founding the Military Aviation School in 1934 and arranging for a United States colonel to serve as its commandant.<ref name=richca />\n\nAs months passed, Car\u00edas moved slowly but steadily to strengthen his hold on power.<ref name=richca /> He gained the support of the banana companies through opposition to strikes and other labor disturbances.<ref name=richca /> He strengthened his position with domestic and foreign financial circles through conservative economic policies. Even in the height of the depression, he continued to make regular payments on the Honduran debt,<ref name=richca /> adhering strictly to the terms of the arrangement with the British bondholders and also satisfying other creditors.<ref name=richca /> Two small loans were paid off completely in 1935.<ref name=richca />\n\nPolitical controls were instituted slowly under Car\u00edas.<ref name=richca /> The [[Communist Party of Honduras]] (Partido Comunista de Honduras\u2014PCH) was outlawed,<ref name=richca /> but the PLH continued to function,<ref name=richca /> and even the leaders of a small

and internal order, Car\u00edas began to crack down on the opposition press and political activities.<ref name=richca /> Meanwhile, the PNH, at the president's direction, began a propaganda campaign stressing that only keeping Car\u00edas in office could give the nation continued peace and order.<ref name=richca /> The constitution, however, prohibited immediate reelection of presidents.<ref

Earlier constituent assemblies had written thirteen constitutions (only ten of which had entered into force), and the latest had been adopted in 1924.<ref name=richca /> The handpicked [[Honduran_Constituent_Assembly_election,_1936|Constituent Assembly]] of 1936 incorporated thirty of the articles of the 1924 document into the 1936 constitution.<ref name=richca />\n\nThe major changes were the elimination of the prohibition on immediate reelection of a president and vice president and lengthening the presidential term from four years to six.<ref name=richca /> Other changes included restoration of the death penalty,<ref name=richca /> reductions in the powers of the legislature, and denial of citizenship to women, and therefore also of the right to vote.<ref name=richca

(to 1949).<ref name=richca />\n\nThe PLH and other opponents of the government reacted to these changes by attempting to overthrow Car\u00edas.<ref name=richca /> Numerous coup attempts in 1936 and

Others, including the leader of the PLH, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Huete, had fled into exile.<ref name=richca />\n\nDuring his presidency, Car\u00edas cultivated close relations with his fellow Central American dictators,<ref name=richca /> generals [[Jorge Ubico]] in Guatemala, [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez]] in El Salvador, and [[Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda]] in Nicaragua.<ref

Car\u00edas and Somoza managed to keep this dispute under control throughout the 1930s and 1940s.<ref name=richca />\n\nThe value of these ties became somewhat questionable in 1944 when popular

[[Capital punishment]] was abolished in 1956, though Honduras hadn't had an execution since 1940. Constituent assembly elections in 1957 appointed [[Ram\u00f3n Villeda Morales|Ram\u00f3n Villeda]] as president, and the constituent assembly itself became a [[Congress of Honduras|national Congress]] with a 6-year term. The [[Liberal Party of Honduras]] (PLH) held power in 1957\u201363. The military began to become a professional institution independent of politics, with the newly created military academy graduating its first class in 1960. In October 1963, conservative military officers preempted constitutional elections and deposed [[Ram\u00f3n Villeda Morales]] in a bloody coup. These officers exiled PLH members and governed under General [[Oswaldo L\u00f3pez Arellano|Oswaldo L\u00f3pez]] until 1970.\n\nIn July 1969, [[El Salvador]] invaded Honduras in the short [[Football War]].

This time he adopted more progressive policies, including [[land reform]].\n\nL\u00f3pez' successors continued armed forces modernization, building army and security forces, concentrating on Honduran air force superiority over its neighbors. During the governments of General [[Juan Alberto Melgar Castro]] (1975\u201378) and General [[Policarpo Paz Garc\u00eda]] (1978\u201382), Honduras built most of its physical infrastructure and electricity and terrestrial telecommunications systems, both state monopolies. The country experienced economic growth during this period, with greater international demand for its products and increased availability of foreign commercial capital.\n\n===Constituent assembly (1980)===\nIn 1979, the country returned to civilian rule. A constituent assembly was popularly elected in April 1980 and general elections were held in November 1981.

The Reina administration successfully increased civilian control over the armed forces and transferred the national police from military to civilian authority. In 1996, Reina named his own defense minister, breaking the precedent of accepting the nominee of the armed forces leadership.\n\nHis administration substantially increased Central Bank net international reserves, reduced [[inflation]] to 12.8% a year, restored a better pace of economic growth (about 5% in 1997), and held down spending to achieve a 1.1% non-financial public sector deficit in 1997.\n\nThe [[Liberal Party of Honduras]] (PLH)'s [[Carlos Roberto Flores]] took office 27 January 1998 as Honduras' fifth democratically-elected president since free elections were restored in 1981, with a 10% margin over his main opponent, [[National Party of Honduras|PNH]] nominee [[Nora G\u00fanera de Melgar]], widow of former leader [[Juan Alberto Melgar Castro|Juan Alberto Melgar]]). Flores inaugurated [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) programs of reform and modernization of the Honduran government and economy, with emphasis on maintaining the country's fiscal health and improving international competitiveness.\n\nIn October 1998, [[Hurricane Mitch]] devastated Honduras, leaving more than 5,000 people dead and 1.5&nbsp;million displaced.

On 27 June, a day before the election, Zelaya followed by a big group of supporters entered the base and ordered, as Commanding Officer of the Armed Forces, for the ballots and polls to be returned to him. The congress saw this as abuse of power and ordered his capture.\n\nOn 28 June 2009, the military [[2009 Honduran political crisis|removed]] Zelaya from office and deported him to Costa Rica, a neutral country. [[Elvin Santos]], the vice-president during the start of Zelaya's term, had resigned in order to run for president in the coming elections, and by presidential line of succession the head of Congress, [[Roberto Micheletti]], was appointed president. However, due to the stance taken by the United Nations and the Organization of American States on use of military force to depose a president, most countries in the region and in the world continued to recognize Zelaya as the President of Honduras and denounced the actions as an assault on democracy .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-06-28-voa22.cfm|title=Honduran President Ousted by Military|last=Bowman|first=Michael|date=28 June 2009|website=VOANews.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717061715/http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-06-28-voa22.cfm|archivedate=17 July 2009|accessdate=11 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nHonduras continued to be ruled by Micheletti's administration under strong foreign pressure.

Honduras borders the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the North [[Pacific Ocean]]. [[Guatemala]] lies to the west, [[Nicaragua]] south east and [[El Salvador]] to the south west. Honduras is the second largest Central American republic, with a total area of {{convert|112,890|km2}}.\n\nHonduras has a {{convert|700|km|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} Caribbean coastline extending from the mouth of the [[R\u00edo Motagua]] in the west to the mouth of the [[R\u00edo Coco]] in the east, at [[Cape Gracias a Dios]]. The {{cvt|922|km}} southeastern side of the triangle is a land border with Nicaragua. It follows the R\u00edo Coco near the Caribbean Sea and then extends southwestward through mountainous terrain to the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] on the Pacific Ocean. The southern apex of the triangle is a {{cvt|153|km}} coastline on the Gulf Fonseca, which opens onto the Pacific Ocean. In the west there are two land borders: with [[El Salvador]] as {{cvt|342|km|mi|adj=mid|long}} and with Guatemala as {{cvt|256|km|mi|adj=mid|long}}.\n\n==Topography==\n[[Image:Honduras Topography.png|thumb|550px|Honduras' topography.]]\nHonduras has three distinct topographical regions: an extensive interior highland area and two narrow coastal lowlands. The interior, which constitutes approximately 80 percent of the country's terrain, is mountainous. The larger Caribbean lowlands in the north and the Pacific lowlands bordering the Gulf of Fonseca are characterized by [[alluvial plains]].\n\n===Interior highlands===\nThe interior highlands are the most prominent feature of Honduran topography. This mountain area makes up about 80% of the country's area, and is home to the majority of the population. Because the rugged terrain has made the land difficult to traverse and equally difficult to cultivate, this area has not been highly developed. The soil here is poor: Honduras lacks the rich volcanic ash found in other Central American countries. Until the early 20th century, the highland economy consisted primarily of mining and livestock.\n\nIn the west, Honduras' mountains blend into the mountain ranges of Guatemala. The western mountains have the highest peaks, with the Pico Congol\u00f3n at an elevation of {{convert|2,500|m|ft|0}} and the [[Cerro Las Minas]] at {{cvt|2,850|m|ft|0}}. The Honduran border with El Salvador crosses the peak of [[Cerro El Pital]], the highest point in El Salvador at over {{cvt|2700|m|ft|0}}. These mountains are woodland covered with mainly pine forests.\n\nIn the east, the mountains merge with those in Nicaragua. Although generally not as high as the mountains near the Guatemalan border, the eastern ranges possess some high peaks, such as the Monta\u00f1a de la Flor at {{cvt|2,300|m|ft|0}}, El Boquer\u00f3n (Monte El Boquer\u00f3n) at {{cvt|2,485|m|ft|0}}, and Pepe Bonito at {{cvt|2,435|m|ft|0}}.\n\nOne of the most prominent features of the interior highlands is a depression that runs from the Caribbean Sea to the Gulf of Fonseca. This depression splits the country's [[cordillera]]s into eastern and western parts and provides a relatively easy transportation route across the isthmus. Widest at its northern end near San Pedro Sula, the depression narrows as it follows the upper course of the R\u00edo Humuya. Passing first through Comayagua and then through narrow passes south of the city, the depression widens again as it runs along the border of El Salvador into the Gulf of Fonseca.\n\n[[Image:Honduras econ 1983.jpg|thumb|550px|A economic activity map of Honduras, 1983.]]\n[[Image:Honduras land 1983.jpg|thumb|550px|A land use map of Honduras, 1983.]]\nScattered throughout the interior highlands are numerous flat-floored valleys, at {{convert|300|to|900 |meters}} in elevation, which vary in size. The floors of the large valleys provide sufficient grass, shrubs, and dry woodland to support livestock and, in some cases, commercial agriculture. [[Subsistence agriculture]] has been relegated to the slopes of the valleys, with the limitations of small-sized holdings, primitive technology, and low productivity that traditionally accompany hillside cultivation. Villages and towns, including the capital, Tegucigalpa, are tucked in the larger valleys.\n\nVegetation in the interior highlands is varied. Much of the western, southern, and central mountains are open woodland; supporting pine forest interspersed with some oak, scrub, and grassy clearings. The ranges toward the east are primarily continuous areas of dense, broad-leaf evergreen forest. Around the highest peaks, remnants of dense rainforest that formerly covered much of the area are still found.\n\n===Caribbean lowlands===\n\nThis area of river valleys and coastal plains, which most Honduras call \"the north coast,\" or simply \"the coast,\" has traditionally been Honduras's most exploited region. The central part of the Caribbean lowlands, east of La Ceiba, is a narrow coastal plain only a few kilometers wide.\n\nTo the east and west of this section the Caribbean lowlands widen and in places extend inland a considerable distance along broad river valleys. The broadest river valley, along the [[R\u00edo Ul\u00faa]] near the Guatemalan border, is Honduras's most developed area. Both [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]], the country's largest port, and [[San Pedro Sula]], Honduras's industrial capital, are located here, as is [[La Ceiba]], the third largest city in the country.\n\nTo the east, near the Nicaraguan border, the Caribbean lowlands broaden to an extensive area known as [[La Mosquitia]]. Unlike the western part of the Caribbean lowlands, the Mosquitia is Honduras's least-developed area. Underpopulated and culturally distinct from the rest of the country, the area consists of inland savannah with swamps and [[mangrove]] near the coast. During times of heavy rainfall, much of the savannah area is covered by shallow water, making transportation by means other than a shallow-draft boat almost impossible.\n\nMore than 46 ''campesinos'' from the Agu\u00e1n Valley, in the far north-east of Honduras, have either been killed or have disappeared since the 2009 coup.<ref name=nation>\n{{cite news\n|title= WikiLeaks Honduras: US Linked to Brutal Businessman\n|url= https://www.thenation.com/article/wikileaks-honduras-us-linked-brutal-businessman/\n|date=October 21, 2011\n|author=Dana Frank\n|publisher=The Nation\n}}</ref> In the 1970s, government policy encouraged agricultural cooperatives and collectives to establish themselves in the lightly-populated area, but after 1992 government policy favored privatization.<ref name=nation /> One of the biggest beneficiaries of the new policy and one of the richest men in Honduras,<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-miguel-facusse-20150624-story.html\n|title=Miguel Facusse dies at 90; colorful, ruthless Honduran tycoon\n|date=June 23, 2015\n|author=Tracy Wilkinson\n}}\n</ref> [[Miguel Facuss\u00e9 Barjum|Miguel Facuss\u00e9]], owned some {{cvt|22,000|acres|ha}} in the lower Agu\u00e1n, which he planted in African palms for his palm oil venture.\n\n===Pacific lowlands===\nThe smallest geographic region of Honduras, the Pacific lowlands, is a strip of land averaging {{cvt|25|km|mi|spell=in|disp=x| wide (|)}} on the north shore of the Gulf of Fonseca. The land is flat, becoming swampy near the shores of the gulf, and is composed mostly of alluvial soils washed down from the mountains. The gulf is shallow and the water rich in fish and [[mollusk]]s. Mangroves along the shore make [[shrimp]] and [[shellfish]] particularly abundant by providing safe and abundant breeding areas amid their extensive networks of underwater roots.\n\nSeveral islands in the gulf fall under Honduras's jurisdiction. The two largest, Zacate Grande and El Tigre, are eroded volcanoes, part of the chain of volcanoes that extends along the Pacific coast of Central America. Both islands have volcanic cones more than {{cvt|700|meters}} in elevation that serve as landmarks for vessels entering Honduras's Pacific.\n\n===Islands===\n{{See also|List of islands of Honduras}}\n\nHonduras controls a number of islands as part of its offshore territories. In the Caribbean Sea, the islands of Roat\u00e1n (Isla de Roat\u00e1n), Utila, and Guanaja together form the ''[[Islas de la Bah\u00eda]]'' (Bay Islands), one of the eighteen departments into which Honduras is divided. [[Roat\u00e1n]], the largest of the three islands, is {{convert|50|by|5|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}}. The Islas de la Bah\u00eda archipelago also has a number of smaller islands, among them the islets of Barbareta (Isla Barbareta), Santa Elena (Isla Santa Elena), and Morat (Isla Morat).\n\nFarther out in the Caribbean are the Islas Santanillas, formerly known as Swan Islands. A number of small islands and keys can be found nearby, among them Cayos Zapotillos and Cayos Cochinos. In the Gulf of Fonseca, the main islands under Honduran control are El Tigre, Zacate Grande (Isla Zacate Grande), and Exposici\u00f3n (Isla Exposici\u00f3n).\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Honduras K\u00f6ppen.svg|250px|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification system|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] of Honduras]]\n\nThe climatic types of each of the three physiographic regions differ. The Caribbean lowlands have a tropical wet climate with consistently high temperatures and humidity, and rainfall fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. The Pacific lowlands have a tropical wet and dry climate with high temperatures but a distinct dry season from November through April. The interior highlands also have a distinct dry season, but, as is characteristic of a tropical highland climate, temperatures in this region decrease as elevation increases.\n\nUnlike in more northerly latitudes, temperatures in the tropics vary primarily with elevation instead of with the season. Land below {{convert|1,000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} is commonly known as ''tierra caliente'' (hot land), between {{cvt|1000|and|2000|m|ft|0}} as ''tierra templada'' (temperate land), and above {{cvt|2,000|m|ft|0}} as ''tierra fr\u00eda'' (cold land). Both the Caribbean and Pacific lowlands are ''tierra caliente'', with daytime highs averaging between {{convert|28|and|32|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} throughout the year.\n\nIn the Pacific lowlands, April, the last month of the dry season, brings the warmest temperatures; the rainy season is slightly cooler, although higher humidity during the rainy season makes these months feel more uncomfortable. In the Caribbean lowlands, the only relief from the year-round heat and humidity comes during December or January when an occasional strong cold front from the north (a ''norte'') brings several days of strong northwest winds and slightly cooler temperatures.\n\nThe interior highlands range from tierra templada to tierra fr\u00eda. [[Tegucigalpa]], in a sheltered valley and at an elevation of {{cvt|1,000|m|ft|0}}, has a pleasant climate, with an average high temperature ranging from {{convert|30|\u00b0C}} in April, the warmest month, to {{convert|25|\u00b0C}} in January, the coolest. Above {{convert|2,000|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, temperatures can fall to near freezing at night, and frost sometimes occurs.\n\nRain falls year round in the Caribbean lowlands but is seasonal throughout the rest of the country. Amounts are copious along the north coast, especially in the Mosquitia, where the average rainfall is {{convert|2,400|mm|in|1|sp=us}}. Nearer San Pedro Sula, amounts are slightly less from November to April, but each month still has considerable precipitation. The interior highlands and Pacific lowlands have a dry season, known locally as \"summer,\" from November to April. Almost all the rain in these regions falls during the \"winter,\" from May to September. Total yearly amounts depend on surrounding topography; Tegucigalpa, in a sheltered valley, averages only {{cvt|1,000|mm|in|1}} of precipitation.\n\n=== Hurricanes ===\nHonduras lies within the hurricane belt, and the Caribbean coast is particularly vulnerable to hurricanes or tropical storms that travel inland from the Caribbean. Hurricane Francelia in 1969 and Tropical Storm Alleta in 1982 affected thousands of people and caused extensive damage to crops. [[Hurricane Fifi]] in 1974 killed more than 8,000 and destroyed nearly the entire banana crop.\n\nIn 1998 [[Hurricane Mitch]] became the most deadly hurricane to strike the Western Hemisphere in the last two centuries. This massive hurricane not only battered the Honduran coastline, but engulfed nearly the entire country with its powerful winds and torrential downpours. Throughout Central America, Mitch claimed in excess of 11,000 lives, with thousands of others missing. More than three million people were either homeless or severely affected. Most Hurricanes occasionally form over the Pacific and move north to affect southern Honduras, but Pacific storms are generally less severe and their landfall rarer.\n\nOn September 4, 2007, [[Hurricane Felix]] made landfall at Honduras and Nicaragua, as a Category 5 hurricane. In November 2008, [[Hurricane Paloma]], along with the [[October 2008 Central America floods]], left at least 60 people dead and more than 300,000 in need of assistance.<ref>{{cite web |agency= United Nations News Service |publisher=ReliefWeb |date= November 18, 2008 |accessdate= May 21, 2015 |title= Hondurans face many months of struggle after deadly floods, UN aid wing says |url= http://reliefweb.int/report/honduras/hondurans-face-many-months-struggle-after-deadly-floods-un-aid-wing-says }}</ref>\n\n==Hydrography==\n{{Main article|Rivers of Honduras}}\n\n[[File:Barra-de-los-rios-ulua y chamelecon.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[Ul\u00faa River]] as seen from the air. The Ulua is perhaps the most economically important river in Honduras.]]\nHonduras is a water-rich country. The most important river in Honduras is the [[Ul\u00faa River|Ul\u00faa]], which flows {{cvt|400|km}} to the Caribbean through the economically important Valle de Sula. Numerous other rivers drain the interior highlands and empty north into the Caribbean. These other rivers are important, not as transportation routes, but because of the broad fertile valleys they have produced.  The [[Choluteca River]] runs south from [[Tegucigalpa]] through [[Choluteca, Choluteca|Choluteca]] and out at the [[Gulf of Fonseca]].\n\nRivers also define about half of Honduras's international borders. The [[R\u00edo Goascor\u00e1n]], flowing to the [[Gulf of Fonseca]], and the [[R\u00edo Lempa]] define part of the border between El Salvador and Honduras. The [[R\u00edo Coco|Coco River]] marks about half of the border between Nicaragua and Honduras.\n\nDespite an abundance of rivers, large bodies of water are rare. Lago de Yojoa, located in the west-central part of the country, is the sole natural lake in Honduras. This lake is twenty-two kilometers long and at its widest point measures fourteen kilometers. Several large, brackish lagoons open onto the Caribbean in northeast Honduras. These shallow bodies of water allow limited transportation to points along the coast.\n\n==Statistics==\n* ''total area:'' {{cvt|112,090|km2}}\n** ''land:'' {{cvt|111,890|km2}}\n** ''water:'' {{cvt|200|km2}}\n* total land boundaries: {{cvt|1,575|km}}\n:''border countries:''\n* Guatemala {{cvt|244|km}}, \n* El Salvador {{cvt|391|km}}, \n* Nicaragua {{cvt|940|km}}\n* coastline: {{cvt|832|km}}\n* Maritime claims:\n* territorial sea: {{cvt|12|nmi|km mi|1|lk=in}}\n**contiguous zone: {{cvt|24|nmi|km mi|1}}\n**exclusive economic zone: {{cvt|200|nmi|km mi|1}}\n**continental shelf: natural extension of territory or to {{cvt|200|nmi|km mi|1}}\n* Lowest point: Caribbean Sea 0 m\n* Highest point: [[Cerro Las Minas]] {{cvt|2,870|m}}\n:land use:\n* arable land: 9.12%\n* permanent crops: 4.07%\n* other: 86.82% (2012 est.)\n* Irrigated land: {{cvt|878.5|km}} (2007)\n* Total renewable water resources: {{cvt|95.93|km3}} (2011)\n* Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):\n**total: {{cvt|2.12|km3}} per year (16%/23%/61%)\n**per capita: {{cvt|295.6|m3}} per year (2006)\n\n==Natural resources==\nThe natural resources include: [[timbers]], [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[iron ore]], [[antimony]], [[coal]], [[fish]], and [[hydropower]] from the mountain rivers.\n\n==Natural hazards==\nFrequent mild [[earthquake]]s, damaging [[hurricanes]], and floods along the [[Caribbean]] coast are examples of Honduran natural hazards.\n\n==Environmental issues==\n[[Deforestation]] resulting from [[logging]] is especially rampant in [[Olancho Department]]. The clearing of land for agriculture is especially prevalent in the largely undeveloped [[La Mosquitia]] region, causing [[land degradation]] and soil erosion.\n\nThere is population movement [[Peasant|of the rural poor out of the countryside]] and into the urban centers.\n\nMining activities pollute [[Lake Yojoa]] with [[heavy metals]] which is Honduras largest source of fresh water. Some rivers and streams are also polluted by mining. [[Hurricane Mitch]] caused severe damage in 1998.\n\n===International agreements===\nHonduras has signed and ratified agreements on [[Biodiversity]], [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol]], [[Desertification]], [[Endangered Species]], [[Hazardous Wastes]], [[Law of the Sea]], [[Marine Dumping]], [[Ozone Layer Protection]], [[Tropical Timber 83]], [[Tropical Timber 94]], and [[Wetlands]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Honduras]]\n*[[List of places in Honduras]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{loc}}\n*{{CIA World Factbook}}\n\n{{Honduras topics}}\n{{Geography of North America}}\n{{North America topic|Climate of}}\n\n{{coord|15|00|N|86|30|W|type:country|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Geography Of Honduras}}\n[[Category:Geography of Honduras| ]]", "sha1": "brszo9q0cj5kb1buqrie1syqzsxqggn"}}, {"title": "Demographics of Honduras", "ns": "0", "id": "13397", "revision": {"id": "862498225", "parentid": "815199771", "timestamp": "2018-10-04T19:32:30Z", "contributor": {"ip": "63.97.8.87"}, "comment": "/* Other ethnicities */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Copan village, in departmento de Cop\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|300px|A village in [[Cop\u00e1n]].]]\n[[File:Talanga road Honduras.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Talanga]] road, Honduras.]]\nThis article is about the [[ethnic group]]s and population of [[Honduras]].\n\n==Population==\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source: INE <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.gob.hn/index.php/datos-y-estadisticas/estadisticas-sociales-y-demograficas/poblacion-y-demografia/76-composicion-y-distribucion-de-la-poblacion|title=Gobierno suma a 152 microempresarias en Pimienta, Cort\u00e9s|first=Eduardo|last=cruz|website=www.ine.gob.hn}}</ref>\n|title       = Census population and average annual growth rate\n|percentages =\n|1791 | 96421\n|1801 | 128453\n|1881 | 307289\n|1887 | 331917\n|1895 | 398877\n|1901 | 543741\n|1905 | 500136\n|1910 | 553446\n|1916 | 605997\n|1926 | 700811\n|1930 | 854184\n|1935 | 962000\n|1940 | 1107859\n|1945 | 1200542\n|1950 | 1368605\n|1961 | 1884765\n|1988 | 4614377\n|2001 | 6535344\n|2013 | \n}}\n\nAccording to {{UN_Population|source}} the total population was {{UN_Population|Honduras}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to 1,487,000 in 1950 (a fivefold increase in 60 years).

The [[President of Honduras]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[National Congress of Honduras]].  The party system is dominated by the conservative [[National Party of Honduras]] and the [[Liberal Party of Honduras]].\nThe [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nThe 1981 [[Constitution of Honduras]] provides for a fairly strong executive in some ways, but many powers conceded to the executive elsewhere are designated duties of the unicameral [[National Congress of Honduras|National Congress]]. A [[judiciary]] is appointed by the National Congress.\n\nThat [[constitution]] delineates mechanisms for amending it, but it also declares eight articles immutable and unalterable and not subject to change, which include a guarantee of a republican form of government, and an explicit prohibition against presidential candidacy of anyone who has been president previously at any time or for any reason.\n\nThe [[constitution]] also provides for an independent organ to supervise and implement elections, the Superior Electoral Tribunal. Another organ similarly independent of the three main branches of government a Special Court for Resolution of Conflicts Between Branches of Government.\n\nThe [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] has rated Honduras as \"[[Democracy Index#Classification definitions|hybrid regime]]\" in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex2016|title=Democracy Index 2016 - The Economist Intelligence Unit|last=solutions|first=EIU digital|website=www.eiu.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Executive branch===\n{{main| Executive branch of the government of Honduras}}\n{{office-table}}\n|[[President of Honduras|President]]\n|[[Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez]]\n|[[National Party of Honduras|National Party]]\n|27 January 2014\n|}\nThe president is both the chief of state and head of government and is elected by popular vote for a four-year term with no possibility of re-election. In the most recent election, however, President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez was reelected despite national protest and dispute over ballots, after The Supreme court voided a single-term limit for the country\u2019s presidency in 2015.\n\n===Legislative branch===\nThe [[National Congress of Honduras]] ''(Congreso Nacional)'' has 128 members ''(diputados)'', elected for a four-year term by [[proportional representation]]; congressional seats are assigned the parties' candidates on a [[Departments of Honduras|departmental]] basis in proportion to the number of votes each party receives.\n\n===Judicial branch===\nThe judiciary includes a [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] of Justice - the [[Supreme Court of Honduras]], courts of appeal, and several courts of original jurisdiction &ndash; such as labor, tax, and criminal courts.

Country Studies</ref>\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nFor administrative purposes, Honduras is divided into [[Departments of Honduras|18 departments]], with departmental and municipal officials selected for four-year terms.\n\n===Political Parties===\n{{elect|List of political parties in Honduras|Elections in Honduras}}\nHonduras has six registered political parties:\n\n* [[Liberal Party of Honduras]] (''Partido Liberal de Honduras\u2014PLH''), founded 1891.\n* [[National Party of Honduras]] (''Partido Nacional de Honduras\u2014PNH''), founded 1918.

The early 1980s were a relatively peaceful period compared to other countries in Central America buffeted by left-wing guerrillas. The Honduran government provided bases for U.S. backed counter-revolutionary armies operating in Nicaragua.\n\nBetween 1981 and 1984, several forced disappearances were carried out by the military, as proved before the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]].<ref>[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/iachr/C/4-ing.html] Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez Case, Judgment of July 29, 1988, Inter-Am Ct.

Allegations of human rights abuses, and summary executions by police\u2014especially of street gangs\u2014have diminished steadily in recent years up to the present (2009), while political violence has been a constant.\n\n[[Rafael Callejas]] became president in 1990 and introduced [[neo-liberal]] economic reforms and austerity measures. He is credited with a major push to improve the country's transportation [[infrastructure]]. He implemented a policy of requiring cabinet member nominees to first pass appropriate examinations, unique among politicians anywhere.\n\nIn 1993, the Liberal Party's [[Carlos Roberto Reina|Carlos Reina]] was elected president, promising to reform the judicial system and limit the power of the armed forces. In April 1995 compulsory military service was abolished. The Liberal Party's [[Carlos Roberto Flores]] Facuss\u00e9  was elected in 1997, also promising to restructure the armed forces; in 1999 the armed forces were brought under civilian control.\n\nIn 2001, [[Ricardo Maduro]] was elected president on a platform that promised to stop rampant [[inflation]] afflicting the nation, and to put a stop to the brutal trademark violence of street gangs. At the time, the abuse of child-protection laws by gangs recruiting minors, and aggressive recruitment of members under threat of violence, lent broad popular support for Maduro's enlistment of the armed forces for a greater role in fighting crime during this time, as the police were seen as overwhelmed.<ref>See a timeline of Honduran political history including events affecting same at [http://timelines.ws/countries/HONDURAS.HTML  \"timeline: Honduras\"]. \nSee another from a leftist perspective, here: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1225471.stm \"Timeline: Honduras\"], BBC news...\n</ref>\n\n===Gang violence===\nA major political issues in Honduras since about 1990 has been the high level of violent crime associated with the ''maras'' (Spanish for gangs, predominantly of young people), and drug trafficking organizations involved in the transport of [[cocaine]] from South America to the United States. Although gangs existed in Tegucigalpa in the 1980s, the phenomenon exploded around 1990. The range of criminal activities that street gangs carry out is broad, from kidnapping and [[human trafficking]] to drug, auto and weapons smuggling, as well as domestic [[extortion]].<ref>[http://scm.oas.org/pdfs/2010/cp23852-12.pdf]</ref> A recent estimate by the. FBI and their counterparts in Central America{{who|date=August 2017}} put the number of gang members in Honduras at 36,000.<ref>[http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/democracy/gangs_cam.pdf.]</ref>\n\nGang membership is partly attributable to population movement between Honduras and the United States. During the 1980s, many Hondurans fled to the US to avoid civil war and strife, and [[emigration]] continued for economic reasons after that. Other than civil war, high rates of poverty and unemployment and lack of education make at-risk youth more vulnerable to gangs. In Honduras, close to 30% of the population is aged 15\u201324.<ref>Seelke 2010</ref>\n\nImmigrant children who formed or joined urban gangs in cities such as Los Angeles began to have an impact in Honduras around 1990 because gang members completing prison sentences were deported. Deportees brought the two main gangs in Honduras, [[MS-13]] and the [[18th Street gang]].<ref name=USAID>USAID, ''Central America and Mexico Gang Assessment, [http://www.usaid.gov/locations/latin_america_caribbean/democracy/honduras_profile.pdf Annex 3: Honduras Profile]'', 2006; especially page 5.</ref> In 2004, the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]'s Office of Immigration and Enforcement reported that Honduras received 2,345 total criminal deportations. However, it is unclear how many were gang-affiliated.\n\nAlmost a third of Hondurans feel a sense of insecurity related to crime.{{when|date=August 2017}} The report listed as causes and risk factors, \"Lack of opportunities and alternatives for youth and adolescents, family breakdown, movement of Hondurans to and from the United States, and abuse of drugs and alcohol, and presence of weapons\".<ref name=USAID />\n\nHowever, the \"[[departamento]]\" with more weapons per person than anywhere else in the nation, [[Olancho]], is the only area with no gang presence at all.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe report adds however, that the \"overwhelming attention given to gang violence by the media and the government\" is partly responsible. Gang members often compete to see which crime receives the most coverage.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} It has been recently contended though that the media tends to exaggerate the gang problem, thus making Hondurans believe their communities less secure than they really are,<ref>[http://www.ansarilawfirm.com/docs/CRS-Report-Gangs-in-Central-America-1-11-2007.pdf]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=December 2017}}, because of the extreme violence that accompanies the crimes perpetrated by these gangs. Another reason for the attention is that they most affect the lower-income population disproportionately, and almost all areas of public activities were affected.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe murder rate in 1999 was 154 murders per 100,000; around 2005 this had fallen to 49 per 100,000. (The death rate from all causes is roughly 1000 per 100,000 population.)<ref>1000 per 100,000 population is a very rough estimate based on 1.2% annual population growth and a life expectancy of 70 years. Although street gangs do play a significant role in this high rate, organized crime, drug trafficking and social violence are other factors that contribute as well. The local police have been suspected in extrajudicial killings of street children as a form of social cleansing, to combat the growing gang numbers.  The USAID quote and murder rate are from USAID, ''Honduras Profile'', op cit.</ref> Most of the crime in Honduras takes place in the big cities of Tegucigalpa and [[San Pedro Sula]]. A survey by [[Mitchell A. Seligson]] in 2004 found that 18% of the population thought public security and violence &ndash; delinquency, crime, violence, drug trafficking, and gangs &ndash; were the most serious problem facing the country.<ref>Seligson survey cited in USAID, ''Honduras Profile'', op cit.</ref>\n\nHonduras has been not only a transit point for cocaine running between [[Colombia]] and the United States, a pattern broken substantially after the arrest and exile of the ex-president [[Mel Zelaya]], {{citation needed|date=December 2017}} but also has an internal market, creating all sorts of inner-city problems. Gangs sell [[Cocaine|crack]], commit other crimes, and hire themselves out to organised drug smugglers. Those engaged in international trafficking are better resourced than the state authorities combating them. Although gang members have been arrested for selling drugs at the street level, it is still unclear how much interaction they have with the larger drug cartels and their operations within Honduras.<ref>[http://www.nationalgangcenter.gov/Content/Documents/History-of-Street-Gangs.pdf]</ref>\n\nSome{{who|date=December 2017}} would use this argument to justify increasing US [[military]] aid to Honduras to help fight the organised drug gangs, while others{{who|date=December 2017}} claim that Honduras would be better off legalizing drugs, thus avoiding military solutions to Honduran security problems. A recent form of U.S. aid that addresses the gang problem was the creation of the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), originally seen as a part of the [[M\u00e9rida Initiative|U.S.- Mexico M\u00e9rida Initiative]]. In 2010 the U.S. Congress separated funding for Central America totaling $83 million. Although some of the aid came in the form of military hardware, some components focused on strengthening the receiving country's judicial system.<ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R41215.pdf]</ref>\n\nPresident [[Ricardo Maduro]], a former chairman of the [[Central Bank of Honduras]], ran on an anti-crime platform after his only son was murdered on 28 April 1999. During his tenure at the Central Bank of Honduras, a banking license was given to [[Banco de Producci\u00f3n]]. After leaving the Central Bank he became chairman and majority stockholder of Banco de Producci\u00f3n, and the general manager of the Central Bank, Ana Cristina Mejia de Pereira, became general manager of Banco de la Producci\u00f3n.\n\nMaduro came into power in January 2002 with a wave of measures against gangs and delinquency, the most noticeable, soldiers patrolling the streets. Many gang members were jailed for illicit association. His \"Mano Duro\" policy (name used to describe Central American leaders taking a hard stance against crime) led to the creation of a penal code in 2003 which made street gangs like MS-13 and M-18 illegal and established jail sentences up to 12 years for proven membership.<ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL34112.pdf.]</ref>\n\nViolent crime dipped noticeably under Maduro. These \"mano duro\" policies had significant downsides as well. For example, many youth are wrongly arrested for membership but later become recruited into gangs while in jail. Also, these gang round-ups  led to the overcrowding in the prison system. Regardless of the initial signs of success, gangs learned to adapt and continued to carry out their activities.<ref>Seelke 2009</ref> Some reports say that gang leaders from El Salvador come into Honduras to help stop their decline.\n\nUnder President Zelaya's term, the government attempted to create dialog with gang members to sway them to renounce their violence and re-integrate into society. However, this program relied mainly on private groups to implement the actual re-entry programs. Zelaya also created a specialized anti-gang unit within the police force which he used to coordinate patrols with the Honduran military. Although these patrols led to the arrests of 1,200 gang members, the rate of violence in Honduras did not subside.<ref>Ribando 2007</ref>\n\nTheir{{who|date=December 2017}} desperation resulted in a \"declaration of war\" against the government, and three major events over the last few years brought this tiny country to the attention of the world [[News media|media]]: a massacre of 68 prisoners at the prison farm just outside [[La Ceiba]] on 5 March 2003, a fire in the prison at [[San Pedro Sula]] that killed 107 prisoners on 18 May 2004, and the massacre of 27 innocent men, women and children in San Pedro Sula, on 23 December 2004.\n\nA massacre in the San Pedro Sula suburb of [[Chamelec\u00f3n]] left 27 dead and 29 injured. The murderers left behind a message, claiming to come from the [[Cinchoneros]],  railing against Maduro, Lobo, \u00c1lvarez and the death penalty. The Cinchoneros are believed to be defunct, however. The attackers promised another massacre before the new year. However one suspect was detained very shortly afterwards in another part of San Pedro Sula, and further arrests were later made. Local police said that the gunmen were members of the street gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13), and the supposed mastermind of the attack, Ebner Anibal Rivera-Paz, was later arrested in [[Falfurrias]],Texas.<ref>[http://foreignaffairs.com/articles/60803/ana-arena/how-the-street-gangs-took-central-america.]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAfter Maduro left office gang resurgence was felt and their presence continued, although less than before, but now using the cover of anti-government demonstrations for their activities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Honduras A Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments|last=|first=|publisher=International Business Publications, USA|year=2012|isbn=9780739795255|location=|pages=92-94}}</ref>\n\n==Elections==\n{{main|Elections in Honduras}}\n\nThe PNH and PLH have ruled the country for decades. In the last years, Honduras has had five Liberal presidents: [[Roberto Suazo C\u00f3rdova]], [[Jos\u00e9 Azcona del Hoyo]], [[Carlos Roberto Reina]], [[Carlos Roberto Flores]] and [[Manuel Zelaya]], and three Nationalists: [[Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero]] [[Porfirio Lobo Sosa]] and [[Ricardo Maduro]].\nThe elections have been full of controversies, including questions about whether Azcona was born in Honduras or Spain, and whether Maduro should have been able to stand given he was born in [[Panama]].\n\nOn February 20, 2005 the PNH and the PLH held internal party elections (primaries) to decide who would represent them in the forthcoming presidential elections in November. [[Porfirio Pepe Lobo]] became the PNH candidate. [[Manuel Zelaya]] became the Liberal Party candidate. Forty-five percent of the electorate voted in the primaries: 24% for the Liberals and 21% for the National Party. According to the Country Report quoted in the U.C.

Leading export [[coffee]] ($340 million) accounted for 22% of total Honduran export revenues. [[Banana]]s, formerly the country's second-largest export until being virtually wiped out by 1998's [[Hurricane Mitch]], recovered in 2000 to 57% of pre-Mitch levels. Cultivated [[shrimp]] is another important export sector. Since the late 1970s, towns in the north began industrial production through [[maquiladora]]s, especially in [[San Pedro Sula]] and [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]].\n\nHonduras has extensive [[forests]], [[marine biology|marine]], and [[mineral]] [[Resource (economics)|resources]], although widespread [[slash and burn]] agricultural methods continue to destroy Honduran forests. The Honduran  economy grew 4.8% in 2000, recovering from the Mitch-induced recession (-1.9%) of 1999. The Honduran [[maquiladora]] sector, the third-largest in the world, continued its strong performance in 2000, providing employment to over 120,000 and generating more  than $528 million in foreign exchange for the country. [[Inflation]], as measured by the [[consumer price index]], was 10.1% in 2000, down slightly from the 10.9% recorded in 1999. The country's international reserve position continued to be strong in 2000, at slightly over $1 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]]. Remittances from Hondurans living abroad (mostly in the [[United States|U.S.]]) rose 28% to $410 million in 2000. The Lempira (currency) was [[devaluation|devaluing]] for many years but stabilized at L19 to the US dollar in 2005. The Honduran people are among the poorest in [[Latin America]]; [[Gross national income]] per capita (2007) is $US 1,649; the average for Central America is $US 6,736.<ref>[http://data.un.org United Nations data], National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates, Per capita GNI at current prices -- US dollars.</ref>\nHonduras is the fourth poorest country in the [[Western Hemisphere]]; only [[Haiti]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Guyana]] are poorer. Utilizing [[Gross domestic product#Limitations of GDP to judge the health of an economy|alternative]] statistical measurements in addition to the Gross Domestic Product can provide greater context for the nation's poverty.\n\nThe country signed an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) -- later converted to a [[Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility]] (PRGF) with the [[International Monetary Fund]] in March 1999.  Honduras (as of about year 2000) continues to maintain stable macroeconomic policies. It not been swift to implementing structural changes such as privatization of the publicly owned telephone and energy distribution companies\u2014changes which are desired by the IMF and other international lenders. Honduras received significant debt relief in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, including the suspension bilateral debt service payments and bilateral debt reduction by the [[Paris Club]]\u2014including the U.S. -- worth over $400 million. In July 2000, Honduras reached its decision point under the [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] Initiative (HIPC), qualifying the country for interim multilateral debt relief.\n\nLand appears to be plentiful and readily exploitable, but the presence of apparently extensive land is misleading because the nation's rugged, mountainous terrain restricts large-scale agricultural production to narrow strips on the coasts and to a few fertile valleys. Honduras's manufacturing sector has not yet developed beyond simple textile and agricultural processing industries and assembly operations. The small domestic market and competition from more industrially advanced countries in the region have inhibited more complex industrialization.\n\n==Economic history==\n[[File:Honduras econ 1983.jpg|thumb|550px|An economic activity map of Honduras, 1983.]]\n{{Underlinked|section|date=September 2018}}\nAfter Honduras achieved independence from Spain in the early 19th century, its economic growth became closely related to its ability to develop attractive export products. During much of the 19th century, the Honduran economy languished; traditional cattle raising and subsistence agriculture produced no suitable major export. In the latter part of the century, economic activity quickened with the development of large-scale, precious metal mining. The most important mines were located in the mountains near the capital of Tegucigalpa and were owned by the [[Rosario Mining Company|New York and Honduras Rosario Mining Company]] (NYHRMC).\n\nSilver was the principal metal extracted, accounting for about 55% of exports in the 1880s. Mining income stimulated commercial and ancillary enterprises, built infrastructure, and reduced monetary restraints on trade. There were few other beneficial economic effects, however, because the mining industry was never well integrated into the rest of the Honduran economy. The foreign mining companies employed a small work force, provided little or no government revenue, and relied mostly on imported mining equipment.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nHonduras's international economic activity surged in the early 20th century. Between 1913 and 1929, its agricultural exports rose from US$3 million (US$2 million from bananas) to US$25 million (US$21 million from bananas). These \"golden\" exports were supported by more than US$40 million of specialized banana company investment in the Honduran infrastructure and were safeguarded by United States pressure on the national government when the companies felt threatened.\n\nThe overall performance of the Honduran economy remained closely tied to banana prices and production from the 1920s until after the mid-century because other forms of commercial export agriculture were slow to emerge. In addition, until drastically reduced in the mid-1950s, the work force associated with banana cultivation represented a significant proportion of the wage earners in the country. Just before the banana industry's largest strike in 1954, approximately 35,000 workers held jobs on the banana plantations of the United Fruit Company (later United Brands Company, then Chiquita Brands International) or the Standard Fruit Company (later brought by Castle and Cook, then Dole Food Company).\n\nAfter 1950 Honduran governments encouraged agricultural modernization and export diversification by spending heavily on transportation and communications infrastructure, agricultural credit, and technical assistance. During the 1950s\u2014as a result of these improvements and the strong international export prices\u2014beef, cotton, and coffee became significant export products for the first time. Honduran sugar, timber, and tobacco also were exported, and by 1960 bananas had declined to a more modest share (45 percent) of total exports. During the 1960s, industrial growth was stimulated by the establishment of the [[Central American Common Market]] (CACM\u2014see Appendix B).\n\nAs a result of the reduction of regional trade barriers and the construction of a high [[common external tariff]], some Honduran manufactured products, such as soaps, sold successfully in other Central American countries. Because of the greater size and relative efficiency of the Salvadoran and Guatemalan industrial sectors, however, Honduras bought far more manufactured products from its neighbors than it sold to them. After the 1969 [[Soccer War]] with El Salvador, Honduras effectively withdrew from the CACM. Favorable bilateral trade arrangements between Honduras and the other former CACM partners were subsequently negotiated, however.\n\n[[File:SanPedroSula.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Downtown]] [[San Pedro Sula]].]]\nA political shift in the 1980s had strong and unexpected repercussions on the country's economic condition. Beginning in late 1979, as insurgency spread in neighboring countries, Honduran military leaders enthusiastically came to support United States policies in the region. This alignment resulted in financial support that benefited the civilian as well as the military ministries and agencies of Honduras. Honduran defense spending rose throughout the 1980s until it consumed 20 to 30 percent of the national budget. Before the military buildup began in fiscal year (FY) 1980, United States military assistance to Honduras was less than US$4 million. Military aid more than doubled to reach just under US$9 million by FY 1981, surged to more than US$31 million by FY 1982, and stood at US$48.3 million in FY 1983. Tiny Honduras soon became the tenth largest recipient of United States assistance aid; total economic and military aid rose to more than US$200 million in 1985 and remained at more than US$100 million for the rest of the 1980s.\n\nThe increasing dependence of the Honduran economy on foreign aid was aggravated by a severe, regionwide economic decline during the 1980s. Private investment plummeted in 1980, and [[capital flight]] for that year was US$500 million. To make matters worse, coffee prices plunged on the international market in the mid-1980s and remained low throughout the decade. In 1993 average annual per capita income remained depressingly low at about US$580, and 75 percent of the population was poor by internationally defined standards.\n\nTraditionally, Honduran economic hopes have been pinned on land and agricultural commodities. Despite those hopes, however, usable land has always been severely limited. Honduras's mostly mountainous terrain confines agriculturally exploitable land to narrow bands along the coasts and to some previously fertile but now largely depleted valleys. The country's once abundant forest resources have also been dramatically reduced, and Honduras has not derived economically significant income from mineral resources since the 19th century. Similarly, Honduras's industrial sector never was fully developed. The heady days of the CACM (midto -late 1960s), which produced an industrial boom for El Salvador and Guatemala, barely touched the Honduran economy except to increase its imports because of the comparative advantages enjoyed by the Salvadoran and Guatemalan economies and Honduras's inability to compete.\n\nBananas and coffee have also proven unreliable sources of income. Although bananas are less subject to the vagaries of international markets than coffee, natural disasters such as [[Hurricane Fifi\u2013Orlene|Hurricane Fifi]] in 1974, drought, and disease have appeared with a regular, albeit random, frequency to take their economic toll through severely diminished harvests. Moreover, bananas are grown and marketed mostly by international corporations, which keep the bulk of wealth generated. Coffee exports, equally unreliable as a major source of economic support, surpassed bananas in the mid1970s as Honduras's leading export income earner, but international price declines coupled with huge fiscal deficits underlined the vulnerability of coffee as an economic base.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n{{Missing information|section|[[Effects of Hurricane Mitch in Honduras|the devastating effects of Hurricane Mitch on this nation]]. Didn't it cause a [[recession]] here in [[1998]]?|date=September 2018}}\nAs Honduras entered the 1990s, it did have some factors working in its favor\u2014relative peace and a stronger civilian government with less military interference in the politics and economy of the country than in past years. The country was hobbled, however, by horrendous foreign debt, could claim only diminished natural resources, and had one of the fastest growing and urbanizing populations in the world. The government's daunting task then became how to create an economic base able to compensate for the withdrawal of much United States assistance without becoming solely dependent on traditional agricultural exports.\n\nIn the 1990s, bananas were booming again, particularly as new European trade agreements increased market size. Small banana producing cooperatives lined up in the 1990s to sell their land to the commercial giants, and the last banana-producing lands held by the government were privatized. Like most of Central America, Honduras in the 1990s began to woo foreign investors, mostly Asian clothing assembly firms, and it held high hopes for revenue to be generated by privatizing national industries. With one of the most strike-prone labor forces in Central America, debt-burdened and aging industrial assets, and a dramatically underdeveloped infrastructure, Honduras, however, has distinct economic disadvantages relative to its Central American and Caribbean neighbors, who compete with Honduras in the same export markets.\n\nHonduran president [[Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero]], elected in November 1989, enjoyed little success in the early part of his administration as he attempted to adhere to a standard economic austerity package prescribed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the [[World Bank]]. As the November 1993 presidential elections drew closer, the political fallout of austere economic measures made their implementation even less likely. Any hope for his party's winning the 1993 election was predicated on improving social programs, addressing employment needs, and appeasing a disgruntled, vocal public sector. However, reaching those goals required policies that moved away from balancing the budget, lowering inflation, and reducing the deficit and external debt to attract investment and stimulate economic growth.\n\nCallejas inherited an economic mess. The economy had deteriorated rapidly, starting in 1989, as the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (AID) pointedly interrupted disbursements of its grants to Honduras to signal displeasure with the economic policies of the old government and to push the new government to make economic reforms. Nondisbursal of those funds greatly exacerbated the country's economic problems. Funds from the multilateral lending institutions, which eventually would help fill the gap left by the reduction of United States aid, were still under negotiation in 1989 and would be conditioned first on payment of arrears on the country's enormous external debt.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1985, the government of Honduras\u2014pumped up by massive infusions of external borrowing\u2014had introduced expensive, high-tech infrastructure projects. The construction of roads and dams, financed mostly by multilateral loans and grants, was intended to generate employment to compensate for the impact of the regionwide recession. In reality, the development projects served to swell the ranks of public-sector employment and line the pockets of a small elite. The projects never sparked private-sector investment or created substantial private employment. Instead, per capita income continued to fall as Honduras's external debt doubled. Even greater injections of foreign assistance between 1985 and 1988 kept the economy afloat, but it soon became clear that the successive governments had been borrowing time as well as money.\n\nForeign aid between 1985 and 1989 represented about 4.6 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). About 44 percent of the government's fiscal shortfall was financed through cash from foreign sources. Side effects of the cash infusion were that the national currency, the lempira became overvalued and the amount of exports dropped. A booming public sector, with its enhanced ability to import, was enough to keep the economy showing growth, based on private consumption and government spending. But the government did little to address the historical, underlying structural problems of the economy\u2014its overdependence on too few traditional commodities and lack of investment. Unemployment mushroomed, and private investment withered.\n\nBy 1989 President Callejas's broad economic goal became to return Honduran economic growth to 1960-80 levels. During the decades of the 1960s and 1970s, the country's economy, spurred mostly by erratically fluctuating traditional agricultural commodities, nevertheless averaged real annual growth of between 4 and 5 percent. At the end of the 1980s, however, Callejas had few remaining vehicles with which to pull the country out of the deep regionwide recession of the 1980s. Real growth between 1989 and 1993 translated to mostly negative or small positive per capita changes in the GDP for a population that was growing at close to 4 percent annually.\n\nPresident Callejas attempted to adhere to conditions of desperately needed new loans. Cutting the size of the public sector work force, lowering the deficit, and enhancing revenues from taxes\u2014as mandated by the multilateral lending institutions\u2014were consistently his biggest stumbling blocks. Despite his all-out effort to reduce the public-sector deficit, the overall ratio of fiscal deficit to the GDP in 1990 showed little change from that in 1989. The total public-sector deficit actually grew to 8.6 percent of the GDP, or nearly L1 billion, in 1991.\n\nThe 1993 deficit expanded to 10.6 percent of the GDP. The Honduran government's medium-term economic objectives, as dictated by the IMF, were to have generated real GDP growth of 3.5 percent by 1992 and 4 percent by 1993. In fact, GDP growth was 3.3 percent in 1991, 5.6 percent in 1992, and an estimated 3.7 percent in 1993. The economy had operated so long on an ad hoc basis that it lacked the tools to implement coherent economic objectives. Solving the most immediate crisis frequently took precedence over long-term goals.\nInflation\n\nBy 1991 President Callejas had achieved modest success in controlling inflation. Overall inflation for 1990 had reached 36.4 percent\u2014not the hyperinflation experienced by some Latin American counties\u2014but still the highest annual rate for Honduras in forty years. The Honduran government and the IMF had set an inflation target of 12 percent for 1992 and 8 percent for 1993. The actual figures were 8.8 percent in 1992 and an estimated 10.7 percent for 1993. Hondurans had been accustomed to low inflation (3.4 percent in 1985, rising to 4.5 percent by the end of 1986), partly because pegging the lempira to the dollar linked Honduras's inflation rate to inflation rates in developed countries. But the expectation for low inflation made the reality of high inflation that much worse and created additional pressures on the government for action when inflation soared in 1990.<ref>http://countrystudies.us/honduras/62.htm</ref>\n\n== Unemployment ==\n\nBetween 1980 and 1983, 20 percent of the work force was unemployed\u2014double the percentage of the late 1970s. Job creation remained substantially behind the growth of the labor force throughout the 1980s. Unemployment grew to 25 percent by 1985, and combined unemployment and underemployment jumped to 40 percent in 1989. By 1993, 50 to 60 percent of the Honduran labor force was estimated to be either underemployed or unemployed.\n\nThe government's acceptance of foreign aid during the 1980s, in lieu of economic growth sparked by private investment, allowed it to ignore the necessity of creating new jobs. Honduras's GDP showed reasonable growth throughout most of the 1980s, especially when compared to the rest of Latin America, but it was artificially buoyed by private consumption and public-sector spending.\n\nMainstay agricultural jobs became scarcer in the late 1970s. Coffee harvests and plantings in border area decreased because fighting in neighboring Nicaragua and El Salvador spilled over into Honduras. Other factors contributing to the job scarcity were limited land, a reluctance on the part of coffee growers to invest while wars destabilized the region, and a lack of credit. Small farmers became increasingly unable to support themselves as their parcels of land diminished in size and productivity.\n\nProblems in the agricultural sector have fueled urbanization. The Honduran population was 77 percent rural in 1960. By 1992 only 55 percent of the Honduran population continued to live in rural areas. [[Peasant|Campesinos]] have flocked to the cities in search of work but found little there. Overall unemployment has been exacerbated by an influx of refugees from the wars in neighboring countries, attracted to Honduras, ironically, by its relatively low population density and relative peace. In the agricultural sector (which in 1993 still accounted for approximately 60 percent of the labor force), unemployment has been estimated to be far worse than the figures for the total labor force.\n\nHonduran urban employment in the early 1990s has been characterized by underemployment and marginal informal-sector jobs, as thousands of former agricultural workers and refugees have moved to the cities seeking better lives. Few new jobs have been generated in the formal sector, however, because domestic private sector and foreign investment has dropped and coveted public-sector jobs have been reserved mostly for the small Honduran middle-class with political or military connections. Only one of ten Honduran workers was securely employed in the formal sector in 1991.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the World Bank reported that only 10,000 new jobs were created annually; the low rate of job creation resulted in 20,000 people being added to the ranks of the unemployed every year. The actual disparity between jobs needed for full employment and new jobs created exceeded that projection, however. For those with jobs, the buying power of their wages tumbled throughout the 1980s while the cost of basic goods, especially food, climbed precipitously.\n\n==Role of government==\n\nThroughout the 1960s and most of the 1970s, the military-led governments of Honduras ran a state-sponsored and state-financed economy. The governments provided most guarantees for loans to a strong but patronage-dominated and somewhat corrupt public sector that included recipients of graft extracted from foreign and domestic investors, and to costly state-developed enterprises. By 1989 and the election of President Callejas, however, a heavy toll had been taken by regionwide economic recession, civil war in neighboring countries, the drying up of most external credit, and capital flight equaling more than US$1.5 billion.\n\nCallejas began to shift economic policy toward privatizing government-owned enterprises, liberalizing trade and tariff regulations, and encouraging increased foreign investment through tax and other incentives. The Callejas administration did not seek less government control. Rather it changed the government's objectives by focusing on reducing public-sector spending, the size of the public-sector work force, and the trade deficit. Overall economic planning became the responsibility of the National Superior Planning Council, directed by the minister of economy and commerce. President Callejas, a United States-trained economist, brought new professionalism and technical skills to the central government as he began the arduous task of long-term economic reform.\n\nThe official exchange rate of the lempira, pegged at US$1=L2 since 1918, was dramatically devalued in 1990. Exchange controls had been introduced in 1982, resulting in a parallel currency market (black market) and several confusing official exchange rates operating simultaneously. Some of those rates were legally recognized in 1990 when President Callejas introduced a major series of economic policy reforms, which included reducing the maximum import tariff rate from 90 percent to 40 percent and getting rid of most surcharges and exemptions.\n\nThe value of the lempira was adjusted to US$1=L4, with the exception of the rate for debt equity conversions, which remained at the old rate of US$1=L2. The official conversion rate of the lempira fell to US$1=L7.26 in December 1993. The president also introduced temporary taxes on exports, which were intended to increase central government revenue. Additional price and trade liberalization measures and fewer government regulations became part of his ongoing reforms.\nBudget\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the Honduran government was heavily financed by foreign assistance. External financing\u2014mostly bilateral credit from the United States\u2014rose dramatically until it reached 87 percent of the public deficit in 1985, rising even further in subsequent years. By 1991 the public-sector deficit was entirely financed with net external credit. That financing permitted the government to reduce the demand for internal credit and, therefore, to maintain its established exchange rate.\n\nIn 1991 President Callejas managed to give the appearance of having reduced the overall fiscal deficit, a requirement for new credit. The deficit decrease, however, was mostly an accounting device because it resulted from the postponement of external payments to the Paris Club debtors and eventually would be offset by pressure to raise public investment. During 1991, loan negotiations with multilateral and bilateral lending institutions brought Honduras US$39.5 million in United States development assistance, US$70 million in balance-of-payments assistance in the form of cash grants, and US$18.8 million in food aid.\n\nHonduras country also negotiated US$302.4 million in concessional loans from the multilateral lending institutions. Total outstanding external debt as a percentage of GDP fell from 119 percent in 1990 to 114 percent in 1991 and to 112 percent in 1993. This drop was largely the result of debt forgiveness of US$448.4 million by the United States, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Scheduled amortization payments of an average US$223.2 million per year, however, guaranteed that Honduras's gross funding requirements would remain large indefinitely.\n\nThe government of Honduras projected that overall tax revenues would increase from 13.2 percent of GDP in 1989 to about 15.7 percent in 1991. Adjustments for low coffee prices and the continuation of lax collection methods, however, undermined those goals. Despite these tax increases, compared to developed countries, Honduras has low tax rates with particularly low property taxes.\n\n==Labor force==\n\nHonduras suffers from an overabundance of unskilled and uneducated laborers. Most Honduran workers in 1993 continued to be employed in agriculture, which accounted for about 60 percent of the labor force. More than half of the rural population, moreover, remains landless and heavily dependent on diminishing seasonal labor and low wages. Fifty-five percent of the farming population subsists on less than two hectares and earns less than US$70 per capita per year from those plots, mostly by growing subsistence food crops.\n\nIn 1993 only about 9 to 13 percent of the Honduran labor force was engaged in the country's tiny manufacturing sector\u2014one of the smallest in Central America. Skilled laborers are scarce. Only 25,000 people per year, of which about 21 percent are industrial workers, graduate yearly from the National Institute of Professional Training (Instituto Nacional de Formaci\u00f3n Profesional- -INFOP) established in 1972.\n\nHundreds of small manufacturing firms, the traditional backbone of Honduran enterprise, began to go out of business beginning in the early 1990s, as import costs rose and competition through increasing wages for skilled labor from the mostly Asian-owned assembly industries strengthened. The small Honduran shops, most of which had manufactured clothing or food products for the domestic market, traditionally received little support in the form of credit from the government or the private sector and were more like artisans than conventional manufacturers. Asian-owned export assembly firms (maquiladoras), operating mostly in free zones established by the government on the Caribbean coast, attract thousands of job seekers and swell the populations of new city centers such as San Pedro Sula, [[Tela]], and [[La Ceiba]]. Those firms employed approximately 16,000 workers in 1991.\n\nAbout one-third of the Honduran labor force was estimated to be working in the service or \"other\" sector in 1993. That classification usually means that a person ekes out a precarious livelihood in the urban informal sector or as a poorly paid domestic. As unemployment soared throughout Central America in the 1980s, more and more people were forced to rely on their own ingenuity in order to simply exist on the fringes of Honduran society.\n\nAs for the informal sector, research has shown that evidence of [[child labor]] has been observed mostly in the Honduran agricultural sector.<ref>[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/honduras.htm Honduras 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor]</ref> In 2014, the [[U.S. Department of Labor]]'s ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' cites 3 goods produced in such working conditions in Honduras; namely [[Coffee production in Honduras|coffee]], lobsters and melons.\n\n===Employment Indicators and Benefits===\n\nHonduran governments have set minimum wages since 1974, but enforcement has generally been lax. That laxity increased at the beginning of the 1980s. Traditionally, most Honduran workers have not been covered by social security, welfare, or minimum wages. Multinational companies usually paid more than the standard minimum wage, but, overall, the Honduran wage earner has experienced a diminution of real wages and purchasing ability for more than a decade. When they occurred, minimum wage adjustments generally did not keep up with cost of living increases.\n\nAfter a major currency devaluation in 1990, average Honduran workers were among the most poorly paid workers in the Western Hemisphere. By contrast, the banana companies paid relatively high wages as early as the 1970s. Banana workers continued at the top of the wage scale in the 1990s; however, in the 1980s, as banana production became less labor-intensive, the companies had decreased their investment and work force. Consequently, fewer workers were employed as relatively well-paid agricultural wage earners with related benefits.\n\nPresident Callejas responded to the severe poverty by implementing a specially financed Honduran Social Investment Fund (Fondo Hondure\u00f1o de Inversi\u00f3n Social\u2014FHIS) in 1990. The fund created public works programs such as road maintenance and provided United States surplus food to mothers and infants. Many Hondurans slipped through that fragile [[social safety net]]. As a continuing part of the social pact, and even more as the result of a fierce union-government battle, President Callejas announced in 1991 a 27.8 percent increase over a minimum wage that the government had earlier agreed upon. That increase was in addition to raises of 50 and 22 percent set, respectively, in January and September 1990. Despite those concessions, the minimum daily rate in 1991 was only US$1.75 for workers employed by small agricultural enterprises and US$3.15 for workers in the big exporting concerns; most workers did not earn the minimum wage.\n\n===Labor Unions===\n\nHonduras has long been heavily unionized. In 1993 approximately 15 to 20 percent of the overall formal work force was represented by some type of union, and about 40 percent of urban workers were union members. There were forty-eight strikes in the public sector alone in 1990, protesting the government's economic austerity program and layoffs of public-sector workers. More than 4,000 public-sector employees from the Ministry of Communications, Public Works, and Transport were fired in 1990. About 70,000 unionized workers remained in the faltering public sector in the beginning of 1991. However, the government largely made good its pledge to trim that number by 8,000 to 10,000 throughout 1991 as part of its austerity program.\n\nIn the private sector, 1990 saw ninety-four strikes in sixty four firms as workers fought for wage increases to combat inflation. A forty-two-day strike at the Tela Railroad Company (owned by Chiquita Brands International\u2014formerly United Brands and United Fruit Company) was unsuccessful, however, and that defeat temporarily ended union efforts at direct confrontation.\n\nIn 1993 Honduras had three major labor confederations: the [[Confederation of Honduran Workers]] (Confederaci\u00f3n de Trabajadores de Honduras\u2014CTH), claiming a membership of about 160,000 workers; the [[General Workers Central]] (Central General de Trabajadores\u2014CGT), claiming to represent 120,000 members; and the Unitary Confederation of Honduran Workers ([[Confederaci\u00f3n Unitaria de Trabajadores de Honduras]]\u2014CUTH), a new confederation formed in May 1992, with an estimated membership of about 30,000. The three confederations included numerous trade union federations, individual unions, and peasant organizations.\n\nThe CTH, the nation's largest trade confederation, was formed in 1964 by the nation's largest peasant organization, the National Association of Honduran Peasants (Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Campesinos de Honduras\u2014Anach), and by Honduran unions affiliated with the [[Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers]] (Organizaci\u00f3n Regional Interamericana de Trabajadores\u2014ORIT), a hemispheric labor organization with close ties to the [[American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (AFL-CIO).\n\nIn the early 1990s, the confederation had three major components: the 45,000-member Federation of Unions of National Workers of Honduras (Federaci\u00f3n Sindical de Trabajadores Nacionales de Honduras\u2014Fesitranh); the 22,000 member Central Federation of Honduran Free Trade Unions (Federaci\u00f3n Central de Sindicatos Libres de Honduras); and the 2,200-member Federation of National Maritime Unions of Honduras (Federaci\u00f3n de Sindicales Mar\u00edtimas Nacionales de Honduras). In addition, Anach, claiming to represent between 60,000 and 80,000 members, was affiliated with Fesitranh.\n\nFesitranh was by far the country's most powerful labor federation, with most of its unions located in San Pedro Sula and the Puerto Cort\u00e9s Free Zone. The unions of the United States-owned banana companies and the United States-owned petroleum refinery also were affiliated with Fesitranh. The CTH received support from foreign labor organizations, including [[ORIT]], the [[American Institute for Free Labor Development]] (AIFLD), and Germany's [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]] and was an affiliate of the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] (ICFTU).\n\nAlthough it was not legally recognized until 1982, the CGT was originally formed in 1970 by the [[Christian Democratic Party of Honduras|Christian Democrats]] and received external support from the [[World Confederation of Labour]] (WCL) and the Latin American Workers Central (Central Latinoamericana de Trabajadores\u2014CLAT), a regional organization supported by Christian Democratic parties. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, the CGT leadership developed close ties to the [[National Party of Honduras]] (Partido Nacional de Honduaras\u2014PNH), and several leaders served in the Callejas government. Another national peasant organization, the National Union of Peasants (Uni\u00f3n Nacional de Campesinos\u2014UNC), claiming a membership of 40,000, was affiliated with the CGT for many years and was a principal force within the confederation.\n\nThe CUTH was formed in May 1992 by two principal labor federations, the Unitary Federation of Honduran Workers ([[Federaci\u00f3n Unitaria de Trabajadores de Honduras]]\u2014FUTH) and the Independent Federation of Honduran Workers (Federaci\u00f3n Independiente de Trabajadores de Honduras\u2014FITH), as well as several smaller labor groups, all critical of the Callejas government's neoliberal economic reform program.\n\nThe Marxist [[FUTH]], with an estimated 16,000 members in the early 1990s, was first organized in 1980 by three communist-influenced unions, but did not receive legal status until 1988. The federation had external ties with the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] (WFTU), the Permanent Congress for Latin American Workers Trade Union Unity (Congreso Permanente de Unidad Sindical de Trabajadores de Am\u00e9rica Latina\u2014CPUSTAL), and the Central American Committee of Trade Union Unity (Comit\u00e9 de Unidad Sindical de Centroam\u00e9rica\u2014CUSCA). Its affiliations included water utility, university, electricity company, brewery, and teacher unions, as well as several peasant organizations, including the National Central of Farm Workers (Central Nacional de Trabajadores del Campo\u2014CNTC), formed in 1985 and active in land occupations in the early 1980s.\n\nFUTH also became affiliated with a number of leftist popular organizations in a group known as the Coordinating Committee of Popular Organizations (Comit\u00e9 Coordinadora de las Organizaciones Populares\u2014CCOP) that was formed in 1984. Dissident FUTH member formed the FITH, which was granted legal status in 1988. The FITH consisted of fourteen unions claiming about 13,000 members in the early 1990s.\n\n==Agriculture and land use==\n[[File:Colbanana04.jpg|thumb|175px|Bananas are one of Honduras' main exports.]]\n\nThe total land area of Honduras is 11.2 million hectares, of which a scant 1.7 million hectares (about 15 percent) are well suited for agriculture. Most land in Honduras is covered by mountains, giving rise to the country's nickname, \"the Tibet of Central America.\" Nevertheless, the Honduran economy has always depended almost exclusively on agriculture, and in 1992 agriculture was still the largest sector of the economy, contributing 28 percent to the GDP.\n\nLess than half of Honduras's cultivable land was planted with crops as recently as the mid-1980s. The rest was used for pastures or was forested and was owned by the government or the banana corporations. Potential for additional productivity from fallow land was questionable, however, because much of Honduras's soil lacks the thick volcanic ash found elsewhere in Central America. In addition, by 1987 about 750,000 hectares of Honduran land had been seriously eroded as a result of misuse by cattle ranchers and slash-and-burn squatters who planted unsuitable food crops.\n\nThe Honduran government and two banana companies\u2014Chiquita Brands International and Dole Food Company\u2014owned approximately 60 percent of Honduras's cultivable land in 1993. The banana companies acquired most of their landholdings in the early 20th century in return for building the railroads used to transport bananas from the interior to the coast. Much of their land remained unused because it lacked irrigation. Only about 14 percent of cultivated land was irrigated in 1987. Most land under cultivation in 1992 was planted in bananas, coffee, and specialized export crops such as melons and winter vegetables.\n\n===Agricultural policy===\n\nThe agricultural sector's output showed little or no growth between 1970 and 1985. As a result of favorable weather and market conditions beginning in 1995, however, the agricultural sector grew at a rate of 2.6 percent annually, slightly above the average for Latin America during that period. Production of basic grains and coffee increased; the export price of bananas was high; and pork, poultry, and milk produced for the domestic market increased. Nontraditional fruits and vegetables also increased in value.\n\nHonduran agricultural production overall has tended to be low because the amount of crop yielded by a given amount of land has been low. For example, Honduran chocolate yields historically have been only about half those of Costa Rica. Instead of using improved techniques to increase the productivity of the land, Honduran farmers have merely expanded the hectarage under cultivation to produce more crops\u2014pushing their fields ever farther into the forests. Given the limited amount of good quality agricultural land to begin with, that policy has resulted in continual deforestation and subsequent erosion. This reluctance to improve techniques, coupled with generally poor soil, a lack of credit, and poor infrastructure, has contributed to low production figures.\n\n===Land reform===\n\nThe Honduran government nominally began to address inequitable land ownership in the early 1960s. Those efforts at reform focused on organizing rural cooperatives. About 1,500 hectares of government-owned land were distributed by the National Agrarian Institute (Instituto Nacional Agrario\u2014INA) beginning in 1960.\n\nA [[1963 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup in 1963]] resulted in an end to the land reform program. Lacking even modest government-directed land reforms, illegal [[squatting]] became the primary means for poor people to gain land throughout the early 1970s. These actions spurred the government to institute new agrarian reforms in 1972 and 1975. Although all lands planted in export crops were exempted from reform, about 120,000 hectares were, nevertheless, divided among 35,000 poor families.\n\nBy 1975 the pendulum had swung back, and agrarian reform was all but halted. From 1975 through the 1980s, illegal occupations of unused land increased once again. The need for land reform was addressed mostly by laws directed at granting titles to squatters and other landholders, permitting them to sell their land or to use it as collateral for loans.\n\nDespite declarations by the Callejas government in 1989 of its intent to increasingly address social issues, including land tenure and other needs of small farmers, the early 1990s were jolted by increased conflicts between peasants and the Honduran security forces. Agricultural credit and government support increasingly favored export crop producers at the expense of producers of basic food crops.\n\nThe Honduran land reform process under President Callejas between 1989 and 1992 was directed primarily at large agricultural landowners. An agrarian pact, signed by landowners and peasant organizations in August 1990, remained underfunded and largely unimplemented. Furthermore, violence erupted as discharged members of the Honduran military forcibly tried to claim land that had already been awarded to the peasant organization Anach in 1976.\n\nIn May 1991, violence initiated by members of the Honduran military resulted in the deaths of eight farmers. To keep similar situations around the country from escalating into violence, the government promised to parcel out land belonging to the National Corporation for Investment (Corporaci\u00f3n Nacional de Inversiones\u2014Conadin). The government also pledged to return to peasants land that had been confiscated by the Honduran military in 1983.\n\nAn Agricultural Modernization Law, passed in 1992, accelerated [[land titling]] and altered the structure of land cooperatives formed in the 1960s. The law permitted cooperative members to break up their holdings into small personal plots that could be sold. As a result, some small banana producers suffering from economic hard times chose to sell their land to the giant banana producers. After an agreement was reached with the European Union (EU) to increase Honduras's banana quota to the EU, the large banana companies were avid for additional land for increased production to meet the anticipated new demand from Europe.\n\n===Traditional crops===\n\nThroughout the 20th century, Honduras's agriculture has been dominated first by [[banana]]s and then to a lesser extent by [[coffee]] and [[sugar]]. In 1992, bananas and coffee together accounted for 50 percent of the value of Honduran exports and made the biggest contribution to the economy. Total banana sales were US$287 million and total coffee sales amounted to US$148 million. These figures are impressive yet reflect production losses suffered by banana producers and the withholding of coffee exports from the market in an effort to fight steep price declines.\n\nAnother major blow to Honduran agriculture came from Hurricane Mitch and its aftermath in 1998 and 1999. As of 2012 both industries are on the upswing. The banana industry is dominated by [[Chiquita]] and the [[Dole Food Company]], two multinational corporations. The coffee industry, in contrast, offers better opportunities for small [http://theodtc.com/coffee-project Honduran family farms] to compete. Sugar has also been an important Honduran crop.\n\nChiquita Brands International and Dole Food Company now account for most Honduran banana production and exports. Honduras's traditional system of independent banana producers, who, as late as the 1980s, sold their crops to the international banana companies, was eroded in the 1990s. In the absence of policies designed to protect independent suppliers, economically strapped cooperatives began to sell land to the two large corporations.\n\nAlthough Honduran banana production is dominated by multinational giants, such is not the case with coffee, which is grown by about 55,000 mostly small producers. Coffee production in Honduras has been high despite relatively low independent yields because of the large numbers of producers. Honduras, in fact, consistently produced more than its international quota until growers began to withhold the crop in the 1980s in an attempt to stimulate higher prices. Despite the efforts of the growers, coffee prices plunged on the international market from a high of more than US$2.25 per kilogram in the mid-1970s to less than US$0.45 per kilogram in the early 1990s. As a result of the declining prices, coffee producers were becoming increasingly marginalized. With the aid of affordable loans from foreign investors, more and more Honduran coffee growers are learning to produce high-value organic coffee for today's economy.\n\nThe outlook for the sugar industry, which had boomed during the 1980s when Honduran producers were allowed to fill Nicaragua's sugar quota to the United States, seemed bleak in 1993. Restoration of the sugar quota to Nicaraguan growers has been a major blow to Honduras's small independent producers, who had added most of Nicaragua's quota to their own during the United States embargo of Nicaragua. Higher costs for imported fertilizers because of the devaluation of the lempira add to the problem.\n\nHonduran producers seek relief from a relatively low official price of 25 lempiras per kilogram of sugar by smuggling sugar across the borders to Nicaragua and El Salvador, where the support prices are higher. Sugar growers who can afford it have begun to diversify by growing pineapples and rice. Many independent sugar growers, like independent banana producers, have become indignant over the relatively high profits shown by refiners and exporters. Strikes by producers at harvest time in 1991 forced the closure of the Choluteca refinery for a short time but had little effect on the depressed long-term outlook for the industry.\n\n===Nontraditional crops===\n\nWhile the total value of export merchandise fell in 1990 and 1991 and had still not recovered in 1993 to its 1989 level, the overall agricultural sector output has grown somewhat because of growth in the sale of winter vegetables and shrimp. Nontraditional vegetables and fruit produced US$23.8 million in export revenue in 1990, a figure that was almost double the 1983 figure. Nontraditional agricultural crops represented 4.8 percent of the value of total exports in 1990, compared to 2.8 percent in 1983.\n\nSome development experts argue that government protection of corn, bean, and rice production by small farmers is a futile effort in the long-term goal of poverty reduction. On the other hand, they see significant economic potential for nontraditional crops, if they are handled properly. Analysts also note, however, that Honduras is at a distinct disadvantage relative to its Central American neighbors because of its poor transportation system. Nontraditional exports require the ability to get fresh produce from the fields to distant markets rapidly.\n\n===Livestock===\n\nIn the early 1980s, the cattle industry appeared to have the potential to be an important part of the Honduran economy. The Honduran cattle sector, however, never developed to the extent that it did in much of the rest of Central America. Cattle production grew steadily until 1980-81 but then declined sharply when profits fell because of high production costs. The small Honduran meat packing industry declined at the same time, and several meat packing plants closed. As late as 1987, livestock composed 16 percent of the value-added agricultural sector but the industry continued to decline. By 1991-92, beef exports accounted for only 2.9 percent of the value of total exports.\n\nSales of refrigerated meat were the third or fourth highest source of export earnings in the mid-1980s, but like other Honduran agricultural products, beef yields were among the lowest in Central America. As world prices fell and production costs, exacerbated by drought, rose, there was less incentive to raise cattle. For a period of time, cattle farmers illegally smuggled beef cattle to Guatemala and other neighboring countries where prices were higher, but the Honduran cattle sector never became competitive internationally. The two large banana companies have also owned large cattle ranches where they raised prime beef, but these large companies had the flexibility to change crops as the market demanded.\n\nHonduran dairy herds fared about the same as beef cattle, and Honduran milk yields were also among the lowest in Central America. The dairy industry was further handicapped by the difficulties of trying to transport milk over poor roads in a tropical country, as well as by stiff competition in the domestic market from subsidized foreign imports, mostly from the United States.\n\n===Fishing===\n\nHonduras significantly developed its shrimp industry during the 1980s and in the Latin American market was second only to Ecuador in shrimp exports by 1991. In 1992 shrimp and lobster jumped to 12 percent of export earnings. Shrimp contributed US$97 million in export sales to the economy in 1992\u2014an increase of 33 percent over the previous year. The industry was dependent, however, on larvae imported from the United States to augment its unstable natural supply.\n\nTechnicians from Taiwan were contracted by large producers in 1991 to help develop laboratory larvae, but bitter feuds developed between independent shrimpers and the corporations. Local shrimpers charged that corporate methods were damaging the environment and destroying natural stock through destruction of the mangrove breeding swamps. Corporate shrimp farmers then began to move their operations farther inland, leaving local shrimpers to contend with diminished natural supplies on the mosquito-infested coast.\n\n===Forestry===\n\nAs in much of Central America, Honduras's once abundant forest resources have been badly squandered. In 1964 forests covered 6.8 million hectares, but by 1988 forested areas had declined to 5 million hectares. Honduras continued to lose about 3.6 percent of its remaining forests annually during the 1980s and early 1990s. The loss is attributable to several factors. Squatters have consistently used land suitable only for forests to grow scantyield food crops; large tracts have been cleared for cattle ranches; and the country has gravely mismanaged its timber resources, focusing far more effort on logging than on forestry management.\n\nThe government began an intensive forestry development program in 1974, supposedly intended to increase management of the sector and to prevent exploitation by foreign-owned firms. The Honduran Corporation for Forestry Development (Corporaci\u00f3n Hondure\u00f1a de Desarrollo Forestal\u2014Cohdefor) was created in 1974, but it quickly developed into a corrupt monopoly for overseeing forest exports. Timber was mostly produced by private sawmills under contracts selectively granted by Cohdefor officials.\n\nOngoing wasteful practices and an unsustainable debt, which was contracted to build infrastructure, appear to have undercut most conservation efforts. The military-dominated governments contracted huge debt with the multilateral development agencies, then extracted timber to pay for it. Cohdefor generally granted licenses to private lumber companies with few demands for preservation, and it had little inclination or incentive to enforce the demands it did make.\n\nWith encouragement from the United States Agency for International Development (AID), the Honduran government began to decentralize Cohdefor beginning in 1985. Under the decentralization plan, regulatory responsibilities were transferred from the central government to mayors and other municipal officials on the assumption that local officials would provide better oversight. Despite decentralization and the sale of government assets, Cohdefor's remaining debt was US$240 million in 1991. The government also assumed continued financial responsibility for the construction of a new airstrip in the area of timber extraction, upgrading facilities at [[Puerto Castilla, Honduras|Puerto Castilla]] and [[Puerto Lempira]], and providing electricity at reduced prices to lumber concerns as part of the privatization package.\n\nMajor legislation was passed in 1992 to promote Honduran reforestation by making large tracts of state-owned land more accessible to private investors. The legislation also supplied subsidies for development of the sector. The same law provided for replanting mountainous regions of the country with pine to be used for fuel.\n\n==Natural resources and energy==\nMining, the mainstay of the Honduran economy in the late 19th century, declined dramatically in importance in the 20th century. The New York and Honduras Rosario Mining Company (NYHRMC) produced US$60 million worth of gold and silver between 1882 and 1954 before discontinuing most of its operations.\n\nMining's contribution to the GDP steadily declined during the 1980s, to account for a 2 percent contribution in 1992. [[El Mochito mine]] in western Honduras, the largest mine in Central America, accounted for most mineral production. Ores containing gold, silver, lead, zinc, and cadmium were mined and exported to the United States and Europe for refining.\n\n===Energy sources===\n\nHonduras has for many years relied on fuelwood and biomass (mostly waste products from agricultural production) to supply its energy needs. The country has never been a producer of petroleum and depends on imported oil to fill much of its energy needs. In 1991 Honduras consumed about {{convert|16000|oilbbl}} of oil daily. Honduras spent approximately US$143 million, or 13 percent of its total export earnings, to purchase oil in 1991. The country's one small refinery at Puerto Cort\u00e9s closed in 1993.\n\nVarious Honduran governments have done little to encourage oil exploration, although substantial oil deposits have long been suspected in the R\u00edo Sula valley and offshore along the Caribbean coast. An oil exploration consortium consisting of the Venezuelan state oil company, Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc. ([[Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela]], S.A.--PDVSA), Cambria Oil, and [[Texaco]] expressed interest in the construction of a refinery at Puerto Castilla in 1993, with production aimed at the local market.\n\nFuelwood and biomass have traditionally met about 67 percent of the country's total energy demand; petroleum, 29 percent; and electricity, 4 percent. In 1987 Honduran households consumed approximately 60 percent of total energy used, transportation and agriculture used about 26 percent, and industry used about 14 percent. Food processing consumed about 50 percent of industrial sector energy, followed by petroleum and chemical manufacturing.\n\n===Electric power===\n\n{{Further|Electricity sector in Honduras}}\n\nHonduran electrification is low and uneven relative to other countries in Latin America. The World Bank estimates that only about 36 percent of the Honduran population had access to electricity (20 percent of the rural population) in 1987. The country's total capacity in 1992 was 575 megawatts (MW), with 2,000 megawatt-hours produced. A mammoth hydroelectric plant, the 292-MW project at [[El Caj\u00f3n Dam (Honduras)|El Caj\u00f3n]], began producing electricity in 1985 to help address the country's energy needs. The plant, however, soon became heavily indebted because of the government's electricity pricing policies (not charging public-sector institutions, for example) and because of the appointment of political cronies as top management officials. El Caj\u00f3n also developed costly structural problems requiring extensive maintenance and repairs.\n\nOfficials estimated that the government's decision to provide free service to publicsector institutions contributed to a 23 percent increase in publicsector consumption in 1990. Experts estimated that additional electrical generation capacity would likely be needed to keep pace with demand. The [[Honduran Congress]] assumed authority for setting electric prices beginning in 1986 but then became reluctant to increase rates. Under pressure from the World Bank, it did agree to a 60 percent increase in 1990, with additional increases in 1991. To offset these increased rates for residential users, the National Congress initiated a system of direct subsidies that ran through 1992.\n\n== Secondary and tertiary industries ==\n\n===Manufacturing===\n\nThe country's manufacturing sector was small, contributing only 15 percent to the total GDP in 1992. Textile exports, primarily to the United States, led the Honduran manufacturing sector. The maquiladora, or assembly industry, was a growth industry in the generally bleak economy. Asian-owned firms dominated the sector, with twenty-one South Korean-owned companies in export processing zones located in the R\u00edo Sula valley in 1991.\n\nThe maquiladoras employed approximately 16,000 workers in 1991; another nine firms opened in 1992. Job creation, in fact, is considered to be the primary contribution of the assembly operations to the domestic economy. The export textile manufacturing industry all but wiped out small, Honduran manufacturers, and food processors, whose goods were historically aimed at the domestic market, were also adversely affected.\n\nThe small Honduran firms could not begin to compete with the assembly industry for labor because of the maquiladoras' relatively high wage scale of close to US$4 per day. Small firms also found it increasingly difficult to meet the high cost of mostly imported inputs. Membership in the Honduran Association of Small and Medium Industry (Asociaci\u00f3n Hondure\u00f1a de Empresas Peque\u00f1as y Medianas) declined by 70 percent by 1991, compared to pre-maquiladora days, foreshadowing the likely demise of most of the small shops.\n\nHonduran domestic manufacturers also suffered from increased Central American competition resulting from a trade liberalization pact signed in May 1991 by Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Overall, the Honduran manufacturing sector has mimicked other sectors of the economy\u2014it is mostly noncompetitive, even in a regional context, because of insufficient credit and the high cost of inputs. Relatively high interest rates and a complicated investment law have also inhibited the foreign-dominated manufacturing sector from taking off.\n\nThe government-sponsored Puerto Cort\u00e9s Free Zone was opened in 1976. By 1990 an additional five free zones were in operation in Omoa, Coloma, Tela, La Ceiba, and Amapala. A series of privately run [[Export Processing Zone|export processing zones]] were also established in competition with the government-sponsored free zones. These privately run zones offered the same standard import-export incentives as the government zones. Most of the government and privately run zones were located along the Caribbean coast in a newly developing industrial belt.\n\nFirms operating outside of the special \"enterprise zones\" (either privately run, export-processing zones or government sponsored free zones) enjoy many of the same benefits as those operating within the zones. The Honduran Temporary Import Law permits companies that export 100 percent of their production to countries outside the CACM countries to hold ten-year exemptions on corporate income taxes and duty-free import of industrial inputs.\n\nAnalysts continue to debate the actual benefits of the shift away from the [[import-substitution industrialization]] (ISI) policies of the 1960s and 1970s toward a new focus on free zones and assembly industries in the 1990s. Critics point to the apparent lack of commitment by foreign manufactures to any one country site or to the creation of permanent infrastructure and employment. They question whether new employment will be enough to offset the loss of jobs in the more traditional manufacturing sector. A value of US$195 million to the Honduran economy from assembly industries in 1991\u2014when the value of clothing exports was greater than that of coffee\u2014was a compelling argument in favor of the shift, however.\n\n===Construction===\n\nHigh interests rates, particularly for housing, continued to hurt the Honduran construction industry in 1993, but danger from high rates was partially offset by some public-sector investment. Privatization of formerly state-owned industries through debt swaps also negatively affected construction as prices for basic materials such as cement increased and credit tightened. A major devaluation of the lempira added to the already high cost of construction imports. Construction contributed 6.0 percent to the GDP in 1992.\n\n===Banking===\n\nThe Honduran financial sector is small in comparison to the banking systems of its neighbors. After 1985, however, the sector began to grow rapidly. The average annual growth rate of value added to the economy from the financial sector for the 1980s was the second-highest in Latin America, averaging 4 percent. By 1985 Honduras had twenty-five financial institutions with 300 branch offices. Honduran commercial banks held 60 percent of the financial system's assets in 1985 and nearly 75 percent of all deposits. With the exception of the Armed Forces Social Security Institute, all commercial banks were privately owned, and most were owned by Honduran families. In 1985 there were two government-owned development banks in Honduras, one specializing in agricultural credit and the other providing financing to municipal governments.\n\nAt the behest of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, Honduras began a process of financial liberalization in 1990. The process began with the freeing of agricultural loan rates and was quickly followed by the freeing of loan rates in other sectors. Beginning in late 1991, Honduran banks were allowed to charge market rates for agricultural loans if they were using their own funds. By law, the banks had to report their rates to monetary authorities and could fix rates within two points of the announced rate.\n\nIn 1991 commercial banks pressured the government to reduce their 35 percent minimum reserve ratio. This rate remained standard until June 1993 when the minimum requirement was temporarily lifted to 42 percent. The rate was dropped to 36 percent three months later. The banks had excess reserves, and lending rates were in the area of 26 to 29 percent, with few borrowers. Prior to liberalization measures, the [[Central Bank of Honduras]] (Banco Central de Honduras) maintained interest rate controls, setting a 19 percent ceiling, with the market lending rate hovering around 26 percent in late 1991. With inflation hitting 33 percent in 1990, there was, in fact, a negative real interest rate, but this situation reversed in 1991 when rates were high relative to inflation. Rates of 35 to 43 percent in 1993 were well above the inflation rate of 13 to 14 percent. Bankers argued for further liberalization, including easing of controls in the housing and nonexport agricultural sectors.\n\nA Honduran stock exchange was established in August 1990 with transactions confined to trading debt. Nine companies were registered with the exchange in 1991; in 1993 this number had grown to eighteen. It appears doubtful, however, that the market will develop fully, given the reluctance of family-held firms to open their books to public scrutiny.\n\n===Tourism===\n\nForeign tourists are attracted to Honduras by the Mayan ruins in [[Cop\u00e1n]] and coral reef skindiving off the [[Islas de la Bah\u00eda]] (Bay Islands). Poor infrastructure, however, has discouraged the development of substantial international tourism. Despite these problems, the number of visitors arriving in Honduras rose from fewer than 200,000 in 1987 to almost 250,000 in 1989. Small [[ecotourism]] projects in particular are considered to have significant potential.\n\n==Trade==\n[[File:Honduras Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|450px|A proportional representation of Honduras' exports.]]\n\nIn the early 1990s, the United States was by far Honduras's leading trading partner, with Japan a distant second. United States exports to Honduras in 1992 were valued at US$533 million, about 54 percent of the country's total imports of US$983 million. Most of the rest of Honduras's imports come from its Central American neighbors. Despite its status as beneficiary of both the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) and the [[Generalized System of Preferences]] (GSP)--both of which confer duty-free status on Honduran imports to the United States\u2014Honduras has run a long-standing trade deficit with the United States.\n\nTotal exports of goods and services by Honduras in 1992 were US$843 million, of which about 52 percent went to the United States. The current account deficit, however, continues to rise, from US$264 million in 1992 to an estimated US$370 million deficit in 1993.\n\n===Linkages to United States===\nAs with most Latin American countries, Honduras's economy is closely tied to the United States. The United States is Honduras's primary trading partner and the source of about two-thirds of the country's [[foreign direct investment]].\nUnited States [[Transnational corporation|multinationals]] [[Dole Food Company]] and [[Chiquita]] control a large portion of Honduras's agricultural exports. Presently, Honduras participates alongside the [[Rainforest Alliance]] for the exporting of agricultural goods to the United States.\n\nHondurans working in the U.S. send more than US$2 billion each year to their families in Honduras; these [[remittances]] account for 28.2% of Honduras's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] (2007 information\n<ref>NotiCen, 29 November 2007, excerpted in University of California at San Diego libraries [http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/sshl/resources/featured-collections/latin-american-elections-statistics/honduras/19982007.html Latin american election statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5iY48KxUU?url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/sshl/resources/featured-collections/latin-american-elections-statistics/honduras/19982007.html |date=26 July 2009 }}. Retrieved July 2009. NotiCen's source is probably the Latin American Development Bank.</ref>).\n\n==Foreign Investment==\n\nWith the exception of relatively recent, Asian-dominated investment in assembly firms along Honduras's northern coast, the country remains heavily dependent on United States-based multinational corporations for most of its investment needs in the early 1990s. Overall investment as a percentage of GDP declined dramatically during the 1980s, from about 25 percent in 1980 to a meager 15 percent in 1990. Dole Food Company and Chiquita Brands International together have invested heavily in Honduran industries as diverse as breweries and plastics, cement, soap, cans, and shoes.\n\nAs Honduras enters the 1990s, it faces challenging economic problems. The solutions relied on in the past\u2014traditional export crops, the maquiladora assembly industry, and 1980s' development schemes\u2014appear unlikely to provide enough new jobs for a rapidly growing population. The major economic challenge for Honduras over the next decade will be to find dependable sources of sustainable economic growth.\n\n==Statistics==\n\n*GDP\n** L 233 billion (2007.)\n** US$12.3 billion (2007.)\n** International dollars (purchasing power parity method) $24.69 billion (2007 est.)<ref>L and US$ data are from [http://data.un.org United Nations data], National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates.

During 1995-96, Honduras, a founding member of the United Nations, for the first time served as a non-permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. Honduras is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).\n\n==Central American relations==\nPresident Flores{{who|date=December 2017}} consulted frequently with the other [[Central America]]n presidents on issues of mutual interest. He continued his predecessor's strong emphasis on Central American cooperation and integration, which resulted in an agreement easing border controls and tariffs among Honduras, [[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[El Salvador]]. Honduras also joined its six Central American neighbors at the 1994 Summit of the Americas in signing the Alliance for Sustainable Development, known as the Conjunta Centroamerica-USA, or CONCAUSA, to promote sustainable economic development in the region. Honduras held the 6-month SICA presidency during the second half of 1998.\n\nAt the 17th Central American Summit in 1995, hosted by Honduras in the northern city of [[San Pedro Sula]], the region's six countries (excluding [[Belize]]) signed treaties creating confidence- and security-building measures and combating the smuggling of stolen automobiles in the isthmus. In subsequent summits (held every 6 months), Honduras has continued to work with the other Central American countries on issues of common concern.\n\n==Relations by country==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Armenia}}||<!--Date started-->16 September 2011||\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 16 September 2011.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Dominica}}||<!--Date started-->4 June 2014||\n\nThe two countries established diplomatic relations on June 04, 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/en/media_center/press_release.asp?sCodigo=E-235/14|title=OAS - Organization of American States: Democracy for peace, security, and development|first=|last=OAS|date=1 August 2009|website=Oas.org|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref> during the [[General Assembly of the Organization of American States]] in [[Asunci\u00f3n]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|El Salvador}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\nIn 1969, El Salvador and Honduras fought the brief \"[[Football War]]\" over disputed border areas and friction resulting from the 300,000 Salvadorans who had emigrated to Honduras in search of land and employment.

Some mineral deposits have been exploited commercially.

[[Mesozoic]] igneous activity is largely responsible for this diversity of mineral deposits and the mineral concentrations have been variably enhanced by hydrothermal activity associated with faulting.

While Hong Kong retains the [[common law]] system, the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China]] has the power of final interpretation of national laws affecting Hong Kong, including the Basic Law, and its opinions are therefore binding on Hong Kong courts on a prospective basis.\n\n==Major political issues in recent years==\n[[File:HKmarch1 13 2008pic3.jpg|thumb|Political activists voicing their concern in the Jan 2008 protest]]\n\n===Right of Abode===\n{{Main|Right of abode in Hong Kong}}\nOn 29 January 1999, the Court of Final Appeal, the highest judicial authority in Hong Kong interpreted several Articles of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], in such a way that the Government estimated would allow 1.6&nbsp;million [[Mainland China]] immigrants to enter Hong Kong within ten years. This caused widespread concerns among the public on the social and economic consequences.\n\nWhile some in the legal sector advocated that the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC) should be asked to amend the part of the Basic Law to redress the problem, the HKSAR Government decided to seek an interpretation to, rather than an amendment of, the relevant Basic Law provisions from the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC). The NPCSC issued an interpretation in favour of the Hong Kong Government in June 1999, thereby overturning parts of the court decision. While the full powers of NPCSC to interpret the Basic Law is provided for in the Basic Law itself, some critics argue this undermines [[judicial independence]].\n\n===1 July marches and Article 23===\n{{Main|Hong Kong 1 July marches|Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23}}\nThe Hong Kong 1 July March is an annual protest rally led by the [[Civil Human Rights Front]] since the 1997 handover on the [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Establishment Day|HKSAR establishment day]]. However, it was only in 2003 when it drew large public attention by opposing the bill of the Article 23. It has become the annual platform for demanding universal suffrage, calling for observance and preservation [[civil liberties]] such as [[freedom of speech|free speech]], venting dissatisfaction with the [[Hong Kong Government]] or the Chief Executive, rallying against actions of the Pro-Beijing camp.\n\nIn 2003, the HKSAR Government proposed to implement Article 23 of the Basic Law by enacting [[National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003|national security bill]] against acts such as [[treason]], [[Subversion (political)|subversion]], [[secession]] and [[sedition]].<ref name=\"Basiclaw23HK1\">Executive Council of HKSAR.

Lexington books. {{ISBN|0-7391-0492-6}}.</ref>\n\n===Universal suffrage===\n{{Main|Democratic development in Hong Kong}}\nTowards the end of 2003, the focus of political controversy shifted to the dispute of how subsequent Chief Executives get elected. The [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45|Basic Law's Article 45]] stipulates that the ultimate goal is [[universal suffrage]]; when and how to achieve that goal, however, remains open but controversial. Under the Basic Law, electoral law could be amended to allow for this as soon as [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2007|2007]] (Hong Kong Basic Law Annex .1, Sect.7). Arguments over this issue seemed to be responsible for a series of Mainland Chinese newspapers commentaries in February 2004 which stated that power over Hong Kong was only fit for \"patriots.\"\n\nThe interpretation of the NPCSC to Annex I and II of the Basic Law, promulgated on 6 April 2004, made it clear that the [[National People's Congress]]' support is required over proposals to amend the electoral system under Basic Law. On 26 April 2004, the Standing Committee of National People's Congress denied the possibility of universal suffrage in 2007 (for the Chief Executive) and 2008 (for LegCo).\n\nThe NPCSC interpretation and decision were regarded as obstacles to the democratic development of Hong Kong by the democratic camp, and were criticised for lack of consultation with Hong Kong residents. On the other hand, the pro-government camp considered them to be in compliance with the legislative intent of the Basic Law and in line with the '[[One country, two systems]]' principle, and hoped that this would put an end to the controversies on development of political structure in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2007 Chief Executive Sir Donald Tsang requested for Beijing to allow direct elections for the Chief Executive. He referred to a survey which said more than half of the citizens of Hong Kong wanted direct elections by 2012. However, he said waiting for 2017 may be the best way to get two-thirds of the support of Legislative Council.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-12-12-voa22.cfm|title=Hong Kong Leader Urges Beijing to Allow More Democracy, Suggests Delay in Direct Elections|publisher=[[Voice of America News]]|date=12 December 2007|accessdate=19 December 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071216013325/http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-12-12-voa22.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 16 December 2007}}</ref> Donald Tsang announced that the NPC said it planned to allow the 2017 Chief Executive elections and the 2020 Legislative Council elections to take place by universal suffrage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7163758.stm |publisher=BBC NEWS Asia-Pacific |title=HK 'to elect its leader by 2017'|date=29 December 2007|accessdate=4 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, public concern was sparked that the election process for the Chief Executive would involve a screening process that swipes out candidates deemed suitable for the position by Beijing, incited by a comment made by a Deputy of the National People's Congress at an off-the-recorded gathering.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1188763/hk-deputy-floated-idea-screening-mechanism-chief-executive-poll|title=Hong Kong deputy floated idea of screening mechanism for chief executive poll|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=12 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Resignation of Tung Chee-hwa and interpretation of Basic Law===\n{{Main|Tung Chee Hwa's resignation}}\nOn 12 March 2005, the Chief Executive, Tung Chee-hwa, resigned. Immediately after Tung's resignation, there was dispute over the length of the term of the Chief Executive. To most local legal professionals, the length is obviously five years, under whatever circumstances.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} It should also be noted that the wording of the Basic Law on the term of the Chief Executive is substantially different from the articles in the PRC constitution concerning the length of term of the president, premier, etc. Nonetheless, legal experts from the mainland said it is a convention a successor will only serve the remainder of the term if the position is vacant because the predecessor resigned. The [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] exercised its right to interpret the Basic Law, and affirmed that the successor would only serve the remainder of the term. Many in Hong Kong saw this as having an adverse impact on one country, two systems, as the [[Central People's Government]] interpret the Basic Law to serve its need, that is, a two-year probation for Tsang, instead of a five-year term.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n===Political reform package===\n{{Main|December 2005 protest for democracy in Hong Kong}}\n[[File:Hong kong protest 2005 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstration against reform package]]\n\nOn 4 December 2005, people in Hong Kong demonstrated against Sir [[Donald Tsang]]'s proposed reform package, before a vote on 21 December.

The pro-government camp claims to have collected 700,000 signatures on a petition backing Mr. Tsang's reform package. This number, however, is widely seen as too small to influence pro-democracy lawmakers. The Reform Package debate has seen the return of key political figure and former Chief Secretary [[Anson Chan]], raising speculations of a possible run up for the 2007 Chief Executive election, though she dismissed having a personal interest in standing for the next election.\n\nIn an attempt to win last minute votes from moderate pro-democracy lawmakers, the government amended its reform package on 19 December by proposing a gradual cut in the number of [[District Councils of Hong Kong|district council]] members appointed by the Chief Executive. Their number would be reduced from 102 to 68 by 2008. It would then be decided in 2011 whether to scrap the remaining seats in 2012 or in 2016.\nThe amendment has been seen as a reluctant response by Sir Donald Tsang to give satisfaction to the democratic demands made by demonstrators on 4 December. The move has been qualified \"Too little, too late\" by pan-democrats in general.\n\nOn 21 December 2005, the reform political reform package was vetoed by the pro-democracy lawmakers. Chief Secretary [[Rafael Hui]] openly criticised pro-democracy [[Martin Lee]] and [[Bishop Zen]] for blocking the proposed changes.\n\n===Political Appointments System===\n{{Main|Political Appointments System in Hong Kong}}\nThe 24 non-civil service positions under the political appointment system comprise 11 undersecretaries and 13 political assistants.<ref name=nohurry>Bonnie Chen, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=62467&sid=17880395&con_type=1&d_str=20080304&sear_year=2008 \"No hurry to present new deputy ministers\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211062922/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=62467&sid=17880395&con_type=1&d_str=20080304&sear_year=2008 |date=11 December 2008 }}, ''[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]'', 4 March 2008</ref> The government named eight newly appointed [[Undersecretary|Undersecretaries]] on 20 May, and nine Political Assistants on 22 May 2008.

A notable example is [[Michael Rowse]], a permanent resident of Hong Kong and the current Director-General of Investment Promotion of Hong Kong Government, naturalised and became a PRC citizen, for the offices of secretaries of the [[Government of Hong Kong|policy bureaux]] are only open to PRC citizens.\n\nIn 2008, a row erupted over [[Political Appointments System|political appointees]]. Five newly appointed [[Undersecretary|Undersecretaries]] declared that they were in the process of renouncing foreign citizenship as at 4 June 2008, citing [[public opinion]] as an overriding factor, and one Assistant had initiated the renunciation process. This was done despite there being no legal or constitutional barrier for officials at this level of government to have foreign nationality.<ref name=giveup>{{cite journal|author=Ambrose Wong|title=Deputy Ministers give up passports|publisher=''South China Morning Post''|date=5 June 2008|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n===British nationality===\n{{Main|British nationality law and Hong Kong}}\nHong Kong residents who were born in Hong Kong in the British-administered era could acquire the British Dependent Territories citizenship. Hong Kong residents who were not born in Hong Kong could also naturalize as a BDTC before the handover. To allow them to retain the status of British national while preventing a possible flood of immigrants from Hong Kong, the United Kingdom created a new nationality status, [[British National (Overseas)]] that Hong Kong British Dependent Territories citizens could apply for. Holders of the BNO passport have no right of abode in the United Kingdom. See [[British nationality law and Hong Kong]] for details.\n\nBritish National (Overseas) status was given effect by the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986]. Article 4(1) of the Order provided that on and after 1 July 1987, there would be a new form of British nationality, the holders of which would be known as British Nationals (Overseas). Article 4(2) of the Order provided that adults and minors who had a connection to Hong Kong were entitled to make an application to become British Nationals (Overseas) by ''registration''.\n\nBecoming a British National (Overseas) was therefore not an automatic or involuntary process and indeed many eligible people who had the requisite connection with Hong Kong never applied to become British Nationals (Overseas). Acquisition of the new status had to be voluntary and therefore a conscious act. To make it involuntary or automatic would have been contrary to the assurances given to the Chinese government which led to the words \"eligible to\" being used in paragraph (a) of the United Kingdom Memorandum to the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]]. The deadline for applications passed in 1997. Any person who failed to register as a British Nationals (Overseas) by 1 July 1997 and were eligible to become PRC citizens became solely PRC citizens on 1 July 1997. However, any person who would be rendered stateless by failure to register as a British Nationals (Overseas) automatically became a British Overseas citizen under article 6(1) of the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986].\n\nAfter the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], people urged the British Government to grant full British citizenship to all Hong Kong BDTCs \u2013 but this request was never accepted. However, it was considered necessary to devise a [[British Nationality Selection Scheme]] to enable some of the population to obtain British citizenship. The United Kingdom made provision to grant citizenship to 50,000 families whose presence was important to the future of Hong Kong under the [[British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990|British Nationality Act (Hong Kong) 1990]].<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/34 British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 199] legislation.gov.uk, retrieved 8 March 2013</ref>\n\nAfter reunification, all PRC citizens with the right of abode in Hong Kong (holding Hong Kong permanent identity cards) are eligible to apply for the HKSAR passport issued by the Hong Kong Immigration Department. As the visa-free-visit destinations of the HKSAR passport are very similar with that of a BN(O) passport and the application fee for the former is much lower (see articles [[HKSAR passport]] and [[British passport]] for comparison and verification), the HKSAR passport is becoming more popular among residents of Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong residents who were not born in Hong Kong (and had not naturalised as a BDTC) could only apply for the [[Certificate of identity]] (CI) from the colonial government as travel document. They are not issued (by neither the British nor Chinese authorities) after handover. Former CI holders holding PRC Citizenship (e.g. born in mainland China or Macau) and are permanent residents of Hong Kong are now eligible for the HKSAR passports, making the HKSAR passports more popular.\n\nRecent changes to India's Citizenship Act, 1955 (see [[Indian nationality law]]) will also allow some children of Indian origin, born in Hong Kong after 7 January 2004], who have a solely BN(O) parent to automatically acquire British Overseas citizenship at birth under the provisions for reducing statelessness in article 6(2) or 6(3) of the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986]. If they have acquired no other nationality after birth, they will be entitled to subsequently register for full British citizenship] with right of abode in the UK.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{elect|List of political parties in Hong Kong|Elections in Hong Kong}}\n{{Main|Hong Kong legislative election, 2016}}\n{{Hong Kong legislative election, 2016}}\nThe four main political parties are as follows. Each holds a significant portion of LegCo. Thirteen members are registered as affiliated with the DAB,  eight with the Democratic Party, five with the Civic Party, three with the Liberal Party and three with the League of Social Democrats. There are also many unofficial party members: politicians who are members of political parties but have not registered such status in their election applications.

For example, the government  is involved in public works projects, healthcare, education, and [[social welfare]] spending. Further, although rates of taxation on personal and corporate income are low by international standards, unlike most other countries Hong Kong's government raises a significant portion of its revenues from land leases and land taxation. All land in Hong Kong is owned by the government and is leased to private developers and users on fixed terms, for fees which are paid to the state treasury. By restricting the sale of land leases, the Hong Kong government keeps the price of land at what some consider as artificially high prices and this allows the government to support public spending with a low tax rate on income and profit.<ref>Geocities. {{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secC12.html |title=Doesn't Hong Kong show the potentials of \"free market\" capitalism? |accessdate=2010-10-09 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020055110/http://geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secC12.html |archivedate=20 October 2009 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Fa Yuen Street, Hong Kong, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|The economy functions well into the night.]]\n\n== Economic freedom ==\n{{Further|Economic freedom}}\nHong Kong has been ranked as the world's [[freest economy]] in the [[Index of Economic Freedom]] of [[The Heritage Foundation]] for 24 consecutive years, since its inception in 1995.<ref name=\"Index of Economic Freedom\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-21/the-worlds-freest-economy-is-also-the-least-affordable-housing-market |title=The World's Freest Economy Is Also Its Least-Affordable Housing Market |publisher=Bloomburg BusinessWeek |accessdate=28 January 2014}}</ref> The index measures restrictions on business, trade, investment, finance, property rights and labour, and considers the impact of corruption, government size and monetary controls in 183 economies.

It was opened in 2009.\n* The [[Po Fook Hill Elevator]] serves the Po Fook Hill Ancestral Hall in Shatin.\n* The [[Discovery Bay Elevator]] serves the private housing estate Amalfi on Lantau Island.\n\n=== Airport people-mover system ===\n[[File:Image-Hkaiport subway02.JPG|thumb|right|200px|On the platform of the [[Hong Kong International Airport Automated People Mover]] ]]\n{{Main|Hong Kong International Airport Automated People Mover}}\n\nThe [[Hong Kong International Airport Automated People Mover]] is a driverless [[List of airport people mover systems|people-mover system]] located within the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] in [[Chek Lap Kok]]. It operates in two \"segments\". For departures, the train runs from Terminal 2 to the East Hall to the West Hall. For arrivals, the train runs only from the West Hall to the East Hall, where all passengers must disembark for immigration, customs, and baggage claim. Operation of the first segment commenced in 1998, and the operation of the second segment commenced in early-2007.\n\nThere is another system between the terminals. There is also a [[travellator]] which can be used.\n\n=== Cross-border trains ===\n[[Inter-city rail|Inter-city]] train services crossing the Hong Kong-China boundary are known as Intercity Through Trains. They are jointly operated by Hong Kong's [[MTR Corporation]] and the [[Ministry of Railways of the People's Republic of China]]. [[Hung Hom Station]] (formerly called ''Kowloon Station'') and [[West Kowloon Terminus]] are the stations in Hong Kong where passengers can catch these trains. With the exception of the XRL, passengers have to go through immigration and customs before boarding. There are currently four through train routes:\n\n* Between Hong Kong and Beijing ([[Beijing-Kowloon Through Train]])\n* Between Hong Kong and Shanghai ([[Shanghai-Kowloon Through Train]])\n* Between Hong Kong and [[Guangzhou]] ([[Guangdong Through Train (MTR)|Guangzhou-Kowloon Through Train]])\n* Between Hong Kong and Guangzhou ([[Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link]]) (XRL)\n\n==Road transport==\n\n===Buses===\n[[File:K310UD.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[Low-floor bus|low-floor]] [[double-decker bus]] with wheelchair accessibility]]\n{{Main|Bus services in Hong Kong}}\nBus services have [[History of bus transport in Hong Kong|a long history]] in Hong Kong.

In 1979, [[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]] began its operations in Hong Kong with one double-decker, providing shuttle service for the Hong Kong dockyard. It later expanded into operating a residential bus route between City One, [[Shatin]] and [[Kowloon Tong Station|Kowloon Tong MTR station]]. New World First Bus Services Limited was established in 1998, taking over [[China Motor Bus]]'s franchise to provide bus services on [[Hong Kong Island]] together with Citybus. NWFB's owner company later bought Citybus, but the two companies have basically been operating independently.\n\n===Public light buses===\n[[File:Hkgmb-lm8613.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Green [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] minibus on its route]]\n{{Main|Public light bus}}\nPublic light buses (\u5c0f\u5df4) (widely referred to as [[minibus]]es, or sometimes ''maxicabs'', a ''de facto'' [[share taxi]]) run the length and breadth of Hong Kong, through areas which the standard bus lines can not or do not reach as frequently, quickly or directly. Minibuses carry a maximum of 16 (19 for some routes since 2017) passengers; standing is not permitted.\n\nThe [[Transport Department (Hong Kong)|Hong Kong Transport Department]] (HKTD) allows and licenses the operation of two types of public light buses:\n# green minibuses that have route numbers, stop at designated stops (many routes have [[hail and ride]] sections along which passengers can board and exit anywhere unless it is a [[clearway|no-stopping zone]]) and which have their fares, service and frequency regulated by the HKTD; and\n# red minibuses that may or may not have regular routes, may or may not be numbered, may or may not have fixed stops and whose fares and service levels are not regulated by HKTD.<ref name=hktdplbp>[http://www.td.gov.hk/FileManager/EN/Content_275/plbpolicy.doc HKTD Public Light Bus Policy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104192728/http://www.td.gov.hk/FileManager/EN/Content_275/plbpolicy.doc |date=4 January 2007 }}. Accessed 11 December 2006</ref>\n\nRed minibuses often provide more convenient transport for passengers not served by green minibuses or other public buses, and are thus quite popular. Where green minibus drivers are paid fixed wages to drive their routes, red minibus drivers often rely on their fares for a living and thus are often seen to be more aggressive drivers. The prevalence of aggressive driving has resulted in the Transport Department making it mandatory for Hong Kong minibuses to be equipped with large read-out speedometers which allow passengers to track the speed at which minibus drivers operate. Currently, if minibuses exceed 80&nbsp;km/h, the speedometer will sound an audible warning signal to the driver and passengers. If the minibus exceeds 100&nbsp;km/h, the beeping will turn into a sustained tone. However, almost without exception; this warning signal is ignored by both driver and passengers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe Transport Department has also regulated, after a series of minibus accidents, that all new minibuses brought into service after August 2005 must have seat belts installed, and passengers must use seat belts when they are provided.\n\n===Taxis===\n[[File:HK Toyota Comfort Red Taxi.jpg|thumb|200px|Red taxis serve urban areas]]\n{{Main|Taxicabs of Hong Kong}}\n\n{{As of|2016|March}}, there were 18,138 taxis in Hong Kong, operating in three distinct (but slightly overlapping) geographical areas, and distinguished by their colour. Of these, 15,250 are red urban taxis, 2,838 green [[New Territories]] taxis, and 50 blue [[Lantau Island|Lantau]] taxis.<ref>{{Citation| title = Hong Kong: The Facts \u2013 Transport|accessdate =30 March 2018|date = May 2016|url =http://www.gov.hk/en/about/abouthk/factsheets/docs/transport.pdf}}</ref> Every day, they serve 1,100,000, 207,900, and 1,400 passengers respectively. Taxis carry an average of 1,000,000 passengers each day, occupying about 12% of the daily patronage carried by all modes of public transport in Hong Kong.\n\nMost of the taxis in Hong Kong run on [[autogas|LPG]] (liquified petroleum gas) to reduce emissions. In August 2000, a one-off grant was paid in cash to taxi owners who replaced their diesel taxi with an LPG one. Since August 2001, all newly purchased taxis run on LPG. By the end of 2003, over 99.8% of the taxi fleet in Hong Kong ran on LPG.<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher=Chinese University Press\n| isbn = 962-996-357-4\n| last = Yeung\n| first = Yue-man\n| title = The First Decade: The Hong Kong SAR in Retrospective and Introspective Perspectives\n| year = 2008\n| page = 340\n}}</ref>\n\nTaxi fares are charged according to the taximeter; however, additional charges on the fare table may apply, such as road tolls and luggage fees. Urban taxis are the most expensive, while Lantau taxis are the cheapest. The standard of service among different kinds of taxis is mostly the same. The reason for having three types of taxis is to ensure service availability in less populated regions, as running in the urban centre is considered to be more profitable.\n\n===Private cars===\nAs of May 2015, the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong reports that there are 504,798 licensed vehicles in Hong Kong.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.hk/pub/B10100022015MM06B0100.pdf|title=Transport, Communications and Tourism|publisher=Census and Statistics Department|accessdate=June 2015}}</ref> In terms of private car ownership, the number of cars per capita is half that of [[Singapore]] and one-third that of [[Taiwan]]. However, the Transport Advisory Committee, which advises the government on transport policies, issued a report stating that the growth of private cars is too fast and must be contained so as to alleviate congestion problems of Hong Kong.<ref name=\"thb.gov.hk\"/> Private cars are most popular in newly developed areas such as [[New Territories]] and [[Lantau]] and areas near the border with mainland China, as there are fewer public transportation options, and more parking spaces compared to other areas of Hong Kong.\n\nMost cars are [[right-hand drive]] models, from Japanese or European manufacturers. Hong Kong does not allow left-hand drive vehicles to be primarily registered in Hong Kong. However, Hong Kong registered vehicles may apply for secondary [[mainland China|mainland Chinese]] registration plates, and these can be driven across the border to mainland China; likewise, left-hand drive cars seen in Hong Kong are usually primarily registered in mainland China and carry supplementary Hong Kong registration plates.\n\nCars are subjected to a first-time registration tax, which varies from 35% to over 100%, based on the size and value of the car. The level of vehicle taxation was increased by a law passed on 2 June 1982 to discourage private car ownership,<ref>[http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/newspaper/view/16_01.03/63037.pdf Legco doubts on car curbs], South China Morning Post, 3 June 1982</ref> and also as an incentive to buy smaller, more efficient cars, as these have less tax levied on them. First-time registration tax was doubled, annual licensing fees were increased by 300%, and $0.70 duty fee was imposed on each litre of light oils.<ref>Michael Chugani, [http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/newspaper/view/16_01.01/62742.pdf Legco doubts on car curbs], South China Morning Post, 20 May 1982</ref>\n\nIn addition to the heavy traffic at times, parking may be problematic. Due to high [[urban density]], there are not many [[filling station]]s; Petrol in Hong Kong averages around US$2.04 per litre, of which over half the cost is taxes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Caltex Singapore \u2013 Why do prices rise and fall?|work=Caltex|accessdate=20 July 2009|url=http://www.caltex.com/pumpprices/whydoPricesRiseAndFall.asp}}</ref> It was suggested in the news that the government had deliberately impeded the use of new environmentally friendly diesel engines by allowing only light goods vehicles to be fuelled by diesel. While it cannot be determined why exactly the government does not allow private cars to be fuelled by diesel, it has been pointed out that the government does receive a tax that is 150% of the actual fuel cost. This is mostly to discourage car ownership for environmental reasons.<ref>Mottershead, Terri. [2004] (2004). Sustainable Development in Hong Kong. HK University. {{ISBN|962-209-491-0}}</ref>\n\nThere is a waiting list for local driving tests, while a full (private car) driving licence valid for ten years costs around US$115. Residents of Hong Kong holding licences issued by other Chinese authorities and some foreign countries can get a Hong Kong driving licence exempt from tests if they can adequately show that they obtained their licence while residing in the place concerned (common proofs are school transcripts or employer's documentation). Some private car owners, known as [[White card (taxi)|white card]] drivers, provide a taxi service for a nominal fee.\n\n===Bicycles===\n[[File:Kam Sheung Road Outside View1 201107.jpg|thumb|Bicycle parking at Kam Sheung Road Station]]\n{{main|Cycling in Hong Kong}}\nCycling is a popular means of transport in many parts of the [[New Territories]], where new towns such as [[Shatin]], [[Tai Po]] and [[Sheung Shui]] have significant [[Cycleways in Hong Kong|cycle track networks]].

The famous former [[Kai Tak International Airport]] retired in favour of the recently constructed [[Hong Kong International Airport]], also known as Chek Lap Kok International Airport. The airport now serves as a transport hub for East Asia, and as the hub for [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Dragonair]], [[Hong Kong Express]], [[Hong Kong Airlines]] (former CR Airways), and [[Air Hong Kong]]. Ferry services link the airport with several [[pier]]s in [[Pearl River Delta]], where immigrations and customs are exempted. Kai Tak airport was closed because of privacy reasons and also because of safety reasons; the aircraft came very close to the skyscrapers. Besides, the runway was surrounded by water.\n\nHKIA\u2019s network to China is also expanded by the opening of SkyPier in late-September 2003, offering millions in the PRD direct access to the airport. Passengers coming to SkyPier by high-speed ferries can board buses for onward flights while arriving air passengers can board ferries at the pier for their journeys back to the PRD. Passengers travelling in both directions can bypass custom and immigration formalities, which reduces transit time. Four ports \u2013 Shekou, Shenzhen, Macau and Humen (Dongguan) \u2013 were initially served.

Prior to the implementation of the ''Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office Act 1996'' enacted by the [[United Kingdom Parliament|British Parliament]], Hong Kong represented its interests abroad through the [[Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office]]s (HKETOs) and via a special office in the British Embassies or High Commissions, but the latter ceased after the sovereignty of Hong Kong was [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|transferred to the PRC]] and became a special administrative region (SAR) of the PRC in 1997.<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/63/contents Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office Act 1996]</ref> At present, the ''Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices'' under the [[Hong Kong Government|Government]] of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in countries that are the major trading partners of Hong Kong, including [[Japan]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], the [[United States]], the [[European Union]] as well as an ETO in [[Geneva]] to represent HKSAR Government in the [[WTO]]. These offices serve as the official representative of the Government of the Hong Kong SAR in these countries and international organisations. Its major functions include facilitating trade negotiations and handling trade related matters, inter-government relations with foreign governments; the promoting of investment in Hong Kong; and liaising with the media and business community.  The Hong Kong Government has also set up the [[Hong Kong Tourism Board]] with offices in other countries and regions to promote tourism.<ref>Article 156, [[Hong Kong Basic Law]]</ref>\n\nThe Hong Kong SAR Government also has an office in Beijing, and three HKETOs at [[Guangzhou]] ([[Guangdong]] ETO), Shanghai and [[Chengdu]]. An HKETO will be set up at [[Wuhan]] in the future. The Central People's Government of the PRC also maintains a liaison office in Hong Kong. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a representative office in Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong makes strenuous law enforcement efforts, but faces serious challenges in controlling transit of heroin and [[methamphetamine]] to regional and world markets; modern banking systems that provide a conduit for [[money laundering]]; rising indigenous use of synthetic drugs, especially among young people.\n\nHong Kong has its own immigration policy and administration. [[Hong Kong permanent resident|Permanent resident]]s of Hong Kong with PRC nationality hold a different type of passport, called the [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Passport]], which is different from that for PRC citizens in [[Mainland China]].<ref>Article 154, [[Hong Kong Basic Law]]</ref> Hong Kong permanent residents and mainland Chinese need a passport-like document (the \"[[Home Return Permit]]\" for Hong Kong permanent residents and the [[Two-way Permit]] for Mainland Chinese) to cross the Sino-Hong Kong border. Visitors from other countries and regions not participating in waiver programme are required to apply for visas directly to the Hong Kong Immigration Department.\n\n==Agreements with foreign states==\nIn accordance with Article 151 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong concluded over 20 agreements with foreign states in 2010 on matters such as economic and financial co-operation, maritime technical co-operation, postal co-operation and co-operation on wine-related businesses. With the authorisation of the Central People's Government of the PRC, Hong Kong also concluded 12 bilateral agreements with foreign states on air services, investment promotion and protection, mutual legal assistance and visa abolition during the year.\n\n==International organisation participation==\n{|\n|\n*[[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]]\n*[[Asian Development Bank]]\n*[[Bank for International Settlements]]\n*[[Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (Associate)\n*[[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]]\n*[[International Chamber of Commerce]]\n*[[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]]\n*[[International Hydrographic Organization]]\n*[[International Maritime Organization]] (Associate)\n*[[International Monetary Fund]]\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n*[[International Olympic Committee]] (through [[Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China|Hong Kong Olympic Committee]])\n*[[International Organization for Standardization]] (Correspondent)\n*[[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]] (Sub-Bureau)\n*[[Universal Postal Union]]\n*[[Venerable Order of Saint John]] (Associated Body)\n*[[World Confederation of Labour]]\n*[[World Customs Organization]]\n*[[World Meteorological Organization]]\n*[[World Tourism Organization]] (Associate)\n*[[World Trade Organization]]\n|\n|}\n\n==Overseas visits made by senior officials==\nThe [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] and other senior officials often make a duty visit to foreign countries. These visits usually aim to advance Hong Kong's economic and trade relations with the foreign countries. During these visits, the Chief Executive will meet with political and business leaders. Usually, the [[head of state]] or [[head of government]] of the foreign countries will receive the Chief Executive. For example, former Chief Executive [[Tung Chee-hwa]] made three visits to the United States during his term. In these three visits, Tung Chee-hwa met with the [[U.S. President]] in the [[Oval Office]] at the [[White House]]. Chief Executive [[Donald Tsang]] had visited Japan, South Korea, Russia, United Kingdom, United States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Brazil, India, France and other countries during his term of government.\n\nFor example, Chief Executive [[Donald Tsang]] visited London and [[Edinburgh]] on 2011 as part of his European tour to renew ties with the UK and promote Hong Kong as a gateway to Asia. He met Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]], and the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.gov.hk/en/photo_gallery/people/html/2011/09/20110919_114007.shtml|title=news.gov.hk - Photo Gallery - People|author=|date=|website=www.news.gov.hk}}</ref> In Mid-2011, Donald Tsang visited Australia in June to strengthen ties between Hong Kong and Australia, promote trade opportunities, and encourage more Australian companies, particularly resources companies, to list in Hong Kong. During his visit, Mr Tsang held meetings with the Prime Minister, [[Julia Gillard]], and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, [[Kevin Rudd]], as well as the leader of the Opposition, [[Tony Abbott]], and the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, [[Julie Bishop]].\n\nMany foreign dignitaries visit Hong Kong each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.protocol.gov.hk/eng/vip/index.html|title=Protocol Division Government Secretariat - VIP Visits|author=|date=|website=www.protocol.gov.hk}}</ref> The number of such visits has grown since 1997 as many of them have included Hong Kong as a destination on their trips to China, while others have visited Hong Kong specifically to see \"[[one country, two systems]]\" in operation. The level of VIP visits is also boosted by major international conferences held in Hong Kong in recent years. In 2009\u20132012, there were 11 official visits to Hong Kong, including the visits of the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Secretary of State of the United States of America]], [[President of the Russian Federation]], [[President of the Republic of Indonesia]], [[President of the Republic of Korea]] and other foreign dignitaries.\n\n==Overseas representation in Hong Kong==\n{{see also|List of diplomatic missions in Hong Kong}}\nWhen Hong Kong was under [[British Hong Kong|British rule]], most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] member states, unlike other countries, were represented in Hong Kong by Commissions. However, following the 1997 handover, they were all renamed Consulates-General. Owing to Hong Kong's economic importance, and the large number of British passport holders, the [[British Consulate-General, Hong Kong and Macao|British Consulate-General]] is the largest of its kind in the world and bigger than many British Embassies and High Commissions abroad.<ref name=\"GOV.UK\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-consulate-general-hong-kong|title=British Consulate General Hong Kong - GOV.UK|author=|date=|website=www.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nMost countries maintain Consulates-General or Consulates in Hong Kong. However, despite their name, many Consulates-General are not subordinate to their country's embassy to the PRC in Beijing. For example, the British Consulate-General is directly subordinate to the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] of the UK rather than the British embassy in the Chinese capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmfaff/649/64907.htm|title=House of Commons - The UK's relations with Hong Kong: 30 years after the Joint Declaration - Foreign Affairs|first=The Committee Office, House of|last=Commons|date=|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref> The Consul-General of the United States, likewise, holds ambassadorial rank, and reports to the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs in the US Department of State.<ref>[http://www.ait.org.tw/en/pressrelease-pr1224.htm  Christopher J.

about {{convert|1700|nmi|km}} southwest of [[Honolulu]]. The island lies almost halfway between [[Hawaii]] and [[Australia]] and is an [[Territories of the United States|unincorporated]], [[unorganized territory]] of the [[United States]]. [[geography|Geographically]], together with [[Baker Island]] it forms part of the [[Phoenix Islands]]. For statistical purposes, Howland is grouped as one of the [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]]. It is located at {{Coord|0|48|25.84|N|176|36|59.48|W|type:isle_region:UM-84|display=inline,title}}.<ref>{{cite gnis|id=1393033|name=Howland Island|accessdate= February 24, 2009}}</ref> It covers {{convert|1112|acre|km2}}, with {{convert|4|mi|km}} of coastline. The island has an elongated [[Banana|plantain]]-shape on a north\u2013south axis. There is no [[lagoon]].\n\nHowland Island National Wildlife Refuge consists of the entire island and the surrounding {{convert|32074|acre|km2}} of submerged land. The island is managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] as an [[insular area]] under the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]] and is part of the [[Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument]].\n\nThe atoll has no [[Economy|economic activity]]. It is perhaps best known as the island [[Amelia Earhart]] was searching for but never reached when her airplane disappeared on July 2, 1937, during her planned round-the-world flight. Airstrips constructed to accommodate her planned stopover were subsequently damaged, were not maintained and gradually disappeared. There are no harbors or docks. The [[fringing reef]]s may pose a maritime hazard. There is a boat landing area along the middle of the sandy beach on the west coast, as well as a crumbling [[day beacon]]. The island is visited every two years by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.<ref>[http://www.fws.gov/refuges/profiles/index.cfm?id=12512 \"Howland Island  National Wildlife Refuge.\"] ''fws.gov''.

The terrain is low-lying and sandy: a coral island surrounded by a narrow fringing [[reef]] with a slightly raised central area. The highest point is about six meters above [[sea level]].\n\nThere are no natural [[freshwater|fresh water]] resources.<ref name=CIA>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/um.html#Geo \"United States Pacific Island Wildlife Refuges.\"] ''CIA: The World Factbook.'' {{ISSN|1553-8133}}.

The island was a known navigation hazard for many decades and several ships were wrecked there. Its [[guano]] deposits were mined by American companies from about 1857 until October 1878, although not without controversy.\n\nCaptain Geo. E. Netcher  of the ''Isabella'' informed Captain Taylor of its discovery. As Taylor had discovered another guano island in the Indian Ocean, they agreed to share the benefits of the guano on the two islands. Taylor put Netcher in communication with Alfred G. Benson, president of the American Guano Company, which was incorporated in 1857.<ref name=\"New York Times\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/03/news/guano-companies-litigation-case-interest-stockholders-supreme-court-general-term.html \"The Guano Companies in Litigation \u2013 A Case of Interest to Stockholders.\"] ''The New York Times'', May 3, 1865.

Benson tried to interest the American Guano Company in the Howland Island deposits, however the company directors considered they already had sufficient deposits. In October 1857 the American Guano Company sent Benson's son Arthur to Baker and Jarvis Islands to survey the guano deposits. He also visited Howland Island and took samples of the guano. Subsequently, Alfred G. Benson resigned from the American Guano Company and together with Netcher, Taylor and George W. Benson formed the United States Guano Company to exploit the guano on Howland Island, with this claim being recognised under the U.S. [[Guano Islands Act]] of 1856.<ref name=\"New York Times\"/>\n\nHowever, when the United States Guano Company dispatched a vessel in 1859 to mine the guano they found that Howland Island was already occupied by men sent there by the American Guano Company.

The end result was that both companies were allowed to mine the guano deposits, which were substantially depleted by October 1878.<ref>[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GAOREPORTS-OGC-98-5/content-detail.html \"GAO/OGC-98-5 - U.S. Insular Areas: Application of the U.S. Constitution.\"] ''U.S. Government Printing Office'', November 7, 1997.

It began with a rotating group of four alumni and students from the [[Kamehameha Schools|Kamehameha School]] for Boys, a private school in [[Honolulu]]. Although the recruits had signed on as part of a scientific expedition and expected to spend their three-month assignment collecting botanical and biological samples, once out to sea they were told, \"Your names will go down in history\" and that the islands would become \"famous air bases in a route that will connect Australia with California\".\n\nThe settlement was named '''Itascatown''' after the USCGC [[USCGC Itasca (1929)|''Itasca'']] that brought the colonists to Howland and made regular cruises between the other equatorial islands during that era. Itascatown was a line of a half-dozen small wood-framed structures and tents near the beach on the island's western side. The fledgling colonists were given large stocks of canned food, water, and other supplies including a gasoline-powered refrigerator, radio equipment, complete medical kits and (characteristic of that era) vast quantities of cigarettes. Fishing provided much-needed variety for their diet. Most of the colonists' endeavors involved making hourly weather observations and gradually developing a rudimentary infrastructure on the island, including the clearing of a landing strip for airplanes. During this period the island was on Hawaii time, which was then 10.5 hours behind [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]].{{refn|Quote: Thursday, July 1, 1937... Howland Island was using the 10+30 hour time zone \u2014 the same as Hawaii standard time...\"<ref>Long 1999, p. 206.</ref>|group=Note}} Similar colonization projects were started on nearby [[Baker Island]], [[Jarvis Island]] and two other islands.\n\n===Kamakaiwi Field===\nGround was cleared for a rudimentary aircraft landing area during the mid-1930s, in anticipation that the island might eventually become a stopover for commercial trans-Pacific air routes and also to further U.S. territorial claims in the region against rival claims from Great Britain. Howland Island was designated as a scheduled refueling stop for American pilot [[Amelia Earhart]] and navigator [[Fred Noonan]] on their [[Amelia Earhart#1937 world flight|round-the-world flight]] in 1937. [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) funds were used by the [[United States government role in civil aviation|Bureau of Air Commerce]] to construct three graded, unpaved runways meant to accommodate Earhart's twin-engined [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra]].\n\nThe facility was named ''Kamakaiwi Field'' after James Kamakaiwi, a young Hawaiian who arrived with the first group of four colonists. He was selected as the group's leader and he spent more than three years on Howland, far longer than the average recruit. It has also been referred to as ''WPA Howland Airport'' (the WPA contributed about 20 percent of the $12,000 cost). Earhart and Noonan took off from [[Lae]], [[New Guinea]], and their radio transmissions were picked up near the island when their aircraft reached the vicinity but they were never seen again.\n\n===Japanese attacks during World War II===\n[[File:HowlandIslandLightWW2damage.jpg|thumb|left|Earhart Light, pictured here showing damage it sustained during World War II, was named for [[Amelia Earhart]] during the late 1930s.]]\nA [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]ese air attack on December 8, 1941 by 14 twin-engined [[Mitsubishi G3M]] \"Nell\" bombers of [[Chitose Air Group|Chitose K\u014dk\u016btai]], from Kwajalein islands, killed two of the Kamehameha School colonists: Richard \"Dicky\" Kanani Whaley, and Joseph Kealoha Keli\u02bbhananui. The raid came one day after the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] and damaged the three airstrips of Kamakaiwi Field. Two days later a Japanese submarine shelled what was left of the colony's few buildings into ruins.<ref>Butler 1999, p. 419.</ref> A single bomber returned twice during the following weeks and dropped more bombs on the rubble of tiny Itascatown. The two survivors were finally evacuated by the [[USS Helm (DD-388)|USS ''Helm'']], a U.S. Navy destroyer, on January 31, 1942. Howland was occupied by a [[battalion]] of the [[United States Marine Corps]] in September 1943 and known as Howland Naval Air Station until May 1944.\n\nAll attempts at habitation were abandoned after 1944.

It measures about 250&nbsp;km from north to south and 524&nbsp;km from east to west. It has 2,106&nbsp;km of boundaries, shared with [[Austria]] to the west, [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]] to the south and southwest, [[Romania]] to the southeast, [[Ukraine]] to the northeast, and [[Slovakia]] to the north.\n\nHungary's modern borders were first established after [[World War I]] when, by the terms of the [[Treaty of Trianon]] in 1920, it lost more than 71% of what had formerly been the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], 58.5% of its population, and 32% of the Hungarians. The country secured some boundary revisions from 1938 to 1941: In 1938 the [[First Vienna Award]] gave back territory from [[Czechoslovakia]], in 1939 Hungary occupied [[Carpatho-Ukraine]]. In 1940 the [[Second Vienna Award]] gave back [[Northern Transylvania]] and finally Hungary occupied the [[Ba\u010dka|B\u00e1cska]] and [[Me\u0111imurje County|Murak\u00f6z]] regions during the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia]]. However, Hungary lost these territories again with its defeat in [[World War II]]. After World War II, the Trianon boundaries were restored with a small revision that benefited Czechoslovakia.\n\nMost of the country has an elevation of less than 200 m. Although Hungary has several moderately high ranges of mountains, those reaching heights of 300 m or more cover less than 2% of the country. The highest point in the country is [[K\u00e9kes]] (1,014 m) in the [[M\u00e1tra|M\u00e1tra Mountains]] northeast of [[Budapest]]. The lowest spot is 77.6 m above sea level, located in the south of Hungary, near [[Szeged]].\n\nThe major rivers in the country are the [[Danube]] and [[Tisza]]. The Danube is navigable within Hungary for 418 kilometers. The Tisza River is navigable for 444&nbsp;km in the country. Less important rivers include the [[Drava]] along the Croatian border, the [[R\u00e1ba]], the [[Some\u0219 (river)|Szamos]], the [[Si\u00f3]], and the [[Ipe\u013e|Ipoly]] along the Slovakian border. Hungary has three major lakes. [[Lake Balaton]], the largest, is 78&nbsp;km long and from 3 to 14&nbsp;km wide, with an area of 600 square km <ref>http://www.kdtvizig.hu/hu/53ab9177-7e15-44eb-a7f3-c004010c2277</ref>. Hungarians often refer to it as the ''Hungarian Sea''. It is Central Europe's largest [[freshwater]] lake and an important recreation area. Its shallow waters offer good summer swimming, and in winter its frozen surface provides excellent opportunities for winter sports. Smaller bodies of water are [[Lake Velence]] (26 square km) in Fej\u00e9r County and Lake Fert\u0151 ([[Neusiedler See]]\u2014about 82 square km within Hungary), and the artificial [[Lake Tisza]].\n\nHungary has three major geographic regions (which are subdivided to seven smaller ones): the [[Great Alf\u00f6ld]], lying east of the Danube River; the [[Transdanubia]], a hilly region lying west of the Danube and extending to the Austrian foothills of the [[Alps]]; and the [[North Hungarian Mountains]], which is a mountainous and hilly country beyond the northern boundary of the Great Hungarian Plain.\n\nThe country's best natural resource is fertile land, although soil quality varies greatly. About 70% of the country's total territory is suitable for agriculture; of this portion, 72% is arable land. Hungary lacks extensive domestic sources of energy and raw materials needed for industrial development.\n\n==Plains and hills==\n[[File:Mesoregions of Hungary.png|thumb|right|Physico-geographical mesoregions of Hungary : <br>1., [[Great Hungarian Plain]] <br>2., [[North Hungarian Mountains]] <br>3., [[Transdanubian Mountains]] <br>4., [[Transdanubian Hills]] <br>5., [[Little Hungarian Plain]] <br>6., [[West-Hungarian Borderland]]]]\n:: ''Main articles: [[Little Hungarian Plain]], [[Transdanubia]], [[Great Alf\u00f6ld]].''\n\n[[File:Hortob\u00e1gy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hortob\u00e1gy National Park]] on the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] with [[Racka]] sheep]]\nThe Little Alf\u00f6ld or Little Hungarian Plain is a plain (tectonic basin) of approximately 8,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in northwestern Hungary, southwestern Slovakia and eastern Austria, along the lower course of the [[R\u00e1ba]] River, with high quality fertile soils.\n\nThe Transdanubia region lies in the western part of the country, bounded by the Danube River, the Drava River, and the remainder of the country's border with Slovenia and Croatia. It lies south and west of the course of the Danube. It contains Lake Fert\u0151 and Lake Balaton. The region consists mostly of rolling hills. Transdanubia is primarily an agricultural area, with flourishing crops, livestock, and viticulture. Mineral deposits and oil are found in [[Zala County|Zala county]] close to the border of Croatia.\n\nThe Great Alf\u00f6ld contains the basin of the Tisza River and its branches. It encompasses more than half of the country's territory. Bordered by mountains on all sides, it has a variety of terrains, including regions of fertile soil, sandy areas, wastelands, and swampy areas. Hungarians have inhabited the Great Plain for at least a millennium. Here is found the [[puszta]], a long, and uncultivated expanse (the most famous such area still in existence is the [[Hortob\u00e1gy National Park]]), with which much Hungarian folklore is associated. In earlier centuries, the Great Plain was unsuitable for farming because of frequent flooding. Instead, it was the home of massive herds of cattle and horses. In the last half of the 19th century, the government sponsored programs to control the riverways and expedite inland drainage in the Great Plain. With the danger of recurrent flooding largely eliminated, much of the land was placed under cultivation, and herding ceased to be a major contributor to the area's economy.\n\n==Mountains==\n:: ''Main articles: [[Alpokalja]], [[Transdanubian Mountains]], [[Mecsek]], [[North Hungarian Mountains]].''\n\nAlthough the majority of the country has an elevation lesser than 300 m, Hungary has several moderately high ranges of mountains. They can be classified to four geographic regions, from west to east: [[Alpokalja]], [[Transdanubian Mountains]], [[Mecsek]] and [[North Hungarian Mountains]]. Alpokalja (literally ''the foothills of the [[Alps]]'') is located along the [[Austria]]n border; its highest point is [[\u00cdrott-k\u0151]] with an elevation of 882 metres. The Transdanubian Mountains stretch from the west part of [[Lake Balaton]] to the [[Danube Bend]] near [[Budapest]], where it meets the North Hungarian Mountains. Its tallest peak is the 757 m high [[Pilis]]. [[Mecsek]] is the southernmost Hungarian mountain range, located north from [[P\u00e9cs]] - Its highest point is the [[Zeng\u0151]] with 682 metres.\n\nThe North Hungarian Mountains lie north of Budapest and run in a northeasterly direction south of the border with Slovakia. The higher ridges, which are mostly forested, have rich coal and iron deposits. Minerals are a major resource of the area and have long been the basis of the industrial economies of cities in the region. Viticulture is also important, producing the famous [[Tokaji]] wine. The highest peak of it is the [[K\u00e9kes]], located in the [[M\u00e1tra]] mountain range.\n\n===Highest independent peaks===\n[[File:Tajkep mderecskerol matra.jpg|275px|thumb|1.

The average annual temperature is about {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on|lk=on}}, in summer {{convert|27|to|35|C|F}}, and in winter {{convert|0|to|-15|C|F}}, with extremes ranging from about {{convert|42|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in summer to {{convert|-35|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in winter. Average yearly rainfall is about {{convert|600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. Distribution and frequency of rainfall are unpredictable. The western part of the country usually receives more rain than the eastern part, where severe droughts may occur in summertime. Weather conditions in the Great Plain can be especially harsh, with hot summers, cold winters, and scant rainfall.\n\nBy the 1980s, the countryside was beginning to show the effects of pollution, both from herbicides used in agriculture and from industrial pollutants. Most noticeable was the gradual contamination of the country's bodies of water, endangering fish and wildlife. Although concern was mounting over these disturbing threats to the environment, no major steps had yet been taken to arrest them.\n\n==Rivers and lakes==\n{{main|Hydrology of Hungary}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{|border=0 width=100%\n|colspan=2|'''Rivers'''\n\nThe springs of the major Hungarian rivers are outside the country.

It covers about 48.57% of the country, which is outstanding in the world (see the related [[:File:Arable land percent world.png|map]]). The mass majority of the [[fertile soil]] has a good quality.\n\nThe most important agricultural zones are the [[Little Hungarian Plain]] (it has the highest quality fertile soil in average), [[Transdanubia]], and the [[Great Hungarian Plain]]. The last covers more than half of the country (52,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in number), whereas soil quality varies extremely; the territory even contains a small, grassy [[semi-desert]], the so-called [[puszta]] (steppe in English). Puszta is exploited by [[sheep]] and [[cattle]] raising.\n\nThe most important Hungarian agricultural products include [[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[oat]], [[sunflower]], [[poppy]],<!-- [[just poppy seed, or poppyseed oil or opium too? --> [[potato]], [[millet]], [[beet|sugar-beet]], [[flax]], and many other plants. There are also some newly naturalized plants too, for example [[amaranth]]. [[Poppy seed]] is part of the traditional [[Hungarian cuisine]].\n\n[[File:Paprikahungarian.jpg|right|thumb|A greengrocer's in Hungary]] The country is well known for producing high quality [[Capsicum annuum|peppers]], which are often made into [[paprika]]. There are numerous fruits reared, including many subspecies of [[apple]], [[pear]], [[peach]], [[grape]], [[apricot]], [[watermelon]], [[cantaloupe]], etc.\n\nHungary does not grow any [[Genetically modified organism|GMO]] products, thus these products are mainly imported from the [[United States]]. They cannot, however, be distributed without a mark on the wrapping.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n===Viticulture===\nWine production has a long history in Hungary. There are two languages in [[Europe]] in which the word for \"wine\" does not derive from the [[Latin language|Latin]], being [[Greek language|Greek]] &ndash; and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. The Hungarian word is ''bor''.\n\nViticulture has been recorded in the territory of today's Hungary since the Roman times, who were responsible for the introduction of the cultivation of wines. The arriving Hungarians took over the practice and have maintained it ever since.\n\nToday, there are numerous wine regions in Hungary, producing quality and inexpensive wines as well, comparable to Western European ones. The majority of the country's wine regions are located in the mountains or in the hills, such as [[Transdanubian Mountains]], [[North Hungarian Mountains]], [[Vill\u00e1ny Mountains]], and so on. Important ones include the regions of [[Eger]], [[Haj\u00f3s]], [[Soml\u00f3]], [[Sopron]], [[Vill\u00e1ny]], [[Szeksz\u00e1rd]], and [[Tokaj-Hegyalja]].\n\n===Forestry===\n19% of the country is covered by [[forest]]s. These are mainly mountainous areas, such as the North Hungarian and the Transdanubian Mountains, and the [[Alpokalja]]. The composition of forests is various, with trees like [[fir]], [[beech]], [[oak]], [[willow]], [[acacia]], [[Platanus|plane]], etc. {{See also|Honey production in Hungary}}\n\n==Political geography==\n{{Further|Counties of Hungary|NUTS of Hungary}}\n\nHungary's current [[Counties of Hungary|counties]] are largely based on the country's historic regions. The counties are subdivided into ''[[Districts of Hungary|district]]s'' (''j\u00e1r\u00e1s''), and these are further divided into ''[[municipality|municipalities]]'' (''telep\u00fcl\u00e9s'').

After the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], most of the territory of Hungary got into Ottoman rule. In that time, especially in the 17th century, many Serb, and other Southern Slavic immigrants settled in Hungary. Most of the Ottoman soldiers in the territory of present-day Hungary were [[South Slavs]] (the [[Janissary]]). After the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] withdrawal, Kingdom of Hungary came under [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] rule, a new wave of Serb refugees migrated to the area around 1690, as a consequence of the Habsburg-Ottoman war. In the first half of the 18th century, Serbs and South Slavs were ethnic majority in several cities in Hungary.\n\n====Germans====\n[[Germans of Hungary|Three waves of German]] migration can be distinguished in Hungary before the 20th century. The first two waves of settlers arrived to the Hungarian Kingdom in the Middle Ages (11th and 13th centuries) in [[Upper Hungary]] and in Southern [[Transylvania]] ([[Transylvanian Saxons]]).\n\nThe third, largest wave of German-speaking immigrants into Hungary occurred after the withdrawal of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from Hungarian territory, after the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]]. Between 1711 and 1780, German-speaking settlers immigrated to the regions of Southern Hungary, mostly region of [[B\u00e1n\u00e1t]], [[B\u00e1cs-Bodrog]], [[Baranya County (former)|Baranya]] and [[Tolna (county)|Tolna]] counties (as well as into present-day [[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]]), which had been depopulated by the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]]. At the end of the 18th century, the Kingdom of Hungary contained over one million German-speaking residents (collectively known as [[Danube Swabians]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://feefhs.org/BANAT/BHISTORY.HTML |title=History of German Settlements in Southern Hungary |author=Sue Clarkson |publisher=Feefhs.org |accessdate=2009-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970204103909/http://www.feefhs.org/banat/bhistory.html |archivedate=1997-02-04 |df= }}</ref> In 2011, 131,951 people declared to be German in Hungary (1,6%).<ref>[http://www.nepszamlalas2001.hu/eng/volumes/18/tables/load1_30_1.html \"18.

The new economic and social orders created private ownership of land. There are three forms of existence{{clarify|date=December 2016}}: the royal, ecclesiastical and secular private estate. The royal estate of the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty]] had evolved from the tribal lands.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe origin of the secular private holdings dates back to the conquest tribal common estates{{clarify|date=December 2016}}, which are increasingly in charge of the society and grows over private ownership of the becoming leaders.\n\nHowever, from the founding of the state the royal gift also entered the multiplying factors secular private property line. This organization developed a feudal estate, which had two elements: the ancient estate and the possessions which were awarded by [[Saint Stephen I]], and then the royal donations. Over the holder unrestricted right granted by the latter lineal heir almost returned to the king. In the Order of the laws changed in 1351, which abolished the nobility's possessions for free disposal. It forbidden the nobility to sale their inherited land.\n\nThe [[Carpathian Basin]] was more suitable for agriculture than large livestock grazing, and therefore increased steadily in the former weight. In the 11th and 12th centuries natural farming and soil changer tillage systems met: grazing the animals, and they used the fertilized land until depletion. The most important tools for the agriculture were the plow and the ox.\n\n=== Anjou Age ===\n\n=== Hungarian economy prior to the transition ===\n\n[[File:Berthold Weiss Canned Foods.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Berthold and [[Manfred Weiss Canned Food Factory]] (1880)]]\n[[File:BKIK \u00e9p\u00fclete.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Budapest, beginning of the 20th century]] \t\t \t\nThe Hungarian economy prior to [[World War II]] was primarily oriented toward agriculture and small-scale manufacturing. Hungary's strategic position in [[Europe]] and its relative high lack of natural resources also have dictated a traditional reliance on foreign trade. For instance, its largest car manufacturer, [[Magomobil]] (maker of the ''Magosix''), produced a total of a few thousand units.<ref>[[G.N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886\u20131930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)</ref> In the early 1920s the textile industry began to expand rapidly, by 1928 it became the most important industry in the foreign trade of Hungary exporting textile goods worth more than 60 million peng\u0151s in that year. Companies like [[M\u00c1VAG]] exported locomotives to [[India]] and [[South-America]], its [[locomotive no. 601]] was the largest and most powerful in [[Europe]] at the time.\n\nFrom the late 1940s, the [[Communist]] government started to nationalise the industry. At first only factories with more than 100 workers were nationalized, later this limit was reduced to only 10. In the agriculture, the government started a disastrous programme of [[Collectivization in Hungary|collectivization]]. From the early 1950s more and more new factories were built. This rapid and forced industrialization followed the standard [[Stalinist]] pattern in an effort to encourage a more self-sufficient economy. Most economic activity was conducted by state-owned enterprises or cooperatives and state farms. In 1968, [[Stalinist]] self-sufficiency was replaced by the \"[[New Economic Mechanism]]\", which reopened Hungary to foreign trade, gave limited freedom to the workings of the market, and allowed a limited number of small businesses to operate in the services sector.\t\n\nAlthough Hungary enjoyed one of the most liberal and economically advanced economies of the former [[Eastern Bloc]], both agriculture and industry began to suffer from a lack of investment in the 1970s, and Hungary's net foreign debt rose significantly\u2014from $1&nbsp;billion in 1973 to $15&nbsp;billion in 1993\u2014due largely to consumer subsidies and unprofitable state enterprises. In the face of economic stagnation, Hungary opted to try further liberalization by passing a joint venture law, instating an income tax, and joining the [[International Monetary Fund]] ([[IMF]]) and the [[World Bank]]. By 1988, Hungary had developed a two-tier banking system and had enacted significant corporate legislation which paved the way for the ambitious market-oriented reforms of the post-communist years.\n\n===Transition to a market economy===\n[[File:ING-Bank-szekhaz-P2030395-lev-1000.jpg|thumb|left|ING headquarters in Budapest]]\t \nAfter the fall of communism, the former Eastern Bloc had to transition from a one-party, centrally [[planned economy]] to a market economy with a [[multi-party system|multi-party political system]]. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Eastern Bloc countries suffered a significant loss in both markets for goods, and subsidizing from the Soviet Union.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Hungary, for example, \"lost nearly 70% of its export markets in Eastern and Central Europe.\" The loss of external markets in Hungary left \"800,000 unemployed people because all the unprofitable and unsalvageable factories had been closed.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koed.hu/medit/endre.pdf|title=The Political and Economic Transition in Hungary|format=PDF}}</ref> Another form of Soviet subsidizing that greatly affected Hungary after the fall of communism was the loss of social welfare programs.{{original research inline|date=May 2013}} Because of the lack of subsidies and a need to reduce expenditures, many social programs in Hungary had to be cut in an attempt to lower spending. As a result, many people in Hungary suffered incredible hardships during the transition to a market economy. Following [[privatization]] and tax reductions on Hungarian businesses, unemployment suddenly rose to 12% in 1991 (it was 1.7% in 1990 ), gradually decreasing until 2001. Economic growth, after a fall in 1991 to \u221211.9%, gradually grew until the end of the 1990s at an average annual rate of 4.2%. With the stabilization of the new market economy, Hungary has experienced growth in [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] with a \"cumulative foreign direct investment totaling more than $60&nbsp;billion since 1989.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/hu.html|title=CIA \u2013 The World Factbook \u2013 Hungary}}</ref>\t\n\nThe [[J\u00f3zsef Antall|Antall]] government of 1990\u201394 began market reforms with price and trade liberation measures, a revamped tax system, and a nascent market-based banking system. By 1994, however, the costs of government overspending and hesitant privatization had become clearly visible. Cuts in consumer subsidies led to increases in the price of food, medicine, transportation services, and energy. Reduced exports to the former Soviet bloc and shrinking industrial output contributed to a sharp decline in GDP. Unemployment rose rapidly to about 12% in 1993. The external debt burden, one of the highest in Europe, reached 250% of annual export earnings, while the budget and current account deficits approached 10% of GDP. The [[devaluation]] of the currency (in order to support exports), without effective stabilization measures, such as [[indexation]] of wages, provoked an extremely high inflation rate, that in 1991 reached 35% and slightly decreased until 1994, growing again in 1995. In March 1995, the government of Prime Minister [[Gyula Horn]] implemented an austerity program, coupled with aggressive privatization of state-owned enterprises and an export-promoting exchange raw regime, to reduce indebtedness, cut the current account deficit, and shrink public spending. By the end of 1997 the consolidated public sector deficit decreased to 4.6% of GDP\u2014with public sector spending falling from 62% of GDP to below 50%\u2014the current account deficit was reduced to 2% of GDP, and government debt was paid down to 94% of annual export earnings.\t \n[[File:Megyeri h\u00edd.jpg|220px|thumb|upright|[[Megyeri Bridge]]]]\t\n\nThe Government of Hungary no longer requires IMF financial assistance and has repaid all of its debt to the fund. Consequently, Hungary enjoys favorable borrowing terms. Hungary's sovereign foreign currency debt issuance carries investment-grade ratings from all major credit-rating agencies, although recently the country was downgraded by Moody's, S&P and remains on negative outlook at Fitch. In 1995 Hungary's currency, the Forint (HUF), became convertible for all current account transactions, and subsequent to [[OECD]] membership in 1996, for almost all capital account transactions as well. Since 1995, Hungary has pegged the forint against a basket of currencies (in which the U.S. dollar is 30%), and the central rate against the basket is devalued at a preannounced rate, originally set at 0.8% per month, the Forint is now an entirely free-floating currency. The government privatization program ended on schedule in 1998: 80% of GDP is now produced by the private sector, and foreign owners control 70% of financial institutions, 66% of industry, 90% of telecommunications, and 50% of the trading sector.\t \n[[File:K\u0151r\u00f6shegy l\u00e9gifot\u00f3.jpg|thumb|left|K\u0151r\u00f6shegy Viaduct]]\t\n\nAfter Hungary's GDP declined about 18% from 1990 to 1993 and grew only 1%\u20131.5% up to 1996, strong [[export performance]] has propelled GDP growth to 4.4% in 1997, with other macroeconomic indicators similarly improving. These successes allowed the government to concentrate in 1996 and 1997 on major structural reforms such as the implementation of a fully funded pension system (partly modelled after [[Chile pension system|Chile's pension system]] with major modifications), reform of higher education, and the creation of a national treasury. Remaining economic challenges include reducing fiscal deficits and inflation, maintaining stable external balances, and completing structural reforms of the tax system, health care, and local government financing. Recently, the overriding goal of Hungarian economic policy has been to prepare the country for entry into the European Union, which it joined in late 2004.\t\n\nPrior to the change of regime in 1989, 65% of Hungary's trade was with [[Comecon]] countries. By the end of 1997, Hungary had shifted much of its trade to the West. Trade with EU countries and the OECD now comprises over 70% and 80% of the total, respectively. Germany is Hungary's single most important trading partner. The US has become Hungary's sixth-largest export market, while Hungary is ranked as the 72nd largest export market for the U.S. Bilateral trade between the two countries increased 46% in 1997 to more than $1&nbsp;billion. The U.S. has extended to Hungary most-favored-nation status, the Generalized System of Preferences, Overseas Private Investment Corporation insurance, and access to the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]].\t\n\nWith about $18&nbsp;billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) since 1989, Hungary has attracted over one-third of all FDI in central and eastern Europe, including the former Soviet Union. Of this, about $6&nbsp;billion came from American companies. Foreign capital is attracted by skilled and relatively inexpensive labor, tax incentives, modern infrastructure, and a good telecommunications system.\t\n\nBy 2006 Hungary's economic outlook had deteriorated. Wage growth had kept up with other nations in the region; however, this growth has largely been driven by increased government spending. This has resulted in the budget deficit ballooning to over 10% of GDP and inflation rates predicted to exceed 6%. This prompted [[Roubini|Nouriel Roubini]], a White House economist in the Clinton administration, to state that \"Hungary is an accident waiting to happen.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/world/2006-06-22-hungary-usat_x.htm|title=Hungary faces enormous economic hurdles|publisher=[[USAToday]]|accessdate=5 December 2008|first=David J.|last=Lynch|date=23 June 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Privatization in Hungary===\nIn January 1990, the State Privatization Agency (SPA, ''\u00c1llami Vagyon\u00fcgyn\u00f6ks\u00e9g'') was established to manage the first steps of [[privatization]].

The [[List of heads of state of Hungary|President]] holds the title of [[commander-in-chief]] of the nation's armed forces. The [[Minister of Defence (Hungary)|Ministry of Defence]] jointly with [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Hungary|Chief of staff]] administers the armed forces, including the [[Hungarian Ground Force]] and the [[Hungarian Air Force]].  Since 2007, the Hungarian Armed Forces is under a unified command structure. The Ministry of Defence maintains the political and civil control over the army. A subordinate Joint Forces Command is coordinating and commanding the HDF corps. In 2016, the armed forces had 31.080 personnel on active duty, the operative reserve brought the total number of troops to fifty thousand. In 2017, military spending will be $1.21 billion, about 0.94% of the country's GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%. In 2012, the government adopted a resolution in which it pledged to increase defence spending to 1.4% of GDP by 2022.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n[[Military service]] is voluntary, though [[conscription]] may occur in wartime. In a significant move for modernization, Hungary decided in 2001 to buy 14 [[JAS 39 Gripen]] fighter aircraft for about 800 million EUR. Hungarian National Cyber Security Center is re-organized in 2016 in order to become more efficient through [[cyber security]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/national-liaison-office/meetings/june-2016/revised-hungarian-it-security-policy|title=Revised Hungarian IT Security Policy|publisher=National Cyber Security Center|accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the Hungarian military has about 700 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including 100 HDF troops in the [[NATO]]-led [[ISAF]] force in [[Afghanistan]], 210 Hungarian soldiers in [[Kosovo]] under command of [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]], and 160 troops in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Hungary sent a 300 strong, logistics unit to Iraq in order to help the US occupation with armed transport convoys, though public opinion opposed the country's participation in the war. One soldier was [[killed in action]] because of a roadside bomb in Iraq.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th century, [[Hungarian Hussars]] rose to international fame and served as a model for light cavalry in many European countries. In 1848\u201349 HDF achieved incredible successes against better-trained and equipped Austrian forces, despite the obvious advantage in numbers on the Austrian side. The 1848\u201349 Winter Campaign of [[J\u00f3zef Bem]] and the Spring Campaign of [[Art\u00far G\u00f6rgey]] are to this day taught at prestigious military schools around the globe, including at [[West Point Academy]] in the United States. In 1872, the [[Ludovica Military Academy]] officially began training cadets. By 1873 HDF already had over 2,800 officers and 158,000 men organized into eighty-six battalions and fifty-eight squadrons. During World War I out of the eight million men mobilized by [[Austro Hungarian Empire]], over one million died. During the 1930s and early 1940s, Hungary was preoccupied with the regaining the vast territories and huge amount of population lost in the [[Trianon peace treaty]] at Versailles in 1920.

Not until the introduction of well-regulated, plate-armored knight heavy cavalry could German emperors stop the Hungarian armies.\n\nDuring the \u00c1rp\u00e1ds the light cavalry based army was transformed slowly into a western-style one. The light cavalry lost its privileged position, replaced by a feudal army formed mainly from heavy cavalry.\n\nThe Hungarian field armies were drawn up into an articulated formation (as it happened in [[Battle of Przemy\u015bl (1099)|Battle of Przemy\u015bl]] (1099), [[Battle of the Fischa|Battle at Leitha]] (1146), [[Battle on the Marchfeld|Battle of Morvamez\u0151]] (1278), (1349), in three main [[battle (formation)]] (1146, 1278, 1349). According to the contemporary sources and later speculations, the first line was formed by light cavalry archers ([[Battle of Oslava]] (1116, 1146, 1260, 1278). Usually, they started the battle followed by a planned retreat (1116, 1146), [[Battle of Kressenbrunn]] (1260). The major decisive battles of the Hungarian army were placed in the second or third lines consisted mainly of the most valuable parts of the army \u2013 in general heavy cavalry (1146, 1278, 1349).\n\nThe commanders of the [[Hungarian Kingdom]]'s army used different tactics, based on a recognition of their own and the enemies' ([[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Uzes]], [[Cumans]], [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], [[Byzantine Empire]]) abilities and deficiencies.\n\nThe Hungarian knight army had its golden age under King [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]], who himself was a famed warrior and conducted successful campaigns in [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] due to family matters (his younger brother married [[Joanna I of Naples|Joanna I, Queen of Naples]] who murdered him later.) King [[Matthias Corvinus]] maintained very modern mercenary-based royal troops, called the ''[[Black Army of Hungary|Black Army]]''. King Matthias favoured ancient artillery (catapults) as opposed to cannons, which were the favourite of his father, [[Johannes Hunyadi]], former [[Regent of Hungary]].\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] invasion of Central Europe (between late 14th century and circa 1700) Hungarian soldiers protected fortresses and launched light cavalry attacks against the Turks (see [[Hungarian Hussar]]s). The northern fortress of [[Eger]] was famously defended in the autumn of 1552 during the 39-day [[Siege of Eger (1552)|Siege of Eger]] against the combined force of two Ottoman armies numbering circa 120,000 men and 16 ultra-heavy siege guns. The victory was very important, because two much stronger forts of [[Szolnok Castle#Ottoman siege of 1552|Szolnok]] and [[Siege of Temesv\u00e1r (1552)|Temesv\u00e1r]] had fallen quickly during the summer. Public opinion{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} attributed Eger's success to the all-Hungarian garrison, as the above two forts have fallen due to treason by the foreign mercenaries manning them. In 1596, [[Siege of Eger (1596)|Eger fell to the Ottomans]] for the same reason.\n\nIn the 1566 [[Battle of Szigetv\u00e1r]], [[Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski|Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi]] defended [[Szigetv\u00e1r]] for 30 days against the largest Ottoman army ever seen up to that day{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, and died leading his remaining few soldiers on a final suicide charge to become one of the best known national heroes. His great-grandson, [[Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi]], poet and general became one of the better-known strategists of the 1660s. In 1686, the capital city [[Buda]] [[Battle of Buda (1686)|was freed from the Ottomans]] by an allied Christian army composed of Austrian, Hungarian, and Western European troops, each roughly one-third of the army.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The [[Habsburg]] then annexed Hungary.\n\n===Habsburg Hungarian military=== <!-- [[Hungarian Revolutionary Army]] links here -->\n{{main|Royal Hungarian Landwehr}}\n{{see also|Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)}}\n\n[[Image:Than tapiobicskei utk\u00f6zet2 1849 aprilis 4.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Hungarian hussars in battle during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]].]]\n\nUnder [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg rule]], [[Hungarian Hussars]] rose to international fame and served as a model for light cavalry in many European countries. During the 18th and 19th centuries hundreds of thousands of forcibly enrolled Hungarian males served 12 years or more each as line infantry in the Austrian Imperial Army.\n\nTwo independence wars interrupted this era, that of Prince [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] [[R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War of Independence|between 1703 and 1711]] and that of [[Lajos Kossuth]] in 1848&ndash;1849. A July 11, 1848 act of parliament in Budapest called for the formation of an army, the ''Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g'', of 200,000 which would use the [[Magyar language]] of command. It was to be formed around already extant imperial units, twenty battalions of infantry, ten hussar regiments, and two regiments of [[Sz\u00e9kely]] from the [[Transylvanian Military Frontier]]. They were further joined by eight companies of two Italian regiments stationed in Hungary and parts of the Fifth Bohemian Artillery Regiment.<ref>Rothenburg, G. ''The Army of Francis Joseph''. West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 1976. p 29.{{anchor|CITEREFRothenburg1976}}</ref>\n\nIn 1848&ndash;1849 the Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g (mostly made up of enthusiastic patriots with no prior military training) achieved incredible successes against better-trained and -equipped Austrian forces, despite the obvious advantage in numbers on the Austrian side. The Winter Campaign of [[J\u00f3zef Bem]] and the Spring Campaign of [[Art\u00far G\u00f6rgey]] are to this day taught at prestigious military schools around the globe, including at [[West Point Academy]] in the United States. Having suffered initial setbacks, including the loss of [[Pest-Buda]], the Honv\u00e9d took advantage of the Austrians' lack of initiative and re-formed around the [[Debrecen]]-based Kossuth government.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=32-33}}  The Hungarians advanced again and by the end of spring 1849, Hungary was basically cleared of foreign forces, and would have achieved independence, were it not for the Russian intervention.  At the request of the [[Austrian emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]],{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=35}} the Russians invaded with a force of 190,000 soldiers - against the Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g's 135,000 - and decisively defeated Bem's Second Army in Transylvania, opening the path into the heart of Hungary. This way the Austrian-Russian coalition outnumbered Hungarian forces 3:1, which led to Hungary's [[surrender at Vil\u00e1gos]] on 13 August 1849. [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]], the great Hungarian poet, went [[missing in action]] in the [[Battle of Segesv\u00e1r]], against invading Russian forces.\n\nIn April 1867, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was established.  Franz Josef, the head of the ancient [[Habsburg]] dynasty, was recognized as both [[Austrian Empire|Emperor of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary]]. Nevertheless, the issue of what form the Hungarian military would take remained a matter of serious contention between Hungarian patriots and Austrian leaders.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=75-76}} As the impasse threatened the political union, Emperor Franz Josef ordered a council of generals in November of the same year. Ultimately, the leaders resolved on the following solution: in addition to the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|joint (k.u.k.) army]], Hungary would have its own defence force, whose members would swear their oath to the King of Hungary (who was also Emperor of Austria) and the national constitution, use the Hungarian language of command, and display their own flags and insignia. (Austria would also form its own parallel national defence force, the ''[[Imperial-Royal Landwehr|Landwehr]]''.){{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=77}} As a result of these negotiations, on 5 December 1868, the [[Royal Hungarian Landwehr]] (''Magyar Kiralyi Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g'', or Defence Force) was established.\n\nThe Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g was usually treated generously by the [[Diet of Hungary|Diet]] in Budapest.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=78}} By 1873 it already had over 2,800 officers and 158,000 men organized into eighty-six battalions and fifty-eight squadrons. In 1872, the [[Ludovica Military Academy|Ludovika Academy]] officially began training cadets (and later staff officers). Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g units engaged in manoeuvres and were organized into seven divisions in seven military districts. While artillery was not allowed, the force did form batteries of [[Gatling gun]]s in the 1870s.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=85}}\n\nIn the midst of trouble between the imperial government and the parliament in 1906, the Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g was further expanded and finally received its own artillery units. In this form, the force approached the coming world war in most respects as a truly \"national\" Hungarian army.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=136}}\n\n====World War I====\n{{Main|Royal Hungarian Landwehr}}\n{{see also|Hungary in World War I}}\nHungarian soldiers \"fought with distinction\" on every front contested by Austria-Hungary in the [[First World War]].{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=136}} Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g units (along with the [[Austrian Landwehr]]) were considered fit for front line combat service and equal to those of the joint k.u.k. army.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=173}} They saw combat especially on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] and at the [[Battles of the Isonzo]] on the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Front]]. Out of the eight million men mobilized by Austria-Hungary, over one million died. Hungarians as a national group were second only to German Austrians in their share of this burden, experiencing twenty-eight war deaths for every thousand persons.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=218}}\n\nAfter the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire in late 1918, the [[Hungarian Red Army|Red Army]] of the Hungarian communist state ([[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]) conducted successful campaigns to protect the country's borders.  However, in the [[Hungarian\u2013Romanian War of 1919]] Hungary came under occupation by the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]n, [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes|Serbia]]n, [[United States|American]], and [[French Third Republic|French]] troops, as after four years of extensive fighting, the country lacked both the necessary manpower and equipment to fend off foreign invaders.\n\nIn accordance with the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Treaty of Bucharest]], upon leaving, the [[Romanian army]] took substantial compensation for reparations. This included agricultural goods and industrial machinery as well as raw materials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epa.niif.hu/00700/00775/00014/109-113.html|title=Magyar Tudomny 2000. janur|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref> The [[Trianon peace treaty|Trianon Treaty]] limited the [[Royal Hungarian Army|Hungarian National Army]] to 35,000 men and forbad conscription.

On 1 January 1922, the National Army was once again redesignated the Royal Hungarian Army.\n\nDuring the 1930s and early 1940s, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]] was preoccupied with the regaining the vast territories and huge amount of population lost in the [[Trianon peace treaty]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in 1920.  This required strong armed forces to defeat the [[Little Entente|neighbouring states]] and this was something Hungary could not afford.  Instead, the Hungarian [[Regent of Hungary|Regent]], Admiral Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, made an alliance with German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Third Reich]].  In exchange for this alliance and via the [[First Vienna Award|First]] and [[Second Vienna Award]]s, Hungary received back parts of its lost territories from [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]].  Hungary was to pay dearly during and after [[World War II]] for these temporary gains.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}\n\nOn 5 March 1938, Prime Minister [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Dar\u00e1nyi]] announced a rearmament program (the so-called ''[[Gy\u0151r]] Programme'', named after the city where it was announced to the public).  Starting 1 October, the armed forces established a five-year expansion plan with Huba I-III revised orders of battle.  [[Conscription]] was introduced on a national basis in 1939.  The peacetime strength of the [[Royal Hungarian Army]] grew to 80,000 men organized into seven corps commands.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn March 1939, Hungary launched an invasion of the newly formed [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak Republic]].  Both the Royal Hungarian Army and the [[Royal Hungarian Air Force]] fought in the brief [[Slovak-Hungarian War]].  This invasion was launched to reclaim a part of the Slovakian territory lost after World War I.\n\nOn 1 March 1940, Hungary organized its [[Hungarian Ground Forces|ground forces]] into three field armies.  The Royal Hungarian Army fielded the [[First Army (Hungary)|Hungarian First Army]], the [[Hungarian Second Army]], and the [[Hungarian Third Army]].  With the exception of the independent \"Fast Moving Army Corps\" (''[[Gyorshadtest]]''), all three Hungarian field armies were initially relegated to defensive and occupation duties within the regained Hungarian territories.\n\n====World War II====\n\n{{Main|Royal Hungarian Army}}\n{{see also|Hungary in World War II}}\n\nIn November 1940, Hungary signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] and became a member of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] with [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]].\n\nIn April 1941, in order to regain territory, Hungary joined the Germans in the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]].\n\nAfter the controversial ''[[Kassa attack]]'', elements of the Royal Hungarian Army joined the German invasion of the [[Soviet Union]], [[Operation Barbarossa]].  In the late summer of 1941, the Hungarian \"Rapid Corps\" (''[[Gyorshadtest]]''), alongside [[Wehrmacht|German]] and Romanian army groups, scored a huge success against the Soviets at the [[Battle of Uman]].  A little more than a year later and contrasting sharply with the success at Uman, was the near total devastation of the [[Hungarian Second Army]] on banks of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] in December 1942 during the [[Battle for Stalingrad]].\n\nDuring 1943, the [[Hungarian Second Army]] was re-built. In late 1944, as part of ''Panzerarmee Fretter-Pico'', it participated in the destruction of a Soviet mechanized group at the [[Battle of Debrecen]].  But this proved to be a [[Pyrrhic victory]].  Unable to re-build again, the [[Hungarian Second Army]] was disbanded towards the end of 1944.\n\nTo keep Hungary as an ally, the Germans launched [[Operation Margarethe]] and occupied Hungary in March 1944.  However, during the [[Warsaw Uprising]], Hungarian troops refused to participate.<ref name=\"Mollo, Andrew 1981\">Page 208, Mollo, Andrew, ''The Armed Forces of World War II'', Crown, 1981, New York, {{ISBN|0-517-54478-4}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Warsaw Uprising Hungarians.JPG|thumb|upright|Graves of a [[Royal Hungarian Army]] captain and 6 of his men who fell, fighting on the Polish side in [[Warsaw uprising]] 1944]]\nOn 15 October 1944, the Germans launched [[Operation Panzerfaust]] and forced Horthy to abdicate.  Pro-Nazi [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]] was made [[Prime Minister of Hungary|Prime Minister]] by the Germans.\n\nOn 28 December 1944, a [[provisional government]] under the control of the [[Soviet Union]] was formed in liberated [[Debrecen]] with [[B\u00e9la Mikl\u00f3s]] as its [[Prime Minister]].  Mikl\u00f3s was the commander of the [[Hungarian First Army]], but most of the First Army sided with the Germans and most of what remained of it was destroyed about 200 kilometres north of Budapest between 1 January and 16 February.  The pro-[[Communist]] government formed by Mikl\u00f3s competed with the pro-Nazi [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|government of Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]].  The Germans, Sz\u00e1lasi, and pro-German Hungarian forces loyal to Sz\u00e1lasi fought on.  On 20 January 1945, representatives of the provisional government of [[B\u00e9la Mikl\u00f3s]] signed an armistice in [[Moscow]].  But forces loyal to Sz\u00e1lasi still continued to fight on.\n\nThe [[Red Army]], with assistance from Romanian army units, completed the encirclement of Budapest on 29 December 1944 and the [[Battle of Budapest|Siege of Budapest]] began.  On 2 February 1945, the strength of the Royal Hungarian Army was 214,465 men, but about 50,000 of these had been formed into [[Labour service (Hungary)|unarmed labor battalions]].<ref name=\"Mollo, Andrew 1981\"/>  The siege of Budapest ended with the surrender of the city on 13 February.  But, while the German forces in Hungary were generally in a state of defeat, the Germans had one more surprise for the Soviets.\n\nIn early March 1945, the Germans launched [[Operation Fr\u00fchlingserwachen|the Lake Balaton Offensive]] with support from the Hungarians.  This offensive was almost over before it began.  By 19 March 1945, Soviet troops had recaptured all the territory lost during a 13-day German offensive.<ref>''Page 182, The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan'', Hans Dollinger, Library of Congress Catalogue Card Number 67-27047</ref>\n\nAfter the failed offensive, the Germans in Hungary were defeated.  Most of what remained of the [[Hungarian Third Army]] was destroyed about 50 kilometres west of Budapest between 16 March and 25 March 1945.  Officially, Soviet operations in Hungary ended on 4 April 1945 when the last German troops were expelled.\n\nSome pro-fascist Hungarians like Sz\u00e1lasi retreated with the Germans into Austria and Czechoslovakia.  During the very last phase of the war, [[Fascist]] Hungarian forces fought in [[Vienna Offensive|Vienna]], [[Battle of Breslau (1945)|Breslau]], [[Kostrzyn nad Odr\u0105|K\u00fcstrin]], and along the [[Oder River]].<ref name=\"Mollo, Andrew 1981\"/>\n[[Image:Hungarian military police summer uniform (enlisted, 1965-2005).jpg|thumb|right|80px|Uniform of the Hungarian People's Army (''Magyar N\u00e9phadsereg''): Hungarian military police summer uniform (enlisted, private, 1965-2005)]]\nOn 7 May 1945, [[General]] [[Alfred Jodl]], the German [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Chief of Staff]], signed the document of unconditional surrender for all German forces.  Jodl signed this document during a ceremony in [[France]].  On 8 May, in accordance with the wishes of the [[Soviet Union]], the ceremony was repeated in Germany by [[Field Marshal]] [[Wilhelm Keitel]].  On 11 June, the Allies agreed to make 9 May 1945 the official \"Victory in Europe\" day.<ref>''Page 298, The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan'', Hans Dollinger, Library of Congress Catalogue Card Number 67-27047</ref>  Sz\u00e1lasi and many other pro-fascist Hungarians were captured and ultimately returned to Hungary's provisional government for trial.\n\n===Warsaw Pact===\n{{Main|Hungarian People's Army}}\n{{see also|Hungarian Republic (1946\u201349)|Hungarian People's Republic}}\n\nDuring the Socialist and the [[Warsaw Pact]] era (1947&ndash;1989), the entire 200,000 strong [[Southern Group of Forces]] was garrisoned in Hungary, complete with artillery, tank regiments, air force and missile troops (with nuclear weapons). It was, by all means, a very capable force that made little contact with the local population. Between 1949 and 1955 there was also a huge effort to build a big Hungarian army. All procedures, disciplines, and equipment were exact copies of the [[Soviet Armed Forces|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] in methods and material, but the huge costs collapsed the economy by 1956.\n\nAfter the autumn [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|1956 revolution]] was crushed in [[Budapest]], the Soviets took away most of the Hungarian People's Army's equipment, including dismantling the entire Hungarian Air Force, because a sizable percentage of the Army fought alongside the Hungarian revolutionaries. Three years later in 1959, the Soviets began helping rebuild the Hungarian People's Army and resupplying them with new arms and equipment as well as rebuilding the Hungarian Air Force. Satisfied that Hungary was stable and firmly committed once again to the Warsaw Pact, the Soviets offered the Hungarians a choice of withdrawal for all Soviet troops in the country. The new Hungarian leader, [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], asked for all the 200,000 Soviet troops to stay, because it allowed the [[socialist]] [[Hungarian People's Republic]] to neglect its own draft-based armed forces, quickly leading to deterioration of the military. Large sums of money were saved that way and spent on feel-good socialist measures for the population, thus Hungary could become \"[[the happiest barrack]]\" in the [[Soviet Bloc]]. Limited modernization, through, would happen in from the mid 1970s onward to replace older stocks of military equipment with newer ones to enable the HPA, in a small way, to honor its Warsaw Pact commitments.\n\nThe HPA was divided into the Ground and Air Forces. The Ground Forces were organized into:\n* 5th Hungarian Army at [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]]\n** 7th Motor Rifle Division at [[Kiskunf\u00e9legyh\u00e1za]]\n** 8th Motor Rifle Division at [[Zalaegerszeg]]\n** 9th Motor Rifle Division at [[Kaposv\u00e1r]]\n** 11th Tank Division at [[Tata, Hungary|Tata]]\n* 3rd Army Corps at [[Cegl\u00e9d]]\n** 4th Motor Rifle Division at [[Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s]]\n** 15th Motor Rifle Division at [[Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za]]\n\nAir Forces Headquarters at [[Veszpr\u00e9m]]\n* 11th Air-defense Artillery Brigade at [[Budapest]], after 1977 [[\u00c9rd]]\n*1st Air Defense Division at [[Veszpr\u00e9m]]\n** 47th Fighter Regiment at [[P\u00e1pa]]\n** 31st Fighter Regiment at [[Tasz\u00e1r]]\n** 104th Air-defense Artillery Regiment [[Nagytarcsa]] after [[Szabadsz\u00e1ll\u00e1s]]\n* 2nd Air Defense Division at [[Miskolc]]\n** 59th Fighter Regiment at [[Szolnok]]\n** 105th Air-defense Artillery Regiment at [[Miskolc]]\n\nTraining for conscripts was poor and most of those drafted were actually used as a free labour force (esp. railway track construction and agricultural work) after just a few weeks of basic rifle training. Popular opinion grew very negative towards the Hungarian People's Army and most young men tried to avoid the draft with bogus medical excuses.\n\n=== Modern Times ===\nIn 1997, Hungary spent about 123 billion HUF ($560 million) on defence. Hungary became a member of [[NATO]] on 12 March 1999. Hungary provided airbases and support for [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO's air campaign]] against [[Republic of Serbia (1992\u20132006)|Serbia]] and has provided military units to serve in [[Kosovo]] as part of the NATO-led [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] operation. Hungary has sent a 300 strong logistics unit to [[Iraq]] in order to help the US occupation with armed transport convoys, though public opinion opposed the country's participation in the [[Iraq War|war]]. One soldier was [[killed in action]] due to a roadside bomb in Iraq. The parliament refused to extend the one year mandate of the logistics unit and all troops have returned from Iraq as of mid-January 2005. Hungarian troops are still in [[Afghanistan]] as of early 2005 to assist in peace-keeping and de-[[taliban]]ization. Hungary will most probably replace its old UAZ 4x4 vehicles with the modern [[Iveco LMV]] types. Hungarian forces deploy the [[Gepard anti-materiel rifle|Gep\u00e1rd anti-materiel rifle]], which is a heavy 12.7&nbsp;mm portable gun. This equipment is also in use by the Turkish and Croatian armed forces, among other armies.\n\nNew transport helicopter purchases are on the list before. Most probably this will happen before 2015.\n\nIn a significant move for modernization, Hungary decided in 2001 to lease 14 [[JAS 39 Gripen]] fighter aircraft (the contract includes 2 dual-seater airplanes and 12 single-seaters as well as ground maintenance facilities, a simulator, and training for pilots and ground crews) for 210 billion HUF (about 800 million EUR). Five Gripens (3 single-seaters and 2 two-seaters) arrived in [[Kecskem\u00e9t]] on 21 March 2006, expected to be transferred to the Hungarian Air Force on March 30.\n10 or 14 more aircraft of this type might follow up in the coming years.\n\nIn early 2015 Hungary and Sweden extended the lease-program for another 10 years with a total of 32.000 flight-hours (95% increase) for only 45% increase in cost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://defense-update.com/20120201_sweden-hungary-extend-gripen-lease.html|title=Sweden, Hungary Extend Gripen Lease - Defense Update:|website=defense-update.com}}</ref>\n\n== Current international missions ==\n* HDF [[EUFOR]] Althea Contingent, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n* HDF [[Mil Mi-17|Mi-17]] Air Advisory Team [[Afghanistan]]\n* HDF KFOR Contingent [[Kosovo]]\n* HDF Military Advisory Team, [[Afghanistan]]\n* HDF Support Platoon, [[Afghanistan]]\n* HDF Special Operation Team [[Afghanistan]] - objectives: Recon and Support (The Hungarian Government hands it in top secret)\n* HDF MFO Contingent, [[Sinai]]\n* HDF UNFICYP Contingent, [[Cyprus]] and specific other missions.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Military of Hungary}}\n* [[Military history of Hungary]]\n* [[Military ranks of Hungary]]\n*[[Defence Force (disambiguation)|Defence Force]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Matei, Florina Cristiana. \"The impact of NATO membership on military effectiveness: Hungary\" In The Routledge handbook of civil-military relations, pp.&nbsp;219\u2013231.

Hungary joined the [[Partnership for Peace]] program in 1994 and has actively supported the [[IFOR]] and [[SFOR]] missions in Bosnia. Hungary since 1989 has also improved its often frosty neighborly relations by signing basic treaties with [[Ukraine]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Romania]]. These renounce all outstanding territorial claims and lay the foundation for constructive relations. However, the issue of [[Hungarian diaspora|ethnic Hungarian minority]] rights in Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine periodically causes bilateral tensions to flare up. Hungary since 1989 has signed all of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] documents, and served as the OSCE's Chairman-in-Office in 1997. Hungary's record of implementing [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|CSCE]] ''Helsinki Final Act'' provisions, including those on reunification of divided families, remains among the best in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nExcept for the short-lived [[Neutral country|neutrality]] declared by the [[anti-Soviet]] leader [[Imre Nagy]] in November 1956, [[Hungary]]'s foreign policy generally followed the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] lead from 1947 to 1989. During the [[Communism|Communist]] period, Hungary maintained treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with the [[Soviet Union]], [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[German Democratic Republic]], [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]], and [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. It was one of the founding members of the Soviet-led [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[Comecon]], and it was the first central European country to withdraw from those organizations, now defunct. After 1989, Hungary oriented more towards the West, joined [[NATO]] in 1999 and the [[European Union]] in 2004. \n[[File:Necasmeeting.jpg|thumb|right|Meeting of [[Visegr\u00e1d Group]] leaders, plus Germany and France in 2013]]\n[[File:BIMUN 2012 opening 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[United Nations]] conference in the assembly hall of [[House of Magnates]] in the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Hungarian Parliament]]]]\n\n==Overview==\nAs with any country, Hungarian security attitudes are shaped largely by history and geography. For Hungary, this is a history of more than 400 years of domination by great powers\u2014the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the [[Habsburg]] dynasty, the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] during [[World War II]], and the Soviets during the [[Cold War]]\u2014and a geography of regional instability and separation from Hungarian minorities living in neighboring countries. Hungary's foreign policy priorities, largely consistent since 1990, represent a direct response to these factors. Since 1990, Hungary's top foreign policy goal has been achieving integration into Western economic and security organizations. Hungary joined the [[Partnership for Peace]] program in 1994 and has actively supported the [[IFOR]] and [[SFOR]] missions in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. The [[Gyula Horn|Horn]] government achieved Hungary's most important foreign policy successes of the post-communist era by securing invitations to join both [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]] in 1997. Hungary became a member of NATO in 1999, and a member of the [[European Union|EU]] in 2004.\n\nHungary also has improved its often frosty neighborly relations by signing basic treaties with [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Ukraine]]. These renounce all outstanding territorial claims and lay the foundation for constructive relations. However, the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights in Slovakia and Romania periodically causes bilateral tensions to flare up. Hungary was a signatory to the [[Helsinki Final Act]] in 1975, has signed all of the CSCE/[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] follow-on documents since 1989, and served as the OSCE's Chairman-in-Office in 1997. Hungary's record of implementing CSCE '''Helsinki Final Act''' provisions, including those on reunification of divided families, remains among the best in eastern Europe. Hungary has been a member of the [[United Nations]] since December 1955.\n\n;The [[Gab\u010d\u00edkovo - Nagymaros Dams]] project\nThis involves Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and .was agreed on September 16, 1977 (\"Budapest Treaty\"). The treaty envisioned a [[cross-border]] barrage system between the towns Gab\u010d\u00edkovo, [[Czechoslovakia]] and Nagymaros, Hungary. After intensive campaign the project became widely hated as a symbol of the old [[communist]] regime. In 1989 [[Hungary|Hungarian]] government decided to suspend it. In its sentence from September 1997, the [[International Court of Justice]] stated that both sides breached their obligation and that the 1977 Budapest Treaty is still valid. In 1998 the Slovak government turned to the International Court, demanding the Nagymaros part to be built. The international dispute is still not solved as of 2008.\n\nOn March 19, 2008 Hungary recognized [[Kosovo]] as an independent country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Croatia and Hungary recognize Kosovo|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/19/europe/kosovo.php|work=[[The Associated Press]]|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=2008-03-19|accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref>\n\n'''Disputes&nbsp;\u2013 international:'''\nOngoing [[Gab\u010d\u00edkovo - Nagymaros Dams]] dispute with [[Slovakia]]\n\n'''Illicit drugs:'''\nMajor trans-shipment point for [[Southwest Asia]]n [[heroin]] and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and transit point for [[South America]]n [[cocaine]] destined for [[Western Europe]]; limited producer of precursor [[chemical compound|chemicals]], particularly for [[amphetamine]]s and [[methamphetamine]]s\n\n'''Refugee protection:'''\nThe [[hungarian border barrier]] was built in 2015, and Hungary was criticized by other European countries for using tear gas and water cannons on [[refugees of the Syrian Civil War]] as they were \u2013 illegally \u2013 trying to pass the country.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/16/first-refugees-head-for-croatia-after-hungarys-border-crackdown-live-updates Hungary border crackdown], The Guardian 16 September 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hungarian-police-spray-tear-gas-water-cannons-at-migrants/ Hungarian police spary tear gas water cannons at migrants], CBS news 16 September 2015</ref>\n\n==Hungary and Central Asia==\nA number of Hungarian anthropologists and linguists have long had an interest in the [[Turkic peoples]], fueled by the eastern origin of the Hungarians' ancestors.<ref>{{cite book\n|first=Andr\u00e1s |last=R\u00f3na-Tas\n|publisher=Central European University Press |year=1999\n|isbn=963-9116-48-3\n|title=Hungarians and Europe in the early Middle Ages: an introduction to early Hungarian history\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=I-RTt0Q6AcYC\n|pages=409\u2013410\n}}</ref> The Hungarian ethnomusicologist [[Bence Szabolcsi]] explained this motivation as follows: \"Hungarians are the outermost branch leaning this way from age-old tree of the great Asian musical culture rooted in the souls of a variety of peoples living from China through Central Asia to the Black Sea\".<ref>ipos, J\u00e1nos [http://www.zti.hu/sipos/book%20kazak.htm Kazakh Folksongs from the Two Ends of the Steppe]</ref>\n\n==Relations by region and country==\n\n===Africa===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n!width=\"15%\"| Country\n!width=\"12%\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Algeria }}||<!--Start date-->||\n\n* Algeria has an embassy in [[Budapest]].\n* Hungary has an embassy in [[Algiers]].\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Cape Verde}}||<!--Start date--> \n|\nHungary is represented in Cape-Verde by its embassy in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]<ref>[http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-foreign-affairs-and-trade/missions ]</ref><ref>[https://lisszabon.mfa.gov.hu/eng]</ref> and an honorary consulate in [[Praia]].<ref name=\"kormany.hu\">[http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-foreign-affairs-and-trade/missions]</ref>\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Egypt }}||<!--Start date-->||\n\n* Egypt has an embassy in Budapest.\n* Hungary has an embassy in [[Cairo]].\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Guinea-Bissau}}||<!--Start date--> \n|\nHungary is represented in Guinea-Bissau by its embassy in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"kormany.hu\"/>\n\n|--valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Morocco }}||<!--Start date-->||\n* Hungary has an embassy in Morocco.

He is best remembered for his historical novels, especially for his internationally known best-seller ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]'' (1896).\n\nBorn into an impoverished [[szlachta|Polish noble family]] in Russian-ruled [[Congress Poland]], in the late 1860s he began publishing journalistic and literary pieces. In the late 1870s he traveled to the United States, sending back travel essays that won him popularity with Polish readers. In the 1880s he began serializing novels that further increased his popularity.  He soon became one of the most popular Polish writers of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, and numerous translations gained him international renown, culminating in his receipt of the 1905 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] for his \"outstanding merits as an epic writer.\"\n\nMany of his novels remain in print. In Poland he is best known for his \"[[The Trilogy|Trilogy]]\" of historical novels \u2013 ''[[With Fire and Sword]]'', ''[[The Deluge (novel)|The Deluge]]'', and ''[[Fire in the Steppe|Sir Michael]]'' \u2013 set in the 17th-century [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; internationally he is best known for ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]'', set in [[Nero]]'s [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. ''The Trilogy'' and ''Quo Vadis'' have been filmed, the latter several times, with Hollywood's [[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|1951 version]] receiving the most international recognition.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life===\nSienkiewicz was born on 5 May 1846 in [[Wola Okrzejska]], now a village in the central part of eastern Polish region of [[Lublin Voivodeship|Lubelskie]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]].<ref name=\"psb203\"/><ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-163\"/> His family were impoverished Polish nobles, on his father's side deriving from [[Lipka Tatars|Tatars]] who had settled in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].<ref name=\"psb203\"/><ref name=\"Lockert1919\"/><ref name=\"hierarchicznej\"/><ref name=\"ciechanowicz\"/> His parents were J\u00f3zef Sienkiewicz (1813\u201396) and Stefania, ''n\u00e9e'' Cieciszowska (1820\u201373).<ref name=\"psb203\"/> He had five siblings: an older brother, Kazimierz (died during [[January Uprising]]), and four sisters, Aniela, Helena, Zofia and Maria.<ref name=\"psb203\"/> His family were entitled to use the Polish [[Oszyk coat of arms]].<ref name=\"Majchrowski1966\"/><ref name=\"Studencki1967\"/> Wola Okrzejska belonged to the writer's maternal grandmother, Felicjana Cieciszowska.<ref name=\"psb203\"/> His family moved several times, and young Henryk spent his childhood on family estates in [[Grabowce G\u00f3rne]], [[W\u0119\u017cyczyn]] and [[Burzec]].<ref name=\"psb203\"/> In September 1858 he began his education in [[Warsaw]], where the family would finally settle in 1861, having bought a tenement house (''[[Kamienica (architecture)|kamienica]]'') in eastern Warsaw's [[Praga]] district.<ref name=\"psb203\"/> He received relatively poor school grades except in the humanities, notably Polish language and history.<ref name=\"psb203\"/>\n[[Image:Pomnik Sienkiewicza w Okrzei.jpg|thumb|200px|Monument atop Sienkiewicz Mound at [[Okrzeja]].

it was, however, criticized as being a lesser version of his original [[The Trilogy|Trilogy]], and was never continued.<ref name=\"psb212\"/> Similarly, his contemporary novel ''Wiry'' Whirlpool (novel), 1910, which sought to criticize some of Sienkiewicz's political opponents, received a mostly polemical and politicized response.<ref name=\"psb213\"/> His 1910 novel for young people, ''W pustyni i w puszczy'' (In Desert and Wilderness), serialized in ''Kurier Warszawski'' (The Warsaw Courier), finishing in 1911, was much better received and became widely popular among children and young adults.<ref name=\"psb213\"/>\n\nAfter the outbreak of [[World War I]], Sienkiewicz was visited at Obl\u0119gorek by a [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] cavalry unit under [[Boles\u0142aw Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowski]].<ref name=\"psb213\"/> Soon after, he left for Switzerland.<ref name=\"psb213\"/> Together with [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]] and Erazm Piltz, he established an organization for Polish war relief.<ref name=\"psb213\"/> He also supported the work of the [[Red Cross]].<ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-164\"/> Otherwise, he eschewed politics, through shortly before his death he endorsed the [[Act of 5th November]] 1916, a declaration by Emperors Wilhelm II of Germany and Franz Joseph of Austria and king of Hungary, pledging the creation of a Kingdom of Poland envisioned as a puppet state allied with, and controlled by, the Central Powers.<ref name=\"psb213\"/>\n\n===Death===\n[[Image:Sienkiewicz grave.JPG|thumb|225px|Sienkiewicz's tomb, [[St. John's Cathedral, Warsaw]]]]\nSienkiewicz died on 15 November 1916, at the Grand Hotel du Lac in [[Vevey]], Switzerland, where he was buried on 22 November.<ref name=\"psb213\"/> The cause of death was [[ischemic heart disease]].<ref name=\"psb213\"/> His funeral was attended by representatives of both the [[Central Powers]] and the [[Entente Powers|Entente]], and an address by [[Pope Benedict XV]] was read.<ref name=\"psb213\"/><ref name=\"psb214\"/>\n\nIn 1924, after Poland had regained her independence, Sienkiewicz's remains were repatriated to [[Warsaw]], Poland, and placed in the crypt of [[St. John's Cathedral, Warsaw|St. John's Cathedral]].<ref name=\"psb214\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated\"/> During the coffin's transit, solemn memorial ceremonies were held in a number of cities.<ref name=\"psb214\"/> Thousands accompanied the coffin to its Warsaw resting place, and Poland's President [[Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski]] delivered a eulogy.<ref name=\"psb214\"/>\n\n==Works==\nSienkiewicz's early works (e.g., the 1872 ''Humoreski z teki Woroszy\u0142\u0142y'') show him a strong supporter of [[Positivism in Poland|Polish Positivism]], endorsing constructive, practical characters such as an engineer.<ref name=\"psb203\"/> Polish \"Positivism\" advocated economic and social modernization and deprecated armed [[irredentist]] struggle.<ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-164\"/> Unlike most other Polish Positivist writers, Sienkiewicz was a conservative.<ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-164\"/> His Little Trilogy (''Stary S\u0142uga'', 1875; ''Hania'', 1876; ''Selim Mirza'', 1877) shows his interest in [[history of Poland|Polish history]] and his literary maturity, including fine mastery of humor and drama.<ref name=\"psb204\"/><ref name=\"psb205\"/> His early works focused on three themes: the oppression and poverty of the peasants (\"Charcoal Sketches\", 1877); criticism of the partitioning powers (\"''Z pami\u0119tnika korepetytora''\", \"''[[Janko Muzykant]]''\" [\"Janko the Musician\"], 1879); and his voyage to the United States (\"''Za chlebem''\", \"For Bread\", 1880).<ref name=\"psb205\"/> His most common motif was the plight of the powerless: impoverished peasants, schoolchildren, emigrants.<ref name=\"psb205\"/>\n\nHis \"''Latarnik''\" (\"The [[Lighthouse keeper]]\", 1881) has been described as one of the best Polish short stories.<ref name=\"psb205\"/> His 1882 stories \"''Bartek Zwyci\u0119zca''\" (\"Bart the Conqueror\") and \"''Sachem''\" draw parallels between the tragic fates of their heroes and that of the occupied Polish nation.<ref name=\"psb206\"/>\n\nHis novel ''With Fire and Sword'' (1883\u201384) was enthusiastically received by readers (as were the next two volumes of [[The Trilogy]]), becoming an \"instant classic\", though critical reception was lukewarm.<ref name=\"psb206\"/><ref name=\"psb207\"/><ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-164\"/><ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-165\"/> The Trilogy is set in 17th-century Poland.<ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-164\"/> While critics generally praised its style, they noted that some historic facts are misrepresented or distorted.<ref name=\"psb206\"/><ref name=\"psb207\"/><ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-165\"/> The Trilogy merged elements of the [[epic (genre)|epic]] and the historical novel, infused with special features of Sienkiewicz's style.<ref name=\"psb207\"/> The Trilogy's patriotism worried the censors; Warsaw's Russian censor I. Jankul warned Sienkiewicz that he would not allow publication of any further works of his dealing with Polish history.<ref name=\"psb208\"/>\n[[File:POL COA Oszyk.svg|thumb|150px|Sienkiewicz's family coat-of-arms, [[Oszyk coat of arms|''Oszyk'']], was a variant of this [[\u0141ab\u0119d\u017a coat of arms|''\u0141ab\u0119d\u017a'']] (Swan) coat-of-arms.]]\nSienkiewicz's ''[[Without dogma]]'' (''Bez dogmatu'', 1889\u201390) was a notable artistic experiment, a self-analytical novel written as a fictitious diary.<ref name=\"psb208\"/> His works of the period are critical of [[Decadent movement|decadent]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] philosophies.<ref name=\"psb209\"/> He had expressed his opinions on naturalism and writing, generally, early on in \"''O naturali\u017amie w powie\u015bci''\" (\"Naturalism in the Novel\", 1881).<ref name=\"psb205\"/> A dozen years later, in 1893, he wrote that novels should strengthen and ennoble life, rather than undermining and debasing it.<ref name=\"psb209\"/> Later, in the early 1900s, he fell into mutual hostility with the [[Young Poland]] movement in Polish literature.<ref name=\"psb211\"/>\n\nThese views informed his novel [[Quo Vadis (novel)|''Quo Vadis'']] (1896).<ref name=\"psb209\"/> This story of [[early Christianity]] in Rome, with protagonists struggling against the [[Emperor Nero]]'s regime, draws parallels between repressed early Christians and contemporary Poles; and, due to its focus on Christianity, it became widely popular in the Christian [[Western culture|West]].<ref name=\"KurianIII2010\"/> The triumph of spiritual Christianity over materialist Rome was a critique of [[materialism]] and decadence, and also an allegory for the strength of the Polish spirit.<ref name=\"psb209\"/>\n\nHis ''[[The Teutonic Knights (novel)|Teutonic Knights]]'' returned to Poland's history.<ref name=\"psb209\"/> Describing the [[Battle of Grunwald]] (1410), a Polish-Lithuanian victory over the Germans in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian\u2013Teutonic War|Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War]], the book had a substantial contemporary political context in the ongoing [[Germanization]] efforts (''Kulturkampf'') in [[German partition|German Poland]].<ref name=\"psb209\"/><ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-165\"/> The book quickly became another Sienkiewicz bestseller in Poland, and was received by critics better than his Trilogy had been; it was also applauded by the Polish right-wing, anti-German [[National Democracy]] political movement, and became part of the Polish school curriculum after Poland regained independence in 1918.<ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-165\"/><ref name=\"ErsoyGorny2010-166\"/>\n\nIt is often incorrectly asserted that Sienkiewicz received his Nobel Prize for ''Quo Vadis''.<ref name=\"PHA\"/><ref name=\"wilczak\"/> While ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]'' is the novel that brought him international fame,<ref name=\"Sienkiewicz1998\"/> the Nobel Prize does not name any particular novel, instead citing \"his outstanding merits as an epic writer\".<ref name=\"The Nobel Prize in Literature 1905\"/>\n\nSienkiewicz often carried out substantial historic research for his novels, but he was selective in the findings that made it into the novels.  Thus, for example, he prioritized Polish military victories over defeats.<ref name=\"psb207\"/>\n\nSienkiewicz kept a diary, but it has been [[Lost works| lost]].<ref name=\"psb213\"/>\n\n==Recognition==\n[[File:Sienkiewicz in rome.JPG|thumb|175px|Statue of author of ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]'', near [[Galleria Borghese|Villa Borghese]] in Rome]]\nAbout the turn of the 20th century, Sienkiewicz was the most popular writer in Poland, and one of the most popular in Germany, France, Russia, and the English-speaking world.<ref name=\"psb209\"/> The Trilogy went through many translations; ''With Fire and Sword'' saw at least 26 in his lifetime.<ref name=\"psb209\"/>  ''Quo Vadis'' became extremely popular, in at least 40 different language translations, including English-language editions totaling a million copies.<ref name=\"psb209\"/> The American translator [[Jeremiah Curtin]] has been credited with helping popularize his works abroad.<ref name=\"KurianIII2010\">{{cite book|author1=George Thomas Kurian|author2=James D.

For example, about 4000 BC the Nile was dammed to improve agricultural productivity of previously barren lands. [[Mesopotamia]]n towns were protected from flooding with high earthen walls. [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|Aqueducts]] were built by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Romans]], while the [[history of China]] shows they built irrigation and flood control works. The ancient [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] used hydrology to build complex irrigation works in [[Sri Lanka]], also known for invention of the Valve Pit which allowed construction of large reservoirs, [[anicut]]s and canals which still function.\n\n[[Vitruvius|Marcus Vitruvius]], in the first century BC, described a philosophical theory of the hydrologic cycle, in which precipitation falling in the mountains infiltrated the Earth's surface and led to streams and springs in the lowlands.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} With adoption of a more scientific approach, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Bernard Palissy]] independently reached an accurate representation of the hydrologic cycle. It was not until the 17th century that hydrologic variables began to be quantified.\n\nPioneers of the modern science of hydrology include [[Pierre Perrault (scientist)|Pierre Perrault]], [[Edme Mariotte]] and [[Edmund Halley]]. By measuring rainfall, runoff, and drainage area, Perrault showed that rainfall was sufficient to account for flow of the Seine. Marriotte combined velocity and river cross-section measurements to obtain discharge, again in the Seine. Halley showed that the evaporation from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] was sufficient to account for the outflow of rivers flowing into the sea.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nAdvances in the 18th century included the Bernoulli [[piezometer]] and [[Bernoulli's equation]], by [[Daniel Bernoulli]], and the [[Pitot tube]], by [[Henri Pitot]]. The 19th century saw development in groundwater hydrology, including [[Darcy's law]], the Dupuit-Thiem well formula, and Hagen-[[Poiseuille]]'s capillary flow equation.\n\nRational analyses began to replace empiricism in the 20th century, while governmental agencies began their own hydrological research programs. Of particular importance were Leroy Sherman's [[unit hydrograph]], the infiltration theory of [[Robert E. Horton]], and C.V. Theis's aquifer test/equation describing well hydraulics.\n\nSince the 1950s, hydrology has been approached with a more theoretical basis than in the past, facilitated by advances in the physical understanding of hydrological processes and by the advent of computers and especially [[geographic information systems]] (GIS). (See also [[GIS and hydrology]])\n\n== Themes ==\n{{Main|Water cycle}}\nThe central theme of hydrology is that water circulates throughout the [[Earth]] through different pathways and at different rates. The most vivid image of this is in the evaporation of water from the ocean, which forms clouds. These clouds drift over the land and produce rain. The rainwater flows into lakes, rivers, or aquifers. The water in lakes, rivers, and aquifers then either evaporates back to the atmosphere or eventually flows back to the ocean, completing a cycle. Water changes its state of being several times throughout this cycle.\n\nThe areas of research within hydrology concern the movement of water between its various states, or within a given state, or simply quantifying the amounts in these states in a given region. Parts of hydrology concern developing methods for directly measuring these flows or amounts of water, while others concern modelling these processes either for scientific knowledge or for making prediction in practical applications.\n\n=== Groundwater ===\n[[File:Building a map of groundwater countours.gif|thumb|250px|right|Building a map of groundwater contours]]\nGround water is water beneath Earth's surface, often pumped for drinking water.<ref name=USGS /> Groundwater hydrology ([[hydrogeology]]) considers quantifying groundwater flow and solute transport.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Graf|first1=T.|last2=Simmons|first2=C. T.|title=Variable-density groundwater flow and solute transport in fractured rock: Applicability of the Tang et al. [1981] analytical solution|journal=Water Resources Research|date=February 2009|volume=45|issue=2|page=W02425|doi=10.1029/2008WR007278}}</ref> Problems in describing the saturated zone include the characterization of aquifers in terms of flow direction, groundwater pressure and, by inference, groundwater depth (see: [[aquifer test]]). Measurements here can be made using a [[piezometer]]. Aquifers are also described in terms of hydraulic conductivity, storativity and transmissivity. There are a number of geophysical methods<ref name=Vereecken /> for characterising aquifers. There are also problems in characterising the vadose zone (unsaturated zone).<ref name=Wilson />\n\n=== Infiltration ===\n{{Main|Infiltration (hydrology)}}\nInfiltration is the process by which water enters the soil. Some of the water is absorbed, and the rest [[Percolation|percolates]] down to the [[water table]]. The infiltration capacity, the maximum rate at which the soil can absorb water, depends on several factors. The layer that is already saturated provides a resistance that is proportional to its thickness, while that plus the depth of water above the soil provides the driving force ([[hydraulic head]]). Dry soil can allow rapid infiltration by [[capillary action]]; this force diminishes as the soil becomes wet. [[Compaction (geology)|Compaction]] reduces the porosity and the pore sizes. Surface cover increases capacity by retarding runoff, reducing compaction and other processes. Higher temperatures reduce [[viscosity]], increasing infiltration.<ref name=Reddy>{{cite book|last1=Reddy|first1=P. Jaya Rami|title=A textbook of hydrology|date=2007|publisher=Laxmi Publ.|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788170080992|edition=Reprint.}}</ref>{{rp|250\u2013275}}\n\n=== Soil moisture ===\n[[Soil moisture]] can be measured in various ways; by [[capacitance probe]], [[time domain reflectometer]] or [[Tensiometer (soil science)|Tensiometer]]. Other methods include solute sampling and geophysical methods.\n\n=== Surface water flow ===\nHydrology considers quantifying surface water flow and solute transport, although the treatment of flows in large rivers is sometimes considered as a distinct topic of hydraulics or hydrodynamics. Surface water flow can include flow both in recognizable river channels and otherwise. Methods for measuring flow once water has reached a river include the [[stream gauge]] (see: [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]]), and tracer techniques. Other topics include chemical transport as part of surface water, sediment transport and erosion.\n\nOne of the important areas of hydrology is the interchange between rivers and aquifers. Groundwater/surface water interactions in streams and aquifers can be complex and the direction of net water flux (into surface water or into the aquifer) may vary spatially along a stream channel and over time at any particular location, depending on the relationship between stream stage and groundwater levels.\n\n=== Precipitation and evaporation ===\nIn some considerations, hydrology is thought of as starting at the land-atmosphere boundary{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} and so it is important to have adequate knowledge of both precipitation and evaporation. Precipitation can be measured in various ways: [[disdrometer]] for precipitation characteristics at a fine time scale; [[radar]] for cloud properties, rain rate estimation, hail and snow detection; [[rain gauge]] for routine accurate measurements of rain and snowfall; [[satellite]] for rainy area identification, rain rate estimation, land-cover/land-use, and soil moisture, for example.\n\n[[Evaporation]] is an important part of the water cycle. It is partly affected by humidity, which can be measured by a [[sling psychrometer]]. It is also affected by the presence of snow, hail and ice and can relate to dew, mist and fog. Hydrology considers evaporation of various forms: from water surfaces; as transpiration\nfrom plant surfaces in natural and agronomic ecosystems. A direct measurement of evaporation can be obtained using Simon's [[evaporation pan]].\n\nDetailed studies of evaporation involve boundary layer considerations as well as momentum, heat flux and energy budgets.\n\n=== Remote sensing ===\n[[Remote sensing]] of hydrologic processes can provide information on locations where ''in situ'' sensors may be unavailable or sparse. It also enables observations over large spatial extents. Many of the variables constituting the terrestrial water balance, for example [[surface water]] storage, [[soil moisture]], [[precipitation]], [[evapotranspiration]], and [[snow]] and [[ice]], are measurable using remote sensing at various spatial-temporal resolutions and accuracies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tang|first1=Q.|last2=Gao|first2=H.|last3=Lu|first3=H.|last4=Lettenmaier|first4=D. P.|title=Remote sensing: hydrology|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|date=6 October 2009|volume=33|issue=4|pages=490\u2013509|doi=10.1177/0309133309346650}}</ref> Sources of remote sensing include land-based sensors, airborne sensors and [[Earth observation satellite|satellite sensors]] which can capture [[Passive microwave sensor|microwave]], [[near-infrared|thermal and near-infrared]] data or use [[lidar]], for example.\n\n=== Water quality ===\n{{Main|Water quality}}\n\nIn hydrology, studies of water quality concern organic and inorganic compounds, and both dissolved and sediment material. In addition, water quality is affected by the interaction of dissolved oxygen with organic material and various chemical transformations that may take place. Measurements of water quality may involve either in-situ methods, in which analyses take place on-site, often automatically, and laboratory-based analyses and may include [[Bacteriological water analysis|microbiological analysis]].\n\n=== Integrating measurement and modelling ===\n* Budget analyses\n* Parameter estimation\n* Scaling in time and space\n* [[Data assimilation]]\n* Quality control of data \u2013 see for example [[Double mass analysis]]\n\n=== Prediction ===\nObservations of hydrologic processes are used to make [[predictions]] of the future behaviour of hydrologic systems (water flow, water quality). One of the major current concerns in hydrologic research is \"Prediction in Ungauged Basins\" (PUB), i.e. in basins where no or only very few data exist.\n\n=== Statistical hydrology ===\nBy analyzing the statistical properties of hydrologic records, such as rainfall or river flow, hydrologists can estimate future hydrologic phenomena. When making assessments of how often relatively rare events will occur, analyses are made in terms of the [[return period]] of such events. Other quantities of interest include the average flow in a river, in a year or by season.\n\nThese estimates are important for [[engineers]] and economists so that proper [[Risk analysis (business)|risk analysis]] can be performed to influence investment decisions in future infrastructure and to determine the yield reliability characteristics of water supply systems. Statistical information is utilized to formulate operating rules for large dams forming part of systems which include agricultural, industrial and [[residential]] demands.\n\n=== Modeling ===\n{{main|Hydrological modelling}}\nHydrological models are simplified, conceptual representations of a part of the hydrologic cycle. They are primarily used for hydrological prediction and for understanding hydrological processes, within the general field of [[scientific modeling]]. Two major types of hydrological models can be distinguished:{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n* Models based on data. These models are [[Black box (systems)|black box]] systems, using mathematical and statistical concepts to link a certain input (for instance rainfall) to the model output (for instance [[Surface runoff|runoff]]). Commonly used techniques are [[Regression analysis|regression]], [[transfer function]]s, and [[system identification]]. The simplest of these models may be linear models, but it is common to deploy non-linear components to represent some general aspects of a catchment's response without going deeply into the real physical processes involved. An example of such an aspect is the well-known behavior that a catchment will respond much more quickly and strongly when it is already wet than when it is dry..\n* Models based on process descriptions. These models try to represent the physical processes observed in the real world. Typically, such models contain representations of [[surface runoff]], [[subsurface flow]], [[evapotranspiration]], and [[open channel flow|channel flow]], but they can be far more complicated. These models are known as deterministic hydrology models. Deterministic hydrology models can be subdivided into single-event models and continuous simulation models.\n\nRecent research in hydrological modeling tries to have a more global approach to the understanding of the [[behavioral modeling in hydrology|behavior of hydrologic systems]] to make better predictions and to face the major challenges in water resources management.\n\n=== Transport ===\n{{Main|Hydrologic transport model}}\nWater movement is a significant means by which other material, such as soil, gravel, boulders or pollutants, are transported from place to place. Initial input to receiving waters may arise from a [[point source (pollution)|point source]] discharge or a [[line source]] or [[Area source (pollution)|area source]], such as [[surface runoff]]. Since the 1960s rather complex [[mathematical model]]s have been developed, facilitated by the availability of high speed computers. The most common pollutant classes analyzed are [[nutrient]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[total dissolved solids]] and [[sediment]].\n\n== Organizations ==\n\n=== Intergovernmental organizations ===\n*

Himmler was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and one of the people most directly responsible for [[the Holocaust]].\n\nAs a member of a reserve battalion during World War I, Himmler did not see active service. He studied [[agronomy]] in university, and joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and the SS in 1925. In 1929, he was appointed ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' by Hitler. Over the next 16 years, he developed the SS from a mere 290-man battalion into a million-strong paramilitary group, and, following Hitler's orders, set up and controlled the [[Nazi concentration camps]]. He was known to have good organisational skills and for selecting highly competent subordinates, such as [[Reinhard Heydrich]] in 1931. From 1943 onwards, he was both Chief of German Police and Minister of the Interior, overseeing all internal and external police and security forces, including the [[Gestapo]] (Secret State Police). Himmler had a lifelong interest in [[occult]]ism, interpreting [[Neopaganism in German-speaking Europe|Germanic neopagan]] and ''[[V\u00f6lkisch movement|V\u00f6lkisch]]'' beliefs to promote the [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]], and incorporating [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] symbolism and rituals into the SS.\n\nOn Hitler's behalf, Himmler formed the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' and built [[extermination camp]]s. As facilitator and overseer of the concentration camps, Himmler directed the killing of some six million [[Jews]], between 200,000 and 500,000 [[Romani people]], and other victims; the total number of civilians killed by the regime is estimated at eleven to fourteen million people. Most of them were [[World War II crimes in Poland|Polish]] and [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizens.\n\nLate in World War II, Hitler briefly appointed him a military commander and later Commander of the [[Replacement Army|Replacement (Home) Army]] and [[Plenipotentiary|General Plenipotentiary]] for the administration of the entire Third Reich (''Generalbevollm\u00e4chtigter f\u00fcr die Verwaltung''). Specifically, he was given command of the [[Army Group Oberrhein (Germany)|Army Group Upper Rhine]] and the [[Army Group Vistula]]; he failed to achieve his assigned objectives and Hitler replaced him in these posts. Realising that the war was lost, he attempted to open peace talks with the western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] without Hitler's knowledge, shortly before the war ended. Hearing of this, Hitler dismissed him from all his posts in April 1945 and ordered his arrest. Himmler attempted to go into hiding, but was detained and then arrested by British forces once his identity became known. While in British custody, he committed suicide on 23 May 1945.\n\n== Early life ==\nHeinrich Luitpold Himmler was born in [[Munich]] on 7 October 1900 into a conservative middle-class Roman Catholic family. His father was Joseph Gebhard Himmler (17 May 1865 \u2013 29 October 1936), a teacher, and his mother was Anna Maria Himmler (n\u00e9e Heyder; 16 January 1866 \u2013 10 September 1941), a devout Roman Catholic. Heinrich had two brothers, [[Gebhard Ludwig Himmler|Gebhard Ludwig]] (29 July 1898 \u2013 1982) and [[Ernst Hermann Himmler|Ernst Hermann]] (23 December 1905 \u2013 2 May 1945).{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=12\u201315}}\n\nHimmler's first name, Heinrich, was that of his [[Godparent|godfather]], [[Prince Heinrich of Bavaria]], a member of the [[Line of succession to the former Bavarian throne|royal family of Bavaria]], who had been tutored by Gebhard Himmler.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=1}}{{sfn|Breitman|2004|p=9}} He attended a grammar school in [[Landshut]], where his father was deputy principal. While he did well in his schoolwork, he struggled in athletics.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=17\u201319}} He had poor health, suffering from lifelong stomach complaints and other ailments. In his youth he trained daily with weights and exercised to become stronger. Other boys at the school later remembered him as studious and awkward in social situations.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=3, 6\u20137}}\n\nHimmler's diary, which he kept intermittently from the age of 10, shows that he took a keen interest in current events, dueling, and \"the serious discussion of religion and sex\".{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=16}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=8}} In 1915, he began training with the Landshut Cadet Corps. His father used his connections with the royal family to get Himmler accepted as an officer candidate, and he enlisted with the reserve battalion of the 11th Bavarian Regiment in December 1917. His brother, Gebhard, served on the western front and saw combat, receiving the [[Iron Cross]] and eventually being promoted to lieutenant. In November 1918, while Himmler was still in training, the war ended with Germany's defeat, denying him the opportunity to become an officer or see combat. After his discharge on 18 December, he returned to Landshut.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=20\u201326}} After the war, Himmler completed his grammar-school education. From 1919\u201322, he studied [[agronomy]] at the Munich ''[[Technische Hochschule]]'' (now [[Technical University Munich]]) following a brief apprenticeship on a farm and a subsequent illness.{{sfn|Breitman|2004|p=12}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=29}}\n\nAlthough many regulations that discriminated against non-Christians\u2014including Jews and other minority groups\u2014had been eliminated during the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871, [[antisemitism]] continued to exist and thrive in Germany and other parts of Europe.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=22\u201325}} Himmler was antisemitic by the time he went to university, but not exceptionally so; students at his school would avoid their Jewish classmates.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=33, 42}} He remained a devoted Catholic while a student, and spent most of his leisure time with members of his fencing fraternity, the \"League of Apollo\", the president of which was Jewish. Himmler maintained a polite demeanor with him and with other Jewish members of the fraternity, in spite of his growing antisemitism.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=31, 35, 47}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=6, 8\u20139, 11}} During his second year at university, Himmler redoubled his attempts to pursue a military career. Although he was not successful, he was able to extend his involvement in the paramilitary scene in Munich. It was at this time that he first met [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]], an early member of the [[Nazi Party]] and co-founder of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (\"Storm Battalion\"; SA).{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=54}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=10}} Himmler admired R\u00f6hm because he was a decorated combat soldier, and at his suggestion Himmler joined his antisemitic nationalist group, the ''[[Bund Reichskriegsflagge]]'' (Imperial War Flag Society).{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=40}}\n\nIn 1922, Himmler became more interested in the \"[[Jewish question]]\", with his diary entries containing an increasing number of antisemitic remarks and recording a number of discussions about Jews with his classmates. His reading lists, as recorded in his diary, were dominated by antisemitic pamphlets, German myths, and occult tracts.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=42}} After the murder of Foreign Minister [[Walther Rathenau]] on 24 June, Himmler's political views veered towards the radical right, and he took part in demonstrations against the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|Hyperinflation]] was raging, and his parents could no longer afford to educate all three sons. Disappointed by his failure to make a career in the military and his parents' inability to finance his doctoral studies, he was forced to take a low-paying office job after obtaining his agricultural diploma.

This event would set Himmler on a life of politics. He was questioned by the police about his role in the putsch, but was not charged because of insufficient evidence. However, he lost his job, was unable to find employment as an agronomist, and had to move in with his parents in Munich. Frustrated by these failures, he became ever more irritable, aggressive, and opinionated, alienating both friends and family members.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=72\u201375}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nIn 1923\u201324, Himmler, while searching for a world view, came to abandon Catholicism and focused on the occult and in antisemitism. Germanic mythology, reinforced by occult ideas, became a religion for him. Himmler found the NSDAP appealing because its political positions agreed with his own views. Initially, he was not swept up by Hitler's charisma or the cult of F\u00fchrer worship. However, as he learned more about Hitler through his reading, he began to regard him as a useful face of the party,{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=77\u201381, 87}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=11\u201313}} and he later admired and even worshipped him.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=227}} To consolidate and advance his own position in the NSDAP, Himmler took advantage of the disarray in the party following Hitler's arrest in the wake of the Beer Hall Putsch.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=227}} From mid-1924 he worked under [[Gregor Strasser]] as a party secretary and propaganda assistant. Travelling all over Bavaria agitating for the party, he gave speeches and distributed literature. Placed in charge of the party office in Lower Bavaria by Strasser from late 1924, he was responsible for integrating the area's membership with the NSDAP under Hitler when the party was re-founded in February 1925.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=51}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=70, 81\u201388}}\n\nThat same year, he joined the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) as an SS-F\u00fchrer (SS-Leader); his SS number was 168.{{sfn|Biondi|2000|p=7}} The SS, initially part of the much larger SA, was formed in 1923 for Hitler's personal protection, and was re-formed in 1925 as an elite unit of the SA.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=228}} Himmler's first leadership position in the SS was that of ''SS-[[Gauf\u00fchrer]]'' (district leader) in Lower Bavaria from 1926. Strasser appointed Himmler deputy propaganda chief in January 1927. As was typical in the NSDAP, he had considerable freedom of action in his post, which increased over time. He began to collect statistics on the number of Jews, [[Freemasons]], and enemies of the party, and following his strong need for control, he developed an elaborate bureaucracy.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=89\u201392}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=15\u201316}} In September 1927, Himmler told Hitler of his vision to transform the SS into a loyal, powerful, racially pure elite unit.

The coalition government of the [[Weimar Republic]] was unable to improve the economy, so many voters turned to the political extreme, which included the NSDAP.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=9}} Hitler used [[populism|populist]] rhetoric, including blaming scapegoats\u2014particularly the Jews\u2014for the economic hardships.{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=376}} In the 1932 election, the Nazis won 37.3 percent of the vote and 230 seats in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]].{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224\u2013225}} Hitler was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]] by President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] on 30 January 1933, heading a short-lived coalition of his Nazis and the [[German National People's Party]].

Von Hindenburg died the next morning, and Hitler became both head of state and head of government under the title ''F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler'' (leader and chancellor).{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=226\u2013227}}\n\nThe Nazi Party's rise to power provided Himmler and the SS an unfettered opportunity to thrive. By 1933, the SS numbered 52,000 members.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=20, 22}} Strict membership requirements ensured that all members were of Hitler's [[Aryan race|Aryan]] ''[[Herrenvolk]]'' (\"Aryan master race\"). Applicants were vetted for Nordic qualities\u2014in Himmler's words, \"like a nursery gardener trying to reproduce a good old strain which has been adulterated and debased; we started from the principles of plant selection and then proceeded quite unashamedly to weed out the men whom we did not think we could use for the build-up of the SS.\"{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=41}} Few dared mention that by his own standards, Himmler did not meet his own ideals.{{sfn|Pringle|2006|p=52}}\n\nHimmler's organised, bookish intellect served him well as he began setting up different SS departments. In 1931 he appointed [[Reinhard Heydrich]] chief of the new Ic Service (intelligence service), which was renamed the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD: Security Service) in 1932. He later officially appointed Heydrich his deputy.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=17, 23, 151}} The two men had a good working relationship and a mutual respect.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=24, 27}} In 1933, they began to remove the SS from SA control. Along with Interior Minister Frick, they hoped to create a unified German police force. In March 1933, Reich Governor of Bavaria [[Franz Ritter von Epp]] appointed Himmler chief of the Munich Police. Himmler appointed Heydrich commander of Department IV, the [[Bavarian Political Police|political police]].{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=149}} That same year, Hitler promoted Himmler to the rank of SS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'', equal in rank to the senior SA commanders.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=29}} Thereafter, Himmler and Heydrich took over the political police of state after state; soon only Prussia was controlled by G\u00f6ring.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=66}}\n\nHimmler further established the [[SS-Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt|SS Race and Settlement Main Office]] (''Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt'' or RuSHA). He appointed Darr\u00e9 as its first chief, with the rank of SS-''[[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]]''. The department implemented racial policies and monitored the \"racial integrity\" of the SS membership.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=23, 36}} SS men were carefully vetted for their racial background. On 31 December 1931, Himmler introduced the \"marriage order\", which required SS men wishing to marry to produce family trees proving that both families were of Aryan descent to 1800.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=127, 353}} If any non-Aryan forebears were found in either family tree during the racial investigation, the person concerned was excluded from the SS.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=302}} Each man was issued a ''[[Sippenbuch]]'', a genealogical record detailing his genetic history.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=22\u201323}} Himmler expected that each SS marriage should produce at least four children, thus creating a pool of genetically superior prospective SS members. The programme had disappointing results; less than 40 per cent of SS men married and each produced only about one child.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=378}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 152-11-12, Dachau, Konzentrationslager, Besuch Himmlers.jpg|thumb|left|Himmler (front right, beside prisoner) visiting the [[Dachau Concentration Camp]] in 1936]]\n\nIn March 1933, less than three months after the Nazis came to power, Himmler set up the first official [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=344}} Hitler had stated that he did not want it to be just another prison or detention camp. Himmler appointed [[Theodor Eicke]], a convicted felon and ardent Nazi, to run the camp in June 1933.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=136, 137}} Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=84}} Its features included isolation of victims from the outside world, elaborate roll calls and work details, the use of force and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike; the guards' uniforms had a special ''Totenkopf'' insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, Himmler took control of the camps under the aegis of the SS, creating a separate division, the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde]]''.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=151\u2013153}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nInitially the camps housed political opponents; over time, undesirable members of German society\u2014criminals, vagrants, deviants\u2014were placed in the camps as well. A Hitler decree issued in December 1937 allowed for the incarceration of anyone deemed by the regime to be an undesirable member of society.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=87}} This included Jews, [[Romani people|Gypsies]], communists, and those persons of any other cultural, [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]], political, or religious affiliation deemed by the Nazis to be ''[[Untermensch]]'' (sub-human). Thus, the camps became a mechanism for social and racial engineering. By the outbreak of World War II in autumn 1939, there were six camps housing some 27,000 inmates. Death tolls were high.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=86\u201390}}\n\n=== Consolidation of power ===\nIn early 1934, Hitler and other Nazi leaders became concerned that R\u00f6hm was planning a coup d'\u00e9tat.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=306\u2013309}} R\u00f6hm had socialist and populist views, and believed that the real revolution had not yet begun. He felt that the SA\u2014now numbering some three million men, far dwarfing the army\u2014should become the sole arms-bearing corps of the state, and that the army should be absorbed into the SA under his leadership. R\u00f6hm [[lobbying|lobbied]] Hitler to appoint him [[defence minister|Minister of Defence]], a position held by conservative General [[Werner von Blomberg]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=24}}\n\nG\u00f6ring had created a Prussian [[secret police]] force, the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'' or [[Gestapo]] in 1933, and appointed [[Rudolf Diels]] as its head. G\u00f6ring, concerned that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over its control to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} Also on that date, Hitler appointed Himmler chief of all German police outside Prussia. This was a radical departure from long-standing German practice that law enforcement was a state and local matter.  Heydrich, named chief of the Gestapo by Himmler on 22 April 1934, also continued as head of the SD.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=61}}\n\nHitler decided on 21 June that R\u00f6hm and the SA leadership had to be eliminated. He sent G\u00f6ring to Berlin on 29 June, to meet with Himmler and Heydrich to plan the action. Hitler took charge in Munich, where R\u00f6hm was arrested; he gave R\u00f6hm the choice to commit suicide or be shot. When R\u00f6hm refused to kill himself, he was shot dead by two SS officers. Between 85 and 200 members of the SA leadership and other political adversaries, including Gregor Strasser, were killed between 30 June and 2 July 1934 in these actions, known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=308\u2013314}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=31\u201335, 39}} With the SA thus neutralised, the SS became an independent organisation answerable only to Hitler on 20 July 1934. Himmler's title of ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' became the highest formal SS rank, equivalent to a [[field marshal]] in the army.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=316}} The SA was converted into a sports and training organisation.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=313}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 152-08-35, Dachau, Konzentrationslager, Besuch Himmlers.jpg|thumb|upright|Himmler and [[Rudolf Hess]] at [[Dachau]] in 1936, viewing a scale model of [[Dachau Concentration Camp|the camp]].]]\n\nOn 15 September 1935, Hitler presented two laws\u2014known as the [[Nuremberg Laws]]\u2014to the Reichstag. The laws banned marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans and forbade the employment of non-Jewish women under the age of 45 in Jewish households. The laws also deprived so-called \"non-Aryans\" of the benefits of German citizenship.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=543\u2013545}} These laws were among the first race-based measures instituted by the Third Reich.\n\nHimmler and Heydrich wanted to extend the power of the SS; thus, they urged Hitler to form a national police force overseen by the SS, to guard Nazi Germany against its many enemies at the time\u2014real and imagined.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|pp=86, 87}} Interior Minister Frick also wanted a national police force, but one controlled by him, with [[Kurt Daluege]] as his police chief.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}} Hitler left it to Himmler and Heydrich to work out the arrangements with Frick. Himmler and Heydrich had greater bargaining power, as they were allied with Frick's old enemy, G\u00f6ring. Heydrich drew up a set of proposals and Himmler sent him to meet with Frick. An angry Frick then consulted with Hitler, who told him to agree to the proposals. Frick acquiesced, and on 17 June 1936 Hitler decreed the unification of all police forces in the Reich, and named Himmler Chief of German Police.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}} In this role, Himmler was still nominally subordinate to Frick. In practice, however, the police was now effectively a division of the SS, and hence independent of Frick's control. This move gave Himmler operational control over Germany's entire detective force.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=204}} He also gained authority over all of Germany's uniformed law enforcement agencies, which were amalgamated into the new ''[[Ordnungspolizei]]'' (Orpo: \"order police\"), which became a branch of the SS under Daluege.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}}\n\nShortly thereafter, Himmler created the ''[[Kriminalpolizei]]'' (Kripo: criminal police) as the umbrella organisation for all criminal investigation agencies in Germany.  The Kripo was merged with the Gestapo into the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' (SiPo: security police), under Heydrich's command.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=201}} In September 1939, following the outbreak of World War II, Himmler formed the ''[[SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]'' (RSHA: Reich Main Security Office) to bring the SiPo (which included the Gestapo and Kripo) and the SD together under one umbrella.

Nominally under the authority of Himmler, the Waffen-SS developed a fully militarised structure of command and operations. It grew from three regiments to over 38 divisions during World War II, serving alongside the ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' (army), but never being formally part of it.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=56, 57, 66}}\n\nIn addition to his military ambitions, Himmler established the beginnings of a parallel economy under the umbrella of the SS.{{sfn|Sereny|1996|pp=323, 329}} To this end, administrator [[Oswald Pohl]] set up the ''[[Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe]]'' (German Economic Enterprise) in 1940.

In contrast, Himmler was honest in matters of money and business.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=120}}\n\nIn 1938, as part of his preparations for war, Hitler ended the [[Sino-German cooperation until 1941|German alliance with China]], and entered into an agreement with the more modern Japan. That same year, Austria was unified with Nazi Germany in the [[Anschluss]], and the [[Munich Agreement]] gave Nazi Germany control over the [[Sudetenland]], part of [[Czechoslovakia]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=641, 653, 674}} Hitler's primary motivations for war included obtaining additional ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") for the Germanic peoples, who were considered racially superior according to [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=34}} A second goal was the elimination of those considered racially inferior, particularly the Jews and Slavs, from territories controlled by the Reich. From 1933 to 1938, hundreds of thousands of Jews emigrated to the United States, Palestine, Great Britain, and other countries. Some converted to Christianity.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=554\u2013558}}\n\n=== Anti-church struggle ===\n{{Main article|Kirchenkampf|Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church}}\n\nHimmler believed that a major task of the SS should be \"acting as the vanguard in overcoming Christianity and restoring a 'Germanic' way of living\" as part of preparations for the coming conflict between \"humans and subhumans\".{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=265}} Himmler biographer [[Peter Longerich]] wrote that, while the Nazi movement as a whole launched itself against Jews and Communists, \"by linking de-Christianisation with re-Germanization, Himmler had provided the SS with a goal and purpose all of its own\".{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=265}} Himmler was vehemently opposed to Christian sexual morality and the \"principle of Christian mercy\", both of which he saw as dangerous obstacles to his planned battle with \"subhumans\".{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=265}} In 1937, Himmler declared:\n\n{{quote|We live in an era of the ultimate conflict with Christianity.

The incidents were then used in [[Nazi propaganda]] to justify the invasion of [[Poland]], the opening event of World War II.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=518\u2013520}} At the beginning of the war against Poland, Hitler authorised the killing of Polish civilians, including Jews and ethnic Poles. The ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' (SS task forces) had originally been formed by Heydrich to secure government papers and offices in areas taken over by Germany before World War II.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=118, 122}} Authorised by Hitler and under the direction of Himmler and Heydrich, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' units\u2014now repurposed as [[death squad]]s\u2014followed the ''Heer'' (army) into Poland, and by the end of 1939 they [[Intelligenzaktion|had murdered some 65,000 intellectuals and other civilians]].

It called for the [[Baltic States]], Poland, [[Western Ukraine]], and [[Belarus|Byelorussia]] to be conquered and resettled by ten million German citizens. The current residents\u2014some 31 million people\u2014would be expelled further east, starved, or used for forced labour. The plan would have extended the border of Germany a thousand kilometres to the east (620 miles).

All males aged sixteen to sixty were eligible for conscription into this militia, over the protests of Armaments Minister [[Albert Speer]], who noted that irreplaceable skilled workers were being removed from armaments production.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1087}} Hitler confidently believed six million men could be raised, and the new units would \"initiate a people's war against the invader\".{{sfn|''The Battle for Germany'' 2011}} These hopes were wildly optimistic.{{sfn|''The Battle for Germany'' 2011}} In October 1944, children as young as fourteen were being enlisted.

Himmler ordered the offensive to stop on the 18th by a \"directive for regrouping\".{{sfn|Ziemke|1968|p=447}} Hitler officially ended Operation Solstice on 21 February and ordered Himmler to transfer a corps headquarter and three dvisions to Army Group Center.{{sfn|Ziemke|1968|p=448}}\n\nHimmler was unable to devise any viable plans for completion of his military objectives.

Bernadotte asked Himmler to put his proposal in writing, and Himmler obliged.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1187}}\n\nMeanwhile, G\u00f6ring had [[G\u00f6ring Telegram|sent a telegram]], a few hours earlier, asking Hitler for permission to assume leadership of the ''Reich''\u2014an act that Hitler, under the prodding of [[Martin Bormann]], interpreted as a demand to step down or face a coup. On 27 April, Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's HQ in Berlin, [[Hermann Fegelein]], was caught in civilian clothes preparing to desert; he was arrested and brought back to the ''[[F\u00fchrerbunker]]''. On the evening of 28 April, the [[BBC]] broadcast a [[Reuters]] news report about Himmler's attempted negotiations with the western Allies. Hitler, who had long considered Himmler to be second only to [[Joseph Goebbels]] in loyalty (he called Himmler \"the loyal Heinrich\"), flew into a rage at this apparent betrayal. Hitler told those who were still with him in the bunker complex that Himmler's act was the worst treachery he had ever known and ordered his arrest.

In the testament, completed on 29 April\u2014one day prior to [[death of Adolf Hitler|his suicide]]\u2014Hitler declared both Himmler and G\u00f6ring to be traitors.

Himmler was taken to the headquarters of the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second British Army]] in L\u00fcneburg, where a doctor conducted a medical exam on him. The doctor attempted to examine the inside of Himmler's mouth, but the prisoner was reluctant to open it and jerked his head away. Himmler then bit into a hidden [[potassium cyanide]] pill and collapsed onto the floor. He was dead within 15 minutes.{{sfn|''Bend Bulletin''|1945}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=1\u20133}} Shortly afterward, Himmler's body was buried in an [[unmarked grave]] near L\u00fcneburg. The grave's location remains unknown.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=248}}\n\n== Mysticism and symbolism ==\n{{main article|Ideology of the SS}}\n\nHimmler was interested in [[mysticism]] and the [[occult]] from an early age. He tied this interest into his racist philosophy, looking for proof of Aryan and Nordic racial superiority from ancient times. He promoted a cult of ancestor worship, particularly among members of the SS, as a way to keep the race pure and provide immortality to the nation.\n[[File:Sig runes.svg|thumb|left|90px|The stylised lightning bolts of the SS insignia were based on the [[Armanen runes]] of [[Guido von List]].]] Viewing the SS as an \"order\" along the lines of the [[Teutonic Knights]], he had them take over the [[Church of the Teutonic Order, Vienna|Church of the Teutonic Order in Vienna]] in 1939. He began the process of replacing Christianity with a new moral code that rejected humanitarianism and challenged the Christian concept of marriage.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=256\u2013273}} The [[Ahnenerbe]], a research society founded by Himmler in 1935, conducted research all over the globe to look for proof of the superiority and ancient origins of the Germanic race.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=134}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=50}}\n\nAll regalia and uniforms of Nazi Germany, particularly those of the SS, used symbolism in their designs. The [[Runic insignia of the Schutzstaffel|stylised lightning bolt]] logo of the SS was chosen in 1932. The logo is a pair of [[runic alphabets|runes]] from a set of 18 [[Armanen runes]] created by [[Guido von List]] in 1906. The ancient [[Sowil\u014d]] rune originally symbolised the sun, but was renamed \"Sig\" (victory) in List's iconography.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=64}} Himmler modified a variety of existing customs to emphasise the elitism and central role of the SS; an SS naming ceremony was to replace baptism, marriage ceremonies were to be altered, a separate SS funeral ceremony was to be held in addition to Christian ceremonies, and SS-centric celebrations of the [[Summer solstice|summer]] and [[winter solstice]]s were instituted.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|pp=93, 94}}{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|pp=38\u201345, 48, 49}} The ''[[Totenkopf]]'' (death's head) symbol, used by German military units for hundreds of years, had been chosen for the SS by Schreck.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=71}} Himmler placed particular importance on the [[SS-Ehrenring|death's-head rings]]; they were never to be sold, and were to be returned to him upon the death of the owner. He interpreted the deaths-head symbol to mean solidarity to the cause and a commitment unto death.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=287}}\n\n== Relationship with Hitler ==\nAs second in command of the SS and then Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS, Himmler was in regular contact with Hitler to arrange for SS men as bodyguards;{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=16}} Himmler was not involved with Nazi Party policy-making decisions in the years leading up to the seizure of power.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=20}} From the late 1930s, the SS was independent of the control of other state agencies or government departments, and he reported only to Hitler.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=251}}\n\nHitler's leadership style was to give contradictory orders to subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=29}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=323}} Hitler typically did not issue written orders, but gave them orally at meetings or in phone conversations; he also had Bormann convey orders.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=377}} Bormann used his position to control the flow of information and access to Hitler,{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=47}} earning him enemies, including Himmler.\n\nHitler promoted and practised the ''[[F\u00fchrerprinzip]]''. The principle required absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors; thus Hitler viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself\u2014the infallible leader\u2014at the apex.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=181}} Accordingly, Himmler placed himself in a position of subservience to Hitler, and was unconditionally obedient to him.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=83}} However, he\u2014like other top Nazi officials\u2014had aspirations to one day succeed Hitler as leader of the Reich.{{sfn|Sereny|1996|pp=322\u2013323}} Himmler considered Speer to be an especially dangerous rival, both in the Reich administration and as a potential successor to Hitler.{{sfn|Sereny|1996|pp=424\u2013425}} Speer refused to accept Himmler's offer of the high rank of [[SS-Oberst-Gruppenf\u00fchrer]], as he felt to do so would put him in Himmler's debt and obligate him to allow Himmler a say in armaments production.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=473}}\n\nHitler called Himmler's mystical and pseudoreligious interests \"nonsense\".{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=141, 212}} Himmler was not a member of Hitler's inner circle; the two men were not very close, and rarely saw each other socially.{{sfn|Toland|1977|p=869}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=29}} Himmler socialised almost exclusively with other members of the SS.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=80}} His unconditional loyalty and efforts to please Hitler earned him the nickname of ''der treue Heinrich'' (\"the faithful Heinrich\"). In the last days of the war, when it became clear that Hitler planned to die in Berlin, Himmler left his long-time superior to try to save himself.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=4, 407\u2013408}}\n\n== Marriage and family ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1969-056-55, Heinrich Himmler mit Frau und Tochter Gudrun.jpg|thumb|upright|Himmler with his wife Margarete and daughter [[Gudrun Burwitz|Gudrun]].]]\nHimmler met his future wife, [[Margarete Himmler|Margarete Boden]], in 1927. Seven years his senior, she was a nurse who shared his interest in herbal medicine and [[homoeopathy]], and was part owner of a small private clinic. They were married in July 1928, and their only child, [[Gudrun Burwitz|Gudrun]], was born on 8 August 1929.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=17}} The couple were also foster parents to a boy named Gerhard von Ahe, son of an SS officer who had died before the war.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=258}} Margarete sold her share of the clinic and used the proceeds to buy a plot of land in Waldtrudering, near Munich, where they erected a prefabricated house. Himmler was constantly away on party business, so his wife took charge of their efforts\u2014mostly unsuccessful\u2014to raise livestock for sale. They had a dog, T\u00f6hle.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=109\u2013110}}\n\nAfter the Nazis came to power the family moved first to M\u00f6hlstrasse in Munich, and in 1934 to [[Tegernsee (lake)|Lake Tegern]], where they bought a house. Himmler also later obtained a large house in the Berlin suburb of [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]], free of charge, as an official residence. The couple saw little of each other as Himmler became totally absorbed by work.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=27}} The relationship was strained.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=109, 374\u2013375}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=40\u201341}} The couple did unite for social functions; they were frequent guests at the Heydrich home. Margarete saw it as her duty to invite the wives of the senior SS leaders over for afternoon coffee and tea on Wednesday afternoons.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=111}}\n\n[[File:Several images of SS leader Heinrich Himmler with his daughter Gudrun, varies dates.gif|thumb|left|upright|Images of Himmler and Gudrun together]]\n[[Hedwig Potthast]], Himmler's young secretary starting in 1936, became his mistress by 1939. She left her job in 1941. He arranged accommodation for her, first in [[Mecklenburg]] and later at [[Berchtesgaden]]. He fathered two children with her: a son, Helge (born 15 February 1942) and a daughter, Nanette Dorothea (born 20 July 1944, Berchtesgaden). Margarete, by then living in [[Gmund am Tegernsee|Gmund]] with her daughter, learned of the relationship sometime in 1941; she and Himmler were already separated, and she decided to tolerate the relationship for the sake of her daughter. Working as a nurse for the [[German Red Cross]] during the war, Margarete was appointed supervisor in [[Military district (Germany)|Military District]] III (Berlin-Brandenburg). Himmler was close to his first daughter, Gudrun, whom he nicknamed ''P\u00fcppi'' (\"dolly\"); he phoned her every few days and visited as often as he could.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=466\u201368}}\n\nMargarete's diaries reveal that Gerhard had to leave the [[National Political Institutes of Education|National Political Educational Institute]] in Berlin because of poor results. At the age of 16 he joined the SS in [[Brno]] and shortly afterwards went \"into battle\", He was captured by the Russians but later returned to Germany.{{sfn|Himmler|2007|p=285}}\n\nHedwig and Margarete both remained loyal to Himmler. Writing to Gebhard in February 1945, Margarete said, \"How wonderful that he has been called to great tasks and is equal to them. The whole of Germany is looking to him.\"{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=732}} Hedwig expressed similar sentiments in a letter to Himmler in January. Margarete and Gudrun left Gmund as Allied troops advanced into the area. They were arrested by American troops in [[Bolzano]], Italy, and held in various internment camps in Italy, France, and Germany. They were brought to Nuremberg to testify at the trials and were released in November 1946. Gudrun emerged from the experience embittered by her alleged mistreatment and has remained devoted to her father's memory.{{sfn|Himmler|2007|p=275}}{{sfn|Sify News|2010}} She later worked for the West German spy agency [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|''Bundesnachrichtendienst'' (BND)]] from 1961 to 1963.{{sfn|''Deutsche Welle''|2018}}\n\n== Historical assessment ==\n[[File:Himmler-death-mask.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Death mask]] of Himmler on display in the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London]]\n\nSpeer said that though Himmler seemed pedantic and insignificant on the surface, he was a good decision maker, had a talent for selecting highly competent staff, and successfully inserted the SS into every aspect of daily life.{{sfn|Sereny|1996|pp=323\u2013324}} Peter Longerich observes that Himmler's ability to consolidate his ever-increasing powers and responsibilities into a coherent system under the auspices of the SS led him to become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=747}}\n\nHistorian Wolfgang Sauer says that \"although he was pedantic, dogmatic, and dull, Himmler emerged under Hitler as second in actual power. His strength lay in a combination of unusual shrewdness, burning ambition, and servile loyalty to Hitler.\"{{sfn|Sauer, Wolfgang}} Historian Peter Padfield opined that \"Himmler&nbsp;... appeared the most powerful man under Hitler. It is impossible to say whether he was in practice, and meaningless to ask, since he was never prepared to use his power directly to change the course of events...\".{{sfn|Padfield|2001|p=534}}\n\nHistorian [[John Toland (author)|John Toland]] relates a story by G\u00fcnter Syrup, a subordinate of Heydrich. Heydrich showed him a picture of Himmler and said, \"The top half is the teacher but the lower half is the sadist.\"{{sfn|Toland|1977|p=812}} Historian [[Adrian Weale]] comments that Himmler and the SS followed Hitler's policies, without question or ethical considerations. Himmler accepted Hitler and Nazi ideology, and saw the SS as a chivalric Teutonic order of new Germans. Himmler adopted the doctrine of ''[[Auftragstaktik]]'' (\"mission command\"), whereby orders were given as broad directives, with authority delegated downward to the appropriate level to carry them out in a timely and efficient manner. Weale states that the SS ideology gave the men a doctrinal framework, and the mission command tactics allowed the junior officers leeway to act on their own initiative to obtain the desired results.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=3, 4}}\n\nIn 2008, the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' described Himmler as one of the most brutal mass murderers in history, and the architect of the Holocaust.{{sfn|Von Wiegrefe|2008}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Germany|Biography|World War II}}\n* [[Glossary of Nazi Germany]]\n* ''[[Lebensborn]]''\n* [[List of Nazi Party leaders and officials]]\n* [[List of SS personnel]]\n* [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Explanatory notes ===\n{{notes\n| notes =\n{{efn\n| name = note\n| At that time ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' was only a titled position, not an actual SS rank {{harv|McNab|2009|pp=18, 29}}.\n}}\n}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n==== Printed ====\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n | editor1-last  = Biondi\n | editor1-first = Robert\n | title = SS Officers List: (as of 30 January 1942): SS-Standartenfuhrer to SS-Oberstgruppenfuhrer: Assignments and Decorations of the Senior SS Officer Corps\n | publisher = Schiffer\n | location = Atglen, PA\n | year = 2000\n | origyear = 1942\n | isbn = 978-0-7643-1061-4\n | ref = harv\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Breitman\n | first = Richard\n | title = Himmler and the Final Solution: The Architect of Genocide\n | publisher = Pimlico\n | location = London\n | year = 2004\n | isbn = 978-1-84413-089-4\n | ref = harv\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Bullock\n | first = Alan\n | title = Hitler: A Study in Tyranny\n | year = 1999\n | origyear = 1952\n | publisher = Konecky & Konecky\n | location = New York\n | isbn = 978-1-56852-036-0\n | ref = harv\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Cecil\n | first = Robert\n | author-link = Robert Cecil (British diplomat)\n | title = The Myth of the Master Race: Alfred Rosenberg and Nazi Ideology\n | publisher = Dodd, Mead\n | location = New York\n | year = 1972\n | isbn= 978-0-396-06577-7\n | ref = harv\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Cesarani\n | first = David\n | authorlink = David Cesarani\n | title = Holocaust: From the Persecution of the Jews to Mass Murder\n | publisher = Routledge\n | location = London\n | year = 2004\n | isbn = 978-0-415-27511-8\n | ref= harv\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Duffy\n | first = Christopher\n | authorlink = Christopher Duffy\n | title = Red Storm on the Reich: The Soviet March On Germany, 1945\n | year = 1991\n | publisher = Da Capo Press\n | location = New York\n | isbn = 978-0-306-80505-9\n | ref = harv\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Evans\n | first = Richard J.\n | authorlink = Richard J.

|ref=ietf}}</ref> HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the [[World Wide Web]], where [[hypertext]] documents include [[hyperlink]]s to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a [[Computer mouse|mouse]] click or by tapping the screen. HTTP was developed to facilitate hypertext and the World Wide Web.\n\nDevelopment of HTTP was initiated by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]] in 1989. Development of HTTP standards was coordinated by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) and the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), culminating in the publication of a series of [[Requests for Comments]] (RFCs). The first definition of HTTP/1.1, the version of HTTP in common use, occurred in {{IETF RFC|2068}} in 1997, although this was made obsolete by {{IETF RFC|2616}} in 1999 and then again by the {{IETF RFC|7230}} family of RFCs in 2014.\n\nA later version, the successor [[HTTP/2]], was standardized in 2015, and is now supported by major web servers and browsers over TLS using [[ALPN]] extension<ref name=\"rfc7301\">{{cite web |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7301 |title=Transport Layer Security (TLS) Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation Extension |publisher=IETF |date=July 2014 |rfc=7301}}</ref> where [[Transport Layer Security#TLS 1.2|TLS 1.2]] or newer is required.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Belshe |first1=M. |last2=Peon |first2=R. |last3=Thomson |first3=M. |title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2, Use of TLS Features |url=https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#TLSUsage |accessdate=2015-02-10}}</ref>\n\n==Technical overview==\n[[File:Internet1.svg|thumb|right|[[URL]] beginning with the HTTP scheme and the [[World Wide Web|WWW]] domain name label.]]\n\nHTTP functions as a [[request\u2013response]] protocol in the client\u2013server computing model. A [[web browser]], for example, may be the ''client'' and an application running on a computer [[Host (network)|hosting]] a [[website]] may be the ''server''. The client submits an HTTP ''request'' message to the server. The server, which provides ''resources'' such as [[HTML]] files and other content, or performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a ''response'' message to the client. The response contains completion status information about the request and may also contain requested content in its message body.\n\nA web browser is an example of a ''[[user agent]]'' (UA). Other types of user agent include the indexing software used by search providers ([[web crawler]]s), [[voice browser]]s, [[mobile app]]<nowiki/>s, and other [[software]] that accesses, consumes, or displays web content.\n\nHTTP is designed to permit intermediate network elements to improve or enable communications between clients and servers. High-traffic websites often benefit from [[web cache]] servers that deliver content on behalf of [[upstream server]]s to improve response time. Web browsers cache previously accessed web resources and reuse them, when possible, to reduce network traffic. HTTP [[proxy server]]s at [[private network]] boundaries can facilitate communication for clients without a globally routable address, by relaying messages with external servers.\n\nHTTP is an [[application layer]] protocol designed within the framework of the [[Internet protocol suite]]. Its definition presumes an underlying and reliable [[transport layer]] protocol,<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=Overall Operation |section=1.4 |page=12 |idanchor=ietf}}</ref> and [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) is commonly used. However, HTTP can be adapted to use unreliable protocols such as the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP), for example in [[Universal Plug and Play#Protocol|HTTPU]] and [[Simple Service Discovery Protocol]] (SSDP).\n\n[[Web resource|HTTP resources]] are identified and located on the network by [[Uniform Resource Locator]]s (URLs), using the [[Uniform Resource Identifier]]s (URI's) schemes ''http'' and ''[[https]]''. URIs and [[hyperlink]]s in [[HTML]] documents form interlinked [[hypertext]] documents.\n\nHTTP/1.1 is a revision of the original HTTP (HTTP/1.0). In HTTP/1.0 a separate [[Connection-oriented communication|connection]] to the same server is made for every resource request. HTTP/1.1 can reuse a connection multiple times to download images, [[Client-side scripting|scripts]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|stylesheets]], ''etc'' after the page has been delivered. HTTP/1.1 communications therefore experience less [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] as the establishment of TCP connections presents considerable overhead.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tim Berners-Lee CP 2.jpg|thumb|[[Tim Berners-Lee]]]]\n\nThe term [[hypertext]] was coined by [[Ted Nelson]] in 1965 in the [[Xanadu Project]], which was in turn inspired by [[Vannevar Bush]]'s 1930s vision of the microfilm-based information retrieval and management \"[[memex]]\" system described in his 1945 essay \"[[As We May Think]]\". [[Tim Berners-Lee]] and his team at [[CERN]] are credited with inventing the original HTTP, along with HTML and the associated technology for a web server and a text-based web browser. Berners-Lee first proposed the \"WorldWideWeb\" project in 1989\u2014now known as the [[World Wide Web]]. The first version of the protocol had only one method, namely GET, which would request a page from a server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Berners-Lee |first=Tim |title=HyperText Transfer Protocol |url=http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP.html |publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref> The response from the server was always an HTML page.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Original HTTP as defined in 1991 |url=http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |accessdate=24 July 2010 |author=[[Tim Berners-Lee]]}}</ref>\n\nThe first documented version of HTTP was '''[http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html HTTP V0.9]''' (1991).

An HTTP client initiates a request by establishing a [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) connection to a particular [[TCP and UDP port|port]] on a server (typically port 80, occasionally port 8080; see [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers]]). An HTTP server listening on that port waits for a client's request message. Upon receiving the request, the server sends back a status line, such as \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\", and a message of its own. The body of this message is typically the requested resource, although an error message or other information may also be returned.<ref name=\"ietf2616\" />\n\n==HTTP authentication==\nHTTP provides multiple authentication schemes such as [[basic access authentication]] and [[digest access authentication]] which operate via  a challenge-response mechanism whereby the server identifies and issues a challenge before serving the requested content.\n\nHTTP provides a general framework for access control and authentication, via an extensible set of challenge-response authentication schemes, which can be used by a server to challenge a client request and by a client to provide authentication information.<ref name=\"ietf7235\">{{cite IETF |rfc=7235 |title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Authentication |first1=Roy T. |last1=Fielding |first2=Julian F. |last2=Reschke |publisher=IETF |year=2014 |month=June |ref=ietf}}</ref>\n\n===Authentication realms===\nThe HTTP Authentication specification also provides an arbitrary, implementation-specific construct for further dividing resources common to a given root URI. The realm value string, if present, is combined with the canonical root URI to form the protection space component of the challenge. This in effect allows the server to define separate authentication scopes under one root URI.<ref name=\"ietf7235\" />\n\n==Request methods==\n[[File:Http request telnet ubuntu.png|thumb|right|An HTTP 1.1 request made using telnet. The [[HTTP request|request]] message, [[HTTP response|response]] header section, and response body are highlighted.]]\nHTTP defines methods (sometimes referred to as ''verbs'', but nowhere in the specification does it mention ''verb'', nor is OPTIONS or HEAD a verb) to indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified resource. What this resource represents, whether pre-existing data or data that is generated dynamically, depends on the implementation of the server. Often, the resource corresponds to a file or the output of an executable residing on the server. The HTTP/1.0 specification<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=1945 |title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol \u2013 HTTP/1.0 |first1=Tim |last1=Berners-Lee |first2=Roy T. |last2=Fielding |first3=Henrik Frystyk |last3=Nielsen |publisher=IETF |sectionname=Method Definitions |section=8 |pages=30\u201332}}</ref> defined the GET, POST and HEAD methods and the HTTP/1.1 specification<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=Method Definitions |section=9 |pages=51\u201357 |idanchor=ietf}}</ref> added five new methods: OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE and CONNECT. By being specified in these documents, their semantics are well-known and can be depended on. Any client can use any method and the server can be configured to support any combination of methods. If a method is unknown to an intermediate, it will be treated as an unsafe and [[idempotence|non-idempotent]] method. There is no limit to the number of methods that can be defined and this allows for future methods to be specified without breaking existing infrastructure. For example, [[WebDAV]] defined 7 new methods and {{IETF RFC|5789}} specified the [[Patch verb|PATCH]] method.\n\n{{main| List of HTTP header fields}}\n\n;GET:The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only [[Data retrieval|retrieve data]] and should have no other effect. (This is also true of some other HTTP methods.)<ref name=\"ietf2616\" /> The [[W3C]] has published guidance principles on this distinction, saying, \"[[Web application]] design should be informed by the above principles, but also by the relevant limitations.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Jacobs |first=Ian |title=URIs, Addressability, and the use of HTTP GET and POST |url=http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html#checklist |work=Technical Architecture Group finding |publisher=W3C |accessdate=26 September 2010 |year=2004}}</ref> See [[#Safe methods|safe methods]] below.\n;HEAD: The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body. This is useful for retrieving meta-information written in response headers, without having to transport the entire content.\n;POST: The [[POST (HTTP)|POST method]] requests that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the [[web resource]] identified by the URI. The data POSTed might be, for example, an annotation for existing resources; a message for a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or comment thread; a block of data that is the result of submitting a [[Form (HTML)|web form]] to a data-handling process; or an item to add to a database.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=POST |section=9.5 |page=54 |idanchor=ietf}}</ref>\n;PUT: The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied [[URI]]. If the URI refers to an already existing resource, it is modified; if the URI does not point to an existing resource, then the server can create the resource with that URI.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=PUT |section=9.6 |page=55 |idanchor=ietf}}</ref>\n;DELETE: The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.\n;TRACE: The TRACE method echoes the received request so that a client can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediate servers.\n;OPTIONS: The OPTIONS method returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for the specified [[URL]]. This can be used to check the functionality of a web server by requesting '*' instead of a specific resource.\n;CONNECT:<ref name=\"rfc2616.9.9\">{{cite IETF |title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol \u2013 HTTP/1.1 |rfc=2616 |sectionname=CONNECT |section=9.9 |page=57 |year=1999 |month=June |publisher=IETF |accessdate=23 February 2014}}</ref> The CONNECT method converts the request connection to a transparent [[tunneling protocol|TCP/IP tunnel]], usually to facilitate [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]]-encrypted communication (HTTPS) through an unencrypted [[HTTP proxy]].<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2817 |title=Upgrading to TLS Within HTTP/1.1 |first1=Rohit |last1=Khare |first2=Scott |last2=Lawrence |year=2000 |month=May |publisher=IETF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/150227 |title=Vulnerability Note VU#150227: HTTP proxy default configurations allow arbitrary TCP connections |accessdate=2007-05-10 |date=2002-05-17 |publisher=[[CERT Coordination Center|US-CERT]]}}</ref> See [[HTTP tunnel#HTTP CONNECT tunneling|HTTP CONNECT tunneling]].\n;PATCH: The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=5789 |title=PATCH Method for HTTP |first1=Lisa |last1=Dusseault |first2=James M. |last2=Snell |year=2010 |month=March |publisher=IETF}}</ref>\nAll general-purpose HTTP servers are required to implement at least the GET and HEAD methods, and all other methods are considered optional by the specification.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=Method |section=5.1.1 |page=36 |idanchor=ietf}}</ref>\n\n===Safe methods===\nSome of the  methods (for example, HEAD, GET, OPTIONS and TRACE) are, by convention, defined as ''safe'', which means they are intended only for information retrieval and should not change the state of the server. In other words, they should not have [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]], beyond relatively harmless effects such as [[Server log|logging]], web caching, the serving of [[web banner|banner advertisements]] or incrementing a [[web counter]]. Making arbitrary GET requests without regard to the context of the application's state should therefore be considered safe. However, this is not mandated by the standard, and it is explicitly acknowledged that it cannot be guaranteed.\n\nBy contrast, methods such as POST, PUT, DELETE and PATCH are intended for actions that may cause side effects either on the server, or external side effects such as [[eCommerce|financial transactions]] or transmission of [[email]]. Such methods are therefore not usually used by conforming [[Internet bot|web robots]] or web crawlers; some that do not conform tend to make requests without regard to context or consequences.\n\nDespite the prescribed safety of ''GET'' requests, in practice their handling by the server is not technically limited in any way. Therefore, careless or deliberate programming can cause non-trivial changes on the server. This is discouraged, because it can cause problems for [[web caching]], [[search engines]] and other automated agents, which can make unintended changes on the server. For example, a website might allow deletion of a resource through a URL such as ''http://example.com/article/1234/delete'', which, if arbitrarily fetched, even using ''GET'', would simply delete the article.<ref name=\"oreilly-get-rails\">{{cite book |last=Ediger |first=Brad |date=2007-12-21 |title=Advanced Rails: Building Industrial-Strength Web Apps in Record Time |url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510329.do |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |page=188 |isbn= 0596519729 |quote=\"A common mistake is to use GET for an action that updates a resource. [...] This problem came into the Rails public eye in 2005, when the Google Web Accelerator was released.\"}}</ref>\n\nOne example of this occurring in practice was during the short-lived [[Google Web Accelerator]] [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta]], which prefetched arbitrary URLs on the page a user was viewing, causing records to be automatically altered or deleted ''en masse''. The beta was suspended only weeks after its first release, following widespread criticism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.adobe.com/cantrell/archives/2005/06/what_have_we_le.html |title=What Have We Learned From the Google Web Accelerator? |last=Cantrell |first=Christian |date=2005-06-01 |website=Adobe Blogs |publisher=Adobe |access-date=2017-07-18}}</ref><ref name=\"oreilly-get-rails\" />\n\n===Idempotent methods and web applications===\nMethods PUT and DELETE are defined to be [[idempotent#Computer science meaning|idempotent]], meaning that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request ({{citation needed span|note that idempotence refers to the state of the system after the request has completed, so while the action the server takes (e.g. deleting a record) or the response code it returns may be different on subsequent requests, the system state will be the same every time|date=October 2016}}). Methods GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE, being prescribed as safe, should also be idempotent, as HTTP is a [[stateless protocol]].<ref name=\"ietf2616\" />\n\nIn contrast, the POST method is not necessarily idempotent, and therefore sending an identical POST request multiple times may further affect state or cause further side effects (such as [[ecommerce|financial transactions]]). In some cases this may be desirable, but in other cases this could be due to an accident, such as when a user does not realize that their action will result in sending another request, or they did not receive adequate feedback that their first request was successful. While [[web browser]]s may show [[alert dialog box]]es to warn users in some cases where reloading a page may re-submit a POST request, it is generally up to the web application to handle cases where a POST request should not be submitted more than once.\n\nNote that whether a method is idempotent is not enforced by the protocol or web server. It is perfectly possible to write a web application in which (for example) a database insert or other non-idempotent action is triggered by a GET or other request. Ignoring this recommendation, however, may result in undesirable consequences, if a [[user agent]] assumes that repeating the same request is safe when it is not.\n\n===Security===\nThe TRACE method can be used as part of a class of attacks known as [[cross-site tracing]]; for that reason, common security advice is for it to be disabled in the server configuration.<ref name=\"OWASP-XST\">{{cite web |url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross_Site_Tracing |title=Cross Site Tracing |publisher=[[OWASP]] |accessdate=2016-06-22}}</ref> Microsoft [[Internet Information Services|IIS]] supports a proprietary \"TRACK\" method, which behaves similarly, and which is likewise recommended to be disabled.<ref name=\"OWASP-XST\" />\n\n===Summary table===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: auto; table-layout: fixed;\"\n|-\n!

The way the [[user agent]] handles the response depends primarily on the code, and secondarily on the other [[HTTP response header field|response header fields]]. Custom status codes can be used, for if the user agent encounters a code it does not recognize, it can use the first digit of the code to determine the general class of the response.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=Status-Line |section=6.1 |page=39 |idanchor=ietf}}</ref>\n\nThe standard ''reason phrases'' are only recommendations, and can be replaced with \"local equivalents\" at the [[web developer]]'s discretion. If the status code indicated a problem, the user agent might display the ''reason phrase'' to the user to provide further information about the nature of the problem. The standard also allows the user agent to attempt to interpret the ''reason phrase'', though this might be unwise since the standard explicitly specifies that status codes are machine-readable and ''reason phrases'' are human-readable. HTTP status code is primarily divided into five groups for better explanation of request and responses between client and server as named:\n\n* Informational <code>1XX</code>\n* Successful <code>2XX</code>\n* Redirection <code>3XX</code>\n* Client Error <code>4XX</code>\n* Server Error <code>5XX</code>\n\n==Persistent connections==\n{{Main|HTTP persistent connection}}\nIn HTTP/0.9 and 1.0, the connection is closed after a single request/response pair. In HTTP/1.1 a keep-alive-mechanism was introduced, where a connection could be reused for more than one request. Such ''persistent connections'' reduce request [[latency (engineering)|latency]] perceptibly, because the client does not need to re-negotiate the TCP 3-Way-Handshake connection after the first request has been sent. Another positive side effect is that, in general, the connection becomes faster with time due to TCP's [[slow-start]]-mechanism.\n\nVersion 1.1 of the protocol also made bandwidth optimization improvements to HTTP/1.0. For example, HTTP/1.1 introduced [[chunked transfer encoding]] to allow content on persistent connections to be streamed rather than buffered. [[HTTP pipelining]] further reduces lag time, allowing clients to send multiple requests before waiting for each response. Another addition to the protocol was [[byte serving]], where a server transmits just the portion of a resource explicitly requested by a client.\n\n==HTTP session state==\nHTTP is a [[stateless protocol]]. A stateless protocol does not require the [[HTTP server]] to retain information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests. However, some [[web application]]s implement states or [[Session (computer science)|server side sessions]] using for instance [[HTTP cookie]]s or hidden [[variable (computer science)|variable]]s within [[Form (web)|web form]]s.\n\n==Encrypted connections==\nThe most popular way of establishing an encrypted HTTP connection is HTTPS.<ref>{{cite book |last=Canavan |first=John |title=Fundamentals of Networking Security |year=2001 |publisher=Artech House |location=Norwood, MA |isbn=9781580531764 |pages=82\u201383}}</ref> Two other methods for establishing an encrypted HTTP connection also exist: [[Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol]], and using the [[HTTP/1.1 Upgrade header]] to specify an upgrade to TLS.

He studied sciences and engineering in the German cities of [[Dresden]], [[Technical University of Munich|Munich]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], where he studied under [[Gustav R. Kirchhoff]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]. In 1880, Hertz obtained his PhD from the [[University of Berlin]], and for the next three years remained for post-doctoral study under Helmholtz, serving as his assistant. In 1883, Hertz took a post as a lecturer in theoretical physics at the [[University of Kiel]]. In 1885, Hertz became a full professor at the [[University of Karlsruhe]].\n\nIn 1886, Hertz married Elisabeth Doll, the daughter of Dr. Max Doll, a lecturer in geometry at Karlsruhe. They had two daughters: Johanna, born on 20 October 1887 and [[Mathilde Carmen Hertz|Mathilde]], born on 14 January 1891, who went on to become a notable biologist. During this time Hertz conducted his landmark research into electromagnetic waves.\n\nHertz took a  position of Professor of Physics and Director of the Physics Institute in [[Bonn]] on 3 April 1889, a position he held until January 1894. During this time he worked on theoretical mechanics with his work published in the book ''Die Prinzipien der Mechanik in neuem Zusammenhange dargestellt'' (''The Principles of Mechanics Presented in a New Form''), published posthumously in 1894.\n\n===Death===\nIn 1892, Hertz was diagnosed with an infection (after a bout of severe [[migraines]]) and underwent operations to treat the illness.

However, Hertz did not contribute much to the field himself except some early articles as an assistant to Helmholtz in [[Berlin]], including research on the [[evaporation]] of liquids, a new kind of [[hygrometer]], and a graphical means of determining the properties of moist air when subjected to [[adiabatic]] changes.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1119/1.18565|author1=Mulligan, J.

Hertz is well known for his contributions to the field of electrodynamics (''see below''); however, most papers that look into the fundamental nature of contact cite his two papers as a source for some important ideas. [[Joseph Valentin Boussinesq]] published some critically important observations on Hertz's work, nevertheless establishing this work on contact mechanics to be of immense importance. His work basically summarises how two [[axi-symmetric]] objects placed in contact will behave under [[Structural load|loading]], he obtained results based upon the classical theory of [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[continuum mechanics]]. The most significant failure of his theory was the neglect of any nature of [[adhesion]] between the two solids, which proves to be important as the materials composing the solids start to assume high elasticity. It was natural to neglect adhesion in that age as there were no experimental methods of testing for it.\n\nTo develop his theory Hertz used his observation of elliptical [[Newton's rings]] formed upon placing a glass sphere upon a lens as the basis of assuming that the pressure exerted by the sphere follows an [[elliptical]] distribution. He used the formation of Newton's rings again while validating his theory with experiments in calculating the [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]] which the sphere has into the lens. K. L. Johnson, K. Kendall and A. D. Roberts (JKR) used this theory as a basis while calculating the theoretical displacement or ''indentation depth'' in the presence of adhesion in 1971.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Surface energy and contact of elastic solids|year=1971 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A|volume=324|issue= 1558|pages= 301\u2013313|author1=Johnson, K.

Similar to this theory, however using different assumptions, [[Boris Derjaguin|B. V. Derjaguin]], V. M. Muller and Y. P. Toporov published another theory in 1975, which came to be known as the DMT theory in the research community, which also recovered Hertz's formulations under the assumption of zero adhesion. This DMT theory proved to be rather premature and needed several revisions before it came to be accepted as another material contact theory in addition to the JKR theory. Both the DMT and the JKR theories form the basis of contact mechanics upon which all transition contact models are based and used in material parameter prediction in [[nanoindentation]] and [[atomic force microscopy]]. So Hertz's research from his days as a lecturer, preceding his great work on electromagnetism, which he himself considered with his characteristic soberness to be trivial, has come down to the age of [[nanotechnology]].\n\n===Electromagnetic waves===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header   =\n| image1   = Hertz transmitter and receiver - English.svg\n| caption1 = Hertz's 1887 apparatus for generating and detecting radio waves: a [[spark gap transmitter|spark transmitter]] ''(left)'' consisting of a [[dipole antenna]] with a spark gap ''(S)'' powered by high voltage pulses from a [[Ruhmkorff coil]] ''(T)'', and a receiver ''(right)'' consisting of a loop antenna and spark gap.\n| width1   = 300\n| image2   = Hertz micrometer resonator.png\n| caption2 = One of Hertz's radio wave receivers: a loop antenna with an adjustable [[Spark micrometer|micrometer spark gap]] ''(bottom)''.<ref name=\"Appleyard\">{{cite journal\n  | last1  = Appleyard\n  | first1 = Rollo\n  | title = Pioneers of Electrical Communication part 5 - Heinrich Rudolph Hertz\n  | journal = Electrical Communication\n  | volume = 6\n  | issue = 2\n  | pages = 63\u201377\n  | publisher = International Standard Electric Corp.\n  | location = New York\n  | date = October 1927\n  | url = http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-ITT/20s/ITT-Vol-06-1927-02.pdf\n  | issn = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | accessdate = December 19, 2015}}The two images shown are p. 66, fig. 3 and p. 70 fig. 9</ref>\n| width2   = 131\n| footer   =\n}}\nDuring Hertz's studies in 1879 Helmholtz suggested that Hertz's doctoral dissertation be on testing [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of electromagnetism, published in 1865, which predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves moving at the [[speed of light]], and predicted that light itself was just such a wave.

Starting in November 1887 with his paper \"On Electromagnetic Effects Produced by Electrical Disturbances in Insulators\", Hertz would send a series of papers to Helmholtz at the Berlin Academy, including papers in 1888 that showed transverse [[free space]] [[electromagnetic wave]]s traveling at a finite speed over a distance.<ref name=h202/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/fraunhofer-hhi-the-institute/about-us/history-of-hhi/the-most-important-experiments.html|publisher=Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute|title= The most important Experiments - The most important Experiments and their Publication between 1886 and 1889|accessdate=2016-02-19}}</ref> In the apparatus Hertz used, the electric and magnetic fields would radiate away from the wires as [[transverse waves]].

Hertz measured Maxwell's waves and demonstrated that the [[velocity]] of these waves was equal to the velocity of light. The [[electric field intensity]], [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] and [[Reflection (electrical)|reflection]] of the waves were also measured by Hertz.

In 1887, he made observations of the photoelectric effect and of the production and reception of electromagnetic (EM) waves, published in the journal [[Annalen der Physik]]. His receiver consisted of a coil with a [[spark gap]], whereby a spark would be seen upon detection of EM waves. He placed the apparatus in a darkened box to see the spark better. He observed that the maximum spark length was reduced when in the box. A glass panel placed between the source of EM waves and the receiver absorbed UV that assisted the [[electron]]s in jumping across the gap. When removed, the spark length would increase. He observed no decrease in spark length when he substituted quartz for glass, as [[quartz]] does not absorb UV radiation. Hertz concluded his months of investigation and reported the results obtained. He did not further pursue investigation of this effect, nor did he make any attempt at explaining how the observed phenomenon was brought about.\n\nHertz did not realize the practical importance of his radio wave experiments.

Within 10 years researchers such as [[Oliver Lodge]], [[Ferdinand Braun]], and [[Guglielmo Marconi]] employed radio waves in the first [[wireless telegraphy]] [[radio communication]] systems, leading to [[radio broadcasting]], and later television. Today radio is an essential technology in global telecommunication networks, and the transmission medium underlying modern wireless devices.\n\n=== Cathode rays ===\nIn 1892, Hertz began experimenting and demonstrated that [[cathode ray]]s could penetrate very thin metal foil (such as aluminium). [[Philipp Lenard]], a student of Heinrich Hertz, further researched this \"[[X-rays|ray effect]]\". He developed a version of the cathode tube and studied the penetration by X-rays of various materials. Philipp Lenard, though, did not realize that he was producing X-rays. Hermann von Helmholtz formulated mathematical equations for X-rays. He postulated a dispersion theory before [[Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen|R\u00f6ntgen]] made his discovery and announcement. It was formed on the basis of the electromagnetic theory of light (''Wiedmann's Annalen'', Vol. XLVIII).

It is also used in the writing of other [[Jewish languages]], most notably [[Yiddish]], [[Judaeo-Spanish]], and [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]]. Historically, two separate abjad scripts have been used to write Hebrew. The original, old Hebrew script, known as the [[paleo-Hebrew alphabet]], has been largely preserved in a variant form as the [[Samaritan alphabet]]. The present \"Jewish script\" or \"square script\", on the contrary, is a stylized form of the [[Aramaic alphabet]] and was known by Jewish sages as the [[Ashuri alphabet]] (lit. \"Assyrian\"), since its origins were alleged to be from [[Assyria]].<ref>Babylonian Talmud (''Sanhedrin'' 21b\u201322a); Jerusalem Talmud (''Megillah'' 10a). Cf. [[Mishnah]] (''Megillah'' 1:8): \"The Books [of Scripture] differ from phylacteries and ''Mezuzahs'' only in that the Books may be written in any language, while phylacteries and ''Mezuzahs'' may be written '''in the Assyrian writing only'''.\"  See: ''The Mishnah'' (ed. Herbert Danby), Oxford University Press: London 1977, p. 202.</ref> Various \"styles\" (in current terms, \"[[font]]s\") of representation of the Jewish script letters described in this article also exist, including a variety of [[cursive Hebrew]] styles. In the remainder of this article, the term \"Hebrew alphabet\" refers to the square script unless otherwise indicated.\n\nThe Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters. It does not have [[letter case|case]], but five letters have different forms when used at the end of a word. Hebrew is [[Writing system#Directionality|written from right to left]]. Originally, the alphabet was an [[abjad]] consisting only of [[consonant]]s, but is now considered an \"[[impure abjad]]\". As with other abjads, such as the [[Arabic alphabet]], scribes later devised means of indicating [[vowel]] sounds by separate vowel points, known in Hebrew as ''[[niqqud]].'' In both biblical and rabbinic Hebrew, the letters [[Yodh|{{hebrew|\u05d9}}]] [[Waw (letter)|{{hebrew|\u05d5}}]] [[He (letter)|{{hebrew|\u05d4}}]] [[Aleph|{{hebrew|\u05d0}}]] can also function as ''[[mater lectionis|matres lectionis]]'', which is when certain consonants are used to indicate vowels. There is a trend in [[Modern Hebrew]] towards the use of ''matres lectionis'' to indicate vowels that have traditionally gone unwritten, a practice known as \"[[full spelling]]\".\n\nThe  [[Yiddish alphabet]], a modified version of the Hebrew alphabet used to write Yiddish, is a true alphabet, with all vowels rendered in the spelling, except in the case of inherited Hebrew words, which typically retain their Hebrew spellings.\n\nThe Arabic and Hebrew alphabets have similarities because they are both derived from the [[Aramaic alphabet]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Paleo-hebrew alphabet.jpg|300px|thumb|Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]\n[[File:Aleppo Codex Joshua 1 1.jpg|300px|thumb|The ''[[Aleppo Codex]]'', a tenth century [[Masoretic Text]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]].

Following the exile of the Kingdom of Judah in the 6th century BCE during the [[Babylonian captivity]], [[Jews]] began using a form of the Assyrian Aramaic alphabet, which was another offshoot of the same family of scripts. The [[Samaritans]], who remained in the Land of Israel, continued to use the paleo-Hebrew alphabet. During the 3rd century BCE, Jews began to use a stylized, \"square\" form of the [[Aramaic alphabet]] that was used by the [[Persian Empire]] (and which in turn had been adopted from the [[Assyria]]ns),<ref name=\"A History of the Hebrew Language\">{{cite book|year=1993 |title=A History of the Hebrew Language |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=0-521-55634-1}}</ref> while the Samaritans continued to use a form of the paleo-Hebrew script called the [[Samaritan alphabet]]. After the fall of the Persian Empire in 330 BCE, Jews used both scripts before settling on the square Assyrian form.\n\nThe square Hebrew alphabet was later adapted and used for writing languages of the [[Jewish diaspora]] \u2013 such as [[Karaim language|Karaim]], the [[Judeo-Arabic languages]], Judaeo-Spanish, and Yiddish. The Hebrew alphabet continued in use for scholarly writing in Hebrew and came again into everyday use with the rebirth of the Hebrew language as a spoken language in the 18th and 19th centuries, especially in [[Israel]].\n{{clear2|right}}\n\n==Description==\n{|cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0 style=\"float:right;margin-left:5px;width:246px\"\n|\n{|style=\"border:1px solid #b0b0b0;float:right;margin:0px\"\n|align=center|<div style=\"text-align:center;background-color:#e0e0e0;margin:3px;padding:5px;direction:rtl;line-height:1.8em;font-size:130%;\"> [[Aleph|{{hebrew|\u05d0}}]]\u2002[[Beth (letter)|{{hebrew|\u05d1}}]]\u2002[[Gimel|{{hebrew|\u05d2}}]]\u2002[[Dalet|{{hebrew|\u05d3}}]]\u2002[[He (letter)|{{hebrew|\u05d4}}]]\u2002[[Waw (letter)|{{hebrew|\u05d5}}]]\u2002[[Zayin|{{hebrew|\u05d6}}]]\u2002[[Heth|{{hebrew|\u05d7}}]]\u2002[[Teth|{{hebrew|\u05d8}}]]\u2002[[Yodh|{{hebrew|\u05d9}}]]<br/>[[Kaph|{{hebrew|\u05db}}]]\u2002[[Kaph|{{hebrew|\u05da}}]]\u2002[[Lamedh|{{hebrew|\u05dc}}]]\u2002[[Mem|{{hebrew|\u05de}}]]\u2002[[Mem|{{hebrew|\u05dd}}]]\u2002[[Nun (letter)|{{hebrew|\u05e0}}]]\u2002[[Nun (letter)|{{hebrew|\u05df}}]]\u2002[[Samekh|{{hebrew|\u05e1}}]]\u2002[[Ayin|{{hebrew|\u05e2}}]]\u2002[[Pe (letter)|{{hebrew|\u05e4}}]]<br/>[[Pe (letter)|{{hebrew|\u05e3}}]]\u2002[[Tsade|{{hebrew|\u05e6}}]]\u2002[[Tsade|{{hebrew|\u05e5}}]]\u2002[[Qoph|{{hebrew|\u05e7}}]]\u2002[[Resh|{{hebrew|\u05e8}}]]\u2002[[Shin (letter)|{{hebrew|\u05e9}}]]\u2002[[Taw|{{hebrew|\u05ea}}]]\u2002{{\u2022}}\u2002[[\ufb4f|{{hebrew|\ufb4f}}]]</div>\n|-\n|\n{|cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 style=\"font-size:80%;margin-left:3px;margin-right:3px;margin-bottom:3px;padding:1px;line-height:130%;border-style:none\"\n|valign=top|Features: ||[[Abjad]]{{\u2022}}[[Mater lectionis]]{{\u2022}}[[Begadkefat]]\n|- style=\"background-color:#e0e0e0\"\n|valign=top|Variants: ||[[Cursive Hebrew|Cursive]]{{\u2022}}[[Rashi script|Rashi]]{{\u2022}}[[Solitreo]]{{\u2022}}[[Hebrew braille|Braille]]\n|-\n|valign=top|Numerals: ||[[Gematria]]{{\u2022}}[[Hebrew numerals|Numeration]]\n|- style=\"background-color:#e0e0e0\"\n|valign=top|Ancillaries: ||[[Hebrew diacritics|Diacritics]]{{\u2022}}[[Hebrew punctuation|Punctuation]]{{\u2022}}[[Cantillation]]\n|-\n|valign=top|Translit.: ||[[Romanization of Hebrew]]{{\u2022}}[[Hebraization of English]]{{\u2022}}[[Help:IPA/Hebrew|IPA]]{{\u2022}}[[ISO 259|ISO]]\n|- style=\"background-color:#e0e0e0\"\n|valign=top|Computers: ||[[Hebrew keyboard|Keyboard]]{{\u2022}}[[Unicode and HTML for the Hebrew alphabet|Unicode and HTML]]\n|}\n|}\n|}\n\n===General===\nIn the traditional form, the Hebrew alphabet is an [[abjad]] consisting only of [[consonant]]s, [[Writing system#Directionality|written from right to left]]. It has 22 letters, five of which use different forms at the end of a word.\n\n===Vowels===\n\nIn the traditional form, vowels are indicated by the weak [[consonant]]s [[Aleph]] ({{hebrew|\u05d0}}), [[He (letter)|He]] ({{hebrew|\u05d4}}), [[Waw (letter)|Vav]] ({{hebrew|\u05d5}}), or  [[Yodh]] ({{hebrew|\u05d9}}) serving as vowel letters, or [[Mater lectionis|''matres lectionis'']]: the letter is combined with a previous vowel and becomes silent, or by imitation of such cases in the spelling of other forms. Also, a system of vowel points to indicate vowels (diacritics), called [[niqqud]], was developed. In modern forms of the alphabet, as in the case of [[Yiddish]] and to some extent [[Modern Hebrew]], [[vowel]]s may be indicated. Today, the trend is toward [[Ktiv hasar niqqud|full spelling]] with the weak letters acting as true vowels.\n\nWhen used to [[Yiddish orthography|write Yiddish]], vowels are indicated, using certain letters, either with niqqud diacritics (e.g. {{Script/Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b8}} or {{Script/Hebrew|\u05d9\u05b4}}) or without (e.g. {{Script/Hebrew|\u05e2}} or {{Script/Hebrew|\u05d9}}), except for Hebrew words, which in Yiddish are written in their Hebrew spelling.\n\nTo preserve the proper vowel sounds, scholars developed several different sets of vocalization and diacritical symbols called ''nequdot'' ({{hebrew|\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea}}, literally \"points\"). One of these, the [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian system]], eventually prevailed. [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]], and his family for several generations, are credited for refining and maintaining the system. These points are normally used only for special purposes, such as [[Bible|Biblical]] books intended for study, in [[poetry]] or when teaching the language to children.  The Tiberian system also includes a set of [[cantillation]] marks, called \"[[Trope (religion)|trope]]\", used to indicate how scriptural passages should be chanted in synagogue recitations of scripture (although these marks do not appear in the scrolls). In everyday writing of modern Hebrew, ''niqqud'' are absent; however, patterns of how words are derived from [[Semitic root|Hebrew roots]] (called ''shorashim'' or \"triliterals\") allow Hebrew speakers to determine the vowel-structure of a given word from its consonants based on the word's context and part of speech.\n\n===Alphabet===\n\nUnlike the Paleo-Hebrew writing script, the modern Ashuri script has five [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] that have special [[final form]]s,{{ref label|Pronunciation_in_Different_Word_Positions|c|}} called '''sofit''' ({{lang-he|\u05e1\u05d5\u05e4\u05d9\u05ea}}, meaning in this context \"final\" or \"ending\") form, used only at the end of a word, somewhat as in the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] or in the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Mandaic alphabet]]s.{{ref label|Variants_in_Arabic_Mandaic|b|}} These are shown below the normal form in the following table (letter names are [[List of Unicode characters#Hebrew|Unicode]] standard<ref name=\"unicode_names_of_hebrew_glyphs_at_unicode.org\">[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0590.pdf Chart of Hebrew glyphs at unicode.org]</ref><ref name=\"unicode_names_of_hebrew_glyphs_at_fileformat.info\">[https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/hebrew/list.htm Unicode names of Hebrew characters at fileformat.info].</ref>).

The six consonants {{IPA|/b \u0261 d k p t/}} were pronounced differently depending on their position. These letters were also called ''[[Begadkefat|BeGeD KeFeT]]'' letters {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|b|e\u026a|\u0261|\u025b|d|\u02c8|k|\u025b|f|\u025b|t}}. The full details are very complex; this summary omits some points. They were pronounced as [[plosive]]s {{IPA|/b \u0261 d k p t/}} at the beginning of a syllable, or when doubled. They were pronounced as [[fricative]]s {{IPA|/v \u0263 \u00f0 x f \u03b8/}} when preceded by a vowel (commonly indicated with a macron, \u1e07 \u1e21 \u1e0f \u1e35 p\u0304 \u1e6f). The plosive and double pronunciations were indicated by the ''dagesh''. In Modern Hebrew the sounds \u1e0f and \u1e21 have reverted to {{IPA|[d]}} and {{IPA|[\u0261]}}, respectively, and \u1e6f has become {{IPA|[t]}}, so only the remaining three consonants {{IPA|/b k p/}} show variation. {{hebrew|\u05e8}} ''resh'' may have also been a \"doubled\" letter, making the list ''BeGeD KePoReT''. ([[Sefer Yetzirah]], 4:1)\n\n*{{hebrew|\u05d7}} ''chet'' and {{hebrew|\u05e2}} ''ayin'' represented [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], {{hebrew|\u05e6}} ''tsadi'' represented the [[emphatic consonant]] {{IPA|/s\u02e4/}}, {{hebrew|\u05d8}} ''tet'' represented the emphatic consonant {{IPA|/t\u02e4/}}, and {{hebrew|\u05e7}} ''qof'' represented the [[uvular consonant|uvular plosive]] {{IPA|/q/}}. All these are common [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[consonant]]s.\n*{{hebrew|\u05e9\u05c2}} ''sin'' (the {{IPA|/s/}} variant of {{hebrew|\u05e9}} ''shin'') was originally different from both {{hebrew|\u05e9\u05c1}} ''shin'' and {{hebrew|\u05e1}} ''samekh'', but had become {{IPA|/s/}} the same as {{hebrew|\u05e1}} ''samekh'' by the time the vowel pointing was devised. Because of [[cognate]]s with other [[Semitic language]]s, this phoneme is known to have originally been a [[lateral consonant]], most likely the [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] {{IPA|/\u026c/}} (the sound of modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''ll'') or the [[voiceless alveolar lateral affricate]] {{IPA|/t\u026c/}} (like [[N\u00e1huatl]] ''tl'').\n\n====Regional and historical variation====\n\nThe following table contains the [[pronunciation]] of the Hebrew letters in reconstructed historical forms and [[dialect]]s using the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]]. The apostrophe-looking symbol after some letters is not a [[Yodh|yud]] but a [[geresh]]. It is used for loanwords with non-native Hebrew sounds. The dot in the middle of some of the letters, called a \"[[dagesh]] kal\", also modifies the sounds of the letters <span style=\"unicode-bidi:bidi-override;\">[[\u05d1]], [[\u05db]] and [[\u05e4]]</span> in [[modern Hebrew]] (in some forms of Hebrew it modifies also the sounds of the letters <span style=\"unicode-bidi:bidi-override;\">[[\u05d2]], [[\u05d3]] and/or [[\u05ea]];</span> the \"dagesh chazak\" \u2013 orthographically indistinguishable from the \"dagesh kal\" \u2013 designates [[gemination]], which today is realized only rarely \u2013 e.g. in biblical recitations or when using [[Arabic]] [[loanword]]s).\n:{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Symbol\n! colspan=\"9\" ! | [[help:IPA|Pronunciation]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" ! | [[Israeli Hebrew|Israeli]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" ! | [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" ! | [[Sephardi Hebrew language|Sephardi]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" ! | [[Yemenite Hebrew language|Yemenite]]\n! colspan=\"3\" ! | Reconstructed\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Arabic equivalent\n|-\n!

Nowadays alphanumeric notation is used only in specific contexts, e.g. denoting dates in the [[Hebrew calendar]], denoting grades of school in Israel, other listings (e.g. \u05e9\u05dc\u05d1 \u05d0\u05f3, \u05e9\u05dc\u05d1 \u05d1\u05f3 \u2013 \"phase a, phase b\"), commonly in [[Kabbalah]] ([[Judaism|Jewish]] [[mysticism]]) in a practice known as [[gematria]], and often in religious contexts.\n\n[[File:Hohe Synagoge Prag 1.jpg|thumb|260px| The lower clock on the [[Jewish Town Hall (Prague)|Jewish Town Hall]] building in [[Prague]], with Hebrew numerals in counterclockwise order.]]\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!<small>letter</small>!!<small>numeric value</small>\n!<small>letter</small>!!<small>numeric value</small>\n!<small>letter</small>!!<small>numeric value</small>\n|-\n|<big>'''\u05d0'''</big>||1||'''<big>\u05d9</big>'''||10||'''<big>\u05e7</big>'''||100\n|-\n|<big>'''\u05d1'''</big>||2||'''<big>\u05db</big>'''||20||'''<big>\u05e8</big>'''||200\n|-\n|<big>'''\u05d2'''</big>||3||'''<big>\u05dc</big>'''||30||'''<big>\u05e9</big>'''||300\n|-\n|<big>'''\u05d3'''</big>||4||'''<big>\u05de</big>'''||40||'''<big>\u05ea</big>'''||400\n|-\n|<big>'''\u05d4'''</big>||5||'''<big>\u05e0</big>'''||50\n|-\n|<big>'''\u05d5'''</big>||6||'''<big>\u05e1</big>'''||60\n|-\n|<big>'''\u05d6'''</big>||7||'''<big>\u05e2</big>'''||70\n|-\n|<big>'''\u05d7'''</big>||8||'''<big>\u05e4</big>'''||80\n|-\n|<big>'''\u05d8'''</big>||9||'''<big>\u05e6</big>'''||90\n|}\n\nThe numbers 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900 are commonly represented by the juxtapositions <span style=\"unicode-bidi:bidi-override; text-direction:ltr;\">\u05e7\u05f4\u05ea, \u05e8\u05f4\u05ea, \u05e9\u05f4\u05ea, \u05ea\u05f4\u05ea, and \u05e7\u05f4\u05ea\u05ea</span> respectively.\nAdding a [[geresh]] (\"\u05f3\") to a letter multiplies its value by one thousand, for example, the year 5778 is portrayed as \u05d4\u05f3\u05ea\u05e9\u05e2\u05f4\u05d7, where \u05d4 represents 5000, and \u05ea\u05e9\u05e2\u05f4\u05d7 represents 778.\n\n==Transliterations and transcriptions==\n{{Main|Romanization of Hebrew|Biblical Hebrew|Biblical Hebrew orthography|Yiddish|Yiddish orthography}}\n\nThe following table lists transliterations and transcriptions of Hebrew letters used in [[Modern Hebrew]].\n\nClarifications:\n*For some letters, the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] offers a ''precise'' transliteration that differs from the ''regular'' standard it has set.

final \u05e2 (in regular transliteration), silent or initial \u05d0, and silent \u05d4 are ''not'' transliterated. To the eye of readers orientating themselves on Latin (or similar) alphabets, these letters might seem to be transliterated as vowel letters; however, these are in fact transliterations of the vowel diacritics \u2013 niqqud (or are representations of the spoken vowels). E.g., in \u05d0\u05b4\u05dd (\"if\", {{IPA|[\u0294im]}}), \u05d0\u05b5\u05dd (\"mother\", {{IPA|[\u0294e\u031em]}}) and \u05d0\u05b9\u05dd (\"[[nut (hardware)|nut]]\", {{IPA|[\u0294o\u031em]}}), the letter \u05d0 always represents the same consonant: {{IPAblink|\u0294}} ([[glottal stop]]), whereas the vowels /i/, /e/ and /o/ respectively represent the spoken vowel, whether it is orthographically denoted by diacritics or not. Since the Academy of the Hebrew Language ascertains that \u05d0 in initial position is not transliterated, the symbol for the glottal stop &nbsp;<big>\u02be</big>&nbsp; is omitted from the transliteration, and only the subsequent vowels are transliterated (whether or not their corresponding vowel diacritics appeared in the text being transliterated), resulting in \"im\", \"em\" and \"om\", respectively.\n\n{{note label|geresh_B1_eg|}}{{note label|geresh_B2_eg|}}{{note label|geresh_B3_eg|}}<sup>'''B'''1{{note|geresh_B1}}2{{note|geresh_B2}}3{{note|geresh_B3}}</sup>The [[diacritic]] [[geresh]] \u2013 \"\u05f3\" \u2013 is used with some other letters as well (\u05d3\u05f3, \u05d7\u05f3, \u05d8\u05f3, \u05e2\u05f3, \u05e8\u05f3, \u05ea\u05f3), but only to transliterate ''from'' other languages ''to'' Hebrew \u2013 never to spell Hebrew words; therefore they were not included in this table (correctly translating a Hebrew text with these letters would require using the spelling in the language from which the transliteration to Hebrew was originally made). The non-standard \"\u05d5\u05f3\" and \"\u05d5\u05d5\" {{ref label|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_1|e1|}} are sometimes used to represent {{IPAslink|w}}, which like {{IPAslink|d\u0361\u0292}}, {{IPAslink|\u0292}} and {{IPAslink|t\u0361\u0283}} appears in Hebrew slang and loanwords.\n\n{{note label|ch_C1_eg|}}{{note label|ch_C2_eg|}}<sup>'''C'''1{{note|ch_C1}}2{{note|ch_C2}}</sup>The Sound {{IPAslink|\u03c7}} (as \"ch\" in [[loch]]) is often transcribed \"ch\", inconsistently with the guidelines specified by the Academy of the Hebrew Language: \u05d7\u05dd {{IPA|/\u03c7am/}} \u2192 \"cham\"; \u05e1\u05db\u05da {{IPA|/s\u03c7a\u03c7/}} \u2192 \"schach\".\n\n{{note label|final_pe_D_eg|}}<sup>'''D'''{{note|final_pe_D}}</sup>Although the Bible does include a single occurrence of a final pe with a dagesh ([[Book of Proverbs]] 30, 6: \"{{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b7\u05dc-\u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e1\u05b0\u05e3\u05b0\u05bc \u05e2\u05b7\u05dc-\u05d3\u05b0\u05bc\u05d1\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05d9\u05d5: \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05df-\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05db\u05b4\u05d9\u05d7\u05b7 \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05da\u05b8 \u05d5\u05b0\u05e0\u05b4\u05db\u05b0\u05d6\u05b8\u05d1\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05bc.}}\"), in modern Hebrew {{IPAslink|p}} is always represented by [[Pe (letter)|pe]] in its regular, not final, form \"\u05e4\", even when in final word position, which occurs with loanwords (e.g. \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05b9\u05e4\u05bc {{IPA|/\u0283op/}} ''\"shop\"''), foreign names (e.g. \u05e4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05e4\u05bc {{IPA|/\u02c8filip/}} ''\"Philip\"'') and some slang (e.g. \u05d7\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05e4\u05bc {{IPA|/\u03c7a\u02c8rap/}} ''\"slept deeply\"'').\n\n==Religious use==\nThe letters of the Hebrew alphabet have played varied roles in Jewish religious literature over the centuries, primarily in mystical texts. Some sources in classical [[rabbinical literature]] seem to acknowledge the historical provenance of the currently used Hebrew alphabet and deal with them as a mundane subject (the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], for example, records that \"the Israelites took for themselves square calligraphy\", and that the letters \"came with the Israelites from Ashur [Assyria]\");<ref>Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin 21b</ref> others attribute mystical significance to the letters, connecting them with the process of creation or [[Jewish messianism|the redemption]]. In mystical conceptions, the alphabet is considered eternal, pre-existent to the Earth, and the letters themselves are seen as having holiness and power, sometimes to such an extent that several stories from the [[Talmud]] illustrate the idea that they cannot be destroyed.<ref>Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Pesach 87b, Avodah Zarah 18a.</ref>\n\nThe idea of the letters' creative power finds its greatest vehicle in the [[Sefer Yezirah]], or ''Book of Creation'', a mystical text of uncertain origin which describes a story of creation highly divergent from that in the [[Book of Genesis]], largely through exposition on the powers of the letters of the alphabet. The supposed creative powers of the letters are also referenced in the Talmud and [[Zohar]].<ref>Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Berachot 55c</ref><ref>Zohar 1:3; 2:152</ref>\n\n[[File:Tefillin.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The four-pronged [[Shin (letter)|Shin]]]]\nAnother book, the 13th-century [[Kabbalistic]] text [[Sefer HaTemunah]], holds that a single letter of unknown pronunciation, held by some to be the four-pronged shin on one side of the [[teffilin]] box, is missing from the current alphabet. The world's flaws, the book teaches, are related to the absence of this letter, the eventual revelation of which will [[Tikkun Olam|repair the universe]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''The Book of Letters''. Woodstock, Vermont: Jewish Lights Publishing, Woodstock. 1990</ref> Another example of messianic significance attached to the letters is the teaching of Rabbi Eliezer that the five letters of the alphabet with final forms hold the \"secret of redemption\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn addition, the letters occasionally feature in [[aggadic]] portions of non-mystical rabbinic literature. In such aggada the letters are often given [[anthropomorphic]] qualities and depicted as speaking to God. Commonly their shapes are used in parables to illustrate points of ethics or theology. An example from the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (a parable intended to discourage speculation about the universe before creation):\n\n{{quote box\n| align = center\n| width = 50%\n| quote = ''Why does the story of creation begin with bet?... In the same manner that the letter bet is closed on all sides and only open in front, similarly you are not permitted to inquire into what is before or what was behind, but only from the actual time of Creation.''\n| source = Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Hagigah, 77c\n}}\n\nExtensive instructions about the proper methods of forming the letters are found in Mishnat Soferim, within [[Mishna Berura]] of [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]].\n\n==Mathematical use==\nSee [[aleph number]] and [[beth number]] and [[gimel function]].\n\nIn [[set theory]], <math>\\aleph_0</math>, pronounced aleph-naught or aleph-zero, is used to mark the [[cardinal number]] of an infinite [[countable set]], such as <math>\\mathbb Z</math>, the set of all integers. More generally, the <math>\\aleph_\\alpha</math> (aleph) notation marks the ordered sequence of all distinct infinite cardinal numbers.\n\nLess frequently used, the <math>\\beth_\\alpha</math> (beth) notation is used for the iterated [[power set]]s of <math>\\aleph_0</math>. The 2nd element <math>\\beth_1</math> is the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. Very occasionally, gimel is used in cardinal notation.\n\n==Unicode and HTML==\n[[File:Hebrew keyboard layout.png|thumb|An example of a Hebrew keyboard.]]\n{{main|Unicode and HTML for the Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew keyboard}}\nThe [[Unicode]] Hebrew block extends from U+0590 to U+05FF and from U+FB1D to U+FB4F. It includes [[letter (alphabet)|letters]], [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], [[combining diacritical mark]]s (''[[Niqqud]]'' and [[cantillation]] marks) and [[punctuation]].<ref name=\"unicode_names_of_hebrew_glyphs_at_unicode.org\" /> The [[Numeric character reference|Numeric Character References]] is included for HTML. These can be used in many markup languages, and they are often used in Wiki to create the Hebrew [[glyphs]] compatible with the majority of web browsers.\n\nStandard Hebrew keyboards have a 101-key layout.

In Modern Hebrew this restriction is not absolute, e.g. \u05e4\u05b4\u05d9\u05d6\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7\u05b7\u05d0\u05d9 {{IPA|/fizi\u02c8kaj/}} and never {{IPA|/pizi\u02c8kaj/}} (= \"physicist\"), \u05e1\u05b0\u05e0\u05d5\u05b9\u05d1\u05bc {{IPA|/snob/}} and never {{IPA|/snov/}} (= \"snob\").

In [[Modern Hebrew]] [[orthography]], the sound {{IPAblink|p}} at the end of a word is denoted by the regular form \"\u05e4\", as opposed to the final form \"\u05e3\", which always denotes {{IPAblink|f}} (see [[#Transliterations and transcriptions|table of transliterations and transcriptions]], comment{{ref label|final_pe_D_eg|D|}}).\n\n<sup>d{{note|Double_Vav_as_Ligature_or_as_Separate_Letters}}</sup>However, \u05d5\u05d5 (two separate vavs), used in [[Ktiv hasar niqqud|Ktiv male]], is to be distinguished from the ''Yiddish ligature'' \u05f0 (also two vavs but together as one character).\n\n<sup>e1{{note|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_1}}e2{{note|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_2}}e3{{note|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_3}}e4{{note|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_4}}e5{{note|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_5}}</sup>The Academy of the Hebrew Language states that both {{IPAblink|v}} and {{IPAblink|w}} be indistinguishably represented in Hebrew using the letter Vav.<ref name=\"trans-into-heb taatiq2007\">{{cite web|url=http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/hahlatot/TheTranscription/Documents/taatiq2007.pdf |format=PDF |title=Transliteration Rules |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703210016/http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/hahlatot/TheTranscription/Documents/taatiq2007.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-03 |df= }} issued by the Academy of the Hebrew Language.</ref> Sometimes the Vav is indeed doubled, however not to denote {{IPA|[w]}} as opposed to {{IPA|[v]}} but rather, when [[Ktiv hasar niqqud|spelling without niqqud]], to denote the [[phoneme]] /v/ at a non-initial and non-final position in the word, whereas a single Vav at a non-initial and non-final position in the word in spelling without niqqud denotes one of the [[phoneme]]s /u/ or /o/.

Gray went to Venice, leaving Walpole at Reggio.<ref name=Ketton-Cremer/>{{rp|72\u201373}} In later life Walpole admitted that the fault lay primarily with himself: \n<blockquote>I was too young, too fond of my own diversions, nay, I do not doubt, too much intoxicated by indulgence, vanity, and the insolence of my situation, as a Prime Minister's son, not to have been inattentive and insensible to the feelings of one I thought below me; of one, I blush to say it, that I knew was obliged to me; of one whom presumption and folly perhaps made me deem not my superior ''then'' in parts, though I have since felt my infinite inferiority to him.<ref name=Ketton-Cremer/>{{rp|71}}</blockquote>\n\nWalpole then visited [[Venice]], [[Genoa]], [[Antibes]], [[Toulon]], [[Marseilles]], Aix, [[Montpellier]], [[Toulouse]], [[Orl\u00e9ans]] and Paris.

He held this seat for thirteen years, although he never visited Callington.<ref name=Ketton-Cremer/>{{rp|80}} Walpole entered Parliament shortly before his father's fall from power: in December 1741 the Opposition won its first majority vote in the Commons for twenty years. In January 1742 Walpole's government was still struggling in Parliament although by the end of the month Horace and other family members had successfully urged the Prime Minister to resign after a parliamentary defeat.<ref name=Ketton-Cremer/>{{rp|82}}\n\nWalpole's philosophy mirrored that of Edmund Burke, who was his contemporary.

For the next three years Walpole spent most of his time with his father at his country house [[Houghton Hall]] in Norfolk.<ref name=Ketton-Cremer/>{{rp|84}} His father died in 1745 and left Walpole the remainder of the lease of his house in [[Arlington Street]], London; \u00a35,000 in cash; and the office of Collector of the Customs (worth \u00a31,000 per annum). However he had died in debt, the total of which was in between \u00a340,000 and \u00a350,000.<ref name=Ketton-Cremer/>{{rp|97}}\n\nIn late 1745 Walpole and [[Thomas Gray|Gray]] resumed their friendship.<ref name=Ketton-Cremer/>{{rp|100\u2013101}} Also that year the [[Jacobite Rising of 1745|Jacobite Rising]] began. The position of Walpole was the fruit of his father's support for the Hanoverian dynasty and he knew he was in danger, saying: \"Now comes the [[Charles Edward Stuart|Pretender's boy]], and promises all my comfortable apartments in the Exchequer and Custom House to some forlorn Irish peer, who chooses to remove his pride and poverty out of some large old unfurnished gallery at St. Germain's. Why really, Mr. Montagu, this is not pleasant!

At his home he hung a copy of the warrant for the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] with the inscription \"Major Charta\" and wrote of \"the least bad of all murders, that of a King\".<ref name=Ketton-Cremer/>{{rp|126\u2013127}} In 1756 he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I am sensible that from the prostitution of patriotism, from the art of ministers who have had the address to exalt the semblance while they depressed the reality of royalty, and from the bent of the education of the young nobility, which verges to French maxims and to a military spirit, nay, from the ascendant which the nobility itself acquires each day in this country, from all these reflections, I am sensible, that prerogative and power have been exceedingly fortified of late within the circle of the palace; and though fluctuating ministers by turns exercise the deposit, yet there it is; and whenever a prince of design and spirit shall sit in the regal chair, he will find a bank, a hoard of power, which he may lay off most fatally against this constitution. [I am] a quiet republican, who does not dislike to see the shadow of monarchy, like [[Banquo]]'s ghost, fill the empty chair of state, that the ambitious, the murderer, the tyrant, may not aspire to it; in short, who approves the name of a King, when it excludes the essence.<ref name=Ketton-Cremer/>{{rp|127}}</blockquote>\n\nWalpole was worried that while his fellow [[Whig Party (UK)|Whigs]] fought amongst themselves [[Tory Party|the Tories]] were gaining power, the end result of which would be England delivered to an unlimited, absolute monarchy, \"that authority, that torrent which I should in vain extend a feeble arm to stem\".<ref name=Ketton-Cremer/>{{rp|127}}\n\nIn 1757 he wrote the anonymous pamphlet, '' A Letter from Xo Ho, a Chinese Philosopher at London, to his Friend Lien Chi at Peking'', the first of his works to be widely reviewed.<ref name=\"Sabor2013\">{{Cite book|author=Peter Sabor|title=Horace Walpole: The Critical Heritage|date=31 October 2013|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-136-17217-5|page=4}}</ref>\n\nEarly in 1757 old Horace Walpole of Wolterton died and was succeeded in the peerage by his son, who was then an MP for [[King's Lynn (UK Parliament constituency)|King's Lynn]], thereby creating a vacancy. The electors of King's Lynn did not wish to be represented by a stranger and instead wanted someone with a connection to the Walpole family. The new Lord Walpole therefore wrote to his cousin requesting that he stand for the seat, saying his friends \"were all unanimously of opinion that you were the only person who from your near affinity to my grandfather, whose name is still in the greatest veneration, and your own known personal abilities and qualifications, could stand in the gap on this occasion and prevent opposition and expence and perhaps disgrace to the family\".<ref name=Ketton-Cremer/>{{rp|200}} In early 1757 Walpole was out of Parliament after vacating Castle Rising until his election that year to King's Lynn, a seat he would hold until his retirement from the Commons in 1768.<ref name=Ketton-Cremer/>{{rp|201}}\n\nWalpole was a prominent opponent of the decision to execute [[John Byng|Admiral Byng]].<ref name=Ketton-Cremer/>{{rp|201}}\n\n==Later life: 1768\u20131788==\n\nWithout a seat in Parliament, Walpole recognised his limitations as to political influence. He opposed the recent [[Catholic Emancipation|Catholic accommodative measures]], writing to Mann in 1784: \"You know I have ever been averse to toleration of an intolerant religion\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> He wrote to Mann in 1785 that \"as there are continually allusions to parliamentary speeches and events, they are often obscure to me till I get them explained; and besides, I do not know several of the satirized heroes even by sight\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> His political sympathies were with the [[Foxite]] Whigs, the successors of the Rockingham Whigs, who were themselves the successors of the Whig Party as revived by Walpole's father. He wrote to [[William Mason (poet)|William Mason]], expounding his political philosophy:\n\n<blockquote>I have for five and forty years acted upon the principles of the constitution as it was settled at the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution]], the best form of government that I know of in the world, and which made us a free people, a rich people, and a victorious people, by diffusing liberty, protecting property and encouraging commerce; and by the combination of all, empowering us to resist the ambition of the [[House of Bourbon]], and to place ourselves on a level with that formidable neighbour. The narrow plan of [[British monarchy|royalty]], which had so often preferred the aggrandizement of the Crown to the dignity of presiding over a great and [[wikt:puissant|puissant]] free kingdom, threw away one predominant source of our potency by [[mercantilism|aspiring to enslave America]]\u2014and would now compensate for that [[American Revolutionary War|blunder and its consequence]] by assuming a despotic tone at home. It has found a tool in the light and juvenile son of the great minister who carried our glory to its highest pitch\u2014but it shall never have the insignificant approbation of an old and worn out son of another minister, who though less brilliant, maintained this country in the enjoyment of the twenty happiest years that England ever enjoyed.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Last years: 1788\u20131797==\n[[File:Oldhorry.jpg|thumb|left|Horace Walpole by [[Sir Thomas Lawrence]], ''circa'' 1795]]\nWalpole was horrified by the [[French Revolution]] and commended [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'': \"Every page shows how sincerely he is in earnest\u2014a wondrous merit in a political pamphlet\u2014All other party writers ''act'' zeal for the public, but it never seems to flow from the heart\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> He admired the purple passage in the book on [[Marie Antoinette]]: \"I know the tirade on the Queen of France is condemned and yet I must avow I admire it much. It paints her exactly as she appeared to me the first time I saw her when Dauphiness. She...shot through the room like an aerial being, all brightness and grace and without seeming to touch earth\".<ref>F. P.

''Savages'', ''barbarians'', &c., were terms for poor ignorant Indians and Blacks and Hyaenas, or, with some superlative epithets, for Spaniards in Peru and Mexico, for Inquisitors, or for Enthusiasts of every breed in religious wars. It remained for the enlightened eighteenth century to baffle language and invent horrors that can be found in no vocabulary. What tongue could be prepared to paint a Nation that should avow Atheism, profess Assassination, and practice Massacres on Massacres for four years together: and who, as if they had destroyed God as well as their King, and established Incredulity by law, give no symptoms of repentance!

P. Lock, ''Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France'' (London: George Allen & Unwin, 1985), p. 159.</ref>\n\nHis father was created [[Earl of Orford]] in 1742. Horace's elder brother, the [[Robert Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford|2nd Earl of Orford]] (c.1701\u20131751), passed the title on to his son, the [[George Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford|3rd Earl of Orford]] (1730\u20131791). When the 3rd Earl died unmarried, Horace Walpole became the 4th Earl of Orford, and the title died with him in 1797. The massive amount of correspondence he left behind had been published in many volumes, starting in 1798. Likewise, a large collection of his works, including historical writings, was published immediately after his death.<ref name=\"Legouis p. 906\"/>\n\n==Writings==\nStrawberry Hill had its own [[printing press]], the [[Strawberry Hill Press]], which supported Horace Walpole's intensive literary activity.<ref>Verberckmoes, p.77</ref>\n\nIn 1764, not using his own press, he anonymously published his [[Gothic novel]], ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', claiming on its title page that it was a translation \"from the Original Italian of Onuphirio Muralto\". The second edition's preface, according to James Watt, \"has often been regarded as a manifesto for the modern Gothic romance, stating that his work, now subtitled 'A Gothic Story', sought to restore the qualities of imagination and invention to contemporary fiction\".<ref>Watt 2004 p. 120</ref> However, there is a playfulness in the prefaces to both editions and in the narration within the text itself. The novel opens with the son of Manfred (the Prince of Otranto) being crushed under a massive helmet that appears as a result of supernatural causes. However, that moment, along with the rest of the unfolding plot, includes a mixture of both ridiculous and sublime supernatural elements. The plot finally reveals how Manfred's family is tainted in a way that served as a model for successive Gothic plots.<ref>Watt 2004 p. 120\u2013121</ref>\n\nFrom 1762 on, Walpole published his ''Anecdotes of Painting in England'', based on [[George Vertue]]'s manuscript notes. His memoirs of the Georgian social and political scene, though heavily biased, are a useful primary source for historians.\n\n[[File:George Montagu Eccardt Peterborough.JPG|thumb|upright|Portrait of ''George Montagu'' by [[John Giles Eccardt]] after [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo]] (''c''. 1713\u20131780)<br/>Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery<br/>A close friend and correspondent of Horace Walpole]]\n\nSmith, noting that Walpole never did any work for his well-paid government sinecures, turns to the letters and argues that: \n:Walpole served his country, not by drudgery in the Exchequer and Customs, which paid him, but by transmitting to posterity an incomparable vision of England as it was in his day \u2013 London and Westminster with all their festivities and riots, the machinations of politicians and the turmoil of elections.<ref>Smith, p. 25.</ref>\n\nWalpole's numerous letters are often used as a historical resource.

In this he has been followed by other writers, such as [[The Daughter of Time|Josephine Tey]] and [[Valerie Anand]]. This work, according to Emile Legouis, shows that Walpole was \"capable of critical initiative\".<ref name=\"Legouis p. 906\">Legouis 1957 p. 906</ref> However, Walpole later changed his views following [[The Terror]] and declared that Richard could have committed the crimes he was accused of.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Walpole|first1=Horace|title=Historic Doubts on the life and Reign of Richard III, edited with an introduction by Philip Hammond|origyear=1793|year=1987|location=Gloucester|page=223}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Pollard|first1=A.

The [[Samaritan Hebrew|Samaritan dialect]] is also the liturgical tongue of the [[Samaritans]], while modern Hebrew or Arabic is their vernacular. As a foreign language, it is studied mostly by [[Jews]] and students of Judaism and Israel, and by [[Archaeology of Israel|archaeologists]] and linguists specializing in the [[Middle East]] and its civilizations, as well as by theologians in Christian seminaries.\n\nThe [[Torah]] (the first five books), and most of the rest of the [[Hebrew Bible]], is written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with much of its present form specifically in the dialect that scholars believe flourished around the 6th century BCE, around the time of the [[Babylonian captivity]].

The dialects organize into Mishnaic Hebrew (also called [[Tannaim|Tannaitic]] Hebrew, Early Rabbinic Hebrew, or [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] Hebrew I), which was a [[spoken language]], and [[Amoraim|Amoraic]] Hebrew (also called Late Rabbinic Hebrew or Mishnaic Hebrew II), which was a [[literary language]]. The earlier section of the Talmud is the [[Mishnah]] that was published around 200 CE, although many of the stories take place much earlier, and was written in the earlier Mishnaic dialect. The dialect is also found in certain Dead Sea Scrolls. Mishnaic Hebrew is considered to be one of the dialects of Classical Hebrew that functioned as a living language in the land of Israel. A transitional form of the language occurs in the other works of Tannaitic literature dating from the century beginning with the completion of the Mishnah. These include the [[Midrash halakha|halachic]] [[Midrash]]im ([[Sifra]], [[Sifre]], [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mechilta]] etc.) and the expanded collection of Mishnah-related material known as the [[Tosefta]]. The Talmud contains excerpts from these works, as well as further Tannaitic material not attested elsewhere; the generic term for these passages is ''[[Baraita|Baraitot]]''. The dialect of all these works is very similar to Mishnaic Hebrew.\n\nAbout a century after the publication of the Mishnah, Mishnaic Hebrew fell into disuse as a spoken language. The later section of the Talmud, the [[Gemara]], generally comments on the Mishnah and Baraitot in two forms of Aramaic. Nevertheless, Hebrew survived as a liturgical and literary language in the form of later [[Amoraim|Amoraic]] Hebrew, which sometimes occurs in the text of the Gemara.\n\nBecause as early as the Torah's transcription the Scribe has been the highest position in Judaism, Hebrew was always regarded as the language of Israel's religion, history and national pride, and after it faded as a spoken language, it continued to be used as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' among scholars and Jews traveling in foreign countries.<ref>[http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/august/Hebrew.html Languages of the World (Hebrew)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117194849/http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/august/Hebrew.html |date=17 January 2009 }}</ref> After the 2nd century CE when the [[Roman Empire]] exiled most of the Jewish population of Jerusalem following the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], they adapted to the societies in which they found themselves, yet letters, contracts, commerce, science, philosophy, medicine, poetry, and laws continued to be written mostly in Hebrew, which adapted by borrowing and inventing terms.\n\n=== Medieval Hebrew ===\n{{Main|Medieval Hebrew}}\n[[File:Aleppo Codex Joshua 1 1.jpg|thumb|[[Aleppo Codex]]: 10th century [[Hebrew Bible]] with [[Masoretes|Masoretic]] pointing (Joshua 1:1).]]\n[[File:Cochin Jewish Inscription.JPG|thumb|Kochangadi Synagogue in [[Kochi]], India dated to 1344.]]\n\nAfter the Talmud, various regional literary dialects of [[Medieval Hebrew]] evolved. The most important is [[Tiberian Hebrew]] or Masoretic Hebrew, a local dialect of [[Tiberias]] in [[Galilee]] that became the standard for vocalizing the [[Hebrew Bible]] and thus still influences all other regional dialects of Hebrew. This Tiberian Hebrew from the 7th to 10th century CE is sometimes called \"Biblical Hebrew\" because it is used to pronounce the Hebrew Bible; however, properly it should be distinguished from the historical Biblical Hebrew of the 6th century BCE, whose original pronunciation must be reconstructed. Tiberian Hebrew incorporates the remarkable scholarship of the [[Masoretes]] (from ''masoret'' meaning \"tradition\"), who added [[niqqud|vowel points]] and [[Cantillation|grammar points]] to the Hebrew letters to preserve much earlier features of Hebrew, for use in chanting the Hebrew Bible. The Masoretes inherited a biblical text whose letters were considered too sacred to be altered, so their markings were in the form of pointing in and around the letters. The [[Syriac alphabet]], precursor to the [[Arabic alphabet]], also developed vowel pointing systems around this time. The [[Aleppo Codex]], a Hebrew Bible with the Masoretic pointing, was written in the 10th century, likely in [[Tiberias]], and survives to this day. It is perhaps the most important Hebrew manuscript in existence.\n\nDuring the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]], important work was done by grammarians in explaining the grammar and vocabulary of Biblical Hebrew; much of this was based on the work of the [[Islamic grammatical tradition|grammarians]] of [[Classical Arabic]]. Important Hebrew grammarians were [[Judah ben David Hayyuj]], [[Jonah ibn Janah]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]]<ref>Abraham ibn Ezra, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/19685 ''Hebrew Grammar''], Venice 1546 (Hebrew)</ref> and later (in [[Provence]]), [[David Kimhi]]. A great deal of poetry was written, by poets such as [[Dunash ben Labrat]], [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Judah ha-Levi]], [[Moses ibn Ezra]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], in a \"purified\" Hebrew based on the work of these grammarians, and in Arabic quantitative or strophic meters. This literary Hebrew was later used by Italian Jewish poets.<ref>T. Carmi, ''Penguin Book of Hebrew Verse''.</ref>\n\nThe need to express scientific and philosophical concepts from [[Classical Greek language|Classical Greek]] and [[Arabic language|Medieval Arabic]] motivated Medieval Hebrew to borrow terminology and grammar from these other languages, or to coin equivalent terms from existing Hebrew roots, giving rise to a distinct style of philosophical Hebrew. This is used in the translations made by the [[Ibn Tibbon]] family. (Original Jewish philosophical works were usually written in Arabic.) Another important influence was [[Maimonides]], who developed a simple style based on [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] for use in his law code, the [[Mishneh Torah]].  Subsequent rabbinic literature is written in a blend between this style and the Aramaized Rabbinic Hebrew of the Talmud.\n\nHebrew persevered through the ages as the main language for written purposes by all Jewish communities around the world for a large range of uses\u2014not only liturgy, but also poetry, philosophy, science and medicine, commerce, daily correspondence and contracts. There have been many deviations from this generalization such as [[Simon bar Kokhba|Bar Kokhba]]'s letters to his lieutenants, which were mostly in Aramaic,<ref>Safrai, Shmuel, Shemuel Safrai, M. Stern. 1976. The Jewish people in the first century. P.1036</ref> and [[Maimonides]]' writings, which were mostly in [[Arabic]];<ref>Fox, Marvin. 1995. Interpreting Maimonides. P.326</ref> but overall, Hebrew did not cease to be used for such purposes. For example, the first Middle East printing press, in Safed (modern Israel), produced a small number of books in Hebrew in 1577, which were then sold to the nearby Jewish world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://cojs.org/1577-first-printing-press-middle-east-safed/|title=1577 The First Printing Press in the Middle East - Safed - Center for Online Judaic Studies|date=2017-09-07|work=Center for Online Judaic Studies|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en-US}}</ref> This meant not only that well-educated Jews in all parts of the world could correspond in a mutually intelligible language, and that books and legal documents published or written in any part of the world could be read by Jews in all other parts, but that an educated Jew could travel and converse with Jews in distant places, just as priests and other educated Christians could converse in Latin. For example, Rabbi [[Avraham Danzig]] wrote the ''[[Chayei Adam]]'' in Hebrew, as opposed to [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], as a guide to ''[[Halacha]]'' for the \"''average'' 17-year-old\" (Ibid. Introduction 1). Similarly, the [[Chofetz Chaim]], Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]]'s purpose in writing the ''[[Mishna Berurah]]'' was to \"produce a work that could be studied daily so that Jews might know the proper procedures to follow minute by minute\".  The work was nevertheless written in Talmudic Hebrew and Aramaic, since, \"the ordinary Jew [of Eastern Europe] of a century ago, was fluent enough in this idiom to be able to follow the Mishna Berurah without any trouble.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=onNwsw0akyoC&pg=PR14&lpg=PR14 |title=Mishnah B'rurah \u2013 Israel Meir (ha-Kohen), Aharon Feldman, Aviel Orenstein \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=3 May 2013|isbn=9780873061988|year=1980}}</ref>\n\n=== Revival ===\n{{Main|Revival of the Hebrew language}}\nHebrew has been revived several times as a literary language, most significantly by the [[Haskalah]] (Enlightenment) movement of early and mid-19th-century Germany. In the early 19th century, a form of spoken Hebrew had emerged in the markets of Jerusalem between Jews of different linguistic backgrounds to communicate for commercial purposes. This Hebrew dialect was to a certain extent a [[pidgin]].<ref>http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/This-week-in-history-Revival-of-the-Hebrew-language</ref> Near the end of that century the Jewish activist [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]], owing to the ideology of the [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]] ({{lang|he|\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05e6\u05d9\u05d5\u05df}}, ''Shivat Tziyon,'' later [[Zionism]]), began reviving Hebrew as a modern spoken language. Eventually, as a result of the local movement he created, but more significantly as a result of the new groups of immigrants known under the name of the [[Second Aliyah]], it replaced a score of languages spoken by Jews at that time. Those languages were Jewish dialects of local languages, including [[Judaeo-Spanish]] (also called \"Judezmo\" and \"Ladino\"), [[Yiddish]], [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]], and [[Bukhori dialect|Bukhori]] (Tajiki), or local languages spoken in the [[Jewish diaspora]] such as [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].\n\nThe major result of the literary work of the Hebrew intellectuals along the 19th century was a lexical modernization of Hebrew. New words and expressions were adapted as [[neologism]]s from the large corpus of Hebrew writings since the Hebrew Bible, or borrowed from Arabic (mainly by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda) and older Aramaic and Latin. Many new words were either borrowed from or coined after European languages, especially English, Russian, German, and French. Modern Hebrew became an official language in British-ruled Palestine in 1921 (along with English and Arabic), and then in 1948 became an official language of the newly declared [[Israel|State of Israel]]. Hebrew is the most widely spoken language in Israel today.\n\nIn the Modern Period, from the 19th century onward, the literary Hebrew tradition revived as the spoken language of modern Israel, called variously ''Israeli Hebrew'', ''Modern Israeli Hebrew'', ''Modern Hebrew'', ''New Hebrew'', ''Israeli Standard Hebrew'', ''Standard Hebrew'', and so on. Israeli Hebrew exhibits some features of [[Sephardic Hebrew]] from its local Jerusalemite tradition but adapts it with numerous neologisms, borrowed terms (often technical) from European languages and adopted terms (often colloquial) from Arabic.\n\n[[File:Eliezer Ben-Yehuda at his desk in Jerusalem - c1912.jpg|thumb|[[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]]]]\nThe literary and narrative use of Hebrew was revived beginning with the Haskalah movement. The first secular periodical in Hebrew, ''[[Me'assefim|HaMe'assef]]'' (The Gatherer), was published by [[maskil]]im in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (today's [[Kaliningrad]]) from 1783 onwards.<ref>[[Shalom Spiegel]], ''Hebrew Reborn'' (1930), Meridian Books reprint 1962, New York p. 56.</ref> In the mid-19th century, publications of several Eastern European Hebrew-language newspapers (e.g. ''[[Hamagid]]'', founded in [[E\u0142k]] in 1856) multiplied. Prominent poets were [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] and [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]]; there were also novels written in the language.\n\nThe [[revival of the Hebrew language]] as a [[first language|mother tongue]] was initiated in the late 19th century by the efforts of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda. He joined the [[Zionism|Jewish national movement]] and in 1881 immigrated to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], then a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Motivated by the surrounding ideals of renovation and rejection of the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] \"[[shtetl]]\" lifestyle, Ben-Yehuda set out to develop tools for making the [[literary language|literary]] and [[sacred language|liturgical language]] into everyday [[spoken language]]. However, his brand of Hebrew followed norms that had been replaced in [[Eastern Europe]] by different grammar and style, in the writings of people like [[Ahad Ha'am]] and others. His organizational efforts and involvement with the establishment of schools and the writing of textbooks pushed the [[vernacular]]ization activity into a gradually accepted movement. It was not, however, until the 1904\u20131914 [[Second Aliyah]] that Hebrew had caught real momentum in Ottoman Palestine with the more highly organized enterprises set forth by the new group of immigrants. When the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] recognized Hebrew as one of the country's three official languages (English, Arabic, and Hebrew, in 1922), its new formal status contributed to its diffusion. A constructed modern language with a truly Semitic vocabulary and written appearance, although often European in [[phonology]], was to take its place among the current languages of the nations.\n\nWhile many saw his work as fanciful or even [[blasphemy|blasphemous]]<ref>[http://www.jewishmag.com/43mag/ben-yehuda/ben-yehuda.htm Eliezer Ben Yehuda and the Resurgence of the Hebrew Language] by Libby Kantorwitz</ref> (because Hebrew was the holy language of the Torah and therefore some thought that it should not be used to discuss everyday matters), many soon understood the need for a common language amongst Jews of the British Mandate who at the turn of the 20th century were arriving in large numbers from diverse countries and speaking different languages. A Committee of the Hebrew Language was established. After the establishment of Israel, it became the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]. The results of Ben-Yehuda's lexicographical work were published in a dictionary (''The Complete Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Hebrew''). The seeds of Ben-Yehuda's work fell on fertile ground, and by the beginning of the 20th century, Hebrew was well on its way to becoming the main language of the Jewish population of both Ottoman and British Palestine. At the time, members of the [[Yishuv|Old Yishuv]] and a very few [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] sects, most notably those under the auspices of [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], refused to speak Hebrew and spoke only Yiddish.\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union]], the use of Hebrew, along with other Jewish cultural and religious activities, was suppressed. Soviet authorities considered the use of Hebrew \"reactionary\" since it was associated with [[Zionism]], and the teaching of Hebrew at primary and secondary schools was officially banned by the [[People's Commissariat for Education]] as early as 1919, as part of an overall agenda aiming to [[secularization|secularize]] education (the language itself did not cease to be studied at universities for historical and linguistic purposes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewish-heritage.org/prep26.htm |title=The Transformation of Jewish Culture in the USSR from 1930 to the Present (in Russian) |publisher=Jewish-heritage.org |date= |accessdate=25 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222024723/http://www.jewish-heritage.org/prep26.htm |archivedate=22 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>).

Several of the teachers were imprisoned, e.g. [[Iosif Begun|Yosef Begun]], [[Ephraim Kholmyansky]], [[Yevgeny Korostyshevsky]] and others responsible for a Hebrew learning network connecting many cities of the USSR.\n\n=== Modern Hebrew ===\n{{Main|Modern Hebrew}}\n[[File:Annava165.jpg|thumb|upright=1.59|Hebrew, [[Arabic]] and English multilingual signs on an Israeli highway]]\n[[File:Hebkeyboard.JPG|thumb|Dual language [[Hebrew keyboard|Hebrew]] and English keyboard]]\nStandard Hebrew, as developed by [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]], was based on [[Mishnaic Hebrew|Mishnaic]] spelling and [[Sephardi Hebrew]] pronunciation.

The earliest Biblical Hebrew vowel system contained the Proto-Semitic vowels /a a\u02d0 i i\u02d0 u u\u02d0/ as well as /o\u02d0/, but this system changed dramatically over time.\n\nBy the time of the Dead Sea Scrolls, /\u026c/ had shifted to /s/ in the Jewish traditions, though for the Samaritans it merged with /\u0283/ instead. (Elisha Qimron 1986. ''Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', 29). The Tiberian reading tradition of the Middle Ages had the vowel system /a \u025b e i \u0254 o u \u0103 \u0254\u0306 \u025b\u0306/, though other Medieval reading traditions had fewer vowels.\n\nA number of reading traditions have been preserved in liturgical use. In Oriental ([[Sephardi Hebrew|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Hebrew|Mizrahi]]) Jewish reading traditions, the emphatic consonants are realized as pharyngealized, while the [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] (northern and eastern European) traditions have lost emphatics and pharyngeals (although according to Ashkenazi law, pharyngeal articulation is preferred over uvular or glottal articulation when representing the community in religious service such as prayer and [[Torah reading]]), and show the shift of /w/ to /v/. The [[Samaritan Hebrew|Samaritan]] tradition has a complex vowel system which does not correspond closely to the [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]] systems.\n\nModern Hebrew pronunciation developed from a mixture of the different Jewish reading traditions, generally tending towards simplification. In line with [[Sephardi Hebrew]] pronunciation, emphatic consonants have shifted to their ordinary counterparts, /w/ to /v/, and [\u0263 \u00f0 \u03b8] are not present. Most Israelis today also merge /\u0295 \u0127/ with /\u0294 \u03c7/, do not have contrastive gemination, and pronounce /r/ as a uvular fricative [\u0281] or a voiced velar fricative [\u0263] rather than an alveolar trill, because of Ashkenazi Hebrew influences. The consonants /t\u0283/ and /d\u0292/ have become phonemic due to loan words, and /w/ has similarly been re-introduced.\n\n===Consonants===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Later on, however, {{IPA|/\u026c/}} merged with {{IPA|/s/}}, but the old spelling was largely retained, and the two pronunciations of <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05e9}}</big> were distinguished graphically in [[Tiberian Hebrew]] as <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05e9\u05c1}}</big> {{IPA|/\u0283/}} vs. <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05e9\u05c2}}</big> {{IPA|/s/}} < {{IPA|/\u026c/}}.\n# Biblical Hebrew as of the 3rd century BCE apparently still distinguished the phonemes {{transl|sem|\u0121}} {{IPA|/\u0281/}}, {{transl|sem|\u1e2b}} {{IPA|/\u03c7/}}, {{transl|sem|\u1e0f}} {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} and {{transl|sem|\u1e6f}} {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, based on transcriptions in the [[Septuagint]]. As in the case of {{IPA|/\u026c/}}, no letters were available to represent these sounds, and existing letters did double duty: <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05d7}}</big> {{IPA|/\u03c7/ /\u0127/}}, <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05e2}}</big> {{IPA|/\u0281/ /\u0295/}}, <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05e9\u05c1}}</big> {{IPA|/\u03b8/ /\u0283/}} and <big>{{script|Hebr|\u05d6}}</big> {{IPA|/\u00f0/ /z/}}. In all of these cases, however, the sounds represented by the same letter eventually merged, leaving no evidence (other than early transcriptions) of the former distinctions.\n# Hebrew and Aramaic underwent [[begadkefat]] spirantization at a certain point, whereby the stop sounds {{IPA|/b \u0261 d k p t/}} were [[lenition|softened]] to the corresponding fricatives {{IPA|[v \u0263 \u00f0 x f \u03b8]}} (written ''\u1e07 \u1e21 \u1e0f \u1e35 p\u0304 \u1e6f'') when occurring after a vowel and not geminated. This change probably happened after the original Old Aramaic phonemes {{IPA|/\u03b8, \u00f0/}} disappeared in the 7th century&nbsp;BCE,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Dolgopolsky|1999|p=72}}</ref> and most likely occurred after the loss of Hebrew {{IPA|/\u03c7, \u0281/}} c. 200&nbsp;BCE.<ref group=\"note\">According to the generally accepted view, it is unlikely that begadkefat spirantization occurred before the merger of {{IPA|/\u03c7, \u0281/}} and {{IPA|/\u0127, \u0295/}}, or else {{IPA|[x, \u03c7]}} and {{IPA|[\u0263, \u0281]}} would have to be contrastive, which is cross-linguistically rare. However, Blau argues that it is possible that lenited {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u03c7/}} could coexist even if pronounced identically, since one would be recognized as an alternating allophone (as apparently is the case in Nestorian Syriac). See {{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|p=56}}.</ref> It is known to have occurred in Hebrew by the 2nd century.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Dolgopolsky|1999|p=73}}</ref>{{Contradict-inline|article=Begadkefat|date=October 2014}} After a certain point this alternation became contrastive in word-medial and final position (though bearing low [[functional load]]), but in word-initial position they remained allophonic.<ref name=\"bbgd\">{{Harvcoltxt|Blau|2010|pp=78\u201381}}</ref> In [[Modern Hebrew]], the distinction has a higher functional load due to the loss of gemination, although only the three fricatives {{IPA|/v \u03c7 f/}} are still preserved (the fricative {{IPA|/x/}} is pronounced {{IPA|/\u03c7/}} in modern Hebrew). (The others are pronounced like the corresponding stops, apparently under the influence of later non-native speakers whose native European tongues lacked the sounds {{IPA|/\u0263 \u00f0 \u03b8/}} as phonemes.)\n\n== Hebrew grammar ==\n{{Main|Modern Hebrew grammar}}\n{{Further|History of Hebrew grammar}}\nHebrew grammar is partly [[analytic language|analytic]], expressing such forms as [[dative case|dative]], [[ablative case|ablative]], and [[accusative case|accusative]] using [[preposition]]al particles rather than [[grammatical case]]s. However, inflection plays a decisive role in the formation of the verbs and nouns. For example, nouns have a [[construct state]], called \"smikhut\", to denote the relationship of \"belonging to\": this is the converse of the [[genitive case]] of more inflected languages. Words in smikhut are often combined with [[hyphen]]s.  In modern speech, the use of the construct is sometimes interchangeable with the preposition \"shel\", meaning \"of\".  There are many cases, however, where older declined forms are retained (especially in idiomatic expressions and the like), and \"person\"-[[enclitic]]s are widely used to \"decline\" prepositions.\n\n=== Morphology ===\nLike all Semitic languages, the Hebrew language exhibits a pattern of stems consisting typically of \"[[triliteral]]\", or 3-consonant [[Triliteral|consonantal roots]] (4-consonant roots also exist), from which nouns, adjectives, and verbs are formed in various ways: e.g. by inserting vowels, doubling consonants, lengthening vowels, and/or adding prefixes, suffixes, or [[infix]]es.\n\nHebrew uses a number of [[Prefixes and suffixes in Hebrew|one-letter prefixes]] that are added to words for various purposes. These are called inseparable prepositions or \"Letters of Use\" ({{lang-he|\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05e9|Otiyot HaShimush|links=no}}). Such items include: the definite [[article (grammar)|article]] ''ha-'' ({{IPA|/ha/}}) (=\"the\"); [[preposition]]s ''be-'' ({{IPA|/b\u0259/}}) (=\"in\"), ''le-'' ({{IPA|/l\u0259/}}) (=\"to\"; a shortened version of the preposition ''el''), ''mi-'' ({{IPA|/mi/}}) (=\"from\"; a shortened version of the preposition ''min''); [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] ''ve-'' ({{IPA|/v\u0259/}}) (=\"and\"), ''she-'' ({{IPA|/\u0283e/}}) (=\"that\"; a shortened version of the Biblical conjunction ''asher''), ''ke-'' ({{IPA|/k\u0259/}}) (=\"as\", \"like\"; a shortened version of the conjunction ''kmo'').\n\nThe vowel accompanying each of these letters may differ from those listed above, depending on the first letter or vowel following it. The rules governing these changes, hardly observed in colloquial speech as most speakers tend to employ the regular form, may be heard in more formal circumstances. For example, if a preposition is put before a word which begins with a moving [[Shva]], then the preposition takes the vowel {{IPA|/i/}} (and the initial consonant may be weakened): colloquial ''be-kfar'' (=\"in a village\") corresponds to the more formal ''bi-khfar''.\n\nThe definite article may be inserted between a preposition or a conjunction and the word it refers to, creating composite words like ''m\u00e9-ha-kfar'' (=\"from the village\"). The latter also demonstrates the change in the vowel of ''mi-''. With ''be'',  ''le'' and ''ke'', the definite article is assimilated into the prefix, which then becomes ''ba'', ''la'' or ''ka''. Thus *''be-ha-matos'' becomes ''ba-matos'' (=\"in the plane\"). Note that this does not happen to ''m\u00e9'' (the form of \"min\" or \"mi-\" used before the letter \"he\"), therefore ''m\u00e9-ha-matos'' is a valid form, which means \"from the airplane\".\n\n:''* indicates that the given example is grammatically [[standard language|non-standard]]''.\n\n=== Syntax ===\nLike most other languages, the vocabulary of the Hebrew language is divided into verbs, nouns, adjectives, and so on, and its sentence structure can be analyzed by terms like object, subject, and so on.\n* Many Hebrew sentences have several correct orders of words. One can change the order of the words in the sentence and keep the same meaning. For example, the sentence \"Dad went to work\", in Hebrew, includes a word for ''Dad'' ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0}} ''{{transl|he|aba}}''), for ''went'' ({{lang|he|\u05d4\u05dc\u05da}} ''{{transl|he|hala\u1e35}}''), and for ''to work'' (to the working place = {{lang|he|\u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4}} ''{{transl|he|la-\u02bfavoda}}''). However, unlike in English, those three words can be put in almost any combination ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0&nbsp;\u05d4\u05dc\u05da&nbsp;\u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4/ \u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4&nbsp;\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0&nbsp;\u05d4\u05dc\u05da/ \u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4&nbsp;\u05d4\u05dc\u05da&nbsp;\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0/ \u05d4\u05dc\u05da&nbsp;\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0&nbsp;\u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4}} and so on).\n* In Hebrew, there is no word that is supposed to come before every singular noun (i.e. an [[Article (grammar)|article]]).\n* Hebrew sentences do not have to include verbs; the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] in the [[present tense]] is omitted. For example, the sentence \"I am here\" ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9&nbsp;\u05e4\u05d4}} ''{{transl|he|ani&nbsp;po}}'') has only two words; one for I ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9}}) and one for here ({{lang|he|\u05e4\u05d4}}). In the sentence \"I am that person\" ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9&nbsp;\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0&nbsp;\u05d4\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd&nbsp;\u05d4\u05d6\u05d4}} ''{{transl|he|ani&nbsp;hu&nbsp;ha'adam&nbsp;ha'ze}}''), the word for \"am\" corresponds to the word for \"he\" ({{lang|he|\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0}}).

The ancient [[paleo-Hebrew alphabet]] is similar to those used for [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Modern scripts are based on the \"square\" letter form, known as ''Ashurit'' (Assyrian), which was developed from the Aramaic script. A [[cursive Hebrew]] script is used in handwriting: the letters tend to be more circular in form when written in cursive, and sometimes vary markedly from their printed equivalents.  The medieval version of the cursive script forms the basis of another style, known as [[Rashi script]].  When necessary, vowels are indicated by diacritic marks above or below the letter representing the syllabic onset, or by use of ''[[matres lectionis]]'', which are consonantal letters used as vowels.  Further diacritics are used to indicate variations in the pronunciation of the consonants (e.g. ''bet''/''vet'', ''shin''/''sin''); and, in some contexts, to indicate the punctuation, accentuation, and musical rendition of Biblical texts (see [[Cantillation]]).\n{{clear2|right}}\n\n== Liturgical use in Judaism ==\n{{Listen|filename=Cantillation_Example_Aliyah_Reform2.ogg|title=Audio example of liturgical Hebrew |description=This is a portion of the blessing that is traditionally [[cantillation|chanted]] before the [[Baal kore|Aliyah La-Torah]] (reading of the Torah). |format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nHebrew has always been used as the language of prayer and study, and the following pronunciation systems are found.\n\n[[Ashkenazi Hebrew]], originating in Central and Eastern Europe, is still widely used in Ashkenazi Jewish religious services and studies in Israel and abroad, particularly in the [[Haredi]] and other [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] communities. It was influenced by the Yiddish language.\n\n[[Sephardi Hebrew]] is the traditional pronunciation of the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] and [[Sephardi Jews]] in the countries of the former [[Ottoman Empire]], with the exception of [[Yemenite Hebrew]].  This pronunciation, in the form used by the Jerusalem Sephardic community, is the basis of the [[Modern Hebrew phonology|Hebrew phonology]] of Israeli native speakers. It was influenced by the [[Judezmo]] language.\n\n[[Mizrahi Hebrew|Mizrahi (Oriental) Hebrew]] is actually a collection of dialects spoken liturgically by Jews in various parts of the [[Arab]] and [[Islam]]ic world. It was possibly influenced by the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Arabic language]]s, and in some cases by [[Sephardi Hebrew]], although some linguists maintain that it is the direct heir of [[Biblical Hebrew]] and thus represents the true dialect of Hebrew.  The same claim is sometimes made for [[Yemenite Hebrew]] or ''Temanit'', which differs from other Mizrahi dialects by having a radically different vowel system, and distinguishing between different diacritically marked consonants that are pronounced identically in other dialects (for example gimel and \"ghimel\".)\n\nThese pronunciations are still used in synagogue ritual and religious study, in Israel and elsewhere, mostly by people who are not native speakers of Hebrew, though some traditionalist Israelis use liturgical pronunciations in prayer.\n\nMany synagogues in the diaspora, even though Ashkenazi by rite and by ethnic composition, have adopted the \"Sephardic\" pronunciation in deference to Israeli Hebrew. However, in many British and American schools and synagogues, this pronunciation retains several elements of its Ashkenazi substrate, especially the distinction between [[Niqqud|tsere]] and [[Niqqud|segol]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Israel|Language}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]\n* [[List of Hebrew dictionaries]]\n* [[Hebraism]]\n* [[Hebraization of English]]\n* [[Hebrew abbreviations]]\n* [[Hebrew literature]]\n* [[Hebrew numerals]]\n* [[Jewish languages]]\n* [[List of English words of Hebrew origin]]\n* [[Romanization of Hebrew]]\n* [[Study of the Hebrew language]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Joel M.|title=In the Beginning: A Short History of the Hebrew Language|place=New York|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=0-8147-3654-8}}\n* {{cite web|last=Izre'el|first= Shlomo|editor=[[Benjamin Hary]]|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/semitic/cosih.html|title= The Corpus of Spoken Israeli Hebrew| publisher=(CoSIH): Working Papers I|date=2001}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Klein|first= Reuven Chaim|title=Lashon HaKodesh: History, Holiness, & Hebrew|publisher=Mosaica Press|date= 2014|isbn=978-1937887360}}\n* {{cite book|last=Kuzar|first= Ron|title=Hebrew and Zionism: A Discourse Analytic Cultural Study|place= Berlin & New York|publisher= Mouton de Gruyter|date= 2001|isbn=3-11-016993-2}}\n* {{cite book|last=Laufer|first= Asher|title=Hebrew Handbook of the International Phonetic Association|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=1999|isbn=0-521-65236-7}}\n* {{cite book|last=S\u00e1enz-Badillos|first= Angel|date=1993|title=A History of the Hebrew Language|translator=John Elwolde|place=Cambridge, England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-55634-1}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links |wikt=Hebrew |q=Hebraic proverbs |s=Category:Hebrew language |voy=Hebrew phrasebook |n=no}}\n{{Wiktionary category}}\n{{InterWiki|code=he}}\n{{WikisourceWiki|code=he}}\n;Government\n*[http://en.hebrew-academy.org.il/ Official website] of the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]\n*[http://maagarim.hebrew-academy.org.il/Pages/PMain.aspx Ma'agarim] \u2013 The [[Historical Dictionary Project of the Hebrew Language|Historical Dictionary Project]] by the Academy of the Hebrew Language\n*[http://goisrael.com/evng/Tourist%20Information/Jewish%20Culture/Pages/Hebrew%20Phrases.aspx Hebrew Phrases] by the [[Ministry of Tourism (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Tourism]]\n\n;General information\n*[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/hebrewtoc.html Hebrew language] at the [[Jewish Virtual Library]]\n*[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7453-hebrew-language Hebrew language] at the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''\n*[http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/other/hebrew/guide/ A Guide to Hebrew] at [[BBC Online]]\n*[http://www.adath-shalom.ca/rabin_he.htm ''A Short History of the Hebrew Language''] by [[Chaim Menachem Rabin]]\n*{{Dmoz|Science/Social_Sciences/Linguistics/Languages/Natural/Afro-Asiatic/Hebrew}}\n\n;Tutorials, courses and dictionaries\n*[https://www.laits.utexas.edu/hebrew/ Hebrew language] at the [[University of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts]]\n*[https://www.livelingua.com/course/fsi/Hebrew_-_Basic_Course Hebrew Basic Course] by the [[Foreign Service Institute]]\n*[http://www.ulpan-online.com/ Hebrew for the 21st century], online [[ulpan]]\n*[http://www.morfix.co.il/en/ Morfix], online dictionary\n*[http://conjugator.reverso.net/conjugation-hebrew.html Hebrew verbs conjugation] \u2013 Hebrew verb conjugation tool\n\n{{Hebrew language}}\n{{Languages of Israel}}\n{{Semitic languages}}\n{{Jewish languages}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hebrew Language}}\n[[Category:Hebrew language| ]]\n[[Category:Languages of Israel]]\n[[Category:Verb\u2013subject\u2013object languages]]\n[[Category:Fusional languages]]\n[[Category:Languages attested from the 10th century BC]]", "sha1": "bfhmwdjrai2nezv771ey0qnoqsxsqo2"}}, {"title": "Horror film", "ns": "0", "id": "13451", "revision": {"id": "866409381", "parentid": "866409277", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T04:07:28Z", "contributor": {"username": "Bobertismyname", "id": "35014053"}, "comment": "/* 2010s */Fixed typo.

German expressionism refers to the artistic movement that originated from the First World War until the 1920s. It influenced the arts, music, architecture, film, theatre etc. Many expressionist works emphasize a distorted reality, stimulating the human psyche and have influenced the horror film genre. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920) became a worldwide success and had a lasting impact on the film world, particularly for horror. It was not so much the story but the style that made it distinguishable from other films, \"Caligari\u2019s settings, some simply painted on canvas backdrops, are weirdly distorted, with caricatures of narrow streets, misshapen walls, odd rhomboid windows, and leaning doorframes.

''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]'' (1961) based on the [[Henry James]] novel ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]''. Meanwhile, ghosts were a dominant theme in [[Japanese horror]], in such films as ''[[Kwaidan (film)|Kwaidan]]'', ''[[Onibaba (film)|Onibaba]]'' (both 1964) and ''[[Kuroneko]]'' (1968).\n\n''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968) is an American [[psychological horror]] film written and directed by [[Roman Polanski]], based on the bestselling [[Rosemary's Baby (novel)|1967 novel of the same name]] by [[Ira Levin]]. Another influential American horror film of this period was [[George A. Romero]]'s ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968). Produced and directed by Romero on a budget of $114,000, it grossed $30 million internationally. An Armageddon film about [[zombie]]s, it began to combine psychological insights with gore. Distancing the era from earlier gothic trends, late 1960s films brought horror into everyday life. Low-budget [[splatter film]]s from the likes of [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]] also gained prominence.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Karina|title=Horror Movies In The 1960s: Bad Girls And Blood Freaks|url=http://www.horrorfilmhistory.com/index.php?pageID=1960s|website=Horror Film History|accessdate=14 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u20131980s ===\n[[File:Suspiria 1977.jpg|thumb|200px|Suzy ([[Jessica Harper]], right) and Sara ([[Stefania Casini]], left) in ''[[Suspiria]]'', a [[giallo]] horror film.]]\nThe financial successes of the low-budget gore films of the ensuing years, and the critical and popular success of ''Rosemary's Baby'', led to the release of more films with occult themes in the 1970s. ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973), the first of these movies, was a significant commercial success and was followed by scores of horror films in which a demon entity is represented as the supernatural evil, often by impregnating women or possessing children.\n\n\"Evil children\" and [[reincarnation]] became popular subjects. [[Robert Wise]]'s film ''[[Audrey Rose (film)|Audrey Rose]]'' (1977) for example, deals with a man who claims that his daughter is the reincarnation of another dead person. ''[[Alice, Sweet Alice]]'' (1977), is another Catholic-themed horror slasher about a little girl's murder and her sister being the prime suspect. Another popular occult horror movie was ''[[The Omen]]'' (1976), where a man realizes that his five-year-old adopted son is the [[Antichrist]]. Invincible to human intervention, Demons became villains in many horror films with a [[postmodernism|postmodern]] style and a [[dystopia]]n worldview. Another example is ''[[The Sentinel (1977 film)|The Sentinel]]'' (1977), in which a fashion model discovers that her new brownstone residence may actually be a portal to [[Hell]].\n\nIn the 1970s, Italian filmmakers [[Mario Bava]], [[Riccardo Freda]], [[Antonio Margheriti]], and [[Dario Argento]] developed [[giallo]] horror films that became classics and influenced the genre in other countries. Representative films include: ''[[Twitch of the Death Nerve]]'', ''[[Deep Red]]'' and ''[[Suspiria]]''.\n\n''[[Don't Look Now]]'' (1973), a independent British-Italian film directed by [[Nicolas Roeg]], was also notable. Its focus on the psychology of grief was unusually strong for a film featuring a supernatural horror plot. Another notable film is ''[[The Wicker Man]]'' (1973), a British [[Mystery film|mystery]] horror film dealing with the practice of ancient pagan rituals in the modern era. It was written by [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]] and directed by [[Robin Hardy (film director)|Robin Hardy]].\n\nThe ideas of the 1960s began to influence horror films, as the youth involved in the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] began exploring the medium. [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972) along with [[Tobe Hooper]]'s ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974)<ref>{{cite web|title=Cannibalistic Capitalism and other American Delicacies|url=http://www.film-philosophy.com/index.php/f-p/article/view/190|work=Naomi Merritt}}</ref> (based on the [[Ed Gein]] case) recalled the [[Vietnam War]]; while [[George A. Romero]] satirized the consumer society in his zombie sequel, ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978). Meanwhile, the subgenre of [[comedy horror]] re-emerged in the cinema with ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]'' (1971), ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974), ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), and ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' (1981) among others.\n\nAlso in the 1970s, the works of the horror author [[Stephen King]] began to be adapted for the screen, beginning with [[Brian De Palma]]'s adaptation of ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' (1976), King's first published novel, for which the two female leads ([[Sissy Spacek]] and [[Piper Laurie]]) gained [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations. Next, was his third published novel, ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980), directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]], which was a [[Sleeper hit|sleeper]] at the box office. At first, many critics and viewers had negative feedback toward ''The Shining''. However, the film is now known as one of Hollywood's most classic horror films.\n\nThis psychological horror film has a variety of themes; \"evil children\", alcoholism, [[telepathy]], and insanity. This type of film is an example of how Hollywood's idea of horror started to evolve. Murder and violence were no longer the main themes of horror films. In the 1970s and 1980s, psychological and supernatural horror started to take over cinema. Another classic Hollywood horror film is [[Tobe Hooper]]'s ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' (1982). ''Poltergeist'' is ranked the 20th scariest movie ever made by the [[Chicago, Illinois Film Critics Association]]. Both ''The Shining'' and ''Poltergeist'' involve horror being based on real-estate values. The evil and horror throughout the films come from where the movies are taking place.<ref>''The American Horror Film'' by Reynold Humphries</ref><ref>''American Horror Film'' edited by Stefen Hantke</ref>\n\n''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' is a 1979 supernatural horror film directed by [[Stuart Rosenberg]], based on [[Jay Anson]]'s [[1977 in literature|1977]] [[The Amityville Horror|book of the same name]]. It stars [[James Brolin]] and [[Margot Kidder]] as a young couple who purchase a home they come to find haunted by combative supernatural forces. ''[[The Changeling (1980 film)|The Changeling]]'' is a 1980 Canadian psychological horror film directed by [[Peter Medak]].\n\nA cycle of [[slasher film]]s was made in the 1970s and 1980s. [[John Carpenter]] created ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), [[Sean S. Cunningham]] made ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980), [[Wes Craven]] directed ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984), and [[Clive Barker]] made ''[[Hellraiser]]'' (1987). This subgenre would be mined by dozens of increasingly violent movies throughout the subsequent decades, and ''Halloween'' became a successful independent film. Another notable 1970s slasher film is [[Bob Clark]]'s ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (1974). ''[[Sleepaway Camp]]'' (1983) is known for its [[twist ending]], which is considered by some to be one of the most shocking endings among horror films. ''[[My Bloody Valentine (film)|My Bloody Valentine]]'' (1981) is a slasher film dealing with [[Valentine's Day]] fiction. The boom in slasher films provided enough material for numerous comedic [[Parody film|spoofs]] of the genre including ''[[Saturday the 14th]]'' (1981), ''[[Student Bodies]]'' (1981), ''[[National Lampoon's Class Reunion]]'' (1982), and ''[[Hysterical (film)|Hysterical]]'' (1983).\n\nSome films explored [[urban legend]]s such as \"[[The babysitter and the man upstairs]]\".\nA notable example is ''[[When a Stranger Calls (1979 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]'' (1979), an American psychological horror film directed by [[Fred Walton (director)|Fred Walton]] starring [[Carol Kane]] and [[Charles Durning]].\n\n[[Steven Spielberg]]'s shark horror film, ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975), began a new wave of killer animal stories, such as ''[[Orca (film)|Orca]]'' (1977) and ''[[Up from the Depths]]'' (1979). ''Jaws'' is often credited as being one of the first films to use traditionally [[B movie]] elements such as horror and mild gore in a big-budget Hollywood film. In 1979, [[Don Coscarelli]]'s ''[[Phantasm (film)|Phantasm]]'' was the first of the [[Phantasm (franchise)|Phantasm franchise]].\n\n''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), a British-American [[science fiction film|science-fiction]] horror film directed by [[Ridley Scott]] was very successful, receiving both critical acclaim and being a box office success. John Carpenter's movie ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982) was also a mix of horror and sci-fi, but it was neither a box-office nor critical hit, but soon became a cult classic. However, nearly 20 years after its release, it was praised for using ahead-of-its-time special effects and paranoia.\n\nThe 1980s saw a wave of gory \"B movie\" horror films \u2013 although most of them were poorly reviewed by critics, many became [[cult film|cult classics]] and later saw success with critics. A significant example is [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''[[The Evil Dead (franchise)|Evil Dead]]'' movies, which were low-budget gorefests but had a very original plotline which was later praised by critics.\n\n[[Vampire films|Vampire horror]] was also popular in the 1980s, including cult vampire classics such as ''[[Fright Night]]'' (1985), ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' (1987), and ''[[Near Dark]]'' (also 1987). In 1984, [[Joe Dante]]'s seminal monster comedy horror ''[[Gremlins]]'' became a box office hit with critics and audiences, and inspired a trend of \"little monster\" films such as ''[[Critters (film)|Critters]]'' and ''[[Ghoulies]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n[[David Cronenberg]]'s films such as ''[[Shivers (film)|Shivers]]'' (1975), ''[[Rabid (film)|Rabid]]'' (1977), ''[[The Brood]]'' (1979), ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]'' (1983), and ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'' (1986) dealt with \"[[body horror]]\" and \"[[mad scientist]]\" themes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acmi.net.au/1F6B9E88D95C48FCA5239678F1BBC8C6.htm |title=The Horror: It just won't die |publisher=Acmi.net.au |date=17 September 2004 |accessdate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516140127/http://www.acmi.net.au/1F6B9E88D95C48FCA5239678F1BBC8C6.htm |archivedate=16 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSeveral [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film|action]] horror movies were released in the 1980s, notably ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986) and ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' (1987).

The slasher films, ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', and ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]'', all saw sequels in the 1990s, most of which met with varied amounts of success at the box office but all were panned by critics, with the exception of Wes Craven's ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare|New Nightmare]]'' (1994) and the hugely successful film, ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991). The latter, which stars [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]], is considered a major horror movie of all times.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-16344420 \"Silence of the Lambs Added to US Film Archive\"] (28 December 2011).  ''BBC.com''.  Retrieved 24 June 2018.</ref> ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'' (1990) also deals with a psychopath, and the film received critical acclaim for [[Kathy Bates]]'s performance as the psychopathic [[Annie Wilkes]].\n\n''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare|New Nightmare]]'', with ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' (1995), ''[[The Dark Half (film)|The Dark Half]]'' (1993), and ''[[Candyman (film)|Candyman]]'' (1992), were part of a mini-movement of self-reflexive or [[metafiction]]al horror films. Each film touched upon the relationship between fictional horror and real-world horror. ''Candyman'', for example, examined the link between an invented urban legend and the realistic horror of the racism that produced its villain. ''In the Mouth of Madness'' took a more literal approach, as its protagonist actually hopped from the real world into a novel created by the madman he was hired to track down. This reflective style became more overt and ironic with the arrival of ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996).\n\nIn ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (1994), the \"Theatre de Vampires\" (and the film itself, to some degree) invoked the [[Grand Guignol]] style, perhaps to further remove the undead performers from humanity, morality and class. The horror movie soon continued its search for new and effective frights. In the 1985 novel, ''[[The Vampire Lestat]]'', by the author [[Anne Rice]] (who penned ''Interview with the Vampire''{{'}}s screenplay and the 1976 novel of the same name) suggests that its antihero Lestat inspired and nurtured the Grand Guignol style and theatre.\n\nTwo main problems pushed horror backward during this period: firstly, the horror genre wore itself out with the proliferation of nonstop slasher and gore films in the eighties. Secondly, the adolescent audience which feasted on the blood and morbidity of the previous decade grew up, and the replacement audience for films of an imaginative nature were being captured instead by the explosion of [[Science fiction film|science-fiction]] and fantasy films, courtesy of the special effects possibilities with advances made in [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediaknowall.com/Horror/eighties.html |title=Horror Films in the 1980s |publisher=Mediaknowall.com |accessdate=24 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217005221/http://www.mediaknowall.com/Horror/eighties.html |archivedate=17 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Examples of these CGI include movies like ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'' (1995), ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]'' (1997), ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'' (1997), ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'' (1998), ''[[Deep Rising]]'' (1998), ''[[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|House on Haunted Hill]]'' (1999), ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1999), and ''[[The Haunting (1999 film)|The Haunting]]'' (1999).\n\nTo re-connect with its audience, horror became more self-mockingly [[Irony|ironic]] and outright [[Parody|parodic]], especially in the latter half of the 1990s. Peter Jackson's ''[[Braindead (1992 film)|Braindead]]'' (1992) (known as ''Dead Alive'' in the United States) took the [[splatter film]] to ridiculous excesses for comic effect. Wes Craven's ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (written by [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]]) movies, starting in 1996, featured teenagers who were fully aware of, and often made reference to, the history of horror movies, and mixed ironic humour with the shocks (despite ''[[Scream 2]]'' and ''[[Scream 3]]'' utilising less use of the humour of the original, until ''[[Scream 4]]'' in 2011, and rather more references to horror film conventions). Along with ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1997) (also written by Williamson) and ''[[Urban Legend (film)|Urban Legend]]'' (1998), they re-ignited the dormant [[slasher film]] genre.\n\n''[[Event Horizon (film)|Event Horizon]]'' (1997) is a British-American science fiction horror film directed by [[Paul W.

Around this period, [[Japanese horror]] started becoming popular in English speaking countries.\n\nThe film ''[[The Last Broadcast (film)|The Last Broadcast]]'' (1998) served as inspiration for the highly successful ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' (1999), which popularized the [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] horror subgenre.

By contrast, ''[[Valentine (film)|Valentine]]'' (2001) was a conventional horror film. It had some success at the box office, but was derided by critics for being formulaic and relying on foregone horror film conventions. ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]'' (2001) was hugely successful, winning and being further nominated for many awards. It is a 2001 Spanish-American supernatural [[Gothic fiction|gothic horror]] film with elements of psychological horror. It was written, directed, and scored by [[Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar]]. It stars [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Fionnula Flanagan]].\n\nFranchise films such as ''[[Jason X]]'' (2001) and ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' (2003) also made a stand in theaters. ''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'' (2000) marked a successful revival of teen-centered horror and spawned five installments. ''[[Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)|Jeepers Creepers]]'' series was also successful.

The horror film style has changed over time, but, in 1996, ''Scream'' set off a \"chain of copycats\", leading to a new variety of teenage, horror movies.<ref name=Stack>{{cite web|last=Stack|first=Tim|title=Oh, The Horror.|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&hid=21&sid=f974de41-a7e4-4577-88d9-fbc1438149fa@sessionmgr14&bdata=JmxvZ2luLmFzcCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmU=|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref> This new approach to horror films began to gradually earn more and more revenue as seen in the progress of ''Scream'' movies; the first movie earned $6 million and the third movie earned $101 million.<ref name=Stack /> The importance that horror films have gained in the public and producers\u2019 eyes is one obvious effect on our society.\n\nHorror films' income expansion is only the first sign of the influences of horror flicks. The role of women and how women see themselves in the movie industry has been altered by the horror genre. Early horror films such as ''[[My Bloody Valentine (film)|My Bloody Valentine]]'' (1981), ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), and ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980) were produced mostly for male audiences in order to \"feed the fantasies of young men\".<ref name=Nowell>{{cite web|last=Nowell|first=Richard|title=\"There's More Than One Way to Lose Your Heart\": the American film industry, early teen slasher films, and female youth.\"|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&sort=DA-SORT&inPS=true&prodId=GPS&userGroupName=mtlib_1_1123&tabID=T002&searchId=R2&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&contentSegment=&searchType=BasicSearchForm\u00a4tPosition=4&contentSet=GALE%7CA277106285&&docId=GALE%7cA277106285&docType=GALE&role=AONE|publisher=Cinema Journal|accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref> This idea is no longer prevalent in horror films, as women have become not only the main audience and fans of horror films but also the main protagonists of contemporary horror films.<ref name=Spines>{{cite web|last=Spines|first=Christine|title=Chicks dig scary movies.|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2009/07/24/chicks-dig-scary-movies|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref> Movie makers have also begun to integrate topics more broadly associated with other genres into their films in order to grow audience appeal.<ref name=Nowell />\n\nMany early horror films created great social and legal [[controversy]]. In the U.S., the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] which was implemented in 1930, set moral guidelines for film content, restraining movies containing controversial themes, graphic violence, explicit sexuality and/or nudity. The gradual abandonment of the Code, and its eventual formal repeal in 1968 (when it was replaced by the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA film rating system]]) offered more freedom to the movie industry. Nevertheless, controversy continued to surround horror movies, and many continued to face [[censorship]] issues around the world. For example, 1978's ''[[I Spit on Your Grave]]'', an American [[rape and revenge film|rape-and-revenge]] [[exploitation film|exploitation]] horror film written, co-produced, directed, and edited by [[Meir Zarchi]], was received negatively by critics, but it attracted a great deal of national and international attention due to its explicit scenes of rape, murder and prolonged nudity, which led to bans in countries such as Ireland, Norway, Iceland, and West Germany. Many of these countries later removed the ban, but the film remains prohibited in Ireland.<ref>Clarke, Donald (29 September 2010).

Horror movies tend to be a vessel for showing eras of audiences issues across the globe visually and in the most effective manner. Jeanne Hall, a film theorist, agrees with the use of horror films in easing the process of understanding issues by making use of their optical elements.<ref name=Lizardi>{{cite web|last=Lizardi|first=Ryan|title=Hegemony and Misogyny in the Contemporary Slasher Remake|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/pdf23_24/pdf/2010/JFT/01Sep10/53843762.pdf?T=P&P=AN&K=53843762&S=R&D=f3h&EbscoContent=dGJyMNHX8kSep7I4v%2BbwOLCmr0qeqK9Srq%2B4SLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGutk%2BuqLZLuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA|publisher=Journal of Popular Film and Television}}</ref> The use of horror films to help audiences understand international prior historical events occurs, for example, to depict the horrors of the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Holocaust]] and the worldwide [[AIDS epidemic]].<ref name=\"History Horror\">{{cite book|last=Heller-Nicholas|first=Alexandra|title=History and Horror|publisher=Screen Education}}</ref> However, horror movies do not always present positive endings.

The group's name is a reference to the [[H.G. Wells]] novel ''[[The Island of Dr. Moreau]]'', a reference carried further by the naming of their 2011 tour \"He Who Breaks the Law\". The group is best known for its 1992 [[hit single]] \"[[Jump Around]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;3 in their native United States, No.&nbsp;6 in Ireland and No.&nbsp;8 in the United Kingdom. The group broke up in 1996 but reformed in 2010, after the trio had been members of [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[La Coka Nostra]] for several years.\n\n==Band history==\n===Rise to fame (1991\u20131993)===\n[[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]] teamed up with [[DJ Lethal]] and high school friend [[Danny Boy (rapper)|Danny Boy]] in Los Angeles to form House of Pain.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book|first= Martin C.|last=Strong|year=2000|title=The Great Rock Discography|edition=5th|publisher=Mojo Books|location=Edinburgh|pages=462\u2013463|isbn=1-84195-017-3}}</ref> They attended [[William Howard Taft Charter High School|Taft High School]]. The group was signed to [[Tommy Boy Records]] and their 1992 debut album ''[[House of Pain (album)|Fine Malt Lyrics]]'' went [[Recording Industry Association of America certification|multi-platinum]], spawning the successful [[DJ Muggs]]-produced single \"[[Jump Around]]\". This song was also [[remix]]ed twice by [[Pete Rock]], one version featuring a verse from him and one without. The album also featured [[Cypress Hill]] member [[B-Real]] on the song \"Put Your Head Out\" and [[Funkdoobiest]]'s [[Son Doobie]] on 'House and the Rising Son', both members of the musical collective known as [[Soul Assassins]].\n\nFashioning themselves as rowdy [[Irish Americans|Irish-American]] hooligans (although Lethal is [[Latvian Americans|Latvian American]]), they toured with various rap and alternative-rock bands after their breakthrough.

On the release date of the album, Everlast announced his departure from the group.\n\n===Split, solo and current affairs (1997\u20132009)===\nFrom then on, the members continued their separate careers. Danny Boy founded an art company. DJ Lethal became a member of [[nu metal]] band [[Limp Bizkit]], who would [[cover version|cover]] \"Jump Around\" at live concerts, particularly in Limp Bizkit's early years during the [[Family Values Tour 1998]]. Everlast achieved multi-platinum solo fame in 1998 with his album ''[[Whitey Ford Sings the Blues]].''<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The first single from that album was \"[[What It's Like]]\". In 2000, a feud between Everlast and rapper [[Eminem]] coincided with the gold-selling ''[[Eat at Whitey's]]'', which included minor hits \"[[Black Jesus (song)|Black Jesus]]\" and \"Black Coffee\", and featured a collaboration with [[Carlos Santana]]. After the sale of the Tommy Boy Records' master tapes to [[Warner Bros. Records]], Everlast signed with [[The Island Def Jam Music Group|Island/Def Jam]], and released his ''[[White Trash Beautiful]]'' LP in 2004.\n\nLater the same year [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]], a subdivision of Warner Music, released a hit collection, ''[[Shamrocks & Shenanigans]]'', with singles from Everlast's early solo days, the House of Pain and his post-group solo efforts. Before the release, Everlast announced on his official message board that he was not endorsing the [[compilation album]].\n\nFounded by Danny Boy in early 2006, [[La Coka Nostra]] reunited him, Everlast and DJ Lethal for the first time since House of Pain's split.

For example, in each [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] the role is fulfilled by the [[lieutenant governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]], whereas in most [[British Overseas Territories]] the powers and duties are performed by the [[British Overseas Territories#Head of State|Governor]]. The same applies to [[Governors of the Australian states|Australian states]], [[Governors of states of India|Indian states]], etc. Hong Kong's constitutional document, the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], for example, specifies the [[Chief Executive (Hong Kong)|Chief Executive]] as the head of the special administrative region, in addition to his role as the head of government. These non-sovereign-state heads, nevertheless, have limited or no role in diplomatic affairs, depending on the status and the norms and practices of the territories concerned.\n\n===Parliamentary system===<!-- This section is linked from [[Austria]] -->\n[[File:Forms of government parliamentary.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|World's parliamentary states, as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, coloured by form of government<br>Green = republics with an executive president elected by a parliament<br>Orange = parliamentary republics<br>Red =   parliamentary constitutional monarchies in which the monarch does not personally exercise power]]\n\n====Standard model====\nIn [[parliamentary system]]s the head of state may be merely the nominal [[chief executive officer]], heading the [[executive branch]] of the state, and possessing limited executive power. In reality, however, following a process of constitutional evolution, powers are usually only exercised by direction of a [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]], presided over by a [[head of government]] who is answerable to the legislature. This accountability and legitimacy requires that someone be chosen who has a majority support in the [[legislature]] (or, at least, not a majority opposition \u2013 a subtle but important difference). It also gives the legislature the right to vote down the head of [[Forms of government|government]] and their cabinet, forcing it either to resign or seek a parliamentary dissolution. The [[Responsible government|executive branch is thus said to be responsible]] (or answerable) to the legislature, with the head of government and cabinet in turn accepting constitutional responsibility for offering constitutional [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] to the head of state.\n\nIn parliamentary [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], the legitimacy of the unelected head of state typically derives from the tacit approval of the people via the elected representatives. Accordingly, at the time of the [[Glorious Revolution]], the [[Parliament of England|English parliament]] acted of its own authority to name a new king and queen (the joint monarchs [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] and [[William III of England|William III]]); likewise, [[Edward VIII]]'s abdication required the approval of each of the six independent realms of which he was monarch. In monarchies with a written constitution, the position of monarch is a creature of the constitution and could quite properly be abolished through a democratic procedure of constitutional amendment, although there are often significant procedural hurdles imposed on such a procedure (as in the [[Constitution of Spain]]).\n\nIn republics with a parliamentary system (such as India, Germany, Austria, Italy and Israel) the head of state is usually titled ''[[president]]'' and the principal functions of such presidents are mainly ceremonial and symbolic, as opposed to the presidents in a presidential or semi-presidential system.\n[[File:Pranab Mukherjee-World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2009 crop(2).jpg|thumb|left|upright|President [[Pranab Mukherjee]], head of state of [[the Republic of India]] from July 2012 to July 2017]]\n\nIn reality, numerous variants exist to the position of a head of state within a parliamentary system. The older the constitution, the more constitutional leeway tends to exist for a head of state to exercise greater powers over government, as many older parliamentary system constitutions in fact give heads of state powers and functions akin to presidential or semi-presidential systems, in some cases without containing reference to modern democratic principles of accountability to parliament or even to modern governmental offices. Usually, the king had the power of declaring war without previous consent of the parliament.\n\nFor example, under the 1848 constitution of the [[Italy|Kingdom of Italy]], the ''[[Statuto Albertino]]''\u2014the parliamentary approval to the government appointed by the king\u2014was customary, but not required by law. So, Italy had a de facto parliamentarian system, but a de jure \"presidential\" system.\n\nExamples of heads of state in parliamentary systems using greater powers than usual, either because of ambiguous constitutions or unprecedented national emergencies, include the decision by King [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III of the Belgians]] to surrender on behalf of his state to the invading German army in 1940, against the will of his government. Judging that his responsibility to the nation by virtue of his coronation oath required him to act, he believed that his government's decision to fight rather than surrender was mistaken and would damage Belgium. (Leopold's decision proved highly controversial. After [[World War II]], Belgium voted in a referendum to allow him back on the throne, but because of the ongoing controversy he ultimately abdicated.) The Belgian constitutional crisis in 1990, when the [[Baudouin of Belgium|head of state]] refused to sign into law a bill permitting abortion, was resolved by the cabinet assuming the power to promulgate the law while he was treated as \"unable to reign\" for twenty-four hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/05/world/belgian-king-unable-to-sign-abortion-law-takes-day-off.html|title=Belgian King, Unable to Sign Abortion Law, Takes Day Off|date=5 April 1990|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>Art. 93. \"Should the King find himself unable to reign, the ministers, having observed this inability, immediately summon the Chambers.

The constitution explicitly vests all executive power in the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]], who is chaired by the [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime minister]] (articles 65 and 66) and responsible to the [[National Diet|Diet]] (articles 67 and 69). The [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] is defined in the constitution as \"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people\" (article 1), and is generally recognized throughout the world as the Japanese head of state. Although the emperor formally [[Imperial Investiture|appoints]] the prime minister to office, article 6 of the constitution requires him to appoint the candidate \"as designated by the Diet\", without any right to decline appointment.

However, he or she has no access to documentation and all access to ministers goes through the [[Department of the Taoiseach]]. The president does, however, hold limited [[reserve powers]], such as referring a bill to the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] to test its constitutionality, which are used under the president's discretion.<ref name=ireland/>\n\nThe most extreme non-executive republican Head of State is the [[President of Israel]], which holds no reserve powers whatsoever. The least ceremonial powers held by the President are to appoint the [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]], to approve the dissolution of the [[Knesset]] made by the Prime Minister, and to pardon criminals or to commute their sentence.\n\n====Executive model====\n\nSome parliamentary republics (like [[South Africa]], [[Botswana]] and [[Suriname]]) have fused the roles of the head of state with the head of government (like in a presidential system), while having the sole executive officer, often called a president, being dependent on the Parliament's confidence to rule (like in a parliamentary system). While also being the leading symbol of the nation, the president in this system acts mostly as a prime minister, since the incumbent must be a member of the legislature at the time of the election, answer [[question time|question sessions]] in Parliament, avoid motions of no confidence, etc.\n\n===Semi-presidential systems===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F010324-0002, Flughafen K\u00f6ln-Bonn, Adenauer, de Gaulle-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles de Gaulle]], President and head of state of the [[French Fifth Republic]] (1959\u20131969)]]\n{{Main article|Semi-presidential system}}\nSemi-presidential systems combine features of presidential and parliamentary systems, notably (in the president-parliamentary subtype) a requirement that the government be answerable to both the president and the legislature. The [[Constitution of France|constitution]] of the [[Fifth French Republic]] provides for a [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]] who is chosen by the president, but who nevertheless must be able to gain support in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]]. Should a president be of one side of the political spectrum and the opposition be in control of the legislature, the president is usually obliged to select someone from the opposition to become prime minister, a process known as [[Cohabitation (government)|Cohabitation]]. President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], a Socialist, for example, was forced to cohabit with the [[Gaullism|neo-Gaullist]] (right wing) [[Jacques Chirac]], who became his prime minister from 1986 to 1988. In the French system, in the event of cohabitation, the president is often allowed to set the policy agenda in security and foreign affairs and the prime minister runs the domestic and economic agenda.\n\nOther countries evolve into something akin to a semi-presidential system or indeed a full presidential system. [[Weimar Germany]], for example, in its constitution provided for a popularly elected president with theoretically dominant executive powers that were intended to be exercised only in emergencies, and a cabinet appointed by him from the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], which was expected, in normal circumstances, to be answerable to the Reichstag. Initially, the President was merely a symbolic figure with the Reichstag dominant; however, persistent political instability, in which governments often lasted only a few months, led to a change in the power structure of the republic, with the president's emergency powers called increasingly into use to prop up governments challenged by critical or even hostile Reichstag votes. By 1932, power had shifted to such an extent that the German President, [[Paul von Hindenburg]], was able to dismiss a [[chancellor]] and select his own person for the job, even though the outgoing chancellor possessed the confidence of the Reichstag while the new chancellor did not. Subsequently, President von Hindenburg used his power to appoint [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor without consulting the Reichstag.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Presidential system===\n[[File:Washington (3).jpg|thumb|[[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States]], set the precedent for an executive head of state in republican systems of government<ref>Lifetime portrait (1796), known as the \"[[Lansdowne portrait]]\", includes spines of two books titled \"American Revolution\" and \"Constitution and Laws of the United States\".</ref>]]\n{{Main article|Presidential system}}\n\n''Note: The head of state in a \"presidential\" system may not actually hold the title of \"[[president]]\" - the name of the system refers to any head of state who actually governs and is not directly dependent on the [[legislature]] to remain in office.''\n\nSome constitutions or fundamental laws provide for a head of state who is not only in theory but in practice chief executive, operating separately from, and independent from, the legislature. This system is known as a \"presidential system\" and sometimes called the \"imperial model\", because the executive officials of the government are answerable solely and exclusively to a presiding, acting head of state, and is selected by and on occasion dismissed by the head of state without reference to the legislature. It is notable that some presidential systems, while not providing for collective executive accountability to the legislature, may require legislative approval for individuals prior to their assumption of cabinet office and empower the legislature to remove a president from office (for example, in the [[United States|United States of America]]). In this case the debate centers on confirming them into office, not removing them from office, and does not involve the power to reject or approve proposed cabinet members ''en bloc'', so it is not accountability in the sense understood in a parliamentary system.\n\n[[Presidential system]]s are a notable feature of constitutions in the [[Americas]], including those of [[President of Argentina|Argentina]], [[President of Brazil|Brazil]], [[President of Colombia|Colombia]], [[President of El Salvador|El Salvador]], [[President of Mexico|Mexico]] and [[President of Venezuela|Venezuela]]; this is generally attributed to the strong influence of the [[United States]] in the region, and as the [[United States Constitution]] served as an inspiration and model for the [[Latin American wars of independence]] of the early 19th century. Most presidents in such countries are selected by democratic means (popular direct or indirect election); however, like all other systems, the presidential model also encompasses people who become head of state by other means, notably through military dictatorship or ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'', as often seen in [[Latin America]]n, [[Middle East]]ern and other presidential regimes. Some of the characteristics of a presidential system (i.e., a strong dominant political figure with an executive answerable to them, not the legislature) can also be found among [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]], [[constitutional monarchy|parliamentary monarchies]] and [[single party]] (e.g., [[Communism|Communist]]) regimes, but in most cases of dictatorship, their stated constitutional models are applied in name only and not in political theory or practice.\n\nIn the 1870s in the United States, in the aftermath of the [[impeachment]] of President [[Andrew Johnson]] and his near-removal from office, it was speculated that the United States, too, would move from a presidential system to a semi-presidential or even parliamentary one, with the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] becoming the [[De facto|real]] center of government as a quasi-prime minister.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} This did not happen and the presidency, having been damaged by three late nineteenth and early twentieth century assassinations ([[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], [[James Garfield|Garfield]] and [[William McKinley|McKinley]]) and one impeachment (Johnson), reasserted its political dominance by the early twentieth century through such figures as [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]].\n\n===Single-party states===\nIn certain states under [[Marxism|Marxist]] constitutions of the [[Socialist state|constitutionally socialist state]] type inspired by the former [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) and its constitutive [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]], real political power belonged to the sole legal party.  In these states, there was no formal office of head of state, but rather the leader of the legislative branch was considered to be the closest common equivalent of a head of state as a [[natural person]]. In the Soviet Union this position carried such titles as ''Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR''; ''Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet''; and in the case of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] ''Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets'' (pre-1922), and ''Chairman of the [[Bureau of the Central Committee]] of the Russian SFSR'' (1956\u20131966). This position may or may not have been held by the [[de facto]] Soviet leader at the moment. For example, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] never headed the Supreme Soviet but was [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party]] (party leader) and [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Chairman of the Council of Ministers]] ([[head of government]]).\n\nThis may even lead to an institutional variability, as in [[North Korea]], where, after the presidency of party leader [[Kim Il-Sung]], the office was vacant for years. The late president was granted the posthumous title (akin to some ancient Far Eastern traditions to give posthumous names and titles to royalty) of ''\"[[Eternal President of the Republic|Eternal President]]\"''. All substantive power, as party leader, itself not formally created for four years, was inherited by his son [[Kim Jong Il]]. The post of president was formally replaced on 5 September 1998, for ceremonial purposes, by the office of Chairman of the Presidium of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]], while the party leader's post as [[First Chairman of the National Defence Commission of North Korea|Chairman of the National Defense Commission]] was simultaneously declared \"the highest post of the state\", not unlike [[Deng Xiaoping]] earlier in the [[People's Republic of China]].\n\n===Complications with categorization===\n[[File:Delhi durbar 1911 2.jpg|thumb|[[George V]], Emperor of India, and Empress Mary at the [[Delhi Durbar]], 1911.]]\n\nWhile clear categories do exist, it is sometimes difficult to choose which category some individual heads of state belong to. In reality, the category to which each head of state belongs is assessed not by theory but by practice.\n\nConstitutional change in [[Liechtenstein]] in 2003 gave its head of state, the [[Prince of Liechtenstein|Reigning Prince]], constitutional powers that included a veto over legislation and power to dismiss the [[List of heads of government of Liechtenstein|head of government]] and cabinet.<ref name=liechtenstein>[http://www.icla.up.ac.za/images/un/use-of-force/western-europe-others/Liechtenstein/Constitution%20Liechtenstein%202009.pdf Constitution of the Principality of Liechtenstein (LR 101)] (2009).

Similarly the original powers given to the [[List of Presidents of Greece|Greek President]] under the [[Constitution of Greece|1974 Hellenic Republic constitution]] moved [[Greece]] closer to the French semi-presidential model.\n\nAnother complication exists with [[South Africa]], in which the [[President of South Africa|President]] is in fact elected by the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] ([[legislature]]) and is thus similar, in principle, to a [[head of government]] in a [[parliamentary system]] but is also, in addition, recognized as the head of state.<ref name=\"south africa\">[http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/constitution/SAConstitution-web-eng.pdf Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996], [[Department of Justice and Constitutional Development]] (2009).

However, the [[List of heads of state of Panama|elected civilian presidents]] were effectively figureheads with real political power being exercised by the chief of the [[Panamanian Public Forces|Panamanian Defense Forces]].\n\nHistorically, at the time of the [[League of Nations]] (1920\u20131946) and the founding of the [[United Nations]] (1945), [[British India|India's]] head of state was the monarch of the United Kingdom, ruling directly or indirectly as [[Emperor of India]] through the [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy and Governor-General]] of India.\n\n==Roles==\n{{multiple image\n | footer = [[Coronation]] ceremony: [[List of monarchs of Thailand|King]] [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] at his coronation on 5 May 1950 (left), and Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]] in her coronation portrait [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|on 2 June 1953]].\n | image1 = King Rama IX being presented with regalia at coronation.jpg\n | width1 = 180\n | image2 = Elizabeth and Philip 1953.jpg\n | width2 = 170\n}}\nHead of state is the highest-ranking constitutional position in a sovereign state.  A head of state has some or all of the roles listed below, often depending on the constitutional category (above), and does not necessarily regularly exercise the most power or influence of governance.  There is usually a formal public ceremony when a person becomes head of state, or some time after. This may be the swearing in at the [[inauguration]] of a president of a republic, or the [[coronation]] of a monarch.\n\n===Symbolic role===\nOne of the most important roles of the modern head of state is being a living [[national symbol]] of the state; in hereditary monarchies this extends to the monarch being a symbol of the unbroken continuity of the state. For instance, the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]] is described by the government as being the [[Monarchy of Canada#Personification of the Canadian state|personification of the Canadian state]] and is described by the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] as the \"personal symbol of allegiance, unity and authority for all Canadians\".<ref name=Heritage>{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/eng/1363187221658|title=The Crown in Canada|accessdate=31 August 2014|publisher=[[Department of Canadian Heritage]]|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/Canada/TheQueensroleinCanada.aspx The Queen's role in Canada], [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]]. Retrieved on 2 November 2012.</ref>\n\nIn many countries, official [[portrait]]s of the head of state can be found in government offices, courts of law, even airports, libraries, and other public buildings. The idea, sometimes regulated by law, is to use these portraits to make the public aware of the symbolic connection to the government, a practice that dates back to medieval times. Sometimes this practice is taken to excess, and the head of state becomes the principal symbol of the nation, resulting in the emergence of a [[personality cult]] where the image of the head of state is the only visual representation of the country, surpassing other symbols such as the [[flag]].\n\nOther common representations are on [[coin]]s, [[Postage stamp|postage and other stamps]] and [[banknote]]s, sometimes by no more than a mention or signature; and public places, streets, monuments and institutions such as schools are named for current or previous heads of state. In monarchies (e.g., Belgium) there can even be a practice to attribute the adjective \"royal\" on demand based on existence for a given number of years. However, such political techniques can also be used by leaders without the formal rank of head of state, even party - and other revolutionary leaders without formal state mandate.\n\nHeads of state often greet important foreign visitors, particularly visiting heads of state. They assume a host role during a [[state visit]], and the programme may feature playing of the [[national anthem]]s by a [[military band]], inspection of [[Guard of honour|military troops]], official exchange of gifts, and attending a [[state dinner]] at the [[official residence]] of the host.\n\nAt home, heads of state are expected to render luster to various occasions by their presence, such as by attending artistic or sports performances or competitions (often in a theatrical honor box, on a platform, on the front row, at the honours table), expositions, [[National Day|national day celebrations]], dedication events, military parades and war remembrances, prominent funerals, visiting different parts of the country and people from different walks of life, and at times performing symbolic acts such as [[Ribbon-cutting ceremony|cutting a ribbon]], [[groundbreaking]], [[Ship naming and launching|ship christening]], laying the first stone. Some parts of national life receive their regular attention, often on an annual basis, or even in the form of official patronage.\n\nThe [[Olympic Charter]] (rule 55.3) of the [[International Olympic Committee]] states that the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic summer]] and [[Winter Olympic Games|winter games]] shall be [[List of people who have opened the Olympic Games|opened by]] the head of state of the host nation, by uttering a single formulaic phrase as determined by the charter.<ref>[https://stillmed.olympic.org/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/General/EN-Olympic-Charter.pdf Olympic Charter: in force as of 2 August 2016], [[International Olympic Committee]] (August 2016). Retrieved on 13 September 2016.</ref>\n\nAs such invitations may be very numerous, such duties are often in part [[delegation|delegated]] to such persons as a spouse, a [[head of government]] or a [[cabinet minister]] or in other cases (possibly as a message, for instance, to distance themselves without rendering offense) just a military officer or civil servant.\n\nFor non-executive heads of state there is often a degree of censorship by the politically responsible government (such as the [[head of government]]). This means that the government discreetly approves agenda and speeches, especially where the constitution (or customary law) assumes all political responsibility by granting the crown inviolability (in fact also imposing political emasculation) as in the [[Kingdom of Belgium]] from its very beginning; in a monarchy this may even be extended to some degree to other members of the dynasty, especially the heir to the throne.\n\nBelow follows a list of examples from different countries of general provisions in law, which either designate an office as head of state or define its general purpose.\n\n::''Example 1 (parliamentary monarchy):'' Section 56 (1) of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] states:\n:::''The [[Monarchy of Spain|King]] is the Head of State, the symbol of its unity and permanence.

The head of state will, regardless of actual authority, perform ceremonial duties related to the country's armed forces, and will sometimes appear in military uniform for these purposes; particularly in monarchies where also the monarch's consort and other members of a [[royal family]] may also appear in military garb. This is generally the only time a head of state of a stable, democratic country will appear dressed in such a manner, as statesmen and public are eager to assert the [[civilian control of the military|primacy of (civilian, elected) politics over the armed forces]].\n\nIn [[military dictatorship]]s, or governments which have arisen from [[coups d'\u00e9tat]], the position of commander-in-chief is obvious, as all authority in such a government derives from the application of military force; occasionally a power vacuum created by war is filled by a head of state stepping beyond his or her normal constitutional role, as King [[Albert I of Belgium]] did during [[World War I]]. In these and in revolutionary regimes, the head of state, and often [[executive minister]]s whose offices are legally civilian, will frequently appear in military uniform.\n\n::''Example 1 (parliamentary monarchy):'' Article III, Section 15 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], a part of the [[Constitution of Canada]], states:\n:::''The Command-in-Chief of the [[Canadian Armed Forces|Land and Naval Militia, and of all Naval and Military Forces, of and in Canada]], is hereby declared to continue to be vested in the [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ca_1867.html|title=The Constitution Act, 1867|publisher=}}</ref>\n::''Example 2 (parliamentary monarchy):'' Article 25 of the [[Constitution of Norway]] states:\n:::''The [[Monarchy of Norway|King]] is Commander-in-Chief of the [[Norwegian Armed Forces|land and naval forces of the Realm]].

Even in presidential systems the head of state often formally reports to the legislature on the present national status, [[Exempli gratia|e.g.]] the [[State of the Union address]] in the United States of America.\n\nMost countries require that all [[bill (proposed law)|bill]]s passed by the house or houses of the legislature be signed into law by the head of state. In some states, such as the United Kingdom, Belgium and Ireland, the head of state is, in fact, formally considered a tier of the legislature. However, in most parliamentary systems, the head of state cannot refuse to sign a bill, and, in granting a bill their assent, indicate that it was passed in accordance with the correct procedures. The signing of a bill into law is formally known as ''[[promulgation]]''. Some monarchical states call this procedure ''[[royal assent]]''.\n\n::''Example 1 (non-executive parliamentary monarchy):'' Chapter 1, Article 4 of the [[Constitution of Sweden|Swedish ''Riksdag Act'']] provides that:\n:::''The formal opening of a [[Riksdag of Sweden|Riksdag]] session takes place at a special meeting of the Chamber held no later than the third day of the session.

In other systems there are usually fixed terms, but the head of state retains authority to dissolve the legislature in certain circumstances.

[[Thomas Hobbes]] in his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) used the term ''Sovereign''. In [[Europe]] the role of a monarchs has gradually transitioned from that of a sovereign ruler{{mdash}}in the sense of [[Divine Right of Kings]] as articulated by [[Jean Bodin]], [[Absolute monarchy|Absolutism]] and the \"[[L'etat c'est moi]]\"{{mdash}}to that of a constitutional monarch; parallel with the conceptual evolution of [[sovereignty]] from merely the personal rule of a single person, to [[Westphalian sovereignty]] ([[Peace of Westphalia]] ending both the [[Thirty Years' War]] & [[Eighty Years' War]]) and [[popular sovereignty]] as in [[consent of the governed]]; as shown in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 in [[England]] & [[Scotland]], the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, and the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]]. The monarchies who survived through this era were the ones who were willing to subject themselves to constitutional limitations. Titles commonly used by monarchs are [[King]]/[[Queen Regnant|Queen]] or [[Emperor]]/[[Empress]], but also many other; e.g., [[Grand Duke]], [[Prince]], [[Emir]] and [[Sultan]].\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"210\" heights=\"200\" caption=\"European writers of 16th and 17th centuries\">\nFile:Machiavelli Principe Cover Page.jpg|Title page of 1550 Italian edition of Machiavelli's ''The Prince''\nFile:Albergati Discorsi politici.jpg|Bodin named on title page of ''Discorsi politici'' (1602) by [[Fabio Albergati]] who compared Bodin's  political theories unfavourably with those of Aristotle\nFile:Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes.jpg|Frontispiece of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]] (1651)''\n</gallery>\n\n===Shared and substitute heads of state===\n\n====Interim====\nWhenever a head of state is not available for any reason, constitutional provisions may allow the role to fall temporarily to an assigned person or collective body. In a republic, this is - depending on provisions outlined by the constitution or improvised - a [[vice president]], the chief of government, the legislature or its presiding officer. In a monarchy, this is usually a [[regent]] or collegial regency (council). For example, in the United States the Vice President acts when the President is incapacitated, and in the United Kingdom the Queen's powers may be delegated to [[Counsellor of State|Counselors of State]] when she is abroad or unavailable.\n\n====Shared====\nIn some countries where there is no resident head of state, such as [[Andorra]], a local representative is appointed. In the case of [[Andorra]], two [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|co-princes]] act as the principality's heads of state; one is also simultaneously the [[President of France]], residing in France, and the other is the [[Diocese of Urgell|Bishop of Urgell]], residing in [[Spain]]. Each co-prince is represented in Andorra by a delegate, though these persons hold no formal title.\n\n====Extraordinary arrangements====\nIn exceptional situations, such as war, occupation, revolution or a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], constitutional institutions, including the symbolically crucial head of state, may be reduced to a figurehead or be suspended in favor of an emergency office (such as the original Roman [[Dictator]]) or eliminated by a new \"provisionary\" regime, such as a collective of the [[Military dictatorship|junta]] type, or removed by an occupying force, such as a [[Military occupation|military governor]] (an early example being the [[Sparta]]n [[Harmost]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\n===Religious heads of state===\n[[File:Pope Francis in March 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pope Francis|Francis]], from March 2013 the [[List of sovereigns of Vatican City State|sovereign of the Vatican City State]], an ''ex officio'' role of the [[Pope]]]]\n\nSince [[ancient history|antiquity]], various [[dynasty|dynasties]] or individual rulers have claimed the right to rule by divine authority, such as the [[Mandate of Heaven]] and the [[divine right of kings]]. Some monarchs even claimed divine ancestry, such as Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s and [[Sapa Inca]]s, who claimed descent from their respective sun gods and often sought to maintain this bloodline by practicing [[incest|incestuous marriage]]. In [[Ancient Rome]], during the [[Principate]], the title {{lang|la|divus}} ('divine') was conferred (notably posthumously) on the [[Roman emperor|emperor]], a symbolic, [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimating]] element in establishing a [[de facto]] dynasty.\n\n====Christianity====\nIn [[Roman Catholicism]], the [[pope]] was once sovereign pontiff and head of state, first, of the politically important [[Papal States]]. After [[Italian unification]], the pope remains head of state of [[Vatican City]]. Furthermore, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell|Bishop of Urgell]] is ''[[ex officio]]'' one of the two [[Co-Princes of Andorra]]. In the [[Church of England]], the reigning monarch holds the title [[Fidei defensor#English usage|Defender of the Faith]] and acts as Supreme Governor of the Church of England, although this is purely a symbolic role.\n\n====Islam====\n[[File:Portrait Caliph Abdulmecid II.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abdulmecid II]] is the [[List of Caliphs|150th]] and last [[Caliph of Islam]] from [[Ottoman dynasty]]]]\nDuring the [[History of Islam|early period of Islam]], [[caliph]]s were spiritual and temporal absolute successors of the Prophet [[Mohammed]]. Various political Muslim leaders since have styled themselves ''Caliph'' and served as dynastic heads of state, sometimes in addition to another title, such as the [[Ottoman Sultan]]. Historically, some [[Theocracy|theocratic]] Islamic states known as ''[[imamates]]'' have been led by [[imam]]s as head of state, such as in what is now [[Oman]], [[Yemen]], and [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nIn the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]], at present [[Ali Khamenei]] serves as [[List of heads of state of Iran|head of state]]. The [[Aga Khan]]s, a unique dynasty of temporal/religious leadership, leading an offshoot of [[Shia Islam]] in Central and South Asia, once ranking among British India's [[princely state]]s, continue to the present day.\n\n====Hinduism====\nIn [[Hinduism]], certain dynasties adopted a title expressing their positions as \"servant\" of a patron deity of the state, but in the sense of a [[viceroy]] under an absentee [[god-king]], ruling \"in the name of\" the patron god(ess), such as [[Patmanabha Dasa]] (servant of Vishnu) in the case of the [[Maharaja]] of [[Travancore]].\n\n====Buddhism====\nFrom the time of the [[5th Dalai Lama]] until the political retirement of the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in 2011, Dalai Lamas were both political and spiritual leaders (\"god-king\") of [[Tibet]].\n\n[[Outer Mongolia]], the former homeland of the imperial dynasty of [[Genghis Khan]], was another [[Tibetan Buddhist|lamaist]] theocracy from 1585, using various styles, such as [[tulku]]. The establishment of the [[Communism|Communist]] [[Mongolian People's Republic]] replaced this [[regime]] in 1924.\n\n===City states and crowned republics===\n* The [[polis]] in Greek Antiquity and the equivalent city states in the feudal era and later, (many in Italy, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the Moorish ''taifa'' in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], essentially tribal-type but urbanized regions throughout the world in the [[Maya civilization]], etc.) offer a wide spectrum of styles, either monarchic (mostly identical to homonyms in larger states) or republican, see [[Chief magistrate]].\n* [[Doge]]s were elected by their Italian aristocratic republics from a patrician nobility, but \"reigned\" as sovereign dukes.\n* The paradoxical term [[crowned republic]] refers to various state arrangements that combine \"republican\" and \"monarchic\" characteristics.\n* The [[Netherlands]] historically had officials called [[stadholder]]s and [[stadholder-general|stadholders-general]], titles meaning \"lieutenant\" or \"governor\", originally for the [[Habsburg]] monarchs.\n\n===Multiple or collective heads of state===\n\nA collective head of state can exist in republics (internal complexity), e.g., nominal [[triumvirate]]s, the [[Directoire]], the seven-member [[Swiss Federal Council]] (where each member acts in turn as president for one year), [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] with a three-member presidium from three different nations, [[San Marino]] with two \"Captains-regent\" which maintains the tradition of Italian medieval republics that had always had an even number of consuls.\n\nIn [[condominium (international law)|condominiums]], sovereignty is shared between two external powers, e.g., [[Andorra]] (president of [[France]] and bishop of [[Urgell]], [[Spain]], co-princes), and the former Anglo-French [[New Hebrides]] (each nation's head of state was represented by a high commissioner).\n\nIn the [[Roman Republic]] there were two heads of state, styled [[Consul]], both of whom alternated months of authority during their year in office, similarly there was an even number of supreme magistrates in the Italic republics of Ancient Age. In the [[History of Athens|Athenian Republic]] there were nine supreme magistrates, styled [[archons]]. In [[Carthage]] there were two supreme magistrates, styled kings or [[Shofet|suffetes]] (judges). In ancient [[Sparta]] there were two hereditary kings, belonging to two different dynasties. In the [[Soviet Union]] the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union|Central Executive Committee]] of the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union|Congress of Soviets]] (between 1922-1938) and later the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] (between 1938-1989) served as the [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|collective head of state]].<ref>{{cite book|author=John Alexander Armstrong|title=Ideology, Politics, and Government in the Soviet Union: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZH9nkBOxrZQC&pg=PA165|year=1978|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-8191-5405-7|page=165}}</ref> After World War II the Soviet model was subsequently adopted by almost all countries belonged to its [[Eastern Bloc|sphere of influence]].

Though beginning that year, a provisional constitution made the [[Kuomintang]] the sole government party and the National Government bound to the instructions of the Central Executive Committee of that party.\n\n===Unique cases and titles===\nThough [[president]] and various monarchichal titles are most commonly used for heads of state, in some nationalistic regimes, the leader adopts, formally or de facto, a unique style simply meaning \"leader\" in the national language, e.g., Germany's single [[NSDAP|national socialist party chief]] and combined head of state and government, [[Adolf Hitler]], as the ''[[F\u00fchrer]]'' between 1934 and 1945.\n\nIn 1959, when former [[United Kingdom|British]] crown colony [[Singapore]] gained self-government, it adopted the Malay style ''[[Yang di-Pertuan Negara]]'' (literally means \"head of state\" in [[Malay language|Malay]]) for its governor (the actual head of state remained the British monarch). The second and last incumbent of the office, [[Yusof bin Ishak]], kept the style at 31 August 1963 unilateral declaration of independence and after 16 September 1963 accession to [[Malaysia]] as a state (so now as a constituent part of the federation, a non-sovereign level). After its expulsion from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, Singapore became a sovereign [[republic within the Commonwealth|Commonwealth republic]] and installed Yusof bin Ishak as its first President.\n\nIn 1959 after the resignation of [[Vice President of Indonesia]] [[Mohammad Hatta]], [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Sukarno]] abolished the position and title of vice president, assuming the positions of Prime Minister and Head of Cabinet. He also proclaimed himself [[president for life]] ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Presiden Seumur Hidup Panglima Tertinggi''; \"''panglima''\" meaning \"commander or martial figurehead\", \"''tertinggi''\" meaning \"highest\"; roughly translated to English as \"Supreme Commander of the Revolution\"). He was praised as \"''Paduka Yang Mulia''\", a [[Malay titles|Malay honorific]] originally given to kings; Sukarno awarded himself titles in that fashion due to his noble ancestry.\n\nThere are also a few nations in which the exact title and definition of the office of head of state have been vague. During the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]], following the downfall of [[Liu Shaoqi]], who was [[Chairman of the People's Republic of China]], no successor was named, so the duties of the head of state were transferred collectively to the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]]. This situation was later changed: the Head of State of the PRC is now the [[President of the People's Republic of China]].\n\nIn North Korea, the late [[Kim Il-sung]] was named \"[[Eternal President]]\" 4 years after his death and the [[President of North Korea|presidency was abolished]]. As a result, some of the duties previously held by the President are constitutionally delegated to the Chairman of the Presidium of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]], who performs some of the roles of a Head of State, such as accrediting foreign ambassadors and undertaking overseas visits. However, the symbolic role of a Head of State is generally performed by [[Kim Jong-un]], who as the leader of the party and military, is the most powerful person in North Korea.\n\nThere is debate as to whether [[Samoa]] was an elective monarchy or an aristocratic republic, given the comparative ambiguity of the title ''[[O le Ao o le Malo]]'' and the nature of the head of state's office.\n\nIn some states the office of head of state is not expressed in a specific title reflecting that role, but constitutionally awarded to a post of another formal nature. Thus in March 1979 Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]], who kept absolute power (until his overthrow in 2011 referred to as  \"Guide of the Revolution\"), after ten years as combined Head of State and Head of government of the Libyan ''Jamahiriya'' (\"state of the masses\"), styled Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, formally transferred both qualities to the General secretaries of the General People's Congress (comparable to a Speaker) respectively to a Prime Minister, in political reality both were his creatures.\n\nSometimes a head of state assumes office as a state becomes legal and political reality, before a formal title for the highest office is determined; thus in the since 1 January 1960 independent republic [[Cameroon]] (''Cameroun'', a former French colony), the first President, [[Ahmadou Babatoura Ahidjo]], was at first not styled ''pr\u00e9sident'' but 'merely' known as ''chef d'\u00e9tat'' - (French 'head of state') until 5 May 1960. In [[Uganda]], [[Idi Amin]] the military leader after the coup of 25 January 1971 was formally styled ''military head of state'' till 21 February 1971, only from then on regular (but unconstitutional, not elected) president.\n\nIn certain cases a special style is needed to accommodate imperfect statehood, e.g., the title ''[[Sardar-i-Riyasat]]'' was used in Kashmir after its accession to India, and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] leader, [[Yasser Arafat]], was styled the first \"President of the [[Palestinian National Authority]]\" in 1994. In 2008, the same office was restyled as \"[[President of the State of Palestine]]\".<ref>{{cite|title=PLO body elects Abbas 'President of Palestine'|newspaper=Khaleej Times Online|date=24 November 2008|archivedate=8 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608080641/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/darticlen.asp?xfile=data%2Fmiddleeast%2F2008%2FNovember%2Fmiddleeast_November480.xml&section=middleeast|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/darticlen.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2008/November/middleeast_November480.xml&section=middleeast|deadurl=yes|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Legitimacy==\nThe position of head of state can be established in different ways, and with different sources of legitimacy.\n\n===By fiction or fiat===\nPower can come from force, but formal [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] is often established, even if only by fictitious claims of continuity (e.g., a forged claim of descent from a previous [[dynasty]]). There have been cases of sovereignty granted by deliberate act, even when accompanied by [[order of succession|orders of succession]] (as may be the case in a dynastic split). Such grants of sovereignty are usually forced, as is common with [[self-determination]] granted after [[Nationalism|nationalist]] revolts. This occurred with the last [[Attalid]] king of Hellenistic [[Pergamon]], who by testament left his realm to Rome to avoid a disastrous conquest.\n\n===By divine appointment===\nUnder a theocracy, perceived divine status translated into earthly authority under [[divine law]]. This can take the form of supreme divine authority above the state's, granting a tool for political influence to a [[priest]]hood. In this way, the [[Amun]] priesthood reversed the reforms of Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] after his death. The division of theocratic power can be disputed, as happened between the Pope and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in the [[investiture]] conflict when the temporal power sought to control key clergy nominations in order to guarantee popular support, and thereby his own legitimacy, by incorporating the formal ceremony of [[unction]] during [[coronation]].\n\n===By social contract===\nThe notion of a [[social contract]] holds that the nation\u2014either the whole people or the [[:wikt:electorate|electorate]]\u2014gives a mandate, through acclamation or [[election]].\n\n===By constitution===\nIndividual heads of state may acquire their position by virtue of a [[Constitution#Distribution of sovereignty|constitution]]. An example includes SFR [[Yugoslavia]] whose Constitution from 1974, article 333, stated that Federal Assembly can appoint namely [[Josip Broz Tito]] as the President of Republic without time limitation.<ref>https://hr.wikisource.org/wiki/Ustav_Socijalisti%C4%8Dke_Federativne_Republike_Jugoslavije_(1974.)#Glava_III_PREDSJEDNIK_REPUBLIKE</ref>\n\n===By hereditary succession===\n[[File:Firekonger.jpg|thumb|Four generations of [[List of Danish Monarchs|Danish kings]] in 1903: [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]] (left), [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian (X)]] (back), [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Frederick (VIII)]] (right), and [[Frederick IX of Denmark|Frederick (IX)]] (front)]]\n\nThe position of a monarch is usually [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary]], but in [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], there are usually restrictions on the incumbent's exercise of powers and prohibitions on the possibility of choosing a successor by other means than by birth. In a hereditary monarchy, the position of monarch is inherited according to a statutory or customary [[order of succession]], usually within one [[royal family]] tracing its origin through a historical [[dynasty]] or bloodline. This usually means that the heir to the throne is known well in advance of becoming monarch to ensure a smooth succession. However, many cases of uncertain succession in European history have often led to [[War of succession|wars of succession]].\n\n[[Primogeniture]], in which the eldest child of the monarch is first in line to become monarch, is the most common system in hereditary monarchy. The order of succession is usually affected by rules on gender. Historically \"agnatic primogeniture\" or \"patrilineal primogeniture\" was favoured, that is inheritance according to seniority of birth among the sons of a monarch or [[paterfamilias|head of family]], with sons and their male issue inheriting before brothers and their issue, and [[patrilineality|male-line]] males inheriting before females of the male line.<ref name=Murphy>{{cite web| last = Murphy| first = Michael Dean| title = A Kinship Glossary: Symbols, Terms, and Concepts| url = http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm| accessdate = 5 October 2006 }}</ref> This is the same as semi-Salic primogeniture. Complete exclusion of females from [[dynasty|dynastic]] succession is commonly referred to as application of the [[Salic law]] (see ''[[Terra salica]]'').\n\nBefore primogeniture was enshrined in European law and tradition, kings would often secure the succession by having their successor (usually their eldest son) crowned during their own lifetime, so for a time there would be two kings in [[coregency]] \u2013 a senior king and a junior king.  Examples include [[Henry the Young King]] of England and the early [[House of Capet|Direct Capetians]] in France.\n\nSometimes, however, primogeniture can operate through the female line. In some systems a female may rule as monarch only when the male line dating back to a common ancestor is exhausted.  In 1980, [[Sweden]], by rewriting its [[Swedish Act of Succession|1810 Act of Succession]], became the first European monarchy to declare equal (full cognatic) primogeniture, meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, whether female or male, ascends to the throne.<ref name=\"sweden as\">[http://www.riksdagen.se/Global/dokument/dokument/laws/the-act-of-succession-2012.pdf Swedish Act of Succession (English Translation as of 2012)], The [[Riksdag]]. Retrieved on 28 August 2013.</ref> Other European monarchies (such as the [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990 and [[Belgium]] in 1991) have since followed suit. Similar reforms [[2011 proposals to change the rules of royal succession in the Commonwealth realms|were proposed in 2011]] for the [[United Kingdom]] and the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, which came into effect in 2015 after having been approved by all of the affected nations. Sometimes [[religion]] is affected; under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] all [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and all persons who have married Roman Catholics are ineligible to be the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] and are skipped in the order of succession.\n\nIn some monarchies there may be liberty for the incumbent, or some body convening after his or her demise, to choose from eligible members of the [[Royal family|ruling house]], often limited to [[Legitimate child|legitimate]] descendants of the dynasty's founder. Rules of succession may be further limited by [[state religion]], residency, [[Royal intermarriage|equal marriage]] or even permission from the [[legislature]].\n\nOther hereditary systems of succession included [[tanistry]], which is semi-elective and gives weight to merit and [[Agnatic seniority]].  In some monarchies, such as [[King of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], succession to the throne usually first passes to the monarch's next eldest brother, and only after that to the monarch's children (agnatic seniority).\n\n===By election===\nElection usually is the constitutional way to choose the head of state of a republic, and some monarchies, either directly through popular election, indirectly by members of the legislature or of a special college of [[Indirect election|electors]] (such as the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] in the [[United States]]), or as an exclusive prerogative. Exclusive prerogative allows the heads of states of constituent monarchies of a federation to choose the head of state for the federation among themselves, as in the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Malaysia]]. The Pope, head of state of Vatican City, is chosen by previously appointed [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] under 80 years of age from among themselves in a [[papal conclave]].\n\n===By appointment===\nA head of state can be empowered to designate his successor, such as [[Lord Protector of the Commonwealth]] [[Oliver Cromwell]], who was succeeded by his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]].\n\n===By force or revolution===\nA head of state may seize power by force or [[revolution]]. This is not the same as the use of force to ''maintain'' power, as is practiced by [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] or [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] rulers. Dictators often use democratic titles, though some proclaim themselves monarchs. Examples of the latter include Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and King [[Zog of Albania]]. In Spain, general [[Francisco Franco]] adopted the formal title ''Jefe del Estado'', or Chief of State, and established himself as [[regent]] for a vacant monarchy. Uganda's [[Idi Amin]] was one of several who named themselves [[President for Life]].\n\n===By foreign imposition===\nA foreign power can establishing a branch of their own dynasty, or one friendly to their interests. This was the outcome of the [[Russo-Swedish War (1741\u20131743)|Russo-Swedish War from 1741 to 1743]] where the [[Elizabeth of Russia|Russian Empress]] made the imposition of her relative [[Adolf Frederick of Sweden|Adolf Frederick]] as the heir to the [[Monarchy of Sweden|Swedish Throne]], to succeed [[Frederick I of Sweden|Frederick I]] who lacked [[Legitimate child|legitimate]] issue, as a peace condition.\n\n===Loss===\nApart from violent overthrow, a head of state's position can be lost in several ways, including death, another by expiration of the constitutional term of office, [[abdication]], or resignation. In some cases, an abdication cannot occur unilaterally, but comes into effect only when approved by an act of parliament, as in the case of British King [[Edward VIII]]. The post can also be abolished by constitutional change; in such cases, an incumbent may be allowed to finish his or her term. Of course, a head of state position will cease to exist if the state itself does.\n\nHeads of state generally enjoy widest inviolability, although some states allow [[impeachment]], or a similar constitutional procedure by which the highest legislative or judicial authorities are empowered to revoke the head of state's mandate on exceptional grounds. This may be a common crime, a political sin, or an act by which he or she violates such provisions as an established religion mandatory for the monarch. By similar procedure, an original mandate may be declared invalid.\n\n==Former heads of state==\n[[File:Berlin Nationaldenkmal Kaiser Wilhelm 1900.jpg|thumb|The National Monument to [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]] in Berlin, Germany, dedicated 1897, nearly 10 years after his death.

[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] transformed the Italian principality of [[Elba]], where he was imprisoned, into a miniature version of his First Empire, with most trappings of a sovereign monarchy, until his ''[[Hundred Days|Cent Jours]]'' escape and reseizure of power in France convinced his opponents, reconvening the [[Congress of Vienna|Vienna Congress]] in 1815, to revoke his gratuitous privileges and send him to die in [[exile]] on barren [[Saint Helena]].\n\nBy tradition, deposed monarchs who have not freely abdicated continue to use their monarchical titles as a [[Courtesy title|courtesy]] for the rest of their lives. Hence, even after [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]] ceased to be ''[[King of the Hellenes]]'', it is still common to refer to the deposed king and his family as if they were still on the throne, as many European royal courts and households do in guest lists at royal weddings, as in [[Wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling|Sweden in 2010]], [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton|Britain in 2011]] and [[Wedding of Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and Countess St\u00e9phanie de Lannoy|Luxembourg in 2012]].<ref>[http://www.kungahuset.se/royalcourt/wedding/theweddingday/stockholmcathedral/guestsattheweddingceremony.4.40e05eec12926f2630480001312.html Guests at the wedding ceremony: Wedding between Crown Princess Victoria and Mr Daniel Westling on Saturday 19 June 2010, 3.30 p.m., at Stockholm Cathedral], [[Royal Court of Sweden]].

The Doctrine of Epigenesis and the Doctrine of Preformation were two distinct views of the understanding of heredity. The Doctrine of Epigenesis, originated by [[Aristotle]], claimed that an embryo continually develops. The modifications of the parent\u2019s traits are passed off to an embryo during its lifetime. The foundation of this doctrine was based on the theory of [[inheritance of acquired traits]]. In direct opposition, the Doctrine of Preformation claimed that \u201clike generates like\u201d where the germ would evolve to yield offspring similar to the parents. The Preformationist view believed procreation was an act of revealing what had been created long before. However, this was disputed by the creation of the [[cell theory]] in the 19th century, where the fundamental unit of life is the cell, and not some preformed parts of an organism. Various hereditary mechanisms, including [[blending inheritance]] were also envisaged without being properly tested or quantified, and were later disputed. Nevertheless, people were able to develop domestic breeds of animals as well as crops through artificial selection. The inheritance of acquired traits also formed a part of early Lamarckian ideas on evolution.\n\nDuring the 18th century, Dutch microscopist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632\u20131723) discovered \"animalcules\" in the sperm of humans and other animals.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.leben.us/index.php/component/content/article/59-volume-3-issue-4/236-antoni-van-leeuwenhoeks-amazing-little-animalcules | title=Antoni van Leeuwenhoek's Amazing Little \"Animalcules\" | publisher=Leben | accessdate=March 26, 2013 | author=Snow, Kurt | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424173741/http://www.leben.us/index.php/component/content/article/59-volume-3-issue-4/236-antoni-van-leeuwenhoeks-amazing-little-animalcules | archivedate=April 24, 2013 | df= }}</ref> Some scientists speculated they saw a \"little man\" ([[homunculus]]) inside each [[spermatozoon|sperm]].

The object of selection is the [[phenotype]] in its surrounding environment. The role of [[genetic drift]] is equivocal; though strongly supported initially by [[Dobzhansky]], it was downgraded later as results from ecological genetics were obtained.\n#The primacy of population thinking: the genetic diversity carried in natural populations is a key factor in evolution.

Thus pea plants with the pair of alleles '''''either''''' ''GG'' (homozygote) '''''or''''' ''Gg'' (heterozygote) will have green pods. The allele for yellow pods is recessive.

He was prolific in many genres, writing dozens of novels, short stories, and works of social commentary, satire, biography, and autobiography, including even two books on war games.

A [[futurist]], he wrote a number of utopian works and foresaw the advent of aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television and something resembling the World Wide Web.<ref>{{cite news|title=HG Wells: A visionary who should be remembered for his social predictions, not just his scientific ones|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/hg-wells-a-visionary-who-should-be-remembered-for-his-social-predictions-not-just-his-scientific-a7320486.html|publisher=The Independent|date=9 October 2017}}</ref> His science fiction imagined time travel, alien invasion, invisibility, and biological engineering.

Wells was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] four times.<ref name=\"Nobel nominations\"/>\n\nWells's earliest specialised training was in [[biology]], and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a specifically and fundamentally [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] context.<ref>Robert M. Philmus and David Y. Hughes, ed., ''H. G. Wells: Early Writings in Science and Science Fiction'' (Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London: University of California Press, 1975), p. 179.</ref> He was also from an early date an outspoken [[socialism|socialist]], often (but not always, as at the beginning of the [[First World War]]) sympathising with [[pacifism|pacifist]] views. His later works became increasingly political and [[didacticism|didactic]], and he wrote little science fiction, while he sometimes indicated on official documents that his profession was that of journalist.<ref>Vincent Brome, ''H. G. Wells: A Biography'' (London, New York, and Toronto: Longmans, Green, 1951).</ref> Novels such as ''[[Kipps]]'' and ''[[The History of Mr Polly]]'', which describe lower-middle-class life, led to the suggestion that he was a worthy successor to [[Charles Dickens]],<ref>Vincent Brome, ''H. G. Wells: A Biography'' (London, New York, and Toronto: Longmans, Green, 1951), p. 99.</ref> but Wells described a range of social strata and even attempted, in ''[[Tono-Bungay]]'' (1909), a diagnosis of [[English society]] as a whole. A diabetic, Wells co-founded the charity The Diabetic Association (known today as [[Diabetes UK]]) in 1934.\n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\nHerbert George Wells was born at Atlas House, 162 High Street in [[Bromley]], [[Kent]],<ref name=\"Francis\">{{cite book |last=Wells |first=H.

An inheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold china and sporting goods, although it failed to prosper: the stock was old and worn out, and the location was poor. Joseph Wells managed to earn a meagre income, but little of it came from the shop and he received an unsteady amount of money from playing [[Amateur and professional cricketers|professional cricket]] for the [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent county team]].<ref name=\"Smith\">Smith, David C.

Yale University Press, New Haven and London {{ISBN|0-300-03672-8}}</ref> Payment for skilled bowlers and batsmen came from voluntary donations afterwards, or from small payments from the clubs where matches were played.\n\nA defining incident of young Wells's life was an accident in 1874 that left him bedridden with a broken leg.<ref name=Parrinder/> To pass the time he began to read books from the local library, brought to him by his father. He soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access; they also stimulated his desire to write. Later that year he entered Thomas Morley's Commercial Academy, a [[private school]] founded in 1849, following the bankruptcy of Morley's earlier school. The teaching was erratic, the curriculum mostly focused, Wells later said, on producing [[Copperplate script|copperplate handwriting]] and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen. Wells continued at Morley's Academy until 1880. In 1877, his father, Joseph Wells, suffered a fractured thigh. The accident effectively put an end to Joseph's career as a cricketer, and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sep. 21, 1866: Wells Springs Forth|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/09/0921hg-wells-birthday/|publisher=Wired|date=9 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Uppark-Sfront-01.jpg|thumb|left|Wells spent the winter of 1887/88 convalescing at [[Uppark]], where his mother, Sarah, was housekeeper.<ref name=Pevsner>{{cite book |last=Nairn |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Nairn |author2=Pevsner, Nikolaus |authorlink2=Nikolaus Pevsner  |title=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]]: Sussex |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=Harmondsworth |year=1965 |isbn=0-14-071028-0 |pages=358\u201360}}</ref>]]\nNo longer able to support themselves financially, the family instead sought to place their sons as [[apprenticeship|apprentice]]s in various occupations.<ref>{{cite news|title=HG Wells: prophet of free love|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/11/hg-wells-david-lodge|publisher=The Guardian|date=11 October 2017}}</ref> From 1880 to 1883, Wells had an unhappy apprenticeship as a [[draper]] at the [[Southsea]] Drapery Emporium, Hyde's.<ref name=\"GHW1925\" /> His experiences at Hyde's, where he worked a thirteen-hour day and slept in a dormitory with other apprentices,<ref name=\"Francis\"/> later inspired his novels ''[[The Wheels of Chance]]'', ''[[The History of Mr Polly]]'', and ''[[Kipps]]'', which portray the life of a draper's apprentice as well as providing a critique of society's distribution of wealth.<ref>{{cite book |last=Batchelor |first=John |title=H.

He also wrote realistic novels that received critical acclaim, including ''[[Kipps]]'' and a critique of English culture during the Edwardian period, ''[[Tono-Bungay]]''. Wells also wrote dozens of short stories and novellas, including, \"The Flowering of the Strange Orchid\", which helped bring the full impact of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s revolutionary botanical ideas to a wider public, and was followed by many later successes such as \"[[The Country of the Blind]]\" (1904).<ref>[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10359900&fulltextType=RA&fileId=S0007087416000352 \"British Journal for the History of Science\"].

Gunn (writer)|James Gunn]], one of Wells's major contributions to the science fiction genre was his approach, which he referred to as his \"new system of ideas\".<ref>[http://www.sfcenter.ku.edu/tomorrow.htm The Man Who Invented Tomorrow] In 1902, when [[Arnold Bennett]] was writing a long article for ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' about Wells as a serious writer, Wells expressed his hope that Bennett would stress his \"new system of ideas\". Wells developed a theory to justify the way he wrote (he was fond of theories), and these theories helped others write in similar ways.</ref> In his opinion, the author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible, even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible, allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really happen, today referred to as \"the plausible impossible\" and \"[[suspension of disbelief]]\". While neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction, Wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with. He conceived the idea of using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term \"time machine\", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle.<ref name=\"McFarland\"/> He explained that while writing ''The Time Machine'', he realized that \"the more impossible the story I had to tell, the more ordinary must be the setting, and the circumstances in which I now set the [[Time travel|Time Traveller]] were all that I could imagine of solid upper-class comforts.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.writework.com/book-guides/the-time-machine-h-g-wells/scientists-and-gentlemen|title=The Time Machine - Scientists and Gentlemen   - WriteWork|website=www.writework.com}}</ref> In \"Wells's Law\", a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption. Being aware the notion of magic as something real had disappeared from society, he, therefore, used scientific ideas and theories as a substitute for magic to justify the impossible. Wells's best-known statement of the \"law\" appears in his introduction to ''The Scientific Romances of H.G. Wells'' (1933),\n\n<blockquote>\"As soon as the magic trick has been done the whole business of the fantasy writer is to keep everything else human and real. Touches of prosaic detail are imperative and a rigorous adherence to the hypothesis. Any extra fantasy outside the cardinal assumption immediately gives a touch of irresponsible silliness to the invention.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=D.

Wells {{Circa}} 1918|right]]\nFrom quite early in Wells's career, he sought a better way to organise society and wrote a number of [[Utopia]]n novels. The first of these was ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'' (1905), which shows a worldwide utopia with \"no imports but meteorites, and no exports at all\";<ref>''A Modern Utopia''</ref> two travellers from our world fall into its [[alternate history]]. The others usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe, until people realise a better way of living: whether by mysterious gases from a [[comet]] causing people to behave rationally and abandoning a European war (''[[In the Days of the Comet]]'' (1906)), or a world council of scientists taking over, as in ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' (1933, which he later adapted for the 1936 [[Alexander Korda]] film, ''[[Things to Come]]''). This depicted, all too accurately, the impending [[World War II|World War]], with cities being destroyed by aerial bombs. He also portrayed the rise of [[fascism|fascist]] dictators in ''The Autocracy of Mr Parham'' (1930) and ''The Holy Terror'' (1939). ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923) is also a utopian novel. Wells in this period was regarded as an enormously influential figure; the critic [[Malcolm Cowley]] stated: \"by the time he was forty, his influence was wider than any other living English writer\".<ref>Cowley, Malcolm. \"Outline of Wells's History.\" ''[[The New Republic]]'' Vol. 81 Issue 1041, 14 November 1934 (pp. 22\u201323).</ref>\n\nWells contemplates the ideas of [[nature and nurture]] and questions humanity in books such as ''The Island of Doctor Moreau''. Not all his scientific romances ended in a Utopia, and Wells also wrote a [[dystopia]]n novel, ''[[When the Sleeper Wakes]]'' (1899, rewritten as ''The Sleeper Awakes'', 1910), which pictures a future society where the classes have become more and more separated, leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers.<ref>William Steinhoff, \"Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on ''1984''\" 153, in Eric S.

The narrator, having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected (unsuccessfully) into human beings, eventually returns to England; like [[Gulliver's Travels|Gulliver]] on his return from the [[Houyhnhnm]]s, he finds himself unable to shake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts, slowly reverting to their animal natures.<ref name=\"Moreau\">Wells, H.

Putting the leading idea of this book very roughly, these two antagonistic typical conceptions of God may be best contrasted by speaking of one of them as God-as-Nature or the Creator, and of the other as God-as-Christ or the Redeemer. One is the great Outward God; the other is the Inmost God. The first idea was perhaps developed most highly and completely in the God of Spinoza. It is a conception of God tending to pantheism, to an idea of a comprehensive God as ruling with justice rather than affection, to a conception of aloofness and awestriking worshipfulness. The second idea, which is opposed to this idea of an absolute God, is the God of the human heart. The writer would suggest that the great outline of the theological struggles of that phase of civilisation and world unity which produced Christianity, was a persistent but unsuccessful attempt to get these two different ideas of God into one focus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wells|first=H.

Apart from text, the term \"hypertext\" is also sometimes used to describe tables, images, and other presentational [[content format]]s with integrated hyperlinks. Hypertext is one of the key underlying concepts of the [[World Wide Web]],<ref>{{cite web| url= http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Internet | title=Internet | type = definition |publisher=Free Online Law Dictionary |date=July 15, 2009 | work = West's Encyclopedia of American Law | edition = 2 |accessdate= November 25, 2008}}</ref> where Web pages are often written in the [[Hypertext Markup Language]] (HTML). As implemented on the Web, hypertext enables the easy-to-use publication of information over the [[Internet]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\n{{Quote | 'Hypertext' is a recent coinage. 'Hyper-' is used in the mathematical sense of extension and generality (as in 'hyperspace,' 'hypercube') rather than the medical sense of 'excessive' ('hyperactivity'). There is no implication about <u>size</u>&mdash; a hypertext could contain only 500 words or so. 'Hyper-' refers to structure and not size. | Theodor H. Nelson, ''[https://archive.org/details/SelectedPapers1977 Brief Words on the Hypertext]'', 23 January 1967}}\n\nThe English prefix '''hyper-''' comes from the Greek prefix \"\u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1-\" and means \"over\" or \"beyond\"; it has a common origin with the prefix \"super-\" which comes from Latin. It signifies the overcoming of the previous linear constraints of written text.\n\nThe term \"hypertext\" is often used where the term \"[[hypermedia]]\" might seem appropriate. In 1992, author [[Ted Nelson]]&nbsp;\u2013 who coined both terms in 1963&nbsp;\u2013 wrote:\n{{Quote | By now the word \"hypertext\" has become generally accepted for branching and responding text, but the corresponding word \"hypermedia\", meaning complexes of branching and responding graphics, movies and sound&nbsp;\u2013 as well as text&nbsp;\u2013 is much less used. Instead they use the strange term \"interactive multimedia\": this is four syllables longer, and does not express the idea of extending hypertext. | Nelson, ''[[Literary Machines]]'', 1992}}\n\n==Types and uses of hypertext==\nHypertext documents can either be static (prepared and stored in advance) or dynamic (continually changing in response to user input, such as [[dynamic web page]]s). Static hypertext can be used to cross-reference collections of data in documents, [[application software|software applications]], or books on CDs. A well-constructed system can also incorporate other user-interface conventions, such as menus and command lines. [[Hyperlink|Links]] used in a hypertext document usually replace the current piece of hypertext with the destination document. A lesser known feature is [[StretchText]], which expands or contracts the content in place, thereby giving more control to the reader in determining the level of detail of the displayed document. Hypertext can be used to support very complex and dynamic systems of linking and cross-referencing. The most famous implementation of hypertext is the [[World Wide Web]], written in the final months of 1990 and released on the [[Internet]] in 1991.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of hypertext|Timeline of hypertext technology}}\nIn 1941, [[Jorge Luis Borges]] published \"[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]\", a [[short story]] that is often considered an inspiration for the concept of hypertext.<ref name=\"inspiration\">{{Citation | url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=317431 | publisher = The Association for Computing Machinery | title = Hypertext and creative writing}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1945, [[Vannevar Bush]] wrote an article in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' called \"[[As We May Think]]\", about a futuristic proto-hypertext device he called a [[Memex]].  A Memex would hypothetically store - and record - content on reels of microfilm, using electric photocells to read coded symbols recorded next to individual microfilm frames while the reels spun at high speed, stopping on command. The coded symbols would enable the Memex to index, search, and link content to create and follow associative trails.  Because the Memex was never implemented and could only link content in a relatively crude fashion \u2014 by creating chains of entire microfilm frames \u2014 the Memex is now regarded only as a proto-hypertext device, but it is fundamental to the history of hypertext because it directly inspired the invention of hypertext by Ted Nelson and Douglas Engelbart.\n\n[[File:Ted Nelson cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nelson]] gives a presentation on [[Project Xanadu]], a theoretical hypertext model conceived in the 1960s whose first and incomplete implementation was first published in 1998.<ref name=\"wiredwired\"/>]]\n\nIn 1963, [[Ted Nelson]] coined the terms 'hypertext' and 'hypermedia' as part of a model he developed for creating and using linked content (first published reference 1965).<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Vassar | url = http://faculty.vassar.edu/mijoyce/Ted_sed.html | last = Joyce | first = MI | title = Did Ted Nelson first use the word \"hypertext\" (sic), meaning fast editing\" at Vassar College?}}</ref> He later worked with [[Andries van Dam]] to develop the [[Hypertext Editing System]] (text editing) in 1967 at [[Brown University]].

In December of that year, Engelbart demonstrated a 'hypertext' (meaning editing) interface to the public for the first time, in what has come to be known as \"[[The Mother of All Demos]]\".\n\nThe first hypermedia application is generally considered to be the [[Aspen Movie Map]], implemented in 1978.  The Movie Map allowed users to arbitrarily choose which way they wished to drive in a virtual cityscape, in two seasons (from actual photographs) as well as 3-D polygons.\n\nIn 1980, [[Tim Berners-Lee]] created [[ENQUIRE]], an early hypertext database system somewhat like a [[wiki]] but without hypertext punctuation, which was not invented until 1987.  The early 1980s also saw a number of experimental \"hyperediting\" functions in word processors and [[hypermedia]] programs, many of whose features and terminology were later analogous to the [[World Wide Web]]. [[Guide (hypertext)|Guide]], the first significant hypertext system for [[personal computer]]s, was developed by [[Peter J. Brown]] at [[University of Kent|UKC]] in 1982.\n\nIn 1980 [[Roberto Busa]],<ref>{{it}} Andrea Tornielli, ''[http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/documenti/dettaglio-articolo/articolo/web-busa-6893/ Padre Busa, il gesuita che ha inventato l'ipertesto]'', ''[[La Stampa]]'' - VaticanInsider, 11/08/2011</ref> an Italian Jesuit priest and one of the pioneers in the usage of computers for linguistic and literary analysis,<ref>Matthew Zepelin [https://www.academia.edu/8457616/Computers_and_the_Catholic_Mind_Religion_Technology_and_Social_Criticism_in_the_Postwar_United_States Computers and the Catholic Mind: Religion, Technology, and Social Criticism in the Postwar United States], July 5, 1914</ref> published the ''Index Thomisticus'', as a tool for performing text searches within the massive corpus of [[Aquinas]]'s works.<ref>[http://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/veneto/notizie/cronaca/2011/10-agosto-2011/morto-padre-busa-stato-pioniere-informatica-linguistica-1901272086173.shtml ''Morto padre Busa, \u00e8 stato il pioniere dell'informatica linguistica''], ''Corriere del Veneto'', 15.

Hyperties was used to create the July 1988 issue of the [[Communications of the ACM]] as a hypertext document and then the first commercial electronic book Hypertext Hands-On!\n\nIn August 1987, [[Apple Computer]] released [[HyperCard]] for the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] line at the [[Macworld Conference & Expo|MacWorld convention]]. Its impact, combined with interest in [[Peter J. Brown]]'s [[Guide (hypertext)|GUIDE]] (marketed by [[Office Workstations Ltd|OWL]] and released earlier that year) and Brown University's [[Intermedia (hypertext)|Intermedia]], led to broad interest in and enthusiasm for hypertext, hypermedia, databases, and new media in general. The first ACM Hypertext (hyperediting and databases) [[academic conference]] took place in November 1987, in Chapel Hill NC, where many other applications, including the branched literature writing software [[Storyspace]], were also demonstrated.<ref>Hawisher, Gail E., Paul LeBlanc, Charles Moran, and Cynthia L. Selfe (1996).

The project continued at Autodesk for four years, but no product was released.\n\nIn 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, then a scientist at [[CERN]], proposed and later prototyped a new hypertext project in response to a request for a simple, immediate, information-sharing facility, to be used among physicists working at CERN and other academic institutions. He called the project \"WorldWideWeb\".<ref name = \"WWW_proposal\">{{Citation |url=http://www.w3.org/Proposal.html |title=WorldWideWeb: Proposal for a HyperText Project |publisher=The World Wide Web consortium}}.</ref>\n\n{{quotation | HyperText is a way to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will.

Cailliau, 12 November 1990, CERN<ref name=\"WWW_proposal\" /> }}\n\nIn 1992, [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]] was born as an early Internet web browser. Its ability to provide hypertext links within documents that could reach into documents anywhere on the Internet began the creation of the Web on the Internet.\n\nAs new web browsers were released, traffic on the World Wide Web quickly exploded from only 500 known web servers in 1993 to over 10,000 in 1994. As a result, all previous hypertext systems were overshadowed by the success of the Web, even though it lacked many features of those earlier systems, such as integrated browsers/editors (a feature of the original WorldWideWeb browser, which was not carried over into most of the other early Web browsers).\n\n==Implementations==\nBesides the already mentioned [[Project Xanadu]], [[Hypertext Editing System]], [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]],  [[HyperCard]], and World Wide Web, there are other noteworthy early implementations of hypertext, with different feature sets:\n[[Image:HypertextEditingSystemConsoleBrownUniv1969.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Hypertext Editing System (HES) [[IBM 2250]] Display console&nbsp;\u2013 Brown University 1969]]\n* [[FRESS]] \u2013 a 1970s multi-user successor to the [[Hypertext Editing System]].\n* [[ZOG (hypertext)|ZOG]] \u2013 a 1970s hypertext system developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]].\n* [[Electronic Document System]] \u2013 an early 1980s text and graphic editor for interactive hypertexts such as equipment repair manuals and computer-aided instruction.\n* [[Information Presentation Facility]] \u2013 used to display online help in [[IBM]] operating systems.\n* [[Intermedia (hypertext)|Intermedia]] \u2013 a mid-1980s program for group web-authoring and information sharing.\n* [[The Interactive Encyclopedia System|HyperTies]] - a mid-1980s program commercially applied to hundreds of projects, including July 1988 [[Communications of the ACM]] and Hypertext Hands-On! book.\n* [[Texinfo]] \u2013 the [[GNU]] help system.\n* [[KMS (hypertext)|KMS]] \u2013 a 1980s successor to [[ZOG (hypertext)|ZOG]] developed as a commercial product.\n* [[Storyspace]] \u2013 a mid-1980s program for hypertext narrative.\n* Adobe's [[Portable Document Format]] \u2013 a widely used publication format for electronic documents.\n* [[Amigaguide]] \u2013 released on the Commodore [[Amiga]] [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] 1990.\n* [[Windows Help]] \u2013 released with Windows 3.0 in 1990.\n* [[Wiki]]s \u2013 aim to compensate for the lack of integrated editors in most Web browsers.

Two software programs specifically designed for literary hypertext, ''Storyspace'' and [[Intermedia (hypertext)|Intermedia]] became available in the 1990s.\n\nOn the other hand, concerning the Italian production, the hypertext s000t000d by Filippo Rosso (2002), was intended to lead the reader (with the help of a three-dimensional map) in a web page interface, and was written in HTML and [[PHP]].\n\nAn advantage of writing a narrative using hypertext technology is that the meaning of the story can be conveyed through a sense of spatiality and perspective that is arguably unique to digitally networked environments. An author's creative use of nodes, the self-contained units of meaning in a hypertextual narrative, can play with the reader's orientation and add meaning to the text.\n\nOne of the most successful computer games, ''[[Myst]]'', was first written in Hypercard.  The game was constructed as a series of Ages, each Age consisting of a separate Hypercard stack.  The full stack of the game consists of over 2500 cards.  In some ways ''Myst'' redefined interactive fiction, using puzzles and exploration as a replacement for hypertextual narrative.<ref>{{cite web| last =Parrish | first = Jeremy|url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3134600 |title= When SCUMM Ruled the Earth|publisher= [[1UP.com]] | accessdate = 2008-05-02}}</ref>\n\nCritics of hypertext claim that it inhibits the old, linear, reader experience by creating several different tracks to read on, and that this in turn contributes to a [[postmodernist]] fragmentation of worlds. In some cases, hypertext may be detrimental to the development of appealing stories (in the case of hypertext [[Gamebook]]s), where ease of linking fragments may lead to non-cohesive or incomprehensible narratives.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://biblumliteraria.blogspot.com/2008/07/es-el-hipertexto-una-bendicin-o-un.html | title = \u00bfEs el hipertexto una bendici\u00f3n o un...? |trans-title=Is hypertext a blessing or a...? |date=Jul 2008 | publisher = Biblum literaria | language = Spanish}}.</ref> However, they do see value in its ability to present several different views on the same subject in a simple way.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = U Calgary | place = [[Canada|CA]] | url = http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~scriptor/papers/arthur.html | title = The Game of Reading an Electronic Sir Gawain and the Green Knight}}.</ref>  This echoes the arguments of 'medium theorists' like [[Marshall McLuhan]] who look at the social and psychological impacts of the media. New media can become so dominant in public culture that they effectively create a \"paradigm shift\"{{Sfn | Green | 2001 | p = 15}} as people have shifted their perceptions, understanding of the world, and ways of interacting with the world and each other in relation to new technologies and media. So hypertext signifies a change from linear, structured and hierarchical forms of representing and understanding the world into fractured, decentralized and changeable media based on the technological concept of hypertext links. Importantly, this development puts the reader, rather than the author, at the center of the paradigm made available by hypertexts. Yet \"the figure of the reader in much editorial theory often remains abstract and even mystified\" in modern scholarship.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Siemens |first=Ray |last2=Dobson |first2=Teresa |date=2011 |title=HCI-Book?

[[Linda Dement]]\u2019s ''Cyberflesh Girlmonster'' a hypertext CD-ROM that incorporates images of women\u2019s body parts and remixes them to create new monstrous yet beautiful shapes. Dr. Caitlin Fisher\u2019s award-winning online hypertext novella \u201c\u2018These Waves of Girls\u201c is set in three time periods of the protagonist exploring polymorphous perversity enacted in her queer identity through memory. The story is written as a reflection diary of the interconnected memories of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. It consists of an associated multi-modal collection of nodes includes linked text, still and moving images, manipulable images, animations, and sound clips.\n\n===Forms of hypertext===\n\nThere are various forms of hypertext, each of which are structured differently. Below are four of the existing forms of hypertext:\n\n* '''Axial''' hypertexts are the most simple in structure. They are situated along an axis in a linear style. These hypertexts have a straight path from beginning to end and are fairly easy for the reader to follow. An example of an axial hypertext is [[The Virtual Disappearance of Miriam]].\n* '''Arborescent''' hypertexts are more complex than the axial form. They have a branching structure which resembles a tree. These hypertexts have one beginning but many possible endings. The ending that the reader finishes on depends on their decisions whilst reading the text. This is much like [[gamebook]] novels that allow readers to choose their own ending.\n* '''Networked''' hypertexts are more complex still than the two previous forms of hypertext. They consist of an interconnected system of nodes with no dominant axis of orientation. Unlike the arborescent form, networked hypertexts do not have any designated beginning or any designated endings. An example of a networked hypertext is [[Shelley Jackson]]'s [[Patchwork Girl (hypertext)|Patchwork Girl]].\n* '''Layered''' hypertext consist of two layers of linked pages. Each layer is doubly linked sequentially and a page in the top layer is doubly linked with a corresponding page in the bottom layer. The top layer contains plain text, the bottom multimedia layer provides photos, sounds and video. In the Dutch historical novel ''{{Interlanguage link multi|De man met de hoed|nl}}''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.demanmetdehoed.nl/presentatie/Welkom.html|title=Welkom|website=demanmetdehoed.nl}}</ref> designed as layered hypertext in 2006 by Eisjen Schaaf, Pauline van de Ven en [[Paul Vitanyi|Paul Vit\u00e1nyi]], the structure is proposed to enhance the atmosphere of the time, to enrich the text with research and family archive material and to enable readers to insert memories of their own while preserving tension and storyline.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of hypertext technology|Timeline of hypertext technology]]\n* [[Cybertext]]\n* [[Distributed Data Management Architecture]]\n* [[HTML]] (HyperText Markup Language)\n* [[Hyperwords]]\n* [[Hypotext]]\n* [[Http|HTTP]]\n* [[Hyperkino]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist |32em}}\n\n==Documentary film==\n* [[Andries van Dam]]: ''Hypertext: an Educational Experiment in English and Computer Science at Brown University.''

The first such work to which he signed the name was \"The Price of Doom\", an episode of ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]'' (though it was misspelled as Cord Wainer Bird in the credits). An episode of ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]'' (\"Who Killed Alex Debbs?\") credited to Ellison contains a ''character'' given this name, played by [[Sammy Davis Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0533832/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|title=Burke's Law: Who Killed Alex Debbs? (TV Series 1963\u20131966)}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Cordwainer Bird\" moniker is a tribute to fellow SF writer Paul M. A. Linebarger, better known by his pen name, [[Cordwainer Smith]]. The origin of the word \"[[cordwainer]]\" is shoemaker (from working with [[shell cordovan|cordovan]] leather for shoes). The term used by Linebarger was meant to imply the industriousness of the [[pulp magazine|pulp]] author. Ellison said, in interviews and in his writing, that his version of the pseudonym was meant to mean \"a shoemaker for birds\". Since he used the pseudonym mainly for works he wanted to distance himself from, it may be understood to mean that \"this work is for the birds\" or that it is of as much use as shoes to a bird. [[Stephen King]] once said he thought that it meant that Ellison was giving people who mangled his work a literary version of \"[[Finger (gesture)|the bird]]\" (given credence by Ellison himself in his own essay titled \"Somehow, I Don't Think We're in Kansas, Toto\", describing his experience with the ''[[Starlost]]'' television series).<ref name=\"Essential\">Ellison, Harlan [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Ellison-35-Year-Retrospective/dp/0962344737 \"The Essential Ellison: A 35-Year Retrospective\"] ({{ISBN|0962344737}})</ref>\n\nThe Bird moniker became a character in one of Ellison's own stories. In his book ''[[Strange Wine]]'', Ellison explains the origins of the Bird and goes on to state that Philip Jose Farmer wrote Cordwainer into the [[Wold Newton family]] the latter writer had developed. The thought of such a whimsical object lesson being related to such lights as Doc Savage, The Shadow, Tarzan, and all the other pulp heroes prompted Ellison to play with the concept, resulting in \"The New York Review of Bird\", in which an annoyed Bird uncovers the darker secrets of the New York literary establishment before beginning a pulpish slaughter of the same.<ref name=\"Strange\">Ellison, Harlan [https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Wine-Fifteen-stories-nightside/dp/0060111135 \"Strange Wine\"] ({{ISBN|0060111135}})</ref>\n\nOther pseudonyms Ellison used during his career include Jay Charby, Sley Harson, Ellis Hart, John Magnus, Paul Merchant, Pat Roeder, Ivar Jorgenson, Derry Tiger, Harlan Ellis and Jay Solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philsp.com/homeville/fmi/s968.htm#A30232 |title=Stories, Listed by Author |publisher=Philsp.com |date= |access-date=June 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903050655/http://www.philsp.com/homeville/fmi/s968.htm#A30232 |archivedate=September 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Controversies and disputes==\n\n=== Temperament ===\nEllison had a reputation for being abrasive and argumentative.{{efn|In his Introduction to \"I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\", Theodore Sturgeon describes Ellison as: \"...a man on the move, and he is moving fast.

Shortly afterwards, Ellison was dropped from the project. Without Ellison, the film came to a dead end, because subsequent scripts were unsatisfactory to potential directors.

In 1903, at the age of 18, he was drafted into the German army and spent his service stationed in Kiel. Afterwards, he attended the School of Medicine of the Universities of [[University of Jena]] and [[University of Rostock]],<ref>See [http://purl.uni-rostock.de/matrikel/200004494 entry of Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt] in the [[Rostock Matrikelportal]]</ref> receiving his doctorate at the latter in 1909. Part of his practical training was undertaken at ''St. Georg'' \u2013 Hospital in Hamburg. After qualification he sought adventure as a ship's surgeon, voyaging the [[Pacific Ocean]], taking the opportunity to study local crafts, linguistics, and tropical plants.\n\nAfter returning to [[Germany]], Creutzfeldt worked at the Neurological Institute in [[Frankfurt am Main]], at the psychiatric-neurological clinics in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]], [[Kiel]] and [[Berlin]], and at the ''[[Deutsche Forschungsanstalt f\u00fcr Psychiatrie]]'' in [[Munich]]. He was [[habilitation|habilitated]] at Kiel in 1920, and in 1925 became ''Extraordinarius'' of [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]]. In 1938 he was appointed professor and director of the university psychiatric and neurological division in Kiel. He helped to recognize a neurodegenerative disease, with [[Alfons Maria Jakob]], [[Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease]] in which the [[brain tissue]] develops holes and takes on a sponge-like texture. It is now known it is due to a type of infectious [[protein]] called a [[prion]]. Prions are misfolded proteins which replicate by converting their properly folded counterparts.\n\nIn the [[Third Reich]] Creutzfeldt became a [[F\u00f6rderndes Mitglied der SS|Patron Member]] of [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] from 1932-1933.<ref name=\"Kondziella2016\"/>\n\n==Later life==\n\nCreutzfeldt was 54 years old when the [[Second World War]] broke out. He was unmoved by the [[Nazi regime]] and was able to save some people from death in [[Extermination camp|concentration camp]]s and also managed to rescue almost all of his patients from being murdered under the Nazi [[Aktion T4]] [[euthanasia]] program, an unusual event since most mental patients identified by T4 personnel were gassed or poisoned at separate [[euthanasia]] clinics such as [[Hadamar Euthanasia Centre]]. During the war, bombing raids destroyed his home and clinic.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter the war he was director of the [[University of Kiel]] for six months, before being dismissed by the British occupation forces. His efforts to rebuild the university caused a series of conflicts with the British because he wanted to allow more former army officers to study there. In 1953 he moved on to [[Munich]] to work on scientific research commissioned by the [[Max Planck Society]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Personal life==\nHe was married to Clara Sombart, a daughter of [[Werner Sombart]].

Part of the [[lanthanide series]], holmium is a [[rare-earth element]]. Holmium was discovered by Swedish chemist [[Per Theodor Cleve]]. Its oxide was first isolated from rare-earth ores in 1878. The element's name comes from ''Holmia'', the Latin name for the city of [[Stockholm]].\n\nElemental holmium is a relatively soft and malleable silvery-white [[metal]]. It is too reactive to be found uncombined in nature, but when isolated, is relatively stable in dry air at room temperature. However, it reacts with water and corrodes readily and also burns in air when heated.\n\nHolmium is found in the minerals [[monazite]] and [[gadolinite]] and is usually commercially extracted from monazite using [[ion-exchange]] techniques. Its compounds in nature and in nearly all of its laboratory chemistry are trivalently oxidized, containing Ho(III) ions. Trivalent holmium ions have fluorescent properties similar to many other rare-earth ions (while yielding their own set of unique emission light lines), and thus are used in the same way as some other rare earths in certain laser and glass-colorant applications.\n\nHolmium has the highest [[magnetic permeability]] of any element and therefore is used for the [[polepiece]]s of the strongest static [[magnet]]s. Because holmium strongly absorbs neutrons, it is also used as a [[burnable poison]] in nuclear reactors.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n===Physical properties===\n[[Image:Holmium(III) oxide.jpg|thumb|left|Ho<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, left: natural light, right: under a [[cold-cathode]] fluorescent lamp]]\nHolmium is a relatively soft and malleable element that is fairly [[corrosion]]-resistant and stable in dry air at [[standard temperature and pressure]]. In moist air and at higher [[temperature]]s, however, it quickly [[oxidation|oxidizes]], forming a yellowish oxide. In pure form, holmium possesses a metallic, bright silvery luster.\n\n[[Holmium(III) oxide|Holmium oxide]] has some fairly dramatic color changes depending on the lighting conditions. In daylight, it has a tannish yellow color. Under trichromatic light, it is fiery orange-red, almost indistinguishable from the appearance of erbium oxide under the same lighting conditions. The perceived color change is related to the sharp absorption bands of holmium interacting with a subset of the sharp emission bands of the trivalent ions of europium and terbium, acting as phosphors.<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1246/cl.2008.762| title=Hydrothermal Synthesis of GdVO<sub>4</sub>:Ho<sup>3+</sup> Nanorods with a Novel White-light Emission| date=2008| author=Yiguo Su| journal=Chemistry Letters| volume=37| pages=762\u2013763| issue=7| last2=Li| first2=Guangshe| last3=Chen| first3=Xiaobo| last4=Liu| first4=Junjie| last5=Li| first5=Liping}}</ref>\n\nHolmium has the highest [[magnetic moment]] ({{val|10.6|ul=\u00b5B}}) of any naturally occurring element and possesses other unusual magnetic properties.

Some synthetic radioactive isotopes are known; the most stable one is holmium-163, with a half-life of 4570 years. All other radioisotopes have ground-state half-lives not greater than 1.117 days, and most have half-lives under 3 hours. However, the [[metastable]] <sup>166m1</sup>Ho has a half-life of around 1200 years because of its high [[spin (physics)|spin]].

The result of that effort was two new materials, one brown and one green. He named the brown substance holmia (after the Latin name for Cleve's home town, Stockholm) and the green one thulia. Holmia was later found to be the [[holmium oxide]], and thulia was [[thulium oxide]].<ref name=history/>\nIn [[Henry Moseley]]'s classic paper{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} on atomic numbers, holmium was assigned an atomic number of 66.  Evidently, the holmium preparation he had been given to investigate had been grossly impure, dominated by neighboring (and unplotted) dysprosium. He would have seen x-ray emission lines for both elements, but assumed that the dominant ones belonged to holmium, instead of the dysprosium impurity.\n\n==Occurrence and production==\n[[File:Gadolinitas.jpg|thumb|[[Gadolinite]] ]]\nLike all other rare earths, holmium is not naturally found as a free element.

It is one of Germany's [[States of Germany|16 federal states]], surrounded by the states of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] to the north, and [[Lower Saxony]] to the south, and is the largest city of [[Northern Germany]]. The city's [[Hamburg Metropolitan Region|metropolitan region]] is home to more than five million people. Hamburg lies on the [[River Elbe]] and two of its [[tributaries]], the [[River Alster]], which forms two large lakes within the city, and the [[Bille (Elbe)|River Bille]]. It is the third-largest [[German language|German-speaking]] city after Berlin and [[Vienna]], and the largest city in the [[Low German]] dialect area.\n\nThe official name reflects [[History of Hamburg|Hamburg's history]] as a member of the medieval [[Hanseatic League]], a [[free imperial city]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a [[city-state]] and one of the 16 states of Germany. Before the 1871 [[Unification of Germany]], it was a fully [[sovereignty|sovereign]] state. Prior to the constitutional changes in 1919 it formed a civic republic [[constitutional monarchy|headed constitutionally]] by a class of hereditary [[grand burgher]]s or {{lang|de|[[Hanseaten (class)|Hanseaten]]}}. The city has repeatedly been beset by disasters such as the [[Great Fire of Hamburg]], [[north Sea flood of 1962|exceptional coastal flooding]] and military conflicts including [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|World War II bombing raids]]. Historians remark that the city has managed to recover and emerge wealthier after each catastrophe.\n\nSituated on the [[Elbe]] river, Hamburg is home to Europe's second-largest port and a broad corporate base. In media, the major regional broadcasting firm [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]], the printing and publishing firm {{lang|de|[[Gruner + Jahr]]|italic=no}} and the newspapers {{lang|de|[[Der Spiegel]]|italic=yes}} and {{lang|de|[[Die Zeit]]|italic=yes}} are based in the city. Hamburg remains an important financial center, the seat of Germany's oldest [[Hamburg Stock Exchange|stock exchange]] and the [[list of oldest banks in continuous operation|world's oldest merchant bank]], [[Berenberg Bank]]. Media, commercial, logistical, and industrial firms with significant locations in the city include multinationals [[Airbus]], {{lang|de|[[Blohm + Voss]]|italic=no}}, {{lang|de|[[Aurubis]]|italic=no}}, {{lang|de|[[Beiersdorf]]|italic=no}}, and [[Unilever]].\n\nThe city hosts specialists in world economics and international law, including [[list of diplomatic missions in Hamburg|consular and diplomatic missions]] as the [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]], the [[EU-LAC Foundation]], and the [[UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning]]. In recent years, the city has played host to multipartite international political conferences and summits such as [[Hamburg Summit: China meets Europe|Europe and China]] and the [[2017 G20 Hamburg summit|G20]]. Former German Chancellor {{lang|de|[[Helmut Schmidt]]|italic=no}}, who governed Germany for eight years, and [[Angela Merkel]], German chancellor since 2005, come from Hamburg.\n\nThe city is a major international and domestic [[#Tourism|tourist destination]].

Among its most notable cultural venues are the {{lang|de|[[Elbphilharmonie]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|de|[[Laeiszhalle]]|italic=no}} concert halls. It gave birth to movements like {{lang|de|[[Hamburger Schule]]}} and paved the way for bands including [[The Beatles in Hamburg|The Beatles]]. Hamburg is also known for several [[list of theatres in Hamburg|theatres]] and a variety of musical shows. [[St. Pauli]]'s {{lang|de|[[Reeperbahn]]|italic=no}} is among the best-known European entertainment districts.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Hamburg-Elbphilharmonie.jpg|alt=Elbphilharmonie|thumb|The iconic [[Elbphilharmonie]] in [[HafenCity|Hafen-City,]] seen from the [[Speicherstadt]]. ]]\nHamburg is at a sheltered natural harbour on the southern fanning-out of the [[Jutland Peninsula]], between [[Continental Europe]] to the south and [[Scandinavia]] to the north, with the [[North Sea]] to the west and the [[Baltic Sea]] to the northeast. It is on the [[Elbe|River Elbe]] at its confluence with the [[Alster]] and [[Bille (Elbe)|Bille]]. The city centre is around the [[Binnenalster]] (\"Inner Alster\") and [[Au\u00dfenalster]] (\"Outer Alster\"), both formed by damming the River Alster to create lakes.

Hamburg was briefly annexed by [[Napoleon I]] to the [[First French Empire]] (1804\u20131814/1815). Russian forces under [[Levin August, Count von Bennigsen|General Bennigsen]] finally freed the city in 1814. Hamburg re-assumed its pre-1811 status as a city-state in 1814. The [[Congress of Vienna|Vienna Congress]] of 1815 confirmed Hamburg's independence and it became one of 39 sovereign states of the [[German Confederation]] (1815\u20131866).\n\nIn 1842, about a quarter of the inner city was destroyed in the \"[[Great Fire of Hamburg|Great Fire]]\". The fire started on the night of 4 May and was not extinguished until 8 May. It destroyed three churches, the town hall, and many other buildings, killing 51 people and leaving an estimated 20,000 homeless. Reconstruction took more than 40 years.\n\nAfter periodic political unrest, particularly in [[Revolutions of 1848|1848]], Hamburg adopted in 1860 a semidemocratic constitution that provided for the election of the Senate, the governing body of the city-state, by adult taxpaying males. Other innovations included the separation of powers, the separation of Church and State, freedom of the press, of assembly and association. Hamburg became a member of the [[North German Confederation]] (1866\u20131871) and of the [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918), and maintained its self-ruling status during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919\u20131933). [[Accession of Hamburg to the German Customs Union (Zollverein)|Hamburg acceded to the German Customs Union or Zollverein]] in 1888, the last (along with Bremen) of the German states to join. The city experienced its fastest growth during the second half of the 19th century, when its population more than quadrupled to 800,000 as the growth of the city's [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] trade helped make it Europe's second-largest port.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/PDFs/WORLD%20PORT%20RANKINGS%202011.pdf |title=World Port Ranking 2011}}</ref> The [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg-America Line]], with [[Albert Ballin]] as its director, became the world's largest [[Atlantic Ocean|transatlantic]] shipping company around the start of the 20th century. Shipping companies sailing to [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[India]] and [[East Asia]] were based in the city. Hamburg was the departure port for many Germans and [[Eastern Europe]]ans to emigrate to the [[United States]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Trading communities from all over the world established themselves there.\n\nA major outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1892 was badly handled by the city government, which retained an unusual degree of independence for a German city. About 8,600 died in the largest German epidemic of the late 19th century, and the last major cholera epidemic in a major city of the Western world.\n\n===Second World War===\n[[File:Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945.

During the [[Second World War]], Hamburg suffered a series of Allied [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|air raids]] which devastated much of the city and the harbour. On 23 July 1943, Royal Air Force ([[Royal Air Force|RAF]]) firebombing created a [[firestorm]] which spread from the ''Hauptbahnhof'' (main railway station) and quickly moved south-east, completely destroying entire boroughs such as [[Hammerbrook]], [[Billbrook]] and [[Hamm, Hamburg|Hamm South]]. Thousands of people perished in these densely populated working class boroughs. The raids, codenamed [[Operation Gomorrah]] by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], killed at least 42,600 civilians; the precise number is not known.\nAbout one million civilians were evacuated in the aftermath of the raids. While some of the boroughs destroyed were rebuilt as residential districts after the war, others such as Hammerbrook were entirely developed into office, retail and limited residential or industrial districts. \n\nThe [[Hamburg Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery]] is in the greater [[Ohlsdorf Cemetery]] in the north of Hamburg.\n\nAt least 42,900 people are thought to have perished<ref name=\"kz-neuengamme\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kz-gedenkstaette-neuengamme.de |title=Gedenkst\u00e4tte Konzentrationslager Neuengamme |publisher=Kz-gedenkstaette-neuengamme.de |date= |accessdate=14 September 2013}}</ref> in the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]] (about {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} outside the city in the marshlands), mostly from epidemics and in the [[SS Cap Arcona (1927)|bombing of Kriegsmarine evacuation vessels]] by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] at the end of the war.\n\nHamburg had the greatest concentration of Jews in Germany. Systematic [[Deportation#Deportation in the Holocaust|deportations of Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent]] started on 18 October 1941. These were all directed to [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe]] or to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. Most deported persons perished in [[the Holocaust]]. By the end of 1942 the ''J\u00fcdischer Religionsverband in Hamburg'' was dissolved as an independent legal entity and its remaining assets and staff were assumed by the [[Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland]] (District Northwest). On 10 June 1943 the [[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]] dissolved the ''Reichsvereinigung'' by a decree.<ref>Cf.

The school was so called after [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], the birthplace of Aristippus. It was one of the earliest [[Socrates|Socratic]] schools. The Cyrenaics taught that the only intrinsic good is pleasure, which meant not just the absence of pain, but positively enjoyable momentary sensations. Of these, physical ones are stronger than those of anticipation or memory. They did, however, recognize the value of social obligation, and that pleasure could be gained from [[altruism]]{{Citation needed|reason=by whom?|date=March 2011}}. [[Theodorus the Atheist]] was a latter exponent of hedonism who was a disciple of [[Aristippus the Younger|younger Aristippus]],<ref name=\"diog86\">Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ii. 86</ref> while becoming well known for expounding [[atheism]]. The school died out within a century, and was replaced by [[Epicureanism]].\n\nThe Cyrenaics were known for their skeptical [[Epistemology|theory of knowledge]]. They reduced logic to a basic doctrine concerning the criterion of truth.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reale|Catan|1986|p=274}}</ref> They thought that we can know with certainty our immediate [[Empirical evidence|sense-experiences]] (for instance, that I am having a sweet sensation now) but can know nothing about the nature of the objects that cause these sensations (for instance, that the honey is sweet).<ref name=\"copleston121\">{{Harvnb|Copleston|2003|p=121}}</ref> They also denied that we can have knowledge of what the experiences of other people are like.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reale|Catan|1986|pp=274\u20135}}</ref> All knowledge is immediate sensation. These sensations are motions which are purely subjective, and are painful, indifferent or pleasant, according as they are violent, tranquil or gentle.<ref name=\"copleston121\"/><ref name=\"annas230\">{{Harvnb|Annas|1995|p=230}}</ref> Further, they are entirely individual and can in no way be described as constituting absolute objective knowledge. Feeling, therefore, is the only possible criterion of knowledge and of conduct.<ref name=\"copleston121\"/> Our ways of being affected are alone knowable. Thus the sole aim for everyone should be pleasure.\n\nCyrenaicism deduces a single, universal aim for all people which is pleasure. Furthermore, all feeling is momentary and homogeneous. It follows that past and future pleasure have no real existence for us, and that among present pleasures there is no distinction of kind.<ref name=\"annas230\"/> Socrates had spoken of the higher pleasures of the intellect; the Cyrenaics denied the validity of this distinction and said that bodily pleasures, being more simple and more intense, were preferable.<ref name=\"annas231\">{{Harvnb|Annas|1995|p=231}}</ref> Momentary pleasure, preferably of a physical kind, is the only good for humans. However some actions which give immediate pleasure can create more than their equivalent of pain. The wise person should be in control of pleasures rather than be enslaved to them, otherwise pain will result, and this requires judgement to evaluate the different pleasures of life.<ref name=\"copleston122\">{{Harvnb|Copleston|2003|p=122}}</ref> Regard should be paid to law and custom, because even though these things have no intrinsic value on their own, violating them will lead to unpleasant penalties being imposed by others.<ref name=\"annas231\"/> Likewise, friendship and justice are useful because of the pleasure they provide.<ref name=\"annas231\"/> Thus the Cyrenaics believed in the hedonistic value of social obligation and altruistic behaviour.\n\n==== Epicureanism ====\n{{main article|Epicureanism|Epicurus}}\nEpicureanism is a system of [[philosophy]] based upon the teachings of [[Epicurus]] (''c''. 341\u2013''c''. 270 BC), founded around 307 BC. Epicurus was an [[atomism|atomic]] [[materialism|materialist]], following in the steps of [[Democritus]] and [[Leucippus]]. His [[materialism]] led him to a general stance against superstition or the idea of divine intervention. Following [[Aristippus]]\u2014about whom very little is known\u2014Epicurus believed that the greatest good was to seek modest, sustainable \"pleasure\" in the form of a state of tranquility and freedom from fear  ([[ataraxia]]) and absence of bodily pain ([[aponia]]) through knowledge of the workings of the world and the limits of our desires. The combination of these two states is supposed to constitute happiness in its highest form. Although Epicureanism is a form of hedonism, insofar as it declares pleasure as the sole intrinsic good, its conception of absence of pain as the greatest pleasure and its advocacy of a simple life make it different from \"hedonism\" as it is commonly understood.\n\n[[Image:Epicurus bust2.jpg|thumb|left|<center>[[Epicurus]]</center>]]In the Epicurean view, the highest pleasure (tranquility and freedom from fear) was obtained by knowledge, friendship and living a virtuous and temperate life. He lauded the enjoyment of simple pleasures, by which he meant abstaining from bodily desires, such as sex and appetites, verging on [[asceticism]]. He argued that when eating, one should not eat too richly, for it could lead to dissatisfaction later, such as the grim realization that one could not afford such delicacies in the future. Likewise, sex could lead to increased lust and dissatisfaction with the sexual partner. Epicurus did not articulate a broad system of social ethics that has survived but had a unique version of the [[Golden Rule]].\n\n<blockquote>It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and well and justly (agreeing \"neither to harm nor be harmed\"),<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim |last=O'Keefe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ugI3eRmNJrcC&printsec=frontcover|title=Epicurus on Freedom|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year= 2005|page=134}}</ref> and it is impossible to live wisely and well and justly without living a pleasant life.<ref>[http://classics.mit.edu/Epicurus/princdoc.html ''Epicurus Principal Doctrines''] tranls. by Robert Drew Hicks (1925)</ref></blockquote>\n\nEpicureanism was originally a challenge to [[Platonism]], though later it became the main opponent of [[Stoicism]]. Epicurus and his followers shunned politics. After the death of Epicurus, his school was headed by [[Hermarchus]]; later many Epicurean societies flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era (such as those in [[Antioch]]ia, [[Alexandria]], [[Rhodes]] and [[Ercolano]]). The poet [[Lucretius]] is its most known Roman proponent. By the end of the Roman Empire, having undergone Christian attack and repression, Epicureanism had all but died out, and would be resurrected in the 17th century by the atomist [[Pierre Gassendi]], who adapted it to the Christian doctrine.\n\nSome writings by Epicurus have survived. Some scholars consider the epic poem ''[[On the Nature of Things]]'' by [[Lucretius]] to present in one unified work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism. Many of the papyrus scrolls unearthed at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]] are Epicurean texts. At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean [[Philodemus]].\n\n===Yangism===\n{{main article|Yangism}}\nYangism has been described as a form of psychological and ethical egoism. The Yangist philosophers believed in the importance of maintaining self-interest through \"keeping one's nature intact, protecting one's uniqueness, and not letting the body be tied by other things.\" Disagreeing with the Confucian virtues of li (propriety), ren (humaneness), and yi (righteousness) and the Legalist virtue of fa (law), the Yangists saw wei wo, or \"everything for myself,\" as the only virtue necessary for self-cultivation. Individual pleasure is considered desirable, like in hedonism, but not at the expense of the health of the individual. The Yangists saw individual well-being as the prime purpose of life, and considered anything that hindered that well-being immoral and unnecessary.\n\nThe main focus of the Yangists was on the concept of xing, or human nature, a term later incorporated by Mencius into Confucianism. The xing, according to sinologist A. C. Graham, is a person's \"proper course of development\" in life. Individuals can only rationally care for their own xing, and should not naively have to support the xing of other people, even if it means opposing the emperor. In this sense, Yangism is a \"direct attack\" on Confucianism, by implying that the power of the emperor, defended in Confucianism, is baseless and destructive, and that state intervention is morally flawed.\n\nThe Confucian philosopher Mencius depicts Yangism as the direct opposite of Mohism, while Mohism promotes the idea of universal love and impartial caring, the Yangists acted only \"for themselves,\" rejecting the altruism of Mohism. He criticized the Yangists as selfish, ignoring the duty of serving the public and caring only for personal concerns. Mencius saw Confucianism as the \"Middle Way\" between Mohism and Yangism.\n\n=== Judaism ===\n\n[[Judaism]] believes that mankind was created for pleasure, as [[God]] placed [[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]]\u2014Eden being the Hebrew word for \"pleasure.\" In recent years, Rabbi [[Noah Weinberg]] articulated five different [http://www.aish.com/sp/f/Five_Levels_of_Pleasure.html levels of pleasure]; connecting with God is the highest possible pleasure. The Book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament proclaims, \"There is nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil.

It is an ethical theory holding that the proper course of action is the one that maximizes the overall good of the society.<ref name=\"test\">, Salters-Nuffield Advanced Biology for Edexcel A2 Biology 2009.</ref> It is thus one form of [[consequentialism]], meaning that the moral worth of an [[action (philosophy)|action]] is determined by its resulting outcome. The most influential contributors to this theory are considered to be the 18th and 19th-century British philosophers [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Conjoining hedonism\u2014as a view as to what is good for people\u2014to utilitarianism has the result that all action should be directed toward achieving the greatest total amount of happiness (see [[Hedonic calculus]]). Though consistent in their pursuit of happiness, Bentham and Mill's versions of hedonism differ. There are two somewhat basic schools of thought on hedonism:<ref name=\"stanford\"/>\n\n* One school, grouped around Bentham, defends a quantitative approach. Bentham believed that the value of a pleasure could be quantitatively understood. Essentially, he believed the value of pleasure to be its intensity multiplied by its duration - so it was not just the number of pleasures, but their intensity and how long they lasted that must be taken into account.\n* Other proponents, like Mill, argue a qualitative approach. Mill believed that there can be different levels of pleasure - higher quality pleasure is better than lower quality pleasure. Mill also argues that simpler beings (he often refers to pigs) have an easier access to the simpler pleasures; since they do not see other aspects of life, they can simply indulge in their lower pleasures. The more elaborate beings tend to spend more thought on other matters and hence lessen the time for simple pleasure. It is therefore more difficult for them to indulge in such \"simple pleasures\" in the same manner.\n=== Libertinage ===\n{{main article|Libertine}}\nAn extreme form of hedonism that views moral and sexual restraint as either unnecessary or harmful.

Improving the external environment is admirable and important; but such improvement can't recalibrate our hedonic treadmill above a genetically constrained ceiling. Twin studies confirm there is a [partially] heritable set-point of well-being - or ill-being - around which we all tend to fluctuate over the course of a lifetime. This set-point varies between individuals. [It's possible to ''lower'' an individual's hedonic set-point by inflicting prolonged uncontrolled stress; but even this re-set is not as easy as it sounds: suicide-rates typically go down in wartime; and six months after a quadriplegia-inducing accident, studies{{Citation needed|reason=Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence|date=November 2016}} suggest that we are typically neither more nor less unhappy than we were before the catastrophic event.] Unfortunately, attempts to build an ideal society can't overcome this biological ceiling, whether utopias of the left or right, free-market or socialist, religious or secular, futuristic high-tech or simply cultivating one's garden. Even if ''everything'' that traditional futurists have asked for is delivered - eternal youth, unlimited material wealth, morphological freedom, superintelligence, immersive VR, molecular nanotechnology, etc - there is no evidence that our subjective quality of life would on average significantly surpass the quality of life of our hunter-gatherer ancestors - or a New Guinea tribesman today - in the absence of reward pathway enrichment. This claim is difficult to prove in the absence of sophisticated neuroscanning; but objective indices of psychological distress e.g. suicide rates, bear it out. ''Un''enhanced humans will still be prey to the spectrum of Darwinian emotions, ranging from terrible suffering to petty disappointments and frustrations - sadness, anxiety, jealousy, existential angst. Their biology is part of \"what it means to be human\". Subjectively unpleasant states of consciousness exist because they were genetically adaptive. Each of our core emotions had a distinct signalling role in our evolutionary past: they tended to promote behaviours that enhanced the inclusive fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://abolitionist.com/|title=The Abolitionist Project|last=admin@abolitionist.com|website=abolitionist.com|access-date=2016-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==== Hedonism as a scientific basis for long-term future forecasting ====\n\nRussian physicist and philosopher Victor Argonov argues that hedonism is not only a philosophical but also a verifiable scientific hypothesis. In 2014 he suggested \"postulates of pleasure principle\" confirmation of which would lead to a new scientific discipline, hedodynamics. Hedodynamics would be able to forecast the distant future development of human civilization and even the probable structure and psychology of other rational beings within the universe.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Victor Argonov |title=The Pleasure Principle as a Tool for Scientific Forecasting of Human Self-Evolution |journal=Journal of Evolution and Thechnology |volume=24 |year=2014 | pages=63\u201378 | url=http://jetpress.org/v24/argonov.htm}}</ref>  In order to build such a theory, science must discover the neural correlate of pleasure - neurophysiological parameter unambiguously corresponding to the feeling of pleasure (hedonic tone).\n\nAccording to Argonov, posthumans will be able to reprogram their motivations in an arbitrary manner (to get pleasure from any programmed activity).<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Victor Argonov |title=Artificial programming of human motivations: A way to degradation or rapid development? |journal=Questions of Philosophy (in Russian) |volume=12 |year=2008 | pages=22\u201337 | url=http://transhumanism-russia.ru/content/view/392/144}}</ref> And if pleasure principle postulates are true, then general direction of civilization development is obvious: maximization of integral happiness in posthuman life (product of life span and average happiness). Posthumans will avoid constant pleasure stimulation, because it is incompatible with rational behavior required to prolong life. However, in average, they can become much happier than modern humans.\n\nMany other aspects of posthuman society could be predicted by hedodynamics if the neural correlate of pleasure were discovered. For example, optimal number of individuals, their optimal body size (whether it matters for happiness or not) and the degree of aggression.\n\n==Criticisms==\nCritics of hedonism have objected to its exclusive concentration on pleasure as valuable.\n\nIn particular, [[G. E. Moore]] offered a thought experiment in criticism of pleasure as the sole bearer of value: he imagined two worlds\u2014one of exceeding beauty and the other a heap of filth. Neither of these worlds will be experienced by anyone. The question, then, is if it is better for the beautiful world to exist than the heap of filth. In this Moore implied that states of affairs have value beyond conscious pleasure, which he said spoke against the validity of hedonism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hedonism/#SH3c%7ctitle=Hedonism%7cwork=utm.edu%7ctitle=Hedonism%7cwork=utm.edu|title=Hedonism|website=utm.edu}}</ref>\n\n===Islamic criticisms===\nIn [[Islam]], God admonished mankind not to love the worldly pleasures, since they are related with greed and sources of sinful habits. He also threatened those who prefer worldly life rather than hereafter with [[Hell]].\n\n{{blockquote|''Those who choose the worldly life and its pleasures will be given proper recompense for their deeds in this life and will not suffer any loss.

Other than higher-latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression, Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed, floodplain, and cave deposits.

[[Ice core]] records show that before the Holocene there was global warming after the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] and cooling periods, but climate changes became more regional at the start of the [[Younger Dryas]]. During the transition from the last glacial to the Holocene, the [[Huelmo\u2013Mascardi Cold Reversal]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] began before the Younger Dryas, and the maximum warmth flowed south to north from 11,000 to 7,000 years ago. It appears that this was influenced by the residual glacial ice remaining in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] until the later date.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe [[Holocene climatic optimum]] (HCO) was a period of warming in which the global climate became warmer. However, the warming was probably not uniform across the world. This period of warmth ended about 5,500 years ago with the descent into the [[Neoglacial]] and concomitant [[Neopluvial]]. At that time, the climate was not unlike today's, but there was a slightly warmer period from the 10th\u201314th centuries known as the [[Medieval Warm Period]]. This was followed by the [[Little Ice Age]], from the 13th or 14th century to the mid-19th century, which was a period of cooling.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nCompared to glacial conditions, habitable zones have expanded northwards, reaching their northernmost point during the HCO.

Villages built on defensive bluffs indicate increased warfare, leading to food gathering in communal groups for protection rather than individual hunting.<ref>{{cite book |last=Snow |first=Dean R. |title=Archaeology of Native North America |year=2010 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=Upper Saddle River NJ |pages=384 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=iHWACgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |isbn=9780136156864}}</ref> In Mesoamerica, transformations of natural environments have been a common feature at least since the mid-Holocene, mostly through the exploitation of wild plants and the establishment of crops.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Franco-Gaviria |first=Felipe. |title=The human impact imprint on modern pollen spectra of the Mayan lands |year=2018 |journal=[[Bolet\u00edn de la Sociedad Geol\u00f3gica Mexicana, 70]] |pages=61\u201378 |url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/7001/%284%29Franco.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[8.2 kiloyear event]]\n* [[10th millennium BCE]]\n* [[Blytt\u2013Sernander system]]\n* [[Holocene calendar]]\n* [[Holocene extinction]]\n* [[Neolithic Subpluvial]]\n* [[Older Peron]]\n* [[Outburst flood]]\n* [[Piora Oscillation]]\n* [[Quaternary extinction event]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |last = Roberts |first = Neil |title = The Holocene: an environmental history |year = 2014 |edition = 3rd |publisher = Wiley-Blackwell |location = Malden, MA |isbn = 978-1-4051-5521-2 }}\n* {{Cite book |editor1-last = Mackay |editor1-first = A.W. |editor2-last = Battarbee |editor2-first = R.W. |editor3-last = Birks |editor3-first = H.J.B. |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last = Oldfield |editor4-first = F. |title = Global change in the Holocene |year = 2003 |publisher = Arnold |location = London |isbn = 978-0-340-76223-3 }}\n* {{cite journal | url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030544031300441X#cebib0010 | title=Holocene landscape intervention and plant food production strategies in island and mainland Southeast Asia | first1=C.O. | last1=Hunt | first2=R.J. | last2=Rabett | journal=Journal of Archaeological Science | year=2014 | volume=51 | pages=22\u201333 | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2013.12.011}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Holocene}}\n{{Wikisource portal|Cenozoic#Quaternary}}\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Holocene}}\n* [http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/history_of_the_earth/Holocene The Holocene epoch explained by the BBC]\n* [http://ghkclass.com/ghkC.html?Holocene ghK Classification]\n\n{{Holocene footer}}\n{{Quaternary footer}}\n{{Geological history|p|c}}\n{{Prehistoric technology|state=expanded}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Holocene| ]]\n[[Category:Geological epochs]]\n[[Category:Quaternary geochronology]]\n[[Category:Interglacials]]", "sha1": "tmrf3zw0bkm1gvrj6w58o0ekbmtjgk1"}}, {"title": "Homosexual", "ns": "0", "id": "13472", "redirect": {"title": "Homosexuality"}, "revision": {"id": "770814905", "parentid": "403177678", "timestamp": "2017-03-17T19:13:05Z", "contributor": {"username": "Rchard2scout", "id": "6917124"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Replace deprecated {{This is a redirect}} with {{Redirect category shell}}.

The term ''harbor'' is often used interchangeably with ''[[port]]'', which is a man-made facility built for loading and unloading vessels and dropping off and picking up passengers. Ports usually include one or more harbors. [[Alexandria Port]] in [[Egypt]] is an example of a port with two harbors.\n\nHarbors may be natural or artificial. An artificial harbor can have deliberately constructed [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]s, [[sea wall]]s, or [[jetty]]s or they can be constructed by [[dredging]], which requires maintenance by further periodic dredging. An example of an artificial harbor is [[Long Beach Harbor]], [[California]], [[United States]] which was an array of [[salt marshes]] and [[tidal flats]] too shallow for modern [[merchant ships]] before it was first dredged in the early 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geology.campus.ad.csulb.edu/people/bperry/geology303/geol303chapter8.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223191432/http://geology.campus.ad.csulb.edu/people/bperry/geology303/geol303chapter8.html |archivedate=2014-02-23 |df= }}</ref> In contrast, a natural harbor is surrounded on several sides by [[prominence]]s of land. Examples of natural harbors include [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia and [[Trincomalee Harbour]] in Sri Lanka.\n\n==Artificial harbors==\n\nArtificial harbors are frequently built for use as ports. The oldest artificial harbor known is the Ancient Egyptian site at [[Wadi al-Jarf]], on the Red Sea coast, which is at least 4500 years old (ca. 2600-2550 BC, reign of King Khufu). The largest artificially created harbor is [[Jebel Ali]] in [[Dubai]].<ref>{{Citation|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513075-1|last=Hattendorf|first=John B.|title=The Oxford encyclopedia of maritime history|year=2007|page=590}}</ref> Other large and busy artificial harbors include: \n* [[Port of Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]]; \n* [[Port of Houston]], [[Texas]], United States;\n* [[Port of Savannah]], [[Georgia (US State)|Georgia]], United States;\n* [[Port of Long Beach]], California, United States;  \n* [[Port of Los Angeles]] in [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]], California, United States.\n\nThe Ancient Carthaginians constructed fortified, artificial harbors called [[cothon]]s.\n\n==Natural harbors==\n[[File:Natural harbor in Vizhinjam 930218630 a6a5d892d0 o.jpg|thumb|A natural harbor in [[Vizhinjam]], [[India]]]]\n[[File:Shipbuilding yard.jpg|thumb|[[Visakhapatnam]] Natural Harbor]]\nA natural harbor is a [[landform]] where a part of a body of water is protected and deep enough to furnish anchorage. Many such harbors are [[ria]]s. Natural harbors have long been of great [[military strategy|strategic naval]] and [[economic]] importance, and many great cities of the world are located on them. Having a protected harbor reduces or eliminates the need for breakwaters as it will result in calmer waves inside the harbor.

Thus, in the [[Old Italic alphabets]], the letter heta of the [[Euboean alphabet]] was adopted with its original sound value {{IPA|/h/}}.\n\nWhile [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] and [[Latin]] had {{IPA|/h/}} as a [[phoneme]], almost all [[Romance languages]] lost the sound\u2014[[Romanian language|Romanian]] later re-borrowed the {{IPA|/h/}} phoneme from its neighbouring Slavic languages, and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] developed a secondary {{IPA|/h/}} from {{IPA|/f/}}, before losing it again; various Spanish dialects have developed {{IPA|[h]}} as an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/x/}} in most Spanish-speaking countries, and various dialects of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] use it as an allophone of {{IPA|/\u0280/}}. 'H' is also used in many spelling systems in [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] and [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraphs]], such as 'ch', which represents {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} in Spanish, [[Galician language|Galician]], Old Portuguese and [[English language|English]], {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in [[French language|French]] and modern Portuguese, {{IPA|/k/}} in [[Italian language|Italian]], French and English, {{IPA|/x/}} in [[German language|German]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], Slovak, one native word of English and a few loanwords into English, and {{IPA|/\u00e7/}} in German.\n\n==Name in English==\nFor most English speakers, the name for the letter is pronounced as {{IPAc-en|e\u026a|t\u0283}} and spelled 'aitch'<ref name=mw/> or occasionally 'eitch'. The pronunciation {{IPAc-en|h|e\u026a|t\u0283}} and the associated spelling 'haitch' is often considered to be [[H-dropping#H-insertion|h-adding]] and is considered nonstandard in England.<ref name=\"how do you pronounce H\"/> It is, however, a feature of [[Hiberno-English]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPo0oB19gDUC|title=A Dictionary of Hiberno-English: The Irish Use of English|first=T.

The pronunciation {{IPA|/he\u026at\u0283/}} may be a [[hypercorrection]] formed by analogy with the names of the other letters of the alphabet, most of which include the sound they represent.<ref>Todd, L. & Hancock I.: \"International English Ipod\", page 254. Routledge, 1990.</ref>\n\nThe ''haitch'' pronunciation of ''h'' has spread in England, being used by approximately 24% of English people born since 1982<ref>[[John C Wells]], ''Longman Pronunciation Dictionary'', page 360, Pearson, Harlow, 2008</ref> and polls continue to show this pronunciation becoming more common among younger native speakers. Despite this increasing number, the pronunciation without the {{IPAc-en|h|}} sound is still considered to be standard in England, although the pronunciation with {{IPAc-en|h|}} is also attested as a legitimate variant.<ref name=\"how do you pronounce H\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11642588|title='Haitch' or 'aitch'? How do you pronounce 'H'?|date=|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nAuthorities disagree about the history of the letter's name. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' says the original name of the letter was {{IPA-la|\u02c8aha|}} in Latin; this became {{IPA|[\u02c8aka]}} in Vulgar Latin, passed into English via Old French {{IPA|[at\u0283]}}, and by Middle English was pronounced {{IPA|[a\u02d0t\u0283]}}. ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' derives it from French ''hache'' from Latin ''haca'' or ''hic''. [[Anatoly Liberman]] suggests a conflation of two obsolete orderings of the alphabet, one with ''H'' immediately followed by ''K'' and the other without any ''K'': reciting the former's ''..., H, K, L,...'' as {{ipa|[...(h)a ka el ...]}} when reinterpreted for the latter ''..., H, L,...'' would imply a pronunciation {{ipa|[(h)a ka]}} for ''H''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.oup.com/2013/08/alphabet-soup-letter-h-y-origin-etymology/|title=Alphabet soup, part 2: H and Y|last=Liberman|first=Anatoly|date=7 August 2013|work=Oxford Etymologist|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Use in writing systems==\n\n===English===\nIn English, {{angbr|h}} occurs as a single-letter [[grapheme]] (being either [[silent letter|silent]] or representing the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] ({{IPAc-en|h}}) and in various [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], such as {{angbr|ch}} {{IPAc-en|t\u0283|}}, {{IPAc-en|\u0283}}, {{IPAc-en|k}}, or {{IPAc-en|x}}), {{angbr|gh}} (silent, {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, or {{IPA|/f/}}), {{angbr|ph}} ({{IPA|/f/}}), {{angbr|rh}} ({{IPA|/r/}}), {{angbr|sh}} ({{IPAc-en|\u0283}}), {{angbr|th}} ({{IPAc-en|\u03b8}} or {{IPAc-en|\u00f0}}), {{angbr|wh}} ({{IPAslink|hw}}<ref>In many dialects, {{IPA|/hw/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} have merged</ref>). The letter is silent in a [[syllable rime]], as in ''ah'', ''ohm'', ''dahlia'', ''cheetah'', ''pooh-poohed'', as well as in certain other words (mostly of French origin) such as ''hour'', ''honest'', ''herb'' (in [[American English|American]] but not [[British English]]) and ''vehicle''. Initial {{IPA|/h/}} is often not pronounced in the [[Weak and strong forms in English|weak form]] of some [[function words]] including ''had'', ''has'', ''have'', ''he'', ''her'', ''him'', ''his'', and in some varieties of English (including most regional dialects of England and Wales) it is often omitted in all words (see [[h-dropping|'{{angbr|h}}'-dropping]]). It was formerly common for ''an'' rather than ''a'' to be used as the indefinite article before a word beginning with {{IPA|/h/}} in an [[stress (linguistics)|unstressed]] syllable, as in \"an historian\", but use of ''a'' is now more usual (see {{slink|English articles|Indefinite article}}).\n\n===Other languages===\nIn the [[German language]], the name of the letter is pronounced {{IPA|/ha\u02d0/}}. Following a vowel, it often silently indicates that the vowel is long: In the word {{lang|de|erh\u00f6hen}} ('heighten'), the second {{angbr|h}} is mute for most speakers outside of Switzerland. In 1901, a [[spelling reform]] eliminated the silent {{angbr|h}} in nearly all instances of {{angbr|th}} in native German words such as ''thun'' ('to do') or ''Th\u00fcr'' ('door'). It has been left unchanged in words derived from Greek, such as {{lang|de|Theater}} ('theater') and {{lang|de|Thron}} ('throne'), which continue to be spelled with {{angbr|th}} even after the last German spelling reform.\n\nIn Spanish and Portuguese, {{angbr|h}} (\"hache\" in Spanish, pronounced {{IPA-es|'at\u0283e}}, or ''ag\u00e1'' in Portuguese, pronounced {{IPA-es|a\u02c8\u0263a|}} or {{IPA-pt|\u0250\u02c8\u0261a|}}) is a silent letter with no pronunciation, as in ''hijo'' {{IPA-es|\u02c8ixo|}} ('son') and ''h\u00fangaro'' {{IPA-pt|\u02c8\u0169\u0261a\u027eu|}} ('Hungarian'). The spelling reflects an earlier pronunciation of the sound {{IPA|/h/}}. It is sometimes pronounced with the value {{IPA|[h]}}, in some regions of Andalusia, Extremadura, Canarias, Cantabria and the Americas in the beginning of some words. {{angbr|h}} also appears in the digraph {{angbr|ch}}, which represents {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} in Spanish and northern Portugal, and {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in oral traditions that merged both sounds (the latter originarily represented by {{angbr|x}} instead) e.g. in most of the Portuguese language and some Spanish-speaking places, prominently Chile, as well as {{angbr|nh}} {{IPA|/\u0272/}} and {{angbr|lh}} {{IPA|/\u028e/}} in Portuguese, whose spelling is inherited from [[Occitan language|Occitan]].\n\nIn French, the name of the letter is pronounced {{IPA|/a\u0283/}}. The French orthography classifies words that begin with this letter in two ways, one of which can affect the pronunciation, even though it is a silent letter either way. The ''H muet'', or \"mute\" {{angbr|h}}, is considered as though the letter were not there at all, so for example the singular definite [[article (grammar)|article]] ''le'' or ''la'', which is [[elision (French)|elided]] to ''l''' before a vowel, elides before an ''H muet'' followed by a vowel. For example, ''le + h\u00e9bergement'' becomes ''l'h\u00e9bergement'' ('the accommodation'). The other kind of {{angbr|h}} is called ''h aspir\u00e9'' (\"[[Aspirated h|aspirated '{{angbr|h}}']]\", though it is not normally aspirated phonetically), and does not allow elision or [[Liaison (French)|liaison]]. For example in ''le homard'' ('the lobster') the article ''le'' remains unelided, and may be separated from the noun with a bit of a glottal stop. Most words that begin with an ''H muet'' come from Latin (''honneur'', ''homme'') or from Greek through Latin (''h\u00e9catombe''), whereas most words beginning with an ''H aspir\u00e9'' come from Germanic (''harpe'', ''hareng'') or non-Indo-European languages (''harem'', ''hamac'', ''haricot''); in some cases, an orthographic {{angbr|h}} was added to disambiguate the {{IPA|[v]}} and semivowel {{IPA|[\u0265]}} pronunciations before the introduction of the distinction between the letters {{angbr|v}} and {{angbr|u}}: ''huit'' (from ''uit'', ultimately from Latin ''octo''), ''hu\u00eetre'' (from ''uistre'', ultimately from Greek through Latin ''ostrea'').\n\nIn Italian, {{angbr|h}} has no [[Phonology|phonological]] value. Its most important uses are in the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] 'ch' {{IPA|/k/}} and 'gh' {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, as well as to differentiate the spellings of certain short words that are [[homophone]]s, for example some [[present tense]] forms of the verb ''avere'' ('to have') (such as ''hanno'', 'they have', vs. ''anno'', 'year'), and in short [[interjections]] (''oh'', ''ehi'').\n\nSome languages, including [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[Finnish language|Finnish]], use {{angbr|h}} as a [[voiced glottal fricative|'''breathy voiced''' glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0266]}}, often as an allophone of otherwise voiceless {{IPA|/h/}} in a voiced environment.\n\nIn [[Hungarian phonology|Hungarian]], the letter has five independent pronunciations, perhaps more than in any other language, with an additional three uses as a productive and non-productive member of a digraph. H may represent [[Voiceless palato-alveolar affricate|/h/]] as in the name of the Sz\u00e9kely town [[Harghita|Hargita]]; intervocalically it represents [[voiced glottal fricative|/\u0266/]] as in \"teh\u00e9z\"; it represents [[voiceless velar fricative|/x/]] in the word \"doh\"; it represents [[voiceless palatal fricative|/\u00e7/]] in \"ihlet\"; and it is silent in \"Cseh\". As part of a diphthong, it represents, in archaic spelling, [[Voiceless palato-alveolar affricate|/t\u0361\u0283/]] with the letter C as in the name \"[[Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi]]; it represents, again, with the letter C, [[voiceless velar fricative|/x/]] in \"pech\" (which is pronounced [p\u025bx]); in certain environments it breaks palatalization of a consonant, as in the name \"Horthy\" which is pronounced [h\u0254rti] (without the intervening H, the name \"Horty\" would be pronounced [h\u0254rc]); and finally, it acts as a silent component of a diphthong, as in the name \"Vargha\", pronounced [v\u0252rg\u0252].\n\nIn [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], when written in the Latin alphabet, {{angbr|h}} is also commonly used for {{IPA|/\u0266/}}, which is otherwise written with the Cyrillic letter {{angbr|\u0433}}.\n\nIn [[Irish language|Irish]], {{angbr|h}} is not considered an independent letter, except for a very few non-native words, however {{angbr|h}} placed after a consonant is known as a \"s\u00e9imhi\u00fa\" and indicates [[lenition]] of that consonant; {{angbr|h}} began to replace the original form of a s\u00e9imhi\u00fa, a dot placed above the consonant, after the introduction of typewriters.\n\nIn most dialects of Polish, both {{angbr|h}} and the digraph {{angbr|ch}} always represent {{IPA|/x/}}.\n\nIn [[Basque language|Basque]], during the 20th century it was not used in the orthography of the Basque dialects in Spain but it marked an aspiration in the North-Eastern dialects.\nDuring the [[Standard Basque|standardization of Basque]] in the 1970s, the compromise was reached that ''h'' would be accepted if it were the first consonant in a syllable.\nHence, ''herri'' (\"people\") and ''etorri'' (\"to come\") were accepted instead of ''erri'' ([[Biscayan Basque|Biscayan]]) and ''ethorri'' ([[Souletin]]).\nSpeakers could pronounce the h or not.\nFor the dialects lacking the aspiration, this meant a complication added to the standardized spelling.\n\n===Other systems===\nAs a phonetic symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), it is used mainly for the so-called aspirations (fricative or trills), and variations of the plain letter are used to represent two sounds: the lowercase form {{angbr|{{IPA link|h}}}} represents the [[voiceless glottal fricative]], and the small capital form {{angbr|{{IPA link|\u029c}}}} represents the [[voiceless epiglottal fricative]] (or trill). With a bar, minuscule {{angbr|{{IPA link|\u0127}}}} is used for a [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]]. Specific to the IPA, a hooked {{angbr|{{IPA link|\u0266}}}} is used for a [[voiced glottal fricative]], and a superscript {{angbr|{{IPA link|\u02b0}}}} is used to represent [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]].\n\n==Related characters==\n<!-- Please only list characters (symbols in a writing system, but not just convenience code points in Unicode) that are actually related in terms of origin to the letter that is the topic of this article.

Shoes are attached on the palmar surface (ground side) of the [[horse hoof|hooves]], usually [[nail (engineering)|nail]]ed through the insensitive hoof wall that is anatomically akin to the human [[Nail (anatomy)|toenail]], although much larger and thicker. However, there are also cases where shoes are [[glue]]d.\n\nThe fitting of horseshoes is a professional occupation, conducted by a [[farrier]], who specializes in the preparation of feet, assessing potential lameness issues, and fitting appropriate shoes, including remedial features where required. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, horseshoeing is legally restricted to only people with specific qualifications and experience. In others, such as the United States, where professional licensing is not legally required, professional organizations provide certification programs that publicly identify qualified individuals. People sometimes put decorative horseshoes on their horses if they are going to a competition.\n\nHorseshoes are available in a wide variety of materials and styles, developed for different types of horse and for the work they do.

The metal is softened so that it can be more precisely shaped to the horse's hoof.]]\nMany changes brought about by the [[domestication of the horse]] have led to a need for shoes for numerous reasons, mostly linked to management that results in horses' hooves hardening less and being more vulnerable to injury. In the wild, a horse may travel up to 50 miles per day to obtain adequate forage. While horses in the wild cover large areas of terrain, they usually do so at relatively slow speeds, unless being chased by a predator.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> They also tend to live in arid steppe climates. The consequence of slow but nonstop travel in a dry climate is that horses' feet are naturally worn to a small, smooth, even and hard state. The continual stimulation of the sole of the foot keeps it thick and hard. However, in [[domestication]], the ways horses are used differ from what they would encounter in their natural environment. Domesticated horses are brought to colder and wetter areas than their ancestral habitat. These softer and heavier soils soften the hooves and make them prone to splitting, making hoof protection necessary.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> Consequently, it was in northern Europe that the nailed horseshoe arose in its modern form.\n\nDomesticated horses are also subject to inconsistent movement between stabling and work; they must carry or pull additional weight, and in modern times, they are often kept and worked on very soft footing, such as irrigated land, arena footing, or stall bedding. In some cases, management is also inadequate. The hooves of horses that are kept in stalls or small turnouts, even when cleaned adequately, are exposed to more moisture than would be encountered in the wild, as well as to ammonia from urine. The hoof capsule is mostly made from keratin, a [[protein]], and is weakened by this exposure, becoming even more fragile and soft. Shoes do not prevent or reduce damage from moisture and ammonia exposure. Rather, they protect already weakened hooves. Further, without the natural conditioning factors present in the wild, the feet of horses grow overly large and long unless trimmed regularly. Hence, protection from rocks, pebbles, and hard, uneven surfaces is lacking. A balanced diet with proper [[equine nutrition|nutrition]] also is a factor. Without these precautions, cracks in overgrown and overly brittle hoof walls are a danger, as is bruising of the soft tissues within the foot because of inadequately thick and hard sole material.\n\n===Physical stresses requiring horseshoes===\n*Abnormal stress: Horses' hooves can become quite worn out when subjected to the added weight and stress of a rider, pack load, cart, or [[wagon]].<ref name=HH367>Ensminger, M.

Many generations of domestic horses bred for size, color, speed, and other traits with little regard for hoof quality and soundness make some [[list of horse breeds|breeds]] more dependent on horseshoes than [[feral horse]]s such as [[mustang]]s, which develop strong hooves as a matter of [[natural selection]].\n\n[[Image:Easyboot.jpg|thumb|left|A [[hoof boot]] can be used in place of a horseshoe or as a temporary substitute for a thrown shoe]]\nNonetheless, domestic horses do not always require shoes. When possible, a \"barefoot\" hoof, at least for part of every year, is a healthy option for most horses. However, horseshoes have their place and can help prevent excess or abnormal hoof wear and injury to the foot. Many horses go without shoes year-round, some using temporary protection such as [[hoof boot]]s for short-term use.<ref name=Natural57>McBane, Susan ''A Natural Approach to Horse Management'' London:Methuen 1992 {{ISBN|0-413-62370-X}} pp. 57\u201360</ref>\n\n==Process of shoeing==\n{{See also|Farrier}}\n[[Image:Farrier toolslabled.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Farrier tools]]\n[[Image:Italian farrier 2006 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Nailing on a horseshoe]]\n[[Image:Shoeing in progress.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The shoe, showing a ''toe clip'', has just had the nails driven in through the hoof. The farrier will then cut the nails, and bend the cut end over to form a clinch.]]\nShoeing, when performed correctly, causes no pain to the animal. Farriers trim the insensitive part of the hoof, which is the same area into which they drive the nails. This is analogous to a [[manicure]] on a human fingernail, only on a much larger scale.<ref name=Catalog84/>\n\nBefore beginning to shoe, the farrier removes the old shoe using pincers (shoe pullers) and trims the hoof wall to the desired length with nippers, a sharp pliers-like tool, and the sole and [[frog (horse)|frog]] of the hoof with a hoof knife. Shoes do not allow the hoof to wear down as it naturally would in the wild, and it can then become too long. The coffin bone inside the hoof should line up straight with both bones in the [[pastern]]. If the excess hoof is not trimmed, the bones will become misaligned, which would place stress on the legs of the animal.<ref name=Evans742>Evans, J. Warren, et al. ''The Horse'' Second Edition New York: Freeman 1990 {{ISBN|0-7167-1811-1}} pp. 742\u2013747</ref>\n\nShoes are then measured to the foot and bent to the correct shape using a hammer and anvil, and other modifications, such as taps for [[Caulkin|shoe studs]], are added. Farriers may either cold shoe, in which he bends the metal shoe without heating it, or hot shoe, in which he places the metal in a forge before bending it. Hot shoeing can be more time-consuming, and requires the farrier to have access to a forge; however, it usually provides a better fit, as the mark made on the hoof from the hot shoe can show how even it lies. It also allows the farrier to make more modifications to the shoe, such as drawing toe- and quarter-clips. The farrier must take care not to hold the hot shoe against the hoof too long, as the heat can damage the hoof.<ref name=Evans742/>\n\nHot shoes are placed in water to cool them off. The farrier then nails the shoes on, by driving the nails into the hoof wall at the [[horse hoof|white line]] of the hoof. The nails are shaped in such a way that they bend outward as they are driven in, avoiding the sensitive inner part of the foot, so they emerge on the sides of the hoof. When the nail has been completely driven, the farrier cuts off the sharp points and uses a clincher (a form of tongs made especially for this purpose) or a clinching block with hammer to bend the rest of the nail so it is almost flush with the hoof wall. This prevents the nail from getting caught on anything, and also helps to hold the nail, and therefore the shoe, in place.<ref name=Evans742/>\n\nThe farrier then uses a rasp (large file), to smooth the edge where it meets the shoe and eliminate any sharp edges left from cutting off the nails.<ref name=Evans742/>\n\n===Shoeing mistakes===\nMistakes are sometimes made by even a skilled farrier, especially if the horse does not stand still. This may sometimes result in a nail coming too close to the sensitive part of the hoof (putting pressure on it), or a nail that is driven slightly into the sensitive hoof, called quicking or [[nail prick]]ing. This occurs when a nail penetrates the wall and hits the sensitive internal structures of the foot. Quicking results in bleeding and pain and the horse may show signs of [[lameness (equine)|lameness]] or may become lame in following days. Whenever it happens, the farrier must remove the offending nail. Usually a horse that is quicked will react immediately, though some cases where the nail is close to sensitive structures may not cause immediate problems. These mistakes are made occasionally by anyone who shoes horses, and in most cases is not an indication that the farrier is unskilled. It happens most commonly when horses move around while being shod, but also may occur if the hoof wall is particularly thin (common in [[Thoroughbred]]s), or if the hoof wall is brittle or damaged. It may also occur with an inexperienced or unskilled horseshoer who misdrives a nail, uses a shoe that is too small, or has not fitted the shoe to the shape of the horse's hoof. Occasionally, manufacturing defects in nails or shoes may also cause a misdriven nail that quicks a horse.\n\nHowever, the term \"farrier\" implies a professional horseshoer with skill, education, and training. Some people who shoe horses are untrained or unskilled, and likely to do more harm than good for the horse. People who do not understand the horse's foot will not trim the hoof correctly. This can cause serious problems for the animal, resulting in chronic lameness and damage to the hoof wall. Poor trimming will usually place the hoof at an incorrect angle, leave the foot laterally unbalanced and may cut too much off certain areas of the hoof wall, or trim too much of the frog or sole. Some horseshoers will rasp the hoof down to fit an improperly shaped or too-small size of shoe, which is damaging to the movement of the horse and can damage the hoof itself if trimmed or rasped too short. A poor horseshoer can also make mistakes in the shoeing process itself, not only quicking a horse, but also putting the shoe on crooked, using the wrong type of shoe for the job at hand, shaping the shoe improperly, or setting it on too far forward or back.\n\n==In culture==\n\n===Superstition===\n[[File:Dunstan and the Devil - Project Gutenberg eText 13978.png|thumb|left|upright|Saint Dunstan shoes the Devil]]\n[[Image:Horseshoe lucky on door.jpg|thumb|upright|A horseshoe on a door is regarded a protective [[talisman]] in some cultures]]\n{{See also|Iron in mythology#Luck}}\nHorseshoes have long been considered lucky.

The legend recounts that, one day, the Devil walked into Dunstan's shop and asked him to shoe his horse. Dunstan pretended not to recognize him, and agreed to the request; but rather than nailing the shoe to the horse's hoof, he nailed it to the Devil's own foot, causing him great pain. Dunstan eventually agreed to remove the shoe, but only after extracting a promise that the Devil would never enter a household with a horseshoe nailed to the door.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who was St Dunstan?|url=http://www.stdunstan.net/who-was-st-dunstan.htm|publisher=St Dunstan Episcopal Church}}</ref>\n\nOpinion is divided as to which way up the horseshoe ought to be nailed.

Each heme group contains one iron atom, that can bind one oxygen molecule through [[ion]]-induced dipole forces. The most common type of hemoglobin in [[mammals]] contains four such subunits.\n\n== Genetics ==\nHemoglobin consists of [[protein subunits]] (the \"globin\" molecules), and these proteins, in turn, are folded chains of a large number of different amino acids called [[polypeptides]]. The amino acid sequence of any polypeptide created by a cell is in turn determined by the stretches of DNA called genes. In all proteins, it is the amino acid sequence that determines the protein's chemical properties and function.\n\nThere is more than one hemoglobin gene: in humans, hemoglobin A (the main form of hemoglobin present) is coded for by the genes, ''HBA1'', ''HBA2'', and ''HBB''.<ref name=\":3\" /> The amino acid sequences of the globin proteins in hemoglobins usually differ between species.

For example, hemoglobin has been found to adapt in different ways to high altitudes. Organisms living at high elevations experience lower partial pressures of oxygen compared to those at sea level. This presents a challenge to the organisms that inhabit such environments because hemoglobin, which normally binds oxygen at high partial pressures of oxygen, must be able to bind oxygen when it is present at a lower pressure. Different organisms have adapted to such a challenge. For example, recent studies have suggested genetic variants in deer mice that help explain how deer mice that live in the mountains are able to survive in the thin air that accompanies high altitudes. A researcher from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln found mutations in four different genes that can account for differences between deer mice that live in lowland prairies versus the mountains. After examining wild mice captured from both highlands and lowlands, it was found that: the genes of the two breeds are \"virtually identical\u2014except for those that govern the oxygen-carrying capacity of their hemoglobin\". \"The genetic difference enables highland mice to make more efficient use of their oxygen\", since less is available at higher altitudes, such as those in the mountains.<ref>Reed, Leslie. \"Adaptation found in mouse genes.\" Omaha World-Herald 11 Aug. 2009: EBSCO.

The lowest-energy form of oxygen, and the lowest energy forms of the relevant oxidation states of iron, are these:\n* [[Triplet oxygen]], the lowest-energy molecular oxygen species, has two unpaired electrons in antibonding \u03c0* molecular orbitals.\n* Iron(II) tends to exist in a high-spin 3d<sup>6</sup> configuration with four unpaired electrons.\n* Iron(III) (3d<sup>5</sup>) has an odd number of electrons, and thus must have one or more unpaired electrons, in any energy state.\n\nAll of these structures are paramagnetic (have unpaired electrons), not diamagnetic. Thus, a non-intuitive (e.g., a higher-energy for at least one species) distribution of electrons in the combination of iron and oxygen must exist, in order to explain the observed diamagnetism and no unpaired electrons.\n\nThe two logical possibilities to produce diamagnetic (no net spin) Hb-O<sub>2</sub> are:\n# Low-spin Fe<sup>2+</sup> binds to [[singlet oxygen]]. Both low-spin iron and singlet oxygen are diamagnetic. However, the singlet form of oxygen is the higher-energy form of the molecule.\n# Low-spin Fe<sup>3+</sup> binds to O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2022\u2212</sup> (the [[superoxide]] ion) and the two unpaired electrons couple antiferromagnetically, giving observed diamagnetic properties.  Here, the iron has been oxidized (has lost one electron), and the oxygen has been reduced (has gained one electron).\n\nAnother possible model in which low-spin Fe<sup>4+</sup> binds to peroxide, O<sub>2</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>, can be ruled out by itself, because the iron is paramagnetic (although the peroxide ion is diamagnetic). Here, the iron has been oxidized by two electrons, and the oxygen reduced by two electrons.\n\n'''Direct experimental data:'''\n* [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] suggests iron has an oxidation state of approximately 3.2.\n* [[Infrared spectroscopy|Infrared vibrational frequencies]] of the O-O bond suggests a bond length fitting with superoxide (a bond order of about 1.6, with superoxide being 1.5).\n* [[XANES|X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structures]] at the iron K-edge.

Model 3 leads to unfavorable separation of charge (and does not agree with the magnetic data), although it could make a minor contribution as a [[resonance]] form. Iron's shift to a higher oxidation state in Hb-O<sub>2</sub> decreases the atom's size, and allows it into the plane of the porphyrin ring, pulling on the coordinated histidine residue and initiating the allosteric changes seen in the globulins.\n\nEarly postulates by bio-inorganic chemists claimed that possibility #1 (above) was correct and that iron should exist in oxidation state II. This conclusion seemed likely, since the iron oxidation state III as [[methemoglobin]], when ''not'' accompanied by superoxide '''.'''O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> to \"hold\" the oxidation electron, was known to render hemoglobin incapable of binding normal triplet O<sub>2</sub> as it occurs in the air. It was thus assumed that iron remained as Fe(II) when oxygen gas was bound in the lungs. The iron chemistry in this previous classical model was elegant, but the required presence of the diamagnetic, high-energy, singlet oxygen molecule was never explained. It was classically argued that the binding of an oxygen molecule placed high-spin iron(II) in an octahedral field of strong-field ligands; this change in field would increase the [[Crystal Field Theory|crystal field splitting energy]], causing iron's electrons to pair into the low-spin configuration, which would be diamagnetic in Fe(II). This forced low-spin pairing is indeed thought to happen in iron when oxygen binds, but is not enough to explain iron's change in size. Extraction of an additional electron from iron by oxygen is required to explain both iron's smaller size and observed increased oxidation state, and oxygen's weaker bond.\n\nThe assignment of a whole-number oxidation state is a formalism, as the covalent bonds are not required to have perfect bond orders involving whole electron transfer. Thus, all three models for paramagnetic Hb-O<sub>2</sub> may contribute to some small degree (by resonance) to the actual electronic configuration of Hb-O<sub>2</sub>. However, the model of iron in Hb-O<sub>2</sub> being Fe(III) is more correct than the classical idea that it remains Fe(II).\n\n==Cooperativity==\n[[Image:Hemoglobin t-r state ani.gif|frame|A schematic visual model of oxygen-binding process, showing all four [[monomer]]s and [[heme]]s, and [[protein|protein chains]] only as diagrammatic coils, to facilitate visualization into the molecule. [[Oxygen]] is not shown in this model, but, for each of the [[iron]] atoms, it binds to the iron (red sphere) in the flat [[heme]]. For example, in the upper-left of the four hemes shown, oxygen binds at the left of the iron atom shown in the upper-left of diagram. This causes the iron atom to move backward into the heme that holds it (the iron moves upward as it binds oxygen, in this illustration), tugging the [[histidine]] residue (modeled as a red pentagon on the right of the iron) closer, as it does. This, in turn, pulls on the protein chain holding the [[histidine]].]]\n\nWhen oxygen binds to the iron complex, it causes the iron atom to move back toward the center of the plane of the [[porphyrin]] ring (see moving diagram). At the same time, the [[imidazole]] side-chain of the histidine residue interacting at the other pole of the iron is pulled toward the porphyrin ring. This interaction forces the plane of the ring sideways toward the outside of the tetramer, and also induces a strain in the protein helix containing the histidine as it moves nearer to the iron atom. This strain is transmitted to the remaining three monomers in the tetramer, where it induces a similar conformational change in the other heme sites such that binding of oxygen to these sites becomes easier.\n\nAs oxygen binds to one monomer of hemoglobin, the tetramer's conformation shifts from the T (tense) state to the R (relaxed) state. This shift promotes the binding of oxygen to the remaining three monomer's heme groups, thus saturating the hemoglobin molecule with oxygen.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mihailescu|first=Mihaela-Rita|last2=Russu|first2=Irina M.|date=2001-03-27|title=A signature of the T \u2192 R transition in human hemoglobin|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=98|issue=7|pages=3773\u201377|doi=10.1073/pnas.071493598|issn=0027-8424|pmc=31128|pmid=11259676|bibcode=2001PNAS...98.3773M}}</ref>\n\nIn the tetrameric form of normal adult hemoglobin, the binding of oxygen is, thus, a [[cooperative binding|cooperative process]]. The binding affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is increased by the oxygen saturation of the molecule, with the first molecules of oxygen bound influencing the shape of the binding sites for the next ones, in a way favorable for binding. This positive cooperative binding is achieved through [[steric effects|steric]] conformational changes of the hemoglobin protein complex as discussed above; i.e., when one subunit protein in hemoglobin becomes oxygenated, a conformational or structural change in the whole complex is initiated, causing the other subunits to gain an increased affinity for oxygen. As a consequence, the oxygen binding curve of hemoglobin is [[Sigmoid function|sigmoidal]], or ''S''-shaped, as opposed to the normal [[Hyperbolic function|hyperbolic]] curve associated with noncooperative binding.\n\nThe dynamic mechanism of the cooperativity in hemoglobin and its relation with the [[low-frequency collective motion in proteins and DNA|low-frequency resonance]] has been discussed.<ref name=\"pmid2763333\">{{cite journal | author = Chou KC | title = Low-frequency resonance and cooperativity of hemoglobin | journal = Trends Biochem.

The carbon dioxide is bound to amino groups of the globin proteins to form [[carbaminohemoglobin]]; this mechanism is thought to account for about 10% of carbon dioxide transport in mammals. [[Nitric oxide]] can also be transported by hemoglobin; it is bound to specific [[thiol]] groups in the globin protein to form an S-nitrosothiol, which dissociates into free nitric oxide and thiol again, as the hemoglobin releases oxygen from its heme site. This nitric oxide transport to peripheral tissues is hypothesized to assist oxygen transport in tissues, by releasing [[Vasodilation|vasodilatory]] nitric oxide to tissues in which oxygen levels are low.<ref name='Jensen'>{{Cite journal\n | last = Jensen\n | first = Frank B\n | title = The dual roles of red blood cells in tissue oxygen delivery: oxygen carriers and regulators of local blood flow\n | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology\n | volume = 212| issue = Pt 21\n | pages =3387\u201393\n | year =2009\n | pmid = 19837879| doi =10.1242/jeb.023697}}</ref>\n\n===Competitive===\nThe binding of oxygen is affected by molecules such as carbon monoxide (for example, from [[tobacco smoking]], [[exhaust gas]], and incomplete combustion in furnaces). CO competes with oxygen at the heme binding site. Hemoglobin's binding affinity for CO is 250 times greater than its affinity for oxygen,<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=John E.|title=Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology|year=2010|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=9781416045748|page=502|edition=12th}}</ref> meaning that small amounts of CO dramatically reduce hemoglobin's ability to transport oxygen. Since carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless and tasteless gas, and poses a potentially fatal threat, [[carbon monoxide detector]]s have become commercially available to warn of dangerous levels in residences. When hemoglobin combines with CO, it forms a very bright red compound called [[carboxyhemoglobin]], which may cause the skin of [[Carbon monoxide poisoning|CO poisoning]] victims to appear pink in death, instead of white or blue. When inspired air contains CO levels as low as 0.02%, headache and nausea occur; if the CO concentration is increased to 0.1%, unconsciousness will follow. In heavy smokers, up to 20% of the oxygen-active sites can be blocked by CO.\n\nIn similar fashion, hemoglobin also has competitive binding affinity for [[cyanide]] (CN<sup>\u2212</sup>), [[sulfur monoxide]] (SO), and [[sulfide]] (S<sup>2\u2212</sup>), including [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S). All of these bind to iron in heme without changing its oxidation state, but they nevertheless inhibit oxygen-binding, causing grave toxicity.\n\nThe iron atom in the heme group must initially be in the ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) oxidation state to support oxygen and other gases' binding and transport (it temporarily switches to ferric during the time oxygen is bound, as explained above). Initial oxidation to the ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) state without oxygen converts hemoglobin into \"hem'''i'''globin\" or [[methemoglobin]], which cannot bind oxygen. Hemoglobin in normal red blood cells is protected by a reduction system to keep this from happening. Nitric oxide is capable of converting a small fraction of hemoglobin to methemoglobin in red blood cells. The latter reaction is a remnant activity of the more ancient [[nitric oxide dioxygenase]] function of globins.\n\n===Allosteric===\n{{Further|Oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve}}\nCarbon ''di''oxide occupies a different binding site on the hemoglobin. Carbon dioxide is more readily dissolved in deoxygenated blood, facilitating its removal from the body after the oxygen has been released to tissues undergoing metabolism. This increased affinity for carbon dioxide by the venous blood is known as the [[Haldane effect]]. Through the enzyme [[carbonic anhydrase]], carbon dioxide reacts with water to give [[carbonic acid]], which decomposes into [[bicarbonate]] and [[proton]]s:\n\n:CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> \u2192 HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>\n\n[[Image:Hemoglobin saturation curve.svg|left|thumb|270px|The sigmoidal shape of hemoglobin's oxygen-dissociation curve results from cooperative binding of [[oxygen]] to hemoglobin.]]\nHence, blood with high carbon dioxide levels is also lower in [[pH]] (more [[acid]]ic). Hemoglobin can bind protons and carbon dioxide, which causes a conformational change in the protein and facilitates the release of oxygen. Protons bind at various places on the protein, while carbon dioxide binds at the \u03b1-amino group.<ref>Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M. (2000). ''Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry'', 3rd ed.

The Bohr effect favors the T state rather than the R state. (shifts the O<sub>2</sub>-saturation curve to the ''right''). Conversely, when the carbon dioxide levels in the blood decrease (i.e., in the lung capillaries), carbon dioxide and protons are released from hemoglobin, increasing the oxygen affinity of the protein. A reduction in the total binding capacity of hemoglobin to oxygen (i.e. shifting the curve down, not just to the right) due to reduced pH is called the [[root effect]]. This is seen in bony fish.\n\nIt is necessary for hemoglobin to release the oxygen that it binds; if not, there is no point in binding it. The sigmoidal curve of hemoglobin makes it efficient in binding (taking up O<sub>2</sub> in lungs), and efficient in unloading (unloading O<sub>2</sub> in tissues).<ref>{{YouTube|6AfRX6oh9-E|Lecture \u2013 12 Myoglobin and Hemoglobin }}</ref>\n\nIn people acclimated to high altitudes, the concentration of [[2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate]] (2,3-BPG) in the blood is increased, which allows these individuals to deliver a larger amount of oxygen to tissues under conditions of lower [[oxygen tension]]. This phenomenon, where molecule Y affects the binding of molecule X to a transport molecule Z, is called a ''heterotropic'' allosteric effect. Hemoglobin in organisms at high altitudes has also adapted such that it has less of an affinity for 2,3-BPG and so the protein will be shifted more towards its R state. In its R state, hemoglobin will bind oxygen more readily, thus allowing organisms to perform the necessary metabolic processes when oxygen is present at low partial pressures.<ref>{{Cite book|edition = Eighth|title = Biochemistry|publisher = W.

Free hemoglobin is then cleared from the circulation via the hemoglobin transporter [[CD163]], which is  exclusively expressed on monocytes or macrophages. Within these cells the hemoglobin molecule is broken up, and the iron gets recycled. This process also produces one molecule of carbon monoxide for every molecule of heme degraded.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Kikuchi | first1 = G.\n| last2 = Yoshida | first2 = T.\n| last3 = Noguchi | first3 = M.\n| doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.020\n| title = Heme oxygenase and heme degradation\n| journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications\n| volume = 338\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 558\u201367\n| year = 2005\n| pmid = 16115609\n| pmc =\n}}</ref> Heme degradation is one of the few natural sources of carbon monoxide in the human body, and is responsible for the normal blood levels of carbon monoxide even in people breathing pure air. The other major final product of heme degradation is [[bilirubin]]. Increased levels of this chemical are detected in the blood if red blood cells are being destroyed more rapidly than usual. Improperly degraded hemoglobin protein or hemoglobin that has been released from the blood cells too rapidly can clog small blood vessels, especially the delicate blood filtering vessels of the [[kidney]]s, causing kidney damage.\nIron is removed from heme and salvaged for later use, it is stored as hemosiderin or [[ferritin]] in tissues and transported in plasma by beta globulins as [[transferrin]]s. When the porphyrin ring is broken up, the fragments are normally secreted as a yellow pigment called bilirubin, which is secreted into the intestines as bile. Intestines metabolise bilirubin into urobilinogen. Urobilinogen leaves the body in faeces, in a pigment called stercobilin. Globulin is metabolised into amino acids that are then released into circulation.\n\n==Role in disease==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sickle cell hemoglobin shortened.png|thumb|left|In sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS) glutamic acid in position 6 (in beta chain) is mutated to valine.

However, it can also be pathologically altered in, e.g., [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].\n\nDecrease of hemoglobin, with or without an absolute decrease of red blood cells, leads to symptoms of anemia. Anemia has many different causes, although [[iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]] and its resultant [[iron deficiency anemia]] are the most common causes in the Western world. As absence of iron decreases heme synthesis, red blood cells in iron deficiency anemia are ''hypochromic'' (lacking the red hemoglobin pigment) and ''microcytic'' (smaller than normal). Other anemias are rarer. In [[hemolysis]] (accelerated breakdown of red blood cells), associated [[jaundice]] is caused by the hemoglobin metabolite bilirubin, and the circulating hemoglobin can cause [[renal failure]].\n\nSome mutations in the globin chain are associated with the [[hemoglobinopathy|hemoglobinopathies]], such as sickle-cell disease and [[thalassemia]]. Other mutations, as discussed at the beginning of the article, are benign and are referred to merely as [[hemoglobin variants]].\n\nThere is a group of genetic disorders, known as the ''[[porphyria]]s'' that are characterized by errors in metabolic pathways of heme synthesis. King [[George III of the United Kingdom]] was probably the most famous porphyria sufferer.\n\nTo a small extent, hemoglobin A slowly combines with [[glucose]] at the terminal valine (an alpha aminoacid) of each \u03b2 chain. The resulting molecule is often referred to as [[HbA1c|Hb A<sub>1c</sub>]], a [[glycosylated hemoglobin]]. The binding of glucose to amino acids in the hemoglobin takes place spontaneously (without the help of an enzyme) in many proteins, and is not known to serve a useful purpose. However, as the concentration of glucose in the blood increases, the percentage of Hb A that turns into Hb A<sub>1c</sub> increases. In [[diabetes mellitus|diabetics]] whose glucose usually runs high, the percent Hb A<sub>1c</sub> also runs high. Because of the slow rate of Hb A combination with glucose, the Hb A<sub>1c</sub> percentage reflects a weighted average of blood glucose levels over the lifetime of red cells, which is approximately 120 days.<ref>{{Cite web|title = NGSP: HbA1c and eAG|url = http://www.ngsp.org/A1ceAG.asp|website = www.ngsp.org|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}</ref> The levels of glycosylated hemoglobin are therefore measured in order to monitor the long-term control of the chronic disease of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Poor control of T2DM results in high levels of glycosylated hemoglobin in the red blood cells. The normal reference range is approximately 4.0\u20135.9%. Though difficult to obtain, values less than 7% are recommended for people with T2DM. Levels greater than 9% are associated with poor control of the glycosylated hemoglobin, and levels greater than 12% are associated with very poor control. Diabetics who keep their glycosylated hemoglobin levels close to 7% have a much better chance of avoiding the complications that may accompany diabetes (than those whose levels are 8% or higher).<ref>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=16295 \"Definition of Glycosylated Hemoglobin.\"] Medicine Net.

Measuring it directly would require many samples because blood sugar levels vary widely through the day. Hb A<sub>1c</sub> is the product of the [[irreversible reaction]] of hemoglobin A with glucose. A higher glucose [[concentration]] results in more Hb A<sub>1c</sub>. Because the reaction is slow, the Hb A<sub>1c</sub> proportion represents glucose level in blood averaged over the half-life of red blood cells, is typically 50\u201355 days. An Hb A<sub>1c</sub> proportion of 6.0% or less show good long-term glucose control, while values above 7.0% are elevated.

Or, they may have a recognizable separate [[circulatory system]] but not one that deals with oxygen transport (for example, many [[insect]]s and other [[arthropod]]s).

Appears pink/violet when oxygenated, clear when not.\n\n;[[Chlorocruorin]]: Found in many annelids, it is very similar to erythrocruorin, but the heme group is significantly different in structure. Appears green when deoxygenated and red when oxygenated.\n\n;[[Vanabins]]: Also known as ''[[vanadium]] chromagens'', they are found in the blood of [[sea squirt]]s. They were once hypothesized to use the rare metal vanadium as an oxygen binding prosthetic group. However, although they do contain vanadium by preference, they apparently bind little oxygen, and thus have some other function, which has not been elucidated (sea squirts also contain some hemoglobin). They may act as toxins.\n\n;[[Erythrocruorin]]: Found in many annelids, including [[earthworm]]s, it is a giant free-floating blood protein containing many dozens\u2014possibly hundreds\u2014of iron- and heme-bearing protein subunits bound together into a single protein complex with a molecular mass greater than 3.5 million daltons.\n\n;Pinnaglobin: Only seen in the mollusc ''[[Pinna nobilis]]''. Brown manganese-based porphyrin protein.\n\n;[[Leghemoglobin]]: In leguminous plants, such as alfalfa or soybeans, the nitrogen fixing bacteria in the roots are protected from oxygen by this iron heme containing oxygen-binding protein. The specific enzyme protected is [[nitrogenase]], which is unable to reduce nitrogen gas in the presence of free oxygen.\n\n;[[Coboglobin]]: A synthetic cobalt-based porphyrin. Coboprotein would appear colorless when oxygenated, but yellow when in veins.\n\n==Presence in nonerythroid cells==\nSome nonerythroid cells (i.e., cells other than the red blood cell line) contain hemoglobin. In the brain, these include the A9 [[dopaminergic]] neurons in the [[substantia nigra]], [[astrocyte]]s in the [[cerebral cortex]] and [[hippocampus]], and in all mature [[oligodendrocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Biagioli\"/> It has been suggested that brain hemoglobin in these cells may enable the \"storage of oxygen to provide a homeostatic mechanism in anoxic conditions, which is especially important for A9 DA neurons that have an elevated metabolism with a high requirement for energy production\".<ref name=\"Biagioli\"/> It has been noted further that \"A9 [[dopaminergic]] neurons may be at particular risk since in addition to their high mitochondrial activity they are under intense oxidative stress caused by the production of hydrogen peroxide via autoxidation and/or monoamine oxidase (MAO)-mediated deamination of dopamine and the subsequent reaction of accessible ferrous iron to generate highly toxic hydroxyl radicals\".<ref name=\"Biagioli\"/> This may explain the risk of these cells for degeneration in [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name=\"Biagioli\"/> The hemoglobin-derived iron in these cells is not the cause of the post-mortem darkness of these cells (origin of the Latin name, substantia ''nigra''), but rather is due to [[neuromelanin]].\n\nOutside the brain, hemoglobin has non-oxygen-carrying functions as an [[antioxidant]] and a regulator of [[iron metabolism]] in [[macrophage]]s,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 10359765 | volume=96 | issue=12 | year=1999 | pages=6643\u201347 |vauthors=Liu L, Zeng M, Stamler JS | pmc=21968 | title = Hemoglobin induction in mouse macrophages | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | doi=10.1073/pnas.96.12.6643| bibcode=1999PNAS...96.6643L }}</ref> [[alveolar cell]]s,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16407281 | doi=10.1074/jbc.M509314200 | volume=281 | issue=9 | year=2006 | pages=5668\u201376 |vauthors=Newton DA, Rao KM, Dluhy RA, Baatz JE | title = Hemoglobin Is Expressed by Alveolar Epithelial Cells | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry}}</ref> and [[mesangial cell]]s in the kidney.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Nishi | first1 = H.\n| last2 = Inagi | first2 = R.\n| last3 = Kato | first3 = H.\n| last4 = Tanemoto | first4 = M.\n| last5 = Kojima | first5 = I.\n| last6 = Son | first6 = D.\n| last7 = Fujita | first7 = T.\n| last8 = Nangaku | first8 = M.\n| doi = 10.1681/ASN.2007101085\n| title = Hemoglobin is Expressed by Mesangial Cells and Reduces Oxidant Stress\n| journal = Journal of the American Society of Nephrology\n| volume = 19\n| issue = 8\n| pages = 1500\u201308\n| year = 2008\n| pmid = 18448584\n| pmc =2488266\n}}</ref>\n\n==In history, art and music==\n[[Image:Heart of Steel (Hemoglobin).jpg|thumb|right|''Heart of Steel (Hemoglobin)'' (2005) by [[Julian Voss-Andreae]].

Although the color of the planet is due to iron compounds in combination with oxygen in the Martian soil, it is a common misconception that the iron in hemoglobin and its oxides gives blood its red color. The color is actually due to the [[porphyrin]] [[Functional group|moiety]] of hemoglobin to which the iron is bound, not the iron itself,<ref>{{cite book |title=Pharmacy Practice Manual: A Guide to the Clinical Experience |last=Boh |first=Larry |year=2001 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |isbn=978-0781725415 }}</ref> although the ligation and redox state of the iron can influence the pi to pi* or n to pi* electronic transitions of the porphyrin and hence its optical characteristics.\n\nArtist [[Julian Voss-Andreae]] created a [[sculpture]] called \"Heart of Steel (Hemoglobin)\" in 2005, based on the protein's backbone.

The region has numerous remains from the [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], and [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]], such as [[Stonehenge]] and [[Avebury]]. In the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]], England, like all of Britain south of the [[Firth of Forth]], was inhabited by the [[Celts|Celtic]] people known as the [[Celtic Britons|Britons]], including some [[Belgae|Belgic]] tribes (e.g. the [[Atrebates]], the [[Catuvellauni]], the [[Trinovantes]], etc.) in the south east.  In AD 43 the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] began; the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] maintained control of their [[Roman Britain|province of Britannia]] until the early 5th century.\n\nThe [[end of Roman rule in Britain]] facilitated the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]], which historians often regard as the origin of England and of the [[English people]].  The [[Anglo-Saxons]], a collection of various [[Germanic peoples]], established several kingdoms that became the primary powers in present-day England and parts of southern [[Scotland]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/anglo_saxons/saxons.shtml The Anglo-Saxons], BBC \u2013 History</ref> They introduced the [[Old English]] language, which largely displaced the previous [[Common Brittonic|British language]].  The Anglo-Saxons warred with British successor states in [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], and the ''[[Hen Ogledd]]'' (Old North; the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]]-speaking parts of northern England and southern Scotland), as well as with each other.  Raids by [[Vikings]] became frequent after about AD 800, and the [[Norsemen]] settled in large parts of what is now England.  During this period, several rulers attempted to unite the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, an effort that led to the emergence of the [[Kingdom of England]] by the 10th century.\n\nIn 1066, a [[Norman conquest of England|Norman expedition invaded and conquered England]].  The [[House of Normandy|Norman dynasty]] established by [[William the Conqueror]] ruled England for over half a century before the period of succession crisis known as [[the Anarchy]] (1135\u20131154).  Following the Anarchy, England came under the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet]], a dynasty which later inherited claims to the [[Kingdom of France]]. During this period, the [[Magna Carta]] was signed. A succession crisis in France led to the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337\u20131453), a series of conflicts involving the peoples of both nations.  Following the Hundred Years' Wars, England became embroiled in its own succession wars. The [[Wars of the Roses]] pitted two branches of the House of Plantagenet against one another, the [[House of York]] and the [[House of Lancaster]]. The Lancastrian [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] ended the War of the Roses and established the [[Tudor dynasty]] in 1485.\n\nUnder the Tudors and the later [[Stuart dynasty]], England became a colonial power. During the rule of the Stuarts, the [[English Civil War]] took place between the Parliamentarians and the Royalists, which resulted in the execution of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] (1649) and the establishment of a series of republican governments \u2014 first, a Parliamentary republic known as the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649\u20131653), then a military dictatorship under [[Oliver Cromwell]] known as [[The Protectorate]] (1653\u20131659).  The Stuarts returned to the restored throne in 1660, though continued questions over religion and power resulted in the deposition of another Stuart king, [[James II of England|James II]], in the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688). England, which had conquered [[Wales]] in the 13th century, united with Scotland in 1707 to form a new sovereign state called [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]].<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/uniting.htm Uniting the kingdom?] nationalarchives.gov.uk, accessed 2 July 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/scotlandshistory/unioncrownsparliaments/unionofparliaments/index.asp The Union of the Parliaments 1707] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102060414/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/scotlandshistory/unioncrownsparliaments/unionofparliaments/index.asp |date=2 January 2012 }} [[Learning and Teaching Scotland]], accessed 2 July 2011</ref><ref>Union with England Act 1707, Article II</ref> Following the [[Industrial Revolution]], Great Britain ruled a colonial [[British Empire|Empire]], the largest in recorded history.

However, {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}}, its cultural impact remains widespread and deep in many of them.\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{main|Prehistoric Britain}}\n\n===Stone Age===\n[[File:Stonehenge Closeup.jpg|thumb|[[Stonehenge]], erected in several stages from c.3000-1500BC]]\n\nThe time from Britain's first inhabitation until the [[last glacial maximum]] is known as the Old Stone Age, or [[Palaeolithic|Palaeolithic era]]. Archaeological evidence indicates that what was to become England was colonised by humans long before the rest of the British Isles because of its more hospitable climate between and during the various [[glacial period]]s of the distant past. This earliest evidence, from Happisburgh in Norfolk, includes the oldest human footprints found outside Africa, and points to dates of more than 800,000 [[Before Present|BP]].<ref name=Happisburgh /> These earliest inhabitants were [[hunter-gatherers]]. Low sea-levels meant that Britain was attached to the continent for much of this earliest period of history, and varying temperatures over tens of thousands of years meant that it was not always inhabited.<ref name=\"Francis Pryor 2003\">Francis Pryor, ''Britain BC'', 2003.</ref>\n\nEngland has been continually inhabited since the last Ice Age ended around 9,000 BC, the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, or [[Mesolithic|Mesolithic era]]. Rising sea-levels cut off Britain from the continent for the last time around 6500 BC. The population by then was exclusively [[anatomically modern humans]], and the evidence suggests that their societies were increasingly complex and they were manipulating their environment and prey in new ways, possibly selective burning of then omnipresent woodland to create clearings for herds to gather and then hunt them. Hunting was mainly done with simple projectile weapons such as [[javelin]] and possibly [[sling (weapon)|sling]]. Bow and arrow was known in Western Europe since least 9000 BC. The climate continued to warm and the population probably rose.<ref>V Gaffney, S Fitch and D Smith 2009, ''Europe's Lost World: The Rediscovery of Doggerland''.</ref>\n\nThe New Stone Age, or [[Neolithic|Neolithic era]], began with the introduction of farming, ultimately from the Middle East, around 4000 BC. It is not known whether this was caused by a substantial folk movement or native adoption of foreign practices or both. People began to lead a more settled lifestyle. Monumental collective tombs were built for the dead in the form of chambered cairns and long barrows. Towards the end of the period, other kinds of monumental stone alignments begin to appear, such as Stonehenge; their cosmic alignments show a preoccupation with the sky and planets. Flint technology produced a number of highly artistic pieces as well as purely pragmatic. More extensive woodland clearance was done for fields and pastures. The [[Sweet Track]] in the [[Somerset Levels]] is one of the oldest [[timber trackway]]s known in Northern Europe and among the oldest roads in the world, dated by [[dendrochronology]] to the winter of 3807\u20133806 BC; it too is thought to have been a primarily religious structure.<ref name=\"Francis Pryor 2003\"/>\n\n===Later Prehistory===\n[[File:Maiden Castle, Dorchester..jpg|thumb|View of the ramparts of the developed hillfort of [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]], as they look today]]\n\nThe [[Bronze Age]] began around 2500 BC with the appearance of bronze objects. This coincides with the appearance of the characteristic [[Beaker culture]]; again this might have occurred primarily by folk movement or by cultural assimilation or both. The Bronze Age saw a shift of emphasis from the communal to the individual, and the rise of increasingly powerful elites whose power came from their prowess as hunters and warriors and their controlling the flow of precious resources to manipulate tin and copper into high-status bronze objects such as swords and axes. Settlement became increasingly permanent and intensive. Towards the end of the Bronze Age, many examples of very fine metalwork began to be deposited in rivers, presumably for ritual reasons and perhaps reflecting a progressive change in emphasis from the sky to the earth, as a rising population put increasing pressure on the land. England largely became bound up with the [[Atlantic Bronze Age|Atlantic trade system]], which created a cultural continuum over a large part of Western Europe.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Francis Pryor, ''Britain BC'', 2003</ref> It is possible that the [[Celtic languages]] developed or spread to England as part of this system; by the end of the Iron Age there is much evidence that they were spoken across all England and western parts of Britain.<ref>Barry Cunliffe, ''The Ancient Celts'', 1997</ref>\n\nThe [[Iron Age]] is conventionally said to begin around 800 BC. The Atlantic system had by this time effectively collapsed, although England maintained contacts across the Channel with France, as the [[Hallstatt culture]] became widespread across the country. Its continuity suggests it was not accompanied by substantial movement of population; crucially, only a single Hallstatt burial is known from Britain, and even here the evidence is inconclusive. On the whole, burials largely disappear across England, and the dead were disposed of in a way which is archaeologically invisible: [[excarnation]] is a widely cited possibility. [[Hillfort]]s were known since the Late Bronze Age, but a huge number were constructed during 600\u2013400 BC, particularly in the South, while after about 400 BC new forts were rarely built and many ceased to be regularly inhabited, while a few forts become more and more intensively occupied, suggesting a degree of regional centralisation. Around this time the earliest mentions of Britain appear in the annals of history. The first historical mention of the region is from the [[Massaliote Periplus]], a sailing manual for merchants thought to date to the 6th century BC, and [[Pytheas of Massilia]] wrote of his exploratory voyage to the island around 325 BC. Both of these texts are now lost; although quoted by later writers, not enough survives to inform the archaeological interpretation to any significant degree.\n\nContact with the continent was less than in the Bronze Age but still significant. Goods continued to move to England, with a possible hiatus around 350 to 150 BC. There were a few armed invasions of hordes of migrating Celts. There are two known invasions. Around 300 BC, a group from the Gaulish [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]] tribe apparently took over East Yorkshire, establishing the highly distinctive [[Arras culture]]. And from around 150\u2013100 BC, groups of Belgae began to control significant parts of the South. These invasions constituted movements of a few people who established themselves as a warrior elite atop existing native systems, rather than replacing them. The Belgic invasion was much larger than the Parisian settlement, but the continuity of pottery style shows that the native population remained in place. Yet, it was accompanied by significant socio-economic change. Proto-urban, or even urban settlements, known as [[oppidum|oppida]], begin to eclipse the old hillforts, and an elite whose position is based on battle prowess and the ability to manipulate resources re-appears much more distinctly.<ref>Barry Cunliffe, ''Iron Age Communities in Britain'', 2005</ref>\n\nIn 55 and 54 BC, [[Julius Caesar]], as part of [[Gallic Wars|his campaigns in Gaul]], [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invaded Britain]] and claimed to have scored a number of victories, but he never penetrated further than Hertfordshire and could not establish a province. However, his invasions mark a turning-point in British history. Control of trade, the flow of resources and prestige goods, became ever more important to the elites of Southern Britain; Rome steadily became the biggest player in all their dealings, as the provider of great wealth and patronage. A full-scale invasion and annexation was inevitable, in retrospect.<ref>Guy de la Bedoyere, ''Roman Britain: A New History'', 2010</ref>\n\n===Genetic history of the English===\n{{main|Genetic history of the British Isles}}\n\nThe Roman historian [[Tacitus]] wrote in his ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'', completed in AD 98,<ref>Mattingly, H. & Handford, S.A. (trans.), ''The Agricola and the Germania'' (Revised edition), Penguin Classics, 1970, p.&nbsp;10.</ref> that the various groupings of [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]] shared physical characteristics with continental peoples. The [[Caledonians]], inhabitants of what is now [[Scotland]], had red hair and large limbs, indicating a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] origin; the [[Silures]], of what is now [[South Wales]], were swarthy with curly hair, indicating a link with the [[Iberians]] of the Roman provinces of [[Hispania]], in what is now Portugal and Spain; and the Britons nearest the [[Gauls]] of mainland Europe resembled the Gauls.<ref>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' chapter 11.</ref> This gross oversimplification is somewhat true until today. Some archaeologists and geneticists have challenged the long-held assumption that the invading Anglo-Saxons wiped out the native Britons in England when they invaded, pointing instead to the possibility of a more limited folk movement bringing a new language and culture which the natives gradually assimilated.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nDebate continues about the ultimate origins of the people of the British Isles. In 2003 and 2006 respectively, [[Bryan Sykes]] and [[Stephen Oppenheimer]] both argued for continuity since the Mesolithic, with much input from the East during the Neolithic.<ref>Stephen Oppenheimer, ''The Origins of the British, 2006</ref><ref>Bryan Sykes, ''Blood of the Isles'', 2003</ref> However, the [[haplotypes]] which Sykes and Oppenheimer associated with Spain hailed ultimately from [[Asia Minor]], which might be more consistent with some kind of Neolithic wipeout, although it is impossible to date this gene flow.<ref>Myres et al, ''A major Y-chromosome haplogroup R1b Holocene era founder effect in Central and Western Europe'' in ''European Journal of Human Genetics'', 2010</ref> Other theories have proposed an even greater input in the Early Bronze Age than previously thought.

Biological differences between the English and the Welsh were confirmed by tests at [[University College London]], in which the native English population's DNA correlated to others in Germanic parts of Northern Europe traceable through their Y chromosome.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2076470.stm</ref>\n\n==Roman Britain==\n{{main|Roman Britain}}\n[[File:Prima tetrarchia Diocletianus.PNG|thumbnail|[[Roman Empire]], 3rd century.]]\n[[File:Hadrians Wall from Housesteads1.jpg|thumb|[[Hadrian's Wall]] viewed from [[Vercovicium]]]]\nAfter Caesar's expeditions, the Romans began real attempt to [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquer Britain]] in 43 AD, at the behest of Emperor [[Claudius]]. They landed in Kent and defeated two armies led by the kings of the [[Catuvellauni]] tribe, [[Caratacus]] and [[Togodumnus]], in battles at the Medway and the Thames. Togodumnus was killed, and Caratacus fled to Wales. The Roman force, led by Aulus Plautius, waited for Claudius to come and lead the final march on the Catuvellauni capital at [[Camulodunum]] (modern [[Colchester]]), before he returned to Rome for his triumph. The Catuvellauni held sway over most of the southeastern corner of England; eleven local rulers surrendered, a number of client kingdoms were established, and the rest became a Roman province with Camulodunum as its capital.<ref>Henry Freeman, ''Roman Britain: A History From Beginning to End'' (2016).</ref> Over the next four years, the territory was consolidated and the future emperor [[Vespasian]] led a campaign into the Southwest where he subjugated two more tribes. By 54 AD the border had been pushed back to the Severn and the Trent, and campaigns were underway to subjugate Northern England and Wales. \n\nBut in 60 AD, under the leadership of the warrior-queen [[Boudicca]], the tribes rebelled against the Romans. At first, the rebels had great success. They burned Camulodunum, [[Londinium]] and [[Verulamium]] to the ground. There is some archaeological evidence that the same happened at Winchester. The Second Legion Augusta, stationed at [[Exeter]], refused to move for fear of revolt among the locals. Londinium governor [[Suetonius Paulinus]] evacuated the city before the rebels sacked and burned it; the fire was so hot that a ten-inch layer of melted red clay remains 15 feet below London's streets.<ref>{{cite book |title=Making Europe: The Story of the West, Volume I to 1790 |date=2013 |page=162}}</ref> In the end, the rebels were said to have killed 70,000 Romans and Roman sympathizers. Paulinus gathered what was left of the Roman army. In the [[Battle of Watling Street|decisive battle]], 10,000 Romans faced nearly 100,000 warriors somewhere along the line of [[Watling Street]], at the end of which Boudicca was utterly defeated. It was said that 80,000 rebels were killed, but only 400 Romans. \n\nOver the next 20 years, the borders expanded just a little, but the governor Agricola incorporated into the province the last pockets of independence in Wales and Northern England. He also led a campaign into Scotland which was recalled by Emperor Domitian. The border gradually formed along the [[Stanegate]] road in Northern England, solidified by [[Hadrian's Wall]] built in 138 AD, despite temporary forays into Scotland. The Romans and their culture stayed in charge for 350 years. [[Roman sites in Great Britain|Traces of their presence]] are ubiquitous throughout England.\n\n==The Anglo-Saxon migration==\n{{main |Sub-Roman Britain}}\n{{see | Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain}}\n[[File:Britain peoples circa 600.svg|thumb|Kingdoms and tribes in [[Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]], c.700 AD]]\n\nIn the wake of the breakdown of Roman rule in Britain from the middle of the fourth century, present day England was progressively settled by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] groups. Collectively known as the \"[[Anglo-Saxons]]\", these were [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]] from what is now the Danish/German border area and [[Jutes]] from the Jutland peninsula. The entire region was referred to as \"[[Hwicce]]\", and settlements throughout the south were called [[Gewisse]]. The [[Battle of Deorham]] was a critical in establishing Anglo-Saxon rule in 577.<ref>http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/wessex.html</ref> Saxon mercenaries existed in Britain since before the late Roman period, but the main influx of population probably happened after the fifth century. The precise nature of these invasions is not fully known; there are doubts about the legitimacy of historical accounts due to a lack of archaeological finds. [[Gildas]] Sapiens's ''De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae'', composed in the 6th century, states that when the Roman army departed the Isle of Britannia in the 4th century CE, the indigenous Britons were invaded by [[Picts]], their neighbours to the north (now Scotland) and the [[Scoti|Scots]] (now Ireland). Britons invited the [[Saxons]] to the island to repel them but after they vanquished the Scots and Picts, the Saxons turned against the Britons.\n\nSeven Kingdoms are traditionally identified as being established by these Saxon migrants. Three were clustered in the South east: [[Sussex]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] and [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]]. The Midlands were dominated by the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]]. The [[List of monarchs of Mercia|Monarchs of Mercia]]'s lineage was determined to reach as far back as the early 500's. To the north was [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] which unified two earlier kingdoms, [[Bernicia]] and [[Deira]]. Eventually, the kingdoms were dominated by [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] and [[Mercia]] in the 7th century, [[Mercia]] in the 8th century and then [[Wessex]] in the 9th century. [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] extended its control north into [[Scotland]] and west into [[Wales]]. It also subdued [[Mercia]] whose first powerful King, [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]], was killed by [[Oswiu of Northumbria|Oswy]] in 655. Northumbria's power began to wane after 685 with the defeat and death of its king [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria|Aegfrith]] at the hands of the [[Picts]]. Mercian power reached its peak under the rule of [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]], who from 785 had influence over most of Anglo-Saxon England. Since Offa's death in 796, the supremacy of [[Wessex]] was established under [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]] who extended control west into [[Cornwall]] before defeating the Mercians at the [[Battle of Ellendun]] in 825. Four years later, he received submission and tribute from the Northumbrian king, [[Eanred of Northumbria|Eanred]].<ref>Stenton, Frank. \"Anglo-Saxon England\". OUP, 1971</ref>\n\nThe history of the fifth and sixth centuries is particularly difficult to access, peppered with a mixture of mythology, such as the characters of [[Hengist and Horsa]], and legend, such as St [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus]]'s so-called \"Alleluia Victory\" against the Heathens, and half-remembered history, such as the exploits of [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] and [[King Arthur]]. However, the belief that the Saxons wiped or drove out all the native Britons from England has been widely discredited by a number of archaeologists since the 2000s. Anyway Anglo-Saxons and Saxonified Britons spread into England, by a combination of military conquest and cultural assimilation. By the eighth century, a kind of England had emerged.<ref>Francis Pryor, ''Britain AD'', 2004</ref><ref>Geoffrey Hindley, ''The Anglo-Saxons'', 2006</ref>\n\n==Heptarchy and Christianisation==\n[[File:British kingdoms c 800.svg|thumb|Britain c. 800]]\n{{main|Northumbria|Mercia|Offa of Mercia|Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon Christianity}}\n\n[[Christianity in the British isles 410-1066|Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England]] began around AD 600, influenced by [[Celtic Christianity]] from the northwest and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] from the southeast. [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]], the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], took office in 597. In 601, he baptised the first Christian Anglo-Saxon king, [[Aethelbert of Kent]]. The last pagan Anglo-Saxon king, [[Penda of Mercia]], died in 655. The last pagan [[Jutes|Jutish]] king, [[Arwald]] of the [[Isle of Wight]] was killed in 686. The [[Anglo-Saxon mission]] on the continent took off in the 8th century, leading to the Christianisation of practically all of the [[Frankish Empire]] by 800.\n\nThroughout the 7th and 8th century power fluctuated between the larger kingdoms. [[Bede]] records [[Aethelbert of Kent]] as being dominant at the close of the 6th century, but power seems to have shifted northwards to the kingdom of Northumbria, which was formed from the amalgamation of Bernicia and Deira. [[Edwin of Northumbria]] probably held dominance over much of Britain, though Bede's Northumbrian bias should be kept in mind. Due to succession crises, Northumbrian hegemony was not constant, and [[Mercia]] remained a very powerful kingdom, especially under Penda. Two defeats ended Northumbrian dominance: the Battle of the Trent in 679 against Mercia, and Nechtanesmere in 685 against the [[Picts]].<ref>Frank Merry Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (1971).</ref>\n\nThe so-called \"Mercian Supremacy\" dominated the 8th century, though it was not constant. Aethelbald and [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]], the two most powerful kings, achieved high status; indeed, Offa was considered the overlord of south Britain by [[Charlemagne]]. His power is illustrated by the fact that he summoned the resources to build [[Offa's Dyke]]. However, a rising Wessex, and challenges from smaller kingdoms, kept Mercian power in check, and by the early 9th century the \"Mercian Supremacy\" was over.\n\nThis period has been described as the [[Heptarchy]], though this term has now fallen out of academic use. The term arose because the seven kingdoms of [[Northumbria]], [[Mercia]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]] and [[Kingdom of Wessex|Wessex]] were the main polities of south Britain. Other small kingdoms were also politically important across this period: [[Hwicce]], [[Magonsaete]], [[Kingdom of Lindsey|Lindsey]] and Middle Anglia.<ref>Peter Hayes Sawyer, ''From Roman Britain to Norman England'' (Routledge, 2002).</ref>\n\n==Viking challenge and the rise of Wessex==\n{{main|Danelaw|Viking Age|Alfred the Great}}\n\n[[File:England 878.svg|thumb|England in 878]]\n\nThe first recorded landing of [[Viking]]s took place in 787 in [[Dorset]]shire, on the south-west coast.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rees|first=Rosemary|title=The Vikings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYOQ77RWygsC&pg=PA45|year=2002|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=9781403401007|page=45}}</ref> The first major attack in Britain was in 793 at [[Lindisfarne]] monastery as given by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''. However, by then the Vikings were almost certainly well-established in [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]], and many other non-recorded raids probably occurred before this. Records do show the first Viking attack on [[Iona]] taking place in 794. The arrival of the Vikings (in particular the Danish [[Great Heathen Army]]) upset the political and social geography of Britain and Ireland. In 867 [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] fell to the Danes; [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]] fell in 869. Though [[Wessex]] managed to contain the Vikings by defeating them at [[Battle of Ashdown|Ashdown]] in 871, a second invading army landed, leaving the Saxons on a defensive footing. At much the same time, [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]], king of Wessex died and was succeeded by his younger brother [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]]. Alfred was immediately confronted with the task of defending Wessex against the Danes. He spent the first five years of his reign paying the invaders off. In 878, Alfred's forces were overwhelmed at Chippenham in a surprise attack.<ref>Albany F. Major, ''Early wars of Wessex'' (Hildreth Press, 2008).</ref>\n\nIt was only now, with the independence of Wessex hanging by a thread, that Alfred emerged as a great king. In May 878 he led a force that defeated the Danes at [[Battle of Edington|Edington]]. The victory was so complete that the Danish leader, [[Guthrum]], was forced to accept Christian baptism and withdraw from [[Mercia]]. Alfred then set about strengthening the defences of Wessex, building a new navy\u201460 vessels strong. Alfred's success bought Wessex and Mercia years of peace and sparked economic recovery in previously ravaged areas.<ref>Richard P. Ables, ''Alfred the great: war, kingship and culture I'm Anglo-Saxon England'' (1998).</ref>\n\nAlfred's success was sustained by his son [[Edward the Elder|Edward]], whose decisive victories over the Danes in East Anglia in 910 and 911 were followed by a crushing victory at Tempsford in 917. These military gains allowed Edward to fully incorporate Mercia into his kingdom and add East Anglia to his conquests. Edward then set about reinforcing his northern borders against the Danish [[kingdom of Northumbria]]. Edward's rapid conquest of the English kingdoms meant Wessex received homage from those that remained, including [[Gwynedd]] in Wales and Scotland. His dominance was reinforced by his son [[\u00c6thelstan]], who extended the borders of Wessex northward, in 927 conquering the [[Kingdom of York]] and leading a land and naval invasion of [[Scotland]]. These conquests led to his adopting the title 'King of the English' for the first time.\n\nThe dominance and independence of England was maintained by the kings that followed. It was not until 978 and the accession of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] that the Danish threat resurfaced. Two powerful Danish kings ([[Harold Bluetooth]] and later his son [[Sweyn Forkbeard|Sweyn]]) both launched devastating invasions of England. Anglo-Saxon forces were resoundingly defeated at [[Battle of Maldon|Maldon]] in 991. More Danish attacks followed, and their victories were frequent. \u00c6thelred's control over his nobles began to falter, and he grew increasingly desperate. His solution was to pay off the Danes: for almost 20 years he paid increasingly large sums to the Danish nobles to keep them from English coasts. These payments, known as [[Danegeld]]s, crippled the English economy.<ref>Michael K. Lawson,  \"The collection of Danegeld and Heregeld in the reigns of Aethelred II and Cnut.\" ''English Historical Review'' 99.393 (1984): 721-738. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/569175 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n[[\u00c6thelred the Unready|\u00c6thelred]] then made an alliance with [[Normandy]] in 1001 through marriage to the Duke's daughter [[Emma of Normandy|Emma]], in the hope of strengthening England. Then he then made a great error: in 1002 he ordered the massacre of all the Danes in England. In response, Sweyn began a decade of devastating attacks on England. Northern England, with its sizable Danish population, sided with Sweyn. By 1013, London, Oxford, and Winchester had fallen to the Danes. \u00c6thelred fled to [[Normandy]] and Sweyn seized the throne. Sweyn suddenly died in 1014, and \u00c6thelred returned to England, confronted by Sweyn's successor, [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]]. However, in 1016, \u00c6thelred also suddenly died. Cnut swiftly defeated the remaining Saxons, killing \u00c6thelred's son [[Edmund Ironside|Edmund]] in the process. Cnut seized the throne, crowning himself King of England.<ref>Thames Cussans, ''Kings and Queens of the British Isles'' (The Times Books, 2002), pp.32-35.</ref>\n\n==English unification==\n{{main|Athelstan|Edgar of England}}\n[[File:Edward the Elder coin imitation silver brooch Rome Italy c 920.jpg|thumb|Silver brooch imitating a coin of Edward the Elder, c. 920, found in Rome, Italy. [[British Museum]].]]\n[[Alfred of Wessex]] died in 899 and was succeeded by his son [[Edward the Elder]]. Edward, and his brother-in-law [[\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians|\u00c6thelred]] of (what was left of) Mercia, began a programme of expansion, building forts and towns on an Alfredian model. On \u00c6thelred's death, his wife (Edward's sister) [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]] ruled as \"Lady of the Mercians\" and continued expansion. It seems Edward had his son \u00c6thelstan brought up in the Mercian court, and on Edward's death [[Athelstan]] succeeded to the Mercian kingdom, and, after some uncertainty, Wessex.\n\n\u00c6thelstan continued the expansion of his father and aunt and was the first king to achieve direct rulership of what we would now consider England. The titles attributed to him in [[Anglo-Saxon Charters|charters]] and on coins suggest a still more widespread dominance. His expansion aroused ill-feeling among the other kingdoms of Britain, and he defeated a combined Scottish-Viking army at the [[Battle of Brunanburh]]. However, the unification of England was not a certainty. Under \u00c6thelstan's successors [[Edmund II of England|Edmund]] and [[Edred of England|Eadred]] the English kings repeatedly lost and regained control of Northumbria. Nevertheless, [[Edgar of England|Edgar]], who ruled the same expanse as Athelstan, consolidated the kingdom, which remained united thereafter.\n\n==England under the Danes and the Norman conquest==\n{{main|Ethelred the Unready|Canute the Great|Eir\u00edkr H\u00e1konarson|Norman conquest of England}}\n[[File:U 344, Orkesta.JPG|right|thumb|The [[England Runestones#U 344|rune stone U 344]] was raised in memory of a Viking who went to England three times.]]\nThere were renewed Scandinavian attacks on England at the end of the 10th century. [[\u00c6thelred the Unready|\u00c6thelred]] ruled a long reign but ultimately lost his kingdom to [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sweyn of Denmark]], though he recovered it following the latter's death. However, \u00c6thelred's son [[Edmund II Ironside]] died shortly afterwards, allowing [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]], Sweyn's son, to become king of England. Under his rule the kingdom became the centre of government for the [[North Sea Empire|North Sea empire]] which included Denmark and Norway.\n\nCnut was succeeded by his sons, but in 1042 the native dynasty was restored with the accession of [[Edward the Confessor]]. Edward's failure to produce an heir caused a furious conflict over the succession on his death in 1066. His struggles for power against [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]], the claims of Cnut's Scandinavian successors, and the ambitions of the [[Normans]] whom Edward introduced to English politics to bolster his own position caused each to vie for control of Edward's reign.\n\n[[Harold Godwinson]] became king, probably appointed by Edward on his deathbed and endorsed by the [[Witan]]. But [[William of Normandy]], [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardr\u00e5de]] (aided by Harold Godwin's estranged brother [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]]) and [[Sweyn II of Denmark]] all asserted claims to the throne. By far the strongest hereditary claim was that of [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]], but due to his youth and apparent lack of powerful supporters, he did not play a major part in the struggles of 1066, although he was made king for a short time by the Witan after the death of Harold Godwinson.\n\nIn September 1066, [[Harald III of Norway]] and [[Tostig Godwinson|Earl Tostig]] [[Harald III of Norway#Invasion of England|landed in Northern England]] with a force of around 15,000 men and 300 [[longship]]s. [[Harold Godwinson]] defeated the invaders and killed Harald III of Norway and Tostig at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]].\n\nOn 28 September 1066, [[William of Normandy]] [[Norman Conquest#Norman invasion|invaded England]] in a campaign called the [[Norman Conquest]]. After marching from [[Yorkshire]], Harold's exhausted army was defeated and Harold was killed at the [[Battle of Hastings]] on 14 October. Further opposition to William in support of [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]] soon collapsed, and William was crowned king on Christmas Day 1066. For five years, he faced a series of rebellions in various parts of England and a half-hearted Danish invasion, but he subdued them and established an enduring regime.\n\n==Norman England==\n\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry WillelmDux.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the [[Battle of Hastings]] (1066) on the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\nThe [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] led to a profound change in the history of the English state. William ordered the compilation of the [[Domesday Book]], a survey of the entire population and their lands and property for tax purposes, which reveals that within 20 years of the conquest the English ruling class had been almost entirely dispossessed and replaced by Norman landholders, who monopolised all senior positions in the government and the Church. William and his nobles spoke and conducted court in [[Norman language|Norman French]], in both Normandy and England. The use of the Anglo-Norman language by the aristocracy endured for centuries and left an indelible mark in the development of modern English.\n\nUpon being crowned, on Christmas Day 1066, William immediately began consolidating his power. By 1067, he faced revolts on all sides and spent four years crushing them. He then imposed his superiority over Scotland and Wales, forcing them to recognise him as overlord.\n\nThe English [[Middle Ages]] were characterised by [[civil war]], international war, occasional insurrection, and widespread political intrigue among the aristocratic and monarchic elite. England was more than self-sufficient in cereals, dairy products, beef and mutton. Its international economy was based on [[Wool#History|wool trade]], in which wool from the [[sheepwalk]]s of northern England was exported to the textile cities of [[Flanders]], where it was worked into cloth. Medieval foreign policy was as much shaped by relations with the Flemish textile industry as it was by dynastic adventures in western France. An English textile industry was established in the 15th century, providing the basis for rapid English capital accumulation.\n\n[[Henry I of England|Henry I]], the fourth son of [[William I the Conqueror]], succeeded his elder brother [[William II of England|William II]] as [[King of England]] in 1100. Henry was also known as \"Henry Beauclerc\" because he received a formal education, unlike his older brother and [[heir apparent]] [[William II of England|William]] who and got practical training to be king. Henry worked hard to reform and stabilise the country and smooth the differences between the Anglo-Saxon and [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] societies. The loss of his son, [[William Adelin]], in the wreck of the [[White Ship]] in November 1120, undermined his reforms. This problem regarding succession cast a long shadow over English history.\n\nHenry I had required the leading barons, ecclesiastics and officials in Normandy and England, to take an oath to accept [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] (also known as Empress Maud, Henry I's daughter) as his heir. England was far less than enthusiastic to accept an outsider, and a woman, as their ruler.\n\nThere is some evidence that Henry was unsure of his own hopes and the oath to make Matilda his heir. Probably Henry hoped Matilda would have a son and step aside as Queen Mother. Upon Henry's death, the Norman and English barons ignored Matilda's claim to the throne, and thus through a series of decisions, [[Stephen I of England|Stephen]], Henry's favourite nephew, was welcomed by many in England and Normandy as their new king.\n\nOn 22 December 1135, Stephen was anointed king with implicit support by the church and nation. Matilda and her own son waited in France until she sparked the civil war from 1139\u20131153 known as [[the Anarchy]]. In the autumn of 1139, she invaded England with her illegitimate half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]]. Her husband, [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou|Geoffroy V of Anjou]], conquered Normandy but did not cross the channel to help his wife. During this breakdown of central authority, nobles built [[adulterine castle]]s (i.e. castles erected without government permission), which were hated by the peasants, who were forced to build and maintain them.\n\nStephen was captured, and his government fell. Matilda was proclaimed queen but was soon at odds with her subjects and was expelled from London. The war continued until 1148, when Matilda returned to France. Stephen reigned unopposed until his death in 1154, although his hold on the throne was uneasy. As soon as he regained power, he began to demolish the adulterine castles, but kept a few castles standing, which put him at odds with his heir. His contested reign, [[the Anarchy|civil war]] and lawlessness broke out saw a major swing in power towards [[feudal]] [[baron]]s. In trying to appease Scottish and Welsh raiders, he handed over large tracts of land.\n\n==England under the Plantagenets==\n{{Further|House of Plantagenet}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\n\nEmpress Matilda and [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou|Geoffroy's]] son, Henry, resumed the invasion; he was already Count of Anjou, Duke of Normandy and Duke of Aquitaine when he landed in England. When Stephen's son and heir apparent [[Eustace IV|Eustace]] died in 1153, Stephen made an agreement with Henry of [[Anjou]] (who became [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]) to succeed Stephen and guarantee peace between them. The union was retrospectively named the [[Angevin Empire]]. Henry II destroyed the remaining adulterine castles and expanded his power through various means and to different levels into Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Flanders, Nantes, Brittany, Quercy, Toulouse, Bourges and Auvergne.\n\nThe reign of Henry II represents a reversion in power from the barony to the monarchical state in England; it was also to see a similar redistribution of legislative power from the Church, again to the monarchical state. This period also presaged a properly constituted legislation and a radical shift away from [[feudalism]]. In his reign, new [[Anglo-Angevin]] and [[Anglo-Aquitanian]] aristocracies developed, though not to the same degree as the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] once did, and the Norman nobles interacted with their French peers.\n\nHenry's successor, [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] \"the Lion Heart\" (also known as \"The absent king\"), was preoccupied with foreign wars, taking part in the [[Third Crusade]], being captured while returning and pledging fealty to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as part of his ransom, and defending his French territories against Philip II of France. His successor, his younger brother [[John of England|John]], lost much of those territories including Normandy following the disastrous [[Battle of Bouvines]] in 1214, despite having in 1212 made the [[Kingdom of England]] a tribute-paying vassal of the [[Holy See]], which it remained until the 14th century when the Kingdom rejected the overlordship of the [[Holy See]] and re-established its sovereignty.\n\nFrom 1212 onwards, John had a constant policy of maintaining close relations with the Pope, which partially explains how he persuaded the Pope to reject the legitimacy of the [[Magna Carta]].\n\n===Magna Carta===\n{{main|Magna Carta}}\n[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|One of only four surviving [[Exemplified copy|exemplifications]] of the 1215 text, ''Cotton MS. Augustus II. 106'', property of the [[British Library]]]]\nOver the course of his reign, a combination of higher taxes, unsuccessful wars and conflict with the Pope made King John unpopular with his barons. In 1215, some of the most important barons rebelled against him. He met their leaders along with their French and Scot allies at [[Runnymede]], near London on 15 June 1215 to seal the [[Magna Carta|Great Charter]] (''Magna Carta'' in [[Latin (language)|Latin]]), which imposed legal limits on the king's personal powers. But as soon as hostilities ceased, John received approval from the Pope to break his word because he had made it under duress. This provoked the [[First Barons' War]] and a French invasion by [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis]] of France invited by a majority of the English barons to replace John as king in London in May 1216. John travelled around the country to oppose the rebel forces, directing, among other operations, a two-month siege of the rebel-held [[Rochester Castle]].\n\n===Henry III===\n{{main|Henry III of England}}\nJohn's son, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], was only 9 years old when he became king (1216\u20131272). He spent much of his reign fighting the barons over the Magna Carta <ref>https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/magna-carta-muse-and-mentor/confirmation-by-kings-and-parliament.html</ref> and the royal rights, and was eventually forced to call the first \"[[Parliament of England|parliament]]\" in 1264. He was also unsuccessful on the Continent, where he endeavoured to re-establish English control over [[Normandy]], [[Anjou]], and [[Aquitaine]].\n\nHis reign was punctuated by many rebellions and civil wars, often provoked by incompetence and mismanagement in government and Henry's perceived over-reliance on French courtiers (thus restricting the influence of the English nobility). One of these rebellions\u2014led by a disaffected courtier, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]\u2014was notable for its assembly of one of the earliest precursors to [[British Parliament|Parliament]]. In addition to fighting the [[Second Barons' War]], Henry III made war against Saint Louis and was defeated during the [[Saintonge War]], yet Louis IX did not capitalise on his victory, respecting his opponent's rights.\n\nHenry III's policies towards Jews began with relative tolerance, but became gradually more restrictive. In 1253 the [[Statute of Jewry]], reinforced physical segregation and demanded a previously notional requirement to wear square white badges.<ref>{{harvnb|Hillaby|2013|p=104}}</ref> Henry III also backed an accusation of child murder in Lincoln, ordering a Jew Copin to be executed and 91 Jews to be arrested for trial; 18 were killed. Popular superstitious fears were fuelled, and Catholic theological hostility combined with Baronial abuse of loan arrangements, resulting in [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]'s supporters targeting of Jewish communities in their [[Second Barons' War|revolt]]. This hostility, violence and controversy was the background to the increasingly oppressive measures that followed under Edward I.<ref>{{harvnb|Hillaby|2013|pp=104-107}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Jacobs|1903}}</ref>\n\n==14th century==\nThe reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (reigned 1272\u20131307) was rather more successful. Edward enacted numerous laws strengthening the powers of his government, and he summoned the first officially sanctioned [[Parliaments of England]] (such as his [[Model Parliament]]). He [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|conquered Wales]] and attempted to use a succession dispute to gain control of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], though this developed into a costly and drawn-out military campaign. \n\nEdward I is also known for his policies first persecuting Jews, particularly the 1275 [[Statute of the Jewry]]. This banned Jews from their previous role in making loans, and demanded that they work as merchants, farmers, craftsmen or soldiers. This was unrealistic, and failed.<ref>{{harvnb|Huscroft|2006|pp=112-139}}</ref> Edward's solution was to [[History of the Jews in England (1066\u20131290)#Edward I and the Expulsion|expel Jews from England]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hillaby|2013|pp=104-107}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Jacobs|1903}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Huscroft|2006|pp=140-160}}</ref>\n\nHis son, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], proved a disaster. A weak man who preferred to engage in activities like thatching and ditch-digging{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} rather than jousting, hunting, or the usual entertainments of kings, he spent most of his reign trying in vain to control the nobility, who in return showed continual hostility to him. Meanwhile, the Scottish leader [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]] began retaking all the territory conquered by Edward I. In 1314, the English army was disastrously defeated by the Scots at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]]. Edward also showered favours on his companion [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]], a knight of humble birth. While it has been widely believed that Edward was a homosexual because of his closeness to Gaveston, there is no concrete evidence of this. The king's enemies, including his cousin [[Thomas of Lancaster]], captured and murdered Gaveston in 1312.\n\nEdward's downfall came in 1326 when his wife, [[Isabella of France|Queen Isabella]], travelled to her native France and, with her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], [[Edward II of England#Invasion by Isabella and Mortimer|invaded England]]. Despite their tiny force, they quickly rallied support for their cause. The king fled London, and his companion since Piers Gaveston's death, [[Hugh Despenser the younger|Hugh Despenser]], was publicly tried and executed. Edward was captured, charged with breaking his coronation oath, [[Edward II of England#Abdication|deposed]] and imprisoned in Gloucestershire until he was murdered some time in the autumn of 1327, presumably by agents of Isabella and Mortimer.\n\nMillions of people in northern Europe died in the [[Great Famine of 1315\u20131317]].<ref>\"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R688at3KskQC&pg=PA49&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Story of Ireland]''\".

Alan Macfarlane (1997). p.66. {{ISBN|0-631-18117-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Edward III of England|Edward III]], son of Edward II, was crowned at age 14 after his father was [[deposition (politics)|deposed]] by his mother and her [[Prince consort|consort]] [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]]. At age 17, he led a successful coup against Mortimer, the ''de facto'' ruler of the country, and began his personal reign. [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] reigned 1327\u20131377, restored royal authority and went on to transform England into the most efficient military power in Europe. His reign saw vital developments in legislature and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the English parliament\u2014as well as the ravages of the [[Black Death]]. After defeating, but not subjugating, the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1338, but his claim was denied due to the [[Salic law]]. This started what would become known as the [[Hundred Years' War]].<ref>Edward first styled himself \"King of France\" in 1337, though he did not officially assume the title until 1340; Prestwich (2005), pp. 307\u20138.</ref> Following some initial setbacks, the war went exceptionally well for England; victories at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] and [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] led to the highly favourable [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]]. Edward's later years were marked by international failure and domestic strife, largely as a result of his inactivity and poor health.\n\nFor many years, trouble had been brewing with [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]\u2014a Spanish kingdom whose navy had taken to raiding English merchant ships in the [[English Channel|Channel]]. Edward won a [[Battle of Winchelsea|major naval victory]] against a Castilian fleet off [[Winchelsea]] in 1350. Although the Castilian crossbowmen killed many of the enemy,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grant |first1=R. G. |title=1001 Battles That Changed the Course of History |date=2017 |page=195}}</ref> the English gradually got the better of the encounter. In spite of Edward's success, however, Winchelsea was only a flash in a conflict that raged between the English and the Spanish for over 200 years,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lavery |first1=Brian |title=The Conquest of the Ocean |date=2013 |page=61}}</ref> coming to a head with the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.\n\nIn 1373, England signed an [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|alliance with the Kingdom of Portugal]], which is claimed to be the oldest alliance in the world still in force.\n\nIn 1381, a [[Peasants' Revolt]] led by [[Wat Tyler]] spread across large parts of England. It was suppressed by [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], with the death of 1500 rebels.\n\n===Black Death===\n\n{{main|Black Death in England}}\n[[The Black Death]], an epidemic of [[bubonic plague]] that spread all over Europe, arrived in England in 1348 and killed as much as a third to half the population. Military conflicts during this period were usually with domestic neighbours such as the Welsh, Irish and Scots, and included the [[Hundred Years' War]] against the French and their [[Scottish people|Scottish]] allies. Notable English victories in the [[Hundred Years' War]] included [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]]. The final defeat of the uprising led by the Welsh prince, [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], in 1412 by Prince Henry (who later became [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]) represents the last major armed attempt by the Welsh to throw off English rule.\n\n[[Edward III of England|Edward III]] gave land to powerful noble families, including many people of royal lineage. Because land was equivalent to power, these powerful men could try to claim the crown. The autocratic and arrogant methods of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] only served to alienate the nobility more, and his forceful dispossession in 1399 by [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] increased the turmoil.\n\nHenry spent much of his reign defending himself against plots, rebellions and assassination attempts.\n{{House of Lancaster|henry4}}\nRebellions continued throughout the first ten years of Henry's reign, including the revolt of [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]], who declared himself [[Prince of Wales]] in 1400, and the rebellion of [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]]. The king's success in putting down these rebellions was due partly to the military ability of his eldest son, [[Henry V of England|Henry of Monmouth]], who later became king (though the son managed to seize much effective power from his father in 1410).\n\n==15th century &ndash; Henry V and the Wars of the Roses==\n{{further|Lancastrian War|Wars of the Roses}}\n\n[[Henry V of England|Henry V]] succeeded to the throne in 1413. He renewed hostilities with France and began a set of military campaigns which are considered a new phase of the [[Hundred Years' War]], referred to as the [[Lancastrian War]]. He won several notable victories over the French, including at the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. In the [[Treaty of Troyes]], Henry V was given the power to succeed the current ruler of France, [[Charles VI of France]]. The Treaty also provided that he would marry Charles VI's daughter, [[Catherine of Valois]]. They married in 1421. Henry died of dysentery in 1422, leaving a number of unfulfilled plans, including his plan to take over as King of France and to lead a crusade to retake Jerusalem from the Muslims.\n\nHenry V's son, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], became king in 1422 as an infant. His reign was marked by constant turmoil due to his political weaknesses. While he was growing up, England was ruled by the [[Regency government, 1422\u20131437|Regency government]].\n\nThe Regency Council tried to install Henry VI as the King of France, as provided by the Treaty of Troyes signed by his father, and led English forces to take over areas of France. It appeared they might succeed due to the poor political position of the son of Charles VI, who had claimed to be the rightful king as [[Charles VII of France]]. However, in 1429, [[Joan of Arc]] began a military effort to prevent the English from gaining control of France. The French forces regained control of French territory.\n\nIn 1437, Henry VI came of age and began to actively rule as king. To forge peace, he married French noblewoman [[Margaret of Anjou]] in 1445, as provided in the [[Treaty of Tours]]. Hostilities with France resumed in 1449. When England lost the [[Hundred Years' War]] in August 1453, Henry fell into mental breakdown until Christmas 1454. \n\nHe could not control the feuding nobles, and civil war began called [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455\u20131485). Although fighting was very sporadic and small, there was a general breakdown in the power of the Crown. The royal court and Parliament moved to Coventry, in the Lancastrian heartlands, which thus became the capital of England until 1461. Henry's cousin deposed Henry in 1461 to became [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]]. He defeated the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrians]] at the [[Battle of Mortimer's Cross]]. He was briefly expelled from the throne in 1470\u20131471 when [[Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]], brought Henry back to power. Six months later, Edward defeated and killed Warwick in battle and reclaimed the throne. Henry was imprisoned in the Tower of London and died there. Edward went a little way to restoring the power of the Crown.\n\nEdward died in 1483, only 40 years old. His eldest son and heir [[Edward V]], aged 13, could not succeed him because the king's brother [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]] declared his marriage bigamous, making all his children illegitimate. Richard declared himself king. Edward V and his 10-year-old brother Richard were imprisoned in the Tower of London and were not seen again. It was widely believed that Richard had them murdered and he was reviled as a treacherous fiend, which limited his ability to govern during his brief reign. In summer 1485, [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], the last Lancastrian male, landed in England from exile in France. He defeated and killed Richard at [[Bosworth Field]] on 22 August and became king Henry VII.\n\n{{See also|Black Death in England|English historians in the Middle Ages|List of English chronicles|Bayeux Tapestry}}\n\n==Tudor England==\n{{main|Tudor period}}\n{{further|Early Modern Britain|English Renaissance}}\n\n===Henry VII===\nWith [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]'s accession to the throne in 1485, the Wars of the Roses came to an end, and Tudors would continue to rule England for 118 years. Traditionally, the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] is considered to mark the end of the Middle Ages in England, although Henry did not introduce any new concept of monarchy, and for most of his reign his hold on power was tenuous. He claimed the throne by conquest and God's judgement in battle. Parliament quickly recognized him as king, but the Yorkists were far from defeated. Nonetheless, he married Edward IV's eldest daughter Elizabeth in January 1486, thereby uniting the houses of York and Lancaster.\n\nMost of the European rulers did not believe Henry would survive long, and were thus willing to shelter claimants against him. The first plot against him was the [[Stafford and Lovell Rebellion]] of 1486, which presented no serious threat. But Richard III's nephew [[John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln]], hatched another attempt the following year. Using a peasant boy named [[Lambert Simnel]], who posed as [[Edward, Earl of Warwick]] (the real Warwick was locked up in the Tower of London), he led an army of 2,000 German mercenaries paid for by [[Margaret of York|Margaret of Burgundy]] into England. They were defeated and de la Pole was killed at the difficult [[Battle of Stoke]], where the loyalty of some of the royal troops to Henry was questionable. The king, realizing that Simnel was a dupe, employed him in the royal kitchen.\n\nA more serious threat was [[Perkin Warbeck]], a Flemish youth who posed as Edward IV's son Richard. Again with support from Margaret of Burgundy, he invaded England four times from 1495\u20131497 before he was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Both Warbeck and the Earl of Warwick were dangerous even in captivity, and Henry executed them in 1499 before Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain would allow their daughter Catherine to come to England and marry his son Arthur.\n\nIn 1497, Henry defeated Cornish rebels marching on London. The rest of his reign was relatively peaceful, despite worries about succession after the death of his wife [[Elizabeth of York]] in 1503.\n\nHenry VII's foreign policy was peaceful. He had made an alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], but in 1493, when they went to war with France, England was dragged into the conflict. Impoverished and his hold on power insecure, Henry had no desire for war. He quickly reached an understanding with the French and renounced all claims to their territory except the port of Calais, realizing also that he could not stop them from incorporating the Duchy of Brittany. In return, the French agreed to recognize him as king and stop sheltering pretenders. Shortly afterwards, they became preoccupied with adventures in Italy. Henry also reached an understanding with Scotland, agreeing to marry his daughter Margaret to that country's king [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]].\n\nUpon becoming king, Henry inherited a government severely weakened and degraded by the Wars of the Roses. The treasury was empty, having been drained by Edward IV's Woodville in-laws after his death. Through a tight fiscal policy and sometimes ruthless tax collection and confiscations, Henry refilled the treasury by the time of his death. He also effectively rebuilt the machinery of government.\n\nIn 1501, the king's son [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], having married [[Catherine of Aragon]], died of illness at age 15, leaving his younger brother [[Henry, Duke of York]] as heir. When the king himself died in 1509, the position of the Tudors was secure at last, and his son succeeded him unopposed.\n\n===Henry VIII===\n\n[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger, Around 1497-1543 - Portrait of Henry VIII of England - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]]]\n\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] began his reign with much optimism. The handsome, athletic young king stood in sharp contrast to his wary, miserly father. Henry's lavish court quickly drained the treasury of the fortune he inherited. He married the widowed [[Catherine of Aragon]], and they had several children, but none survived infancy except a daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary]].\n\nIn 1512, the young king started a [[War of the League of Cambrai|war in France]]. Although England was an ally of Spain, one of France's principal enemies, the war was mostly about Henry's desire for personal glory, despite his sister [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]] being married to the French king [[Louis XII]]. The war accomplished little. The English army suffered badly from disease, and Henry was not even present at the one notable victory, the [[Battle of the Spurs]]. Meanwhile, [[James IV of Scotland]] (despite being Henry's other brother-in-law), activated his alliance with the French and declared war on England. While Henry was dallying in France, Catherine, who was serving as regent in his absence, and his advisers were left to deal with this threat. At the [[Battle of Flodden]] on 9 September 1513, the Scots were completely defeated. James and most of the Scottish nobles were killed. When Henry returned from France, he was given credit for the victory.\n\nEventually, Catherine was no longer able to have any more children. The king became increasingly nervous about the possibility of his daughter Mary inheriting the throne, as England's one experience with a female sovereign, Matilda in the 12th century, had been a catastrophe. He eventually decided that it was necessary to divorce Catherine and find a new queen. To persuade the Church to allow this, Henry cited the passage in the [[Book of Leviticus]]: \"If a man taketh his brother's wife, he hath committed adultery; they shall be childless\". However, Catherine insisted that she and Arthur never consummated their brief marriage and that the prohibition did not apply here. The timing of Henry's case was very unfortunate; it was 1527 and the Pope had been imprisoned by emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Catherine's nephew and the most powerful man in Europe, for siding with his archenemy [[Francis I of France]]. Because he could not divorce in these circumstances, Henry seceded from the Church, in what became known as the [[English Reformation]].\n\nThe newly established [[Church of England]] amounted to little more than the existing Catholic Church, but led by the king rather than the Pope. It took a number of years for the separation from Rome to be completed, and many were executed for resisting the king's religious policies.\n\nIn 1530, Catherine was banished from court and spent the rest of her life (until her death in 1536) alone in an isolated manor home, barred from contact with Mary. Secret correspondence continued thanks to her ladies-in-waiting. Their marriage was declared invalid, making Mary an illegitimate child. Henry married [[Anne Boleyn]] secretly in January 1533, just as his divorce from Catherine was finalised. They had a second, public wedding. Anne soon became pregnant and may have already been when they wed. But on 7 September 1533, she gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth. The king was devastated at his failure to obtain a son after all the effort it had taken to remarry. Gradually, he came to develop a disliking of his new queen for her strange behaviour. In 1536, when Anne was pregnant again, Henry was badly injured in a jousting accident. Shaken by this, the queen gave birth prematurely to a stillborn boy. By now, the king was convinced that his marriage was hexed, and having already found a new queen, Jane Seymour, he put Anne in the Tower of London on charges of witchcraft. Afterwards, she was beheaded along with five men (her brother included) accused of adultery with her. The marriage was then declared invalid, so that Elizabeth, just like her half sister, became a bastard.\n\nHenry immediately married [[Jane Seymour]], who became pregnant almost as quickly. On 12 October 1537, she gave birth to a healthy boy, Edward, which was greeted with huge celebrations. However, the queen died of [[puerperal sepsis]] ten days later. Henry genuinely mourned her death, and at his own passing nine years later, he was buried next to her.\n\nThe king married a fourth time in 1540, to the German [[Anne of Cleves]] for a political alliance with her Protestant brother, the [[Duke of Cleves]]. He also hoped to obtain another son in case something should happen to Edward. Anne proved a dull, unattractive woman and Henry did not consummate the marriage. He quickly divorced her, and she remained in England as a kind of adopted sister to him. He married again, to a 19-year-old named [[Catherine Howard]]. But when it became known that she was neither a virgin at the wedding, nor a faithful wife afterwards, she ended up on the scaffold and the marriage declared invalid. His sixth and last marriage was to [[Catherine Parr]], who was more his nursemaid than anything else, as his health was failing since his jousting accident in 1536.\n\nIn 1542, the king started a new campaign in France, but unlike in 1512, he only managed with great difficulty. He only conquered the city of Boulogne, which France retook in 1549. Scotland also declared war and at [[Battle of Solway Moss|Solway Moss]] was again totally defeated.\n\nHenry's paranoia and suspicion worsened in his last years. The number of executions during his 38-year reign numbered tens of thousands. He died in January 1547 at age 55 and was succeeded by his son, Edward VI.\n\n===Edward VI and Mary I===\nAlthough he showed piety and intelligence, [[Edward VI]] was only nine years old when he became king in 1547. His uncle, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] tampered with [[Will of Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII's will]] and obtained [[letters patent]] giving him much of the power of a monarch by March 1547. He took the title of Protector. While some see him as a high-minded idealist, his stay in power culminated in a crisis in 1549 when many counties of the realm were up in protest. [[Kett's Rebellion]] in Norfolk and the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] simultaneously created a crisis while invasion from Scotland and France were feared. Somerset, disliked by the Regency Council for being autocratic, was removed from power by [[John Dudley, Earl of Warwick|John Dudley]], who is known as [[Lord President Northumberland]]. Northumberland proceeded to adopt the power for himself, but he was more conciliatory and the Council accepted him. During Edward's reign England changed from being a Catholic nation to a Protestant one, in schism from Rome.\n\nEdward showed great promise but fell violently ill of [[tuberculosis]] in 1553 and died that August, two months before his 16th birthday.\n\nNorthumberland made plans to place [[Lady Jane Grey]] on the throne and marry her to his son, so that he could remain the power behind the throne. His plot failed in a matter of days, Jane Grey was beheaded, and [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] (1516\u20131558) took the throne amidst popular demonstration in her favour in London, which contemporaries described as the largest show of affection for a Tudor monarch. Mary had never been expected to hold the throne, at least not since Edward was born. She was a devoted Catholic who believed that she could reverse the Reformation.<ref>Ann Weikel, \"Mary I (1516\u20131558)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', online edition, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18245, accessed 25 Aug 2011]</ref>\n\nReturning England to Catholicism led to the burnings of 274 Protestants, which are recorded especially in [[John Foxe]]'s [[Book of Martyrs|''Book of Martyrs'']]. Mary then married her cousin [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], son of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], and King of Spain when Charles abdicated in 1556. The union was difficult because Mary was already in her late 30s and Philip was a Catholic and a foreigner, and so not very welcome in England. This wedding also provoked hostility from France, already at war with Spain and now fearing being encircled by the Habsburgs. Calais, the last English outpost on the Continent, was then taken by France. King Philip (1527\u20131598) had very little power, although he did protect Elizabeth. He was not popular in England, and spent little time there.<ref>Glyn Redworth, \"Philip (1527\u20131598)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', online edition, May 2011 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22097, accessed 25 Aug 2011]</ref> Mary eventually became pregnant, or at least believed herself to be. In reality, she may have had [[uterine cancer]]. Her death in November 1558 was greeted with huge celebrations in the streets of London.\n\n===Elizabeth I===\n{{main|Elizabethan era}}\nAfter Mary I died in 1558, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] came to the throne. Her reign restored a sort of order to the realm after the turbulent reigns of Edward VI and Mary I. The religious issue which had divided the country since Henry VIII was in a way put to rest by the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], which re-established the [[Church of England]]. Much of Elizabeth's success was in balancing the interests of the [[Puritan]]s and Catholics. She managed to offend neither to a large extent, although she clamped down on Catholics towards the end of her reign as war with Catholic Spain loomed.<ref>J. B. Black ''The Reign of Elizabeth, 1558\u20131603'' (Oxford History of England) (2nd ed. 1959) [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=3769587 online edition]</ref><ref>J. A. Guy, ''Tudor England'' (1990) [https://www.amazon.com/Tudor-England-John-Guy/dp/0192852132/ excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\nDespite the need for an heir, Elizabeth declined to marry, despite offers from a number of suitors across Europe, including the Swedish king [[Erik XIV]]. This created endless worries over her succession, especially in the 1560s when she nearly died of smallpox. It has been often rumoured that she had a number of lovers (including [[Francis Drake]]), but there is no hard evidence.\n\n[[File:Elizabeth I (Armada Portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]]]\n\nElizabeth maintained relative government stability. Apart from the [[Revolt of the Northern Earls]] in 1569, she was effective in reducing the power of the old nobility and expanding the power of her government. Elizabeth's government did much to consolidate the work begun under [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] in the reign of Henry VIII, that is, expanding the role of the government and effecting common law and administration throughout England. During the reign of Elizabeth and shortly afterwards, the population grew significantly: from three million in 1564 to nearly five million in 1616.<ref>[http://www.enotes.com/shakespeare-atoz/population ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523191332/http://www.enotes.com/shakespeare-atoz/population |date=23 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe queen ran afoul of her cousin [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], who was a devoted Catholic and so was forced to abdicate her throne (Scotland had [[Scottish Reformation|recently become Protestant]]). She fled to England, where Elizabeth immediately had her arrested. Mary spent the next 19 years in confinement, but proved too dangerous to keep alive, as the Catholic powers in Europe considered her the legitimate ruler of England. She was eventually tried for treason, sentenced to death, and beheaded in February 1587.\n\n====Elizabethan era====\nThe Elizabethan era was the epoch in English history of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]'s reign (1558\u20131603). Historians often depict it as the [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] in English history. The symbol of [[Britannia]] was first used in 1572 and often thereafter to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals, international expansion, and naval triumph over the hated Spanish foe. In terms of the entire century, [[John Guy (historian)|the historian John Guy]] (1988) argues that \"England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudors]]\" than at any time in a thousand years.<ref>John Guy (1988) ''Tudor England'', Oxford University Press, p. 32 {{ISBN|0192852132}}</ref>\n\nThis \"golden age\"<ref>From the 1944 Clark lectures by [[C. S. Lewis]]; Lewis, ''English Literature in the Sixteenth Century'' (Oxford, 1954) p. 1, {{OCLC|256072}}</ref> represented the apogee of the [[English Renaissance]] and saw the flowering of poetry, music and literature. The era is most famous for [[Elizabethan theatre|theatre]], as [[William Shakespeare]] and many others composed plays that broke free of England's past style of theatre. It was an age of exploration and expansion abroad, while back at home, the [[Protestant Reformation]] became more acceptable to the people, most certainly after the [[Spanish Armada]] was repulsed. It was also the end of the period when England was a separate realm before its royal union with Scotland.\n\nThe Elizabethan Age is viewed so highly largely because of the periods before and after. It was a brief period of largely internal peace after the battles between Catholics and Protestants during the [[English Reformation]] and before battles between [[Parliament of England|parliament]] and the monarchy of the 17th century. The Protestant/Catholic divide was settled, for a time, by the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], and parliament was not yet strong enough to challenge royal absolutism.\n\nEngland was also well-off compared to the other nations of Europe. [[Italian Renaissance]] had ended due to foreign domination of the peninsula. France was embroiled in religious battles until the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1598. Also, the English had been expelled from their last outposts on the continent. Due to these reasons, the centuries long conflict with France was largely suspended for most of Elizabeth's reign.\n\nEngland's great rival was Spain, both in Europe and the [[Americas]]. Skirmishes exploded into the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War]] of 1585\u20131604. [[Philip II of Spain]] tried to invade England with the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 but was famously defeated. England made an unsuccessful attack on Portugal and the Azores, the [[English Armada|Drake-Norris Expedition of 1589]]. Then Spain provided some support for Irish Catholics in a debilitating [[guerrilla warfare|rebellion]] against English rule, and Spanish naval and land forces made a series of reversals of English offensives. This drained English Exchequer and economy that had been carefully restored under Elizabeth's guidance. English commercial and territorial expansion was limited until the [[Treaty of London, 1604|Treaty of London of 1604]] the year after Elizabeth's death. During the brief height of the Anglo-Spanish war, almost 45,000 were killed, of which one-third were Spanish, the rest English.<ref>{{cite book |title=The English Armada: The Greatest Naval Disaster in English History |date=2018 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |page=298}}</ref>\n\nEngland during this period had a centralised, organised and effective government, largely due to the reforms of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Economically, the country began to benefit greatly from the new era of [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic]] trade.\n[[File:Britannia-Statue.jpg|thumb|The National Armada memorial in [[Plymouth]] using the Britannia image to celebrate the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 (William Charles May, sculptor, 1888)]]\n\n====Foreign affairs====\nIn foreign policy, Elizabeth played against each other the major powers France and Spain, as well as the papacy and Scotland. These were all Catholic and each wanted to end Protestantism in England. Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs and only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands, France and Ireland. She risked war with Spain by supporting the \"[[Sea Dogs]]\", such as [[Walter Raleigh]], [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] and Sir [[Francis Drake]], who preyed on Spanish merchant ships carrying gold and silver from the New World. The [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|major war came with Spain, 1585\u20131603]]. When Spain tried to invade and conquer England, the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 associated Elizabeth's name with what is popularly viewed as one of the greatest victories in English history. Her enemies failed to combine and Elizabeth's foreign policy successfully navigated all the dangers.<ref>Charles Beem, ''The Foreign Relations of Elizabeth I'' (2011) [https://www.amazon.com/Foreign-Relations-Elizabeth-Queenship-Power/dp/0230112145/ excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\n===End of Tudor era===\nIn all, the [[Tudor period]] is seen as a decisive one which set up many important questions which would have to be answered in the next century and during the [[English Civil War]]. These were questions of the relative power of the monarch and Parliament and to what extent one should control the other. Some historians think that Thomas Cromwell affected a \"Tudor Revolution\" in government, and it is certain that Parliament became more important during his chancellorship. Other historians argue that the \"Tudor Revolution\" extended to the end of Elizabeth's reign, when the work was all consolidated. Although the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] declined after Elizabeth's death, it was very effective while she was alive.\n\nElizabeth died in 1603 at the age of 69.\n\n==17th century==\n{{main|17th century England}}\n\n=== Union of the Crowns ===\nWhen Elizabeth died, her closest male Protestant relative was the [[King of Scots]], [[King James VI of Scotland|James VI]], of the [[House of Stuart]], who became [[James I of England|King James I of England]] in a [[Union of the Crowns]], called James I & VI. He was the first monarch to rule the entire island of Britain, but the countries remained separate politically. Upon taking power, James made peace with Spain, and for the first half of the 17th century, England remained largely inactive in European politics. Several assassination attempts were made on James, notably the [[Main Plot]] and [[Bye Plot]]s of 1603, and most famously, on 5 November 1605, the [[Gunpowder Plot]], by a group of Catholic conspirators, led by [[Robert Catesby]], which caused more antipathy in England towards Catholicism.\n\n===Colonial England===\n[[File:Captain John Smith landing in Jamestown.jpeg|thumb|Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] landing in Jamestown, Virginia, 1607]]\nIn 1607 England built an [[Jamestown, Virginia|establishment at Jamestown]]. This was the beginning of colonialism by England in North America. Many English settled then in North America for religious or economic reasons. Approximately 70% of English immigrants to North America who came between 1630\u20131660 were [[indentured servant]]s. By 1700, [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] planters transported about 100,000 indentured servants,<ref>\"[https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-02-03.htm Africans, Slavery, and Race]\".

The defeat of the Royalist army by the [[New Model Army]] of Parliament at the [[Battle of Naseby]] in June 1645 effectively destroyed the king's forces. Charles surrendered to the Scottish army at Newark. He was eventually handed over to the English Parliament in early 1647. He escaped, and the [[Second English Civil War]] began, but the New Model Army quickly secured the country. The capture and trial of Charles led to his beheading in January 1649 at [[Whitehall]] Gate in London, making England a [[republic]]. This shocked the rest of Europe. The king argued to the end that only God could judge him. The trial and execution were a precursor of sorts to the beheading of [[Louis XVI]] 145 years later.\n\nThe New Model Army, command by [[Oliver Cromwell]], then scored decisive victories against Royalist armies in Ireland and Scotland. Cromwell was given the title [[Lord Protector]] in 1653, making him 'king in all but name' to his critics. After he died in 1658, his son [[Richard Cromwell]] succeeded him in the office but he was forced to abdicate within a year. For a while it seemed as if a new civil war would begin as the New Model Army split into factions. Troops stationed in Scotland under the command of [[George Monck]] eventually marched on London to restore order.\n\n===Restoration of the monarchy===\nThe monarchy was restored in 1660, with King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] returning to London. However, the power of the crown was less than before the Civil War. By the 18th century England rivaled the Netherlands as one of the freest countries in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn 1665, London was swept by the [[Great Plague of London|plague]], and in 1666 by the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] for 5 days which destroyed about 15,000 buildings.\n\n===Glorious Revolution===\nIn 1680, the [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusion crisis]] consisted of attempts to prevent accession of James, heir to Charles II, because he was Catholic. After Charles II died in 1685 and his [[James II of England|James II & VII]] was crowned, various factions pressed for his Protestant daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and her husband [[William III of England|Prince William III of Orange]] to replace him in what became known as the [[Glorious Revolution]].\n\nIn November 1688, William [[William III of England#Invasion of England|invaded England]] and succeeded in being crowned. James tried to retake the throne in the [[Williamite War]], but was defeated at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690.\n\nIn December 1689, one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]], was passed.<ref name=vdk114>Van der Kiste, 114\u2013115</ref> The Bill, which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier [[Declaration of Right, 1689|Declaration of Right]], established restrictions on the [[royal prerogative]]. For example, the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive [[bail]] or inflict cruel and unusual punishments.<ref name=\"davies\">[[Norman Davies|Davies, Norman]], ''The Isles: A History'' (1999) {{ISBN|0-19-513442-7}}, p.614.</ref> William was opposed to such constraints, but chose not conflict with Parliament and agreed to the statute.<ref>Troost, 212\u2013214</ref>\n\nIn parts of Scotland and Ireland, Catholics loyal to James remained determined to see him restored to the throne, and staged a series of bloody uprisings. As a result, any failure to pledge loyalty to the victorious King William was severely dealt with. The most infamous example of this policy was the [[Massacre of Glencoe]] in 1692. [[Jacobite rebellions]] continued into the mid-18th century until the son of the last Catholic claimant to the throne, [[Old Pretender|James III & VIII]], mounted a [[Jacobite rising of 1745|final campaign in 1745]]. The Jacobite forces of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Prince Charles Edward Stuart]], the \"Bonnie Prince Charlie\" of legend, were defeated at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746.\n\n==Formation of the United Kingdom==\nThe [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] between the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] were a pair of [[Act of Parliament|Parliamentary Acts]] passed by both parliaments in 1707, which dissolved them in order to form a [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] governed by a unified [[Parliament of Great Britain]] according to the [[Treaty of Union]]. The Acts joined the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (previously separate [[sovereign state|state]]s, with separate legislatures but [[Personal union|with the same monarch]]) into a single [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/ Welcome] parliament.uk. Retrieved 7 October 2008.</ref>\n\nThe two countries had shared a monarch since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, when [[King James VI of Scotland]] inherited the English throne from his double first cousin twice removed, [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth I]]. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head. There had been three attempts in 1606, 1667, and 1689 to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that the idea had the will of both political establishments behind them, albeit for rather different reasons.\n\nThe Acts took effect on 1 May 1707. On this date, the Scots Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], based in the [[Palace of Westminster]] in London, the home of the English Parliament.<ref>[[s:Act of Union 1707|Act of Union 1707]], Article 3</ref> Hence, the Acts are referred to as the '''Union of the Parliaments'''. On the Union, historian [[Simon Schama]] said \"What began as a hostile merger, would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history.\"<ref>{{cite episode |title=Britannia Incorporated|series= A History of Britain |serieslink= Simon Schama's A History of Britain |credits= [[Simon Schama]] (presenter) |network= [[BBC One]] |airdate= 22 May 2001 |number=10 |minutes=3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1714 ended the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], the last monarch of the [[House of Stuart]].

The English capital of London was adopted as the capital of the Union.\n\n==Modern England, 18th\u201319th centuries==\n{{Main|History of the United Kingdom}}\n\n{{further|Social history of England|History of local government in England#The evolution of modern local government (1832\u20131974)}}\n\nFollowing the formation of the United Kingdom, the history of England is no longer the history of a sovereign nation, but rather the history of one of the [[countries of the United Kingdom]].\n\n===Industrial Revolution===\n{{main|Economic history of Britain}}\nIn the late 18th century and early 19th centuries, technological advances and mechanization resulted in the [[Industrial Revolution]] which transformed a largely agrarian society and caused considerable social upheaval. Economies of scale and increased output per worker allowed steam-based factories to undercut production of traditional cottage industries. Much of the agricultural workforce was uprooted from the countryside and moved into large urban centres of production. The consequent overcrowding into areas with little supporting infrastructure saw dramatic increases in mortality, crime, and social deprivation. (Many Sunday schools for pre-working age children (5 or 6) had funeral clubs to pay for each other's funeral arrangements.) The process of industrialization threatened many livelihoods, which prompted some to sabotage factories. These saboteurs were known as \"[[Luddism|Luddites]]\".\n\n===Local governance===\n{{further|History of local government in England}}\n[[File:Microcosm of London Plate 009 - Billingsgate Market (tone).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Billingsgate Fish Market]] in the early 19th century]]\n[[File:Louise Rayner Chester Eastgate Street.jpg|thumb|[[Chester]], c. 1880]]\nThe [[Local Government Act of 1888]] was the first systematic attempt to impose a standardised system of local government in England. The system was based on the existing counties (today known as the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]], since the major boundary changes of 1974). Later, the [[Local Government Act 1894]] created a second tier of local government. All administrative counties and county boroughs were divided into either rural or urban districts, allowing more localised administration.\n\nDuring the 1800s, the need for local administration greatly increased, prompting piecemeal adjustments. The sanitary districts and parish councils had legal status, but were not part of the mechanism of government. They were run by volunteers; often no-one could be held responsible for the failure to undertake the required duties. Furthermore, the increased \"county business\" could not be handled by the [[Quarter Sessions]], nor was this appropriate. Finally, there was a desire to see local administration performed by elected officials, as in the reformed municipal boroughs. By 1888, these shortcomings were clear, and the [[Local Government Act 1888|Local Government Act]] was the first systematic attempt to create a standardised system of local government in England.\n\nThe system was based on the existing counties (now known as the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]], since the major boundary changes of 1974). The counties themselves had had some boundary changes in the preceding 50 years, mainly to remove [[Historic counties of England#Detached parts|enclaves and exclaves]]. The act called for the creation of statutory counties, based on the ancient/historic counties, but completely corrected for enclaves and exclaves, and adjusted so that each settlement was completely within one county. These statutory counties were to be used for non-administrative functions: ''\"[[high sheriff|sheriff]], [[lord lieutenant|lieutenant]], [[custos rotulorum]], justices, militia, coroner, or other\"''. With the advent of elected councils, the offices of lord lieutenant and sheriff became largely ceremonial.\n\nThe statutory counties formed the basis for the so-called 'administrative counties'. However, it was felt that large cities and primarily rural areas in the same county could not be well administered by the same body. Thus 59 \"counties in themselves\", or 'county boroughs', were created to administer the urban centres of England. These were part of the statutory counties, but not part of the administrative counties.\n\n[[Local Government Act 1894|In 1894, the Local Government Act]] created a second tier of local government. Henceforth, all administrative counties and county boroughs would be divided into either rural or urban districts, allowing more localised administration. The municipal boroughs reformed after 1835 were brought into this system as special cases of urban districts. The urban and rural districts were based on, and incorporated the [[sanitary district]]s which created in 1875 (with adjustments, so that districts did not overlap two counties).\n\nThe Act also provided for the establishment of [[civil parishes]]. The 1894 Act formed an official system of civil parishes, separated from the ecclesiastical parishes, to carry on some of these responsibilities (others being transferred to the district/county councils). However, the civil parishes were not a complete third-tier of local government. Instead, they were 'community councils' for smaller, rural settlements, which did not have a local government district to themselves. Where urban parish councils had previously existed, they were absorbed into the new urban districts.\n\n==20th and 21st centuries==\n\n{{Main|Social history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)|Political history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)}}\n\nA prolonged agricultural depression in Britain at the end of the 19th century, together with the introduction in the 20th century of increasingly heavy levels of taxation on inherited wealth, put an end to agricultural land as the primary source of wealth for the upper classes. Many estates were sold or broken up, and this trend was accelerated by the introduction of protection for agricultural tenancies, encouraging outright sales, from the mid-20th century.\n\n=== General history and political issues ===\n[[File:Ve Day Celebrations in London, England, UK, 8 May 1945 D24586.jpg|thumb|[[Victory in Europe Day]] celebrations in London, 8 May 1945]]\nFollowing years of political and military agitation for 'Home Rule' for Ireland, the Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921 established the [[Irish Free State]] (now the [[Republic of Ireland]]) as a separate state, leaving [[Northern Ireland]] as part of the United Kingdom. The official name of the UK thus became \"The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]\".\n\nEngland, as part of the UK, joined the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973, which became the [[European Union]] in 1993.\n\nThere is a movement in England to create a [[devolved English Parliament]]. This would give England a local Parliament like those already functioning for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. This issue is referred to as the [[West Lothian question]].\n\n===Political history and local government===\n{{details|History of local government in England}}\n\nA [[Local Government Commission for England (1958\u20131967)|Local Government Commission]] was wound up in 1966, and replaced with a Royal Commission (known as the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report|Redcliffe-Maud commission]]). In 1969 it recommended a system of single-tier [[unitary authorities]] for the whole of England, apart from three metropolitan areas of [[Merseyside]], [[Greater Manchester|Selnec]] (Greater Manchester) and [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] ([[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]]), which were to have both a metropolitan council and district councils. This report was accepted by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government of the time despite considerable opposition, but the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|June 1970 general election]], and on a manifesto that committed them to a two-tier structure.\n\nThe reforms arising from the [[Local Government Act 1972|Local Government Act of 1972]] resulted in the most uniform and simplified system of local government which has been used in England. They effectively wiped away everything that had gone before, and built an administrative system from scratch. All previous administrative districts \u2013 statutory counties, administrative counties, county boroughs, municipal boroughs, counties corporate, civil parishes \u2013 were abolished.\n\nThe aim of the act was to establish a uniform two tier system across the country. Onto the blank canvas, new counties were created to cover the entire country; many of these were obviously based on the [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]], but there were some major changes, especially in the north.\n\nThis uniform two-tier system lasted only 12 years. In 1986, the metropolitan county councils and Greater London were abolished. This restored autonomy (in effect the old county borough status) to the metropolitan and London boroughs. The Local Government Act (1992) established a commission ([[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|Local Government Commission for England]]) to examine the issues, and make recommendations on where unitary authorities should be established. It was considered too expensive to make the system entirely unitary, and also there would doubtlessly be cases where the two-tier system functioned well. The commission recommended that many counties be moved to completely unitary systems; that some cities become unitary authorities, but that the remainder of their parent counties remain two-tier; and that in some counties the ''status quo'' should remain.\n\nThe [[rate-capping rebellion]] was a campaign within English local councils in 1985 which aimed to force the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] to withdraw powers to restrict the spending of councils. The campaign's tactic was that councils whose budgets were restricted would refuse to set any budget at all for the financial year 1985\u201386, requiring the Government to intervene directly in providing local services, or to concede. However, all 15 councils which initially refused to set a rate eventually did so, and the campaign failed to change Government policy. Powers to restrict council budgets have remained in place ever since.\n\nIn 1997, the [[Lieutenancies Act 1997|Lieutenancies Act]] was passed. This firmly separated all local authority areas (whether unitary or two-tier), from the geographical concept of a county as high level spatial unit. The lieutenancies it established became known as [[ceremonial counties]], since they were no longer administrative divisions. The counties represent a compromise between the [[historic counties of England|historic counties]] and the counties established in 1974.\n\nWhile the 1997 Labour government devolved power to [[Welsh Assembly|Wales]], [[Scottish Parliament|Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland]], it refused to create a devolved Assembly or [[Devolved English Parliament|parliament for England]], planning instead to introduce eight regional assemblies around England to devolve power to the regions. In the event, only a [[London Assembly]] (and directly elected [[Mayor]]) was established. Rejection in a referendum of a proposed North-East Assembly in 2004 effectively scrapped those plans. A pre-condition of having a regional assembly was for the whole area to move to unitary authority status. Since the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] the government has floated the idea of voluntary mergers of local councils, avoiding a costly reorganisation but achieving desired reform. For instance, the guiding principles of the government's \"New Localism\" demand levels of efficiency not present in the current over-duplicated two-tier structure.\n\n===Recent changes===\nIn 2009, [[2009 structural changes to local government in England|new changes to local government]] were made whereby a number of new [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]] were created in areas which previously had a 'two-tier' system of [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|counties]] and [[Districts of England|districts]].

Hippocrates is commonly portrayed as the [[wikt:paragon|paragon]] of the ancient physician, and credited with coining the [[Hippocratic Oath]], which is still relevant and in use today. He is also credited with greatly advancing the systematic study of [[clinical medicine]], summing up the medical knowledge of previous schools, and prescribing practices for physicians through the [[Hippocratic Corpus]] and other works.<ref name=\"garrison9293\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=96}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n[[Image:Kos Asklepeion.jpg|300px|thumb|''[[Asklepieion]]'' on [[Kos]]]]\n\nHistorians agree that Hippocrates was born around the year 460 BC on the Greek island of [[Kos]]; other biographical information, however, is likely to be untrue.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nuland|1988|p=4}}</ref>\n\n[[Soranus of Ephesus]], a 2nd-century Greek [[physician]],<ref name=\"BC\">{{Harvnb|Britannica Concise Encyclopedia|2006}}</ref> was Hippocrates' first biographer and is the source of most personal information about him.

The two sons of Hippocrates, [[Thessalus (physician)|Thessalus]] and [[Draco (physician)|Draco]], and his son-in-law, [[Polybus (physician)|Polybus]], were his students. According to [[Galen]], a later physician, Polybus was Hippocrates' true successor, while Thessalus and Draco each had a son named [[Hippocrates (physician)|Hippocrates]] (Hippocrates III and IV).<ref name=\"adams19\">{{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=19}}</ref><ref name=\"margotta66\">{{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=66}}</ref>\n\nSoranus said that Hippocrates learned medicine from his father and grandfather ([[Hippocrates (physicians)|Hippocrates I]]), and studied other subjects with [[Democritus]] and [[Gorgias]]. Hippocrates was probably trained at the [[Asclepieion|asklepieion]] of [[Kos]], and took lessons from the [[Thrace|Thracian]] physician [[Herodicus|Herodicus of Selymbria]]. [[Plato]] mentions Hippocrates in two of his dialogues: in ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', Plato describes Hippocrates as \"Hippocrates of Kos, the [[Asclepiad (Greek)|Asclepiad]]\";<ref name=\"marti86\">{{Harvnb|Mart\u00ed-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez|1961|pp=86\u201387}}</ref><ref>[[#Plato380|Plato 380 B.C.]]</ref> while in ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', Plato suggests that \"Hippocrates the Asclepiad\" thought that a complete knowledge of the nature of the body was necessary for medicine.<ref>[[#Plato360|Plato 360 B.C. 270c]]</ref> Hippocrates taught and practiced medicine throughout his life, traveling at least as far as [[Thessaly]], [[Thrace]], and the [[Sea of Marmara]]. Several different accounts of his death exist. He died, probably in [[Larissa]], at the age of 83, 85 or 90, though some say he lived to be well over 100.<ref name=\"margotta66\"/>\n\n==Hippocratic theory==\n{{rquote|right|''It is thus with regard to the disease called Sacred: it appears to me to be nowise more divine nor more sacred than other diseases, but has a natural cause from the originates like other affections. Men regard its nature and cause as divine from ignorance and wonder....''|Hippocrates, ''On the Sacred Disease''}}\n\nHippocrates is credited with being the first person to believe that diseases were caused naturally, not because of superstition and gods.<ref name=\"philosophy\">{{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=4}}</ref><ref name=\"jones11\"/><ref name=\"nuland8\"/><ref name=\"garrison9394\"/> Hippocrates was credited by the disciples of [[Pythagoras]] of allying philosophy and medicine.<ref name=\"philosophy\"/> He separated the discipline of medicine from religion, believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the [[Greek gods|gods]] but rather the product of environmental factors, diet, and living habits. Indeed there is not a single mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus. However, Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]], such as [[Humorism]].<ref name=\"jones11\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=11}}</ref><ref name=\"nuland8\">{{Harvnb|Nuland|1988|pp=8\u20139}}</ref><ref name=\"garrison9394\">{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|pp=93\u201394}}</ref>\n\nAncient Greek schools of medicine were split (into the Knidian and Koan) on how to deal with disease. The [[Knidos|Knidian]] school of medicine focused on diagnosis.  Medicine at the time of Hippocrates knew almost nothing of human anatomy and physiology because of the Greek [[taboo]] forbidding the dissection of humans. The Knidian school consequently failed to distinguish when one disease caused many possible series of symptoms.<ref name=\"adams15\">{{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=15}}</ref> The Hippocratic school or [[Kos|Koan]] school achieved greater success by applying general [[medical diagnosis|diagnoses]] and passive treatments. Its focus was on patient care and [[prognosis]], not [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. It could effectively treat diseases and allowed for a great development in clinical practice.<ref name=\"margotta67\">{{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=67}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Leff|Leff|1956|p=51}}</ref>\n\nHippocratic medicine and its philosophy are far removed from that of modern medicine. Now, the physician focuses on specific diagnosis and specialized treatment, both of which were espoused by the Knidian school. This shift in medical thought since Hippocrates' day has caused serious criticism over the past two millennia, with the passivity of Hippocratic treatment being the subject of particularly strong denunciations;<!--It seems to me that something is missing here. Hippocrates used methods that succeeded at his time, when medical knowledge was insufficiently advanced to allow for diagnoses or specialized treatments; at that time, attending to the general wellness of the patient was often the best way to allow their own immune system to fight off a disease. I'm almost certain I've seen this opinion in writing somewhere, and if it can be found it should be included.--> for example, the [[French people|French]] doctor M. S. Houdart called the Hippocratic treatment a \"meditation upon death\".<ref name=\"jones1213\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|pp=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===Crisis===\nAnother important concept in Hippocratic medicine was that of a ''crisis'', a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on ''critical days'', which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a ''critical day'', a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.<ref name=\"jones464859\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|pp=46,48,59}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:HippocraticBench.png|thumb|300px|Illustration of a [[Hippocratic bench]], date unknown]]\n\nHippocratic medicine was humble and passive. The therapeutic approach was based on \"the healing power of nature\" (\"''[[vis medicatrix naturae]]''\" in [[Latin]]). According to this doctrine, the body contains within itself the power to re-balance the [[four humours]] and heal itself (''physis'').<ref name=\"garrison99\">{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=99}}</ref> Hippocratic therapy focused on simply easing this natural process. To this end, Hippocrates believed \"rest and immobilization [were] of capital importance.\"<ref name=\"margotta73\">{{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=73}}</ref> In general, the Hippocratic medicine was very kind to the patient; treatment was gentle, and emphasized keeping the patient clean and sterile. For example, only clean water or wine were ever used on wounds, though \"dry\" treatment was preferable. Soothing [[Liniment|balms]] were sometimes employed.<ref name=\"garrison98\">{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=98}}</ref>\n\nHippocrates was reluctant to administer drugs and engage in specialized treatment that might prove to be wrongly chosen; generalized therapy followed a generalized diagnosis.<ref name=\"garrison98\"/><ref name=\"sing35\">{{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=35}}</ref> Generalized treatments he prescribed include fasting and the consumption of a mix of honey and vinegar. Hippocrates once said that \"to eat when you are sick, is to feed your sickness.\" However, potent drugs were used on certain occasions.<ref name=\"britannica\">{{Harvnb|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1911}}</ref> This passive approach was very successful in treating relatively simple ailments such as broken bones which required [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]] to stretch the skeletal system and relieve pressure on the injured area. The [[Hippocratic bench]] and other devices were used to this end.\n\nOne of the strengths of Hippocratic medicine was its emphasis on [[prognosis]]. At Hippocrates' time, medicinal therapy was quite immature, and often the best thing that physicians could do was to evaluate an illness and predict its likely progression based upon data collected in detailed case histories.<ref name=\"garrison9394\"/><ref name=\"garrison97\">{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=97}}</ref>\n\n===Professionalism===\n[[Image:Ancientgreek surgical.jpg|thumb|A number of ancient Greek surgical tools.

These doctrines dictate that physicians record their findings and their medicinal methods in a very clear and objective manner, so that these records may be passed down and employed by other physicians.<ref name=\"margotta66\"/> Hippocrates made careful, regular note of many symptoms including complexion, pulse, fever, pains, movement, and excretions.<ref name=\"garrison97\"/> He is said to have measured a patient's pulse when taking a case history to discover whether the patient was lying.<ref name=\"marti88\">{{Harvnb|Mart\u00ed-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez|1961|p=88}}</ref> Hippocrates extended clinical observations into family history and environment.<ref name=\"margotta68\">{{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=68}}</ref> \"To him medicine owes the art of clinical inspection and observation.\"<ref name=\"garrison9394\"/> For this reason, he may more properly be termed as the \"Father of Medicine\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Leff|Leff|1956|p=45}}</ref>\n\n==Direct contributions to medicine==\n[[Image:ClubbingFingers1.jpg|thumb|Clubbing of fingers in a patient with [[Eisenmenger's syndrome]]; first described by Hippocrates, clubbing is also known as \"Hippocratic fingers\".]]\n\nHippocrates and his followers were first to describe many diseases and medical conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.sciencealert.com/hippocrates-worms-confirmed-ancient-greek-faeces |title= Ancient Poo Is The First-Ever Confirmation Hippocrates Was Right About Parasites |last=Starr |first=Michelle |date=18 December 2017 |website=Science Alert |access-date=18 February 2018}}</ref> He is given credit for the first description of [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] of the fingers, an important diagnostic sign in chronic lung disease, [[lung cancer]] and [[Cyanotic heart defect|cyanotic heart disease]].

While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today, it serves as a foundation for other, similar [[oath]]s and laws that define good medical practice and morals.

Galen perpetuated Hippocratic medicine, moving both forward and backward.<ref name=\"jones35\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=35}}</ref> In the [[Middle Ages]], the Islamic world adopted Hippocratic methods and developed new medical technologies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Leff|Leff|1956|p=102}}</ref> After the [[European Renaissance]], Hippocratic methods were revived in western Europe and even further expanded in the 19th century. Notable among those who employed Hippocrates' rigorous clinical techniques were [[Thomas Sydenham]], [[William Heberden]], [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] and [[William Osler]].

Many physicians of the time wore their hair in the style of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]] and [[Asklepius]]. Accordingly, the busts of Hippocrates that have been found could be only altered versions of portraits of these deities.<ref name=\"garrison100\"/> Hippocrates and the beliefs that he embodied are considered medical ideals.

She emerges three times a year, and will be turned back into a woman if a knight kisses her, making the knight into her consort and ruler of the islands.

12 January 1893&nbsp;\u2013 15 October 1946) was a German political and military leader as well as one of the most powerful figures in the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) that ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945. A veteran [[World War I]] fighter pilot [[Flying aces|ace]], he was a recipient of the ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]'' (The Blue Max). He was the last commander of [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]] (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by [[Manfred von Richthofen]].\n\nAn early member of the Nazi Party, G\u00f6ring was among those wounded in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923. While receiving treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to [[morphine]] which persisted until the last year of his life. After Hitler became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933, G\u00f6ring was named as Minister Without Portfolio in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the [[Gestapo]], which he ceded to [[Heinrich Himmler]] in 1934. Following the establishment of the Nazi state, G\u00f6ring amassed power and political capital to become the second most powerful man in Germany. In 1935, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the [[Luftwaffe]] (air force), a position he held until the final days of the regime. Upon being named [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] in 1936, G\u00f6ring was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control and helped him become one of the wealthiest men in the country. After the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'', which gave him seniority over all officers in [[Wehrmacht|Germany's armed forces]].\n\nBy 1941, G\u00f6ring was at the peak of his power and influence, and Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. As the [[Second World War]] progressed, G\u00f6ring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of [[Defence of the Reich|preventing the Allied bombing of German cities]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad#Sixth Army surrounded|resupplying surrounded German forces in Stalingrad]]. Around that time, G\u00f6ring increasingly withdrew from the military and political scene to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was taken from Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]]. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, G\u00f6ring sent [[G\u00f6ring Telegram|a telegram to Hitler]] requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering it an act of treason, Hitler removed G\u00f6ring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.\n\nAfter the war, G\u00f6ring was convicted of [[conspiracy]], [[crimes against peace]], [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting [[Cyanide poisoning|cyanide]] the night before the sentence was to be carried out.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nG\u00f6ring was born on 12 January 1893{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=21}} at the Marienbad Sanatorium in [[Rosenheim]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. His father, [[Heinrich Ernst G\u00f6ring]] (31 October 1839&nbsp;\u2013 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, had been the first Governor-General of the German protectorate of [[South West Africa|South-West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]).{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|pp=327\u2013330}} Heinrich had five children from a previous marriage. G\u00f6ring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859\u201315 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. G\u00f6ring's elder siblings were Karl, Olga, and Paula; his younger brother was [[Albert G\u00f6ring|Albert]]. At the time that G\u00f6ring was born, his father was serving as consul general in [[Haiti]], and his mother had returned home briefly to give birth. She left the six-week-old baby with a friend in Bavaria and did not see the child again for three years, when she and Heinrich returned to Germany.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R25668, Hermann G\u00f6ring.jpg|thumb|left|upright|G\u00f6ring in 1907, at age 14]]\n\nG\u00f6ring's godfather was Dr. Hermann Epenstein, a wealthy Jewish physician and businessman his father had met in Africa. Epenstein provided the G\u00f6ring family, who were surviving on Heinrich's pension, first with a family home in Berlin-Friedenau,{{sfn|Freitag|2015|pp=25\u201345}} then in a small castle called Veldenstein, near [[Nuremberg]]. G\u00f6ring's mother became Epenstein's mistress around this time, and remained so for some fifteen years. Epenstein acquired the minor title of [[Ritter]] (knight) von Epenstein through service and donations to the Crown.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nInterested in a career as a soldier from a very early age, G\u00f6ring enjoyed playing with toy soldiers and dressing up in a [[Boer]] uniform his father had given him. He was sent to boarding school at age eleven, where the food was poor and discipline was harsh. He sold a violin to pay for his train ticket home, and then took to his bed, feigning illness, until he was told he would not have to return.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201325}} He continued to enjoy war games, pretending to lay siege to the castle Veldenstein and studying [[Teutons|Teutonic]] legends and sagas. He became a mountain climber, scaling peaks in Germany, at the [[Mont Blanc massif]], and in the [[Austrian Alps]]. At sixteen he was sent to a military academy at [[Berlin Lichterfelde]], from which he graduated with distinction.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201328}} (During the Nuremberg war-crimes trials In 1946, psychologist [[Gustave Gilbert]] measured him as having an [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) of 138.){{sfn|Maser|2004|p=392}}\n\nG\u00f6ring joined the Prince Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry) of the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army in 1912. The next year his mother had a falling-out with Epenstein. The family was forced to leave Veldenstein and moved to [[Munich]]; G\u00f6ring's father died shortly afterwards. When World War I began in August 1914, G\u00f6ring was stationed at [[Mulhouse]] with his regiment.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201328}}\n\n== World War I ==\n{{stack|[[File:G\u00f6ring.ogg|thumb|left|Film clip of G\u00f6ring in the cockpit of a [[Fokker D.VII]] during World War I]]}}\n\nDuring the first year of World War I, G\u00f6ring served with his infantry regiment in the area of [[M\u00fclhausen]], a garrison town less than 2&nbsp;km from the French frontier. He was hospitalized with [[rheumatism]], a result of the damp of trench warfare. While he was recovering, his friend [[Bruno Loerzer]] convinced him to transfer to what would become, by October 1916, the ''[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]]'' (\"air combat forces\") of the German army, but his request was turned down. Later that year, G\u00f6ring flew as Loerzer's observer in ''[[Feldflieger Abteilung]]'' 25 (FFA 25)&nbsp;\u2013 G\u00f6ring had informally transferred himself. He was discovered and sentenced to three weeks' confinement to barracks, but the sentence was never carried out. By the time it was supposed to be imposed, G\u00f6ring's association with Loerzer had been made official. They were assigned as a team to FFA 25 in the [[William, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince]]'s Fifth Army. They flew reconnaissance and bombing missions, for which the Crown Prince invested both G\u00f6ring and Loerzer with the [[Iron Cross]], first class.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=28\u201329}}\n\nAfter completing the pilot's training course, G\u00f6ring was assigned to [[Jagdstaffel 5|''Jagdstaffel'' 5]]. Seriously wounded in the hip in aerial combat, he took nearly a year to recover. He then was transferred to [[Jagdstaffel 26|''Jagdstaffel'' 26]], commanded by Loerzer, in February 1917. He steadily scored [[dogfight|air victories]] until May, when he was assigned to command [[Jagdstaffel 27|''Jagdstaffel'' 27]]. Serving with ''Jastas'' 5, 26, and 27, he continued to win victories. In addition to his Iron Crosses (1st and 2nd Class), he received the [[Order of the Z\u00e4hringer Lion|Z\u00e4hringer Lion]] with swords, the [[Friedrich Order]], the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]] with swords third class, and finally, in May 1918, the coveted ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]''.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31\u201332}} According to [[Hermann Dahlmann]], who knew both men, G\u00f6ring had Loerzer lobby for the award.{{sfn|Franks|1993|pp= 95, 117, 156 }} He finished the war with [[List of World War I aces credited with 20 or more victories|22 victories]].{{sfn|Franks|1993|p=117}} A thorough post-war examination of [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] loss records showed that only two of his awarded victories were doubtful.

At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots intentionally crash-landed their planes to keep them from falling into enemy hands.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=34\u201336}}\n\nLike many other German veterans, G\u00f6ring was a proponent of the [[Stab-in-the-back legend]], the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the civilian leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the [[Weimar Republic|Republicans]], who had overthrown the German monarchy.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=39}}\n\n== After World War I ==\n\nG\u00f6ring remained in aviation after the war. He tried [[barnstorming]] and briefly worked at [[Fokker]]. After spending most of 1919 living in [[Denmark]], he moved to Sweden and joined [[Svensk Lufttrafik]], a Swedish airline. G\u00f6ring was often hired for private flights. During the winter of 1920\u20131921, he was hired by [[Count Eric von Rosen]] to fly him to his castle from Stockholm. Invited to spend the night, G\u00f6ring may at this time have first seen the [[swastika]] emblem, which Rosen had set in the chimney piece as a family badge.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=39\u201341}}{{efn|name=swastika}}\n\nThis was also the first time that G\u00f6ring saw his future wife; the count introduced his sister-in-law, Baroness [[Carin G\u00f6ring|Carin von Kantzow]] (''n\u00e9e'' Freiin von Fock). Estranged from her husband of ten years, she had an eight-year-old son. G\u00f6ring was immediately infatuated and asked her to meet him in Stockholm. They arranged a visit at the home of her parents and spent much time together through 1921, when G\u00f6ring left for Munich to take political science at the university. Carin obtained a divorce, followed G\u00f6ring to Munich, and married him on 3 February 1922.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=43}} Their first home together was a hunting lodge at Hochkreuth in the [[Bavarian Alps]], near [[Bayrischzell]], some {{convert|80|km|mi}} from Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=41, 43}} After G\u00f6ring met [[Adolf Hitler]] and joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) in 1922, they moved to Obermenzing, a suburb of Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}\n\n== Early Nazi career ==\n[[File:Hitler 1928.jpg|left|upright=1.0|thumb|G\u00f6ring (left) stands in front of [[Hitler]] at a Nazi rally in [[Nuremberg]] (c. 1928)]]\n\nG\u00f6ring joined the Nazi Party in 1922 after hearing a speech by Hitler.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}{{sfn|Miller|2006|p=426}} He was given command of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) as the ''[[Oberster SA-F\u00fchrer]]'' in 1923.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=112}} He was later appointed an ''SA-[[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' (Lieutenant General) and held this rank on the SA rolls until 1945. At this time, Carin\u2014who liked Hitler\u2014often played hostess to meetings of leading Nazis, including her husband, Hitler, [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], and [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=47}} Hitler later recalled his early association with G\u00f6ring:\n\n{{quote|text=\"I liked him.

G\u00f6ring, who was with Hitler leading the march to the War Ministry, was shot in the leg. Fourteen Nazis and four policemen were killed; many top Nazis, including Hitler, were arrested.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=131}} With Carin's help, G\u00f6ring was smuggled to [[Innsbruck]], where he received surgery and was given morphine for the pain.

The G\u00f6rings\u2014acutely short of funds and reliant on the good will of Nazi sympathizers abroad\u2014moved from Austria to [[Venice]]. In May 1924 they visited Rome, via [[Florence]] and [[Siena]]. G\u00f6ring met Mussolini, who expressed an interest in meeting Hitler, who was by then in prison.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=59\u201360}}\n\nPersonal problems continued to multiply. By 1925, Carin's mother was ill. The G\u00f6rings\u2014with difficulty\u2014raised the money in the spring of 1925 for a journey to Sweden via Austria, [[Czechoslovakia]], Poland, and [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] (now Gda\u0144sk). G\u00f6ring had become a violent morphine addict; Carin's family were shocked by his deterioration. Carin, who was ill with [[epilepsy]] and a weak heart, had to allow the doctors to take charge of G\u00f6ring; her son was taken by his father. G\u00f6ring was certified a dangerous drug addict and was placed in L\u00e5ngbro asylum on 1 September 1925.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=61}} He was violent to the point where he had to be confined in a [[straitjacket]], but his psychiatrist felt he was sane; the condition was caused solely by the morphine.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=404}} Weaned off the drug, he left the facility briefly, but had to return for further treatment. He returned to Germany when an amnesty was declared in 1927 and resumed working in the aircraft industry.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=62, 64}} Hitler, who had written ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' while in prison, had been released in December 1924.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=160}} Carin G\u00f6ring, ill with [[epilepsy]] and tuberculosis,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=146}} died of heart failure on 17 October 1931.\n\nMeanwhile, the NSDAP was in a period of rebuilding and waiting. The economy had recovered, which meant fewer opportunities for the Nazis to agitate for change. The SA was reorganised, but with [[Franz Pfeffer von Salomon]] as its head rather than G\u00f6ring, and the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) was founded in 1925, initially as a bodyguard for Hitler. Membership in the party increased from 27,000 in 1925 to 108,000 in 1928 and 178,000 in 1929. In [[German federal election, 1928|the May 1928 elections]] the NSDAP only obtained 12 seats out of an available 491 in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=118\u2013121}} G\u00f6ring was elected as a representative from Bavaria.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=66}} The [[Great Depression]] led to a disastrous downturn in the German economy, and [[German federal election, 1930|in the 1930 election]], the NSDAP won 6,409,600 votes and 107 seats.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=136, 138}} In May 1931, Hitler sent G\u00f6ring on a mission to the [[Holy See|Vatican]], where he met the future [[Pope Pius XII]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=74}}\n\nIn the [[German federal election, July 1932|July 1932 election]], the Nazis won 230 seats to become far and away the largest party in the Reichstag.

The force was called the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'', or [[Gestapo]]. G\u00f6ring, thinking that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} By this time, the SA numbered over two million men.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=95}}\n\nHitler was deeply concerned that [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]], the chief of the SA, was planning a coup.

Sensing its implications, Koller immediately flew to Berchtesgaden to notify G\u00f6ring, who feared being accused of treason if he tried to take power. On the other hand, if he did nothing, he feared being accused of dereliction of duty. After some hesitation, G\u00f6ring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler's successor. It not only placed G\u00f6ring first in the line of succession, but also stated that, if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action, G\u00f6ring had complete authority to act on Hitler's behalf as his deputy. After conferring with Koller and [[Hans Lammers]], the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery, G\u00f6ring concluded that, by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing.

With this in mind, G\u00f6ring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitler's deputy.

Italian Foreign Minister [[Galeazzo Ciano]] once noted G\u00f6ring wearing a fur coat that looked like what \"a high grade prostitute wears to the opera\".{{sfn|Fussell|2002|pp=24\u201325}} He threw lavish housewarming parties each time a round of construction was completed at Carinhall, and changed costumes several times throughout the evenings.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=122}}\n\nG\u00f6ring was noted for his patronage of music, especially opera. He entertained frequently and sumptuously, and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=417}} Armaments minister [[Albert Speer]] recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars, Dutch cigars, and valuable artwork. For his birthday in 1944, Speer gave G\u00f6ring an oversize marble bust of Hitler.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=416\u2013417}} As a member of the Prussian Council of State, Speer was required to donate a considerable portion of his salary towards the Council's birthday gift to G\u00f6ring without even being asked. ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Erhard Milch]] told Speer that similar donations were required out of the Air Ministry's general fund.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=417\u2013418}} For his birthday in 1940, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano decorated G\u00f6ring with the coveted [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|Collar of Annunziata]]. The award reduced him to tears.{{sfn|Mosley|1974|p=280}}\n\n[[File:Standarte des Reichsmarschalls (1941\u201345).jpg|thumb|Standard, on display at the ''Mus\u00e9e de la Guerre'' in [[Les Invalides]], Paris]]\n\nThe design of the ''Reichsmarschall'' standard, on a light blue field, featured a gold [[German eagle]] grasping a wreath surmounted by two batons overlaid with a [[swastika]]. The reverse side of the flag had the ''Gro\u00dfkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'' (\"[[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]]\") surrounded by a wreath between four Luftwaffe eagles. The flag was carried by a personal standard-bearer at all public occasions.\n\nThough he liked to be called \"''der Eiserne''\" (the Iron Man), the once dashing and muscular fighter pilot had become corpulent. He was one of the few Nazi leaders who did not take offence at hearing jokes about himself, \"no matter how rude\", taking them as a sign of popularity. Germans joked about his ego, saying that he would wear an admiral's uniform with rubber medals to take a bath, and his obesity, joking that \"he sits down on his stomach\".{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|p=330}}{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=65}} One joke claimed that he had sent a wire to Hitler after his visit to the Vatican: \"Mission accomplished.

But G\u00f6ring supported the [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=136\u2013137}} He required the registration of all Jewish property as part of the Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=189\u2013191}}\n\nAt the same meeting, options for the disposition of the Jews and their property were discussed. Jews would be segregated into ghettos or encouraged to emigrate, and their property would be seized in a programme of [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]]. Compensation for seized property would be low, if any was given at all.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=189\u2013191}} Detailed minutes of this meeting and other documents were read out at the Nuremberg trial, proving his knowledge of and complicity with the persecution of the Jews.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=369}} He told Gilbert that he would never have supported the anti-Jewish measures if he had known what was going to happen. \"I only thought we would eliminate Jews from positions in big business and government\", he claimed.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=378}}\n\nIn July 1941, G\u00f6ring issued a memo to [[Reinhard Heydrich]] ordering him to organise the practical details of the [[Final Solution]] to the \"Jewish Question\". By the time that this letter was written, many Jews and others had already been killed in Poland, [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]], and elsewhere. At the [[Wannsee Conference]], held six months later, Heydrich formally announced that genocide of the Jews was now official Reich policy. G\u00f6ring did not attend the conference, but he was present at other meetings where the number of people killed was discussed.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=259\u2013260}}{{sfn|Blood|2001|p=75}}\n\nG\u00f6ring directed [[anti-partisan]] operations by Luftwaffe security battalions in the [[Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest]] between 1942 and 1944 that resulted in the murder of thousands of Jews and Polish civilians.{{sfn|Blood|2010|pp=261\u2013262, 266}}\n\n== Support of anti-Nazi brother ==\n{{main article|Albert G\u00f6ring}}\n\nG\u00f6ring's younger brother Albert despised [[Nazism]], and offered active resistance to the regime, including helping prisoners escape from concentration camps.
