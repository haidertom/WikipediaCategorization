During 16th century European explorers reached what is now Colombian territory as early as 1510 in Santa Mar\u00eda Antigua del Dari\u00e9n (in present-day Choc\u00f3 department). For the next couple of decades Colombia, and South America in general, remained largely unexplored.\n\nFrom 1533 to 1600, Europeans began expeditions into the interior of current Colombia. The intent of these expeditions was mainly to conquer new lands and exploit the villages of its resources.  Legends of El Dorado that reached Spaniard explorers continued to fuel exploration and raiding of Indian villages. Major conquistadors from this period were Pedro de Heredia, Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada, Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalcazar, and Nikolaus Federmann.\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the colonial settlements in Colombia served purposes of extraction of precious metals and other natural resources, and later slavery trade. This economic arrangement left the Colony with little room for building solid institutionality for economic development.  The main non-extractive institutions emerging in this centuries were the fortified port of Cartagena and the Viceroyalty of New Granada.  Cartagena developed military defenses mainly out of necessity from frequently having to deal with pirate attacks.  A primitive form of colonial administration was organized in Santa f\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1 with the  Viceroyalty of New Granada, especially under the tenure of Jos\u00e9 Sol\u00eds y Folch de Cardona (1753-1761), who conducted a census and build roads, bridges and aqueducts.\n\nFollowing the War of the Thousand Days (1899\u20131902), Colombia experienced a coffee boom that catapulted the country into the modern period, bringing the attendant benefits of transportation, particularly railroads, communications infrastructure, and the first major attempts at manufacturing.\n\nHowever, Colombia's consistently sound economic policies and aggressive promotion of free trade agreements in recent years have bolstered its ability to weather external shocks. Real GDP has grown more than 4% per year for the past three years, continuing almost a decade of strong economic performance.<ref name=cia.gov />\n\nIn 1990, the administration of President [[C\u00e9sar Gaviria Trujillo]] (1990\u201394) initiated [[economic liberalism]] policies or \"apertura economica\" and this has continued since then, with tariff reductions, financial deregulation, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and adoption of a more liberal foreign exchange rate. Almost all sectors became open to foreign investment although agricultural products remained protected.\n\nThe original idea of his then [[Minister of Finance]], Rudolf Homes, was that the country should import agricultural products in which it was not competitive, like [[maize]], [[wheat]], [[cotton]] and [[soybeans]] and export the ones in which it had an advantage, like [[fruits]] and [[flowers]]. In ten years, the sector lost 7,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 to imports, represented mostly in heavily [[agricultural subsidy|subsidized agricultural products]] from the [[United States]], as a result of this policy, with a critical impact on employment in rural areas.<ref>[http://www.usip.org/library/pa/colombia/adddoc/plan_colombia_101999.html#approach Plan Colombia: Colombia: Peace Agreements: Library and Links: U.S. Institute of Peace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041124093520/http://www.usip.org/library/pa/colombia/adddoc/plan_colombia_101999.html |date=24 November 2004 }}</ref> Still, this policy makes food cheaper for the average Colombian than it would be if agricultural trade were more restricted.\n\nUntil 1997, Colombia had enjoyed a fairly stable economy. The first five years of liberalization were characterized by high economic growth rates of between 4% and 5%. The [[Ernesto Samper]] administration (1994\u201398) emphasized social welfare policies which targeted Colombia's lower income population. These reforms led to higher government spending which increased the fiscal deficit and public sector debt, the financing of which required higher interest rates. An over-valued peso inherited from the previous administration was maintained.\n\nThe economy slowed, and by 1998 GDP growth was only 0.6%. In 1999, the country fell into its first recession since the [[Great Depression]]. The economy shrank by 4.5% with unemployment at over 20%. While unemployment remained at 20% in 2000, GDP growth recovered to 3.1%.\n\nThe administration of President [[Andr\u00e9s Pastrana Arango]], when it took office on 7 August 1998, faced an economy in crisis, with the difficult internal security situation and global economic turbulence additionally inhibiting confidence. As evidence of a serious recession became clear in 1999, the government took a number of steps. It engaged in a series of controlled devaluations of the peso, followed by a decision to let it float. Colombia also entered into an agreement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] which provided a $2.7 billion guarantee (extended funds facility), while committing the government to budget discipline and structural reforms.\n\nBy early 2000 there had been the beginning of an economic recovery, with the export sector leading the way, as it enjoyed the benefit of the more competitive exchange rate, as well as strong prices for [[petroleum]], Colombia's leading export product. Prices of [[coffee]], the other principal export product, have been more variable.\n\nEconomic growth reached 3.1% during 2000 and inflation 9.0%. Colombia's international reserves have remained stable at around $8.35 billion, and Colombia has successfully remained in international capital markets. Colombia's total foreign debt at the end of 1999 was $34.5 billion with $14.7 billion in private sector and $19.8 billion in public sector debt. Major international [[credit rating]] organizations have dropped Colombian [[government debt|sovereign debt]] below investment grade, primarily as a result of large fiscal deficits, which current policies are seeking to close.\n\nFormer president [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe]] (elected 7 August 2002) introduced several economic reforms, including measures designed to reduce the public-sector deficit below 2.5% of GDP in 2004. The government's economic policy and [[democratic security]] strategy have engendered a growing sense of confidence in the economy, particularly within the business sector, and GDP growth in 2003 was among the highest in [[Latin America]], at over 4%. This growth rate was maintained over the next decade, averaging 4.8% from 2004 to 2014.<ref name=imf2 />\n\nThe government is supporting the development of ethanol production. By 2012, the tourism industry is small but growing rapidly.\n\n==Economy \u2013 overview==\n{{prose|section|date=July 2016}}\nColombia's economy has experienced rapid increase over the past three years despite a serious armed conflict. The economy continues to grow in part because of austere government budgets, focused efforts to reduce public debt levels, an export-oriented growth strategy, an improved security situation in the country, and high commodity prices. Ongoing economic problems facing President Uribe range from reforming the pension system to reducing high unemployment, and to achieving congressional passage of a fiscal transfers reform. New exploration is needed to offset declining [[oil production]]. International and domestic financial analysts note with concern the growing central government deficit, which hovers at 5% of GDP. However, the government's economic policy and democratic security strategy have engendered a growing sense of confidence in the economy, particularly within the business sector. Unlike other Latin-American countries like Argentina or Venezuela, Colombia's conservative government for a long time did not reduce its incredibly high inequality. It's gini coefficient remained on-highest in South America at 0.59, though recent figures show a small decrease in economic inequality to a gini coefficient of 53.8 [http://www.eltiempo.com/economia/sectores/pobreza-en-colombia-retos-para-vencer-la-desigualdad/15482137]\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\nlowest 10%: 0.8%\nhighest 10%: 45.9% (2006)\n\nInvestment (gross fixed):\n24.3% of GDP (2008 est.)\n\nBudget:\nrevenues: $83.22 billion\nexpenditures: $82.92 billion; including capital expenditures of $NA (2008 est.)\n\nCentral bank discount rate:\n11.5% (31 December 2008)\n\nCommercial bank prime lending rate:\n15.6% (31 December 2008)\n\nStock of money:\n$21.58 billion (31 December 2008)\n\nStock of quasi money:\n$26.57 billion (31 December 2008)\n\nStock of domestic credit:\n$89.69 billion (31 December 2008)\n\nMarket value of publicly traded shares:\n$87.03 billion (31 December 2008)\n\nAgriculture \u2013 products:\ncoffee, cut flowers, bananas, rice, tobacco, corn, sugarcane, cocoa beans, oilseed, vegetables; forest products; shrimp\n\nIndustries:\ntextiles, food processing, oil, clothing and footwear, beverages, chemicals, cement; gold, coal, emeralds, shipbuilding, electronics, home appliance, and furniture.\n\nIndustrial production growth rate:\n2% (2013 est.)\n\nElectricity \u2013 production:\n53.6 billion kWh (2007)\n\nElectricity \u2013 consumption:\n52.8 billion kWh (2007)\n\nElectricity \u2013 exports:\n876.7 million kWh (2007)\n\nElectricity \u2013 imports:\n38.4 million kWh (2007)\n\nOil \u2013 production:\n{{convert|588000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} (2008 est.)\n\nOil \u2013 consumption:\n{{convert|267000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} (2007 est.)\n\nOil \u2013 exports:\n{{convert|294000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} (2008 est.)\n\nOil \u2013 imports:\n{{convert|12480|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} (2005)\n\nOil \u2013 proved reserves:\n{{convert|1323000000|oilbbl|abbr=on}} (1 January 2008 est.)\n\nNatural gas \u2013 production:\n7.22 billion cu m (2006 est.)\n\nNatural gas \u2013 consumption:\n7.22 billion cu m (2006 est.)\n\nNatural gas \u2013 exports:\n0 cu m (2007 est.)\n\nNatural gas \u2013 imports:\n0 cu m (2007 est.)\n\nNatural gas \u2013 proved reserves:\n122.9 billion cu m (1 January 2008 est.)\n\nCurrent account balance:\n$\u22126.761 billion (2008 est.)\n\nExchange rates:\nColombian pesos (COP) per US dollar \u2013 2,243.6 (2008), 2,013.8 (2007), 2,358.6 (2006), 2,320.75 (2005), 2,628.61 (2004)\n\nSource:<ref name=\"cia.gov\" />\n\n===Development of main indicators===\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017.

One of Colombia's largest producers of domestic appliances, [[HACEB]] has been producing refrigeration since 1940. Some domestic corporations include: Challenger, Kalley, [[HACEB]], Imusa, and Landers. In 2011, Groupe SEB acquired Imusa as a form to expand to the Latin American market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.groupeseb.com/en-en/content/acquisition-imusa-conclusive-steps|title=Acquisition of Imusa : conclusive steps|work=Groupe SEB|date=Dec 2010}}</ref> Colombia also manufactures for foreign companies as well, such as Whirlpool and GE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euromonitor.com/consumer-appliances-in-colombia/report|title=Consumer Appliances in Colombia|work=Euromonitor International|date=Jan 2015}}</ref> LG has also been interested in building a plant in Colombia. Colombia is also Latin America's 3rd largest producer of appliances behind Mexico and Brazil and is growing rapidly.\n\n====Electronics====\nColombia is a major producer of electronics in Latin America, and is South America's 2nd largest high-tech market.<ref name=\"crn.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/300073509/colombia-launches-it-push-to-grow-countrys-technology-sector-internationally.htm|title=Colombia Launches IT Push To Grow Country's Technology Sector Internationally|work=CRN|date=24 Jul 2014}}</ref> Colombia is also the 2nd largest producer and exporter of electronics made by domestic companies in Latin America. Since the early 2000s, major Colombian corporations began exporting aggressively to foreign markets. Some of these companies include: Challenger, PcSmart, Compumax, Colcircuirtos, and Kalley. Colombia is the first country in Latin America to manufacture a domestically made 4K television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/tecnosfera/novedades-tecnologia/compra-televisores-4k-guia-para-colombia/15151737|title=Todo listo para masificaci\u00f3n de televisores tecnolog\u00eda 4K en Colombia|work=El Tiempo|date=27 Jan 2015}}</ref> In 2014, the Colombian Government launched a national campaign to promote IT and Electronic sectors, as well as investing in Colombia's own companies.<ref name=\"crn.com\" /> Although innovation remains low on the global scale, the government sees heavy potential in the high tech industry and is investing heavily in education and innovation centers all across the nation. Because of this, Colombia could become a major global manufacturer of electronics and play an important role in the global high tech industry in the near future. In 2014, the Colombian government released another national campaign to help Colombian companies have a bigger share of the national market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yocomprocolombiano.com/|title=Compre Colombiano|publisher=Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism}}</ref>\n\n====Construction====\nConstruction recently has played a vital role in the economy, and is growing rapidly at almost 20% annually. As a result, Colombia is seeing a historic building boom.  The Colombian government is investing heavily in transport infrastructure through a plan called \"Fourth Generation Network\". The target of the Colombian government is to build 7,000&nbsp;km of roads for the 2016\u20132020 period and reduce travel times by 30% and transport costs by 20%. A toll road concession program will comprise 40 projects, and is part of a larger strategic goal to invest nearly $50bn in transport infrastructure, including: railway systems; making the [[Magdalena river]] navigable again; improving port facilities; as well as an expansion of [[El Dorado International Airport|Bogot\u00e1\u2019s airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dc5d5fe6-668d-11e4-8bf6-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3KHAts7QM|title= Ambitious plans to transform Colombia|publisher= Financial Times|accessdate= 27 November 2014}}</ref> Long term plans include building a national high-speed train network, to vastly improve competitiveness.\n\n===Agriculture===\n{{main|Agriculture in Colombia}}\nThe share of agriculture in GDP has fallen consistently since 1945, as industry and services have expanded. However, Colombia\u2019s agricultural share of GDP decreased during the 1990s by less than in many of the world\u2019s countries at a similar level of development, even though the share of coffee in GDP diminished in a dramatic way. Agriculture has nevertheless remained an important source of employment, providing a fifth of Colombia's jobs in 2006.<ref name=\"Hern\u00e1n Vallejo 2010\">Roberto Steiner and Hern\u00e1n Vallejo. \"The Economy\". In ''Colombia: A Country Study'' (Rex A. Hudson, ed.). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (2010).</ref>\n\nThe most industrially diverse member of the five-nation Andean Community, Colombia has four major industrial centers\u2014Bogota, Medellin, Cali, and Barranquilla, each located in a distinct geographical region. Colombia's industries include textiles and clothing, particularly lingerie, leather products, processed foods and beverages, paper and paper products, chemicals and petrochemicals, cement, construction, iron and steel products, and metalworking. Its diverse climate and topography permit the cultivation of a wide variety of crops. In addition, all regions yield forest products, ranging from tropical hardwoods in the hot country to pine and eucalyptus in the colder areas.\n\n[[Cacao bean]]s, [[sugarcane]], [[coconut]]s, [[banana]]s, [[cooking plantain|plantains]], [[rice]], [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], [[cassava]], and most of the nation's beef cattle are produced in the hot regions from sea level to 1,000 meters elevation. The temperate regions\u2014between 1,000 and 2,000 meters\u2014are better suited for [[coffee]]; [[cut flowers]]; [[maize]] and other vegetables; and fruits such as [[citrus]], [[pear]]s, [[pineapple]]s, and [[tomato]]es. The cooler elevations\u2014between 2,000 and 3,000 meter\u2014produce [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[potato]]es, cold-climate vegetables, flowers, [[dairy]] cattle, and [[poultry]].\n\n==Mining and energy==\nColombia is well-endowed with [[mineral]]s and energy resources. It has the largest [[coal]] reserves in Latin America, and is second to [[Brazil]] in [[hydroelectric]] potential. Estimates of [[petroleum]] reserves in 1995 were {{convert|3.1|Goilbbl|m3}}. It also possesses significant amounts of [[nickel]], [[gold]], [[silver]], [[platinum]], and [[emerald]]s.\n\nThe discovery of {{convert|2|Goilbbl|m3}} of high-quality oil at the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields, about {{convert|200|km|mi}} east of [[Bogot\u00e1]], has enabled Colombia to become a net oil exporter since 1986. The [[Transandino pipeline]] transports oil from [[Orito]] in the [[Department of Putumayo]] to the Pacific port of [[Tumaco]] in the [[Department of Nari\u00f1o]].<ref name=unco>{{cite news|publisher=UNCO United Refineries|url=http://www.uncounitedrefineries.com/content/bostproject2.php|title=BOST project|accessdate=8 June 2008}}</ref> Total crude oil production averages {{convert|620|koilbbl/d|m3/d}}; about {{convert|184|koilbbl/d|m3/d}} is exported. The [[Andr\u00e9s Pastrana|Pastrana]] government has significantly liberalized its petroleum investment policies, leading to an increase in exploration activity. Refining capacity cannot satisfy domestic demand, so some refined products, especially [[gasoline]], must be imported. Plans for the construction of a new refinery are under development.\n\nWhile Colombia has vast hydroelectric potential, a prolonged drought in 1992 forced severe electricity rationing throughout the country until mid-1993. The consequences of the drought on electricity-generating capacity caused the government to commission the construction or upgrading of 10 [[thermoelectric]] power plants. Half will be coal-fired, and half will be fired by [[natural gas]]. The government also has begun awarding bids for the construction of a natural gas pipeline system that will extend from the country's extensive gas fields to its major population centers. Plans call for this project to make natural gas available to millions of Colombian households by the middle of the next decade.\n\nAs of 2004, Colombia has become a net energy exporter, exporting electricity to [[Ecuador]] and developing connections to [[Peru]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Panama]] to export to those markets as well. The [[Trans-Caribbean pipeline]] connecting western Venezuela to Panama through Colombia is also under construction, thanks to cooperation between presidents [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe]] of Colombia, [[Mart\u00edn Torrijos]] of Panama and [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] of Venezuela. Coal is exported to [[Coal in Turkey|Turkey]].\n\n===Human rights abuses in mining zones===\nThe oil pipelines are a frequent target of extortion and bombing campaigns by the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|National Liberation Army]] (ELN) and, more recently, the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC).{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The bombings, which have occurred on average once every 5 days, have caused substantial environmental damage, often in fragile [[rainforest]]s and jungles, as well as causing significant loss of life.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} In April 1999 in Cartagena de Indias, Clinton's Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson spoke before investors from the United States, Canada and other countries. He expressed his government's willingness to use military aid to support the investment that they and their allies were going to make in Colombia, especially in strategically important sectors like mining and energy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nIn 2002 there were 170 attacks on the 2nd largest pipeline, which travels 780&nbsp;km from the [[Ca\u00f1o Lim\u00f3n]] to the Atlantic port of Cove\u00f1as. The pipeline was out of operation for 266 days of that year;{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} the government estimates that these bombings reduced Colombia's GDP by 0.5%.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The government of the [[United States]] increased military aid, in 2003, to Colombia to assist in the effort to defend the pipeline.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} [[Occidental Petroleum]] privately contracted mercenaries who flew [[Cessna Skymaster|Skymaster]] planes,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} from [[AirScan]] International Inc.,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} to patrol the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline. Many of these operations used helicopters, equipment and weapons provided by the U.S. military and anti-narcotics aid programs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nMining and natural exploitation has had environmental consequences. The region of Guajira is undergoing an accelerated desertification with the disappearances of forests, land, and water sources, due to the increase in coal production.<ref>[http://thephoenix.com/Boston/news/48183-dirty-story-behind-local-energy/?page=3#TOPCONTENT \"The Dirty Story Behind Local Energy\"], ''The Boston Phoenix'', 1 October 2007.</ref> Social consequences or lack of development in resource rich areas is common. 11 million Colombians survive on less than one dollar a day. Over 65% of these live in mining zones. There are 3.5 million children out of school, and the most critical situation is in the mining zone of Choco, Bolivar, and Sucre.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nEconomic consequences of privatization and liberal institutions have meant changes in taxation to attract foreign investment. Colombia will lose another $800 million over the next 90 years that [[Glencore International]] operates in El [[Cerrejon]] Zona Media, if the company continues to produce coal at a rate of 5 million tons/year, because of the reduction of the royalty tax from 10-15% to .04%.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} If the company, as is plausible, doubles or triples its production, the losses will be proportionally greater.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The operational losses from the three large mining projects ([[El Cerrejon]], [[El Paso, Cesar|La Loma]], operated by Drummond, and [[Montel\u00edbano]], which produces [[ferronickel]]) for Colombia to more than 12 billion. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nCoal production has grown rapidly, from 22.7 million tons in 1994 to 50.0 million tons in 2003.<ref>Unidad de Planeaci\u00f3n Minero Energ\u00e9tica \u2013 UPME (2004), ''Bolet\u00edn Estad\u00edstico de Minas y Energ\u00eda 1994\u20132004''.

Although the analysis of the results are not clear,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} the fact is that the agricultural sector was severely impacted by this policy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nIn 1991 and 1992, the government passed laws to stimulate foreign investment in nearly all sectors of the economy. The only activities closed to foreign direct investment are defense and national security, disposal of hazardous wastes, and real estate\u2014the last of these restrictions is intended to hinder money laundering. Colombia established a special entity\u2014Converter\u2014to assist foreigners in making investments in the country. Foreign investment flows for 1999 were $4.4 billion, down from $4.8 billion in 1998.\n\nMajor foreign investment projects underway include the $6 billion development of the Cusiana and Cupiagua oil fields, development of coal fields in the north of the country, and the recently concluded licensing for establishment of cellular telephone service. The United States accounted for 26.5% of the total $19.4 billion stock of non petroleum foreign direct investment in Colombia at the end of 1998.\n\nOn 21 October 1995, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), President Clinton signed an Executive Order barring U.S. entities from any commercial or financial transactions with four Colombian drug kingpins and with individuals and companies associated with the traffic in narcotics, as designated by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. The list of designated individuals and companies is amended periodically and is maintained by the Office of Foreign Asset Control at the Department of the Treasury, tel. (202) 622-0077 (ask for Document #1900). The document also is available at [http://www.ustreas.gov/ the Department of Treasury web site].\n\nColombia is the United States' fifth-largest export market in Latin America\u2014behind Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina\u2014and the 26th-largest market for U.S. products worldwide. The United States is Colombia's principal trading partner, with two-way trade from November 1999 through November 2000 exceeding $9.5 billion--$3.5 billion U.S. exports and $6.0 billion U.S. imports. Colombia benefits from duty-free entry\u2014for a 10-year period, through 2001\u2014for certain of its exports to the United States under the Andean Trade Preferences Act. Colombia improved protection of intellectual property rights through the adoption of three Andean Pact decisions in 1993 and 1994, but the U.S. remains concerned over deficiencies in licensing, patent regulations, and copyright protection.\n\nColombia is also the largest export partner of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Constituent state|constituent country]] of [[Aruba]] (39.4%).<ref name=cia.gov />\n\nThe petroleum and natural gas coal mining, chemical, and manufacturing industries attract the greatest U.S. investment interest. U.S. investment accounted for 37.8% ($4.2 billion) of the total $11.2 billion in foreign direct investment at the end of 1997, excluding petroleum and portfolio investment. Worker rights and benefits in the U.S.-dominated sectors are more favorable than general working conditions. Examples include shorter-than-average working hours, higher wages, and compliance with health and safety standards above the national average.\n\n==Tertiary industries==\nThe services sector dominates Colombia's GDP, contributing 58 percent of GDP in 2007, and, given worldwide trends, its dominance will probably continue. The sector is characterized by its heterogeneity, being the largest for employment (61 percent), in both the formal and informal sectors.<ref name=\"Hern\u00e1n Vallejo 2010\" />\n\n===Arts and music===\nSince the early 2010s, the Colombian government has shown interest in exporting modern Colombian pop culture to the world (which includes video games, music, movies, TV shows, fashion, cosmetics, and food) as a way of diversifying the economy and changing the image of Colombia. In the Hispanic world, Colombia is only behind Mexico in cultural exports at US$750 million annually, and is already a regional leader in cosmetic and beauty exports.<ref name=\"cultural\" />\n\n===Travel and tourism===\nTourism in Colombia is an important sector in the country's economy.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Colombia has major attractions as a tourist destination, such as Cartagena and its historic surroundings, which are on the UNESCO World Heritage List; the insular department of San Andr\u00e9s, Providencia y Santa Catalina; Santa Marta, Cartagena and the surrounding area. Fairly recently, Bogot\u00e1, the nation's capital, has become Colombia's major tourist destination because of its improved museums and entertainment facilities and its major urban renovations, including the rehabilitation of public areas, the development of parks, and the creation of an extensive network of cycling routes. With its very rich and varied geography, which includes the Amazon and Andean regions, the llanos, the Caribbean and Pacific coasts, and the deserts of La Guajira, and its unique biodiversity, Colombia also has major potential for ecotourism.<ref>Roberto Steiner and Hern\u00e1n Vallejo. \"Tourism\". In ''Colombia: A Country Study'' (Rex A. Hudson, ed.). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (2010)</ref>\n\nThe direct contribution of Travel & Tourism to GDP in 2013 was COP11,974.3bn (1.7% of GDP). This is forecast to rise by 7.4% to COP12,863.4bn in 2014.This primarily reflects the economic activity generated by industries such as hotels, travel agents, airlines and other passenger transportation services (excluding commuter services). But it also includes, for example, the activities of the restaurant and leisure industries directly supported by tourists.<ref>[http://www.wttc.org/ World Travel and Tourism Council]. Travel and Tourism Economic Impact 2014: Colombia</ref> The direct contribution of Travel & Tourism to GDP is expected to grow by 4.1% pa to COP19,208.4bn (1.8% of GDP) by 2024.\n\n====Eco-tourism====\nEco-tourism is very promising in Colombia. Colombia has vast coastlines, mountainous areas, and tropical jungles. There are volcanoes and waterfalls as well. This makes Colombia a very biodiverse country with many attractions for foreign visitors.\n\nThe Colombian coffee growing axis (Spanish: Eje Cafetero), also known as the Coffee Triangle (Spanish: Tri\u00e1ngulo del Caf\u00e9) is a part of the Colombian Paisa region in the rural area of Colombia. which is famous for growing and production of a majority of the Colombian coffee, considered by some as the best coffee in the world. There are three departments in the area: Caldas, Quind\u00edo and Risaralda. These departments are among the smallest departments in Colombia with a total combined area of 13873&nbsp;km\u00b2 (5356&nbsp;mi\u00b2), about 1.2% of the Colombian territory. The combined population is 2,291,195 (2005 census).<ref>[http://www.colombia.travel/en/mice/congresses-and-conventions/coffee-cultural-landscape/tours/national-coffee-park-in-montenegro Colombia Official Travel Guide]</ref>\n\n===Transportation and telecommunications===\nColombia's geography, with three cordilleras of the Andes running up the country from south to north, and jungle in the Amazon and Dari\u00e9n regions, represents a major obstacle to the development of national road networks with international connections. Thus, the basic nature of the country's transportation infrastructure is not surprising. In the spirit of the 1991 constitution, in 1993 the Ministry of Public\nWorks and Transportation was reorganized and renamed the Ministry of Transportation. In 2000 the new ministry strengthened its role as the planner and regulator within the sector.<ref name=\"lcweb2.loc.gov\">{{cite news|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/pdf/CS_Colombia.pdf|author=Roberto Steiner and Hern\u00e1n Vallejo|editor=Rex A. Hudson|title=Colombia: A Country Study|pages=181\u20134|publisher=Library of Congress Federal Research Division|date=2010}}</ref>\n\n====Air transportation====\nColombia was a pioneer in promoting airlines in an effort to overcome its geographic barriers to transportation. The Colombian Company of Air Navigation, formed in 1919, was the second commercial airline in the world. It was not until the 1940s that Colombia's air transportation began growing significantly in the number of companies, passengers carried, and kilometers covered. In the early 2000s, an average of 72 percent of the passengers transported by air go to national destinations, while 28 percent travel internationally. One notable feature is that after the reforms of the beginning of the 1990s, the number of international passengers tripled by 2003. In 1993 the construction, administration, operation, and maintenance of the main airports transferred to departmental authorities and the private sector, including companies specializing in air transportation. Within this process, in 2006 the International Airport Operator (Opain), a Swiss-Colombian consortium, won the concession to manage and develop Bogot\u00e1\u2019s [[El Dorado International Airport]]. El Dorado is the largest airport in Latin America in terms of cargo traffic (33rd worldwide), with 622,145 metric tons in 2013, second in terms of traffic movements (45th worldwide) and third in terms of passengers (50th among the busiest airports in the world). In addition to El Dorado, Colombia\u2019s international airports are Palo Negro in Bucaramanga, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar in Santa Marta, Cortissoz in Barranquilla, Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez in Cartagena, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova in Rionegro near Medell\u00edn, Alfonso Bonilla Arag\u00f3n in Cali, Alfredo V\u00e1squez Cobo in Leticia, Mateca\u00f1a in Pereira, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla in San Andr\u00e9s, and Camilo Daza in C\u00facuta. In 2006 Colombia was generally reported to have a total of 984 airports, of which 103 had paved runways and 883 were unpaved. The Ministry of Transportation listed 581 airports in 2007, but it may have used a different methodology for counting them.<ref name=\"lcweb2.loc.gov\" />\n\n====Poverty and inequality====\nAfter a large crisis in 1999, poverty in Colombia has had a decreasing trend. The share of Colombians below the income-based poverty line fell from 50% in 2002 to 28% in 2016. The share of Colombians below the extreme income-based poverty line fell from 18% to 9% in the same period. Multidimensional poverty fell from 30% to 18% between 2010 and 2016.<ref name=\"goo.gl/Vs8gki\"/>\n<ref>DANE (Pobreza Monetaria y Multidimensional en Colombia 2016: goo.gl/Vs8gki)</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Taxation in Colombia]]\n* [[WWB Colombia]]\n* [[Economic history of Colombia]]\n* [[List of companies of Colombia]]\n* [[Economy of South America]]\n* [[List of Colombian departments by GDP]]\n* [[List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP growth]]\n* [[List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP (nominal)]]\n* [[List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP (PPP)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}Reflist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.investincolombia.com.co/colombia-economy Colombia Economy report \u2013 Official Investment portal]\n\n{{Colombia topics|state=collapsed}}\n{{SACN}}\n{{South America in topic|Economy of}}\n{{World Trade Organization}}\n\n[[Category:World Trade Organization member economies|Colombia]]\n[[Category:Economy of Colombia| ]]\n[[Category:Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member economies]]", "sha1": "fldrdthmuptdex7jynbey0rs1vrh3nm"}}, {"title": "Communications in Colombia", "ns": "0", "id": "5840", "revision": {"id": "864397105", "parentid": "810277635", "timestamp": "2018-10-16T23:02:47Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "[[WP:GenFixes]] on, [[WP:AWB/T|typo(s) fixed]]: a\u2019s \u2192 a's (5)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Update|date=July 2013}}\nSince being liberalized in 1991, the '''[[Colombia]]n [[telecommunication]]s sector''' has added new services, expanded coverage, improved efficiency, and lowered costs. The sector has had the second largest (after energy) investment in infrastructure (54 percent) since 1997. However, the [[Economy of Colombia|economic downturn between 1999 and 2002]] adversely affected telecommunications. During this period, Colombia's telecommunications industry lost US$2 billion despite a profit of US$1 billion in local service. In June 2003, the government [[liquidation|liquidated]] the state-owned and heavily indebted National Telecommunications Company (Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones\u2014Telecom) and replaced it with Colombia Telecomunicaciones (Colombia Telecom). The measure enabled the industry to expand rapidly, and in 2004 it constituted 2.8 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). [[Telef\u00f3nica]] of Spain acquired 50 percent plus one share of the company in 2006.<ref name=cp>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Colombia.pdf Colombia country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (February 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref>\n\nAs a result of increasing competition, Colombia has a relatively modern telecommunications infrastructure that primarily serves larger towns and cities. Colombia's telecommunication system includes access to 8 different international [[Submarine communications cable|Submarine cable]] systems, [[INTELSAT]], 11 domestic satellite [[Earth station]]s, and a nationwide [[microwave radio relay]] system.<ref name=cp/>\n\n==Telephones==\nThe country's teledensity (the density of telephone lines in a community) is relatively high for [[Latin America]] (17 percent in 2006). However, there is a steep imbalance between rural and urban areas, with some regions below 10 percent and the big cities exceeding 30 percent. [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Medell\u00edn]], and [[Cali]] account for about 50 percent of telephone lines in use. By the end of 2005, the number of telephone main lines in use totaled 7,851,649. Colombia Telecom accounted for only about 31 percent of these lines; 27 other operators accounted for the rest.<ref name=cp/>\n\nColombia's [[mobile telephone|mobile]] market is one of the fastest-growing businesses in the country. In mid-2004 mobile telephones overtook fixed lines in service for the first time. By 2005 Colombia had the highest mobile phone density (90 percent) in Latin America, as compared with the region's average density of 70 percent. The number of mobile telephone subscribers totaled an estimated 31 million in 2007, as compared to 21.8 million in 2005 and 6.8 million in 2001.<ref name=cp/>\n\n==Radio and television==\n{{see also|Media of Colombia}}\nIn late 2004, [[Radio Televisi\u00f3n Nacional de Colombia]] (RTVC) replaced the liquidated [[Inravisi\u00f3n]] (Instituto Nacional de Radio y Televisi\u00f3n) as the government-run radio and television broadcasting service, which oversees three national television stations and five radio companies (which operate about a dozen principal networks). Colombia has about 60 television stations, including seven low-power stations. In 2000 the population had about 11.9 million television receivers in use. Of the approximately 515 radio stations, 454 are [[AM broadcasting|AM]]; 34, [[FM broadcasting|FM]]; and 27, [[shortwave]].<ref name=cp/>\n\n==Undersea Cables==\nAs of 2016, Colombia has access to the following international [[Submarine communications cable|Submarine cable]] systems: SAC/LAN, [[MAYA-1|Maya-1]], [[AMX-1]], [[PAN AM|Pan Am]], [[SAm-1]], [[ARCOS-1]], CFX-1, and PCCS. These cables land at 4 locations in the Caribbean: [[Barranquilla]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Riohacha]], and [[Tolu]]. One cable lands on the Pacific Ocean coast at [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca]].\n\n==Internet==\n{{main|Internet in Colombia}}\nColombia is still far behind [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], and [[Argentina]] in terms of online usage. It had an estimated total of 900,000 [[Internet]] subscribers by the end of 2005, a figure that equated to 4,739,000 Internet users, or 11.5 percent of the 2005 population (10.9 per 100 inhabitants). By late 2009 39% of households had internet access Colombia had 581,877 [[Internet host]]s in 2006. Although as many as 70 percent of Colombians accessed the Internet over their ordinary telephone lines, dial-up access is losing ground to [[Broadband Internet access|broadband]]. In 2005 Colombia had 345,000 broadband subscriber lines, or one per 100 inhabitants. In 2006 the number of [[personal computer]]s per 1,000 people increased to an estimated 87 per 1,000 inhabitants, a rate still below that in other large Latin American economies.<ref name=cp/>  The internet country code is [[.co]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [http://www.internetworldstats.com/list2.htm Internetworldstats.com]\n\n==External links==\n*{{es icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20060213194845/http://www.mincomunicaciones.gov.co/mincom/src/index.jsp Colombian Ministry of Communications]\n*{{es icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20071019003606/http://www.comunicate.com.co/COLDECON2.php Comunicate.com.co], Coldecon, Internet Provider\n\n{{South America in topic|Communications in}}\n{{Colombia topics|state=collapsed}}\n{{Internet in Colombia|state=collapsed}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Communications In Colombia}}\n[[Category:Communications in Colombia| ]]\n[[Category:Communications in South America|Colombia]]", "sha1": "cb9a7g49khusjnjxaoqp10uzfpm68hb"}}, {"title": "Transport in Colombia", "ns": "0", "id": "5841", "revision": {"id": "862129678", "parentid": "862077174", "timestamp": "2018-10-02T10:56:41Z", "contributor": {"username": "Pedro Felipe", "id": "4476391"}, "comment": "Undid revision 862077174 by [[Special:Contributions/181.136.177.114|181.136.177.114]] ([[User talk:181.136.177.114|talk]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[Image:Tunel de Occidente.jpg|thumb|right|T\u00fanel de Occidente in [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]].

[[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (February 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Indigenous peoples influence===\n[[Image:Muisca raft Legend of El Dorado Offerings of gold.jpg|thumb|right|[[Muisca people|Muisca]] culture golden raft]]\n\nThe [[indigenous peoples in Colombia]] used and some continue to use the water ways as the way of transportation using [[raft]]s and canoes.\n\n===Spanish influence===\nWith the arrival of the Europeans the [[Spanish people|Spaniards brought]] the [[horse]]s, mules and donkey (which developed into the ''[[Paso Fino]]'') used by them in [[ranching]] duties later in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. Horses contributed greatly to the transport of the Spanish conquerors and colonizers. They also introduced the wheel, and brought wooden carts and carriages to facilitate their transport. The Spaniards also developed the first roads, rudimentary and most of these in the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean region]]. Due to the rough [[Geography of Colombia|terrain of Colombia]] communications between regions was difficult and affected the effectiveness of the central government creating isolation in some regions. Maritime navigation developed locally after Spain lifted its restrictions on ports within the [[Spanish Empire]] inducing mercantilism. Spanish also transported African slaves and forcedly migrated many indigenous tribes throughout Colombia.\n\n===Post-independence===\nWith the independence and the influences of the European [[Industrial Revolution]] the main way of transport in Colombia became the navigation mainly through the [[Magdalena River]] which connected Honda in inland Colombia, with [[Barranquilla]] by the [[Caribbean sea]] to the trade with the United States and Europe. This also brought a large wave of immigrants from European and Middle Eastern countries. The industrialization process and transportation in Colombia were affected by the internal civil wars that surged after the independence from Spain and that continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n===Standardization===\nDuring the late 19th century European and American companies introduced railways to carry to the ports the local production of raw materials intended for exports and also imports from Europe. [[Steam ships]] began carrying Colombians, immigrants and goods from Europe and the United States over the [[Magdalena River]].\n\n[[Image:IMG 0639.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pumarejo bridge]] in [[Barranquilla]]. The bridge serves to cross the [[Magdalena River]] between the [[Departments of Colombia|Departments]] of [[Atl\u00e1ntico Department|Atl\u00e1ntico]] and [[Magdalena Department|Magdalena]]. It is also one of the oldest standing bridges in Colombia.]]\n\nThe Ministry of Transport was created in 1905 during the Presidency of [[Rafael Reyes]] under the name of '' Ministerio de Obras P\u00fablicas y Transporte'' or Ministry of Public Works and Transport with the main function of taking care of national assets issues, including mines, oil (fuel), patents and trade marks, railways, roads, bridges, national buildings and land without landowners.\n\nIn the early 20th century roads and highways maintenance and construction regulations were established. Rivers were cleaned, dragged and channeled and the navigational industry was organized. The Public works districts were created, as well as the [[Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Colombia]] (National Railways of Colombia). Among other major projects developed were the aqueduct of [[Bogot\u00e1]], La Regadera Dam and the Vitelma Water Treatment Plant. The Ministry also created the [[National Institute of Transit]] (from the Spanish ''Instituto Nacional de Tr\u00e1nsito''), (INTRA) under the Transport and tariffs Directorate and was in charge of designing the first National roads plan with the support of many foreign multinational construction companies.\n\nAviation was born in [[Barranquilla]] with the creation of [[SCADTA]] in 1919 a joint venture between Colombians and Germans that delivered mail to the main cities of Colombia which later merged with [[SACO (Colombia)|SACO]] to form [[Avianca]].\n\n==Infrastructure==\n===Railways===\n{{main|Rail transport in Colombia}}\n[[File:Mapa de Colombia (ferrocarriles).svg|thumb|200px|Railroads of Colombia]]\n\nColombia has {{convert|3,034|km|mi|sp=us}} of rail lines, {{convert|150|km|mi|sp=us}} of which are {{RailGauge|1435mm}} gauge and {{convert|3,154|km|mi|sp=us}} of which are {{RailGauge|914mm}} gauge. However, only {{convert|2,611|km|mi|sp=us}} of lines are still in use. Rail transport in Colombia remains underdeveloped. The national railroad system, once the country's main mode of transport for freight, has been neglected in favor of road development and now accounts for only about a quarter of freight transport. Passenger-rail use was suspended in 1992 resumed at the end of the 1990s, and as of 2017 it is considered abandoned (at least for long distances).<ref>Champin, J., Cort\u00e9s, R., Kohon, J., & Rodr\u00edguez, M. (2016). Desaf\u00edos del transporte ferroviario de carga en Colombia, p. 35</ref>   Fewer than 165,000 passenger journeys were made in 1999, as compared with more than 5 million in 1972, and the figure was only 160,130 in 2005. The two still-functioning passenger trains are: one between Puerto Berr\u00edo and Garc\u00eda Cadena, and another one between Bogot\u00e1 and Zipaquir\u00e1.<ref>Champin, J., Cort\u00e9s, R., Kohon, J., & Rodr\u00edguez, M. (2016). Desaf\u00edos del transporte ferroviario de carga en Colombia, p. 35</ref>   Short sections of railroad, mainly the Bogot\u00e1-Atlantic rim, are used to haul goods, mostly coal, to the Caribbean and Pacific ports. In 2005 a total of 27.5 million metric tons of cargo were transported by rail. Although the nation's rail network links seven of the country's 10 major cities, very little of it has been used regularly because of security concerns, lack of maintenance, and the power of the road transport union. During 2004\u20136, approximately 2,000 kilometers of the country's rail lines underwent refurbishment. This upgrade involved two main projects: the 1,484-kilometer line linking Bogot\u00e1 to the Caribbean Coast and the 499-kilometer Pacific coastal network that links the industrial city of [[Cali]] and the surrounding [[Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis|coffee-growing region]] to the port of [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]].<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Roads===\n{{See also|Highways in Colombia}}\n[[File:Mapa de Colombia (red vial).svg|thumb|200px|Main roads in Colombia]]\n\nThe three main north-south highways are the Caribbean, Eastern, and Central Trunk Highways (troncales). Estimates of the length of Colombia's road system in 2004 ranged from 115,000 kilometers to 145,000 kilometers, of which fewer than 15 percent were paved. However, according to 2005 data reported by the Colombian government, the road network totaled 163,000 kilometers, 68 percent of which were paved and in good condition. The increase may reflect some newly built roads. President Uribe has vowed to pave more than 2,500 kilometers of roads during his administration, and about 5,000 kilometers of new secondary roads were being built in the 2003\u20136 period. Despite serious terrain obstacles, almost three-quarters of all cross-border dry cargo is now transported by road, 105,251 metric tons in 2005.<ref name=cp/>\n\nHighways are managed by the [[Ministry of Transport (Colombia)|Colombian Ministry of Transport]] through the [[National Roads Institute]]. The security of the highways in Colombia is managed by the [[Highway Police (Colombia)|Highway Police]] unit of the [[Colombian National Police]]. Colombia is crossed by the [[Panamerican Highway]].\n\n===Ports, waterways, and merchant marine===\n[[File:Mapa_de_Colombia_(r\u00edos).svg|thumb|200px|Rivers of Colombia]]\n\nSeaports handle around 80 percent of international cargo. In 2005 a total of 105,251 metric tons of cargo were transported by water. Colombia's most important ocean terminals are [[Barranquilla]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], and [[Santa Marta]] on the Caribbean Coast and [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]] and [[Tumaco]] on the Pacific Coast. Exports mostly pass through the Caribbean ports of Cartagena and Santa Marta, while 65 percent of imports arrive at the port of Buenaventura. Other important ports and harbors are Bah\u00eda de Portete, [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]], Puerto Bol\u00edvar, [[Archipelago of San Andr\u00e9s, Providencia and Santa Catalina|San Andr\u00e9s]], Santa Marta, and [[Turbo, Colombia|Turbo]]. Since privatization was implemented in 1993, the efficiency of port handling has increased greatly. Privatization, however, has had negative impacts as well. In Buenaventura, for example, privatization of the harbor has increased unemployment and social issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/nacional/buenaventura-un-puerto-sin-comunidad-articulo-563958|title=Buenaventura: un puerto sin comunidad|last=|first=|date=1 June 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=27 May 2016}}</ref> There are plans to construct a deep-water port at Bah\u00eda Solano.<ref name=cp/>\n\nThe main inland waterways total about 18,200 kilometers, 11,000 kilometers of which are navigable by riverboats. A well-developed and important form of transport for both cargo and passengers, inland waterways transport approximately 3.8 million metric tons of freight and more than 5.5 million passengers annually. Main inland waterways are the Magdalena\u2013Cauca River system, which is navigable for 1,500 kilometers; the Atrato, which is navigable for 687 kilometers; the Orinoco system of more than five navigable rivers, which total more than 4,000 kilometers of potential navigation (mainly through Venezuela); and the Amazonas system, which has four main rivers totaling 3,000 navigable kilometers (mainly through Brazil). The government is planning an ambitious program to more fully utilize the main rivers for transport. In addition, the navy's riverine brigade has been patrolling waterways more aggressively in order to establish safer river transport in the more remote areas in the south and east of the country. <ref name=cp/>\n\nThe merchant marine totals 17 ships (1,000 gross registered tons or more), including four bulk, 13 cargo, one container, one liquefied gas, and three petroleum tanker ships. Colombia also has seven ships registered in other countries (Antigua and Barbuda, two; Panama, five).<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Civil Aviation===\n{{See also|List of airports in Colombia}}\n[[file:2017 Aeropuerto El Dorado de Bogot\u00e1 - Veh\u00edculos en el muelle nacional.jpg|180px|thumb|Vehicles on the [[El Dorado Airport]] platform]]\n[[File:2018 taxis en el Aeropuerto Olaya Herrera de Medell\u00edn.jpg|thumb|[[Olaya Herrera Airport]] of [[Medell\u00edn]]]]\nThe [[Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics]] is responsible of regulating and controlling the use of air space by civil aviation. The customs/immigration issues are controlled by the [[Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad]] (DAS).\n\nColombia has well-developed air routes and an estimated total of 984 airports, 100 of which have paved runways, plus two heliports. Of the 74 main airports, 20 can accommodate jet aircraft. Two airports are more than 3,047 meters in length, nine are 2,438\u20133,047 meters, 39 are 1,524\u20132,437 meters, 38 are 914\u20131,523 meters, 12 are shorter than 914 meters, and 880 have unpaved runways. The government has been selling its stake in local airports in order to allow their privatization. The country has 40 regional airports, and the cities of Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn, Cali, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, C\u00facuta, Leticia, Pereira, San Andr\u00e9s, and Santa Marta have international airports. Bogot\u00e1's El Dorado International Airport handles 550 million metric tons of cargo and 22 million passengers a year, making it the largest airport in Latin America in terms of cargo and the third largest in passenger numbers.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Urban transport===\n\nUrban transport systems have been developed in Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn, Cali and Barranquilla. Traffic congestion in Bogot\u00e1 has been greatly exacerbated by the lack of rail transport. However, this problem has been alleviated somewhat by the development of one of the world's largest and highest capacity [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) systems, known as the [[TransMilenio]] (opened 2000), and the restriction of vehicles through a daily, [[Pico y placa|rotating ban]] on private cars depending on plate numbers. Bogot\u00e1's system consists of bus and minibus services managed by both private- and public-sector enterprises. Since 1995 Medell\u00edn has had a modern urban railway referred to as the [[Metro de Medell\u00edn]], which also connects with the cities of Itag\u00fc\u00ed, Envigado, and Bello. An elevated cable car system, [[Metrocable (Medellin)|Metrocable]], was added in 2004 to link some of Medell\u00edn's poorer mountainous neighborhoods with the Metro de Medell\u00edn. A [[Bus rapid transit|BRT]] line called Transmetro began operating in 2011, with a second line added in 2013.  Other cities have also installed BRT systems such as [[Masivo Integrado de Occidente|Cali]] with a six line system (opened 2008), [[Barranquilla's Transmetro|Barranquilla]] with two lines (opened 2010), [[Metrolinea|Bucaramanga]] with one line (opened 2010), [[Transcaribe|Cartagena]] with one line (opened 2015) and [[Megab\u00fas|Pereira]] with three lines (opened 2006).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brtdata.org/#/location/latin_america/colombia/|title=Global BRT Data|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=cp/>\n\n===Pipelines===\nColombia has 4,350 kilometers of gas pipelines, 6,134 kilometers of oil pipelines, and 3,140 kilometers of refined-products pipelines. The country has five major oil pipelines, four of which connect with the Caribbean export terminal at Puerto Cove\u00f1as. Until at least September 2005, the United States funded efforts to help protect a major pipeline, the 769-kilometer-long Ca\u00f1o Lim\u00f3n\u2013Puerto Cove\u00f1as pipeline, which carries about 20 percent of Colombia's oil production to Puerto Cove\u00f1as from the guerrilla-infested Arauca region in the eastern Andean foothills and Amazonian jungle. The number of attacks against pipelines began declining substantially in 2002. In 2004 there were only 17 attacks against the Ca\u00f1o Lim\u00f3n\u2013Puerto Cove\u00f1as pipeline, down from 170 in 2001. However, a bombing in February 2005 shut the pipeline for several weeks, and attacks against the electrical gird system that provides energy to the Ca\u00f1o Lim\u00f3n oilfield have continued.

The Colombian military is the second largest in the [[Western Hemisphere]] in terms of active personnel, behind the [[United States Armed Forces]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.globalfirepower.com/active-military-manpower.asp|title=Total Available Active Military Manpower by Country|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-US}}</ref> The [[President of Colombia]] is the military's commander in chief, and helps formulate defence policy through the [[Ministry of National Defense (Colombia)|Ministry of National Defence]] (MinDefensa), which is in charge of day-to-day operations.  The Colombian military consists of the [[National Army of Colombia]], [[Colombian Navy]], [[Colombian Air Force]] and the [[Colombian Naval Infantry]]. Although the [[National Police of Colombia]] is technically not part of the military, it is controlled and administered by the Ministry of Defense, and has a highly militarized structure not found in most of the world's law enforcement agencies, such as a distinction between [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]] and [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] ranks, and the regular use of heavy military equipment. Colombian citizens presenting themselves for [[conscription]] may also join the National Police instead of the other armed forces. This makes the National Police a [[de facto]] branch of the military.\n\nThe Colombian military has its roots in the independence war against the [[Spanish Empire]]. After their triumph against the Spanish, the [[Congress of Angostura]] created the [[Greater Colombia]]n Army, to replace the disbanded Commoners Army. The Colombian military was operationally involved in [[Colombia during World War II|World War II]] and was the only Latin American country to send troops to the [[Korean War]]. The Colombian Army has been the main military branch involved in the [[Colombian conflict]]. The military of Colombia has the third largest expenditure in the [[Americas]], after the United States and Brazil respectively.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.globalfirepower.com/defense-spending-budget.asp|title=Defense Spending by Country|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-US}}</ref> Recently it has participated in counter-piracy efforts in the [[Horn of Africa]] under [[Operation Ocean Shield]] and [[Operation Atlanta]].\n\n==Services==\nThe [[Colombian Constitution of 1991|Colombian Constitution]] ({{lang-es|Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica de Colombia}}) includes two overlapping definitions of what could be defined as 'armed forces' in English:\n* Public Forces ({{lang-es|Fuerza P\u00fablica}}): Includes the Military Forces proper '''and''' the National Police (Title VII, chapter VII, Art. 216)\n* Military Forces ({{lang-es|Fuerzas Militares}}): Includes only the 3 major military services: Army, Navy and Air Force (Title VII, chapter VII, Art. 217)\n\nThis is a subtle yet important distinction, both in terms of emphasizing the civil nature of the National Police, but also adapting the national police to function as a paramilitary force which can perform military duties as a result of the [[Colombian Conflict]]. This has led to some of the most important police units adopting military training and conducting special operations alongside the Colombian Army, Air Force and Navy. Therefore, the functions of the Colombian Police in practical terms similar to those of the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Spanish Civil Guard]] and the [[Carabineros de Chile]], which maintain military ranks for all police personnel.\n\n==Personnel==\n\nThe Colombian armed forces consist of: <br/>\nMilitary Forces:\n* [[Colombian Army]] ({{lang-es|Ej\u00e9rcito Nacional de Colombia}})\n* [[Colombian Navy]] ({{lang-es|Armada Nacional de Colombia}}) - and attached services [[Colombian Naval Infantry|Marines]] and Coast Guard\n* [[Colombian Air Force]] ({{lang-es|Fuerza A\u00e9rea Colombiana}})\nAnd, \n* [[National Police of Colombia]] ({{lang-es|Polic\u00eda Nacional de Colombia}})\n\nPublic Force strength as of April 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevosiglo.com.co/articulos/4-2014-pie-de-fuerza-aumento-en-42-mil-efectivos|title=Pie de fuerza aument\u00f3 en 42 mil efectivos - El Nuevo Siglo Bogot\u00e1|author=|date=|website=www.elnuevosiglo.com.co|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"min-width:50%;\"<!-- border: 2px solid black; \" -->\n|- style=\"background-color:#CCCCCC;  align:wrap\"\n|'''Force'''||'''Service'''\n|'''Officers'''||'''Total'''\n|-\n|Military||{{flagicon image|Escudo Ejercito Nacional de Colombia.svg}} [[Colombian Army]]\n|10,094||246,325\n|-\n|Military||{{flagicon image|Escudo Armada Nacional de Colombia.svg}} [[Colombian Navy]]\n|2.481||33,824\n|-\n|Military||{{flagicon image|Escudo Fuerza Aerea Colombiana.svg}} [[Colombian Air Force]]\n|2.679||13,928\n|-\n|Public||{{flagicon image|Coat of arms of colombian national police.svg}} [[Colombian National Police]]\n|6.924||176,557\n|- style=\"background-color:#CCCCCC; font-weight:bold; align=:left\"\n| colspan=\"2\" |Total\n|22,178||470, 634\n|}\nMilitary strength \n</center>\n\n===Dependencies===\n* Military Medical Corps ('{{lang|es|Sanidad Militar}}') - Medical and Nurse Corps\n* [[Indumil]] ({{lang|es|Industrias Militares - INDUMIL}}) - Military Industry Depot\n* Military Sports Federation ({{lang|es|Federaci\u00f3n Deportiva Militar - FEDECODEMIL}})\n* Military Printing ({{lang|es|Imprenta Militar}})\n* Military Museum ({{lang|es|Museo Militar}}) - History of the Armed Forces of Colombia\n* Superior War College ([[Escuela Superior de Guerra (Colombia)]] ESDEGUE)\n\n==Funding==\nIn 2000, Colombia assigned 3.9% of its GDP to defense.<ref>{{cite web|title=C\u00e1lculo del Gasto en Defensa y Seguridad  \u2013 GDS|url=https://www.mindefensa.gov.co/irj/go/km/docs/Mindefensa/Documentos/descargas2/anexos/9101_Nota_de_investigacion_01_Calculo_GDS.pdf|website=Ministerio de Defensa Nacional|publisher=Ministerio de Defensa de Colombia|accessdate=19 August 2016}}</ref> By 2008 this figure had risen to 4.8%, ranking it 14th in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Military expenditure (% of GDP)|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS?end=2008&start=1995&year_high_desc=true|website=The World Bank|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=19 August 2016}}</ref> The armed forces number about 250,000 uniformed personnel: 145,000 military and 105,000 police.

When the Spanish arrived in 1509, they found a flourishing and heterogeneous [[Amerindian]] population that numbered between 1.5 million and 2 million, belonged to several hundred tribes, and largely spoke mutually unintelligible dialects. The two most advanced cultures of Amerindian peoples at the time were the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] and [[Taironas]], who belonged to the Chibcha group and were skilled in farming, mining, and metalcraft. The Muisca lived mainly in the present departments of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] and [[Boyac\u00e1 Department|Boyac\u00e1]], where they had fled centuries earlier after raids by the warlike Caribs, some of whom eventually migrated to Caribbean islands near the end of the first millennium. The Taironas, who were divided into two subgroups, lived in the Caribbean lowlands and the highlands of the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]]. The Muisca civilization was well organized into distinct provinces governed by communal land laws and powerful [[caciques]], who reported to one of the two supreme leaders.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe territory that became Colombia was first visited by Europeans when the first expedition of [[Alonso de Ojeda]] arrived at the [[Cabo de la Vela]] in 1499. The [[Spain|Spanish]] made several attempts to settle along the north coast of today's Colombia in the early 16th century, but their first permanent settlement, at [[Santa Marta]], was not established until 1525. [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] was founded on June 1, 1533, by Spanish commander Pedro de Heredia, in the former location of the indigenous Caribbean Calamar\u00ed village. Cartagena grew rapidly, fueled first by the gold in the tombs of the [[Zen\u00fa|Sin\u00fa]] Culture, and later by trade. The thirst for gold and land resulted in Spanish explorers to visit Chibchan speaking areas; resulting in the [[Spanish conquest of the Chibchan Nations]] refers to the [[conquest (military)|conquest]] by the [[Spanish monarchy]] of the [[Chibcha language]]-speaking nations, mainly the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] and [[Tairona]] that inhabited present-day [[Colombia]], beginning the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]].<ref name=EREMITE>[http://www.eremite.demon.co.uk/Tairona/1pages/seca/a2tsatconq.html Tairona Heritage Trust: Tairona history to the time of the Spanish Invasion] Tairona Heritage Trust Accessed 21 August 2007.</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = QUEMUENCHATOCHA.jpg\n| width1 = 143\n| alt1 = Quemuenchatocha\n| link1 = Quemuenchatocha\n| caption1  = <center>'''[[Quemuenchatocha]]'''<br><small>(\u2020 1537)</small></center>\n| image2 = AQUIMINZAQUE.jpg\n| width2 = 140\n| alt2 = Aquiminzaque\n| link2 = Aquiminzaque\n| caption2 = <center>'''[[Aquiminzaque]]'''<br><small>(\u2020 1539)</small></center>\n| footer = <center>'''Aquiminzaque''', as successor of '''Quemuenchatocha''', defeated in his home in [[Tunja|Hunza]], on August 20, 1537, was the last souvereign ruler of the Muisca and was decapitated by the Spanish, as would happen to [[T\u00fapac Amaru]] of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]], 34 years later.</center>\n}}\nThe Spanish advance inland from the Caribbean coast began independently from three different directions, under [[Jimen\u00e9z de Ques\u00e1da]], [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Benalc\u00e1zar]] (known in Colombia as Belalc\u00e1zar) and [[Nikolaus Federmann]].

The Viceroyalty had Santa F\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1 as its capital.

Bol\u00edvar's supporters, who later formed the nucleus of the Conservative Party, sought strong centralized government, alliance with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and a limited franchise. Santander's followers, forerunners of the Liberals, wanted a decentralized government, state rather than church control over education and other civil matters, and a broadened suffrage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThroughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, each party held the presidency for roughly equal periods of time. Colombia maintained a tradition of civilian government and regular, free elections. The military has seized power three times in Colombia's history: in 1830, after the dissolution of Great Colombia; again in 1854 (by General [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Melo]]); and from 1953 to 1957 (under General [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]]). Civilian rule was restored within one year in the first two instances.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nNot withstanding the country's commitment to democratic institutions, Colombia's history has also been characterized by widespread, violent conflict. Two civil wars resulted from bitter rivalry between the Conservative and Liberal parties. The [[Thousand Days' War]] (1899\u20131902) cost an estimated 100,000 lives, and up to 300,000 people died during \"[[La Violencia]]\" of the late 1940s and 1950s, a bipartisan confrontation which erupted after the assassination of Liberal popular candidate [[Jorge Eli\u00e9cer Gait\u00e1n]]. [[United States]] activity to influence the area (especially the [[Panama Canal]] construction and control) led to a military uprising in the [[Isthmus Department]] in 1903, which resulted in the [[Panama\u2013Colombia separation|separation]] and independence of [[Panama]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nA military coup in 1953 toppled the right-wing government of Conservative [[Laureano G\u00f3mez]] and brought General [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]] to power. Initially, Rojas enjoyed considerable popular support, due largely to his success in reducing \"[[La Violencia]]\". When he did not restore democratic rule and occasionally engaged in open repression, however, he was overthrown by the military in 1957 with the backing of both political parties, and a provisional government was installed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n== The National Front regime (1958\u20131974) ==\n{{Main article|National Front (Colombia)}}\nIn July 1957, former Conservative President Laureano G\u00f3mez (1950\u20131953) and former Liberal President [[Alberto Lleras Camargo|Alberto Lleras]] (1945\u20131946, 1958\u20131962) issued the \"Declaration of Sitges,\" in which they proposed a \"National Front,\" whereby the Liberal and Conservative parties would govern jointly. The presidency would be determined by an alternating conservative and liberal president every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe National Front ended \"[[La Violencia]]\", and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the Alliance for Progress. In particular, the Liberal president [[Alberto Lleras Camargo]] (1958\u20131962) created the [[Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform]] (INCORA), and [[Carlos Lleras Restrepo]] (1966\u20131970) further developed land entitlement. In 1968 and 1969 alone, the INCORA issued more than 60,000 land titles to farmers and workers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn the end, the contradictions between each successive Liberal and Conservative administration made the results decidedly mixed. Despite the progress in certain sectors, many social and political injustices continued.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe National Front system itself eventually began to be seen as a form of political repression by dissidents and even many mainstream voters, especially after what was apparently later confirmed as the fraudulent election of [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservative]] candidate [[Misael Pastrana Borrero|Misael Pastrana]] in 1970, which resulted in the defeat of the relatively populist candidate [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]]. The [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] guerrilla movement, \"Movimiento 19 de Abril\" (19 April Movement), would eventually be founded in part as a response to this particular event. The [[FARC]] was formed in 1964 by [[Manuel Marulanda V\u00e9lez]] and other Marxist\u2013Leninist supporters, after a military attack on the community of [[Marquetalia, Caldas|Marquetalia]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAlthough the system established by the Sitges agreement was phased out by 1974, the 1886 Colombian constitution \u2014 in effect until 1991\u2014required that the losing political party be given adequate and equitable participation in the government which, according to many observers and later analysis, eventually resulted in some increase in corruption and legal relaxation. The current 1991 constitution does not have that requirement, but subsequent administrations have tended to include members of opposition parties.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n== Post-National Front ==\nFrom 1974 until 1982, different presidential administrations chose to focus on ending the persistent [[Insurgency|insurgencies]] that sought to undermine Colombia's traditional political system. Both groups claimed to represent the poor and weak against the rich and powerful classes of the country, demanding the completion of true land and political reform, from an openly [[Communist]] perspective.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nBy 1974, another challenge to the state's authority and legitimacy had come from [[19th of April Movement]] (M-19), a mostly urban guerrilla group founded in response to an alleged electoral fraud during the final National Front election of [[Misael Pastrana Borrero|Misael Pastrana]] (1970\u20131974) and the defeat of former dictator [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]].<ref name=pedraja>{{cite book|last1=Ren\u00e9 De La Pedraja|title=Wars of Latin America, 1948\u20131982: The Rise of the Guerrillas|date=2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476602936|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-FChAqNQgjwC&lpg=PA223&dq=m-19%20gustavo%20rojas&pg=PA223#v=onepage&q=m-19%20gustavo%20rojas&f=false|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref> Initially, the M-19 attracted a degree of attention and sympathy from mainstream Colombians that the [[FARC]] and [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|National Liberation Army (ELN)]] had found largely elusive earlier due to extravagant and daring operations, such as stealing a sword that had belonged to Colombia's Independence hero [[Simon Bol\u00edvar]]. At the same time, its larger profile soon made it the focus of the state's counterinsurgency efforts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe ELN guerrilla had been seriously crippled by military operations in the region of Anor\u00ed by 1974, but it managed to reconstitute itself and escape destruction, in part due to the administration of [[Alfonso L\u00f3pez Michelsen]] (1974\u20131978) allowing it to escape encirclement, hoping to initiate a peace process with the group.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nBy 1982, the perceived passivity of the [[FARC]], together with the relative success of the government's efforts against the M-19 and ELN, enabled the administration of the Liberal Party's [[Julio C\u00e9sar Turbay Ayala|Julio C\u00e9sar Turbay]] (1978\u20131982) to lift a state-of-siege decree that had been in effect, on and off, for most of the previous 30 years. Under the latest such decree, president Turbay had implemented security policies that, though of some military value against the M-19 in particular, were considered highly questionable both inside and outside Colombian circles due to numerous accusations of military [[human rights abuse]]s against suspects and captured guerrillas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nCitizen exhaustion due to the conflict's newfound intensity led to the election of president [[Belisario Betancur]] (1982\u20131986), a Conservative who won 47% of the popular vote, directed peace feelers at all the insurgents, and negotiated a 1984 cease-fire with the FARC and M-19 after a 1982 release of many guerrillas imprisoned during the previous effort to overpower them. The ELN rejected entering any negotiation and continued to recover itself through the use of extortions and threats, in particular against foreign oil companies of European and U.S. origin.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n[[File:Death of Pablo Escobar.jpg|thumb|250px|Colombian drug lord [[Pablo Escobar]], December 2, 1993.]]\nAs these events were developing, the growing [[illegal drug trade]] and its consequences were also increasingly becoming a matter of widespread importance to all participants in the Colombian conflict. Guerrillas and newly wealthy drug lords had mutually uneven relations and thus numerous incidents occurred between them. Eventually, the kidnapping of drug cartel family members by guerrillas led to the creation of the 1981 ''Muerte a Secuestradores'' (MAS) death squad (\"Death to Kidnappers\"). Pressure from the U.S. government and critical sectors of Colombian society was met with further violence, as the [[Medell\u00edn Cartel]] and its hitmen, bribed or murdered numerous public officials, politicians and others who stood in its way by supporting the implementation of [[extradition]] of Colombian nationals to the U.S. Victims of cartel violence. This included Justice Minister [[Rodrigo Lara Bonilla|Rodrigo Lara]], whose assassination in 1984 made the Betancur administration begin to directly oppose the drug lords.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe first negotiated cease-fire with the M-19 ended when the guerrillas resumed fighting in 1985, claiming that the cease-fire had not been fully respected by official security forces, saying that several of its members had suffered threats and assaults, and also questioning the government's real willingness to implement any accords. The Betancur administration, in turn, questioned the M-19's actions and its commitment to the peace process, as it continued to advance high-profile negotiations with the FARC, which led to the creation of the [[Patriotic Union (Colombia)]] (UP), a legal and non-clandestine political organization.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn November 6, 1985, the M-19 [[Palace of Justice siege|stormed the Colombian Palace of Justice]] and held the Supreme Court magistrates hostage, intending to put president Betancur on trial. In the ensuing crossfire that followed the military's reaction, scores of people lost their lives, as did most of the guerrillas, including several high-ranking operatives. Both sides blamed each other for the outcome.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nMeanwhile, individual FARC members initially joined the UP leadership in representation of the guerrilla command, though most of the guerrilla's chiefs and militiamen did not demobilize nor disarm, as that was not a requirement of the process at that point in time. Tension soon significantly increased, as both sides began to accuse each other of not respecting the cease-fire. Political violence against FARC and UP members (including presidential candidate [[Jaime Pardo Leal|Jaime Pardo]]) was blamed on drug lords and also on members of the security forces (to a much lesser degree on the argued inaction of Betancur administration). Members of the government and security authorities increasingly accused the FARC of continuing to recruit guerrillas, as well as kidnapping, extorting and politically intimidating voters even as the UP was already participating in politics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe [[Virgilio Barco Vargas|Virgilio Barco]] (1986\u20131990) administration, in addition to continuing to handle the difficulties of the complex negotiations with the guerrillas, also inherited a particularly chaotic confrontation against the drug lords, who were engaged in a campaign of [[terrorism]] and murder in response to government moves in favor of their extradition overseas. The UP also suffered an increasing number of losses during this term (including the assassination of presidential candidate [[Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa|Bernardo Jaramillo]]), which stemmed both from private proto-[[paramilitary]] organizations, increasingly powerful drug lords and a number of would-be paramilitary-sympathizers within the armed forces.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n== Post-1990 ==\nFollowing administrations had to contend with the guerrillas, paramilitaries, narcotics traffickers and the violence and corruption that they all perpetuated, both through force and negotiation. Narcoterrorists assassinated three presidential candidates before [[C\u00e9sar Gaviria Trujillo|C\u00e9sar Gaviria]] was elected in 1990. Since the death of [[Medell\u00edn]] cartel leader [[Pablo Escobar]] in a police shootout during December 1993, indiscriminate acts of violence associated with that organization have abated as the \"cartels\" have broken up into multiple, smaller and often-competing trafficking organizations. Nevertheless, violence continues as these drug organizations resort to violence as part of their operations but also to protest government policies, including extradition.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe M-19 and several smaller guerrilla groups were successfully incorporated into a peace process as the 1980s ended and the 1990s began, which culminated in the elections for a [[Constituent Assembly of Colombia]] that would write a new constitution, which took effect in 1991. The new Constitution, brought about a considerable number of institutional and legal reforms based on principles that the delegates considered as more modern, humanist, democratic and politically open than those in the 1886 constitution. Practical results were mixed and mingled emerged (such as the debate surrounding the constitutional prohibition of extradition, which later was reversed), but together with the reincorporation of some of the guerrilla groups to the legal political framework, the new Constitution inaugurated an era that was both a continuation and a gradual, but significant, departure from what had come before.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=400|caption_align=center\n| image1 = Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) insurgents.GIF|caption1=[[FARC]] insurgents in 1998.\n| image2 = FARC guerrillas marching during the Caguan peace talks (1998-2002).jpg|caption2=FARC guerrillas marching in formation during the Caguan peace talks (1998\u20132002).\n}}\nContacts with the FARC, which had irregularly continued despite the generalized [[de facto]] interruptions of the ceasefire and the official 1987 break from negotiations, were temporarily cut off in 1990 under the presidency of [[C\u00e9sar Gaviria Trujillo|C\u00e9sar Gaviria]] (1990\u20131994). The Colombian Army's assault on the FARC's ''Casa Verde'' sanctuary at [[La Uribe]], [[Meta Department|Meta]], followed by a FARC offensive that sought to undermine the deliberations of the Constitutional Assembly, began to highlight a significant break in the uneven negotiations carried over from the previous decade.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nPresident [[Ernesto Samper Pizano|Ernesto Samper]] assumed office in August 1994. However, a political crisis relating to large-scale contributions from drug traffickers to Samper's presidential campaign diverted attention from governance programs, thus slowing, and in many cases, halting progress on the nation's domestic reform agenda. The military also suffered several setbacks in its fight against the guerrillas, when several of its rural bases began to be overrun and a record number of soldiers and officers were taken prisoner by the FARC (which since 1982 was attempting to implement a more \"conventional\" style of warfare, seeking to eventually defeat the military in the field).{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn August 7, 1998, [[Andr\u00e9s Pastrana Arango|Andr\u00e9s Pastrana]] was sworn in as the President of Colombia. A member of the Conservative Party, Pastrana defeated Liberal Party candidate Horacio Serpa in a run-off election marked by high voter turnout and little political unrest. The new president's program was based on a commitment to bring about a peaceful resolution of Colombia's longstanding civil conflict and to cooperate fully with the United States to combat the trafficking of illegal drugs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nWhile early initiatives in the Colombian peace process gave reason for optimism, the Pastrana administration also has had to combat high unemployment and other economic problems, such as the fiscal deficit and the impact of global financial instability on Colombia. During his administration, unemployment has risen to over 20%. Additionally, the growing severity of countrywide guerrilla attacks by the FARC and ELN, and smaller movements, as well as the growth of drug production, corruption and the spread of even more violent paramilitary groups such as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia ([[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]]) has made it difficult to solve the country's problems.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAlthough the FARC and ELN accepted participation in the peace process, they did not make explicit commitments to end the conflict. The FARC suspended talks in November 2000, to protest what it called \"paramilitary terrorism\" but returned to the negotiating table in February 2001, following 2 days of meetings between President Pastrana and FARC leader Manuel Marulanda. The Colombian Government and ELN in early 2001 continued discussions aimed at opening a formal peace process.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n== Recent developments ==\n[[File:Marchapaz.jpg|thumb|Colombia's peace protests, 2007.]]\nBy 2004, the security situation of Colombia had shown some measure of an improvement and the economy, while still fragile, had also shown some positive signs. On the other hand, relatively little had been accomplished in structurally solving most of the country's other grave problems, in part due to legislative and political conflicts between the administration and the Colombian Congress (including those over the controversial 2006 project to give President [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe]] the right to be re-elected), and a relative lack of freely allocated funds and credits.\n\nSome critical observers consider in retrospect that Uribe's policies, while admittedly reducing crime and guerrilla activity, were too slanted in favor of a military solution to Colombia's internal war, neglecting grave social and human rights concerns to a certain extent. They hoped that Uribe's government would make serious efforts towards improving the human rights situation inside the country, protecting civilians and reducing any abuses committed by the armed forces.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nUribe's supporters in turn believed that increased military action was a necessary prelude to any serious negotiation attempt with the guerrillas and that the increased security situation would help the government, in the long term, to focus more actively on reducing most wide-scale abuses and human rights violations on the part of both the armed groups and any rogue security forces that might have links to the paramilitaries. In short, these supporters maintained that the security situation needed to be stabilized in favor of the government before any other social concerns could take precedence. Uribe left the presidency in 2010. \n\n{{Multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | image1 = Carro bomba Caracol Radio 20100812.jpg\n | caption1 = On 12 August 2010, terrorist attack by the FARC with a car bomb at the headquarters of [[Caracol Radio]].

But two years after winning the presidential election, Santos (to widespread surprise) began peace talks with FARC, which took place in Havana. Re-elected in 2014, Santos revived an important infrastructure program, which in fact had been planned during the Uribe administration.

Issues however remain regarding spillover of the FARC leftist-terrorist group, being chased out of hiding in rural areas of Colombia and finding save-havens in non-monitored areas of bordering states. The FARC numbers have significantly diminished in the last decade to an estimated 5,000-7,000. And while joint-military collaboration has steadily increased with the bordering countries of [[Brazil]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], and [[Venezuela]], there have been tensions between Colombia and [[Ecuador]] regarding the issue.  In 2002, the Ecuadorian government closed its main border crossing with Colombia, restricting its hours of operation. Ecuador continues to voice its concerns over an influx of \u00e9migr\u00e9 stemming from guerilla activity at its borders. Evidence has since emerged however, suggesting that a significant number of the FARC's foot-soldiers in and around the [[Colombia\u2013Ecuador border]], consist of Ecuadorian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who joined the leftist terrorist group out of need.<ref>{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e492b66.html |title=Ecuador |publisher=UNHCR |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref> Returning Ecuadorian \u00e9migr\u00e9 have faced re-entry restrictions.\n\nIn 2012, relations with [[Nicaragua]] and Venezuela were tested over territorial island disputes. Bilateral committees are negotiating the dispute with Venezuela over waters in the Gulf of Venezuela.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1969, Colombia formed what is now the [[Andean Community]] along with [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]] ([[Venezuela]] joined in 1973, and Chile left in 1976).\n\nIn the 1980s, Colombia broadened its bilateral and multilateral relations, joining the [[Contadora Group]], the [[Group of Eight]] (now the [[Rio Group]]), and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which it chaired from 1994 until September 1998. In addition, it has signed free trade agreements with Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela.\n\nColombia has traditionally played an active role in the [[United Nations]] and the Organization of American States and in their subsidiary agencies. Former President [[C\u00e9sar Gaviria]] became Secretary General of the OAS in September 1994 and was reelected in 1999. Colombia was a participant in the December 1994 and April 1998 Summits of the Americas and followed up on initiatives developed at the summit by hosting two post-summit, ministerial-level meetings on trade and science and technology.\n\nColombia regularly participates in international fora, including CICAD, the Organization of American States' body on [[money laundering]], chemical controls, and drug abuse prevention. Although the Colombian Government ratified the [[1988 UN Convention on Narcotics]] in 1994\u2014the last of the Andean governments to do so\u2014it took important reservations, notably to the anti-money-laundering measures, asset forfeiture and confiscation provisions, maritime interdiction, and extradition clauses. Colombia subsequently withdrew some of its reservations, most notably a reservation on extradition.\n\n==International relations==\n\n===Disputes \u2013 international===\n[[Maritime boundary]] dispute with Venezuela in the [[Gulf of Venezuela]]; territorial disputes with Nicaragua over Archipelago de [[San Andr\u00e9s y Providencia]] and [[Quita Sue\u00f1o Bank]]. The United States disputes sovereignty with Colombia over the [[Serranilla Bank]] and the [[Bajo Nuevo Bank]]. Quita Sue\u00f1o Bank is claimed by the United States to be a submerged reef, and thus does not recognize the sovereignty of any nation over the bank.\n\n===Membership of international organizations===\nMembership in International Organizations: The major organizations in which Colombia is a member include: the [[Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean]], [[Andean Pact]], [[Caribbean Development Bank]], [[Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], [[Group of 3]], Group of 11, [[Group of 24]], [[Group of 77]], [[Inter-American Development Bank]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], [[International Chamber of Commerce]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization]], [[International Criminal Police Organization]], [[International Development Association]], [[International Finance Corporation]], [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]], [[International Labour Organization]], [[International Maritime Organization]], [[International Maritime Satellite Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[International Olympic Committee]], [[International Organization for Migration]], [[International Organization for Standardization]], [[International Telecommunication Union]], [[International Telecommunications Satellite Organization]], [[International Trade Union Confederation]], [[Latin American Economic System]], [[Latin American Integration Association]], [[Non-Aligned Movement]], [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]], [[Rio Group]], [[United Nations]] (UN), [[UN Conference on Trade and Development]], [[UNESCO]], [[UN Industrial Development Organization]], [[UN Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees]], [[Universal Postal Union]], [[World Confederation of Labour]], [[World Federation of Trade Unions]], [[World Health Organization]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], [[World Meteorological Organization]], [[World Tourism Organization]], and [[World Trade Organization]]. An OAS observer has monitored the government's peace process with the paramilitaries, lending the negotiations much-needed international credibility. The United States helps Colombia secure favorable treatment from the IMF.\n\n===Major international treaties===\nRegional treaties include the [[Andean Pact]], now known as the [[Andean Community]], which also includes Bolivia, [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]], the bodies and institutions making up the Andean Integration System (AIS). Colombia has signed free-trade agreements with Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela.\n\nIts recent trade agreements with Korea, China and Japan, have focused on Economic, and Technical Cooperation between those nations. Within the regional Caribbean Community and Common Market ([[Caricom]]), Colombia has also deepened Economic and Medical Science Research collaboration agreements. Colombia has also signed and ratified 105 international treaties or agreements relating to the protection of the environment. These include the Antarctic Treaty and Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and conventions on [[Biodiversity]], [[Climate Change]], [[Desertification]], [[Endangered Species]], [[Hazardous Wastes]], [[Marine Life Conservation]], [[Ozone Layer Protection]], [[Ship Pollution]], [[Tropical Timber 83]], [[Tropical Timber 94]], and Wetlands. It has signed, but not ratified, the [[Antarctic-Environmental Protocol]] and conventions on Law of the Sea and Marine Dumping. Colombia also has signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] and the [[Tlatelolco Treaty]]. By 1975 signatories to the 1974 Declaration of Ayacucho, of which Colombia was one, had decided on limitations to nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.\n\nGaining all 186 votes, Colombia served on the U.N. Security Council from 2011-2012 representing Latin American and the Caribbean.\n\nColombia is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).\n\n==Bilateral relations==\n===Africa===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal relations began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Algeria}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Algeria has an embassy in Bogot\u00e1.\n* Colombia has an embassy in [[Algiers]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Egypt}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Colombia has an embassy in [[Cairo]].\n* Egypt has an embassy in Bogot\u00e1.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Ghana}}||<!--2018-->||\n\n* Colombia has an embassy in [[Accra]].\n* Ghana is accredited to Colombia from its embassy in [[Bras\u00edlia]], Brazil.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Kenya}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Colombia has an embassy in [[Nairobi]].\n* Kenya is accredited to Colombia from its embassy in Bras\u00edlia, Brazil.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Libya}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\nOn August 22, 2011 Colombia officially recognized the [[National Transitional Council]] as the only legitimate representative of the Libyan people.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Morocco}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Colombia has an embassy in [[Rabat]].\n* Moroccos has an embassy in Bogot\u00e1.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|South Africa}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Colombia has an embassy in [[Pretoria]].\n* South Africa is accredited to Colombia from its embassy in [[Caracas]], Venezuela.\n|}\n\n===Americas===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal relations began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Argentina }}||<!--Date started-->1823-03-03 ||See [[Argentina\u2013Colombia relations]]\n\n* Argentina has an embassy in Bogot\u00e1.\n* Colombia has an embassy in [[Buenos Aires]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://argentina.embajada.gov.co/\n |title=Colombian embassy in Buenos Aires\n |language=Spanish}}\n</ref>\n* Both countries are full members of the [[Organization of American States]], [[Latin American Economic System]], [[Latin American Integration Association]], [[Rio Group]] and [[Union of South American Nations]].\n*{{es icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20120219174941/http://www.mrecic.gov.ar/portal/seree/ditra/co.html List of Treaties ruling the relations Argentina and Colombia (Argentine Foreign Ministry]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Bolivia}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Bolivia\u2013Colombia relations]]\n\n* Bolivia has an embassy in Bogot\u00e1.\n* Colombia has an embassy in [[La Paz]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Brazil}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Brazil\u2013Colombia relations]]\n\n* Brazil has an embassy in Bogot\u00e1 and a vice-consulate in [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]].\n* Colombia has an embassy in [[Bras\u00edlia]] and consulates-general in [[Manaus]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and in [[Tabatinga]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Canada }}||<!--Date started--> 1953||See [[Canada\u2013Colombia relations]]\n\n* Canada has an embassy in Bogot\u00e1.<ref>[http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/colombia-colombie/ Embassy of Canada in Colombia]</ref>\n* Colombia has an embassy in [[Ottawa]] and consulates-general in [[Calgary]], [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]].<ref>[http://ottawa.consulado.gov.co Embassy of Colombia in Ottawa]</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Chile}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Chile\u2013Colombia relations]]\n\nBoth nations are members of the [[Pacific Alliance]].\n* Chile has an embassy in Bogot\u00e1.\n* Colombia has an embassy in [[Santiago]].\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Costa Rica}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Colombia has an embassy in [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]].\n* Costa Rica has an embassy in Bogot\u00e1.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Cuba}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Colombia has an embassy in [[Havana]].\n* Cuba has an embassy in Bogot\u00e1.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Dominican Republic}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Colombia has an embassy in [[Santo Domingo]].\n* Dominican Republic has an embassy in Bogot\u00e1.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Ecuador }}||<!--Date started--> 1831-12||See [[Colombia\u2013Ecuador relations]]\n\nPresent-day Colombia and Ecuador trace back established official diplomatic relations to December, 1831 with the signing of the Treaty of Pasto, in which both countries recognized each other as sovereign states.

Relations were strained during the presidency of [[Ernesto Samper Pizano|Ernesto Samper]] (1994\u201398) due to accusations of receiving illegal campaign funding from the [[Cali Cartel]]. Relations between the two countries greatly improved during the [[Andr\u00e9s Pastrana|Pastrana]] administration (1998\u20132002). In January 2000, the Clinton administration pledged more than US$1 billion of mainly military assistance to Colombia to assist the antidrug component of President Pastrana's strategy known as [[Plan Colombia]].\nRelations with the United States became a foreign policy priority for the [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe|Uribe administration]], and Colombia became an important ally in the \"[[War on Terrorism]]\". In March 2002, in response to a request from U.S. President [[George W. Bush]], the [[U.S. Congress]] lifted restrictions on U.S. assistance to Colombia to allow it to be used for counterinsurgency in addition to antidrug operations. U.S. support for Colombia's antidrug-trafficking efforts included slightly more than US$2.5 billion between 2000 and 2004, as compared with only about US$300 million in 1998. Some critics of current US policies in Colombia, such as Law Professor John Barry, claim that US influences have catalyzed internal conflicts.\n[[File:Embassy of Colombia in Washington, D.C..JPG|thumb|left|[[Embassy of Colombia in Washington, D.C.]]]]\nColombia rejects threats and blackmail of the United States of America after the threat of [[Donald Trump]] to decertify the country as a partner in counter-narcotics efforts.<ref name = \"Nobody has to threaten us: Colombia in response to Trump\"/>\n\n{{cquote|For more than 30 years Colombia has demonstrated its commitment \u2013 paying a very high cost in human lives \u2013 with overcoming the drug problem.

More than 90% of the cocaine that entered in the 1990s the United States was produced, processed, or transshipped in Colombia. The cultivation of coca reduced between 1995 and 1999 from 3,020 to {{convert|1100|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}}, primarily in areas where government control is more active.\n\nDespite the death of Medell\u00edn cartel drug kingpin [[Pablo Escobar]] in 1993 and the arrests of major Cali cartel leaders in 1995 and 1996, Colombian drug cartels remain among the most sophisticated criminal organizations in the world, controlling cocaine processing, international wholesale distribution chains, and markets. In 1999 Colombian police arrested over 30 narcotraffickers, most of them extraditable, in \"Operation Millennium\" involving extensive international cooperation. More arrests were made in a following \"Operation Millennium II.\"\n\nColombia is engaged in a broad range of narcotics control activities. Through aerial spraying of herbicide and manual eradication, Colombia has attempted to keep coca, opium poppy, and [[cannabis cultivation]] from expanding. The government has committed itself to the eradication of all illicit crops, interdiction of drug shipments, and financial controls to prevent money laundering. Alternative development programs were introduced in 1999.\n\nCorruption and intimidation by traffickers complicate the drug-control efforts of the institutions of government. Colombia passed revised criminal procedures code in 1993 that permits traffickers to surrender and negotiate lenient sentences in return for cooperating with prosecutors. In December 1996 and February 1997, however, the Colombian Congress passed legislation to toughen sentencing, asset forfeiture, and money-laundering penalties.\n\nIn November 1997, the Colombian Congress amended the constitution to permit the extradition of Colombian nationals, albeit not retroactively. In late 1999, President Pastrana authorized the first extradition in almost 10 years of a Colombian trafficker to stand trial for U.S. crimes. Three such extraditions to the United States have taken place, the most recent in August 2000, with cases against others pending in Colombian courts. Under the Pastrana administration, [[Plan Colombia]] was developed and implemented with U.S. backing.\n\nDuring the presidency of [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe]], the government applied more military pressure on the FARC and other outlawed groups. After the offensive, many security indicators improved. Colombia achieved a great decrease in cocaine production, leading White House drug czar R. Gil Kerlikowske to announce that Colombia is no longer the world's biggest producer of cocaine.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/ultimas_noticias/2012/07/120730_ultnot_droga_colombia_zar_tsb.shtml|title= Colombia is no longer the world's biggest producer of cocaine.| publisher= bbc.co.uk|language=Spanish|accessdate= 24 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"usatoday1\">{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2012/07/white-house-colombia-is-no-longer-top-cocaine-producer/1|title= Colombia no longer top cocaine producer| publisher=usatoday.com|accessdate= 24 April 2013|date=2012-07-30}}</ref> \n\nIn addition to the challenge posed to the United States by Colombian drug trafficking, illegal Colombian immigrants in the United States are an issue in Colombia-U.S. relations.

The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] has rated the Czech Republic as \"[[Democracy Index#Classification definitions|flawed democracy]]\" in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex2016|title=Democracy Index 2016 - The Economist Intelligence Unit|last=solutions|first=EIU digital|website=www.eiu.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Czechpolsystem.png|thumbnail|right|450px|The political system of the [[Czech Republic]]]]\n\n==Political developments==\nThe [[Czech Republic|Czech]] political scene supports a broad spectrum of [[political party|parties]] ranging from the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Communist Party]] on the far left to various [[nationalistic]] parties on the far right.\n\nCzech voters returned a split verdict in the June 2002 parliamentary elections, giving [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] (\u010cSSD) and Communists majority, without any possibility to form a functioning government together due to [[Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla]]'s strong anticommunism. The results produced a \u010cSSD coalition government with [[Christian Democratic Union - Czechoslovak People's Party|Christian Democrats]] (KDU-\u010cSL) and [[Freedom Union-Democratic Union|Liberals]] (US-DEU), while [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democrats]] (ODS) and Communists (KS\u010cM) took place in opposition. The MP ratio was the tiniest 101:99. After many buffetings and, finally, after the catastrophic results of the June [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Czech Republic)|European Parliament election, 2004]] \u0160pidla resigned after a revolt in his own party and the government was reshuffled on the same basis.\n\n[[Image:Flag of the President of the Czech Republic.svg|left|thumb|Flag of the Czech president]]\n\nAs the system in the Czech Republic repeatedly produces very weak governments (a specific problem is that about 15% of the electorate support the Communists, who are shunned by all the other parties) there is constant talk about changing it but without much chance of really pushing the reform through. An attempt to increase majority elements by tweaking the system parameters (more smaller districts, [[d'Hondt method]] used) by \u010cSSD and ODS during their \"opposition agreement\" of 1998\u20132002 was vehemently opposed by smaller parties and blocked by the Constitutional Court as going too much against the constitution-stated proportional principle; only a moderated form was adopted. This, however, led to a stalemate in the 2006 elections where both the left and the right each gained exactly 100 seats; as many commentators point out, the earlier system would have given the right a 3\u20134 seat majority.\n\nIn March 2006, the parliament overturned a veto by President V\u00e1clav Klaus, and the Czech Republic became the first former communist country in Europe to grant legal recognition to same-sex partnerships.\n\nA government formed of a coalition of the ODS, KDU-\u010cSL, and the [[Green Party (Czech Republic)|Green Party]] (SZ), and led by the leader of the ODS [[Mirek Topol\u00e1nek]] finally succeeded in winning a [[vote of confidence]] on 19 January 2007. This was thanks to two members of the \u010cSSD, Milo\u0161 Mel\u010d\u00e1k and Michal Pohanka, who abstained.\n\nOn 23 March 2009, the government of Mirek Topol\u00e1nek lost a [[Czech Republic Government Vote of No Confidence, 2009|vote of no-confidence]].\n\n==Executive branch==\nThe President is the head of state, but the Prime Minister is the head of government.\n{{office-table}}\n|[[President of the Czech Republic|President]]\n|[[Milo\u0161 Zeman]]\n|[[Party of Civic Rights \u2013 Zemanovci|Party of Civic Rights]]\n|8 March 2013\n|-\n|[[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]]\n|[[Andrej Babi\u0161]]\n|[[ANO 2011]]\n|6 December 2017\n|}\n\n=== President ===\nThe [[President of the Czech Republic]] is elected by a direct vote (no more than two consecutive) for five years.

The [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] (''Poslaneck\u00e1 sn\u011bmovna'') has 200 members, elected for a four-year term by [[proportional representation]] with a 5% [[election threshold]]. There are 14 voting districts identical to the country's administrative regions. The Chamber of Deputies, at first the [[Czech National Council]], has the powers and responsibilities of the now defunct federal parliament of the former [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\nThe [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Senate]] (''Sen\u00e1t'') has 81 members, in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] elected by two-round [[Two-round system|runoff voting]] for a six-year term, with one third renewed every even year in the autumn. The first election was 1996 (for differing terms). This is patterned after the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] but each constituency is of (roughly) same size and the system used is two-round runoff voting. The Senate is unpopular among the public and suffers from low election turnout (overall roughly 30% in the first round, 20% in the second).\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{elect|List of political parties in the Czech Republic|Elections in the Czech Republic}}\n{{Czech legislative election, 2017}}\n{{Composition of the Senate of the Czech Republic}}\n\n==Judicial branch==\n{{Main|Judiciary of the Czech Republic}}\nThe country's highest court of appeals is the [[Supreme Court of the Czech Republic|Supreme Court]].

The Czech industrial tradition dates back to the 19th century, when the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were the economic and industrial heartland of the [[Austrian Empire]] and later the Austrian side of [[Austria-Hungary]]. The Czech lands produced a majority (about 70%) of all industrial goods in the Empire, some of which were almost monopolistic. The Czechoslovak crown was introduced in April 1919. Introduced at a 1:1 ratio to the Austro-Hungarian currency, it became one of the most stable currencies in Europe. [[First Czechoslovak Republic|The First Republic]] became one of the 10 most developed countries of the world (behind the U.S., Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Argentina, Britain, France, Sweden and Belgium).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penize.cz/ekonomika/244016-nas-ucet-za-komunismus|title=N\u00e1\u0161 \u00fa\u010det za komunismus|date=18 October 2012|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe consequences of the 1938 [[Munich Agreement]] and subsequent occupation were disastrous for the economy. After the occupation and forced subordination of the economy to German economic interests, the crown was officially pegged to the mark at a ratio of 1:10, even though the unofficial exchange rate was 1 to 6-7 and Germans immediately started buying Czech goods in large quantities.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Czechoslovak currency|url=http://www.zlate-mince.cz/OM9_Ceskoslovenska_mena.htm|website=zlate-mince.cz|accessdate=17 July 2014|language=Czech}}</ref>\n\nIn accordance with [[Stalinism|Stalin]]'s development policy of planned interdependence, all the economies of the socialist countries were tightly linked to that of the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Czechoslovakia]] was the most prosperous country in the [[Eastern Bloc]], however it continued to lag further behind the rest of the developed world. With the disintegration of the communist economic alliance in 1991, Czech manufacturers lost their traditional markets among former communist countries in the east.\n\nToday, this heritage is both an asset and a [[liability (financial accounting)|liability]]. The Czech Republic has a well-educated population and a well-developed infrastructure.<ref>{{cite paper |author=Petr Pabian |date=2009 |title=Europeanisation of higher education governance in the post-communist context: The case of the Czech Republic |journal=European integration and the governance of higher education and research |pages=257\u2013278 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\n===1989\u20131995===\nThe \"[[Velvet Revolution]]\" in 1989, offered a chance for profound and sustained political and economic reform. Signs of economic resurgence began to appear in the wake of the [[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]] that the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) labelled the \"''big bang''\" of January 1991. Since then, consistent liberalization and astute economic management has led to the removal of 95% of all price controls, low unemployment, a positive [[balance of payments]] position, a stable [[exchange rate]], a shift of exports from former [[Eastern bloc|communist economic bloc]] markets to Western Europe, and relatively low [[foreign debt]]. Inflation has been higher than in some other countries \u2013 mostly in the 10% range{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} \u2013 and the government has run consistent modest [[budget deficit]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nTwo government priorities have been strict [[fiscal policy|fiscal policies]] and creating a good climate for incoming investment in the republic. Following a series of currency [[devaluation]]s, the [[Czech koruna|crown]] has remained stable in relation to the US$.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The Czech crown became fully [[convertibility|convertible]] for most business purposes in late 1995.\n\nIn order to stimulate the economy and attract foreign partners, the government has revamped the legal and administrative structure governing investment. With the breakup of the Soviet Union, the country, till that point highly dependent on exports to the USSR, had to make a radical shift in economic outlook: away from the East, and towards the West. This necessitated the restructuring of existing banking and telecommunications facilities, as well as adjusting commercial laws and practices to fit Western standards. Further minimizing reliance on a single major partner, successive Czech governments have welcomed U.S. investment (amongst others) as a counterbalance to the strong economic influence of Western European partners, especially of their powerful neighbour, Germany. <!-- Which was not always successful, see the flop with Boeing vs Aero Vodochody. --> Although [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) runs in uneven cycles, with a 12.9% share of total FDI between 1990 and March 1998, the U.S. was the third-largest foreign investor in the Czech economy, behind Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nProgress toward creating a stable investment climate was recognized when the Czech Republic became the first post-communist country to receive an investment-grade credit rating by international credit institutions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nThe country boasts a flourishing consumer production sector and has [[privatization|privatized]] most state-owned heavy industries through the [[voucher privatization]] system. Under the system, every citizen was given the opportunity to buy, for a moderate price, a book of vouchers that represents potential shares in any state-owned company. The voucher holders could then invest their vouchers, increasing the capital base of the chosen company, and creating a nation of citizen share-holders. This is in contrast to Russian privatization, which consisted of sales of communal assets to private companies rather than share-transfer to citizens. The effect of this policy has been dramatic. Under communism, state ownership of businesses was estimated to be 97%.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Privatization through restitution of real estate to the former owners was largely completed in 1992. By 1998, more than 80% of enterprises were in private hands. Now completed,{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} the program has made Czechs, who own shares of each of the Czech companies, one of the highest per-capita share owners in the world.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} <!--. Some people think it was a flop. Shouldn't it be reflected here? -->\n\n===1995\u20132000===\nThe country's economic transformation was far from complete. Political and financial crises in 1997, shattered the Czech Republic's image as one of the most stable and prosperous of post-Communist states. Delays in enterprise restructuring and failure to develop a well-functioning capital market played major roles in Czech economic troubles, which culminated in a currency crisis in May. The formerly pegged currency was forced into a floating system as investors sold their Korunas faster than the government could buy them. This followed a worldwide trend to divest from developing countries that year. Investors also worried the republic's economic transformation was far from complete. Another complicating factor was the current account deficit, which reached nearly 8% of GDP.\n\nIn response to the crisis, two [[austerity]] packages were introduced later in the spring (called vernacularly \"The Packages\"), which cut government spending by 2.5% of GDP. Growth dropped to 0.3% in 1997, \u22122.3% in 1998, and \u22120.5% in 1999. The government established a restructuring agency in 1999 and launched a revitalization program \u2013 to spur the sale of firms to foreign companies. Key priorities included accelerating legislative convergence with EU norms, restructuring enterprises, and privatising banks and utilities. The economy, fueled by increased export growth and investment, was expected to recover by 2000.\n\n===2000\u20132005===\nGrowth in 2000\u201305 was supported by exports to the EU, primarily to Germany, and a strong recovery of foreign and domestic investment. Domestic demand is playing an ever more important role in underpinning growth as interest rates drop and the availability of credit cards and mortgages increases. Current account deficits of around 5% of GDP are beginning to decline as demand for Czech products in the European Union increases. Inflation is under control. Recent accession to the EU gives further impetus and direction to structural reform. In early 2004 the government passed increases in the Value Added Tax (VAT) and tightened eligibility for social benefits with the intention to bring the public finance gap down to 4% of GDP by 2006, but more difficult pension and healthcare reforms will have to wait until after the next elections. Privatization of the state-owned telecommunications firm [[\u010cesk\u00fd Telecom]] took place in 2005. Intensified restructuring among large enterprises, improvements in the financial sector, and effective use of available EU funds should strengthen output growth.\n\n===2005\u20132010===\nGrowth continued in the first years of the EU membership. The credit portion of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]] did not affect the Czech Republic much, mostly due to its stable banking sector which has learned its lessons during a smaller crisis in the late 1990s and became much more cautious. As a fraction of the GDP, the Czech public debt is among the smallest ones in Central and Eastern Europe. Moreover, unlike many other post-communist countries, an overwhelming majority of the [[household debt]] \u2013 over 99% \u2013 is denominated in the local Czech currency. That's why the country wasn't affected by the shrunken money supply in the U.S. dollars.\n\nHowever, as a large exporter, the economy was sensitive to the decrease of the demand in Germany and other trading partners. In the middle of 2009, the annual drop of the GDP for 2009 was estimated around 3% or 4.3%,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/278536,czech-economy-to-shrink-by-43-per-cent-in-2009.html|title=Earth Times: show/278536,czech-economy-to-shrink-by-43-per-cent-in-2009.html|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref> a relatively modest decrease. The impact of the economic crisis may have been limited by the existence of the national currency that temporarily weakened in H1 of 2009, simplifying the life of the exporters.\n\n===2010\u20132015===\nFrom the [[Great Recession|financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]], Czech Republic is in stagnation or decreasing of GDP. Some commenters and economists criticising fiscally conservative policy of Petr Ne\u010das' right-wing government, especially criticising ex-minister of finance, [[Miroslav Kalousek]]. Miroslav Kalousek in a 2008 interview, as minister of finance in the center-right government of Mirek Topol\u00e1nek, said \"Czech Republic will not suffer by financial crisis\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hn.ihned.cz/c1-28777680-mozna-vas-zklamu-krize-nam-nehrozi|title=Miroslav Kalousek: Mon\u00e1 v\u00e1s zklamu: krize n\u00e1m nehroz\u00ed|work=Hospod\u00e1\u00f8sk\u00e9 noviny|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref> In September 2008, Miroslav Kalousek formed state budget with projection of 5% GDP increase in 2009. In 2009 and 2010, Czech Republic suffered strong economical crisis and GDP decreased by 4,5%. From 2009 to 2012, Czech Republic suffered highest state budget deficits in history of independent Czech Republic. From 2008 to 2012, the public debt of Czech Republic increased by 18,9%. Most decrease of industrial output was in construction industry (-25% in 2009, -15,5% in 2013). From 4Q 2009 to 1Q 2013, GDP decreased by 7,8%.\n\nIn 2012, Czech government increased [[VAT]]. Basic VAT was increased from 20% in 2012 to 21% in 2013 and reduced VAT increased from 14% to 15% in 2013. Small enterprises sales decreased by 21% from 2012 to 2013 as result of increasing VAT.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzy.cz/makroekonomika/sluzby/|title=Slu\u017eby - v\u00fdvoj tr\u017eeb ve slu\u017eb\u00e1ch v \u010cR, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref> Patria.cz predicting sales stagnation and mild increase in 2013.\nAnother problem is foreign trade. The Czech Republic is considered an export economy (the Czech Republic has strong machinery and automobile industries), however in 2013, foreign trade rapidly decreased which led to many other problems and increase of state budget deficit. In 2013, Czech National Bank, central bank, implemented controversial monetary step. To increase export and employment, CNB wilfully deflated Czech Crown (CZK), which inflation increased from 0.2% in November 2013, to 1.3% in 1Q 2014.\n\nIn 2014, GDP in the Czech Republic increased by 2% and is predicted to increase by 2.7% in 2015.

Throughout the centuries of foreign rule, the Czechs were subjected, at times, to intense [[Germanization]]. Nevertheless, Czechs maintained their ethnic identity and seized the opportunity for independence during [[World War I]]. Czechs and [[Slovaks]] deserted the armies of [[Austria-Hungary]] in large numbers to form the [[Czechoslovak Legion]].<ref name=\"Gawdiak\" />\n\n=== Czechoslovakia ===\n{{Main article|Czechoslovak Army|Czechoslovak People's Army}}\nThe [[Czechoslovak Army|Czechoslovak Armed Forces]] were originally formed on 30 June 1918 when 6,000 members of the [[Czechoslovak Legion in France]], which had been established in 1914, took oath and received a battle banner in [[Darney]], [[France]], thus preceding the official [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918\u201338)|declaration of Czechoslovak independence]] by four months. The military achievements of the Czechoslovak legions on the [[Czechoslovak Legion in France|French]], [[Czechoslovak Legion in Italy|Italian]] and especially [[Czechoslovak Legion|Russian]] front became one of the main arguments that the Czechoslovak pro-independence leaders could use to gain the support for the country's independence by the [[Allies of World War I]].\n\nIn 1938, [[Serviceman|servicemen]] of the Czechoslovak Army and the [[State Defense Guard (Czechoslovakia)|State Defense Guard]] fought in an undeclared border war against the German-backed [[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]] as well as [[Second Polish Republic|Polish]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungarian]] paramilitary forces. As a result of the [[Munich Agreement]], areas heavily populated by ethnic [[Sudeten Germans|German speaking people]] were incorporated into the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and military aged men living there were subject to being drafted into the [[Wehrmacht]]. Following the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia's complete annexation]] in 1939 and creation of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], the Protectorate's government possessed its own armed force, the [[Government Army]] (6,500 men), tasked with public security and [[rearguard]] duties. On the other side of the conflict, a number of Czechoslovak units and formations served with the [[Polish Army]] ([[Czechoslovak Legion (1939)|Czechoslovak Legion]]), the [[French Army]], the [[Royal Air Force]], the [[British Army]] (the [[1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade]]), and the [[Red Army]] ([[I Corps (Czechoslovakia)|I Corps]]).

It is done for locomotion, recreation and competition, in trades that rely on it, and in emergency rescue and military operations. It is done indoors and out, on natural and man-made structures.\n\n==Types==\nClimbing activities include:\n\n* [[Bouldering]]: Ascending boulders or small outcrops, often with climbing shoes and a chalk bag or bucket. Usually, instead of using a safety rope from above, injury is avoided using a [[Bouldering mat|crash pad]] and a human spotter (to direct a falling climber on to the pad. They can also give beta, or advice)\n* [[Buildering]]: Ascending the exterior skeletons of buildings, typically without protective equipment.\n* [[Canyoneering]]: Climbing along [[canyons]] for sport or recreation.\n* [[Chalk]] climbing: Ascending chalk cliffs uses some of the same techniques as ice climbing.\n* [[climbing competition|Competition climbing]]: A formal, competitive sport of recent origins, normally practiced on artificial walls that resemble natural formations. The International Federation of Sport Climbing ([[International Federation of Sport Climbing|IFSC]]) is the official organization governing competition rock climbing worldwide and is recognized by the [[IOC]] and [[GAISF]] and is a member of the International World Games Association ([[IWGA]]). The UIAA is the official organization governing competition ice climbing worldwide. Competition climbing has three major disciplines: Lead, Bouldering and Speed.\n* [[Free climbing|Free Climbing]]: a form of [[rock climbing]] in which the climber uses climbing equipment such as [[Climbing rope|ropes]] and other means of [[Protection (climbing)|climbing protection]], but only to protect against injury during falls and not to assist progress.\n* [[Ice climbing]]: Ascending ice or hard snow formations using special equipment, usually [[ice axe]]s and [[crampon]]s. Techniques of protecting the climber are similar to those of rock climbing, with protective devices (such as ice screws and snow wedges) adapted to frozen conditions.\n* [[Indoor climbing]]: [[Top roping]], [[lead climbing]], and [[bouldering]] artificial walls with bolted holds in a climbing gym.\n*[[Mountaineering]]: Ascending mountains for sport or recreation. It often involves rock and/or ice climbing (Alpine climbing).\n* [[Pole climbing]]: Climbing poles and masts without equipment.\n* [[Lumberjack]] tree-trimming and competitive tree-trunk or pole climbing for speed using spikes and belts.\n* [[Rock climbing]]: Ascending rock formations, often using climbing shoes and a [[chalk bag]]. Equipment such as ropes, bolts, nuts, hexes and camming devices are normally employed, either as a safeguard or for artificial aid.\n* [[Rope access]]: Industrial climbing, usually [[abseiling]], as an alternative to [[scaffolding]] for short works on exposed structures.\n* [[Rope climbing]]: Climbing a short, thick rope for speed. Not to be confused with ''roped climbing'', as in rock or ice climbing.\n* [[Scrambling]] which includes easy rock climbing, and is considered part of [[hillwalking]].\n* [[Sport climbing]] is a form of [[rock climbing]] that relies on permanent [[anchor (climbing)|anchors]] fixed to the rock, and possibly [[bolt (climbing)|bolt]]s, for [[protection (climbing)|protection]], (in contrast with [[traditional climbing]], where the rock is typically devoid of fixed anchors and bolts, and where climbers must place removable protection as they climb).\n* [[Top rope|Top roping]]: Ascending a rock climbing route protected by a rope anchored at the top and protected by a [[belay]]er below\n* [[Traditional climbing]] (more casually known as Trad climbing) is a form of climbing without fixed anchors and bolts. Climbers place removable protection such as camming devices, nuts, and other passive and active protection that holds the rope to the rock (via the use of carabiners and webbing/slings) in the event of a fall and/or when weighted by a climber. \n* [[Solo climbing]]: Solo climbing or soloing is a style of climbing in which the climber climbs alone, without somebody [[belaying]] them. When free soloing, an error usually is fatal as no belay systems are being used. Soloing can also be self-belayed, hence minimizing the risks.  \n* [[Tree climbing]]: Recreationally ascending trees using ropes and other protective equipment.\n* A [[tower climber]] is a professional who climbs broadcasting or [[telecommunication tower]]s or masts for maintenance or repair.\n\nRock, ice and tree climbing all usually utilize ropes for safety or aid. Pole climbing and rope climbing were among the first exercises to be included in the origins of modern gymnastics in the late 18th century and early 19th century.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Aid climbing]]\n* [[Clean climbing]]\n* [[Climbing clubs]]\n* [[Climbing wall]]\n* [[Climbing equipment]]\n* [[:Category:Climbing organisations|Climbing organisations]]\n* [[Fall factor]]\n* [[List of climbers]] \u2013 notable rock and ice climbers\n* [[List of climbing topics]]\n* [[Glossary of climbing terms]]\n* [[Glossary of knots common in climbing]]\n* [[Outdoor education]]\n* [[Outdoor activity]]\n* [[Rock climbing]]\n* [[Running belay]]\n* [[Parkour]]\n* [[Scrambling]]\n* [[Solo climbing]]\n* [[Speed climbing]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{dmoz|Recreation/Climbing}}\n{{commons category|Climbing}}\n\n{{Climbing navbox}}\n{{Adventure travel}}\n{{Extreme sports}}\n{{Orienteering}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Climbing| ]]", "sha1": "r1zt75j9im666x90tabcw78uewnj32h"}}, {"title": "Continuity Irish Republican Army", "ns": "0", "id": "5859", "revision": {"id": "863702284", "parentid": "860654400", "timestamp": "2018-10-12T13:15:55Z", "contributor": {"username": "Rdfallis", "id": "33722571"}, "comment": "Added citation for link to RSF", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n{{Infobox war faction\n|name=Continuity Irish Republican Army\n|war=the [[dissident Irish Republican campaign]]\n|image=Ciraderry.jpg\n|caption=CIRA propaganda video\n|active=1986- present<ref>{{cite web|author=Connla Young |url=https://www.irishnews.com/news/2018/01/26/news/republican-groups-have-no-plans-o-nh-ceasefire-style-ceasefire-1242024/ |title=Republican groups have no plans for \u00d3NH-style ceasefire |work=The Irish News |date= |accessdate=2018-09-22}}</ref>\n|ideology={{plainlist|\n*[[Physical force Irish republicanism]]\n*[[Irish nationalism]]\n*[[Irish republican legitimism]]\n*[[Dissident republican]]ism\n*[[\u00c9ire Nua]]}}\n|allegiance={{flag|Irish Republic}}\n|clans=[[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]] (political wing)<br>[[Fianna \u00c9ireann]] (youth wing)<br>[[Cumann na mBan]] (women's wing)\n|leader1_title=Leadership\n|leader1_name=Continuity Army Council\n|area=[[Northern Ireland]] (mainly)<br>[[Republic of Ireland]]\n|strength=About 50 (as of July 2012)<ref>[https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2011/195553.htm#cira].

It aims to bring about a [[united Ireland]]. It emerged from a split in the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] in 1986 but did not become active until the Provisional IRA [[ceasefire]] of 1994.

It sees itself as the national army of an [[Irish Republic]] covering the whole of [[Ireland]]. The [[security forces]] initially referred to it as the \"Irish National Republican Army\" (INRA).\n\nSince 1994, the CIRA has [[Timeline of Continuity Irish Republican Army actions|waged a campaign]] in Northern Ireland against the [[British Army]] and the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI), formerly the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC). This is part of a [[Dissident Irish Republican campaign|wider campaign]] against the British security forces by [[dissident republican]] paramilitaries. It has targeted the security forces in gun attacks and bombings, as well as with grenades, [[Barrack buster|mortars]] and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|rockets]]. The CIRA has also carried out bombings with the goal of causing economic harm and/or disruption, as well as many punishment attacks on alleged criminals.\n\nTo date, it has been responsible for the death of one PSNI officer.<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/index.html Sutton Index of Deaths]. ''CAIN''.</ref> The CIRA is not as big and has not been as active as the [[Real Irish Republican Army|Real IRA]] and there have been a number of splits within the organisation since the mid-2000s.\n\n==Origins==\n\n===1986 IRA General Army Convention===\nThe Continuity IRA has its origins in a split in the Provisional IRA. In September 1986, the Provisional IRA held a meeting of its General Army Convention (GAC), the organisation's supreme decision-making body. It was the first GAC in 16 years. The meeting, which like all such meetings was secret, was convened to discuss among other resolutions, the articles of the Provisional IRA constitution which dealt with [[abstentionism]], specifically its opposition to the taking of seats in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (the parliament of the [[Republic of Ireland]]).<ref>J Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army: The IRA, Poolbeg, revised third edition, Dublin, 1997, {{ISBN|1-85371-813-0}}</ref> The GAC passed motions (by the necessary two-thirds majority) allowing members of the Provisional IRA to discuss and debate the taking of parliamentary seats, and the removal of the ban on members of the organisation from supporting any successful republican candidate who took their seat in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.<ref>{{cite web| title = A Chronology of the Conflict \u2013 1986 | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch86.htm | publisher = [[CAIN]] | date = | accessdate = 17 May 2007}}</ref><ref>\"Essentially since the spring of 1972, the crucial player in the armed struggle has been the Provisional IRA\u2014now ''the IRA''.

Those members of the outgoing Executive who opposed the change comprised a [[quorum]]. They met, dismissed those in favour of the change, and set up a new Executive. They contacted [[Tom Maguire]], who was a commander in the old IRA and had supported the Provisionals against the [[Official IRA]] (see [[Irish republican legitimatism]]), and asked him for support. Maguire had also been contacted by supporters of [[Gerry Adams]], then president of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], and a supporter of the change in the Provisional IRA constitution.\n\nMaguire rejected Adams' supporters, supported the IRA Executive members opposed to the change, and named the new organisers the Continuity Army Council.<ref>Robert White, Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh, the Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary. 2006. Indiana University Press. p310</ref> In a 1986 statement, he rejected \"the legitimacy of an Army Council styling itself the Council of the Irish Republican Army which lends support to any person or organisation styling itself as Sinn F\u00e9in and prepared to enter the partition parliament of Leinster House.\" In 1987, Maguire described the \"Continuity Executive\" as the \"lawful Executive of the Irish Republican Army.\"<ref>Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh, Dilseacht, The Story of Comdt. General Tom Maguire and the Second (all-Ireland) D\u00e1il, 1997, pp. 65\u201366.</ref>\n\n==Campaign==\nAlthough much smaller than the [[Real IRA]], the Continuity IRA has been behind a number of attacks, including the shooting dead of PSNI Constable Stephen Carroll, who was shot on 9 March 2009 as he responded to an emergency call in [[Craigavon]]. He was the first police officer to be killed since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. He was killed two days after the Real IRA's [[2009 Massereene Barracks shooting]] at [[Massereene Barracks]] in Antrim. In a press interview with [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]] some days later, regarded by some to be the political wing of the Continuity IRA, Paddy Walsh described the attacks as \"acts of war\".\n\nIn 2013, the Continuity IRA's 'South Down Brigade' threatened a [[Irish Travellers|Traveller]] family in Newry and published a statement in the local newspaper. There were negotiations with community representatives and the CIRA announced the threat was lifted. It was believed the threat was issued after a Traveller feud which resulted in a pipe bomb attack in Bessbrook, near Newry. The Continuity IRA is believed to be strongest in the [[County Fermanagh]] - North [[County Armagh]] area (Craigavon, Armagh and Lurgan). It is believed to be behind a number of attacks such as pipe bombings, rocket attacks, gun attacks, and the PSNI claimed it orchestrated riots a number of times to lure police officers into areas such as Kilwilkie in Lurgan and Drumbeg in Craigavon in order to attack them. It also claimed the group orchestrated a riot during a security alert in Lurgan. The alert turned out to be a hoax.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/continuity-ira|title=Continuity IRA|work=the Guardian|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Claim to legitimacy===\n{{Main article|Irish republican legitimism}}\nThus, similar to the claim put forward by the Provisional IRA after its split from the [[Official IRA]] in 1969, the Continuity IRA claims to be the legitimate continuation of the original [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] or ''\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann''.<ref>{{cite book | last = van Engeland | first = Anisseh | authorlink = | title = From Terrorism to Politics (Ethics and Global Politics) | publisher = [[Ashgate Publishing]] | year = 2008 | page = 55 | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-7546-4990-8}}</ref> This argument is based on the view that the surviving anti-[[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] members of the [[Second D\u00e1il]] delegated their \"authority\" to the [[IRA Army Council]] in 1938. As further justification for this claim, [[Tom Maguire]], one of those anti-Treaty members of the Second D\u00e1il, issued a statement in favour of the Continuity IRA, just as he had done in 1969 in favour of the Provisionals. [[J. Bowyer Bell]], in his ''The Irish Troubles'', describes Maguire's opinion in 1986: \"abstentionism was a basic tenet of republicanism, a moral issue of principle. Abstentionism gave the movement legitimacy, the right to wage war, to speak for a Republic all but established in the hearts of the people\".<ref>J.

On 2 November, the 628 delegates present cast their votes, the result being 429 to 161. The traditionalists, having lost at both conventions, walked out of the Mansion House, met that evening at the West County Hotel, and reformed as [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]] (RSF).<ref>J Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army, The IRA, Poolbeg, revised third edition, Dublin, 1997, {{ISBN|1-85371-813-0}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a report in the ''Cork Examiner'', the Continuity IRA's first chief of staff was [[D\u00e1ith\u00ed \u00d3 Conaill]],<ref name=\"agdooe\">{{cite web|title=CIRA bomb adds to growing crisis in the peace process |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2000/02/07/current/opinionpage_9.htm |work=[[Irish Examiner]] |date=2 July 2000 |accessdate=17 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509104341/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2000/02/07/current/opinionpage_9.htm |archivedate= 9 May 2007 |df= }}</ref> who also served as the first chairman of RSF from 1986 to 1987.

However it was believed in 1999 and 2000 that members of the Continuity IRA and members of the Real IRA travelled a number of times to [[Croatia]] in the former Yugoslavia to purchase some arms with a contact they had established. It was widely believed that some of those arms including [[plastic explosive]]s such as TM-500, [[M70AB1]]s and [[M70AB2]]s (Yugoslav variants of the [[AK47]] and [[AKM]] rifles), Czech [[Sa vz. 23|Vz-26]] [[sub-machine gun]]s, [[RPG-18]] rocket launchers and a quantity of ammunition, which they managed to smuggle safely to Ireland. \nThe Garda\u00ed later discovered some of this equipment, at this stage belonging to the Real IRA, in bunkers and training camps in County Meath. Real IRA member Alan Ryan,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19474261|title=BBC News - Real IRA man Alan Ryan shot dead in 'targeted killing'|work=BBC News|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> aged 19, was arrested at an underground training camp in County Meath.  Ryan later became a prominent member of the Real IRA in Dublin, only to be killed in a violent feud with Dublin criminals in 2012. In 2000 Croatian police stopped a truck carrying a consignment of arms believed to be destined for the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA.  The footage featured in a [[BBC Spotlight]] documentary in 2003 about dissident republicans.  It is believed that the Continuity IRA still holds some of the arms that got through.\n\nMuch of its weaponry is believed to be mostly of Provisional IRA origin such as the Romanian AKM rifles the Provisional IRA imported from Libya. Some of these weapons can be seen in Real IRA and Continuity IRA propaganda videos or photographs taken by journalists who  interviewed members of the Continuity IRA.  They are in many of the arms dumps uncovered by British and Irish security forces.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\n==Activities==\n{{Main article|Chronology of Continuity Irish Republican Army actions}}\n\nInitially, the Continuity IRA did not reveal its existence, either in the form of press statements or paramilitary activity.

The CIRA continues to oppose the [[Good Friday Agreement]] and, unlike the Provisional IRA (and the Real IRA in 1998), the CIRA has not announced a ceasefire or agreed to participate in weapons decommissioning\u2014nor is there any evidence that it will. In the 18th [[Independent Monitoring Commission]]'s report, the RIRA, the CIRA and the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) were deemed a potential future threat. The CIRA was labelled \"active, dangerous and committed and... capable of a greater level of violent and other crime\". Like the RIRA and RIRA splinter group [[Real IRA/ONH|\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann]], it too sought funds for expansion. It is also known to have worked with the INLA.\n\nThe CIRA has been involved in a number of bombing and shooting incidents. Targets of the CIRA have included the [[British Armed Forces|British military]], the Northern Ireland police (both the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] and its successor the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]]) and [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster loyalist]] [[Paramilitary|paramilitaries]]. Since the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998 the CIRA, along with other paramilitaries opposing the ceasefire, have been involved with a countless number of punishment shootings and beatings.

The act of measurement affects the system, causing the set of probabilities to reduce to only one of the possible values immediately after the measurement. This feature is known as [[wave function collapse]].\n\nThere have been many objections to the Copenhagen interpretation over the years. These include: discontinuous jumps when there is an observation, the probabilistic element introduced upon observation, the subjectiveness of requiring an observer, the difficulty of defining a measuring device, and the necessity of invoking classical physics to describe the \"laboratory\" in which the results are measured.\n\n[[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|Alternatives]] to the Copenhagen interpretation include the [[many-worlds interpretation]], the [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory|De Broglie\u2013Bohm (pilot-wave) interpretation]], [[Quantum Bayesianism]], and [[quantum decoherence]] theories.\n\n==Background==\n\n[[Max Planck]], [[Albert Einstein]], and [[Niels Bohr]] postulated the occurrence of energy in discrete quantities ([[quantum|quanta]]) in order to explain phenomena such as the spectrum of [[black-body radiation]], the [[photoelectric effect]], and the stability and [[Emission spectrum|spectrum]] of atoms. These phenomena had eluded explanation by classical physics and even appeared to be in contradiction with it. Although elementary particles show predictable properties in many experiments, they become thoroughly unpredictable in others, such as attempts to identify individual particle trajectories through a simple physical apparatus.\n\n[[Classical physics]] draws a distinction between particles and waves. It also relies on continuity and determinism in natural phenomena. In the early twentieth century, newly discovered atomic and subatomic phenomena seemed to defy those conceptions. In 1925\u20131926, quantum mechanics was invented as a mathematical formalism that accurately describes the experiments, yet appears to reject those classical conceptions. Instead, it posits that probability, and discontinuity, are fundamental in the physical world. Classical physics also relies on causality. The standing of causality for quantum mechanics is disputed.\n\nQuantum mechanics cannot easily be reconciled with everyday language and observation, and has often seemed counter-intuitive to physicists, including its inventors.<ref>Werner Heisenberg, ''Physics and Philosophy'' (1958): \"I remember discussions with Bohr which went through many hours till very late at night and ended almost in despair; and when at the end of the discussion I went alone for a walk in the neighbouring park I repeated to myself again and again the question: Can nature possibly be so absurd as it seemed to us in these atomic experiments?\"</ref>\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation intends to indicate the proper ways of thinking and speaking about the physical meaning of the [[mathematical]] formulations of quantum mechanics and the corresponding experimental results. It offers due respect to discontinuity, probability, and a conception of wave\u2013particle dualism. In some respects, it denies standing to causality.\n\n==Origin of the term==\n\n[[Werner Heisenberg]] had been an assistant to [[Niels Bohr]] at [[Niels Bohr Institute|his institute]] in [[Copenhagen]] during part of the 1920s, when they helped originate quantum mechanical theory.  In 1929, Heisenberg gave a series of invited lectures at the University of Chicago explaining the new field of quantum mechanics.  The lectures then served as the basis for his textbook, ''[[The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory]]'', published in 1930.<ref>J. Mehra and H. Rechenberg, ''The historical development of quantum theory'', Springer-Verlag, 2001, p. 271.</ref>  In the book's preface, Heisenberg wrote:\n\n<blockquote>On the whole, the book contains nothing that is not to be found in previous publications, particularly in the investigations of Bohr.  The purpose of the book seems to me to be fulfilled if it contributes somewhat to the diffusion of that 'Kopenhagener Geist der Quantentheorie' [i.e., Copenhagen spirit of quantum theory] if I may so express myself, which has directed the entire development of modern atomic physics.</blockquote>\n\nThe term 'Copenhagen interpretation' suggests something more than just a spirit, such as some definite set of rules for interpreting the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, presumably dating back to the 1920s. However, no such text exists, apart from some informal popular lectures by Bohr and Heisenberg, which contradict each other on several important issues{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

Bohr once distanced himself from what he considered to be Heisenberg's more subjective interpretation.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-copenhagen/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]</ref>\n\nDifferent commentators and researchers have associated various ideas with it.

The \"statistical\" or \"ensemble\" interpretation, on the other hand, is explicitly agnostic about whether the information in the wave function is exhaustive of what might be known in advance. It sees itself as more 'minimal' than the Copenhagen interpretation in its claims. It only goes as far as saying that on every occasion of observation, some actual value of some property is found, and that such values are found probabilistically, as detected by many occasions of observation of the same system. The many occurrences of the system are said to constitute an 'ensemble', and they jointly reveal the probability through these occasions of observation. Though they all have the same wave function, the elements of the ensemble might not be identical to one another in all respects, according to the 'agnostic' interpretations. They may, for all we know, beyond current knowledge and beyond the wave function, have individual distinguishing properties. For present-day science, the experimental significance of these various forms of Born's rule is the same, since they make the same predictions about the probability distribution of outcomes of observations, and the unobserved or unactualized potential properties are not accessible to experiment.\n\n==Nature of collapse==\n{{main|wave function collapse|quantum decoherence}}\nThose who hold to the Copenhagen interpretation are willing to say that a wave function involves the various probabilities that a given event will proceed to certain different outcomes.

At a single \"point\" of configuration space, the wave function collects probabilistic information about several distinct particles, that respectively have physically space-like separation. So the wave function is said to supply a non-separable representation. This reflects a feature of the quantum world that was recognized by Einstein as early{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} as 1905.\n\nIn 1927, Bohr drew attention to a consequence of non-separability. The evolution of the system, as determined by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, does not display particle trajectories through space\u2013time. It is possible to extract trajectory information from such evolution, but not simultaneously to extract energy\u2013momentum information. This incompatibility is expressed in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The two kinds of information have to be extracted on different occasions, because of the non-separability of the wave function representation. In Bohr's thinking, space\u2013time visualizability meant trajectory information. Again, in Bohr's thinking, 'causality' referred to energy\u2013momentum transfer; in his view, lack of energy\u2013momentum knowledge meant lack of 'causality' knowledge. Therefore Bohr thought that knowledge respectively of 'causality' and of space\u2013time visualizability were incompatible but complementary.<ref name=\"Howard 2004\"/>\n\n==Wave\u2013particle dilemma==\n\n{{further|Wave-particle duality}}\n\nThe term Copenhagen interpretation is not well defined when one asks about the wave\u2013particle dilemma, because Bohr and Heisenberg had different or perhaps disagreeing views on it.\n\nAccording to Camilleri, Bohr thought that the distinction between a wave view and a particle view was defined by a distinction between experimental setups, while, differing, Heisenberg thought that it was defined by the possibility of viewing the mathematical formulas as referring to waves or particles. Bohr thought that a particular experimental setup would display either a wave picture or a particle picture, but not both. Heisenberg thought that every mathematical formulation was capable of both wave and particle interpretations.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Camilleri | first1 = K | year = 2006 | title = Heisenberg and the wave\u2013particle duality | url = | journal = Stud.

He did, however, take the Heisenberg viewpoint, in so far as he thought that the wave function was always mathematically open to both interpretations. Eventually this led to his being considered unorthodox, partly because he did not accept Bohr's one-or-the-other view, preferring Heisenberg's always-both view. Another part of the reason for branding Land\u00e9 unorthodox was that he recited, as did Heisenberg, the [[Quantal translative momentum transfer|1923 work]]<ref name=\"Duane 1923\">[[William Duane (physicist)|Duane, W.]] (1923).

[[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]]\n:This [[thought experiment]] highlights the implications that accepting uncertainty at the microscopic level has on macroscopic objects.  A cat is put in a sealed box, with its life or death made dependent on the state of a subatomic particle.  Thus a description of the cat during the course of the experiment\u2014having been entangled with the state of a subatomic particle\u2014becomes a \"blur\" of \"living and dead cat.\"  But this can't be accurate because it implies the cat is actually both dead and alive until the box is opened to check on it.  But the cat, if it survives, will only remember being alive.  Schr\u00f6dinger resists \"so naively accepting as valid a 'blurred model' for representing reality.\"<ref>Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, in an article in the ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', 124, 323\u201338.</ref> ''How can the cat be both alive and dead?''\n\n:<u>The Copenhagen interpretation</u>: The wave function reflects our knowledge of the system. The wave function <math>(|\\text{dead}\\rangle + |\\text{alive}\\rangle)/\\sqrt 2</math> means that, once the cat is observed, there is a 50% chance it will be dead, and 50% chance it will be alive.\n\n2. [[Wigner's friend]]\n:Wigner puts his friend in with the cat. The external observer believes the system is in the state <math>(|\\text{dead}\\rangle + |\\text{alive}\\rangle)/\\sqrt 2</math>. His friend, however, is convinced that the cat is alive, i.e. for him, the cat is in the state <math>|\\text{alive}\\rangle</math>. ''How can Wigner and his friend see different wave functions?''\n\n:<u>The Copenhagen interpretation</u>: The answer depends on the positioning of [[Heisenberg cut]], which can be placed arbitrarily. If Wigner's friend is positioned on the same side of the cut as the external observer, his measurements collapse the wave function for both observers. If he is positioned on the cat's side, his interaction with the cat is not considered a measurement.\n\n3. [[Double-slit experiment|Double-slit]] [[diffraction]]\n:Light passes through double slits and onto a screen resulting in a diffraction pattern. ''Is light a particle or a wave?''\n\n:<u>The Copenhagen interpretation</u>: Light is neither. A particular experiment can demonstrate particle (photon) or wave properties, but not both at the same time ([[Complementarity (physics)|Bohr's complementarity principle]]).\n\n:The same experiment can in theory be performed with ''any'' physical system: electrons, protons, atoms, molecules, viruses, bacteria, cats, humans, elephants, planets, etc. In practice it has been performed for light, electrons, [[buckminsterfullerene]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.160401 |pmid=11690188 |title=Diffraction of Complex Molecules by Structures Made of Light |year=2001 |last1=Nairz |first1=Olaf |last2=Brezger |first2=Bj\u00f6rn |last3=Arndt |first3=Markus |last4=Zeilinger |first4=Anton |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=87 |issue=16|pages=160401 |arxiv = quant-ph/0110012 |bibcode = 2001PhRvL..87p0401N }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.100404 |title=Matter-Wave Interferometer for Large Molecules |year=2002 |last1=Brezger |first1=Bj\u00f6rn |last2=Hackerm\u00fcller |first2=Lucia |last3=Uttenthaler |first3=Stefan |last4=Petschinka |first4=Julia |last5=Arndt |first5=Markus |last6=Zeilinger |first6=Anton |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=88 |issue=10|arxiv = quant-ph/0202158 |bibcode = 2002PhRvL..88j0404B |pmid=11909334 |pages=100404}}</ref> and some atoms. Due to the smallness of [[Planck's constant]] it is practically impossible to realize experiments that directly reveal the wave nature of any system bigger than a few atoms but, in general, quantum mechanics considers all matter as possessing both particle and wave behaviors. The greater systems (like viruses, bacteria, cats, etc.) are considered as \"classical\" ones but only as an approximation, not exact.\n\n4. [[EPR paradox|EPR (Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen) paradox]]\n:Entangled \"particles\" are emitted in a single event. Conservation laws ensure that the measured spin of one particle must be the opposite of the measured spin of the other, so that if the spin of one particle is measured, the spin of the other particle is now instantaneously known. Because this outcome cannot be separated from quantum randomness, no information can be sent in this manner and there is no violation of either special relativity or the Copenhagen interpretation.\n\n:<u>The Copenhagen interpretation</u>: Assuming wave functions are not real, wave-function collapse is interpreted subjectively. The moment one observer measures the spin of one particle, he knows the spin of the other. However, another observer cannot benefit until the results of that measurement have been relayed to him, at less than or equal to the speed of light.\n\n:Copenhagenists claim that interpretations of quantum mechanics where the wave function is regarded as real have problems with EPR-type effects, since they imply that the laws of physics allow for influences to propagate at speeds greater than the speed of light. However, proponents of [[many worlds]]<ref>[http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#local Michael price on nonlocality in Many Worlds]</ref> and the [[transactional interpretation]]<ref>[http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/tiqm/TI_38.html#3.9 Relativity and Causality in the Transactional Interpretation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202142056/http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/tiqm/TI_38.html |date=2008-12-02 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/tiqm/TI_33.html#3.7 Collapse and Nonlocality in the Transactional Interpretation]</ref> (TI) maintain that Copenhagen interpretation is fatally non-local.\n\n:The claim that EPR effects violate the principle that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light have been countered by noting that they cannot be used for signaling because neither observer can control, or predetermine, what he observes, and therefore cannot manipulate what the other observer measures.\n\n==Criticism==\nThe completeness of quantum mechanics (thesis 1) was attacked by the [[EPR paradox|Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen thought experiment]] which was intended to show that quantum mechanics could not be a complete theory.\n\n[[bell test experiments|Experimental tests of]] [[Bell's inequality]] using particles have supported the quantum mechanical prediction of entanglement.\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation gives special status to measurement processes without clearly defining them or explaining their peculiar effects. In his article entitled \"Criticism and Counterproposals to the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Theory,\" countering the view of Alexandrov that  (in Heisenberg's paraphrase) \"the wave function in configuration space characterizes the objective state of the electron.\" Heisenberg says,\n\n{{quote|Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective features are to be brought into the description of nature. The observer has, rather, only the function of registering decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and it does not matter whether the observer is an apparatus or a human being; but the registration, i.e., the transition from the \"possible\" to the \"actual,\" is absolutely necessary here and cannot be omitted from the interpretation of quantum theory.<ref name=\"Heisenberg1958\">Werner Heisenberg, ''Physics and Philosophy'', Harper, 1958, p. 137.</ref>}}\n\nMany [[physicist]]s and [[philosopher]]s{{who|date=May 2018}} have objected to the Copenhagen interpretation, both on the grounds that it is non-deterministic and that it includes an undefined measurement process that converts probability functions into non-probabilistic measurements. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] comments \"I, at any rate, am convinced that He (God) does not throw dice.\"<ref>[[q:Einstein#Sourced|\"God does not throw dice\" quote]]</ref> and \"Do you really think the moon isn't there if you aren't looking at it?\"<ref>A.

Paul Arthur Shilpp, Harper, 1949, p. 211: \"...in spite of all divergencies of approach and opinion, a most humorous spirit animated the discussions.  On his side, Einstein mockingly asked us whether we could really believe that the providential authorities took recourse to dice-playing (\"''ob der liebe Gott w\u00fcrfelt''\"), to which I replied by pointing at the great caution, already called for by ancient thinkers, in ascribing attributes to Providence in everyday language.\"  Werner Heisenberg, who also attended the congress, recalled the exchange in ''Encounters with Einstein'', Princeton University Press, 1983, p. 117,: \"But he [Einstein] still stood by his watchword, which he clothed in the words: 'God does not play at dice.'  To which Bohr could only answer: 'But still, it cannot be for us to tell God, how he is to run the world.'\"</ref>\n\n[[Steven Weinberg]] in \"Einstein's Mistakes\", ''[[Physics Today]]'', November 2005, page 31, said:\n\n{{quote|All this familiar story is true, but it leaves out an irony. Bohr's version of quantum mechanics was deeply flawed, but not for the reason Einstein thought. The Copenhagen interpretation describes what happens when an observer makes a measurement, but the observer and the act of measurement are themselves treated classically. This is surely wrong: Physicists and their apparatus must be governed by the same quantum mechanical rules that govern everything else in the universe. But these rules are expressed in terms of a wave function (or, more precisely, a state vector) that evolves in a perfectly deterministic way. So where do the probabilistic rules of the Copenhagen interpretation come from?\n\nConsiderable progress has been made in recent years toward the resolution of the problem, which I cannot go into here. It is enough to say that neither Bohr nor Einstein had focused on the real problem with quantum mechanics. The Copenhagen rules clearly work, so they have to be accepted. But this leaves the task of explaining them by applying the deterministic equation for the evolution of the wave function, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, to observers and their apparatus.}}\n\nThe problem of thinking in terms of classical measurements of a quantum system becomes particularly acute in the field of [[quantum cosmology]], where the quantum system is the universe.<ref>'Since the Universe naturally contains\nall of its observers, the problem arises to come up with an interpretation of\nquantum theory that contains no classical realms on the fundamental level.', {{cite arXiv|eprint=quant-ph/0210152|author1=Claus Kiefer|title=On the interpretation of quantum theory \u2013 from Copenhagen to the present day|year=2002}}</ref>\n\n[[E.

The [[consistent histories]] interpretation advertises itself as \"Copenhagen done right\". Although the Copenhagen interpretation is often confused with the idea that [[consciousness causes collapse]], it defines an \"observer\" merely as that which collapses the wave function.<ref name=\"Heisenberg1958\" /> [[Quantum information]] theories are more recent, and have attracted growing support.<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.dailycamera.com/science-columnists/ci_22444536/kate-becker-quantum-physics-has-been-rankling-scientists\n | title=Quantum physics has been rankling scientists for decades\n | work=Boulder Daily Camera\n | author=Kate Becker\n | date=2013-01-25\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}\n</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| title=A Snapshot of Foundational Attitudes Toward Quantum Mechanics\n | journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics\n | volume=44\n | issue=3\n | pages=222\u2013230\n | date=2013-01-06\n | arxiv=1301.1069| last1=Schlosshauer\n | first1=Maximilian\n | last2=Kofler\n | first2=Johannes\n | last3=Zeilinger\n | first3=Anton\n | doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2013.04.004\n | bibcode=2013SHPMP..44..222S\n }}\n</ref>\n\nUnder [[Philosophical realism|realism]] and [[determinism]], if the wave function is regarded as ontologically real, and collapse is entirely rejected, a [[many worlds]] theory results.

Under [[Philosophical realism|realism]] and [[determinism]] (as well as non-localism), a [[hidden variable theory]] exists, e.g., the [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory|de Broglie\u2013Bohm interpretation]], which treats the wavefunction as real, position and momentum as definite and resulting from the expected values, and physical properties as spread in space.

[[Willy Brandt]], [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|German Minister for Foreign Affairs]], is speaking.]]\n\nThe future structure of the Council of Europe was discussed at a specific congress of several hundred leading politicians, government representatives and civil society in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]], in 1948. There were two schools of thought competing: some favoured a classical international organisation with representatives of governments, while others preferred a political forum with parliamentarians. Both approaches were finally combined through the creation of a Committee of Ministers (in which governments were represented) and a Consultative Assembly (in which parliaments were represented), the two main bodies mentioned in the Statute of the Council of Europe. This dual intergovernmental and inter-parliamentary structure was later copied for the [[European Communities]], [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]  and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]].\n\nThe Council of Europe was founded on 5 May 1949 by the [[Treaty of London (1949)|Treaty of London]]. The Statute was signed in London on that day by ten states: [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Three months later, on 10 August 1949, 100 members of the Council's Consultative Assembly, parliamentarians drawn from twelve nations (Turkey and Greece had by then joined the original ten founding members), met in Strasbourg for its first plenary session, held over 18 sittings and lasting nearly a month. They debated how to reconcile and reconstruct a continent still reeling from war, yet already facing a new East-West divide, launched the concept of a trans-national court to protect the basic human rights of every European citizen, and took the first steps towards what would in time become the [[European Union]]. \n\n=== Historic speeches at the Council of Europe ===\nIn 2018 an archive of all speeches made to the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] by heads of state or government since the Council of Europe's creation in 1949 appeared online, the fruit of a two-year project entitled [http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/Speeches/Speech-By-Country-EN.asp \"Voices of Europe\"]. At the time of its [http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-en.asp?newsid=7112&lang=2 launch], the archive comprised 263 speeches delivered over a 70-year period by some 216 Presidents, Prime Ministers, monarchs and religious leaders from 45 countries - though it continues to expand, as new speeches are added every few months. \n\nSome very early speeches by individuals considered to be \"founding fathers\" of the European institutions, even if they were not heads of state or government at the time, are also included (such as Sir [[Winston Churchill]] or [[Robert Schuman]]). Addresses by eight monarchs appear in the list (such as King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], King [[Albert II of Belgium]] and Grand Duke [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Henri of Luxembourg]]) as well as the speeches given by religious figures (such as [[Pope John Paul II]]) and several leaders from countries in the Middle East and North Africa (such as [[Shimon Peres]], [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Hosni Mubarak]], [[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]] or King [[Hussein of Jordan]]). \n\nThe full text of the speeches is given in both English and [http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/Speeches/Speech-By-Country-FR.asp French], regardless of the original language used. The archive is searchable by country, by name, and chronologically.\n\n== Aims and achievements ==\nArticle 1(a) of the Statute states that \"The aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic and social progress.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Statute of the Council of Europe|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/001.htm|website=conventions.coe.int|accessdate=19 December 2014}}</ref> Membership is open to all European states who seek harmony, cooperation, good governance and human rights, accepting the principle of the rule of law and are able and willing to guarantee democracy, fundamental human rights and freedoms.\n\nWhile the member states of the European Union transfer part of their national legislative and executive powers to the [[European Commission]] and the [[European Parliament]], Council of Europe member states maintain their sovereignty but commit themselves through conventions/treaties ([[international law]]) and co-operate on the basis of common values and common political decisions. Those conventions and decisions are developed by the member states working together at the Council of Europe. Both organisations function as concentric circles around the common foundations for European co-operation and harmony, with the Council of Europe being the geographically wider circle. The European Union could be seen as the smaller circle with a much higher level of integration through the transfer of powers from the national to the EU level. \"The Council of Europe and the European Union: different roles, shared values.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/european-union|title=The Council of Europe and the European Union|website=www.coe.int}}</ref> Council of Europe conventions/treaties are also open for signature to non-member states, thus facilitating equal co-operation with countries outside Europe.\n\nThe Council of Europe's most famous achievement is the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which was adopted in 1950 following a report by the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, and followed on from the United Nations '[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]' (UDHR).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org}}</ref> The Convention created the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in Strasbourg. The Court supervises compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and thus functions as the highest European court. It is to this court that Europeans can bring cases if they believe that a member country has violated their fundamental rights and freedoms.\n\nThe various activities and achievements of the Council of Europe can be found in detail on its official website.

The Assembly appoints members as rapporteurs with the mandate to prepare parliamentary reports on specific subjects. The British MP [[Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe]] was rapporteur for the drafting of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. [[Dick Marty]]'s reports on secret [[CIA]] detentions and rendition flights in Europe became quite famous in 2006 and 2007.

Protocol No. 14 of the Convention is designed to allow the EU to accede to it and the EU [[Treaty of Lisbon]] contains a protocol binding the EU to join.

Usually where it operates unanimously, it only needs to consult the Parliament. However, in most areas the [[ordinary legislative procedure]] applies meaning both Council and Parliament share legislative and budgetary powers equally, meaning both have to agree for a proposal to pass. In a few limited areas the Council may initiate new [[European Union law|EU law]] itself.<ref name=\"Consilium - Council\">{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|title = Council of the European Union|url=https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/council-eu_en|accessdate = 2017-02-19}}</ref>\n\nThe [[General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union]], also known as ''Council Secretariat'', assists the Council of the European Union, the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]], the [[European Council]] and the [[President of the European Council]]. The Secretariat is headed by the [[Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union]]. The Secretariat is divided into seven [[list of directorates-general of the Council of the European Union|directorates-general]], each administered by a [[director-general]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Politics of the European Union}}\n\n{{Further information|History of the European Union}}\nThe Council first appeared in the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) as the \"Special Council of Ministers\", set up to counterbalance the High Authority (the supranational executive, now the Commission). The original Council had limited powers: issues relating only to coal and steel were in the Authority's domain, and the Council's consent was only required on decisions outside coal and steel. As a whole, the Council only scrutinised the [[High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community|High Authority]] (the executive). In 1957, the [[Treaties of Rome]] established two new communities, and with them two new Councils: the Council of the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (EAEC) and the Council of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC). However, due to objections over the supranational power of the Authority, their Councils had more powers; the new executive bodies were known as \"Commissions\".<ref name=\"ENA history\">{{cite web|publisher = [[European NAvigator]]|title = Council of the European Union|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=5604|accessdate = 2007-06-24}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965 the Council was hit by the \"empty chair crisis\". Due to disagreements between [[French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] and the Commission's agriculture proposals, among other things, France boycotted all meetings of the Council. This halted the Council's work until the impasse was resolved the following year by the [[Luxembourg compromise]]. Although initiated by a gamble of the President of the Commission, [[Walter Hallstein]], who later on lost the Presidency, the crisis exposed flaws in the Council's workings.<ref name=\"LSE Chair\">{{cite web|last=Ludlow|first=N|year=2006|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|title = De-commissioning the Empty Chair Crisis : the Community institutions and the crisis of 1965\u20136|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2422/01/Decommisioningempty.pdf|accessdate = 2007-09-24|format=PDF|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025203706/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2422/01/Decommisioningempty.pdf |archivedate = 25 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Merger Treaty]] of 1967, the ECSC's Special Council of Ministers and the Council of the EAEC (together with their other independent institutions) were merged into the '''Council of the EEC''', which would act as a single Council of the [[European Communities]]. In 1993, the Council adopted the name 'Council of the European Union', following the establishment of the European Union by the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. That treaty strengthened the Council, with the addition of more intergovernmental elements in the [[Three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]] system. However, at the same time the Parliament and Commission had been strengthened inside the [[European Community|Community pillar]], curtailing the ability of the Council to act independently.<ref name=\"ENA history\"/>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Lisbon]] abolished the pillar system and gave further powers to Parliament. It also merged the Council's [[High Representative]] with the [[European Commissioner for External Relations|Commission's foreign policy head]], with this new figure chairing the foreign affairs Council rather than the rotating presidency. The [[European Council]] was declared a separate institution from the Council, also chaired by a permanent president, and the different Council configurations were mentioned in the treaties for the first time.<ref name=\"Const Info\"/>\n\nThe development of the Council has been characterised by the rise in power of the Parliament, with which the Council has had to share its legislative powers. The Parliament has often provided opposition to the Council's wishes. This has in some cases led to clashes between both bodies with the Council's system of intergovernmentalism contradicting the developing parliamentary system and supranational principles.<ref name=\"Hoskyns\">{{cite book| last = Hoskyns | first = Catherine |author2=Michael Newman | title = Democratizing the European Union: Issues for the twenty-first Century (Perspectives on Democratization | publisher = [[Manchester University Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-7190-5666-6 }}</ref>\n\n== Powers and functions ==\nThe primary purpose of the Council is to act as one of the two chambers of the [[Legislature of the European Union|EU's legislative branch]], the other chamber being the [[European Parliament]]. It also holds, jointly with the Parliament, the budgetary power of the Union and has greater control than the Parliament over the more intergovernmental areas of the EU, such as foreign policy and macroeconomic co-ordination. Finally, before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, it formally held the executive power of the EU which it conferred upon the [[European Commission]].<ref name=\"Legislative power\">{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|title=Legislative power|url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&pageRank=2&language=EN|accessdate = 2007-07-11}}</ref><ref name=\"Treaty\">{{cite web|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Treaty on the European Union (Nice consolidated version)|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf|accessdate = 2007-06-24|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n=== Legislative procedure ===\n{{Main article|European Union legislative procedure}}\n[[File:Ordinary legislative procedure majorityrules.svg|thumb|300px|Simplified illustration of the voting rules that apply within the ordinary legislative procedure. The actual procedure involves various stages of consultations aimed at achieving compromise between the positions of the two legislative chambers.]]\nThe EU's legislative authority is divided between the Council and the Parliament. As the relationships and powers of these institutions have developed, various legislative procedures have been created for adopting laws.<ref name=\"Legislative power\"/> In early times, the ''avis facultatif'' maxim was: \"The Commission proposes, and the Council disposes\";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/highlights/en/103.html|title=News - Archives - Highlights - Codecision and other procedures|website=www.europarl.europa.eu}}</ref> but now the vast majority of laws are now subject to the [[ordinary legislative procedure]], which works on the principle that consent from both the Council and Parliament are required before a law may be adopted.<ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = The Codecision Procedure|url=http://ec.europa.eu/codecision/procedure/index_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-07-11}}</ref>\n\nUnder this procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council. Following its first [[Reading (legislature)|reading]] the Parliament may propose amendments. If the Council accepts these amendments then the legislation is approved. If it does not then it adopts a \"common position\" and submits that new version to the Parliament. At its second reading, if the Parliament approves the text or does not act, the text is adopted, otherwise the Parliament may propose further amendments to the Council's proposal. It may be rejected out right by an [[absolute majority]] of MEPs. If the Council still does not approve the Parliament's position, then the text is taken to a \"Conciliation Committee\" composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs. If a Committee manages to adopt a joint text, it then has to be approved in a third reading by both the Council and Parliament or the proposal is abandoned.<ref name=\"Parliament's powers\">{{cite web|title=Codecision procedure|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&pageRank=4&language=EN|accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref>\n\nThe few other areas that operate the ''special legislative procedures'' are justice & home affairs, budget and taxation and certain aspects of other policy areas: such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy. In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone.<ref name=\"lisbon explain\"/><ref name=\"decision making\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Decision-making in the European Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://www.europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=2007-09-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040316/http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|archivedate=11 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The procedure used also depends upon which type of [[European Union law#Legislation|institutional act]] is being used. The strongest act is a [[Regulation (European Union)|regulation]], an [[Act of Parliament|act]] or [[Statutory law|law]] which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are [[Directive (European Union)|directives]] which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve, but they do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A [[European Union decision|decision]] is an instrument which is focused at a particular person or group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue [[European Union recommendation|recommendations and opinions]] which are merely non-binding declarations.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Community legal instruments|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/community_legal_instruments_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=2007-09-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708114002/http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/community_legal_instruments_en.htm|archivedate=8 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Council votes in one of three ways; [[unanimity]], [[Majority|simple majority]], or [[qualified majority]]. In most cases, the Council votes on issues by [[Voting in the Council of the European Union|qualified majority voting]], meaning that there must be a minimum of 55% of member states agreeing (at least 15) who together represent at least 65% of the EU population.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Voting system|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/|doi=|accessdate=2017-07-27}}</ref> A 'blocking minority' can only be formed by at least 4 member states representing at least 35% of the EU population.\n\n=== Foreign affairs ===\n{{one source|section|date=December 2015}}\nThe legal instruments used by the Council for the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] are different from the legislative acts. Under the CFSP they consist of \"common positions\", \"joint actions\", and \"common strategies\". Common positions relate to defining a European foreign policy towards a particular third-country such as the promotion of human rights and democracy in [[Myanmar]], a region such as the stabilisation efforts in the [[African Great Lakes]], or a certain issue such as support for the [[International Criminal Court]]. A common position, once agreed, is binding on all EU states who must follow and defend the policy, which is regularly revised. A joint action refers to a co-ordinated action of the states to deploy resources to achieve an objective, for example for mine clearing or to combat the spread of [[small arms]]. Common strategies defined an objective and commits the EUs resources to that task for four years.<ref name=\"FR instru\">{{cite web|publisher = [[French Foreign Ministry]]|title = Joint actions, common positions and common strategies|url = http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/european-union_157/eu-in-the-world_1491/common-foreign-and-security-policy_5463/operation-of-the-cfsp_5467/cfsp-decision-making-processes-and-instruments_5473/joint-actions-common-positions-and-common-strategies_8752.html|accessdate = 2007-10-14|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071018111907/http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/european-union_157/eu-in-the-world_1491/common-foreign-and-security-policy_5463/operation-of-the-cfsp_5467/cfsp-decision-making-processes-and-instruments_5473/joint-actions-common-positions-and-common-strategies_8752.html|archivedate = 18 October 2007|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Budgetary authority ===\nFurthermore, the legislative branch officially holds the Union's budgetary authority. The [[Budget of the European Union|EU's budget]] (which is around 155 billion [[euro]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mff/figures/index_en.cfm|title=Multiannual Financial Framework-European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu}}</ref> is subject to a form of the ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving Parliament power over the entire budget (prior to 2009, its influence was limited to certain areas) on an equal footing to the Council. If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. But if the joint conciliation text is not approved, the Parliament may adopt the budget definitively.<ref name=\"lisbon explain\">{{cite web|title = Explaining the Treaty of Lisbon|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa website]]|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/09/531|accessdate = 2009-12-04 }}</ref> In addition to the budget, the Council coordinates the economic policy of members.<ref name=\"Consilium - Council\"/>\n\n== Organisation ==\nThe Council's rules of procedure contain the provisions necessary for its organisation and functioning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=URISERV:o10003|title=EUR-Lex - o10003 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref>\n\n=== Presidency ===\n{{Main article|Presidency of the Council of the European Union}}\nThe Presidency of the Council is not a single post, but is held by a member state's government. Every six months the presidency rotates between the states, in an order predefined by the Council's members, allowing each state to preside over the body. From 2007, every three member states co-operate for their combined eighteen months on a common agenda, although only one formally holds the presidency for the normal six-month period. For example, the President for the second half of 2007, Portugal, was the second in a trio of states alongside Germany and [[Slovenia]] with whom Portugal had been co-operating. The Council meets in various configurations (as outlined below) so its membership changes depending upon the issue. The person chairing the Council will always be the member from the state holding the Presidency. A delegate from the following Presidency also assists the presiding member and may take over work if requested.<ref name=\"Pres DE\">{{cite web|publisher = 2007 German Presidency website|title = What is the Presidency?|url = http://www.eu2007.de/en/The_Council_Presidency/What_is_the_Presidency/index.html|accessdate = 2007-06-24|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070701001206/http://www.eu2007.de/en/The_Council_Presidency/What_is_the_Presidency/index.html|archivedate = 1 July 2007|df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Pres PT\">{{cite web|publisher = 2007 Portuguese Presidency website|title = The Presidency|url=http://www.eu2007.pt/UE/vEN/Presidencia_Conselho/A_Presidencia/default_.htm|accessdate = 2007-10-14|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071020220019/http://www.eu2007.pt/UE/vEN/Presidencia_Conselho/A_Presidencia/default_.htm |archivedate = 20 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The exception however is the foreign affairs council, which has been chaired by the [[High Representative]] since the entry into force of the [[Lisbon Treaty]].<ref name=\"Const Info\"/>\n\nThe role of the Presidency is administrative and political. On the administrative side it is responsible for procedures and organising the work of the Council during its term. This includes summoning the Council for meetings along with directing the work of [[COREPER]] and other committees and working groups. The political element is the role of successfully dealing with issues and mediating in the Council. In particular this includes setting the agenda of the council, hence giving the Presidency substantial influence in the work of the Council during its term. The Presidency also plays a major role in representing the Council within the EU and representing the EU internationally, for example at the United Nations.<ref name=\"Pres PT\"/><ref name=\"Pres FI\">{{cite web|publisher = 2007 Finnish Presidency website|title = The presidency in general|url=http://www.eu2006.fi/the_presidency/en_GB/the_presidency_in_general/|accessdate = 2007-10-14|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061003140815/http://www.eu2006.fi/the_presidency/en_GB/the_presidency_in_general/ |archivedate = 3 October 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)]]|title = Council Decision of 15 September 2006 adopting the Council's Rules of Procedure |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:285:0047:0048:EN:PDF|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-11-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Configurations ===\nLegally speaking, the Council is a single entity (this means that technically any Council configuration can adopt decisions that fall within the remit of any other Council configuration)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/decision-making/|title=The decision-making process in the Council - Consilium|website=www.consilium.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}</ref> but it is in practice divided into several different council configurations (or \u2018(con)formations\u2019).

It shall prepare and ensure the follow-up to meetings of the European Council, in liaison with the President of the European Council and the Commission.\n\nThe Foreign Affairs Council shall elaborate the Union's external action on the basis of strategic guidelines laid down by the European Council and ensure that the Union's action is consistent.}}\n\nEach council configuration deals with a different functional area, for example agriculture and fisheries. In this formation, the council is composed of ministers from each state government who are responsible for this area: the agriculture and fisheries ministers. The [[Chair (official)|chair]] of this council is held by the member from the state holding the presidency (see section above). Similarly, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council is composed of national finance ministers, and they are still one per state and the chair is held by the member coming from the presiding country. The Councils meet irregularly throughout the year except for the three major configurations (top three below) which meet once a month.

A [[Category (mathematics)|category]] has two basic properties: the ability to [[Function composition|compose]] the arrows [[Associativity|associatively]] and the existence of an [[Identity function|identity]] arrow for each object. The language of category theory has been used to formalize concepts of other high-level [[abstractions]] such as [[set theory|sets]], [[ring theory|rings]], and [[group theory|groups]].\n\nSeveral terms used in category theory, including the term \"morphism\", are used differently from their uses in the rest of mathematics. In category theory, morphisms obey conditions specific to category theory itself.\n\n[[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] introduced the concepts of categories, [[functor]]s, and [[natural transformation]]s in 1942\u201345 in their study of [[algebraic topology]], with the goal of understanding the processes that preserve mathematical structure.\n\nCategory theory has practical applications in [[programming language theory]], for example the usage of [[Monad (functional programming)|monads in functional programming]].   It may also be used as an axiomatic foundation for mathematics, as an alternative to [[set theory]] and other proposed foundations.\n\n==Basic concepts  ==\nCategories represent abstractions of other mathematical concepts.\nMany areas of mathematics can be formalised by category theory as [[category (mathematics)|categories]]. Hence category theory uses abstraction to make it possible to state and prove many intricate and subtle mathematical results in these fields in a much simpler way.<ref>{{cite book|last=Geroch|first=Robert|title=Mathematical physics|year=1985|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-28862-8|pages=7|edition=[Repr.]|quote=Note that theorem 3 is actually easier for categories in general than it is for the special case of sets. This phenomenon is by no means rare.}}<!--|accessdate=20 August 2012--></ref>\n\nA basic example of a category is the [[category of sets]], where the objects are sets and the arrows are functions from one set to another.  However, the objects of a category need not be sets, and the arrows need not be functions. Any way of formalising a mathematical concept such that it meets the basic conditions on the behaviour of objects and arrows is a valid category\u2014and all the results of category theory apply to it.\n\nThe \"arrows\" of category theory are often said to represent a process connecting two objects, or in many cases a \"structure-preserving\" transformation connecting two objects. There are, however, many applications where much more abstract concepts are represented by objects and morphisms. The most important property of the arrows is that they can be \"composed\", in other words, arranged in a sequence to form a new arrow.\n\n== Applications of categories==\nCategories now appear in many branches of mathematics, some areas of [[theoretical computer science]] where they can correspond to [[Data type|types]] or to [[database schema]]s, and [[mathematical physics]] where they can be used to describe [[vector space]]s.<ref>B.

A systematic study of category theory then allows us to prove general results about any of these types of mathematical structures from the axioms of a category.\n\nConsider the following example. The [[class (set theory)|class]] '''Grp''' of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] consists of all objects having a \"group structure\". One can proceed to [[mathematical proof|prove]] [[theorem]]s about groups by making logical deductions from the set of axioms defining groups. For example, it is immediately proven from the axioms that the [[identity element]] of a group is unique.\n\nInstead of focusing merely on the individual objects (e.g., groups) possessing a given structure, category theory emphasizes the [[morphism]]s \u2013 the structure-preserving mappings \u2013 ''between'' these objects; by studying these morphisms, one is able to learn more about the structure of the objects. In the case of groups, the morphisms are the [[group homomorphism]]s. A group homomorphism between two groups \"preserves the group structure\" in a precise sense; informally it is a \"process\" taking one group to another, in a way that carries along information about the structure of the first group into the second group. The study of group homomorphisms then provides a tool for studying general properties of groups and consequences of the group axioms.\n\nA similar type of investigation occurs in many mathematical theories, such as the study of [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] maps (morphisms) between [[topological space]]s in [[topology]] (the associated category is called '''Top'''), and the study of [[smooth function]]s (morphisms) in [[manifold theory]].\n\nNot all categories arise as \"structure preserving (set) functions\", however; the standard example is the category of homotopies between [[pointed topological space]]s.\n\nIf one axiomatizes [[Finitary relation|relations]] instead of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], one obtains the theory of [[Allegory (category theory)|allegories]].\n\n=== Functors ===\n{{Main|Functor}}\n{{See also|Adjoint functors#Motivation}}\n\nA category is ''itself'' a type of mathematical structure, so we can look for \"processes\" which preserve this structure in some sense; such a process is called a [[functor]].\n\n[[Diagram chasing]] is a visual method of arguing with abstract \"arrows\" joined in diagrams. Functors are represented by arrows between categories, subject to specific defining commutativity conditions. Functors can define (construct) categorical diagrams and sequences (viz. Mitchell, 1965){{citation needed|date=September 2018}}. A functor associates to every object of one category an object of another category, and to every morphism in the first category a morphism in the second.\n\nAs a result, this defines a category ''of categories and functors'' \u2013 the objects are categories, and the morphisms (between categories) are functors.\n\nStudying categories and functors is not just studying a class of mathematical structures and the morphisms between them but rather the ''relationships between various classes of mathematical structures''. This fundamental idea first surfaced in [[algebraic topology]]. Difficult ''topological'' questions can be translated into ''algebraic'' questions which are often easier to solve.  Basic constructions, such as the [[fundamental group]] or the [[fundamental groupoid]] of a [[topological space]], can be expressed as functors to the category of [[groupoid]]s in this way, and the concept is pervasive in algebra and its applications.\n\n=== Natural transformations ===\n{{Main|Natural transformation}}\n\nAbstracting yet again, some diagrammatic and/or sequential constructions are often \"naturally related\" \u2013 a vague notion, at first sight. This leads to the clarifying concept of [[natural transformation]], a way to \"map\" one functor to another. Many important constructions in mathematics can be studied in this context. \"Naturality\" is a principle, like [[general covariance]] in physics, that cuts deeper than is initially apparent. An arrow between two functors is a natural transformation when it is subject to certain naturality or commutativity conditions.\n\nFunctors and natural transformations ('naturality') are the key concepts in category theory.<ref>{{harvnb|Mac Lane|1998|loc=p. 18: \"As Eilenberg-Mac Lane first observed, 'category' has been defined in order to be able to define 'functor' and 'functor' has been defined in order to be able to define 'natural transformation'.\"}}</ref>\n\n== Categories, objects, and morphisms ==\n{{Main|Category (mathematics)|Morphism}}\n\n=== Categories ===\nA ''category'' ''C'' consists of the following three mathematical entities:\n* A [[Class (set theory)|class]] ob(''C''), whose elements are called ''objects'';\n* A class hom(''C''), whose elements are called [[morphism]]s or [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] or ''arrows''. Each morphism '''''f''''' has a ''source object '''a''''' and ''target object '''b'''''. <br />The expression {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''a'' \u2192 ''b''}}, would be verbally stated as \"''f'' is a morphism from ''a'' to ''b''\".<br />The expression {{nowrap|1='''hom(''a'', ''b'')'''}} \u2013 alternatively expressed as {{nowrap|1='''hom<sub>''C''</sub>(''a'', ''b'')'''}}, {{nowrap|1='''mor(''a'', ''b'')'''}}, or {{nowrap|1='''''C''(''a'', ''b'')'''}} \u2013 denotes the ''hom-class'' of all morphisms from ''a'' to ''b''.\n* A [[binary operation]] \u2218, called ''composition of morphisms'', such that for any three objects ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', we have {{nowrap|1=\u2218 : hom(''b'', ''c'') \u00d7 hom(''a'', ''b'') \u2192 hom(''a'', ''c'')}}. The composition of {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''a'' \u2192 ''b''}} and {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''b'' \u2192 ''c''}} is written as {{nowrap|1=''g'' \u2218 ''f''}} or ''gf'',{{efn|Some authors compose in the opposite order, writing ''fg'' or {{nowrap|1=''f'' \u2218 ''g''}} for {{nowrap|1=''g'' \u2218 ''f''}}.  Computer scientists using category theory very commonly write {{nowrap|1=''f'' ; ''g''}} for {{nowrap|1=''g'' \u2218 ''f''}}}} governed by two axioms:\n** [[Associativity]]: If {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''a'' \u2192 ''b''}}, {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''b'' \u2192 ''c''}} and {{nowrap|1=''h'' : ''c'' \u2192 ''d''}} then {{nowrap|1=''h'' \u2218  (''g'' \u2218 ''f'') = (''h'' \u2218 ''g'') \u2218 ''f''}}, and\n** [[Identity (mathematics)|Identity]]: For every object ''x'', there exists a morphism {{nowrap|1=1<sub>''x''</sub> : ''x'' \u2192 ''x''}} called the ''[[identity morphism]] for x'', such that for every morphism {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''a'' \u2192 ''b''}}, we have {{nowrap|1=1<sub>''b''</sub> \u2218 ''f'' = ''f'' = ''f'' \u2218 1<sub>''a''</sub>}}.\n:: From the axioms, it can be proved that there is exactly one [[identity morphism]] for every object. Some authors deviate from the definition just given by identifying each object with its identity morphism.\n\n=== Morphisms ===\nRelations among morphisms (such as {{nowrap|1=''fg'' = ''h''}}) are often depicted using [[commutative diagram]]s, with \"points\" (corners) representing objects and \"arrows\" representing morphisms.\n\n[[Morphism]]s can have any of the following properties. A morphism {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''a'' \u2192 ''b''}} is a:\n* [[monomorphism]] (or ''monic'') if {{nowrap|1=''f'' \u2218 ''g''<sub>1</sub> = ''f'' \u2218 ''g''<sub>2</sub>}} implies {{nowrap|1=''g''<sub>1</sub> = ''g''<sub>2</sub>}} for all morphisms {{nowrap|1=''g''<sub>1</sub>, ''g<sub>2</sub>'' : ''x'' \u2192 ''a''}}.\n* [[epimorphism]] (or ''epic'') if {{nowrap|1=''g''<sub>1</sub> \u2218 ''f'' = ''g''<sub>2</sub> \u2218 ''f''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''g<sub>1</sub>'' = ''g<sub>2</sub>''}} for all morphisms {{nowrap|1=''g<sub>1</sub>'', ''g<sub>2</sub>'' : ''b'' \u2192 ''x''}}.\n* ''bimorphism'' if ''f'' is both epic and monic.\n* [[isomorphism]] if there exists a morphism {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''b'' \u2192 ''a''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''f'' \u2218 ''g'' = 1<sub>''b''</sub> and ''g'' \u2218 ''f'' = 1<sub>''a''</sub>}}.{{efn|Note that a morphism that is both epic and monic is not necessarily an isomorphism! An elementary counterexample: in the category consisting of two objects ''A'' and ''B'', the identity morphisms, and a single morphism ''f'' from ''A'' to ''B'', ''f'' is both epic and monic but is not an isomorphism.}}\n* [[endomorphism]] if {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}}. end(''a'') denotes the class of endomorphisms of ''a''.\n* [[automorphism]] if ''f'' is both an endomorphism and an isomorphism. aut(''a'') denotes the class of automorphisms of ''a''.\n* [[retract (category theory)|retraction]] if a right inverse of ''f'' exists, i.e. if there exists a morphism {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''b'' \u2192 ''a''}} with {{nowrap|1=''f'' \u2218 ''g'' = 1<sub>''b''</sub>}}.\n* [[section (category theory)|section]] if a left inverse of ''f'' exists, i.e. if there exists a morphism {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''b'' \u2192 ''a''}} with {{nowrap|1=''g'' \u2218 ''f'' = 1<sub>''a''</sub>}}.\n\nEvery retraction is an epimorphism, and every section is a monomorphism. Furthermore, the following three statements are equivalent:\n* ''f'' is a monomorphism and a retraction;\n* ''f'' is an epimorphism and a section;\n* ''f'' is an isomorphism.\n\n==Functors==\n{{Main|Functor}}\n\n[[Functor]]s are structure-preserving maps between categories. They can be thought of as morphisms in the category of all (small) categories.\n\nA ('''covariant''') functor ''F'' from a category ''C'' to a category ''D'', written {{nowrap|1=''F'' : ''C'' \u2192 ''D''}}, consists of:\n* for each object ''x'' in ''C'', an object ''F''(''x'') in ''D''; and\n* for each morphism {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''x'' \u2192 ''y''}} in ''C'', a morphism {{nowrap|1=''F''(''f'') : ''F''(''x'') \u2192 ''F''(''y'')}},\n\nsuch that the following two properties hold:\n* For every object ''x'' in ''C'', {{nowrap|1=''F''(1<sub>''x''</sub>) = 1<sub>''F''(''x'')</sub>}};\n* For all morphisms {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''x'' \u2192 ''y''}} and {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''y'' \u2192 ''z''}}, {{nowrap|1=''F''(''g'' \u2218 ''f'') = ''F''(''g'') \u2218 ''F''(''f'')}}.\n\nA '''contravariant''' functor {{nowrap|1=''F'': ''C'' \u2192 ''D''}} is like a covariant functor, except that it \"turns morphisms around\" (\"reverses all the arrows\"). More specifically, every morphism {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''x'' \u2192 ''y''}} in ''C'' must be assigned to a morphism  {{nowrap|1=''F''(''f'') : ''F''(''y'') \u2192 ''F''(''x'')}} in ''D''. In other words, a contravariant functor acts as a covariant functor from the [[opposite category]] ''C''<sup>op</sup> to ''D''.\n\n==Natural transformations==\n{{Main|Natural transformation}}\n\nA ''natural transformation'' is a relation between two functors. Functors often describe \"natural constructions\" and natural transformations then describe \"natural homomorphisms\" between two such constructions. Sometimes two quite different constructions yield \"the same\" result; this is expressed by a natural isomorphism between the two functors.\n\nIf ''F'' and ''G'' are (covariant) functors between the categories ''C'' and ''D'', then a natural transformation \u03b7 from ''F'' to ''G'' associates to every object ''X'' in ''C'' a morphism {{nowrap|1=\u03b7<sub>''X''</sub> : ''F''(''X'') \u2192 ''G''(''X'')}} in ''D'' such that for every morphism {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} in ''C'', we have {{nowrap|1=\u03b7<sub>''Y''</sub> \u2218 ''F''(''f'') = ''G''(''f'') \u2218 \u03b7<sub>''X''</sub>}}; this means that the following diagram is [[commutative diagram|commutative]]:\n\n[[Image:Natural transformation.svg|175px|center|Commutative diagram defining natural transformations]]\n\nThe two functors ''F'' and ''G'' are called ''naturally isomorphic'' if there exists a natural transformation from ''F'' to ''G'' such that \u03b7<sub>''X''</sub> is an isomorphism for every object ''X'' in ''C''.\n\n==Other concepts==\n\n===Universal constructions, limits, and colimits===\n{{Main|Universal property|Limit (category theory)}}\n\nUsing the language of category theory, many areas of mathematical study can be categorized. Categories include sets, groups and topologies.\n\nEach category is distinguished by properties that all its objects have in common, such as the [[empty set]] or the [[product topology|product of two topologies]], yet in the definition of a category, objects are considered atomic, i.e., we ''do not know'' whether an object ''A'' is a set, a topology, or any other abstract concept. Hence, the challenge is to define special objects without referring to the internal structure of those objects. To define the empty set without referring to elements, or the product topology without referring to open sets, one can characterize these objects in terms of their relations to other objects, as given by the morphisms of the respective categories. Thus, the task is to find ''[[universal property|universal properties]]'' that uniquely determine the objects of interest.\n\nNumerous important constructions can be described in a purely categorical way if the ''[[category theory|category limit]]'' can be developed and dualized to yield the notion of a ''colimit''.\n\n===Equivalent categories===\n{{Main|Equivalence of categories|Isomorphism of categories}}\n\nIt is a natural question to ask: under which conditions can two categories be considered ''essentially the same'', in the sense that theorems about one category can readily be transformed into theorems about the other category? The major tool one employs to describe such a situation is called ''equivalence of categories'', which is given by appropriate functors between two categories. Categorical equivalence has found [[Equivalence of categories#Examples|numerous applications]] in mathematics.\n\n===Further concepts and results===\nThe definitions of categories and functors provide only the very basics of categorical algebra; additional important topics are listed below. Although there are strong interrelations between all of these topics, the given order can be considered as a guideline for further reading.\n* The [[functor category]] ''D''<sup>''C''</sup> has as objects the functors from ''C'' to ''D'' and as morphisms the natural transformations of such functors. The [[Yoneda lemma]] is one of the most famous basic results of category theory; it describes representable functors in functor categories.\n* [[Dual (category theory)|Duality]]: Every statement, theorem, or definition in category theory has a ''dual'' which is essentially obtained by \"reversing all the arrows\". If one statement is true in a category ''C'' then its dual is true in the dual category ''C''<sup>op</sup>. This duality, which is transparent at the level of category theory, is often obscured in applications and can lead to surprising relationships.\n* [[Adjoint functors]]: A functor can be left (or right) adjoint to another functor that maps in the opposite direction. Such a pair of adjoint functors typically arises from a construction defined by a universal property; this can be seen as a more abstract and powerful view on universal properties.\n\n===Higher-dimensional categories===\n{{Main|Higher category theory}}\nMany of the above concepts, especially equivalence of categories, adjoint functor pairs, and functor categories, can be situated into the context of ''higher-dimensional categories''. Briefly, if we consider a morphism between two objects as a \"process taking us from one object to another\", then higher-dimensional categories allow us to profitably generalize this by considering \"higher-dimensional processes\".\n\nFor example, a (strict) [[2-category]] is a category together with \"morphisms between morphisms\", i.e., processes which allow us to transform one morphism into another. We can then \"compose\" these \"bimorphisms\" both horizontally and vertically, and we require a 2-dimensional \"exchange law\" to hold, relating the two composition laws. In this context, the standard example is '''Cat''', the 2-category of all (small) categories, and in this example, bimorphisms of morphisms are simply [[natural transformation]]s of morphisms in the usual sense. Another basic example is to consider a 2-category with a single object; these are essentially [[monoidal category|monoidal categories]]. [[bicategory|Bicategories]] are a weaker notion of 2-dimensional categories in which the composition of morphisms is not strictly associative, but only associative \"up to\" an isomorphism.\n\nThis process can be extended for all [[natural number]]s ''n'', and these are called [[n-category|''n''-categories]]. There is even a notion of ''[[quasi-category|\u03c9-category]]'' corresponding to the [[ordinal number]] [[\u03c9 (ordinal number)|\u03c9]].\n\nHigher-dimensional categories are part of the broader mathematical field of [[higher-dimensional algebra]], a concept introduced by [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronald Brown]].  For a conversational introduction to these ideas, see [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week73.html John Baez, 'A Tale of ''n''-categories' (1996).]\n\n==Historical notes==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}\n{{main|Timeline of category theory and related mathematics}}\n{{rquote|right|It should be observed first that the whole concept of a  category is essentially an auxiliary one; our basic concepts are essentially those of a functor and of a natural transformation [...]|[[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]]|General theory of natural equivalences<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eilenberg|first=Samuel|last2=MacLane|first2=Saunders|date=1945|title=General theory of natural equivalences|url=https://www.ams.org/tran/1945-058-00/S0002-9947-1945-0013131-6/|journal=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society|volume=58|pages=247|doi=10.1090/S0002-9947-1945-0013131-6|issn=0002-9947}}</ref>}}\nIn 1942\u201345, [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] introduced categories, functors, and natural transformations as part of their work in topology, especially [[algebraic topology]]. Their work was an important part of the transition from intuitive and geometric [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] to [[axiom]]atic [[homology theory]]. Eilenberg and Mac Lane later wrote that their goal was to understand natural transformations. That required defining functors, which required categories.\n\n[[Stanislaw Ulam]], and some writing on his behalf, have claimed that related ideas were current in the late 1930s in Poland. Eilenberg was Polish, and studied mathematics in Poland in the 1930s. Category theory is also, in some sense, a continuation of the work of [[Emmy Noether]] (one of Mac Lane's teachers) in formalizing abstract processes; Noether realized that understanding a type of mathematical structure requires understanding the processes that preserve that structure. To achieve this understanding, Eilenberg and Mac Lane proposed an axiomatic formalization of the relation between structures and the processes that preserve them.\n\nThe subsequent development of category theory was powered first by the computational needs of [[homological algebra]], and later by the axiomatic needs of [[algebraic geometry]]. General category theory, an extension of [[universal algebra]] having many new features allowing for [[semantic]] flexibility and [[higher-order logic]], came later; it is now applied throughout mathematics.\n\nCertain categories called [[topos|topoi]] (singular ''topos'') can even serve as an alternative to [[axiomatic set theory]] as a foundation of mathematics. A topos can also be considered as a specific type of category with two additional topos axioms. These foundational applications of category theory have been worked out in fair detail as a basis for, and justification of, [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]]. [[Topos|Topos theory]] is a form of abstract [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf theory]], with geometric origins, and leads to ideas such as [[pointless topology]].\n\n[[Categorical logic]] is now a well-defined field based on [[type theory]] for [[intuitionistic logic]]s, with applications in [[functional programming]] and [[domain theory]], where a [[cartesian closed category]] is taken as a non-syntactic description of a [[lambda calculus]]. At the very least, category theoretic language clarifies what exactly these related areas have in common (in some [[wikt:abstract|abstract]] sense).\n\nCategory theory has been applied in other fields as well. For example, [[John Baez]] has shown a link between [[Feynman diagrams]] in Physics and monoidal categories.<ref name=\"Baez09\">{{cite arxiv |first1=J.C. |last1=Baez |first2=M. |last2=Stay |title=Physics, topology, logic and computation: A Rosetta stone |year=2009 |eprint=0903.0340 |class=quant-ph }}</ref> Another application of category theory, more specifically: topos theory, has been made in mathematical music theory, see for example the book ''The Topos of Music, Geometric Logic of Concepts, Theory, and Performance'' by [[Guerino Mazzola]].\n\nMore recent efforts to introduce undergraduates to categories as a foundation for mathematics include those of [[William Lawvere]] and Rosebrugh (2003) and Lawvere and [[Stephen Schanuel]] (1997) and Mirroslav Yotov (2012).\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Category theory|Mathematics}}\n* [[Domain theory]]\n* [[Enriched category|Enriched category theory]]\n* [[Glossary of category theory]]\n* [[Group theory]]\n* [[Higher category theory]]\n* [[Higher-dimensional algebra]]\n* [[List of publications in mathematics#Category theory|Important publications in category theory]]\n* [[Lambda calculus]]\n* [[Outline of category theory]]\n* [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{cite book |title = Abstract and Concrete Categories |last1 = Ad\u00e1mek |first1 = Ji\u0159\u00ed |last2 = Herrlich |first2 = Horst |last3 = Strecker |first3 = George E. |publisher = Heldermann Verlag Berlin |year = 2004 |url = http://katmat.math.uni-bremen.de/acc/acc.htm }}\n* {{citation\n | last1 = Barr | first1 = Michael | author1-link = Michael Barr (mathematician)\n | last2 = Wells | first2 = Charles | author2-link = Charles Wells (mathematician)\n | edition = 3rd\n | series = Reprints in Theory and Applications of Categories\n | title = Category Theory for Computing Science\n | url = http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/22/tr22abs.html\n | volume = 22\n | year = 2012\n}}.\n* {{citation\n | last1 = Barr | first1 = Michael | author1-link = Michael Barr (mathematician)\n | last2 = Wells | first2 = Charles | author2-link = Charles Wells (mathematician)\n | edition = revised\n | series = Reprints in Theory and Applications of Categories\n | mr = 2178101\n | title = Toposes, Triples and Theories\n | url = http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/12/tr12abs.html\n | volume = 12\n | year = 2005\n}}.\n* {{cite book\n | title = Handbook of categorical algebra\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | year = 1994\n | series = Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications 50\u201352\n | last1 = Borceux\n | first1 = Francis \n}}\n* {{cite book |last=Freyd |first=Peter J. |title = Abelian Categories |publisher=Harper and Row |location=New York |year=1964 |url = http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/3/tr3abs.html |authorlink=Peter J.

Treatment often consists of the administration of [[atropine]] and cardiac pacing.<ref name=HN/>\n\n===Infantile===\nFor infants, bradycardia is defined as a heart rate less than 100&nbsp;BPM (normal is around 120\u2013160). Premature babies are more likely than full-term babies to have apnea and bradycardia spells; their cause is not clearly understood. The spells may be related to centers inside the brain that regulate breathing which may not be fully developed. Touching the baby gently or rocking the incubator slightly will almost always get the baby to start breathing again, which increases the heart rate. Medications ([[theophylline]] or [[caffeine]]) can be used to treat these spells in babies if necessary. [[Neonatal intensive-care unit]] (NICU) standard practice is to electronically monitor the heart and lungs for this reason.\n\n==Causes==\nThis [[cardiac arrhythmia]] can be underlain by several causes, which are best divided into cardiac and noncardiac causes.\nNoncardiac causes are usually secondary, and can involve [[recreational drug use]] or [[drug abuse|abuse]]; [[metabolism|metabolic]] or [[endocrine]] issues, especially in the [[hypothyroidism|thyroid]]; an [[electrolyte]] imbalance; [[:Category:Neurology|neurologic]] factors; [[autonomic reflex]]es; situational factors such as prolonged [[bed rest]]; and [[autoimmune|autoimmunity]].\nCardiac causes include acute or chronic [[ischemic heart disease]], vascular [[heart disease]], valvular heart disease, or degenerative primary electrical disease. Ultimately, the causes act by three mechanisms: depressed [[automaticity]] of the heart, conduction block, or escape pacemakers and rhythms.\n\nIn general, two types of problems result in bradycardias: disorders of the [[sinoatrial node]] (SA node), and disorders of the [[atrioventricular node]] (AV node).\n\nWith sinus node dysfunction (sometimes called [[sick sinus syndrome]]), there may be disordered [[automaticity]] or impaired conduction of the impulse from the sinus node into the surrounding atrial tissue (an \"exit block\"). Second-degree sinoatrial blocks can be detected only by use of a 12-lead EKG.<ref name=NCBI>{{cite journal|pmid=16308110|title=Bradydysrhythmias and atrioventricular conduction blocks|last=Ufberg |first=JW |last2=Clark |first2=JS|date=February 2006|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2005.08.006|volume=24|issue=1|journal=Emerg.

North Am. |pages=1\u20139, v}}</ref> It is difficult and sometimes impossible to assign a mechanism to any particular bradycardia, but the underlying mechanism is not clinically relevant to treatment, which is the same in both cases of sick sinus syndrome: a permanent [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]].\n\nAtrioventricular conduction disturbances (AV block; [[First-degree AV block|primary AV block]], [[Second-degree AV block|secondary type I AV block]], [[Second-degree AV block|secondary type II AV block]], [[Third-degree AV block|tertiary AV block]]) may result from impaired conduction in the AV node, or anywhere below it, such as in the [[bundle of His]]. The clinical relevance pertaining to AV blocks is greater than that of sinoatrial blocks.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nPatients with bradycardia have likely acquired it, as opposed to having it [[congenital]]ly. Bradycardia is more common in older patients.\n\nBeta-blocker medicines also can slow the heart rate and decrease how forcefully the heart contracts. Beta blockers may slow the heart rate to a dangerous level if prescribed with [[calcium channel blocker]]-type medications.\n\nBradycardia is also part of the [[mammalian diving reflex]].<ref name=\"Michael Panneton2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Michael Panneton|first1=W.|title=The Mammalian Diving Response: An Enigmatic Reflex to Preserve Life?|journal=Physiology|volume=28|issue=5|year=2013|pages=284\u2013297|issn=1548-9213|doi=10.1152/physiol.00020.2013|pmc=3768097}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nA diagnosis of bradycardia in adults is based on a heart rate less than 60 BPM.

Consequently, although the novels were originally attributed to Willy only and published under his name alone, they were later published under both names. After the death of Willy, Colette went to court to challenge her former husband's involvement in any of the writing, and subsequently had his name removed from the books. This decision however was overturned after her death, as Willy's son from a prior relationship, [[Jacques Gauthier-Villars]], successfully sued to have his father's name restored.<ref name=Southworth2004 />\n\nThe ''Claudine'' novels are thought to be roughly [[autobiography|autobiographical]].<ref name=Southworth2004 /> Whilst the stories were shocking in their time, this affectionate portrayal of a forthright and self-assured French girl who blossoms into a charismatic adult is nowadays more likely to be regarded as chastely sensual.\n\n* ''[[Claudine \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole]]'' (1900) \u2013 Claudine at School\n* ''Claudine \u00e0 Paris'' (1901) \u2013 Claudine in Paris\n* ''Claudine en m\u00e9nage'' (1902) \u2013 Claudine Married\n* ''Claudine s'en va'' (1903) \u2013 Claudine and Annie\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Colette}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Claudine (Book Series)}}\n[[Category:Bisexuality-related fiction]]\n[[Category:Series of books]]\n[[Category:Colette]]\n[[Category:1900s novels]]\n\n\n{{1900s-LGBT-novel-stub}}", "sha1": "tenreyrikm0gwpyevorvp47ohsh8zmk"}}, {"title": "Computer jargon", "ns": "0", "id": "5875", "redirect": {"title": "Jargon"}, "revision": {"id": "190683386", "parentid": "92626582", "timestamp": "2008-02-11T19:23:23Z", "contributor": {"username": "Bigbluefish", "id": "457199"}, "comment": "the Jargon File is a work about computer jargon, not a synonym to it; redirecting to [[Jargon]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Jargon]]", "sha1": "5s81n024oygk2pn92kgnjgnyeiyq3iz"}}, {"title": "Coronary artery disease", "ns": "0", "id": "5876", "revision": {"id": "866565803", "parentid": "863828924", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T03:30:38Z", "contributor": {"ip": "220.156.176.11"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Coronary artery disease\n| image           = Blausen 0257 CoronaryArtery Plaque.png\n| caption         = Illustration depicting atherosclerosis in a coronary artery.\n| field           = [[Cardiology]], [[cardiac surgery]]\n| synonyms        = Atherosclerotic heart disease,<ref>{{cite web|title=Coronary heart disease \u2013 causes, symptoms, prevention|url=https://www.southerncross.co.nz/AboutTheGroup/HealthResources/MedicalLibrary/tabid/178/vw/1/ItemID/191|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303085351/https://www.southerncross.co.nz/AboutTheGroup/HealthResources/MedicalLibrary/tabid/178/vw/1/ItemID/191/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 March 2014|website=Southern Cross Healthcare Group|accessdate=15 September 2013}}</ref> atherosclerotic vascular disease,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Faxon|first1=D.

The heart's muscle cells may die from lack of [[oxygen]] and this is called a [[myocardial infarction]] (commonly referred to as a heart attack). It leads to damage, death, and eventual scarring of the heart muscle without regrowth of heart muscle cells. Chronic high-grade [[stenosis|narrowing]] of the coronary arteries can induce transient [[ischemia]] which leads to the induction of a [[ventricular arrhythmia]], which may terminate into a dangerous heart rhythm known as [[ventricular fibrillation]], which often leads to death.<ref name=\"AmbroseSingh2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Ambrose|first1=John|last2=Singh|first2=Manmeet|title=Pathophysiology of coronary artery disease leading to acute coronary syndromes|journal=F1000Prime Reports|volume=7|pages=08|year=2015|issn=2051-7599|doi=10.12703/P7-08|pmc=4311268|pmid=25705391}}</ref>\n\nTypically, coronary artery disease occurs when part of the smooth, elastic lining inside a [[coronary artery]] (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) develops [[atherosclerosis]]. With atherosclerosis, the artery's lining becomes hardened, stiffened, and accumulates deposits of calcium, fatty lipids, and abnormal inflammatory [[Cell (biology)|cells]] \u2013 to form a [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]]. Calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) deposits in the muscular layer of the blood vessels appear to play a significant role in stiffening the arteries and inducing the early phase of coronary [[arteriosclerosis]]. This can be seen in a so-called metastatic mechanism of [[calciphylaxis]] as it occurs in [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[hemodialysis]] (Rainer Liedtke 2008). Although these people suffer from a kidney dysfunction, almost fifty percent of them die due to coronary artery disease. Plaques can be thought of as large \"pimples\" that protrude into the channel of an artery, causing a partial obstruction to blood flow.

Diagnosis is clear-cut if ECGs show elevation of the \"[[Electrocardiogram#ST segment|ST segment]]\", which in the context of severe typical chest pain is strongly indicative of an acute [[myocardial infarction]] (MI); this is termed a STEMI (ST-elevation MI) and is treated as an emergency with either urgent [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiography]] and [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (angioplasty with or without [[stent]] insertion) or with [[thrombolysis]] (\"clot buster\" medication), whichever is available. In the absence of ST-segment elevation, heart damage is detected by [[cardiac marker]]s (blood tests that identify heart muscle damage). If there is evidence of damage ([[infarction]]), the chest pain is attributed to a \"non-ST elevation MI\" (NSTEMI). If there is no evidence of damage, the term \"unstable angina\" is used. This process usually necessitates hospital admission and close observation on a [[coronary care unit]] for possible complications (such as [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s \u2013 irregularities in the heart rate). Depending on the risk assessment, stress testing or angiography may be used to identify and treat coronary artery disease in patients who have had an NSTEMI or unstable angina.\n\n===Risk assessment===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\nThere are various risk assessment systems for determining the risk of coronary artery disease, with various emphasis on different variables above. A notable example is [[Framingham Score]], used in the [[Framingham Heart Study]]. It is mainly based on age, gender, diabetes, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, tobacco smoking and systolic blood pressure.\n\n==Prevention==\nUp to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=McGill|first=Henry C.|last2=McMahan|first2=C.

Caesium is mined mostly from [[pollucite]], while the [[Radionuclide|radioisotopes]], especially [[caesium-137]], a [[fission product]], are extracted from waste produced by [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactors]].\n\nThe German chemist [[Robert Bunsen]] and physicist  [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] discovered caesium in 1860 by the newly developed method of [[Atomic emission spectroscopy#Flame emission spectroscopy|flame spectroscopy]]. The first small-scale applications for caesium were as a \"[[getter]]\" in [[vacuum tube]]s and in [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]]. In 1967, acting on [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] proof that the speed of light is the most constant dimension in the universe, the [[International System of Units]] used two specific wave counts from an [[emission spectrum]] of caesium-133 to co-define the [[second]] and the [[metre]]. Since then, caesium has been widely used in highly accurate [[atomic clock]]s.\n\nSince the 1990s, the largest [[#Applications|application of the element]] has been as [[caesium formate]] for [[drilling fluid]]s, but it has a range of applications in the production of electricity, in electronics, and in chemistry. The radioactive isotope caesium-137 has a [[half-life]] of about 30 years and is used in medical applications, industrial gauges, and hydrology. Nonradioactive caesium compounds are only mildly [[Toxicity|toxic]], but the pure metal's tendency to react explosively with water means that caesium is considered a hazardous material, and the radioisotopes present a significant health and ecological hazard in the environment.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n===Physical properties===\n[[File:CsCrystals.JPG|left|thumb|High-purity caesium-133 stored in [[argon]].|alt= Y-shaped yellowish crystal in glass ampoule, looking like the branch of a pine tree]]\nCaesium is the softest element (it has a hardness of 0.2 Mohs).

Centuries are numbered [[names of numbers in English#Ordinal numbers|ordinally]] in [[English language|English]] and many other languages.\n\nA '''centenary''' is a hundredth anniversary, or a celebration of this, typically the remembrance of an event which took place a hundred years earlier.\n\n== Start and end in the Gregorian calendar ==\nAlthough a century can mean any arbitrary period of 100 years, there are two viewpoints on the nature of standard centuries. One is based on strict construction, while the other is based on popular perspective (general usage). \n\nAccording to the strict construction of the [[Gregorian calendar]], the 1st century AD began with 1 AD and ended with 100 AD, with the same pattern continuing onward. In this model, the ''n''-th century started/will start on the year ''(100 \u00d7 n) \u2212 99'' and ends in ''100 \u00d7 n''. Because of this, a century will only include one year, the centennial year, that starts with the century's number (e.g. '''19'''00 was the last year of the 19th century).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/millennium.php | title=The 21st Century and the 3rd Millennium | publisher=U.S. Naval Observatory | work=aa.usno.navy.mil/ | date=14 June 2011 | accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn general usage, centuries are aligned with [[decades]] by grouping years based on their shared digits. In this model, the 'n' -th century started/will start on the year ''(100 x n) - 100'' and ends in ''(100 x n) - 1''. For example, the 20th century is generally regarded as from 1900 to 1999, inclusive. This is sometimes known as the [[odometer]] effect. The [[astronomical year numbering]] and [[ISO 8601]] systems both contain a year zero, so the first century begins with the year zero, rather than the year one.<ref>{{Cite web| title = century | work = Oxford Dictionaries| accessdate = 10 May 2018| url = https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/century}}</ref> \n\n=== Viewpoint 1: Strict usage ===\n{| style=\"border-collapse:collapse;

In this system, the years 1900\u20131999 are referred to as the ''nineteen hundreds'' (''1900s''). Aside from English usage, this system is used in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. The Swedish ''nittonhundratalet'' (or ''1900-talet''), Danish ''nittenhundredetallet'' (or ''1900-tallet''), Norwegian ''nittenhundretallet'' (or '' 1900-tallet'') and Finnish ''tuhatyhdeks\u00e4nsataaluku'' (or ''1900-luku'') refer unambiguously to the years 1900\u20131999.\n\n== Similar dating units in other calendar systems ==\nWhile the century has been commonly used in the West, other cultures and calendars have utilized differently sized groups of years in a similar manner.

The change from {{lang|wlm|-dyf}} to {{lang|cy|-dydd}} shows the colloquial alteration of Welsh ''f'' {{IPA-cy|v|}} and ''dd'' {{IPA-cy|\u00f0|}}, and was perhaps also driven by [[folk etymology]] ({{lang|cy|dydd}} is Welsh for 'day' whereas *{{lang|cy|dyf}} has no obvious meaning). This [[sound change]] had probably first occurred in the [[Middle Ages]]; both forms were current in the [[Tudor period]]. {{lang|wlm|Caerdyf}} has its origins in [[sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman]] [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] words meaning \"the fort of the [[River Taff|Taff]]\". The [[Cardiff Roman Fort|fort]] probably refers to that established by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. {{lang|cy|Caer}} is Welsh for ''fort'' and {{lang|cy|-dyf}} is in effect a form of {{lang|cy|Taf}} (Taff), the river which flows by Cardiff Castle, with the {{angle bracket|t}} showing [[consonant mutation]] to {{angle bracket|d}} and the vowel showing [[affection (linguistics)|affection]] as a result of a (lost) [[genitive case]] ending.<ref name=hwo>Hywel Wyn Owen and Richard Morgan, ''Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales''. University of Wales Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-84323-901-9}}, p. 70.</ref>\n\nThe [[anglicisation|anglicised]] form ''Cardiff'' is derived from {{lang|wlm|Caerdyf}}, with the Welsh ''f'' {{IPA-cy|v|}} borrowed as ''ff'' {{IPAc-en|f|}}, as also happens in ''Taff'' (from Welsh {{lang|cy|Taf}}) and ''[[Llandaff]]'' (from Welsh {{lang|cy|Llandaf}}). As English does not have the vowel {{IPA-cy|\u0268|}} the final vowel has been borrowed as {{IPAc-en|\u026a|}}.\n\nThe antiquarian [[William Camden]] (1551\u20131623) suggested that the name Cardiff may derive from *{{lang|wlm|Caer-Didi}} (\"the Fort of Didius\"), a name supposedly given in honour of {{lang|la|[[Aulus Didius Gallus]]|italic=no}}, governor of a nearby province at the time when the Roman fort was established.

He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the [[Victorian era]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{harvnb|Black|2007|p=735}}.</ref> His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the 20th century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius.

Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five [[novellas]], hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed [[Oral interpretation|readings]] extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.\n\nDickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the [[serial (literature)|serial]] publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication.<ref>{{harvnb|Grossman|2012|p=54}}</ref><ref name=\"Lodge 2002 118\">{{harvnb|Lodge|2002|p=118}}.</ref> [[Cliffhanger]] endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense.<ref>{{cite news|title=The curious staying power of the cliffhanger.|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|publisher=The New Yorker|date=2 December 2017}}</ref> The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback.<ref name=\"Lodge 2002 118\"/> For example, when his wife's [[chiropodist]] expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in ''[[David Copperfield]]'' seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features.<ref>{{harvnb|Ziegler|2007|pp=46\u201347}}.</ref> His plots were carefully constructed, and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives.<ref>{{harvnb|Stone|1987|pp=267\u2013268}}.</ref> Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|ha'pennies]] to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.<ref>{{harvnb|Hauser|1999|p=116}}.</ref>\n\nDickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age.<ref>{{harvnb|Cain|2008|p=1}}.</ref> His 1843 novella, ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' and ''[[Great Expectations]]'' are also frequently adapted, and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel, ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', set in London and Paris, is his best-known work of historical fiction. Dickens has been praised by fellow writers\u2014from [[Leo Tolstoy]] to [[George Orwell]], [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Tom Wolfe]]\u2014for his [[Realism (arts)|realism]], comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and [[Child labour#Historical|social criticism]]. On the other hand, [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Henry James]], and [[Virginia Woolf]] complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism. The term ''Dickensian'' is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.<ref>[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Dickensian \"Oxford Dictionaries&nbsp;\u2013 Dickensian\"].

His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam,<ref name=\"autogenerated1999\">West, Gilian. \"Huffam and Son.\" Dickensian 95, no. 447 (Spring, 1999): 5\u201318.</ref> rigger to His Majesty's Navy, gentleman, and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles. Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey, the owner of a shipping company in Dickens's novel ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' (1848).<ref name=\"autogenerated1999\"/>\n\nIn January 1815, John Dickens was called back to London, and the family moved to Norfolk Street, [[Fitzrovia]].<ref>Charles Dickens and the Great Theatre of the World, Simon Callow, p.5</ref> When Charles was four, they relocated to [[Sheerness]], and thence to [[Chatham, Medway|Chatham]], Kent, where he spent his formative years until the age of 11. His early life seems to have been idyllic, though he thought himself a \"very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy\".<ref>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nCharles spent time outdoors, but also read voraciously, including the [[picaresque novel]]s of [[Tobias Smollett]] and [[Henry Fielding]], as well as ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' and ''[[Gil Blas]]''. He read and reread ''[[The Arabian Nights]]'' and the Collected Farces of [[Elizabeth Inchbald]].<ref>Simon Callow, Charles Dickens and the Great Theatre of the World, p.7</ref> He retained poignant memories of childhood, helped by an excellent memory of people and events, which he used in his writing.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=22\u201324:29\u201330}}.</ref> His father's brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a few years of private education, first at a [[dame school]], and then at a school run by William Giles, a [[English Dissenters|dissenter]], in Chatham.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=41}}.</ref>\n[[File:Dickens-at-the-Blacking-Warehouse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=drawing|Illustration by Fred Bernard of Dickens at work in a shoe-blacking factory after his father had been sent to the [[Marshalsea]], published in the 1892 edition of Forster's ''Life of Dickens''<ref>{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=158}}.</ref>]]\n\nThis period came to an end in June 1822, when John Dickens was recalled to Navy Pay Office headquarters at [[Somerset House]], and the family (except for Charles, who stayed behind to finish his final term of work) moved to [[Camden Town]] in London.<ref>Simon Callow, p.13</ref> The family had left Kent amidst rapidly mounting debts, and, living beyond his means,<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=76}}:'recklessly improvident'.</ref> John Dickens was forced by his creditors into the [[Marshalsea]] [[debtors' prison]] in [[Southwark]], London in 1824. His wife and youngest children joined him there, as was the practice at the time. Charles, then 12 years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112 College Place, Camden Town.<ref>{{harvnb|Pope-Hennessy|1945|p=11}}.</ref> Roylance was \"a reduced [impoverished] old lady, long known to our family\", whom Dickens later immortalised, \"with a few alterations and embellishments\", as \"Mrs. Pipchin\" in ''Dombey and Son''. Later, he lived in a back-attic in the house of an agent for the [[Insolvency|Insolvent Court]], Archibald Russell, \"a fat, good-natured, kind old gentleman... with a quiet old wife\" and lame son, in [[Lant Street]] in Southwark.<ref>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=27}}.</ref> They provided the inspiration for the Garlands in ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=76}}.</ref>\n\nOn Sundays\u2014with his sister Frances, free from her studies at the [[Royal Academy of Music]]\u2014he spent the day at the Marshalsea.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=53}}.</ref> Dickens later used the prison as a setting in ''[[Little Dorrit]]''. To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren's [[shoe polish|Blacking]] Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present [[Charing Cross railway station]], where he earned six [[shilling]]s a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. The strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays, becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions, the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor. He later wrote that he wondered \"how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age\".<ref name=Foster23/> As he recalled to [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]] (from ''The Life of Charles Dickens''):\n\n<blockquote>The blacking-warehouse was the last house on the left-hand side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.<ref name=Foster23>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|pp=23\u201324}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen the warehouse was moved to Chandos Street in the smart, busy district of [[Covent Garden]] the boys worked in a room in which the window gave onto the street and little audiences gathered and watched them at work\u2014in Dickens biographer [[Simon Callow]]'s estimation, the public display was \"a new refinement added to his misery\".<ref>Callow, p.25</ref>\n\n[[File:Courtyard of the former Marshalsea prison, 1897 (2).png|upright|thumb|The [[Marshalsea]] around 1897, after it had closed]]\nA few months after his imprisonment, John Dickens's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, died and bequeathed him \u00a3450. On the expectation of this legacy, Dickens was released from prison. Under the [[Act of Parliament|Insolvent Debtors Act]], Dickens arranged for payment of his creditors, and he and his family left Marshalsea,<ref>{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=157}}.</ref><!-- not for the bequest --> for the home of Mrs Roylance.\n\nCharles's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, did not immediately support his removal from the boot-blacking warehouse. This influenced Dickens's view that a father should rule the family, and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home: \"I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back\". His mother's failure to request his return was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=58}}.</ref>\n\nRighteous indignation stemming from his own situation and the conditions under which [[working class|working-class]] people lived became major themes of his works, and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite, and most [[autobiographical novel|autobiographical, novel]], ''[[David Copperfield]]'':<ref>{{harvnb|Cain|2008|p=91}}.</ref> \"I had no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no assistance, no support, of any kind, from anyone, that I can call to mind, as I hope to go to heaven!\"<ref name = \"Wilson61\"/>\n\nDickens was eventually sent to the Wellington House Academy in [[Camden Town]], where he remained until March 1827, having spent about two years there. He did not consider it to be a good school: \"Much of the haphazard, desultory teaching, poor discipline punctuated by the headmaster's sadistic brutality, the seedy ushers and general run-down atmosphere, are embodied in Mr. Creakle's Establishment in ''David Copperfield''.\"<ref name = \"Wilson61\">{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=61}}.</ref>\n\nDickens worked at the law office of Ellis and Blackmore, attorneys, of Holborn Court, [[Gray's Inn]], as a junior [[law clerk|clerk]] from May 1827 to November 1828. He was a gifted mimic and impersonated those around him: clients, lawyers, and clerks. He went to theatres obsessively\u2014he claimed that for at least three years he went to the theatre every single day. His favourite actor was [[Charles Mathews]], and Dickens learnt his ''monopolylogues'', (farces in which Mathews played every character), by heart.<ref>Callow, p.34, 36</ref> Then, having learned [[Thomas Gurney (shorthand writer)|Gurney's]] system of shorthand in his spare time, he left to become a freelance reporter. A distant relative, Thomas Charlton, was a freelance reporter at [[Doctors' Commons]], and Dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings for nearly four years.<ref>{{harvnb|Pope-Hennessy|1945|p=18}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1972|p=64}}.</ref> This education was to inform works such as ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]'', ''Dombey and Son'', and especially ''Bleak House''\u2014whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of Dickens's own views regarding, particularly, the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to \"go to law\".\n\nIn 1830, Dickens met his first love, Maria Beadnell, thought to have been the model for the character Dora in ''David Copperfield''. Maria's parents disapproved of the courtship and ended the relationship by sending her to school in Paris.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1998|p=23}}.</ref>\n\n==Journalism and early novels==\n\nIn 1832, at age 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident.<ref>Callow, p.48</ref> He enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense of what he wanted to become, and yet knew he wanted fame. Drawn to the theatre\u2014he became an early member of the [[Garrick Club|Garrick]]<ref>Claire Tomalin, The Invisible Woman, p.7</ref>\u2014he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden, where the manager [[George Bartley (comedian)|George Bartley]] and the actor [[Charles Kemble]] were to see him. Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian Charles Mathews, but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold. Before another opportunity arose, he had set out on his career as a writer.<ref>Claire Tomalin, the Invisible Woman, p.76</ref> In 1833, he submitted his first story, \"A Dinner at Poplar Walk\", to the London periodical ''[[Monthly Magazine]]''.<ref name = \"Patten(2001)16ff\">{{harvnb|Patten|2001|pp=16\u201318}}.</ref> William Barrow, a brother of his mother, offered him a job on ''The Mirror of Parliament'' and he worked in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for the first time early in 1832. He rented rooms at [[Furnival's Inn]] and worked as a political journalist, reporting on [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary]] debates, and he travelled across Britain to cover election campaigns for the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]''. His journalism, in the form of sketches in periodicals, formed his first collection of pieces, published in 1836: ''[[Sketches by Boz]]''\u2014Boz being a family nickname he employed as a pseudonym for some years.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp= 174\u2013176}}.</ref><ref name=\"Glancy 1999 6\">{{harvnb|Glancy|1999|p=6}}.</ref> Dickens apparently adopted it from the nickname \"Moses\", which he had given to his youngest brother [[Augustus Dickens]], after a character in Oliver Goldsmith's ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]''. When pronounced by anyone with a head cold, \"Moses\" became \"Boses\"\u2014later shortened to ''Boz''.<ref name=\"Glancy 1999 6\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Van De Linde|1917|p=75}}.</ref> Dickens's own name was considered \"queer\" by a contemporary critic, who wrote in 1849: \"Mr Dickens, as if in revenge for his own queer name, does bestow still queerer ones upon his fictitious creations.\" He contributed to and edited journals throughout his literary career.<ref name = \"Patten(2001)16ff\"/> In January 1835, the ''Morning Chronicle'' launched an evening edition, under the editorship of the ''Chronicle''{{'}}s music critic, [[George Hogarth]]. Hogarth invited Dickens to contribute ''Street Sketches'' and Dickens became a regular visitor to his Fulham house, excited by Hogarth's friendship with a hero of his, [[Walter Scott]], and enjoying the company of Hogarth's three daughters\u2014Georgina, Mary, and nineteen-year-old Catherine.<ref>Callow p.54</ref>\n\n[[File:Catherine Dickens.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Catherine Hogarth Dickens by [[Samuel Lawrence]] (1838)]]\n\nDickens made rapid progress both professionally and socially. He began a friendship with [[William Harrison Ainsworth]], the author of the highwayman novel ''[[Rookwood (novel)|Rookwood]]'' (1834), whose bachelor salon in [[Harrow Road]] had become the meeting place for a set that included [[Daniel Maclise]], [[Benjamin Disraeli]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], and [[George Cruikshank]]. All these became his friends and collaborators, with the exception of Disraeli, and he met his first publisher, John Macrone, at the house.<ref>Simon Callow, Charles Dickens and the Great Theatre of the World, p.56</ref> The success of ''Sketches by Boz'' led to a proposal from publishers [[Chapman and Hall]] for Dickens to supply text to match [[Robert Seymour (illustrator)|Robert Seymour]]'s engraved illustrations in a monthly [[Letterpress printing|letterpress]].

In spite of the abolitionist sentiments gleaned from his trip to America, some modern commentators have pointed out inconsistencies in Dickens's views on racial inequality, for instance, he has been criticized for his subsequent acquiescence in Governor [[Edward John Eyre|Eyre's]] harsh crackdown during the 1860s [[Morant Bay rebellion]] in Jamaica and his failure to join other British progressives in condemning it.<ref>{{cite news|title=Marlon James and Charles Dickens: Embrace the art, not the racist artist|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2015/10/marlon-james-and-charles-dickens|accessdate=21 October 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=20 October 2015}}</ref> From [[Richmond, Virginia]], Dickens returned to Washington, D.C., and started a trek westward to St. Louis, Missouri.

Of these, ''A Christmas Carol'' was most popular and, tapping into an old tradition, did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America.<ref>{{harvnb|Callow|2009|pp=146\u2013148}}.</ref> The seeds for the story became planted in Dickens's mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there. This, along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane [[Ragged School]], caused Dickens to resolve to \"strike a sledge hammer blow\" for the poor. As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest, Dickens became engrossed in the book. He later wrote that as the tale unfolded he \"wept and laughed, and wept again\" as he \"walked about the black streets of London fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Schlicke|1999|p=98}}.</ref>\n\nAfter living briefly in Italy (1844), Dickens travelled to Switzerland (1846), where he began work on ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' (1846\u201348). This and ''[[David Copperfield]]'' (1849\u201350) mark a significant artistic break in Dickens's career as his novels became more serious in theme and more carefully planned than his early works.\n\nAt about this time, he was made aware of a large embezzlement at the firm where his brother, [[Augustus Dickens|Augustus]], worked (John Chapman & Co.). It had been carried out by [[Thomas Powell (1809-1887)|Thomas Powell]], a clerk, who was on friendly terms with Dickens and who had acted as mentor to Augustus when he started work. Powell was also an author and poet and knew many of the famous writers of the day. After further fraudulent activities, Powell fled to New York and published a book called ''The Living Authors of England'' with a chapter on Charles Dickens, who was not amused by what Powell had written. One item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that he had based the character of Paul Dombey (''[[Dombey and Son]]'') on Thomas Chapman, one of the principal partners at John Chapman & Co. Dickens immediately sent a letter to [[Lewis Gaylord Clark]], editor of the New York literary magazine ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'', saying that Powell was a forger and thief. Clark published the letter in the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', and several other papers picked up on the story. Powell began proceedings to sue these publications, and Clark was arrested. Dickens, realising that he had acted in haste, contacted John Chapman & Co. to seek written confirmation of Powell's guilt. Dickens did receive a reply confirming Powell's embezzlement, but once the directors realised this information might have to be produced in court, they refused to make further disclosures. Owing to the difficulties of providing evidence in America to support his accusations, Dickens eventually made a private settlement with Powell out of court.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moss|first1=Sidney P.|last2=Moss|first2=Carolyn J.|title=The Charles Dickens-Thomas Powell Vendetta|date=1996|publisher=The Whitston Publishing Company|location=Troy New York|pages=42\u2013125}}</ref>\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[File:Portrait of Charles Dickens (4671094).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Charles Dickens c.1850]]\n[[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts|Angela Burdett Coutts]], heir to the Coutts banking fortune, approached Dickens in May 1846 about setting up a home for the redemption of [[Fallen woman|fallen women]] of the working class.

The only [[first class travel|first-class]] carriage to remain on the track was the one in which Dickens was travelling. Before rescuers arrived, Dickens tended and comforted the wounded and the dying with a flask of brandy and a hat refreshed with water, and saved some lives. Before leaving, he remembered the unfinished manuscript for ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'', and he returned to his carriage to retrieve it.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=959\u2013961}}.</ref> Dickens later used this experience as material for his short [[ghost story]], \"[[The Signal-Man]]\", in which the central character has a premonition of his own death in a rail crash. He also based the story on several previous [[Lists of rail accidents|rail accidents]], such as the [[Clayton Tunnel rail crash]] of 1861. Dickens managed to avoid an appearance at the [[inquest]] to avoid disclosing that he had been travelling with Ternan and her mother, which would have caused a scandal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://omf.ucsc.edu/dickens/staplehurst-disaster.html|title=The Staplehurst Disaster|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Second visit to the United States==\n[[File:Buying tickets for a Charles Dickens reading at Steinway Hall, New York, New York, 1867.jpg|thumb|left|Crowd of spectators buying tickets for a Dickens reading at [[Steinway Hall]], New York City in 1867]]\nWhile he contemplated a second visit to the United States, the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in America in 1861 delayed his plans. On 9 November 1867, over two years after the war, Dickens set sail from [[Liverpool]] for his second American reading tour. Landing at [[Boston]], he devoted the rest of the month to a round of dinners with such notables as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], and his American publisher, [[James Thomas Fields]]. In early December, the readings began. He performed 76 readings, netting \u00a319,000, from December 1867 to April 1868.<ref name=\"Hobsbaum1998\">{{harvnb|Hobsbaum|1998|p=271}}.</ref> Dickens shuttled between Boston and New York, where he gave 22 readings at [[Steinway Hall]].

His final appearance was at a banquet the American Press held in his honour at [[Delmonico's Restaurant|Delmonico's]] on 18 April, when he promised never to denounce America again. By the end of the tour Dickens could hardly manage solid food, subsisting on champagne and eggs beaten in sherry.

He managed, of a contracted 100 readings, to deliver 75 in the provinces, with a further 12 in London.<ref name=\"Hobsbaum1998\" /> As he pressed on he was affected by giddiness and fits of paralysis.

It was fashionable in the 1860s to 'do the slums' and, in company, Dickens visited [[opium den]]s in [[Shadwell]], where he witnessed an elderly addict known as \"[[Lascar|Laskar]] Sal\", who formed the model for the \"Opium Sal\" subsequently featured in his mystery novel, ''Edwin Drood''.<ref>{{harvnb|Foxcroft|2007|p=53}}.</ref>\n\nAfter Dickens had regained sufficient strength, he arranged, with medical approval, for a final series of readings to partially make up to his sponsors what they had lost due to his illness. There were to be 12 performances, running between 11 January and 15 March 1870, the last at 8:00&nbsp;pm at [[St. James's Hall]] in London. Although in grave health by this time, he read ''A Christmas Carol'' and ''The Trial from Pickwick''. On 2 May, he made his last public appearance at a [[Royal Academy]] Banquet in the presence of the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]], paying a special tribute on the death of his friend, the illustrator Daniel Maclise.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=1069\u20131070}}.</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Samuel Luke Fildes - The Empty Chair (The Graphic, 1870).jpg|thumb|[[Luke Fildes|Samuel Luke Fildes]]\u2014''The Empty Chair''.

He never regained consciousness, and the next day, five years to the day after the Staplehurst rail crash, he died at Gads Hill Place. Biographer Claire Tomalin has suggested Dickens was actually in Peckham when he suffered the stroke, and his mistress Ellen Ternan and her maids had him taken back to Gad's Hill so the public would not know the truth about their relationship.<ref>omalin, Claire ''Charles Dickens: A Life'' (2011) p.395-96, p.484</ref> Contrary to his wish to be buried at [[Rochester Cathedral]] \"in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner\",<ref>{{harvnb|Forster|2006|p=628}}.</ref> he was laid to rest in the [[Poets' Corner]] of [[Westminster Abbey]].

Pointing to the fresh flowers that adorned the novelist's grave, Stanley assured those present that \"the spot would thenceforth be a sacred one with both the New World and the Old, as that of the representative of literature, not of this island only, but of all who speak our English tongue.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley|1870|pp=144\u2013147:146}}.</ref>\n\nIn his will, drafted more than a year before his death, Dickens left the care of his \u00a380,000 estate to his longtime colleague John Forster and his \"best and truest friend\" Georgina Hogarth who, along with Dickens's two sons, also received a tax-free sum of \u00a38,000 (about \u00a3800,000 in present terms). Although Dickens and his wife had been separated for several years at the time of his death, he provided her with an annual income of \u00a3600 and made her similar allowances in his will.

According to Ackroyd, other than these, perhaps the most important literary influence on him was derived from the fables of ''The Arabian Nights''.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|pp=44\u201345}}.</ref><!-- odnb mentions Genji which is very novelesque&nbsp;\u2013 worth adding? -->\n[[File:Dickens dream.jpg|thumb|''Dickens's Dream'' by [[Robert William Buss]], portraying Dickens at his desk at [[Gads Hill Place]] surrounded by many of his characters]]\n\nHis writing style is marked by a profuse linguistic creativity.<ref name=\"Mee2010\">{{harvnb|Mee|2010|p=20}}.</ref> Satire, flourishing in his gift for caricature, is his forte. An early reviewer compared him to [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]] for his keen practical sense of the ludicrous side of life, though his acclaimed mastery of varieties of class idiom may in fact mirror the conventions of contemporary popular theatre.<ref>{{harvnb|Vlock|1998|p=30}}.</ref> Dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers, and assist the development of motifs in the storyline, giving what one critic calls an \"allegorical impetus\" to the novels' meanings.<ref name=\"Mee2010\" /> To cite one of numerous examples, the name Mr. Murdstone in ''David Copperfield'' conjures up twin allusions to \"murder\" and stony coldness.<ref>{{harvnb|Stone|1987|pp=xx\u2013xxi}}.</ref> His literary style is also a mixture of [[fantasy]] and [[realism (arts)|realism]]. His satires of British aristocratic snobbery\u2014he calls one character the \"Noble Refrigerator\"\u2014are often popular. Comparing orphans to stocks and shares, people to tug boats, or dinner-party guests to furniture are just some of Dickens's acclaimed flights of fancy.\n\nThe author worked closely with his illustrators, supplying them with a summary of the work at the outset and thus ensuring that his characters and settings were exactly how he envisioned them. He briefed the illustrator on plans for each month's instalment so that work could begin before he wrote them. [[Marcus Stone]], illustrator of ''Our Mutual Friend'', recalled that the author was always \"ready to describe down to the minutest details the personal characteristics, and&nbsp;... life-history of the creations of his fancy\".<ref>{{harvnb|Cohen|1980|p=206}}.</ref>\n\n===Characters===\n[[File:Charles Dickens characters.jpg|thumb|right|Dickens' characters]]\nDickens's biographer [[Claire Tomalin]] regards him as the greatest creator of character in English fiction after [[Shakespeare]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2012}}.</ref>\nDickensian [[List of Dickensian characters|characters]] are amongst the most memorable in English literature, especially so because of their typically whimsical names.

Many were drawn from real life: Mrs Nickleby is based on his mother, though she didn't recognise herself in the portrait,<ref>{{harvnb|Ziegler|2007|p=45}}.</ref> just as Mr Micawber is constructed from aspects of his father's 'rhetorical exuberance':<ref>{{harvnb|Hawes|1998|p=153}}.</ref> Harold Skimpole in ''Bleak House'' is based on [[James Henry Leigh Hunt]]: his wife's dwarfish chiropodist recognised herself in Miss Mowcher in ''David Copperfield''.<ref>{{harvnb|Ziegler|2007|p=46}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hawes|1998|p=158}}.</ref> Perhaps Dickens's impressions on his meeting with Hans Christian Andersen informed the delineation of Uriah Heep.<ref>{{harvnb|Hawes|1998|p=109}}.</ref>\n\n[[Virginia Woolf]] maintained that \"we remodel our psychological geography when we read Dickens\" as he produces \"characters who exist not in detail, not accurately or exactly, but abundantly in a cluster of wild yet extraordinarily revealing remarks\".<ref>{{harvnb|Woolf|1986|p=286}}.</ref> One \"character\" vividly drawn throughout his novels is London itself. From the [[coaching inn]]s on the outskirts of the city to the lower reaches of the [[Thames]], all aspects of the capital are described over the course of his body of work.\n\n===Autobiographical elements===\n\n[[File:David Copperfield, We are disturbed in our cookery.jpg|thumb|right|An original illustration by [[Phiz]] from the novel ''David Copperfield'', which is widely regarded as Dickens's most autobiographical work]]\n\nAuthors frequently draw their portraits of characters from people they have known in real life. ''David Copperfield'' is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of Dickens. The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in ''Bleak House'' reflect Dickens's experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law's procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright.<ref>{{harvnb|Polloczek|1999|p=133}}.</ref> Dickens's father was sent to prison for debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in ''Little Dorrit'' resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=}}.</ref> Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly in ''David Copperfield'' and Lucie Manette in ''A Tale of Two Cities.''<ref>{{harvnb|Slater|1983|pp=43, 47}}.</ref>{{refn|Slater detects also Ellen Ternan in the portrayal of Lucie Manette.|group=\"nb\"}} Dickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death, when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated. Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt, some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickens's own character, which he sought to exorcise by self-parody.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=653}}.</ref>\n\n===Episodic writing===\n\nMost of Dickens's major novels were first written in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as ''Master Humphrey's Clock'' and ''Household Words'', later reprinted in book form. These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible, and the series of regular [[cliffhanger|cliff-hangers]] made each new episode widely anticipated. When ''The Old Curiosity Shop'' was being serialised, American fans waited at the docks in [[New York harbor]], shouting out to the crew of an incoming British ship, \"Is little Nell dead?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Glancy|1999|p=34}}.</ref> Dickens's talent was to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end.\n\n[[File:Charles Dickens, public reading, 1867.jpg|left|thumb|\"Charles Dickens as he appears when reading.\" Wood engraving from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 7 December 1867]]\n\nAnother important impact of Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts, an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation. He toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp's drowning in ''The Old Curiosity Shop''), and made suggestions about plot and character. It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in ''Oliver Twist''. Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell, and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1983|pp=166\u2013169}}.</ref>\n\nDickens's serialisation of his novels was not uncriticised by other authors. In [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s novel ''[[The Wrecker (Stevenson novel)|The Wrecker]]'', there is a comment by Captain Nares, investigating an abandoned ship: \"See! They were writing up the log,\" said Nares, pointing to the ink-bottle. \"Caught napping, as usual. I wonder if there ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date? He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break, like Charles Dickens and his serial novels.\"\n\n===Social commentary===\n[[File:Martin Chuzzlewit illus11.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Nurse [[Sarah Gamp]] (left) from ''Martin Chuzzlewit'' became a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian era, before the reforms of [[Florence Nightingale]]]]\nDickens's novels were, among other things, works of [[social commentary]]. He was a fierce critic of the poverty and [[social stratification]] of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society. In a New York address, he expressed his belief that \"Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=345}}.</ref> Dickens's second novel, ''Oliver Twist'' (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it challenged middle class polemics about criminals, making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed.<ref>{{harvnb|Raina|1986|p=25}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bodenheimer|2011|p=147}}.</ref>\n\n===Literary techniques===\n\nDickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his [[caricature]]s and the ugly social truths he reveals. The story of Nell Trent in ''The Old Curiosity Shop'' (1841) was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by [[Oscar Wilde]]. \"One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell\", he said in a famous remark, \"without dissolving into tears...of laughter.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/boev1.html|title=Deconstructing Little Nell|last=Boev|first=Hristo|date=|website=The Victorian Web|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ellmann|1988|p=441}}: In conversation with [[Ada Leverson]].</ref> [[G. K. Chesterton]], stated: \"It is not the death of little Nell, but the life of little Nell, that I object to\", arguing that the maudlin effect of his description of her life owed much to the gregarious nature of Dickens's grief, his \"despotic\" use of people's feelings to move them to tears in works like this.<ref>{{harvnb|Chesterton|1911|pp=54\u201355}}.</ref>\n\nThe question as to whether Dickens belongs to the tradition of the [[sentimental novel]] is debatable. Valerie Purton, in her recent ''Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition'', sees him continuing aspects of this tradition, and argues that his \"sentimental scenes and characters [are] as crucial to the overall power of the novels as his darker or comic figures and scenes\", and that \"''Dombey and Son'' is [ ... ] Dickens's greatest triumph in the sentimentalist tradition\".<ref>London: Anthem Press, 2012, p.xiii, p.123.</ref> The ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' online comments that, despite \"patches of emotional excess\", such as the reported death of Tiny Tim in ''A Christmas Carol'' (1843), \"Dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/421071/novel |title=novel (literature) |work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=7 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Oliver Twist'' Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young [[pickpocketing|pickpockets]]. While later novels also centre on idealised characters (Esther Summerson in ''Bleak House'' and Amy Dorrit in ''Little Dorrit''), this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens's goal of poignant social commentary. Dickens's fiction, reflecting what he believed to be true of his own life, makes frequent use of coincidence, either for comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence.<ref>{{harvnb|Marlow|1994|pp=149\u2013150}}.</ref> For example, Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper-class family that rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group. Such coincidences are a staple of 18th-century picaresque novels, such as Henry Fielding's ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]],'' which Dickens enjoyed reading as a youth.<ref>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|1990|p=44}}.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Ottawa Public Library.jpg|thumb|right|Dickens portrait (top left), in between Shakespeare and Tennyson, on a stained glass window at the [[Ottawa Public Library]], Ottawa, Canada]]\nDickens was the most popular novelist of his time,<ref>{{harvnb|Trollope|2007|p=62}}.</ref> and remains one of the best-known and most-read of English authors.

It is also the most-filmed of Dickens's stories, with many versions dating from the early years of cinema.<ref name=\"Callow2009\">{{harvnb|Callow|2009|p=39}}.</ref> According to the historian [[Ronald Hutton]], the current state of the observance of Christmas is largely the result of a mid-Victorian revival of the holiday spearheaded by ''A Christmas Carol''. Dickens catalysed the emerging Christmas as a family-centred festival of generosity, in contrast to the dwindling community-based and church-centred observations, as new middle-class expectations arose.<ref>{{harvnb|Hutton|2001|p=188}}.</ref> Its archetypal figures (Scrooge, Tiny Tim, the Christmas ghosts) entered into Western cultural consciousness.

Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues\u2014such as [[sanitation]] and the [[workhouse]]\u2014but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities. He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist, but flourished as a result. His most strident indictment of this condition is in ''Hard Times'' (1854), Dickens's only novel-length treatment of the industrial working class. In this work, he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed \"Hands\" by the factory owners; that is, not really \"people\" but rather only appendages of the machines they operated. His writings inspired others, in particular journalists and political figures, to address such problems of class oppression. For example, the prison scenes in ''The Pickwick Papers'' are claimed to have been influential in having the [[Fleet Prison]] shut down. [[Karl Marx]] asserted that Dickens \"issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together\".<ref name=\"KucichSadoff\">{{harvnb|Kucich|Sadoff|2006|p=155}}.</ref> [[George Bernard Shaw]] even remarked that ''Great Expectations'' was more seditious than Marx's ''[[Das Kapital]]''.<ref name=\"KucichSadoff\" /> The exceptional popularity of Dickens's novels, even those with socially oppositional themes (''Bleak House'', 1853; ''Little Dorrit'', 1857; ''Our Mutual Friend'', 1865), not only underscored his almost preternatural ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters, but also ensured that the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored. It has been argued that his technique of flooding his narratives with an 'unruly superfluity of material' that, in the gradual d\u00e9nouement, yields up an unsuspected order, influenced the organisation of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|1990|p=48}}, citing [[Gillian Beer]]'s ''Darwin's Plots'' (1983, p.8).</ref>\n\n==Influence and legacy==\n[[File:Dickens and Nell Philly.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Dickens and Little Nell (Elwell)|''Dickens and Little Nell'']] statue in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania]]\n[[File:Charles Dickens grave 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|Dickens' grave in [[Westminster Abbey]] in 2012]]\nMuseums and festivals celebrating Dickens's life and works exist in many places with which Dickens was associated.

The word is a shortened form of ''Karabinerhaken'' (or also short ''Karabiner''), a German phrase for a \"spring hook\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Karabiner|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}</ref> used by a [[carbine]] rifleman, or [[carabinier]], to attach items to a belt or [[bandolier]].\n\n==Use==\nCarabiners, often called D-Rings by military professionals, are widely used in rope-intensive activities such as [[climbing]], [[arboriculture]], [[caving]], [[sailing]], [[hot air ballooning]], [[rope rescue]], [[construction]], [[industrial rope access|industrial rope work]], [[window cleaning]], [[whitewater rescue]], and [[acrobatics]]. They are predominantly made from both [[steel]] and [[aluminium]].  Those used in sports tend to be of a lighter weight than those used in commercial applications and rope rescue. \nOften referred to as carabiner-style or as mini-biners, carabiner keyrings and other light-use clips of similar style and design have also become popular. Most are stamped with a \u201cNot For Climbing\u201d or similar warning due to a common lack of load-testing and safety standards in manufacturing. While from an [[etymological]] perspective any metal attaching link with a spring gate is technically a carabiner, the strict usage among the [[climbing]] community specifically refers only to those devices manufactured and tested for load-bearing in safety-critical systems like rock and mountain climbing.\n\nCarabiners on [[hot air balloon]]s are used to connect the envelope to the basket and are rated at 2.5 tonne, 3 tonne or 4 tonne.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://cameronballoons.co.uk/support#hot-air-balloon-maintenance-manual-en\n| title = Cameron Balloons Maintenance Manual (refer to section 6.6.4)\n| accessdate = 2015-03-28}}</ref>\n\nLoad-bearing screw-gate carabiners are used to connect the [[Umbilical cable#Diver|diver's umbilical]] to the [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied diver's]] harness. They are usually rated for a safe working load of 5&nbsp;kN or more (equivalent to a weight in excess of approximately 500kg).<ref name=\"CoP Inshore\">{{cite book|url=http://www.labour.gov.za/DOL/downloads/documents/useful-documents/occupational-health-and-safety/inshorediving2014.pdf |title=Code Of Practice Inshore Diving |last=Diving Advisory Board |publisher=The South African Department of Labour |accessdate=16 September 2016 |location=Pretoria}}</ref>\n\n==Physical properties==\n\n===Shape===\nCarabiners come in four characteristic shapes:\n#Oval: Symmetric. Most basic and utilitarian. Smooth regular curves are gentle on equipment and allow easy repositioning of loads. Their greatest disadvantage is that a load is shared equally on both the strong solid spine and the weaker gated axis.\n#D: Asymmetric shape transfers the majority of the load onto the spine, the carabiner's strongest axis.\n#Offset-D: Variant of a D with a greater asymmetry, allowing for a wider gate opening.\n#Pear/HMS: Wider and rounder shape at the top than offset-D's, and typically larger. Used for belaying with a [[munter hitch]], and with some belay devices. The largest HMS carabiners can also be used for [[rappelling]] with a munter hitch (the size is needed to accommodate the hitch with two strands of rope). These are usually the heaviest carabiners.\n\n===Locking mechanisms===\nThere are three broad categories of carabiner: auto locking, manual locking, and non-locking.\n\n====Non-locking====\nNon-locking carabiners (or ''snap-links'')<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.climbers-club.co.uk/journal/original/1953%20Journal-p144-150.pdf|title = Climber's Club Journal|date = |accessdate = 24 April 2005|website = Climber's Club|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> have a sprung swinging gate that accepts a rope, webbing sling, or other hardware. Rock climbers frequently connect two non-locking carabiners with a short length of nylon web to create a [[quickdraw]].\n\nTwo gate types are common:\n#Solid gate: The more traditional carabiner design, incorporating a solid metal gate with separate pin and spring mechanisms. Most modern carabiners feature a 'key-lock nose shape and gate opening, which is less prone to snagging than traditional notch and pin design. Most locking carabiners are based on the solid gate design.\n\n#Wire gate: A single piece of bent spring-steel wire forms the gate, with no separate spring or pins needed (it is a form of '[[living hinge]]'). Wire gate carabiners are significantly lighter than solid gates, with roughly the same strength. Wire gates are less prone to icing up than solid gates, an advantage in Alpine mountaineering and ice climbing. The reduced gate mass makes their wire bales less prone to 'gate flutter,' a dangerous condition created when the carabiner suddenly impacts rock or other hard surfaces during a fall, and the gate opens momentarily due to momentum (and both lowers the breaking strength of the carabiner when open, and potentially allows the rope to escape). Simple wiregate designs feature a notch that can snag objects (similar to original solid gate designs), but newer designs feature a shroud or guide wires around the 'hooked' part of the carabiner nose to prevent snagging.\n\nBoth solid and wire gate carabiners can be either 'straight gate' or 'bent gate'. Bent-gate carabiners are easier to clip a rope into using only one hand, and so are often used for the rope-end carabiner of quickdraws and alpine draws used for [[lead climbing]].\n\n====Locking====\n{{unsourced|section|date=December 2017}}\nLife supporting carabiners such as those used in tree climbing need to be strong (thus strength ratings), but also secure against unintentional opening under use. All carabiners with a spring loaded gate \"are self closing\" (single action). Several are also \"self locking\" (double action), some even \"self double locking\" (triple action).\n\nLocking carabiners have the same general shape as non-locking carabiners but have an additional mechanism securing the gate. These mechanisms may be either threaded sleeves (\"screw-lock\"), spring-loaded sleeves (\"twist-lock\"), magnetic levers (\"Magnetron\"), other spring loaded unlocking levers or opposing double spring loaded gates (\"Twin-Gate\"),.[[File:Sicherheitskarabiner.jpg|right|thumb|Carabiner with multiple combined auto lock and quick release, useful in [[via ferrata]] and [[arborist]] work.]]\n\n*Screw-lock (or screw gate): Have a threaded sleeve over the gate which must be engaged and disengaged manually. They have fewer moving parts than spring-loaded mechanisms, are less prone to malfunctioning due to contamination or component fatigue, and are easier to employ one-handed. They, however, require more total effort and are more time-consuming than pull-lock, twist-lock or lever-lock.\n*Twist-lock, push-lock, twist-and-push-lock: Have a security sleeve over the gate which must be manually rotated and/or pulled to disengage, but which springs automatically to locked position upon release.  They offer the advantage of re-engaging without additional user input, but being spring-loaded are prone to both spring fatigue and their more complex mechanisms becoming balky from dirt, ice, or other contamination. They are also difficult to open one-handed and with gloves on.\n* Multiple-levers: Having at least two spring loaded levers that are each operated with one hand action to unlock the next ones movement, the last (third or later) action opening the gate.\n* Magnetic: Have two small levers with embedded magnets on either side of the locking gate which must be pushed towards each other or pinched simultaneously to unlock. Upon release the levers pull shut and into the locked position against a small steel insert in the carabiner nose. With the gate open the magnets in the two levers repel each other so they do not lock or stick together, which might prevent the gate from closing properly. Advantages are very easy one-handed operation, re-engaging without additional user input and few mechanical parts that can fail.\n*Double-Gate: Have two opposed overlapping gates at the opening which prevent a rope or anchor from inadvertently passing through the gate in either direction. Gates may only be opened by pushing outwards from in between towards either direction. The carabiner can therefore be opened by splitting the gates with a fingertip, allowing easy one hand operation. The likelihood of a rope under tension to split the gates is therefore practically none. The lack of a rotating lock prevents a rolling knot, such as the Munter hitch, from unlocking the gate and passing through, giving a measure of inherent safety in use and reducing mechanical complexity.\n\n==Certification==\n\n===Europe===\n*Recreation: Carabiners sold for use in climbing in Europe must conform to standard EN 12275:1998 \"Mountaineering equipment \u2013 Connectors \u2013 Safety requirements and test methods\", which governs testing protocols, rated strengths, and markings. A breaking stress of at least 20 [[kilonewton|kN]] (20,000 newtons = approximately 2040 kilograms of force which is significantly more than the weight of a small car) with the gate closed and 7 [[kilonewton|kN]] with the gate open is the standard for most climbing applications, although requirements vary depending on the activity.<ref>{{cite web|title=EN12275 and UIAA-121 testing protocols|url=http://www.paci.com.au/Downloads/S-EN12275_simplified.pdf|publisher=Professional Association of Climbing Instructors|accessdate=5 December 2017}}</ref>\nCarabiners are marked on the side with single letters showing their intended area of use, for example, K ([[via ferrata]]), B (base), and H (for belaying with an Italian or [[Munter hitch]]).\n\n*Industry: Carabiners used for access in commercial and industrial environments within Europe must comply with EN 362:2004 \"Personal protective equipment against falls from a height. Connectors.\" The minimum gate closed breaking strain of a carabiner conforming with EN 362:2004 is nominally the same as that of EN 12275:1998 at around 20 [[kilonewton|kN]]. Carabiners complying with both EN 12275:1998 and EN 362:2004 are available.\n\n===United States===\n*Fall protection: Carabiners used for fall protection in US industry are classified as \"connectors\" and are required to meet [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] standard 1910.66 App C ''Personal Fall Arrest System'' which specifies \"drop forged, pressed or formed steel, or made of equivalent materials\" and a minimum breaking strength of {{convert|5000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[American National Standards Institute]]/[[American Society of Safety Engineers]] standard ANSI Z359.1-2007 ''Safety Requirement for Personal Fall Arrest Systems, Subsystems and Components'', section 3.2.1.4 (for snap hooks and carabiners) is a voluntary consensus standard. This standard requires that all connectors/ carabiners support a minimum breaking strength (MBS) of {{convert|5000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} and feature an auto-locking gate mechanism which supports a minimum breaking strength (MBS) of {{convert|3600|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}.\n\n*Rescue: Minimum [[breaking strength]] requirements and calculations for rescue carabiners are set out in [[National Fire Protection Association]] standard 1983-2012 edition ''Fire Service Life Safety Rope and Equipment''. The standard defines two classes of rescue carabiners. Technical use rescue carabiners are required to have minimum breaking strengths of 27&nbsp;kN gate closed, 7&nbsp;kN gate open and 7&nbsp;kN minor axis. General use rescue carabiners are required to have minimum breaking strengths of 40&nbsp;kN gate closed, 11&nbsp;kN gate open and 11&nbsp;kN minor axis. Testing procedures for rescue carabiners are set out in [[ASTM International]] standard F 1956 ''Standard Specification of Rescue Carabiners''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rock climbing equipment]]\n*[[Maillon]]\n*[[Glossary of climbing terms]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Climbing-nav}}\n\n[[Category:Climbing equipment]]\n[[Category:Caving equipment]]\n[[Category:German inventions]]\n[[Category:Mountaineering equipment]]\n[[Category:Fasteners]]", "sha1": "0w6bjr2o615kn2xhptgo7vz81yclhyx"}}, {"title": "Continuity (fiction)", "ns": "0", "id": "5899", "revision": {"id": "858030843", "parentid": "858027532", "timestamp": "2018-09-04T16:44:28Z", "contributor": {"username": "Argento Surfer", "id": "15145848"}, "comment": "/* Plot errors */ this isn't TV Tropes", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2008}}\n{{Original research|date=March 2013}}\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=March 2013}}\n{{essay-like|date=May 2015}}\n{{peacock|date=May 2015}}\n}}\nIn fiction, '''continuity''' is consistency of the characteristics of people, plot, objects, and places seen by the reader or viewer over some period of time. It is relevant to several media.\n\nContinuity is particularly a concern in the production of film and television due to the difficulty of rectifying an error in continuity after shooting has wrapped up. It also applies to other art forms, including novels, comics, and [[video games]], though usually on a smaller scale.  It also applies to fiction used by persons, corporations, and governments in the public eye.\n\nMost productions have a [[script supervisor]] on hand whose job is to pay attention to and attempt to maintain continuity across the chaotic and typically non-linear production shoot. This takes the form of a large amount of paperwork, photographs, and attention to and memory of large quantities of detail, some of which is sometimes assembled into the [[Bible (writing)|story bible]] for the production. It usually regards factors both within the scene and often even technical details including meticulous records of camera positioning and equipment settings. The use of a [[Polaroid camera]] was standard but has since been replaced by [[digital camera]]s. All of this is done so that, ideally, all related shots can match, despite perhaps parts being shot thousands of miles and several months apart. It is an inconspicuous job because if done perfectly, no one will ever notice.\n \nIn comic books, continuity has also come to mean a set of contiguous events, sometimes said to be \"set in the same universe\" (see [[fictional crossover]] and [[fictional universe]]) or \"separate universes\" (see [[intercompany crossover]]).\n\n==Continuity errors==<!-- This section is linked from [[Futurama]] -->\nMost continuity errors are subtle and minor, such as changes in the level of drink in a character's glass or the length of a cigarette, and can be permitted with relative indifference even to the final cut. Others can be more noticeable, such as sudden drastic changes in appearance of a character. Such errors in continuity can ruin the illusion of realism and affect [[suspension of disbelief]].\n\nIn cinema, special attention must be paid to continuity because films are rarely shot in the order in which they are presented. The shooting schedule is often dictated by location permit issues. For example, a character may return to [[Times Square]] in New York City several times throughout a movie, but as it is extraordinarily expensive to close off Times Square, those scenes will likely be filmed all at once to reduce permit costs. Weather, the ambience of natural light, cast and crew availability, or any number of other circumstances can also influence a shooting schedule.\n\n=== {{anchor|Attempts to prevent continuity errors in film}} Measures against continuity errors in film ===\n\nFilm production companies use various techniques to prevent continuity errors. First would be to film all the shots for a particular scene together, and all shots of consecutive scenes together (if the scenes take place together, with no break between them in the film's timeline). This allows actors to remain in costume, in character, and in the same location (and with the same weather, if shooting on location).\n\nThe second major technique is for costume designers, production designers, prop masters, and make-up artists to take instant photographs of actors and sets at the beginning and end of each day's shooting (once made possible by [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] cameras, now done with digital cameras and cell phones as well). This allows the various workers to check each day's clothing, set, props, and make-up against a previous day's.\n\nThe third is to avoid shooting on location entirely, but instead film everything on a studio set. This allows weather and lighting to be controlled (as the shooting is indoors), and for all clothing and sets to be stored in one place to be hauled out the next day from a secure location.\n\n===Editing errors===\nEditing errors can occur when a character in a scene references a scene or incident that has not occurred yet, or of which they should not yet be aware.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nAn example of an editing error can be seen in the film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), where a scene of people climbing a slope at the start is seen from below and then replayed from above.\n\n===Visual errors===\nVisual errors are instant ''discontinuities'' occurring in visual media such as film and television. Items of clothing change colors, shadows get longer or shorter, items within a scene change place or disappear, etc.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of a ''visual error'' appears in [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[1914 in film|1914]] movie ''[[The Property Man]]''. Here, in a supposedly smooth step from one room to another, [[the Tramp]] loses his hat in one room, but it is instantly back on his head as he enters the next room. Rather \"loose\" plots and a lack of [[continuity editing]] made most early films rife with such errors.\n\nAnother example occurs in the [[1998 in film|1998]] film ''[[Waking Ned]]'', when two of the film's characters, Jackie and Michael, are walking through a storm towards Ned's house. The umbrella they are under is black during their conversation as they walk towards the house (filmed from slightly above and to the front), yet after cutting to a lower shot (filmed from behind Jackie), Michael walks onscreen from the right holding an [[umbrella]] that is not black but beige, with a brown band at the rim.\n\nYet another glaring example of poor continuity occurs in the Disney film ''[[Pete\u2019s Dragon]]'' (filmed in 1976). During the song \"Brazzle Dazzle Day\" when Lampie (Mickey Rooney), Pete (Sean Marshall), and Nora (Helen Reddy) climb the stairs to the top of the lighthouse, Pete's shirt beneath his overalls is orange. But after descending to the bottom again and coming out of the lighthouse door, his shirt is now grey.\n\nThough visual continuity errors are logically confined to visual media, parallel mistakes can occur in text. In \"[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale|The Miller's Tale]]\" in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', a door is ripped off its hinges only to be slowly closed again in the next scene.\n\n===Plot errors===\n{{main|Plot hole}}\n\nA plot error, or a plot hole as it's commonly known, reflects a failure in the consistency of the created fictional world. A character might state he was an only child, yet later mention a sibling. In the TV show ''[[Cheers]]'', Frasier Crane's wife Lilith mentions Frasier's parents are both dead. When the character was spun off into ''[[Frasier]]'', his father became a central character with, in a case of [[retroactive continuity]], the explanation that Frasier was embarrassed about his father's lowbrow attitudes and thus claimed his death. This is a frequent occurrence in sitcoms, where networks may agree to continue a show, but only if a certain character is emphasized, leading other minor characters to written out of the show with no further mention of the character's existence, while the emphasized character (usually a [[breakout character]], as in the case of [[Frasier Crane]]) develops a more complete back story that ignores previous, more simplified back stories.\n\n===Homeric Nod===\n{{Wiktionary|Homer nods}}\nA '''Homeric nod''' (sometimes heard as 'Even Homer nods') is a continuity error. It has its origins in [[Homer]]ic [[epic poetry|epic]].\n\nThe [[proverbial phrase]] for it was coined by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet [[Horace]] in his ''[[Ars poetica]]'':<ref>Lines 358-359.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>''... et idem'' <br /> ''indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus''</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>... and yet I also become annoyed whenever the great Homer [[wikt:nod|nod]]s off.</blockquote>\n\nThere are numerous continuity errors in Homer that resemble \"nods\", as for example:\n\n*In ''[[Iliad]]'',<ref>Book V Lines 576-579</ref> [[Menelaos]] kills a minor character, Pylaimenes, in combat; who is later<ref>Book XIII Lines 643-659</ref> still alive to witness the death of his son.\n*In ''Iliad'' 9.165-93 three characters, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoinix]], [[Odysseus]], and [[Telamonian Aias|Aias]] set out on an embassy to [[Achilleus]]; however, at line 182 the poet uses a verb in the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form to indicate that there are only two people going; at lines 185ff. verbs in the [[plural]] form are used, indicating more than two; but another dual verb appears at line 192 (\"the two of them came forward\").\n\nIn modern [[Homeric scholarship]] many of Homer's \"nods\" are explicable as the consequences of the poem being retold and improvised by generations of oral poets. So in the second case cited above, it is likely that two different versions are being conflated: one version with an embassy of three people, another with just two people.\n\n[[Alexander Pope]] was inclined to give Homeric nods the benefit of the doubt:\n\n<blockquote>Those oft are Stratagems which Errors seem,<br />Nor is it Homer Nods, but We that Dream. - ''[[Essay on Criticism]]'' </blockquote>\n\n====Modern usage====\nIn his online column, ''Best of The Web Today'', [[James Taranto]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' often used the phrase \"Homer Nods\" as the title of a retraction or correction.\n\n===Aging discrepancies===\nThe practice of accelerating the age of a television character (usually a child or teenager) in conflict with the timeline of a series and/or the real-world progression of time is popularly known as [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome]], or SORAS.<ref name=\"Rising Stars\">{{cite web |url=http://tonight.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3215940&fSectionId=434&fSetId=204 |title=Soaps' rising stars |first=Kim |last=Clayton-Millar |date=April 24, 2006 |work=Tonight |publisher=Independent News & Media |accessdate=December 17, 2009 }}</ref> Children unseen on screen for a time might reappear portrayed by an actor several years older than the original.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bird |first1=S.

On ''[[Lost (TV Series)]]'', the character of 10-year-old [[Walt Lloyd]] was played by 12-year-old [[Malcolm David Kelley]]. The first few seasons took place over the course of just a few months, but by that point Lloyd looked much older than 10. In his remaining few appearances, special effects were used to make him look younger, or the scene took place years later.\n\n==Deliberate continuity errors==\n\nSometimes a work of fiction may deliberately employ continuity errors, usually for comedy. For example, the [[Marx Brothers]]' classic film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', at the climax of the film, the camera shows a [[shot (filmmaking)|shot]] of [[Groucho Marx]] speaking a line, followed by a shot of something else happening, followed by another shot of Groucho. Each time, Groucho's hat changes, usually to something more outrageous than before (a [[Napoleon]]ic hat, a [[Prussia]]n hat, etc.).\n\n==Dealing with errors==\nWhen continuity mistakes have been made, explanations are often proposed by either writers or fans to smooth over discrepancies. Fans sometimes make up explanations for such errors that may or may not be integrated into [[canon (fiction)|canon]]; this has come to be colloquially known as ''fanwanking'' (a term originally coined by the author [[Craig Hinton]] to describe excessive use of continuity).<ref>{{cite book |title=AHistory: An Unauthorized History of the ''Doctor Who'' universe |last=Parkin |first=Lance |authorlink=Lance Parkin  |year=2007 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Mad Norwegian Press]] |location=Des Moines, Iowa |isbn=978-0-9759446-6-0 |page=13}}</ref> Often when fans do not agree with one of the events in a story (such as the death of a favorite character), they will choose to ignore the event in question so that their enjoyment of the franchise is not diminished. When the holder of the intellectual property discards all existing continuity and starts from scratch it is known as [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooting]]. Fans call a less extreme literary technique that erases one episode the [[reset button technique|reset button]]. See also [[Canon (fiction)#Fanon|fanon]].\n\nDiscrepancies in past continuity are sometimes made deliberately; this is known as [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ning. Retcons are also sometimes used to either correct or cover up a perceived error.

However, traditional films have frequently had much of the same sort of the issues to deal with; film shoots may last several months and as scenes are frequently shot out of story sequence, footage shot weeks apart may be edited together as part of the same day's action in the completed film. In some ways, ''24'' presents a simpler situation, as costumes and hairstyles generally should ''not'' change very frequently; in many feature films a range of different hairstyles and costumes must be created, changed, and then recreated exactly, as various scenes are shot.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | title=Script Supervising and Film Continuity, Third Edition | first=Pat | last=Miller | isbn=0-240-80294-2 | publisher=[[Focal Press]] |date=December 1998}}\n* {{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/10/james-bond-quantum-solace-mistakes | publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | accessdate=2008-12-21 | date=2008-11-10 | title=An Aston Martini, stirred not shaken, please Pennymoney / Site lists 007 continuity gaffes in new Bond film / Odd Corsas, corpses and capitals spotted in movie | first=Audrey | last=Gillan }}\n* {{cite news | title=When Continuity Counts, Call a Script Girl \u2014 Er, Guy | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=19201451 | publisher=[[National Public Radio]] | first=Susan | last=Stamberg | date=2008-02-21 | accessdate=2008-12-21 }}\n* {{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/classified/jobs/counselor/la-counselor-080505,0,5204004.htmlstory |publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |accessdate=2008-12-21 |date=2005-08-05 |first=Susan W. |last=Miller |title=Career Counselor: Script Supervisor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203234752/http://www.latimes.com/classified/jobs/counselor/la-counselor-080505%2C0%2C5204004.htmlstory |archivedate=February 3, 2009 |df= }} \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Continuity (Fiction)}}\n[[Category:Style (fiction)]]\n[[Category:Narratology]]\n[[Category:Continuity (fiction)| ]]\n[[Category:Phrases]]\n[[Category:Homeric style]]", "sha1": "nitm4plqlnc0lkevhpy6sgnna87odsj"}}, {"title": "Corporate Police State", "ns": "0", "id": "5900", "redirect": {"title": "Megacorporation"}, "revision": {"id": "148286675", "parentid": "44022719", "timestamp": "2007-07-31T15:22:06Z", "contributor": {"username": "RussBot", "id": "279219"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Robot: Fixing [[Special:DoubleRedirects|double-redirect]] -\"Corporate police state\" +\"Megacorporation\"", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Megacorporation]]", "sha1": "jfx830v3d9q3vu6rvvh17wf3cqy460h"}}, {"title": "Capital punishment", "ns": "0", "id": "5902", "revision": {"id": "866753990", "parentid": "866753708", "timestamp": "2018-11-01T10:19:24Z", "contributor": {"username": "Amurph1997", "id": "34645335"}, "minor": "", "comment": "added punctuation", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{other uses|Capital punishment (disambiguation)|Letter case#Case styles}}\n{{pp-semi-indef}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{redirect-multi|4|Death penalty|Death sentence|Execution|Place of Execution}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2012}}\n{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}\n'''Capital punishment''', also known as the '''death penalty''', is a government-sanctioned practice whereby a person is killed by the state as a punishment for a crime. The [[sentence (law)|sentence]] that someone be punished in such a manner is referred to as a '''death sentence''', whereas the act of carrying out the sentence is known as an '''execution'''. Crimes that are punishable by death are known as '''capital crimes''' or '''capital offences''', and they commonly include offences such as [[murder]], [[treason]], [[espionage]], [[war crime]]s, [[crimes against humanity]] and [[genocide]]. Etymologically, the term ''capital'' (lit. \"of the head\", derived via the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|capitalis}}'' from ''{{lang|la|caput}}'', \"head\") in this context alluded to execution by beheading.<ref name=\"KronenwetterP202\">{{Harvnb|Kronenwetter|2001|p=202}}</ref>\n\nFifty-six countries retain capital punishment, 103 countries have completely abolished it ''[[de jure]]'' for all crimes, six have abolished it for ordinary crimes (while maintaining it for special circumstances such as war crimes), and 30 are abolitionist in practice.<ref name=\"amnesty2015\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/3487/2016/en/ |title=Death Sentences and Executions Report 2015 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |access-date=10 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814003146/https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/3487/2016/en/ |archivedate=14 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nCapital punishment is a matter of active controversy in several countries and states, and positions can vary within a single [[political ideology]] or cultural region.

Most historical records and various primitive tribal practices indicate that the death penalty was a part of their justice system. Communal punishment for wrongdoing generally included compensation by the wrongdoer, [[corporal punishment]], [[shunning]], [[exile|banishment]] and execution. Usually, compensation and shunning were enough as a form of justice.<ref>So common was the practice of compensation that the word ''murder'' is derived from the French word ''mordre'' (bite) a reference to the heavy compensation one must pay for causing an unjust death. The \"bite\" one had to pay was used as a term for the crime itself: \"Mordre wol out; that se we day by day.\" \u2013 [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (1340\u20131400), [[The Canterbury Tales]], ''The Nun's Priest's Tale'', l. 4242 (1387\u20131400), repr. In ''The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer'', ed. Alfred W. Pollard, et al. (1898).</ref> The response to crime committed by neighbouring tribes or communities included a formal apology, compensation or blood [[feud]]s.\n\nA [[Feud|blood feud]] or vendetta occurs when arbitration between families or tribes fails or an arbitration system is non-existent. This form of justice was common before the emergence of an arbitration system based on state or organized religion. It may result from crime, land disputes or a code of honour. \"Acts of retaliation underscore the ability of the social collective to defend itself and demonstrate to enemies (as well as potential allies) that injury to property, rights, or the person will not go unpunished.\"<ref>Translated from Waldmann, ''op.cit.'', p. 147.</ref> However, in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between a war of vendetta and one of conquest.\n\nIn most countries that practise capital punishment, it is now reserved for [[murder]], [[terrorism]], [[war crimes]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of military justice.  In some countries sexual crimes, such as [[rape]], [[fornication]], [[adultery]], [[incest]] and [[sodomy]], carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[Hudud]] and [[Qisas]] crimes, such as [[Apostasy from Islam|apostasy]] (formal renunciation of the [[state religion]]), [[Islam and blasphemy|blasphemy]], [[moharebeh]], [[hirabah]], [[Fasad]], [[Mofsed-e-filarz]]   and [[witchcraft]]. In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|countries that use the death penalty]], [[drug trafficking]] is also a capital offence. In [[China]], [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[financial crime]]s are punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world [[courts-martial]] have imposed death sentences for offences such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], and [[mutiny]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |title=Shot at Dawn, campaign for pardons for British and Commonwealth soldiers executed in World War I |accessdate=20 July 2006 |publisher=Shot at Dawn Pardons Campaign |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703143147/http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |archivedate=3 July 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Ancient history===\n[[File:Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me - The Christian Martyrs' Last Prayer - Walters 37113.jpg|thumb|left|''The Christian Martyrs' Last Prayer'', by [[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]] (1883). [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Colosseum]].]]\nElaborations of tribal arbitration of [[feud]]s included peace settlements often done in a religious context and compensation system. Compensation was based on the principle of ''substitution'' which might include material (for example, cattle, slave) compensation, exchange of brides or grooms, or payment of the blood debt. Settlement rules could allow for animal blood to replace human blood, or transfers of property or [[Blood money (term)|blood money]] or in some case an offer of a person for execution. The person offered for execution did not have to be an original perpetrator of the crime because the system was based on tribes, not individuals. Blood feuds could be regulated at meetings, such as the [[Norsemen]] ''[[Thing (assembly)|things]]''.<ref>Lindow, ''op.cit.'' (primarily discusses Icelandic ''things'').</ref> Systems deriving from blood feuds may survive alongside more advanced legal systems or be given recognition by courts (for example, [[trial by combat]]). One of the more modern refinements of the blood feud is the [[duel]].\n\nIn certain parts of the world, nations in the form of ancient republics, monarchies or tribal oligarchies emerged. These nations were often united by common linguistic, religious or family ties. Moreover, expansion of these nations often occurred by conquest of neighbouring tribes or nations. Consequently, various classes of royalty, nobility, various commoners and slave emerged. Accordingly, the systems of tribal arbitration were submerged into a more unified system of justice which formalized the relation between the different \"classes\" rather than \"tribes\". The earliest and most famous example is [[Code of Hammurabi]] which set the different punishment and compensation, according to the different class/group of victims and perpetrators. The [[Torah]] (Jewish Law), also known as the [[Pentateuch]] (the first five books of the Christian [[Old Testament]]), lays down the death penalty for murder, [[kidnapping]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], violation of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], [[blasphemy]], and a wide range of sexual crimes, although evidence suggests that actual executions were rare.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William|last=Schabas|year=2002|title=The Abolition of the Death Penalty in International Law|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-81491-X}}</ref>\n\nA further example comes from [[Ancient Greece]], where the [[Athenian]] legal system was first written down by [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]] in about 621 BC: the death penalty was applied for a particularly wide range of crimes, though [[Solon]] later repealed Draco's code and published new laws, retaining only Draco's homicide statutes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert|url=http://history-world.org/draco_and_solon_laws.htm|title=Greece, A History of Ancient Greece, Draco and Solon Laws|publisher=History-world.org|accessdate=23 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021023919/http://history-world.org/draco_and_solon_laws.htm|archivedate=21 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The word [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] derives from Draco's laws.

When abolishing the death penalty Xuanzong ordered his officials to refer to the nearest regulation by analogy when sentencing those found guilty of crimes for which the prescribed punishment was execution. Thus depending on the severity of the crime a punishment of severe scourging with the thick rod or of exile to the remote Lingnan region might take the place of capital punishment. However, the death penalty was restored only 12 years later in 759 in response to the [[An Lushan Rebellion]].<ref>Benn, pp. 209\u2013210</ref> At this time in the Tang dynasty only the emperor had the authority to sentence criminals to execution. Under [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]] capital punishment was relatively infrequent, with only 24 executions in the year 730 and 58 executions in the year 736.<ref name=\"benn 8\"/>\n\n[[File:Lingchi (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Ling Chi \u2013 execution by [[slow slicing]] \u2013 was a form of torture and execution used in China from roughly AD 900 ([[Tang dynasty|Tang]] era) until it was banned in 1905.]]\nThe two most common forms of execution in the Tang dynasty were strangulation and decapitation, which were the prescribed methods of execution for 144 and 89 offences respectively. Strangulation was the prescribed sentence for lodging an accusation against one's parents or grandparents with a magistrate, scheming to kidnap a person and sell them into slavery and opening a coffin while desecrating a tomb. Decapitation was the method of execution prescribed for more serious crimes such as treason and sedition. Despite the great discomfort involved, most of the Tang Chinese preferred strangulation to decapitation, as a result of the traditional Tang Chinese belief that the body is a gift from the parents and that it is, therefore, disrespectful to one's ancestors to die without returning one's body to the grave intact.\n\nSome further forms of capital punishment were practised in the Tang dynasty, of which the first two that follow at least were extralegal.{{Clarify|if they were extra-legal, they fail the definition of CapPun|date=July 2016}} The first of these was scourging to death with the thick rod{{Clarify|what is scourging with a thick rod? Anal?|date=July 2016}} which was common throughout the Tang dynasty especially in cases of gross corruption. The second was truncation, in which the convicted person was cut in two at the waist with a fodder knife and then left to bleed to death.<ref name=Benn210>Benn, p. 210</ref> A further form of execution called Ling Chi ([[slow slicing]]), or death by/of a thousand cuts, was used from the close of the Tang dynasty (around 900) to its abolition in 1905.\n\nWhen a minister of the fifth grade or above received a death sentence the emperor might grant him a special dispensation allowing him to commit suicide in lieu of execution. Even when this privilege was not granted, the law required that the condemned minister be provided with food and ale by his keepers and transported to the execution ground in a cart rather than having to walk there.\n\nNearly all executions under the Tang dynasty took place in public as a warning to the population. The heads of the executed were displayed on poles or spears. When local authorities decapitated a convicted criminal, the head was boxed and sent to the capital as proof of identity and that the execution had taken place.<ref name=Benn210 />\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Rohrbach-verbrennung-1525.jpg|thumb|upright|The burning of Jakob Rohrbach, a leader of the peasants during the [[German Peasants' War]].]]\n[[File:Lamanie kolem L 001xx.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[breaking wheel]] was used during the Middle Ages and was still in use into the 19th century.]]\n\nIn [[Middle Age|medieval]] and early modern Europe, before the development of modern [[prison]] systems, the death penalty was also used as a generalized form of punishment. During the reign of [[Henry VIII of England]], as many as 72,000 people are estimated to have been executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/history.html|title=History of the Death Penalty|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=12 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113123001/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/history.html|archivedate=13 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn early modern Europe, a massive [[moral panic]] regarding [[witchcraft]] swept across Europe and later the European colonies in North America. During this period, there were widespread claims that malevolent [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[witchcraft|witches]] were operating as an organized threat to [[Christendom]]. As a result, tens of thousands of women were prosecuted for witchcraft and executed through the [[witch trials in the early modern period|witch trials of the early modern period]] (between the 15th and 18th centuries).\n\nThe death penalty also targeted sexual offences such as [[sodomy]]. In England, the [[Buggery Act 1533]] stipulated hanging as punishment for \"[[buggery]]\". [[James Pratt and John Smith]] were the last two Englishmen to be executed for sodomy in 1835.<ref>{{cite book | title=A Gay History of Britain: Love and Sex Between Men Since the Middle Ages | publisher=Greenwood World Publishing | last1=Cook |first1=Matt | last2=Mills |first2=Robert | last3=Trumback |first3=Randolph | last4=Cocks |first4=Harry | year=2007 |page=109| isbn=1846450020}}</ref>\n\nDespite the wide use of the death penalty, calls for reform were not unknown. The 12th century [[Jewish]] legal scholar, Moses [[Maimonides]], wrote, \"It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent man to death.\" He argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing [[Legal burden of proof|burdens of proof]], until we would be convicting merely \"according to the judge's caprice\". Maimonides's concern was maintaining popular respect for law, and he saw errors of commission as much more threatening than errors of omission.<ref name=\"Moses Maimonides 1967\">Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg.

These were mainly property offences, for example cutting down a cherry tree in an orchard.<ref name=\"JonesJohnstone2011\">{{cite book|author1=Mark Jones|author2=Peter Johnstone|title=History of Criminal Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhPdaCJWQikC&pg=PA152|date=22 July 2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-4377-3491-1|pages=150\u2013}}</ref> In 1820, there were 160, including crimes such as shoplifting, petty theft or stealing cattle.<ref>Durant, Will and Ariel, ''The Story of Civilization, Volume IX: The Age of Voltaire'' New York, 1965, p. 71</ref> The severity of the so-called [[Bloody Code]] was often tempered by juries who refused to convict, or judges, in the case of petty theft, who arbitrarily set the value stolen at below the statutory level for a capital crime.<ref>Durant, Will and Ariel, ''The Story of Civilization, Volume IX: The Age of Voltaire'' New York, 1965, p. 72,</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Mexican execution, 1914.jpg|left|thumb|Mexican execution by firing squad, 1916]]\n\nIn [[Nazi Germany#Law|Nazi Germany]] there were three types of capital punishment; hanging, decapitation and death by shooting.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gN0QgcW4Td0C&pg=PA289&lpg=PA289|page= 289|title=The criminal law of Japan: the general part|author=Dando Shigemitsu|year=1999}}</ref> Also, modern military organisations employed capital punishment as a means of maintaining military discipline.

According to [[Robert Conquest]], the leading expert on [[Joseph Stalin#Famine and the Great Terror: 1932\u20131939|Joseph Stalin's purges]], more than one million [[Soviet Union#Stalin era|Soviet citizens were executed]] during [[the Great Terror]] of 1937\u201338, almost all by a bullet to the back of the head.<ref>Conquest, Robert, ''[[The Great Terror]]: A Reassessment'', New York, pp. 485\u201386</ref> [[Mao Zedong]] publicly stated that \"800,000\" people had been executed in China during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966-1976). Partly as a response to such excesses, civil rights organizations started to place increasing emphasis on the concept of [[human rights]] and an abolition of the death penalty.\n\n===Contemporary era===\n\nAmong countries around the world,  all European (except [[Capital punishment in Belarus|Belarus]]) and many [[Oceania|Oceanic]] states (including [[Capital punishment in Australia|Australia]], [[Capital punishment in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[East Timor]]), and [[Capital punishment in Canada|Canada]] have abolished capital punishment. In [[Latin America]], most states have completely abolished the use of capital punishment, while some countries such as [[Capital punishment in Brazil|Brazil]] and [[Capital punishment in Guatemala|Guatemala]] allow for capital punishment only in exceptional situations, such as treason committed during wartime. The [[Capital punishment in the United States|United States]] (the federal government and 31 of the states), some [[Caribbean]] countries and the majority of countries in Asia (for example, [[Capital punishment in Japan|Japan]] and [[Capital punishment in India|India]]) retain capital punishment. In Africa, less than half of countries retain it, for example [[Capital punishment in Botswana|Botswana]] and [[Zambia]]. South Africa [[Capital punishment in South Africa|abolished the death penalty]] in 1995.\n\nAbolition was often adopted due to political change, as when countries shifted from authoritarianism to democracy, or when it became an entry condition for the European Union. The United States is a notable exception: some states have had bans on capital punishment for decades, the earliest being [[Michigan]] where it was abolished in 1846, while other states still actively use it today. The death penalty in the United States remains a contentious issue which is [[Capital punishment debate in the United States|hotly debated]].\n\nIn retentionist countries, the debate is sometimes revived when a miscarriage of justice has occurred though this tends to cause legislative efforts to improve the judicial process rather than to abolish the death penalty. In abolitionist countries, the debate is sometimes revived by particularly brutal murders though few countries have brought it back after abolishing it. However, a spike in serious, violent crimes, such as murders or terrorist attacks, has prompted some countries to effectively end the moratorium on the death penalty. One notable example is [[Capital punishment in Pakistan|Pakistan]] which in December 2014 lifted a six-year moratorium on executions after the [[2014 Peshawar school massacre|Peshawar school massacre]] during which 132 students and 9 members of staff of the Army Public School and Degree College Peshawar were killed by [[Taliban]] terrorists.

Sir [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published in 1516, debated the benefits of the death penalty in dialogue form, coming to no firm conclusion.  More was himself executed for treason in 1535. More recent opposition to the death penalty stemmed from the book of the Italian [[Cesare Beccaria]] ''Dei Delitti e Delle Pene'' (\"[[On Crimes and Punishments]]\"), published in 1764. In this book, Beccaria aimed to demonstrate not only the injustice, but even the futility from the point of view of [[social policy|social welfare]], of [[torture]] and the death penalty. Influenced by the book, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Grand Duke Leopold II]] of Habsburg, the future Emperor of Austria, abolished the death penalty in the then-independent [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], the first permanent abolition in modern times.  On 30 November 1786, after having ''de facto'' blocked executions (the last was in 1769), Leopold promulgated the reform of the [[penal code]] that abolished the death penalty and ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital execution in his land. In 2000, Tuscany's regional authorities instituted an annual holiday on 30 November to commemorate the event. The event is commemorated on this day by 300 cities around the world celebrating [[Cities for Life Day]].\n\nThe [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] banned capital punishment in 1849.

The last execution in San Marino had taken place in 1468. In Portugal, after legislative proposals in 1852 and 1863, the death penalty was abolished in 1867. The last execution of the death penalty in Brazil was 1876, from there all the condemnations were commuted by the Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] until it's abolition for civil offences and military offences in peacetime in 1891. The penalty for crimes committed in peacetime was then reinstated and abolished again twice (1938\u201353 and 1969\u201378), but on those occasions it was restricted to acts of terrorism or subversion considered \"internal warfare\" and all sentence were commuted and were not carried out.\n\nAbolition occurred in [[Capital punishment in Canada#History|Canada in 1976 (except for some military offences, with complete abolition in 1998)]], in [[Capital punishment in France#Abolition|France in 1981]], and in [[Capital punishment in Australia#Commonwealth|Australia in 1973]] (although the state of [[Capital punishment in Australia#Western Australia|Western Australia]] retained the penalty until 1984).

The death penalty was removed from peacetime law by [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|the National Assembly]] in August 2002, and in May 2004 Turkey amended [[Constitution of Turkey|its constitution]] in order to remove capital punishment in all circumstances.

This embodies all [[art]] forms, the [[science]]s, and [[philosophies]]. Historically, different nations or regions of the world have gone through their own independent sequence of movements in [[culture]], but as world communications have accelerated this geographical distinction has become less distinct. When cultural movements go through revolutions from one to the next, genres tend to get attacked and mixed up, and often new genres are generated and old ones fade. These changes are often reactions against the prior cultural form, which typically has grown stale and repetitive. An obsession emerges among the mainstream with the new movement, and the old one falls into neglect \u2013 sometimes it dies out entirely, but often it chugs along favored in a few disciplines and occasionally making reappearances (sometimes prefixed with \"neo-\").\n\nThere is continual argument over the precise definition of each of these periods, and one historian might group them differently, or choose different names or descriptions. As well, even though in many cases the popular change from one to the next can be swift and sudden, the beginning and end of movements are somewhat subjective, as the movements did not spring fresh into existence out of the blue and did not come to an abrupt end and lose total support, as would be suggested by a date range. Thus use of the term \"period\" is somewhat deceptive. \"Period\" also suggests a linearity of development, whereas it has not been uncommon for two or more distinctive cultural approaches to be active at the same time. Historians will be able to find distinctive traces of a cultural movement before its accepted beginning, and there will always be new creations in old forms. So it can be more useful to think in terms of broad \"movements\" that have rough beginnings and endings. Yet for historical perspective, some rough date ranges will be provided for each to indicate the \"height\" or accepted time span of the movement.\n\nThis current article covers western, notably European and American cultural movements. They have, however, been paralleled by cultural movements in the Orient and elsewhere. In the late 20th and early 21st century in Thailand, for example, there has been a cultural shift away from western social and political values more toward Japanese and Chinese. As well, That culture has reinvigorated monarchical concepts to accommodate state shifts away from western ideology regarding democracy and monarchies. \n<!-- NOTE: I'm including the sub-sections (the isms) *only* for organizational purposes since in most cases Wikipedia does not have articles on the various sections/periods/movements/whatever. Similarly for calling out the different cultural forms - art, architecture, philosophy, etc. I also think it is worthwhile to include short descriptions of each movement for similar reasons. The purpose of this page is to help get these areas of Wikipedia filled in \u2013 hopefully by folks more knowledgeable in the particular topics than I! -->\n\n==Cultural movements==\n* [[Graeco-Roman]]\n** The [[ancient Greece|Greek]] culture marked a departure from the other Mediterranean cultures that preceded and surrounded it. The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] adopted Greek and other styles, and spread the result throughout Europe and the [[Middle East]]. Together, Greek and Roman thought in philosophy, religion, science, history, and all forms of thought can be viewed as a central underpinning of [[Western culture]], and is therefore termed the \"Classical period\" by some.

Beginning in the early 17th century with Cartesian thought (see [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]), this movement provided philosophical frameworks for the natural sciences, sought to determine the principles of knowledge by rejecting all things previously believed to be known about the world.

The notion of \"folk genius\", or an inborn and intuitive ability to do magnificent things, is a core principle of the Romantic movement. Nostalgia for the primitive past in preference to the scientifically minded present. [[Romantic hero]]es, exemplified by Napoleon, are popular.

There are numerous organic chalcogen compounds. Not counting oxygen, organic sulfur compounds are generally the most common, followed by organic selenium compounds and organic tellurium compounds. This trend also occurs with chalcogen [[pnictogen|pnictides]] and compounds containing chalcogens and [[carbon group]] elements.\n\nOxygen is generally extracted from air and sulfur is extracted from oil and natural gas.

Such compounds are known as chalcogen halides.{{dubious|date=September 2014}} The majority of simple chalcogen halides are well-known and widely used as chemical [[reagent]]s. However, more complicated chalcogen halides, such as sulfenyl, sulfonyl, and sulfuryl halides, are less well known to science. Out of the compounds consisting purely of chalcogens and halogens, there are a total of 13 chalcogen fluorides, nine chalcogen chlorides, eight chalcogen bromides, and six chalcogen iodides that are known.{{dubious|date=September 2014}} The heavier chalcogen halides often have significant molecular interactions. Sulfur fluorides with low valences are fairly unstable and little is known about their properties.{{dubious|date=September 2014}} However, sulfur fluorides with high valences, such as [[sulfur hexafluoride]], are stable and well-known. [[Sulfur tetrafluoride]] is also a well-known sulfur fluoride. Certain selenium fluorides, such as [[selenium difluoride]], have been produced in small amounts. The crystal structures of both [[selenium tetrafluoride]] and [[tellurium tetrafluoride]] are known. Chalcogen chlorides and bromides have also been explored. In particular, selenium dichloride and sulfur dichloride can react to form [[Organoselenium chemistry|organic selenium compounds]]. Dichalcogen dihalides, such as Se<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> also are known to exist. There are also mixed chalcogen-halogen compounds. These include SeSX, with X being chlorine or bromine.{{dubious|date=September 2014}} Such compounds can form in mixtures of [[sulfur dichloride]] and selenium halides. These compounds have been fairly recently structurally characterized, as of 2008. In general, diselenium and disulfur chlorides and bromides are useful chemical reagents. Chalcogen halides with attached metal atoms are soluble in organic solutions.{{dubious|date=September 2014}} One example of such a compound is [[molybdenum|Mo]]S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>. Unlike selenium chlorides and bromides, selenium [[iodide]]s have not been isolated, as of 2008, although it is likely that they occur in solution. Diselenium diiodide, however, does occur in equilibrium with selenium atoms and iodine molecules. Some tellurium halides with low valences, such as Te<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and Te<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>, form [[polymer]]s when in the [[Solid-state chemistry|solid state]]. These tellurium halides can be synthesized by the reduction of pure tellurium with [[superhydride]] and reacting the resulting product with tellurium tetrahalides. Ditellurium dihalides tend to get less stable as the halides become lower in atomic number and atomic mass. Tellurium also forms iodides with even fewer iodine atoms than diiodies. These include TeI and Te<sub>2</sub>I. These compounds have extended structures in the solid state.

Thiols are the most stable chalcogenols and tellurols are the least stable, being unstable in heat or light. Other organic chalcogen compounds include [[thioether]]s, [[selenoether]]s and telluroethers. Some of these, such as [[dimethyl sulfide]], [[diethyl sulfide]], and [[dipropyl sulfide]] are commercially available. Selenoethers are in the form of [[side chain|R]]<sub>2</sub>Se or [[side chain|R]]SeR.

These compounds have numerous applications, including [[Match#The strike-anywhere match|strike-anywhere matches]] and [[quantum dot]]s. A total of 130,000 compounds with at least one phosphorus-sulfur bond, 6000 compounds with at least one phosphorus-selenium bond, and 350 compounds with at least one phosphorus-tellurium bond have been discovered.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The decrease in the number of chalcogen-phosphorus compounds further down the periodic table is due to diminishing bond strength. Such compounds tend at least one phosphorus atom in the center, surrounded by four chalcogens and [[side chain]]s. However, some phosphorus-chalcogen compounds also contain hydrogen (such as secondary [[phosphine]] chalcogenides) or nitrogen (such as dichalcogenoimidodiphosphates). [[Phosphorus selenide]]s are typically harder to handle that phosphorus sulfides, and compounds in the form P<sub>x</sub>Te<sub>y</sub> have not been discovered. Chalcogens also bond with other [[pnictogens]], such as [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], and [[bismuth]]. Heavier chalcogen pnictides tend to form [[ribbon]]-like polymers instead of individual molecules. Chemical formulas of these compounds include Bi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> and Sb<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>. Ternary chalcogen pnictides are also known. Examples of these include P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>Se and P<sub>3</sub>SbS<sub>3</sub>. [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] containing chalcogens and pnictogens also exist.

[[Robert Hooke]], [[Mikhail Lomonosov]], [[Ole Borch]], and [[Pierre Bayden]] all successfully created oxygen, but did not realize it at the time. Oxygen was discovered by [[Joseph Priestley]] in 1774 when he focused sunlight on a sample of [[mercuric oxide]] and collected the resulting gas. [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] had also created oxygen in 1771 by the same method, but Scheele did not publish his results until 1777.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nTellurium was first discovered in 1783 by [[Franz Joseph M\u00fcller von Reichenstein]]. He discovered tellurium in a sample of what is now known as calaverite. M\u00fcller assumed at first that the sample was pure antimony, but tests he ran on the sample did not agree with this. Muller then guessed that the sample was [[bismuth sulfide]], but tests confirmed that the sample was not that. For some years, Muller pondered the problem. Eventually he realized that the sample was gold bonded with an unknown element. In 1796, M\u00fcller sent part of the sample to the German chemist [[Martin Klaproth]], who purified the undiscovered element. Klaproth decided to call the element tellurium after the Latin word for earth.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nSelenium was discovered in 1817 by [[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius]].

In 1865 a large deposit of elemental sulfur was discovered in the U.S. states of Louisiana and Texas, but it was difficult to extract at the time. In the 1890s, [[Herman Frasch]] came up with the solution of liquefying the sulfur with superheated steam and pumping the sulfur up to the surface. These days sulfur is instead more often extracted from [[oil]], [[natural gas]], and [[tar]].<ref name = \"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe world production of selenium is around 1500 metric tons per year, out of which roughly 10% is recycled. Japan is the largest producer, producing 800 metric tons of selenium per year. Other large producers include Belgium (300 metric tons per year), the United States (over 200 metric tons per year), Sweden (130 metric tons per year), and Russia (100 metric tons per year). Selenium can be extracted from the waste from the process of electrolytically refining copper. Another method of producing selenium is to farm selenium-gathering plants such as [[milk vetch]].

As of 2011, roughly 25 atoms of livermorium had been synthesized.<ref name = \"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n==Applications==\n\n[[Steelmaking]] is the most important use of oxygen; 55% of all oxygen produced goes to this application. The [[chemical industry]] also uses large amounts of oxygen; 25% of all oxygen produced goes to this application. The remaining 20% of oxygen produced is mostly split between medical use, [[water treatment]] (as oxygen kills some types of bacteria), [[rocket fuel]] (in liquid form), and metal cutting.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nMost sulfur produced is transformed into [[sulfur dioxide]], which is further transformed into [[sulfuric acid]], a very common industrial chemical. Other common uses include being a key ingredient of [[gunpowder]] and [[Greek fire]], and being used to change soil [[pH]].<ref name=\"The Elements\"/> Sulfur is also mixed into rubber to [[vulcanized rubber|vulcanize]] it.

[[Cadmium telluride]] is used as a high-efficiency material in solar panels.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nSome of polonium's applications relate to the element's radioactivity. For instance, polonium is used as an [[Alpha particle|alpha-particle]] generator for research. Polonium alloyed with [[beryllium]] provides an efficient neutron source. Polonium is also used in nuclear batteries. Most polonium is used in antistatic devices.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Jackson2002\" /> Livermorium does not have any uses whatsoever due to its extreme rarity and short half-life.\n\nOrganochalcogen compounds are involved in the [[semiconductor]] process. These compounds also feature into [[ligand]] chemistry and [[biochemistry]]. One application of chalcogens themselves is to manipulate [[redox]] couples in supramolar chemistry (chemistry involving non-covalent bond interactions). This application leads on to such applications as crystal packing, assembly of large molecules, and biological recognition of patterns. The secondary bonding interactions of the larger chalcogens, selenium and tellurium, can create organic solvent-holding [[acetylene]] [[Inorganic nanotube|nanotube]]s. Chalcogen interactions are useful for conformational analysis and stereoelectronic effects, among other things. Chalcogenides with through bonds also have applications. For instance, [[divalent]] sulfur can stabilize carbanions, [[cation]]ic centers, and [[radical (chemistry)|radical]]. Chalcogens can confer upon ligands (such as DCTO) properties such as being able to transform [[copper|Cu(II)]] to Cu(I). Studying chalcogen interactions gives access to radical cations, which are used in mainstream [[synthetic chemistry]]. Metallic redox centers of biological importance are tunable by interactions of ligands containing chalcogens, such as [[methionine]] and [[selenocysteine]]. Also, chalcogen through-bonds{{dubious|date=September 2014}} can provide insight about the process of electron transfer.<ref name = \"synth\"/>\n\n==Biological role==\n{{main|Dioxygen in biological reactions|Sulfur cycle|Selenium in biology}}\n[[File:DNA chemical structure.svg|thumb|DNA, an important biological compound containing oxygen]]\n[[Oxygen]] is needed by almost all [[life|organisms]] for the purpose of generating [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

Most tellurium in the blood stream is excreted slowly in urine, but some is converted to dimethyl telluride and released through the lungs. On average, humans ingest about 600 micrograms of tellurium daily. Plants can take up some tellurium from the soil.

Carbon dioxide consists of a [[carbon]] [[atom]] [[covalent bond|covalently]] [[double bond]]ed to two [[oxygen]] atoms. It occurs naturally in [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] as a [[trace gas]]. The current concentration is about 0.04% (410&nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]]) by volume, having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280&nbsp;ppm.  Natural sources include [[volcano]]es, [[hot spring]]s and [[geyser]]s, and it is freed from [[carbonate rock]]s by [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] in water and acids. Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water, it occurs naturally in [[groundwater]], [[river]]s and [[lake]]s, [[ice cap]]s, [[glacier]]s and [[seawater]]. It is present in deposits of [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]]. Carbon dioxide is odorless at normally encountered concentrations. However, at high concentrations, it has a sharp and acidic odor.<ref name=AirProductsMSDS/>\n\nAs the source of available carbon in the [[carbon cycle]], [[atmospheric carbon dioxide]] is the primary carbon source for [[life|life on Earth]] and its concentration in Earth's pre-industrial atmosphere since late in the [[Precambrian]] has been regulated by [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms and geological phenomena.

Traditionally, the carbonation of beer and sparkling wine came about through natural fermentation, but many manufacturers carbonate these drinks with carbon dioxide recovered from the fermentation process. In the case of bottled and kegged beer, the most common method used is carbonation with recycled carbon dioxide. With the exception of British [[Real Ale]], draught beer is usually transferred from kegs in a cold room or cellar to dispensing taps on the bar using pressurized carbon dioxide, sometimes mixed with nitrogen.\n\n==== Wine making ====\n[[File:Dry ice used to preserve grapes after harvest.jpg|thumb|Dry ice used to preserve grapes after harvest.]]\nCarbon dioxide in the form of [[dry ice]] is often used during the [[cold soak]] phase in [[wine making]] to cool clusters of [[grape]]s quickly after picking to help prevent spontaneous [[Fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] by wild [[yeast (wine)|yeast]]. The main advantage of using dry ice over water ice is that it cools the grapes without adding any additional water that might decrease the [[sugar]] concentration in the [[grape must]], and thus the [[alcohol]] concentration in the finished wine. Carbon dioxide is also used to create a hypoxic environment for [[carbonic maceration]], the process used to produce [[Beaujolais]] wine.\n\nCarbon dioxide is sometimes used to top up wine bottles or other [[storage (wine)|storage]] vessels such as barrels to prevent oxidation, though it has the problem that it can dissolve into the wine, making a previously still wine slightly fizzy. For this reason, other gases such as [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]] are preferred for this process by professional wine makers.\n\n====Stunning animals====\nCarbon dioxide is often used to \"stun\" animals before slaughter.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Andy Coghlan |title=A more humane way of slaughtering chickens might get EU approval |journal=New Scientist |date=Feb 3, 2018 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2159895-a-more-humane-way-of-slaughtering-chickens-might-get-eu-approval}}</ref> \"Stunning\" may be a misnomer, as the animals are not knocked out immediately and may suffer distress.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409003755/http://kb.rspca.org.au/What-is-CO2-stunning_118.html|title=What is CO2 stunning?|publisher=RSPCA}}</ref><ref name=Campbell>{{cite journal |last1=Archie Campbell |title=Humane execution and the fear of the tumbril |journal=New Scientist |date=Mar 10, 2018 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/letter/mg23731680-900-humane-execution-and-the-fear-of-the-tumbril-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Inert gas ===\nIt is one of the most commonly used compressed gases for pneumatic (pressurized gas) systems in portable pressure tools. Carbon dioxide is also used as an atmosphere for [[welding]], although in the welding arc, it reacts to [[oxidation|oxidize]] most metals. Use in the automotive industry is common despite significant evidence that welds made in carbon dioxide are more [[brittle]] than those made in more inert atmospheres. It is used as a welding gas primarily because it is much less expensive than more inert gases such as [[argon]] or [[helium]].{{citation needed|reason=why not use nitrogen?|date=July 2015}}  When used for [[MIG welding]], {{CO2}} use is sometimes referred to as MAG welding, for Metal Active Gas, as {{CO2}} can react at these high temperatures. It tends to produce a hotter puddle than truly inert atmospheres, improving the flow characteristics. Although, this may be due to atmospheric reactions occurring at the puddle site. This is usually the opposite of the desired effect when welding, as it tends to embrittle the site, but may not be a problem for general mild steel welding, where ultimate ductility is not a major concern.\n\nIt is used in many consumer products that require pressurized gas because it is inexpensive and nonflammable, and because it undergoes a phase transition from gas to liquid at room temperature at an attainable pressure of approximately 60 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (870 psi, 59 atm), allowing far more carbon dioxide to fit in a given container than otherwise would. Life jackets often contain canisters of pressured carbon dioxide for quick inflation. [[Aluminium]] capsules of {{CO2}} are also sold as supplies of compressed gas for [[air gun]]s, [[paintball]] markers/guns, inflating bicycle tires, and for making [[carbonated water]]. Rapid vaporization of liquid carbon dioxide is used for blasting in coal mines.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} High concentrations of carbon dioxide can also be used to kill pests. Liquid carbon dioxide is used in [[supercritical drying]] of some food products and technological materials, in the preparation of specimens for [[scanning electron microscopy]]{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} and in the [[decaffeination]] of [[coffee]] beans.\n\n=== Fire extinguisher ===\n[[File:US Army 53023 Fire Prevention Week.jpg|thumb|Use of a {{CO2}} fire extinguisher.]]\nCarbon dioxide can be used to extinguish flames by flooding the environment around the flame with the gas. It does not itself react to extinguish the flame, but starves the flame of oxygen by displacing it. Some [[Fire extinguisher#Clean agents and carbon dioxide|fire extinguishers]], especially those designed for electrical fires, contain liquid carbon dioxide under pressure. Carbon dioxide extinguishers work well on small flammable liquid and electrical fires, but not on ordinary combustible fires, because although it excludes oxygen, it does not cool the burning substances significantly and when the carbon dioxide disperses they are free to catch fire upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Their desirability in electrical fire stems from the fact that, unlike water or other chemical based methods, Carbon dioxide will not cause short circuits, leading to even more damage to equipment. Because it is a gas, it is also easy to dispense large amounts of the gas automatically in IT infrastructure rooms, where the fire itself might be hard to reach with more immediate methods because it is behind rack doors and inside of cases. Carbon dioxide has also been widely used as an extinguishing agent in fixed fire protection systems for local application of specific hazards and total flooding of a protected space.<ref>National Fire Protection Association Code 12</ref> [[International Maritime Organization]] standards also recognize carbon dioxide systems for fire protection of ship holds and engine rooms. Carbon dioxide based fire protection systems have been linked to several deaths, because it can cause suffocation in sufficiently high concentrations. A review of {{CO2}} systems identified 51 incidents between 1975 and the date of the report (2000), causing 72 deaths and 145 injuries.<ref>Carbon Dioxide as a Fire Suppressant: Examining the Risks, US EPA. 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> as solvent ===\n{{See also|Supercritical carbon dioxide}}\n\nLiquid carbon dioxide is a good [[solvent]] for many [[lipophilic]] [[organic compound]]s and is used to remove [[caffeine]] from [[coffee]].

This includes all plants, algae and animals and [[aerobic respiration|aerobic]] fungi and bacteria. In [[vertebrate]]s, the carbon dioxide travels in the blood from the body's tissues to the skin (e.g., [[amphibian]]s) or the gills (e.g., [[fish]]), from where it dissolves in the water, or to the lungs from where it is exhaled.

(The exact percentages vary depending whether it is arterial or venous blood).\n* Most of it (about 70% to 80%) is converted to [[bicarbonate]] ions {{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}} by the enzyme [[carbonic anhydrase]] in the red blood cells,<ref name=\"solarnav\">{{cite web |url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/solar_cola/carbon_dioxide.htm |title=Carbon dioxide |accessdate=2007-10-12 |publisher=solarnavigator.net}}</ref> by the reaction {{CO2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} \u2192 {{chem|H|2|CO|3}} \u2192 {{chem|H|+}} + {{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}}.\n* 5\u201310% is dissolved in the [[Blood plasma|plasma]]<ref name=\"solarnav\"/>\n* 5\u201310% is bound to [[hemoglobin]] as [[carbamino]] compounds<ref name=\"solarnav\"/>\n\n[[Hemoglobin]], the main oxygen-carrying molecule in [[red blood cell]]s, carries both oxygen and carbon dioxide. However, the {{CO2}} bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of [[allosteric regulation|allosteric]] effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of {{CO2}} decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen. This is known as the [[Haldane Effect]], and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. Conversely, a rise in the partial pressure of {{CO2}} or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin, which is known as the [[Bohr effect]].\n\n==== Regulation of respiration ====\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2014}}\nCarbon dioxide is one of the mediators of local [[autoregulation]] of blood supply. If its concentration is high, the [[capillaries]] expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue.\n\nBicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood pH. A person's breathing rate influences the level of {{CO2}} in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes [[respiratory acidosis]], while breathing that is too rapid leads to [[hyperventilation]], which can cause [[alkalosis|respiratory alkalosis]].\n\nAlthough the body requires oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing. Rather, breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels. As a result, breathing low-pressure air or a gas mixture with no oxygen at all (such as pure nitrogen) can lead to loss of consciousness without ever experiencing [[air hunger]]. This is especially perilous for high-altitude fighter pilots. It is also why flight attendants instruct passengers, in case of loss of cabin pressure, to apply the [[oxygen mask]] to themselves first before helping others; otherwise, one risks losing consciousness.<ref name=\"solarnav\"/>\n\nThe respiratory centers try to maintain an arterial {{CO2}} pressure of 40&nbsp;mm Hg. With intentional hyperventilation, the {{CO2}} content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10\u201320&nbsp;mm Hg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is why one can hold one's breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Chemistry}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Arterial blood gas]]\n* [[Bosch reaction]]\n* [[Bottled gas]]\n* [[Carbon dioxide sensor]]\n* [[Carbon sequestration]]\n* [[Cave of Dogs]]\n* [[EcoCute]] \u2013 as refrigerants\n* [[Emission standard]]s\n* [[Indoor air quality#Carbon dioxide|Indoor air quality]]\n* [[Kaya identity]]\n* [[Lake Kivu]]\n* [[List of least carbon efficient power stations]]\n* [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions]]\n* [[Meromictic lake]]\n* [[pCO2]]\n* [[Gilbert Plass]] (early work on {{CO2}} and climate change)\n* [[Sabatier reaction]]\n* NASA's [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2]] and [[Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |first=O.A. |last=Sepp\u00e4nen |last2=Fisk |first2=W.J. |last3=Mendell |first3=M.J. |title=Association of Ventilation Rates and {{CO2}} Concentrations with Health and Other Responses in Commercial and Institutional Buildings |journal=Indoor Air |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=226\u2013252 |date=December 1999 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.1999.00003.x |url=https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/43334.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227032839/https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/43334.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}\n* {{cite journal |last=Shendell |first=D.G. |last2=Prill |first2=R. |last3=Fisk |first3=W.J. |last4=Apte |first4=M.G. |last5=Blake |first5=D. |last6=Faulkner |first6=D. |title=Associations between classroom {{CO2}} concentrations and student attendance in Washington and Idaho |journal=Indoor Air |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=333\u2013341 |date=October 2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00251.x |url=https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/lbnl-54413.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227030811/https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/lbnl-54413.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}\n* {{cite journal |first=Jens |last=Soentgen |title= Hot air: The science and politics of {{CO2}} |journal=Global Environment |volume= 7 |issue=1 |pages= 134\u2013171 |date= February 2014 |doi= 10.3197/197337314X13927191904925 }}\n* {{cite book |title=Good plant design and operation for onshore carbon capture installations and onshore pipelines: a recommended practice guidance document |url=https://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pipelines-recommended-practice-guidance-document |publisher=Energy Institute and Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute |date=1 Sep 2010 |website=Global CCS Institute |quote=''This new title is an essential guide for engineers, managers, procurement specialists and designers working on global carbon capture and storage projects.''}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n{{Library resources box |lcheading=Carbon dioxide}}\n*{{ICSC|0021}}<!-- in general: {{ICSC|AllDigits|TwoDigits}} -->\n*[http://sdsdata.org/68399 Carbon dioxide MSDS] by Amerigas in the SDSdata.org database.\n*[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0103.html CDC \u2013 NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards \u2013 Carbon Dioxide]\n*[http://www.uigi.com/carbondioxide.html {{CO2}} Carbon Dioxide Properties, Uses, Applications]\n*[http://www.dryiceinfo.com/science.htm Dry Ice information]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070225181531/http://www.cmdl.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/ Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide] (NOAA)\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=RicDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53 \"A War Gas That Saves Lives\"].

The show was produced by Charles/Burrows/Charles Productions in association with [[Paramount Television|Paramount Network Television]]. The show was created by the team of [[James Burrows]], [[Glen and Les Charles|Glen Charles]], and [[Glen and Les Charles|Les Charles]]. The show is set in a bar named [[Cheers Beacon Hill|Cheers]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], where a group of locals meet to drink, relax, and socialize. The show's main theme song, co-written and performed by [[Gary Portnoy]], lent its refrain \"[[Where Everybody Knows Your Name]]\" as the show's [[catchphrase]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Gary|last= Portnoy|date=2006|url=http://www.garyportnoy.com/|title=Portnoy's personal site|work=garyportnoy.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter premiering on September 30, 1982, it was nearly canceled during its first season when it ranked almost last in ratings for its premiere (74th out of 77 shows). ''Cheers'', however, eventually became a [[Nielsen ratings|highly rated]] television show in the United States, earning a top-ten rating during eight of its eleven seasons, including one season at number one. The show spent most of its run on NBC's Thursday night \"[[Must See TV]]\" lineup. Its [[List of most watched television broadcasts|widely watched]] [[series finale]] was broadcast on May 20, 1993, and the show's 275 [[List of Cheers episodes|episodes]] have been successfully [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] worldwide. Nominated for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] for all eleven of its seasons on the air, it earned 28 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s from a record of 117 nominations. The character [[Frasier Crane]] ([[Kelsey Grammer]]) was featured in [[Frasier|his eponymous spin-off show]], which aired until 2004 and included guest appearances by virtually all of the major and minor ''Cheers'' characters. \n\nDuring its run, ''Cheers'' became one of the most popular series of all time and has received critical acclaim from its start to its end.

In season six (1987\u201388), they added a new character [[Rebecca Howe]], who was written into the show after the finale of the previous season (1986\u201387). [[Lilith Sternin]] starts as a one-time character in an episode of season four, \"Second Time Around\" (1985).

Before the series began, he was a baseball [[relief pitcher]] for the [[Boston Red Sox]] nicknamed \"Mayday Malone\" until he became an [[alcoholic]], harming his career. He has an [[on-again, off-again relationship]] with [[Sam and Diane|Diane Chambers]], his class opposite, in the first five seasons (1982\u20131987). During their off-times, Sam has flings with many not-so-bright \"sexy women\",<ref name=honey264/> yet fails to pursue a meaningful relationship<ref name=honey264/> and fails to seduce other women, such as intellectuals. After Diane is written out of the series, he tries to pursue Rebecca Howe, with varying results. At the end of the series, he is still unmarried and recovering from [[sexual addiction]] with the help of Dr. Robert Sutton's ([[Gilbert Lewis (actor)|Gilbert Lewis]]) group meetings, advised by Frasier.\n* [[Shelley Long]] portrays '''[[Diane Chambers]]''', an academic, sophisticated graduate student attending Boston University.<ref name=scott1982/> In the pilot, Diane is abandoned by her fianc\u00e9, leaving her without a job, a man, or money. Therefore, she reluctantly becomes a [[cocktail waitress]]. Later, she becomes a close friend of Coach<ref name=10anniversary/> and [[Sam and Diane|has an on-and-off relationship with bartender Sam Malone]], her class opposite. During their off-relationship times, Diane dates men who fit her upper-class ideals, such as Frasier Crane. In 1987, she leaves Boston behind for a writing career and to live in [[Los Angeles, California]].\n* [[Nicholas Colasanto]] portrays '''[[Coach Ernie Pantusso]]''', a \"borderline senile\"<ref name=honey264/> co-bartender, widower, and retired baseball coach. Coach is also a friend of Sam and a close friend of Diane. He has a daughter, Lisa. Coach is often tricked into situations, especially ones that put the bar at stake. Coach listens to people's problems and solves them. In 1985, Coach died without explicit explanation, as Colasanto died of a heart attack.<ref name=colasantodeath/>\n* [[Rhea Perlman]] portrays '''[[Carla Tortelli]]''', a \"wisecracking, cynical\"<ref name=scott1982/> cocktail waitress, who treats customers badly. She is also highly fertile and matrimonially inept. When the series premiered, she is the mother of four children by her ex-husband [[Nick Tortelli]] ([[Dan Hedaya]]).

After he died in an ice show accident by an [[ice resurfacer]], Carla later discovers that Eddie had committed [[bigamy]] with another woman, whom he had gotten pregnant.\n* [[George Wendt]] portrays '''[[Norm Peterson]]''', a bar regular and occasionally-employed [[accountant]]. A recurrent joke on the show, especially in the earlier seasons, was that the character was such a popular and constant fixture at the bar that anytime he entered through the front door everyone present would yell out his name (\"NORM!\") in greeting; usually this cry would be followed by one of the present bartenders asking Norm how he was, usually receiving a sardonic response and a request for a beer. He has infrequent accounting jobs and a troubled marriage with (but is still in love with and married to) Vera, an [[unseen character]]. Later in the series, he becomes a [[house painter]] and an [[interior decorator]]. The character was not originally intended to be a main cast role;<ref name=112wendt114/> Wendt auditioned for a minor role of George for the [[Give Me a Ring Sometime|pilot episode]]. The role was to only be Diane Chambers' first customer and had only one word: \"Beer!\"<ref>Wendt 2009, p. 112.</ref> After he was cast in a more permanent role, the character was renamed Norm.<ref>Wendt 2009, p. 113.</ref>\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] portrays '''[[Cliff Clavin]]''', a [[know-it-all]] bar regular and [[postal worker|mail carrier]]. He lives with his mother [[Esther Clavin]] ([[Frances Sternhagen]]) in first the family house and later an apartment. In the bar, Cliff continuously spouts nonsensical and annoying trivia, making him an object of derision to the bar patrons.

Frasier started out as Diane Chambers' love interest in the third season (1984\u201385). In the fourth season (1985\u201386), after Diane jilts him at the altar in Europe, Frasier ends up frequenting Cheers and becomes a regular. He later marries [[Lilith Sternin]] and has a son, Frederick. After the series ends the character becomes the focus of the spin-off ''[[Frasier]]'', in which he is divorced from Lilith and living in [[Seattle]].\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] portrays '''[[Woody Boyd]]''', a not-so-bright<ref name=honey264/> bartender. He arrives from his Midwest hometown of [[Hanover, Indiana]] to Boston, to see Coach, his \"[[pen pal]]\" (as referring to exchanging \"pens\", not letters). When Sam tells Woody that Coach died, Sam hires Woody in Coach's place. Later, he marries his girlfriend Kelly Gaines ([[Jackie Swanson]]), also not-so-bright but raised in a rich family. In the final season, he runs for political office, and surprisingly wins.\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] portrays '''[[Lilith Sternin]]''', a psychiatrist and bar regular. She is often teased by bar patrons about her uptight personality and appearance. In \"Second Time Around\" (1986), her first episode, also her only one of the fourth season, her date with Frasier does not go well because they constantly argue. In the fifth season, with help from Diane, Lilith and Frasier begin a relationship. Eventually, they marry and have a son, Frederick. In the eleventh and final season, she leaves Frasier to live with another man in an experimental underground environment called the \"Eco-pod.\" She returns later in the season and reconciles with Frasier. However, in the spinoff ''Frasier'', Lilith divorces Frasier and bears the custody of Frederick.\n* [[Kirstie Alley]] portrays '''[[Rebecca Howe]]'''. She starts out as a strong independent woman, managing the bar for the corporation that bought the bar from Sam after Diane jilted him. Eventually, when Sam regains ownership, she begs him to let her remain as business manager. She repeatedly has romantic failures with mainly rich men and becomes more and \"more neurotic, insecure, and sexually frustrated\".<ref name=neurotic>{{cite web|date=July 8, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkenlevine.blogspot.com%2F2011%2F07%2Fmy-favorite-kirstie-alley-scene.html&date=2012-07-21|author=Levine, Ken|url=http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2011/07/my-favorite-kirstie-alley-scene.html|authorlink=Ken Levine (TV personality)|archivedate=July 21, 2012|accessdate=July 21, 2012|work=... by Ken Levine on ''[[Blogspot]]''|title=My favorite Kirstie Alley scene}}</ref> At the start, Sam frequently attempts to seduce Rebecca without success.<ref name=craig>{{cite journal|volume=2 |author=Craig, Steve |format=PDF |page=15 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |year=1993 |title=Selling Masculinities, Selling Femininities: Multiple Genders and the Economics of Television |url=http://www.rtvf.unt.edu/html/craig/pdfs/gender.PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625104942/http://www.rtvf.unt.edu/html/craig/pdfs/gender.PDF |archivedate=June 25, 2007 |journal=The Mid-Atlantic Almanack |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> As her personality changes,<ref name=neurotic/> he loses interest in her.

Notable repeat guests included [[Dan Hedaya]] as [[Nick Tortelli]] and [[Jean Kasem]] as [[Loretta Tortelli]], who were the main characters in the first spin-off ''[[The Tortellis]]'', [[Fred Dryer]] as Dave Richards, [[Annie Golden]] as Margaret O'Keefe, [[Derek McGrath]] as Andy Schroeder (also referred to as ''Andy Andy''), interchangeably [[Joel Polis]] and [[Robert Desiderio]] as rival bar owner Gary, [[Jay Thomas]] as [[Eddie LeBec]], [[Roger Rees]] as [[Robin Colcord]], [[Tom Skerritt]] as [[Evan Drake]], [[Frances Sternhagen]] as Esther Clavin, [[Richard Doyle (actor)|Richard Doyle]] as Walter Gaines, [[Keene Curtis]] as John Allen Hill, [[Anthony Cistaro]] as Henri, Michael McGuire as Professor Sumner Sloan, and [[Harry Anderson]] as Harry 'The Hat' Gittes. [[Jackie Swanson]], who played the recurring role of Woody's girlfriend and eventual wife \"Kelly Gaines-Boyd\", appeared in 24 episodes from 1989 to 1993. The character is as equally dim and naive\u2014but ultimately as sweet-natured\u2014as Woody.\n\n[[Paul Willson]] played the recurring barfly character of \"Paul Krapence\". (In one early appearance in the first season he was called \"Glen\", and was later credited on-screen as \"Gregg\" and \"Tom\", but he was playing the same character throughout.) [[Thomas Babson]] played \"Tom\", a law student often mocked by [[Cliff Clavin]], for continually failing to pass the Massachusetts bar exam. \"Al\", played by [[Al Rosen (actor)|Al Rosen]], appeared in 38 episodes, and was known for his surly quips. Rhea Perlman's father Philip Perlman played the role of \"Phil\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Cheers, Dad! |publisher=People Magazine\n|date=September 16, 1991 |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20110852,00.html |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Celebrity appearances===\nOther celebrities guest-starred in single episodes as themselves throughout the series. Sports figures appeared on the show as themselves with a connection to Boston or Sam's former team, the Red Sox, such as [[Luis Tiant]], [[Wade Boggs]] and [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]] (of the [[Boston Celtics]]).<ref name=\"nba\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/mchale_bio.html |title=Kevin McHale Bio |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |publisher=NBA }}</ref> Some television stars also made guest appearances as themselves such as [[Alex Trebek]], [[Arsenio Hall]], [[Dick Cavett]], [[Robert Urich]], [[George \"Spanky\" McFarland]] and [[Johnny Carson]]. Various political figures even made appearances on ''Cheers'' such as then-[[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William J. Crowe]], former [[Colorado]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Gary Hart]], then-[[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill]], then-Senator [[John Kerry]], then-[[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Michael Dukakis]], [[Ethel Kennedy]] (widow of [[Robert F. Kennedy]]), and then-[[Mayor of Boston]] [[Raymond Flynn]], the last five of whom all represented Cheers' home state and city.\n\nIn maternal roles, [[Glynis Johns]], in a guest appearance in 1983, played Diane's mother, Helen Chambers. [[Nancy Marchand]] played Frasier's mother, Hester Crane, in an episode that aired in 1985. In an episode that aired in 1992, [[Celeste Holm]] played Kelly's jokester of a paternal grandmother. [[Melendy Britt]] appeared in the episode \"''Woody or Won't He''\" (1990) as Kelly's mother, Roxanne Gaines, a very attractive high-society lady and a sexy, flirtatious upper-class cougar who tries to seduce Woody.\n\nThe musician [[Harry Connick, Jr.]] appeared in an episode as Woody's cousin and plays a song from his Grammy-winning album ''[[We Are in Love]]'' (c. 1991). [[John Cleese]] won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for his guest appearance as \"Dr. Simon Finch-Royce\" in the fifth-season episode, \"Simon Says\". [[Emma Thompson]] guest starred as [[Nannette Guzman|Nanny G/Nannette Guzman]], a famous singing nanny and Frasier's ex-wife. [[Christopher Lloyd]] guest starred as a tortured artist who wanted to paint Diane. [[Marcia Cross]] portrayed Rebecca's sister Susan in the season 7 episode ''Sisterly Love''. [[John Mahoney]] once appeared as an inept jingle writer, which included a brief conversation with Frasier Crane, whose father he later portrayed on the spin-off ''Frasier''. [[Peri Gilpin]], who later played [[Roz Doyle]] on ''Frasier,'' also appeared in one episode of ''Cheers'', in its 11th season, as Holly Matheson, a reporter who interviews Woody. [[The Righteous Brothers]], [[Bobby Hatfield]] and [[Bill Medley]], also guest starred in different episodes. In \"The Guy Can't Help It\" Rebecca, meets a plumber played by [[Tom Berenger]] who came to fix one of the beer keg taps. They marry in the series finale, triggering her resignation from Cheers.\n\nNotable guest appearances of actresses portraying Sam's sexual conquests or potential sexual conquests include: [[Kate Mulgrew]] in the three-episode finale of season four, portraying Boston councilwoman Janet Eldridge; [[Donna McKechnie]] as Debra, Sam's ex-wife (with whom he is on good terms), who pretends to be an intellectual in front of Diane; [[Barbara Babcock]] as Lana Marshall, a talent agent who specializes in representing male athletes, her clients with whom she routinely sleeps on demand; [[Julia Duffy]] as Rebecca Prout, a depressed intellectual friend of Diane's; [[Alison La Placa]] as magazine reporter Paula Nelson; [[Carol Kane]] as Amanda, who Sam eventually learns was a fellow patient at the sanitarium with Diane; [[Barbara Feldon]] as Lauren Hudson, Sam's annual Valentine's Day fling (in an homage to ''[[Same Time, Next Year (play)|Same Time, Next Year]]''); [[Sandahl Bergman]] as Judy Marlowe, a longtime casual sex partner and whose now grown daughter, Laurie Marlowe ([[Chelsea Noble]]), who has always considered Sam a pseudo-father figure, Sam falls for; [[Madolyn Smith|Madolyn Smith-Osborne]] as Dr. Sheila Rydell, a colleague of Frasier and Lilith; [[Valerie Mahaffey]] as Valerie Hill, John Allen Hill's daughter who Sam pursues if only to gain an upper hand in his business relationship with Hill; and [[Alexis Smith]] as Alice Anne Volkman, Rebecca's much older ex-professor. In season 9, episode 17, ''I'm Getting My Act Together and Sticking It in Your Face'', Sam, believing Rebecca wants a more serious relationship, pretends to be gay, his lover being a casual friend named Leon ([[Jeff McCarthy]]) \u2013 the plan ultimately leads to a kiss between Sam and Leon. \n\n===Death of Nicholas Colasanto===\nNear the end of production of the third season, the writers of ''Cheers'' had to deal with the death of one of the main actors. During the third season, [[Nicholas Colasanto]]'s heart condition (which had been diagnosed in the mid-1970s) had worsened. He had lost weight and was having trouble breathing during filming. Shortly before third season filming wrapped, Colasanto was hospitalized due to fluid in his lungs. Though he recovered, he was not cleared to return to work. While visiting the set in January 1985 to watch the filming of several episodes, co-star [[Shelley Long]] commented, \"I think we were all in denial. We were all glad he was there, but he lost a lot of weight.\" Co-star [[Rhea Perlman]] added, \"[He] wanted to be there so badly. He didn't want to be sick. He couldn't breathe well. It was hard. He was laboring all the time.\" Colasanto ultimately died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in his home on February 12, 1985.<ref name=showmust/>\n\nThe third-season episodes of ''Cheers'' were filmed out of order, partly to accommodate the pregnancy of cast member Long. As a result, the season finale, which included several scenes with Colasanto, had already been filmed at the time of his death. In the third-season episodes that had not been filmed at this point, Coach is said to be \"away\" for various reasons.\n\nThe ''Cheers'' writing staff assembled in June 1985, at the start of the production of the fourth season, to discuss how to deal with the absence of Coach. They quickly discarded the idea that he might have moved away, as they felt he would never abandon his friends. In addition, as most viewers were aware of Colasanto's death, the writing staff decided to handle the situation more openly. The season four opener, \"Birth, Death, Love and Rice\", dealt with Coach's death as well as introduced [[Woody Harrelson]], Colasanto's replacement.<ref name=showmust>{{cite book|title=The Show Must Go On: How the Deaths of Lead Actors Have Affected Television Series|author=Snauffer, Douglas|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7864-3295-0|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movpod.in/gp3w6smdjos9 |title=Birth, Death, Love and Rice|publisher=Movpod.in |date= |accessdate=September 13, 2012}}{{dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Cheers episodes}}\n{{:List of Cheers episodes}}\n\n==Themes==\nNearly all of ''Cheers'' took place in the front room of the bar, but the characters often went into the rear pool room or the bar's office.<ref name=why>{{cite news|title= Why 'Cheers' Looks Sharp Each Week |work=Chicago Tribune|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-30/entertainment/8601230357_1_ted-danson-kiss-les-and-glen-charles|accessdate=October 30, 2010|date=March 30, 1986}}</ref> ''Cheers'' did not show any action outside the bar until the first episode of the second season, which took place in Diane's apartment.\n\nThe show's main [[Theme (narrative)|theme]] in its early seasons was the romance between intellectual waitress Diane Chambers and the bar's owner Sam Malone, a former [[Major League Baseball|major league]] [[Pitcher|baseball pitcher]] for the [[Boston Red Sox]] and a recovering [[alcoholic]].<ref>''Television Heaven'' (2002)(2006).

As ''Toasting Cheers'' puts it, \"The script was further strengthened by the writers' boldness in successfully tackling controversial issues such as [[alcoholism]], homosexuality, and adultery.\"<ref name=Bix>Bjorklund, p. ix</ref>\n\n[[Social class]] was a subtext of the show. The \"upper class\"&nbsp;\u2013 represented by characters like Diane Chambers, [[Frasier Crane]] and [[Lilith Sternin]]&nbsp;\u2013 rubbed shoulders with middle and working-class characters&nbsp;\u2014 Sam Malone, Carla Tortelli, Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin. An extreme example of this was the relationship between Woody Boyd and a millionaire's daughter, [[List of recurring Cheers characters#Kelly Gaines|Kelly Gaines]]. Many viewers enjoyed ''Cheers'' in part because of this focus on character development in addition to plot development.<ref name=\"chardevelop\"/>\n\n[[Feminism]] and the role of women were also recurring themes throughout the show, with some critics seeing each of the major female characters portraying an aspect as a flawed feminist in her own way.<ref name=fem>Dr. Caren Deming. \"Talk: Gender Discourse in ''Cheers''!\", in ''Television Criticism: Approaches and Applications'' edited by Leah R.

Jenkins, who teaches at San Francisco State University.</ref> Diane was a vocal feminist, and Sam was the epitome of everything she hated: a [[Promiscuity|womanizer]] and a [[Chauvinism|male chauvinist]]. (See \"[[Sam and Diane]]\".)\n\n[[Homosexuality]] was dealt with from the first season, which was rare in the early [[1980s in television|1980s on American television]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Becker|first=Ron|title=Gay TV And Straight America|year=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick (N.J.)|isbn=0-8135-3689-8|page=5}}</ref> In the first-season episode \"[[The Boys in the Bar]]\" (the title being a reference to the [[The Boys in the Band (play)|play]] and subsequent movie ''[[The Boys in the Band]]''), a friend and former teammate of Sam's [[Coming out|comes out]] in his autobiography. Some of the male regulars pressure Sam to take action to ensure that Cheers does not become a [[gay bar]]. The episode won a [[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation|GLAAD]] [[GLAAD Media Awards|Media Award]], and the script's writers, [[Ken Levine (TV personality)|Ken Levine]] and David Isaacs, were nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]].\n\n[[Substance use disorder|Addiction]] also plays a role in ''Cheers'', almost exclusively through Sam. He is a recovering [[alcoholic]] who had bought a bar during his drinking days. Frasier has a notable bout of drinking in the fourth-season episode \"The Triangle\", while Woody develops a [[problem gambling|gambling]] problem in the seventh season's \"Call Me Irresponsible\".\n\n==Cheers owners==\n[[File:Boston5808.JPG|thumb|The Cheers sign in 2005.]]\nCheers had several owners before Sam, as the bar was opened in 1889. The \"Est. 1895\" on the bar's sign is a made-up date chosen by Carla for [[numerology|numerological]] purposes, revealed in season 8, episode 6, \"The Stork Brings a Crane\", which also revealed the bar's address as\n112 1/2 Beacon Street and that it originated under the name Mom's. In the series' second episode, \"Sam's Women\", Coach tells a customer looking for Gus, the owner of Cheers, that Gus was dead. In a later episode, Gus O'Mally comes back from Arizona for one night and helps run the bar.\n\nThe biggest storyline surrounding the ownership of Cheers begins in the fifth-season finale, \"[[I Do, Adieu]]\", when Sam and Diane part ways, due to Shelley Long's departure from the series. In addition, Sam leaves on a trip to [[Circumnavigation|sail around the world]]. Before he leaves, Sam sells Cheers to the Lillian Corporation. He returns in the sixth-season premiere, \"Home is the Sailor\", having sunk his boat, to find the bar under the new management of Rebecca Howe. He begs for his job back and is hired by Rebecca as a bartender. In the seventh-season premiere, \"How to Recede in Business\", Rebecca is fired and Sam is promoted to manager. Rebecca is allowed to keep a job at Lillian vaguely similar to what she had before, but only after Sam had Rebecca ([[wikt:in absentia|in absentia]]) \"agree\" to a long list of demands that the corporation had for her.\n\nFrom there Sam occasionally attempted to buy the bar back with schemes that usually involved the wealthy executive [[Robin Colcord]]. Sam acquired Cheers again in the eighth-season finale, when it was sold back to him for 85\u00a2 by the Lillian Corporation, after he alerted the company to Colcord's [[insider trading]]. Fired by the corporation because of her silence on the issue, Rebecca is hired by Sam as a hostess/office manager. For the rest of the episode, to celebrate Sam's reclaiming the bar, a huge banner hung from the staircase, reading \"Under OLD Management\"!\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Cheers Street Boston 2005.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Cheers Beacon Hill]], formerly the Bull & Finch Pub, in Boston in 2005.]]\n\n===Creation and concept===\nThree men developed and created the ''Cheers'' television series: The [[Glen and Les Charles|Charles brothers]]\u2014Glen and Les\u2014and [[James Burrows]],<ref name=Kerr_11_29_1983/> who identified themselves as \"two Mormons and a Jew.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/cheers-co-creator-looks-back-series-finale-ted-dansons-decision-quit-caught-us-surprise-120020648.html|title='Cheers' co-creator looks back at series finale: 'Ted Danson's decision to quit caught us by surprise'|publisher=}}</ref> They aimed at \"creating a show around a [[Spencer Tracy]]-[[Katharine Hepburn]]-type relationship\" between their two main characters, [[Sam and Diane|Sam Malone and Diane Chambers]].<ref name=Kerr_11_29_1983/> Malone represents the average man, while Chambers represents class and sophistication.<ref name=Kerr_11_29_1983/> The show revolves around characters in a bar under \"humorous adult themes\" and \"situations.\"<ref name=Kerr_11_29_1983/>\n\nThe original idea was a group of workers who interacted like a family, the goal being a concept similar to ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''. The creators considered making an American version of the British ''[[Fawlty Towers]],'' set in a hotel or an inn. When the creators settled on a bar as their setting, the show began to resemble the [[Radio programming|radio show]] ''[[Duffy's Tavern]],'' a program originally written and co-created by James Burrows' father [[Abe Burrows]]. They liked the idea of a [[tavern]], as it provided a continuous stream of new people, for a variety of characters.<ref name=B3>Bjorklund, p. 3.</ref>\n\nEarly discussions about the location of the show centered on [[Barstow, California]], then [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. They eventually turned to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and finally Boston. The [[Bull & Finch Pub]] in Boston, which was the model for Cheers, was chosen from a [[Telephone directory|phone book]].<ref name=B4>Bjorklund, p. 4.</ref> When Glen Charles asked the bar's owner, Tom Kershaw, to shoot exterior and interior photos, he agreed, charging $1. Kershaw has since gone on to make millions of dollars, licensing the pub's image and selling a variety of ''Cheers'' memorabilia. The Bull & Finch became the 42nd busiest outlet in the American food and beverage industry in 1997.<ref name=B3/> During initial casting, Shelley Long, who was in Boston at the time filming ''[[A Small Circle of Friends]]'', remarked that the bar in the script resembled a bar she had come upon in the city, which turned out to be the Bull & Finch.<ref name=B7>Bjorklund, p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Production team===\nThe crew of ''Cheers'' numbered in the hundreds. The three creators\u2014[[James Burrows]] and [[Glen and Les Charles|the Charles brothers, Glen and Les]]\u2014kept offices on Paramount's lot for the duration of the ''Cheers'' run. The Charles Brothers remained in overall charge throughout the show's run, frequently writing major episodes, though starting with the third season they began delegating the day-to-day running of the writing staff to various [[showrunner]]s. [[Ken Estin]] and [[Sam Simon]] were appointed as showrunners for the third season, and succeeded by [[David Angell]], [[Peter Casey (screenwriter)|Peter Casey]] and [[David Lee (screenwriter)|David Lee]] the following year. Angell, Casey and Lee would remain as showrunners until the end of the seventh season when they left to develop their own sitcom, ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'', and were replaced by Cheri Eichen, Bill Steinkellner and [[Phoef Sutton]] for the eighth through tenth seasons. For the final season, Tom Anderson and [[Dan O'Shannon]] acted as the showrunners.\n\nJames Burrows is regarded as being a factor in the show's longevity, directing 243 of the 270 episodes and supervising the show's production.<ref name=B2>Bjorklund, p. 2.</ref> Among the show's other directors were [[Andy Ackerman]], Thomas Lofaro, Tim Berry, [[Tom Moore (director)|Tom Moore]], Rick Beren, as well as cast members John Ratzenberger and George Wendt.<ref name=\"chardevelop\">The Museum of Broadcast Communications (2006).</ref>\n\n[[Craig Safan]] provided the series' original music for its entire run except the theme song. His extensive compositions for the show led to him winning numerous [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] Top TV Series awards for his music.\n\n===Casting===\nThe character of [[Sam Malone]] was originally intended to be a retired football player and was slated to be played by [[Fred Dryer]], but, after casting Ted Danson, it was decided that a former baseball player (Sam \"Mayday\" Malone) would be more believable.<ref name=audition>Meade, Peter. \"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=SFOYbPikdlgC&dat=19840427&printsec=frontpage We'll Cry In Our Beers As Sam, Diane Split].\" ''[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]] TV Update'' [Spartanburg, NC] April 29, 1984: 14.

When the series became a hit, the characters started venturing further afield, first to other sets and eventually to an occasional exterior location. The exterior location shots of the bar were of the [[Bull & Finch Pub]], located directly north of the [[Public Garden (Boston)|Boston Public Garden]]. The pub has become a [[tourist attraction]] because of its association with the series, and draws nearly one million visitors annually.<ref name=B3/><ref name=\"synd1\"/> It has since been renamed Cheers Beacon Hill; its interior is different from the TV bar. The Pub itself is at 84 Beacon Street (on the corner of Brimmer St). In August 2001, there was a replica made of the bar in [[Faneuil Hall]] to capitalize on the popularity of the show.\n\n===Theme song===\nBefore \"[[Where Everybody Knows Your Name]]\", written by [[Gary Portnoy]] and [[Judy Hart Angelo]], became the show's theme song, ''Cheers''{{'}} producers rejected two of Portnoy's and Hart Angelo's songs. The songwriters had collaborated to provide music for ''Preppies'', an unsuccessful Broadway musical. When told they could not appropriate \"People Like Us\", ''Preppies''{{'}} opening song, the pair wrote another song \"My Kind of People\", which resembled \"People Like Us\" and intended to satirize \"the lifestyle of old decadent old-money [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASPs]],\" but, to meet producers' demands, they rewrote the lyrics to be about \"likeable losers\" in a Boston bar. The show's producers rejected this song, as well. After they read the script of the series pilot, they created another song \"Another Day\". When Portnoy and Hart Angelo heard that NBC had commissioned thirteen episodes, they created an official theme song \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\" and rewrote the lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|archivedate=January 18, 2013|url=http://www.garyportnoy.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118024640/http://www.garyportnoy.com/ |work=GaryPortnoy.com|deadurl=no|title=The Story Behind the Cheers Theme}} Click \"The Cheers Story\".</ref> On syndicated airings of ''Cheers'', the theme song was shortened to make room for commercials.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Cheers'' was critically acclaimed in its first season, though it landed a disappointing 74th out of 77 shows in that year's ratings.<ref name=groove3>{{cite web|last=Anscher|first=Matthew|title=Part III: Brandon at the Bat|url=http://www.tvparty.com/80nbc3.html|work=How NBC Got Its Groove Back|publisher=tvparty.com|accessdate=July 6, 2012}}</ref> This critical support, the early success at the [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, and the support of the president of NBC's entertainment division [[Brandon Tartikoff]], are thought to be the main reasons for the show's survival and eventual success.<ref>Variety (May 20, 2003) (2006).

By the second season ''Cheers'' was competitive with CBS' top rated show ''[[Simon & Simon]]''.<ref name=Kerr_11_29_1983/> With the growing popularity of ''[[Family Ties]]'', which ran in the slot ahead of ''Cheers'' from January 1984 until ''Family Ties'' was moved to Sundays in 1987, and the placement of ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' in front of both at the start of their third season (1984), the line-up became a runaway ratings success that NBC eventually dubbed \"[[Must See TV|Must See Thursday]]\". The next season, ''Cheers'' ratings increased dramatically after Woody Boyd became a regular character as well. By the end of its final season, the show had a run of eight consecutive seasons in the Top Ten of the [[Nielsen ratings]]; seven of them were in the Top Five.<ref name=B16>Bjorklund, p. 16.</ref>\n\n''Cheers'' was perhaps the first sitcom with a [[Serial (radio and television)|serialized storyline]],<ref name=\"levine20121109\">{{cite web | url=http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2012/11/more-stuff-you-wanted-to-know.html | title=More stuff you wanted to know | work=...by Ken Levine | date=November 9, 2012 | accessdate=November 10, 2012 | author=Levine, Ken}}</ref> starting with the third season. The show's success helped make such multi-episode story arcs popular on television, which Les Charles regrets.\n<blockquote>[W]e may have been partly responsible for what's going on now, where if you miss the first episode or two, you are lost. You have to wait until you can get the whole thing on DVD and catch up with it. If that blood is on our hands, I feel kind of badly about it. It can be very frustrating.\"{{r|gqraftery201210}}</blockquote>\n\n''Cheers'' began with a limited five-character ensemble consisting of Ted Danson, Shelley Long, Rhea Perlman, Nicholas Colasanto and George Wendt. By the time season 10 began, the show had eight front characters in its roster. ''Cheers'' was also able to gradually phase in characters such as Cliff, Frasier, Lilith, Rebecca, and Woody. During season 1, only one set, the bar, housed all of the episodes. Later seasons introduced other sets, but the show's ability to center the action in the bar and avoid straying was notable.\n\nNBC dedicated a whole night to the [[One for the Road (Cheers)|final episode of ''Cheers'']], following the [[The Pilot (Seinfeld)|one-hour season finale]] of ''[[Seinfeld]]'' (which was its lead-in). The show began with a \"pregame\" show hosted by [[Bob Costas]], followed by the final 98-minute episode itself. NBC affiliates then aired tributes to ''Cheers'' during their local newscasts, and the night concluded with a special ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|Tonight Show]]'' broadcast live from the Bull & Finch Pub. Although the episode fell short of its hyped ratings predictions to become the [[List of most watched television broadcasts|most watched television episode]], it was the most watched show that year, bringing in 93.5 million viewers (64 percent of all viewers that night), and ranked 11th all time in entertainment programming. The 1993 final broadcast of ''Cheers'' also emerged as the highest rated broadcast of [[NBC]] to date, as well as the most watched single episode from any television series throughout the decade 1990s on U.S. television.<ref name=NYT>\"A Repeat of 'Cheers' Finale.\" ''[[The New York Times]]'' May 22, 1993.

The most successful ''Cheers'' spin-off was ''[[Frasier]]'', which featured Frasier Crane following his relocation back to [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Sam, Diane, and Woody all individually appeared in ''Frasier'' episodes, with Lilith appearing as a guest on multiple episodes. In the [[Frasier (season 9)|season nine]] episode \"Cheerful Goodbyes\", Frasier returns to Boston and meets up with the Cheers gang, later attending Cliff's retirement party.\n\nAlthough ''[[Frasier]]'' was more successful, ''[[The Tortellis]]'' was the first series to spin-off from ''Cheers'', premiering in 1987. The show featured Carla's ex-husband [[Nick Tortelli]] and his wife [[Loretta Tortelli|Loretta]], but was canceled after 13 episodes and drew protests for its stereotypical depictions of Italian-Americans.\n\nIn addition to direct spin-offs, several ''Cheers'' characters had guest appearance crossovers with other shows, including ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'' and ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' (episode \"[[St. Elsewhere#.22Cheers.22|Cheers]]\"). ''Cheers'' has also been spoofed or referenced in other media, including ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (spoofing the title sequence and theme song in \"[[Flaming Moe's]]\"; actually visiting the place with vocal role reprises of the majority of the principal cast in  \"[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]\"), ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' (episode \"My Life in Four Cameras\"), ''[[Adventure Time]]'' (episode \"[[Simon & Marcy]]\"), the 2012 comedy film ''[[Ted (film)|Ted]]'', and the 2011 video game ''[[Dragon Age II]]''.\n\nIn the season 4 episode of ''[[Seinfeld]]'' entitled \"[[The Pitch (Seinfeld)|The Pitch]]\", Jerry and George are presenting their idea for a sitcom to NBC executives. George is unhappy with their offer and feels that he deserves the same salary as Ted Danson which he claims was $800,000 per episode, being that ''Cheers'' is also an NBC show. Danson's reported salary was actually $250,000 per episode. At this point Cheers was in it's 10th season and Ted Danson had won an Emmy and a Golden Globe the year before.\n\nIn the 2015 video game ''[[Fallout 4]]'', set in Boston, there is a bar named 'Prost Bar' near Boston Common which, when entered, is an almost exact replica of the bar used in the series. It even includes 2 dead bodies sat at the end of the bar, with one of them wearing a Mail Carrier's uniform, a direct reference to regular barfly [[Cliff Clavin]].<ref>http://kotaku.com/theres-a-pretty-great-cheers-easter-egg-in-fallout-4-1741952100\n</ref>\n\nThe eighth anniversary special of ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', airing in 1990, began with a scene at Cheers, in which the bar's TV gets stuck on NBC, and all of the bar patrons decide to go home instead of staying to watch Letterman. The scene was re-used to open Letterman's final episode in 1993. A similar scene aired in the [[Super Bowl XVII]] Pregame Show on NBC, in which the characters briefly discuss the upcoming game.\n\nIn the second-season episode \"[[Swarley]]\" of the sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', in the final scene, [[Barney Stinson|Barney]] walks into the bar and everyone shouts \"Swarley,\" same as when the characters traditionally yelled \"Norm!\" whenever [[Norm Peterson]] entered the Cheers bar, and he turns and walks out dejectedly as Carl the bartender plays \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name.\" The camera angle also changes to show the same bar set-up and framing for the main interior bar shots featured in ''Cheers''. Additionally, the end credits are done in the gold \"Cooper Black\" font of the ''Cheers'' credits (which was a highly popular font for sitcoms of the early-to-mid-1980s).\n\nThe [[List of recurring Star Trek: Deep Space Nine characters#Morn|''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' character Morn]] is named for [[Norm Peterson]] due to [[Armin Shimerman]] calling the originally nameless character \"Norm\" between takes.\n\nThe theatrical play ''Cheers: Live On Stage'' reenacts a condensed version of the first two seasons of the show.<ref name=liveonstage>[http://cheersliveonstage.com/ ''Cheers Live On Stage''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918161014/http://cheersliveonstage.com/ |date=September 18, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nOne episode of ''Cheers'' has a crossover reference to ''[[Spenser: For Hire]]'' (a Cheers bartender has a cameo appearance as an unspeaking extra).\n\nIn ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'', [[Peter Quill]] makes numerous references to the show ''Cheers.''\n\nIn the [[The Good Place (season 2)|season 2 finale]] of the NBC sitcom ''[[The Good Place]]'', Ted Danson's character Michael appears as a bartender while wearing a blue plaid button-down, in a clear homage to Danson's character in ''Cheers''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/02/the-good-place-season-2-finale-ted-danson-cheers.html|title=The Good Place Finally Gave Ted Danson His Cheers Moment|last=Ivie|first=Devon|work=Vulture|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn [[A Night at the Roxbury]], Dan Hedya's character Kamehl Butabi and his friends are listening to Emily ([[Molly Shannon]]) play the piano. She was playing the song \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\" which is clearly a reference to Hedya's past as [[Nick Tortelli]] on ''Cheers''.\n\n==Remake==\nIn September 2011, Plural Entertainment debuted a remake of the series on [[Spain|Spanish]] television, also titled [[Cheers (Spain)|''Cheers'']]. Set at an Irish pub, it starred [[Alberto San Juan]] as Nicol\u00e1s \"Nico\" Arnedo, the equivalent of Sam Malone in the original series. It also used the original theme song, rerecorded in Spanish by [[Dani Mart\u00edn (singer)|Dani Mart\u00edn]], under the title of \"[[Where Everybody Knows Your Name|D\u00f3nde la gente se divierte]].\"\n\nIn December 2012, The Irish Film and Television Network announced that casting is underway on an Irish language version of ''Cheers'' produced by production company Sideline. The new show, tentatively titled ''Teach Se\u00e1n'', would air on Ireland's TG4 and features a main character who, like Sam Malone, is a bar owner, a retired athlete and a recovering alcoholic. Except because of the setting in Ireland, the barman is a \"former [[hurling]] star\" rather than an ex-baseball player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2012/12/19/irish-cheers/|title=Irish TV channel to remake 'Cheers' &#124; PopWatch &#124; EW.com<!-- Bot generated title -->|work=popwatch.ew.com}}</ref>\n\n==''Cheers: Live On Stage''==\nOn September 9, 2016, a stage adaptation called, ''Cheers: Live On Stage'', opened at the Schubert Theatre in Boston.

In particular, his model gives a structural (and not psychological) foundation of forbidden parallels of fifths and the dissonant fourth. The model has also been extended to microtonal contexts by Octavio Agustin.\n\n==Development==\nSome examples of related compositional techniques include: the [[round (music)|round]] (familiar in folk traditions), the [[Canon (music)|canon]], and perhaps the most complex contrapuntal convention: the [[fugue]]. All of these are examples of [[Imitation (music)|imitative counterpoint]].\n\n== Species counterpoint ==\n{{Example needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nSpecies counterpoint was developed as a pedagogical tool in which students progress through several \"species\" of increasing complexity, with a very simple part that remains constant known as the [[cantus firmus]] (Latin for \"fixed melody\"). Species counterpoint generally offers less freedom to the composer than other types of counterpoint and therefore is called a \"strict\" counterpoint. The student gradually attains the ability to write ''free'' counterpoint (that is, less rigorously constrained counterpoint, usually without a cantus firmus) according to the given rules at the time.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jeppesen |first=Knud |authorlink=Knud Jeppesen |others=trans. by [[Glen Haydon]], with a new foreword by Alfred Mann |title=Counterpoint: the polyphonic vocal style of the sixteenth century |origyear=1939 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OcSVGkug58gC |year=1992 |publisher=Dover |location=New York |isbn=0-486-27036-X }}</ref>  The idea is at least as old as 1532, when Giovanni Maria Lanfranco described a similar concept in his ''Scintille di musica'' (Brescia, 1533).  The 16th-century [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian]] theorist [[Gioseffe Zarlino|Zarlino]] elaborated on the idea in his influential ''Le institutioni harmoniche'', and it was first presented in a codified form in 1619 by [[Lodovico Zacconi]] in his ''Prattica di musica''.  Zacconi, unlike later theorists, included a few extra contrapuntal techniques, such as [[Inversion (music)#Counterpoint|invertible counterpoint]].\n\nIn 1725 [[Johann Joseph Fux]] published ''[[Gradus ad Parnassum]]'' (Steps to Parnassus), in which he described five species:\n\n#Note against note;\n#Two notes against one;\n#Four notes against one;\n#Notes offset against each other (as [[Nonchord tone|suspensions]]);\n#All the first four species together, as \"florid\" counterpoint.\n\nA succession of later theorists quite closely imitated Fux's seminal work, often with some small and idiosyncratic modifications in the rules. Many of Fux's rules concerning the purely linear construction of melodies have their origin in solfeggi. Concerning the common practice era, alterations to the melodic rules were introduced to enable the function of certain harmonic forms. The combination of these melodies produced the basic harmonic structure; the figured bass.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Considerations for all species===\nThe following rules apply to melodic writing in each species, for each part:\n\n#The [[Mode (music)#Western Church|final]] must be approached by [[Steps and skips|step]]. If the final is approached from below, then the [[leading tone]] must be raised in a minor key (Dorian, Hypodorian, Aeolian, Hypoaeolian), but not in Phrygian or Hypophrygian mode. Thus, in the Dorian mode on D, a C{{music|sharp}} is necessary at the [[cadence (music)|cadence]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Felix Salzer and Carl Schachter|title=Counterpoint in Composition:The Study of Voice Leading|location=New York|publisher=Stanley Persky, City University of New York|isbn=023107039X|page={{Page needed|date=October 2015}}}}</ref> \n#Permitted melodic intervals are the perfect fourth, fifth, and octave, as well as the major and minor second, major and minor third, and ascending minor sixth. The ascending minor sixth must be immediately followed by motion downwards.\n#If writing two [[Steps and skips|skips]] in the same direction\u2014something that must be only rarely done\u2014the second must be smaller than the first, and the interval between the first and the third note may not be dissonant. The three notes should be from the same triad; if this is impossible, they should not outline more than one octave. In general, do not write more than two skips in the same direction.\n#If writing a skip in one direction, it is best to proceed after the skip with motion in the other direction.\n#The interval of a [[tritone]] in three notes should be avoided (for example, an ascending melodic motion F\u2013A\u2013B{{music|natural}}) {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} as is the interval of a seventh in three notes.\n#There must be a climax or high point in the line countering the [[cantus firmus]]. This usually occurs somewhere in the middle of exercise and must occur on a strong beat.\n#An outlining of a seventh is avoided within a single line moving in the same direction.\n\nAnd, in all species, the following rules govern the combination of the parts:\n\n#The counterpoint must begin and end on a perfect [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]].\n#[[Contrary motion]] should predominate.\n#Perfect consonances must be approached by oblique or contrary motion.\n#Imperfect consonances may be approached by any type of motion.\n#The interval of a tenth should not be exceeded between two adjacent parts unless by necessity.\n#Build from the bass, upward.\n\n=== First species ===\nIn ''first species'' counterpoint, each note in every added part (parts being also referred to as ''lines'' or ''voices'') sounds against one note in the cantus firmus.  Notes in all parts are sounded simultaneously, and move against each other simultaneously. Since all notes in First species counterpoint are whole notes, rhythmic independence is not available.<ref>\n{{cite web | url=https://finearts.uvic.ca/music/current/theory_materials/Counterpoint%20online.pdf | title=Species Counterpoint | publisher=Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Victoria, Canada | date= | accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the present context, a \"step\" is a melodic interval of a half or whole step.  A \"skip\" is an interval of a third or fourth.  (See [[Steps and skips]].) An interval of a fifth or larger is referred to as a \"leap\".\n\nA few further rules given by Fux, by study of the Palestrina style, and usually given in the works of later counterpoint pedagogues,{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}<!--Who says that most later counterpoint teachers give these rules?--> are as follows.\n\n#Begin and end on either the unison, octave, or fifth, unless the added part is underneath, in which case begin and end only on unison or octave.\n#Use no unisons except at the beginning or end.\n#Avoid [[Consecutive fifths|parallel fifths or octaves]] between any two parts; and avoid [[Consecutive fifths#Hidden consecutives|\"hidden\" parallel fifths or octaves]]: that is, movement by [[Contrary motion|similar motion]] to a perfect fifth or octave, unless one part (sometimes restricted to the ''higher'' of the parts) moves by step.\n#Avoid moving in parallel fourths. (In practice Palestrina and others frequently allowed themselves such progressions, especially if they do not involve the lowest of the parts.)\n#Avoid moving in parallel thirds or sixths for very long.\n#Attempt to keep any two adjacent parts within a tenth of each other, unless an exceptionally pleasing line can be written by moving outside that range.\n#Avoid having any two parts move in the same direction by skip\n#Attempt to have as much contrary motion as possible.\n#Avoid dissonant intervals between any two parts: major or minor second, major or minor seventh, any augmented or diminished interval, and perfect fourth (in many contexts).\n\nIn the following example in two parts, the cantus firmus is the lower part. (The same cantus firmus is used for later examples also. Each is in the [[Dorian mode]].)\n[[Image:species1.png|center|400px|thumb|Short example of \"First Species\" counterpoint ({{Audio|Species1.mid|play MIDI}})]]\n\n===Second species===\nIn ''second species'' counterpoint, two notes in each of the added parts work against each longer note in the given part.\n\nAdditional considerations in second species counterpoint are as follows, and are in addition to the considerations for first species:\n#It is permissible to begin on an upbeat, leaving a half-rest in the added voice.\n#The accented beat must have only consonance (perfect or imperfect).  The unaccented beat may have dissonance, but only as a passing tone, i.e. it must be approached and left by step in the same direction.\n#Avoid the interval of the unison except at the beginning or end of the example, except that it may occur on the unaccented portion of the bar.\n#Use caution with successive accented perfect fifths or octaves.  They must not be used as part of a sequential pattern.\n[[Image:species2.png|center|400px|thumb|Short example of \"Second Species\" counterpoint ({{Audio|Species2.mid|play MIDI}})]]\n\n===Third species===\nIn ''third species'' counterpoint, four (or three, etc.) notes move against each longer note in the given part.\n[[Image:Counterpoint species 3.svg|center|400px|thumb|Short example of \"Third Species\" counterpoint ({{Audio|Species3.mid|play MIDI}})]]\n\nThree special figures are introduced into third species and later added to fifth species, and ultimately outside the restrictions of ''species writing.'' There are three figures to consider: The ''nota [[cambiata]],'' ''double neighbor tones,'' and ''double passing tones.'' \nDouble neighbor tones: the figure is prolonged over four beats and allows special dissonances. The upper and lower tones are prepared on beat 1 and resolved on beat 4. The fifth note or downbeat of the next measure should move by step in the same direction as the last two notes of the double neighbor figure. Lastly a double passing tone allows two dissonant passing tones in a row. The figure would consist of 4 notes moving in the same direction by step. The two notes that allow dissonance would be beat 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. The dissonant interval of a fourth would proceed into a diminished fifth and the next note would resolve at the interval of a sixth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Felix Salzer and Carl Schachter|title=Counterpoint in Composition:The Study of Voice Leading|location=New York|publisher=Stanley Persky, City University of New York|isbn=023107039X|page={{Page needed|date=October 2015}}}}</ref>\n[[File:Ascending Double Passing Tone.jpg|thumb|This is an example of a double passing tone in which the two middle notes are a dissonant interval from the cantus firmus. A fourth and a diminished fifth.]]\n[[File:Descending Double Neighbor Figure.jpg|thumb|This is an example of a descending double neighbor figure against a cantus firmus.]]\n[[File:Ascending Double Neighbor Figure.jpg|thumb|This is an example of an ascending double neighbor figure (with an interesting tritone leap at the end) against a cantus firmus.]]\n\n===Fourth species===\nIn ''fourth species'' counterpoint, some notes are sustained or ''suspended'' in an added part while notes move against them in the given part, often creating a [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] on the beat, followed by the suspended note then changing (and \"catching up\") to create a subsequent [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]] with the note in the given part as it continues to sound. As before, fourth species counterpoint is called ''expanded'' when the added-part notes vary in length among themselves. The technique requires chains of notes sustained across the boundaries determined by beat, and so creates [[syncopation]]. Also it is important to note that a dissonant interval is allowed on beat 1 because of the syncopation created by the suspension.\n[[Image:Counterpoint species 4.svg|center|400px|thumb|Short example of \"Fourth Species\" counterpoint ({{Audio|Species4.mid|play MIDI}})]]\n\n===Fifth species (florid counterpoint)===\nIn ''fifth species'' counterpoint, sometimes called ''florid counterpoint'', the other four species of counterpoint are combined within the added parts. In the example, the first and second bars are second species, the third bar is third species, the fourth and fifth bars are third and embellished fourth species, and the final bar is first species.\n[[Image:Counterpoint species 5.svg|center|400px|thumb|Short example of \"Florid\" counterpoint ({{Audio|Species5.mid|play MIDI}})]]\n\n==Contrapuntal derivations==\nSince the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period in European music, much contrapuntal music has been written in imitative counterpoint.  In imitative counterpoint, two or more voices enter at different times, and (especially when entering) each voice repeats some version of the same melodic element.  The [[fantasia (music)|fantasia]], the [[ricercar]], and later, the [[Canon (music)|canon]] and [[fugue]] (the contrapuntal form ''par excellence'') all feature imitative counterpoint, which also frequently appears in [[choir|choral]] works such as [[motet]]s and [[madrigal (music)|madrigals]].  Imitative counterpoint spawned a number of devices, including:\n\n;[[Inversion (music)#Inverted melodies|Melodic inversion]]: The inverse of a given fragment of melody is the fragment turned upside down\u2014so if the original fragment has a rising major third (see [[interval (music)|interval]]), the inverted fragment has a falling major (or perhaps minor) third, etc. (Compare, in [[twelve tone technique]], the inversion of the tone row, which is the so-called prime series turned upside down.)

The precious metals are complexed by the cyanide [[anion]]s to form soluble derivatives, e.g., [Au(CN)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup> and [Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup>.<ref name=Ullmann>{{cite book |first1=Andreas |last1=Rubo |first2=Raf |last2=Kellens |first3=Jay |last3=Reddy |first4=Norbert |last4=Steier |first5=Wolfgang |last5=Hasenpusch |chapter=Alkali metal cyanides |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year=2006 |doi=10.1002/14356007.i01_i01}}</ref>\n::4 Au + 8 NaCN + O<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 4 Na[Au(CN)<sub>2</sub>] + 4 NaOH\n\nSilver is less [[Noble metal|\"noble\"]] than gold and often occurs as the sulfide, in which case redox is not invoked (no O<sub>2</sub> is required). Instead, a displacement reaction occurs:\n::Ag<sub>2</sub>S + 4 NaCN + H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 2 Na[Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub>] + NaSH + NaOH\nThe \"pregnant liquor\" containing these ions is separated from the solids, which are discarded to a [[tailing pond]] or spent heap, the recoverable gold having been removed. The metal is recovered from the \"pregnant solution\" by reduction with [[zinc]] dust or by [[adsorption]] onto [[activated carbon]]. This process can result in environmental and health problems. A number of [[List of gold mining disasters|environmental disasters]] have followed the overflow of tailing ponds at gold mines. Cyanide contamination of waterways has resulting in numerous cases of human and aquatic species mortality.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAqueous cyanide is hydrolyzed rapidly, especially in sunlight. It can mobilize some heavy metals such as mercury if present. Gold can also be associated with arsenopyrite (FeAsS), which is similar to [[iron pyrite]] (fool's gold), wherein half of the sulfur atoms are replaced by [[arsenic]]. Gold-containing arsenopyrite ores are similarly reactive toward inorganic cyanide.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nCyanide is also used in [[electroplating]], where it stabilizes metal ions in the electrolyte solution prior to their deposition.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===Industrial organic chemistry===\nSome nitriles are produced on a large scale, e.g., [[adiponitrile]] is a precursor to [[nylon]]. Such compounds are often generated by combining hydrogen cyanide and alkenes, i.e., [[hydrocyanation]]:\nRCH=CH<sub>2</sub> + HCN \u2192 RCH(CN)CH<sub>3</sub>. Metal catalysts are required for such reactions.\n\n===Medical uses===\nThe cyanide compound [[sodium nitroprusside]] is used mainly in [[clinical chemistry]] to measure [[urine]] [[ketone bodies]] mainly as a follow-up to [[diabetic]] patients. On occasion, it is used in emergency medical situations to produce a rapid decrease in [[blood pressure]] in humans; it is also used as a [[vasodilator]] in vascular research. The cobalt in artificial [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] contains a cyanide ligand as an artifact of the purification process; this must be removed by the body before the vitamin molecule can be activated for biochemical use. During [[World War I]], a copper cyanide compound was briefly used by [[Japan]]ese physicians for the treatment of [[tuberculosis]] and [[leprosy]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Takano |first=R. |date=August 1916 |title=THE TREATMENT OF LEPROSY WITH CYANOCUPROL |journal=The Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=24 |issue= 2|pages=207\u2013211 |url=http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/2/207 |accessdate=2008-06-28 |doi=10.1084/jem.24.2.207 |pmc=2125457 |pmid=19868035}}</ref>\n\n===Illegal fishing and poaching===\n{{Main|Cyanide fishing}}\nCyanides are illegally used to capture live fish near [[coral reef]]s for the [[aquarium]] and seafood markets.

A positive test gives a blue color. [[Copper(I) cyanide]] is poorly soluble. By sequestering the copper(I) the copper(II) is rendered a stronger [[oxidant]]. The copper, in a cyanide facilitated oxidation, converts the [[amine]] into a colored compound. The [[Nernst equation]] explains this process. Another good example of such chemistry is the way in which the saturated [[calomel]] [[reference electrode]] ([[saturated calomel electrode|SCE]]) works. The copper, in a cyanide-facilitated oxidation, converts the [[amine]] into a colored compound.\n\n===Pyridine-barbituric acid colorimetry===\nA sample containing inorganic cyanide is purged with air from a boiling acid solution into a basic absorber solution. The cyanide salt absorbed in the basic solution is buffered at pH 4.5 and then reacted with chlorine to form cyanogen chloride. The cyanogen chloride formed couples pyridine with barbituric acid to form a strongly colored red dye that is proportional to the cyanide concentration. This colorimetric method following distillation is the basis for most regulatory methods (for instance EPA 335.4) used to analyze cyanide in water, wastewater, and contaminated soils. Distillation followed by colorimetric methods, however, have been found to be prone to interferences from thiocyanate, nitrate, thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfide that can result in both positive and negative bias. It has been recommended by the USEPA (MUR March 12, 2007) that samples containing these compounds be analyzed by Gas-Diffusion Flow Injection Analysis\u2014Amperometry.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\n===Corrinoids colorimetry===\n\nA solution of aquacyano-corrinoids, such as [[cobalamin]] or [[cobinamide]], reacts with free cyanide in an aqueous sample.

The HCN that passes through the membrane is absorbed into a basic carrier solution that transports the CN to an amperometric detector that accurately measures cyanide concentration with high sensitivity. Sample pretreatment determined by acid reagents, ligands, or preliminary UV irradiation allow cyanide speciation of free cyanide, available cyanide, and total cyanide respectively. The relative simplicity of these flow injection analysis methods limit the interference experienced by the high heat of distillation and also prove to be cost effective since time consuming distillations are not required.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{EB1911 Poster|Cyanide}}\n{{Commonscat|Cyanides}}\n*[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mmg/mmg.asp?id=1073&tid=19 ATSDR medical management guidelines for cyanide poisoning (US)]\n*[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/firindex.htm HSE recommendations for first aid treatment of cyanide poisoning (UK)]\n*[http://www.inchem.org/documents/cicads/cicads/cicad61.htm Hydrogen cyanide and cyanides] ([[CICAD]] 61)\n*[http://www.inchem.org/documents/antidote/antidote/ant02.htm#SubSectionNumber:1.13.1 IPCS/CEC Evaluation of antidotes for poisoning by cyanides]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060517035532/http://www.npi.gov.au/database/substance-info/profiles/29.html National Pollutant Inventory\u2014Cyanide compounds fact sheet]\n*[http://www.snopes.com/food/warnings/apples.asp#add Eating apple seeds is safe despite the small amount of cyanide]\n*[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp8.pdf Toxicological Profile for Cyanide, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, July 2006]\n\nSafety data (French):\n\n* Institut national de recherche et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (1997). \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20060220084315/http://www.inrs.fr/inrs-pub/inrs01.nsf/inrs01_ftox_view/860430FE710FCFD7C1256CE8004F67CB/$File/ft4.pdf Cyanure d'hydrog\u00e8ne et solutions aqueuses]\".

Carbonate minerals are extremely varied and ubiquitous in chemically precipitated [[sedimentary rock]]. The most common are [[calcite]] or [[calcium carbonate]], CaCO<sub>3</sub>, the chief constituent of [[limestone]] (as well as the main component of [[mollusc]] shells and [[coral]] skeletons); [[dolomite]], a calcium-magnesium carbonate CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>; and [[siderite]], or [[iron]](II) carbonate, FeCO<sub>3</sub>, an important [[iron ore]]. [[Sodium carbonate]] (\"soda\" or \"natron\") and [[potassium carbonate]] (\"potash\") have been used since antiquity for cleaning and preservation, as well as for the manufacture of [[glass]]. Carbonates are widely used in industry, e.g. in iron smelting, as a raw material for [[Portland cement]] and [[lime (mineral)|lime]] manufacture, in the composition of [[ceramic glaze]]s, and more.\n\n==Structure and bonding==\n\nThe carbonate ion is the simplest [[oxocarbon anion]]. It consists of one [[carbon]] atom surrounded by three [[oxygen]] atoms, in a [[trigonal planar]] arrangement, with ''D''<sub>3h</sub> [[Molecular symmetry#Point Group|molecular symmetry]]. It has a molecular mass of 60.01&nbsp;[[Molar mass|g/mol]] and carries a total [[formal charge]] of &minus;2.

In strongly basic conditions, the carbonate ion predominates, while in weakly basic conditions, the [[bicarbonate]] ion is prevalent. In more acid conditions, aqueous [[carbon dioxide]], CO<sub>2</sub>(aq), is the main form, which, with water, H<sub>2</sub>O, is in equilibrium with carbonic acid{{snd}}the equilibrium lies strongly towards carbon dioxide. Thus [[sodium carbonate]] is basic, [[sodium bicarbonate]] is weakly basic, while carbon dioxide itself is a weak acid.\n\n[[Carbonated water]] is formed by dissolving CO<sub>2</sub> in water under pressure. When the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> is reduced, for example when a can of soda is opened, the equilibrium for each of the forms of carbonate (carbonate, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, and carbonic acid) shifts until the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the solution is equal to the solubility of CO<sub>2</sub> at that temperature and pressure. In living systems an enzyme, [[carbonic anhydrase]], speeds the interconversion of CO<sub>2</sub> and carbonic acid.\n\nAlthough the carbonate salts of most metals are insoluble in water, the same is not true of the bicarbonate salts. In solution this equilibrium between carbonate, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide and carbonic acid changes consonant to changing temperature and pressure conditions. In the case of metal ions with insoluble carbonates, e.g. CaCO<sub>3</sub>, formation of insoluble compounds results. This is an explanation for the buildup of scale inside pipes caused by [[hard water]].\n\n==Carbonate in the Inorganic nomenclature==\nSystematic additive IUPAC name for carbonate anion is trioxidocarbonate(2\u2212).<ref name=\"redbook\" />{{rp|127}} Similarly, [[cyanide]] anion CN<sup>\u2212</sup> is named nitridocarbonate(1\u2212).<ref name=\"redbook\" />{{rp|291}} Following this logic, e.g. carbonate(4\u2212) in the systematic additive nomenclature would mean [[carbide]] anion, but it is not the case.<ref name=\"redbook\" />{{rp|287}}\n\n==Organic carbonates==\n{{main article|Carbonate ester}}\nIn [[organic chemistry]] a carbonate can also refer to a [[functional group]] within a larger molecule that contains a carbon atom bound to three oxygen atoms, one of which is double bonded. These compounds are also known as organocarbonates or carbonate esters, and have the general formula ROCOOR\u2032, or RR\u2032CO<sub>3</sub>. Important organocarbonates include [[dimethyl carbonate]], the cyclic compounds [[ethylene carbonate]] and [[propylene carbonate]], and the phosgene replacement, [[triphosgene]].\n\n==Biological significance==\nIt works as a [[buffer solution|buffer]] in the blood as follows: when pH is low, the concentration of hydrogen ions is too high, so one exhales CO<sub>2</sub>. This will cause the equation to shift left,{{explain|date=January 2018}} essentially decreasing the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions, causing a more basic pH.\n\nWhen pH is too high, the concentration of hydrogen ions in the blood is too low, so the kidneys excrete bicarbonate ({{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}}). This causes the equation to shift right, essentially increasing the concentration of hydrogen ions, causing a more acidic pH.\n\nThree important reversible reactions control the above pH balance:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scifun.org/chemweek/BioBuff/BioBuffers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721174437/http://www.scifun.org/chemweek/BioBuff/BioBuffers.html |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}</ref>\n\n# H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(aq) {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup>(aq) +  {{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}}(aq)\n\n# H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(aq) {{eqm}} CO<sub>2</sub>(aq)  + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)\n\n# CO<sub>2</sub>(aq) {{eqm}} CO<sub>2</sub>(g)\n\nExhaled CO<sub>2</sub>(g) depletes CO<sub>2</sub>(aq), which in turn consumes H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, causing the aforementioned shift left in the first reaction by [[Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle]]. By the same principle, when the pH is too high, the kidneys excrete bicarbonate ({{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}}) into urine as urea via the [[urea cycle]] (or Krebs\u2013Henseleit ornithine cycle). By removing the bicarbonate, more H<sup>+</sup> is generated from carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), which comes from CO<sub>2</sub>(g) produced by [[cellular respiration]].\n\nCrucially, this same buffer operates in the oceans. It is a major factor in climate change and the long-term carbon cycle, due to the large number of marine organisms (especially coral) which are formed of calcium carbonate. Increased solubility of carbonate through increased temperatures results in lower production of marine [[calcite]] and increased concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. This, in turn, increases Earth temperature and is a part of the carbon cycle largely ignored by the global news media. The tonnage of {{chem|CO|3|2\u2212}} is on a geological scale and may all be redissolved into the sea and released to the atmosphere, increasing CO<sub>2</sub> levels even more.\n\n==Carbonate salts==\n{{see also|Category:Carbonates}}\n\n* Carbonate overview:\n{{Carbonates}}\n\n==Presence outside Earth==\nIt is generally thought that the presence of carbonates in [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is strong evidence for the presence of liquid water.

Because of this, only very small amounts of catalyst are required to alter the reaction rate in principle.<ref>[http://www.anl.gov/articles/7-things-you-may-not-know-about-catalysis 7 things you may not know about catalysis] Louise Lerner, [[Argonne National Laboratory]] (2011)</ref>\n\nIn general, chemical reactions occur faster in the presence of a catalyst because the catalyst provides an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower [[activation energy]] than the non-catalyzed mechanism. In catalyzed mechanisms, the catalyst usually reacts to form a temporary [[reaction intermediate|intermediate]], which then regenerates the original catalyst in a cyclic process.\n\nA substance which provides a mechanism with a higher activation energy does not reduce the rate because the reaction can still occur by the non-catalyzed route.<ref name=LM82/> An added substance which does reduce the reaction rate is not considered a catalyst<ref name=\"IUPACc\"/> but a [[reaction inhibitor]] ([[#Inhibitors, poisons, and promoters|see below]]).\n\nCatalysts may be classified as either homogeneous or heterogeneous. A homogeneous catalyst is one whose [[molecule]]s are dispersed in the same phase (usually gaseous or liquid) as the [[reactant]]'s molecules. A heterogeneous catalyst is one whose molecules are not in the same phase as the reactant's, which are typically gases or liquids that are [[adsorption|adsorbed]] onto the surface of the solid catalyst. [[Enzyme]]s and other biocatalysts are often considered as a third category.\n\n==Technical perspective==\n\nIn the presence of a catalyst, less [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] is required to reach the [[transition state]], but the total free energy from reactants to products does not change.<ref name=\"IUPACc\" /> A catalyst may participate in multiple chemical transformations. The effect of a catalyst may vary due to the presence of other substances known as inhibitors or [[Catalyst poisoning|poisons]] (which reduce the catalytic activity) or promoters (which increase the activity and also affect the temperature of the reaction).<ref name=\"IUPACc\" />\n\nCatalyzed reactions have a lower [[activation energy]] (rate-limiting free energy of activation) than the corresponding uncatalyzed reaction, resulting in a higher reaction rate at the same temperature and for the same reactant [[concentration]]s. However, the detailed mechanics of catalysis is complex. Catalysts may bind to the reagents to polarize bonds, e.g. [[acid catalyst]]s for reactions of [[carbonyl]] compounds, or form specific intermediates that are not produced naturally, such as osmate [[ester]]s in [[osmium tetroxide]]-catalyzed [[dihydroxylation]] of [[alkene]]s, or cause [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] of reagents to reactive forms, such as [[chemisorption|chemisorbed hydrogen]] in [[catalytic hydrogenation]].\n\n[[Chemical kinetics|Kinetically]], catalytic reactions are typical [[chemical reaction]]s; i.e. the reaction rate depends on the frequency of contact of the reactants in the rate-determining step.  Usually, the catalyst participates in this slowest step, and rates are limited by amount of catalyst and its \"activity\".  In [[heterogeneous catalysis]], the diffusion of reagents to the surface and diffusion of products from the surface can be rate determining. A [[nanomaterial-based catalyst]] is an example of a heterogeneous catalyst. Analogous events associated with [[substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] binding and product dissociation apply to homogeneous catalysts.\n\nAlthough catalysts are not consumed by the reaction itself, they may be inhibited, deactivated, or destroyed by secondary processes.  In [[heterogeneous]] catalysis, typical secondary processes include [[coking]] where the catalyst becomes covered by [[polymer]]ic side products.  Additionally, heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid\u2013liquid system or sublimate in a solid\u2013gas system.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe production of most industrially important chemicals involves catalysis. Similarly, most biochemically significant processes are catalysed.  Research into catalysis is a major field in [[applied science]] and involves many areas of chemistry, notably [[organometallic chemistry]] and [[materials science]].  Catalysis is relevant to many aspects of [[environmental science]], e.g. the [[catalytic converter]] in automobiles and the dynamics of the [[ozone hole]]. Catalytic reactions are preferred in environmentally friendly [[green chemistry]] due to the reduced amount of waste generated,<ref>{{cite web | title=The 12 Principles of Green Chemistry | work=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | url=http://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/june2011/principles.htm | accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref> as opposed to [[stoichiometric]] reactions in which all reactants are consumed and more side products are formed. Many [[transition metal]]s and transition metal [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] are used in catalysis as well. Catalysts called [[enzyme]]s are important in [[biology]].\n\nA catalyst works by providing an alternative reaction pathway to the reaction product. The rate of the reaction is increased as this alternative route has a lower [[activation energy]] than the reaction route not mediated by the catalyst. The [[disproportionation]] of [[hydrogen peroxide]] creates water and [[oxygen]], as shown below.\n:2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>  \u2192   2 H<sub>2</sub>O  +  O<sub>2</sub>\nThis reaction is preferable in the sense that the reaction products are more stable than the starting material, though the uncatalysed reaction is slow. In fact, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is so slow that hydrogen peroxide solutions are commercially available. This reaction is strongly affected by catalysts such as [[manganese dioxide]], or the enzyme [[peroxidase]] in organisms. Upon the addition of a small amount of [[manganese dioxide]], the hydrogen peroxide reacts rapidly. This effect is readily seen by the [[Effervescence (chemistry)|effervescence]] of oxygen.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] |title=Genie in a Bottle |url=http://www.chem.umn.edu/services/lecturedemo/info/genie.htm |date=2005-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405195443/http://www.chem.umn.edu/services/lecturedemo/info/genie.htm |archivedate=2008-04-05 |df= }}</ref> The manganese dioxide is not consumed in the reaction, and thus may be recovered unchanged, and re-used indefinitely.

Catalytic activity is not a kind of reaction rate, but a property of the [[catalyst]] under certain conditions, in relation to a specific [[chemical reaction]]. Catalytic activity of one katal (Symbol 1 kat = 1&nbsp;mol/s) of a catalyst means one mole of that catalyst (substance, in [[Mole (unit)|Mol]]) will catalyse 1 mole of the reactant to product in one second. A catalyst may and usually will have different catalytic activity for distinct reactions. See [[katal]] for an example.\n\nThere are further derived SI units related to catalytic activity, see the above reference for details.\n\n===Typical mechanism===\n{{Main article|catalytic cycle}}\n\nCatalysts generally react with one or more reactants to form [[reaction intermediate|intermediates]] that subsequently give the final reaction product, in the process regenerating the catalyst. The following is a typical reaction scheme, where '''''C''''' represents the catalyst, X and Y are reactants, and Z is the product of the reaction of X and Y:\n{{NumBlk|:|X + '''''C''''' \u2192 X'''''C'''''   |{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|Y + X'''''C''''' \u2192 XY'''''C''''' |{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|XY'''''C''''' \u2192 '''''C'''''Z     |{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|'''''C'''''Z \u2192 '''''C''''' + Z   |{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nAlthough the catalyst is consumed by reaction {{EquationNote|1}}, it is subsequently produced by reaction {{EquationNote|4}}, so it does not occur in the overall reaction equation:\n:X + Y \u2192 Z\nAs a catalyst is regenerated in a reaction, often only small amounts are needed to increase the rate of the reaction. In practice, however, catalysts are sometimes consumed in secondary processes.\n\nThe catalyst does usually appear in the [[rate equation]]. For example, if the [[rate-determining step]] in the above reaction scheme is the first step <br/>  X + C \u2192 XC, the catalyzed reaction will be [[Order of reaction|second order]] with rate equation v = k<sub>cat</sub>[X][C], which is proportional to the catalyst concentration [C]. However [C] remains constant during the reaction so that the catalyzed reaction is [[Order of reaction#Pseudo-first order|pseudo-first order]]:\nv = k<sub>obs</sub>[X],   where k<sub>obs</sub> = k<sub>cat</sub>[C].\n\nAs an example of a detailed mechanism at the microscopic level, in 2008 Danish researchers first revealed the sequence of events when [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] combine on the surface of [[titanium dioxide]] (TiO<sub>2</sub>, or ''titania'') to produce water.  With a time-lapse series of [[scanning tunneling microscopy]] images, they determined the molecules undergo [[adsorption]], [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[diffusion]] before reacting.  The intermediate reaction states were: HO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, then H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the final reaction product ([[Water dimer|water molecule dimer]]s), after which the water molecule [[desorption|desorbs]] from the catalyst surface.<ref>{{cite news\n| first = Mitch\n| last = Jacoby\n| date = 16 February 2009\n| title = Making Water Step by Step\n| newspaper = [[Chemical & Engineering News]]\n| page = 10\n| url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/87/i07/8707notw6.html\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n| vauthors = Matthiesen J, Wendt S, Hansen J\u00d8, Madsen GK, Lira E, Galliker P, Vestergaard EK, Schaub R, Laegsgaard E, Hammer B, Besenbacher F\n| year = 2009\n| title = Observation of All the Intermediate Steps of a Chemical Reaction on an Oxide Surface by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy\n| journal = [[ACS Nano]]\n| volume = 3\n| issue = 3\n| pages = 517\u2013526\n| issn = 1520-605X\n| doi = 10.1021/nn8008245\n| pmid = 19309169\n| url = http://www.ltnt.ethz.ch/people/gapatric/2009_Matthiesen.pdf\n}}</ref>\n\n===Reaction energetics===\n\n[[Image:CatalysisScheme.png|thumb|right|292px|Generic potential energy diagram showing the effect of a catalyst in a hypothetical exothermic chemical reaction X + Y to give Z. The presence of the catalyst opens a different reaction pathway (shown in red) with a lower activation energy. The final result and the overall thermodynamics are the same.]]\nCatalysts work by providing an (alternative) mechanism involving a different [[transition state]] and lower [[activation energy]]. Consequently,  more molecular collisions have the energy needed to reach the transition state. Hence, catalysts can enable reactions that would otherwise be blocked or slowed by a kinetic barrier.  The catalyst may increase reaction rate or selectivity, or enable the reaction at lower temperatures. This effect can be illustrated with an [[Energy profile (chemistry)|energy profile]] diagram.\n\nIn the catalyzed [[elementary reaction]], catalysts do '''not''' change the extent of a reaction: they have '''no''' effect on the [[chemical equilibrium]] of a reaction because the rate of both the forward and the reverse reaction are both affected (see also [[thermodynamics]]).  The [[second law of thermodynamics]] describes why a catalyst does not change the chemical equilibrium of a reaction.  Suppose there was such a catalyst that shifted an equilibrium. Introducing the catalyst to the system would result in a reaction to move to the new equilibrium, producing energy. Production of energy is a necessary result since reactions are spontaneous only if [[Gibbs free energy]] is produced, and if there is no energy barrier, there is no need for a catalyst. Then, removing the catalyst would also result in reaction, producing energy; i.e. the addition and its reverse process, removal, would both produce energy. Thus, a catalyst that could change the equilibrium would be a [[perpetual motion machine]], a contradiction to the laws of thermodynamics.<ref>Robertson, A.J.B. (1970) ''Catalysis of Gas Reactions by Metals''. Logos Press, London.</ref> Thus, catalyst '''does not''' alter the equilibrium constant. (A catalyst can however change the equilibrium concentrations by reacting in a subsequent step. It is then consumed as the reaction proceeds, and thus it is also a reactant. Illustrative is the base-catalysed [[hydrolysis]] of [[ester]]s, where the produced [[carboxylic acid]] immediately reacts with the base catalyst and thus the reaction equilibrium is shifted towards hydrolysis.)\n\nThe [[SI derived unit]] for measuring the '''catalytic activity''' of a catalyst is the [[katal]], which is moles per second. The productivity of a catalyst can be described by the [[turnover number]] (or TON) and the catalytic activity by the ''turn over frequency'' (TOF), which is the TON per time unit. The biochemical equivalent is the [[enzyme unit]].  For more information on the efficiency of enzymatic catalysis, see the article on ''[[Enzyme#Kinetics|enzymes]]''.\n\nThe catalyst stabilizes the transition state more than it stabilizes the starting material.  It decreases the kinetic barrier by decreasing the ''difference'' in energy between starting material and transition state. It '''does not''' change the energy difference between starting materials and products (thermodynamic barrier), or the available energy (this is provided by the environment as heat or light).\n\n===Materials===\n\nThe chemical nature of catalysts is as diverse as catalysis itself, although some generalizations can be made.  Proton [[acid]]s are probably the most widely used catalysts, especially for the many reactions involving water, including hydrolysis and its reverse.  Multifunctional solids often are catalytically active, e.g. [[zeolite]]s, [[alumina]], higher-order oxides, graphitic carbon, nanoparticles, nanodots, and facets of bulk materials.  [[Transition metals]] are often used to catalyze [[redox]] reactions (oxidation, hydrogenation). Examples are [[nickel]], such as [[Raney nickel]] for hydrogenation, and [[vanadium(V) oxide]] for oxidation of [[sulfur dioxide]] into [[sulfur trioxide]] by the so-called [[contact process]].  Many catalytic processes, especially those used in organic synthesis, require \"late transition metals\", such as [[palladium]], [[platinum]], [[gold]], [[ruthenium]], [[rhodium]], or [[iridium]].\n\nSome so-called catalysts are really '''precatalysts'''.  Precatalysts convert to catalysts in the reaction. For example, [[Wilkinson's catalyst]] RhCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> loses one triphenylphosphine ligand before entering the true catalytic cycle. Precatalysts are easier to store but are easily activated [[in situ#Chemistry and chemical engineering|in situ]]. Because of this preactivation step, many catalytic reactions involve an [[induction period]].\n\nChemical species that improve catalytic activity are called '''co-catalysts''' ('''cocatalysts''') or '''promotors''' in '''cooperative catalysis'''.\n\n==Types==\n\nCatalysts can be [[heterogeneous]] or [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]], depending on whether a catalyst exists in the same [[phase (matter)|phase]] as the [[substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]. [[Biocatalysts]] (enzymes) are often seen as a separate group.\n\n===Heterogeneous catalysts===\n{{Main article|Heterogeneous catalysis}}\n\n[[File:Zeolite-ZSM-5-vdW.png|thumb|right|The microporous molecular structure of the [[zeolite]] ZSM-5 is exploited in catalysts used in refineries]]\n[[File:Ceolite nax.JPG|thumb|Zeolites are extruded as pellets for easy handling in catalytic reactors.]]\nHeterogeneous catalysts act in a different [[phase (matter)|phase]] than the [[reactants]]. Most heterogeneous catalysts are [[solid]]s that act on substrates in a [[liquid]] or gaseous [[reaction mixture]]. Diverse mechanisms for [[reactions on surfaces]] are known, depending on how the adsorption takes place ([[Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson|Langmuir-Hinshelwood]], [[Eley\u2013Rideal mechanism|Eley-Rideal]], and Mars-van Krevelen).<ref>Kn\u00f6zinger, Helmut and Kochloefl, Karl (2002) \"Heterogeneous Catalysis and Solid Catalysts\" in Ullmann's ''Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a05_313}}</ref> The total surface area of solid has an important effect on the reaction rate. The smaller the catalyst particle size, the larger the surface area for a given mass of particles.\n\nA heterogeneous catalyst has '''active sites''', which are the atoms or crystal faces where the reaction actually occurs. Depending on the mechanism, the active site may be either a planar exposed metal surface, a crystal edge with imperfect metal valence or a complicated combination of the two. Thus, not only most of the volume, but also most of the surface of a heterogeneous catalyst may be catalytically inactive. Finding out the nature of the active site requires technically challenging research. Thus, empirical research for finding out new metal combinations for catalysis continues.\n\nFor example, in the [[Haber process]], finely divided [[iron]] serves as a catalyst for the synthesis of [[ammonia]] from [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]]. The reacting [[gas]]es [[adsorb]] onto active sites on the iron particles. Once physically adsorbed, the reagents undergo [[chemisorption]] that results in dissociation into adsorbed atomic species, and new bonds between the resulting fragments form in part due to their close proximity. In this way the particularly strong [[triple bond]] in nitrogen is broken, which would be extremely uncommon in the gas phase due to its high activation energy. Thus, the activation energy of the overall reaction is lowered, and the rate of reaction increases.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Another place where a heterogeneous catalyst is applied is in the oxidation of sulfur dioxide on [[vanadium(V) oxide]] for the production of [[sulfuric acid]].\n\nHeterogeneous catalysts are typically \"[[catalyst support|supported]],\" which means that the catalyst is dispersed on a second material that enhances the effectiveness or minimizes their cost. Supports prevent or reduce agglomeration and sintering of the small catalyst particles, exposing more surface area, thus catalysts have a higher specific activity (per gram) on a support. Sometimes the support is merely a surface on which the catalyst is spread to increase the surface area. More often, the support and the catalyst interact, affecting the catalytic reaction. Supports are porous materials with a high surface area, most commonly [[alumina]], [[zeolites]] or various kinds of [[activated carbon]]. Specialized supports include [[silicon dioxide]], [[titanium dioxide]], [[calcium carbonate]], and [[barium sulfate]].\n\n====Electrocatalysts====\n{{Main article|Electrocatalyst}}\n\nIn the context of [[electrochemistry]], specifically in [[fuel cell]] engineering, various metal-containing catalysts are used to enhance the rates of the [[half reaction]]s that comprise the fuel cell. One common type of fuel cell electrocatalyst is based upon [[nanoparticles]] of [[platinum]] that are supported on slightly larger [[carbon]] particles. When in contact with one of the [[electrodes]] in a fuel cell, this platinum increases the rate of [[oxygen]] reduction either to water, or to [[hydroxide]] or [[hydrogen peroxide]].\n\n===Homogeneous catalysts===\n{{Main article|Homogeneous catalysis}}\n\nHomogeneous catalysts function in the same phase as the reactants, but the mechanistic principles involved in heterogeneous catalysis are generally applicable. Typically homogeneous catalysts are dissolved in a solvent with the substrates.  One example of homogeneous catalysis involves the influence of [[hydrogen|H]]<sup>+</sup> on the [[esterification]] of carboxylic acids, such as the formation of [[methyl acetate]] from [[acetic acid]] and [[methanol]].<ref>Behr, Arno (2002) \"Organometallic Compounds and Homogeneous Catalysis\" in Ullmann's ''Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a18_215}}</ref> One high-volume process requiring a homogeneous catalyst is [[hydroformylation]], which adds [[carbon monoxide]] to an [[alkene]] to produce an alkyl [[aldehyde]]. The aldehyde can be converted to various products such as alcohols or acids (for e.g. detergents) or [[polyol]]s (for plastics such as [[polycarbonate]] or [[polyurethane]]). For inorganic chemists, homogeneous catalysis is often synonymous with [[organometallic chemistry|organometallic catalysts]].<ref>Elschenbroich, C. (2006) ''Organometallics''. Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. {{ISBN|978-3-527-29390-2}}</ref>\n\n====Organocatalysis====\n{{Main article|Organocatalysis}}\n\nWhereas transition metals sometimes attract most of the attention in the study of catalysis, small organic molecules without metals can also exhibit catalytic properties, as is apparent from the fact that many [[enzyme]]s lack transition metals.  Typically, organic catalysts require a higher loading (amount of catalyst per unit amount of reactant, expressed in [[mol%]] [[amount of substance]]) than transition metal(-ion)-based catalysts, but these catalysts are usually commercially available in bulk, helping to reduce costs.  In the early 2000s, these organocatalysts were considered \"new generation\" and are competitive to traditional [[metal]](-ion)-containing catalysts.  Organocatalysts are supposed to operate akin to metal-free enzymes utilizing, e.g., non-covalent interactions such as [[hydrogen bonding]]. The discipline organocatalysis is divided in the application of covalent (e.g., [[proline]], [[4-Dimethylaminopyridine|DMAP]]) and non-covalent (e.g., [[thiourea organocatalysis]]) organocatalysts referring to the preferred catalyst-[[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] [[binding (molecular)|binding]] and interaction, respectively.\n\n===Photocatalysts===\n\n[[Photocatalysis]] is the phenomenon where the catalyst can receive light (such as visible light), be promoted to an excited state, and then undergo intersystem crossing with the starting material, returning to ground state without being consumed. The excited state of the starting material will then undergo reactions it ordinarily could not if directly illuminated. For example, [[singlet oxygen]] is usually produced by photocatalysis. Photocatalysts are also the main ingredient in [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s.\n\n===Enzymes and biocatalysts===\n{{Main article|enzyme catalysis}}\n\nIn biology, [[enzyme]]s are protein-based catalysts in [[metabolism]] and [[catabolism]]. Most biocatalysts are enzymes, but other non-protein-based classes of biomolecules also exhibit catalytic properties including [[ribozyme]]s, and synthetic [[deoxyribozyme]]s.<ref>Nelson, D. L. and Cox, M. M. (2000) ''Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry'' 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New York. {{ISBN|1-57259-153-6}}.</ref>\n\nBiocatalysts can be thought of as intermediate between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, although strictly speaking soluble enzymes are homogeneous catalysts and [[Biological membrane|membrane]]-bound enzymes are heterogeneous. Several factors affect the activity of enzymes (and other catalysts) including temperature, pH, concentration of enzyme, substrate, and products.  A particularly important reagent in enzymatic reactions is water, which is the product of many bond-forming reactions and a reactant in many bond-breaking processes.\n\nIn [[biocatalysis]], enzymes are employed to prepare many commodity chemicals including [[high-fructose corn syrup]] and [[acrylamide]].\n\nSome [[monoclonal antibodies]] whose binding target is a stable molecule which resembles the transition state of a chemical reaction can function as weak catalysts for that chemical reaction by lowering its activation energy.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130821044547/http://www.documentroot.com/2010/03/catalytic-antibodies-simply-explained.html Catalytic Antibodies Simply Explained]. Documentroot.com (2010-03-06). Retrieved on 2015-11-11.</ref>  Such catalytic antibodies are sometimes called \"[[abzymes]]\".\n\n===Nanocatalysts===\n{{Main|Nanomaterial-based catalyst}}\n\nNanocatalysts are nanomaterials with catalytic activities. They have been extensively explored for wide range of applications. Among them, the nanocatalysts with enzyme mimicking activities are collectively called as [[Artificial enzyme#Nanozymes|nanozymes]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wei|first=Hui|last2=Wang|first2=Erkang|date=2013-06-21|title=Nanomaterials with enzyme-like characteristics (nanozymes): next-generation artificial enzymes|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/cs/c3cs35486e|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|language=en|volume=42|issue=14|doi=10.1039/C3CS35486E|issn=1460-4744}}</ref>\n\n===Tandem catalysis===\n\nIn [[tandem catalysis]] two or more different catalysts are coupled in a one-pot reaction.\n\n===Autocatalysis===\n{{Main article|Autocatalysis}}\n\nIn autocatalysis, the catalyst ''is'' a product of the overall reaction, in contrast to all other types of catalysis considered in this article. The simplest example of autocatalysis is a reaction of type A + B \u2192 2 B, in one or in several steps. The overall reaction is just A \u2192 B, so that B is a product. But since B is also a reactant, it may be present in the rate equation and affect the reaction rate. As the reaction proceeds, the concentration of B increases and can accelerate the reaction as a catalyst. In effect, the reaction accelerates itself or is autocatalyzed.\n\nA real example is the hydrolysis of an [[ester]] such as [[aspirin]] to a [[carboxylic acid]] and an [[alcohol]]. In the absence of added acid catalysts, the carboxylic acid product catalyzes the hydrolysis.\n\n==Significance==\n\n[[File:Verbrennung eines Zuckerw\u00fcrfels.png|thumb|Left: Partially caramelised [[cube sugar]], Right: burning cube sugar with ash as catalyst]]\n[[File:TiCrPt micropump3.webm|thumb|A Ti-Cr-Pt tube (~40 \u03bcm long) releases oxygen bubbles when immersed in [[hydrogen peroxide]] (via catalytic decomposition), forming a [[micropump]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C1CP20542K|pmid=21505711|title=Tunable catalytic tubular micro-pumps operating at low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=13|issue=21|pages=10131|year=2011|last1=Solovev|first1=Alexander A.|last2=Sanchez|first2=Samuel|last3=Mei|first3=Yongfeng|last4=Schmidt|first4=Oliver G.|bibcode=2011PCCP...1310131S}}</ref>]]\n\nEstimates are that 90% of all commercially produced chemical products involve catalysts at some stage in the process of their manufacture.<ref>\"Recognizing the Best in Innovation: Breakthrough Catalyst\". ''R&D Magazine'', September 2005, p. 20.</ref> In 2005, catalytic processes generated about $900 billion in products worldwide.<ref>[http://www.climatetechnology.gov/library/2005/tech-options/tor2005-143.pdf 1.4.3 INDUSTRIAL PROCESS EFFICIENCY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517071700/http://www.climatetechnology.gov/library/2005/tech-options/tor2005-143.pdf |date=2008-05-17 }}. climatetechnology.gov</ref>  Catalysis is so pervasive that subareas are not readily classified.  Some areas of particular concentration are surveyed below.\n\n===Energy processing===\n\n[[Petroleum]] refining makes intensive use of catalysis for [[alkylation]], [[catalytic cracking]] (breaking long-chain hydrocarbons into smaller pieces), [[Petroleum naphtha|naphtha]] reforming and [[steam reforming]] (conversion of [[hydrocarbon]]s into [[synthesis gas]]).  Even the exhaust from the burning of fossil fuels is treated via catalysis: [[Catalytic converter]]s, typically composed of [[platinum]] and [[rhodium]], break down some of the more harmful byproducts of automobile exhaust.\n:2 CO  +  2 NO  \u2192   2 CO<sub>2</sub>  +  N<sub>2</sub>\n\nWith regard to synthetic fuels, an old but still important process is the [[Fischer-Tropsch synthesis]] of hydrocarbons from [[synthesis gas]], which itself is processed via [[water gas shift reaction|water-gas shift reaction]]s, catalysed by iron.  [[Biodiesel]] and related biofuels require processing via both inorganic and biocatalysts.\n\n[[Fuel cell]]s rely on catalysts for both the anodic and cathodic reactions.\n\n[[Catalytic heater]]s generate flameless heat from a supply of combustible fuel.\n\n===Bulk chemicals===\n\nSome of the largest-scale chemicals are produced via catalytic oxidation, often using [[oxygen]].  Examples include [[nitric acid]] (from ammonia), [[sulfuric acid]] (from [[sulfur dioxide]] to [[sulfur trioxide]] by the [[contact process]]), [[terephthalic acid]] from p-xylene, and [[acrylonitrile]] from propane and ammonia.\n\nMany other chemical products are generated by large-scale reduction, often via [[hydrogenation]].  The largest-scale example is [[ammonia]], which is prepared via the [[Haber process]] from [[nitrogen]].  [[Methanol]] is prepared from [[carbon monoxide]].\n\nBulk polymers derived from [[ethylene]] and [[propylene]] are often prepared via [[Ziegler-Natta catalysis]].  Polyesters, polyamides, and [[isocyanate]]s are derived via [[acid-base catalysis]].\n\nMost [[carbonylation]] processes require metal catalysts, examples include the [[Monsanto acetic acid process]] and [[hydroformylation]].\n\n===Fine chemicals===\n\nMany [[fine chemicals]] are prepared via catalysis; methods include those of heavy industry as well as more specialized processes that would be prohibitively expensive on a large scale.  Examples include the [[Heck reaction]], and [[Friedel\u2013Crafts reaction]]s.\n\nBecause most bioactive compounds are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]], many pharmaceuticals are produced by enantioselective catalysis (catalytic [[asymmetric synthesis]]).\n\n===Food processing===\n\nOne of the most obvious applications of catalysis is the [[hydrogenation]] (reaction with [[hydrogen]] gas) of fats using [[nickel]] catalyst to produce [[margarine]].<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Chemguide | title = Types of catalysis | url = http://www.chemguide.co.uk/physical/catalysis/introduction.html | accessdate = 2008-07-09}}</ref>  Many other foodstuffs are prepared via biocatalysis (see below).\n\n===Environment===\n\nCatalysis impacts the environment by increasing the efficiency of industrial processes, but catalysis also plays a direct role in the environment. A notable example is the catalytic role of [[chlorine]] [[free radical]]s in the breakdown of [[ozone]]. These radicals are formed by the action of [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]] on [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs).\n:Cl<sup>'''\u00b7'''</sup>  +  O<sub>3</sub>  \u2192   ClO<sup>'''\u00b7'''</sup>  +  O<sub>2</sub>\n:ClO<sup>'''\u00b7'''</sup>  +  O<sup>\u00b7</sup>  \u2192  Cl<sup>'''\u00b7'''</sup>  +  O<sub>2</sub>\n\n==History==\n\nGenerally speaking,<ref>B\u00e5rd Lindstr\u00f6m and Lars J.

(1835) ''\u00c5rsber\u00e4ttelsen om framsteg i fysik och kemi'' [Annual report on progress in physics and chemistry]. Stockholm, Sweden:  Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.  After reviewing Eilhard Mitscherlich's research on the formation of ether, Berzelius coins the word ''katalys'' (catalysis) on [https://books.google.com/books?id=1DM1AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q&f=false page 245]:\n<blockquote>Original:  ''Jag skall derf\u00f6re, f\u00f6r att begagna en i kemien v\u00e4lk\u00e4nd h\u00e4rledning, kalla den kroppars'' katalytiska kraft, ''s\u00f6nderdelning genom denna kraft ''katalys, ''likasom vi med ordet analys beteckna \u00e5tskiljandet af kroppars best\u00e5ndsdelar medelst den vanliga kemiska fr\u00e4ndskapen.''</blockquote> \n<blockquote>''Translation'':  I shall, therefore, to employ a well-known derivation in chemistry, call [the catalytic] bodies [i.e., substances] the ''catalytic force'' and the decomposition of [other] bodies by this force ''catalysis'', just as we signify by the word ''analysis'' the separation of the constituents of bodies by the usual chemical affinities.</blockquote></ref> to describe reactions that are accelerated by substances that remain unchanged after the reaction.

Promoters are substances that increase the catalytic activity, even though they are not catalysts by themselves.\n\nInhibitors are sometimes referred to as \"negative catalysts\" since they decrease the reaction rate.<ref name=Laidler78/> However the term inhibitor is preferred since they do not work by introducing a reaction path with higher activation energy; this would not reduce the rate since the reaction would continue to occur by the non-catalyzed path. Instead they act either by deactivating catalysts, or by removing reaction intermediates such as free radicals.<ref name=Laidler78>Laidler, K.J.

For instance, in the reduction of [[alkyne]]s to [[alkene]]s, a [[palladium]] (Pd) catalyst partly \"poisoned\" with [[lead(II) acetate]] (Pb(CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) can be used.<ref name=Lindlar>{{OrgSynth | author = Lindlar, H. and Dubuis, R. | title = Palladium Catalyst for Partial Reduction of Acetylenes | collvol = 5 | collvolpages = 880 | year = 2016 | doi=10.15227/orgsyn.046.0089}}</ref> Without the deactivation of the catalyst, the alkene produced would be further reduced to [[alkane]].<ref>Jencks, W.P.

Another mechanism is the modification of surface geometry. For instance, in hydrogenation operations, large planes of metal surface function as sites of [[hydrogenolysis]] catalysis while sites catalyzing [[hydrogenation]] of unsaturates are smaller. Thus, a poison that covers surface randomly will tend to reduce the number of uncontaminated large planes but leave proportionally more smaller sites free, thus changing the hydrogenation vs. hydrogenolysis selectivity. Many other mechanisms are also possible.\n\nPromoters can cover up surface to prevent production of a mat of coke, or even actively remove such material (e.g., rhenium on platinum in [[catalytic reforming|platforming]]). They can aid the dispersion of the catalytic material or bind to reagents .\n\n==Current market==\n\nThe global demand for catalysts in 2010 was estimated at approximately 29.5 billion USD.

The French mathematician [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] was the first to formulate such models in the 19th century.\n\n==Explanation==\n{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Branches}}\nModeling an object as a continuum assumes that the substance of the object completely fills the space it occupies. Modeling objects in this way ignores the fact that matter is made of [[atom]]s, and so is not continuous; however, on [[length scale]]s much greater than that of inter-atomic distances, such models are highly accurate. Fundamental physical laws such as the [[conservation of mass]], the [[conservation of momentum]], and the [[conservation of energy]] may be applied to such models to derive [[differential equations]] describing the behavior of such objects, and some information about the particular material studied is added through [[constitutive relation]]s.\n\nContinuum mechanics deals with physical properties of solids and fluids which are independent of any particular [[coordinate system]] in which they are observed. These physical properties are then represented by [[tensor]]s, which are mathematical objects that have the required property of being independent of coordinate system. These tensors can be expressed in coordinate systems for computational convenience.\n\n==Concept of a continuum==\nMaterials, such as solids, liquids and gases, are composed of [[molecule]]s separated by space. On a microscopic scale, materials have cracks and discontinuities. However, certain physical phenomena can be modeled assuming the materials exist as a ''continuum, meaning the matter in the body is continuously distributed and fills the entire region of space it occupies''. A continuum is a body that can be continually sub-divided into [[infinitesimal]] elements with properties being those of the bulk material.\n\nThe validity of the continuum assumption may be verified by a theoretical analysis, in which either some clear periodicity is identified or [[Homogeneity (statistics)|statistical homogeneity]] and [[ergodicity]] of the [[microstructure]] exists. More specifically, the continuum hypothesis/assumption hinges on the concepts of a [[representative elementary volume]] and separation of scales based on the [[Hill\u2013Mandel condition]]. This condition provides a link between an experimentalist's and a theoretician's viewpoint on constitutive equations (linear and nonlinear elastic/inelastic or coupled fields) as well as a way of spatial and statistical averaging of the microstructure.<ref>{{cite book |title=Microstructural randomness and scaling in mechanics of materials |last=Ostoja-Starzewski |first=M. |year=2008 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=1-58488-417-7 |chapter= 7-10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Qyf1woZPNgC&printsec=frontcover&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref>\n\nWhen the separation of scales does not hold, or when one wants to establish a continuum of a finer resolution than that of the representative volume element (RVE) size, one employs a ''statistical volume element'' (SVE), which, in turn, leads to random continuum fields. The latter then provide a micromechanics basis for stochastic finite elements (SFE). The levels of SVE and RVE link continuum mechanics to [[statistical mechanics]]. The RVE may be assessed only in a limited way via experimental testing: when the constitutive response becomes spatially homogeneous.\n\nSpecifically for [[fluid]]s, the [[Knudsen number]] is used to assess to what extent the approximation of continuity can be made.\n\n==Car traffic as an introductory example==\nConsider car traffic on a highway, with just one lane for simplicity.\nSomewhat surprisingly, and in a tribute to its effectiveness, continuum mechanics effectively models the movement of cars via a [[partial differential equation]] (PDE) for the density of cars.\nThe familiarity of this situation empowers us to understand a little of the continuum-discrete dichotomy underlying continuum modelling in general.\n\nTo start modelling define that: <math>x</math> measure distance (in km) along the highway; <math>t</math> is time (in minutes); <math>\\rho(x,t)</math> is the density of cars on the highway (in cars/km in the lane); and <math>u(x,t)</math> is the [[flow velocity]] (average velocity) of those cars 'at' position <math>x</math>.\n\n===Conservation derives a PDE ([[Partial differential equation]])===\nCars do not appear and disappear.\nConsider any group of cars: from the particular car at the back of the group located at <math>x=a(t)</math> to the particular car at the front located at <math>x=b(t)</math>.\nThe total number of cars in this group <math>N=\\int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} \\rho(x,t)\\,dx</math>.\nSince cars are conserved (if there is  overtaking, then the `car at the front \\ back' may become a different car) <math>dN/dt=0</math>.\nBut via the [[Leibniz integral rule]]\n:<math>\\begin{array}{rcl}\\frac{dN}{dt}&=&\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} \\rho(x,t)\\,dx\n\\\\&=&\\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t}\\,dx\n+\\rho(b,t)\\frac{db}{dt}-\\rho(a,t)\\frac{da}{dt}\n\\\\&=&\\int_{a}^{b} \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t}\\,dx\n+\\rho(b,t)u(b,t)-\\rho(a,t)u(a,t)\n\\\\&=&\\int_{a}^{b} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t}+ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\rho u) \\right] dx\n\\end{array}</math>\nThis integral being zero holds for all groups, that is, for all intervals <math>[a,b]</math>.\nThe only way an integral can be zero for all intervals is if the integrand is zero for all <math>x</math>.\nConsequently, conservation derives the first order nonlinear conservation PDE\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t}+ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\rho u)=0</math>\nfor all positions on the highway.\n\nThis conservation PDE applies not only to car traffic but also to fluids, solids, crowds, animals, plants, bushfires, financial traders, and so on.\n\n===Observation closes the problem===\nThe previous PDE is one equation with two unknowns, so another equation is needed to form a [[well-posed problem]]. Such an extra equation is typically needed in continuum mechanics and typically comes from experiments. For car traffic it is well established that cars typically travel at a speed depending upon density, <math>u=V(\\rho)</math> for some experimentally determined function <math>V</math> that is a decreasing function of density. For example, experiments in the [[Lincoln Tunnel]] found that a good fit (except at low density) is obtained by <math>u=V(\\rho)=27.5\\ln(142/\\rho)</math> (km/hr for density in cars/km).<ref>{{cite book |first=A.

Configuration of a continuum body]]\nContinuum mechanics models begin by assigning a region in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] to the material body <math>\\mathcal B</math> being modeled. The points within this region are called particles or material points. Different ''configurations'' or states of the body correspond to different regions in Euclidean space. The region corresponding to the body's configuration at time <math>\\ t</math> is labeled <math>\\ \\kappa_t(\\mathcal B)</math>.\n\nA particular particle within the body in a particular configuration is characterized by a position vector <br />\n:<math>\\ \\mathbf x =\\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i \\mathbf e_i,</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathbf e_i</math> are the [[coordinate vector]]s in some [[frame of reference]] chosen for the problem (See figure 1). This vector can be expressed as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the particle position <math>\\mathbf X</math> in some ''reference configuration'', for example the configuration at the initial time, so that\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}=\\kappa_t(\\mathbf X).</math>\n\nThis function needs to have various properties so that the model makes physical sense. <math>\\kappa_t(\\cdot)</math> needs to be:\n* [[continuity (mathematics)|continuous]] in time, so that the body changes in a way which is realistic,\n* globally [[inverse function|invertible]] at all times, so that the body cannot intersect itself,\n* [[orientation-preserving]], as transformations which produce mirror reflections are not possible in nature.\nFor the mathematical formulation of the model, <math>\\ \\kappa_t(\\cdot)</math> is also assumed to be [[continuously differentiable|twice continuously differentiable]], so that differential equations describing the motion may be formulated.\n\n==Forces in a continuum==\n{{see also|Stress (mechanics)|Cauchy stress tensor}}\nContinuum mechanics deals with deformable bodies, as opposed to [[rigid bodies]]. A solid is a deformable body that possesses shear strength, ''sc.'' a solid can support shear forces (forces parallel to the material surface on which they act). Fluids, on the other hand, do not sustain shear forces. For the study of the mechanical behavior of solids and fluids these are assumed to be continuous bodies, which means that the matter fills the entire region of space it occupies, despite the fact that matter is made of atoms, has voids, and is discrete. Therefore, when continuum mechanics refers to a point or particle in a continuous body it does not describe a point in the interatomic space or an atomic particle, rather an idealized part of the body occupying that point.\n\nFollowing the classical dynamics of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], the motion of a material body is produced by the action of externally applied forces which are assumed to be of two kinds: surface forces <math>\\mathbf F_C</math> and body forces <math>\\mathbf F_B</math>.<ref name=Smith>Smith & Truesdell p.97</ref> Thus, the total force <math>\\mathcal F</math> applied to a body or to a portion of the body can be expressed as:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal F = \\mathbf F_B + \\mathbf F_C</math>\n\n''[[Surface forces]]'' or ''contact forces'', expressed as force per unit area, can act either on the bounding surface of the body, as a result of mechanical contact with other bodies, or on imaginary internal surfaces that bound portions of the body, as a result of the mechanical interaction between the parts of the body to either side of the surface ([[Cauchy stress tensor|Euler-Cauchy's stress principle]]). When a body is acted upon by external contact forces, internal contact forces are then transmitted from point to point inside the body to balance their action, according to [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law of motion]] of conservation of [[linear momentum]] and [[angular momentum]] (for continuous bodies these laws are called the [[Euler's laws|Euler's equations of motion]]). The internal contact forces are related to the body's [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] through [[constitutive equations]]. The internal contact forces may be mathematically described by how they relate to the motion of the body, independent of the body's material makeup.<ref>Slaughter</ref>\n\nThe distribution of internal contact forces throughout the volume of the body is assumed to be continuous. Therefore, there exists a ''contact force density'' or ''Cauchy traction field'' <ref name=Smith/> <math>\\mathbf T(\\mathbf n, \\mathbf x, t)</math> that represents this distribution in a particular configuration of the body at a given time <math>t\\,\\!</math>. It is not a vector field because it depends not only on the position <math>\\mathbf x</math> of a particular material point, but also on the local orientation of the surface element as defined by its normal vector <math>\\mathbf n</math>.<ref name=Lubliner>Lubliner</ref>\n\nAny differential area <math>dS\\,\\!</math> with normal vector <math>\\mathbf n</math> of a given internal surface area <math>S\\,\\!</math>, bounding a portion of the body, experiences a contact force <math>d\\mathbf F_C\\,\\!</math> arising from the contact between both portions of the body on each side of <math>S\\,\\!</math>, and it is given by\n\n:<math>d\\mathbf F_C= \\mathbf T^{(\\mathbf n)}\\,dS</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf T^{(\\mathbf n)}</math> is the ''surface traction'',<ref name=Liu/> also called ''stress vector'',<ref name=Wu/> ''traction'',<ref name=Fung>Fung</ref> or ''traction vector''.<ref name=Mase>Mase</ref> The stress vector is a frame-indifferent vector (see [[Cauchy stress tensor|Euler-Cauchy's stress principle]]).\n\nThe total contact force on the particular internal surface <math>S\\,\\!</math> is then expressed as the sum ([[surface integral]]) of the contact forces on all differential surfaces <math>dS\\,\\!</math>:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf F_C=\\int_S \\mathbf T^{(\\mathbf n)}\\,dS</math>\n\nIn continuum mechanics a body is considered stress-free if the only forces present are those inter-atomic forces ([[ionic bond|ionic]], [[metallic bond|metallic]], and [[van der Waals force]]s) required to hold the body together and to keep its shape in the absence of all external influences, including gravitational attraction.<ref name=Mase/><ref name=Atanackovic>Atanackovic</ref> Stresses generated during manufacture of the body to a specific configuration are also excluded when considering stresses in a body. Therefore, the stresses considered in continuum mechanics are only those produced by deformation of the body, ''sc.'' only relative changes in stress are considered, not the absolute values of stress.\n\n''[[Body forces]]'' are forces originating from sources outside of the body<ref name=Irgens>Irgens</ref> that act on the volume (or mass) of the body. Saying that body forces are due to outside sources implies that the interaction between different parts of the body (internal forces) are manifested through the contact forces alone.<ref name=Liu>Liu</ref> These forces arise from the presence of the body in force fields, ''e.g.'' [[gravitational field]] ([[gravitational force]]s) or electromagnetic field ([[electromagnetic force]]s), or from [[fictitious force|inertial forces]] when bodies are in motion. As the mass of a continuous body is assumed to be continuously distributed, any force originating from the mass is also continuously distributed. Thus, body forces are specified by vector fields which are assumed to be continuous over the entire volume of the body,<ref name=Chadwick>Chadwick</ref> ''i.e.'' acting on every point in it. Body forces are represented by a body force density <math>\\mathbf b(\\mathbf x, t)</math> (per unit of mass), which is a frame-indifferent vector field.\n\nIn the case of gravitational forces, the intensity of the force depends on, or is proportional to, the mass density <math>\\mathbf \\rho (\\mathbf x, t)\\,\\!</math> of the material, and it is specified in terms of force per unit mass (<math>b_i\\,\\!</math>) or per unit volume (<math>p_i\\,\\!</math>). These two specifications are related through the material density by the equation <math>\\rho b_i = p_i\\,\\!</math>. Similarly, the intensity of electromagnetic forces depends upon the strength ([[electric charge]]) of the electromagnetic field.\n\nThe total body force applied to a continuous body is expressed as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf F_B=\\int_V\\mathbf b\\,dm=\\int_V \\rho\\mathbf b\\,dV</math>\n\nBody forces and contact forces acting on the body lead to corresponding moments of force ([[torque]]s) relative to a given point. Thus, the total applied torque <math>\\mathcal M</math> about the origin is given by\n\n:<math>\\mathcal M= \\mathbf M_B + \\mathbf M_C</math>\n\nIn certain situations, not commonly considered in the analysis of the mechanical behavior of materials, it becomes necessary to include two other types of forces: these are ''body moments'' and ''couple stresses''<ref>Maxwell pointed out that nonvanishing body moments exist in a magnet in a magnetic field and in a dielectric material in an electric field with different planes of polarization. Fung p.76.</ref><ref>Couple stresses and body couples were first explored by Voigt and Cosserat, and later reintroduced by Mindlin in 1960 on his work for Bell Labs on pure quartz crystals. Richards p.55.</ref> (surface couples,<ref name=Irgens/> contact torques<ref name=Chadwick/>). Body moments, or body couples, are moments per unit volume or per unit mass applied to the volume of the body. Couple stresses are moments per unit area applied on a surface. Both are important in the analysis of stress for a polarized dielectric solid under the action of an electric field, materials where the molecular structure is taken into consideration (''e.g.'' bones), solids under the action of an external magnetic field, and the dislocation theory of metals.<ref name=Wu>Wu</ref><ref name=Fung/><ref name=Irgens/>\n\nMaterials that exhibit body couples and couple stresses in addition to moments produced exclusively by forces are called ''polar materials''.<ref name=Fung/><ref name=Chadwick/> ''Non-polar materials'' are then those materials with only moments of forces. In the classical branches of continuum mechanics the development of the theory of stresses is based on non-polar materials.\n\nThus, the sum of all applied forces and torques (with respect to the origin of the coordinate system) in the body can be given by\n\n:<math>\\mathcal F = \\int_V \\mathbf a\\,dm = \\int_S \\mathbf T\\,dS + \\int_V \\rho\\mathbf b\\,dV</math>\n:<math>\\mathcal M = \\int_S \\mathbf r \\times \\mathbf T\\,dS + \\int_V \\mathbf r \\times \\rho\\mathbf b\\,dV</math>\n\n==Kinematics: deformation and motion==\n[[Image:Displacement of a continuum.svg|400px|right|thumb|Figure 2. Motion of a continuum body.]]\nA change in the configuration of a continuum body results in a [[displacement field (mechanics)|displacement]]. The displacement of a body has two components: a rigid-body displacement and a [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformation]]. A rigid-body displacement consists of a simultaneous translation and rotation of the body without changing its shape or size. Deformation implies the change in shape and/or size of the body from an initial or undeformed configuration <math>\\ \\kappa_0(\\mathcal B)</math> to a current or deformed configuration <math>\\ \\kappa_t(\\mathcal B)</math> (Figure 2).\n\nThe motion of a continuum body is a continuous time sequence of displacements. Thus, the material body will occupy different configurations at different times so that a particle occupies a series of points in space which describe a pathline.\n\nThere is continuity during deformation or motion of a continuum body in the sense that:\n* The material points forming a closed curve at any instant will always form a closed curve at any subsequent time.\n* The material points forming a closed surface at any instant will always form a closed surface at any subsequent time and the matter within the closed surface will always remain within.\n\nIt is convenient to identify a reference configuration or initial condition which all subsequent configurations are referenced from. The reference configuration need not be one that the body will ever occupy. Often, the configuration at <math>\\ t=0</math> is considered the reference configuration, <math>\\ \\kappa_0 (\\mathcal B)</math>. The components <math>\\ X_i</math> of the position vector <math>\\ \\mathbf X</math> of a particle, taken with respect to the reference configuration, are called the material or reference coordinates.\n\nWhen analyzing the [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] or motion of solids, or the [[fluid mechanics|flow]] of fluids, it is necessary to describe the sequence or evolution of configurations throughout time. One description for motion is made in terms of the material or referential coordinates, called material description or Lagrangian description.\n\n===Lagrangian description===\nIn the Lagrangian description the position and physical properties of the particles are described in terms of the material or referential coordinates and time. In this case '''the reference configuration is the configuration at <math>\\ t=0</math>'''. An observer standing in the frame of reference observes the changes in the position and physical properties as the material body moves in space as time progresses. The results obtained are independent of the choice of initial time and reference configuration, <math>\\kappa_0(\\mathcal B)</math>. This description is normally used in [[solid mechanics]].\n\nIn the Lagrangian description, the motion of a continuum body is expressed by the mapping function <math>\\ \\chi(\\cdot)</math> (Figure 2),\n\n:<math>\\ \\mathbf x=\\chi(\\mathbf X, t)</math>\n\nwhich is a mapping of the initial configuration <math>\\kappa_0(\\mathcal B)</math> onto the current configuration <math>\\kappa_t(\\mathcal B)</math>, giving a geometrical correspondence between them, i.e. giving the position vector <math>\\ \\mathbf{x}=x_i\\mathbf e_i</math> that a particle <math>\\ X</math>, with a position vector <math>\\ \\mathbf X</math> in the undeformed or reference configuration <math>\\kappa_0(\\mathcal B)</math>, will occupy in the current or deformed configuration <math>\\kappa_t(\\mathcal B)</math> at time <math>\\ t</math>. The components <math>\\ x_i</math> are called the spatial coordinates.\n\nPhysical and kinematic properties <math>\\ P_{ij\\ldots}</math>, i.e. thermodynamic properties and flow velocity, which describe or characterize features of the material body, are expressed as continuous functions of position and time, i.e. <math>\\  P_{ij\\ldots}=P_{ij\\ldots}(\\mathbf X,t)</math>.\n\nThe material derivative of any property <math>\\ P_{ij\\ldots}</math> of a continuum, which may be a scalar, vector, or tensor, is the time rate of change of that property for a specific group of particles of the moving continuum body. The material derivative is also known as the ''substantial derivative'', or ''comoving derivative'', or ''convective derivative''. It can be thought as the rate at which the property changes when measured by an observer traveling with that group of particles.\n\nIn the Lagrangian description, the material derivative of <math>\\ P_{ij\\ldots}</math> is simply the partial derivative with respect to time, and the position vector <math>\\ \\mathbf X</math> is held constant as it does not change with time. Thus, we have\n\n:<math>\\ \\frac{d}{dt}[P_{ij\\ldots}(\\mathbf X,t)]=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}[P_{ij\\ldots}(\\mathbf X,t)]</math>\n\nThe instantaneous position <math>\\ \\mathbf x</math> is a property of a particle, and its material derivative is the ''instantaneous flow velocity'' <math>\\ \\mathbf v</math> of the particle. Therefore, the flow velocity field of the continuum is given by\n\n:<math>\\ \\mathbf v = \\dot{\\mathbf x} =\\frac{d\\mathbf x}{dt}=\\frac{\\partial \\chi(\\mathbf X,t)}{\\partial t} </math>\n\nSimilarly, the acceleration field is given by\n\n:<math>\\ \\mathbf a= \\dot{\\mathbf v} = \\ddot{\\mathbf x} =\\frac{d^2\\mathbf x}{dt^2}=\\frac{\\partial^2 \\chi(\\mathbf X,t)}{\\partial t^2} </math>\n\nContinuity in the Lagrangian description is expressed by the spatial and temporal continuity of the mapping from the reference configuration to the current configuration of the material points. All physical quantities characterizing the continuum are described this way. In this sense, the function <math>\\chi(\\cdot)</math> and <math>\\ P_{ij\\ldots}(\\cdot)</math> are single-valued and continuous, with continuous derivatives with respect to space and time to whatever order is required, usually to the second or third.\n\n===Eulerian description===\nContinuity allows for the inverse of <math>\\chi(\\cdot)</math> to trace backwards where the particle currently located at <math>\\mathbf x</math> was located in the initial or referenced configuration <math>\\kappa_0(\\mathcal B)</math>. In this case the description of motion is made in terms of the spatial coordinates, in which case is called the spatial description or Eulerian description, i.e. '''the current configuration is taken as the reference configuration'''.\n\nThe Eulerian description, introduced by [[d'Alembert]], focuses on the current configuration <math>\\kappa_t(\\mathcal B)</math>, giving attention to what is occurring at a fixed point in space as time progresses, instead of giving attention to individual particles as they move through space and time. This approach is conveniently applied in the study of [[fluid mechanics|fluid flow]] where the kinematic property of greatest interest is the rate at which change is taking place rather than the shape of the body of fluid at a reference time.<ref name=\"Spencer83\">{{cite book |title=Continuum Mechanics|last=Spencer|first=A.J.M.|year=1980 |publisher=Longman Group Limited (London) |isbn=0-582-44282-6|page=83 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJdfQL0rgrgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref>\n\nMathematically, the motion of a continuum using the Eulerian description is expressed by the mapping function\n\n:<math>\\mathbf X=\\chi^{-1}(\\mathbf x, t)</math>\n\nwhich provides a tracing of the particle which now occupies the position <math>\\mathbf x</math> in the current configuration <math>\\kappa_t(\\mathcal B)</math> to its original position <math>\\mathbf X</math> in the initial configuration <math>\\kappa_0(\\mathcal B)</math>.\n\nA necessary and sufficient condition for this inverse function to exist is that the determinant of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian Matrix]], often referred to simply as the Jacobian, should be different from zero.

The second term of the right-hand side is the ''convective rate of change'' and expresses the contribution of the particle changing position in space (motion).\n\nContinuity in the Eulerian description is expressed by the spatial and temporal continuity and continuous differentiability of the flow velocity field. All physical quantities are defined this way at each instant of time, in the current configuration, as a function of the vector position <math>\\ \\mathbf x</math>.\n\n===Displacement field===\nThe vector joining the positions of a particle <math>\\ P</math> in the undeformed configuration and deformed configuration is called the [[displacement (vector)|displacement vector]] <math>\\ \\mathbf u(\\mathbf X,t)=u_i\\mathbf e_i</math>, in the Lagrangian description, or <math>\\ \\mathbf U(\\mathbf x,t)=U_J\\mathbf E_J</math>, in the Eulerian description.\n \nA ''displacement field'' is a vector field of all displacement vectors for all particles in the body, which relates the deformed configuration with the undeformed configuration. It is convenient to do the analysis of deformation or motion of a continuum body in terms of the displacement field,  In general, the displacement field is expressed in terms of the material coordinates as\n\n:<math>\\ \\mathbf u(\\mathbf X,t) = \\mathbf b+\\mathbf x(\\mathbf X,t) - \\mathbf X \\qquad \\text{or}\\qquad u_i = \\alpha_{iJ}b_J + x_i - \\alpha_{iJ}X_J</math>\n\nor in terms of the spatial coordinates as\n\n:<math>\\ \\mathbf U(\\mathbf x,t) = \\mathbf b+\\mathbf x - \\mathbf X(\\mathbf x,t) \\qquad \\text{or}\\qquad U_J = b_J + \\alpha_{Ji}x_i - X_J \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\ \\alpha_{Ji}</math> are the direction cosines between the material and spatial coordinate systems with unit vectors <math>\\ \\mathbf E_J</math> and <math>\\mathbf e_i</math>, respectively. Thus\n\n:<math>\\ \\mathbf E_J \\cdot \\mathbf e_i = \\alpha_{Ji}=\\alpha_{iJ}</math>\n\nand the relationship between <math>\\ u_i</math> and <math>\\ U_J</math> is then given by\n\n:<math>\\ u_i=\\alpha_{iJ}U_J \\qquad \\text{or} \\qquad U_J=\\alpha_{Ji}u_i</math>\n\nKnowing that\n:<math>\\ \\mathbf e_i = \\alpha_{iJ}\\mathbf E_J</math>\nthen\n:<math>\\mathbf u(\\mathbf X,t)=u_i\\mathbf e_i=u_i(\\alpha_{iJ}\\mathbf E_J)=U_J\\mathbf E_J=\\mathbf U(\\mathbf x,t)</math>\n\nIt is common to superimpose the coordinate systems for the undeformed and deformed configurations, which results in <math>\\ \\mathbf b=0</math>,  and the direction cosines become [[Kronecker delta]]s, i.e.\n\n:<math>\\ \\mathbf E_J \\cdot \\mathbf e_i = \\delta_{Ji}=\\delta_{iJ}</math>\n\nThus, we have\n\n:<math>\\ \\mathbf u(\\mathbf X,t) = \\mathbf x(\\mathbf X,t) - \\mathbf X \\qquad \\text{or}\\qquad u_i = x_i - \\delta_{iJ}X_J</math>\n\nor in terms of the spatial coordinates as\n\n:<math>\\ \\mathbf U(\\mathbf x,t) = \\mathbf x - \\mathbf X(\\mathbf x,t) \\qquad \\text{or}\\qquad U_J = \\delta_{Ji}x_i - X_J </math>\n<!--\n==Fundamental laws==\n===Conservation of mass===\n===Conservation of momentum===\nP<sub>i</sub>=P<sub>f</sub>\n\n===Conservation of energy===\n-->\n\n==Governing equations==\nContinuum mechanics deals with the behavior of materials that can be approximated as continuous for certain length and time scales.  The equations that govern the mechanics of such materials include the balance laws for [[conservation of mass|mass]], [[conservation of momentum|momentum]], and [[conservation of energy|energy]]. [[Kinematic]] relations and [[constitutive equations]] are needed to complete the system of governing equations.  Physical restrictions on the form of the constitutive relations can be applied by requiring that the [[second law of thermodynamics]] be satisfied under all conditions.  In the continuum mechanics of solids, the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied if the [[Clausius\u2013Duhem inequality|Clausius\u2013Duhem]] form of the entropy inequality is satisfied.\n\nThe balance laws express the idea that the rate of change of a quantity (mass, momentum, energy) in a volume must arise from three causes:\n  \n#the physical quantity itself flows through the surface that bounds the volume,\n#there is a source of the physical quantity on the surface of the volume, or/and,\n#there is a source of the physical quantity inside the volume.\n  \nLet <math>\\Omega</math> be the body (an open subset of Euclidean space) and let   <math>\\partial \\Omega </math> be its surface (the boundary of <math>\\Omega</math>).  \n  \nLet the motion of material points in the body be described by the map\n:<math>\n    \\mathbf{x} = \\boldsymbol{\\chi}(\\mathbf{X}) = \\mathbf{x}(\\mathbf{X})\n  </math>\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{X}</math> is the position of a point in the initial configuration and <math>\\mathbf{x}</math> is the location of the same point in the deformed configuration.\n\nThe deformation gradient is given by\n:<math>\n    \\boldsymbol{F} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial \\mathbf{X}} = \\nabla \\boldsymbol{\\mathbf{x}}  ~.\n  </math>\n\n===Balance laws===\nLet <math>f(\\mathbf{x},t)</math> be a physical quantity that is flowing through the body.  Let <math>g(\\mathbf{x},t)</math> be sources on the surface of the body and let <math>h(\\mathbf{x},t)</math> be sources inside the body.  Let <math>\\mathbf{n}(\\mathbf{x},t)</math> be the outward unit normal to the surface <math>\\partial \\Omega </math>.  Let <math>\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x},t)</math> be the flow velocity of the physical particles that carry the physical quantity that is flowing.  Also, let the speed at which the bounding surface <math>\\partial \\Omega </math> is moving be <math>u_n</math> (in the direction <math>\\mathbf{n}</math>).\n\nThen, balance laws can be expressed in the general form\n:<math>\n    \\cfrac{d}{dt}\\left[\\int_{\\Omega} f(\\mathbf{x},t)~\\text{dV}\\right] = \n      \\int_{\\partial \\Omega } f(\\mathbf{x},t)[u_n(\\mathbf{x},t) - \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\cdot\\mathbf{n}(\\mathbf{x},t)]~\\text{dA} + \n      \\int_{\\partial \\Omega } g(\\mathbf{x},t)~\\text{dA} + \\int_{\\Omega} h(\\mathbf{x},t)~\\text{dV} ~.\n  </math>\nNote that the functions <math>f(\\mathbf{x},t)</math>, <math>g(\\mathbf{x},t)</math>, and <math>h(\\mathbf{x},t)</math> can be scalar valued, vector valued, or tensor valued - depending on the physical quantity that the balance equation deals with.  If there are internal boundaries in the body, jump discontinuities also need to be specified in the balance laws.\n\nIf we take the [[Eulerian]] point of view, it can be shown that the balance laws of mass, momentum, and energy for a solid can be written as (assuming the source term is zero for the mass and angular momentum equations)\n:<math>\n    {\n    \\begin{align}\n      \\dot{\\rho} + \\rho~\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} & = 0 \n          & & \\qquad\\text{Balance of Mass} \\\\\n      \\rho~\\dot{\\mathbf{v}} - \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\rho~\\mathbf{b} & = 0 \n          & & \\qquad\\text{Balance of Linear Momentum (Cauchy's first law of motion)} \\\\\n      \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} & = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^T\n          & & \\qquad\\text{Balance of Angular Momentum (Cauchy's second law of motion)} \\\\\n      \\rho~\\dot{e} - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:(\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\mathbf{v}) + \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\cdot \\mathbf{q} - \\rho~s & = 0\n          & & \\qquad\\text{Balance of Energy.}\n    \\end{align}\n    }\n  </math>\n\nIn the above equations <math>\\rho(\\mathbf{x},t)</math> is the mass density (current),   <math>\\dot{\\rho}</math> is the material time derivative of <math>\\rho</math>, <math>\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x},t)</math> is the particle velocity, <math>\\dot{\\mathbf{v}}</math> is the material time derivative of <math>\\mathbf{v}</math>, <math>\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{x},t)</math> is the [[Cauchy stress tensor]], <math>\\mathbf{b}(\\mathbf{x},t)</math> is the body force density, <math>e(\\mathbf{x},t)</math> is the internal energy per unit mass, <math>\\dot{e}</math> is the material time derivative of <math>e</math>, <math>\\mathbf{q}(\\mathbf{x},t)</math> is the heat flux vector, and <math>s(\\mathbf{x},t)</math> is an energy source per unit mass.\n  \nWith respect to the reference configuration (the Lagrangian point of view), the balance laws can be written as\n:<math>\n    {\n    \\begin{align}\n      \\rho~\\det(\\boldsymbol{F}) - \\rho_0 &= 0 & &  \\qquad \\text{Balance of Mass} \\\\\n      \\rho_0~\\ddot{\\mathbf{x}} - \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}_{\\circ}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{P}^T -\\rho_0~\\mathbf{b} & = 0  & & \n        \\qquad \\text{Balance of Linear Momentum} \\\\\n      \\boldsymbol{F}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{P}^T & = \\boldsymbol{P}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{F}^T  & & \n        \\qquad \\text{Balance of Angular Momentum} \\\\ \n      \\rho_0~\\dot{e} - \\boldsymbol{P}^T:\\dot{\\boldsymbol{F}} + \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}_{\\circ}\\cdot\\mathbf{q} - \\rho_0~s & = 0\n          & & \\qquad\\text{Balance of Energy.} \n    \\end{align}\n    }\n  </math>\n\nIn the above, <math>\\boldsymbol{P}</math> is the first [[Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor]], and   <math>\\rho_0</math> is the mass density in the reference configuration.

This inequality is a statement concerning the irreversibility of natural processes, especially when energy dissipation is involved.\n\nJust like in the balance laws in the previous section, we assume that there is a flux of a quantity, a source of the quantity, and an internal density of the quantity per unit mass.  The quantity of interest in this case is the entropy.  Thus, we assume that there is an entropy flux, an entropy source, an internal mass density <math>\\rho</math> and an internal specific entropy (i.e. entropy per unit mass) <math>\\eta</math> in the region of interest.\n\nLet <math>\\Omega</math> be such a region and let <math>\\partial \\Omega </math> be its boundary.  Then the second law of thermodynamics states that the rate of increase of  <math>\\eta</math> in this region is greater than or equal to the sum of that supplied to <math>\\Omega</math> (as a flux or from internal sources) and the change of the internal entropy density <math>\\rho\\eta</math> due to material flowing in and out of the region.\n  \nLet <math>\\partial \\Omega </math> move with a flow velocity <math>u_n</math> and let particles inside <math>\\Omega</math> have velocities <math>\\mathbf{v}</math>.  Let <math>\\mathbf{n}</math> be the unit outward normal to the surface <math>\\partial \\Omega </math>.  Let <math>\\rho</math> be the density of matter in the region, <math>\\bar{q}</math> be the entropy flux at the surface, and <math>r</math> be the entropy source per unit mass.  \nThen the entropy inequality may be written as\n:<math>\n    \\cfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} \\rho~\\eta~\\text{dV}\\right) \\ge\n    \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\rho~\\eta~(u_n - \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}) ~\\text{dA} + \n    \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\bar{q}~\\text{dA} + \\int_{\\Omega} \\rho~r~\\text{dV}.\n  </math>\nThe scalar entropy flux can be related to the vector flux at the surface by the relation <math>\\bar{q} = -\\boldsymbol{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x})\\cdot\\mathbf{n}</math>.  Under the assumption  of incrementally isothermal conditions, we have\n:<math>\n    \\boldsymbol{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\cfrac{\\mathbf{q}(\\mathbf{x})}{T} ~;~~ r = \\cfrac{s}{T}\n  </math>\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{q}</math> is the heat flux vector, <math>s</math> is an energy source per unit mass, and <math>T</math> is the absolute temperature of a material point at <math>\\mathbf{x}</math> at time <math>t</math>.\n\nWe then have the Clausius&ndash;Duhem inequality in integral form:\n:<math>\n    {\n    \\cfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\int_{\\Omega} \\rho~\\eta~\\text{dV}\\right) \\ge\n    \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\rho~\\eta~(u_n - \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}) ~\\text{dA} - \n    \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\cfrac{\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}}{T}~\\text{dA} + \\int_\\Omega \\cfrac{\\rho~s}{T}~\\text{dV}.\n    }\n  </math>\nWe can show that the entropy inequality may be written in differential form as\n:<math>\n    {\n    \\rho~\\dot{\\eta} \\ge - \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\cdot \\left(\\cfrac{\\mathbf{q}}{T}\\right)\n       + \\cfrac{\\rho~s}{T}.\n    }\n  </math>\nIn terms of the Cauchy stress and the internal energy, the Clausius&ndash;Duhem inequality may be written as \n:<math>\n    {\n      \\rho~(\\dot{e} - T~\\dot{\\eta}) - \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}:\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\mathbf{v} \\le \n           - \\cfrac{\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} T}{T}.\n    }\n  </math>\n\n==Applications==\n* [[Continuum Mechanics]]\n**[[Solid mechanics]]\n**[[Fluid mechanics]]\n* [[Engineering]]\n** [[Civil engineering]]\n** [[Mechanical engineering]]\n** [[Aerospace engineering]]\n** [[Biomedical engineering]]\n** [[Chemical engineering]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Bernoulli's principle]]\n*[[Cauchy elastic material]]\n*[[Configurational mechanics]]\n*[[Curvilinear coordinates]]\n*[[Equation of state]]\n*[[Finite deformation tensors]]\n*[[Finite strain theory]]\n*[[Hyperelastic material]]\n*[[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field]]\n*[[Movable cellular automaton]]\n*[[Peridynamics]] (a non-local continuum theory leading to integral equations)\n*[[Stress (physics)]]\n*[[Stress measures]]\n*[[Tensor calculus]]\n*[[Tensor derivative (continuum mechanics)]]\n*[[Theory of elasticity]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n<!-- Please keep these in alphabetical order. -->\n\n*{{cite book |first=R.

These may include [[custom (law)|customary law]], [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], [[statutory law]], [[precedent|judge-made law]], or [[international law|international rules and norms]]. Constitutional law deals with the fundamental principles by which the government exercises its authority. In some instances, these principles grant specific powers to the government, such as the power to tax and spend for the welfare of the population. Other times, constitutional principles act to place limits on what the government can do, such as prohibiting the arrest of an individual without sufficient cause.\n\nIn most nations, such as the [[Constitution of the United States|United States]], [[Constitution of India|India]], and [[Constitution of Singapore|Singapore]], constitutional law is based on the text of a document ratified at the time the nation came into being. Other constitutions, notably [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|that of the United Kingdom]],<ref name=Parliament>{{cite|title=Mapping the Path to Codifying - or not Codifying - the UK's Constitution|publisher=Parliament UK|first1=Andrew|last1=Blick|first2=Robert|last2=Blackburn|series=Series paper 2.

It governs the relationships between the judiciary, the legislature and the executive with the bodies under its authority. One of the key tasks of constitutions within this context is to indicate hierarchies and relationships of power. For example, in a [[unitary state]], the constitution will vest ultimate authority in one central administration and [[legislature]], and [[judiciary]], though there is often a delegation of power or authority to local or municipal authorities. When a constitution establishes a [[federal state]], it will identify the several levels of government coexisting with exclusive or shared areas of jurisdiction over lawmaking, application and enforcement. Some federal states, most notably the United States, have separate and parallel federal and state judiciaries, with each having its own hierarchy of courts with a supreme court for each state. [[Legal system of India|India]], on the other hand, has one judiciary divided into district courts, high courts, and the [[Supreme Court of India]].\n\n==Human rights==\n\n{{Main|Human rights|International human rights law}}\nHuman rights or [[civil liberties]] form a crucial part of a country's constitution and uphold the rights of the individual against the state. Most jurisdictions, like the [[United States]] and [[France]], have a codified constitution, with a [[bill of rights]]. A recent example is the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] which was intended to be included in the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]], that failed to be ratified. Perhaps the most important example is the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] under the [[UN Charter]]. These are intended to ensure basic political, social and economic standards that a nation state, or intergovernmental body is obliged to provide to its citizens but many do include its governments.\n\nSome countries like the [[United Kingdom]] have no entrenched document setting out fundamental rights; in those jurisdictions the constitution is composed of [[statute]], [[case law]] and [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]. A case named ''[[Entick v. Carrington]]''<ref>''[[Entick v. Carrington]]'' (1765) 19 Howell's State Trials 1030</ref> is a constitutional principle deriving from the common law. [[John Entick]]'s house was searched and ransacked by Sherriff Carrington. Carrington argued that a warrant from a Government minister, the [[George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Earl of Halifax]] was valid authority, even though there was no statutory provision or court order for it. The court, led by [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]] stated that,\n\n<blockquote>\"The great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all instances, where it has not been taken away or abridged by some public law for the good of the whole. By the laws of England, every invasion of private property, be it ever so minute, is a trespass... If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.constitution.org/trials/entick/entick_v_carrington.htm | title=Entick v.

Civil law jurisdictions, on the other hand, place less emphasis on judicial review and only the parliament or legislature has the power to effect law. As a result, the structure of the judiciary differs significantly between the two, with common law judiciaries being [[adversarial system|adversarial]] and civil law judiciaries being [[inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]]. Common law judicatures consequently separate the judiciary from the prosecution,<ref name=\"Hale\">{{cite book|last=Hale|first=Sandra Beatriz|title= The Discourse of Court Interpreting: Discourse Practices of the Law, the Witness and the Interpreter |publisher=John Benjamins|date=July 2004|page=31|isbn=978-1-58811-517-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HVwg_sQ5a5UC&pg=PA31&dq=%22adversarial+system%22}}</ref><ref name=\"Richards\">{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Edward P. |author2=Katharine C.

Human rights law in these countries is as a result, largely built on legal precedent in the courts' interpretation of constitutional law, whereas that of civil law countries is almost exclusively composed of codified law, constitutional or otherwise.\n\n==Legislative procedure==\n\n{{Main|Parliamentary procedure}}\nAnother main function of constitutions may be to describe the procedure by which parliaments may legislate. For instance, special majorities may be required to alter the constitution. In bicameral legislatures, there may be a process laid out for second or third readings of bills before a new law can enter into force. Alternatively, there may further be requirements for maximum terms that a government can keep power before holding an [[election]].\n\n==Study of constitutional law==\n{{Globalize|date=December 2010}}\nConstitutional law is a major focus of legal studies and research. For example, most law students in the United States are required to take a class in Constitutional Law during their first year, and several [[law journals]] are devoted to the discussion of constitutional issues.\n\n== The rule of law ==\nThe doctrine of the [[rule of law]] dictates that government must be conducted according to law. This was first established by British legal theorist [[A. V. Dicey]].\n\nDicey identified three essential elements of the British Constitution which were indicative of the rule of law:\n#Absolute supremacy of regular law as opposed to the influence of [[arbitrary power]];<ref>A. V. Dicey, ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'' (Macmillan, 10th ed, 1959) p.202</ref>\n#[[Equality before the law]];\n#The Constitution is a result of the ordinary law of the land.\n\nDicey\u2019s rule of law formula consists of three classic tenets. The first is that the regular law is supreme over arbitrary and discretionary powers. \"[N]o man is punishable ... except for a distinct breach of the law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary courts of the land.\"<ref>A. V. Dicey, ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution''  (10th ed, 1959) p.188</ref>\n\n== The separation of powers ==\nThe [[Separation of Powers]] is often regarded as a second limb functioning alongside the Rule of Law to curb the powers of the Government. In many modern nation states, power is divided and vested into three branches of government: The [[Legislature]], the [[Executive (government)|Executive]] and the [[Judiciary]]. The first and the second are harmonised in traditional [[Westminster forms of government]].<ref>W B Gwyn, The Meaning of the Separation of Powers: An Analysis of the doctrine from Its Origin to the Adoption of the United States Constitution, Tulane University (1965).</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Constitutionalism]]\n*[[Constitution]]\n*[[Constitutional economics]]\n*[[Constitutional rights]]\n*[[Philosophy of law]]\n*[[Public law]]\n*[[Rechtsstaat]]\n*[[Rule of law]]\n\n==References==\n{{Library resources box}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Cite NIE|wstitle=Constitutional Law|short=x}}\n\n{{law}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Constitutional Law}}\n[[Category:Constitutional law| ]]", "sha1": "oncyoja4h3t1uf76vvrzhk5nch11beq"}}, {"title": "Celtic languages", "ns": "0", "id": "5920", "revision": {"id": "866153173", "parentid": "866133237", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T16:44:18Z", "contributor": {"username": "Cagwinn", "id": "10519136"}, "comment": "Undid revision 866133237 by [[Special:Contributions/Melrorross|Melrorross]] ([[User talk:Melrorross|talk]]) Not a scholarly source", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2012}}\n{{Infobox language family\n| name          = Celtic\n| region        = Formerly widespread in Europe; today [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[Brittany]], [[Patagonia]], [[Nova Scotia]] and the [[Isle of Man]]\n| familycolor   = Indo-European\n| fam2 = [[North-West Indo-European]]?<ref>{{cite web |url=https://oldeuropean.org/ie/North-West_Indo-European |title=North-West Indo-European |publisher=Old European |accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://academiaprisca.org/en/resources/north-west-indo-european/ |title=North-West Indo-European |publisher=Academia Prisca |accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref>\n| fam3 = [[Italo-Celtic]]\n| protoname     = [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]]\n| child1        = [[Continental Celtic languages|Continental Celtic]] (polyphyletic, extinct)\n| child2        = [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] (Geographic)\n| child3        = [[Gallo-Brittonic languages|P-Celtic]]\n| child4        = [[Q-Celtic]]\n| child5        = [[Celtic settlement of Eastern_Europe| Eastern]]\n| iso2          = cel\n| iso5          = cel\n| lingua        = 50= (phylozone)\n| glotto        = celt1248\n| glottorefname = Celtic\n| map           = Celtic expansion in Europe.png\n| mapcaption    = Distribution of Celtic speakers: <br />\n{{legend|#ffff43|[[Hallstatt culture]] area, 6th century BC}}\n{{legend|#97ffb6|Maximal Celtic expansion, c. 275 BC}}\n{{legend|#d2ffd2|[[Lusitanians|Lusitanian]] area; Celtic affiliation unclear}}\n{{legend|#27c600|Areas where Celtic languages are widely spoken in the 21st century}}\n}}\n\n{{Indo-European topics}}\n\nThe '''Celtic languages''' ({{small|[[Pronunciation of Celtic|usually]]}} {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u025b|l|t|\u026a|k}}, {{small|but sometimes}} {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|\u025b|l|-}})<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/celtic |title=American Heritage Dictionary.

Some scholars (such as Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; and Schrijver 1995) distinguish [[Continental Celtic languages|Continental Celtic]] and [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]], arguing that the differences between the Goidelic and Brittonic languages arose after these split off from the Continental Celtic languages.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalmedievalist.com/opinionated-celtic-faqs/celtic-languages/|title=What are the Celtic Languages? \u2014 Celtic Studies Resources|work=Celtic Studies Resources|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US}}</ref> Other scholars (such as Schmidt 1988) distinguish between ''P-Celtic'' and ''Q-Celtic'', putting most of the Gaulish and Brittonic languages in the former group and the Goidelic and Celtiberian languages in the latter. The P-Celtic languages (also called [[Gallo-Brittonic]]) are sometimes seen (for example by Koch 1992) as a central innovating area as opposed to the more conservative peripheral Q-Celtic languages.\n\nThe Breton language is Brittonic, not Gaulish, though there may be some input from the latter,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Barbour and Carmichael |first=Stephen and Cathie |title=Language and nationalism in Europe |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1ixmu8Iga7gC&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=Breton+Gaulish+words&q=Breton%20Gaulish%20words |isbn=978-0-19-823671-9}}</ref> having been introduced from Southwestern regions of Britain in the post-Roman era and having evolved into Breton.\n\nIn the P/Q classification schema, the first language to split off from Proto-Celtic was Gaelic. It has characteristics that some scholars see as archaic, but others see as also being in the Brittonic languages (see Schmidt).

Proponents of each schema dispute the accuracy and usefulness of the other's categories. However, since the 1970s the division into Insular and Continental Celtic has become the more widely held view (Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; Schrijver 1995), but in the middle of the 1980s, the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic hypothesis found new supporters (Lambert 1994), because of the inscription on the Larzac piece of lead (1983), the analysis of which reveals another common phonetical innovation ''-nm-'' > ''-nu'' (Gaelic ''ainm'' / Gaulish ''anuana'', Old Welsh ''enuein'' \"names\"), that is less accidental than only one. The discovery of a third common innovation would allow the specialists to come to the conclusion of a [[Gallo-Brittonic]] dialect (Schmidt 1986; Fleuriot 1986).\n\nThe interpretation of this and further evidence is still quite contested, and the main argument in favour of Insular Celtic is connected with the development of the verbal morphology and the syntax in Irish and British Celtic, which Schumacher regards as convincing, while he considers the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic division unimportant and treats Gallo-Brittonic as an outdated hypothesis.<ref name=Schumacher>{{cite book |last1=Schumacher |first1=Stefan |last2=Schulze-Thulin |first2=Britta |last3=aan de Wiel |first3=Caroline |title=Die keltischen Prim\u00e4rverben.

It seems likely that Celtiberian split off before Cisalpine Celtic, but the evidence for this is not robust.  On the other hand, the unity of Gaulish, Goidelic, and Brittonic is reasonably secure.  Schumacher (2004, p.&nbsp;86) had already cautiously considered this grouping to be likely genetic, based, among others, on the shared reformation of the sentence-initial, fully inflecting relative pronoun ''*i\u032fos, *i\u032f\u0101, *i\u032fod'' into an uninflected enclitic particle.

This perception of color derives from the stimulation of [[cone cell]]s in the human eye by [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[visible spectrum]]. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc.\n\nBy defining a [[color space]], colors can be identified numerically by coordinates, which in 1931 were also named in global agreement with internationally agreed color names like mentioned above (red, orange, etc.) by the [[International Commission on Illumination]]. The [[RGB color space]] for instance is a color space corresponding to human [[trichromacy]] and to the three cone cell types that respond to three bands of light: long wavelengths, peaking near 564\u2013580 [[nanometre|nm]] (''red''); medium-wavelength, peaking near 534\u2013545&nbsp;nm (''green''); and short-wavelength light, near 420\u2013440&nbsp;nm (''blue'').<ref name=\"Wyszecki\">{{cite book\n| first = G\u00fcnther\n| last = Wyszecki\n|author2=Stiles, W.S.\n| year = 1982\n| title = Colour Science: Concepts and Methods, Quantitative Data and Formulae\n| edition = 2nd\n| pages =\n| publisher = Wiley Series in Pure and Applied Optics\n| location = New York\n| isbn = 0-471-02106-7\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| author = R.

When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] to 700&nbsp;nm), it is known as \"visible light\".\n\nMost light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's ''spectrum'' is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the color [[Wikt:sensation|sensation]] in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among individuals within the same species. In each such class the members are called ''[[Metamerism (color)|metamers]]'' of the color in question.\n\n=== Spectral colors ===\n\nThe familiar colors of the [[rainbow]] in the [[Optical spectrum|spectrum]]\u2014named using the [[Latin]] word for ''appearance'' or ''apparition'' by [[Isaac Newton]] in 1671\u2014include all those colors that can be produced by [[visible light]] of a single wavelength only, the [[spectral color|''pure spectral'' or ''monochromatic'' colors]]. The table at right shows approximate frequencies (in [[hertz|terahertz]]) and wavelengths (in [[nanometre|nanometers]]) for various pure spectral colors. The wavelengths listed are as measured in air or [[vacuum]] (see [[refractive index]]).\n\nThe color table should not be interpreted as a definitive list\u2014the pure spectral colors form a continuous spectrum, and how it is divided into distinct colors [[language|linguistically]] is a matter of culture and historical contingency (although people everywhere have been shown to ''perceive'' colors in the same way<ref>[[Brent Berlin|Berlin, B.]] and [[Paul Kay|Kay, P.]], ''[[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution]]'', Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], 1969.</ref>). A common list identifies six main bands: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Newton's conception included a seventh color, [[indigo]], between blue and violet. It is possible that what Newton referred to as blue is nearer to what today is known as [[cyan]], and that indigo was simply the dark blue of the [[indigo dye]] that was being imported at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Waldman|first=Gary|title=Introduction to light : the physics of light, vision, and color|year=2002|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-42118-6|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbsoAXWbnr4C&pg=PA193}}</ref>\n\nThe ''intensity'' of a spectral color, relative to the context in which it is viewed, may alter its perception considerably; for example, a low-intensity orange-yellow is [[brown]], and a low-intensity yellow-green is [[olive green]].\n\n=== Color of objects ===\n\nThe color of an object depends on both the physics of the object in its environment and the characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain. Physically, objects can be said to have the color of the light leaving their surfaces, which normally depends on the spectrum of the incident illumination and the reflectance properties of the surface, as well as potentially on the angles of illumination and viewing. Some objects not only reflect light, but also transmit light or emit light themselves, which also contributes to the color. A viewer's perception of the object's color depends not only on the spectrum of the light leaving its surface, but also on a host of contextual cues, so that color differences between objects can be discerned mostly independent of the lighting spectrum, viewing angle, etc. This effect is known as [[color constancy]].\n\n[[File:Optical grey squares orange brown.svg|right|thumb|250px|The upper disk and the lower disk have exactly the same objective color, and are in identical gray surroundings; based on context differences, humans perceive the squares as having different reflectances, and may interpret the colors as different color categories; see [[checker shadow illusion]].]]\n\nSome generalizations of the physics can be drawn, neglecting perceptual effects for now:\n* Light arriving at an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] surface is either [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] \"[[Specular reflection|specularly]]\" (that is, in the manner of a mirror), [[scattering|scattered]] (that is, reflected with diffuse scattering), or [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] \u2013 or some combination of these.\n* Opaque objects that do not reflect specularly (which tend to have rough surfaces) have their color determined by which wavelengths of light they scatter strongly (with the light that is not scattered being absorbed). If objects scatter all wavelengths with roughly equal strength, they appear white. If they absorb all wavelengths, they appear black.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pastoureau|first=Michael|title=Black: The History of a Color|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=216|isbn=978-0691139302}}</ref>\n* Opaque objects that specularly reflect light of different wavelengths with different efficiencies look like mirrors tinted with colors determined by those differences. An object that reflects some fraction of impinging light and absorbs the rest may look black but also be faintly reflective; examples are black objects coated with layers of enamel or lacquer.\n* Objects that [[Transparency and translucency|transmit light]] are either ''translucent'' (scattering the transmitted light) or ''transparent'' (not scattering the transmitted light). If they also absorb (or reflect) light of various wavelengths differentially, they appear tinted with a color determined by the nature of that absorption (or that reflectance).\n* Objects may emit light that they generate from having excited electrons, rather than merely reflecting or transmitting light. The electrons may be excited due to elevated temperature (''[[incandescence]]''), as a result of chemical reactions (''[[chemoluminescence]]''), after absorbing light of other frequencies (\"[[fluorescence]]\" or \"[[phosphorescence]]\") or from electrical contacts as in [[light emitting diodes]], or other [[list of light sources|light sources]].\n\nTo summarize, the color of an object is a complex result of its surface properties, its transmission properties, and its emission properties, all of which contribute to the mix of wavelengths in the light leaving the surface of the object. The perceived color is then further conditioned by the nature of the ambient illumination, and by the color properties of other objects nearby, and via other characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain.\n\n== Perception ==\n\n[[File:16777216colors.png|thumb|When viewed in full size, this image contains about 16 million pixels, each corresponding to a different color on the full set of RGB colors.

In 1810, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] published his comprehensive ''[[Theory of Colours|Theory of Colors]]'' in which he ascribed physiological effects to color that are now understood as psychological.\n\nIn 1801 [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] proposed his [[Trichromacy|trichromatic theory]], based on the observation that any color could be matched with a combination of three lights. This theory was later refined by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]. As Helmholtz puts it, \"the principles of Newton's law of mixture were experimentally confirmed by Maxwell in 1856. Young's theory of color sensations, like so much else that this marvelous investigator achieved in advance of his time, remained unnoticed until Maxwell directed attention to it.\"<ref>Hermann von Helmholtz, ''Physiological Optics \u2013 The Sensations of Vision'', 1866, as translated in ''Sources of Color Science'', David L. MacAdam, ed., Cambridge: [[MIT Press]], 1970.</ref>\n\nAt the same time as Helmholtz, [[Ewald Hering]] developed the [[opponent process]] theory of color, noting that [[color blindness]] and afterimages typically come in opponent pairs (red-green, blue-orange, yellow-violet, and black-white). Ultimately these two theories were synthesized in 1957 by Hurvich and Jameson, who showed that retinal processing corresponds to the trichromatic theory, while processing at the level of the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] corresponds to the opponent theory.<ref>Palmer, S.E. (1999).

Humans are [[Trichromacy|trichromatic]]\u2014the retina contains three types of color receptor cells, or [[cone cell|cones]]. One type, relatively distinct from the other two, is most responsive to light that is perceived as blue or blue-violet, with wavelengths around 450 [[nanometre|nm]]; cones of this type are sometimes called ''short-wavelength cones'', ''S cones'', or ''blue cones''. The other two types are closely related genetically and chemically: ''middle-wavelength cones'', ''M cones'', or ''green cones'' are most sensitive to light perceived as green, with wavelengths around 540&nbsp;nm, while the ''long-wavelength cones'', ''L cones'', or ''red cones'', are most sensitive to light is perceived as greenish yellow, with wavelengths around 570 &nbsp;nm.\n\nLight, no matter how complex its composition of wavelengths, is reduced to three color components by the eye. Each cone type adheres to the [[principle of univariance]], which is that each cone's output is determined by the amount of light that falls on it over all wavelengths. For each location in the visual field, the three types of cones yield three signals based on the extent to which each is stimulated. These amounts of stimulation are sometimes called ''tristimulus values''.\n\nThe response curve as a function of wavelength varies for each type of cone. Because the curves overlap, some tristimulus values do not occur for any incoming light combination. For example, it is not possible to stimulate ''only'' the mid-wavelength (so-called \"green\") cones; the other cones will inevitably be stimulated to some degree at the same time. The set of all possible tristimulus values determines the human ''color space''. It has been estimated that humans can distinguish roughly 10 million different colors.<ref name=\"business\" />\n\nThe other type of light-sensitive cell in the eye, the [[rod cell|rod]], has a different response curve. In normal situations, when light is bright enough to strongly stimulate the cones, rods play virtually no role in vision at all.<ref>\"Under well-lit viewing conditions (photopic vision), cones&nbsp; ...are highly active and rods are inactive.\" {{cite conference|last=Hirakawa |first=K. |author2=Parks, T.W. |title=Chromatic Adaptation and White-Balance Problem |conference=IEEE ICIP |year=2005 |doi=10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530559 |url=http://www.accidentalmark.com/research/papers/Hirakawa05WBICIP.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128184104/http://www.accidentalmark.com/research/papers/Hirakawa05WBICIP.pdf |archivedate=November 28, 2006 }}</ref> On the other hand, in dim light, the cones are understimulated leaving only the signal from the rods, resulting in a [[Black-and-white|colorless]] response. (Furthermore, the rods are barely sensitive to light in the \"red\" range.) In certain conditions of intermediate illumination, the rod response and a weak cone response can together result in color discriminations not accounted for by cone responses alone. These effects, combined, are summarized also in the [[Kruithof curve]], that describes the change of color perception and pleasingness of light as function of temperature and intensity.\n\n=== Color in the brain ===\n{{Main|Color vision}}\n\n[[File:Ventral-dorsal streams.svg|thumb|right|300px|The visual [[dorsal stream]] (green) and [[ventral stream]] (purple) are shown. The ventral stream is responsible for color perception.]]\n\nWhile the mechanisms of color vision at the level of the retina are well-described in terms of tristimulus values, color processing after that point is organized differently. A dominant theory of color vision proposes that color information is transmitted out of the eye by three [[opponent processes]], or opponent channels, each constructed from the raw output of the cones: a red\u2013green channel, a blue\u2013yellow channel, and a black\u2013white \"luminance\" channel. This theory has been supported by neurobiology, and accounts for the structure of our subjective color experience. Specifically, it explains why humans cannot perceive a \"reddish green\" or \"yellowish blue\", and it predicts the [[color wheel]]: it is the collection of colors for which at least one of the two color channels measures a value at one of its extremes.\n\nThe exact nature of color perception beyond the processing already described, and indeed the status of color as a feature of the perceived world or rather as a feature of our ''perception'' of the world \u2013 a type of [[qualia]] \u2013 is a matter of complex and continuing philosophical dispute.\n\n=== Nonstandard color perception ===\n\n==== Color deficiency ====\n{{Main|Color blindness}}\n\nIf one or more types of a person's color-sensing cones are missing or less responsive than normal to incoming light, that person can distinguish fewer colors and is said to be ''color deficient'' or ''[[color blindness|color blind]]'' (though this latter term can be misleading; almost all color deficient individuals can distinguish at least some colors). Some kinds of color deficiency are caused by anomalies in the number or nature of cones in the retina. Others (like ''central'' or ''cortical'' ''[[achromatopsia]]'') are caused by neural anomalies in those parts of the brain where visual processing takes place.\n\n==== Tetrachromacy ====\n{{Main|Tetrachromacy}}\n\nWhile most humans are ''trichromatic'' (having three types of color receptors), many animals, known as ''[[Tetrachromacy|tetrachromats]]'', have four types. These include some species of [[spider]]s, most [[marsupial]]s, [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s, and many species of [[fish]]. Other species are sensitive to only two axes of color or do not perceive color at all; these are called ''dichromats'' and ''monochromats'' respectively. A distinction is made between ''retinal tetrachromacy'' (having four pigments in cone cells in the retina, compared to three in trichromats) and ''functional tetrachromacy'' (having the ability to make enhanced color discriminations based on that retinal difference). As many as half of all women are retinal tetrachromats.<ref name=\"Jameson\">{{cite journal |last1= Jameson |first= K. A. |last2= Highnote |first2= S. M., |last3= Wasserman |first3= L.

Behavioral and [[functional neuroimaging]] experiments have demonstrated that these color experiences lead to changes in behavioral tasks and lead to increased activation of brain regions involved in color perception, thus demonstrating their reality, and similarity to real color percepts, albeit evoked through a non-standard route.\n\n=== Afterimages ===\n\nAfter exposure to strong light in their sensitivity range, [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] of a given type become desensitized. For a few seconds after the light ceases, they will continue to signal less strongly than they otherwise would. Colors observed during that period will appear to lack the color component detected by the desensitized photoreceptors. This effect is responsible for the phenomenon of [[afterimage]]s, in which the eye may continue to see a bright figure after looking away from it, but in a [[complementary color]].\n\nAfterimage effects have also been utilized by artists, including [[Vincent van Gogh]].\n\n=== Color constancy ===\n{{Main|Color constancy}}\n\nWhen an artist uses a limited [[color scheme|color palette]], the [[Human eye|eye]] tends to compensate by seeing any gray or neutral color as the color which is missing from the color wheel. For example, in a limited palette consisting of red, yellow, black, and white, a mixture of yellow and black will appear as a variety of green, a mixture of red and black will appear as a variety of purple, and pure gray will appear bluish.<ref>{{cite web|last=Depauw|first=Robert C.|title=United States Patent|url=http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&lr=&vid=USPAT3815265&id=tSEzAAAAEBAJ&oi=fnd&dq=mixing+paint+colors&printsec=abstract#v=onepage&q=mixing%20paint%20colors&f=false|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref><!-- not due to black pigment being dark blue therefore reflecting more blue light? This is a real physical phenomenon and not a perceptual one. Is this paragraph not irrelevant to color constancy? -->\n\nThe trichromatic theory is strictly true when the visual system is in a fixed state of adaptation. In reality, the visual system is constantly adapting to changes in the environment and compares the various colors in a scene to reduce the effects of the illumination. If a scene is illuminated with one light, and then with another, as long as the difference between the light sources stays within a reasonable range, the colors in the scene appear relatively constant to us. This was studied by [[Edwin Land]] in the 1970s and led to his retinex theory of [[color constancy]].\n\nBoth phenomena are readily explained and mathematically modeled with modern theories of chromatic adaptation and color appearance (e.g. [[CIECAM02]], iCAM).<ref name=\"CAM\">M.D. Fairchild, [http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470012161.html Color Appearance Models] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505034940/http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470012161.html |date=May 5, 2011 }}, 2nd Ed., Wiley, Chichester (2005).</ref> There is no need to dismiss the trichromatic theory of vision, but rather it can be enhanced with an understanding of how the visual system adapts to changes in the viewing environment.\n\n=== Color naming ===\n{{Main|Color term}}\n{{See also|Lists of colors|Web colors}}\n[[File:1Mcolors.png|thumb|This picture contains one million pixels, each one a different color]]\nColors vary in several different ways, including [[hue]] (shades of [[red]], [[Orange (colour)|orange]], [[yellow]], [[green]], [[blue]], and [[Violet (color)|violet]]), [[saturation (color theory)|saturation]], [[brightness]], and [[Gloss (material appearance)|gloss]]. Some color words are derived from the name of an object of that color, such as \"[[Orange (fruit)|orange]]\" or \"[[Salmon (color)|salmon]]\", while others are abstract, like \"red\".\n\nIn the 1969 study ''[[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution]]'', [[Brent Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay]] describe a pattern in naming \"basic\" colors (like \"red\" but not \"red-orange\" or \"dark red\" or \"blood red\", which are \"shades\" of red). All languages that have two \"basic\" color names distinguish dark/cool colors from bright/warm colors. The next colors to be distinguished are usually red and then yellow or green. All languages with six \"basic\" colors include black, white, red, green, blue, and yellow. The pattern holds up to a set of twelve: black, gray, white, pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, and [[azure (color)|azure]] (distinct from blue in [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], but not English).\n\n=== Associations ===\n\nIndividual colors have a variety of cultural associations such as [[national colors]] (in general described in individual color articles and [[color symbolism]]). The field of [[color psychology]] attempts to identify the effects of color on human emotion and activity. [[Chromotherapy]] is a form of [[alternative medicine]] attributed to various Eastern traditions. Colors have different associations in different countries and cultures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalization-group.com/edge/resources/color-meanings-by-culture/|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20101012003744/http://www.globalization-group.com/edge/resources/color-meanings-by-culture/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-10-12|title= Chart: Color Meanings by Culture|accessdate=2010-06-29}}</ref>\n\nDifferent colors have been demonstrated to have effects on cognition.

The outer curved boundary is the spectral (or monochromatic) locus, with wavelengths shown in nanometers. The colors depicted depend on the [[color space]] of the device on which you are viewing the image, and therefore may not be a strictly accurate representation of the color at a particular position, and especially not for monochromatic colors.]]\n\nMost light sources are mixtures of various wavelengths of light. Many such sources can still effectively produce a spectral color, as the eye cannot distinguish them from single-wavelength sources. For example, most computer displays reproduce the spectral color orange as a combination of red and green light; it appears orange because the red and green are mixed in the right proportions to allow the eye's cones to respond the way they do to the spectral color orange.\n\nA useful concept in understanding the perceived color of a non-monochromatic light source is the [[dominant wavelength]], which identifies the single wavelength of light that produces a sensation most similar to the light source. Dominant wavelength is roughly akin to [[hue]].\n\nThere are many color perceptions that by definition cannot be pure spectral colors due to [[Saturation (color theory)|desaturation]] or because they are [[purple]]s (mixtures of red and violet light, from opposite ends of the spectrum). Some examples of necessarily non-spectral colors are the achromatic colors (black, gray, and white) and colors such as [[pink]], [[Tan (color)|tan]], and [[magenta]].\n\nTwo different light spectra that have the same effect on the three color receptors in the [[human eye]] will be perceived as the same color. They are [[Metamerism (color)|metamers]] of that color. This is exemplified by the white light emitted by fluorescent lamps, which typically has a spectrum of a few narrow bands, while daylight has a continuous spectrum. The human eye cannot tell the difference between such light spectra just by looking into the light source, although reflected colors from objects can look different. (This is often exploited; for example, to make [[fruit]] or [[tomato]]es look more intensely red.)\n\nSimilarly, most human color perceptions can be generated by a mixture of three colors called ''primaries''. This is used to reproduce color scenes in photography, printing, television, and other media. There are a number of methods or [[color space]]s for specifying a color in terms of three particular primary colors. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the particular application.\n\nNo mixture of colors, however, can produce a response truly identical to that of a spectral color, although one can get close, especially for the longer wavelengths, where the [[CIE 1931 color space]] chromaticity diagram has a nearly straight edge. For example, mixing green light (530&nbsp;nm) and blue light (460&nbsp;nm) produces cyan light that is slightly desaturated, because response of the red color receptor would be greater to the green and blue light in the mixture than it would be to a pure cyan light at 485&nbsp;nm that has the same intensity as the mixture of blue and green.\n\nBecause of this, and because the ''primaries'' in [[color printing]] systems generally are not pure themselves, the colors reproduced are never perfectly saturated spectral colors, and so spectral colors cannot be matched exactly. However, natural scenes rarely contain fully saturated colors, thus such scenes can usually be approximated well by these systems. The range of colors that can be reproduced with a given color reproduction system is called the [[gamut]]. The [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] chromaticity diagram can be used to describe the gamut.\n\nAnother problem with color reproduction systems is connected with the acquisition devices, like cameras or scanners. The characteristics of the color sensors in the devices are often very far from the characteristics of the receptors in the human eye. In effect, acquisition of colors can be relatively poor if they have special, often very \"jagged\", spectra caused for example by unusual lighting of the photographed scene.\nA color reproduction system \"tuned\" to a human with normal color vision may give very inaccurate results for other observers.\n\nThe different color response of different devices can be problematic if not properly managed. For color information stored and transferred in digital form, [[color management]] techniques, such as those based on [[ICC profile]]s, can help to avoid distortions of the reproduced colors. Color management does not circumvent the gamut limitations of particular output devices, but can assist in finding good mapping of input colors into the gamut that can be reproduced.\n\n=== Additive coloring ===\n\n[[File:AdditiveColor.svg|thumb|Additive color mixing: combining red and green yields yellow; combining all three primary colors together yields white.]]\n\n[[Additive color]] is light created by mixing together [[light]] of two or more different colors. [[Red]], [[green]], and [[blue]] are the additive [[primary color]]s normally used in additive color systems such as projectors and computer terminals.\n\n=== Subtractive coloring ===\n\n[[File:SubtractiveColor.svg|thumb|Subtractive color mixing: combining yellow and magenta yields red; combining all three primary colors together yields black]]\n\n[[Subtractive color]]ing uses dyes, inks, pigments, or filters to absorb some wavelengths of light and not others. The color that a surface displays comes from the parts of the visible spectrum that are not absorbed and therefore remain visible. Without pigments or dye, fabric fibers, paint base and paper are usually made of particles that scatter white light (all colors) well in all directions. When a pigment or ink is added, wavelengths are absorbed or \"subtracted\" from white light, so light of another color reaches the eye.\n\nIf the light is not a pure white source (the case of nearly all forms of artificial lighting), the resulting spectrum will appear a slightly different color. [[Red]] paint, viewed under [[blue]] light, may appear [[black]]. Red paint is red because it scatters only the red components of the spectrum. If red paint is illuminated by blue light, it will be absorbed by the red paint, creating the appearance of a black object.\n\n=== Structural color ===\n{{further|Structural coloration|Animal coloration}}\n\nStructural colors are colors caused by interference effects rather than by pigments. Color effects are produced when a material is scored with fine parallel lines, formed of one or more parallel thin layers, or otherwise composed of microstructures on the scale of the color's [[wavelength]]. If the microstructures are spaced randomly, light of shorter wavelengths will be scattered preferentially to produce [[Tyndall effect]] colors: the blue of the sky (Rayleigh scattering, caused by structures much smaller than the wavelength of light, in this case air molecules), the luster of [[opal]]s, and the blue of human irises. If the microstructures are aligned in arrays, for example the array of pits in a CD, they behave as a [[diffraction grating]]: the grating reflects different wavelengths in different directions due to [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] phenomena, separating mixed \"white\" light into light of different wavelengths. If the structure is one or more thin layers then it will reflect some wavelengths and transmit others, depending on the layers' thickness.\n\nStructural color is studied in the field of [[thin-film optics]]. The most ordered or the most changeable structural colors are [[iridescence|iridescent]]. Structural color is responsible for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the blue jay, for example), as well as certain butterfly wings and beetle shells. Variations in the pattern's spacing often give rise to an iridescent effect, as seen in [[peacock]] feathers, [[soap bubbles]], films of oil, and [[mother of pearl]], because the reflected color depends upon the viewing angle. Numerous scientists have carried out research in butterfly wings and beetle shells, including Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke. Since 1942, [[Electron microscope|electron micrography]] has been used, advancing the development of products that exploit structural color, such as \"[[photonic]]\" cosmetics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esrc.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/about/CI/events/FSS/2006/science.aspx?ComponentId=14867&SourcePageId=14865 |title=Economic and Social Research Council \u2013 Science in the Dock, Art in the Stocks |accessdate=2007-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102025015/http://www.esrc.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/about/CI/events/FSS/2006/science.aspx?ComponentId=14867&SourcePageId=14865 |archivedate=November 2, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Additional terms ==\n* [[Color wheel]]: an illustrative organization of color hues in a circle that shows relationships.\n* [[Colorfulness]], chroma, purity, or saturation: how \"intense\" or \"concentrated\" a color is.

It states that physical computing systems are types of mechanisms that, by design, perform physical computation, or \u201cthe manipulation (by a functional mechanism) of a medium-independent vehicle according to a rule.\u201d  Medium-independence requires that the property is able to be instantiated by multiple realizers and multiple mechanisms and that the inputs and outputs of the mechanism also be [[Multiple realizability| multiply realizable]].  In short, medium-independence allows for the use of physical variables with traits other than voltage (as in typical digital computers); this is imperative in considering other types of computation, such as that occurs in the [[brain]] or in a [[quantum computer]].  A rule, in this sense, provides a mapping among inputs, outputs, and internal states of the physical computing system. <ref>{{cite book | last = Piccinini | first = Gualtiero | title = Physical Computation: A Mechanistic Account | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2015 | page = 10 | isbn = 9780199658855}}</ref>\n\n== Mathematical models ==\nIn the [[theory of computation]], a diversity of mathematical models of computers has been developed.\nTypical mathematical [[Model of computation|models of computers]] are the following:\n* State models including [[Turing machine]], [[pushdown automaton]], [[finite state automaton]], and [[Parallel random access machine|PRAM]]\n* Functional models including [[lambda calculus]]\n* Logical models including [[logic programming]]\n* Concurrent models including [[actor model]] and [[process calculi]]\nGiunti calls the models studied by computation theory ''computational systems,'' and he argues that all of them are mathematical [[dynamical system]]s with discrete time and discrete state space.<ref>{{cite book | last = Giunti | first = Marco | title = Computation, Dynamics, and Cognition | place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-19-509009-3}}</ref>{{rp|ch.1}} He maintains that a computational system is a complex object which consists  of  three  parts.

The most recognisable modern clown character is the ''[[Circus clown#The auguste|Auguste]]'' or \"red clown\" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, [[exaggerated]] footwear, and colourful clothing. Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nModern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the [[circus clown]], which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or ''Variet\u00e9'' shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.\n\nMany circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right. The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]] in the [[harlequinade]] that formed part of British [[pantomime]]s, notably at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and the [[Sadler's Wells]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as \"Joey\", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.\n\nThe [[comedy]] that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary\u2014and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition.\n\nThe \"fear of clowns,\" circus clowns in particular as a psychiatric condition has become known by the term [[coulrophobia]].<ref>{{citation |last=Crosswell |first=Julia |contribution=clown |title=Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |edition={{subscription}} online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t292.e1047 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Origin ===\nThe \"''clown''\" character developed out of the [[zanni]] \"''rustic fool''\" characters of the early modern [[commedia dell'arte]], which were themselves directly based on the \"''rustic fool''\" characters of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]].\nRustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as '' skl\u00earo-paikt\u00eas'' (from ''paizein'' \"to play (like a child)\") or ''deikeliktas'', besides other generic terms for \"rustic\" or \"peasant\". In Roman theater, a term for clown was ''fossor'', literally \"digger; labourer\".\n\nThe English word ''[[:wikt:clown|clown]]'' was first recorded c. 1560 (as ''clowne,  cloyne'') in the generic meaning  \"rustic, boor, peasant\". \nThe origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with ''clumsy''.<ref>Icelandic ''klunni'', Swedish ''kluns'' \"clumsy, boorish person\";  c.f. North Frisian  ''kl\u00f6nne'' and \"kluns\", also meaning \"clumsy person\". An alternative proposal derives ''clown'' from Latin ''colonus'' \"colonist, farmer\".\nThe verb ''to clown''  \"to play the clown onstage\" is from about 1600. {{cite web|title=Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=clown&searchmode=none|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}</ref>\nIt is in this sense that \"Clown\" is used as the name of [[Shakespearean fool|fool characters]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.\nThe sense of ''clown'' as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on [[Elizabethan theater|Elizabethan]] \"rustic fool\" characters such as Shakespeare's.\n\nThe [[harlequinade]] developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by the commedia dell'arte. It was here that \"Clown\" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for [[Harlequin]]'s slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants' garb.\n\nThe now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by [[Joseph Grimaldi]], who played Clown in [[Charles Dibdin the younger|Charles Dibdin's]] 1800 pantomime ''Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.<ref name=Neville6>Neville, pp. 6\u20137</ref><ref name=Wilkins>McConnell Stott, pp. 95\u2013100</ref>\n\n=== Modern circus clown ===\n{{main article|Circus clown}}\nThe [[circus clown]] developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from [[Philip Astley]]'s London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian [[George L. Fox (clown)|George L. Fox]] became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.\n[[Tom Belling]] senior (1843\u20131900) developed the \"red clown\" or \"Auguste\" (''Dummer August'') character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated \"white clown\". Belling worked for [[Circus Renz]] in Vienna. Belling's costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children's clown, based on a lower class or \"hobo\" character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s 1892 opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' (\"Clowns\").\nBelling's ''Auguste'' character was further popularized by [[Nicolai Poliakoff]]'s ''Coco'' in the 1920s to 1930s.\n\nThe English word ''clown'' was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, into many other languages, such as French ''clown'', Russian (and other Slavic languages) \u043a\u043b\u043e\u0301\u0443\u043d, Greek \u03ba\u03bb\u03cc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, Danish/Norwegian ''klovn'', Romanian ''clovn'' etc.\n\nItalian retains ''Pagliaccio'', a Commedia dell'arte [[zanni]] character,<ref>From ''paglia'', the word for \"straw\" (after the straw costume of the rustic buffoon character), or from ''bajaccio'' \"mocker, scoffer\".</ref> and derivations of the Italian term are found in other Romance languages, such as French ''Paillasse'', Spanish ''payaso'', Catalan/Galician ''pallasso'', Portuguese ''palha\u00e7o'', Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03c4\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2, Turkish ''palya\u00e7o'',   German ''Pajass'' (via French),<ref>Dialectal [https://digital.idiotikon.ch/idtkn/id4.htm#!page/41099/mode/1up Bajass] in ''[[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]''</ref> Yiddish \u05e4\u05bc\u05d0\u05b7\u05d9\u05d0\u05b7\u05e5  (''payats''), Russian \u043f\u0430\u044f\u0301\u0446.\n\n=== History in 20th-century North America ===\nIn the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the [[tramp]] or [[hobo]]. Examples include [[Marceline Orbes]], who performed at the [[New York Hippodrome|Hippodrome Theater]](1905), [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Tramp]]'' (1914), and [[Emmett Kelly]]'s ''Weary Willie'' based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by [[Otto Griebling]] during the 1930s to 1950s. [[Red Skelton]]'s Dodo the Clown in ''[[The Clown (1953 film)|The Clown]]'' (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, \"a funny man with a drinking problem\".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn the United States, [[Bozo the Clown]] was an influential ''Auguste'' character since the late 1950s. ''[[The Bozo Show]]'' premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. [[McDonald's]] derived its mascot clown, [[Ronald McDonald]], from the ''Bozo'' character in the 1960s. [[Willard Scott]], who had played ''Bozo'' during 1959\u20131962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald's trademark application for the character dates to 1967.\n\nBased on the ''Bozo'' template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children's parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (''Bozo''-derived) clown character with children's entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to \"[[Clown Care]]\" or \"hospital clowning\" in children's hospitals by the mid 1980s. [[Clowns of America International]] (established 1984) and [[World Clown Association]] (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.\n\nThe shift of the ''Auguste'' or \"red clown\" character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a ''Bozo''-derived standalone character in children's entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the [[evil clown]] character, the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature.<ref>A study by the [[University of Sheffield]] concluded \"that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable.\"{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7189401.stm |title=Health &#124; Hospital clown images 'too scary' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2011-07-05 }} {{cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-01-16|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7191721.stm|title=Why are clowns scary?|first=Finlo|last=Rohrer}}.

Appropriate to the character, the auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or in a costume that does not fit \u2014 either oversize or too small is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.\n\nThe auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the auguste character to perform his bidding. The auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.\n\nThe ''contra-auguste'' plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.\n\n=== Whiteface makeup ===\n{{anchor|Whiteface}}\nThere are two major types of clowns with \"whiteface\" makeup:\nThe classic \"white clown\" is derived from the [[Pierrot]] character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque ''Auguste'' types. [[Francesco Caroli]] and [[Glen Little (clown)|Glenn \"Frosty\" Little]] are examples of this type.  The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the ''[[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]]'' type, known as \"Comedy\" or \"Grotesque Whiteface\". This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. \nIn the comedic partnership of [[Abbott and Costello]], Bud Abbot would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.<ref>Tiffany McCoy, [http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html Clown Types] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026152528/http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html |date=2015-10-26 }} (2010), citing ''Strutter's Complete Guide to Clown Makeup'' (1991).</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the whiteface clown uses \"clown white\" makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible.<ref name=MCS117-118 /> In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.\n\nWhiteface makeup was originally designed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.<ref name=MCS117-118>McConnell Stott, pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nAmerica's first great whiteface clown was stage star [[George L. Fox (clown)|George \"G.L.\" Fox]]. Following English [[Joseph Grimaldi]], Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the land in the first half of the 19th century in America.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/var1993000449/PP/ \"G.L. Fox the original Humpty Dumpty\"], Library of Congress (online), accessed 24 October 2013</ref>\n\n=== Character clown ===\nThe character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or [[hobo]]. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps [[Otto Griebling]] and [[Emmett Kelly]]. [[Red Skelton]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] would all fit the definition of a character clown.\n\nThe character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.\n\n==== North American ====\nThe most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the ''hobo'', ''tramp'' or ''bum'' clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. According to American circus expert [[Hovey Burgess]], they are :\n* The Hobo: Migratory and finds work where he travels. Down on his luck but maintains a positive [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]].\n* The Tramp: Migratory and does not work where he travels. Down on his [[luck]] and depressed about his situation.\n* The Bum: Non-migratory and non-working.\n\n==== Notable clowns ====\n{{div col|colwidth=50em}}\n*[[The Joker]]\n* [[Nicolas Ferry|Bebe]]\n* [[Bobo Barnett]]\n* [[Bozo the Clown]]\n* [[Pennywise the Dancing Clown]]\n* [[Krusty the Clown]]\n* [[Charlie Cairoli]]\n* [[Vance Colvig|Vance Colvig, Jr.]]\n* [[Eric Davis (clown)|Eric Davis]]\n* [[Tom Dougherty]]\n* [[John Gilkey]]\n* [[Abe Goldstein]]<!--not the boxer-->\n* [[Poodles Hanneford]]\n* [[Geoff Hoyle]]\n* [[Clarabell the Clown|Clarabell]]\n* [[Terry Teene|Clownzo]]\n* [[Bill Irwin]]\n* [[Jef Johnson]]\n* [[Emmett Kelly]]\n* [[David Larible]]\n* [[Loonette|Loonette the Clown]]\n* [[Barry Lubin]]\n* [[Ronald McDonald]]\n* [[Yuri Nikulin]]\n* [[Bello Nock]]\n* [[Oleg Popov]]\n* [[David Shiner (clown)|David Shiner]]\n* [[Peter Shub]]\n* [[Red Skelton]]\n* [[Sol (comedian)]]\n* [[Zig and Zag (Australian performers)|Zig and Zag]]\n* [[Puddles Pity Party]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Clown organizations ==\n=== Clowns International ===\nClowns International claims to be the oldest clown society in the world. It was set up in 1946. Apart from being a membership organisation, Clowns International has set up a museum of clown memorabilia and a register of clown make-up. The latter also has a collection of full eggshells decorated as replicas of the specific clown's head.<ref>{{cite web|title=Egg Gallery|url=http://www.clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|accessdate=June 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907170445/http://clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|archivedate=September 7, 2013|df=}}</ref>\n\n=== World Clown Association ===\n{{main article|World Clown Association}}\nThe World Clown Association (WCA) is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.\n\n=== Clowns of America International ===\n{{main article|Clowns of America International}}\nClowns of America International, Inc. (COAI) is a Minnesota-based nonprofit clown arts membership organization which aims \"to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns\".\n\n== Clowning terminology ==\n\n=== Other roles and skills ===\nIn the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as [[tightrope]], [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], [[MC|Master of Ceremonies]], or ride an animal. Clowns may also \"sit in\" with the [[orchestra]]. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.\n\n=== Frameworks ===\n'''Frameworks''' are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act.<ref name=\"simplycircus.com\">{{cite web|archivedate=March 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202950/http://simplycircus.com/circus_dictionary/clowning_framework|url=http://www.simplycircus.com/Circus_Dictionary/Clowning_Framework|website=simplycircus.com|title=Clowning Framework}}</ref> Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.\n\n'''Shows''' are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entr\u00e9es, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.\n\n=== Gags, bits and business ===\n* '''Business''' \u2014 the individual motions the clown uses, often used to express the clown's character.\n* '''Gag''' \u2014 very short piece of clown comedy that, when repeated within a \"bit\" or \"routine,\" may become a ''running gag''. Gags are, loosely, the jokes clowns play on each other. A gag may have a beginning, a middle, and an end \u2014 or may not. Gags can also refer to the prop stunts/tricks or the stunts that clowns use, such as a squirting flower.\n* '''Bit''' \u2014 the clown's sketch or routine, made up of one or more \"gags\" either worked out and timed before going on stage, or impromptu bits composed of familiar improvisational material.\n\n=== Menu ===\n* '''Entr\u00e9e''' \u2014 clowning acts lasting 5\u201310 minutes. Typically made up of various gags and bits, usually within a clowning framework. Entr\u00e9es almost always end with a \"blow-off\" \u2014 the comedic ending of a show segment, \"bit,\" \"gag,\" \"stunt,\" or \"routine.\"\n* '''Side dish''' \u2014 shorter feature act. Side dishes are essentially shorter versions of the \"entr\u00e9e,\" typically lasting 1\u20133 minutes. Typically made up of various \"gags\" and \"bits,\" side dishes are usually within a clowning framework. Side dishes almost always end with a \"blow-off.\"\n\n=== Interludes ===\n\"Clown Stops\" or \"interludes\" are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few ''gags'' or several ''bits''. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called \"reprises\" or \"run-ins\" by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of \"business\" usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a [[tightrope walker]] the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the ''artiste'' by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.\n\n=== Prop stunts ===\nAmong the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the \"[[Clown car|too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car]]\" stunt; doing just about anything with a [[rubber chicken]], tripping over one's own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or \"[[Clown bicycle|clown bikes]]\". Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.\n\n== \"Clowns\" in the world's cultures ==\n{{main article|Clown society}}\n{{further information|Ritual clown|Heyoka|Trickster|Bouffon|Jester}}\n<!--\n    Arabic: \u0645\u064f\u0647\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651\u062c m (muharrij)\n    Armenian: \u056e\u0561\u0572\u0580\u0561\u056e\u0578\u0582 (ca\u0142racu)\n    Azeri: oyunbaz\n    Chinese: \u5c0f\u4e11  (xi\u01ceoch\u01d2u)\n    Faroese: \u00edspegil m \n    Finnish:   pelle \n    Hebrew: \u05dc\u05d9\u05e6\u05df   m (ley\u1e63an) \n    Hungarian: boh\u00f3c  \n    Indonesian: badut  \n    Japanese: \u30d4\u30a8\u30ed (piero), \u9053\u5316\u5e2b (\u3069\u3046\u3051\u3057, d\u014dkeshi)\n    Korean: \uc5b4\ub9bf\uad11\ub300 (ko) (eoritgwangdae), \uad11\ub300 (ko) (gwangdae), \ud53c\uc5d0\ub85c (piero)\n    Malay: badut\n    Malayalam: \u0d15\u0d4b\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d33\u0d3f   (k\u014dm\u0101\u1e37i)\n    Persian: \u062f\u0644\u0642\u06a9   (dalqak)\n    Russian:  \u0448\u0443\u0442   m (\u0161ut) \n    Swahili: mcheshi  \n-->\nIn anthropology, the term \"clown\" has been extended to comparable jester or fool characters in non-Western cultures.

A [[Heyoka]] is an individual in Native cultures who lives outside the constraints of normal cultural roles.  The Heyoka plays the role of a backwards clown, doing everything in reverse.  The Heyoka role is sometimes best filled by a [[Winkte]].\n\nMany native tribes have a history of clowning.\nThe [[Canadian Clowning]] method developed by [[Richard Pochinko]] and furthered by his former apprentice, [[Sue Morrison]], combines European and Native American clowning techniques.\n\nIn this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator's eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the [[medicine wheel]]. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology that explores their personal experiences.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nBlack and White looking sad.jpg|''[[Chuch\u00edn]]'' (Jos\u00e9 de Jesus Medrano), a famous Mexican circus clown from the late 1960s to 1984\nActor in clown costume - Weir Collection.jpg|Actor in a clown costume (c. 1870).\nSAND Maurice Masques et bouffons 05.jpg|The Italian ''Pagliacco'' of c. 1600 (Maurice Sand, ''Masques et bouffons (Comedie Italienne)'', 1860) \nPaillasse.jpg|The French ''Paillasse'' character (1885 engraving)\nJoseph-Grimaldi-head.jpg|[[Joseph Grimaldi]] as Clown, showing his own make-up design.\nArm & Hammer Brand Soda poster ca. 1900.jpg|A [[circus clown]] in an ''Arm & Hammer Brand Soda'' advertisement poster (c. 1900)\nBozo's Circus 1968.JPG|1968 postcard of the main cast of ''[[Bozo's Circus]]'' ([[WGN-TV]]); from left to right: ''Ringmaster Ned'' ([[Ned Locke]]), Mr. Bob (bandleader [[Bob Trendler]]), ''[[Bozo the Clown]]'' ([[Bob Bell (actor)|Bob Bell]]), ''Oliver O.

These have frames with relaxed geometry, protecting the rider from shocks of the road and easing steering at low speeds. Utility bicycles tend to be equipped with accessories such as mudguards, pannier racks and lights, which extends their usefulness on a daily basis. As the bicycle is so effective as a means of transportation various companies have developed methods of carrying anything from the weekly shop to children on bicycles. Certain countries rely heavily on bicycles and their culture has developed around the bicycle as a primary form of transport. In Europe, Denmark and the Netherlands have the most bicycles per capita and most often use bicycles for everyday transport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecf.com/press-corner/cycling-facts-and-figures/|title=European Cyclists' Federation \u2013 Cycling facts and figures|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120213149/http://www.ecf.com/press-corner/cycling-facts-and-figures/|archivedate=2015-11-20|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_312_en.pdf |title=This version of the web site is now archived - Cette version du site web est archiv\u00e9e. |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205185930/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_312_en.pdf |archivedate=February 5, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nRoad bikes tend to have a more upright shape and a shorter wheelbase, which make the bike more mobile but harder to ride slowly. The design, coupled with low or dropped handlebars, requires the rider to bend forward more, making use of stronger muscles (particularly the [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]]) and reducing air resistance at high speed.\n\nThe price of a new bicycle can range from US$50 to more than US$20,000 (the highest priced bike in the world is the custom Madone by [[Damien Hirst]], sold at $500,000 USD<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/stages/hirst/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120226083113/http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/stages/hirst |archivedate= February 26, 2012 |title=Trek Bicycle: The world's best bikes for road, mountain, or town |publisher=Trekbikes.com |accessdate=2012-06-06}}</ref>),<ref>{{cite web |archivedate= February 25, 2007 |url= http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-1-2-15285-1,00.html |title= Custom Bike Builders: Groupe de Tete |publisher=bicycling.com |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070225094609/http://www.bicycling.com/article/1%2C6610%2Cs1-1-2-15285-1%2C00.html }}</ref> depending on quality, type and weight (the most exotic road bicycles can weigh as little as 3.2&nbsp;kg (7&nbsp;lb)<ref>{{cite web |archivedate=November 14, 2011 |url=http://www.light-bikes.com/bikegallery/BikeListing.asp?id=1507 |title= SPIN Custom...7.04 lbs |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111114120218/http://www.light-bikes.com/bikegallery/BikeListing.asp?id=1507 }}</ref>). However, [http://www.uci.ch/Templates/UCI/UCI5/layout.asp?MenuID=MTYxNw&LangId=1 UCI] regulations stipulate a legal [[Racing bicycle|race bike]] cannot weigh less than 6.8&nbsp;kg (14.99&nbsp;lbs). Being measured for a bike and taking it for a test ride are recommended before buying.\n\nThe [[bicycle#Drivetrain and gearing|drivetrain]] components of the bike should also be considered. A middle grade [[d\u00e9railleur]] is sufficient for a beginner, although many utility bikes are equipped with [[hub gear]]s. If the rider plans a significant amount of [[hillclimbing (cycling)|hillclimbing]] a triple-chainrings [[crankset]] [[bicycle gearing|gear system]] may be preferred. Otherwise, the relatively lighter and less expensive double chainring may be better. Much simpler fixed wheel bikes are also available.\n\nMany road bikes, along with mountain bikes, include [[clipless pedal]]s to which special shoes attach, via a [[cleat (shoe)|cleat]], enabling the rider to pull on the pedals as well as push. Other possible accessories for the bicycle include front and rear lights, [[Bicycle bell|bells]] or horns, child carrying seats, cycling computers with GPS, locks, bar tape, fenders (mud-guards), baggage racks, baggage carriers and pannier bags, water bottles and bottle cages.\n\nFor basic maintenance and repairs cyclists can carry a [[bicycle pump|pump]] (or a [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub> cartridge]]), a puncture repair kit, a spare inner tube, and [[tire levers]] and a set of [[allen keys]]. Cycling can be more efficient and comfortable with special [[cycling shoe|shoes]], [[cycling gloves|gloves]], and [[cycling shorts|shorts]]. In wet weather, riding can be more tolerable with waterproof clothes, such as cape, jacket, trousers (pants) and overshoes and high-visibility clothing is advisable to reduce the risk from motor vehicle users.\n\nItems legally required in some jurisdictions, or voluntarily adopted for safety reasons, include [[bicycle helmet]]s,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.yescycling.com/bicycle-helmet-laws-in-the-us/|title=Bicycle Helmet Laws In The US - The Complete List - Yes Cycling|date=2017-03-25|work=Yes Cycling|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-GB}}</ref> generator or battery operated lights, [[retroreflector|reflectors]], and audible signalling devices such as a bell or horn. Extras include [[studded tires]] and a [[cyclocomputer|bicycle computer]].\n\nBikes can also be heavily customized, with different seat designs and handle bars, for example.\n\n==Skills==\nMany schools and police departments run educational programs to instruct children in bicycle handling skills and introduce them to the [[Traffic#Rules of the road|rules of the road]] as they apply to cyclists. In different countries these may be known as [[bicycle rodeo]]s or operated as schemes such as [[Bikeability]]. Education for adult cyclists is available from organizations such as the [[League of American Bicyclists]].\n\nBeyond simply riding, another skill is riding efficiently and safely in traffic. One popular approach to riding in [[motor vehicle]] traffic is [[vehicular cycling]], occupying road space as car does. Alternately, in countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands, where cycling is popular, cyclists are often segregated into bike lanes at the side of, or more often separate from, main highways and roads. Many primary schools participate in the national road test in which children individually complete a circuit on roads near the school while being observed by testers.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{See also|Cycling infrastructure}}\n[[File:Bicycle Parking Lot Niigata.jpg|thumb|A parking lot for bicycles in [[Niigata, Niigata]], Japan.|alt=Hundreds of bicycles, grouped in rectangular parking places with driving paths in between.]]\n[[File:Cambridge CMS Bicycle Racks.jpg|thumb|[[Bicycle stand]]s outside the Centre for Mathematical Sciences at the [[University of Cambridge]]. Many students at the university opt to travel by bicycle.]]\nCyclists, pedestrians and motorists make different demands on road design which may lead to conflicts. Some jurisdictions give priority to motorized traffic, for example setting up one-way street systems, free-right turns, high capacity roundabouts, and [[interchange (road)|slip roads]]. Others share priority with cyclists so as to encourage more cycling by applying varying combinations of [[traffic calming]] measures to limit the impact of motorized transport, and by building [[bike lane]]s, [[bike path]]s and [[cycle track]]s.\n\nIn jurisdictions where motor vehicles were given priority, cycling has tended to decline while in jurisdictions where cycling infrastructure was built, cycling rates have remained steady or increased. Occasionally, extreme measures against cycling may occur. In Shanghai, where bicycles were once the dominant [[mode of transport]], bicycle travel on a few city roads was banned temporarily in December 2003.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3303655.stm</ref>\n\nIn areas in which cycling is popular and encouraged, cycle-parking facilities using [[bicycle stand]]s, lockable mini-garages, and patrolled cycle parks are used in order to reduce theft. Local governments promote cycling by permitting bicycles to be carried on public transport or by providing external [[Bicycle carrier|attachment devices]] on public transport vehicles. Conversely, an absence of secure cycle-parking is a recurring complaint by cyclists from cities with low [[modal share]] of cycling.\n\nExtensive cycling infrastructure may be found in some cities. Such dedicated paths in some cities often have to be shared with in-line skaters, scooters, skateboarders, and pedestrians. Dedicated cycling infrastructure is treated differently in the [[bikeway and legislation|law]] of every jurisdiction, including the question of liability of users in a collision. There is also some debate about the [[bikeway safety|safety]] of the various types of separated facilities.\n\nBicycles are considered a sustainable mode of transport, especially suited for urban use and relatively shorter distances when used for transport (compared to recreation). Case studies and good practices (from European cities and some worldwide examples) that promote and stimulate this kind of functional cycling in cities can be found at [[Eltis]], Europe's portal for local transport.\n\nA number of cities, including Paris, London and [[Bicing|Barcelona]], now have successful [[bicycle sharing|bike hire schemes]] designed to help people cycle in the city. Typically these feature utilitarian city bikes which lock into docking stations, released on payment for set time periods. Costs vary from city to city. In London, initial hire access costs \u00a32 per day. The first 30 minutes of each trip is free, with \u00a32 for each additional 30 minutes until the bicycle is returned.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/santander-cycles\n | title = Santander Cycles: London's self-service, bike-sharing scheme\n | website =tfl.gov.uk\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 26 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Utrecht-IMG 7481.JPG|thumb|The safe physically separated ''Fietspad'' in the Netherlands, keeping cyclists away from traffic as seen in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].]]\n\nIn the Netherlands, many roads have one or two separate [[cycleway]]s alongside them, or cycle lanes marked on the road. On roads where adjacent bike paths or cycle tracks exist, the use of these facilities is compulsory, and cycling on the main carriageway is not permitted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004825/HoofdstukII/i1/Artikel5/geldigheidsdatum_01-10-2012|title=wetten.nl  - Wet- en regelgeving - Reglement verkeersregels en verkeerstekens 1990 (RVV 1990) - BWBR0004825|work=overheid.nl}}</ref> Some 35,000&nbsp;km of cycle-track has been physically segregated from motor traffic,<ref name=\"fietsberaad\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fietsberaad.nl/index.cfm?lang=nl&section=nieuws&mode=newsArticle&repository=The+Netherlands+boast+almost+35.000+km+of+cycling+paths|title=The Netherlands boast almost 35.000 km of cycling paths|work=fietsberaad.nl}}</ref><ref>[https://www.cbs.nl/NR/rdonlyres/9F9F3F71-9324-46D3-AD7E-076C59F8392D/0/2015factsheetnederlandfietsland_ENG.pdf Factsheet The Netherlands: cycling country \u2014 [[Statistics Netherlands|CBS]]]</ref> equal to a quarter of the country's entire 140,000&nbsp;km road network.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2085.html#nl |title=CIA World Factbook &#124; Field listing: Roadways  |date=2014 |website=www.cia.gov |publisher=U.S. Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Utility===\n[[File:coconut bunch.jpg|thumb|A bicycle loaded with [[tender coconut]]s for sale.

The British [[Royal Mail]] first started using bicycles in 1880; now bicycle delivery fleets include 37,000 in the UK, 25,700 in Germany, 10,500 in Hungary and 7000 in Sweden. In Australia, Australia Post has also reintroduced bicycle postal deliveries on some routes due to an inability to recruit sufficient licensed riders willing to use their uncomfortable motorbikes. The [[London Ambulance Service]] has recently introduced bicycling [[paramedic]]s, who can often get to the scene of an incident in [[Central London]] more quickly than a motorized ambulance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/calling_999/who_will_treat_you/single_responder/cycle_responder.aspx |title=Cycle Responder |work=London Ambulance Service |publisher=London Ambulance Service NHS Trust |accessdate=2016-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402031208/http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/calling_999/who_will_treat_you/single_responder/cycle_responder.aspx |archivedate=2016-04-02 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe use of [[Police bicycle|bicycles by police]] has been increasing, since they provide greater accessibility to bicycle and pedestrian zones and allow access when roads are  congested.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last =Rantatalo\n | first =Oscar\n | title =Using police bicycle patrols to manage social order in bicycle and pedestrian traffic networks \n | journal =The Police Journal\n | volume =89\n | issue =1\n | pages =18\u201330\n | publisher =SAGE Journals\n | date =March 2016\n | url =http://pjx.sagepub.com/content/89/1/18.short\n | doi =10.1177/0032258X16639426 }}</ref>\n\nBicycles enjoy substantial use as general delivery vehicles in many countries. In the UK and North America, as their first jobs, generations of teenagers have worked at delivering newspapers by bicycle. London has many delivery companies that use bicycles with trailers. Most cities in the West, and many outside it, support a sizeable and visible industry of [[Bicycle messenger|cycle couriers]] who deliver documents and small packages. In India, many of Mumbai's [[Dabbawala]]s use bicycles to deliver home cooked lunches to the city\u2019s workers. In [[Bogot\u00e1]], Colombia the city\u2019s largest bakery recently replaced most of its delivery trucks with bicycles. Even the car industry uses bicycles. At the huge [[Mercedes-Benz]] factory in [[Sindelfingen]], Germany workers use bicycles, color-coded by department, to move around the factory.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Recreational===\n\n====Bicycle touring====\n{{Main article|Bicycle touring}}\n[[File:WhiteBikesVeluwe.jpg|thumb|In the Netherlands, bicycles are freely available for use in the [[Hoge Veluwe National Park]].|alt=A white bicycle parked in the grass.]] [[File:Bikes in Portland.jpg|thumb|Tour de Fat group ride in [[Portland, Oregon]]|alt=Many bicyclists with colorful clothes]]\n\nBicycles are used for recreation at all ages. [[Bicycle touring]], also known as cyclotourism, involves touring and exploration or sightseeing by bicycle for leisure. A [[brevet (cycling)|brevet]] or randonn\u00e9e is an organized long-distance ride.\n\nOne popular Dutch pleasure is the enjoyment of relaxed cycling in the [[rural|countryside]] of the Netherlands. The land is very flat and full of public [[bike path|bicycle trails]] and [[cycle track]]s where cyclists are not bothered by cars and other traffic, which makes it ideal for cycling recreation. Many [[Dutch people]] subscribe every year to an event called ''[[fietsvierdaagse]]''&nbsp;\u2014 four days of organised cycling through the local environment. [[Paris\u2013Brest\u2013Paris]] (PBP), which began in 1891, is the oldest bicycling event still run on a regular basis on the open road, covers over {{convert|1200|km|0|abbr=on}} and imposes a 90-hour time limit. Similar if smaller institutions exist in many countries.\n\n====Organized rides====\nMany [[cycling club]]s hold organized rides in which bicyclists of all levels participate. The typical organized ride starts with a large group of riders, called the mass, bunch or even [[peloton]]. This will thin out over the course of the ride. Many riders choose to ride together in groups of the same skill level to take advantage of [[drafting (racing)|drafting]].\n\nMost organized rides, for example [[cyclosportive]]s (or gran fondos), [[Challenge riding|Challenge Rides]] or [[reliability trial]]s, and [[Hillclimbing (cycling)|hill climbs]] include registration requirements and will provide information either through the mail or online concerning start times and other requirements. Rides usually consist of several different routes, sorted by mileage, and with a certain number of rest stops that usually include refreshments, first aid and maintenance tools. Routes can vary by as much as {{convert|100|mi|km}}.\n\n====Mountain====\n[[Mountain biking]] began in the 1970s, originally as a downhill sport, practised on customized [[cruiser bicycle]]s around [[Mount Tamalpais]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sonic.net/~ckelly/Seekay/clunker.htm |title=Clunkers Among the Hills |publisher=Sonic.net |accessdate=2012-06-06}}</ref> Most mountain biking takes place on dirt roads, trails and in purpose-built parks. Downhill mountain biking has just evolved in the recent years and is performed at places such as Whistler Mountain Bike Park. Slopestyle, a form of downhill, is when riders do tricks such as tailwhips, 360s, backflips and front flips.\nThere are several disciplines of mountain biking besides downhill. Cross country, often referred to as XC, all mountain, trail, free ride, and newly popular enduro.\n\n====Other====\nThe [[Marching and Cycling Band HHK]] from [[Haarlem]] (the Netherlands) is one of the few marching bands around the world which also performs on bicycles.\n\n===Racing===\n[[File:Leon Georget 1909.jpg|thumb|Bicycle racing in 1909.|alt=A black-and-white picture of a man on an old bicycle. Another man is holding or pushing the bicycle.]]\n[[File:Peloton on GGB.jpg|thumb|A [[peloton]] of professional bicycle racers on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]|alt=A group of bicyclist following a car.]]\n\n{{Main article|Cycle sport}}\nShortly after the introduction of bicycles, competitions developed independently in many parts of the world. Early races involving [[Boneshaker (bicycle)|boneshaker]] style bicycles were predictably fraught with injuries. Large races became popular during the 1890s \"Golden Age of Cycling\", with events across Europe, and in the U.S. and Japan as well. At one point, almost every major city in the US had a [[velodrome]] or two for [[Track cycling|track racing]] events, however since the middle of the 20th century cycling has become a minority sport in the US whilst in Continental Europe it continues to be a major sport, particularly in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Italy and Spain. The most famous of all bicycle races is the [[Tour de France]]. This began in 1903, and continues to capture the attention of the sporting world.\n\nIn 1899, [[Charles Minthorn Murphy]] became the first man to ride his bicycle a mile in under a minute (hence his nickname, Mile-a-Minute Murphy), which he did by drafting a [[locomotive]] at [[New York (state)|New York]]'s [[Long Island]].\n\nAs the bicycle evolved its various forms, different racing formats developed. Road races may involve both team and individual competition, and are contested in various ways. They range from the one-day road race, [[criterium]], and time trial to multi-stage events like the Tour de France and its sister events which make up cycling's [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]]. [[Recumbent bicycle]]s were banned from bike races in 1934 after Marcel Berthet set a new [[hour record]] in his ''Velodyne streamliner'' (49.992&nbsp;km on November 18, 1933). [[Track bicycle]]s are used for [[track cycling]] in [[Velodrome]]s, while [[cyclo-cross]] races are held on outdoor terrain, including pavement, grass, and mud. Cyclocross races feature man-made features such as small barriers which riders either [[Bunny hop (cycling)|bunny hop]] over or dismount and walk over. [[Individual time trial|Time trial]] races, another form of road racing require a rider to ride against the clock. Time trials can be performed as a team or as a single rider. Bikes are changed for time trial races, using [[aero bars]]. In the past decade, [[mountain biking|mountain bike racing]] has also reached international popularity and is even an Olympic sport.\n\nProfessional racing organizations place limitations on the bicycles that can be used in the races that they sanction. For example, the Union Cycliste Internationale, the governing body of international cycle sport (which sanctions races such as the Tour de France), decided in the late 1990s to create additional rules which prohibit racing bicycles weighing less than 6.8 kilograms (14.96 pounds). The UCI rules also effectively ban some [[bicycle frame]] innovations (such as the [[recumbent bicycle]]) by requiring a double triangle structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldsite.uci.ch/english/about/rules/ch01_general.pdf |format=PDF|title=UCI Cycling Regulations |accessdate=2006-08-04 |author=Union Cycliste International |year=2003 }}</ref>\n\n===War===\n{{Main article|Bicycle infantry}}\nThe bicycle has been used as a method of reconnaissance as well as transporting soldiers and supplies to combat zones. In this it has taken over many of the functions of [[horses in warfare]]. In the [[Second Boer War]], both sides used bicycles for scouting. In World War I, France, Germany, Australia and New Zealand used bicycles to move troops. In its 1937 invasion of China, Japan employed some 50,000 bicycle troops, and similar forces were instrumental in Japan's [[Malayan Campaign|march or \"roll\" through Malaya]] in [[World War II]]. Germany used bicycles again in World War II, while the British employed airborne \"Cycle-commandos\" with [[folding bike]]s.\n\nIn the [[Vietnam War]], communist forces used bicycles extensively as cargo carriers along the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]].\n\nThe last country known to maintain a regiment of bicycle troops was Switzerland, which disbanded its last unit in 2003.\n\n==Activism==\nTwo broad and correlated themes run in bicycle activism: one is about advocating the bicycle as an alternative mode of transport, and the other is about the creation of conditions to permit and/or encourage bicycle use, both for utility and recreational cycling.<ref>{{cite book |title=One Less Car: Bicycling and the Politics of Automobility |url=http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/1899_reg.html |last=Furness |first=Zack |year=2010 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-1-59213-613-1}}</ref> Although the first, which emphasizes the potential for energy and resource conservation and health benefits gained from cycling versus automobile use, is relatively undisputed, the second is the subject of much debate.\n\n[[File:Critical Mass, San Francisco, April 29, 2005.jpg|thumb|San Francisco [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]], April 29, 2005.|alt=Many cyclists on a road, all going in the same direction.]]\n\nIt is generally agreed that improved local and [[inter-city rail]] services and other methods of mass transportation (including greater provision for cycle carriage on such services) create conditions to encourage bicycle use. However, there are different opinions on the role of various types of [[cycling infrastructure]] in building [[bicycle-friendly]] cities and roads.\n\nSome bicycle activists (including some traffic management advisers) seek the construction of [[bike path]]s, [[cycle track]]s and [[bike lane]]s for journeys of all lengths and point to their success in promoting [[bike safety|safety]] and encouraging more people to cycle. Some activists, especially those from the [[vehicular cycling]] tradition, view the safety, practicality, and intent of such facilities with suspicion. They favor a more holistic approach based on [[Traffic psychology#Accident prevention and improvement of traffic safety|the 4 'E's]]; ''education'' (of everyone involved), ''encouragement'' (to apply the education), ''enforcement'' (to protect the rights of others), and ''engineering'' (to facilitate travel while respecting every person's equal right to do so). Some groups offer [[Vehicular cycling#Education|training courses]] to help cyclists integrate themselves with other traffic.\n\n[[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] is an event typically held on the last Friday of every month in [[city|cities]] around the world where bicyclists take to the streets ''en masse''. While the ride was founded with the idea of drawing attention to how unfriendly the city was to bicyclists, the leaderless structure of Critical Mass makes it impossible to assign it any one specific goal. In fact, the purpose of Critical Mass is not formalized beyond the [[direct action]] of meeting at a set location and time and traveling as a group through city streets.\n\nThere is a long-running [[Bicycle helmet#Opinions for and against the use of helmets|cycle helmet debate]] among activists. The most heated controversy surrounds the topic of [[Bicycle helmet#Legislation and culture|compulsory helmet use]].\n\n==Associations==\n[[File:World Cycling Centre - Aigle Switzerland.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] in Switzerland]]\nCyclists form associations, both for specific interests (trails development, road maintenance, bike maintenance, urban design, racing clubs, touring clubs, etc.) and for more global goals ([[energy conservation]], pollution reduction, promotion of fitness). Some bicycle clubs and national associations became prominent advocates for improvements to roads and highways. In the United States, the [[League of American Wheelmen]] lobbied for the improvement of roads in the last part of the 19th century, founding and leading the national [[Good Roads Movement]]. Their model for political organization, as well as the paved roads for which they argued, facilitated the growth of the automobile.\n\nAs a sport, cycling is governed internationally by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] in Switzerland, [[USA Cycling]] (merged with the United States Cycling Federation in 1995) in the United States, (for [[upright bicycle]]s) and by the [[International Human Powered Vehicle Association]] (for other HPVs, or human-powered vehicles). Cycling for transport and touring is promoted on a European level by the [[European Cyclists' Federation]], with associated members from Great Britain, Japan and elsewhere. Regular conferences on cycling as transport are held under the auspices of [[Velo City]]; global conferences are coordinated by Velo Mondial.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.velomondial.net\n| title = Velo Mondial: The premier global sustainable mobility and cycling network\n| accessdate = 2010-04-29\n| deadurl = yes\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100423080541/http://www.velomondial.net/\n| archivedate = 2010-04-23\n| df = \n}}</ref>\n\n==Health effects==\n\nThe health benefits of cycling outweigh the risks, when cycling is compared to a sedentary lifestyle.

In this regard, cycling is especially helpful for those with [[arthritis]] of the lower limbs who are unable to pursue sports that cause impact to the knees and other joints. Since cycling can be used for the practical purpose of transportation, there can be less need for self-discipline to exercise.\n\nCycling while seated is a relatively non-[[weight bearing]] exercise that, like [[Human swimming#As recreation and exercise|swimming]], does little to promote bone density.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00198-003-1418-z |pmid=12856112 |title=Low bone mineral density in highly trained male master cyclists |journal=Osteoporosis International |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=644\u20139 |year=2003 |last1=Palmer |first1=Jacob E. |last2=Levy |first2=Susan S. |last3=Nichols |first3=Jeanne F. }}</ref> Cycling up and out of the saddle, on the other hand, does a better job by transferring more of the rider's body weight to the legs.

For example, while the above representative formulas would seem to capture the commonly known carbohydrates, ubiquitous and abundant carbohydrates often deviate from this. For example, carbohydrates often display chemical groups such as: ''N''-acetyl (e.g. chitin), sulphate (e.g. glycosaminoglycans), carboxylic acid (e.g. sialic acid) and deoxy modifications (e.g. fucose and sialic acid).\n\nNatural saccharides are generally built of simple carbohydrates called [[monosaccharide]]s with general formula (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>''n''</sub> where ''n'' is three or more. A typical monosaccharide has the structure H\u2013(CHOH)<sub>''x''</sub>(C=O)\u2013(CHOH)<sub>''y''</sub>\u2013H, that is, an [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]] with many [[hydroxyl]] groups added, usually one on each [[carbon]] [[atom]] that is not part of the aldehyde or ketone [[functional group]]. Examples of monosaccharides are [[glucose]], [[fructose]], and [[glyceraldehyde]]s. However, some biological substances commonly called \"monosaccharides\" do not conform to this formula (e.g. [[uronic acid]]s and deoxy-sugars such as [[fucose]]) and there are many chemicals that do conform to this formula but are not considered to be monosaccharides (e.g. formaldehyde CH<sub>2</sub>O and [[inositol]] (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>).<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Matthews CE, Van Holde KE, Ahern KG | year = 1999 | title = Biochemistry | edition = 3rd | publisher = Benjamin Cummings | isbn = 0-8053-3066-6 }}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[open-chain]] form of a monosaccharide often coexists with a [[heterocyclic compound|closed ring form]] where the [[aldehyde]]/[[ketone]] [[carbonyl]] group carbon (C=O) and hydroxyl group (\u2013OH) react forming a [[hemiacetal]] with a new C\u2013O\u2013C bridge.\n\nMonosaccharides can be linked together into what are called [[polysaccharide]]s (or [[oligosaccharide]]s) in a large variety of ways. Many carbohydrates contain one or more modified monosaccharide units that have had one or more groups replaced or removed.

If the carbonyl group is an [[aldehyde]], the monosaccharide is an [[aldose]]; if the carbonyl group is a [[ketone]], the monosaccharide is a [[ketose]]. Monosaccharides with three carbon atoms are called [[triose]]s, those with four are called [[tetrose]]s, five are called [[pentose]]s, six are [[hexose]]s, and so on.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Neil A.| first2 = Brad | last2 = Williamson | first3 = Robin J. | last3 = Heyden | name-list-format = vanc | title = Biology: Exploring Life|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2006|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=|url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html|isbn=0-13-250882-6}}</ref> These two systems of classification are often combined. For example, [[glucose]] is an [[aldohexose]] (a six-carbon aldehyde), [[ribose]] is an [[aldopentose]] (a five-carbon aldehyde), and [[fructose]] is a [[ketohexose]] (a six-carbon ketone).\n\nEach carbon atom bearing a [[hydroxyl group]] (-OH), with the exception of the first and last carbons, are [[Chirality (chemistry)|asymmetric]], making them [[Stereogenic|stereo center]]s with two possible configurations each (R or S). Because of this asymmetry, a number of [[isomer]]s may exist for any given monosaccharide formula. Using [[Le Bel-van't Hoff rule]], the aldohexose D-glucose, for example, has the formula (C\u00b7H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>, of which four of its six carbons atoms are stereogenic, making D-glucose one of 2<sup>4</sup>=16 possible [[stereoisomer]]s. In the case of [[glyceraldehyde]]s, an aldotriose, there is one pair of possible stereoisomers, which are [[enantiomers]] and [[epimer]]s. [[Dihydroxyacetone|1, 3-dihydroxyacetone]], the ketose corresponding to the aldose glyceraldehydes, is a symmetric molecule with no stereo centers. The assignment of D or L is made according to the orientation of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl group: in a standard Fischer projection if the hydroxyl group is on the right the molecule is a D sugar, otherwise it is an L sugar. The \"D-\" and \"L-\" prefixes should not be confused with \"d-\" or \"l-\", which indicate the direction that the sugar  [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotates]] plane [[Polarization (waves)|polarized light]].

The resulting possible pair of stereoisomers is called [[anomer]]s. In the ''\u03b1 anomer'', the -OH substituent on the anomeric carbon rests on the opposite side ([[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]) of the ring from the CH<sub>2</sub>OH side branch. The alternative form, in which the CH<sub>2</sub>OH substituent and the anomeric hydroxyl are on the same side (cis) of the plane of the ring, is called the ''\u03b2 anomer''.\n\n===Use in living organisms===\nMonosaccharides are the major source of fuel for [[metabolism]], being used both as an energy source ([[glucose]] being the most important in nature) and in [[biosynthesis]]. When monosaccharides are not immediately needed by many cells they are often converted to more space-efficient forms, often [[polysaccharide]]s. In many animals, including humans, this storage form is [[glycogen]], especially in liver and muscle cells. In plants, [[starch]] is used for the same purpose. The most abundant carbohydrate, [[cellulose]], is a structural component of the [[cell wall#plant cell walls|cell wall]] of plants and many forms of algae. [[Ribose]] is a component of [[RNA]]. [[Deoxyribose]] is a component of [[DNA]]. [[Lyxose]] is a component of lyxoflavin found in the human heart.<ref>{{cite web|title=lyxoflavin|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/lyxoflavin|publisher=Merriam-Webster}}</ref> [[Ribulose]] and [[xylulose]] occur in the [[pentose phosphate pathway]]. [[Galactose]], a component of milk sugar [[lactose]], is found in [[galactolipid]]s in [[cell membrane#lipids|plant cell membranes]] and in [[glycoprotein]]s in many [[biological tissue|tissues]]. [[Mannose]] occurs in human metabolism, especially in the [[glycosylation]] of certain proteins. [[Fructose]], or fruit sugar, is found in many plants and in humans, it is metabolized in the liver, absorbed directly into the intestines during [[digestion]], and found in [[semen]]. [[Trehalose]], a major sugar of insects, is rapidly hydrolyzed into two glucose molecules to support continuous flight.\n\n==Disaccharides==\n[[Image:sucrose 3Dprojection.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Sucrose]], also known as table sugar, is a common disaccharide. It is composed of two monosaccharides: [[glucose|D-glucose]] (left) and [[fructose|D-fructose]] (right).]]\n{{Main|Disaccharide}}\nTwo joined monosaccharides are called a [[disaccharide]] and these are the simplest polysaccharides. Examples include [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]. They are composed of two monosaccharide units bound together by a [[covalent]] bond known as a [[glycosidic linkage]] formed via a [[dehydration reaction]], resulting in the loss of a [[hydrogen]] atom from one monosaccharide and a [[hydroxyl group]] from the other. The [[chemical formula|formula]] of unmodified disaccharides is C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>. Although there are numerous kinds of disaccharides, a handful of disaccharides are particularly notable.\n\n[[Sucrose]], pictured to the right, is the most abundant disaccharide, and the main form in which carbohydrates are transported in plants. It is composed of one [[glucose|D-glucose]] molecule and one [[fructose|D-fructose]] molecule. The [[systematic name]] for sucrose, ''O''-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyl-(1\u21922)-D-fructofuranoside, indicates four things:\n* Its monosaccharides: glucose and fructose\n* Their ring types: glucose is a [[pyranose]] and fructose is a [[furanose]]\n* How they are linked together: the oxygen on carbon number 1 (C1) of \u03b1-D-glucose is linked to the C2 of D-fructose.\n* The ''-oside'' suffix indicates that the [[anomeric carbon]] of both monosaccharides participates in the glycosidic bond.\n\n[[Lactose]], a disaccharide composed of one [[galactose|D-galactose]] molecule and one [[glucose|D-glucose]] molecule, occurs naturally in mammalian milk. The [[systematic name]] for lactose is ''O''-\u03b2-D-galactopyranosyl-(1\u21924)-D-glucopyranose. Other notable disaccharides include [[maltose]] (two D-glucoses linked \u03b1-1,4) and cellulobiose (two D-glucoses linked \u03b2-1,4). Disaccharides can be classified into two types: reducing and non-reducing disaccharides. If the functional group is present in bonding with another sugar unit, it is called a reducing disaccharide or biose.\n\n==Nutrition==\n{{undue weight|date=June 2015}}\n[[Image:Wheat products.jpg|thumb|[[cereal|Grain]] products: rich sources of carbohydrates]]\n\nCarbohydrate consumed in food yields 3.87 kilocalories of energy per [[gram]] for simple sugars,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/6202|title=Show Foods|work=usda.gov}}</ref> and 3.57 to 4.12 kilocalories per gram for complex carbohydrate in most other foods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5022e/y5022e04.htm|title=Calculation of the Energy Content of Foods \u2013 Energy Conversion Factors|work=fao.org}}</ref> Relatively high levels of carbohydrate are associated with processed foods or refined foods made from plants, including sweets, cookies and candy, table sugar, honey, soft drinks, breads and crackers, jams and fruit products, pastas and breakfast cereals.

Glucose is a nearly universal and accessible source of energy. Many organisms also have the ability to metabolize other [[monosaccharide]]s and [[disaccharide]]s but glucose is often metabolized first. In ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', for example, the [[lac operon]] will express enzymes for the digestion of lactose when it is present, but if both lactose and glucose are present the ''lac'' operon is repressed, resulting in the glucose being used first (see: [[Diauxie]]). [[Polysaccharide]]s are also common sources of energy. Many organisms can easily break down starches into glucose; most organisms, however, cannot metabolize [[cellulose]] or other polysaccharides like [[chitin]] and [[arabinoxylans]]. These carbohydrate types can be metabolized by some bacteria and protists. [[Ruminant]]s and [[termite]]s, for example, use microorganisms to process cellulose. Even though these complex carbohydrates are not very digestible, they represent an important dietary element for humans, called [[dietary fiber]].

This confusion persists as today some nutritionists use the term complex carbohydrate to refer to any sort of digestible saccharide present in a whole food, where fiber, vitamins and minerals are also found (as opposed to processed carbohydrates, which provide energy but few other nutrients). The standard usage, however, is to classify carbohydrates chemically: simple if they are sugars ([[monosaccharide]]s and [[disaccharide]]s) and complex if they are [[polysaccharide]]s (or [[oligosaccharide]]s).<ref name=NutSource>{{cite web|title=Carbohydrates|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/|work=The Nutrition Source|publisher=Harvard School of Public Health|access-date=April 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn any case, the simple vs. complex chemical distinction has little value for determining the nutritional quality of carbohydrates.<ref name=NutSource /> Some simple carbohydrates (e.g. [[fructose]]) raise blood glucose slowly, while some complex carbohydrates (starches), especially if processed, raise blood sugar rapidly.

''Virginia'' was one of the participants in the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]], opposing the [[Union Navy|Union's]] {{USS|Monitor}} in March 1862. The battle is chiefly significant in naval history as the first battle between [[ironclad warship|ironclads]].\n\n==USS ''Merrimack'' becomes CSS ''Virginia''==\nWhen the Commonwealth of [[Virginia]] seceded from the [[United States|Union]] in 1861, one of the important federal military bases threatened was Gosport Navy Yard (now [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]]) in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]]. Accordingly, orders were sent to destroy the base rather than allow it to fall into [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] hands. On the afternoon of 17 April, the day [[Virginia]] seceded, Engineer in Chief [[Benjamin F. Isherwood|B. F. Isherwood]] managed to get the frigate's engines lit. However, the previous night secessionists had sunk lightboats between [[Craney Island (Virginia)|Craney Island]] and [[Sewell's Point]], blocking the channel. On 20 April, before evacuating the Navy Yard, the U. S. Navy burned ''Merrimack'' to the waterline and sank her to preclude capture. When the Confederate government took possession of the fully provisioned yard, the base's new commander, [[Flag Officer]] [[French Forrest]], contracted on May 18 to [[marine salvage|salvage]] the wreck of the frigate. This was completed by May 30, and she was towed into the shipyard's only [[graving dock]], (today known as [[Drydock Number One, Norfolk Naval Shipyard|Drydock Number One]]), where the burned structures were removed.<ref>Quarstein, pp. 62\u201363</ref>\n\nThe wreck was surveyed and her lower hull and machinery were discovered to be undamaged. [[Stephen Mallory]], [[Confederate States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] decided to convert ''Merrimack'' into an [[ironclad warship|ironclad]], since she was the only large ship with intact engines available in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] area. Preliminary sketch designs were submitted by [[Lieutenant]]s [[John Mercer Brooke]] and [[John L. Porter]], each of whom envisaged the ship as a casemate ironclad. Brooke's general design showed the bow and stern portions submerged, and his design was the one finally selected. The detailed design work would be completed by Porter, who was a trained [[Naval architecture|naval constructor]]. Porter had overall responsibility for the conversion,<ref>Egan, pp. 373, 376</ref> but Brooke was responsible for her iron plate and heavy ordnance, while William P. Williamson, Chief Engineer of the Navy, was responsible for the ship's machinery.<ref>Quarstein, p. 65</ref>\n\n===Reconstruction as an ironclad===\n[[File:Mariners Museum 2007 015a.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Cut away view showing the {{convert|4|in|0}} of iron armor and {{convert|24|in|0}} of wood backing it]]\nThe hull's burned timbers were cut down past the vessel's original waterline, leaving just enough clearance to accommodate her large, twin-bladed [[screw propeller]]. A new [[Poop deck|fantail]] and armored casemate were built atop a new main deck, and a v-shaped [[glossary of nautical terms|breakwater]] (bulwark) was added to her bow, which attached to the armored casemate. This forward and aft main deck and fantail were designed to stay submerged and were covered in {{convert|4|in|cm|adj=mid|-thick|0}} iron plate, built up in two layers. The casemate was built of {{convert|24|in|cm|0}} of oak and pine in several layers, topped with two {{convert|2|in|0|adj=on}} layers of iron plating oriented perpendicular to each other, and angled at 36 degrees from horizontal to deflect fired enemy shells.\n\nFrom reports in Northern newspapers, ''Virginia''{{'}}s designers were aware of the Union plans to build an ironclad and assumed their similar ordnance would be unable to do much serious damage to such a ship. It was decided to equip their ironclad with a [[naval ram|ram]], an anachronism on a 19th century warship.<ref>deKay, p. 131</ref> ''Merrimack'''s steam engines, now part of ''Virginia'', were in poor working order; they had been slated for replacement when the decision was made to abandon the Norfolk naval yard. The salty [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] water and the addition of tons of iron armor and [[pig iron]] ballast, added to the hull's unused spaces for needed stability after her initial refloat, and to submerge her unarmored lower eves, only added to her engines' propulsion issues. As completed, ''Virginia'' had a turning radius of about {{convert|1|mi}} and required 45 minutes to complete a full circle, which would later prove to be a major handicap in battle with the far more nimble ''Monitor''.<ref>http://www.rpi.edu/~fiscap/history_files/monitor.htm</ref>\n\n[[File:Remodeling the Merrimac.jpg|thumb|right|''Merrimack'' is rebuilt into ''Virginia'']]\nThe ironclad's casemate had 14 [[gun port]]s, three each in the bow and stern, one firing directly along the ship's centerline, the two others angled at 45\u00b0 from the center line; these six bow and stern gun ports had exterior iron shutters installed to protect their cannon. There were four gun ports on each [[broadside]]; their protective iron shutters remained uninstalled during both days of the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]]. ''Virginia''{{'}}s battery consisted of four [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] single-banded [[Brooke rifle]]s and six [[smoothbore]] {{convert|9|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[Dahlgren gun]]s salvaged from the old ''Merrimack''. Two of the rifles, the bow and stern [[pivot gun]]s, were {{convert|7|in|0|adj=on}} [[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] and weighed {{convert|14500|lb}} each. They fired a {{convert|104|lb|adj=on}} [[shell (projectile)|shell]]. The other two were {{convert|6.4|in|adj=on|0}} cannon of about {{convert|9100|lb}},<ref>Olmsted, et al., pp. 125\u201327</ref> one on each broadside. The 9-inch Dahlgrens were mounted three to a side; each weighed approximately {{convert|9200|lb}} and could fire a {{convert|72.5|lb|1|adj=on}} shell up to a range of {{convert|3357|yd}} at an elevation of 15\u00b0.<ref>Olmsted, et al., p. 87</ref> Both amidship Dahlgrens nearest the boiler furnaces were fitted-out to fire [[heated shot]]. On her upper casemate deck were positioned two anti-boarding/personnel [[12-pounder]] [[Howitzer]]s.\n\n''Virginia''{{'}}s commanding officer, [[Flag Officer]] [[Franklin Buchanan]], arrived to take command only a few days before her first sortie; the ironclad was placed in commission and equipped by her [[executive officer]], [[Lieutenant]] [[Catesby ap Roger Jones]].\n\n==Battle of Hampton Roads==\n[[File:The Monitor and Merrimac.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Chromolithography|Chromolithograph]] depicting the Battle of Hampton Roads]]\n{{Main|Battle of Hampton Roads}}\nThe Battle of Hampton Roads began on March 8, 1862, when ''Virginia'' engaged the blockading Union fleet. Despite an all-out effort to complete her, the new ironclad still had workmen on board when she sailed into Hampton Roads with her [[flotilla]] of five [[Confederate States Navy|CSN]] support ships: ''[[CSS Raleigh (1861)|Raleigh]]'' (serving as ''Virginia''{{'}}s tender) and ''[[CSS Beaufort|Beaufort]]'', ''[[CSS Patrick Henry|Patrick Henry]]'', ''[[CSS Jamestown|Jamestown]]'', and ''[[CSS Teaser|Teaser]]''.\n\n[[File:Cumberland rammed by Merrimac.png|thumb|left|CSS ''Virginia'' ramming and sinking USS ''Cumberland'']]\nThe first Union ship to be engaged by ''Virginia'' was the all-wood, sail-powered [[USS Cumberland (1842)|USS ''Cumberland'']], which was first crippled during a furious cannon exchange, and then rammed in her forward starboard bow by ''Virginia''. As ''Cumberland'' began to sink, the port side half of ''Virginia''{{'}}s iron ram was broken off, causing a bow leak in the ironclad. Seeing what had happened to ''Cumberland'', the captain of [[USS Congress (1841)|USS ''Congress'']] ordered his frigate into shallower water, where she soon grounded. ''Congress'' and ''Virginia'' traded cannon fire for an hour, after which the badly-damaged ''Congress'' finally surrendered. While the surviving crewmen of ''Congress'' were being ferried off the ship, a Union battery on the north shore opened fire on ''Virginia''. Outraged at such a breach of war protocol, in retaliation ''Virginia''{{'}}s now angry captain, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] Franklin Buchanan, gave the order to open fire with [[Heated shot|hot-shot]] on the surrendered ''Congress'' as he rushed to ''Virginia''{{'}}s exposed upper casemate deck, where he was injured by enemy rifle fire. ''Congress'', now set ablaze by the retaliatory shelling, burned for many hours into the night, a symbol of Confederate naval power and a costly wake-up call for the all-wood Union blockading squadron.\n\n''Virginia'' did not emerge from the battle unscathed, however. Her hanging port side anchor was lost after ramming ''Cumberland''; the bow was leaking from the loss of the ram's port side half; shot from ''Cumberland'', ''Congress'', and the shore-based Union batteries had riddled her smokestack, reducing her boilers' draft and already slow speed; two of her broadside cannon (without shutters) were put out of commission by shell hits; a number of her armor plates had been loosened; both of ''Virginia''{{'}}s {{convert|22|ft|adj=on}} [[cutter (boat)|cutters]] had been shot away, as had both 12 pounder anti-boarding/anti-personnel howitzers, most of the deck [[stanchions]], [[railings]], and both flagstaffs. Even so, the now injured Buchanan ordered an attack on [[USS Minnesota (1855)|USS ''Minnesota'']], which had run aground on a sandbar trying to escape ''Virginia''. However, because of the ironclad's {{convert|22|ft|m|adj=on}} [[draft (hull)|draft]] (fully loaded), she was unable to get close enough to do any significant damage. It being late in the day, ''Virginia'' retired from the conflict with the expectation of returning the next day and completing the destruction of the remaining Union blockaders.\n\nLater that night, USS ''[[USS Monitor|Monitor]]'' arrived at Union-held [[Fort Monroe]]. She had been rushed to [[Hampton Roads]], still not quite complete, all the way from the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], in hopes of defending the force of wooden ships and preventing \"the rebel monster\" from further threatening the Union's blockading fleet and nearby cities, like [[Washington, D.C.]] While under tow, she nearly [[shipwreck (accident)|foundered]] twice during heavy storms on her voyage south, arriving in Hampton Roads by the bright firelight from the still-burning triumph of ''Virginia''{{'}}s first day of handiwork.\n\nThe next day, on March 9, 1862, the world's first battle between ironclads took place. The smaller, nimbler, and faster ''Monitor'' was able to outmaneuver the larger, slower ''Virginia'', but neither ship proved able to do any severe damage to the other, despite numerous shell hits by both combatants, many fired at virtually point-blank range. ''Monitor'' had a much lower freeboard and only its single, rotating, two-cannon gun turret and forward [[pilothouse]] sitting above her deck, and thus was much harder to hit with ''Virginia''{{'}}s heavy cannon. After hours of shell exchanges, ''Monitor'' finally retreated into shallower water after a direct shell hit to her armored pilothouse forced her away from the conflict to assess the damage. The captain of the ''Monitor'', Lieutenant [[John L. Worden]], had taken a direct gunpowder explosion to his face and eyes, blinding him, while looking through the pilothouse's narrow, horizontal viewing slits. ''Monitor'' remained in the shallows, but as it was late in the day, ''Virginia'' steamed for her home port, the battle ending without a clear victor: The captain of ''Virginia'' that day, Lieutenant [[Catesby ap Roger Jones]], received advice from his pilots to depart over the sandbar toward Norfolk until the next day. Lieutenant Jones wanted to continue the fight, but the pilots emphasized that the ''Virginia'' had \"nearly three miles to run to the bar\" and that she could not remain and \"take the ground on a falling tide.\" To prevent running aground, Lieutenant Jones reluctantly moved the ironclad back toward port.<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/cssvirginia.htm The Sailors Creed<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ''Virginia'' retired to the Gosport Naval Yard at Portsmouth, Virginia, and remained in drydock for repairs until April 4, 1862.\n\nIn the following month, the crew of ''Virginia'' were unsuccessful in their attempts to break the Union blockade. The blockade had been bolstered by the hastily ram-fitted paddle steamer [[USS Vanderbilt (1862)|SS ''Vanderbilt'']],<ref>T.J. Stiles, \"The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt\" (2009).</ref> and SS ''Illinois'' as well as the {{SS |Arago|1855|6}} and [[USS Minnesota (1855)|USS ''Minnesota'']], which had been repaired. ''Virginia'' made several sorties back over to Hampton Roads hoping to draw ''Monitor'' into battle. ''Monitor'', however, was under strict orders not to re-engage; the two combatants would never battle again.\n\nOn April 11, the Confederate Navy sent Lieutenant [[Joseph Nicholson Barney]], in command of the paddle side-wheeler [[CSS Jamestown|CSS ''Jamestown'']], along with ''Virginia'' and five other ships in full view of the Union squadron, enticing them to fight.<ref>[http://www.navyandmarine.org/ondeck/1862services_of_virginia.htm C.A.R. Jones, ''Services of the Virginia''(1883)]</ref> When it became clear that Union Navy ships were unwilling to fight, the [[James River Squadron|CS Navy squadron]] moved in and captured three merchant ships, the brigs ''Marcus'' and ''Sabout'' and the schooner ''Catherine T. Dix''. Their ensigns were then hoisted \"Union-side down\" to further taunt the Union Navy into a fight, as they were towed back to Norfolk, with the help of [[CSS Raleigh (1861)|CSS ''Raleigh'']].\n\nBy late April, the new Union ironclads [[USS Naugatuck (1844)|USRC ''E. A. Stevens'']] and [[USS Galena (1862)|USS ''Galena'']] had also joined the blockade. On May 8, 1862, ''Virginia'' and the [[James River Squadron]] ventured out when the Union ships began shelling the Confederate fortifications near Norfolk, but the Union ships retired under the shore batteries on the north side of the James River and on [[Rip Raps]] island.\n\n===Destruction of CSS ''Virginia''===\n[[File:Destruction of Merrimac, May 11, 1862.png|thumb|284px|alt=Print: Destruction of the rebel vessel \"Merrimac\" off Crany Island; published by Currier and Ives|''Destruction of the rebel vessel ''Merrimac'' off Craney Island, May 11, 1862,'' by [[Currier and Ives]] ]]\n\nOn May 10, 1862, advancing Union troops occupied [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]. Since ''Virginia'' was now a steam-powered heavy battery and no longer an ocean-going cruiser, her pilots judged her not seaworthy enough to enter the Atlantic, even if she were able to pass the Union blockade. ''Virginia'' was also unable to retreat further up the [[James River]] due to her deep {{convert|22|ft|m|adj=on}} draft (fully loaded). In an attempt to reduce it, supplies and coal were dumped overboard, even though this exposed the ironclad's unarmored lower hull; this was still not enough to make a difference. Without a home port and no place to go, ''Virginia''{{'}}s new captain, [[flag officer]] [[Josiah Tattnall]], reluctantly ordered her destruction in order to keep the ironclad from being captured. This task fell to Lieutenant Jones, the last man to leave ''Virginia'' after her cannon had been safely removed and carried to the Confederate Marine Corps base and fortifications at [[Drewry's Bluff]]. Early on the morning of May 11, 1862, off [[Craney Island (Virginia)|Craney Island]], fire and powder trails reached the ironclad{{'}}s magazine and she was destroyed by a great explosion. What remained of the ship settled to the bottom of the harbor; however, ''Virginia''{{'}}s thirteen-star [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Stars and Bars]] [[battle ensign]] was saved from destruction and today resides in the collection of the [[Chicago History Museum]], minus three of its original stars. Only a few remnants of ''Virginia'' have been recovered for preservation in museums; reports from the era indicate that her wreck was heavily salvaged following the war.\n\n''Monitor'' was lost on December 31 of the same year, when the vessel was swamped by high waves in a violent storm while under tow by the tug [[USS Rhode Island (1860)|USS ''Rhode Island'']] off [[Cape Hatteras]], North Carolina. Sixteen of her 62-member crew were either lost overboard or went down with the ironclad, while many others were saved by lifeboats sent from ''Rhode Island''. Subsequently, in August 1973, the wreckage was located on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean about 16 nautical miles (30&nbsp;km; 18&nbsp;mi) southeast of Cape Hatteras. Her upside-down turret was raised from beneath her deep, [[capsized]] wreck years later with the remains of two of her crew still aboard; they were later buried with full military honors on March 8, 2013, at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in Washington, D.C.\n\n==Historical names: ''Merrimack'', ''Virginia'', ''Merrimac''==\nAlthough the Confederacy renamed the ship, she is still frequently referred to by her Union name. When she was first commissioned into the United States Navy in 1856, her name was ''Merrimack,'' with the ''K''; the name was derived from the [[Merrimack River]] near where she was built. She was the second ship of the U. S. Navy to be named for the Merrimack River, which is formed by the [[confluence]] of the [[Pemigewasset River|Pemigewasset]] and [[Winnipesaukee River|Winnipesaukee]] rivers at [[Franklin, New Hampshire]]. The Merrimack flows south across [[New Hampshire]], then eastward across northeastern [[Massachusetts]] before finally emptying in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] at [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]].\n\nAfter raising, restoration, and outfitting as an ironclad warship, the Confederacy bestowed on her the name ''Virginia''. Nonetheless, the Union continued to refer to the Confederate ironclad by either its original name, ''Merrimack'', or by the nickname \"The Rebel Monster\". In the aftermath of the Battle of Hampton Roads, the names ''Virginia'' and ''Merrimack'' were used interchangeably by both sides, as attested to by various newspapers and correspondence of the day. Navy reports and pre-1900 historians frequently misspelled the name as \"Merrimac\", which was actually an unrelated ship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/our-collections/photography/numerical-list-of-images/nhhc-series/nh-series/NH-91000/NH-91880-KN.html|title=Battle of the Monitor and the Merrimack C.S.S.

In 1878, the United States Supreme Court, in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'', decreed that \"religious duty\" to engage in plural marriage was not a valid defense to prosecutions for violating state laws against polygamy. Conflict between Mormons and the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] escalated to the point that, in 1890, Congress disincorporated the LDS Church and seized most of its assets. Soon thereafter, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|manifesto]] that officially suspended the practice.<ref>{{lds|Official Declaration \u2014|od|1}}</ref> Although this manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, so that families would not be split apart or damaged, no new polygamous marriages would be performed.

Smith]] again [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before the [[United States Congress]] and issued a \"[[Second Manifesto]]\", calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease, as they were already against church doctrine since Woodruff issued the Manifesto.

The most authoritative sources of theology are the faith's canon of four religious texts, called the \"[[standard works]]\". Included in the standard works are the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. The Book of Mormon is said by the church to be \"Another Testament of Jesus Christ\" that Smith translated from buried [[golden plates]]. The LDS Church believes that the [[Angel Moroni]] told Smith about these golden plates and guided him to find them buried in the [[Hill Cumorah]]. The church believes that this Angel Moroni is at least partial fulfillment of Revelation 14:6 in the Bible. The church characterizes the Book of Mormon as \"the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of [the] religion\".<ref>{{citation |title= [[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]] |volume= 4 |page= 461}}</ref>\n\nThe Bible, also part of the church's canon, is believed to be \"the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.\"<ref>{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}: \"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.\"</ref> Most often, the church uses the [[Authorized King James Version]]. Sometimes, however, parts of the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]] (corrections and restorations of assertedly damaged or lost passages) are considered authoritative. Some excerpts of Smith's translation have been included in the Pearl of Great Price, which also includes further translations by Smith and church historical items. Other historical items and revelations are found in the Doctrine and Covenants.\n\nAnother source of authoritative doctrine is the pronouncements of the current Apostles and members of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]]. The church teaches that the First Presidency (the church's president and his counselors) and the Quorum of Twelve Apostles are prophets<ref name=\"oct12_conference\">{{Citation |title= The Sustaining of Church Officers |first= Henry B. |last= Eyring |authorlink= Henry B.

According to these doctrines, every human spirit is a literal child of a [[God the Father|Heavenly Father]], and each has the potential to continue to learn, grow, and progress in the eternities, eventually achieving eternal life (which Latter-day Saints view as distinct from [[immortality]]), which is to become one with God in the same way that [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] is one with the Father, thus allowing the children of God to become divine beings or \"gods\" themselves.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=74}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51254902|title=The Divinization of the Christian according to the Greek Fathers|last=Gross|first=Jules|last2=|date=2002|publisher=A & C Press|year=|isbn=0736316000|edition= 1st|location=Anaheim, Calif.|page=|pages=|translator-last=Onica|translator-first=Paul|trans-title=|trans-chapter=|oclc=51254902}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vii.i.html|title=Irenaeus: Against Heresies|last=Irenaeus|first=|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 5, Preface|trans-chapter=|author-link=Irenaeus}}</ref> This view on the doctrine of [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]] is also referred to as becoming a \"joint-heir with Christ.\"<ref name=\"EoM Godhood\">{{cite encyclopedia |last= Carter |first= K.

However, they tend to disagree to varying degrees with the LDS Church concerning doctrine and church leadership.\n\nThe main branches of the Latter Day Saint movement resulted from the crisis of succession upon the death of Joseph Smith.

Among these guidelines are instructions prohibiting the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, tea, and improper drug use.<ref name = wordofwisdom/> As a result of members adhering to the Word of Wisdom, areas of the world with a high concentration of LDS members practice these restrictions.

In the late&nbsp;1820s, criticism centered around the claim by Joseph Smith to have been led to a set of gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was reputedly translated.\n\nIn the 1830s, the greatest criticism was for Smith's handling of a [[Kirtland Safety Society|banking failure]] in Kirtland, Ohio. After the Mormons migrated west, there was fear and suspicion about the LDS Church's political and military power in Missouri, culminating in the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] and the infamous Mormon Extermination Order (Missouri Executive Order 44) by Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]].  In the 1840s, criticism of the church centered on its [[theodemocracy|theocratic]] aspirations in Nauvoo, Illinois. Criticism of the practice of [[plural marriage]] and other doctrines taught by Smith were published in the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]].'' Opposition led to a series of events culminating in [[Death of Joseph Smith|murder of Smith and his brother while jailed]] in 1844.\n[[File:Prop8templeProtest.jpg|thumb|left|Protesters in front of the [[Newport Beach California Temple]] voicing their opposition to the church's support of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Prop 8]]]]\n\nAs the church began openly practicing [[plural marriage]] under [[Brigham Young]] during the second half of the 19th century, the church became the target of nationwide criticism for that practice, as well as for the church's theocratic aspirations in the Utah Territory. Beginning in 1857, the church also came under [[Mountain Meadows massacre and the media|significant media criticism]] after the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] in southern Utah.\n\nAcademic critics have questioned the legitimacy of Smith as a prophet as well as the [[Criticism of the Book of Mormon|historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Abraham]]. Criticism has expanded to include claims of historical revisionism, homophobia, racism, and sexist policies. Notable 20th-century critics include [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] and historian [[Fawn Brodie]]. [[Evangelical Christians]] continue to argue that Smith was either fraudulent or [[delusion]]al.\n\n[[Mormon apologetics]] organizations, such as the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] (FAIR) and the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), have been founded to counter these criticisms. Most of the apologetic work focuses on providing and discussing evidence supporting the claims of Smith and the Book of Mormon.

Starting from the first and second laws of thermodynamics, four equations called the \"fundamental equations of Gibbs\" can be derived.  From these four, a multitude of equations, relating the thermodynamic properties of the [[thermodynamic system]] can be derived using relatively simple mathematics.

Willard Gibbs]] - founder of ''chemical thermodynamics'']]\nIn 1865, the German physicist [[Rudolf Clausius]], in his ''Mechanical Theory of Heat'', suggested that the principles of [[thermochemistry]], e.g. the [[heat]] evolved in [[Combustion|combustion reactions]], could be applied to the principles of [[thermodynamics]].<ref>Clausius, R. (1865). ''The Mechanical Theory of Heat \u2013 with its Applications to the Steam Engine and to Physical Properties of Bodies.'' London: John van Voorst, 1 Paternoster Row. MDCCCLXVII.</ref>  Building on the work of Clausius, between the years 1873-76 the American mathematical physicist [[Willard Gibbs]] published a series of three papers, the most famous one being the paper ''[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]''.  In these papers, Gibbs showed how the first two [[laws of thermodynamics]] could be measured graphically and mathematically to determine both the [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] of chemical reactions as well as their tendencies to occur or proceed.  Gibbs\u2019 collection of papers provided the first unified body of thermodynamic theorems from the principles developed by others, such as Clausius and [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]].\n\nDuring the early 20th century, two major publications successfully applied the principles developed by Gibbs to chemical processes, and thus established the foundation of the science of chemical thermodynamics.  The first was the 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Merle Randall]].  This book was responsible for supplanting the [[chemical affinity]] with the term [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] in the English-speaking world.  The second was the 1933 book ''Modern Thermodynamics by the methods of Willard Gibbs'' written by [[E. A. Guggenheim]].  In this manner, Lewis, Randall, and Guggenheim are considered as the founders of modern chemical thermodynamics because of the major contribution of these two books in unifying the application of [[thermodynamics]] to [[chemistry]].<ref name=\"Book1\" />\n\n== Overview ==\nThe primary objective of chemical thermodynamics is the establishment of a criterion for the determination of the feasibility or [[spontaneous process|spontaneity]] of a given transformation.<ref>Klotz, I. (1950). ''Chemical Thermodynamics.'' New York: Prentice-Hall, Inc.</ref> In this manner, chemical thermodynamics is typically used to predict the [[energy]] exchanges that occur in the following processes:\n#[[Chemical reaction]]s\n#[[Phase changes]]\n#The formation of [[solutions]]\n\nThe following [[state function]]s are of primary concern in chemical thermodynamics:\n\n*[[Internal energy]] (''U'')\n*[[Enthalpy]] (''H'')\n*[[Entropy]] (''S'')\n*[[Gibbs free energy]] (''G'')\n\nMost identities in chemical thermodynamics arise from application of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, particularly the [[Conservation of energy|law of conservation of energy]], to these state functions.\n\n'''The 3 laws of thermodynamics''':\n#The energy of the universe is constant.\n#In any spontaneous process, there is always an increase in entropy of the universe\n#The entropy of a perfect crystal(well ordered) at 0 Kelvin is zero\n\n==Chemical energy==\n{{Main|Chemical energy}}\n'''Chemical energy''' is the potential of a [[chemical substance]] to undergo a transformation through a [[chemical reaction]] or to transform other chemical substances. Breaking or making of chemical bonds involves [[energy]] or heat, which may be either absorbed or evolved from a chemical system.\n\nEnergy that can be released (or absorbed) because of a reaction between a set of chemical substances is equal to the difference between the energy content of the products and the reactants. This change in energy is called the change in [[internal energy]] of a chemical reaction. Where <math>\\Delta_{\\rm f}U^{\\rm o}_{\\mathrm {reactants}}</math> is the [[internal energy]] of formation of the reactant molecules that can be calculated from the [[bond energy|bond energies]] of the various chemical bonds of the molecules under consideration and <math>\\Delta_{\\rm f}U^{\\rm o}_{\\mathrm {products}}</math> is the internal energy of formation of the product molecules. The change in internal energy is a process which is equal to the heat change if it is measured under conditions of constant volume (at STP condition), as in a closed rigid container such as a [[Calorimeter#Bomb calorimeters|bomb calorimeter]]. However, under conditions of constant pressure, as in reactions in vessels open to the atmosphere, the measured heat change is not always equal to the internal energy change, because pressure-volume work also releases or absorbs energy. (The heat change at constant pressure is called the [[enthalpy]] change; in this case the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation|enthalpy of formation]]).\n\nAnother useful term is the [[heat of combustion]], which is the energy released due to a [[combustion]] reaction and often applied in the study of [[fuels]]. Food is similar to hydrocarbon fuel and carbohydrate fuels, and when it is oxidized, its caloric content is similar (though not assessed in the same way as a hydrocarbon fuel \u2014 see [[food energy]]).\n\nIn chemical thermodynamics the term used for the chemical potential energy is [[chemical potential]], and for chemical transformation an equation most often used is the [[Gibbs-Duhem equation]].\n\n==Chemical reactions==\n{{Main|Chemical reaction}}\nIn most cases of interest in chemical thermodynamics there are internal [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] and processes, such as [[chemical reaction]]s and [[phase transition]]s, which always create [[entropy]] unless they are at equilibrium, or are maintained at a \"running equilibrium\" through \"quasi-static\" changes by being coupled to constraining devices, such as [[piston]]s or [[electrode]]s, to deliver and receive external work. Even for homogeneous \"bulk\" materials, the free energy functions depend on the [[chemical compound|composition]], as do all the [[extensive quantity|extensive]] [[thermodynamic potentials]], including the internal energy. If the quantities {&nbsp;''N''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;}, the number of [[chemical species]], are omitted from the formulae, it is impossible to describe compositional changes.\n\n===Gibbs function or Gibbs Energy===\nFor a \"bulk\" (unstructured) system they are the last remaining extensive variables. For an unstructured, homogeneous \"bulk\" system, there are still various ''extensive'' compositional variables {&nbsp;''N''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;} that ''G'' depends on, which specify the composition, the amounts of each [[chemical substance]], expressed as the numbers of molecules present or (dividing by [[Avogadro's number]] = 6.023 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup>), the numbers of [[mole (unit)|moles]]\n\n:<math> G = G(T,P,\\{N_i\\})\\,.</math>\n\nFor the case where only ''PV'' work is possible\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{d}G = -S\\, \\mathrm{d}T + V \\, \\mathrm{d}P + \\sum_i \\mu_i \\, \\mathrm{d}N_i \\,</math>\n\nin which ''\u03bc<sub>i</sub>'' is the [[chemical potential]] for the ''i''-th [[component (thermodynamics)|component]] in the system\n\n:<math> \\mu_i  = \\left( \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial N_i}\\right)_{T,P,N_{j\\ne i},etc. } \\,.</math>\n\nThe expression for d''G'' is especially useful at constant ''T'' and ''P'', conditions which are easy to achieve experimentally and which approximates the condition in [[life|living]] creatures\n\n:<math> (\\mathrm{d}G)_{T,P} = \\sum_i \\mu_i \\, \\mathrm{d}N_i\\,.</math>\n\n===Chemical affinity===\n{{main|Chemical affinity}}\nWhile this formulation is mathematically defensible, it is not particularly transparent since one does not simply add or remove molecules from a system. There is always a ''process'' involved in changing the composition; e.g., a chemical reaction (or many), or movement of molecules from one phase (liquid) to another (gas or solid). We should find a notation which does not seem to imply that the amounts of the components (&nbsp;''N''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;) can be changed independently. All real processes obey [[conservation of mass]], and in addition, conservation of the numbers of [[atom]]s of each kind. Whatever molecules are transferred to or from should be considered part of the \"system\".\n\nConsequently, we introduce an explicit variable to represent the degree of advancement of a process, a progress [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]&nbsp;''\u03be'' for the ''[[extent of reaction]]'' (Prigogine & Defay, p.&nbsp;18; Prigogine, pp.&nbsp;4\u20137; Guggenheim, p.&nbsp;37.62), and to the use of the [[partial derivative]] \u2202''G''/\u2202''\u03be'' (in place of the widely used \"\u0394''G''\", since the quantity at issue is not a finite change). The result is an understandable [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] for the dependence of d''G'' on [[chemical reaction]]s (or other processes). If there is just one reaction\n:<math>(\\mathrm{d}G)_{T,P} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial \\xi}\\right)_{T,P} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\xi.\\,</math>\n\nIf we introduce the ''[[stoichiometric coefficient]]'' for the ''i-th'' component in the reaction\n\n::<math>\\nu_i = \\partial N_i / \\partial \\xi \\,</math>\n\nwhich tells how many molecules of ''i'' are produced or consumed, we obtain an algebraic expression for the partial derivative\n\n:<math> \\left( \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial \\xi} \\right)_{T,P} = \\sum_i \\mu_i \\nu_i = -\\mathbb{A}\\,</math>\n\nwhere, (De Donder; Progoine & Defay, p.&nbsp;69; Guggenheim, pp.&nbsp;37,240), we introduce a concise and historical name for this quantity, the \"[[chemical affinity|affinity]]\", symbolized by '''A''', as introduced by [[Th\u00e9ophile de Donder]] in 1923. The minus sign comes from the fact the affinity was defined to represent the rule that spontaneous changes will ensue only when the change in the Gibbs free energy of the process is negative, meaning that the chemical species have a positive affinity for each other. The differential for ''G'' takes on a simple form which displays its dependence on compositional change\n\n:<math>(\\mathrm{d}G)_{T,P} = -\\mathbb{A}\\, d\\xi  \\,.</math>\n\nIf there are a number of chemical reactions going on simultaneously, as is usually the case\n\n:<math>(\\mathrm{d}G)_{T,P} = -\\sum_k\\mathbb{A}_k\\, d\\xi_k  \\,.</math>\n\na set of reaction coordinates {&nbsp;\u03be<sub>''j''</sub>&nbsp;}, avoiding the notion that the amounts of the components (&nbsp;''N''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;) can be changed independently. The expressions above are equal to zero at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], while in the general case for real systems, they are negative because all chemical reactions proceeding at a finite rate produce entropy. This can be made even more explicit by introducing the reaction ''rates'' d''\u03be''<sub>''j''</sub>/d''t''. For each and every <span style=\"color:maroon;\">''physically independent''</span> ''process'' (Prigogine & Defay, p.&nbsp;38; Prigogine, p.&nbsp;24)\n\n::<math> \\mathbb{A}\\ \\dot{\\xi} \\le 0  \\,.</math>\n\nThis is a remarkable result since the chemical potentials are intensive system variables, depending only on the local molecular milieu. They cannot \"know\" whether the temperature and pressure (or any other system variables) are going to be held constant over time. It is a purely local criterion and must hold regardless of any such constraints. Of course, it could have been obtained by taking partial derivatives of any of the other fundamental state functions, but nonetheless is a general criterion for (&minus;''T'' times) the entropy production from that spontaneous process; or at least any part of it that is not captured as external work. (See ''Constraints'' below.)\n\nWe now relax the requirement of a homogeneous \u201cbulk\u201d system by letting the [[chemical potential]]s and the affinity apply to any locality in which a chemical reaction (or any other process) is occurring. By accounting for the [[entropy production]] due to irreversible processes, the inequality for d''G'' is now replaced by an equality\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{d}G = - S \\, \\mathrm{d}T + V \\, \\mathrm{d}P -\\sum_k\\mathbb{A}_k\\, \\mathrm{d}\\xi_k  + W'\\,</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{d}G_{T,P} = -\\sum_k\\mathbb{A}_k\\, \\mathrm{d}\\xi_k  + W'.\\,</math>\n\nAny decrease in the [[Gibbs function]] of a system is the upper limit for any [[isothermal process|isothermal]], [[isobaric process|isobaric]] work that can be captured in the [[surroundings]], or it may simply be [[dissipation|dissipated]], appearing as ''T'' times a corresponding increase in the entropy of the system and/or its surrounding. Or it may go partly toward doing external work and partly toward creating entropy. The important point is that the ''[[extent of reaction]]'' for a chemical reaction may be coupled to the displacement of some external mechanical or electrical quantity in such a way that one can advance only if the other one also does. The coupling may occasionally be ''rigid'', but it is often flexible and variable.\n\n===Solutions===\nIn solution [[chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]], the [[Gibbs free energy]] decrease (\u2202''G''/\u2202''\u03be'', in molar units, denoted cryptically by \u0394''G'') is commonly used as a surrogate for (&minus;''T'' times) the entropy produced by spontaneous [[chemical reaction]]s in situations where there is no work being done; or at least no \"useful\" work; i.e., other than perhaps some \u00b1&nbsp;''P'' d''V''. The assertion that all ''spontaneous reactions have a negative \u0394''G'' is merely a restatement of the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]], giving it the [[dimensional analysis|physical dimensions]] of energy and somewhat obscuring its significance in terms of entropy. When there is no useful work being done, it would be less misleading to use the [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transform]]s of the entropy appropriate for constant ''T'', or for constant ''T'' and ''P'', the Massieu functions  &minus;''F''/''T'' and &minus;''G''/''T'' respectively.\n\n==Non equilibrium==\n{{Main|non-equilibrium thermodynamics}}\n\nGenerally the systems treated with the conventional chemical thermodynamics are either at equilibrium or near equilibrium. [[Ilya Prigogine]] developed the thermodynamic treatment of [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]] that are far from equilibrium. In doing so he has discovered phenomena and structures of completely new and completely unexpected types. His generalized, nonlinear and irreversible thermodynamics has found surprising applications in a wide variety of fields.\n\nThe non equilibrium thermodynamics has been applied for explaining how ordered structures e.g. the biological systems, can develop from disorder. Even if Onsager's relations are utilized, the classical principles of equilibrium in thermodynamics still show that linear systems close to equilibrium always develop into states of disorder which are stable to perturbations and cannot explain the occurrence of ordered structures.\n\nPrigogine called these systems [[dissipative systems]], because they are formed and maintained by the dissipative processes which take place because of the exchange of energy between the system and its environment and because they disappear if that exchange ceases. They may be said to live in [[symbiosis]] with their environment.\n\nThe method which Prigogine used to study the stability of the dissipative structures to perturbations is of very great general interest. It makes it possible to study the most varied problems, such as city traffic problems, the stability of insect communities, the development of ordered biological structures and the growth of cancer cells to mention but a few examples.\n\n===System constraints===\n\nIn this regard, it is crucial to understand the role of walls and other ''constraints'', and the distinction between ''independent'' processes and ''coupling''. Contrary to the clear implications of many reference sources, the previous analysis is not restricted to [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogeneous]], [[isotropy|isotropic]] bulk systems which can deliver only ''P''d''V'' work to the outside world, but applies even to the most structured systems. There are complex systems with many chemical \"reactions\" going on at the same time, some of which are really only parts of the same, overall process. An ''independent'' process is one that ''could'' proceed even if all others were unaccountably stopped in their tracks. Understanding this is perhaps a \u201c[[thought experiment]]\u201d in [[chemical kinetics]], but actual examples exist.\n\nA gas reaction which results in an increase in the number of molecules will lead to an increase in volume at constant external pressure. If it occurs inside a cylinder closed with a piston, the equilibrated reaction can proceed only by doing work against an external force on the piston. The extent variable for the reaction can increase only if the piston moves, and conversely, if the piston is pushed inward, the reaction is driven backwards.\n\nSimilarly, a [[redox]] reaction might occur in an [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] cell with the passage of [[electric current|current]] in [[wire]]s connecting the [[electrode]]s. The half-cell reactions at the [[electrode]]s are constrained if no current is allowed to flow. The current might be dissipated as [[joule heating]], or it might in turn run an electrical device like a [[electric motor|motor]] doing [[mechanical work]]. An [[automobile]] [[lead]]-[[acid]] [[battery (electricity)|battery]] can be recharged, driving the chemical reaction backwards. In this case as well, the reaction is not an independent process. Some, perhaps most, of the Gibbs free energy of reaction may be delivered as external work.\n\nThe [[hydrolysis]] of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and [[phosphate]] can drive the [[force]] times [[distance]] work delivered by living [[muscle]]s, and synthesis of ATP is in turn driven by a redox chain in [[Mitochonndrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s, which involves the transport of [[ion]]s across the membranes of these [[cell (biology)|cell]]ular [[organelle]]s. The coupling of processes here, and in the previous examples, is often not complete. Gas can leak slowly past a piston, just as it can slowly leak out of a [[rubber]] [[balloon]]. Some reaction may occur in a battery even if no external current is flowing. There is usually a coupling [[coefficient]], which may depend on relative rates, which determines what percentage of the driving free energy is turned into external work, or captured as \"chemical work\"; a misnomer for the free energy of another chemical process.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Thermodynamic databases for pure substances]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | author=Herbert B.

Smith did not complete the entire text of the Bible during his lifetime. However, his incomplete work is known as the ''Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible'', or the ''Inspired Version''. Although this selected translation is not generally quoted by church members, the English Bible issued by the church and commonly used by Latter-day Saints contains cross references to the Joseph Smith Translation (JST), as well as an appendix containing major excerpts from it. However, with the exceptions of Smith's translation of portions of the [[Book of Genesis]] (renamed [[Book of Moses|Selections from the Book of Moses]]) and the translation of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] (called [[Joseph Smith\u2013Matthew]]), no portions of the JST have been officially canonized by the LDS Church.\n\n==The Book of Mormon==\n[[File:The Book of Mormon- An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cover page of The Book of Mormon from an original 1830 edition, by [[Joseph Smith]]<br />(Image from the U.S. Library of Congress ''Rare Book and Special Collections Division''.)]]{{wikisource|The Book of Mormon|The Book of Mormon}}\n{{main|Book of Mormon|List of Book of Mormon translations}}\nLatter-day Saints consider The Book of Mormon a volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible. It contains a record of God\u2019s dealings with the prophets and ancient inhabitants of the [[Americas]]. The introduction to the book asserts that it \"contains, as does the Bible, the fullness of the everlasting gospel. The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon.\"\n\nSegments of the Book of Mormon provide an account of the culture, religious teachings and civilizations of groups who immigrated to the New World. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C., and afterward separated into two nations, identified in the book as the [[Nephite]]s and the [[Lamanite]]s. Some years after their arrival, the Nephites met with a similar group, the [[Mulekites]] who left the Middle East during the same period. An older group arrived in America much earlier, when the Lord confounded the tongues at the [[Tower of Babel]]. This group is known as the [[Jaredite]]s and their story is condensed in the [[Book of Ether]]. The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of Jesus Christ among Nephites soon after his [[resurrection]]. This account presents the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and offers men peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come.  The latter segments of the Book of Mormon details the destruction of these civilizations, as all were destroyed except the Lamanites. The book asserts that the Lamanites are among the ancestors of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].\n\nAccording to his record, Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon by gift and power of God through the [[Urim and Thummim]]. Eleven witnesses signed testimonies of its authenticity, which are now included in the preface to the Book of Mormon. The [[Three Witnesses]] testified to having seen an [[angel]] present the gold plates, and to having heard God bear witness to its truth. [[Eight Witnesses|Eight]] others stated that Joseph Smith showed them the plates and that they handled and examined them.\n\n==The Doctrine and Covenants==\n{{wikisource|The Doctrine and Covenants|The Doctrine and Covenants}}\nThe LDS Church's [[Doctrine and Covenants]] is a collection of revelations, policies, letters, and statements given to the modern church by [[List of presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|past church presidents]].  This record contains points of church doctrine and direction on church government. The book has existed in numerous forms, with varying content, throughout the history of the church and has also been published in differing formats by the various [[Latter Day Saint]] denominations. When the church chooses to canonize new material, it is typically added to the Doctrine and Covenants; the most recent changes were made in 1981.\n\n==The Pearl of Great Price==\n{{wikisource|Pearl of Great Price|Pearl of Great Price}}\n[[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|The Pearl of Great Price]] is a selection of material produced by Joseph Smith and deals with many significant aspects of the faith and doctrine of the church.  Many of these materials were initially published in church periodicals in the early days of the church.\n\nThe Pearl of Great Price contains five sections:\n* Selections from the [[Book of Moses]]:  portions of the Book of Genesis from the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible.\n* The [[Book of Abraham]]: a translation from [[papyrus|papyri]] acquired by Smith in 1835, dealing with [[Abraham]]'s journeys in [[Egypt]].  The work contains many distinctive [[Mormon]] doctrines such as [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]].\n* Joseph Smith\u2014Matthew: portions of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] from the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]].\n* [[Joseph Smith\u2014History]]: a first-person narrative of Smith's life before the founding of the church. The material is taken from ''[[Documentary History of the Church]]'' and is based on a history written by Smith in 1838.\n* [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|The Articles of Faith]]: concise listing of thirteen fundamental doctrines of Mormonism [[Wentworth letter|composed]] by Smith in 1842.\n\n==Church instruction==\nHistorically, in the LDS Church's [[Sunday School (Mormonism)|Sunday School]] and [[Church Educational System]] (CES) classes, the standard works have been studied and taught in a four-year rotation:\n\n:Year One : [[Old Testament]] (also includes some coverage of related topics in the Book of Moses and Book of Abraham from the Pearl of Great Price)\n:Year Two : [[New Testament]]\n:Year Three: Book of Mormon\n:Year Four: Doctrine and Covenants and [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church History]]\n\nHowever, church leaders have emphasized that [[Latter-day Saints]] should not restrict their study of the standard works to the particular book being currently studied in Sunday School or other religious courses. Specifically, church president [[Ezra Taft Benson]] taught:\n\n<blockquote>\nAt present, the Book of Mormon is studied in our Sunday School and seminary classes every fourth year. This four-year pattern, however, must ''not'' be followed by Church members in their personal and family study. We need to read daily from the pages of [that] book ....<ref>{{citation |first= Ezra Taft |last= Benson |authorlink= Ezra Taft Benson |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/1988/11/flooding-the-earth-with-the-book-of-mormon?lang=eng |title=Flooding the Earth with the Book of Mormon |journal= Ensign |date=November 1988 }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn November 2014, the church announced changes in the curriculum to be used within CES, including the church's four institutions of higher education, such as [[Brigham Young University]].

Joseph Smith gained a small following in the late 1820s as he was dictating the [[Book of Mormon]], which he said was a translation of words found on a set of \"[[golden plates]]\" that had been buried near his home in [[upstate New York]] by an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American]] prophet. On April 6, 1830, at the [[Peter Whitmer log home|home of Peter Whitmer]] in [[Fayette, New York]], Smith organized the religion's first legal church entity, the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]]. The church rapidly gained a following, who viewed Smith as their [[Prophet, seer, and revelator|prophet]]. The main body of the church moved first to [[Kirtland, Ohio]] in the early 1830s, then to [[Missouri]] in 1838, where the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] with other Missouri settlers ensued, culminating in adherents being expelled from the state under [[Missouri Executive Order 44]] signed by [[Lilburn W. Boggs|the governor of Missouri]]. After Missouri, Smith built the city of [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], near which [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith was killed]]. After Smith's death, a [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]] ensued, and the majority voted to accept the [[Quorum of the Twelve]], led by Brigham Young, as the church's leading body.\n\nAfter continued difficulties and persecution in Illinois, Young left Nauvoo in 1846 and led his followers, the [[Mormon pioneers]], to the Great [[Salt Lake Valley]]. The group branched out in an effort to pioneer a large state to be called [[State of Deseret|Deseret]], eventually establishing colonies from Canada to present-day Mexico. Young incorporated The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a legal entity, and governed his followers as a [[theocracy|theocratic]] leader serving in both political and religious positions. He also publicized the previously secret practice of [[plural marriage]], a form of [[polygamy]]. By 1857, tensions had again escalated between Mormons and other Americans, largely as a result of church teachings on polygamy and theocracy. The [[Utah War|Utah Mormon War]] ensued from 1857 to 1858, which resulted in the relatively peaceful invasion of Utah by the [[United States Army]], after which Young agreed to step down from power and be replaced by a non-Mormon territorial governor, [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]]. Nevertheless, the LDS Church still wielded significant political power in the [[Utah Territory]] as part of a shadow government. At Young's death in 1877, he was followed by other powerful members, who continued the practice of polygamy despite opposition by the [[United States Congress]]. After tensions with the U.S. government came to a head in 1890, the church [[1890 Manifesto|officially abandoned]] the public practice of polygamy in the United States, and eventually stopped performing official polygamous marriages altogether after a [[Second Manifesto]] in 1904. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy and today seeks to actively distance itself from \"[[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]\" groups still practicing polygamy.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the church grew substantially and became an international organization. Distancing itself from polygamy, the church began engaging, first with mainstream American culture, and then with international cultures, particularly those of [[Latin America]], by sending out thousands of [[Mormon missionary|missionaries]] across the globe. The church became a strong and public champion of [[monogamy]] and the [[nuclear family]], and at times played a prominent role in political matters. Among the official changes to the organization during the modern area include the [[Black people and Mormonism|ordination of black men]] to the priesthood in 1978, reversing a policy originally instituted by Brigham Young. The church has also periodically changed its [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|temple ceremony]], gradually omitting certain controversial elements. There are also periodic changes in the structure and organization of the church, mainly to accommodate the organization's growth and increasing international presence.\n\n{{details|topic=Mormon history as an academic field|Mormon studies}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early history (c. 1820s to c. 1846)==\n{{Main|History of the Latter Day Saint movement}}\n\nThe early history of the LDS Church is shared with other denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement, who all regard Joseph Smith as the founder of their religious tradition. Smith gained a small following in the late 1820s as he was dictating the Book of Mormon, which he said was a translation of words found on the Golden Plates that had been buried near his home in western New York by an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American]] prophet. Smith said he had been in contact with an [[angel Moroni]], who showed him the plates' location and had been grooming him for a role as a religious leader.<!--\n\nFOOTNOTE--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/topics/scriptures|accessdate=2007-12-25|title=Scriptures|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}: \"On September 22, 1827, an angel named Moroni\u2014the last Book of Mormon prophet\u2014delivered these records to the Prophet Joseph Smith.\"</ref>\n\nOn April 6, 1830, in western New York,<!--\n\nFOOTNOTE--><ref>The Church of Christ was organized in the log cabin of [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] in the [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]] area, near [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], followed by a meeting the next Sunday in nearby [[Fayette, New York|Fayette]] at the house of [[Peter Whitmer, Sr.]] Nevertheless, one of Smith's histories and an 1887 reminiscence by [[David Whitmer]] say the church was organized at the Whitmer house in Fayette. (Whitmer, however, had already told a reporter in 1875 that the church was organized in Manchester. {{Citation\n | last=Whitmer\n | title=The Golden Tables\n | periodical=Chicago Times\n | date=August 7, 1875\n | url=http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/IL/mischig.htm#080775|first=John C.\n }}.)

The LDS Church refers to Fayette as the place of organization in all its official [[publication]]s.</ref><!--\n\n--> Smith organized the religion's first legal church entity, the Church of Christ. The church rapidly gained a following, who viewed Smith as their prophet. In late 1830, Smith envisioned a [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|\"city of Zion\"]], a Utopian city in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lands near [[Independence, Missouri]]. In October 1830, he sent his [[Assistant President of the Church|Assistant President]], [[Oliver Cowdery]], and others on a [[Missionary (LDS Church)|mission]] to the area.<ref>{{lds|D&C|dc|32}}</ref> Passing through [[Kirtland, Ohio]], the missionaries converted a congregation of [[Disciples of Christ]] led by [[Sidney Rigdon]], and in 1831, Smith decided to temporarily move his followers to Kirtland until lands in the Missouri area could be purchased. In the meantime, the church's headquarters remained in Kirtland from 1831 to 1838; and there the church built [[Kirtland Temple|its first temple]] and continued to grow in membership from 680 to 17,881.<ref>The Desert Morning News ''2008 Church Almanac'' pg.655</ref>\n\nWhile the main church body was in Kirtland, many of Smith's followers had attempted to establish settlements in Missouri, but had met with resistance from other Missourians who believed Mormons were [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], or who distrusted their political ambitions. After Smith and other Mormons in Kirtland emigrated to Missouri in 1838, hostilities escalated into the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]], culminating in adherents being expelled from the state under an Extermination Order signed by [[Lilburn W. Boggs|the governor of Missouri]].\n\n[[Image:Ovalportrait-josephsmith-Carter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joseph Smith]] (pictured), founder of the church, and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] were killed in [[Carthage, Illinois]], by a [[wikt:mob|mob]] on June 27, 1844]]\n\nAfter Missouri, Smith built the city of Nauvoo, Illinois as the new church headquarters, and served as the city's mayor and leader of the militia. As church leader, Smith also instituted the then-secret practice of plural marriage, and taught a form of [[Millennialism]] which he called \"[[theodemocracy]]\", to be led by a [[Council of Fifty]] which, allegedly, had secretly and symbolically anointed him as king of this Millennial theodemocracy.<!--\n\nFOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Citation\n | last=Quinn\n | first=D.

The arrival of the original Mormon Pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847 is commemorated by the [[U.S. state holiday|Utah State holiday]] [[Pioneer Day (Utah)|Pioneer Day]].\n\n[[Image:LDS expansion western north america.svg|thumb|right|250px|Locations of major LDS settlements in North America prior to 1890. Included are major cities founded by LDS settlers who later abandoned the area.]]\n\nGroups of converts from the United States, Canada, Europe, and elsewhere were encouraged to gather to Utah in the decades following. Both the original Mormon migration and subsequent convert migrations resulted in much sacrifice and quite a number of deaths. Brigham Young organized a great colonization of the American West, with Mormon settlements extending from Canada to Mexico. Notable cities that sprang from early Mormon settlements include [[San Bernardino, California]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], and [[Mesa, Arizona]].\n\n===Brigham Young's early theocratic leadership===\n{{see also|Council of Fifty|Theodemocracy}}\n\nFollowing the death of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young stated that the Church should be led by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (see [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)#Conference of August 8, 1844|Succession Crisis]]). Later, after the migration to Utah had begun, Brigham Young was sustained as a member of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] on December 25, 1847, (Wilford Woodruff Diary, Church Archives), and then as [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]] on October 8, 1848. (Roberts, Comprehensive History of the Church, 3:318).\n\nOne of the reasons the Saints had chosen the Great Basin as a settling place was that the area was at the time outside the territorial borders of the United States, which Young had blamed for failing to protect Mormons from political opposition from the states of Missouri and Illinois. However, in the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], [[Mexico]] [[Mexican Cession|ceded]] the area to the United States. As a result, Brigham Young sent emissaries to [[Washington, D.C.]] with a proposal to create a vast [[State of Deseret]], of which Young would naturally be the first governor. Instead, Congress created the much smaller [[Utah Territory]] in 1850, and Young was appointed governor in 1851. Because of his religious position, Young exercised much more practical control over the affairs of Mormon and non-Mormon settlers than a typical territorial governor of the time.\n\nFor most of the 19th century, the LDS Church maintained an ecclesiastical court system parallel to federal courts, and required Mormons to use the system exclusively for civil matters, or face church discipline. {{Harv|Mangrum|1983|pp=80\u201381}}\n\n===Mormon Reformation===\nIn 1856-1858, the Church underwent what is commonly called the [[Mormon Reformation]].<ref>Peterson, Paul H. \"The Mormon Reformation of 1856-1857: The Rhetoric and the Reality.\" 15 ''Journal of Mormon History'' 59-87 (1989).</ref> In 1855, a drought struck the flourishing territory. Very little rain fell, and even the dependable mountain streams ran very low. An infestation of grasshoppers and crickets destroyed whatever crops the Mormons had managed to salvage. During the winter of 1855-56, flour and other basic necessities were very scarce and very costly. [[Heber C. Kimball]] wrote his son, \"Dollars and cents do not count now, in these times, for they are the tightest that I have ever seen in the territory of Utah.\"\n\nIn September 1856, as the drought continued, the trials and difficulties of the previous year led to an explosion of intense soul searching. [[Jedediah M. Grant]], a counselor in the First Presidency and a well-known conservative voice in the extended community, preached three days of fiery sermons to the people of [[Kaysville, Utah]] territory. He called for repentance and a general recommitment to moral living and religious teachings. 500 people presented themselves for \"rebaptism\" &mdash; a symbol of their determination to reform their lives. The zealous message spread from Kaysville to surrounding Mormon communities. Church leaders traveled around the territory, expressing their concern about signs of spiritual decay and calling for repentance. Members were asked to seal their rededication with rebaptism.\n\nSeveral sermons [[Willard Richards]] and [[George A. Smith]] had given earlier in the history of the church had touched on the concept of [[blood atonement]], suggesting that [[apostate]]s could become so enveloped in sin that the voluntary shedding of their own blood might increase their chances of eternal salvation. On 21 September 1856, while calling for sincere repentance, Brigham Young took the idea further, and stated:\n\n<blockquote>I know that there are transgressors, who, if they knew themselves and the only condition upon which they can obtain forgiveness, would beg of their brethren to shed their blood, that the smoke might ascend to God as an offering to appease the wrath that is kindled against them, and that the law might have its course. ''Journal of Discourses'' 4:43.</blockquote>\n\nThis belief became part of the public image of the church at the time and was pilloried in Eastern newspapers along with the practice of polygamy. The concept was frequently criticized by many Mormons and eventually repudiated as official church doctrine by the LDS Church in 1978. However, modern critics of the church and popular writers often attribute a formal doctrine of blood atonement to the Church.\n\nThroughout the winter special meetings were held and Mormons urged to adhere to the commandments of God and the practices and precepts of the church. Preaching placed emphasis on the practice of [[plural marriage]], adherence to the [[Word of Wisdom]], attendance at church meetings, and personal prayer. On December 30, 1856, the entire all-Mormon territorial legislature was rebaptized for the remission of their sins, and confirmed under the hands of the Twelve Apostles. As time went on, however, the sermons became excessive and intolerant, and some verged on the hysterical.\n\n===Utah War and Mountain Meadows massacre===\nIn 1857-1858, the church was involved in an armed conflict with the U.S. government, entitled the [[Utah War]]. The settlers and the United States government battled for [[hegemony]] over the culture and government of the territory. Tensions over the Utah War, the murder of Mormon apostle Parley P. Pratt in Arkansas,  and threats of violence from the Baker-Fancher wagon train (and possibly other factors), resulted in rogue Mormon settlers in southern Utah massacring a wagon train from Arkansas, known as [[Mountain Meadows massacre]]. The result of the Utah War was the succeeding of the governorship of the Utah territory from Brigham Young to [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]], an outsider appointed by President [[James Buchanan]].\n\n===Brigham Young's later years===\nThe church had attempted unsuccessfully to institute the [[United Order]] numerous times, most recently during the [[Mormon Reformation]]. In 1874, Young once again attempted to establish a permanent Order, which he now called the \"United Order of Enoch\" in at least 200 Mormon communities, beginning in [[St. George, Utah]] on February 9, 1874.\nIn Young's Order, producers would generally deed their property to the Order, and all members of the order would share the cooperative's net income, often divided into shares according to how much property was originally contributed. Sometimes, the members of the Order would receive wages for their work on the communal property. Like the United Order established by Joseph Smith, Young's Order was short-lived. By the time of Brigham Young's death in 1877, most of these United Orders had failed. By the end of the 19th century, the Orders were essentially extinct.\n\nBrigham Young died in August 1877. After the death of Brigham Young, the First Presidency was not reorganized until 1880, when Young was succeeded by President [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]], who in the interim had served as [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]].\n\n===Polygamy and the United States \"Mormon question\"===\n{{Main|Mormonism and polygamy}}\n\nFor several decades, polygamy was preached as [[God]]'s law. Brigham Young, the Prophet of the church at that time, had quite a few wives, as did many other church leaders. This early practice of polygamy caused conflict between church members and the wider American society. In 1854 the Republican party referred in its platform to polygamy and [[slavery]] as the \"twin relics of barbarism.\" In 1862, the U.S. Congress enacted the [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]], signed by [[Abraham Lincoln]], which made bigamy a felony in the territories punishable by $500 or five years in prison. The law also permitted the confiscation of church property<ref name=supct>Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. United States, 136 U.S. 1 (1890)</ref> without compensation. This law was not enforced however, by the Lincoln administration or by Mormon-controlled territorial probate courts. Moreover, as Mormon polygamist marriages were performed in secret, it was difficult to prove when a polygamist marriage had taken place. In the meantime, Congress was preoccupied with the [[American Civil War]].\n\nIn 1874, after the war, Congress passed the [[Poland Act]], which transferred jurisdiction over Morrill Act cases to federal prosecutors and courts, which were not controlled by Mormons. In addition, the Morrill Act was upheld in 1878 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]''. After ''Reynolds'', Congress became even more aggressive against polygamy, and passed the [[Edmunds Act]] in 1882. The Edmunds Act prohibited not just bigamy, which remained a felony, but also bigamous cohabitation, which was prosecuted as a misdemeanor, and did not require proof an actual marriage ceremony had taken place. The Act also vacated the Utah territorial government, created an independent committee to oversee elections to prevent Mormon influence, and disenfranchised any former or present polygamist. Further, the law allowed the government to deny civil rights to polygamists without a trial.\n\nIn 1887, Congress passed the [[Edmunds-Tucker Act]], which allowed prosecutors to force plural wives to testify against their husbands, abolished the right of women to vote, disincorporated the church, and confiscated the church's property.<ref name=supct/> By this time, many church leaders had gone into hiding to avoid prosecution, and half the Utah prison population was composed of polygamists.\n\nChurch leadership officially ended the practice in 1890, based on a revelation to [[Wilford Woodruff]] called the [[1890 Manifesto]].\n\n==Modern era (c. 1890\u20131994)==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Timeline of Mormonism.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Portal:History of the Latter Day Saint movement/Timeline of Mormonism|Timeline of Mormonism]] ]] -->\nThe church's modern era began soon after it renounced polygamy in 1890.

In 1898, Utah elected [[general authority]] [[B.H. Roberts]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]] as a Democrat. Roberts, however, was denied a seat there because he was practicing polygamy. In 1903, the Utah legislature selected [[Reed Smoot (U.S. Senator)|Reed Smoot]], also an LDS general authority but also a monogamist, as its first senator. From 1904 to 1907, the [[United States Senate]] conducted a [[Reed Smoot hearings|series of Congressional hearings]] on whether Smoot should be seated. Eventually, the Senate granted Smoot a seat and allowed him to vote. However, the hearings raised controversy as to whether polygamy had actually been abandoned as claimed in the 1890 Manifesto, and whether the LDS Church continued to exercise influence on Utah politics. In response to these hearings, President of the Church [[Joseph F. Smith]] issued a [[Second Manifesto]] denying that any post-Manifesto marriages had the church's sanction,<!--\n\nFOOTNOTE--><ref>Later scholars, however, have determined that 90% of polygamous marriages between 1890 and 1904 were, in fact, conducted under church authority. See Quinn at 56.</ref><!--\n\n--> and announcing that those entering such marriages in the future would be [[excommunication|excommunicated]].\n\nThe Second Manifesto did not annul existing plural marriages within the church, and the church tolerated some degree of polygamy into at least the 1930s. However, eventually the church adopted a policy of excommunicating its members found practicing polygamy and today seeks to actively distance itself from [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist]] groups still practicing polygamy.<!--\n\nFOOTNOTE--><ref>In 1998 President Gordon B. Hinckley stated, <blockquote>\n\"If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose.

However, if a Mormon man becomes widowed, he can be sealed to another woman while remaining sealed to his first wife.

She can be married by law, but not sealed in the temple.\n\n===Mormon involvement in national politics===\n\n{{Main|LDS Church and politics in the United States}}\n\n====Mormons and the women's suffrage movement====\nIn 1870, the [[Utah Territory]] had become one of the first polities to grant women the right to vote\u2014a right which the U.S. Congress revoked in 1887 as part of the [[Edmunds-Tucker Act]].\n\nAs a result, a number of LDS women became active and vocal proponents of women's rights. Of particular note was the LDS journalist and suffragist [[Emmeline B. Wells|Emmeline Blanch Wells]], editor of the ''[[Woman's Exponent]]'', a Utah feminist newspaper. Wells, who was both a [[feminism|feminist]] and a polygamist, wrote vocally in favor of a woman's role in the political process and public discourse. National suffrage leaders, however, were somewhat perplexed by the seeming paradox between Utah's progressive stand on women's rights, and the church's stand on polygamy.\n\nIn 1890, after the church officially renounced polygamy, U.S. suffrage leaders began to embrace Utah's feminism more directly, and in 1891, Utah hosted the Rocky Mountain Suffrage Conference in Salt Lake City, attended by such national feminist leaders as [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Anna Howard Shaw]]. The Utah Woman Suffrage Association, which had been formed in 1889 as a branch of the American Woman Suffrage Association (which in 1890 became the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]]), was then successful in demanding that the constitution of the nascent state of Utah should enfranchise women. In 1896, Utah became the third state in the U.S. to grant women the right to vote.\n\n====Mormons and the debate over temperance and prohibition====\nThe LDS church was actively involved in support of the [[Temperance movement in the United States|temperance movement]] in the 19th century, and then the [[prohibition]] movement in the early 20th century.<ref>{{Citation | last=Thompson | first=Brent G. | title='Standing between Two Fires': Mormons and Prohibition, 1908\u20131917 | journal=Journal of Mormon History | pages=35\u201352 | year=1983 | volume=10 | url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/u?/jmh,17670 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613165449/http://content.lib.utah.edu/u/?%2Fjmh%2C17670 | archivedate=2011-06-13 | df= }}</ref>\n\n====Mormonism and the national debate over socialism and communism====\n{{See also|Communalism#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|l1=Communalism: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}\nMormonism has had a mixed relationship with socialism in its various forms. In the earliest days of Mormonism, Joseph Smith had established a form of Christian [[communalism]], an idea made popular during the [[Second Great Awakening]], combined with a move toward [[theocracy]]. Mormons referred to this form of theocratic communalism as the [[United Order]], or the [[law of consecration]]. While short-lived during the life of Joseph Smith, the United Order was re-established for a time in several communities of Utah during the theocratic political leadership of Brigham Young. Some aspects of secular socialism also found place in the political views of Joseph Smith, who ran for President of the United States on a platform which included a nationalized bank that he believed would do away with much of the abuses of private banks. As secular political leader of Nauvoo, Joseph Smith also set aside collective farms which insured that the propertyless poor could maintain a living and provide for themselves and their families. Once in Utah, under the direction of Brigham Young, the Church leadership would also promote collective ownership of industry and issued a circular in 1876 which warned that \"The experience of mankind has shown that the people of communities and nations among whom wealth is the most equally distributed, enjoy the largest degree of liberty, are the least exposed to tyranny and oppression and suffer the least from luxurious habits which beget vice\". The circular, signed and endorsed by the Quorum of the Twelve and the First Presidency went on to warn that if \"measures not taken to prevent the continued enormous growth of riches among the class already rich, and the painful increase of destitution and want among the poor, the nation is likely to be overtaken by disaster; for, according to history, such a tendency among nations once powerful was the sure precursor of ruin\".<ref>{{Citation\n| last=Clark\n | first=James R.\n | title=Messages of the First Presidency Volume 2\n | year=1833\u20131955\n }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to religious socialism, many Mormons in Utah were receptive to the secular socialist movement that began in America during the 1890s. During the 1890s to the 1920s, the Utah Social Democratic Party, which became part of the [[Socialist Party of America]] in 1901, elected about 100 socialists to state offices in Utah. An estimated 40% of Utah Socialists were Mormon. Many early socialists visited the Church's cooperative communities in Utah with great interest and were well received by the Church leadership. Prominent early socialists such as [[Albert Brisbane]], [[Victor Prosper Considerant]], [[Plotino Rhodakanaty]], [[Edward Bellamy]], and Ruth & Reginald Wright Kauffman showed great interest in the successful cooperative communities of the Church in Utah. For example, while doing research for what would become a best selling socialist novel, ''[[Looking Backward]]'', Edward Bellamy toured the Church's cooperative communities in Utah and visited with [[Lorenzo Snow]] for a week.<ref>{{Citation\n | last=Arrington\n | first=Leonard J.\n | title=Brigham Young: American Moses\n | year=1986\n | page=378\n }}</ref> Ruth & Reginald Wright Kauffman also wrote a book, though this one non-fiction, after visiting the Church in Utah. Their book was titled ''[[The Latter Day Saints: A Study of the Mormons in the Light of Economic Conditions]]'', which discussed the Church from a Marxist perspective. [[Plotino Rhodakanaty]] was also drawn to Mormonism and became the first Elder of the Church in Mexico after being baptized when a group of missionaries which included [[Moses Thatcher]] came to Mexico. Moses Thatcher kept in touch with Plotino Rhodakanaty for years following and was himself perhaps the most prominent member of the Church to have openly identified himself as a socialist supporter.\n\nAlbert Brisbane and Victor Prosper Considerant also visited the Church in Utah during its early years, prompting Considerant to note that \"thanks to a certain dose of socialist solidarity, the Mormons have in a few years attained a state of unbelievable prosperity\".<ref>{{Citation\n | last=Beacher\n | first=Jonathan\n | title=Victor Considerant and the Rise and Fall of French Romantic Socialism\n | year=2001\n | page=301\n }}</ref> Attributing the peculiar socialist attitudes of the early Mormons with their success in the desert of the western United States was common even among those who were not themselves socialist. For instance, in his book History of Utah, 1540-1886, [[Hubert Howe Bancroft]] points out that the Mormons \"while not communists, the elements of socialism enter strongly into all their relations, public and private, social, commercial, and industrial, as well as religious and political.  This tends to render them exclusive, independent of the gentiles and their government, and even in some respects antagonistic to them.  They have assisted each other until nine out of ten own their farms, while commerce and manufacturing are to large extent cooperative.  The rights of property are respected; but while a Mormon may sell his farm to a gentile, it would not be deemed good fellowship for him to do so.\"<ref>{{Citation\n | last=Bancroft\n | first=Hubert Howe\n | title=History of Utah, 1540-1886\n | page=306\n }}</ref>\n\nWhile religious and secular socialism gained some acceptance among Mormons, the church was more circumspect about [[Marxism|Marxist]] Communism, because of its acceptance of violence as a means to achieve revolution. From the time of Joseph Smith, the church had taken a favorable view as to the [[American Revolution]] and the necessity at times to violently overthrow the government, however the church viewed the revolutionary nature of [[Leninism|Leninist]] [[Communism]] as a threat to the [[United States Constitution]], which the church saw as divinely inspired to ensure the agency of man ( Mormonism believes God revealed to Joseph Smith in Chapter 101 of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] that \"the laws and constitution of the people ... I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles\"). In 1936, the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] issued a statement stating:\n\n{{quote|[I]t would be necessary to destroy our government before Communism could be set up in the United States.\n\nSince Communism, established, would destroy our American Constitutional government, to support Communism is treasonable to our free institutions, and no patriotic American citizen may become either a Communist or supporter of Communism. ...\n\nCommunism being thus hostile to loyal American citizenship and incompatible with true church membership, of necessity no loyal American citizen and no faithful church member can be a Communist.|First Presidency, \"Warning to Church Members,\" July 3, 1936, ''Improvement Era'' 39, no. 8 (August 1936): 488.}}\n\nIn later years, such leaders as [[Ezra Taft Benson]] would take a stronger anti-Communist position publicly, his anti-Communism often being anti-leftist in general. However, Benson's views often brought embarrassment to the Church leadership, and when Benson was sent to Europe on a mission for the Church, many{{Who|date=November 2010}} believed this was a way of getting Benson out of the US where his right-wing views were a point of embarrassment for the church. While publicly claiming that this was not the reason for Benson's call to Europe, then President [[Joseph Fielding Smith]] wrote a letter to Congressman [[Ralph Harding]] stating that \"It would be better for him and for the Church and all concerned, if he would settle down to his present duties and let all political matters take their course. He is going to take a mission to Europe in the near future and by the time he returns I hope he will get all the political notions out of his system.\" In another letter written in response to questions about how long Benson would be on his mission to Europe from U.S. Under-Secretary of State [[Averell Harriman]], First Counselor [[Hugh B. Brown]] responded \"If I had my way, he'll never come back!\".<ref>{{Citation\n | last=Prince\n | first=Gregory A.\n | title=David O. McKay and the Rise of Modern Mormonism\n | year=2005\n | pages=279\u2013323\n }}</ref> Later, Benson would become the President of the Church and backed off of his political rhetoric. Toward the end of his presidency, the Church even began to discipline Church members who had taken Benson's earlier hardline right-wing speeches too much to heart, some of whom claimed that the Church had excommunicated them for adhering too closely to Benson's right-wing ideology.<ref>{{Citation\n | last=Chris Jorgensen and [[Peggy Fletcher Stack]]\n | title=It's Judgment Day for Far Right: LDS Church Purges Survivalists\n | year=1992\n | newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune, 29 November 1992 Sunday Edition, Page A1\n }}</ref>\n\n===Institutional reforms===\n\n====Developments in Church financing====\nIn the 1890s soon after the [[1890 Manifesto]], the LDS Church was in a dire financial condition. It was recovering from the U.S. crackdown on polygamy, and had difficulty reclaiming property that had been confiscated during polygamy raids. Meanwhile, there was a [[panic of 1893|national recession beginning in 1893]]. By the late 1890s, the church was about $2 million in debt, and near bankruptcy.<!--\n\nFOOTNOTE--><ref>{{Citation\n |last        = Bell\n |first       = E.

In 1980, the Church introduced the \"Consolidated Meeting Schedule\", in which most church meetings were held on Sunday during a three-hour block.\n\nWhile promoting convenience and making church practice compatible with millions of non-Utahns, this new schedule has been criticized for eroding fellowshipping opportunities among North American Latter-day Saint youth. This erosion, in turn, has been blamed for decreasing LDS participation of young women to below that of young men, and for a downward trend in the percentage of LDS males who accept the call to serve a full-time mission. ''See'' Quinn, ''Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power''.\n\n====Changes to missionary service====\nIn 1982, the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] announced that the length of service of male full-time [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionaries]] would be reduced to 18 months. In 1984, a little more than two years later, it was announced that the length of service would be returned to its original length of 24 months.<ref>[http://www.dialoguejournal.com/excerpts/36-3a.asp Dialogue journal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050413132950/http://www.dialoguejournal.com/excerpts/36-3a.asp |date=2005-04-13 }}</ref>\n\nThe change was publicized as a way to increase the ability for missionaries to serve. At the time, missionaries paid for all their expenses in their country of service. Recession during the Carter presidency pushed inflation higher and the exchange rate lower. This sudden increase in costs together with already high costs of living in Europe and other industrialized nations resulted in a steady decline in the number of missionaries able to pay for two full years of service. The shortening of the required service time from 24 to 18 months cut off this decline in numbers, leveling out in the period following the reinstatement. For those in foreign missions, this was barely enough time to learn a more difficult language and difficulty with language was reported.\n\nNevertheless, the shortened period of time also affected numbers of conversions: they declined by 7% annually during the same period. Some also saw the shortening as a weakening of faithfulness among those who were eventually called as missionaries, less length meaning less commitment required in terms of faith. However, it has also been seen as a recognition by the leadership of changes within the LDS cultural climate.\n\nRecord economic growth starting in the mid-1980s mostly erased the problem of finances preventing service. As a secondary measure, starting in 1990, paying for a mission became easier on those called to work in industrialized nations. Missionaries began paying into a church-wide general missionary fund instead of paying on their own. This amount paid (about $425 per month currently) is used by the church to pay for the costs of all missionaries, wherever they go. This enabled those going to Bolivia, whose average cost of living is about $100 per month, to help pay for those going to Japan, whose cost tops out at around $900 per month.\n\n====Changes to church hierarchy structure====\n[[Priesthood Correlation Program]]:\n*During the 1960s, the Church aggressively pursued its earlier Correlation Program that had begun in 1908, which streamlined and centralized the structure of the Church. The program also increased Church control over viewpoints taught in local church meetings.\n*Priesthood editorial oversight of formerly priesthood-auxiliary-specific [[YMMIA]], [[YLMIA]], [[Relief Society]], [[Primary Association|Primary]], and [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] magazines.\n*Adoption of the [[Boy Scouts of America|Scouting]] program (1911)\n*Priesthood Committee on Outlines established for publishing lesson materials for each priesthood quorum\n*[[Melchizedek Priesthood]] handbook (1928)\n*Priesthood-Auxiliary movement (1928\u20131937): re-emphasized the church hierarchy around Priesthood, and re-emphasized other church organizations as \"priesthood auxiliaries\" with reduced autonomy.\n\nOther:\n*Elimination of Presiding Patriarch office\n*Emeritus status of general authorities who are too old or ill\n*Reorganizing the quorums of seventy\n*Dismantling ward and stake prayer circles (1978)\n\n===LDS multiculturalism===\nAs the church began to collide and meld with cultures outside of Utah and the United States, the church began to jettison some of the parochialisms and prejudices that had become part of Latter-day Saint culture, but were not essential to Mormonism. In 1971, LDS General Authority and scholar [[Bruce R. McConkie]] drew parallels between the LDS Church and the New Testament church, who had difficulty embracing the [[Gentiles]] within Christianity, and encouraged members not to be so indoctrinated with social customs that they fail to engage other cultures in Mormonism. Other peoples, he stated, \"have a different background than we have, which is of no moment to the Lord. ... It is no different to have different social customs than it is to have different languages. ... And the Lord knows all languages\".{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} In 1987, [[Boyd K. Packer]], another Latter-day Saint [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]], stated, \"We can't move [into various countries] with a 1947 Utah Church! Could it be that we are not prepared to take the gospel because we are not prepared to take (and they are not prepared to receive) all of the things we have wrapped up with it as extra baggage?\"<ref>21 [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]] 97 (Fall 1988)</ref>  During and after the [[civil rights movement]], the church faced a critical point in its history, where its previous attitudes toward other cultures and people of color, which had once been shared by much of the white American mainstream, began to appear racist and neocolonial. The church came under intense fire for its stances on blacks and Native Americans issues.\n\n====The church and blacks====\n{{Main|Blacks and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}\n\nThe cause of some of the church's most damaging publicity had to do with the church's policy of discrimination toward blacks. Blacks were always officially welcome in the church, and Joseph Smith established an early precedent of ordained black males to the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood]]. Smith was also anti-slavery, going so far as to run on an anti-slavery platform as candidate for the presidency of the United States. At times, however, Smith had shown sympathy toward a belief common in his day that blacks were the cursed descendants of [[Cain]]. In 1849, church doctrine taught that though blacks could be baptized, they and others could not be ordained to the Priesthood or enter [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS temples]]. Journal histories and public teachings of the time reflect that Young and others stated that God would some day reverse this policy of discrimination. <!--May need to move the following to Blacks and the Church article:  -->It is also important to note that while blacks as a whole were specifically withheld from priesthood blessings (although there were some exceptions to this policy in both the 1800s and 1900s), other races and genealogical lineages were also prohibited from holding the priesthood.\nBy the late 1960s, the Church had expanded into [[Brazil]], the [[Caribbean]], and the nations of [[Africa]], and was suffering criticism for its policy of racial discrimination. In the case of Africa and the Caribbean, the church had not yet begun large-scale missionary efforts in most areas. There were large groups in both Ghana and Nigeria who desired to join the church and many faithful members of African descent in Brazil. On June 9, 1978, under the administration of [[Spencer W. Kimball]], the church leadership finally received sanction to change the long-standing policy.<ref>[[Doctrine and Covenants]], OD-2</ref>\n\nToday, there are many black members of the church, and many predominantly black congregations. In the Salt Lake City area black members have organized branches of an official church auxiliary called the [[Genesis Group]]s.\n\n====The church and Native Americans====\n[[File:Baptism of Shivwits Indians.jpg|thumb|200px|Member of the [[Shivwits Band of Paiutes]], in 1875, being [[Baptism in Mormonism|baptized]] by [[LDS Church|Mormon Missionaries]].]]\nDuring the post-[[World War II]] period, the church also began to focus on expansion into a number of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures, as well as Oceanic cultures, which many Mormons considered to be the same ethnicity. These peoples were called \"Lamanites\", because they were all believed to descend from the [[Lamanite]] group in the ''[[Book of Mormon]]''. In 1947, the church began the [[Indian Placement Program]], where Native American students (upon request by their parents) were voluntarily placed in white Latter-day Saint foster homes during the school year, where they would attend public schools and become assimilated into Mormon culture.\n\nIn 1955, the church began ordaining black [[Melanesia]]ns to the [[Priesthood (Latter-day Saint)|Priesthood]].\n\nThe church's policy toward Native Americans also came under fire during the 1970s. In particular the Indian Placement Program was criticized as [[neocolonialism|neocolonial]]. In 1977, the U.S. government commissioned a study to investigate accusations that the church was using its influence to push children into joining the program. However, the commission rejected these accusations and found that the program was beneficial in many cases, and provided well-balanced American education for thousands, allowing the children to return to their cultures and customs. One issue was that the time away from family caused the assimilation of Native American students into American culture, rather than allowing the children to learn within, and preserve, their own culture. By the late 1980s, the program had been in decline, and in 1996, it was discontinued.  In 2016, three lawsuits against the LDS Church were filed in the Navajo Nation District Court, alleging that participants in the program were sexually abused in their foster homes.<ref name=atlantic>{{cite journal|last1=Fowler|first1=Lilly|title=Why Several Native Americans Are Suing the Mormon Church|journal=The Atlantic|date=23 October 2016|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/why-some-native-americans-are-suing-the-mormon-church/504944/|accessdate=13 November 2017}}</ref> The Church has asked for the lawsuits to be dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, arguing that the alleged abuse took place outside the reservation.<ref name=\"atlantic\" />\n\nIn 1981, the church published a new LDS edition of the [[Standard Works]] that changed a passage in ''The Book of Mormon'' that Lamanites (considered by many Latter-day Saints to be Native Americans) will \"become white and delightsome\" after accepting the gospel of Jesus Christ. Instead of continuing the original reference to skin color, the new edition replaced the word \"white\" with the word \"pure\", emphasizing inward spirituality.\n\n===Doctrinal reforms and influences===\n[[Good Neighbor policy (LDS Church)]] and temple ordinance reforms.\n\n<!--Influence of Roberts, Talmage, Widtsoe, and Joseph Fielding Smith-->\nBeginning soon after the turn of the 20th century, four influential Latter-day Saint scholars began to systematize, modernize, and codify Mormon doctrine: [[B. H. Roberts]], [[James E. Talmage]], [[John A. Widtsoe]], and [[Joseph Fielding Smith]].\n\nIn 1921, the church called chemistry professor John A. Widtsoe as an apostle. Widtsoe's writings, particularly ''Rational theology'' and ''Joseph Smith as Scientist'', reflected the optimistic faith in science and technology that was pervasive at the time in American life. According to Widtsoe, all Mormon theology could be reconciled within a rational, positivist framework.\n\n====Reaction to evolution====\n{{Main|Mormonism and evolution}}\nThe issue of evolution has been a point of controversy for some members of the church. The first [[1909 Statement on the Origin of the Earth and Man|official statement on the issue of evolution]] was in 1909, which marked the centennial of [[Charles Darwin]]'s birth and the 50th anniversary of his masterwork, ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. On that year, the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] led by [[Joseph F. Smith]] as President, issued a statement reinforcing the predominant religious view of [[creationism]], and calling human evolution one of the \"theories of men\", but falling short of declaring evolution untrue or evil. \"It is held by some\", they said, \"that Adam was not the first man upon the earth, and that the original human was a development from lower orders of the animal creation. These, however, are the theories of men.\" Notably, the church did not opine on the evolution of animals other than humans, nor did it endorse a particular theory of creationism.\n\nSoon after the 1909 statement, Joseph F. Smith professed in an editorial that \"the church itself has no philosophy about the ''modus operandi'' employed by the Lord in His creation of the world.\" ''[[Juvenile Instructor]]'', 46 (4), 208-209 (April 1911).\n\nSome also cite an additional editorial that enumerates various possibilities for creation including the idea that Adam and Eve: \n#\"evolved in natural processes to present perfection\", \n# were \"transplanted [to earth] from another sphere\" (''see, e.g., [[Adam-God theory]]''), or \n# were \"born here ... as other mortals have been.\" (''[[Improvement Era]]'' 13, 570 (April 1910)). \nProponents of evolution attribute this 1910 editorial to Joseph F. Smith and have sometimes identified it under the title \"First Presidency Instructions to the Priesthood: \"Origin of Man.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koffordbooks.com/evenson/Appendix%20TOC.pdf |title=Greg Kofford Books |publisher=Koffordbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref> However, others have cast doubt on Joseph F. Smith's authorship of the editorial, which was published without attribution and seems to have contradicted contemporary views published elsewhere by Joseph F. Smith himself.<ref>[http://ndbf.blogspot.com/2006/05/mormonism-and-evolution-authoritative.html No Death Before the Fall: Mormonism and Evolution: The Authoritative LDS Statements (review - part two, Appendix Document A)<!-- Bot generated title -->], at blogspot.com{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2011}}</ref> They also contend that there is little evidence that the editorial represents \"First Presidency Instructions\" as the title under which it is often cited indicates.\n\nIn 1925, as a result of publicity from the [[Scopes Trial|\"Scopes Monkey Trial\"]] concerning the right to teach evolution in [[Tennessee]] public schools, the First Presidency reiterated its 1909 stance, stating that \"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, basing its belief on divine revelation, ancient and modern, declares man to be the direct and lineal offspring of Deity. ... . Man is the child of God, formed in the divine image and endowed with divine attributes.\"\n\nIn the early 1930s there was an intense debate between liberal theologian and general authority B. H. Roberts and some members of the [[Council of the Twelve Apostles]] over attempts by B. H. Roberts to reconcile the fossil record with the scriptures by introducing a doctrine of pre-Adamic creation, and backing up this speculative doctrine using geology, biology, anthropology, and archeology (The Truth, The Way, The Life, pp.&nbsp;238\u2013240; 289-296). More conservative members of the Twelve Apostles, including Joseph Fielding Smith, rejected his speculation because it contradicted the idea that there was no death until after the fall of Adam. Scriptural references in the Book of Mormon such as 2 Nephi 2:22, Alma 12:23, and Doctrine and Covenants sec. 77:5-7 have been cited as teaching the doctrine that there was no death on the Earth before the Fall of Adam and Eve, and that the Earth's temporal existence consists of a total of seven thousand years (c.4,000 BC-c.2,000 AD). Some maintain that those scriptural references pertain to a spiritual death, although others disagree. It is clear, however, that the LDS church does not conform to the same young-Earth creationist creed as many other faiths. The church has made it quite clear that the six days of creation are not necessarily six 24-hour periods. Brigham Young definitely addressed the issue (Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [1971], 100), and even the very anti-evolution [[Bruce R. McConkie]] taught that a day, in the Creation accounts, \"is a specified time period; it is an age, an eon, a division of eternity; it is the time between two identifiable events. And each day, of whatever length, has the duration needed for its purposes. ... There is no revealed recitation specifying that each of the 'six days' involved in the Creation was of the same duration\".<ref>Bruce R. McConkie, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1982/06/christ-and-the-creation \u201cChrist and the Creation,\u201d], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', June 1982, p. 11.</ref> [[James E. Talmage]] published a book through the LDS Church that explicitly stated that organisms lived and died on this earth before the earth was fit for human habitation.<ref>Talmage, James E.

Grant]] as President, to conclude:\n\n{{quote|Upon the fundamental doctrines of the church we are all agreed. Our mission is to bear the message of the restored gospel to the world. Leave geology, biology, archaeology, and anthropology, no one of which has to do with the salvation of the souls of mankind, to scientific research, while we magnify our calling in the realm of the church. ... \n\nUpon one thing we should all be able to agree, namely, that Presidents Joseph F. Smith, John R. Winder, and Anthon H. Lund were right when they said: \"Adam is the primal parent of our race|First Presidency Minutes, Apr. 7, 1931.}}\n\nThe debate over pre-Adamites has been interpreted by LDS proponents of evolution as a debate about organic evolution. This view, based on the belief that a dichotomy of thought on the subject of evolution existed between B. H. Roberts and Joseph Fielding Smith, has become common among pro-evolution members of the church. As a result, the ensuing 1931 statement has been interpreted by some as official permission for members to believe in organic evolution.[http://ndbf.net/eom.htm] However, there is no evidence that the debate included the topic of evolution, and historically there was no strong disagreement between Joseph Fielding Smith and B. H. Roberts concerning evolution; they both rejected it, although to different degrees. B. H. Roberts wrote that the \"hypothesis\" of organic evolution was \"destructive of the grand, central truth of all revelation,\" (The Gospel and Man's Relationship to Deity, 7th edition, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1928, pp.&nbsp;265\u2013267).\n\nLater, [[Joseph Fielding Smith]] published his book ''Man: His Origin and Destiny'', which denounced evolution without qualification. Similar statements of denunciation were made by [[Bruce R. McConkie]], who as late as 1980 denounced evolution as one of \"the seven deadly heresies\" (BYU [[Fireside (LDS Church)|Fireside]], June 1, 1980), and stated: \"There are those who say that revealed religion and organic evolution can be harmonized. This is both false and devilish.\" Evolution was also denounced by the conservative [[Ezra Taft Benson]], who as an Apostle called on members to use the Book of Mormon to combat evolution and several times denounced evolution as a \"falsehood\" on a par with [[socialism]], [[rationalism]], and [[humanism]]. (Ezra Taft Benson, Conference Report, April 5, 1975).\n\nA dichotomy of opinion exists among some church members today. Largely influenced by Smith, McConkie, and Benson, evolution is rejected by a large number of conservative church members.<ref>[http://www.weaverresearch.org/evolution.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606224543/http://www.weaverresearch.org/evolution.htm |date=June 6, 2014 }}</ref> A minority accept evolution, supported in part by the debate between B.

These manuscripts were presumed lost in the Chicago fire of 1871. Analyzed by Egyptologists, the manuscripts were identified by some as ''The [[Book of the Dead]]'', an ancient Egyptian funery text. Moreover, the scholars' translations of certain portions of the scrolls disagreed with Smith's translation. This discovery forced many Mormon apologists to moderate the earlier prevailing view that Smith's translations were literal one-to-one translations. As a result of this discovery, some Mormon apologists consider ''The Book of the Dead'' to be a starting-point that Smith used to reconstruct the original writings of Abraham through inspiration.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the apparent discovery of an early Mormon manuscript, which came to be known as the \"Salamander Letter\", received much publicity. This letter, reportedly discovered by a scholar named Mark Hofmann, alleged that the ''Book of Mormon'' was given to Joseph Smith by a being that changed itself into a [[salamander]], not by an angel as the official Church history recounted. <!--Comment about Church reaction and apologetic explanations--> The document was purchased by private collector Steven Christensen, but was still significantly publicized and even printed in the Church's official magazine, the ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]''. Some Mormon apologists including [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Dallin H. Oaks]] suggested that the letter used the idea of a salamander as a metaphor for an angel. The document, however, was revealed as a forgery in 1985, and Hofmann was arrested for two murders related to his forgeries.\n\nNot all of Hofmann's findings have been deemed fraudulent. A document called the 'Anthon transcript' that allegedly contains [[reformed Egyptian]] characters from the Book of Mormon plates is still in dispute, although the characters have been highly circulated both by the Church and other individuals. Due to Hofmann's methods, the authenticity of many of the documents he sold to the Church and the Smithsonian will likely never be sorted out.\n\n====Mormon dissidents and scholars====\nIn 1989, [[George P. Lee]], a [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] member of the First [[Seventy (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Seventy]] who had participated in the [[Indian Placement Program]] in his youth, was excommunicated. The church action occurred not long after he had submitted to the Church a 23-page letter critical of the program and the effect it had on Native American culture. In October 1994, Lee confessed to, and was convicted of, sexually molesting a 13-year-old girl in 1989. It is not known if church leaders had knowledge of this crime during the excommunication process.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the administration of [[Ezra Taft Benson]] formed what it called the [[Strengthening Church Members Committee]], to keep files on potential church dissidents and collect their published material for possible later use in church disciplinary proceedings. The existence of this committee was first publicized by an anti-Mormon ministry in 1991, when it was referred to in a memo dated July 19, 1990 leaked from the office of the church's Presiding Bishopric.\n\nAt the 1992 [[Sunstone Magazine|Sunstone Symposium]], dissident Mormon scholar [[Lavina Fielding Anderson]] accused the Committee of being \"an internal espionage system,\" which prompted [[Brigham Young University]] professor and moderate Mormon scholar [[Eugene England]] to \"accuse that committee of undermining the Church,\" a charge for which he later publicly apologized.<ref>Letter to the Editor, ''[[Sunstone Magazine|Sunstone]]'', March 1993.</ref> The publicity concerning the statements of Anderson and England, however, prompted the church to officially acknowledge the existence of the Committee.<ref>\"Mormon Church keeps files on its dissenters,\" ''St. Petersburg Times'', Aug. 15, 1992, at 6e.</ref> The Church explained that the Committee \"provides local church leadership with information designed to help them counsel with members who, however well-meaning, may hinder the progress of the church through public criticism.\"<ref>\"Secret Files,\" ''New York Times'', Aug. 22, 1992.</ref>\n\nThe First Presidency also issued a statement on August 22, 1992, explaining its position that the Committee had precedent and was justified based on a reference to [[Doctrine and Covenants|D&C]] (LDS) Sec. 123, written while Joseph Smith was imprisoned in [[Liberty, Missouri]], suggesting that a committee be formed to record and document acts of persecution against the church by the people of Missouri.\n\nOfficial concern about the work of dissident scholars within the church led to the excommunication or disfellowshipping of six such scholars, dubbed the [[September Six]], in September 1993.<ref>\"Six intellectuals disciplined for apostasy.\" ''[[Sunstone Magazine|Sunstone]]'', November 1993, 65-73.</ref>\n\n====Changing doctrinal focus====\nThe church has always been against the creation, distribution and viewing of pornography. Gordon B. Hinckley had been known to say that pornography is as addictive as the worst drugs.<ref>Lynn Arave \"LDS urged to boost worthiness\" ''[[Deseret News]]'' May 19, 2004</ref> He often talked of what a shame it is to use such great resources (such as the internet) for such material.\n\n===Latter-day Saint public relations===\n[[Image:Logo of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (pre-1995).png|thumb|140px|Pre-1995 LDS Church logo]]\nBy the 1960s and 1970s, as a consequence of its massive, international growth in the post-[[World War II]] era, the church was no longer primarily a Utah-based church, but a worldwide organization. The church, mirroring the world around it, felt the disunifying strains of alien cultures and diverse points of view that had brought an end to the idealistic modern age. At the same time, the [[postmodernity|postmodern]] world was increasingly skeptical of traditional religion and authority, and driven by mass-media and public image. These influences awoke within the church a new self-consciousness. The church could no longer rest quietly upon its fundamentals and history. It felt a need to sell its image to an increasingly jaded public, to jettison some of its Utah-based parochialism, to control and manage Mormon scholarship that might present an unfavorable image of the church, and to alter its organization to cope with its size and cultural diversity, while preserving centralized control of Latter-day Saint doctrine, practice, and culture.\n\nThus, the church underwent a number of important changes in organization, practices, and meeting schedule. In addition, the church became more media-savvy, and more self-conscious and protective of its public image. The church also became more involved in public discourse, using its new-found political and cultural influence and the media to affect its image, public morality, and Mormon scholarship, and to promote its missionary efforts. At the same time, the church struggled with how to deal with increasingly pluralistic voices within the church and within Mormonism. In general, this period has seen both an increase in cultural and racial diversity and extra-faith [[ecumenism]], and a decrease in intra-faith [[religious pluralism|pluralism]].\n\nUntil the church's rapid growth after World War II, it had been seen in the eyes of the general public as a backward, non- or vaguely Christian polygamist cult in Utah &mdash; an image that interfered with proselyting efforts. As the church's size began to merit new visibility in the world, the church seized upon the opportunity to re-define its public image, and to establish itself in the public mind as a mainstream Christian faith. At the same time, the church became publicly involved in numerous ecumenical and welfare projects that continue to serve as the foundation of its ecumenism today.\n\nIn the 1960s the Church formed the Church Information Service with the goal of being ready to respond to media inquiries and generate positive media coverage. The organization kept a photo file to provide photos to the media for such events as Temple dedications. It also would work to get stories covering [[Family Home Evening]], the Church welfare plan and the Church's youth activities in various publications.<ref>[[Richard O. Cowan]]. ''The Church in the 20th Century'' (Bookcraft: Salt Lake City, 1985) p. 289</ref>\n\nAs part of the church's efforts to re-position its image as that of a mainstream religion, the church began to moderate its earlier anti-[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] rhetoric. In Elder [[Bruce R. McConkie]]'s 1958 edition of ''[[Mormon Doctrine (book)|Mormon Doctrine]]'', he had stated his unofficial opinion that the Catholic Church was part of \"the church of the devil\" and \"the great and abominable church\" because it was among organizations that misled people away from following God's laws. In his 1966 edition of the same book, the specific reference to the Catholic Church was removed.<ref>See generally: [[Armand L. Mauss]], ''The Angel and the Beehive: The Mormon Struggle with Assimilation'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1994); Gordon Sheperd & Gary Sheperd, \"Mormonism in Secular Society: Changing Patterns in Official Ecclesiastical Rhetoric,\" ''Review of Religious Research'' 26 (Sept. 1984): 28-42.</ref>\n\nThe first routinized system for teaching church principles to potential proselytes had been created in 1953 and named \"A Systematic Program for Teaching the Gospel\". In 1961, this system was enhanced, expanded, and renamed \"A Uniform System for Teaching Investigators\". This new system, in the form of a hypothetical dialogue with a fictional character named \"Mr. Brown\", included intricate details for what to say in almost every situation. These routinized missionary discussions would be further refined in 1973 and 1986, and then de-emphasized in 2003.\n\nIn 1973, the church recast its missionary discussions, making them more family-friendly and focused on building on common Christian ideals. The new discussions, named \"A Uniform System for Teaching Families\", de-emphasized the [[Great Apostasy]], which previously held a prominent position just after the story of the [[First Vision]]. When the discussions were revised in the early 1980s, the new discussions dealt with the apostasy less conspicuously, and in later discussions, rather than in the first discussion. The discussions also became more family-friendly, including a flip chart with pictures, in part to encourage the participation of children.\n\nAccording to Riess and Tickle, early Mormons rarely quoted from the Book of Mormon in their speeches and writings. It was not until the 1980s that it was cited regularly in speeches given by LDS Church leaders at the semiannual [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conferences]]. In 1982, the LDS Church subtitled the Book of Mormon \"another testament of Jesus Christ.\" LDS leader [[Boyd K. Packer]] stated that the scripture now took its place \"beside the Old Testament and the New Testament.<ref>\"[http://www.ldschurchnews.com/articles/18111/Since-1982-subtitle-has-defined-book-as-another-testament-of-Jesus-Christ.html Since 1982, subtitle has defined book as 'another testament of Jesus Christ']\", 2 January 1988, ''[[Church News]]''</ref>  Riess and Tickle assert that the introduction of this subtitle was inteneded to emphasize the Christ-centered nature of the Book of Mormon.  They assert that the LDS \"rediscovery of the Book of Mormon in the late twentieth century is strongly connected to their renewed emphasis on the person and nature of Jesus Christ.\"<ref name=RiessTickle>{{Citation |title=The book of Mormon: selections annotated & explained |first1=Jana |last1=Riess |first2=Phyllis |last2=Tickle |publisher=SkyLight Paths Publishing |year=2005 |pages=xiii-xiv |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zwUA8GC-HMkC&pg=PR14&dq=Mormonism+disingenuous#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-1-59473-076-4}}</ref>\n\n== Post-modern era (1995-Present) ==\n[[Image:Logo of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.svg|thumb|200px|Current LDS Church logo]]\nIn 1995, the church announced a new logo design that emphasized the words \"JESUS CHRIST\" in large capital letters, and de-emphasized the words \"The Church of\" and \"of Latter-day Saints\". According to Bruce L. Olsen, director of public affairs for the church, \"The logo re-emphasizes the official name of the church and the central position of the Savior in its theology. It stresses our allegiance to the Lord, Jesus Christ.\"\n\nOn January 1, 2000, the First Presidency and the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] released a proclamation entitled \"[[The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles]]\". This document commemorated the birth of Jesus and set forth the church's official view regarding Christ.\n\nIn 2001, the church sent out a press release encouraging reporters to use the full name of the church at the beginning of news articles, with following references to the \"Church of Jesus Christ\". The release discouraged the use of the term \"Mormon Church\".\n\nCooperation with other churches:\n*The church has opened its broadcasting facilities (Bonneville International) to other Christian groups, and has participated in the VISN Religious Interfaith Cable Television Network.\n*The church has participated in numerous joint humanitarian efforts with other churches.\n*The church has agreed not to baptize Holocaust victims by proxy\n\nThe church and the Information Age: This would include topics like how the church seeks to battle pornography, its use of the internet, its battle to control its public image, broadcasting the Nauvoo temple dedication, appearances on Larry King Live, and so on.\n\nThe church in the media:\n*Official press releases [http://www.newsroom.lds.org]\n*Explanations of basic beliefs found at [http://www.lds.org lds.org] and [http://www.mormon.org mormon.org]\n*''Homefront''\n*''Our Heavenly Father's Plan'', ''Together Forever'', ''What is Real'', ''Prodigal Son'', and so on.\n*Legacy, and so on.\n*Hinckley's appearances on ''[[Larry King Live]]''\n*Communication with foreign countries to allow entry of missionaries\n*Broadcasting the Nauvoo temple dedication\nIn 2004, the Church endorsed an amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] banning marriage except between a man and a woman. The Church also announced its opposition to political measures that \"confer legal status on any other sexual relationship\" than a \"man and a woman lawfully wedded as husband and wife.\" (\"First Presidency Statement on Same-Gender Marriage\", October 19, 2004).\n\nOn November 5, 2015, an update letter to LDS Church leaders for the [[Handbook (LDS Church)|Church Handbook]] was leaked. The policy banned a \"child of a parent living in a same-gender relationship\" from [[Naming and blessing of children|baby blessings]], [[Baptism in Mormonism|baptism]], [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|confirmation]], [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood ordination]], and [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary service]] until the child was not living with their homosexual parent(s), was \"of legal age\", and \"disavow[ed] the practice of same-gender cohabitation and marriage\", in addition to receiving approval from the Office of the First Presidency. The policy update also added that entering a same-sex marriage as a type of \"apostasy\", mandating a [[disciplinary council]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite news|last1=Shill|first1=Aaron|title=LDS Church reaffirms doctrine of marriage, updates policies on families in same-sex marriages|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865640835/Church-updates-policies-on-families-in-same-sex-marriages.html?pg=all|accessdate=12 November 2016|agency=Deseret News|date=5 Nov 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"The Washington Post\">{{cite news|last1=Bailey|first1=Sarah Pulliam|title=Mormon Church to exclude children of same-sex couples from getting blessed and baptized until they are 18|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/11/05/mormon-church-to-exclude-children-of-same-sex-couples-from-getting-blessed-and-baptized-until-they-are-18/|accessdate=12 November 2016|publisher=The Washington Post|date=11 Nov 2016}}</ref> The next day, in a video interview, D.

White]], [[William Miller (preacher)]] and [[Joseph Bates (Adventist)]] began to study eschatological implications revealed in the [[Book of Daniel]] and the [[Book of Revelation]]. Their interpretation of Christian eschatology resulted in the founding of the [[Seventh-day Adventist church]].\n\n==Approaches to prophetic interpretation==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2012}}\nThe following approaches arose from the study of Christianity's most central eschatological document, the [[Book of Revelation]], but the principles embodied in them can be applied to all prophecy in the [[Bible]]. They are by no means mutually exclusive and are often combined to form a more complete and coherent interpretation of prophetic passages. Most interpretations fit into one, or a combination, of these approaches.\n\n===Preterism===\n[[Preterism]] (from the Latin ''praeteritus,'' meaning \"gone by\") is an approach which sees prophecy as chiefly being fulfilled in the past, especially (in the case of the Book of Revelation) during the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century]].<ref>David Chilton, 'The Days of Vengeance: An Exposition of the Book of Revelation', 1987.</ref> Prophecies in general, therefore, have already been fulfilled. In particular, many Preterists (whether they be Full Preterists or Partial Preterists) view The Book of Revelation as a text employing symbols in its communication of prophecy to the Early Church regarding the actors and events involved during the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem in the year 70 AD]]. Other Preterists consider the Book of Revelation to be a symbolic prophetic presentation of the struggle of Christianity to survive the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecutions of the Roman Empire]]. There are two major views within Preterism, that of [[Partial preterism]] (that many of the Bible's prophecies were fulfilled during the life and time of Jesus and the Early Church) and [[Full preterism#Full preterism|Full preterism]], (that all of the Bible's prophecies were fulfilled during the life and time of Jesus and the Early Church). Preterist beliefs usually have a close association with [[Amillennialism]], the belief that the Millennial reign of Christ began during the establishment of the Early Church. Preterists usually consider events such as the [[Great Tribulation]] as having occurred during the siege and destruction of Jerusalem from 66-70. Early Preterist theologians included [[Eusebius]]<ref>Eusebius of Caeserea, 'Demonstratio Evangelica', 312.</ref> and [[John Chrysostom]].<ref>John Chrysostom, 'Homolies on Matthew 24', 387.</ref>\n\n===Historicism===\n[[Historicism (Christianity)|Historicism]] is an approach which sees prophecy as being fulfilled in the past, present and future, including (in the case of the Book of Revelation) during the previous two millennia. In particular, many Historists view The Book of Revelation as a text employing symbols in its communication of prophecy to the Elect Church regarding the actors and events involved during the Great Controversy. Specifically, Historists consider the Book of Revelation to be a symbolic prophetic presentation of the struggle of Protestantism to survive the continuing persecutions of the Papacy. Historists usually consider events such as the [[Great Tribulation]] as having occurred during the period of absolute papal supremacy from 538-1798.\n\nThe subject of the Revelation to John the apostle was large and complex mostly covering the things which should happen thereafter. The vision covers the combined secular and ecclesiastical history of Christendom describing the grand political changes of the Roman world along with the ecclesiastical purity or corruptions of doctrine and general apostasy of the church and its persecutions of the saints which are the true people of God.<ref name = \"ElliottV1\">{{Citation | first = Edward Bishop | last = Elliott | author-link = Edward Bishop Elliott | title = [[Horae Apocalypticae]] | publisher = Seely, Jackson and Halliday | place = London | edition = 5th | volume = Vol. I | year = 1862}}</ref>{{rp|100\u2013101}}\n\nAccording to E.B. Elliott, the first six seals of the book of Revelation outline the temporary prosperity of the Empire of heathen Rome followed by its decline and fall which covers the time period A.D. 96 \u2013 396. The first seal, as revealed to John by the angel, was to signify what was to happen soon after John seeing the visions in Patmos and that the second, third and fourth seals in like manner were to have commencing dates each in chronological sequence following the preceding seal.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|119,121,122}}\n\n===Futurism===\nIn [[Futurism (Christianity)|Futurism]], parallels may be drawn with historical events, but most eschatological prophecies are chiefly referring to events which have not yet been fulfilled, but will take place at the end of the age and the [[End time|end of the world]]. Most prophecies will be fulfilled during a global time of chaos known as the [[Great Tribulation]] and afterwards.<ref>Chuck Missler, 'Prophecy 20/20: Profiling the Future Through the Lens of Scripture', 2006.</ref> Futurist beliefs usually have a close association with [[Premillennialism]] and [[Dispensationalism]]. Futurist beliefs were presented in the [[Left Behind]] series.\n\n===Idealism===\nIn [[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Idealism]], also known as \"spiritual\" or \"nonliteral\" approach, the Book of Revelation and other eschatological materials are interpreted [[symbol]]ically.  Different authors may interpret the judgements and resurrections on a more [[Christian existentialism|existential level]], argue that the Beast and Babylon represent a variety of social injustices ([[Christian anarchism|including any corrupt or even all mortal governments]]), or view the recreation of the earth and the establishment of the kingdom of heaven as [[Social Gospel|the general improvement of society]].\n\n=== Comparison of Futurist, Preterist and Historicist beliefs ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:10%;\"|Eschatological Topic\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|Futurist belief\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|Preterist belief<ref>David Chilton, 'The Days of Vengeance: An Exposition of the Book of Revelation', Dominion Press, 2006.</ref>\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|Historicist belief<ref>SDA Bible Commentary</ref>\n|- style=\"text-align:left; background:#ffffec; vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|Futurists typically anticipate a future period of time when Bible prophecies will be fulfilled.\n|Preterists typically argue that most (Partial Preterism), or all (Full Preterism) Bible prophecies were fulfilled during the earthly ministry of Jesus and the generation immediately proceeding it, concluding with the siege and destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD.\n|Historicists typically understand the prophecies to be continuous from the times of the prophets to the present day and beyond.\n|- style=\"text-align:left; background:#ffffec; vertical-align:top;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|'The 144,000' <br> {{bibleverse||Revelation|7:1-8}}\n|Various interpretations of a literal number of 144,000, including: 144,000 Evangelical Jews at the end of the world, or 144,000 Christians at the end of the world.\n|A symbolic number signifying the saved, representing completeness, perfection (The number of Israel; 12, squared and multiplied by 1,000, representing the infinite = 144,000).

The [[Sadducees]], who recognized only the [[Torah]] (first five books of the Old Testament) as authoritative, did not believe in an afterlife or any resurrection of the dead. The [[Pharisees]], who not only accepted the Torah, but [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|additional scriptures as well]], believed in the [[Resurrection of the Dead#Judaism|resurrection of the dead]], and it is known to have been a major point of contention between the two groups (see {{bibleverse||Acts|23:8}}). The Pharisees based their belief on passages such as {{bibleverse||Daniel|12:2}}, which says: \"Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt.\"\n\n===The intermediate state===\n{{main|Intermediate state}}\nSome traditions (notably the Seventh-day Adventists) teach that the [[soul sleep]]s after death, and will not awake again until the [[resurrection of the dead]], while others believe the spirit goes to an intermediate place where it will live consciously until the resurrection of the dead. By \"soul\", Seventh-day Adventists theologians mean the physical person (monism), and that no component of human nature survives death; therefore, each human will be \"recreated\" at resurrection. The Biblical [[Book of Ezekiel]] provides substantiation for the assertion that souls experience mortality, \u201cBehold, all souls are Mine; The soul of the father As well as the soul of the son is Mine; The soul who sins shall die.\" (Ezekiel 18:4) <ref>{{cite web|title=Ezekiel 18:4|url=https://biblia.com/books/nkjv/Eze18.4|website=Biblia.com|publisher=Faithlife.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' says:\n:Each man receives his eternal retribution in his [[immortal soul]] at the very moment of his death, in a [[particular judgment]] that refers his life to Christ: either entrance into the blessedness of [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]] -- through a [[Purgatory|purification]] or immediately -- or immediate and everlasting [[damnation]]. (Sect. 1022)\n\n===Purgatory===\n{{main|Purgatory}}\nSome denominations (a notable exception are [[Seventh-day Adventists]]) affirm the statement from the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' (above), with the exception of the parenthetical phrase, \"through a purification or immediately\". This alludes to the Catholic belief in a spiritual state, known as Purgatory, in which those souls who are not condemned to Hell, but are also not completely pure as required for entry into Heaven, go through a final process of purification before their full acceptance into Heaven.\n\nEastern Orthodoxy and Protestantism do not believe in Purgatory as such, though the Orthodox Church is willing to allow for a period of continued sanctification (the process of being made pure, or holy) after death. Most Protestants reject the doctrine of Purgatory on the basis that first, Christ has already made full atonement for our sins on the cross, thereby removing all obstacles which prevent us from coming directly into the presence of God after death; and second, it is not found in the [[Protesant Bible]].\n\n== Resurrection of the dead ==\n{{Main|Resurrection of the dead#Christianity}}\n{{Original research section|date=April 2015}}\n\n===The Doctrine of the Resurrection Predates Christianity===\n\nThe word ''resurrection'' comes from the Latin ''resurrectus,'' which is the past participle of ''resurgere,'' meaning ''to rise again.'' Although the doctrine of the resurrection comes to the forefront in the New Testament, it predates the Christian era. There is an apparent reference to the resurrection in the book of Job, where Job says, \"I know that my redeemer lives, and that he will stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though... worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh I will see God.\" [Job 19:25-27] Again, the prophet Daniel writes, \"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, some to shame and everlasting contempt.\" [Dan 12:2] Isaiah says: \"Your dead will live. Together with my dead body, they will arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in dust, for your dew is like the dew of herbs, and the earth will cast out the dead\". [Isa. 26:19]\n\nThis belief was still common among the Jews in New Testament times, as exemplified by the passage which relates the raising of Lazarus from the dead. When Jesus told Lazarus' sister, Martha, that Lazarus would rise again, she replied, \"I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\" [Jn 11:24] Also, one of the two main branches of the Jewish religious establishment, the Pharisees, believed in and taught the future resurrection of the body. [cf Acts 23:1-8]\n\n===Two Resurrections===\n{{main|Resurrection of the dead#Two resurrections of the dead}}\nAn interpretation of the New Testament is the understanding that there will be two resurrections. Revelation says: \"Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such, the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with him a thousand years.\" [Rev 20:6] The rest of the dead \"did not live again until the thousand years were finished\". [Rev 20:5]\n\nDespite this, there are various interpretations: \n:According to the premillennial post-tribulational position there will two physical resurrections, separated by a literal thousand years (one in the Second Coming along with the [[Rapture]], another after a literal 1,000 year reign); \n:According to premillennial pre-tribulationists there will be three physical resurrections more (one in the Rapture at the beginning of tribulation, another in the Second Coming at the final of tribulation, the last one after a literal 1,000 year reign), they claim that the ''first resurrection'' includes the resurrection in the Rapture and the resurrection in the Second Coming, the ''second resurrection'' would be after the 1,000 year reign;\n:According to premillennial mid-tribulationists there will be three physical resurrections too (one in the rapture at the middle of tribulation, another in the Second Coming at the finale of tribulation, the last one after a literal 1,000 year reign), the ''first resurrection'' would be the resurrection in the Rapture and the resurrection in the Second Coming, the ''second resurrection'' would be after the 1,000 year reign.\n:According to amillennial position there will be only two resurrections, the ''first resurrection'' would be in a spiritual sense (the resurrection of the soul), according to Paul and John as participation right now, in the resurrection of Christ, through faith and baptism, according to Colossians 2:12 and Colossians 3:1 as occurring within the millennium interpreted as an indefinite period between the foundation of the Church and the Second Coming of Christ, the ''second resurrection'' would be the general resurrection (the resurrection of the body) that would occur at the time of Jesus' return.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120120.htm The City of God (Book XX)] by St. Augustine Chapter 6.\u2014 What is the First Resurrection, and What the Second.</ref>\n\n===The Resurrection Body===\n\nThe Gospel authors wrote that our resurrection bodies will be different from those we have now. Jesus said, \"In the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels of God in heaven.\" [Mt 22:30] Paul adds, \"So also is the resurrection of the dead: the body\u2026 is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.\" [1 Co. 15:42-44]\n\nIn some ancient traditions, it was held that the person would be resurrected at the same spot they died and were buried at (just as in the case of Jesus' resurrection). For example, in the early medieval biography of [[St Columba]] written by [[Adomnan of Iona]], Columba at one point prophecies to a penitent at the monastery on [[Iona]] that his resurrection would be in Ireland and not in Iona, and this penitent later died at a monastery in Ireland and was buried there <ref>Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin books, 1995, p 193</ref>\n\n===Other views===\n\nAccording to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] the body after resurrection is changed into a spiritual, imperishable body:\n\n::[999] Christ is raised with his own body: \"See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself\"; [553] but he did not return to an earthly life. So, in him, \"all of them will rise again with their own bodies which they now bear,\" but Christ \"will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body,\" into a \"spiritual body\" [554]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a11.htm|title=CCC - PART 1 SECTION 2 CHAPTER 3 ARTICLE 11|website=www.vatican.va}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Martin Luther]] personally believed and taught resurrection of the dead in combination with [[soul sleep]], this is not a mainstream teaching of [[Lutheranism]] and most Lutherans traditionally believe in resurrection of the body in combination with the [[immortal soul]].<ref>Evangelical Lutheran intelligencer: Volume 5 -1830  Page 9 Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Maryland and Virginia \"Every one of those committed to our care is possessed of an immortal soul and should we not exceedingly rejoice, that we in the hands of the Supreme Being, may be instrumental in leading them unto \"fountains of living water.\"</ref>\n\nEarly-20th-century American preacher [[Billy Sunday]] epitomizes the Evangelical focus on \"going to heaven\" in his [[sermon]] \"Heaven: A Wonderful Place; Where There is No More Death; Blessed Hope of the Christian.\" In the message Sunday characteristically explained the feelings of his audience by saying \"Everybody wants to go to Heaven. We are all curious.

In this school of thought, the dead remain dead (and do not immediately progress to a [[Heaven]], [[Hell]], or [[Purgatory]]) until a physical resurrection of some or all of the dead occurs at the end of time. Some groups, [[Christadelphians]] in particular, consider that it is not a [[universal resurrection]], and that at this time of resurrection that the [[Last Judgment]] will take place.<ref>Ashton, Michael.

Jesus said that at the time of his coming, \"There will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever will be. And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect's sake, those days will be shortened.\" [Mt 24:21-22]\n\nFurthermore, the [[Messiah]]'s return and the tribulation that accompanies it will come at a time when people are not expecting it:\n\n::Of that day and hour no-one knows; no, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only. But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. [Mt 24:36-39]\n\nPaul echoes this theme, saying, \"For when they say, 'Peace and safety!' then sudden destruction comes upon them.\" [1 Thess 5:3]\n\n===The Abomination of Desolation===\n{{Main|Abomination of desolation}}\nThe abomination of desolation (or desolating sacrilege) is a term found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in the [[book of Daniel]]. The term is used by [[Jesus Christ]] in the [[Olivet discourse]], according to both the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Mark]]. In the Matthew account, Jesus is presented as quoting Daniel explicitly.\n\n: Matthew 24:15-26 ([[English Standard Version|ESV]]) \"So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.\"\n\n: Mark 13:14 (ESV) \"But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not to be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.\"\n\nThis verse in the Olivet Discourse also occurs in the [[Gospel of Luke]].\n\n: Luke 21.20-21 (ESV) \"But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near.

The key to this understanding is the \"seventy weeks prophecy\" in the book of Daniel. The Prophecy of Seventy Septets (or literally 'seventy times seven') appears in the angel [[Gabriel]]'s reply to Daniel, beginning with verse 22 and ending with verse 27 in the ninth chapter of the [[Book of Daniel]],<ref>Scherman, Rb. (Ed.), 2001, p.1803</ref> a work included in both the [[Jewish]] [[Tanakh]] and the [[Christian]] [[Bible]]; as well as the [[Septuagint]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/nets/edition/40-daniel-nets.pdf |title=A New English Translation of the Septuagint. 40. Daniel |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-08-15}}</ref> The [[prophecy]] is part of both the [[Jewish]] account of history and Christian eschatology.\n\nThe prophet has a vision of the angel Gabriel, who tells him, \"Seventy weeks are determined for your people and for your holy city (i.e., Israel and Jerusalem).\" [Dan 9:24] After making a comparison with events in the history of Israel, many scholars have concluded that each day in the seventy weeks represents a year. The first sixty-nine weeks are interpreted as covering the period until Christ's first coming, but the last week is thought to represent the years of the tribulation which will come at the end of this age, directly preceding the millennial age of peace:\n\n::The people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end of it will be with a flood, and till the end of the war, desolations are determined. Then he will confirm a covenant with many for one week. But in the middle of the week, he will bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations will be one who makes desolate, even until the consummation which is determined is poured out on the desolate. [Dan 9:26-27]\n\nThis is an obscure prophecy, but in combination with other passages, it has been interpreted to mean that the \"prince who is to come\" will make a seven-year covenant with Israel that will allow the rebuilding of the temple and the reinstitution of sacrifices, but \"in the middle of the week\", he will break the agreement and set up an idol of himself in the temple and force people to worship it\u2014the \"abomination of desolation\". Paul writes:\n\n::Let no-one deceive you by any means, for that day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.

The church has long professed to look to the Saviour's advent as the consummation of her hopes. Now the great deceiver will make it appear that Christ has come. In different parts of the earth, Satan will manifest himself among men as a majestic being of dazzling brightness, resembling the description of the Son of God given by John in the Revelation.

And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.\" [Rev 19:7-8] Christ is represented throughout Revelation as \"the Lamb\", symbolizing the giving of his life as an atoning sacrifice for the people of the world, just as lambs were sacrificed on the altar for the sins of Israel. His \"wife\" appears to represent the people of God, for she is dressed in the \"righteous acts of the saints\". As the marriage takes place, there is a great celebration in heaven which involves a \"great multitude.\" [Rev 19:6]\n\n===Armageddon===\n{{Main|Armageddon}}\nThe [[Book of Revelation]] states: \"I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And he who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and with righteousness he judges and makes war.\" [Rev 19:11] We now see Christ, not as a lamb, but as a warrior, ready to make war against the forces of evil. There is a passage in Zechariah which is identified with this event: \"I will gather all the nations to battle against Jerusalem. The city will be taken, the houses looted, and the women raped\u2026 Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations\u2026 Thus the Lord my God will come, and all the saints with you.\" [Zech 14:2-5] In Matthew, Jesus says, \"The sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.\" [Mt 24:30]\n\nThe [[Heavenly Host|army of heaven]] is described in similar terms as the resurrected and raptured believers: \"The armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed him on white horses.\"[Rev 19:14] Revelation continues: \"I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse and against his army.\" [Rev 19:19] Isaiah also speaks of such a battle: \"The Lord will come with fire and with his chariots, like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire and by his sword the Lord will judge all flesh, and the slain of the Lord will be many.\" [Is. 66:15-16]\n\n==The Millennium==\n{{Main|Millennialism}}\nIn the end, according to Revelation, the Lamb and his armies are victorious and the [[Beast of Revelation|Beast]], generally identified as the Antichrist, is captured and thrown into the [[lake of fire]], while his battle casualties are left as food for the birds. [[Satan]], the spiritual driving force behind the beast and his armies, is imprisoned:\n\n::I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. And he cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished. [Rev 20:1-3]\n\nWhile Revelation speaks of a thousand-year segment of Christ's rule on Earth, there are numerous other prophecies in both testaments concerning a future age of peace. Isaiah speaks of such a time and describes it in Edenic terms ([[Isaiah 11]]):\n\n::The wolf will dwell with the lamb; the leopard will lie down with the young goat; the calf, and the young lion, and the yearling together, and a little child will lead them. The cow and the bear will graze; their young ones will lie down together; and the lion will eat straw like the ox. The nursing child will play by the cobra's hole; and the weaned child will put his hand in the viper's den. They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea. [Isaiah 11:5-9]\n\nJust as the physical bodies of people are changed into spiritual bodies in the resurrection (see above), so Isaiah implies that animals will undergo a transformation which enables them to live in peace with human beings and with each other. There is no more killing, either in the human or the animal kingdoms. God reverses the covenant made with Noah in which he said, \"The fear and the dread of you will be on every beast of the earth, on every bird of the air, on all that moves on the earth, and on all the fish of the sea.\" [Gen 9:2] If the passage in Isaiah is interpreted literally, a return to the vegetarian diet of Eden seems to be a natural conclusion. [cf Gen 1:29-30]\n\nMicah expresses similarly lofty thoughts, adding that Jerusalem will be the Lord's capital in those days:\n\n::Out of Zion the word of the law will go forth, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. He will judge between many peoples, and rebuke strong nations afar off. They will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war any more. But everyone will sit under his vine and under his fig tree, and no one will make them afraid. [Micah 4:2-4]\n\n==The End of the World and the Last Judgment==\n\n===Satan released===\nAccording to the Bible, the Millennial age of peace all but closes the history of planet Earth. However, the story is not yet finished: \"When the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea.\" [Rev 20:7-8]\n\nThere is continuing discussion over the identity of [[Gog and Magog]]. In the context of the passage, they seem to equate to something like \"east and west\". There is a passage in Ezekiel, however, where God says to the prophet, \"Set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him.\" [Ezek 38:2] Gog, in this instance, is the name of a person of the land of Magog, who is ruler (\"prince\") over the regions of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. Ezekiel says of him: \"You will ascend, coming like a storm, covering the land like a cloud, you and all your troops and many peoples with you...\" [Ezek 38:2]\n\nDespite this huge show of force, the battle will be short-lived, for Ezekiel, Daniel, and Revelation all say that this last desperate attempt to destroy the people and the city of God will end in disaster: \"I will bring him to judgment with pestilence and bloodshed. I will rain down on him and on his troops, and on the many peoples who are with him: flooding rain, great hailstones, fire and brimstone.\" [Ezek 38:22] Revelation concurs: \"Fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.\" [Rev 20:9] It may be that the images of fire raining down are an ancient vision of modern weapons, others would say a supernatural intervention by God, yet others that they refer to events in history, and some would say they are symbolic of larger ideas and should not be interpreted literally.\n\n===The Last Judgment===\n{{Main|Last Judgment}}\nFollowing the defeat of Gog, the last judgment begins: \"The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\" [Rev 20:10] Satan will join the Antichrist and the [[False Prophet]], who were condemned to the lake of fire at the beginning of the Millennium.\n\nFollowing Satan's consignment to the lake of fire, his followers come up for judgment. This is the \"second resurrection\", and all those who were not a part of the first resurrection at the coming of Christ now rise up for judgment:\n\n{{Quote|I saw a great white throne and him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. And Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire. [Rev 20:11,13-15]}}\n\nJohn had earlier written, \"Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power.\" [Rev 20:6] Those who are included in the Resurrection and the Rapture are excluded from the final judgment, and are not subject to the [[second death]]. Due to the description of the seat upon which the Lord sits, this final judgment is often referred to as the [[Great White Throne Judgment]].\n\n==New Heaven and New Earth==\n[[File:Apocalypse 38.

Once again, we see the imagery of the marriage: \"I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.\" [Rev 21:2] In the New Jerusalem, God \"will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God..\" [Rev 21:3] As a result, there is \"no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple\". Nor is there a need for the sun to give its light, \"for the glory of God illuminated it, and the Lamb is its light\". [Rev 21:22-23] The city will also be a place of great peace and joy, for \"God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying; and there will be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.\" [Rev 21:4]\n\n====Description====\nThe city itself has a large wall with twelve gates in it which are never shut, and which have the names of the [[twelve tribes of Israel]] written on them. Each of the gates is made of a single pearl, and there is an angel standing in each one. The wall also has twelve foundations which are adorned with precious stones, and upon the foundations are written the names of the twelve apostles. The gates and foundations are often interpreted{{Who|date=June 2011}} as symbolizing the people of God before and after Christ.\n\nThe city and its streets are pure gold, but not like the gold we know, for this gold is described as being like clear glass. The city is square in shape, and is twelve thousand [[furlong]]s long and wide (fifteen hundred miles). If these are comparable to earthly measurements, the city will cover an area about half the size of the contiguous United States. The height is the same as the length and breadth, and although this has led most people to conclude that it is shaped like a cube, it could also be a [[pyramid]].\n\n===The Tree of Life===\n[[File:Apocalypse 43. The tree of life. Revelation cap 22 v 2. Mortier's Bible. Phillip Medhurst Collection.jpg|thumb|''The tree of life''{{bibleref2c|Rev|22:2|NRSV}}, a print from the Phillip Medhurst Collection of Bible illustrations in the possession of Revd. Philip De Vere at St. George's Court, [[Kidderminster]], England.]]\n{{Main|Tree of life (biblical)}}\nThe city has a river which proceeds \"out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.\" [Rev 22:1] Next to the river is the tree of life, which bears twelve fruits and yields its fruit every month. The last time we saw the tree of life was in the Garden of Eden. [Gen 2:9] God drove Adam and Eve out from the garden, guarding it with cherubim and a flaming sword, because it gave eternal life to those who ate of it. [Gen 3:22] In the New Jerusalem, the tree of life reappears, and everyone in the city has access to it. Genesis says that the earth was cursed because of Adam's sin, [Gen 3:17] but the author of John writes that in the New Jerusalem, \"there will be no more curse.\" [Rev 22:3]\n\nThe ''[[Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]]'' (Baker, 1984) says:\n{{quote|The rich symbolism reaches beyond our finest imaginings, not only to the beatific vision but to a renewed, joyous, industrious, orderly, holy, loving, eternal, and abundant existence. Perhaps the most moving element in the description is what is missing: there is no temple in the New Jerusalem, 'because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.' Vastly outstripping the expectations of Judaism, this stated omission signals the ultimate reconciliation.}}\n\n==Major theological positions==\nThere are diverse opinions concerning the thousand years of peace (Millennium) described in Revelation and the events associated with it. Some interpret a literal, future, thousand-year time period in which Christ will rule over the Earth, a time which will be characterized by peace and harmony. Others understand a literal age of peace, but think the \"thousand years\" is a figure of speech. Still others see the Millennium as symbolic of a spiritual ideal, with no corresponding earthly condition. All of these positions fall into the category of millennialism, a broad term which includes any and all ideas relating to the millennium of Biblical prophecy. The most commonly held viewpoints are usually categorized as follows:\n\n===Premillennialism===\n{{Main|Premillennialism}}\nStandard premillennialism posits that Christ's second coming will inaugurate a literal thousand-year earthly kingdom. Christ's return will coincide with a time of great tribulation. At this time, there will be a resurrection of the people of God who have died, and a rapture of the people of God who are still living, and they will meet Christ at his coming. A thousand years of peace will follow, during which Christ will reign and Satan will be imprisoned in the Abyss. Those who hold to this view usually fall into one of the following three categories:\n\n====Pretribulation Rapture====\n{{Main|Pretribulationism}}\nPretribulationists believe that the second coming will be in two stages separated by a seven-year period of tribulation. At the beginning of the tribulation, true Christians will rise to meet the Lord in the air (the Rapture). Then follows a seven-year period of suffering in which the Antichrist will conquer the world and persecute those who refuse to worship him. At the end of this period, Christ returns to defeat the Antichrist and establish the age of peace. This position is supported by a scripture which says, \"God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.\" [1 Thess 5:9]\n\n====Midtribulation Rapture====\n{{Main|Midtribulationism}}\nMidtribulationists believe that the Rapture will take place at the halfway point of the seven-year tribulation, i.e. after 3\u00bd years. It coincides with the \"abomination of desolation\"\u2014a desecration of the temple where the Antichrist puts an end to the Jewish sacrifices, sets up his own image in the temple, and demands that he be worshiped as God. This event begins the second, most intense part of the tribulation.\n\nSome interpreters find support for the \"midtrib\" position by comparing a passage in Paul's epistles with the book of Revelation. Paul says, \"We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed\" (1 Cor 15:51-52). Revelation divides the great tribulation into three sets of increasingly catastrophic judgments: the Seven Seals, the Seven Trumpets, and the Seven Bowls, in that order. If the \"last trumpet\" of Paul is equated with the last trumpet of Revelation, the Rapture would be in the middle of the Tribulation. (Not all interpreters agree with this literal interpretation of the chronology of Revelation, however.)\n\n====Posttribulation Rapture====\n{{Main|Post-Tribulation Rapture}}\nPosttribulationists hold that Christ will not return until the end of the tribulation. Christians, rather than being raptured at the beginning of the tribulation, or halfway through, will live through it and suffer for their faith during the ascendancy of the Antichrist. Proponents of this position believe that the presence of believers during the tribulation is necessary for a final evangelistic effort during a time when external conditions will combine with the Gospel message to bring great numbers of converts into the Church in time for the beginning of the Millennium.\n\n===Postmillennialism===\n{{Main|Postmillennialism}}\nPostmillennialism does not believe in a premillennial appearance of Christ. The postmillennial position is that the millennium began at the inauguration of Christ's kingdom reign when he ascended to his heavenly throne and happens, not as a result of the coming of Christ, but as the global population converts to Christianity as a result of evangelization. The age of peace is still a progressing work of divine grace, but without the visible presence of Christ to take the place of an Earthly ruler. Christ will appear at the end of the millennium to lead his people into the heavenly city, the New Jerusalem.\n\n===Amillennialism===\n{{Main|Amillennialism}}\nAmillennialism does not believe in a literal Millennium. The \"thousand years\" is an expression, a way of referring to the entire period from the first coming of Christ, two thousand years ago, until the future second coming. Many amillennialists believe that during this time period, the church will continue to evangelize and grow as well as suffer declination in periods until Christ's coming. The Second Coming will be a natural culmination of the process of world evangelization, rather than a revolutionary event that brings sudden and dramatic change.\n\n==Preterism v. Historicism==\nExpositors of the traditional Protestant interpretation of Revelation known as [[Historicism (Christian eschatology)|Historicism]] have often maintained that Revelation was written in AD 96 and not [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|AD 70]]. [[Edward Bishop Elliott]], in the ''[[Horae Apocalypticae]]'' (1862), argues that John wrote the book in exile on [[Patmos]] \"at the close of the reign of Domitian; that is near the end of the year 95 or beginning of 96\". He notes that\nDomitian was assassinated in September 96.<ref name = \"ElliottV1\" />{{rp|47}} Elliot begins his lengthy review of historical evidence by quoting [[Irenaeus]], a disciple of [[Polycarp]]. Polycarp was a disciple of the Apostle John. Irenaeus mentions that the Apocalypse was seen \"no very long time ago [but] almost in our own age, toward the end of the reign of Domitian\".<ref name = \"ElliottV1\" />{{rp|32}}\n\nOther historicists have seen no significance in the date that Revelation was written, and have even held to an early date<ref>{{cite book | last =Thomas | first =John | authorlink =John Thomas (Christadelphian) | title = [[Eureka: An Exposition of the Apocalypse|Eureka: An Exposition of the Apocalypse (In Three Volumes)]] | year =1861 | pages = | url =}}</ref> while Kenneth L. Gentry, Jr., makes an exegetical and historical argument for the pre-AD 70 composition of Revelation.<ref>Gentry, Jr., Th.D., K. L. (1989). Before Jerusalem Fell. Retrieved from http://www.entrewave.com/freebooks/docs/a_pdfs/kgbj.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516224723/http://www.entrewave.com/freebooks/docs/a_pdfs/kgbj.pdf |date=2013-05-16 }}</ref>\n\n== Historicism v. Futurism==\nThe division between these interpretations can be somewhat blurred. \nMost futurists are expecting a [[Rapture]] of the Church, an [[Antichrist]], a [[Great Tribulation]] and a [[Second coming]] of Christ in the near future. But they also accept certain past events, such as the rebirth of the State of [[Israel]] and the reunification of [[Jerusalem]] as prerequisites to them, in a manner which the earlier historicists have done with other dates. Futurists, who do not normally use the [[day-year principle]], interpret the [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks]] in Daniel 9:24 as years, just as historicists do. \nMost historicists have chosen time lines, from beginning to end, entirely in the past.<ref>e.g. 312 AD to 1572, 538 AD to 1798, and 606 AD to 1870. See [[day-year principle]]</ref>  But some, such as [[Adam Clarke]] have time lines which also commenced with specific past  events, but require a future fulfillment. In his commentary on Daniel 8:14 published in 1831, he stated that the 2,300-year period should be calculated from 334 BC, the year [[Alexander the Great]] began his conquest of the Persian Empire.<ref name=\"sacred-texts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/cmt/clarke/dan.htm|title=Commentary on the Bible by Adam Clarke: Daniel: Daniel index|website=www.sacred-texts.com}}</ref> His calculation resulted in the year 1966. He seems to have overlooked the fact that there is no \"year zero\" between BC and AD dates. For example, the year following 1 BC is 1 AD. Thus his calculations should have required an additional year, ending in 1967. He was  not anticipating a literal regathering of the Jewish people prior to the [[Second coming]] of Christ. But the date is of special significance to futurists since it is the year of Jerusalem's capture by Israeli forces during the [[Six-Day War]].\nHis commentary on Daniel 7:25 contains a 1260-year period  commencing in 755 AD and ending in 2015.<ref name=\"sacred-texts\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[1 Maccabees]]\n* [[Abomination (Bible)]]\n* [[Apocalypticism]]\n* [[Bible prophecy]]\n* [[Christian views on Hades]]\n* [[Consistent eschatology]]\n* [[Daniel Chapter 11]]\n* [[Daniel's Vision of Chapter 8]]\n* [[Day-year principle]]\n* [[End times]]\n* [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]\n* [[Inaugurated eschatology]]\n* [[Progressive dispensationalism]]\n* [[Realized eschatology]]\n* [[Christian eschatological views]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Christian theology}}\n{{Theology}}\n{{Global catastrophic risks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Christian Eschatology}}\n[[Category:Christian eschatology| ]]", "sha1": "s5c96yoc1ymu74kbbjwi7g0up2vom6l"}}, {"title": "Chicago White Sox", "ns": "0", "id": "5945", "revision": {"id": "866247524", "parentid": "864565953", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T05:44:04Z", "contributor": {"username": "DrewieStewie", "id": "21178723"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|White Sox}}\n{{use American English|date=May 2015}}\n{{use mdy dates|date=May 2015}}\n<!--Please use American English and the corresponding \"month day, year\" format for text and citation template dates and accessdates Refer to \"Talk:White Sox#Style of English and date formats\" for further details -->\n{{Infobox MLB\n| name = Chicago White Sox\n| established = 1888\n| logo = Chicago White Sox.svg\n| uniformlogo = Chicago White Sox Insignia.svg\n| current league = American League\n| y1 = 1901\n| division = [[American League Central|Central Division]]\n| y2 = 1994\n| past division = [[American League West|West Division]]\n| y5 = 1969\n| y6 = 1993\n| Uniform = ALC-Uniform-CWS.png\n| retirednumbers = {{hlist| [[Nellie Fox|2]] | [[Harold Baines|3]] | [[Luke Appling|4]] | [[Minnie Mi\u00f1oso|9]] | [[Luis Aparicio|11]] | [[Paul Konerko|14]] | [[Ted Lyons|16]] | [[Billy Pierce|19]] | [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|35]] | [[Mark Buehrle|56]] | [[Carlton Fisk|72]] | [[Jackie Robinson|42]]}}\n| colors = Black, silver, white{{efn|The team's official colors are black and silver, according to the team's mascot (Southpaw)'s official website.<ref name=\"AboutSouthpaw\">{{cite web|title=About Southpaw|url=https://www.mlb.com/whitesox/fans/southpaw/about-southpaw|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=WhiteSox.com|accessdate=August 21, 2018}}</ref>}}<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 Chicago White Sox Style Guide|url=https://clubmarks.mlbstyleguide.com/sitelet/2018/chicago-white-sox|publisher=Major League Baseball Properties|date=January 25, 2018|accessdate=July 25, 2018|subscription=yes}}</ref>\n{{color box|#000000}} {{color box|#C4CED3}} {{color box|#FFFFFF}}\n| y3 = 1904\n| nicknames = The Sox, the Chi Sox, the South Siders, the Pale Hose\n| pastnames =\n* Chicago White Stockings ({{baseball year|1900}}\u2013{{baseball year|1903}})\n* Saint Paul Saints ({{baseball year|1894}}\u2013{{baseball year|1899}})\n* Sioux City Cornhuskers ({{baseball year|1888}}\u2013{{baseball year|1893}})\n| ballpark = [[Guaranteed Rate Field]]\n| y4 = 1991\n| pastparks =\n** a.k.a.

The White Sox are owned by [[Jerry Reinsdorf]], and play their home games at [[Guaranteed Rate Field]], located on the city's [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]].

The club was originally called the Chicago White Stockings, but this was soon shortened to Chicago White Sox. The team originally played home games at [[South Side Park]] before moving to [[Comiskey Park]] in {{baseball year|1910}}, where they played until Guaranteed Rate Field (originally known as Comiskey Park and then known as [[U.S. Cellular]] Field) opened in 1991.\n\nThe White Sox won the [[1906 World Series]] with a defense-oriented team dubbed \"the Hitless Wonders\", and the [[1917 World Series]] led by [[Eddie Cicotte]], [[Eddie Collins]], and [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]].

Thompson]] and state legislature resulted in approval (by one vote) of public funding for a new stadium.  Designed primarily as a baseball stadium (as opposed to a \"multipurpose\" stadium) New Comiskey Park (redubbed U.S. Cellular Field in 2003 and [[Guaranteed Rate Field]] in 2016) was built in a 1960s style similar to [[Dodger Stadium]] and [[Kauffman Stadium]]. It opened in {{baseball year|1991}} to positive reviews; many praised its wide open concourses, excellent sight lines, and natural grass (unlike other stadiums of the era such as [[Rogers Centre]] in Toronto). The park's inaugural season drew 2,934,154 fans&nbsp;\u2014 at the time, an all-time attendance record for any Chicago baseball team.\n\n[[File:Uscellular.jpg|thumb|250px|View from the upper deck of U.S. Cellular Field in 2006]]\n\nIn recent years, money accrued from the sale of naming rights to [[U.S. Cellular]] has been allocated for renovations to make the park more aesthetically appealing and fan friendly. Notable renovations of early phases included: re-orientation of the bullpens parallel to the field of play (thus decreasing slightly the formerly symmetrical dimensions of the outfield); filling seats in up to and shortening the outfield wall; ballooning foul-line seat sections out toward the field of play; creating a new multi-tiered [[batter's eye]], allowing fans to see out through one-way screens from the center-field vantage point, and complete with concession stand and bar-style seating on its 'fan deck'; renovating all concourse areas with brick, historic murals, and new concession stand ornaments to establish a more friendly feel. The stadium's steel and concrete was repainted dark gray and black. The scoreboard Jumbotron was also replaced with a new [[Mitsubishi]] Diamondvision [[High-definition television|HDTV]] giant screen.\n\nMore recently, the top quarter of the upper deck was removed in {{baseball year|2004}} and a black wrought metal roof was placed over it, covering all but the first eight rows of seats. This decreased [[seating capacity]] from 47,098 to 40,615. 2005 also saw the introduction of the Scout Seats, redesignating (and re-upholstering) 200 lower deck seats behind home plate as an exclusive area, with seat-side waitstaff and a complete restaurant located underneath the concourse. The most significant structural addition besides the new roof was {{baseball year|2005}}'s FUNdamentals Deck, a multi-tiered structure on the left field concourse containing batting cages, a small [[Tee Ball]] field, speed pitch, and several other child-themed activities intended to entertain and educate young fans with the help of coaching staff from the Chicago Bulls/Sox Training Academy. This structure was used during the 2005 playoffs by [[ESPN]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] as a broadcasting platform.\n\nDesigned as a 7-phase plan, the renovations were completed before the {{baseball year|2007}} season with the 7th and final phase. The most visible renovation in this final phase was replacing the original blue seats with green seats. The upper deck already had new green seats, put in before the beginning of the 2006 season. Beginning with the {{baseball year|2007}} season a new luxury seating section was added in the former press box. This section has amenities similar to those of the Scout Seats section. After the 2007 season the ballpark continued renovation projects despite that the 7-phase plan was complete.\n\n===Previous ballparks===\n[[File:00118 n 9abwn9hwm1496.jpg|thumb|250px|Batting practice at Comiskey Park in 1986]]\nThe St. Paul Saints first played their games at [[Lexington Park]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Thornley|first=Stew|title=Twin Cities Ballparks|url=http://stewthornley.net/twincityballparks.html|website=stewthornley.net|year=2004|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref> When they moved to Chicago's [[Armour Square]] neighborhood, they began play at the [[South Side Park III|South Side Park]].

In 1960, the White Sox became the first team in the major sports to put players' last names on [[jersey (clothing)#In sports|jerseys]].\n\n[[File:Im cws logo 1912.png|frame|1912\u20131917, 1919\u20131929, 1931, and 1936\u20131938 Chicago White Sox logo]]\n\nIn 1912 the White Sox debuted a large \"S\" in a Roman-style [[font]], with a small \"O\" inside the top loop of the \"S\" and a small \"X\" inside the bottom loop. This is the logo associated with the 1917 World Series championship team and the 1919 Black Sox. With a couple of brief interruptions, the dark-blue logo with the large \"S\" lasted through 1938 (but continued in a modified block style into the 1940s). Through the 1940s, the White Sox team colors were primarily navy blue trimmed with red.\n\nThe White Sox logo in the 1950s and 1960s (actually beginning in the 1949 season) was the word \"SOX\" in an Old English font, diagonally arranged, with the \"S\" larger than the other two letters. From 1949 through 1963, the primary color was black (trimmed with red after 1951). The Old English \"SOX\" in black lettering is the logo associated with the Go-Go Sox era.\n\nIn 1964, the primary color went back to navy blue, and the road uniforms changed from gray to pale blue. In 1971, the team's primary color changed from royal blue to red, with the color of their [[pin stripes|pinstripes]] and [[baseball cap|caps]] changing to red. The 1971\u20131975 uniform included red [[baseball uniform#Stockings and pants|socks]].\n\n[[File:White Sox old logo.png|frame|Chicago White Sox logo (1976\u20131990)]]\n\nIn 1976 the team's uniforms changed again. The team's primary color changed back from red to navy. The team based their uniforms on a style worn in the early days of the franchise, with white jerseys worn at home, blue on the [[road (sports)|road]]. The team brought back white socks for the last time in team history. The socks featured a different stripe pattern every year. The team also had the option to wear blue or white pants with either jersey. Additionally the teams \"SOX\" logo was changed to a modern-looking \"SOX\" in a bold font, with 'CHICAGO' written across the jersey. Finally, the team's logo featured a [[silhouette]] of a batter over the words \"SOX\".\n\nThe new uniforms also featured [[collar (clothing)|collars]] and were designed to be worn untucked&nbsp;\u2014 both unprecedented. Yet by far the most unusual wrinkle was the option to wear shorts, which the White Sox did for the first game of a [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] against the [[Kansas City Royals]] in 1976. The [[Hollywood Stars]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]] had previously tried the same concept, it was also poorly received. Apart from aesthetic issues, as a practical matter shorts are not conducive to sliding, due to the likelihood of significant abrasions.\n\nUpon taking over the team in 1980 new owners [[Eddie Einhorn]] and [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] announced a contest where fans were invited to create new uniforms for the White Sox. The winning entry was submitted by a fan where the word \"SOX\" was written across the front of the jersey, in the same font as a cap, inside of a large blue stripe trimmed with red. The red and blue stripes were also on the sleeves, and the road jerseys were gray to the home whites.  In those jerseys the White Sox won 99 games and the AL West championship in 1983, the best record in the majors.\n\n[[File:White Sox Alt Logo.svg|thumb|150px|Alternate logo, on road uniforms (1991\u20132010)]]\n\nAfter five years those uniforms were retired and replaced with a more basic uniform which had \"White Sox\" written across the front in script, with \"Chicago\" on the front of the road jersey. The cap logo was also changed to a cursive \"C\", although the batter logo was retained for several years.\n\nFor a mid-season 1990 game at Comiskey Park the White Sox appeared once in a uniform based on that of the 1917 White Sox.\n\nThe White Sox then switched their regular uniform style once more.  In September, for the final series at Old Comiskey Park, the old English \"SOX\" logo (a slightly simplified version of the 1949\u201363 logo) was restored, and the new uniform also had the black pinstripes restored. The team's primary color changed back to black, this time with silver trim. The team also introduced a new sock logo\u2014a white silhouette of a sock centered inside a white outline of a baseball diamond\u2014which appeared as a sleeve patch on the away and alternate uniforms until 2011 when the patch was switched with the primary logo on the away uniform. With minor modifications (i.e., occasionally wearing vests, black game jerseys) the White Sox have used this style ever since.\n\nDuring the 2012 and 2013 seasons, the White Sox wore their throwback uniforms at home every Sunday, starting with the 1972 red-pinstriped throwback jerseys worn during the 2012 season, followed by the 1981\u201386 uniforms the next season. In the 2014 season, the \"Winning Ugly\" throwbacks were promoted to full-time alternate status, and is now worn at home on Sundays. In one game during the 2014 season, the White Sox paired their throwbacks with a cap featuring the batter logo instead of the wordmark \"SOX\"; this is currently their batting practice cap prior to games in the throwback uniforms.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Nicknames===\nThe White Sox were originally known as the White Stockings, a reference to the original name of the [[Chicago Cubs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Chicago Cubs Team History & Encyclopedia|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=December 28, 2014}}</ref> To fit the name in headlines, local newspapers such as the [[Chicago Tribune]] abbreviated the name alternatively to Stox and Sox.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Engber|first=Daniel|title=X Marks The Baseball team|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2005/10/x_marks_the_baseball_team.html|date=October 25, 2015|magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|department=Explainer|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> Charles Comiskey would officially adopt the White Sox nickname in the club's first years, making them the first team to officially use the \"Sox\" name.

The nature of the rivalry is unique; with the exception of the [[1906 World Series]], in which the White Sox upset the favored Cubs, the teams never met in an official game until {{baseball year|1997}}, when interleague play was introduced. In the intervening time, the two teams sometimes met for exhibition games. The White Sox currently lead the regular season series 48\u201339, winning the last 4 seasons in a row. The BP Crosstown Cup was introduced in 2010 and the White Sox won the first three seasons (2010-2012) until the Cubs first won the Cup in 2013 by sweeping the season series.  The White Sox won the Cup the next season and retained the Cup the following two years (series was a tie - Cup remains with defending team in the event of a tie).  The Cubs took back the Cup in 2017.  There have been two series sweeps since interleague play began both by the Cubs: 1998 and 2013.\n\nAn example of this volatile rivalry is the game played between the White Sox and the [[Chicago Cubs]] at U.S. Cellular Field on May 20, {{baseball year|2006}}. White Sox catcher [[A. J. Pierzynski]] was running home on a sacrifice fly by center fielder [[Brian Anderson (outfielder)|Brian Anderson]] and smashed into Cubs catcher [[Michael Barrett (baseball)|Michael Barrett]], who was blocking home plate. Pierzynski lost his helmet in the collision, and slapped the plate as he rose. Barrett stopped him and, after exchanging a few words, punched Pierzynski in the face, causing a melee to ensue. Brian Anderson and Cubs first baseman [[John Mabry]] got involved in a separate confrontation, although it was later determined that Mabry was attempting to be a peacemaker. After 10 minutes of conferring following the fight, the umpires ejected Pierzynski, Barrett, Anderson, and Mabry. As Pierzynski entered his dugout, he pumped his arms, causing the soldout crowd at U.S. Cellular Field to erupt in cheers. When play resumed, White Sox second baseman [[Tadahito Iguchi]] blasted a grand slam to put the White Sox up 5\u20130 on their way to a 7\u20130 win over their crosstown rivals. While there are other major league cities and metropolitan areas in which two teams co-exist, all of the others feature at least one team which began playing there in {{baseball year|1961}} or later, whereas the White Sox and Cubs have been competing for their city's fans since 1901.\n\n====Divisional====\n{{main article|Major League Baseball rivalries#Chicago White Sox vs. Detroit Tigers}}\n\nThe White Sox enjoy healthy divisional rivalries. The [[Detroit Tigers]] are one of Chicago's primary rivals, and the cities of Chicago and Detroit share rivalries in other sports as well, such as the [[Bulls\u2013Pistons rivalry]], [[Blackhawks\u2013Red Wings rivalry]] and the [[Bears\u2013Lions rivalry]]. The rivalry has had its fair share of fights as well. The two teams are separated by a small under 5 hour drive, leading to fans of both teams showing up in large numbers at each others home stadiums. The teams have also got into a number of brawls, the most famous of which occurred in 2000 along with \"binocular-gate\" in 2014. In 2016, Al Avila, the GM of the Tigers let his own son, catcher Alex Avila, leave the Tigers to sign with the White Sox. \n\n{{main article|Major League Baseball rivalries#Chicago White Sox vs. Minnesota Twins}}\n\nThe [[Minnesota Twins]] are high-profile rivals as well, with fans of both teams showing up to Comiskey Park and Target Field in healthy numbers. The White Sox and Twins also played in a one-game playoff in [[2008 American League Central tie-breaker game|2008]], the White Sox would win the game 1\u20130 and the division. Between 2000 and 2010 the teams combined for 9 AL Central titles, and although the Twins won 6 times to the White Sox 3, the White Sox won the only world series of the two in this time (2005). Former all-star catcher A.J. Pierzynski played for both teams and left Minnesota in 2003 and join the Sox in 2005, he received boos on his first visit back to Minnesota. \n\n{{main article|Major League Baseball rivalries#Chicago White Sox vs. Cleveland Indians}}\n\nChicago has another rivalry with the [[Cleveland Indians]]. The rivalry first started upon the creation of the AL Central in 1994. On July 15, 1994 an umpire confiscated [[Albert Belle]]'s bat, presuming that it was corked. They put it in the umpire's room at Comiskey Park. However, Indians pitcher [[Jason Grimsley]] climbed through the ceiling from the visitor's clubhouse and stole the bat. The theft was discovered and Belle was suspended; Grimsley later owned up to the theft. Belle further inflamed matters by spurning the Indians and signing a large free agent contract with the White Sox in 1997. In 2005, during the White Sox world series chase, the Indians cut down the Sox lead in the division from 14 games to 3 heading into the final weekend of the season with the Sox at 96-63 and the Tribe at 93-66, the White Sox swept the Indians and knocked them both out of the division race and wild card hunt with mostly back up players.\n\n====Historical====\nA historical regional rival was the St. Louis Browns. Through the 1953 season, the two teams were located fairly close to each other (including the 1901 season when the Browns were the Milwaukee Brewers), and could have been seen as the American League equivalent of the [[Cardinals\u2013Cubs rivalry]], being that Chicago and St. Louis have for years been connected by the same highway ([[U.S. Route 66]] and now [[Interstate 55]]). The rivalry has been somewhat revived at times in the past, involving the Browns' current identity, the [[Baltimore Orioles]], most notably in 1983.\n\nThe current [[Milwaukee Brewers]] franchise were arguably the White Sox main and biggest rival, due to the proximity of the two cities (resulting in large numbers of White Sox fans who would regularly be in attendance at the Brewers former home [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]), and with the teams competing in the same American League division for the 1970 and 1971 seasons and then again from 1994 to 1997. The rivalry has since cooled off however, when the Brewers moved to the [[National League]] in 1998.\n\n==Broadcasting==\n{{See also|List of Chicago White Sox broadcasters}}\n\n===Radio===\n[[File:Bob Elson circa 1940s.JPG|thumb|150px|Elson in the 1940s.]]\nThe White Sox did not sell exclusive rights for radio broadcasts from radio's inception until 1944, instead having local stations share rights for games, and after [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] (720) was forced to abdicate their rights to the team in the 1943 after sixteen seasons due to children's programming commitments from their network, [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]].<ref name=\"cbmradio\">{{cite web|url=http://chicagobaseballmuseum.org/chicago-baseball-history-news/chicago-baseball-history-feature/wgn-radio-720-signal-best-possible-2018-home-white-sox/|title=WGN-Radio and 720 signal best possible 2018 home for White Sox|last=Castle|first=George|date=14 February 2018|publisher=Chicago Baseball Museum|accessdate=17 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=All-Time Broadcasters|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/history/broadcasters.jsp|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> The White Sox first granted exclusive rights in 1944, and would bounce between stations until 1952, when the White Sox started having all games broadcast on [[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] (1000).<ref>{{cite web|title=Right on Q: A brief history of the White Sox on the radio|url=http://www.southsidesox.com/2014/5/17/5725462/white-sox-radio-history|date=May 17, 2014|website=South Side Sox|publisher=SB Nation|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> Throughout this period of instability, one thing remained constant: the White Sox play-by-play announcer, [[Bob Elson]].

An [[NBC]] owned & operated station until 1988 when [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]] purchased it after NBC's withdrawal from radio, it was the home of the Sox until the 1996 season, outside of a team nadir in the early 70s where it was forced to [[brokered programming|broker time]] on suburban [[La Grange, Illinois|La Grange]]'s [[WRDZ (AM)|WTAQ]] (1300) and [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]]'s [[WOJO|WEAW-FM]] (105.1) to have their play-by-play air in some form (though WEAW transmitted from the [[875 North Michigan Avenue|John Hancock Center]], FM radio was not established as a band for sports play-by-play at the time)<ref name=\"cbmradio\"></ref>, and a one-season contract on [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] (780) in 1981. After Elson's retirement in 1970, [[Harry Caray]] began his tenure as the voice of the White Sox, on radio as well as on television. Although best remembered as a broadcaster for the rival Cubs, Caray was very popular with White Sox fans, pining for a \"cold one\" during broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web|title=1989 Ford Frick Award Winner Harry Caray|url=http://baseballhall.org/discover/awards/ford-c-frick/harry-caray|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> Caray would often broadcast from the stands, sitting at a table set up amidst the bleachers. It became a badge of honor among Sox fans to \"Buy Harry a beer...\" By game's end you'd see a large stack of empty beer cups beside his microphone. This only endeared him to fans that much more.

In 1992, he was paired with color announcer [[Ed Farmer]].

Starting in 1968, [[Jack Drees]] took play-by-play duties as the Sox were broadcast on [[WFLD]] (channel 32).<ref>{{cite web|title=All-Time Broadcasters- Television|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/history/broadcasters.jsp|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> After 1972, Harry Caray (joined by Jimmy Piersall in 1977) began double duty as a TV and Radio announcer for the Sox, as broadcasts were moved to channel 44, [[WSNS-TV]], from 1972 to 1980, followed by one year on WGN-TV.\n\n[[Don Drysdale]] became the play-by-play announcer in 1982, as the White Sox began splitting their broadcasts between WFLD and the new regional [[cable television]] network, [[FSN Chicago|Sportsvision]]. Ahead of its time, Sportsvision had a chance to gain huge profits for the Sox. However, few people would subscribe to the channel after being used to free-to-air broadcasts for many years, along with Sportsvision being stunted by the city of Chicago's wiring for [[cable television]] taking much longer than many markets because of it being an area where over-the-air subscription services were still more popular, resulting in the franchise losing around $300,000 a month.<ref>{{cite web|title=White Sox History: The story of SportsVision|url=http://www.southsidesox.com/2012/11/30/3707810/white-sox-history-the-story-of-sportsvision|date=November 30, 2012|website=South Side Sox|publisher=SB Nation|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> While this was going on, every Cubs game was on WGN, with Harry Caray becoming the national icon he never was with the White Sox. The relatively easy near-national access to Cubs games versus Sox games in this era, combined with the popularity of Caray and the Cubs being owned by the [[Tribune Company]], is said by some to be the main cause of the Cubs' advantage in popularity over the Sox.\n\n[[File:Hawk Harrelson 2007 CROP.jpg|thumb|235px|Harrelson in the broadcast booth in 2007]]\nThree major changes to White Sox broadcasting happened each year from 1989 to 1991: in 1989 with the city finally fully wired for cable service, Sportsvision was replaced by SportsChannel Chicago (itself eventually turning into [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]] Chicago), which varied over its early years as a premium sports service and basic cable channel. In 1990, over-the-air broadcasts shifted back to WGN. And in 1991, [[Ken Harrelson]] became the play by play announcer of the White Sox.<ref>{{cite web|last=Edelman|first=Alexander|title=Ken Harrelson|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/442dbc70|website=SABR.org|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> One of the most polarizing figures in baseball, \"Hawk\" has been both adored and scorned for his emotive announcing style.

WGN games are also occasionally picked up by local stations in Illinois, Iowa, and Indiana. In the past, WGN games were broadcast nationally on the [[WGN America]] superstation, but those broadcasts ended after the 2014 season as WGN America began its transition to a standard cable network.<ref>{{cite web|last=Feder|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Feder|title=WGN America comes home to Chicago|url=http://www.robertfeder.com/2014/12/15/wgn-america-comes-home-to-chicago/|date=December 15, 2014|website=Robert Feder|subscription=yes|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> WGN Sports-produced White Sox games not carried by WGN-TV were carried by [[WCIU-TV]] (channel 26) until the 2015 season, when they moved to [[MyNetworkTV]] station [[WPWR]] (channel 50).<ref name=trib-whitesoxwpwr>{{cite news|last=Sherman|first=Ed|title=White Sox add WPWR-Ch. 50 to station rotation|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/whitesox/chi-white-sox-channel-50-20150219-story.html|date=February 19, 2015|accessdate=May 25, 2015|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> That arrangement ended on September 1, 2016 when WGN became an independent station.\n\nPrior to 2016, the announcers were the same no matter where the games were broadcast: Harrelson provided play-by-play, and [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] provided color analysis since 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Ralph|title=Steve Stone|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/a906928e|website=SABR.org|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}</ref> Games that are broadcast on NBC Sports Chicago feature pregame and postgame shows, hosted by Chuck Garfein with analysis from [[Bill Melton]] and occasionally [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]].

extracting or extending theoretical rules from a particular case, and reapplying those rules to new instances. This method occurs in [[applied ethics]] and [[jurisprudence]] The term is also commonly used as a pejorative to criticize the use of clever but unsound reasoning, especially in relation to moral questions (as in [[sophistry]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-35 |title=Casuistry |website=Dictionary of the History of Ideas |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618095059/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-35 |archive-date=18 June 2006 |publisher=[[University of Virginia Library]]}}</ref>\n\nCasuistry describes either a form of reasoning that is presumed{{by whom|date=October 2018}} to be acceptable, or a form of reasoning that is inherently unsound and deceptive.<ref>{{cite web|last=Runes|first=Dagobert D.|title=Dictionary of Philosophy|url=http://www.ditext.com/runes/c.html|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Philosophy Pages|url=http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/c.htm#casu|work=Casuistry|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Philosophy-Dictionary.org|url=http://www.philosophy-dictionary.org/casuistry|work=casuistry|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref> The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' says that the word \"[o]ften (and perhaps originally) applied to a quibbling or evasive way of dealing with difficult cases of duty.\" Its textual references, except for certain technical usages, are consistently pejorative (e.g., \"Casuistry destroys by distinctions and exceptions, all morality, and effaces the essential difference between right and wrong\").<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/28642|article=Casuistry |accessdate=21 September 2017}}, quoting {{cite book |first=Viscount |last=Bolingbroke |title=Letters on the Spirit of Patriotism and on the Idea of a Patriot King |location=London |year=1749 |url=https://archive.org/stream/lettersonspirit01boligoog#page/n175/mode/2up |p=170}}</ref>\n\nThe word ''casuistry'' derives from the [[Latin]] noun ''casus'' (\"case\" or \"occurence\").\n\n==Examples==\nWhile a principle-based approach might claim that [[lie|lying]] is always morally wrong, the casuist would argue that, depending upon the details of the case, lying might or might not be illegal or unethical. The casuist might conclude that a person is wrong to lie in legal [[testimony]] under oath, but might argue that lying actually is the best moral choice if the lie saves a life. ([[Thomas Sanchez]] and others thus theorized a [[doctrine of mental reservation]], which developed into its own branch of casuistry.) For the casuist, the circumstances of a case are essential for evaluating the proper response.\n\nTypically, casuistic reasoning begins with a clear-cut [[paradigm]]atic case. In legal reasoning, for example, this might be a [[precedent]] case, such as premeditated murder. From it, the casuist would ask how closely the given case currently under consideration matches the paradigmatic case. Cases like the paradigmatic case ought to be treated likewise; cases unlike the paradigm ought to be treated differently. Thus, a man is properly charged with premeditated murder if the circumstances surrounding his case closely resemble the exemplary premeditated murder case. The less a given case is like the paradigm, the weaker the justification is for treating that case ''like'' the paradigmatic case.\n\n==Meanings==\nCasuistry is a ''method'' of case reasoning especially useful in treating cases that involve moral dilemmas. It is a branch of [[applied ethics]]. It is also criticized for the use of inconsistent\u2014or outright specious\u2014application of rule to instance. \n\n==Morality==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2011}}\n\nCasuistry takes a relentlessly practical approach to morality. Rather than using theories as starting points, casuistry begins with an examination of cases. By drawing parallels between [[paradigm]]s, or so-called \"pure cases\", and the case at hand, a casuist tries to determine a moral response appropriate to a particular case.\n\nCasuistry has been described as \"theory modest\" (Arras, see below). One of the strengths of casuistry is that it does not begin with, nor does it overemphasize, theoretical issues. It does not require practitioners to agree about ethical theories or evaluations before making policy. Instead, they can agree that certain [[paradigm]]s should be treated in certain ways, and then agree on the similarities, the so-called warrants between a paradigm and the case at hand.\n\nSince most people, and most cultures, substantially agree about most pure ethical situations, casuistry often creates ethical arguments that can persuade people of different ethnic, religious and philosophical beliefs to treat particular cases in the same ways. For this reason, casuistry is widely considered to be the basis for the [[English law|English]] [[common law]] and its derivatives.\n\nCasuistry is prone to abuses wherever the analogies between cases [[False analogy|are false]].\n\n==History==\nCasuistry dates from [[Aristotle]] (384\u2013322 BC), yet the zenith of casuistry was from 1550 to 1650, when the [[Society of Jesus]] used case-based reasoning, particularly in administering the [[Sacrament of Penance]] (or \"confession\").<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Franklin |title=The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2001 |pages=83\u201388}}</ref> The term ''casuistry'' quickly became pejorative with [[Blaise Pascal]]'s attack on the misuse of casuistry. In ''[[Provincial Letters]]'' (1656\u20137)<ref>{{cite book |first=Blaise |last=Pascal |title=The Provincial Letters of Blaise Pascal |others=M'Crie, Thomas (trans.) |publisher=Chatto & Windus |location=London |year=1898 |origyear=1657 |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/pascal/blaise/ |series=eBooks@Adelaide}}</ref> he scolded the Jesuits for using casuistic reasoning in confession to placate wealthy Church donors, while punishing poor penitents. Pascal charged that aristocratic penitents could confess their sins one day, re-commit the sin the next day, generously donate the following day, then return to re-confess their sins and only receive the lightest punishment; Pascal's criticisms darkened casuistry's reputation.\n\nIt was not until publication of ''The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning'' (1988), by Albert Jonsen and [[Stephen Toulmin]],<ref>Albert Jonsen and [[Stephen Toulmin]], ''The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning'', Berkeley, U. California Press (1990, {{ISBN|0-520-06960-9}}).</ref> that a revival of casuistry occurred. They argue that the abuse of casuistry is the problem, not casuistry ''per se'' (itself an example of casuistic reasoning). Properly used, casuistry is powerful reasoning. Jonsen and Toulmin offer casuistry in dissolving the contradictory tenets of [[moral absolutism]] and the common secular [[moral relativism]]: \"the form of reasoning constitutive of classical casuistry is [[rhetorical reason]]ing\".<ref>Jonsen, 1991, p. 297.</ref> Moreover, the ethical philosophies of [[Utilitarianism]] (especially [[preference utilitarianism]]) and [[Pragmatism]] commonly are identified as greatly employing casuistic reasoning.\n\n==Early modern times==\nThe casuistic method was popular among [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] thinkers in the early modern period, and not only among the [[Jesuits]], as it is commonly thought. Famous casuistic authors include [[Antonio Escobar y Mendoza]], whose ''Summula casuum conscientiae'' (1627) enjoyed a great success, [[Thomas Sanchez]], [[Vincenzo Filliucci]] (Jesuit and [[Apostolic Penitentiary|penitentiary]] at [[St Peter]]'s), [[Antonino Diana]], [[Paul Laymann]] (''Theologia Moralis'', 1625), [[John Azor]] (''Institutiones Morales'', 1600), [[Etienne Bauny]], [[Louis Cellot]], [[Valerius Reginaldus]], [[Hermann Busembaum]] (d. 1668), etc. One of the main theses of casuists was the necessity to adapt the rigorous morals of the [[Church Fathers|Early Fathers]] of [[Christianity]] to modern morals, which led in some extreme cases to justify what [[Innocent XI]] later called \"laxist moral\" (i.e. justification of [[usury]], [[homicide]], [[regicide]], [[lie|lying]] through \"[[Doctrine of mental reservation|mental reservation]]\", [[Catholic teachings on sexual morality|adultery and loss of virginity before marriage]], etc.\u2014all due cases registered by [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] in the ''[[Provincial Letters]]'').\n\nThe progress of casuistry was interrupted toward the middle of the 17th century by the controversy which arose concerning the [[Catholic probabilism|doctrine of probabilism]], which stipulated that one could choose to follow a \"probable opinion\", that is, supported by a theologian or another, even if it contradicted a more probable opinion or a quotation from one of the [[Fathers of the Church]].<ref>Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', p. 74\u20136, 83.</ref> The controversy divided Catholic theologians into two camps, Rigorists and Laxists.\n\nCertain kinds of casuistry were criticized by early [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant theologians]], because it was used in order to justify many of the abuses that they sought to reform. It was famously attacked by the Catholic and [[Jansenist]] philosopher [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], during the [[formulary controversy]] against the Jesuits, in his [[Lettres provinciales|Provincial Letters]] as the use of [[rhetorics]] to justify moral laxity, which became identified by the public with [[Jesuitism]]; hence the everyday use of the term to mean complex and [[sophist]]ic reasoning to justify moral laxity.<ref>170 \"Casuistry..destroys, by distinctions and exceptions, all morality, and effaces the essential difference between right and wrong.\" Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke, ''Letters on the Spirit of Patriotism 1736'' (pub. 1749), quoted in Oxford English Dictionary, 1989 ed.</ref> By the mid-18th century, \"casuistry\" had become a synonym for specious moral reasoning.<ref>Jonsen, Albert R., The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning, University of California Press, 1988. {{ISBN|0-52-006063-6}} (p. 2).</ref> However, [[Puritan_casuistry|Puritans]] were well known for their own development of casuistry.\n\nIn 1679 [[Pope Innocent&nbsp;XI]] publicly condemned sixty-five of the more radical propositions (''stricti mentalis''), taken chiefly from the writings of Escobar, [[Francisco Suarez|Suarez]] and other casuists as ''propositiones laxorum moralistarum'' and forbade anyone to teach them under penalty of [[excommunication]].<ref>Kelly, J.N.D., The Oxford History of the Popes, Oxford University Press, 1986. {{ISBN|0-19-282085-0}} (p. 287).</ref> Despite this papal condemnation, both Catholicism and Protestantism permit the use of ambiguous and equivocal statements in specific circumstances.<ref>J.-P.

It has failed only because it is far too difficult a subject to be treated adequately in our present state of knowledge\". Furthermore, he asserted that \"casuistry is the goal of ethical investigation.

Most, if not all, Chinese [[input method]]s fall into one of two categories: phonetic readings or root shapes. Methods under the phonetic category usually are easier to learn but are less efficient, thus resulting in slower typing speeds because they typically require users to choose from a list of phonetically similar characters for input; whereas methods under the root shape category allow very precise and speedy input but have a difficult [[learning curve]] because they often require a thorough understanding of a character's strokes and composition.\n\nOther methods allow users to write characters directly onto [[touchscreen]]s, such as those found on mobile phones and tablet computers.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Large chinese keyboard.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An early experimental Chinese keyboard with many keys was developed by researchers of [[National Chiao Tung University]] in Taiwan, but it never became mainstream.]]\nChinese input methods predate the computer. One of the early attempts was an electro-mechanical [[Chinese typewriter]] Ming kwai ({{zh|c=\u660e\u5feb |p=m\u00edngku\u00e0i |w=ming-k'uai}}) which was invented by [[Lin Yutang]], a prominent Chinese writer, in the 1940s.  It assigned thirty base shapes or strokes to different keys and adopted a new way of categorizing Chinese characters. But the typewriter was not produced commercially and Lin soon found himself deeply in debt.<ref>[http://203.68.20.65/science/content/1972/00110035/0018.htm \u4e2d\u6587\u8207\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20030513120935/http://203.68.20.65/science/content/1972/00110035/0018.htm |date=2003-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nBefore the 1980s, Chinese publishers hired teams of workers and selected a few thousand type pieces from an enormous Chinese character set. Chinese government agencies entered characters using a long, complicated list of [[Chinese telegraph code]]s, which assigned different numbers to each character. During the early computer era, Chinese characters were categorized by their radicals or Pinyin romanization, but results were less than satisfactory.\n[[Image:Keyboard layout cangjie.png|thumb|200px|A typical [[keyboard layout]] for the Cangjie method, which is based on [[keyboard layout#United States|United States keyboard layout]]]]\n[[Chu Bong-Foo]] invented a common input method in 1976 with his [[Cangjie input method]], which assigns different \"roots\" to each key on a standard computer keyboard. With this method, for example, the character \u65e5 is assigned to the A key, and \u6708 is assigned to B. Typing them together will result in the character \u660e (\"bright\").\n\nDespite its steeper learning curve, this method remains popular in Chinese communities that use [[traditional Chinese character]]s, such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]]; the method allows very precise input, thus allowing users to type more efficiently and quickly, provided they are familiar with the fairly complicated rules of the method. It was the first method that allowed users to enter more than a hundred Chinese characters per minute.\n\nAll methods have their strengths and weaknesses. The [[pinyin method]] can be learned rapidly but its maximum input rate is limited. The ''[[Wubi method|Wubi]]'' takes longer to learn, but expert typists can enter text much more rapidly with it than with phonetic methods.\n\nDue to these complexities, there is no \"standard\" method.\n\nIn mainland China, the [[Wubi method|wubi]] (shape-based) and pinyin methods such as [[Sogou Pinyin]] and [[Google Pinyin]] are the most popular; in [[Taiwan]], [[Boshiamy method|Boshiamy]], [[Cangjie method|Cangjie]], and [[Bopomofo|zhuyin]] predominate; and in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], the [[Cangjie method|Cangjie]] is most often taught in schools.\n\nOther methods include [[handwriting recognition]], [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] and [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]]. The computer itself must first be \"trained\" before the first or second of these methods are used; that is, the new user enters the system in a special \"learning mode\" so that the system can learn to identify their handwriting or speech patterns. The latter two methods are used less frequently than keyboard-based input methods and suffer from relatively high error rates, especially when used without proper \"training\", though higher error rates are an acceptable trade-off to many users.\n\n== Categories ==\n\n===Phonetic-based===\n[[File:Interface of Weasel Input Method.png|thumb|Interface of a [[Pinyin]] input method, showing the need to choose an appropriate word out of a list of options. The word typed is \"Wikipedia\" in Mandarin Chinese, but the options shown include (from top to bottom) Wikipedia, [[Uncyclopedia]], Wiki, Crisis, and Rules Violation.]]\n{{See also|Pinyin input method}}\n{{See also|Bopomofo}}\n{{See also|Jyutping}}\nThe user enters pronunciations that are converted into relevant Chinese characters. The user must select the desired character from homophones, which are common in Chinese. Modern systems, such as [[Sogou Pinyin]] and [[Google Pinyin]], predict the desired characters based on context and user preferences. For example, if one enters the sounds ''jicheng'', the software will type \u7e7c\u627f (to inherit), but if ''jichengche'' is entered,  \u8a08\u7a0b\u8eca (taxi) will appear.\n\nVarious Chinese dialects complicate the system. Phonetic methods are mainly based on standard [[pinyin]], [[Zh\u00f9y\u012bn f\u00fah\u00e0o|Zhuyin]]/Bopomofo, and [[Jyutping]] in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, respectively. Input methods based on other [[varieties of Chinese]], like [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] or [[Southern Min|Minnan]], also exist.\n\nWhile the phonetic system is easy to learn, choosing appropriate Chinese characters slows typing speed. Most users report a typing speed of fifty characters per minute, though some reach over one hundred per minute.<ref>[http://bbs.sogou.com/284579/goYBXy1sJXqFBAAAA.html users' Report on Pinyin Method], Sougou BBS</ref> With some phonetic IMEs, in addition to predictive input based on previous conversions, it is possible for users to create custom dictionary entries for frequently used characters and phrases, potentially lowering the number of characters required to evoke it.\n\n==== Shuangpin ====\n[[File:Microsoft Double Pinyin Scheme.png|thumb|420px|The Microsoft pinyin 2003 shuangpin scheme.]]\nShuangpin (\u53cc\u62fc), literally dual spell, is a stenographical phonetic [[input method]] based on [[hanyu pinyin]] that reduces the number of keystrokes for one [[Chinese character]] to two by distributing every vowel and consonant composed of more than one letter to a specific key. In most Shuangpin layout schemes such as Xiaohe, Microsoft 2003 and Ziranma, the most frequently used vowels are placed on the middle layer, reducing the risk of [[Repetitive strain injury]].\n\nShuangpin is supported by a large number of pinyin input software including QQ, MIcrosoft Bing Pinyin, [[Sogou Pinyin]] and [[Google Pinyin]].\n\n=== Shape-based ===\n[[File:Typing chinese characters with Cangjie gedit383 Ubuntu1310 screencast.ogv|thumb|Typing [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] with [[Cangjie input method|Cangjie]]]]\n* [[Cangjie input method]] (\u5009\u9821; \u4ed3\u9889; Tsang-chieh)\n* [[Simplified Cangjie]] (\u7c21\u6613\u5009\u9821, known as \u901f\u6210 or 'Quick' on Windows systems and 'Sucheng' on Mac OS X systems)\n* [[CKC Chinese Input System]] (\u7e31\u6a6b\u8f38\u5165\u6cd5)\n* [[Boshiamy method]] (\u5638\u8766\u7c73)\n* [[Dayi method]] (\u5927\u6613)\n* [[Array Input Method|Array input method]] (\u884c\u5217)\n* [[Four-Corner Method]] (\u56db\u89d2\u78bc; \u56db\u89d2\u7801)\n* [[Oxis Chinese Character Finder]]\n* [[Q9 method]] (\u4e5d\u65b9)\n* [[Shouwei method]] (\u9996\u5c3e\u5b57\u578b)\n* [[Stroke count method]] (\u7b46\u756b; \u7b14\u753b)\n* [[Stroke method]] (\u7b46\u5283; \u7b14\u5212)\n* [[Wubi method]] (\u4e94\u7b46\u5b57\u578b; \u4e94\u7b14\u5b57\u578b)\n* [[Wubihua method]] (\u4e94\u7b46\u756b; \u4e94\u7b14\u753b)\n* [[Zheng code method]] (\u912d\u78bc; \u90d1\u7801)\n* [[Shou-wei Hao-ma method]] (\u9996\u5c3e\u865f\u78bc)\n* [[Knot DNA method]] (\u7b46\u7d50\u78bc)\n\n=== Hybrid ===\n* [[Tze-loi method]] (\u5b50\u4f86; \u5b50\u6765)\n* [[Renzhi code method]] (\u8a8d\u77e5\u78bc; \u8ba4\u77e5\u7801)\n* [[Cong Ming Da Zi]] (\u806a\u660e\u6253\u5b57, Released 2011)\n\n=== Others ===\n* [[Chinese telegraph code]] (\u4e2d\u6587\u96fb\u78bc)\n\n=== Examples of keyboard layouts ===\n<gallery>\nImage:Keyboard layout Zhuyin.svg|A typical [[keyboard layout]] for zhuyin on computers, which can be used as an input method\nImage:5strokes.jpg|The [[Wubi method|Wubi]] keyboard which is an input method\nImage:Keyboard layout cangjie.png|A typical [[keyboard layout]] for Cangjie method, which is based on [[keyboard layout#US|United States keyboard layout]].

Fighting for control of the territory in the [[French and Indian War]] (1754-1763) became part of the international [[Seven Years' War]] (1756-1763). During this period, the region routinely suffered turmoil, massacres, and battles. The 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] ceded the Ohio Country to the [[British Empire]].\n\n===Virginia Military District===\nAfter the [[American Revolution]], the Ohio Country became part of the [[Virginia Military District]], under the control of the United States. Colonists from the East Coast moved in, but rather than finding an empty [[frontier]], they encountered people of the [[Miami tribe|Miami]], [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]], [[Shawnee]], and [[Mingo]] nations, as well as European traders. The tribes resisted expansion by the fledgling United States, leading to years of bitter conflict. The decisive [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] resulted in the [[Treaty of Greenville]], which finally opened the way for new settlements. By 1797, a young [[surveying|surveyor]] from [[Virginia]] named [[Lucas Sullivant]] had founded a permanent settlement on the west bank of the forks of the Scioto River and Olentangy River. An admirer of [[Benjamin Franklin]], Sullivant chose to name his [[frontier]] village \"[[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]]\".<ref>Lentz, p. 33</ref> The location was desirable for its proximity to [[Navigability|navigable]] rivers\u2014but Sullivant was initially foiled when, in 1798, a large [[flood]] wiped out the new settlement.<ref>Moore, p. 101</ref> He persevered, and the village was rebuilt.\n\n===19th Century===\n[[File:Old Columbus City Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Old City Hall, completed in 1872 and burned in 1921]]\nAfter Ohio achieved statehood in 1803, political infighting among prominent Ohio leaders led to the state capital moving from [[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]] to [[Zanesville, Ohio|Zanesville]] and back again. Desiring to settle on a  location, the state legislature considered [[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]], [[Dublin, Ohio|Dublin]], [[Worthington, Ohio|Worthington]], and [[Delaware, Ohio|Delaware]] before compromising on a plan to build a new city in the state's center, near major transportation routes, primarily rivers. Named in honor of Christopher Columbus, the city was founded on February 14, 1812, on the \"High Banks opposite Franklinton at the Forks of the Scioto most known as Wolf's Ridge.\"<ref>Lentz, pp. 41\u201343</ref> At the time, this area was a dense forestland, used only as a hunting ground.<ref>Moore, p. 122</ref>\n\nThe \"[[Columbus City Council|Burough of Columbus]]\" {{sic}} was officially established on February 10, 1816.<ref>Moore, pp. 135\u2013136</ref> Nine people were elected to fill the various positions of Mayor, Treasurer, and several others. In 1816-1817, [[Jarvis W. Pike]] would serve as the 1st Mayor. Although the recent [[War of 1812]] had brought prosperity to the area, the subsequent recession and conflicting claims to the land threatened the new town's success. Early conditions were abysmal with frequent bouts of fevers and an outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1833.<ref>Moore, pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nThe [[National Road]] reached Columbus from [[Baltimore]] in 1831, which complemented the city's new link to the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]] and facilitated a population boom.<ref>Lentz, p. 58</ref> A wave of European [[immigrants]] led to the creation of two ethnic [[enclave]]s on the city's outskirts. A large [[Irish people|Irish]] population settled in the north along Naghten Street (presently Nationwide Boulevard), while the [[Germans]] took advantage of the cheap land to the south, creating a community that came to be known as the ''[[German Village|Das Alte S\u00fcdende]]'' (The Old South End). Columbus's German population constructed numerous breweries, [[Trinity Lutheran Seminary]], and [[Capital University]].<ref name = \"zuahxa\">Lentz, pp. 63\u201364</ref>\n[[File:CbusGrtSthrn.JPG|thumb|left|The Great Southern Hotel in downtown Columbus was completed in 1897]]\nWith a population of 3,500, Columbus was officially chartered as a city on March 3, 1834. On that day the legislature carried out a [[Private bill|special act]], which granted legislative authority to the [[city council]] and judicial authority to the mayor.

North-South streets run 12 degrees west of due North, parallel to High Street; the Avenues (vis. Fifth Avenue, Sixth Avenue, Seventh Avenue, and so on.) run east\u2013west.<ref>Moore, p. 127</ref> The address system begins its numbering at the intersection of Broad and High, with numbers increasing in magnitude with distance from Broad or High. Numbered Avenues begin with First Avenue, about {{convert|1+1/4|mi|abbr=on}} north of Broad Street, and increase in number as one progresses northward. Numbered Streets begin with Second Street, which is two blocks west of High Street, and Third Street, which is a block east of High Street, then progress eastward from there. Even-numbered addresses are on the north and east sides of streets, putting odd addresses on the south and west sides of streets. A difference of 700 house numbers means a distance of about {{convert|1|mi|abbr=on}} (along the same street).<ref name=\"fracomap\" /> For example, 351 W 5th Avenue is approximately {{convert|1/2|mi|m|abbr=on}} west of High Street on the south side of Fifth Avenue. Buildings along north\u2013south streets are numbered in a similar manner: the building number indicates the approximate distance from Broad Street, the prefixes 'N' and 'S' indicate whether that distance is to measured to the north or south of Broad Street and the street number itself indicates how far the street is from the center of the city at the intersection of Broad and High.\n\n[[File:Columbus Numbered Streets and Avenues.png|thumb|Locations of numbered streets and avenues]]\nThis street numbering system does not hold true over a large area. The area served by numbered Avenues runs from about Marble Cliff to South Linden to the Airport, and the area served by numbered Streets covers Downtown and nearby neighborhoods to the east and south, with only a few exceptions. There are quite few intersections between numbered Streets and Avenues. Furthermore, named Streets and Avenues can have any orientation. For example, while all of the numbered avenues run east\u2013west, perpendicular to High Street, many named, non-numbered avenues run north\u2013south, parallel to High. The same is true of many named streets: while the numbered streets in the city run north\u2013south, perpendicular to Broad Street, many named, non-numbered streets run east\u2013west, perpendicular to High Street.\n\nThe addressing system, however, covers nearly all of Franklin County, with only a few older suburbs retaining self-centered address systems. The address scale of 700 per mile results in addresses approaching, but not usually reaching, 10,000 at the county's borders.\n\nOther major, local roads in Columbus include Main Street, Morse Road, Dublin-Granville Road ([[Ohio State Route 161|SR-161]]), Cleveland Avenue/Westerville Road ([[Ohio State Highway 3|SR-3]]), Olentangy River Road, Riverside Drive, Sunbury Road, Fifth Avenue and Livingston Avenue.\n\n===Highways===\nColumbus is bisected by two major [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highways]], [[Interstate 70 (Ohio)|Interstate 70]] running east\u2013west, and [[Interstate 71 (Ohio)|Interstate 71]] running north to roughly southwest. The two Interstates combine downtown for about {{convert|1.5|mi|abbr=on}} in an area locally known as \"The Split\", which is a major [[traffic congestion]] point within Columbus, especially during [[rush hour]]. [[U.S. Route 40 in Ohio|U.S. Route 40]], originally known as the [[National Road]], runs east\u2013west through Columbus, comprising Main Street to the east of downtown and Broad Street to the west. [[U.S. Route 23 (Ohio)|U.S. Route 23]] runs roughly north\u2013south, while [[U.S. Route 33 (Ohio)|U.S. Route 33]] runs northwest-to-southeast. The [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|Interstate 270]] [[Beltway|Outerbelt]] encircles the vast majority of the city, while the newly redesigned Innerbelt consists of the [[Interstate 670 (Ohio)|Interstate 670]] spur on the north side (which continues to the east past the Airport and to the west where it merges with I-70), [[Ohio State Highway 315|State Route 315]] on the west side, the I-70/71 split on the south side, and I-71 on the east. Due to its central location within Ohio and abundance of outbound roadways, nearly all of the state's destinations are within a 2 or 3 hour drive of Columbus.\n[[File:Columbus-olentangy-river-bridge-night.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lane Avenue Bridge]], University District]]\n\n===Bridges===\nThe Columbus riverfront hosts a few notable bridges which have been built since 2000.

Until the founding of Amtrak in 1971 the [[Penn Central]] ran the ''[[Cincinnati Limited]]'' to Cincinnati to the southwest (in prior years the train continued to New York City to the east); and the Penn Central ran the ''[[Ohio State Limited]]'' between Cincinnati and Cleveland, with Union Station serving as a major intermediate stop (the train going unnamed between 1967 and 1971). The station was also a stop along the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], the [[New York Central Railroad]], the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad]], the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], the [[Norfolk and Western Railroad]], the [[Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad]] and the [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]].

In 1930, the airport was the site of the first airfield lighting system and the first air traffic [[control tower]]. Originally known as Cleveland Municipal Airport, it was the first municipally owned airport in the country. Cleveland Hopkins is a significant regional air freight hub hosting [[FedEx Express]], [[UPS Airlines]], [[United States Postal Service]], and major commercial freight carriers.\nIn addition to Hopkins, Cleveland is served by [[Burke Lakefront Airport]], on the north shore of downtown between Lake Erie and the [[Cleveland Memorial Shoreway|Shoreway]].

The rail portion is officially called the [[RTA Rapid Transit]], but local residents refer to it as ''The Rapid''. It consists of four [[rapid transit|light rail]] lines, known as the [[Blue, Green, and Waterfront Lines (Cleveland)|Blue, Green, and Waterfront lines]], and a [[heavy rail]] line, the [[Red Line (Cleveland)|Red Line]]. In 2008, RTA completed the [[HealthLine]], a [[bus rapid transit]] line, for which naming rights were purchased by the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals. It runs along [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland, Ohio)|Euclid Avenue]] from downtown through University Circle, ending at the [[Louis Stokes Station at Windermere]] in [[East Cleveland, Ohio|East Cleveland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rtahealthline.com/healthline-where-goes.asp |title=RTA HealthLine: Where It Goes |publisher=[[Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority]] | accessdate=November 19, 2010}}</ref> In 2007, the [[American Public Transportation Association]] named Cleveland's mass transit system the best in North America.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.riderta.com/nu_newsroom_releases.asp?listingid=1096 | title=Greater Cleveland: Best Location for Public Transportation in the Nation |publisher=Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority |date=October 1, 2007 |accessdate=June 30, 2008}}</ref>\nCleveland is the only metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere with its rail rapid transit system having only one center-city area rapid transit station (Tower City-Public Square).  During construction of the Red Line rapid transit line in the 1950s the citizens of Cleveland voted to build the Downtown Distributor Subway which would have provided a number of Center City stations.  The plan was quashed by highway promoting County Engineer Albert S. Porter and the full development and growth of center city Cleveland has since been significantly impeded due to the resulting inaccessibility.\n\n====Inter-city bus lines====\nNational [[intercity bus]] service is provided at a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] station, located just behind the [[Playhouse Square]] theater district.

The named avenues that lie both on the east side of the Cuyahoga River and west of Ontario Street receive a \"west\" designation on street signage. The two downtown avenues which span the Cuyahoga change names on the west side of the river. Superior Avenue becomes Detroit Avenue on the west side, and Carnegie Avenue becomes Lorain Avenue. The bridges that make these connections are often called the [[Detroit\u2013Superior Bridge]] and the [[Lorain\u2013Carnegie Bridge]].\n\n====Freeways====\nThree two-digit [[Interstate highway]]s serve Cleveland directly. [[Interstate 71]] begins just southwest of downtown and is the major route from downtown Cleveland to the airport. I-71 runs through the southwestern suburbs and eventually connects Cleveland with [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Cincinnati]]. [[Interstate 77]] begins in downtown Cleveland and runs almost due south through the southern suburbs. I-77 sees the least traffic of the three interstates, although it does connect Cleveland to [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]]. [[Interstate 90]] connects the two sides of Cleveland, and is the northern terminus for both I-71 and I-77. Running due east\u2013west through the west side suburbs, I-90 turns northeast at the junction with and I-490, and is known as the Innerbelt through downtown. At the junction with the Shoreway, I-90 makes a 90-degree turn known in the area as [[Dead Man's Curve]], then continues northeast, entering [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake County]] near the eastern split with [[Ohio State Route 2]]. Cleveland is also served by two three-digit interstates, [[Interstate 480 (Ohio)|Interstate 480]], which enters Cleveland briefly at a few points and [[Interstate 490 (Ohio)|Interstate 490]], which connects I-77 with the junction of I-90 and I-71 just south of downtown.<ref>[http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-490_oh.html Interstate 490 Cleveland.] Interstate-Guide.com.

The [[Cleveland Memorial Shoreway]] carries State Route 2 along its length, and at varying points also carries [[U.S. Route 6|US 6]], [[U.S. Route 20|US 20]] and I-90. The Jennings Freeway ([[Ohio State Route 176|State Route 176]]) connects I-71 just south of I-90 to I-480 near the suburbs of [[Parma, Ohio|Parma]] and [[Brooklyn Heights, Ohio|Brooklyn Heights]].

In the 17th century, the [[Puritan]] and [[Presbyterian]] factions continued to challenge the leadership of the Church which under the Stuarts veered towards a more catholic interpretation of the Elizabethan Settlement especially under Archbishop Laud and the rise of the concept of Anglicanism as the [[via media]]. After the victory of the Parliamentarians the Prayer Book was abolished and the Presbyterian and Independent factions dominated. The Episcopacy was abolished. The [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] restored the Church of England, episcopacy and the Prayer Book. Papal recognition of [[George III of England|George&nbsp;III]] in 1766 led to greater religious tolerance.\n\nSince the English Reformation, the Church of England has used a [[liturgy]] in English. The church contains several doctrinal strands, the main three known as [[Anglo-Catholic]], [[Evangelical Anglicanism|Evangelical]] and [[Broad Church]]. Tensions between theological conservatives and progressives find expression in debates over the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|ordination of women]] and [[Homosexuality and Anglicanism|homosexuality]].

The earliest historical evidence of Christianity among the native [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] is found in the writings of such early Christian Fathers as [[Tertullian]] and [[Origen]] in the first years of the [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd century]]. Three [[Romano-British]] bishops, including [[Restitutus]], are known to have been present at the [[Council of Arles (314)|Council of Arles in 314]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rahner|first=Karl|title=Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WtnR-6_PlJAC&pg=PA301|year=1975|publisher=Herder|location=Freiburg|isbn=978-0-86012-006-3|pages=301\u2013302}}</ref> Others attended the [[Council of Serdica]] in 347 and that of [[Council of Ariminum|Ariminum]] in 360, and a number of references to the church in [[Roman Britain]] are found in the writings of [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]] Christian fathers. Britain was the home of [[Pelagius]], who opposed [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s doctrine of [[original sin]].<ref>Paula K. Byers; 1998, ''Encyclopedia of World Biography'', Page 189 \u2013 Pelagius, {{ISBN|0-7876-2553-1}}</ref>\n\nWhile Christianity was long established as the religion of the Britons at the time of the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Anglo-Saxon invasion]], Christian Britons made little progress in converting the newcomers from their [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|native paganism]]. Consequently, in 597, [[Pope Gregory I]] sent the [[prior]] of the [[San Gregorio Magno al Celio|Abbey of St Andrew's]] (later canonised as [[Augustine of Canterbury]]) from Rome to evangelise the [[Angles]]. This event is known as the [[Gregorian mission]] and is the date the Church of England generally marks as the beginning of its formal history. With the help of Christians already residing in [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], Augustine established his church at [[Canterbury]], the capital of the [[Kingdom of Kent]], and became the first in the series of [[Archbishops of Canterbury]] in 598. A later archbishop, the Greek [[Theodore of Tarsus]], also contributed to the organisation of Christianity in England. The Church of England has been in continuous existence since the days of St Augustine, with the Archbishop of Canterbury as its episcopal head. Despite the various disruptions of the Reformation and the [[English Civil War]], the Church of England considers itself to be the same church which was more formally organised by Augustine.<ref name='DetailedHistory'>{{cite web |url=https://www.churchofengland.org/about-us/history/detailed-history.aspx |title=An Ancient Church - Detailed History |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2016 |website= |publisher=Church of England |access-date=24 October 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nWhile some Celtic Christian practices were changed at the [[Synod of Whitby]], the Christian in the British Isles was under papal authority from earliest times.<ref>Marcus Holden and Andrew Pinsent, ''The Catholic Gift to Civilisation'' (London: CTS), p. 13ff</ref>  Queen [[Bertha of Kent]] was among the Christians in England who recognised papal authority before Augustine arrived,<ref>D.

This meeting of the ecclesiastics with Roman customs with local bishops was summoned in 664 at Saint Hilda's double monastery of Streonshalh (Strean\u00e6shalch), later called [[Whitby Abbey]]. It was presided over by [[Oswiu|King Oswiu]], who did not engage in the debate but made the final ruling.\n\n===Separation from Rome===\nIn 1534, [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] separated the English Church from Rome.<ref name=\"KH8-RC-00\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/tudors/english_reformation_01.shtml The English Reformation by Professor Andrew Pettegree]. Bbc.co.uk.</ref> A theological separation had been foreshadowed by various movements within the English Church, such as [[Lollardy]], but the English Reformation gained political support when Henry VIII wanted an [[annulment]] of his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]] so he could marry [[Anne Boleyn]]. [[Pope Clement VII]], considering that the earlier marriage had been entered under a [[Dispensation (canon law)|papal dispensation]] and how Catherine's nephew, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], might react to such a move, refused the annulment. Eventually, Henry, although theologically opposed to Protestantism, took the position of [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Head of the Church of England]] to ensure the annulment of his marriage. He was [[excommunicated]] by [[Pope Paul III]].<ref>[http://www.historymole.com/cgi-bin/main/results.pl?theme=10026153 King Henry VIII (1491\u20131547)]. HistoryMole (18 September 2010).</ref>\n\nIn 1536\u201340 Henry VIII engaged in the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], which controlled much of the richest land. He disbanded [[monastery|monasteries]], [[priory|priories]], [[convent]]s and [[friary|friaries]] in England, Wales and Ireland, appropriated their income, disposed of their assets, and provided pensions for the former residents. The properties were sold to pay for the wars.  Bernard argues:\n:The dissolution of the monasteries in the late 1530s was one of the most revolutionary events in English history. There were nearly 900 religious houses in England, around 260 for monks, 300 for regular canons, 142 nunneries and 183 friaries; some 12,000 people in total, 4,000 monks, 3,000 canons, 3,000 friars and 2,000 nuns....one adult man in fifty was in religious orders.<ref>G. W. Bernard, \"The Dissolution of the Monasteries,\" ''History'' (2011) 96#324 p 390</ref>\n\nThe population of England at the time is estimated to have been only 2.5 million: half male of whom 750,000 adult. This is one in 75, not 1 in 50. However the latter figure is creditable if secular clergy are included.\n\nHenry maintained a strong preference for traditional Catholic practices and, during his reign, Protestant reformers were unable to make many changes to the practices of the Church of England. Indeed, this part of Henry's reign saw trials for heresy of Protestants as well as Roman Catholics.\n\nUnder his son, [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], more Protestant-influenced forms of worship were adopted. Under the leadership of the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Thomas Cranmer]], a more radical reformation proceeded. A new pattern of worship was set out in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] (1549 and 1552). These were based on the older liturgy in particular the Prayer Book of 1549, but both influenced by Protestant doctrines such as justification by faith alone, the rejection of the sacrifice of the Mass, and the Real Presence understood as physical presence (Cranmer was Calvinist in that he believed Christ was truly and really present in the Eucharist but after a spiritual manner, although the Words of Administration at the time of Communion were a straightforward statement in the Real Presence as taken from the 1549 BCP and attached to the 1559 book). The confession of the reformed Church of England was set out in the [[Forty-two Articles]] (later revised to thirty-nine). The reformation however was cut short by the death of the king. [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], who succeeded him, returned England again to the authority of the papacy, thereby ending the first attempt at an independent Church of England. During her co-reign with her husband, [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip]], many leaders and common people were burnt for their refusal to recant of their reformed faith. These are known as the [[Marian martyrs]] and the persecution led to her nickname of \"Bloody Mary\".\n\n[[File:Rochester cathedral stained glass 2.jpg|left|thumb|Stained glass window in [[Rochester Cathedral]], Kent]]\nMary also died childless and so it was left to the new regime of her half-sister Elizabeth to resolve the direction of the church. The settlement under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] (from 1558), known as the [[Elizabethan Settlement]], tried to find a middle way between radical Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, the ''via media'' (a term that actually only became current in the 1620s), as the character of the Church of England, a church moderately Reformed in doctrine, as expressed in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], but also emphasising continuity with the Catholic and Apostolic traditions of the [[Church Fathers]]. Kneeling reverently to receive communion was the custom. The three-fold ministry in the  Apostolic Succession was maintained; the institutional continuity of the Church was preserved without break (at her accession almost all clergy had been ordained in Catholic Orders using the Roman Pontifical) by consecration of bishops in Catholics Orders, although the character of the organization was changed by the adoption of some reformed doctrines, the simplification of the outwards forms of worship and the abandonment of traditional vestments and art work; the retention of medieval Canon Law, liturgical music and a much shortened Calendar of Saints and Feast Days. It was a most peculiar situation: the same organization but with a modified face to the world without much particular character of its own until the notion of Anglicanism as a distinct variety of Christianity emerged very late in her reign and during the reigns of the early Stuart Kings.  It was also an [[established church]] (constitutionally established by the state with the Head of State as its [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|supreme governor]]).  The exact nature of the relationship between church and state would be a source of continued friction into the next century.\n\n===Stuart period===\n{{further|Stuart period}}\nFor the next century, through the reigns of [[James VI and I|James I]], who ordered the translation of the Bible known as the King James Version (authorized to be used in parishes which does not mean it was the official version),<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tC1kuaetNqoC&dq=The+Diary+Of+Samuel+Ward,+A+Translator+Of+The+1611+King+James+Bible%E2%80%8E The Diary Of Samuel Ward: A Translator Of The 1611 King James Bible], edited by [[John Wilson Cowart]] and M. M. Knappen</ref> and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], culminating in the [[English Civil War]] and the Protectorate of [[Oliver Cromwell]], there were significant swings back and forth between two factions: the [[Puritans]] (and other radicals) who sought more far-reaching Protestant reforms, and the more conservative churchmen who aimed to keep closer to traditional beliefs and Catholic practices. The failure of political and ecclesiastical authorities to submit to Puritan demands for more extensive reform was one of the causes of open warfare. By Continental standards the level of violence over religion was not high, since the Civil War was mainly about politics, but the casualties included King Charles I and the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[William Laud]] and tens of thousands of civilians who died from the unsettled conditions. Under the Commonwealth and the Protectorate of England from 1649 to 1660, the bishops were dethroned and former practices were outlawed, and [[Presbyterian polity|Presbyterian]] ecclesiology was introduced in place of the episcopate. The 39 Articles were replaced by the [[Westminster Confession]], the Book of Common Prayer by the Directory of Public Worship. Despite this, about one quarter of English clergy refused to conform to this form of State Presbyterianism.\n\n[[File:CANTEBURY ALTAR HORIZONTAL 7424.jpg|thumb|Major repairs were done to Canterbury Cathedral after the Restoration in 1660]]\n\nWith the Restoration of Charles II, Parliament restored the Church of England to a form not far removed from the Elizabethan version. One difference was that the ideal of encompassing all the people of England in one religious organisation, taken for granted by the Tudors, had to be abandoned. The religious landscape of England assumed its present form, with the Anglican established church occupying the middle ground, and those Puritans and Protestants who [[English Dissenters|dissented]] from the Anglican establishment,  having to continue their existence outside the national church rather than trying to influence or trying to gain control of it. One result of the Restoration was the ousting of 2,000 parish ministers who had not been ordained by bishops in the Apostolic Succession or had been by ministers in presbyter's orders. Official suspicion and legal restrictions continued well into the 19th century. Roman Catholics, perhaps 5% of the English population (down from 20% in 1600) were grudgingly tolerated, having had little or no official representation after the Pope's excommunication of Queen Elizabeth in 1570, though the Stuarts were sympathetic to them. By the end of 18th century they had dwindled to 1% of the population mostly among eccentric upper middle-class gentry and their tenants and extended families.\n\n===19th century===\nBy the Fifth Article of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Union with Ireland 1800]], the Church of England and [[Church of Ireland]] were united into \"one Protestant Episcopal church, to be called, the United Church of England and Ireland\".<ref>''The Laws of England'', p.104</ref> Although this union was declared \"an essential and fundamental Part of the Union\",<ref>[http://www.rahbarnes.co.uk/Union/ActOfUnion%28Ireland%29.php Article Fifth of \"An Act for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland\" 1800]. rahbarnes.co.uk Union pages</ref> the [[Irish Church Act 1869]] separated the Irish part of the church again and disestablished it, the Act coming into effect on 1 January 1871.\n\n===Overseas developments===\n[[File:John Smith 1624 map of Bermuda with Forts 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Captain [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith's]] 1624 map of Bermuda, showing St Peter's at centre, left]]\n{{main|Anglican Communion}}\n{{further|Historical development of Church of England dioceses#Colonial dioceses}}\nAs the [[British Empire]] expanded, British colonists and colonial administrators took the established church doctrines and practices together with ordained ministry and formed overseas branches of the Church of England. As they developed or, beginning with the United States of America, became sovereign or independent states, many of their churches became separate organisationally but remained linked to the Church of England through the [[Anglican Communion]].\n\nIn Bermuda, the oldest remaining English colony (now designated a [[British Overseas Territory]]), the first Church of England services were performed by the Reverend Richard Buck, one of the survivors of the 1609 wreck of the ''[[Sea Venture]]'' which initiated Bermuda's permanent settlement. The nine parishes of the Church of England in [[Bermuda]], each with its own church and [[Glebe|glebe land]], rarely had more than a pair of ordained ministers to share between them until the Nineteenth Century. From 1825 to 1839, Bermuda's parishes were attached to the [[Diocese of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island|See of Nova Scotia]]. Bermuda was then grouped into the new Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda from 1839. In 1879, the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed. At the same time, a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the [[Diocese of Newfoundland]], but both continued to be grouped under the ''Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda'' until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own Bishop.\n\nThe Church of England in Bermuda was renamed in 1978 as the [[Anglican Church of Bermuda]], which is an [[Extra-provincial Anglican churches|extra-provincial diocese]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/tour/index.cfm|title=Member Churches|first=Anglican Communion|last=Office|publisher=}}</ref> with both [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] and [[Primate (bishop)|primatial]] authority coming directly from the Archbishop of Canterbury. Among its parish churches is [[St. Peter's Church, St. George's|St Peter's Church]] in the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] of [[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's Town]], which is both the oldest Anglican and the oldest non-Roman Catholic church in the New World.\n\n===21st century===\n\n====Deposition from holy orders overturned====\n\nUnder the guidance of [[Rowan Williams]] and with significant pressure from clergy union representatives, the ecclesiastical penalty for convicted felons to be defrocked was set aside from the [[List of Church of England Measures|Clergy Discipline Measure 2003]].  The clergy union argued that the penalty was unfair to victims of hypothetical miscarriages of criminal justice, because the ecclesiastical penalty is considered irreversible. Although clerics can still be banned for life from ministry, they remain ordained as priests.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11735289/Church-of-England-could-return-to-defrocking-rogue-priests-after-child-abuse-scandals.html telegraph.co.uk: \"Church of England could return to defrocking rogue priests after child abuse scandals\"], 13 July 2015</ref>\n\n====Dwindling congregations====\n[[File:Holy trinity front 8809.jpg|thumb|One of the now \"redundant\" buildings, [[Holy Trinity Church, Wensley]], in North Yorkshire; much of the current structure was built in the 14th and 15th Centuries]]\n\nThe archbishops of [[Justin Welby|Canterbury]] and [[John Sentamu|York]] warned in January 2015 that the Church of England will no longer be able to carry on in its current form unless the downward spiral in membership is somehow reversed as typical Sunday attendances had halved to 800,000 in the previous 40 years:<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11340590/Church-of-England-cannot-carry-on-as-it-is-unless-decline-urgently-reversed-Welby-and-Sentamu.html \"Church of England cannot carry on as it is unless decline 'urgently' reversed \u2013 Welby and Sentamu\"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 12 January 2015.</ref>\n{{quote|The urgency of the challenge facing us is not in doubt.

In addition, doctrine is also derived from the teachings of the [[Church Fathers]] and [[ecumenical councils]] (as well as the [[ecumenical creeds]]) in so far as these agree with scripture. This doctrine is expressed in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion]], the [[Book of Common Prayer]], and the Ordinal containing the rites for the ordination of [[deacon#Anglicanism|deacons]], [[Anglican priest|priests]], and the consecration of bishops.<ref name=CanonA5>Canon A5. [http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/churchlawlegis/canons/church.pdf Canons of the Church of England].</ref> Unlike other traditions, the Church of England has no single theologian that it can look to as a founder. However, [[Richard Hooker]]'s appeal to scripture, [[Christian tradition|church tradition]], and [[reason]] as sources of authority continue to inform Anglican identity.<ref name=\"EncRelg349-350\">Massey H. Shepherd, Jr. and Dale B. Martin, \"Anglicanism\" in ''Encyclopedia of Religion'', vol. 1, 2nd. ed., edited by Lindsay Jones (Detroit:Macmillan Reference USA, 2005), pp. 349\u2013350.</ref>\n\n[[File:Canterbury Cathedral - Portal Nave Cross-spire.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Canterbury Cathedral]] houses the ''[[cathedra]]'' or episcopal chair of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and is the cathedral of the [[Diocese of Canterbury]] and the [[mother church]] of the Church of England as well as a focus for the [[Anglican Communion]]]]\nThe Church of England's doctrinal character today is largely the result of the Elizabethan Settlement, which sought to establish a comprehensive middle way between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. The Church of England affirms the Protestant Reformation principle that scripture contains all things necessary to salvation and is the final arbiter in doctrinal matters. The Thirty-nine Articles are the church's only official confessional statement. Though not a complete system of doctrine, the articles highlight areas of agreement with [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] positions, while differentiating Anglicanism from Roman Catholicism and [[Anabaptism]].<ref name=\"EncRelg349-350\"/>\n\nWhile embracing some themes of the Protestant Reformation, the Church of England also maintains Catholic traditions of the ancient church and teachings of the Church Fathers, unless these are considered contrary to scripture. It accepts the decisions of the first four ecumenical councils concerning the [[Trinity]] and the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]]. The Church of England also preserves Catholic Order by adhering to [[episcopal polity]], with ordained orders of bishops, priests and deacons. There are differences of opinion within the Church of England over the necessity of episcopacy. Some consider it essential, while others feel it is needed for the proper ordering of the church.<ref name=\"EncRelg349-350\"/> In sum these express the 'Via Media' viewpoint that the first five centuries of doctrinal development and church order as approved as acceptable be a kind of yardstick by which to gauge authentic catholicity, as minimum and sufficient; Anglicanism did not emerge as the result of charismatic leaders with particular doctrines. It is light on details compared to Roman Catholic, Reformed and Lutheran teachings. The Bible, the Creeds, Apostolic Order, and the administration of the Sacraments are sufficient to establish Catholicity. Indeed, not one major doctrinal development emerged from the English reformation, per Diarmid MacCulloch, The Later Reformation in England, 1990, p.&nbsp;55. The Reformation in England was initially much concerned about doctrine but the Elizabethan Settlement tried to put a stop to doctrinal contentions. The proponents of further changes, nonetheless, tried to get their way by making changes in Church Order (abolition of bishops), governance (Canon Law) and liturgy ('too Catholic'). They did not succeed because the Monarchy, the Church and resisted and the majority of the population were indifferent. Moreover, \"despite all the assumptions of the Reformation founders of that Church, it had retained a catholic character.\" The Elizabethan Settlement had created a cuckoo in a nest...\" a Protestant theology and program within a largely pre-Reformation Catholic structure whose continuing life would arouse a theological interest in the Catholicism that had created it; and would result in the rejection of predestinarian theology in favor of sacraments, especially the eucharist, ceremonial, and anti-Calvinist doctrine\" (ibid pp.&nbsp;78\u201386). The existence of cathedrals \"without substantial alteration\" and  \"where the \"old devotional world cast its longest shadow for the future of the ethos that would become Anglicanism,\" p.&nbsp;79. This is \"One of the great mysteries of the English Reformation,\" ibid that there was no complete break with the past but a muddle that was per force turned into a virtue. The story of the English Reformation is the tale of retreat from the Protestant advance of 1550 which could not proceed further in the face of the opposition of the institution which was rooted in the medieval past, ibid. p.&nbsp;142 and the adamant opposition of Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nThe Church of England has, as one of its distinguishing marks, a breadth and \"open-mindedness\". This tolerance has allowed Anglicans who emphasise the Catholic tradition and others who emphasise the Reformed tradition to coexist. The three \"parties\" (see [[Churchmanship]]) in the Church of England are sometimes called [[high church]] (or [[Anglo-Catholic]]), [[low church]] (or [[evangelical Anglican]]) and [[broad church]] (or [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]]). The high church party places importance on the Church of England's continuity with the pre-Reformation Catholic Church, adherence to ancient liturgical usages and the sacerdotal nature of the priesthood. As their name suggests, Anglo-Catholics maintain many traditional Catholic practices and liturgical forms.<ref name=HighChurch>\"High Church\", ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'', 2nd ed., vol. 6 (Detroit: Gale, 2003), pp. 823\u2013824.</ref> The low church party is more Protestant in both ceremony and theology.<ref name=LowChurch>\"Low Church\", ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'', 2nd ed., vol. 8 (Detroit: Gale, 2003), p. 836.</ref> Historically, broad church has been used to describe those of middle-of-the-road ceremonial preferences who lean theologically towards liberal Protestantism.<ref name=BroadChurch>E. McDermott, \"Broad Church\", ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'', 2nd ed., vol. 2 (Detroit: Gale, 2003), pp. 624\u2013625.</ref>  The balance between these strands of churchmanship is not static: in 2013, 40% of Church of England worshippers attended evangelical churches (compared with 26% in 1989), and 83% of very large congregations were evangelical. Such churches were also reported to attract higher numbers of men and young adults than others.<ref>'New Directions', May 2013</ref>\n\n===Worship and liturgy===\nThe Church of England's official book of liturgy as established in English Law is the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' (BCP). In addition to this book the General Synod has also legislated for a modern [[liturgical book]], ''[[Common Worship]]'', dating from 2000, which can be used as an alternative to the BCP. Like its predecessor, the 1980 ''[[Alternative Service Book]]'', it differs from the ''Book of Common Prayer'' in providing a range of alternative services, mostly in modern language, although it does include some BCP-based forms as well, for example Order Two for Holy Communion. (This is a revision of the BCP service, altering some words and allowing the insertion of some other liturgical texts such as the ''[[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|Agnus Dei]]'' before communion.) The Order One rite follows the pattern of more modern liturgical scholarship.\n\nThe liturgies are organised according to the traditional [[liturgical year]] and the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|calendar of saints]]. The [[Anglican sacraments|sacraments]] of [[baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]] are generally thought necessary to salvation. [[Infant baptism]] is practised. At a later age, individuals baptised as infants receive [[confirmation]] by a bishop, at which time they reaffirm the baptismal promises made by their parents or sponsors. The Eucharist, consecrated by a thanksgiving prayer including Christ's [[Words of Institution]], is believed to be \"a memorial of Christ's once-for-all redemptive acts in which Christ is objectively present and effectually received in faith\".<ref name=EncRelg350>Shepherd, Jr. and Martin, \"Anglicanism\", p. 350.</ref>\n\nThe use of hymns and [[Anglican church music|music in the Church of England]] has changed dramatically over the centuries. Traditional [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Choral evensong]] is a staple of most cathedrals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The style of [[psalm]] chanting harks back to the Church of England's pre-reformation roots. During the 18th century, clergy such as [[Charles Wesley]] introduced their own styles of worship with poetic hymns.\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the influence of the [[Charismatic Movement]] significantly altered the worship traditions of numerous Church of England parishes, primarily affecting those of [[evangelical]] persuasion. These churches now adopt a [[contemporary worship]] form of service, with minimal liturgical or ritual elements, and incorporating [[contemporary worship music]].\n\n=== Women's ministry ===\nWomen were appointed as deaconesses from 1861 but they could not function fully as deacons and were not considered ordained clergy. Women have been [[lay reader]]s for a long time. During the First World War, some women were appointed as lay readers, known as \"[[bishop's messenger]]s\", who also led missions and ran churches in the absence of men. After that no more lay readers were appointed until 1969.\n\nLegislation authorising the ordination of women as deacons was passed in 1986 and they were first ordained in 1987. The [[ordination of women]] as priests was passed by the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]] in 1992 and [[List of the first 32 women ordained as Church of England priests|began in 1994]]. In 2010, for the first time in the history of the Church of England, more women than men were ordained as priests (290 women and 273 men).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9060296/More-new-women-priests-than-men-for-first-time.html|title=More new women priests than men for first time|work=The Daily Telegraph |date=4 February 2012 |accessdate=11 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2005, the synod voted to \"set in train\" the process of allowing the consecration of women as bishops.

L. (ed.) (1957) Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church; p. 1436</ref> Expatriate congregations on the continent of Europe have become the [[Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe]].\n\nThe church is structured as follows (from the lowest level upwards):\n[[File:TootBaldon StLawrence ParishChurch.JPG|thumb|right|The parish church of St Lawrence in [[Toot Baldon]] is typical of many small English village churches]]\n* [[Parish]] is the most local level, often consisting of one church building and community, although many parishes are joining forces in a variety of ways for financial reasons. The parish is looked after by a parish [[Anglican priest|priest]] who for historical or legal reasons may be called by one of the following offices: [[vicar]], [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]], [[priest in charge]], team rector, team vicar. The first, second, and fourth of these may also be known as the 'incumbent'. The running of the parish is the joint responsibility of the incumbent and the [[Parochial Church Council]] (PCC), which consists of the parish clergy and elected representatives from the congregation. The Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe is not formally divided into parishes.\n* There are a number of local churches that do not have a parish. In urban areas there are a number of [[proprietary chapel]]s (mostly built in the 19th century to cope with urbanisation and growth in population). Also in more recent years there are increasingly [[church plant]]s and [[fresh expression]]s of church, whereby new congregations are planted in locations such as schools or pubs to spread the Gospel of Christ in non-traditional ways.\n[[File:Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe.PNG|thumb|right|Map showing the Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe with the archdeaconries colour-coded]]\n* [[Deanery]], ''e.g.'', Lewisham or Runnymede. This is the area for which a [[Rural Dean]] (or area dean) is responsible. It consists of a number of parishes in a particular district. The rural dean is usually the incumbent of one of the constituent parishes. The parishes each elect lay (non-ordained) representatives to the deanery [[synod]]. Deanery synod members each have a vote in the election of representatives to the diocesan synod.\n* Archdeaconry, ''e.g.'', the seven in the [[Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe]]. This is the area under the jurisdiction of an [[archdeacon]]. It consists of a number of deaneries.\n* [[Diocese]], ''e.g.'', [[Diocese of Durham]], [[Diocese of Guildford]], [[Diocese of St Albans]]. This is the area under the jurisdiction of a diocesan bishop, ''e.g.'', the Bishops of Durham, Guildford and St Albans, and will have a cathedral. There may be one or more assisting bishops, usually called [[suffragan bishop]]s, within the diocese who assist the diocesan bishop in his ministry, ''e.g.'', in Guildford diocese, the Bishop of Dorking. In some very large dioceses a legal measure has been enacted to create \"episcopal areas\", where the diocesan bishop runs one such area himself and appoints \"area bishops\" to run the other areas as mini-dioceses, legally delegating many of his powers to the area bishops. Dioceses with episcopal areas include [[Diocese of London|London]], [[Diocese of Chelmsford|Chelmsford]], [[Diocese of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Diocese of Chichester|Chichester]], [[Anglican Diocese of Southwark|Southwark]], and [[Diocese of Lichfield|Lichfield]]. The bishops work with an elected body of [[Laity|lay]] and [[ordained]] representatives, known as the [[Diocesan Synod]], to run the diocese. A diocese is subdivided into a number of archdeaconries.\n* [[Ecclesiastical province|Province]], ''i.e.'', Canterbury or York. This is the area under the jurisdiction of an [[archbishop]], ''i.e.'' the Archbishops of Canterbury and York. Decision-making within the province is the responsibility of the [[General Synod]] (see also above). A province is subdivided into dioceses.\n* [[Primacy of Canterbury|Primacy]], ''i.e.'', Church of England. In addition to his specific authority in his own province, each archbishop is \"Primate of All England\" (Canterbury) or \"Primate of England\" (York) and has powers that extend over the whole country\u2014for example his licence to marry without the [[banns]] (marriage licence).\n* [[Royal Peculiar]], a small number of churches which are more closely associated with [[the Crown]], and, a very few more closely associated with the law, and are outside the usual church hierarchy though conforming to the rite. These are outside episcopal jurisdiction.\n\nAll [[Vicar#Anglican|rectors and vicars]] are [[advowson|appointed by patrons]], who may be private individuals, corporate bodies such as cathedrals, colleges or trusts, or by the bishop or directly by the Crown. No clergy can be instituted and inducted into a parish without swearing the Oath of Allegiance to Her Majesty, and taking the Oath of Canonical Obedience \"in all things lawful and honest\" to the bishop. Usually they are instituted to the benefice by the bishop and then inducted by the archdeacon into the possession of the benefice property\u2014church and parsonage. [[Curate]]s (assistant clergy) are appointed by rectors and vicars, or if priests-in-charge by the bishop after consultation with the patron. Cathedral clergy (normally a [[List of deans in the Church of England|dean]] and a varying number of residentiary canons who constitute the cathedral chapter) are appointed either by the Crown, the bishop, or by the dean and chapter themselves. Clergy officiate in a diocese either because they hold office as beneficed clergy or are licensed by the bishop when appointed, or simply with permission.\n\n===Primates===\n[[File:Justin Welby at Seoul Cathedral.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|right|[[Justin Welby]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]]]\n\nThe most senior bishop of the Church of England is the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who is the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of the southern province of England, the Province of Canterbury. He has the status of [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of All England. He is the focus of unity for the worldwide Anglican Communion of independent national or regional churches. [[Justin Welby]] has been Archbishop of Canterbury since the confirmation of his election on 4 February 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21315054|title=Justin Welby becomes Archbishop of Canterbury|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe second most senior bishop is the [[Archbishop of York]], who is the metropolitan of the northern province of England, the Province of York. For historical reasons (relating to the time of York's control by the [[Danelaw|Danes]]) he is referred to as the Primate of England. [[John Sentamu]] became Archbishop of York in 2005. The Bishop of London, the Bishop of Durham and the Bishop of Winchester are ranked in the next three positions.\n\n===Diocesan bishops===\nThe process of appointing diocesan bishops is complex, due to historical reasons balancing hierarchy against democracy, and is handled by the [[Appointment of Church of England bishops|Crown Nominations Committee]] which submits names to the Prime Minister (acting on behalf of the Crown) for consideration.\n\n===Representative bodies===\n{{Main|General Synod of the Church of England}}\nThe Church of England has a legislative body, the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]]. Synod can create two types of legislation, [[List of Church of England Measures|measures]] and [[canon law|canons]]. Measures have to be approved but cannot be amended by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] before receiving the [[Royal Assent]] and becoming part of the law of England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/churchlawlegis/measures/|title=Summary of Church Assembly and General Synod Measures|date=November 2007|work=Church of England website|publisher=Archbishops' council of the Church of England}}</ref> Although it is the [[state religion|established]] church in England only, its measures must be approved by both Houses of Parliament including the non-English members.

By the 1969 Synodical Government Measure almost all of the Convocations' functions were transferred to the General Synod. Additionally, there are [[Diocesan Synod]]s and [[Deanery#Anglican usage|deanery synods]], which are the governing bodies of the divisions of the Church.\n\n===House of Lords===\n{{Main|Lords Spiritual}}\nOf the 42 diocesan [[archbishop]]s and bishops in the Church of England, 26 are permitted to sit in the [[House of Lords]]. The Archbishops of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Archbishops of York|York]] automatically have seats, as do the Bishops of [[Bishop of London|London]], [[Bishop of Durham|Durham]] and [[Bishop of Winchester|Winchester]]. The remaining 21 seats are filled in order of seniority by [[consecration]]. It may take a diocesan bishop a number of years to reach the House of Lords, at which point he becomes a [[Lords Spiritual|Lord Spiritual]]. The [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]] and the [[Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe]] are not eligible to sit in the House of Lords as their dioceses lie outside the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/directories/house_of_lords_information_office/alphabetical_list_of_members.cfm House of Lords: alphabetical list of Members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702053341/http://www.parliament.uk/directories/house_of_lords_information_office/alphabetical_list_of_members.cfm |date=2 July 2008 }}.

[[Keith Porteous Wood]] of the [[National Secular Society]] stated:\n{{quote|The problem wasn't that bishops weren't trained in such matters, it is the institutional culture of denial and the bullying of the abused and whistleblowers into silence.

I have seen evidence that such bullying persists to this day. I hope that the Archbishop's review into the case of Peter Ball will deal with such bullying and what appears to be the undue influence exerted on the police and CPS by the Church in dealing with this case. The total failure of procedures, outlined by Ian Elliott, echoes that revealed in the totally damning Cahill Report about the conduct of the Archbishop Hope of York in respect of Robert Waddington.

Hermes told Odysseus to use the herb [[moly (herb)|moly]]<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Circe|volume=6|page=381}}</ref> to protect himself from Circe's wizardry and, having resisted it, to draw his sword and act as if he were going to attack her. From there, Circe would ask him to bed, but Hermes advised caution, for even there the goddess would be treacherous. She would take his manhood unless he had her swear by the names of the gods that she would not.\n\nOdysseus followed Hermes' advice, freeing his men and then remained on the island for one year, feasting and drinking wine. According to Homer, Circe suggested two alternative routes to Odysseus to return to Ithaca: toward [[Planctae]], the \"Wandering Rocks\", or passing between the dangerous [[Scylla]] and the whirlpool [[Charybdis]], conventionally identified with the [[Strait of Messina]]. She also advised Odysseus to go to the Underworld and gave him directions.<ref>Homer, ''Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D475 10.475&mdash;541].</ref>\n\n===Later Greek literature===\nTowards the end of [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' (1011[[wikt:ff.|ff.]]), it is stated that Circe bore Odysseus three sons: [[Ardeas]] or Agrius (otherwise unknown); [[Latinus]]; and [[Telegonus]], who ruled over the Tyrsenoi, that is the [[Etruscans]]. The [[Telegony]] (\u03a4\u03b7\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), an epic now lost, relates the later history of the last of these. Circe eventually informed him who his absent father was and, when he set out to find Odysseus, gave him a poisoned spear. With this he killed his father unknowingly. Telegonus then brought back his father's corpse, together with [[Penelope]] and Odysseus' other son [[Telemachus]], to [[Aeaea]]. After burying Odysseus, Circe made the others immortal. According to [[Lycophron]]'s ''Alexandra'' (808) and [[John Tzetzes]]' [[scholia]] on the poem (795 - 808), however, Circe used magical herbs to bring Odysseus back to life after he had been killed by Telegonus. Odysseus then gave Telemachus to Circe's daughter Cassiphone in marriage. Some time later, Telemachus had a quarrel with his mother-in-law and killed her; Cassiphone then killed Telemachus to avenge her mother's death. On hearing of this, Odysseus died of grief.\n\n[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (1.72.5) cites [[Xenagoras (historian)|Xenagoras]], the 2nd century BC historian, as claiming that Odysseus and Circe had three sons: Rhomus, [[Anteias]], and [[Ardeias]], who respectively founded three cities called by their names: [[Rome]], [[Antium]], and [[Ardea, Lazio|Ardea]]. In a very late Alexandrian epic from the 5th century AD, the ''Dionysiaca'' of Nonnus, her son by [[Poseidon]] is mentioned under the name of Phaunos.<ref>Timothy Peter Wiseman, ''Remus: A Roman Myth'', Cambridge University 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7LPNHRUlWacC&lpg=PA48&ots=-_sY_Y5iRY&dq=Phaunos%20Circe&pg=PA47#v=onepage&q=Phaunos%20Circe&f=false pp 47-8]</ref>\n\nIn the 3rd century BC epic, the ''[[Argonautica]]'', Apollonius Rhodius relates that Circe purified the [[Argonauts]] for the death of [[Absyrtus]],<ref>\"They escaped neither the vast sea's hardships nor vexatious tempests till Kirk\u00e9<!--Kirk\u00e9 in original--> should wash them clean of the pitiless murder of Apsyrtos\" ([[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''Argonautica'', iv.586-88, in Peter Grean's translation).</ref> maybe reflecting an early tradition.<ref>See the ancient concept of ''[[Miasma (Greek mythology)|miasma]]'', a Peter Green's commentary on iv. 705-17, ''The Argonautika Apollonios Rhodios'', (1997, 2007) p 322.</ref> In this poem, the animals that surround her are not former lovers transformed but primeval 'beasts, not resembling the beasts of the wild, nor yet like men in body, but with a medley of limbs.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/830/830-h/830-h.htm#2H_4_0006 |title=iv:659-84 |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>\n\nThree ancient plays about Circe have been lost: the work of the tragedian [[Aeschylus]] and of the 4th century BC comic dramatists [[Ephippus of Athens]] and Anaxilas. The first told the story of Odysseus' encounter with Circe. Vase paintings from the period suggest that Odysseus' half-transformed animal-men formed the chorus in place of the usual Satyrs. Fragments of Anaxilas also mention the transformation and one of the characters complains of the impossibility of scratching his face now that he is a pig.<ref>John E.

Later traditions tell of her leaving or even destroying the island and moving to Italy, where she was identified with [[Cape Circeo]].\n\n===Latin literature===\nThe theme of turning men into a variety of animals was elaborated by later writers, especially in Latin. In [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', Aeneas skirts the Italian island where Circe now dwells, and hears the cries of her many male victims, who now number more than the pigs of earlier accounts:\n\n:''\"The roars of lions that refuse the chain,''\n:''The grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears,''\n:''And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' ears.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.7.vii.html|title=Dryden's translation|date=|publisher=Classics.mit.edu|accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>''\n\nOvid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' collects more transformation stories in its 14th book. The fourth episode covers Circe's encounter with Ulysses (lines 242-307). The first episode in that book deals with the story of [[Glaucus]] and [[Scylla]], in which the enamoured sea-god seeks a love filtre to win Scylla's love, only to have the sorceress fall in love with him. When she is unsuccessful, she takes revenge on her rival by turning Scylla into a monster (lines 1-74). The story of the Latin king [[Picus]] is told in the fifth episode (and also alluded to in the ''Aeneid''). Circe fell in love with him too; when he preferred to remain faithful to his wife Canens, she turned him into a woodpecker (lines 308-440).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidMetamorphoses14.html |title=Online translation |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Mamilia (gens)|gens Mamilia]]'' - described by [[Livy|Titus Livius]] as one of the most distinguished families of Latium<ref>''Dictionary of Greek & Roman Biography & Mythology''</ref><ref>[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', 1:49</ref> - claimed descent from Mamilia, a granddaughter of Odysseus and Circe through [[Telegonus]].

Ulysses is depicted as deeper in sorcery and readier of tongue than Circe and through this means he leaves her pregnant with Telegonus. Most of the account deals with the son's later quest for and accidental killing of his father, drawing the moral that only evil can come of the use of sorcery.<ref>John Gower, English Works,  [https://archive.org/stream/completeworksofj03goweuoft#page/204/mode/2up 6.1391-1788]; there is also a [http://www.ellinanderson.com/Circe%20and%20Ulysses.html modern translation] by Ellin Anderson</ref>\n\nThe story of Ulysses and Circe was retold as an episode in [[:de:Georg Rollenhagen|Georg Rollenhagen]]'s German verse epic, ''Froschmeuseler'' (''The Frogs and Mice'', Magdeburg, 1595).

Early philosophical questions were also raised whether the change from a reasoning being to a beast was not preferable after all, and this paradox was to have a powerful impact in the [[Renaissance]]. In later Christian opinion, Circe was an abominable witch using miraculous powers to evil ends. When the existence of witches came to be questioned, she was reinterpreted as a depressive suffering from delusions.<ref>\"Disbelieving in Witchcraft: Allori's Melancholic Circe in the Palazzo Salviati,\" ''Athanor'' 22 (2004), [https://www.academia.edu/7199809/_Disbelieving_in_Witchcraft_Allori_s_Melancholic_Circe_in_the_Palazzo_Salviati._Athanor_22_2004_57-65 pp. 57-65]</ref> Circe was also taken as the archetype of the predatory female until her cause was taken up by women authors, who raised the question of whether this view had more to do with male fantasies than with the truth.\n\n==Artistic representations==\n{{main|Circe in the arts}}[[File:Emile_Levy_-_Circ\u00e9.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Emile_Levy_-_Circ%C3%A9.jpg|thumb|301x301px|[[\u00c9mile L\u00e9vy]]'s ''Circ\u00e9 (''1889)]]\n\nWestern paintings established a visual iconography for the figure, but also went for inspiration to other stories concerning Circe that appear in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''. The episodes of Scylla and Picus added the vice of violent jealousy to her bad qualities and made her a figure of fear as well as of desire. Later male interpretations were to take the metamorphoses she inflicted not just as reflecting a temptation to bestiality but as an emasculatory threat.

Macdonald saw it as essential to the creation of a unified Canadian nation that would stretch across the continent. Moreover, manufacturing interests in [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]] wanted access to raw materials and markets in [[Western Canada]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2017}}\n\n[[File:JaMAC.jpg|thumb|left|[[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. Macdonald]].]]\nThe first obstacle to its construction was political. The logical route went through the American [[Midwest]] and the city of [[Chicago, Illinois]]. In addition to this was the difficulty of building a railroad through the [[Canadian Rockies]]; an entirely Canadian route would require crossing {{convert|1600|km|mi|abbr=on}} of rugged terrain across the barren [[Canadian Shield]] and [[muskeg]] of [[Northern Ontario]]. To ensure this routing, the government offered huge incentives including vast grants of land in the West. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn 1873, Sir John A. Macdonald and other high-ranking politicians, bribed in the [[Pacific Scandal]], granted federal contracts to [[Hugh Allan]]'s Canada Pacific Railway Company (which was unrelated to the current company) rather than to [[David Lewis Macpherson]]'s Inter-Ocean Railway Company which was thought to have connections to the American [[Northern Pacific Railway Company]]. Because of this scandal, the Conservative Party was removed from office in 1873. The new [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] prime minister, [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]], ordered construction of segments of the railway as a public enterprise under the supervision of the Department of Public Works led by [[Sandford Fleming]]. Surveying was carried out during the first years of a number of alternative routes in this virgin territory followed by construction of a telegraph along the lines that had been agreed upon.<ref>{{citation|title=Report on Surveys and Preliminary Operations on the Canadian Pacific Railway up to January 1877|first=Sandford|last=Fleming|year=1877 |url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_30183|accessdate=25 January 2013}}\n</ref> The [[Thunder Bay District, Ontario|Thunder Bay]] section linking [[Lake Superior]] to [[Winnipeg]] was commenced in 1875.

Macdonald confirmed that [[Port Moody, British Columbia|Port Moody]] would be the terminus of the transcontinental railway, and announced that the railway would follow the [[Fraser River|Fraser]] and [[Thompson River|Thompson]] rivers between Port Moody and [[Kamloops, British Columbia|Kamloops]]. In 1879, the federal government floated bonds in London and called for tenders to construct the {{convert|206|km|mi|abbr=on}} section of the railway from [[Yale, British Columbia]], to [[Savona's Ferry, British Columbia|Savona's Ferry]], on [[Kamloops Lake]]. The contract was awarded to [[Andrew Onderdonk]], whose men started work on 15 May 1880. After the completion of that section, Onderdonk received contracts to build between Yale and Port Moody, and between Savona's Ferry and [[Eagle Pass, British Columbia|Eagle Pass]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=cxK0A0FUvZgC&pg=PA786&lpg=PA786&dq=Onderdonk+received+contracts+to+build+between+Yale+and+Port+Moody,+and+between+Savona's+Ferry+and+Eagle+Pass&source=bl&ots=7Mi3FRtoTD&sig=g2jHK990cIQFS5DKB7jJ_Mv5e68&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhtfX1vMzYAhVJRY8KHfyQB14Q6AEINDAC#v=onepage&q=Onderdonk%20received%20contracts%20to%20build%20between%20Yale%20and%20Port%20Moody,%20and%20between%20Savona's%20Ferry%20and%20Eagle%20Pass&f=false|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|last=Cook|first=Ramsay|last2=Hamelin|first2=Jean|date=1966|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9780802039989|language=en}}</ref> {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nOn 21 October 1880, a new syndicate, unrelated to Hugh Allan's, signed a contract with the Macdonald government and Fleming was dismissed. They agreed to build the railway in exchange for [[Canadian dollar|$]]25 million (approximately $625 million in modern Canadian dollars) in credit from the Canadian government and a grant of {{convert|25|e6acre}} of land. The government transferred to the new company those sections of the railway it had constructed under government ownership, on which it had already spent at least $25&nbsp;million. But its estimates of the cost of the Rocky Mountain section alone was over $60&nbsp;million.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleming|1880}}</ref> The government also defrayed surveying costs and exempted the railway from property taxes for 20 years. The Montreal-based syndicate officially comprised five men: [[George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen|George Stephen]], [[James J.

The Canadian Pacific Railway began its westward expansion from [[Bonfield, Ontario]] (previously called Callander Station), where the first spike was driven into a sunken railway tie. Bonfield was inducted into Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2002 as the CPR first spike location. That was the point where the [[Canada Central Railway]] extension ended.<ref>[http://www.railways.incanada.net/Articles/Article2005_2.html Canada Central Railway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021153329/http://www.railways.incanada.net/Articles/Article2005_2.html |date=21 October 2012 }}</ref> The CCR was owned by Duncan McIntyre, who amalgamated it with the CPR, and became one of the handful of officers of the newly formed CPR. The CCR started in Brockville and extended to Pembroke. It then followed a westward route along the [[Ottawa River]] passing through places like Cobden, Deux-Rivi\u00e8res and eventually to Mattawa at the confluence of the Mattawa and Ottawa rivers. It then proceeded cross-country towards its final destination of Bonfield. Duncan McIntyre and his contractor James Worthington piloted the CPR expansion. Worthington continued on as the construction superintendent for the CPR past Bonfield. He remained with the CPR for about a year after which he left the company. McIntyre was uncle to John Ferguson who staked out future North Bay and who became the town's wealthiest inhabitant and mayor for four successive terms.<ref>Berton, Pierre. \"The Last Spike: The Great Railway 1881-1885\".

However, the CPR quickly discarded this plan in favour of a more southerly route across the arid [[Palliser's Triangle]] in Saskatchewan and via [[Kicking Horse Pass]] and down the [[Field Hill]] to the [[Rocky Mountain Trench]]. This route was more direct and closer to the Canada\u2013US border, making it easier for the CPR to keep American railways from encroaching on the Canadian market. However, this route also had several disadvantages.\n\nOne was that the CPR would need to find a route through the [[Selkirk Mountains]] in British Columbia while, at the time, it was not known whether a route even existed. The job of finding a pass was assigned to a [[surveying|surveyor]] named Major [[Albert Bowman Rogers]]. The CPR promised him a [[cheque]] for $5,000 and that the pass would be named in his honour. Rogers became obsessed with finding the pass that would immortalize his name. He discovered the pass in April 1881<ref>Martin J, Edward. The Railway Stations of Western Canada. Canada: Studio E. 1980.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Downs|first=Art|title=Incredible Rogers Pass|publisher=Heritage|location=Surrey, BC|year=1980|edition=2|page=49|isbn=978-0-919214-08-8}}</ref> and, true to its word, the CPR named it \"[[Rogers Pass (British Columbia)|Rogers Pass]]\" and gave him the cheque. However, he at first refused to cash it, preferring to frame it, saying he did not do it for the money. He later agreed to cash it with the promise of an engraved watch. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nAnother obstacle was that the proposed route crossed land in Alberta that was controlled by the [[Blackfoot]] [[First Nation]]. This difficulty was overcome when a [[missionary]] priest, [[Albert Lacombe]], persuaded the Blackfoot chief [[Crowfoot]] that construction of the railway was inevitable. In return for his assent, Crowfoot was famously rewarded with a lifetime pass to ride the CPR.\n\nA more lasting consequence of the choice of route was that, unlike the one proposed by Fleming, the land surrounding the railway often proved too arid for successful agriculture. The CPR may have placed too much reliance on a report from naturalist [[John Macoun]], who had crossed the prairies at a time of very high rainfall and had reported that the area was fertile.<ref>Lamb, W. Kaye. \"History of the Canadian Pacific Railway\". Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York, New York (1977), p. 79.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nThe greatest disadvantage of the route was in [[Kicking Horse Pass]], at the Alberta-British Columbia border on the continental divide.  In the first {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the {{convert|1625|m|ft|abbr=off}} high summit, the [[Kicking Horse River]] drops {{convert|350|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The steep drop would force the cash-strapped CPR to build a {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} long stretch of track with a very steep 4{{frac|1|2}} percent gradient once it reached the pass in 1884. This was over four times the maximum gradient recommended for railways of this era, and even modern railways rarely exceed a two-percent gradient. However, this route was far more direct than one through the [[Yellowhead Pass]] and saved hours for both passengers and freight. This section of track was the CPR's [[Big Hill]]. Safety switches were installed at several points, the speed limit for descending trains was set at 10&nbsp;km per hour (6&nbsp;mph), and special [[locomotive]]s were ordered. Despite these measures, several serious runaways still occurred including the first locomotive, which belonged to the contractors, to descend the line. CPR officials insisted that this was a temporary expediency, but this state of affairs would last for 25 years until the completion of the [[Big Hill#The Spiral Tunnels|Spiral Tunnels]] in the early 20th century. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n[[File:William Cornelius Van Horne.jpg|thumb|Sir [[William Cornelius Van Horne]].]]\nIn 1881, construction progressed at a pace too slow for the railway's officials who, in 1882, hired the renowned railway executive [[William Cornelius Van Horne]] to oversee construction with the inducement of a generous salary and the intriguing challenge of handling such a difficult railway project. Van Horne stated that he would have {{convert|800|km|mi|abbr=on}} of main line built in 1882. Floods delayed the start of the construction season, but over {{convert|672|km|mi|abbr=on}} of main line, as well as sidings and branch lines, were built that year. The Thunder Bay branch (west from [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]]) was completed in June 1882 by the Department of Railways and Canals and turned over to the company in May 1883, permitting all-Canadian lake and railway traffic from Eastern Canada to [[Winnipeg]], for the first time in Canada's history. By the end of 1883, the railway had reached the Rocky Mountains, just eight kilometres (five miles) east of Kicking Horse Pass. The construction seasons of 1884 and 1885 would be spent in the mountains of British Columbia and on the north shore of [[Lake Superior]].\n[[File:Canadian Pacific Railroad 3.jpg|thumb|left|C.P.R. trestle bridge]]\nMany thousands of [[navvy|navvies]] worked on the railway. Many were [[Europe]]an immigrants. In British Columbia, government contractors hired workers from China, known as \"[[coolies]]\". A navvy received between $1 and $2.50 per day, but had to pay for his own food, clothing, transport to the job site, mail and medical care. After 2{{frac|1|2}} months of hard labour, they could net as little as $16. Chinese labourers in British Columbia made only between 75 cents and $1.25 a day, paid in rice mats, and not including expenses, leaving barely anything to send home. They did the most dangerous construction jobs, such as working with [[explosive material|explosives]] to clear tunnels through rock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/settlement/kids/021013-2031.3-e.html|title=History: Building the Canadian Pacific Railway|publisher=Collectionscanada.gc.ca|accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref> The exact number of Chinese workers who died is unknown. The victims of sickness and accidents were not given proper funerals. Most of the remains were buried into the railroad and the families of the Chinese who were killed received no compensation, or even notification of loss of life. Many of the men who survived did not have enough money to return to their families in China, although Chinese labour contractors had promised that as part of their responsibilities.<ref>''Beyond the Sterile Mountains: the Chinese in British Columbia'', Joseph Morton (1976)<!-- ISBN, pages needed --></ref> Many spent years in isolated and often poor conditions. Yet the Chinese were hard working and played a key role in building the Western stretch of the railway; even some boys as young as twelve years old served as tea-boys. In 2006, the Canadian government issued a formal apology to the Chinese population in Canada for their treatment both during and following the construction of the CPR.<ref>[http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2006/06/22/address-prime-minister-chinese-head-tax-redress Prime Minister Harper's 22 June 2006 speech to the Canadian Parliament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031200301/http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2006/06/22/address-prime-minister-chinese-head-tax-redress |date=31 October 2013 }}.

In response, on 31 January 1884, the government passed the Railway Relief Bill, providing a further $22.5 million in loans to the CPR. The bill received royal assent on 6 March 1884.<ref>Berton, Pierre. \"The Last Spike: The Great Railway 1881-1885\", Random House, 14th edition (1983), p. 267<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>\n\n[[File:LastSpike Craigellachie BC Canada.jpg|thumb|left|[[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Donald Smith]], later known as [[Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Lord Strathcona]], drives the last spike of the Canadian Pacific Railway, at [[Craigellachie, British Columbia|Craigellachie]], 7 November 1885. Completion of the transcontinental railway was a condition of BC's entry into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].]]\nIn March 1885, the [[North-West Rebellion]] broke out in the [[District of Saskatchewan]]. Van Horne, in [[Ottawa]] at the time, suggested to the government that the CPR could transport troops to [[Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan]] ([[District of Assiniboia|Assiniboia]]) in 10 days. Some sections of track were incomplete or had not been used before, but the trip to Winnipeg was made in nine days and the rebellion quickly suppressed. Perhaps because the government was grateful for this service, they subsequently reorganized the CPR's debt and provided a further $5 million loan. This money was desperately needed by the CPR. However, this government loan later became controversial. Even with Van Horne's support with moving troops to Qu'Appelle, the government still delayed in giving its support to CPR. This was due to Sir John A. Macdonald putting pressure on George Stephen for additional benefits. Stephen himself later did admit to spending $1 million between 1881 and 1886 to ensure government support. This money went to buying a \u00a340,000 necklace for Lady MacDonald and numerous other \"bonifications\" to government members.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cruise|first=David|title=The men who built the CPR: Lords of the Line|year=1988|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|page=157}}<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>\n[[File:Telegram to Prime Minister John A.

Four days earlier, the last spike of the [[Lake Superior]] section was driven in just west of [[Jackfish, Ontario]]. While the railway was completed four years after the original 1881 deadline, it was completed more than five years ahead of the new date of 1891 that Macdonald gave in 1881. The successful construction of such a massive project, although troubled by delays and scandal, was considered an impressive feat of engineering and political will for a country with such a small population, limited capital, and difficult terrain. It was by far the longest railway ever constructed at the time. It had taken 12,000 men and 5,000 horses to construct the Lake section alone.<ref>''Canadian Pacific Facts and Figures'' (1937), page 15.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, in Eastern Canada, the CPR had created a network of lines reaching from [[Quebec City]] to [[St. Thomas, Ontario]] by 1885 (mainly by buying the [[Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa & Occidental Railway]] from the Quebec government), and had launched a fleet of Great Lakes ships to link its terminals. The CPR had effected purchases and long-term [[leasing|leases]] of several railways through an associated railway company, the [[Ontario and Quebec Railway]] (O&Q). The O&Q built a line between [[Perth, Ontario]], and [[Toronto]] (completed on 5 May 1884) to connect these acquisitions. The CPR obtained a 999-year lease on the O&Q on 4 January 1884. In 1895, it acquired a minority interest in the [[Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway]], giving it a link to New York and the Northeast United States.<ref>[http://www.thbrailway.ca Toronto, Hamilton & Buffalo Railway Historical Society, Historical Outline].

However, had these shortcuts not been taken, it is conceivable that the CPR might have had to default financially, leaving the railway unfinished. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe first transcontinental passenger train departed from [[Montreal]]'s [[Dalhousie Station (Montreal)|Dalhousie Station]], located at Berri Street and Notre Dame Street at 8&nbsp;pm on 28 June 1886, and arrived at [[Port Moody]] at noon on 4 July 1886. This train consisted of two baggage cars, a mail car, one second-class coach, two immigrant sleepers, two first-class coaches, two sleeping cars and a diner (several dining cars were used throughout the journey, as they were removed from the train during the night, with another one added the next morning). {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n[[File:Canadian Pacific First Train.jpg|thumb|left|First Transcontinental Train arrives in [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]] on 30 June 1886]]\nBy that time, however, the CPR had decided to move its western terminus from [[Port Moody]] to [[Granville, British Columbia|Granville]], which was renamed \"Vancouver\" later that year. The first official train destined for Vancouver arrived on 23 May 1887, although the line had already been in use for three months. The CPR quickly became profitable, and all loans from the Federal government were repaid years ahead of time. In 1888, a branch line was opened between [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] where the CPR connected with the American railway system and its own steamships.

The connection with Saint John on the Atlantic coast made the CPR the first truly transcontinental railway company in Canada and permitted trans-Atlantic cargo and passenger services to continue year-round when [[sea ice]] in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] closed the port of Montreal during the winter months. By 1896, competition with the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] for traffic in southern British Columbia forced the CPR to construct a second line across the province, south of the original line. Van Horne, now president of the CPR, asked for government aid, and the government agreed to provide around $3.6 million to construct a railway from [[Lethbridge, Alberta]], through [[Crowsnest Pass]] to the south shore of [[Kootenay Lake]], in exchange for the CPR agreeing to reduce freight rates in perpetuity for key commodities shipped in Western Canada. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe controversial Crowsnest Pass Agreement effectively locked the eastbound rate on [[cereal|grain]] products and westbound rates on certain \"settlers' effects\" at the 1897 level. Although temporarily suspended during the [[First World War]], it was not until 1983 that the \"[[Crow Rate]]\" was permanently replaced by the [[Western Grain Transportation Act]] which allowed for the gradual increase of grain shipping prices. The Crowsnest Pass line opened on 18 June 1898, and followed a complicated route through the maze of valleys and passes in southern British Columbia, rejoining the original mainline at [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]] after crossing the [[Cascade Mountains]] via [[Coquihalla Pass]].<ref>Canadian Pacific Railway, \"Prairie & Pacific Regions Subdivision Chart and Historical Record\" (1943).<!-- pages?? --></ref>\n\nThe Southern Mainline, generally known as the [[Kettle Valley Railway]] in British Columbia, was built in response to the booming mining and smelting economy in southern British Columbia, and the tendency of the local geography to encourage and enable easier access from neighbouring US states than from Vancouver or the rest of Canada, which was viewed to be as much of a threat to national security as it was to the province's control of its own resources. The local passenger service was re-routed to this new southerly line, which connected numerous emergent small cities across the region. Independent railways and subsidiaries that were eventually merged into the CPR in connection with this route were the [[Shuswap and Okanagan Railway]], the [[Kaslo and Slocan Railway]], the [[Columbia and Kootenay Railway]], the [[Columbia and Western Railway]] and various others.<ref name=\"dormanstoltz\"/>\n\n====The CPR and the settlement of Western Canada====\n[[File:Land Ticket.jpg|thumb|One of the CPR's land offerings, 1883.]]\nPractically speaking, the CPR had built a railway that operated mostly in the wilderness. The usefulness of the prairies was questionable in the minds of many. The thinking prevailed that the prairies had great potential. Under the initial contract with the Canadian government to build the railway, the CPR was granted 25 million acres (100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). Proving already to be a very resourceful organization, Canadian Pacific began an intense campaign to bring immigrants to Canada. Canadian Pacific agents operated in many overseas locations. Immigrants were often sold a package that included passage on a CP ship, travel on a CP train and land sold by the CP railway. Land was priced at $2.50 an acre and up but required cultivation.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Canadian Pacific Railway Co|journal=The Week : a Canadian journal of politics, literature, science and arts|date=January 24, 1884|volume=8|page=127|url=https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n63/mode/1up}}</ref> To transport immigrants, Canadian Pacific developed a fleet of over a thousand [[Colonist car]]s, low-budget sleeper cars designed to transport immigrant families from eastern Canadian seaports to the west.<ref>Jonathan Hanna, \"Colonist Cars Helped Build the West\", ''Momentum'' Fall 2008</ref>\n\n===1901\u20131928===\n[[File:Canadian Pacific Ry free farms 1893.jpg|thumb|CPR advertisement highlighting \"Free Farms for the Million\" in western Canada, circa 1893.]]\nDuring the first decade of the 20th century, the CPR continued to build more lines. In 1908, the CPR opened a line connecting Toronto with [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]]. Previously, westbound traffic originating in [[southern Ontario]] took a circuitous route through eastern Ontario. Several operational improvements were also made to the railway in Western Canada. In 1909 the CPR completed two significant engineering accomplishments. The most significant was the replacement of the Big Hill, which had become a major bottleneck in the CPR's main line, with the [[Big Hill|Spiral Tunnels]], reducing the grade to 2.2 percent from 4.5 percent. The Spiral Tunnels opened in August. In April 1908, the CPR started work to replace the Old Calgary-Edmonton Rail Bridge across the Red Deer River with a new standard steel bridge that was completed by March 1909.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forthjunction.com/dawe-cpr-bridge.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922131727/http://www.forthjunction.com/dawe-cpr-bridge.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 September 2010|title=Canadian Pacific Railway Bridge now 100 years old|publisher=Red Deer Advocate|date=19 March 2010|accessdate=1 December 2012|author=Dawe, Michael|page=34}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lethbridge High Level.jpg|thumb|Lethbridge Viaduct]]\nOn 3 November 1909, the [[Lethbridge Viaduct]] over the [[Oldman River]] valley at [[Lethbridge]], Alberta, was opened.

On 3 January 1912, the CPR acquired the [[Dominion Atlantic Railway]], a railway that ran in western [[Nova Scotia]]. This acquisition gave the CPR a connection to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], a significant port on the Atlantic Ocean. The Dominion Atlantic was isolated from the rest of the CPR network and used the CNR to facilitate interchange; the DAR also operated ferry services across the [[Bay of Fundy]] for passengers and cargo (but not rail cars) from the port of [[Digby, Nova Scotia]], to the CPR at [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]. DAR steamships also provided connections for passengers and cargo between [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]], [[Boston]] and [[New York City|New York]]. On 1 July 1912, the CPR acquired the [[Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway]], a railway on [[Vancouver Island]] that connected to the CPR using a railcar ferry. The CPR acquired the [[Quebec Central Railway]] on 14 December 1912.<ref name=\"dormanstoltz\"/>\n\nDuring the late 19th century, the railway undertook an ambitious programme of hotel construction, building Glacier House in [[Glacier National Park (Canada)|Glacier National Park]], [[Mount Stephen House]] at [[Field, British Columbia|Field]], British Columbia, the [[Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac]] in [[Quebec City]] and the [[Banff Springs Hotel]]. By then, the CPR had competition from three other transcontinental lines, all of them money-losers. In 1919, these lines were consolidated, along with the track of the old [[Intercolonial Railway]] and its spurs, into the government-owned [[Canadian National Railways]]. The CPR suffered its greatest loss of life when one of its steamships, the ''[[RMS Empress of Ireland|Empress of Ireland]]'', sank after a collision with the [[Norway|Norwegian]] collier ''[[SS Storstad]].'' On 29 May 1914, the ''Empress'' (operated by the CPR's [[CP Ships|Canadian Pacific Steamship Company]]) went down in the [[St. Lawrence River]] with the loss of 1,024 lives, of which 840 were passengers.<ref>[http://www.shmp.qc.ca/empress/detail/empressdetailen.html Pointe-au-P\u00e8re Site historique maritime profike] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719075005/http://www.shmp.qc.ca/empress/detail/empressdetailen.html |date=19 July 2013 }}.

Aiding the war effort meant transporting and billeting troops; building and supplying arms and munitions; arming, lending and selling ships. Fifty-two CPR ships were pressed into service during World War I, carrying more than a million troops and passengers and four million tons of cargo. Twenty seven survived and returned to CPR. CPR also helped the war effort with money and jobs. CPR made loans and guarantees to the Allies of some $100 million. As a lasting tribute, CPR commissioned three statues and 23 memorial tablets to commemorate the efforts of those who fought and those who died in the war.<ref>Canadian Pacific Our History.

While the CPR was affected, it was not affected to the extent of its rival CNR because it, unlike the CNR, was debt-free. The CPR scaled back on some of its passenger and freight services, and stopped issuing dividends to its shareholders after 1932. Hard times led to the creation of new political parties such as the [[Canadian social credit movement|Social Credit movement]] and the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]], as well as popular protest in the form of the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020810212509/http://www.ontoottawa.ca/trek/trek.html On to Ottawa Trek website].

The CPR and the CNR shared the honours of pulling the royal train across the country, with the CPR undertaking the westbound journey from Quebec City to Vancouver. Later that year, the Second World War began. As it had done in World War I, the CPR devoted much of its resources to the war effort. It retooled its [[Angus Shops]] in Montreal to produce [[Valentine tank]]s and other armoured vehicles, and transported troops and resources across the country. As well, 22 of the CPR's ships went to war, 12 of which were sunk.<ref>[http://www.cpr.ca/en/about-cp/our-past-present-and-future/Pages/our-history.aspx Canadian Pacific: Our History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311163350/http://www.cpr.ca/en/about-cp/our-past-present-and-future/Pages/our-history.aspx |date=11 March 2014 }}, cpr.ca.

Where railways had previously provided almost universal freight and passenger services, cars, trucks and [[fixed-wing aircraft|airplanes]] started to take traffic away from railways. This naturally helped the CPR's air and trucking operations, and the railway's freight operations continued to thrive hauling resource traffic and bulk commodities. However, passenger trains quickly became unprofitable. During the 1950s, the railway introduced new innovations in passenger service. In 1955, it introduced ''[[The Canadian]],'' a new luxury transcontinental train. However, in the 1960s, the company started to pull out of passenger services, ending services on many of its branch lines. It also discontinued its secondary transcontinental train ''[[The Dominion (passenger train)|The Dominion]]'' in 1966, and in 1970, unsuccessfully applied to discontinue ''The Canadian''. For the next eight years, it continued to apply to discontinue the service, and service on ''The Canadian'' declined markedly. On 29 October 1978, CP Rail transferred its passenger services to [[Via Rail]], a new federal [[Crown corporation]] that is responsible for managing all intercity passenger service formerly handled by both CP Rail and CN. Via eventually took almost all of its passenger trains, including ''The Canadian'', off CP's lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/economy-business/transport/transport-general/via-rail-canada-is-born.html|title=CBC Archives}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, as part of a corporate reorganization, each of the CPR's major operations, including its rail operations, were organized as separate subsidiaries. The name of the railway was changed to CP Rail, and the parent company changed its name to [[Canadian Pacific Limited]] in 1971. Its air, express, telecommunications, hotel and real estate holdings were spun off, and ownership of all of the companies transferred to Canadian Pacific Investments. The slogan was: \"TO THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE WORLD\" The company discarded its beaver logo, adopting the new [[Multimark]] {which, when mirrored by an adjacent \"multi-mark\" creates a diamond appearance on a globe}  that was used\u2014with a different colour background\u2014for each of its operations.<ref>Garden, John F., \"Nicholas Morant's Canadian Pacific\", Footprint Publishing, 1992, p. 55, {{ISBN|978-0969162131}}</ref>\n\n===1979\u20132001===\nOn 10 November 1979, a [[1979 Mississauga train derailment|derailment of a hazardous materials train]] in [[Mississauga, Ontario]], led to the evacuation of 200,000 people; there were no fatalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mississauga.ca/portal/residents/localhistory?paf_gear_id=9700018&itemId=5500001|title=Mississauga Train Derailment (1979)|work=Local history|publisher=City of Mississauga|accessdate=3 May 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cidbimena.desastres.hn/docum/crid/Diciembre2004/pdf/eng/doc4131/doc4131.htm|title=The Mississauga Evacuation, Final Report, November 1981|publisher= Ministry of the Solicitor General of Ontario|accessdate=21 November 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984, CP Rail commenced construction of the [[Mount Macdonald Tunnel]] to augment the [[Connaught Tunnel (British Columbia)|Connaught Tunnel]] under the [[Selkirk Mountains]]. The first revenue train passed through the tunnel in 1988. At 14.7&nbsp;km (nine miles), it is the longest tunnel in the Americas. During the 1980s, the [[Soo Line Railroad]], in which CP Rail still owned a controlling interest, underwent several changes. It acquired the [[Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway]] in 1982. Then on 21 February 1985, the Soo Line obtained a controlling interest in the [[Milwaukee Road]], merging it into its system on 1 January 1986. Also in 1980, Canadian Pacific bought out the controlling interests of the [[Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway]] (TH&B) from [[Conrail]] and molded it into the Canadian Pacific System, dissolving the TH&B's name from the books in 1985. In 1987, most of CPR's trackage in the [[Great Lakes]] region, including much of the original Soo Line, were spun off into a new railway, the [[Wisconsin Central Ltd.|Wisconsin Central]], which was subsequently purchased by [[Canadian National Railway|CN]]. Influenced by the [[Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement]] of 1989, which liberalized trade between the two nations, the CPR's expansion continued during the early 1990s: CP Rail gained full control of the Soo Line in 1990, and bought the [[Delaware and Hudson Railway]] in 1991. These two acquisitions gave CP Rail routes to the major American cities of [[Chicago]] (via the Soo Line) and [[New York City]] (via the D&H).<ref>[http://www.cpr.ca/en/in-your-community/living-near-the-railway/Pages/subsidiaries.aspx Canadian Pacific Subsidiaries website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416052959/http://www.cpr.ca/en/in-your-community/living-near-the-railway/Pages/subsidiaries.aspx |date=16 April 2014 }}.

This rationalization, however, came at a price, as many [[grain elevator]]s in the region known as Canada's [[Breadbasket]] shut down due to not being able to distribute their thousands of bushels of grain through a large enough region. This included all of its lines east of Montreal, with the routes operating across Maine and New Brunswick to the port of Saint John (operating as the [[Canadian Atlantic Railway]]) being sold or abandoned, severing CPR's transcontinental status (in Canada); the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in the late 1950s, coupled with subsidized icebreaking services, made Saint John surplus to CPR's requirements. {{Clarify|date=April 2014}} {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, both CP Rail and CN attempted unsuccessfully to buy out the eastern assets of the other, so as to permit further rationalization. In 1996, CP Rail moved its head office from Windsor Station in Montreal to Gulf Canada Square in Calgary, Alberta. CP consolidated most of its Canadian train control into the new office, creating the Network Management Centre (NMC). The NMC controlled all CP train movement from the [[Port of Vancouver]] to Northern Ontario (Mactier, Ontario). A smaller office was left at Windsor Station, which controlled train traffic from Mactier to the [[Port of Montreal]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn 1996, CP Rail moved its head office to Calgary from Montreal and changed its name back to Canadian Pacific Railway. A new subsidiary company, the [[St. Lawrence and Hudson Railway]], was created to operate its money-losing lines in eastern North America, covering [[Quebec]], Southern and [[Eastern Ontario]], trackage rights to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], as well as the [[Delaware and Hudson Railway]] in the northeastern United States. However, the new subsidiary, threatened with being sold off and free to innovate, quickly spun off losing track to short lines, instituted scheduled freight service, and produced an unexpected turn-around in profitability. On 1 January 2001 the StL&H was formally amalgamated with the CP Rail system. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===2001 to present===\nIn 2001, the CPR's parent company, [[Canadian Pacific Limited]], spun off its five subsidiaries, including the CPR, into independent companies.

Canadian Pacific Railway formally (but, not legally) shortened its name to Canadian Pacific in early 2007, dropping the word \"railway\" in order to reflect more operational flexibility.

A major shift in trade from the Atlantic to the Pacific has caused serious drops in CPR's wheat shipments through [[Thunder Bay]]. It also ships chemicals and plastics (12% of 2016 revenue), automotive parts and assembled automobiles (6%), potash (6%), [[sulphur]] and other fertilizers (5%), forest products(5%), and various other products (11%).  The busiest part of its railway network is along its main line between Calgary and Vancouver. Since 1970, coal has become a major commodity hauled by CPR. Coal is shipped in [[unit train]]s from coal mines in the mountains, most notably [[Sparwood, British Columbia]] to terminals at [[Roberts Bank]] and [[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver]], from where it is then shipped to Japan. CP hauls millions of tonnes of coal to the west coast each year. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nGrain is hauled by the CPR from the [[prairie]]s to ports at [[Thunder Bay]] (the former cities of [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] and [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]]), Quebec City and Vancouver, where it is then shipped overseas. The traditional winter export port was [[West Saint John, New Brunswick]], when ice closed the St. Lawrence River. Grain has always been a significant commodity hauled by the CPR; between 1905 and 1909, the CPR double-tracked its section of track between [[Fort William, Ontario]] (part of present-day [[Thunder Bay, Ontario|Thunder Bay]]) and [[Winnipeg]] to facilitate grain shipments. For several decades this was the only long stretch of double-track mainline outside of urban areas on the CPR. Today, though the Thunder Bay-Winnipeg section is now single tracked, the CPR still has two long distance double track lines serving rural areas, including a {{convert|75|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip}} stretch between [[Kent, British Columbia]] and [[Vancouver]] which follows the [[Fraser River]] into the [[Coast Mountains]], as well as the Canadian Pacific Winchester Sub, a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip}} stretch of double track mainline which runs from [[Smiths Falls, Ontario]] through downtown [[Montreal]] which runs through many rural farming communities. There are also various long stretches of double track between [[Golden, British Columbia|Golden]] and [[Kamloops, British Columbia]], and portions of the original Winnipeg-Thunder Bay double track (such as {{convert|20|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} through [[Kenora, Ontario|Kenora]] and [[Keewatin, Ontario]]) are still double track. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn 1952, the CPR became the first North American railway to introduce [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] or \"piggyback\" [[freight]] service, where truck trailers\nare carried on [[flat car]]s. Containers later replaced most piggyback service. In 1996, the CPR introduced a scheduled reservation-only short-haul intermodal service between Montreal and West Toronto called the ''Iron Highway''; it utilized unique equipment that was later replaced (1999) by conventional piggyback flatcars and renamed ''Expressway''. This service was extended to [[Detroit]] with plans to reach Chicago however CP was unable to locate a suitable terminal. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Passenger trains==\nThe train was the primary mode of long-distance transport in Canada until the 1960s. Among the many types of people who rode CPR trains were new immigrants heading for the prairies, military troops (especially during the two [[world war]]s) and upper class tourists. It also custom-built many of its [[passenger car (rail)|passenger cars]] at its [[CPR Angus Shops]] to be able to meet the demands of the upper class.\n\n[[File:Angus.JPG|thumb|An Angus Shops building converted into an [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des alcools du Qu\u00e9bec|SAQ]] liquor store.]]\nThe CPR also had a line of Great Lakes ships integrated into its transcontinental service. From 1885 until 1912, these ships linked Owen Sound on [[Georgian Bay]] to Fort William. Following a major fire in December 1911 that destroyed the grain elevator, operations were relocated to a new, larger port created by the CPR at Port McNicoll opening in May 1912. Five ships allowed daily service, and included the S.S. ''Assiniboia'' and S.S. ''Keewatin'' built in 1908 which remained in use until the end of service. Travellers went by train from Toronto that Georgian Bay port, then travelled by ship to link with another train at the Lakehead. After World War II, the trains and ships carried automobiles as well as passengers. This service featured what was to become the last [[boat train]] in North America. The ''Steam Boat'' was a fast, direct connecting train between Toronto and Port McNicoll. The passenger service was discontinued at the end of season in 1965 with one ship, the ''Keewatin'', carrying on in freight service for two more years. It later became a marine museum at Douglas, Michigan in the United States, before returning to its original homeport of Port McNicoll, Canada in 2013.<ref>[http://barrie.ctvnews.ca/s-s-keewatin-fires-up-its-engine-1.1432404 \"S.S. Keewatin fires up its engine\"], CTVnews.ca. Retrieved 27 April 2014.</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, passenger traffic declined as automobiles and aeroplanes became more common, but the CPR continued to innovate in an attempt to keep passenger numbers up. Beginning 9 November 1953, the CPR introduced [[Budd Rail Diesel Car]]s (RDCs) on many of its lines. Officially called \"Dayliners\" by the CPR, they were always referred to as ''Budd Cars'' by employees. Greatly reduced travel times and reduced costs resulted, which saved service on many lines for a number of years. The CPR went on to acquire the second largest fleet of RDCs totalling 52 cars. Only the [[Boston and Maine Railroad]] had more. This CPR fleet also included the rare model RDC-4 (which consisted of a mail section at one end and a baggage section at the other end with no formal passenger section). On 24 April 1955, the CPR introduced a new luxury transcontinental passenger train, ''The Canadian''. The train provided service between Vancouver and Toronto or Montreal (east of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]]; the train was in two sections). The train, which operated on an expedited schedule, was pulled by [[diesel locomotives]], and used new, streamlined, stainless steel rolling stock.<ref>Mitchell, David J., \"All aboard! The Canadian Rockies by Train\". Douglas & McIntyre, 1995. p. 134.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nStarting in the 1960s, however, the railway started to discontinue much of its passenger service, particularly on its branch lines. For example, passenger service ended on its line through southern [[British Columbia]] and [[Crowsnest Pass]] in January 1964, and on its [[Quebec Central]] in April 1967, and the transcontinental train ''The Dominion'' was dropped in January 1966. On 29 October 1978, CP Rail transferred its passenger services to [[Via Rail]], a new federal Crown corporation that was now responsible for intercity passenger services in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] presided over major cuts in Via Rail service on 15 January 1990. This ended service by ''The Canadian'' over CPR rails, and the train was rerouted on the former ''Super Continental''route via [[Canadians|Canadian]] National without a change of name. Where both trains had been daily prior to the 15 January 1990 cuts, the surviving ''Canadian'' was only a three-times-weekly operation. In October 2012, ''The Canadian'' was reduced to twice-weekly for the six-month off-season period, and currently operates three-times-weekly for only six months a year. In addition to inter-city passenger services, the CPR also provided [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] services in Montreal. CP Rail introduced Canada's first [[Bilevel car|bi-level passenger cars]] here in 1970. On 1 October 1982, the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de transport de Montr\u00e9al|Montreal Urban Community Transit Commission]] (STCUM) assumed responsibility for the commuter services previously provided by CP Rail. It continues under the [[Agence m\u00e9tropolitaine de transport|Metropolitan Transportation Agency]] (AMT). {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n[[File:West Coast Express Train \u2116. 901 at Waterfront Station Vancouver BC Canada.jpg|left|thumb|West Coast Express at [[Waterfront Station (Vancouver)]].]]\nCanadian Pacific Railway currently operates two commuter services under contract. [[GO Transit]] contracts CPR to operate six return trips between Milton and central Toronto in Ontario. In Montreal, 59 daily commuter trains run on CPR lines from [[Lucien-L'Allier (AMT)|Lucien-L'Allier Station]] to [[Delson-Candiac Line (AMT)|Candiac]], [[Vaudreuil-Hudson Line|Hudson]] and [[Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me line|Blainville\u2013Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me]] on behalf of the AMT. CP no longer operates Vancouver's [[West Coast Express]] on behalf of [[TransLink (Vancouver)|TransLink]], a regional transit authority. [[Bombardier Transportation]] assumed control of train operations on 5 May 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bombardier.com/en/media-centre/newsList/details.bombardier-transportation20131223bombardierwinstrainoperationsco.html|title=Bombardier Wins Train Operations Contract in British Columbia|date=23 December 2013|publisher=Bombardier|accessdate=17 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419021637/http://www.bombardier.com/en/media-centre/newsList/details.bombardier-transportation20131223bombardierwinstrainoperationsco.html|archivedate=19 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Although CP Rail no longer owns the track nor operates the commuter trains, it handles dispatching of two commuter rail lines: the [[Milwaukee District/North Line|Milwaukee District/North]] and [[Milwaukee District/West Line]]s, as part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|Greater]] [[Chicago]]'s [[Metra]] system. CP Rail continues freight service on these segments via trackage rights.\n\n===Sleeping, Dining and Parlour Car Department===\n[[Sleeping car]]s were operated by a separate department of the railway that included the dining and parlour cars and aptly named as the Sleeping, Dining and Parlour Car Department. The CPR decided from the very beginning that it would operate its own sleeping cars, unlike railways in the United States that depended upon independent companies that specialized in providing cars and porters, including building the cars themselves. Pullman was long a famous name in this regard; its [[Pullman Company#Porters|Pullman porters]] were legendary. Other early companies included the [[Wagner Palace Car Company]]. Bigger-sized berths and more comfortable surroundings were built by order of the CPR's General Manager, [[William Van Horne]], who was a large man himself. Providing and operating their own cars allowed better control of the service provided as well as keeping all of the revenue received, although dining-car services were never profitable. But railroad managers realized that those who could afford to travel great distances expected such facilities, and their favourable opinion would bode well to attracting others to Canada and the CPR's trains.<ref>Lamb, W. Kaye. \"History of the Canadian Pacific Railway\". Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York. 1977. pp. 142-143</ref>\n\n==Express==\nW. C. Van Horne decided from the very beginning that the CPR would retain as much revenue from its various operations as it could. This translated into keeping express, telegraph, sleeping car and other lines of business for themselves, creating separate departments or companies as necessary. This was necessary as the fledgling railway would need all the income it could get, and in addition, he saw some of these ancillary operations such as express and telegraph as being quite profitable. Others such as sleeping and dining cars were kept in order to provide better control over the quality of service being provided to passengers. Hotels were likewise crucial to the CPR's growth by attracting travellers. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n'''Dominion Express Company''' was formed independently in 1873 before the CPR itself, although train service did not begin until the summer of 1882 at which time it operated over some {{convert|300|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} of track from Rat Portage (Kenora) Ontario west to Winnipeg, Manitoba. It was soon absorbed into the CPR and expanded everywhere the CPR went. It was renamed '''Canadian Express Company''' on 1 September 1926, and the headquarters moved from Winnipeg, to Toronto. It was operated as a separate company with the railway charging them to haul express cars on trains. Express was handled in separate cars, some with employees on board, on the headend of passenger trains to provide a fast scheduled service for which higher rates could be charged than for LCL ([[Less-than-carload|Less than Carload Lot]]), small shipments of freight which were subject to delay. Aside from all sorts of small shipments for all kinds of businesses such products as cream, butter, poultry and eggs were handled along with fresh flowers, fish and other sea foods some handled in separate refrigerated cars. Horses and livestock along with birds and small animals including prize cattle for exhibition were carried often in special horse cars that had facilities for grooms to ride with their animals. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nAutomobiles for individuals were also handled by express in closed boxcars. Gold and silver bullion as well as cash were carried in large amounts between the mint and banks and Express messengers were armed for security. Small business money shipments and valuables such as jewellery were routinely handled in small packets. Money orders and travellers' cheques were an important part of the express company's business and were used worldwide in the years before credit cards. '''Canadian Express Cartage Department''' was formed in March 1937 to handle pickup and delivery of most express shipments including less-than-carload freight. Their trucks were painted Killarney (dark) green while regular express company vehicles were painted bright red. Express routes using highway trucks beginning in November 1945 in southern Ontario and Alberta co-ordinated railway and highway service expanded service to better serve smaller locations especially on branchlines. Trucking operations would go on to expand across Canada making it an important transport provider for small shipments. Deregulation in the 1980s, however, changed everything and trucking services were ended {{When|date=April 2014}} after many attempts to change with the times. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Special trains==\n\n===Silk trains===\nBetween the 1890s and 1933, the CPR transported raw silk from Vancouver, where they had been shipped from the [[Orient]], to silk mills in New York and [[New Jersey]]. A silk train could carry several million dollars worth of silk, so they had their own armed guards. To avoid train robberies and so minimize insurance costs, they travelled quickly and stopped only to change locomotives and crews, which was often done in under five minutes. The silk trains had superior rights over all other trains; even passenger trains (including the Royal Train of 1939) would be put in sidings to make the silk trains' trip faster. At the end of World War II, the invention of nylon made silk less valuable so the silk trains died out.<ref>Webber, Bernard. \"Silk Trains The Romance of Canadian Silk Trains or 'The Silks'\", The Word Works Publications (1993), pp. 103-107<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>\n\n===Funeral trains===\n[[File:Johnamacdonaldfuneraltrain.jpg|thumb|Funeral train of Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. Macdonald]].]]\n[[Funeral train]]s would carry the remains of important people, such as prime ministers. As the train would pass, mourners would be at certain spots to show respect. Two of the CPR's funeral trains are particularly well-known. On 10 June 1891, the funeral train of Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. Macdonald]] ran from Ottawa to [[Kingston, Ontario]]. The train consisted of five heavily draped passenger cars and was pulled by [[Canadian Pacific 283|4-4-0 No. 283]]. On 14 September 1915, the funeral train of former CPR president [[Sir William Cornelius Van Horne]] ran from Montreal to [[Joliet, Illinois]], pulled by [[4-6-2]] No. 2213. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n[[File:Royaltrain-hopebc.jpg|thumb|left|[[George VI|King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] at [[Hope, British Columbia]].]]\n\n===Royal trains===\n{{Further|Royal and viceroyal transport in Canada}}\nThe CPR ran a number of trains that transported members of the [[Canadian Royal Family]] when they have toured the country. These trains transported royalty through Canada's scenery, forests, small towns and enabled people to see and greet them. Their trains were elegantly decorated; some had amenities such as a post office and barber shop. The CPR's most notable royal train was in 1939. In 1939, the CPR and the CNR had the honour of giving [[George VI|King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] a rail tour of Canada, from [[Quebec City]] to [[Vancouver]]. This was the first visit to Canada by a reigning Monarch. The steam locomotives used to pull the train included CPR 2850, a Hudson ([[4-6-4]]) built by [[Montreal Locomotive Works]] in 1938, CNR 6400, a U-4-a Northern ([[4-8-4]]) and CNR 6028 a U-1-b Mountain ([[4-8-2]]) type. They were specially painted royal blue, with the exception of CNR 6028 which was not painted, with silver trim as was the entire train. The locomotives ran {{convert|5189|km|mi|abbr=on}} across Canada, through 25 changes of crew, without engine failure. The King, somewhat of a [[railbuff]], rode in the cab when possible. After the tour, King George gave the CPR permission to use the term \"[[Royal Hudson]]\" for the CPR locomotives and to display Royal Crowns on their running boards. This applied only to the semi-streamlined locomotives (2820\u20132864), not the \"standard\" Hudsons (2800\u20132819).<ref>Shaak, Larry. \"Royalty Rides the Rails: A railroading perspective of the 1939 Canada/USA Royal Tour\".

It was staffed by the [[University of Saskatchewan]] and operating expenses were covered by the Department of Agriculture.<ref name=\"Review1917 p6\">{{cite book|title=Dominion aid to agricultural instruction in Canada: A review of the work performed by the Provinces with the moneys granted under the Agricultural Instruction Act during the four year period, 1913-1917|page=6|publisher=Department of Agriculture|year=1917}}</ref>\n\n===School cars===\nBetween 1927 and the early 1950s, the CPR ran a school car to reach people who lived in Northern Ontario, far from schools. A teacher would travel in a specially designed car to remote areas and would stay to teach in one area for two to three days, then leave for another area. Each car had a blackboard and a few sets of chairs and desks.

It operates along a {{convert|1050|km|mi|abbr=on}} route from Calgary, through the [[Columbia Valley]] in British Columbia, and returning to Calgary via [[Crowsnest Pass]]. The trip takes six days and five nights. The train consists of up to eight luxury passenger cars built between 1916 and 1931 and is powered by first-generation diesel locomotives.\n\n===Steam train===\n[[File:Canadian Pacific 2816.jpg|thumb|[[Canadian Pacific 2816]] ''Empress'' at [[Sturtevant, Wisconsin]], 1 September 2007]]\nIn 1998, the CPR repatriated one of its former passenger steam locomotives that had been on static display in the United States following its sale in January 1964, long after the close of the steam era. CPR Hudson [[Canadian Pacific 2816|2816]] was re-designated ''Empress 2816'' following a 30-month restoration that cost in excess of $1 million. It was subsequently returned to service to promote public relations. It has operated across much of the CPR system, including lines in the U.S. and been used for various charitable purposes; 100% of the money raised goes to the nationwide charity [[Breakfast for Learning]] \u2014 the CPR bears all of the expenses associated with the operation of the train. 2816 is the subject of ''[[Rocky Mountain Express]]'', a 2011 [[IMAX]] film which follows the locomotive on an eastbound journey beginning in Vancouver, and which tells the story of the building of the CPR.\n\n===Spirit Train===\nIn 2008, Canadian Pacific partnered with the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games]] to present a \"Spirit Train\" tour that featured Olympic-themed events at various stops. [[Colin James]] was a headline entertainer. Several stops were met by protesters who argued that the games were slated to take place on stolen indigenous land.<ref>Rod Mickleburgh, \"Protests are fine, but can the obnoxious profanity\", ''The Globe and Mail'', 26 September 2003, S3</ref><ref>Denis St. Pierre, \"Protest greets Spirit Train\", ''Sudbury Star'', 13 October 2008, p.

In 1971, these businesses were split off into the separate company [[Canadian Pacific Limited]], and in 2001, that company was further split into five companies. CP no longer provides any of these services.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Canadian-Pacific-Railway-Ltd|title=Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP) {{!}} Canadian company|newspaper=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref>\n\n===Telegraph===\nThe original charter of the CPR granted in 1881 provided for the right to create an [[electric telegraph]] and telephone service including charging for it. The telephone had barely been invented but telegraph was well established as a means of communicating quickly across great distances. Being allowed to sell this service meant the railway could offset the costs of constructing and maintaining a pole line along its tracks across vast distances for its own purposes which were largely for dispatching trains. It began doing so in 1882 as the separate Telegraph Department. It would go on to provide a link between the cables under the Atlantic and Pacific oceans when they were completed. Before the CPR line, messages to the west could be sent only via the United States.<ref>''Canadian Pacific Facts and Figures'' (1937), p. 106</ref>\n\nPaid for by the word, the telegram was an expensive way to send messages, but they were vital to businesses. An individual receiving a personal telegram was seen as being someone important except for those that transmitted sorrow in the form of death notices. Messengers on bicycles delivered telegrams and picked up a reply in cities. In smaller locations, the local railway station agent would handle this on a commission basis. To speed things, at the local end messages would first be telephoned. In 1931, it became the Communications Department in recognition of the expanding services provided which included telephones lines, [[News agency|news wire]], [[stock ticker machine|ticker quotations]] for the [[stock market]] and eventually [[teleprinter]]s. All were faster than mail and very important to business and the public alike for many decades before [[mobile phone]]s and computers came along. It was the coming of these newer technologies especially cellular telephones that eventually resulted in the demise of these services even after formation in 1967 of [[CNCP Telecommunications|CN-CP Telecommunications]] in an effort to effect efficiencies through consolidation rather than competition. [[Deregulation]] in the 1980s, brought about mergers and the sale of remaining services and facilities.<ref>Burnet, Robert. \"Canadian Railway Telegraph History\". ''Telegraph Key & Sounder'', Etobicoke, 1996. p. 181</ref>\n\n===Radio===\nOn 17 January 1930, the CPR applied for licences to operate radio stations in 11 cities from coast to coast for the purpose of organising its own radio network in order to compete with the [[CNR Radio]] service. The CNR had built a radio network with the aim of promoting itself as well as entertaining its passengers during their travels. The onset of the Great Depression hurt the CPR's financial plan for a rival project and in April they withdrew their applications for stations in all but Toronto, Montreal and Winnipeg. CPR did not end up pursuing these applications but instead operated a [[phantom station]] in Toronto known as \"CPRY,\" with initials standing for \"Canadian Pacific Royal York\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://advisor.d6cn.com/Travel/ttttqc/Presenting_A_Behind_The_Scenes_Look_At_The_Historic_Royal_York_Hotel_One_Of_Toronto_s_Crown_Jewels_part_I.html|title=Presenting: A Behind-The-Scenes Look At The Historic Royal York Hotel&nbsp;\u2013 One of Toronto's Crown Jewels (part I)|publisher=Advisor.d6cn.com|date=30 August 2007|first=Susanne|last=Pacher|accessdate=29 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208205810/http://advisor.d6cn.com/Travel/ttttqc/Presenting_A_Behind_The_Scenes_Look_At_The_Historic_Royal_York_Hotel_One_Of_Toronto_s_Crown_Jewels_part_I.html|archivedate=8 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> which operated out of studios at CP's [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York Hotel]] and leased time on [[CFRB]] and [[CBLA|CKGW]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/networks/networks_CNR8.html|title=The Radio Broadcast that Fulfilled the Promise|accessdate=19 June 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827010353/http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/networks/networks_CNR8.html|archivedate=27 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A network of affiliates carried the CPR radio network's broadcasts in the first half of the 1930s, but the takeover of CNR's Radio service by the new [[Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission]] removed CPR's need to have a network for competitive reasons and CPR's radio service was discontinued in 1935.\n\n===Steamships===\n{{main|Canadian Pacific Steamships}}\n[[Steamboat|Steamships]] played an important part in the history of CP from the very earliest days. During construction of the line in British Columbia even before the private CPR took over from the government contractor, ships were used to bring supplies to the construction sites. Similarly, to reach the isolated area of Superior in northern Ontario ships were used to bring in supplies to the construction work. While this work was going on there was already regular passenger service to the West. Trains operated from Toronto Owen Sound where CPR steamships connected to Fort William where trains once again operated to reach Winnipeg. Before the CPR was completed the only way to reach the West was through the United States via St. Paul and Winnipeg. This Great Lakes steam ship service continued as an alternative route for many years and was always operated by the railway. Canadian Pacific passenger service on the lakes ended in 1965.<ref name=\"musk\"/>\n\nIn 1884, CPR began purchasing sailing ships as part of a railway supply service on the [[Great Lakes]]. Over time, CPR became a railroad company with widely organized water transportation auxiliaries including the [[Canadian Pacific Railway Upper Lake Service|Great Lakes service]], the trans-Pacific service, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway Coast Service|Pacific coastal service]], the [[Canadian Pacific Railway Lake and River Service|British Columbia lake and river service]], the trans-Atlantic service and the Bay of Fundy Ferry service. In the 20th century, the company evolved into an intercontinental railway which operated two transoceanic services which connected Canada with Europe and with Asia. The range of CPR services were aspects of an integrated plan.<ref name=\"smith186\">Smith, Joseph Russell (1908). {{Google books|Ra4ZAAAAYAAJ|The Ocean Carrier: a History and Analysis of the Service and a Discussion of the Rates of Ocean Transportation|page=186}}<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>\n\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:SS PrincessMary Victoria 14Feb1915 (3).jpg|thumb|right|The 30th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) embarking on the SS ''Princess Mary'' at Victoria, British Columbia en route to the war in Europe\u201414 February 1915.]] -->\n[[File:To the Far East by the white Empress route (11411211505).jpg|thumb|Advertisement for Canadian Pacific steamships to the Far East, 1936.]]\nOnce the railway was completed to British Columbia, the CPR chartered and soon bought their own passenger steamships as a link to the Orient. These sleek steamships were of the latest design and christened with \"Empress\" names (e. g., RMS ''[[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|Empress of Britain]]'', ''[[RMS Empress of Canada (1920)|Empress of Canada]]'', ''[[RMS Empress of Australia (1919)|Empress of Australia]]'', and so forth). Travel to and from the Orient and cargo, especially imported tea and silk, were an important source of revenue, aided by Royal Mail contracts. This was an important part of the [[All-Red Route]] linking the various parts of the [[British Empire]].\n\nThe other ocean part was the Atlantic service to and from the United Kingdom, which began with acquisition of two existing lines, Beaver Line, owned by Elder Dempster and Allan Lines. These two segments became Canadian Pacific Ocean Services (later, Canadian Pacific Steamships) and operated separately from the various lake services operated in Canada, which were considered to be a direct part of the railway's operations. These trans-ocean routes made it possible to travel from Britain to Hong Kong using only the CPR's ships, trains and hotels. CP's 'Empress' ships became world-famous for their luxury and speed.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} They had a practical role, too, in transporting immigrants from much of Europe to Canada, especially to populate the vast prairies. They also played an important role in both world wars with many of them being lost to enemy action, including ''[[RMS Empress of Britain (1930)|Empress of Britain]]''.<ref name=\"musk\">Musk, George.

This began with two paddle-wheelers capable of carrying 16 cars. Passenger cars were carried as well as freight. This service ended in 1915 when the CPR made an agreement with the Michigan Central to use their Detroit River tunnel opened in 1910. Pennsylvania-Ontario Transportation Company was formed jointly with the PRR in 1906 to operate a ferry across [[Lake Erie]] between [[Ashtabula, Ohio]] and [[Port Burwell, Ontario]] to carry freight cars, mostly of coal, much of it to be burned in CPR steam locomotives. Only one ferry boat was ever operated, ''Ashtabula'', a large vessel which eventually sank in a harbour collision in Ashtabula on 18 September 1958, thus ending the service.<ref name=\"musk\"/>\n\nCanadian Pacific Car and Passenger Transfer Company was formed by other interest in 1888 linking the CPR in Prescott, Ontario, and the NYC in Ogdensburg, New York. Service on this route had actually begun very early, in 1854, along with service from Brockville. A bridge built in 1958 ended passenger service however, freight continued until Ogdensburg's dock was destroyed by fire 25 September 1970, thus ending all service. CPC&PTC was never owned by the CPR. [[Bay of Fundy]] ferry service was operated for passengers and freight for many years linking [[Digby, Nova Scotia]], and [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]. Eventually, after 78 years, with the changing times the scheduled passenger services would all be ended as well as ocean cruises. Cargo would continue on both oceans with a change over to containers. CP was an intermodal pioneer especially on land with road and railway mixing to provide the best service. [[CP Ships]] was the final operation, and in the end it too left CP ownership when it was spun off in 2001. [[CP Ships]] was merged with [[Hapag-Lloyd]] in 2005.<ref>[http://www.hapag-lloyd.com/en/about_us/history_between_1971_today.html Hapag-Lloyd website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427225544/http://www.hapag-lloyd.com/en/about_us/history_between_1971_today.html |date=27 April 2014 }}, \"Breakthrough of the container\".

Service included the Vancouver-Victoria-Seattle ''Triangle Route'', Gulf Islands, Powell River, as well as Vancouver-Alaska service. BCCS operated a fleet of 14 passenger ships made up of a number of ''Princess'' ships, pocket versions of the famous oceangoing ''Empress'' ships along with a freighter, three tugs and five railway car barges. Popular with tourists, the Princess ships were famous in their own right especially ''Princess Marguerite'' (II) which operated from 1949 until 1985 and was the last coastal liner in operation. The best known{{by whom|date=June 2014}} of the princess ships, however, is ''[[Princess Sophia (steamer)|Princess Sophia]]'', which sank with no survivors in October 1918 after striking the [[Vanderbilt Reef]] in Alaska's [[Lynn Canal]], constituting the largest maritime disaster in the history of the Pacific Northwest. These services continued for many years until changing conditions in the late 1950s brought about their decline and eventual demise at the end of season in 1974. ''Princess Marguerite'' was acquired by the province's British Columbia Steamship (1975) Ltd. and continued to operate for a number of years. In 1977 although BCCSS was the legal name, it was rebranded as Coastal Marine Operations (CMO). By 1998 the company was bought by the Washington Marine Group which after purchase was renamed Seaspan Coastal Intermodal Company and then subsequently rebranded in 2011 as Seaspan Ferries Corporation. Passenger service ended in 1981.<ref>[http://www.seaspan.com/seaspan-ferries-history \"Seaspan Ferries History\"], Seaspan Ferries website. Retrieved 27 April 2014.</ref>\n\n====BC Lake and River Service====\n{{Main|Canadian Pacific Railway in British Columbia}}\nThe [[Canadian Pacific Railway Lake and River Service]] ([[British Columbia Lake and River Service]]) developed slowly and in spurts of growth. CP began a long history of service in the Kootenays region of southern British Columbia beginning with the purchase in 1897 of the Columbia and Kootenay Steam Navigation Company which operated a fleet of steamers and barges on the [[Arrow Lakes]] and was merged into the CPR as the [[CPR Lake and River Service]] which also served the [[Steamboats of the Arrow Lakes|Arrow Lakes and Columbia River]], [[Steamboats of Kootenay Lake and the Kootenai River|Kootenay Lake and Kootenai River]], [[Steamboats of Lake Okanagan|Lake Okanagan]] and [[Skaha Lake]], [[Slocan Lake]], [[Trout Lake (British Columbia)|Trout Lake]], and [[Shuswap Lake]] and the [[Thompson River]]/[[Kamloops Lake]].<ref name=\"musk\"/>\n\nAll of these lake operations had one thing in common, the need for shallow draft therefore sternwheelers were the choice of ship. Tugs and barges handled railway equipment including one operation that saw the entire train including the locomotive and caboose go along. These services gradually declined and ended in 1975 except for a freight barge on Slocan Lake. This was the one where the entire train went along since the barge was a link to an isolated section of track. The ''Iris G'' tug boat and a barge were operated under contract to CP Rail until the last train ran late in December 1988. The sternwheel steamship ''[[Moyie (sternwheeler)|Moyie]]'' on Kootenay Lake was the last CPR passenger boat in BC lake service, having operated from 1898 until 1957. She became a beached historical exhibit, as are also the ''[[Sicamous (sternwheeler)|Sicamous]]'' and ''[[SS Naramata (steamboat)|Naramata]]'' at [[Penticton]] on [[Lake Okanagan]].<ref>[http://klhs.bc.ca/?page_id=52 Kootenay Lake Historical Society].

These hotels became landmarks famous in their own right. They include [[the Algonquin]] in [[St. Andrews, New Brunswick|St. Andrews]], [[Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac]] in [[Quebec City|Quebec]], [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York]] in Toronto, Minaki Lodge in Minaki Ontario, [[Hotel Vancouver]], [[The Empress (Hotel)|Empress Hotel]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and the [[Banff Springs Hotel]] and [[Chateau Lake Louise]] in the Canadian Rockies. Several signature hotels were acquired from its competitor [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National]] during the 1980s, including the Jasper Park Lodge. The hotels retain their Canadian Pacific heritage, but are no longer operated by the railroad. In 1998, [[Canadian Pacific Hotels]] acquired [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont Hotels]], an American company, becoming [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, Inc.]]; the combined corporation operated the historic Canadian properties as well as the Fairmont's U.S. properties until merged with Raffles Hotels and Resorts and Swiss\u00f4tel in 2006.<ref>[http://www.frhi.com/index.aspx?l=0,21,3266,3292,3296 FRHI Hotels & Resorts website].

Based at [[Vancouver International Airport]], it served Canadian and international routes until it was purchased by [[Pacific Western Airlines]] which merged PWA and CP Air to create [[Canadian Airlines]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Locomotives==\n\n===Steam locomotives===\n[[File:Countess-1.gif|thumb|''[[Countess of Dufferin]]'']]\nIn the CPR's early years, it made extensive use of American-type [[4-4-0]] [[steam locomotive]]s, and an example of this is the ''[[Countess of Dufferin]]''. Later, considerable use was also made of the [[4-6-0]] type for passenger and [[2-8-0]] type for freight. Starting in the 20th century, the CPR bought and built hundreds of Ten-Wheeler-type [[4-6-0]]s for passenger and freight service and similar quantities of [[2-8-0]]s and [[2-10-2]]s for freight. 2-10-2s were also used in passenger service on mountain routes. The CPR bought hundreds of [[4-6-2]] Pacifics between 1906 and 1948 with later versions being true dual-purpose passenger and fast-freight locomotives.<ref>Lavall\u00e9e, Omer. \"Canadian Pacific Steam Locomotives\".

Some of the CPR's best-known locomotives were the [[4-6-4]] Hudsons. First built in 1929, they began a new era of modern locomotives with capabilities that changed how transcontinental passenger trains ran, eliminating frequent changes en route. What once took 24 changes of engines in 1886, all of them 4-4-0s except for two of 2-8-0s in the mountains, for {{convert|2883|mi|km|order=flip}} between Montreal and Vancouver became 8 changes. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The 2800s, as the Hudson type was known, ran from Toronto to Fort William, a distance of {{convert|811|mi|km|order=flip}}, while another lengthy engine district was from Winnipeg to Calgary {{convert|832|mi|km|order=flip}}.\nEspecially notable were the semi-[[streamliner|streamlined]] H1 class [[Royal Hudson]]s, locomotives that were given their name because one of their class hauled the royal train carrying [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] on the 1939 royal tour across Canada without change or failure. That locomotive, No.&nbsp;2850, is preserved in the Exporail exhibit hall of the [[Canadian Railway Museum]] in [[Saint-Constant, Quebec]]. One of the class, No.&nbsp;2860, was restored by the [[British Columbia]] government and used in excursion service on the [[British Columbia Railway]] between 1974 and 1999.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe CPR also made many of their older 2-8-0s, built in the turn of the century, into 2-8-2s.\n\nIn 1929, the CPR received its first [[2-10-4]] [[Selkirk locomotive]]s, the largest steam locomotives to run in Canada and the British Empire. Named after the Selkirk Mountains where they served, these locomotives were well suited for steep grades. They were regularly used in passenger and freight service. The CPR would own 37 of these locomotives, including number 8000, an experimental high pressure engine. The last steam locomotives that the CPR received, in 1949, were Selkirks, numbered 5930\u20135935.\n\n<!-- Note: The last Selkirk built, number 5935, is preserved at the [[Canadian Railway Museum]]. (You can not climb inside but you can touch it). One other 2-10-4 Selkirk from this last order (5930\u20135935) has also been preserved; number 5931. It is displayed, within a chain-link fence, at the main entrance to Heritage Park in Calgary, Alberta. For most of its display life, it was intentionally painted with the incorrect number (5934) and was displayed on the west end of downtown Calgary next to the CPR mainline. It now bears its original and correct number (5931) after being repainted and renumbered for its current display location next to Heritage Park. -->\n\n===Diesel locomotives===\nIn 1937, the CPR acquired its first [[diesel-electric locomotive]], a custom-built one-of-a-kind switcher numbered 7000. This locomotive was not successful and was not repeated. Production-model diesels were imported from [[American Locomotive Company]] (Alco) starting with five model [[ALCO S-2 and S-4|S-2]] yard switchers in 1943 and followed by further orders. In 1949, operations on lines in [[Vermont]] were dieselized with [[ALCO FA|Alco FA1]] road locomotives (eight A and four B units), five [[ALCO RS-2]] road switchers, three Alco S-2 switchers and three [[EMD E8]] passenger locomotives. In 1948 [[Montreal Locomotive Works]] began production of ALCO designs.<ref>Dean, Murray W. and Hanna, David B. \"Canadian Pacific Diesel Locomotives\". Railfare, Toronto, 1981. p. 36</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the CPR acquired 13 [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]]-designed locomotives from the [[Canadian Locomotive Company]] for its isolated [[Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway]] and [[Vancouver Island]] was quickly dieselized. Following that successful experiment, the CPR started to dieselize its main network. Dieselization was completed 11 years later, with its last steam locomotive running on 6 November 1960. The CPR's first-generation locomotives were mostly made by [[General Motors Diesel]] and [[Montreal Locomotive Works]] ([[American Locomotive Company]] designs), with some made by the [[Canadian Locomotive Company]] to [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] and [[Fairbanks Morse]] designs.\n\nCP was the first railway in North America to pioneer [[alternating current|AC]] traction diesel-electric locomotives, in 1984. In 1995 CP turned to [[GE Transportation Systems]] for the first production AC traction locomotives in Canada, and now has the highest percentage of AC locomotives in service of all North American Class I railways.\n\nThe fleet includes these types:\n\n====Active roster====\n*[[EMD GP38-2]]\n*[[EMD GP40]]\n*[[EMD GP40-2]]\n*[[EMD GP20C-ECO]]\n*[[EMD SD40-2]] \n*[[EMD SD60]]\n*[[EMD SD30C-ECO]]\n*[[GE AC4400CW]]\n*[[GE AC4400CWM]]\n*[[GE ES44AC]]\n*[[EMD SD70ACU]].

It was created in 2001 when the CPR's former parent company, [[Canadian Pacific Limited]], spun off its railway operations. On 3 October 2001, the company's shares began to trade on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] under the \"CP\" symbol. During 2003, the company earned $C3.5 billion in freight revenue.

(2009). ''Psychology: Pythagoras to Present''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. (a pp. 143, b pp. 293, c pp. 491)</ref> From that time, major debates ensued through the 19th century regarding whether human thought was solely experiential ([[empiricism]]), or included innate knowledge ([[Psychological nativism|nativism]]). Some of those involved in this debate included [[George Berkeley]] and [[John Locke]] on the side of empiricism, and [[Immanuel Kant]] on the side of nativism.<ref name=\"Anderson\">Anderson, J.R. (2010). ''Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications''. New York, NY: Worth Publishers.</ref>\n\nWith the philosophical debate continuing, the mid to late 19th century was a critical time in the development of psychology as a scientific discipline. Two discoveries that would later play substantial roles in cognitive psychology were [[Paul Broca]]'s discovery of the area of the brain largely responsible for language production,<ref name=\"Malone\" /> and [[Carl Wernicke]]'s discovery of an area thought to be mostly responsible for comprehension of language.<ref>Eysenck, M.W. (1990). ''Cognitive Psychology: An International Review''. West Sussex, England: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. (pp. 111)</ref> Both areas were subsequently formally named for their founders and disruptions of an individual's language production or comprehension due to trauma or malformation in these areas have come to commonly be known as [[Expressive aphasia|Broca's aphasia]] and [[Receptive aphasia|Wernicke's aphasia]].\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1950s, the main approach to psychology was [[behaviorism]]. Initially, its adherents viewed mental events such as thoughts, ideas, attention, and consciousness as unobservables, hence outside the realm of a science of psychology. One pioneer of cognitive psychology, who worked outside the boundaries (both intellectual and geographical) of behaviorism was [[Jean Piaget]]. From 1926 to the 1950s and into the 1980s, he studied the thoughts, language, and intelligence of children and adults.<ref name=\"AboutPiaget\">Smith, L. (2000). About Piaget. Retrieved from http://piaget.org/aboutPiaget.html</ref>\n\nIn the mid-20th century, three main influences arose that would inspire and shape cognitive psychology as a formal school of thought:\n* With the development of new warfare technology during [[World War II|WWII]], the need for a greater understanding of human performance came to prominence. Problems such as how to best train soldiers to use new technology and how to deal with matters of attention while under duress became areas of need for military personnel. [[Behaviorism]] provided little if any insight into these matters and it was the work of [[Donald Broadbent]], integrating concepts from human performance research and the recently developed [[information theory]], that forged the way in this area.<ref name=\"Anderson\" />\n* Developments in computer science would lead to parallels being drawn between human thought and the computational functionality of computers, opening entirely new areas of [[Computationalism|psychological thought]]. Allen Newell and Herbert Simon spent years developing the concept of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) and later worked with cognitive psychologists regarding the implications of AI. This encouraged a conceptualization of mental functions patterned on the way that computers handled such things as memory storage and retrieval,<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> and it opened an important doorway for [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]].\n* [[Noam Chomsky]]'s 1959 critique<ref name=\"Chomsky 1959\">Chomsky, N. A. (1959), ''A Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior''</ref> of behaviorism, and empiricism more generally, initiated what would come to be known as the \"[[cognitive revolution]]\". Inside psychology, in criticism of behaviorism, J. S. Bruner, J. J. Goodnow & G. A. Austin wrote \"a study of thinking\" in 1956. In 1960, G. A. Miller, E. Galanter and K. Pribram wrote their famous \"Plans and the Structure of Behavior\". The same year, Bruner and Miller founded the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies, which institutionalized the revolution and launched the field of cognitive science.\n* Formal recognition of the field involved the establishment of research institutions such as [[George Mandler]]'s Center for Human Information Processing in 1964. Mandler described the origins of cognitive psychology in a 2002 article in the Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences<ref name=Mandler>Mandler, G. (2002). Origins of the cognitive (r)evolution. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 38, 339\u2013353.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Neisser}}[[Ulric Neisser]] put the term \"cognitive psychology\" into common use through his book ''Cognitive Psychology'', published in 1967.<ref name=Neisser>Neisser, U. (1967). ''Cognitive Psychology''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. Neisser's definition on page 4.</ref> Neisser's definition of \"cognition\" illustrates the then-progressive concept of cognitive processes:\n\n<blockquote>The term \"cognition\" refers to all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used. It is concerned with these processes even when they operate in the absence of relevant stimulation, as in images and [[hallucinations]]. ... Given such a sweeping definition, it is apparent that cognition is involved in everything a human being might possibly do; that every psychological phenomenon is a cognitive phenomenon. But although cognitive psychology is concerned with all human activity rather than some fraction of it, the concern is from a particular point of view. Other viewpoints are equally legitimate and necessary. [[Psychodynamics|Dynamic psychology]], which begins with motives rather than with sensory input, is a case in point. Instead of asking how a man's actions and experiences result from what he saw, remembered, or believed, the dynamic psychologist asks how they follow from the subject's goals, needs, or instincts.<ref name=Neisser/></blockquote>\n\n==Mental processes==\n{{see also|Cognitive control}}\nThe main focus of cognitive psychologists is on the [[mental processes]] that affect behavior. Those processes include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n===Attention===\n{{main|Attention}}\nThe psychological definition of [[attention]] is \"a state of focused awareness on a subset of the available perceptual information\".<ref name=APA>{{cite web|title=How does the APA define \"psychology\"? |url=http://www.apa.org/support/about/apa/psychology.aspx#answer |accessdate=15 November 2011}}</ref> A key function of [[attention]] is to identify irrelevant data and filter it out, enabling significant data to be distributed to the other [[mental processes]].<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> For example, the human brain may simultaneously receive [[Auditory system|auditory]], [[visual]], [[olfactory]], [[taste]], and [[Touch|tactile]] information. The brain is able to handle only a small subset of this information, and this is accomplished through the attentional processes.<ref name=Anderson />\n\nAttention can be divided into two major attentional systems: exogenous control and endogenous control<ref name=\"Chicaetal2013\">Chica, A. B., Bartolomeo, P., & Lupi\u00e1\u00f1ez, J. (2013). Two cognitive and neural systems for endogenous and exogenous spatial attention. Behavioural Brain Research, 237107-123. {{doi|10.1016/j.bbr.2012.09.027}}</ref> Exogenous control works from bottom-up and is responsible for [[orienting reflex]], and pop-out effects.<ref name=\"Chicaetal2013\" /> Endogenous control works top-down and is the more deliberate attentional system, responsible for divided attention and conscious processing.<ref name=\"Chicaetal2013\" />\n\nOne major focal point relating to [[attention]] within the field of cognitive psychology is the concept of divided [[attention]]. A number of early studies dealt with the ability of a person wearing headphones to discern meaningful conversation when presented with different messages into each ear; this is known as the dichotic listening task.<ref name=Anderson /> Key findings involved an increased understanding of the mind's ability to both focus on one message, while still being somewhat aware of information being taken in from the ear not being consciously attended to. E.g., participants (wearing earphones) may be told that they will be hearing separate messages in each ear and that they are expected to attend only to information related to basketball. When the experiment starts, the message about basketball will be presented to the left ear and non-relevant information will be presented to the right ear. At some point the message related to basketball will switch to the right ear and the non-relevant information to the left ear. When this happens, the listener is usually able to repeat the entire message at the end, having attended to the left or right ear only when it was appropriate.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> The ability to attend to one conversation in the face of many is known as the [[cocktail party effect]].\n\nOther major findings include that participants can't comprehend both passages, when shadowing one passage, they can't report content of the unattended message, they can shadow a message better if the pitches in each ear are different.<ref name=\"Cherry\">Cherry, E. Colin (1953). \"Some Experiments on the Recognition of Speech, with One and with Two Ears\". The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 25 (5): 975\u201379. {{doi|10.1121/1.1907229}}</ref> However, while deep processing doesn't occur, early sensory processing does. Subjects did notice if the pitch of the unattended message changed or if it ceased altogether, and some even oriented to the unattended message if their name was mentioned.<ref name=\"Cherry\" />\n\n===Memory===\nThe two main types of memory are short-term memory and long-term memory; however, short-term memory has become better understood to be working memory. Cognitive psychologists often study memory in terms of [[working memory]].\n\n====[[Working memory]]====\nThough working memory is often thought of as just short-term memory, it is more clearly defined as the ability to remember information in the face of distraction. The famously known capacity of memory of [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|7 plus or minus 2]] is a combination of both memory in working memory and long term memory.\n\nOne of the classic experiments is by Ebbinghaus, who found the [[serial position effect]] where information from the beginning and end of list of random words were better recalled than those in the center.<ref name=\"Eb\">Ebbinghaus, Hermann (1913). On memory: A contribution to experimental psychology.

One of the most regarded is the [[Baddeley's model of working memory|Baddeley and Hitch model of working memory]]. It takes into account both visual and auditory stimuli, long-term memory to use as a reference, and a central processor to combine and understand it all.\n\nA large part of memory is forgetting, and there is a large debate among psychologists of [[decay theory]] versus [[interference theory]].\n\n====[[Long-term memory]]====\nModern conceptions of [[memory]] are usually about long-term memory and break it down into three main sub-classes. These three classes are somewhat [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] in nature, in terms of the level of [[conscious]] thought related to their use.<ref name=\"Balota\">Balota, D.A. & Marsh, E.J. (2004). ''Cognitive Psychology: Key Readings''. New York, NY: Psychology Press. (pp. 364\u2013365)</ref>\n* [[Procedural memory]] is memory for the performance of particular types of action. It is often activated on a [[subconscious]] level, or at most requires a minimal amount of [[conscious]] effort.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/43595-procedural-memory.html|title=Procedural Memory: Definition and Examples|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref> [[Procedural memory]] includes [[Stimulus-response model|stimulus-response]]-type information, which is activated through association with particular tasks, routines, etc. A person is using [[procedural knowledge]] when they seemingly \"automatically\" respond in a particular manner to a particular situation or process.<ref name=Balota /> An example is driving a car.\n* [[Semantic memory]] is the encyclopedic knowledge that a person possesses. Knowledge like what the [[Eiffel Tower]] looks like, or the name of a friend from sixth grade, represent [[semantic memory]]. Access of [[semantic memory]] ranges from slightly to extremely effortful, depending on a number of variables including but not limited to recency of encoding of the information, number of associations it has to other information, frequency of access, and levels of meaning (how deeply it was processed when it was encoded).<ref name=Balota />\n* [[Episodic memory]] is the memory of autobiographical events that can be explicitly stated. It contains all memories that are temporal in nature, such as when one last brushed one's teeth or where one was when one heard about a major news event. [[Episodic memory]] typically requires the deepest level of [[consciousness|conscious]] thought, as it often pulls together [[semantic memory]] and temporal information to formulate the entire [[memory]].<ref name=Balota />\n\n===Perception===\n[[Perception]] involves both the physical senses (sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch, and [[proprioception]]) as well as the [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] involved in interpreting those senses. Essentially, it is how people come to understand the world around them through interpretation of stimuli.<ref>[http://psychology.about.com/od/sensationandperception/ss/perceptproc.htm Cherry, K. (2013). [[Perception] and the perceptual process]</ref> Early psychologists like [[Edward Titchener|Edward B. Titchener]] began to work with perception in their [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralist]] approach to psychology. [[Structuralism (psychology)|Structuralism]] dealt heavily with trying to reduce human thought (or \"consciousness,\" as Titchener would have called it) into its most basic elements by gaining understanding of how an individual perceives particular stimuli.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/titchener.shtml |title=Plucker, J. (2012). Edward Bradford Titchener |publisher=Indiana.edu |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref>\n\nCurrent perspectives on [[perception]] within cognitive psychology tend to focus on particular ways in which the human mind interprets stimuli from the senses and how these interpretations affect behavior. An example of the way in which modern psychologists approach the study of [[perception]] is the research being done at the Center for Ecological Study of Perception and Action at the University of Connecticut (CESPA). One study at CESPA concerns ways in which individuals perceive their physical environment and how that influences their navigation through that environment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ione.psy.uconn.edu/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970412101520/http://ione.psy.uconn.edu/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1997-04-12 |title=University of Connecticut (N.D.).

A study from 2012, showed that while this can be an effective strategy, it is important that those making evaluations include all relevant information when making their assessments. Factors such as individual variability, [[socioeconomic status]], [[Short-term memory|short-term]] and [[long-term memory]] capacity, and others must be included in order to make valid assessments.<ref name=Ramsden />\n\n===Metacognition===\n[[Metacognition]], in a broad sense, is the thoughts that a person has about their own thoughts. More specifically, metacognition includes things like:\n* How effective a person is at monitoring their own performance on a given task (self-regulation).\n* A person's understanding of their capabilities on particular mental tasks.\n* The ability to apply [[Cognitive style|cognitive strategies]].<ref>{{jstor|20442131}} Martinez, M.E. (2006). What is metacognition. ''The Phi Delta Kappan'', 87(9), 696\u2013699</ref>\nMuch of the current study regarding metacognition within the field of cognitive psychology deals with its application within the area of education. Being able to increase a student's metacognitive abilities has been shown to have a significant impact on their learning and study habits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.brainscape.com/2010/04/learning-study-less/ |title=Cohen, A. (2010). The secret to learning more while studying |publisher=Blog.brainscape.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref> One key aspect of this concept is the improvement of students' ability to set goals and self-regulate effectively to meet those goals. As a part of this process, it is also important to ensure that students are realistically evaluating their personal degree of knowledge and setting realistic goals (another metacognitive task).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/metacognition/teaching_metacognition.html |title=Lovett, M. (2008).

(2003) \"A perspective on judgement and choice.\" ''American Psychologist''. ''58'', 697\u2013720.</ref> Kahneman differentiated the two styles of processing more, calling them intuition and reasoning. Intuition (or system 1), similar to associative reasoning, was determined to be fast and automatic, usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning process. Kahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and very difficult to change or manipulate. Reasoning (or system 2) was slower and much more volatile, being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes.<ref name=Kahneman />\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Abnormal psychology===\nFollowing the cognitive revolution, and as a result of many of the principle discoveries to come out of the field of cognitive psychology, the discipline of cognitive therapy evolved. [[Aaron T. Beck]] is generally regarded as the father of cognitive therapy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/suicide/beck/index.html |title=University of Pennsylvania (N.D). Aaron T. Beck, M.D |publisher=Med.upenn.edu |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2014-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914094322/http://www.med.upenn.edu/suicide/beck/index.html |archive-date=2017-09-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> His work in the areas of recognition and treatment of depression has gained worldwide recognition. In his 1987 book titled ''Cognitive Therapy of Depression'', Beck puts forth three salient points with regard to his reasoning for the treatment of depression by means of therapy or therapy and antidepressants versus using a pharmacological-only approach:\n<blockquote>1. Despite the prevalent use of antidepressants, the fact remains that not all patients respond to them. Beck cites (in 1987) that only 60 to 65% of patients respond to antidepressants, and recent [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] (a statistical breakdown of multiple studies) show very similar numbers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grohol |first=John M. |url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2009/02/03/efficacy-of-antidepressants/ |title=Grohol, J. (2009). Efficacy of Antidepressants |publisher=Psychcentral.com |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref><br>2. Many of those who do respond to antidepressants end up not taking their medications, for various reasons. They may develop side-effects or have some form of personal objection to taking the drugs.<br>3. Beck posits that the use of [[Psychotropic|psychotropic drugs]] may lead to an eventual breakdown in the individual's [[Coping (psychology)|coping mechanisms]]. His theory is that the person essentially becomes reliant on the medication as a means of improving mood and fails to practice those coping techniques typically practiced by healthy individuals to alleviate the effects of depressive symptoms. By failing to do so, once the patient is weaned off of the antidepressants, they often are unable to cope with normal levels of depressed mood and feel driven to reinstate use of the antidepressants.<ref>Beck, A.T. (1987). ''Cognitive Therapy of Depression''. New York, NY: Guilford Press</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Social psychology===\nMany facets of modern social psychology have roots in research done within the field of cognitive psychology.{{Citation needed|reason=The reverse is also true, and the page linked in the next sentence also has a citation needed tag related to the link between social cognition and cognitive psychology.|date=November 2017}} [[Social cognition]] is a specific sub-set of social psychology that concentrates on processes that have been of particular focus within cognitive psychology, specifically applied to human interactions. [[Gordon Moskowitz|Gordon B. Moskowitz]] defines social cognition as \"... the study of the mental processes involved in perceiving, attending to, remembering, thinking about, and making sense of the people in our social world\".<ref>Moskowitz, G.B. (2004). ''Social Cognition: Understanding Self and Others''. New York, NY: The Guilford Press. (pp. 3)</ref>\n\nThe development of multiple [[social information processing (theory)|social information processing]] (SIP) models  has been influential in studies involving aggressive and anti-social behavior. Kenneth Dodge's SIP model is one of, if not the most, empirically supported models relating to aggression. Among his research, Dodge posits that children who possess a greater ability to process social information more often display higher levels of socially acceptable behavior. His model asserts that there are five steps that an individual proceeds through when evaluating interactions with other individuals and that how the person interprets cues is key to their reactionary process.<ref>Fontaine, R.G. (2012). ''The Mind of the Criminal: The Role of Developmental Social Cognition in Criminal Defense Law''. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. (p. 41)</ref>\n\n===Developmental psychology===\nMany of the prominent names in the field of developmental psychology base their understanding of development on cognitive models. One of the major paradigms of developmental psychology, the [[Theory of Mind]] (ToM), deals specifically with the ability of an individual to effectively understand and attribute cognition to those around them. This concept typically becomes fully apparent in children between the ages of 4 and 6. Essentially, before the child develops ToM, they are unable to understand that those around them can have different thoughts, ideas, or feelings than themselves. The development of ToM is a matter of [[metacognition]], or thinking about one's thoughts. The child must be able to recognize that they have their own thoughts and in turn, that others possess thoughts of their own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/documents/Astington-EdwardANGxp.pdf |title=Astington, J.W. & Edward, M.J.

Encyclopedia on Early Childhood Development, 2010:1\u20136 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref><br>\n\nOne of the foremost minds with regard to developmental psychology, Jean Piaget, focused much of his attention on cognitive development from birth through adulthood. Though there have been considerable challenges to parts of his [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|stages of cognitive development]], they remain a staple in the realm of education. Piaget's concepts and ideas predated the cognitive revolution but inspired a wealth of research in the field of cognitive psychology and many of his principles have been blended with modern theory to synthesize the predominant views of today.<ref>Brainerd, C.J. (1996). \"Piaget: A centennial celebration.\" ''Psychological Science'', 7(4), 191\u2013194.</ref>\n\n===Educational psychology===\nModern theories of education have applied many concepts that are focal points of cognitive psychology. Some of the most prominent concepts include:\n* Metacognition: Metacognition is a broad concept encompassing all manners of one's thoughts and knowledge about their own thinking. A key area of educational focus in this realm is related to self-monitoring, which relates highly to how well students are able to evaluate their personal knowledge and apply strategies to improve knowledge in areas in which they are lacking.<ref name=\"Reif\">Reif, F. (2008). ''Applying Cognitive Science to Education: Thinking and Learning in Scientific and Other Complex Domains''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. (a pp. 283\u201384, b pp. 38)</ref>\n* [[Declarative knowledge]] and [[procedural knowledge]]: Declarative knowledge is a persons 'encyclopedic' knowledge base, whereas procedural knowledge is specific knowledge relating to performing particular tasks. The application of these cognitive paradigms to education attempts to augment a student's ability to integrate declarative knowledge into newly learned procedures in an effort to facilitate accelerated learning.<ref name=\"Reif\" />\n* [[Knowledge organization]]: Applications of cognitive psychology's understanding of how knowledge is organized in the brain has been a major focus within the field of education in recent years. The hierarchical method of organizing information and how that maps well onto the brain's memory are concepts that have proven extremely beneficial in classrooms.<ref name=\"Reif\" />\n\n===Personality psychology===\nCognitive therapeutic approaches have received considerable attention in the treatment of personality disorders in recent years. The approach focuses on the formation of what it believes to be faulty schemata, centralized on judgmental biases and general cognitive errors.<ref>Beck, A.T., Freeman, A., & Davis, D.D. (2004). ''Cognitive Therapy of Personality Disorders'' (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford Press. (pp. 300).</ref>\n\n==Cognitive psychology vs. cognitive science==\nThe line between cognitive psychology and [[cognitive science]] can be blurry. The differentiation between the two is best understood in terms of cognitive psychology's relationship to [[applied psychology]], and the understanding of psychological phenomena. Cognitive psychologists are often heavily involved in running psychological experiments involving human participants, with the goal of gathering information related to how the human mind takes in, processes, and acts upon inputs received from the outside world.<ref>Baddeley, A. & Bernses, O.A. (1989). ''Cognitive Psychology: Research Directions In Cognitive Science: European Perspectives'', Vol 1 (pp. 7). East Sussex, UK: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Ltd. (pg. 7)</ref> The information gained in this area is then often used in the applied field of clinical psychology.\n\nCognitive science is better understood as predominantly concerned with gathering data through research. Cognitive science envelopes a much broader scope, which has links to philosophy, linguistics, anthropology, neuroscience, and particularly with artificial intelligence. It could be said that cognitive science provides the database of information that fuels the theory from which cognitive psychologists operate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognitive-science/ |title=Thagard, P. (2010). Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref> Cognitive scientists' research sometimes involves non-human subjects, allowing them to delve into areas which would come under ethical scrutiny if performed on human participants. I.e., they may do research implanting devices in the brains of rats to track the firing of neurons while the rat performs a particular task. Cognitive science is highly involved in the area of artificial intelligence and its application to the understanding of mental processes.\n\n==Criticisms==\nIn the early years of cognitive psychology, [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] critics held that the empiricism it pursued was incompatible with the concept of internal mental states. [[Cognitive neuroscience]], however, continues to gather evidence of direct correlations between physiological brain activity and putative mental states, endorsing the basis for cognitive psychology.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Howard |title=Changing Minds |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard Business School Publishing |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=1-4221-0329-3}}</ref>\n\nSome observers have suggested that as cognitive psychology became a movement during the 1970s, the intricacies of the phenomena and processes it examined meant it also began to lose cohesion as a field of study. In ''Psychology: Pythagoras to Present'', for example, John Malone writes: \"Examinations of late twentieth-century textbooks dealing with \"cognitive psychology\", \"human cognition\", \"cognitive science\" and the like quickly reveal that there are many, many varieties of cognitive psychology and very little agreement about exactly what may be its domain.\"&#8201;<ref name=\"Malone\"/>  This misfortune produced competing models that questioned information-processing approaches to cognitive functioning such as [[Naturalistic decision-making|Decision Making]] and [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences|Behavioral Science]].\n\n==Major research areas==\n<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em}}\n<div style=\"display:inline-block\">\n<!-- C -->'''[[Categorization]]'''\n* [[Concept learning|Induction and acquisition]]\n* Judgement and classification\n* Representation and structure\n* [[Similarity (psychology)|Similarity]]\n\n<!-- K -->'''[[Knowledge representation]]'''\n* [[Dual-coding theories]]\n* [[Media psychology]]\n* [[Mental image]]ry\n* [[Numerical cognition]]\n* [[Propositional encoding]]\n\n<!-- L -->'''[[Language]]'''\n* [[Language acquisition]]\n* [[Language processing]]\n* {{hlist|[[Linguistics]]|[[Grammar]]}}\n* {{hlist|[[Phonetics]]|[[Phonology]]}}\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"display:inline-block\">\n<!-- M -->'''[[Memory]]'''\n* [[Aging and memory]]\n* [[Autobiographical memory]]\n* [[Childhood memory]]\n* [[Constructive memory]]\n* [[Emotion and memory]]\n* [[Episodic memory]]\n* [[Eyewitness memory]]\n* [[False memories]]\n* [[Flashbulb memory]]\n* [[List of memory biases]]\n* [[Long-term memory]]\n* [[Semantic memory]]\n* [[Short-term memory]]\n* [[Source-monitoring error]]\n* [[Spaced repetition]]\n* [[Working memory]]\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"display:inline-block\">\n<!-- P -->'''[[Perception]]'''\n* [[Attention]]\n* [[Object recognition]]\n* [[Pattern recognition]]\n* [[Perception]]\n** [[Form perception]]\n* [[Psychophysics]]\n* [[Sense of time|Time sensation]]\n\n<!-- T -->'''[[Thinking]]'''\n* [[Choice]]&nbsp;([[Glasser's choice theory|Glasser's theory]])\n* [[Concept formation]]\n* [[Decision making]]\n* [[Logic]]\n* [[Psychology of reasoning]]\n* [[Problem solving]]\n</div>\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Influential cognitive psychologists==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John R.

This produces a visible atmosphere or [[Coma (cometary)|coma]], and sometimes also a [[Comet tail|tail]]. These phenomena are due to the effects of [[solar radiation]] and the [[solar wind]] acting upon the nucleus of the comet. [[Comet nuclei]] range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one [[astronomical unit]]. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30\u00b0 (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.\n\nComets usually have highly [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] elliptical orbits, and they have a wide range of [[orbital period]]s, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. [[Short-period comet]]s originate in the [[Kuiper belt]] or its associated [[scattered disc]], which lie beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]]. [[Long-period comet]]s are thought to originate in the [[Oort cloud]], a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs]]: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe |publisher=Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers |location=New York |first=Lisa |last=Randall |pages=104\u2013105 |date=2015 |isbn=978-0-06-232847-2}}</ref> Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by [[gravitational perturbation]]s caused by [[List of nearest stars#Future and past|passing stars]] and the [[galactic tide]]. [[Hyperbolic comet]]s may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.\n\nComets are distinguished from [[asteroid]]s by the presence of an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus. This atmosphere has parts termed the coma (the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus) and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from the coma by the Sun's light pressure or outstreaming solar wind plasma). However, [[extinct comets]] that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is the difference between asteroids and comets |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Frequently_asked_questions |work=Rosetta's Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> Asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets, having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer Solar System.<ref>{{cite web |title=What Are Asteroids And Comets |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/#ast |work=Near Earth Object Program FAQ |publisher=NASA |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1150683 |title=Comparison of Comet 81P/Wild 2 Dust with Interplanetary Dust from Comets |date=2008 |last1=Ishii |first1=H.

Once the particles have been ionized, they attain a net positive electrical charge, which in turn gives rise to an \"induced [[magnetosphere]]\" around the comet. The comet and its induced magnetic field form an obstacle to outward flowing solar wind particles. Because the relative orbital speed of the comet and the solar wind is supersonic, a [[bow shock]] is formed upstream of the comet in the flow direction of the solar wind.

By definition long-period comets remain gravitationally bound to the Sun; those comets that are ejected from the Solar System due to close passes by major planets are no longer properly considered as having \"periods\".

Their orbits were never known well enough to predict future appearances or the comets have disintegrated. However, occasionally a \"new\" comet is discovered, and calculation of its orbit shows it to be an old \"lost\" comet. An example is Comet [[11P/Tempel\u2013Swift\u2013LINEAR]], discovered in 1869 but unobservable after 1908 because of perturbations by Jupiter. It was not found again until accidentally rediscovered by [[LINEAR]] in 2001.<ref name=\"kronk\">{{cite web |last=Kronk |first=Gary W. |title=11P/Tempel\u2013Swift\u2013LINEAR |url=http://cometography.com/pcomets/011p.html |work=Gary W.

This process [[Recycling|recycles]] various organic materials otherwise regarded as waste products and produces a [[soil conditioner]] (the ''compost'').\n\nCompost is rich in nutrients. It is used, for example, in [[garden]]s, [[landscaping]], [[horticulture]], [[urban agriculture]] and [[organic farming]]. The compost itself is beneficial for the land in many ways, including as a soil conditioner, a [[fertilizer]], addition of vital [[humus]] or [[humic acids]], and as a natural [[pesticide]] for soil. In [[ecosystems]], compost is useful for erosion control, land and stream reclamation, wetland construction, and as landfill cover (see [[compost uses]]).\n\nAt the simplest level, the process of composting requires making a heap of wet organic matter (also called [[green waste]]), such as leaves, grass, and food scraps, and waiting for the materials to break down into [[humus]] after a period of months. However, composting also can take place as a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured inputs of water, air, and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The [[decomposition]] process is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture when open piles or \"windrows\" are used. [[Earthworm]]s and [[Fungus|fungi]] further break up the material. Bacteria requiring oxygen to function ([[aerobic bacteria]]) and fungi manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat, [[carbon dioxide]], and [[ammonium]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Fundamentals==\n[[File:Composting in the Escuela Barreales.jpg|thumb|Home compost barrel]]\n[[File:Compost pile.JPG|thumb|Materials in a compost pile]]\n[[File:Food-scraps-compost.jpg|thumb|Food scraps compost heap]]\n\nComposting is an aerobic method (meaning that it requires the presence of air) of decomposing organic solid wastes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3BhSAAAAMAAJ&q=Human+waste+can+also+be+added+as+an+input+to+the+composting+process+since+human+waste+is+a+nitrogen-rich+organic+material&dq=Human+waste+can+also+be+added+as+an+input+to+the+composting+process+since+human+waste+is+a+nitrogen-rich+organic+material&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0hs-ly-HUAhXhllQKHQJdDfw4ChDoAQgjMAA|title=Introduction to Environmental Engineering and Science|last=Masters|first=Gilbert M.|date=1997|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780131553842|language=en}}</ref> It can therefore be used to recycle organic material. The process involves decomposition of organic material into a [[humus]]-like material, known as compost, which is a good [[fertilizer]] for plants. Composting requires the following three components: human management, aerobic conditions, development of internal biological heat.\n\nComposting organisms require four equally important ingredients to work effectively:\n*Carbon \u2014 for energy; the microbial [[oxidation]] of carbon produces the heat, if included at suggested levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.extension.illinois.edu/homecompost/science.html |title=Composting for the Homeowner - University of Illinois Extension |publisher=Web.extension.illinois.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref> High carbon materials tend to be brown and dry.\n* Nitrogen \u2014 to grow and reproduce more organisms to oxidize the carbon.

Active management of the pile (e.g. turning) is needed to maintain sufficient supply of oxygen and the right moisture level.

There are many types of microorganisms found in active compost of which the most common are:<ref name=\"cornell\">{{cite web|url=http://compost.css.cornell.edu/microorg.html|title=Composting - Compost Microorganisms|work=[[Cornell University]]|accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n* [[Bacteria]]- The most numerous of all the [[microorganism]]s found in compost.  Depending on the phase of composting, [[mesophile|mesophilic]] or [[thermophile|thermophilic]] bacteria may predominate.\n* [[Actinobacteria]]- Necessary for breaking down paper products such as newspaper, [[Bark (botany)|bark]], etc.\n* [[Fungi]]- [[molds]] and [[yeast]] help break down materials that bacteria cannot, especially [[lignin]] in woody material.\n* [[Protozoa]]- Help consume bacteria, fungi and micro organic particulates.\n* [[Rotifers]]- Rotifers help control populations of bacteria and small protozoans.\n\nIn addition, [[earthworm]]s not only ingest partly composted material, but also continually re-create aeration and drainage tunnels as they move through the compost.\n\n===Phases of composting===\nUnder ideal conditions, composting proceeds through three major phases:<ref name=\"cornell\" />\n\n*An initial, mesophilic phase, in which the decomposition is carried out under moderate temperatures by mesophilic microorganisms.\n*As the temperature rises, a second, thermophilic phase starts, in which the decomposition is carried out by various thermophilic bacteria under high temperatures.\n*As the supply of high-energy compounds dwindles, the temperature starts to decrease, and the mesophiles once again predominate in the maturation phase.\n\n===Slow and rapid composting===\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}\nThere are many proponents of rapid composting that attempt to correct some of the perceived problems associated with traditional, slow composting. Many advocate that compost can be made in 2 to 3 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vric.ucdavis.edu/pdf/compost_rapidcompost.pdf|title=The Rapid Compost Method by Robert Raabe, Professor of Plant Pathology, Berkeley|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> Many such short processes involve a few changes to traditional methods, including smaller, more homogenized pieces in the compost, controlling carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) at 30 to 1 or less, and monitoring the moisture level more carefully. However, none of these parameters differ significantly from the early writings of compost researchers, suggesting that in fact modern composting has not made significant advances over the traditional methods that take a few months to work. For this reason and others, many scientists who deal with carbon transformations are sceptical that there is a \"super-charged\" way to get nature to make compost rapidly. {{citation needed|reason=Very old reference, find a better one|date=May 2015}}\n\nBoth sides may be right to some extent. The bacterial activity in rapid high heat methods breaks down the material to the extent that pathogens and seeds are destroyed, and the original feedstock is unrecognizable. At this stage, the compost can be used to prepare fields or other planting areas.  However, most professionals recommend that the compost be given time to cure before using in a nursery for starting seeds or growing young plants. The curing time allows fungi to continue the decomposition process and eliminating [[phytotoxic]] substances.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Pathogen removal===\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}\nComposting can destroy [[pathogen]]s or unwanted [[seed]]s. Unwanted living plants (or [[weed]]s) can be discouraged by [[Mulch#Mulching (composting) over unwanted plants|covering with mulch/compost]]. The \"[[biopesticide|microbial pesticides]]\" in compost may include [[thermophile]]s and [[mesophile]]s.\n\nThermophilic (high-temperature) composting is well known to destroy many seeds and nearly all types of pathogens (exceptions may include [[prion]]s). The [[Disinfection|sanitizing]] qualities of ([[thermophilic]]) composting are desirable where there is a high likelihood of pathogens, such as with [[manure]].\n\n== Materials that can be composted ==\n\nComposting is a process used for [[resource recovery]]. It can [[recycle]] an unwanted by-product from another process (a [[waste]]) into a useful new product.\n\n=== Organic solid waste (green waste) ===\n[[File:Spontaneous combustion of compost pile.jpg|thumb|A large compost pile that is steaming with the heat generated by [[thermophile|thermophilic]] microorganisms.]]\n\nComposting is a process for converting decomposable organic materials into useful stable products. Therefore, valuable [[landfill]] space can be used for other wastes by composting these materials rather than dumping them on landfills. It may however be difficult to control inert and plastics contamination from [[municipal solid waste]].\n\nCo-composting is a technique that processes organic solid waste together with other input materials such as dewatered [[fecal sludge]] or [[sewage sludge]].<ref name=\"tilley2\" />\n\nIndustrial composting systems are being installed to treat organic solid waste and recycle it rather than landfilling it. It is one example of an [[advanced waste processing systems|advanced waste processing system]]. Mechanical sorting of mixed waste streams combined with [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] digestion or in-vessel composting is called [[mechanical biological treatment]]. It is increasingly being used in developed countries due to regulations controlling the amount of organic matter allowed in landfills. Treating [[biodegradable waste]] before it enters a landfill reduces [[global warming]] from fugitive [[methane]]; untreated waste breaks down anaerobically in a landfill, producing [[landfill gas]] that contains [[atmospheric methane|methane]], a potent [[greenhouse gas]].\n\n===Animal manure and bedding===\nOn many farms, the basic composting ingredients are animal [[manure]] generated on the farm and bedding. Straw and sawdust are common bedding materials. Non-traditional bedding materials are also used, including newspaper and chopped cardboard. The amount of manure composted on a livestock farm is often determined by cleaning schedules, land availability, and weather conditions. Each type of manure has its own physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Cattle and horse manures, when mixed with bedding, possess good qualities for composting. Swine manure, which is very wet and usually not mixed with bedding material, must be mixed with straw or similar raw materials. Poultry manure also must be blended with carbonaceous materials - those low in nitrogen preferred, such as sawdust or straw.<ref>Dougherty, Mark. (1999). Field Guide to On-Farm Composting. Ithaca, New York: Natural Resource, Agriculture, and Engineering Service.</ref>\n\n=== Human excreta and sewage sludge ===\n{{Further|Reuse of excreta}}\n[[Human excreta]] can also be added as an input to the composting process since human excreta is a nitrogen-rich organic material. It can be either composted directly, like in [[composting toilets]], or indirectly (as [[sewage sludge]]), after it has undergone treatment in a [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plant]].\n\n[[Urine]] can be put on compost piles or directly used as fertilizer.<ref>[http://esa.un.org/iys/docs/san_lib_docs/ESR2web%5B1%5D.pdf Stockholm Environment Institute - EcoSanRes - Guidelines on the Use of Urine and Feces in Crop Production]</ref> Adding urine to compost can increase temperatures and therefore increase its ability to destroy pathogens and unwanted seeds. Unlike feces, urine does not attract disease-spreading flies (such as [[Housefly|houseflies]] or [[Calliphoridae|blowflies]]), and it does not contain the most hardy of pathogens, such as [[parasitic worm]] eggs. Urine usually does not smell for long, particularly when it is fresh, diluted, or put on [[sorbent]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n==Uses==\n{{Main|Uses of compost}}\nCompost can be used as an additive to soil, or other matrices such as [[coir]] and [[peat]], as a [[tilth]] improver, supplying humus and nutrients. It provides a rich ''growing medium'', or a porous, absorbent material that holds moisture and soluble minerals, providing the support and [[nutrient]]s in which plants can flourish, although it is rarely used alone, being primarily mixed with [[soil]], [[sand]], grit, bark chips, [[vermiculite]], [[perlite]], or [[clay]] granules to produce [[loam]]. Compost can be tilled directly into the soil or growing medium to boost the level of organic matter and the overall fertility of the soil. Compost that is ready to be used as an additive is dark brown or even black with an earthy smell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/rrr/greenscapes/pubs/asla-soil.pdf|title=Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR|website=US EPA|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, direct seeding into a compost is not recommended due to the speed with which it may dry and the possible presence of [[phytotoxin]]s in immature compost that may inhibit germination,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Morel | first1 = P. | last2 = Guillemain | first2 = G. | year = 2004 | title = Assessment of the possible phytotoxicity of a substrate using an easy and representative biotest | url = | journal = Acta Horticulture | volume = 644 | issue = | pages = 417\u2013423 }}</ref><ref>It\u00e4vaara et al.

The aerated base is just visible through the food scraps and bokashi bran.]]\nBokashi is a method that uses a mix of microorganisms to cover food scraps or wilted plants to decrease smell, reduce the risk of attracting pests and increase the speed of decomposition. Bokashi (\u307c\u304b\u3057) is Japanese for \"shading off\" or \"gradation.\" It derives from the practice of [[Japan]]ese farmers centuries ago of covering food scraps with rich, local soil that contained the microorganisms that would ferment the material.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe technique relies on [[effective microorganism]]s. These essential microbes are typically added to the food scraps using an inoculated bokashi bran.<ref>[http://bokashiliving.com/how-to-bokashi-compost/ \"How to bokashi compost\"], Retrieved 5 November 2017</ref>\n\nNewspaper fermented in a lactobacillus culture can be substituted for bokashi bran for a successful bokashi bucket.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe first stage of bokashi preserves the ingredients in a [[lactic acid]] [[fermentation]].

The advantage of this method is that little working time or effort is required from the composter and it fits in naturally with agricultural practices in temperate climates. Disadvantages (from the modern perspective) are that space is used for a whole year, some nutrients might be leached due to exposure to rainfall, and disease-producing organisms and insects may not be adequately controlled.\n\nComposting was somewhat modernized beginning in the 1920s in Europe as a tool for [[organic farming]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.extension.illinois.edu/homecompost/history.cfm|title=History of Composting|publisher=illinois.edu|accessdate=11 July 2016}}</ref> The first industrial station for the transformation of urban organic materials into compost was set up in [[Wels]], Austria in the year 1921.<ref>Welser Anzeiger vom 05.

A practitioner of the art is called a '''capoeirista''' ({{IPA-pt|kapuej\u02c8\u027eist\u0250}}). \n\nOn 26 November 2014, capoeira was granted a special protected status as \"intangible cultural heritage\" by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-30219941|title=BBC News - Brazil's capoeira gains UN cultural heritage status|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nCapoeira's history begins with the beginning of African [[slavery in Brazil]]. Since the 16th century, Portuguese colonists began exporting slaves to their colonies, coming mainly from [[Angola]]. Brazil, with its vast territory, received most of the slaves, almost 40% of all slaves sent through the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The early history of capoeira is recorded by historians such as Dr desch-Obi. Originally, the ancestor tradition originated from Angola and was called N'golo/Engolo; a type of ritual dance that used several elements of kicking, headbutting, slap boxing, walking on one's feet, deception, evasion etc. The purpose was also religious as it both provided a link to the afterlife (which was the opposite of the living world) and enabled a person to channel their ancestors into their dance. For example, during the dance, a person might become possessed by an ancestor in the past who was talented at N'golo. This could be applied to a Martial setting in both combat and warfare which was called N'singa/ensinga; the difference to N'golo being that it included weapon use and grappling. During the Atlantic Slave trade, this tradition transferred around the Americas; Brazil (Capoeira), the Caribbean (Damnye) and the United States (knocking and kicking). A large amount of Angolans were sent to Madagascar during the slave trade and it still survives today as Moringue/ Moring.\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:CapoeiraEarle.JPG|thumb|Painting of fighting in Brazil c. 1824 by [[Augustus Earle]]]]\nIn the 16th century, [[Portugal]] had claimed one of the largest territories of the [[colonial empires]], but lacked people to colonize it, especially workers. In the [[Brazil]]ian colony, the Portuguese, like many European colonists, chose to use [[slavery]] to build their economy.\n\nIn its first century, the main economic activity in the colony was the production and processing of [[sugar cane]]. Portuguese colonists created large sugarcane farms called \"[[engenho]]s\", literally \"engines\" (of economic activity), which depended on the labor of slaves. Slaves, living in inhumane conditions, were forced to work hard and often suffered physical punishment for small misbehaviors.<ref name=\"inicio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culturabrasil.pro.br/brasilcolonia.htm |title=O Brasil no quadro do Antigo Sistema Colonial |publisher=Culturabrasil.pro.br |accessdate=2013-11-18 |language=pt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518074617/https://www.culturabrasil.pro.br/brasilcolonia.htm |archivedate=2013-05-18 |df= }}</ref>\n\nAlthough slaves often outnumbered colonists, rebellions were rare because of the lack of weapons, harsh colonial law, disagreement between slaves coming from different African cultures, and lack of knowledge about the new land and its surroundings.\n\nCapoeira originated within as a product of the Angolan tradition of \"[[Engolo]]\" but became applied as a method of survival that was known to slaves. It was a tool with which an escaped slave, completely unequipped, could survive in the hostile, unknown land and face the hunt of the ''capit\u00e3es-do-mato'', the armed and mounted colonial agents who were charged with finding and capturing escapees.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAs Brazil became more urbanised in the 17th and 18th Century, the nature of Capoeira stayed largely the same, however compared to the United States, the nature of Slavery differed. Since many slaves worked in the cities and were most of the time outside the master's supervision, they would be tasked with finding work to do (in the form of any manual labour) and in return they would pay the master any money they made. It is here where Capoeira was common as it created opportunities for slaves to practice during and after work. Though tolerated until the 1800's, this quickly became criminalised after due to its association with being African, as well as a threat to the current ruling regime. {{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Quilombos===\n[[File:Ant\u00f4nio Parreiras - Zumbi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zumbi]] (1927) by [[Ant\u00f4nio Parreiras]]]]\nSoon several groups of escaping slaves would gather and establish [[quilombo]]s, settlements in far and hard to reach places.

Reasons included growing quilombo militia raids in plantations that still used slaves, the refusal of the Brazilian army to deal with escapees and the growth of Brazilian abolitionist movements. The Empire tried to soften the problems with laws to restrict slavery, but finally Brazil would recognize the end of the institution on May 13, 1888, with a law called ''Lei \u00c1urea'' (Golden Law), sanctioned by imperial parliament and signed by [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|Princess Isabel]].\n\nHowever, free former slaves now felt abandoned. Most of them had nowhere to live, no jobs and were despised by Brazilian society, which usually viewed them as lazy workers.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180223051740/http://www.brasil.gov.br/sobre/historia/abolicao] </ref><ref name=\"cardoso\">{{cite book |first=Fernando Henrique |last=Cardoso |title=Capitalismo e Escravid\u00e3o no Brasil Meridional |publisher=Editora Civiliza\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira |year=1962 |isbn=85-200-0635-3 |language=pt |url=}}</ref> Also, new immigration from Europe and Asia left most former slaves with no employment.<ref name=\"cardoso\" /><ref name=\"favela\">{{cite book |first=Andrelino |last=Campos |title=Do Quilombo \u00e0 Favela: A Produ\u00e7\u00e3o do \"Espa\u00e7o Criminalizado\" no Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Editora Bertrand Brasil |year=2005 |isbn=85-286-1159-0 |language=pt |url=}}</ref>\n\nSoon capoeiristas started to use their skills in unconventional ways. Criminals and war lords used capoeiristas as body guards and hitmen. Groups of capoeiristas, known as ''maltas'', raided Rio de Janeiro. The two main ''maltas'' were the ''Nagoas'', composed of [[African slaves|africans]], and the ''Guaiamuns'', composed of [[Black Brazilian|native blacks]], [[Mulatto|people of mixed race,]] poor whites, and [[Portuguese Brazilians|Portuguese immigrants]]. The ''Nagoas'' and ''Guaiamuns'' were  \nused respectively, as a hitforce by the [[Conservative Party (Brazil)|Conservative]] and [[Liberal Party (Brazil)|Liberal party]].<ref>http://www.vermelho.org.br/coluna.php?id_coluna_texto=5904</ref> In 1890, the recently proclaimed Brazilian Republic decreed the prohibition of capoeira in the whole country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pt.wikisource.org/wiki/C%C3%B3digo_penal_brasileiro_-_proibi%C3%A7%C3%A3o_da_capoeira_-_1890 |title=C\u00f3digo penal brasileiro - proibi\u00e7\u00e3o da capoeira - 1890 - Wikisource |language= pt |publisher=Pt.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18}}</ref> Social conditions were chaotic in the Brazilian capital, and police reports identified capoeira as an advantage in fighting.<ref name=\"favela\" />\n\nAfter the prohibition, any citizen caught practicing capoeira, in a fight or for any other reason, would be arrested, tortured and often mutilated by the police.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Cultural practices, such as the ''roda de capoeira'', were conducted in remote places with sentries to warn of approaching police.\n\n===Luta Regional Baiana===\nBy the 1920s, capoeira repression had declined. [[Manuel dos Reis Machado|Mestre Bimba]] from [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], a strong fighter in both legal and illegal fights, met with his future student, Cisnando Lima. Both thought capoeira was losing its martial roots due to the use of its playful side to entertain tourists. Bimba began developing the first systematic training method for capoeira, and in 1932 founded the first capoeira school.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theculturetrip.com/south-america/brazil/articles/disguised-in-dance-the-secret-history-of-capoeira/|title=Disguised In Dance: The Secret History Of Capoeira|last=Kingsford-Smith|first=Andrew|work=Culture Trip|access-date=2017-10-03}}</ref> Advised by Cisnando, Bimba called his style ''Luta Regional Baiana'' (\"regional fight from [[Bahia]]\"), because capoeira was still illegal in name.<ref name=\"bimba\">{{cite book |first=Muniz |last=Sodre |title=Mestre Bimba: Corpo de Mandiga |publisher=Livraria da Travessa |year=2002 |isbn=85-86218-13-8 |language=pt |url=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1937, Bimba founded the school ''Centro de Cultura F\u00edsica e Luta Regional'', with permission from Salvador's Secretary of Education (''Secretaria da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o, Sa\u00fade e Assist\u00eancia de Salvador''). His work was very well received, and he taught capoeira to the cultural elite of the city.<ref name=\"bimba\" /> By 1940, capoeira finally lost its criminal connotation and was legalized.\n\nBimba's Regional style overshadowed traditional capoeiristas, who were still distrusted by society. This began to change in 1941 with the founding of ''Centro Esportivo de Capoeira Angola'' (CECA) by [[Vicente Ferreira Pastinha]]. Located in the Salvador neighborhood of [[Pelourinho]], this school attracted many traditional capoeiristas. With CECA's prominence, the traditional style came to be called ''Capoeira Angola''. The name derived from ''brincar de angola'' (\"playing Angola\"), a term used in the 19th century in some places. But it was also adopted by other masters, including some who did not follow Pastinha's style.<ref name=\"noronha\">{{cite web|url=http://portalcapoeira.com/Publicacoes-e-Artigos/o-abc-da-capoeira-angola-os-manuscritos-de-mestre-noronha |title=O ABC da Capoeira Angola - Os Manuscritos de Mestre Noronha &#124; Publica\u0102\u00a7\u0102\u013ees e Artigos - Capoeira |publisher=Portalcapoeira.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720173234/https://portalcapoeira.com/Publicacoes-e-Artigos/o-abc-da-capoeira-angola-os-manuscritos-de-mestre-noronha |archivedate=2013-07-20 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThough there was some degree of tolerance, Capoeira from the beginning of the 20th Century began to become a more sanitised form of dance with less Martial application. This was due to regions mentioned above but also due to the military coup in the 1930's to 1945, as well as the Military regime from 1964-85. In both cases, Capoeira was still seen by authorities as a dangerous pastime which was punishable; however during the Military Regime it was tolerated as an activity for University students (which by this time is the form of Capoeira that is recognised today). \n\n===Today===\n[[File:Capoeira-Yoyogipark-2014.ogv|thumb|(video) Practicing capoeira in [[Yoyogi Park]], [[Japan]]]]\n[[File:Capoeira at Helsinki Samba Carnaval 2015.jpg|thumb|right|A capoeira demonstration at the [[Helsinki Samba Carnaval]] in Finland]]\nCapoeira nowadays is not only a martial art, but an active exporter of [[Brazilian culture]] all over the world. In the 1970s, capoeira ''mestres'' began to emigrate and teach it in other countries. Present in many countries on every continent, every year capoeira attracts thousands of foreign students and tourists to Brazil. Foreign capoeiristas work hard to learn Portuguese to better understand and become part of the art. Renowned capoeira ''mestres'' often teach abroad and establish their own schools. Capoeira presentations, normally theatrical, acrobatic and with little martiality, are common sights around the world.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe martial art aspect is still present and still disguised, leading many non-practitioners to ignore its presence. Trickery is ever present and expert capoeiristas can even disguise an attack as a friendly gesture.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nCapoeira is officially considered an [[Intangible culture|intangible cultural heritage]] of Brazil by UNESCO.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-30219941|title=Brazil's capoeira gets Unesco status|date=2014-11-26|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Techniques==\n{{See also|List of capoeira techniques}}\nCapoeira is a fast and versatile [[martial art]] that is historically focused on fighting outnumbered or in technological disadvantage. The style emphasizes using the lower body to kick, sweep and take down and the upper body to assist those movements and occasionally attack as well. It features a series of complex positions and body postures that are meant to get chained in an uninterrupted flow, in order to strike, dodge and move without breaking motion, conferring the style with a characteristic unpredictability and versatility.\n\n[[File:Ginga de dos.gif|thumb|Simple animation depicting part of the ''ginga'']]\nThe ''[[Ginga (capoeira)|ginga]]'' (literally: rocking back and forth; to swing) is the fundamental movement in capoeira, important both for attack and defense purposes. It has two main objectives. One is to keep the capoeirista in a state of constant motion, preventing him or her from being a still and easy target. The other, using also fakes and feints, is to mislead, fool, trick the opponent, leaving them open for an attack or a counter-attack.\n\nThe attacks in the capoeira should be done when opportunity arises, and though they can be preceded by feints or pokes, they must be precise and decisive, like a direct kick to the head, face or a vital body part, or a strong takedown. Most capoeira attacks are made with the legs, like direct or swirling kicks, rasteiras (leg sweeps), [[List of capoeira techniques#Tesoura|tesouras]] or knee strikes. Elbow strikes, punches and other forms of takedowns complete the main list. The head strike is a very important counter-attack move.\n\nThe defense is based on the principle of non-resistance, meaning avoiding an attack using evasive moves instead of blocking it. Avoids are called ''esquivas'', which depend on the direction of the attack and intention of the defender, and can be done standing or with a hand leaning on the floor. A block should only be made when the ''esquiva'' is completely non-viable. This fighting strategy allows quick and unpredictable counterattacks, the ability to focus on more than one adversary and to face empty-handed an armed adversary.\n\n[[File:Auangole.gif|thumb|left|A capoeira movement (A\u00fa Fechado) (click for animation)]]\nA series of rolls and acrobatics (like the [[Cartwheel (Capoeira)|cartwheels]] called [[a\u00fa]] or the transitional position called negativa) allows the capoeirista to quickly overcome a takedown or a loss of balance, and to position themselves around the aggressor in order to lay up for an attack. It is this combination of attacks, defense and mobility that gives capoeira its perceived \"fluidity\" and choreography-like style.\n\n==Weapons==\nThrough most of its history in Brazil, capoeira commonly featured weapons and weapon training, given its [[street fighting]] nature. Capoeiristas usually carried knives and bladed weapons with them, and the [[berimbau]] could be used to conceal those inside, or even to turn itself into a weapon by attaching a blade to its tip.<ref name=Luan>Gerard Taylor, ''Capoeira: The Jogo de Angola from Luanda to Cyberspace, Volumen 2''</ref> The knife or razor was used in street ''rodas'' and/or against openly hostile opponents, and would be drawn quickly to stab or slash. Other hiding places for the weapons included [[hat]]s and [[umbrella]]s.<ref name=Luan/>\n\nMestre Bimba included in his teachings a ''curso de especializa\u00e7\u00e3o'' or specialization course in which the pupils would be taught defenses against knives and guns, as well as the usage of knife, straight razor, scythe, club, ''chanfolo'' (double-edged dagger), ''fac\u00e3o'' ([[machete]]) and ''tira-teima'' ([[cane sword]]).<ref name=Roots/> Upon graduating, pupils were given a red scarf which marked their specialty. This course was scarcely used, and was ceased after some time. A more common custom practised by Bimba and his students, however, was furtively handing a weapon to a player before a ''jogo'' in order for them to use it to attack their opponent on Bimba's sign, with the other player's duty being to disarm them.<ref name=Roots/>\n\nThis weapon training is almost completely absent in current capoeira teachings, but some groups still practice the use of razors for ceremonial usage in the ''rodas''.\n\n==As a game==\n[[File:Capoeira Dance.jpg|thumb|Capoeiristas outside]]\nPlaying capoeira is both a game and a method of practicing the application of capoeira movements in simulated combat. It can be played anywhere, but it's usually done in a ''roda''. During the game most capoeira moves are used, but capoeiristas usually avoid using punches or elbow strikes unless it's a very aggressive game.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe game usually does not focus on knocking down or destroying the opponent, rather it emphasizes skill. Capoeiristas often prefer to rely on a takedown like a ''rasteira'', then allowing the opponent to recover and get back into the game. It is also very common to slow down a kick inches before hitting the target, so a capoeirista can enforce superiority without the need of injuring the opponent. If an opponent clearly cannot dodge an attack, there is no reason to complete it. However, between two high-skilled capoeiristas, the game can get much more aggressive and dangerous. Capoeiristas tend to avoid showing this kind of game in presentations or to the general public.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Roda===\n[[File:Roda de capoeira1.jpg|thumb|Capoeiristas in a ''roda'' ([[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]])]]\nThe ''[[Roda (formation)|roda]]'' (pronounced {{IPA-pt|\u02c8\u0281od\u0250|}}) is a circle formed by capoeiristas and capoeira musical instruments, where every participant sings the typical songs and claps their hands following the music. Two ''capoeiristas'' enter the ''roda'' and play the game according to the style required by the musical rhythm. The game finishes when one of the musicians holding a [[berimbau]] determine it, when one of the ''capoeiristas'' decide to leave or call the end of the game or when another capoeirista interrupts the game to start playing, either with one of the current players or with another ''capoeirista''.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn a ''roda'' every cultural aspect of capoeira is present, not only the martial side. Aerial acrobatics are common in a presentation ''roda'', while not seen as often in a more serious one. Takedowns, on the other hand, are common in a serious ''roda'' but rarely seen in presentations.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n====Batizado====\nThe batizado (lit. baptism) is a ceremonial ''roda'' where new students will get recognized as capoeiristas and earn their first graduation. Also more experienced students may go up in rank, depending on their skills and capoeira culture. In Mestre Bimba's Capoeira Regional, batizado was the first time a new student would play capoeira following the sound of the berimbau.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nStudents enter the ''roda'' against a high-ranked capoeirista (such as a teacher or master) and normally the game ends with the student being taken down. In some cases the more experienced capoeirista can judge the takedown unnecessary. Following the batizado the new graduation, generally in the form of a cord, is given.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n====Apelido====\nTraditionally, the batizado is the moment when the new practitioner gets or formalizes his or her ''apelido'' (nickname). This tradition was created back when capoeira practice was considered a crime. To avoid having problems with the law, capoeiristas would present themselves in the capoeira community only by their nicknames. So if a capoeirista was captured by the police, he would be unable to identify his fellow capoeiristas, even when tortured.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n''Apelidos'' can come from many different things, such as a physical characteristic (like being tall or big), a habit (like smiling or drinking too much), place of birth, a particular skill, an animal, or trivial things.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nEven though apelidos or these nicknames are not necessary any more, the tradition is still very alive not only in capoeira but in many aspects of Brazilian culture.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Chamada===\n''Chamada'' means 'call' and can happen at any time during a ''roda'' where the rhythm ''angola'' is being played. It happens when one player, usually the more advanced one, calls his or her opponent to a dance-like ritual. The opponent then approaches the caller and meets him or her to walk side by side. After it both resume normal play.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bullshido.org/Capoeira|title=Capoeira - The Martial Arts Encyclopedia|website=www.bullshido.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410072008/http://www.bullshido.org/Capoeira|archive-date=2018-04-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>\n\nWhile it may seem like a break time or a dance, the ''chamada'' is actually both a trap and a test, as the caller is just watching to see if the opponent will let his guard down so she can perform a takedown or a strike. It is a critical situation, because both players are vulnerable due to the close proximity and potential for a surprise attack. It's also a tool for experienced practitioners and masters of the art to test a student's awareness and demonstrate when the student left herself open to attack.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe use of the ''chamada'' can result in a highly developed sense of awareness and helps practitioners learn the subtleties of anticipating another person's hidden intentions. The ''chamada'' can be very simple, consisting solely of the basic elements, or the ritual can be quite elaborate including a competitive dialogue of trickery, or even theatric embellishments.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Volta ao mundo===\n'''Volta ao mundo''' means ''around the world''.\n\nThe ''volta ao mundo'' takes place after an exchange of movements has reached a conclusion, or after there has been a disruption in the harmony of the game. In either of these situations, one player will begin walking around the perimeter of the circle counter-clockwise, and the other player will join the ''volta ao mundo'' in the opposite part of the roda, before returning to the normal game.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Malandragem and mandinga===\n''[[Malandragem]]'' is a word that comes from ''malandro'', which means a person who possesses cunning as well as ''mal\u00edcia'' (malice). This, however, is misleading as the meaning of ''malicia'' in capoeira is the capacity to understand someone's intentions. In Brazil, men who used street smarts to make a living were called ''malandros''. Later the meaning expanded, indicating a person who is a quick thinker in finding a solution for a problem.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn capoeira, ''malandragem'' is the ability to quickly understand an opponent's aggressive intentions, and during a fight or a game, fool, trick and deceive him.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nSimilarly capoeiristas use the concept of ''mandinga''. Mandinga can be translated \"magic\" or \"spell\", but in capoeira a ''mandingueiro'' is a clever fighter, able to trick the opponent. Mandinga is a tricky and strategic quality of the game, and even a certain esthetic, where the game is expressive and at times theatrical, particularly in the Angola style. The roots of the term ''mandingueiro'' would be a person who had the magic ability to avoid harm due to protection from the [[Orisha|Orix\u00e1s]].<ref>\"O Fio Da Navalha\", ESPN Brasil documentary, 2007</ref>\n\nAlternately Mandinga is a way of saying Mandinka (as in the Mandinka Nation) who are known as \"musical hunters\".  Which directly ties into the term \"vadia\u00e7\u00e3o\". Vadia\u00e7\u00e3o is the musical wanderer (with flute in hand), traveler, vagabond.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Music==\n{{Main article|Capoeira music}}\nMusic is integral to capoeira. It sets the tempo and style of game that is to be played within the ''roda''. Typically the music is formed by [[Musical instruments|instruments]] and [[song|singing]]. Rhythms ([[Capoeira toques|toques]]), controlled by a typical instrument called [[berimbau]], differ from very slow to very fast, depending on the style of the ''roda''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.capoeirabrasil.com/the-history-of-capoeira/|title=The History of Capoeira|last=|first=|date=|website=Capoeira Brasil|accessdate=7 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Instruments===\n[[File:Capoeira-three-berimbau-one-pandeiro.jpg|thumb|A capoeira bateria showing three [[berimbau]]s a reco- reco and a [[pandeiro]]]]\nCapoeira instruments are disposed in a row called [[bateria]]. It is traditionally formed by three [[berimbau]]s, two [[pandeiro]]s, three [[atabaque]]s, one [[agog\u00f4]] and one [[ganz\u00e1]], but this format may vary depending on the capoeira group's traditions or the ''roda'' style.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe berimbau is the leading instrument, determining the tempo and style of the music and game played. Two low pitch berimbaus (called ''berra-boi'' and ''m\u00e9dio'') form the base and a high pitch berimbau (called ''viola'') makes variations and improvisations. The other instruments must follow the berimbau's rhythm, free to vary and improvise a little, depending upon the capoeira group's musical style.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAs the capoeiristas change their playing style significantly following the [[capoeira toques|toque]] of the berimbau, which sets the game's speed, style and aggressiveness, it is truly the music that drives a capoeira game.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n=== Songs ===\nMany of the songs are sung in a [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] format while others are in the form of a narrative. Capoeiristas sing about a wide variety of subjects. Some songs are about history or stories of famous capoeiristas. Other songs attempt to inspire players to play better. Some songs are about what is going on within the roda. Sometimes the songs are about life or love lost. Others have lighthearted and playful lyrics.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThere are four basic kinds of songs in capoeira, the ''Lada\u00ednha'', ''Chula'', ''Corrido'' and ''Quadra''. The ''Lada\u00ednha'' is a narrative solo sung only at the beginning of a roda, often by a ''mestre'' (master) or most respected capoeirista present. The solo is followed by a ''louva\u00e7\u00e3o'', a call and response pattern that usually thanks God and one's master, among other things. Each call is usually repeated word-for-word by the responders. The '''Chula''' is a song where the singer part is much bigger than the chorus response, usually eight singer verses for one chorus response, but the proportion may vary. The '''Corrido''' is a song where the singer part and the chorus response are equal, normally two verses by two responses. Finally, the ''Quadra'' is a song where the same verse is repeated four times, either three singer verses followed by one chorus response, or one verse and one response.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nCapoeira songs can talk about virtually anything, being it about a historical fact, a famous capoeirista, trivial life facts, hidden messages for players, anything. Improvisation is very important also, while singing a song the main singer can change the music's lyrics, telling something that's happening in or outside the roda.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n== Styles ==\n{{unreferencedsection|date=March 2018}}\nDetermining styles in capoeira is difficult, since there was never a unity in the original capoeira, or a teaching method before the decade of 1920. However, a division between two styles and a sub-style is widely accepted.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n=== Capoeira Angola ===\n[[:pt:Capoeira de Angola|Capoeira de Angola]] refers to every capoeira that keeps the traditions held before the creation of the Regional style.\n\nExisting in many parts of Brazil since colonial times, most notably in the cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and [[Recife]], it's impossible to tell where and when Capoeira Angola began taking its present form. The name ''Angola'' starts as early as the beginning of slavery in Brazil, when Africans, taken to [[Luanda]] to be shipped to the Americas, were called in Brazil \"black people from Angola\", regardless of their nationality. In some places of Brazil people would refer to capoeira as \"playing Angola\" and, according to Mestre Noronha, the capoeira school ''Centro de Capoeira Angola Concei\u00e7\u00e3o da Praia'', created in Bahia, already used the name ''Capoeira Angola'' illegally in the beginning of the 1920 decade.<ref name=\"noronha\" />\n\nThe name ''Angola'' was finally immortalized by [[Pastinha|Mestre Pastinha]] at February 23, 1941, when he opened the ''Centro Esportivo de capoeira Angola'' (CECA). Pastinha preferred the ludic aspects of the game rather than the martial side, and was much respected by recognized capoeira masters. Soon many other masters would adopt the name ''Angola'', even those who would not follow Pastinha's style.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe ideal of ''Capoeira Angola'' is to maintain capoeira as close to its roots as possible. Characterized by being strategic, with sneaking movements executed standing or near the floor depending on the situation to face, it values the traditions of ''mal\u00edcia'', ''malandragem'' and unpredictability of the original capoeira.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nTypical music ''bateria'' formation in a ''roda'' of ''Capoeira Angola'' is three ''berimbaus'', two ''pandeiros'', one ''atabaque'', one ''agog\u00f4'' and one ''ganzu\u00e1''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://capoeira-connection.com/capoeira/2011/10/what-musical-instruments-are-used-in-capoeira/|title=What musical instruments are used in capoeira? {{!}} Capoeira Connection|website=capoeira-connection.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Capoeira Regional ===\nCapoeira Regional began to take form in the 1920 decade, when [[Mestre Bimba]] met his future student, Jos\u00e9 Cisnando Lima. Both believed that capoeira was losing its martial side and concluded there was a need to restructure it. Bimba created his ''sequ\u00eancias de ensino'' (teaching combinations) and created capoeira's first teaching method. Advised by Cisnando, Bimba decided to call his style ''Luta Regional Baiana'', as capoeira was still illegal at that time.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe base of Capoeira Regional is the original capoeira without many of the aspects that were impractical in a real fight, with less subterfuge and more objectivity. Training was mainly focused on attack, dodging and counter-attack, giving high importance to precision and discipline. Bimba also added a few moves from other arts, notably the ''batuque'', an old street fight game practiced by his father. Use of jumps or aerial acrobacies was kept to a minimum, since one of its foundations was always keeping at least one hand or foot firmly attached to the ground. Mestre Bimba often said, \"''o ch\u00e3o \u00e9 amigo do capoeirista''\" (the floor is a friend to the capoeirista).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n''Capoeira Regional'' also introduced the first ranking method in capoeira. ''Regional'' had three levels: ''calouro'' (freshman), ''formado'' (graduated) and ''formado especializado'' (specialist). When a student completed a course, a special celebration ceremony was had resulting with a silk scarf being tied around the capoeirista's neck.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe traditions of ''roda'' and capoeira game were kept, being used to put into use what was learned during training. The disposition of musical instruments, however, was changed, being made by a single berimbau and two pandeiros.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe ''Luta Regional Baiana'' soon became popular, finally changing capoeira's bad image. Mestre Bimba made many presentations of his new style, but the best known was the one made at 1953 to Brazilian president [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], where the president would say: \"''A Capoeira \u00e9 o \u00fanico esporte verdadeiramente nacional''\" (Capoeira is the only truly national sport).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n=== Capoeira Contempor\u00e2nea ===\nIn the 1970s a mixed style began to take form, with practitioners taking the aspects they considered more important from both Regional and Angola. Notably more acrobatic, this sub-style is seen by some as the natural evolution of capoeira, by others as adulteration or even misinterpretation of capoeira.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nNowadays the label Contempor\u00e2nea applies to any capoeira group who don't follow Regional or Angola styles, even the ones who mix capoeira with other martial arts. Some notable groups whose style cannot be described as either Angola or Regional but rather \"a style of their own\", include Senzala de Santos, Cordao de Ouro and Abada. In the case of Cordao de Ouro, the style may be described as \"Miudinho\", a low and fast-paced game, while in Senzala de Santos the style may described simply as \"Senzala de Santos\", an elegant, playful combination of Angola and Regional. Capoeira Abada may be described as a more aggressive, less dance-influenced style of Capoeira.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n== Ranks ==\n{{unreferencedsection|date=March 2018}}\nBecause of its origin, capoeira never had unity or a general agreement. Ranking or graduating system follows the same path, as there never existed a ranking system accepted by most of the masters. That means graduation style varies depending on the group's traditions.\n\nThe most common modern system uses colored ropes, called ''corda'' or ''cord\u00e3o'', tied around the waist. Some masters use different systems, or even no system at all.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nThere are many entities (leagues, federations and association) that have tried to unify the graduation system. The most usual{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} is the system of the ''Confedera\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Capoeira'' (Brazilian Capoeira Confederation), which adopts ropes using the colors of the [[Brazilian flag]], green, yellow, blue and white.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nEven though it's widely used with many small variations, many big and influential groups still use different systems, in example, Porto da Barra Group that uses belts that tell the Brazilian slavery history. Even the ''Confedera\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Capoeira'' is not widely accepted as the capoeira's main representative.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nIn a substantial amount of groups (mainly of the Angola school) there is no visible ranking system. There can still be several ranks: student, treinel, professor, contra-mestre and mestre, but often no cordas (belts).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n== Related activities ==\nEven though those activities are strongly associated with capoeira, they have different meanings and origins.\n\n=== Samba de roda ===\n{{Main article|Samba de roda}}\n\nPerformed by many capoeira groups, [[samba de roda]] is a traditional Afro-Brazilian dance and musical form that has been associated with capoeira for many decades. The orchestra is composed by ''pandeiro'', ''atabaque'', ''berimbau-viola'' (high pitch berimbau), [[chocalho]], accompanied by singing and clapping. ''Samba de roda'' is considered one of the primitive forms of modern Samba.\n\n=== Maculel\u00ea ===\n{{Main article|Maculel\u00ea (dance)}}\nOriginally the ''Maculel\u00ea'' is believed to have been an [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous]] armed fighting style, using two sticks or a machete. Nowadays it's a folkloric dance practiced with heavy afro-Brazilian percussion. Many capoeira groups include ''Maculel\u00ea'' in their presentations.\n\n=== Puxada de rede ===\n{{Main article|Puxada de rede}}\n''Puxada de Rede'' is a Brazilian [[Brazilian mythology|folkloric]] theatrical play, seen in many capoeira performances. It is based on a traditional Brazilian legend involving the loss of a fisherman in a seafaring accident.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Main article|Capoeira in popular culture}}\n\n==Derivatives and influences==\n{{unreferencedsection|date=March 2018}}\nCapoeira is cited as an influence on other martial arts and several forms of dance, including a [[History of hip-hop dance#Capoeira debate|debated status as a forerunner of breaking]]. Many techniques from capoeira are also present in Tricking. In the UK, capoeira has been cited as a key influence in the development of the [[Hybrid martial arts|hybrid martial art]] [[Sanjuro (Martial Arts)|Sanjuro]].\n\n==Sports development==\n{{unreferencedsection|date=March 2018}}\nCapoeira is currently being used as a tool in sports development (the use of sport to create positive social change) to promote psychosocial wellbeing in various youth projects around the world. Capoeira4Refugees is a UK-based NGO working with youth in conflict zones in the Middle East. Capoeira for Peace is a project based in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Nukanti Foundation works with street children in Colombia.\n\n==MMA==\n{{unreferencedsection|date=March 2018}}\nMany Brazilian [[mixed martial arts]] fighters have a capoeira background, either training often or having tried it before.

This has the effect of stimulating growth of [[plankton]].  Iron is an important nutrient for [[phytoplankton]], usually made available via upwelling along the [[continental shelves]], inflows from rivers and streams, as well as deposition of dust suspended in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Natural sources of ocean iron have been declining in recent decades, contributing to an overall decline in ocean productivity (NASA, 2003).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  Yet in the presence of iron nutrients plankton populations quickly grow, or 'bloom', expanding the base of [[biomass]] productivity throughout the region and removing significant quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere via [[photosynthesis]].  A test in 2002 in the [[Southern Ocean]] around [[Antarctica]] suggests that between 10,000 and 100,000 carbon atoms are sunk for each iron atom added to the water.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  More recent work in Germany (2005) suggests that any biomass carbon in the oceans, whether exported to depth or recycled in the [[euphotic zone]], represents long-term storage of carbon.  This means that application of iron nutrients in select parts of the oceans, at appropriate scales, could have the combined effect of restoring ocean productivity while at the same time mitigating the effects of human caused emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nBecause the effect of periodic small scale phytoplankton blooms on ocean ecosystems is unclear, more studies would be helpful.  Phytoplankton have a complex effect on cloud formation via the release of substances such as [[dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS) that are converted to sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, providing [[cloud condensation nuclei]], or CCN.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Roelofs, G.|year=2008|title= A GCM study of organic matter in marine aerosol and its potential contribution to cloud drop activation|journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics|volume= 8|pages=709\u2013719|doi=10.5194/acp-8-709-2008|hdl=2066/34516}}</ref> But the effect of small scale plankton blooms on overall DMS production is unknown.\n\nOther nutrients such as nitrates, phosphates, and silica as well as iron may cause ocean fertilization.

Thereafter it can be passively stored ''or'' remain productively utilized over time in a variety of ways.\n\nFor example, upon harvesting, wood (as a carbon-rich material) can be immediately burned or otherwise serve as a fuel, returning its carbon to the atmosphere, ''or'' it can be incorporated into construction or a range of other durable products, thus sequestering its carbon over years or even centuries.\n\nIndeed, a very carefully designed and durable, energy-efficient and energy-capturing building has the potential to sequester (in its carbon-rich construction materials), as much as or more carbon than was released by the acquisition and incorporation of all its materials and than will be released by building-function \"energy-imports\" during the structure's (potentially multi-century) existence.  Such a structure might be termed \"carbon neutral\" or even \"carbon negative\". Building construction and operation (electricity usage, heating, etc.) are estimated to contribute nearly ''half'' of the annual human-caused carbon additions to the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web  | title=Climate Change, Global Warming, and the Built Environment \u2013 Architecture 2030 |url=http://www.architecture2030.org |accessdate=23 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Natural-gas]] purification plants often already have to remove carbon dioxide, either to avoid [[dry ice]] clogging gas tankers or to prevent carbon-dioxide concentrations exceeding the 3% maximum permitted on the natural-gas distribution grid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://naturalgas.org/naturalgas/processing-ng/|title=\u00bb Processing Natural Gas NaturalGas.org|website=naturalgas.org|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref>\n\nBeyond this, one of the most likely early applications of carbon capture is the capture of carbon dioxide from [[flue gas]]es at [[power station]]s (in the case of coal, this [[coal pollution mitigation]] is sometimes known as \"clean coal\"). A typical new 1000 MW [[coal-fired power station]] produces around 6 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. Adding carbon capture to existing plants can add significantly to the costs of energy production; scrubbing costs aside, a 1000 MW coal plant will require the storage of about {{convert|50|Moilbbl|m3}} of carbon dioxide a year. However, scrubbing is relatively affordable when added to new plants based on [[coal gasification]] technology, where it is estimated to raise energy costs for households in the United States using only coal-fired electricity sources from 10 cents per kW\u00b7h to 12 cents.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Can We Bury Global Warming? |first=Robert H. |last=Socolow | journal=[[Scientific American]] |date=July 2005 | pages=42}}</ref>\n\n=== Carbon capture ===\n{{Main|Carbon capture and storage}}\n\nCurrently, capture of carbon dioxide is performed on a large scale by absorption of carbon dioxide onto various [[Amine gas treating|amine-based solvents]]. Other techniques are currently being investigated, such as [[pressure swing adsorption]], [[temperature swing adsorption]], [[membrane gas separation|gas separation membranes]], [[Distillation#Industrial distillation|cryogenics]] and [[Flue gas|flue capture]].\n\nIn coal-fired power stations, the main alternatives to retrofitting amine-based absorbers to existing power stations are two new technologies: [[Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle|coal gasification combined-cycle]] and [[oxy-fuel combustion]]. Gasification first produces a \"[[syngas]]\" primarily of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], which is burned, with carbon dioxide filtered from the flue gas. Oxy-fuel combustion burns the coal in [[oxygen]] instead of [[Air#Composition|air]], producing only carbon dioxide and [[water vapour]], which are relatively easily separated. Some of the combustion products must be returned to the combustion chamber, either before or after separation, otherwise the temperatures would be too high for the turbine.\n\nAnother long-term option is carbon capture directly from the air using [[hydroxide]]s. The air would literally be scrubbed of its CO<sub>2</sub> content.  This idea offers an alternative to non-[[Fossil fuel|carbon-based fuels]] for the transportation sector.\n\nExamples of carbon sequestration at coal plants include converting carbon from smokestacks into baking soda,<ref>utility company [http://www.luminant.com/ Luminant]'s pilot version at its [http://www.luminant.com/plants/big_brown.aspx Big Brown Steam Electric Station] in [[Fairfield, Texas]]</ref><ref>[http://www.skyonic.com/theCompany.php Skyonic] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218003544/http://www.skyonic.com/theCompany.php |date=18 December 2007 }} plans to circumvent storage problems of [[Supercritical carbon dioxide|liquid {{CO2}}]] by storing baking soda in mines, landfills, or simply to be sold as industrial or food-grade [[baking soda]].</ref> and algae-based carbon capture, circumventing storage by converting algae into fuel or feed.<ref>[http://www.greenfuelonline.com/index.html GreenFuel Technologies Corp.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116170736/http://www.greenfuelonline.com/index.html |date=16 January 2008 }}</ref>\n\n=== Oceans ===\n\nAnother proposed form of carbon sequestration in the ocean is direct injection.  In this method, carbon dioxide is pumped directly into the water at depth, and expected to form \"lakes\" of liquid CO<sub>2</sub> at the bottom. Experiments carried out in moderate to deep waters (350\u20133600 m) indicate that the liquid CO<sub>2</sub> reacts to form solid CO<sub>2</sub> [[clathrate hydrate]]s, which gradually dissolve in the surrounding waters.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nThis method, too, has potentially dangerous environmental consequences.  The carbon dioxide does react with the water to form [[carbonic acid]], H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>; however, most (as much as 99%) remains as dissolved molecular CO<sub>2</sub>. The equilibrium would no doubt be quite different under the high pressure conditions in the deep ocean. In addition, if deep-sea bacterial [[methanogen]]s that reduce carbon dioxide were to encounter the carbon dioxide sinks, levels of [[methane]] gas may increase, leading to the generation of an even worse greenhouse gas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0428/p01s04-wogi.html|title=Potent greenhouse-gas methane has been rising|author=The Christian Science Monitor|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}</ref>\nThe resulting environmental effects on [[benthic]] life forms of the [[bathypelagic]], [[abyssopelagic]] and [[hadopelagic]] zones are unknown. Even though life appears to be rather sparse in the deep ocean basins, energy and chemical effects in these deep basins could have far-reaching implications. Much more work is needed here to define the extent of the potential problems.\n\nCarbon storage in or under oceans may not be compatible with the [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2005-07-04a.7044.h | title=Carbon Sequestration |author1=Norman Baker |author2=Ben Bradshaw | accessdate=8 July 2008 | date=4 July 2005}}</ref>\n\nAn additional method of long-term ocean-based sequestration is to gather [[crop residue]] such as corn stalks or excess hay into large weighted bales of biomass and deposit it in the [[alluvial fan]] areas of the deep [[ocean basin]].  Dropping these residues in alluvial fans would cause the residues to be quickly buried in silt on the sea floor, sequestering the biomass for very long time spans.  Alluvial fans exist in all of the world's oceans and seas where river deltas fall off the edge of the [[continental shelf]] such as the [[Mississippi Delta|Mississippi alluvial fan]] in the [[gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Nile Delta|Nile alluvial fan]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. A downside, however, would be an increase in aerobic bacteria growth due to the introduction of biomass, leading to more competition for oxygen resources in the deep sea, similar to the [[oxygen minimum zone]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n=== Geological sequestration ===\n\nThe  method of  ''geo-sequestration'' or ''geological storage'' involves injecting carbon dioxide directly into underground geological formations.  Declining [[oil field]]s, saline [[aquifer]]s, and unminable [[coal seam]]s have been suggested as storage sites.  Caverns and old mines that are commonly used to store natural gas are not considered, because of a lack of storage safety.\n\nCO<sub>2</sub> has been injected into declining oil fields for more than 40 years, to increase oil recovery.  This option is attractive because the storage costs are offset by the sale of additional oil that is recovered. Typically, 10\u201315% additional recovery of the original oil in place is possible. Further benefits are the existing infrastructure and the geophysical and geological information about the oil field that is available from the oil exploration. Another benefit of injecting CO<sub>2</sub> into Oil fields is that CO<sub>2</sub> is soluble in oil.  Dissolving CO<sub>2</sub> in oil lowers the viscosity of the oil and reduces its interfacial tension which increases the oils mobility. All oil fields have a geological barrier preventing upward migration of oil. As most oil and gas has been in place for millions to tens of millions of years, depleted oil and gas reservoirs can contain carbon dioxide for millennia. Identified possible problems are the many 'leak' opportunities provided by old oil wells, the need for high injection pressures and acidification which can damage the geological barrier. Other disadvantages of old oil fields are their limited geographic distribution and depths, which require high injection pressures for sequestration.  Below a depth of about 1000 m, carbon dioxide is injected as a supercritical fluid, a material with the density of a liquid, but the viscosity and diffusivity of a gas.\nUnminable coal seams can be used to store CO<sub>2</sub>, because CO<sub>2</sub> absorbs to the coal surface, ensuring safe long-term storage.  In the process it releases methane that was previously adsorbed to the coal surface and that may be recovered.  Again the sale of the methane can be used to offset the cost of the CO<sub>2</sub> storage. Release or burning of methane would of course at least partially offset the obtained sequestration result \u2013 except when the gas is allowed to escape into the atmosphere in significant quantities: methane has a higher [[global warming potential]] than CO<sub>2</sub>.\n\nSaline aquifers contain highly mineralized brines and have so far been considered of no benefit to humans except in a few cases where they have been used for the storage of chemical waste.  Their advantages include a large potential storage volume and relatively common occurrence reducing the distance over which CO<sub>2</sub> has to be transported. The major disadvantage of saline aquifers is that relatively little is known about them compared to oil fields. Another disadvantage of saline aquifers is that as the salinity of the water increases, less CO<sub>2</sub> can be dissolved into aqueous solution. To keep the cost of storage acceptable the geophysical exploration may be limited, resulting in larger uncertainty about the structure of a given aquifer. Unlike storage in oil fields or coal beds, no side product will offset the storage cost. Leakage of CO<sub>2</sub> back into the atmosphere may be a problem in saline-aquifer storage.  However, current research shows that several ''trapping mechanisms'' immobilize the CO<sub>2</sub> underground, reducing the risk of leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nA major research project examining the geological sequestration of carbon dioxide is currently being performed at an oil field at [[Weyburn, Saskatchewan|Weyburn]] in south-eastern [[Saskatchewan]]. In the [[North Sea]], Norway's [[Equinor]] natural-gas platform [[Sleipner A|Sleipner]] strips carbon dioxide out of the natural gas with amine solvents and disposes of this carbon dioxide by geological sequestration. Sleipner reduces emissions of carbon dioxide by approximately one million tonnes a year. The cost of geological sequestration is minor relative to the overall running costs. As of April 2005, [[BP]] is considering a trial of large-scale sequestration of carbon dioxide stripped from power plant emissions in the [[Miller oilfield]] as its reserves are depleted.\n\nIn October 2007, the [[Bureau of Economic Geology]] at [[The University of Texas at Austin]] received a 10-year, $38 million subcontract to conduct the first intensively monitored, long-term project in the United States studying the feasibility of injecting a large volume of CO<sub>2</sub> for underground storage.<ref>\"Bureau of Economic Geology Receives $38 Million for First Large-Scale U.S. Test Storing Carbon Dioxide Underground\" {{cite web|url=http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/rels/102407.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182402/http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/rels/102407.html |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> The project is a research program of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080719035649/http://www.sseb.org/currentprograms/cpa_cmi.htm Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (SECARB)], funded by the [[National Energy Technology Laboratory]] of the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]]. The SECARB partnership will demonstrate CO<sub>2</sub> injection rate and storage capacity in the [[Tuscaloosa-Woodbine]] geologic system that stretches from Texas to Florida. Beginning in fall 2007, the project will inject CO<sub>2</sub> at the rate of one million tons{{Vague|which tons?|date=February 2009}} per year, for up to 1.5 years, into brine up to {{convert|10000|ft|m}} below the land surface near the [[Cranfield oil field]] about {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of [[Natchez, Mississippi]]. Experimental equipment will measure the ability of the subsurface to accept and retain CO<sub>2</sub>.\n\n=== Mineral sequestration ===\n\nMineral sequestration aims to trap carbon in the form of solid [[carbonate]] salts. This process occurs slowly in nature and is responsible for the deposition and accumulation of [[limestone]] over geologic time. [[Carbonic acid]] in groundwater slowly reacts with complex [[silicate]]s to dissolve [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[alkali]]s and [[silica]] and leave a residue of [[clay minerals]]. The dissolved calcium and magnesium react with [[bicarbonate]] to precipitate calcium and magnesium carbonates, a process that organisms use to make shells. When the organisms die, their shells are deposited as sediment and eventually turn into limestone. Limestones have accumulated over billions of years of geologic time and contain much of Earth's carbon. Ongoing research aims to speed up similar reactions involving alkali carbonates.<ref>{{cite web |title=Carbon-capture Technology To Help UK Tackle Global Warming |date=27 July 2007 |work=ScienceDaily |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070727091001.htm}}</ref>\n\nSeveral serpentinite deposits are being investigated as potentially large scale CO<sub>2</sub> storage sinks such as those found in NSW, Australia, where the first mineral carbonation pilot plant project is underway.<ref>{{cite web | title = Mineral carbonation project for NSW |date=9 June 2010 |url=http://www.sustainabilitymatters.net.au/articles/41409-Mineral-carbonation-project-for-NSW}}</ref> Beneficial re-use of magnesium carbonate from this process could provide feedstock for new products developed for the built environment and agriculture without returning the carbon into the atmosphere and so acting as a carbon sink.\n\nOne proposed reaction is that of the olivine-rich rock [[dunite]], or its hydrated equivalent [[serpentinite]] with carbon dioxide to form the carbonate mineral [[magnesite]], plus silica and iron oxide ([[magnetite]]).\n\nSerpentinite sequestration is favored because of the non-toxic and stable nature of magnesium carbonate. The ideal reactions involve the magnesium endmember components of the [[olivine]] (reaction 1) or [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] (reaction 2), the latter derived from earlier olivine by hydration and silicification (reaction 3). The presence of iron in the olivine or serpentine reduces the efficiency of sequestration, since the iron components of these minerals break down to iron oxide and silica (reaction 4).\n\n==== Serpentinite reactions ====\n\n{{NumBlk|:| {{overset|Mg-olivine|Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>}} + {{overset|carbon dioxide|2CO<sub>2</sub>}} \u2192 {{overset| magnesite |2MgCO<sub>3</sub>}} + {{overset| silica |SiO<sub>2</sub>}} + {{overset| water |H<sub>2</sub>O}}|{{EquationRef|Reaction 1}}}}\n\n{{NumBlk|:| {{overset| Serpentine |Mg<sub>3</sub>[Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>]}} + {{overset|carbon dioxide|3CO<sub>2</sub>}} \u2192 {{overset| magnesite | 3MgCO<sub>3</sub>}} + {{overset| silica |2SiO<sub>2</sub>}} + {{overset| water |2H<sub>2</sub>O}}|{{EquationRef|Reaction 2}}}}\n\n{{NumBlk|:| {{overset|Mg-olivine|3Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>}} + {{overset| silica |2SiO<sub>2</sub>}} + {{overset| water |4H<sub>2</sub>O}} \u2192 {{overset| serpentine |2Mg<sub>3</sub>[Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>]}}|{{EquationRef|Reaction 3}}}}\n\n{{NumBlk|:| {{overset|Fe-olivine|3Fe<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>}} + {{overset| water |2H<sub>2</sub>O}} \u2192 {{overset| magnetite |2Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>}} + {{overset| silica |3SiO<sub>2</sub>}} + {{overset| hydrogen |2H<sub>2</sub>}}|{{EquationRef|Reaction 4}}}}\n\n==== Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks ====\n{{Main|Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks}}\n\nZeolitic imidazolate frameworks is a [[metal-organic framework]] carbon dioxide sink which could be used to keep industrial emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] out of the [[atmosphere]].<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/02/15/tech-carbon-capture.html CBC News] article ''New materials can selectively capture CO<sub>2</sub>, scientists say'' published 15 February 2008</ref>\n\n== Trends in sink performance ==\n\nOne study in 2009 found that the fraction of fossil-fuel emissions absorbed by the oceans may have declined by up to 10% since 2000, indicating oceanic sequestration may be sublinear.<ref name=EarthInst/> However, another study by [[Wolfgang Knorr]] indicated that the fraction of {{CO2}} absorbed by carbon sinks has not changed since 1850.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Knorr, W. |title=Is the airborne fraction of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increasing? |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=36 |issue=21 |pages=L21710 |year=2009 |doi=10.1029/2009GL040613 |laysummary=[http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2009/6649.html Controversial new climate change results] |laydate=9 November 2009 |bibcode=2009GeoRL..3621710K}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n* [[Biochar]]\n* [[Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage]]\n* [[Carbon capture and storage]]\n* [[Carbon cycle]]\n* [[Carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems]]\n* [[Fluxnet-Canada Research Network]], research initiative on post forest disturbance carbon sinking\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071212045529/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/environqlty/co201.htm Gulf Coast Carbon Center]\n* [http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/carbon_seq/index.html National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) Carbon Sequestration]\n* [http://sequestration.mit.edu/  Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies Program at MIT]\n* [http://www.princeton.edu/~cmi/ Carbon Mitigation Initiative]\n* [http://www.nacarbon.org/ The U.S. North American Carbon Program]\n* [http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/sccs/ Scottish Centre for Carbon Storage Research]\n\n{{Global warming}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carbon Sink}}\n[[Category:Carbon dioxide]]\n[[Category:Carbon sequestration]]\n[[Category:Climate forcing agents]]\n[[Category:Photosynthesis]]\n[[Category:Gas technologies]]", "sha1": "efjb3zo6dhzpyef3aqff5kg296f658p"}}, {"title": "Charles Tupper", "ns": "0", "id": "5981", "revision": {"id": "863003481", "parentid": "862970883", "timestamp": "2018-10-08T02:33:48Z", "contributor": {"username": "Nikkimaria", "id": "372290"}, "comment": "Reverted [[WP:AGF|good faith]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/76.10.163.189|76.10.163.189]] ([[User talk:76.10.163.189|talk]]): Already linked above.

He entered Nova Scotian politics in 1855 as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[James William Johnston]]. During Johnston's tenure as premier of Nova Scotia in 1857\u201359 and 1863\u201364, Tupper served as [[Provincial Secretary|provincial secretary]]. Tupper replaced Johnston as premier in 1864.  As premier, he established [[public education]] in Nova Scotia  and expanded Nova Scotia's railway network in order to promote industry.\n\nBy 1860, Tupper supported a union of all the colonies of [[British North America]].  Believing that immediate union of all the colonies was impossible, in 1864, he proposed a [[Maritime Union]].  However, representatives of the [[Province of Canada]] asked to be allowed to attend the meeting in [[Charlottetown]] scheduled to discuss Maritime Union in order to present a proposal for a wider union, and the [[Charlottetown Conference]] thus became the first of the three conferences that secured Canadian Confederation.  Tupper also represented Nova Scotia at the other two conferences, the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]] (1864) and the [[London Conference of 1866]].  In Nova Scotia, Tupper organized a [[Confederation Party]] to combat the activities of the [[Anti-Confederation Party]] organized by [[Joseph Howe]] and successfully led Nova Scotia into Confederation.\n\nFollowing the passage of the [[British North America Act]] in 1867, Tupper resigned as premier of Nova Scotia and began a career in federal politics.  He held multiple [[Cabinet of Canada|cabinet]] positions under Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. Macdonald]], including [[President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] (1870\u201372), [[Minister of Inland Revenue (Canada)|Minister of Inland Revenue]] (1872\u201373), [[Minister of Customs]] (1873\u201374), [[Minister of Public Works (Canada)|Minister of Public Works]] (1878\u201379), and [[Minister of Railways and Canals (Canada)|Minister of Railways and Canals]] (1879\u201384).  Initially groomed as Macdonald's successor, Tupper had a falling out with Macdonald, and by the early 1880s, he asked Macdonald to appoint him as [[Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom]].  Tupper took up his post in [[London]] in 1883, and would remain High Commissioner until 1895, although in 1887\u201388, he served as [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] without relinquishing the High Commissionership.\n\nIn 1895, the government of [[Mackenzie Bowell|Sir Mackenzie Bowell]] foundered over the [[Manitoba Schools Question]]; as a result, several leading members of the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party of Canada]] demanded the return of Tupper to serve as prime minister.  Tupper accepted this invitation and returned to Canada, becoming prime minister in May 1896.  [[Canadian federal election, 1896|An election was called]], just before he was sworn in as prime minister, which his party  lost to [[Wilfrid Laurier]] and the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]]. Tupper served as [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] from July 1896 until 1900, at which point he returned to London, England, where he lived until his death in 1915 and was laid to rest back in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], Nova Scotia.

He argued that with Nova Scotia's \"inexhaustible mines\", it could become \"a vast manufacturing mart\" for the east coast of North America.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He quickly persuaded Johnston to end the General Mining Association's monopoly over Nova Scotia minerals.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nIn June 1857 Tupper initiated discussions with [[New Brunswick]] and the [[Province of Canada]] concerning an [[Intercolonial Railway of Canada|intercolonial railway]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He traveled to [[London]] in 1858 to attempt to secure [[British Empire|imperial]] backing for this project.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> During these discussions, Tupper realized that Canadians were more interested in discussing federal union, while the British (with the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] in his second term as [[prime minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]) were too absorbed in their own immediate interests.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> As such, nothing came of the 1858 discussions for an intercolonial railway.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nSectarian conflict played a major role in the May 1859 elections, with Catholics largely supporting the Conservatives and [[Protestants]] shifting toward the Liberals.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper barely retained his seat.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The Conservatives were barely re-elected and lost a [[confidence vote]] later that year.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Johnston asked the [[Governor of Nova Scotia]], [[George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby|Lord Mulgrave]], for [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolution]], but Mulgrave refused and invited William Young to form a government.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper was outraged and petitioned the British government, asking them to recall Mulgrave.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nFor the next three years, Tupper was ferocious in his denunciations of the Liberal government, first Young, and then Joseph Howe, who succeeded Young in 1860.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> This came to a head in 1863 when the Liberals introduced legislation to restrict the Nova Scotia [[Suffrage|franchise]], a move which Johnston and Tupper successfully blocked.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nTupper continued practicing medicine during this period. He established a successful medical practice in Halifax, rising to become the city medical officer.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> In 1863 he was elected president of the Medical Society of Nova Scotia.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nIn the June 1863 election, the Conservatives campaigned on a platform of railroad construction and expanded access to public education.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The Conservatives won a large majority, taking 44 of the House of Assembly's 55 seats. Johnston resumed his duties as premier and Tupper again became provincial secretary.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> As a further sign of the Conservatives' commitment to non-sectarianism, in 1863, after a 20-year hiatus, [[Dalhousie College]] was re-opened as a non-denominational institution of higher learning.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nJohnston retired from politics in May 1864 when he was appointed as a judge, and Tupper was chosen as his successor as premier of Nova Scotia.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n==Premier of Nova Scotia, 1864\u20131867==\n\nTupper  introduced ambitious education legislation in 1864 creating a system of state-subsidized [[common schools]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> In 1865 he introduced a bill providing for compulsory local taxation to fund these schools.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Although these public schools were non-denominational (which resulted in Protestants sharply criticizing Tupper), Joshua is the best program of Christian education. However, many Protestants, particularly fellow Baptists, felt that Tupper had sold them out.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> To regain their trust he appointed Baptist educator [[Theodore Harding Rand]] as Nova Scotia's first [[superintendent of education]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> This raised concern among Catholics, led by [[Thomas-Louis Connolly]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Halifax-Yarmouth|Archbishop of Halifax]], who demanded state-funded [[Catholic schools]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper reached a compromise with Archbishop Connolly whereby Catholic-run schools could receive public funding, so long as they provided their religious instruction after hours.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nMaking good on his promise for expanded railroad construction, in 1864 Tupper appointed [[Sandford Fleming]] as the chief engineer of the [[Nova Scotia Railway]] in order to expand the line from [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]] to [[Pictou Landing, Nova Scotia|Pictou Landing]].<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> In January 1866 he awarded Fleming a contract to complete the line after local contractors proved too slow.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Though this decision was controversial, it did result in the line's being completed by May 1867.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> A second proposed line, from [[Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia|Annapolis Royal]] to [[Windsor, Nova Scotia|Windsor]] initially faltered, but was eventually completed in 1869 by the privately owned [[Windsor and Annapolis Railway|Windsor & Annapolis Railway]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n===Tupper's role in securing Canadian Confederation===\nIn the run-up to the 1859 Nova Scotia election, Tupper had been unwilling to commit to the idea of a union with the other [[British North American]] colonies.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> By 1860, however, he had reconsidered his position.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper outlined his changed position in a lecture delivered at [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] entitled \"The Political Condition of British North America.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The title of the lecture was an homage to [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]]'s 1838 ''[[Report on the Affairs of British North America]]'' and assessed the condition of British North America in the two decades following Lord Durham's famous report. Although Tupper was interested in the potential economic consequences of a union with the other colonies, the bulk of his lecture addressed the place of British North America within the wider [[British Empire]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Having been convinced by his 1858 trip to London that British politicians were unwilling to pay attention to small colonies such as Nova Scotia, Tupper argued that Nova Scotia and the other [[Maritimes|Maritime]] colonies \"could never hope to occupy a position of influence or importance except in connection with their larger sister Canada.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper therefore proposed to create a \"British America\", which \"stretching from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], would in a few years exhibit to the world a great and powerful organization, with British Institutions, British sympathies, and British feelings, bound indissolubly to [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|the throne of England]].\"<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n====Charlottetown Conference, September 1864====\n[[Image:CharlottetownConference1864.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Tupper and other delegates of the [[Charlottetown Conference]] on the steps of [[Government House (Prince Edward Island)|Government House]], September 1864]]\nWith the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, Tupper worried that a victorious [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] would turn northward and conquer the British North American provinces.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> This caused him to redouble his commitment to union, which he now saw as essential to protecting the British colonies against American aggression.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Since he thought that full union among the British North American colonies would be unachievable for many years, on March 28, 1864, Tupper instead proposed a [[Maritime Union]] which would unite the Maritime provinces in advance of a projected future union with the Province of Canada.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> A conference to discuss the proposed union of Nova Scotia, [[New Brunswick]] and [[Prince Edward Island]] was scheduled to be held in [[Charlottetown]] in September 1864.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nTupper was pleasantly surprised when the [[Premier of the Province of Canada]], [[John A. Macdonald]], asked to be allowed to attend the [[Charlottetown Conference]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The Conference, which was co-chaired by Tupper and [[New Brunswick Premier]] [[Samuel Leonard Tilley]], welcomed the Canadian delegation and asked them to join the conference.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The conference proved to be a smashing success, and resulted in an agreement-in-principle to form a union of the four colonies.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n====Quebec Conference, October 1864====\nThe [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]] was held on October 10, as a follow-up to the Charlottetown Conference, with [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] only attending to observe.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper headed the Nova Scotia delegation to the Quebec Conference.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He supported a legislative union of the colonies (which would mean that there would be only one legislature for the united colonies).<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> However, the [[French Canadian]] delegates to the conference, notably [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]] and [[Hector-Louis Langevin]], strongly opposed the idea of a legislative union. Tupper threw his weight behind Macdonald's proposal for a [[Federalism|federal]] union, which would see each colony retain its own legislature, with a central legislature in charge of common interests.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper argued in favour of a strong central government as a second best to a pure legislative union.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He felt, however, that the local legislatures should retain the ability to levy duties on their natural resources.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nConcerned that a united legislature would be dominated by the Province of Canada, Tupper pushed for regional representation in the upper house of the confederated colonies (a goal which would be achieved in the makeup of the [[Senate of Canada]]).<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nOn the topic of which level of government would control customs in the union, Tupper ultimately agreed to accept the formula by which the federal government controlled customs in exchange for an annual subsidy of 80 cents a year for each Nova Scotian.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> This deal was ultimately not good for Nova Scotia, which had historically received most of its government revenue from customs, and as a result, Nova Scotia entered Confederation with a [[Government budget deficit|deficit]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n[[Image:YoungTupper2.JPG|150px|thumb|left|Tupper in 1865]]\n\n====Aftermath of the Quebec Conference====\nAlthough Tupper had given up much at the Quebec Conference, he thought that he would be able to convince Nova Scotians that the deal he negotiated was in some good for Nova Scotia.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He was therefore surprised when the deal he had negotiated at Quebec was roundly criticized by Nova Scotians: the Opposition Leader [[Adams George Archibald]] was the only member of the Liberal caucus to support Confederation.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Former premier Joseph Howe now organized an [[Anti-Confederation Party]] and anti-Confederation sentiments were so strong that Tupper decided to postpone a vote of the legislature on the question of Confederation for a full year.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper now organized supporters of Confederation into a [[Confederation Party]] to push for the union.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nIn April 1866, Tupper secured a motion of the Nova Scotia legislature in favour of union by promising that he would renegotiate the [[Seventy-two Resolutions]] at the upcoming [[London Conference of 1866|conference in London]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n====London Conference, 1866====\nJoseph Howe had begun a pamphlet campaign in the UK to turn British public opinion against the proposed union.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Therefore, when Tupper arrived in the UK, he immediately initiated a campaign of pamphlets and letters to the editor designed to refute Howe's assertions.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nAlthough Tupper did attempt to renegotiate the 72 Resolutions as he had promised, he was ineffective in securing any major changes.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The only major change agreed to at the London Conference arguably did not benefit Nova Scotia - responsibility for the [[fisheries]], which was going to be a joint federal-provincial responsibility under the Quebec agreement, became solely a federal concern.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n====The final push for Confederation====\nFollowing passage of the [[British North America Act]] in the wake of the London Conference, Tupper returned to Nova Scotia to undertake preparations for the union,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> which came into existence on July 1, 1867, and on July 4, Tupper turned over responsibility for the government of Nova Scotia to [[Hiram Blanchard]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nIn honour of the role he had played in securing Confederation, Tupper was made a [[Companion in The Most Honourable Order of the Bath]] in 1867.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He was now entitled to use the postnomial letters \"CB\".\n\n==Career in the Parliament of Canada, 1867\u20131884==\n\n{{See also|Electoral history of Charles Tupper}}\n\n===Fighting the Anti-Confederates, 1867\u20131869===\n\nThe [[Canadian federal election, 1867|first elections]] for the new [[House of Commons of Canada]] were held in August\u2013September 1867. Tupper ran as a member for the new federal riding of [[Cumberland (electoral district)|Cumberland]] and won his seat.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> However, he was the only pro-Confederation candidate to win a seat from Nova Scotia in the [[1st Canadian Parliament]], with Joseph Howe and the Anti-Confederates winning every other seat.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n[[Image:CharlesTupper1870.jpg|thumb|right|Tupper in April 1870]]\nAs an ally of Sir John A. Macdonald and the [[Liberal-Conservative Party]], it was widely believed that Tupper would have a place in the first [[Cabinet of Canada]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> However, when Macdonald ran into difficulties in organizing this cabinet, Tupper stepped aside in favour of [[Edward Kenny]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Instead, Tupper set up a medical practice in [[Ottawa]] and was elected as the first president of the new [[Canadian Medical Association]], a position he held until 1870.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nIn the November 1867 provincial elections in Nova Scotia, the pro-Confederation Hiram Blanchard was defeated by the leader of the Anti-Confederation Party, [[William Annand]]. Given the unpopularity of Confederation within Nova Scotia, Joseph Howe traveled to London in 1868 to attempt to persuade the British government (headed by the Earl of Derby, and then after February 1868 by [[Benjamin Disraeli]]) to allow Nova Scotia to secede from Confederation.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper followed Howe to London where he successfully lobbied British politicians against allowing Nova Scotia to secede.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nFollowing his victory in London, Tupper proposed a reconciliation with Howe: in exchange for Howe's agreeing to stop fighting against the union, Tupper and Howe would be allies in the fight to protect Nova Scotia's interests within Confederation.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Howe agreed to Tupper's proposal and in January 1869 entered the Canadian cabinet as [[President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[Red River Rebellion]] in 1869, Tupper was distressed to find that his daughter Emma's husband was being held hostage by [[Louis Riel]] and the rebels.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He rushed to the northwest to rescue his son-in-law.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n[[Image:TupperWorking1871.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Tupper in November 1871]]\n\n===President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, 1870\u20131872===\nWhen Howe's health declined the next year, Tupper finally entered the [[1st Canadian Ministry]] by becoming Privy Council president in June 1870.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nThe next year was dominated by a dispute with the United States regarding US access to the Atlantic [[fisheries]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper thought that the British should restrict American access to these fisheries so that they could negotiate from a position of strength.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> When Prime Minister Macdonald travelled to represent Canada's interests at the negotiations leading up to the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)]], Tupper served as Macdonald's liaison with the federal cabinet.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n===Minister of Inland Revenue, 1872\u20131873===\nOn January 19, 1872, Tupper's service as Privy Council president ended and he became [[Minister of Inland Revenue (Canada)|Minister of Inland Revenue]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nTupper led the Nova Scotia campaign for the Liberal-Conservative party during the [[Canadian federal election, 1872|Canadian federal election of 1872]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> His efforts paid off when Nova Scotia returned not a single Anti-Confederate [[Member of Parliament]] to the [[2nd Canadian Parliament]], and 20 of Nova Scotia's 21 MPs were Liberal-Conservatives.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> (The Liberal-Conservative Party changed its name to the [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867\u20131942)|Conservative Party]] in 1873.)\n\n===Minister of Customs, 1873\u20131874===\n[[Image:CharlesTupper1873.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Tupper in August 1873]]\nIn February 1873, Tupper was shifted from Inland Revenue to become [[Minister of Customs]], and in this position he was successful in having [[Imperial unit|British weights and measures]] adopted as the uniform standard for the united colonies.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nHe would not hold this post for long, however, as Macdonald's government was rocked by the [[Pacific Scandal]] throughout 1873. In November 1873, the 1st Canadian Ministry was forced to resign and was replaced by the [[2nd Canadian Ministry]] headed by [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]].\n\n===Years in Opposition, 1874\u20131878===\nTupper had not been involved in the Pacific Scandal, but he nevertheless continued to support Macdonald and his Conservative colleagues both before and after the [[Canadian federal election, 1874|1874 election]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The 1874 election was disastrous for the Conservatives, and in Nova Scotia, Tupper was one of only two Conservative MPs returned to the [[3rd Canadian Parliament]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nThough Macdonald stayed on as Conservative leader, Tupper now assumed a more prominent role in the Conservative Party and was widely seen as Macdonald's heir apparent.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He led Conservative attacks on the Mackenzie government throughout the 3rd Parliament.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The Mackenzie government attempted to negotiate a new [[free trade agreement]] with the United States to replace the [[Canadian\u2013American Reciprocity Treaty]] which the U.S. had abrogated in 1864.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> When Mackenzie proved unable to achieve reciprocity, Tupper began shifting toward [[protectionism]] and became a proponent of the [[National Policy]] which became a part of the Conservative [[Party platform|platform]] in 1876.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The sincerity of Tupper's conversion to the protectionist cause was doubted at the time, however: according to one apocryphal story, when Tupper came to the 1876 debate on [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Finance Minister]] [[Richard John Cartwright]]'s budget, he was prepared to advocate [[free trade]] if Cartwright had announced that the Liberals had shifted their position and were now supporting protectionism.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nTupper was also deeply critical of Mackenzie's approach to railways, arguing that completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], which would link [[British Columbia]] (which entered Confederation in 1871) with the rest of Canada, should be a stronger government priority than it was for Mackenzie.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> This position also became an integral part of the Conservative platform.\n\nAs on previous occasions when he was not in cabinet, Tupper was active in practicing medicine during the 1874\u201378 stint in Opposition, though he was dedicating less and less of his time to medicine during this period.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nTupper was a councillor of the [[Oxford Military College]] in [[Cowley, Oxfordshire|Cowley]] and [[Oxford]], [[Oxfordshire]] from 1876\u20131896.\n\n===Minister of Public Works, 1878\u20131879===\nDuring the [[Canadian federal election, 1878|1878 election]] Tupper again led the Conservative campaign in Nova Scotia.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The Conservatives under Macdonald won a resounding majority in the election, in the process capturing 16 of Nova Scotia's 21 seats in the [[4th Canadian Parliament]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nWith the formation of the [[3rd Canadian Ministry]] on October 17, 1878, Tupper became [[Minister of Public Works (Canada)|Minister of Public Works]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> His top priority was completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which he saw as \"an Imperial Highway across the Continent of America entirely on British soil.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> This marked a shift in Tupper's position: although he had long argued that completion of the railway should be a major government priority, while Tupper was in Opposition, he argued that the railway should be privately constructed; he now argued that the railway ought to be completed as a [[public work]], partly because he believed that the private sector could not complete the railroad given the [[recession]] which gripped the country throughout the 1870s.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n===Minister of Railways and Canals, 1879\u20131884===\nIn May 1879 Macdonald decided that completion of the railway was such a priority that he created a new ministry to focus on railways and canals, and Tupper became Canada's first [[Minister of Railways and Canals (Canada)|Minister of Railways and Canals]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nTupper's motto as Minister of Railways and Canals was \"Develop our resources.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He stated \"I have always supposed that the great object, in every country, and especially in a new country, was to draw as [many] [[Capitalism|capitalists]] into it as possible.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nTupper traveled to London in summer 1879 to attempt to persuade the British government (then headed by [[Benjamin Disraeli|the Earl of Beaconsfield]] in his second term as prime minister) to [[guarantee]] a [[Government bond|bond]] sale to be used to construct the railway.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He was not successful, though he did manage to purchase 50,000 tons of steel rails at a bargain price.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper's old friend Sandford Fleming oversaw the railway construction, but his inability to keep costs down led to political controversy, and Tupper was forced to remove Fleming as Chief Engineer in May 1880.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n1879 also saw Tupper made a [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George]], and thus entitled to use the postnominal letters \"KCMG\".<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n[[Image:Tupper1881.jpg|thumb|left|Tupper in September 1881]]\nIn 1880, [[George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen|George Stephen]] approached Tupper on behalf of a [[syndicate]] and asked to be allowed to take over construction of the railway.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Convinced that Stephen's syndicate was up to the task, Tupper convinced the cabinet to back the plan at a meeting in June 1880 and, together with Macdonald, negotiated a contract with the syndicate in October.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The syndicate successfully created the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in February 1881 and assumed construction of the railway shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nIn the following years Tupper was a vocal supporter of the CPR during its competition with the [[Grand Trunk Railway]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> In December 1883 he worked out a rescue plan for the CPR after it faced financial difficulties and persuaded his party and Parliament to accept the plan.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nIn addition to his support for completion of the CPR, Tupper also actively managed the existing railways in the colonies.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Shortly after becoming minister in 1879, he forced the [[Intercolonial Railway]] to lower its freight rates, which had been a major grievance of Maritime business interests.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He then forced the Grand Trunk Railway to sell its [[Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup, Quebec|Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup]] line to the Intercolonial Railway to complete a link between Halifax and the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He also refused to give the CPR [[running rights]] over the Intercolonial Railway, though he did convince the CPR to build the Short Line from Halifax to Saint John.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nIn terms of canals, Tupper's time as Minister of Railways and Canals is notable for large expenditures on widening the [[Welland Canal]] and deepening the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n====Deterioration of relationship with Macdonald and appointment as High Commissioner====\nA rift developed between Tupper and Macdonald in 1879 over Sandford Fleming, whom Tupper supported but whom Macdonald wanted removed as Chief Engineer of the CPR.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> This rift was partially healed and Tupper and Macdonald managed to work together during the negotiations with George Stephen's syndicate in 1880, but the men were no longer close, and Tupper no longer seemed to be Macdonald's heir apparent.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> By early 1881 Tupper had determined that he should leave the cabinet.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> In March 1881 he asked Macdonald to appoint him as Canada's [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]] in London.

On the [[European continent]], Dr. Otto Hahn, of Reutlingen, has continued to act as Agent in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/~marj/genealogy/reports/report1883.html|title=Immigrants to Canada - Immigration Report of 1883|first=Marj|last=Kohli|publisher=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1883 Tupper convinced [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s government to exempt Canadian cattle from the general British ban on importing American cattle by demonstrating that Canadian cattle were free of disease.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nHis other duties as High Commissioner included: putting Canadian exporters in contact with British importers; negotiating loans for the Canadian government and the CPR; helping to organize the [[Colonial and Indian Exhibition]] of 1886; arranging for a subsidy for the mail ship from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] to the [[Orient]]; and lobbying on behalf of a British-Pacific cable along the lines of the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] and for a faster transatlantic [[steam ship]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nTupper was present at the founding meeting of the [[Imperial Federation League]] in July 1884, where he argued against a resolution which said that the only options open to the British Empire were [[Imperial Federation]] or disintegration.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper believed that a form of limited federation was possible and desirable.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n===Interlude as Minister of Finance, 1887\u20131888===\n1884 saw the election of Liberal [[William Stevens Fielding]] as Premier of Nova Scotia after Fielding campaigned on a platform of leading Nova Scotia out of Confederation.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> As such, throughout 1886, Macdonald begged Tupper to return to Canada to fight the Anti-Confederates.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> In January 1887 Tupper returned to Canada to rejoin the 3rd Canadian Ministry as [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance of Canada]], while retaining his post as High Commissioner.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Canadian federal election, 1887|1887 federal election]], Tupper again presented the pro-Confederation argument to the people of Nova Scotia, and again the Conservatives won 14 of Nova Scotia's 21 seats in the [[6th Canadian Parliament]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nDuring his year as finance minister, Tupper retained the government's commitment to protectionism, even extending it to the [[iron and steel industry]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> By this time Tupper was convinced that Canada was ready to move on to its second stage of [[Industrialisation|industrial development]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> In part, he held out the prospect of the development of a great iron industry as an inducement to keep Nova Scotia from seceding.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nTupper's unique position of being both Minister of Finance and High Commissioner to London served him well in an emerging crisis in [[American-Canadian relations]]: in 1885, the U.S. abrogated the fisheries clause of the Treaty of Washington (1871), and the Canadian government retaliated against American fishermen with a narrow reading of the [[Treaty of 1818]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Acting as High Commissioner, Tupper pressured the British government (then led by [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]) to stand firm in defending Canada's rights.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The result was the appointment of a Joint Commission in 1887, with Tupper serving as one of the three British commissioners to negotiate with the Americans.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Salisbury selected [[Joseph Chamberlain]] as one of the British commissioners.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> [[John Sparrow David Thompson|John Thompson]] served as the British delegation's legal counsel.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> During the negotiations, [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Thomas F. Bayard]] complained that \"Mr. Chamberlain has yielded the control of the negotiations over to Sir Charles Tupper, who subjects the questions to the demands of Canadian politics.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The result of the negotiations was a treaty (the Treaty of Washington of 1888) that made such concessions to Canada that it was ultimately rejected by the [[American Senate]] in February 1888.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> However, although the treaty was rejected, the Commission had managed to temporarily resolve the dispute.\n\nFollowing the long conclusion of these negotiations, Tupper decided to return to London to become High-Commissioner full-time.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Macdonald tried to persuade Tupper to stay in Ottawa: during the political crisis surrounding the 1885 [[North-West Rebellion]], Macdonald had pledged to nominate Sir Hector-Louis Langevin as his successor; Macdonald now told Tupper that he would break this promise and nominate Tupper as his successor.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper was not convinced, however, and resigned as Minister of Finance on May 23, 1888, and moved back to London.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n===Later years as High Commissioner, 1888\u20131895===\n[[Image:The Old Flag! The Old Guard and the Old Principle!.jpg|150px|thumb|left|\"The Old Flag! The Old Guard and the Old Principle!\" Conservative Party election poster, with Charles Tupper and Hugh John Macdonald, during the [[Canadian federal election, 1891|1891 election]]]]\nFor Tupper's work on the Joint Commission, Joseph Chamberlain arranged for Tupper to become a [[Baronetage of the United Kingdom|baronet of the United Kingdom]], and the [[Tupper Baronetcy]] was created on September 13, 1888.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nIn 1889, tensions were high between the U.S. and Canada when the U.S. banned Canadians from engaging in the [[seal hunt]] in the [[Bering Sea]] as part of the ongoing [[Bering Sea Dispute]] between the U.S. and Britain.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] to represent Canadian interests during the negotiations and was something of an embarrassment to the British diplomats.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nWhen, in 1890, the provincial secretary of Newfoundland, [[Robert Bond]], negotiated a fisheries treaty with the U.S. that Tupper felt was not in Canada's interest, Tupper successfully persuaded the British government (then under Lord Salisbury's second term) to reject the treaty.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nTupper remained an active politician during his time as High Commissioner, which was controversial because diplomats are traditionally expected to be nonpartisan.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> (Tupper's successor as High Commissioner, [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Donald Smith]] would succeed in turning the High Commissioner's office into a nonpartisan office.) As such, Tupper returned to Canada to campaign on behalf of the Conservatives' National Policy during the [[Canadian federal election, 1891|1891 election]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n[[Image:Tupperfamily.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Sir Charles Tupper with his son [[Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper]] and his grandson, March 1891]]\nTupper continued to be active in the Imperial Federation League, though after 1887, the League was split over the issue of regular colonial contribution to imperial defense.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> As a result, the League was dissolved in 1893, for which some people blamed Tupper.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nWith respect to the British Empire, Tupper advocated a system of mutual preferential trading. In a series of articles in ''[[Nineteenth Century (periodical)|Nineteenth Century]]'' in 1891 and 1892, Tupper denounced the position that Canada should unilaterally reduce its tariff on British goods.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Rather, he argued that any such tariff reduction should only come as part of a wider trade agreement in which tariffs on Canadian goods would also be reduced at the same time.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nSir John A. Macdonald's death in 1891 opened the possibility of Tupper's replacing him as [[Prime Minister of Canada]], but Tupper enjoyed life in London and decided against returning to Canada.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He recommended that his son support [[John Sparrow David Thompson|Sir John Thompson]]'s prime ministerial bid.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n==Tupper becomes prime minister, 1895\u20131896==\nSir John Thompson died suddenly in office in December 1894. Many observers expected the [[Governor General of Canada]], [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|Lord Aberdeen]], to invite Tupper to return to Canada to become prime minister.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> However, Lord Aberdeen disliked Tupper and instead invited [[Sir Mackenzie Bowell]] to replace Thompson as prime minister.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>  \n[[Image:TupperCartoon.jpg|thumb|left|\"Sir Charles Tupper et le parlement\": [[political cartoon]] from February 1896]]\n\nThe greatest challenge facing Bowell as prime minister was the [[Manitoba Schools Question]]. The Conservative Party was bitterly divided on how to handle the Manitoba Schools Question, and as a result, on January 4, 1896, seven cabinet ministers resigned, demanding the return of Tupper.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> As a result, Bowell and Aberdeen were forced to invite Tupper to join the [[6th Canadian Ministry]] and on January 15 Tupper became [[Secretary of State for Canada]], with the understanding that he would become prime minister following the dissolution of the [[7th Canadian Parliament]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nReturning to Canada, Tupper was elected to the 7th Canadian Parliament as member for [[Cape Breton (electoral district)|Cape Breton]] during a [[by-election]] held on February 4, 1896.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> At this point, Tupper was the ''de facto'' prime minister, though legally Bowell was still prime minister.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nTupper's position on the Manitoba Schools Act was that French Catholics in Manitoba had been promised the right to separate state-funded French-language Catholic schools in the [[Manitoba Act]] of 1870.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Thus, even though he personally opposed French-language Catholic schools in Manitoba, he believed that the government should stand by its promise and therefore oppose [[Dalton McCarthy]]'s [[Manitoba Schools Act]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He maintained this position even after the Manitoba Schools Act was upheld by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nIn 1895 the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ruled that the Canadian federal government could pass remedial legislation to overrule the Manitoba Schools Act (''see'' [[Disallowance and reservation]]).<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Therefore, in February 1896 Tupper introduced this remedial legislation in the House of Commons.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The bill was [[filibuster]]ed by a combination of extreme Protestants led by McCarthy and Liberals led by [[Wilfrid Laurier]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> This filibuster resulted in Tupper's abandoning the bill and asking for a dissolution.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n==Prime Minister, May\u2013July 1896==\n[[Image:Sir charles tupper.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Tupper, January 1896]]\nParliament was dissolved on April 24, 1896, and the [[7th Canadian Ministry]] with Tupper as prime minister was sworn in on May 1<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> making him, with [[John Turner]] and [[Kim Campbell]], one of the only three prime ministers to never sit in Parliament while in office as Prime Minister. Tupper remains the oldest person ever to become Canadian prime minister, at age 74.\n\nThroughout the [[Canadian federal election, 1896|1896 election]] campaign, Tupper argued that the real issue of the election was the future of Canadian industry, and insisted that Conservatives needed to unite to defeat the [[Patrons of Industry]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> However, the Conservatives were so bitterly divided over the Manitoba Schools Question that wherever he spoke, he was faced with a barrage of criticism, most notably at a two-hour address he gave at [[Massey Hall]] in Toronto, which was constantly interrupted by the crowd.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nWilfrid Laurier, on the other hand, modified the traditional Liberal stance on free trade and embraced aspects of the National Policy.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nIn the end, the Conservatives won the most votes in the 1896 election (48.2% of the votes, in comparison to 41.4% for the Liberals). However, they captured only about half of the seats in [[English Canada]], while Laurier's Liberals won a landslide victory in [[Quebec]], where Tupper's reputation as an ardent [[imperialist]] was a major handicap.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper's inability to persuade [[Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau]] to return to active politics as his [[Quebec lieutenant]] was the nail in the coffin for the Conservatives' campaign in Quebec.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nAlthough Laurier had clearly won the election on June 24, Tupper initially refused to cede power, insisting that Laurier would be unable to form a government despite the Liberal Party's having won 55% of the seats in the House of Commons.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> However, when Tupper attempted to make appointments as prime minister, Lord Aberdeen refused to act on Tupper's advice. Tupper then chose to resign immediately and Aberdeen invited Laurier to form a government.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper maintained that Lord Aberdeen's actions were [[unconstitutional]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nTupper's 68 days is the shortest term of all prime ministers. His government never faced a Parliament.\n\n==Leader of the Opposition, 1896\u20131900==\n[[Image:CharlesandLadyTupper.jpg|thumb|left|Sir Charles and [[Frances Tupper|Lady Tupper]], October 1896]]\n\nAs Leader of the Opposition during the [[8th Canadian Parliament]], Tupper attempted to regain the loyalty of those Conservatives who had deserted the party over the [[Manitoba Schools Question]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He played up loyalty to the British Empire.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Tupper strongly supported Canadian participation in the [[Second Boer War]], which broke out in 1899, and criticized Laurier for not doing enough to support Britain in the war.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nThe [[Canadian federal election, 1900|1900 election]] saw the Conservatives pick up 17 Ontario seats in the [[9th Canadian Parliament]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> This was a small consolation, however, Laurier's Liberals won a definitive majority and had a clear mandate for a second term.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Worse for Tupper was the fact he had failed to carry his own seat, losing the Cape Breton seat to Liberal [[Alexander Johnston (Canadian politician)|Alexander Johnston]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> In November 1900, two weeks after the election, Tupper stepped down as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and Leader of the Opposition - the caucus chose as his successor fellow Nova Scotian [[Robert Laird Borden]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n==Later years, 1901\u20131915==\nFollowing his defeat in the 1900 election, Tupper and his wife settled with their daughter Emma in [[Bexleyheath]] in north-west Kent.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He continued to make frequent trips to Canada to visit his sons [[Charles Hibbert Tupper]] and [[William Johnston Tupper]], both of whom were Canadian politicians.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n[[Image:TupperCrownLife.jpg|thumb|right|Tupper at a meeting of the directors of the [[Crown Life Insurance Company]] in Toronto, ca 1900]]\nOn November 9, 1907, Tupper became a member of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|British Privy Council]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He was also promoted to the rank of [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George]], which entitled him to use the postnominal letters \"GCMG\".<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nTupper remained interested in imperial politics, and particularly with promoting Canada's place within the British Empire. He sat on the executive committee of the [[British Empire League]] and advocated closer economic ties between Canada and Britain, while continuing to oppose Imperial Federation and requests for Canada to make a direct contribution to imperial defense costs (though he supported Borden's decision to voluntarily make an emergency contribution of [[dreadnoughts]] to the [[Royal Navy]] in 1912).<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\nIn his retirement, Tupper wrote his [[memoirs]], entitled ''Recollections of Sixty Years in Canada'', which were published in 1914.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He also gave a series of interviews to journalist W. A. Harkin which formed the basis of a second book published in 1914, entitled ''Political Reminiscences of the Right Honourable Sir Charles Tupper''.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nTupper's wife, [[Frances Tupper|Lady Tupper]] died in May 1912.<ref name=lady/> His eldest son Orin died in April 1915.

As the [[Premier of Nova Scotia]] from 1864 to 1867, he led [[Nova Scotia]] into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] and persuaded [[Joseph Howe]] to join the new federal government, bringing an end to the anti-Confederation movement in Nova Scotia.\n\nIn their 1999 study of the Canadian Prime Ministers through [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]], [[J.L. Granatstein]] and [[Norman Hillmer]] included the results of a survey of Canadian historians ranking the Prime Ministers. Tupper ranked No. 16 out of the 20 up to that time, due to his extremely short tenure in which he was unable to accomplish anything of significance. Historians noted that despite Tupper's elderly age, he showed a determination and spirit during his brief time as Prime Minister that almost beat Laurier in the 1896 election.<ref>Granatstein and Hillman, Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada's Leaders, p. 45</ref>\n\n[[Mount Tupper]] in the Canadian Rockies was named for him.\n\n== Facility naming ==\n*[[Sir Charles Tupper Secondary School]] in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia\n* Sir Charles Tupper School in Halifax\n* Sir Charles Tupper Medical Building at the [[Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University]]\n* Sir Charles Tupper Building in Ottawa\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Portal|Nova Scotia|Canadian politics}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*Johanna Bertin, ''Sir Charles Tupper: The Bully for Any Great Cause'' (2006)\n*{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Tupper, Sir Charles|volume=27}}\n*[[Thomas John Murray|Jock Murray]] and Janet Murray, ''Sir Charles Tupper: Fighting Doctor to Father of Confederation'' (1998)\n*Robert Page, ''Tupper\u2019s Last Hurrah: The Years as Opposition Leader, 1896\u20131900'' in The West and the Nation: Essays in Honour of W.

It was created in 1976 when it took over responsibility for regulating telecommunication carriers. Prior to 1976, it was known as the '''Canadian Radio and Television Commission''', which was established in 1968 by the [[Parliament of Canada]] to replace the [[Board of Broadcast Governors]]. Its headquarters is located in the Central Building (\u00c9difice central) of Les [[Terrasses de la Chaudi\u00e8re]] in [[Gatineau]], [[Quebec]].<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/contact.htm Contact Us].\" Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.

In 1976, jurisdiction over telecommunications services, most of which were then delivered by monopoly common carriers (for example, telephone companies), was transferred to it from the [[Canadian Transport Commission]] although the abbreviation CRTC remained the same.\n\nOn the telecom side, the CRTC originally regulated only privately held common carriers:\n* [[BC Tel]] (merged with [[Telus]]), which served [[British Columbia]], in which a U.S. company ([[GTE]]) held a substantial stake\n* [[Bell Canada]], which served much of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], and the eastern part of the [[Northwest Territories]] (now [[Nunavut]])\n* telephone operations owned by crown corporation [[Canadian National Railways]] in [[Newfoundland]] ([[Terra Nova Tel]]), the Northwest Territories, [[Yukon]] and northern B.C. (the latter three being [[Northwestel]]).\n\nOther telephone companies, many of which were publicly owned and entirely within a province's borders, were regulated by provincial authorities until court rulings during the 1990s affirmed federal jurisdiction over the sector, which also included some fifty small independent incumbents, most of them in Ontario and Quebec. Notable in this group were:\n\n* [[NewTel Communications|Newfoundland Telephone]]\n* [[Maritime Telegraph and Telephone Company|Maritime Telegraph and Telephone]]\n* [[Island Telephone Company|Island Telephone]] (Island Tel)\n* [[NBTel|New Brunswick Telephone]] (NBTel)\n* [[Bell MTS|Manitoba Telephone System]] (MTS)\n* [[SaskTel]]\n* [[Alberta Government Telephones]] (AGT)\n* [[NorthernTel|Northern Telephone]] (Ontario)\n* [[T\u00e9l\u00e9bec]]\n* municipal telephone services in Prince Rupert, B.C. ([[CityWest]]) and Thunder Bay ([[Tbaytel]])\n\n==Jurisdiction==\nThe CRTC regulates all [[Canada|Canadian]] broadcasting and telecommunications activities and enforces rules it creates to carry out the policies assigned to it; the best-known of these is probably the [[Canadian content]] rules. The CRTC reports to the [[Parliament of Canada]] through the [[Minister of Canadian Heritage]], which is responsible for the Broadcasting Act, and has an informal relationship with [[Industry Canada]], which is responsible for the Telecommunications Act. Provisions in these two acts, along with less-formal instructions issued by the [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]] known as [[Order in Council|orders-in-council]], represent the bulk of the CRTC's jurisdiction.\n\nIn many cases, such as the cabinet-directed prohibition on foreign ownership for broadcasters<ref>[http://canlii.ca/t/80ml Direction to the CRTC (Ineligibility of Non-Canadians)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709031814/http://canlii.ca/t/80ml |date=2012-07-09 }} ([[CanLII]])</ref> and the legislated principle of the predominance of Canadian content,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/B-9.01/bo-ga:l_I-gb:s_3//en#anchorbo-ga:l_I-gb:s_3 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605050143/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/B-9.01/bo-ga%3Al_I-gb%3As_3//en#anchorbo-ga:l_I-gb:s_3 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-06-05 |title=Broadcasting Act at 3.(1)(f) |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26 |df= }}</ref> these acts and orders often leave the CRTC less room to change policy than critics sometimes suggest, and the result is that the commission is often the lightning rod for policy criticism that could arguably be better directed at the government itself.\n\nComplaints against broadcasters, such as concerns around offensive programming, are dealt with by the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC), an independent broadcast industry association, rather than by the CRTC, although CBSC decisions can be appealed to the CRTC if necessary. However, the CRTC is also sometimes erroneously criticized for CBSC decisions \u2014 for example, the CRTC was erroneously criticized for the CBSC's decisions pertaining to the airing of [[Howard Stern]]'s terrestrial radio show in Canada in the late 1990s, as well as the CBSC's controversial ruling on the [[Dire Straits]] song \"[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]\".<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/music/crtc-asks-for-review-of-controversial-money-for-nothing-decision/article1878524/ \"CRTC asks for review of controversial \u2018Money for Nothing\u2019 decision\"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', January 21, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe commission is not fully equivalent to the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]], which has additional powers over technical matters, in broadcasting and other aspects of communications, in that country. In Canada, [[Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada]] (formerly Industry Canada) is responsible for allocating frequencies and call signs, managing the broadcast spectrum, and regulating other technical issues such as interference with electronics equipment.\n\n===Regulation of broadcast distributors===\nThe CRTC has in the past regulated the prices [[cable television]] broadcast distributors are allowed to charge. In most major markets, however, prices are no longer regulated due to increased competition for broadcast distribution from [[satellite television]].\n\nThe CRTC also regulates which channels broadcast distributors must or may offer. Per the Broadcasting Act<ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/B-9.01/8815.html Department of Justice, Laws of Canada] (at \u00a73.(1)(t)(i))</ref> the commission also gives priority to Canadian signals\u2014many non-Canadian channels which compete with Canadian channels are thus not approved for distribution in Canada. The CRTC argues that allowing free trade in television stations would overwhelm the smaller Canadian market, preventing it from upholding its responsibility to foster a national conversation. Some people, however, consider this tantamount to [[censorship]].\n\nThe CRTC's [[simultaneous substitution]] rules require that when a Canadian network licences a television show from a [[United States|US]] network and shows it in the same time slot, upon request by the Canadian broadcaster, Canadian broadcast distributors must replace the show on the US channel with the broadcast of the Canadian channel, along with any overlays and commercials. As ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' is on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], but is carried in Canada on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] at the same time, for instance, the cable, satellite, or other broadcast distributor must send the CTV feed over the signal of the carried ABC affiliate, even where the ABC version is somehow different, particularly commercials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/Eng/INFO_SHT/Bdt10.htm |title=Signal substitution \u2013 same program, different commercials CRTC |publisher=Crtc.gc.ca |date=2010-01-18 |accessdate=2011-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225172410/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/info_sht/bdt10.htm |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }}</ref> (These rules are not intended to apply in case of differing ''episodes'' of the same series; this difference may not always be communicated to distributors, although this is rather rare.) Viewers via home [[television antenna|antenna]] who receive both American and Canadian networks on their personal sets are not affected by sim-sub.\n\nThe goal of this policy is to create a market in which Canadian networks can realize revenue through advertising sales in spite of their inability to match the rates that the much larger American networks can afford to pay for syndicated programming. This policy is also why Canadian viewers do not see [[Super Bowl advertising|American advertisements]] during the [[Super Bowl]], even when tuning into one of the many American networks carried on Canadian televisions.\n\nThe CRTC also regulates radio in Canada, including [[Community radio in Canada|community radio]], where the CRTC requires that at least 15% of each station's output must be locally-produced spoken work content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2010/2010-499.htm|title=Campus and community radio policy - CRTC's 2010 revised policy for campus and community radio stations|last=(CRTC)|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|website=www.crtc.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}</ref>\n\n===Regulation of the Internet===\nIn a major May 1999 decision on \"New Media\", the CRTC held that under the Broadcasting Act the CRTC had jurisdiction over certain content communicated over the Internet including audio and video, but excluding content that is primarily alphanumeric such as emails and most webpages. It also issued an exemption order committing to a policy of non-interference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1999/PB99-197.htm |title=Public Notice CRTC 1999-197 |publisher=Crtc.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, in response to the increase presence of [[Over-the-Top]] (OTT) programming, the CRTC put a call out to the public to provide input on the impact OTT programming is having on Canadian content and existing broadcasting subscriptions through satellite and cable.<ref>{{cite web | title=Broadcasting and Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2011-344 | url= http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2011/2011-344.htm |  publisher=Crtc.gc.ca |date = 2011-05-25|accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref> On October 5, 2011 the CRTC released their findings that included consultations with stakeholders from the telecommunications industry, media producers, and cultural leaders among others.  The evidence was inconclusive, suggesting that an increased availability of OTT options is not having a negative impact on the availability or diversity of Canadian content, one of the key policy mandates of the CRTC, nor are there signs that there has been a significant decline of televisions subscriptions through cable or satellite.  However, given the rapid progress in the industry they are working on a more in depth study to be concluded in May 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/rp1110.htm| title=Results of the fact-finding exercise on the over-the-top programming services October 2011 | publisher=Crtc.gc.ca |date = 2011-10-05|accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref>\n\nThe CRTC does not ''directly'' regulate rates, quality of service issues, or business practices for Internet service providers. However, the CRTC does continually monitor the sector and associated trends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/info_sht/t1003.htm |title=Internet |publisher=CRTC |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref>\n\n[[Third Party ISP Access]] refers to a ruling forcing [[Cable television|Cable operators]] (MSO) to offer Internet access to third party resellers.\n\n===Regulation of telephone service===\nThe commission currently has some jurisdiction over the provision of local landline [[telephone]] service in Canada. This is largely limited to the major incumbent carriers, such as [[Bell Canada]] and [[Telus]], for traditional landline service (but not [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP)). It has begun the gradual deregulation of such services where, in the commission's opinion, a sufficient level of competition exists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/com100/2006/r060406.htm|publisher=CRTC.gc.ca|title=CRTC sets criteria for the deregulation of local telephone service|date=2004-04-06|accessdate=2011-10-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120731084146/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/com100/2006/r060406.htm|archivedate=2012-07-31|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe CRTC is sometimes blamed for the current state of the [[mobile phone]] industry in Canada, in which there are only three national mobile network operators \u2013 [[Bell Mobility]], [[Telus Mobility]], and [[Rogers Wireless]] \u2013 as well as a handful of [[MVNO]]s operating on these networks. In fact, the commission has very little to do with the regulation of mobile phone service, outside of \"undue preference\" issues (for example, a carrier offering a superior rate or service to some subscribers and not others without a good reason). It does not regulate service rates, service quality, or other business practices, and commission approval is not necessary for wireless provider sales or mergers as in the broadcasting industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/INFO_SHT/t1021.htm |title=Cellular (wireless) telephone services |publisher=Crtc.gc.ca |date=2009-09-18 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref> Moreover, it does not deal with the availability of spectrum for mobile phone service, which is part of the [[Industry Canada]] mandate, nor the maintenance of competition, which is largely the responsibility of [[The Competition Bureau]].\n\n===Transfers of ownership/foreign ownership===\nAny transfer of more than 30% of the ownership of a broadcasting licence (including cable/satellite distribution licences) requires advance approval of the commission. One condition normally taken into account in such a decision is the level of foreign ownership; federal regulations require that Canadian citizens ultimately own a majority of a broadcast license. Usually this takes the form of a public process, where interested parties can express their concerns and sometimes including a public hearing, followed by a commission decision.\n\nWhile landline and mobile telephone providers must also be majority-owned by Canadians under the federal [[Telecommunications Act (Canada)|Telecommunications Act]], the CRTC is not responsible for enforcement of this provision. In fact, the commission does not require licences at all for telephone companies, and CRTC approval is therefore not generally required for the sale of a telephone company, unless said company also owns a broadcast licence.\n\n==Controversial decisions==\n{{Weasel|date=August 2009}}\n\nSince 1987, the CRTC has been involved in several controversial decisions:\n* '''[[Milestone Radio]]''': In two separate rounds of license hearings in the 1990s, the CRTC rejected applications by Milestone Radio to launch a radio station in [[Toronto]] which would have been Canada's first [[urban music]] station; in both cases, the CRTC instead granted licenses to stations that duplicated formats already offered by other stations in the Toronto market. The decision has been widely cited as one of the single most significant reasons why [[Canadian hip hop]] had difficulty establishing its commercial viability throughout the 1990s.<ref name=urban>{{cite encyclopedia |first1=Errol |last1=Nazareth |first2=Francesca |last2=D'Amico |date=March 4, 2015 |title=Urban Music |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |publisher=[[Historica Canada]] |edition=online |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/urban-music-emc/ |access-date=September 21, 2015}}</ref> The CRTC finally granted a license to Milestone in 2000, after a cabinet order-in-council directed the commission to license two new radio stations that reflected the cultural diversity of the Toronto market, and [[CFXJ-FM]] launched in 2001.<ref name=urban />\n* '''[[CHOI-FM]]''': The CRTC announced it would not renew the licence of the popular [[CHOI-FM]] radio station in [[Quebec City]], after having previously sanctioned the station for failing to uphold its promise of performance and then, during the years following, receiving about 50 complaints about offensive behaviour by radio jockeys which similarly contravened CRTC rules on broadcast hate speech. Many thousands of the station's fans marched in the streets and on [[Parliament Hill]] against the decision, and the parent company of CHOI, Genex Corp., appealed the CRTC decision unsuccessfully to the Federal Court of Canada. The station was later sold to [[RNC Media]], but instead of renewing its license the CRTC issued RNC a license to launch a ''new'' radio station on the same frequency.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n* '''[[CBC Newsworld]]''': The CRTC licensed the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] on November 30, 1987 to provide a national [[all-news]] television network. Its competitor applicant, [[Alberta]]-based [[Allarcom]], appealed this decision to the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. It was overturned and there were questions of whether federal politicians should meddle in CRTC decisions. Because of this the network launch was delayed from September 1, 1988 to July 31, 1989.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n* '''[[RAI International]]''': In Summer 2004, this [[Italy|Italian]] government controlled channel was denied permission to broadcast independently in Canada on the grounds that it had acted and was likely to act contrary to established Canadian policies. RAI International's latest politically appointed President (an avowed right wing nationalist and former spokesperson for Giorgio Almirante, the leader of the post-fascist party of Italy) had unilaterally terminated a 20-year-old agreement and stripped all of its 1,500 to 2,000 annual hours of programming from [[Telelatino]] (TLN), a Canadian-run channel which had devoted 95% of its prime time schedule to RAI programs for 20 years since TLN was founded. All Italian-Canadians were denied RAI programming by RAI International's removal of its programming from the Canadian marketplace, a move intended to create a public outcry and a threat that Canadians would resort to using [[satellite television|satellite]] viewing cards obtained via the US in order to watch RAI, even though these cards were either [[grey market]] or [[black market]], according to different analyses (see below). Following unprecedented foreign led and domestic political interference with the CRTC's quasi-judicial independent regulatory process, within 6 months of its original decision, an abrupt CRTC \"review\" of its policy on third-language foreign services determined to drop virtually all restrictions and adopt a new \"open entry\" approach to foreign controlled \"third language\" (non-English, non-French) channels.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n* '''[[Al Jazeera]]''': Was approved by the CRTC in 2004 as an optional cable and satellite offering, but on the condition that any carrier distributing it must edit out any instances of illegal hate speech. Cable companies declared that these restrictions would make it too expensive to carry Al Jazeera. Although no cable company released data as to what such a monitoring service would cost, the end-result was that no cable company elected to carry the station, either, leaving many Arabic-speaking Canadians using [[free-to-air]] satellite dishes to watch the station. The [[Canadian Jewish Congress]] has expressed its opinion over possible [[anti-Semitic]] incitement on this station and that the restrictions on Al Jazeera are appropriate, while the Canadian [[B'nai Brith]] is opposed to any approval of Al Jazeera in Canada. The CRTC ruling applied to Al Jazeera and not to its English-speaking sister network [[Al Jazeera English]], which was launched two years after the ruling.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n* '''[[Fox News Channel]]''': Until 2004, the CRTC's apparent reluctance to grant a digital license to Fox News Channel under the same policy which made it difficult for RAI to enter the country \u2013 same-genre competition from foreign services \u2013 had angered many [[Canadian conservatism|conservative]] Canadians, who believed the network was deliberately being kept out due to its perceived [[conservative bias]], particularly given the long-standing availability of services such as [[CNN]] and [[BBC World]] in Canada. On November 18, 2004, however, the CRTC approved an application by cable companies to offer Fox News Channel on the [[digital cable]] tier. Fox commenced broadcasting in Canada shortly thereafter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n* '''[[Satellite radio]]''': In June 2005, the CRTC outraged some Canadian cultural nationalists (such as the [[Friends of Canadian Broadcasting]]) and [[labour union]]s by licensing two companies, [[Canadian Satellite Radio]] and [[Sirius Canada]] to offer satellite radio services in Canada. The two companies are in partnership with [[United States|American]] firms [[XM Satellite Radio]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] respectively, and in accordance with the CRTC decision will only need to offer ten percent Canadian content. The CRTC contends that this low level of Canadian content, particularly when compared to the 35% rule on local radio stations, was necessary because unlicensed U.S. receivers were already flooding into the country, so that enforcing a ban on these receivers would be nearly impossible (see below). This explanation did not satisfy cultural nationalists, who demanded that the [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]] overturn the decision and mandate a minimum of 35% Canadian content. Supporters of the decision argue that satellite radio can only be feasibly set up as a continental system, and trying to impose 35% Canadian content across North America is quite unrealistic. They also argue that satellite radio will boost Canadian culture by giving vital exposure to independent artists, instead of concentrating just on the country's stars, and point to the CRTC's successful extraction of promises to program 10% Canadian content on satellite services already operational in the United States as important concessions.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/cpress/20050627/ca_pr_on_en/satellite_radio_3 Satellite radio \u2013 Yahoo News] June 27, 2005  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305201757/http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story |date=March 5, 2005 }}</ref> Despite popular perception that the CRTC banned [[Sirius Canada]] from broadcasting [[Howard Stern]]'s program, this is not the case. Sirius Canada in fact initially ''chose'' not to air Stern based on the ''possibility'' of a future issue with the CRTC, although the company reversed its decision and began offering Howard Stern in 2006.\n* '''2008 Ottawa radio licences''': On November 21, 2008, federal Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages [[James Moore (Canadian politician)|James Moore]] issued a statement calling on the CRTC to review its approval of two new radio stations, Frank Torres' [[CIDG-FM]] and [[Astral Media]]'s [[CJOT-FM]], which it had licensed in August 2008 to serve the [[Ottawa]]-[[Gatineau]] radio market. Moore asked the commission to assess whether the [[wikt:francophone|francophone]] population of the Ottawa-Gatineau area was sufficiently well-served by existing French radio services, and to consider licensing one or more of the French language applications, which included a [[Christian music]] station, a [[community radio]] station and a [[campus radio]] station for the [[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec en Outaouais]], in addition to or instead of the approved stations.<ref>{{cite press release |title=The Government of Canada Refers Decisions on Radio in the Ottawa-Gatineau Region Back to CRTC|url=http://nouvelles.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?crtr.sj1D=&mthd=advSrch&crtr.mnthndVl=&nid=424669&crtr.dpt1D=&crtr.tp1D=&crtr.lc1D=&crtr.yrStrtVl=2008&crtr.kw=&crtr.dyStrtVl=26&crtr.aud1D=&crtr.mnthStrtVl=2&crtr.yrndVl=&crtr.dyndVl= |publisher=Government of Canada |date=November 21, 2008 |access-date=September 21, 2015}}</ref> The review ultimately identified a viable frequency for a third station, and [[CJFO-FM]] launched in 2010.\n* '''[[Internet in Canada#Usage-based billing (UBB)|Bell Canada usage-based billing]]:''' On October 28, 2010, the CRTC handed down its final decision on how wholesale customers can be billed by large network owners. Under the plan which starts within 90 days, [[Bell Canada|Bell]] will be able to charge wholesale service providers a flat monthly fee to connect to its network, and for a set monthly usage limit per each ISP customer the ISP has. Beyond that set limit, individual users will be charged per gigabyte, depending on the speed of their connections. Customers using the fastest connections of five megabits per second, for example, will have a monthly allotment of 60 GB, beyond which Bell will charge $1.12 per GB to a maximum of $22.50. If a customer uses more than 300 GB a month, Bell will also be able to implement an additional charge of 75 cents per gigabyte. In May 2010, the CRTC ruled that Bell could not implement its usage-based billing system until all of its own retail customers had been moved off older, unlimited downloading plans. The requirement would have meant that Bell would have to move its oldest and most loyal customers. The CRTC also added that Bell would be required to offer to wholesale ISPs the same usage insurance plan it sells to retail customers. Bell appealed both requirements, citing that the rules do not apply to cable companies and that they constituted proactive rate regulation by the CRTC, which goes against government official policy direction that the regulator only intervene in markets after a competitive problem has been proven. In Thursday's decision, the CRTC rescinded both requirements, thereby giving Bell the go-ahead to implement usage-based billing. This ruling according to Teksavvy handcuffs the competitive market.<ref>{{cite news|first=Iain |last=Marlow |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/globe-on-technology/crtc-ruling-handcuffs-competitive-market-teksavvy/article1778211/ |title=CRTC ruling handcuffs competitive market: Teksavvy |work=Globe and Mail |date=October 29, 2010 |access-date=September 21, 2015}}</ref> This has been asked by Stephen Harper and Parliament to have the decision reviewed. According to a [[Twitter|tweet]] by Industry Minister [[Tony Clement]], unless the CRTC reverses this decision, the government will use its override power to reverse the decision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tektok.ca/2011/02/crtc-decision-to-be-overruled-tony-clement-via-twitter/ |title=CRTC Decision to be overruled: Tony Clement via Twitter |website=Tek Tok Canada |date=2011-02-02 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref>\n\n==Reception of non-Canadian services==\nWhile an exact number has not been determined, thousands of Canadians have purchased and used what they contend to be [[grey market]] radio and television services, licensed in the [[United States]] but not in Canada. Users of these unlicensed services contend that they are not directly breaking any laws by simply using the equipment. The equipment is usually purchased from an [[United States|American]] supplier (although some merchants have attempted to set up shop in Canada) and the services are billed to an American postal address. The advent of [[online billing]] and the easy availability of [[credit card]] services has made it relatively easy for almost anyone to maintain an account in good standing, regardless of where they actually live.\n\nSec. 9(1)(c) of the Radiocommunication Act creates a prohibition against all decoding of encrypted programming signals, followed by an exception where authorization is received from the person holding the lawful right in Canada to transmit and authorize decoding of the signal. This means receiving the encrypted programming of DishNetwork or DirecTV, even with a grey market subscription, may be construed as unlawful (this remains an unresolved Constitutional issue).\n\nNotwithstanding, possession of DishNetwork or DirecTV equipment is not unlawful as provided by The Radiocommuncation Act Section 4(1)(b), which states:\n\n\"No person shall, except under and in accordance with a radio authorization, install, operate or possess radio apparatus, other than (b)a radio apparatus that is capable only of the reception of broadcasting and that is not a distribution undertaking. (radio apparatus\" means a device or combination of devices intended for, or capable of being used for, radiocommunication).\"\n\nSatellite radio poses a more complicated problem for the CRTC. While an unlicensed satellite dish can often be identified easily, satellite radio receivers are much more compact and can rarely be easily identified, at least not without flagrantly violating provisions against unreasonable [[search and seizure]] in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. Some observers argued that this influenced the CRTC's June 2005 decision to ease Canadian content restrictions on satellite radio (see above).\n\n==Structure==\nThe CRTC is run by up to 13 full-time (including the chairman, the vice-chairman of broadcasting, and the vice-chairman of telecommunications) appointed by the Cabinet for renewable terms of up to five years. However, unlike the more directly political appointees of the American [[Federal Communications Commission]], the CRTC is an arms-length regulatory body with more autonomous authority over telecommunications. For example, the CRTC's decisions rely more on a more judiciary process relying on evidence submitted during public consultations, rather than along party lines as the American FCC is prone to do.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/us-canada-net-neutrality-party-politics-fcc-crtc-fight-1.4447558|title=Why Canada's net neutrality fight hasn't been as fierce as the one in the U.S.|last1=Braga|first1=Matthew|date=14 December 2017|accessdate=15 December 2017|publisher=CBC|agency=CBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe CRTC Interconnection Steering Committee (CISC) assists in developing information, procedures and guidelines for the CRTC's regulatory activities.\n\n==Chairs of the CRTC==\n*1968\u20131975 - [[Pierre Juneau]]\n*1975\u20131977 - [[Harry J.
