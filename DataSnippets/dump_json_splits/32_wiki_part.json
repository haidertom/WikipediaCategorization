Simple [[commodity]] exchange and consequently simple commodity production, which are the initial basis for the growth of capital from trade, have a very long history.

That required a set of conditions, including specific technologies of mass production, the ability to independently and privately own and trade in means of production, a class of workers willing to sell their [[labour power]] for a living, a [[legal]] framework promoting commerce, a physical infrastructure allowing the circulation of goods on a large scale and security for private accumulation. Many of these conditions do not currently exist in many [[Third World]] countries, although there is plenty of capital and labour. The obstacles for the development of capitalist markets are therefore less technical and more social, cultural and political.\n\n=== Agrarian capitalism ===\nThe economic foundations of the feudal agricultural system began to shift substantially in 16th-century England as the [[manorial system]] had broken down and land began to become concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates. Instead of a [[serf]]-based system of labor, workers were increasingly employed as part of a broader and expanding money-based economy. The system put pressure on both landlords and tenants to increase the productivity of agriculture to make profit; the weakened coercive power of the [[aristocracy]] to extract peasant [[Excess supply|surpluses]] encouraged them to try better methods; and the tenants also had incentive to improve their methods in order to flourish in a competitive [[labour economics|labor market]]. Terms of rent for land were becoming subject to economic market forces rather than to the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brenner|first1=Robert|title=The Agrarian Roots of European Capitalism|journal=Past & Present|date=1 January 1982|issue=97|pages=16\u2013113|jstor=650630}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://monthlyreview.org/1998/07/01/the-agrarian-origins-of-capitalism|title= The Agrarian Origins of Capitalism|accessdate= 17 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 17th century, England was a centralized state in which much of the feudal order of [[Medieval Europe]] had been swept away. This centralization was strengthened by a good system of roads and by a disproportionately large capital city, [[London]]. The capital acted as a central market hub for the entire country, creating a very large internal market for goods, contrasting with the fragmented feudal holdings that prevailed in most parts of the [[Continental Europe|Continent]].\n\n=== Mercantilism ===\n{{Main|Mercantilism}}\n[[File:Lorrain.seaport.jpg|left|thumb|A painting of a French seaport from 1638 at the height of [[mercantilism]]]]\nThe economic doctrine prevailing from the 16th to the 18th centuries is commonly called [[mercantilism]].<ref name=GSGB /><ref name=\"Burnham\">{{cite book |author=Burnham, Peter|title=Capitalism: The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003}}</ref> This period, the [[Age of Discovery]], was associated with the geographic exploration of the foreign lands by merchant traders, especially from England and the [[Low Countries]].

Moderate critics have recently challenged this, stating that the current influence lobbying groups have had on policy in the United States is a contradiction, given the approval of [[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United]]. This has led people to question the idea that competitive capitalism promotes political freedom. The ruling on Citizens United allows corporations to spend undisclosed and unregulated amounts of money on political campaigns, shifting outcomes to the interests and undermining true democracy. As explained in [[Robin Hahnel]]\u2019s writings, the centerpiece of the ideological defense of the free market system is the concept of economic freedom and that supporters equate economic democracy with economic freedom and claim that only the free market system can provide economic freedom. According to Hahnel, there are a few objections to the premise that capitalism offers freedom through economic freedom. These objections are guided by critical questions about who or what decides whose freedoms are more protected. Often, the question of inequality is brought up when discussing how well capitalism promotes democracy. An argument that could stand is that economic growth can lead to inequality given that capital can be acquired at different rates by different people. In ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'', [[Thomas Piketty]] of the [[Paris School of Economics]] asserts that inequality is the inevitable consequence of economic growth in a capitalist economy and the resulting [[Wealth concentration|concentration of wealth]] can destabilize democratic societies and undermine the ideals of social justice upon which they are built.<ref>[[Thomas Piketty|Piketty, Thomas]] (2014).

Hall and [[David Soskice]] argued that modern economies have developed two different forms of capitalism: liberal market economies (or LME) (e.g. the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Ireland) and coordinated market economies (CME) (e.g. Germany, Japan, Sweden and Austria). Those two types can be distinguished by the primary way in which firms coordinate with each other and other actors, such as [[trade unions]]. In LMEs, firms primarily coordinate their endeavors by way of hierarchies and market mechanisms. Coordinated market economies more heavily rely on non-market forms of interaction in the coordination of their relationship with other actors (for a detailed description see ''[[Varieties of Capitalism]]''). These two forms of capitalisms developed different [[industrial relations]], [[vocational training]] and [[education]], [[corporate governance]], inter-firm relations and relations with employees. The existence of these different forms of capitalism has important societal effects, especially in periods of crisis and instability. Since the early 2000s, the number of labor market outsiders has rapidly grown in Europe, especially among the youth, potentially influencing social and political participation. Using varieties of capitalism theory, it is possible to disentangle the different effects on social and political participation that an increase of labor market outsiders has in liberal and coordinated market economies (Ferragina et al., 2016).<ref>Emanuele Ferragina et al.(2016). \"Outsiderness and participation in liberal market economies.\" PACO ''The Open Journal of Sociopolitical Studies'', 9, 986\u20131014  https://scholar.google.fr/scholar_url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsiba-ese.unisalento.it%2Findex.php%2Fpaco%2Farticle%2Fdownload%2F16664%2F14327&hl=fr&sa=T&scisig=AAGBfm3_dOCLibWFNHNtG62FKywcq7PxNA&nossl=1&ws=1920x909</ref> The social and political disaffection, especially among the youth, seems to be more pronounced in liberal than coordinated market economies. This signals an important problem for liberal market economies in a period of crisis. If the market does not provide consistent job opportunities (as it has in previous decades), the shortcomings of liberal social security systems may depress social and political participation even further than in other capitalist economies.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n{{Further|Academic perspectives on capitalism}}\nIn general, capitalism as an economic system and mode of production can be summarised by the following:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft3n39n8x3&chunk.id=d0e1212&toc.id=&brand=ucpress|title=Althusser and the Renewal of Marxist Social Theory|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[Capital accumulation]]:<ref name=ch32>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch32.htm|title=Economic Manuscripts: Capital Vol. I \u2013 Chapter Thirty Two|first=Karl|last=Marx|publisher=}}</ref> production for profit and accumulation as the implicit purpose of all or most of production, constriction or elimination of production formerly carried out on a common social or private household basis.<ref name=xxx31 />\n* [[Production (economics)|Commodity production]]: production for exchange on a market; to maximize [[exchange-value]] instead of [[use-value]].\n* [[Private ownership]] of the means of production:<ref name=\"Modern Economics 1986, p. 54\"/>\n* High levels of [[wage labour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lmac/self-employed-workers-in-the-uk/2014/rep-self-employed-workers-in-the-uk-2014.html#tab-Self-employed-workers-in-the-UK---2014|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT] UK Government Web Archive \u2013 The National Archives|first=Internet Memory|last=Foundation|publisher=}}</ref>\n* The [[investment]] of money to make a profit.<ref>James Fulcher, ''Capitalism A Very Short Introduction'', \"the investment of money in order to make a profit, the essential feature of capitalism\", p. 14, Oxford, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-19-280218-7}}.</ref>\n* The use of the [[price mechanism]] to allocate resources between competing uses.<ref name=\"Modern Economics 1986, p. 54\"/>\n* Freedom of capitalists to act in their self-interest in managing their business and investments.<ref>{{cite book|title= Capitalism: A complete understanding of the nature and value of human economic life|last=Reisman|first= George|year= 1998|isbn= 0-915463-73-3|publisher =Jameson Books |page=}}</ref>\n\n=== The market ===\n[[File:Supply-and-demand.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The price (P) of a product is determined by a balance between production at each price (supply, S) and the desires of those with [[purchasing power]] at each price (demand, D): this results in a market equilibrium, with a given quantity (Q) sold of the product, whereas a rise in demand would result in an increase in price and an increase in output]]\nIn free market and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' forms of capitalism, markets are used most extensively with minimal or no regulation over the pricing mechanism. In mixed economies, which are almost universal today,<ref>James Fulcher, ''Capitalism A Very Short Introduction'', \"...in the wake of the 1970 crisis, the neo-liberal model of capitalism became intellectually and ideologically dominant\", p. 58, Oxford, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-19-280218-7}}.</ref> markets continue to play a dominant role, but they are regulated to some extent by government in order to correct [[market failure]]s, promote [[social welfare]], conserve [[natural resource]]s, fund [[military|defense]] and [[public safety]] or for other reasons. In [[State capitalism|state capitalist]] systems, markets are relied upon the least, with the state relying heavily on [[state-owned enterprises]] or indirect economic planning to accumulate capital.\n\nSupply is the amount of a good or service produced by a firm and which is available for sale. Demand is the amount that people are willing to buy at a specific price. Prices tend to rise when demand exceeds supply and fall when supply exceeds demand. In theory, the market is able to coordinate itself when a new equilibrium price and quantity is reached.\n\nCompetition arises when more than one producer is trying to sell the same or similar products to the same buyers. In capitalist theory, competition leads to innovation and more affordable prices. Without competition, a [[monopoly]] or [[cartel]] may develop. A monopoly occurs when a firm supplies the total output in the market, hence the firm can engage in [[rent seeking]] behaviors such as limiting output and raising prices because it has no fear of competition. A cartel is a group of firms that act together in a monopolistic manner to control output and prices.\n\nEfforts are made by government to prevent the creation of monopolies and cartels. In 1890, the Sherman Anti-Trust Act became the first legislation passed by the United States Congress to limit monopolies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopoly.asp|title=Monopoly|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=24 November 2003|work=Investopedia|access-date=2 March 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Profit motive ===\nThe [[profit motive]] is a theory in capitalism which posits that the ultimate goal of a business is to make money. Stated differently, the reason for a business's existence is to turn a profit. The profit motive functions on the [[rational choice theory]], or the theory that individuals tend to pursue what is in their own best interests. Accordingly, businesses seek to benefit themselves and/or their shareholders by maximizing profits.\n\nIn capitalist theoretics, the profit motive is said to ensure that resources are being allocated efficiently. For instance, [[Austrian economist]] [[Henry Hazlitt]] explains: \"If there is no profit in making an article, it is a sign that the labor and capital devoted to its production are misdirected: the value of the resources that must be used up in making the article is greater than the value of the article itself\".<ref>Hazlitt, Henry. \"The Function of Profits\". ''Economics in One Lesson''. Ludwig Von Mises Institute. Web. 22 April 2013.</ref> In other words, profits let companies know whether an item is worth producing. Theoretically, in free and competitive markets maximising profits ensures that resources are not wasted.\n\n=== Private property ===\nThe relationship between the [[state (polity)|state]], its formal mechanisms and capitalist societies has been debated in many fields of social and political theory, with active discussion since the 19th century. [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] is a contemporary Peruvian economist who has argued that an important characteristic of capitalism is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system where ownership and transactions are clearly recorded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/03/desoto.htm |title=The mystery of capital|author=Hernando de Soto|accessdate=26 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nAccording to de Soto, this is the process by which physical assets are transformed into capital, which in turn may be used in many more ways and much more efficiently in the market economy. A number of Marxian economists have argued that the [[Enclosure Acts]] in England and similar legislation elsewhere were an integral part of capitalist [[primitive accumulation]] and that specific legal frameworks of private land ownership have been integral to the development of capitalism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch27.htm |title=Capital, v. 1.

The use of the word \"army\" refers to the workers being conscripted and regimented in the workplace in a [[hierarchy]], under the [[commanding heights of the economy]].\n\nPrior to the start of the capitalist era in human history (i.e. before the 1500s), [[structural unemployment]] on a mass scale rarely existed, other than that caused by natural disasters and wars.<ref>{{cite book |first=John A. |last=Garraty |title=Unemployment in History: Economic Thought and Public Policy |location=New York |publisher=Harper and Row |year=1978 |isbn=0-06-011457-6 }}, chapter 2.</ref> In ancient societies, all people who could work necessarily had to work, otherwise they would starve; and therefore a slave or a serf by definition could not become \"unemployed\". There was normally very little possibility of \"earning a crust\" without working at all and the usual attitude toward beggars and idlers was harsh.<ref>Garraty, p. 14.</ref> Children began to work already at a very early age. Indeed, the word \"employment\" is linguistically a product of the capitalist era. A permanent level of unemployment presupposes a working population which is to a large extent dependent on a wage or salary for a living, without having other means of livelihood as well as the right of enterprises to hire and fire employees in accordance with commercial or economic conditions. The expression \"unemployed\" in English in the sense of \"temporarily out of work\" dates back to the 1660s; reference to \"the unemployed\" as a group was first made in 1782; and reference to \"unemployment\" as a general condition is first attested in 1888.<ref>''Online Etymological Dictionary'', entry \"unemployed\".</ref>\n\nThe first recorded discussion of the reserve army of labour is in a manuscript written by [[Karl Marx]]: {{Quotation|Big industry constantly requires a reserve army of unemployed workers for times of [[overproduction]]. The main purpose of the bourgeois in relation to the worker is, of course, to have the commodity labour as cheaply as possible, which is only possible when the supply of this commodity is as large as possible in relation to the demand for it, i.e., when the overpopulation is the greatest. Overpopulation is therefore in the interest of the bourgeoisie, and it gives the workers good advice which it knows to be impossible to carry out. Since capital only increases when it employs workers, the increase of capital involves an increase of the proletariat, and, as we have seen, according to the nature of the relation of capital and labour, the increase of the proletariat must proceed relatively even faster. The... theory... which is also expressed as a law of nature, that population grows faster than the means of subsistence, is the more welcome to the bourgeois as it silences his conscience, makes hard-heartedness into a moral duty and the consequences of society into the consequences of nature, and finally gives him the opportunity to watch the destruction of the proletariat by starvation as calmly as other natural event without bestirring himself, and, on the other hand, to regard the misery of the proletariat as its own fault and to punish it. To be sure, the proletarian can restrain his natural instinct by reason, and so, by moral supervision, halt the law of nature in its injurious course of development. \u2014 Karl Marx, ''[[Wage Labour and Capital|Wages]]'', December 1847<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/12/31.htm \u201cWages\u201d], Works of Karl Marx 1847; source: MECW {{clarify|date=April 2016}} Volume 6, p. 415; written: at the end of December 1847; first published: in Russian in the journal Sotsialisticheskoye khozyaistvo, 1924 and in German in the journal Unter dem Banner des Marxismus {{clarify|reason=1924 and ??|date=April 2016}}, 1925.</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nMarx introduced the concept in chapter 25 of the first volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'',<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm#S2 Karl Marx, ''Das Kapital'', chapter 25]</ref> which states: {{Quotation|Capitalistic accumulation itself... constantly produces, and produces in the direct ratio of its own energy and extent, a relatively redundant population of workers, i.e., a population of greater extent than suffices for the average needs of the [[valorisation]] of capital, and therefore a surplus-population...  It is the absolute interest of every capitalist to press a given quantity of labour out of a smaller, rather than a greater number of labourers, if the cost is about the same... The more extended the scale of production, the stronger this motive. Its force increases with the accumulation of capital.|sign=|source=}}\n\nHis argument is that as capitalism develops, the [[organic composition of capital]] will increase, which means that the mass of [[constant capital]] grows faster than the mass of [[variable capital]]. Fewer workers can produce all that is necessary for society's requirements. In addition, capital will become more concentrated and centralised in fewer hands. This being the absolute historical tendency, part of the working population will tend to become surplus to the requirements of [[capital accumulation]] over time. Paradoxically, the larger the wealth of society, the larger the industrial reserve army will become. Marx called it \"the antagonism of capital accumulation\" and he cites his ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (Chapter 2, Section 1) to explain this phenomenon in relation with [[relations of production]].<ref>''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', Chapter 25</ref> One could add that the larger the wealth of society, the more people it can support who do not work. However, as Marx develops the argument further, it also becomes clear that depending on the state of the economy the reserve army of labour will either expand or contract, alternately being absorbed or expelled from the employed workforce.\n\n{{Quotation|Taking them as a whole, the general movements of [[wages]] are exclusively regulated by the expansion and contraction of the industrial reserve army, and these again correspond to the periodic changes of the industrial cycle. They are, therefore, not determined by the variations of the absolute number of the working population, but by the varying proportions in which the working-class is divided into active and reserve army, by the increase or diminution in the relative amount of the surplus-population, by the extent to which it is now absorbed, now set free.}}\nIn recent years, there has been growing research on the concept of \"the [[precariat]]\" to describe a growing reliance on temporary, part-time workers with precarious status, who share aspects of the proletariat and the reserve army of labor.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Choonara|first=Esme|title=Is there a precariat?|journal=Socialist Review|date=October 2011|url=http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=11781}}</ref> Precarious workers do work part-time or full-time in temporary jobs, but they cannot really earn enough to live on and depend partly on friends or family, or on state benefits, to survive.

Sometimes there is a short-term mismatch between the demand and supply of labour, at other times there is much less total demand for labour than supply for a long-time. If no possibility for getting a job at all in the foreseeable future exists, many younger people decide to migrate or emigrate to a place where they can find work.\n\n==== Composition of the relative surplus population ====\nMarx discusses the army of labor and the reserve army in Capital, Chapter 25, Section IV.  The army of labor consists in those working-class people employed in average or better than average jobs. Not every one in the working class gets one of these jobs. There are then four other categories where members of the working class might find themselves: the \"stagnant pool\", the floating reserves, the latent reserve and pauperdom. Finally, people may leave the army and the reserve army by turning to criminality and Marx refers to such people as \"lumpenproletariat\".<ref>Duggan, Marie Christine (2013) \"Reserve Army of Labor and Migration\" in the ''Encyclopedia of Global Human Migration'', edited by E. Ness, Wiley Publishers. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444351071.wbeghm451/abstract</ref>\n* The stagnant part consists of marginalised people with \"extremely irregular employment\". Stagnant pool jobs are characterized by below average pay, dangerous working conditions, they may be temporary. Those caught in the stagnant pool have jobs, so the modern definition of the employed would include both the army of labor plus the stagnant pool. However, they are constantly on the lookout for something better.\n\nThe modern unemployed would refer primarily to the floating reserve, people who used to have good jobs, but are now out of work. They certainly hope that their unemployment is temporary (\"conjunctural unemployment\"), but they are well aware that they could fall into the stagnant pool or the pauper class.\n* The latent part consists of that segment of the population not yet fully integrated into capitalist production. In Marx' day, he was referring to people living off of subsistence agriculture who were looking for monetary employment in industry. In modern times, people coming from slums in developing countries where they survive largely by non-monetary means to developed cities where they work for pay might form the latent. Housewives who move from unpaid to paid employment for a business could also form a part of the latent reserve. They are not unemployed because they are not necessarily actively looking for a job, but if capital needs extra workers, it can pull them out of the latent reserve. In this sense, the latent forms a reservoir of potential workers for industries.\n* Pauperdom is where one might end up. The homeless is the modern term for paupers. Marx calls them people who cannot adapt to capital's never ending change. For Marx, \"the sphere of pauperism\", including those still able to work, orphans and pauper children; and the \"demoralised and ragged\" or \"unable to work\".\n\n=== As a mode of production ===\n{{Further|Mode of production}}\nThe capitalist mode of production refers to the systems of organising production and distribution within capitalist [[society|societies]]. Private money-making in various forms (renting, banking, merchant trade, production for profit and so on) preceded the development of the capitalist mode of production as such. The capitalist mode of production proper based on wage-labour and private ownership of the means of production and on industrial technology began to grow rapidly in Western Europe from the [[Industrial Revolution]], later extending to most of the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe term capitalist mode of production is defined by [[Private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]], extraction of [[surplus value]] by the owning class for the purpose of [[capital accumulation]], [[Wage labour|wage-based labour]] and at least as far as [[Commodity|commodities]] are concerned being [[Market economy|market-based]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capitalism | title=Capitalism. | publisher=marxists.org | accessdate=8 July 2011 | author=Encyclopedia of Marxism at marxism.org}}</ref>\n\nCapitalism in the form of money-making activity has existed in the shape of merchants and money-lenders who acted as intermediaries between consumers and producers engaging in [[simple commodity production]] (hence the reference to \"[[merchant capitalism]]\") since the beginnings of civilisation. What is specific about the \"capitalist mode of production\" is that most of the inputs and outputs of [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] are supplied through the market (i.e. they are commodities) and essentially all production is in this mode.<ref name=\"Modern Economics 1986, p. 54\" /> For example, in flourishing feudalism most or all of the factors of production including labour are owned by the feudal ruling class outright and the products may also be consumed without a market of any kind, it is production for use within the feudal social unit and for limited trade.<ref name=ch32/> This has the important consequence that the whole organisation of the production process is reshaped and re-organised to conform with economic [[bounded rationality|rationality as bounded]] by capitalism, which is expressed in price relationships between inputs and outputs (wages, non-labour factor costs, sales and profits) rather than the larger rational context faced by society overall\u2014that is, the whole process is organised and re-shaped in order to conform to \"commercial logic\". Essentially, capital accumulation comes to define economic rationality in capitalist production.<ref name=xxx31>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsp.org.au/node/31|title=The contradictions of capitalism \u2013 Democratic Socialist Perspective|publisher=dsp.org.au|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406094810/http://www.dsp.org.au/node/31|archivedate=6 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA society, region or [[nation]] is capitalist if the predominant source of incomes and products being distributed is capitalist activity, but even so this does not yet mean necessarily that the capitalist mode of production is dominant in that society.\n\n== Supply and demand ==\n{{Main|Supply and demand}}\n[[File:Supply-and-demand.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The price P of a product is determined by a balance between production at each price (supply S) and the desires of those with [[purchasing power]] at each price (demand D): the diagram shows a positive shift in demand from D<sub>1</sub> to D<sub>2</sub>, resulting in an increase in price (P) and quantity sold (Q) of the product]]\nIn capitalist economic structures, supply and demand is an [[economic model]] of [[price determination]] in a [[Market (economics)|market]]. It concludes that in a [[perfect competition|competitive market]], the [[unit price]] for a particular [[Good (economics)|good]] will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded by consumers (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied by producers (at the current price), resulting in an [[economic equilibrium]] for price and [[Output (economics)|quantity]].\n\nThe four basic laws of [[Supply (economics)|supply]] and [[demand]] are:<ref name=\"besanko-and-braeutigam-2010\">{{Cite book | last = Besanko | first = David | last2 = Braeutigam | first2 = Ronald | year = 2010 | title = Microeconomics | publisher = Wiley | edition = 4th }}</ref>{{rp|37}}\n# If demand increases (demand curve shifts to the right) and supply remains unchanged, then a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.\n# If demand decreases (demand curve shifts to the left) and supply remains unchanged, then a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.\n# If demand remains unchanged and supply increases (supply curve shifts to the right), then a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.\n# If demand remains unchanged and supply decreases (supply curve shifts to the left), then a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.\n\n=== Graphical representation of supply and demand ===\nAlthough it is normal to regard the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of the price of the goods, the standard graphical representation, usually attributed to [[Alfred Marshall]], has price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, the opposite of the standard convention for the representation of a mathematical function.\n\nSince determinants of supply and demand other than the price of the goods in question are not explicitly represented in the supply-demand diagram, changes in the values of these variables are represented by moving the supply and demand curves (often described as \"shifts\" in the curves). By contrast, responses to changes in the price of the good are represented as movements along unchanged supply and demand curves.\n\n==== Supply schedule ====\nA supply schedule is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied. Under the assumption of [[perfect competition]], supply is determined by [[marginal cost]]. That is: firms will produce additional output while the cost of producing an extra unit of output is less than the price they would receive.\n\nA hike in the cost of raw goods would decrease supply and shifting costs up while a discount would increase supply, shifting costs down and hurting producers as producer surplus decreases.\n\nBy its very nature, conceptualising a supply curve requires the firm to be a perfect competitor (i.e. to have no influence over the market price). This is true because each point on the supply curve is the answer to the question \"If this firm is ''faced with'' this potential price, how much output will it be able to and willing to sell?\". If a firm has market power, its decision of how much output to provide to the market influences the market price, therefore the firm is not \"faced with\" any price and the question becomes less relevant.\n\nEconomists distinguish between the supply curve of an individual firm and between the market supply curve. The market supply curve is obtained by summing the quantities supplied by all suppliers at each potential price, thus in the graph of the supply curve individual firms' supply curves are added horizontally to obtain the market supply curve.\n\nEconomists also distinguish the short-run market supply curve from the long-run market supply curve. In this context, two things are assumed constant by definition of the short run: the availability of one or more fixed inputs (typically [[physical capital]]) and the number of firms in the industry. In the long-run, firms can adjust their holdings of physical capital, enabling them to better adjust their quantity supplied at any given price. Furthermore, in the long-run potential competitors can [[Market entry strategy|enter]] or exit the industry in response to market conditions. For both of these reasons, long-run market supply curves are generally flatter than their short-run counterparts.\n\nThe determinants of supply are:\n# Production costs: how much a goods costs to be produced. Production costs are the cost of the inputs; primarily labor, capital, energy and materials. They depend on the technology used in production and/or technological advances. See [[productivity]].\n# Firms' expectations about future prices.\n# Number of suppliers.\n\n==== Demand schedule ====\nA demand schedule, depicted graphically as the [[demand curve]], represents the amount of some [[Good (economics)|goods]] that buyers are willing and able to purchase at various prices, assuming all determinants of demand other than the price of the good in question, such as income, tastes and preferences, the price of [[substitute good]]s and the price of [[complementary good]]s, remain the same. Following the [[law of demand]], the demand curve is almost always represented as downward-sloping, meaning that as price decreases, consumers will buy more of the good.<ref name=\"axes\">Note that unlike most [[Graph of a function|graphs]], supply & demand curves are plotted with the independent variable (price) on the vertical axis and the dependent variable (quantity supplied or demanded) on the horizontal axis.</ref>\n\nJust like the supply curves reflect [[marginal cost]] curves, demand curves are determined by [[marginal utility]] curves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marginal Utility and Demand|url=http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&c=dsp&k=marginal+utility+and+demand|accessdate=9 February 2007}}</ref> Consumers will be willing to buy a given quantity of a good at a given price, if the marginal utility of additional consumption is equal to the [[opportunity cost]] determined by the price\u2014that is, the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices. The demand schedule is defined as the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a given product in a given frame of time.\n\nWhile the aforementioned demand curve is generally downward-sloping, there may be rare examples of goods that have upward-sloping demand curves. Two different hypothetical types of goods with upward-sloping demand curves are [[Giffen good]]s (an inferior, but [[Staple food|staple]] good) and [[Veblen good]]s (goods made more fashionable by a higher price).\n\nBy its very nature, conceptualising a demand curve requires that the purchaser be a perfect competitor\u2014that is, that the purchaser has no influence over the market price. This is true because each point on the demand curve is the answer to the question \"If this buyer is faced with this potential price, how much of the product will it purchase?\". If a buyer has market power, so its decision of how much to buy influences the market price, then the buyer is not \"faced with\" any price and the question is meaningless.\n\nLike with supply curves, economists distinguish between the demand curve of an individual and the market demand curve. The market demand curve is obtained by summing the quantities demanded by all consumers at each potential price, thus in the graph of the demand curve individuals' demand curves are added horizontally to obtain the market demand curve.\n\nThe determinants of demand are:\n# Income.\n# Tastes and preferences.\n# Prices of related goods and services.\n# Consumers' expectations about future prices and incomes that can be checked.\n# Number of potential consumers.\n\n=== Equilibrium ===\n{{Further|Economic equilibrium}}\nIn the context of supply and demand, economic equilibrium refers to a state where economic forces such as [[supply and demand]] are balanced and in the absence of external influences the ([[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]]) values of economic variables will not change. For example, in the standard text-book model of [[perfect competition]] equilibrium occurs at the point at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Hal Varian |first=Hal R. |last=Varian |title=Microeconomic Analysis |edition=Third |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1992 |isbn=0-393-95735-7 }}</ref> Market equilibrium in this case refers to a condition where a market price is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services sought by [[Law of supply and demand|buyers]] is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by [[Law of supply and demand|sellers]]. This price is often called the competitive price or [[market clearing]] price and will tend not to change unless demand or supply changes and the quantity is called \"competitive quantity\" or market clearing quantity.\n\n=== Partial equilibrium ===\n{{Main|Partial equilibrium}}\nPartial equilibrium, as the name suggests, takes into consideration only a part of the market to attain equilibrium.\n\nJain proposes (attributed to [[George Stigler]]): \"A partial equilibrium is one which is based on only a restricted range of data, a standard example is price of a single product, the prices of all other products being held fixed during the analysis\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Jain|first=T.R.|title=Microeconomics and Basic Mathematics|year=2006|publisher=VK Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-87140-89-5|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUUoFwco2Z8C}}</ref>\n\nThe supply and demand model is a partial equilibrium model of [[economic equilibrium]], where the clearance on the [[Market (economics)|market]] of some specific [[good (economics)|goods]] is obtained independently from prices and quantities in other markets. In other words, the prices of all [[substitute good|substitutes]] and [[complement good|complements]] as well as [[income]] levels of [[consumer]]s are constant. This makes analysis much simpler than in a [[general equilibrium]] model which includes an entire economy.\n\nHere the dynamic process is that prices adjust until supply equals demand. It is a powerfully simple technique that allows one to study [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[Pareto Efficiency|efficiency]] and [[comparative statics]]. The stringency of the simplifying assumptions inherent in this approach make the model considerably more tractable, but it may produce results which while seemingly precise do not effectively model real world economic phenomena.\n\nPartial equilibrium analysis examines the effects of policy action in creating equilibrium only in that particular sector or market which is directly affected, ignoring its effect in any other market or industry assuming that they being small will have little impact if any.\n\nHence this analysis is considered to be useful in constricted markets.\n\n[[L\u00e9on Walras]] first formalised the idea of a one-period economic equilibrium of the general economic system, but it was French economist [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] and English political economist [[Alfred Marshall]] who developed tractable models to analyse an economic system.\n\n=== Empirical estimation ===\nDemand and supply relations in a market can be statistically estimated from price, quantity and other [[data]] with sufficient information in the model. This can be done with [[System of linear equations|simultaneous-equation]] methods of estimation in [[econometrics]]. Such methods allow solving for the model-relevant \"structural coefficients\", the estimated algebraic counterparts of the theory. The [[Identification (parameter)|parameter identification problem]] is a common issue in \"structural estimation\". Typically, data on [[exogenous]] variables (that is, variables other than price and quantity, both of which are [[Endogeneity (economics)|endogenous]] variables) are needed to perform such an estimation. An alternative to \"structural estimation\" is [[Reduced form|reduced-form]] estimation, which regresses each of the endogenous variables on the respective exogenous variables.\n\n=== Macroeconomic uses of demand and supply ===\nDemand and supply have also been generalised to explain [[macroeconomic]] variables in a [[market economy]], including the [[Real GDP|quantity of total output]] and the general [[price level]]. The [[AD-AS model|Aggregate Demand\u2013Aggregate Supply model]] may be the most direct application of supply and demand to macroeconomics, but other macroeconomic models also use supply and demand. Compared to [[microeconomic]] uses of demand and supply, different (and more controversial) theoretical considerations apply to such [[macroeconomic]] counterparts as [[aggregate demand]] and [[aggregate supply]]. Demand and supply are also used in macroeconomic theory to relate [[money supply]] and money demand to [[interest rate]]s and to relate labor supply and labor demand to wage rates.\n\n=== History ===\nAccording to Hamid S. Hosseini, the power of supply and demand was understood to some extent by several early Muslim scholars, such as fourteenth-century [[Mamluk]] scholar [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], who wrote: \"If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises. On the other hand, if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases, the price comes down\".<ref name=Hosseini>{{cite book |title=A Companion to the History of Economic Thought |chapter=Contributions of Medieval Muslim Scholars to the History of Economics and their Impact: A Refutation of the Schumpeterian Great Gap |last=Hosseini |first=Hamid S. |editor=Biddle, Jeff E. |editor2=Davis, Jon B. |editor3=Samuels, Warren J. |year=2003 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Malden, Massachusetts |isbn=0-631-22573-0 |doi=10.1002/9780470999059.ch3 |pages=28\u201345 [28 & 38]}} (citing Hamid S.

In this description, demand is [[Economic rent|rent]]: \"The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers\" and \"that which regulates the price... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent\".\n\nThe phrase \"supply and demand\" was first used by [[James Denham-Steuart]] in his ''Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy'', published in 1767. [[Adam Smith]] used the phrase in his 1776 book ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', and [[David Ricardo]] titled one chapter of his 1817 work ''[[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' \"On the Influence of Demand and Supply on Price\".<ref name=Humphrey>Thomas M.

In ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'', Ricardo more rigorously laid down the idea of the assumptions that were used to build his ideas of supply and demand. [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] first developed a mathematical model of supply and demand in his 1838 ''Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth'', including diagrams.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, the marginalist school of thought emerged. This field mainly was started by [[William Stanley Jevons|Stanley Jevons]], [[Carl Menger]] and [[L\u00e9on Walras]]. The key idea was that the price was set by the most expensive price\u2014that is, the price at the margin. This was a substantial change from Adam Smith's thoughts on determining the supply price.\n\nIn his 1870 essay \"On the Graphical Representation of Supply and Demand\", [[Fleeming Jenkin]] in the course of \"introduc[ing] the diagrammatic method into the English economic literature\" published the first drawing of supply and demand curves therein,<ref>A.

The government does not prevent firms from determining what wages they will pay and what prices they will charge for their products. However, many countries have [[minimum wage]] laws and minimum safety standards.\n\nUnder some versions of capitalism, the government carries out a number of economic functions, such as issuing money, supervising public utilities and enforcing private contracts. Many countries have [[competition law]]s that prohibit monopolies and cartels from forming. Despite anti-monopoly laws, large corporations can form near-monopolies in some industries. Such firms can temporarily drop prices and accept losses to prevent competition from entering the market and then raise them again once the threat of entry is reduced. In many countries, public utilities (e.g. electricity, heating fuel and communications) are able to operate as a monopoly under government regulation due to high economies of scale.\n\nGovernment agencies regulate the standards of service in many industries, such as airlines and broadcasting as well as financing a wide range of programs. In addition, the government regulates the flow of capital and uses financial tools such as the interest rate to control factors such as inflation and unemployment.<ref>\"Capitalism.\" World Book Encyclopedia. 1988. p. 194.</ref>\n\n=== Relationship to political freedom ===\nIn his book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', [[Friedrich Hayek]] asserts that the [[economic freedom]] of capitalism is a requisite of [[political freedom]]. He argues that the market mechanism is the only way of deciding what to produce and how to distribute the items without using coercion. [[Milton Friedman]], [[Andrew Brennan (economist)|Andrew Brennan]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] also promoted this view. Friedman claimed that centralized economic operations are always accompanied by [[political repression]]. In his view, transactions in a market economy are voluntary and that the wide diversity that voluntary activity permits is a fundamental threat to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish their power to coerce. Some of Friedman's views were shared by [[John Maynard Keynes]], who believed that capitalism is vital for freedom to survive and thrive.<ref>{{cite book |author=Friedrich Hayek|title=The Road to Serfdom|publisher=[[University Of Chicago Press]] |year=1944|isbn=0-226-32061-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Bellamy, Richard|title=The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-521-56354-2|page=60}}</ref> [[Freedom House]], an American think tank that conducts international research on and advocates for, democracy, political freedom and human rights, has argued \"there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom [[Freedom in the World|as measured by Freedom House]] and economic freedom [[Index of Economic Freedom|as measured by the Wall Street Journal/Heritage Foundation survey]]\".<ref>Adrian Karatnycky.

They vary in their institutional makeup and by their economic policies. The common features among all the different forms of capitalism is that they are based on the production of goods and services for profit, predominantly market-based allocation of resources and they are structured upon the accumulation of capital. The major forms of capitalism are listed hereafter:\n\n=== Advanced capitalism ===\n{{Main|Advanced capitalism}}\nAdvanced capitalism is the situation that pertains to a society in which the [[capitalist model]] has been integrated and developed deeply and extensively for a prolonged period. Various writers identify [[Antonio Gramsci]] as an influential early theorist of advanced capitalism, even if he did not use the term himself. In his writings, Gramsci sought to explain how capitalism had adapted to avoid the revolutionary overthrow that had seemed inevitable in the 19th century.

It is characterized by the intertwining of national business interests to state-interest and imperialism; and consequently, the state apparatus is utilized to advance national business interests abroad. An example of this is colonists living in America who were only allowed to trade with and purchase goods from their respective mother countries (e.g. Britain, Portugal and France). Mercantilism was driven by the belief that the wealth of a nation is increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations\u2014it corresponds to the phase of capitalist development sometimes called the [[primitive accumulation of capital]].\n\n=== Free market economy ===\n{{See also|Free market|Laissez-faire}}\nFree market economy refers to a capitalist economic system where prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy. It typically entails support for highly competitive markets and private ownership of productive enterprises. ''Laissez-faire'' is a more extensive form of free market economy where the role of the state is limited to protecting [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]].\n\n=== Social market economy ===\n{{Main|Social market|Nordic model}}\nA social market economy is a nominally free market system where government intervention in price formation is kept to a minimum, but the state provides significant services in the area of social security, unemployment benefits and recognition of [[labor rights]] through national [[collective bargaining]] arrangements. This model is prominent in Western and Northern European countries as well as Japan, albeit in slightly different configurations. The vast majority of enterprises are privately owned in this economic model.\n\n[[Rhine capitalism]] refers to the contemporary model of capitalism and adaptation of the social market model that exists in continental Western Europe today.\n\n=== State capitalism ===\n{{Main|State capitalism}}\nState capitalism is a capitalist market economy dominated by state-owned enterprises, where the state enterprises are organized as commercial, profit-seeking businesses. The designation has been used broadly throughout the 20th century to designate a number of different economic forms, ranging from state-ownership in market economies to the command economies of the former [[Eastern Bloc]]. According to Aldo Musacchio, a professor at Harvard Business School, state capitalism is a system in which governments, whether democratic or autocratic, exercise a widespread influence on the economy either through direct ownership or various subsidies. Musacchio notes a number of differences between today's state capitalism and its predecessors. In his opinion, gone are the days when governments appointed bureaucrats to run companies: the world's largest state-owned enterprises are now traded on the public markets and kept in good health by large institutional investors. Contemporary state capitalism is associated with the [[East Asian model of capitalism]], [[dirigisme]] and the economy of Norway.<ref>{{cite news |last=Musacchio |first=Aldo |url=http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/802 |title=Economist Debates: State capitalism: Statements |work=The Economist}}</ref> Alternatively, [[Merriam-Webster]] defines state capitalism as \"an economic system in which private capitalism is modified by a varying degree of government ownership and control\".<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/state%20capitalism State capitalism].

Capitalism is based around the accumulation of capital, whereby [[financial capital]] is invested in order to make a profit and then reinvested into further production in a continuous process of accumulation. In Marxian economic theory, this dynamic is called the [[law of value]]. Capital accumulation forms the basis of capitalism, where economic activity is structured around the accumulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], defined as investment in order to realize a financial profit.<ref name=\"Economist definition\">{{cite news | title = Economics A\u2013Z: ''Capital'' | url = http://www.economist.com/economics-a-to-z/c#node-21529870 | website = [[economist.com|The Economist]] | accessdate = 25 March 2015 }}</ref> In this context, \"capital\" is defined as money or a financial asset invested for the purpose of making more money (whether in the form of profit, rent, interest, royalties, capital gain or some other kind of return).<ref name=\"MIA definition\">{{cite web | title = Encyclopedia of Marxism \u2013 Glossary of terms: ''Capital'' | url = http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capital | website = [[Marxists Internet Archive]] | accessdate = 25 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn [[economics]], [[accounting]] and [[Marxian economics]], capital accumulation is often equated with [[investment]] of profit income or savings, especially in [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] capital goods. The concentration and centralisation of capital are two of the results of such accumulation. In modern [[macroeconomics]] and [[econometrics]], the phrase \"[[capital formation]]\" is often used in preference to \"accumulation\", though the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) refers nowadays to \"accumulation\". The phrase {{clarify|date=April 2016}} is occasionally used in [[national accounts]].\n\n=== Background ===\nAccumulation can be measured as the monetary value of investments, the amount of income that is reinvested, or as the change in the value of assets owned (the increase in the value of the capital stock). Using company [[balance sheet]]s, [[tax]] data and direct [[Statistical survey|surveys]] as a basis, government statisticians estimate total investments and assets for the purpose of [[national accounts]], national [[balance of payments]] and [[flow of funds]] statistics. The [[Federal Reserve|Reserve Banks]] and the [[Treasury]] usually provide interpretations and analysis of this data. Standard indicators include [[capital formation]], [[gross fixed capital formation]], [[fixed capital]], household asset wealth and [[foreign direct investment]].\n\nOrganisations such as the [[International Monetary Fund]], the UNCTAD, the [[World Bank Group]], the [[OECD]] and the [[Bank for International Settlements]] used national investment data to estimate world trends. The [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], [[Eurostat]] and the Japan Statistical Office provide data on the United States, Europe and Japan respectively. Other useful sources of investment information are business magazines such as ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]], [[Forbes]], [[The Economist]], [[Business Week]]'' and so on as well as various corporate \"[[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]]\" organisations and [[non-governmental organisation]] publications. A reputable scientific journal is the ''Review of Income & Wealth''. In the case of the United States, the \"Analytical Perspectives\" document (an annex to the yearly budget) provides useful wealth and capital estimates applying to the whole country.\n\nIn [[Karl Marx]]' economic theory, capital accumulation refers to the operation whereby profits are reinvested increasing the total quantity of capital. Capital is viewed by Marx as expanding value, that is, in other terms, as a sum of capital, usually expressed in money, that is transformed through human labor into a larger value, extracted as profits and expressed as money. Here, capital is defined essentially as economic or commercial asset [[Value (economics)|value]] in search of additional value or [[surplus-value]]. This requires property relations which enable objects of value to be appropriated and owned, and trading rights to be established. Capital accumulation has a double origin, namely in trade and in [[Confiscation|expropriation]], both of a legal or illegal kind. The reason is that a stock of capital can be increased through a process of exchange or \"trading up\", but also through directly taking an asset or resource from someone else without compensation. [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] calls this [[accumulation by dispossession]].\n\nThe continuation and progress of capital accumulation depends on the removal of obstacles to the expansion of trade and this has historically often been a violent process. As markets expand, more and more new opportunities develop for accumulating capital because more and more types of goods and services can be traded in. However, capital accumulation may also confront resistance when people refuse to sell, or refuse to buy (for example a [[Strike action|strike]] by investors or workers, or [[consumer resistance]]).\n\n=== Concentration and centralisation ===\nAccording to Marx, capital has the tendency for concentration and centralization in the hands of the wealthy. Marx explains: \"It is concentration of capitals already formed, destruction of their individual independence, expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small into few large capitals. [...] Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many. [...] The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities demands, ''caeteris paribus'', on the productiveness of labour, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages [...] It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors, partly vanish\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm|title=Economic Manuscripts: Capital Vol. I \u2013 Chapter Twenty-Five|first=Karl|last=Marx|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== The rate of accumulation ===\nIn [[Marxian economics]], the rate of accumulation is defined as (1) the value of the real net increase in the [[stock and flow|stock]] of capital in an accounting period; and (2) the proportion of realised [[surplus-value]] or profit-income which is reinvested, rather than consumed. This rate can be expressed by means of various ratios between the original capital outlay, the realised turnover, surplus-value or profit and reinvestments (e.g. the writings of the economist [[Micha\u0142 Kalecki]]).\n\nOther things being equal, the greater the amount of profit-income that is disbursed as personal earnings and used for consumptive purposes, the lower the savings rate and the lower the rate of accumulation is likely to be. However, earnings spent on consumption can also stimulate market demand and higher investment. This is the cause of endless controversies in economic theory about \"how much to spend, and how much to save\".\n\nIn a boom period of capitalism, the growth of investments is cumulative, i.e. one investment leads to another, leading to a constantly expanding market, an expanding [[labor force]] and an increase in the standard of living for the majority of the people.\n\nIn a stagnating, decadent capitalism, the accumulation process is increasingly oriented towards investment on military and security forces, real estate, financial speculation and luxury consumption. In that case, income from [[value added|value-adding]] production will decline in favour of interest, rent and tax income, with as a corollary an increase in the level of permanent unemployment. The more capital one owns, the more capital one can also borrow. The inverse is also true and this is one factor in the widening gap between the rich and the poor.\n\n[[Ernest Mandel]] emphasised that the rhythm of capital accumulation and growth depended critically on (1) the division of a society's social product between \"[[necessary product]]\" and \"[[surplus product]]\"; and (2) the division of the surplus product between [[investment]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. In turn, this allocation pattern reflected the outcome of [[competition]] among capitalists, competition between capitalists and workers and competition between workers. The pattern of capital accumulation can therefore never be simply explained by commercial factors as it also involved social factors and [[economic power|power]] relationships.\n\n=== The circuit of capital accumulation from production ===\nStrictly speaking, capital has accumulated only when realised [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] income has been reinvested in capital assets. As suggested in the first volume of Marx' ''[[Das Kapital]]'', the process of capital accumulation in [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] has at least seven distinct but linked moments:\n* The initial investment of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (which could be borrowed capital) in [[means of production]] and [[labor power]].\n* The command over [[surplus-labour]] and its appropriation.\n* The [[valorisation]] (increase in value) of capital through production of new outputs.\n* The appropriation of the new output produced by employees, containing the added value.\n* The realisation of [[surplus-value]] through output sales.\n* The appropriation of realised surplus-value as (profit) income after deduction of costs.\n* The reinvestment of profit income in production.\n\nAll of these moments do not refer simply to an \"economic\" or commercial process. Rather, they assume the existence of legal, social, cultural and economic power conditions, without which creation, distribution and circulation of the new wealth could not occur. This becomes especially clear when the attempt is made to create a market where none exists, or where people refuse to trade.\n\n=== Simple and expanded reproduction ===\nIn the second volume of ''Das Kapital'', Marx continues the story and shows that with the aid of bank [[credit (finance)|credit]] capital in search of growth can more or less smoothly mutate from one form to another, alternately taking the form of money capital (liquid deposits, securities and so on), commodity capital (tradable products, real estate and the like), or production capital ([[means of production]] and labor power).\n\nHis discussion of the simple and expanded [[reproduction (economics)|reproduction]] of the conditions of production offers a more sophisticated model of the parameters of the accumulation process as a whole. At simple reproduction, a sufficient amount is produced to sustain society at the given [[living standard]]; the stock of capital stays constant. At expanded reproduction, more product-value is produced than is necessary to sustain society at a given living standard (a [[surplus product]]); the additional product-value is available for investments which enlarge the scale and variety of production.\n\nThe bourgeois claim there is no [[economic law]] according to which capital is necessarily re-invested in the expansion of production, that such depends on anticipated profitability, market expectations and perceptions of investment risk. Such statements only explain the subjective experiences of investors and ignore the objective realities which would influence such opinions. As Marx states in the second volume of ''Das Kapital'', simple reproduction only exists if the variable and surplus capital realised by Dept. 1\u2014producers of means of production\u2014exactly equals that of the constant capital of Dept. 2, producers of articles of consumption (p.&nbsp;524). Such equilibrium rests on various assumptions, such as a constant labor supply (no population growth). Accumulation does not imply a necessary change in total magnitude of value produced, but can simply refer to a change in the composition of an industry (p.&nbsp;514).\n\n[[Ernest Mandel]] introduced the additional concept of contracted economic reproduction, i.e. reduced accumulation where business operating at a loss outnumbers growing business, or economic reproduction on a decreasing scale, for example due to wars, natural disasters or de[[valorisation]].\n\nBalanced [[economic growth]] requires that different factors in the accumulation process expand in appropriate proportions. However, markets themselves cannot spontaneously create that balance and in fact what drives business activity is precisely the imbalances between [[supply and demand]]: inequality is the motor of growth. This partly explains why the worldwide pattern of economic growth is very uneven and unequal, even although markets have existed almost everywhere for a very long-time. Some people argue that it also explains government regulation of market trade and [[protectionism]].\n\n=== Capital accumulation as social relation ===\n\"Accumulation of capital\" sometimes also refers in Marxist writings to the reproduction of capitalist [[social relations]] (institutions) on a larger scale over time, i.e. the expansion of the size of the [[proletariat]] and of the wealth owned by the [[bourgeoisie]].\n\nThis interpretation emphasises that capital ownership, predicated on command over labor, is a social relation: the growth of capital implies the growth of the [[working class]] (a \"[[law of accumulation]]\"). In the first volume of ''Das Kapital'', Marx had illustrated this idea with reference to [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]'s theory of colonisation: {{Quotation|Wakefield discovered that in the Colonies, property in money, means of subsistence, machines, and other means of production, does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be wanting the correlative \u2013 the wage-worker, the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his own free-will. He discovered that capital is not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things. Mr. Peel, he moans, took with him from England to Swan River, West Australia, means of subsistence and of production to the amount of \u00a350,000. Mr. Peel had the foresight to bring with him, besides, 3,000 persons of the working-class, men, women, and children. Once arrived at his destination, 'Mr. Peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch him water from the river.' Unhappy Mr. Peel, who provided for everything except the export of English modes of production to Swan River!|''Das Kapital'', vol. 1, ch. 33}}\n\nIn the [[Capital, Volume III|third volume]] of ''Das Kapital'', Marx refers to the \"fetishism of capital\" reaching its highest point with interest-bearing capital because now capital seems to grow of its own accord without anybody doing anything: {{Quotation|The relations of capital assume their most externalised and most fetish-like form in interest-bearing capital. We have here <math>M - M'</math>, money creating more money, self-expanding value, without the process that effectuates these two extremes. In merchant's capital, <math>M - C - M'</math>, there is at least the general form of the capitalistic movement, although it confines itself solely to the sphere of circulation, so that profit appears merely as profit derived from alienation; but it is at least seen to be the product of a social relation, not the product of a mere thing. [...] This is obliterated in <math>M - M'</math>, the form of interest-bearing capital. [...] The thing (money, commodity, value) is now capital even as a mere thing, and capital appears as a mere thing. The result of the entire process of reproduction appears as a property inherent in the thing itself. It depends on the owner of the money, i.e., of the commodity in its continually exchangeable form, whether he wants to spend it as money or loan it out as capital. In interest-bearing capital, therefore, this automatic fetish, self-expanding value, money generating money, are brought out in their pure state and in this form it no longer bears the birth-marks of its origin. The [[Social relations|social relation]] is consummated in the relation of a thing, of money, to itself. Instead of the actual transformation of money into capital, we see here only form without content.|''Das Kapital'', vol. 1, ch. 24|source=}}\n\n== Wage labour ==\n{{Main|Wage labour}}\n[[File:Worker 9.JPG|thumb|An industrial [[worker]] amidst heavy steel [[semi-product]]s (Kinex Bearings, [[Byt\u010da]], [[Slovakia]], c. 1995\u20132000)]]\n[[Wage labour]] refers to the sale of [[Labour economics|labour]] under a formal or informal [[employment contract]] to an [[employer]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Steinfeld|2009|p=3}}: \"All labor contracts were/are designed legally to bind a worker in one way or another to fulfill the labor obligations the worker has undertaken.

Print.</ref>\n\nCritics of the capitalist mode of production see wage labour as a major, if not defining, aspect of hierarchical industrial systems. Most opponents of the institution support [[worker self-management]] and [[economic democracy]] as alternatives to both wage labour and to capitalism. While most opponents of the wage system<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> blame the capitalist owners of the means of production for its existence, most [[anarchists]] and other [[libertarian socialists]] also hold the state as equally responsible as it exists as a tool utilised by capitalists to subsidise themselves and protect the institution of [[privatism|private ownership of the means of production]]. As some opponents of wage labour take influence from Marxist propositions, many are opposed to [[private property]], but maintain respect for [[personal property]].\n\n=== Types ===\nThe most common form of wage labour currently is ordinary direct, or \"full-time\", employment in which a free worker sells his or her labour for an indeterminate time (from a few years to the entire career of the worker) in return for a money-wage or salary and a continuing relationship with the employer which it does not in general offer contractors or other irregular staff. However, wage labour takes many other forms and explicit as opposed to implicit (i.e. conditioned by local labour and tax law) contracts are not uncommon. Economic history shows a great variety of ways in which labour is traded and exchanged. The differences show up in the form of:\n* Employment status: a worker could be employed full-time, part-time, or on a casual basis. He or she could be employed for example temporarily for a specific project only, or on a permanent basis. Part-time wage labour could combine with part-time [[self-employment]]. The worker could be employed also as an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]].\n* Civil (legal) status: the worker could for example be a free citizen, an [[indentured labour]]er, the subject of [[forced labour]] (including some prison or army labour); a worker could be assigned by the political authorities to a task, they could be a [[slavery|semi-slave]] or a [[serfdom|serf]] bound to the land who is hired out part of the time. So the labour might be performed on a more or less voluntary basis, or on a more or less involuntary basis, in which there are many gradations.\n* Method of payment (remuneration or [[Compensation of employees|compensation]]): the work done could be paid \"in cash\" (a money-wage) or \"in kind\" (through receiving goods and/or services), or in the form of \"[[Piecework|piece rates]]\" where the wage is directly dependent on how much the worker produces. In some cases, the worker might be paid in the form of credit used to buy goods and services, or in the form of [[Employee stock option|stock options]] or [[Share (finance)|shares]] in an enterprise.\n* Method of hiring: the worker might engage in a labour-contract on his or her own initiative, or he or she might hire out their labour as part of a group. However, he or she may also hire out their labour via an intermediary (such as an employment agency) to a third party. In this case, he or she is paid by the intermediary, but works for a third party which pays the intermediary. In some cases, labour is [[Subcontracting|subcontracted]] several times, with several intermediaries. Another possibility is that the worker is assigned or posted to a job by a political authority, or that an agency hires out a worker to an enterprise together with the [[means of production]].\n\n== Effects of war ==\n[[File:Alfred T. Palmer - Assembling the North American B-25 Mitchell at Kansas City, Kansas (USA).jpg|thumb|The common view among economic historians is that the [[Great Depression]] ended with the advent of World War II (assembling the North American [[B-25 Mitchell]] at [[Kansas City]], 1942)]]\nWar typically causes the diversion, destruction and creation of capital assets as capital assets are both destroyed or consumed and diverted to types of production needed to fight the war. Many assets are wasted and in some few cases created specifically to fight a war. War driven demands may be a powerful stimulus for the accumulation of capital and production capability in limited areas and market expansion outside the immediate theatre of war. Often this has induced laws against perceived and real [[war profiteering]].\n\nThe total hours worked in the United States rose by 34 percent during World War II, even though the military draft reduced the civilian labor force by 11 percent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ellen R. |last=Grattan |first2=Lee E. |last2=Ohanian |title=The macroeconomic effects of big fiscal shocks: the case of world war II |work=Minneapolis Federal Reserve, Working Paper 599 |date=December 1999 |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp599.pdf }}</ref>\n\nWar destruction can be illustrated by looking at [[World War II]]. Industrial war damage was heaviest in Japan, where 1/4 of factory buildings and 1/3 of plant and equipment were destroyed; 1/7 of electric power-generating capacity was destroyed and 6/7 of oil refining capacity. The Japanese merchant fleet lost 80% of their ships. In Germany in 1944, when air attacks were heaviest, 6.5% of machine tools were damaged or destroyed, but around 90% were later repaired. About 10% of steel production capacity was lost. In Europe, the United States and the Soviet Union enormous resources were accumulated and ultimately dissipated as planes, ships, tanks and so on were built and then lost or destroyed.\n\nGermany's total war damage was estimated at about 17.5% of the pre-war total capital stock by value, i.e. about 1/6. In the [[Berlin]] area alone, there were 8 million refugees lacking basic necessities. In 1945, less than 10% of the railways were still operating. 2,395 rail bridges were destroyed and a total of 7,500 bridges, 10,000 locomotives and more than 100,000 goods wagons were destroyed. Less than 40% of the remaining locomotives were operational.\n\nHowever, by the first quarter of 1946 European rail traffic, which was given assistance and preferences (by Western appointed military governors) for resources and material as an essential asset, regained its prewar operational level. At the end of the year, 90% of Germany's railway lines were operating again. In retrospect, the rapidity of infrastructure reconstruction appears astonishing.\n\nInitially, in May 1945 newly installed United States president [[Harry S. Truman]]'s directive had been that no steps would be taken towards economic rehabilitation of Germany. In fact, the initial industry plan of 1946 prohibited production in excess of half of the 1938 level; the iron and steel industry was allowed to produce only less than a third of pre-war output. These plans were rapidly revised and better plans were instituted. In 1946, over 10% of Germany's physical capital stock (plant and equipment) was also dismantled and confiscated, most of it going to the Soviet Union. By 1947, industrial production in Germany was at 1/3 of the 1938 level and industrial investment at about 1/2 the 1938 level.\n\nThe first big strike-wave in the [[Ruhr]] occurred in early 1947\u2014it was about food rations and housing, but soon there were demands for nationalisation. However, the United States appointed military governor (Newman) stated at the time that he had the power to break strikes by withholding food rations. The clear message was \"no work, no eat\". As the military controls in Western Germany were nearly all relinquished and the Germans were allowed to rebuild their own economy with [[Marshall Plan]] aid things rapidly improved. By 1951, German industrial production had overtaken the prewar level. The Marshall Aid funds were important, but after the currency reform (which permitted German capitalists to revalue their assets) and the establishment of a new political system much more important was the commitment of the United States to rebuilding German capitalism and establishing a free market economy and government, rather than keeping Germany in a weak position. Initially, average [[real wages]] remained low, lower even than in 1938, until the early 1950s while profitability was unusually high. So the total investment fund, aided by credits, was also high, resulting in a high rate of capital accumulation which was nearly all reinvested in new construction or new tools. This was called the [[German economic miracle]] or ''Wirtschaftswunder''.<ref>Armstrong, Glyn & Harrison, ''Capitalism since world war 2''. Fontana, 1984.

However, damage to [[human capital]] has been much more devastating in terms of fatalities (in the case of World War II, about 55 million deaths), permanent physical disability, enduring ethnic hostility and psychological injuries which have effects for at least several generations.\n\n== Systemic weaknesses ==\n=== Externalities ===\n{{Main|Externality|Commons}}\nMarket failure occurs when an [[externality]] is present and a market will often either under-produce a product with a positive externalisation or overproduce a product that generates a negative externalisation. Air pollution, for instance, is a negative externalisation that cannot be easily incorporated into markets as the world's air is not owned and then sold for use to polluters. So too much pollution could be emitted and people not involved in the production pay the cost of the pollution instead of the firm that initially emitted the air pollution. Critics of market failure theory, like [[Ronald Coase]], [[Harold Demsetz]] and [[James M. Buchanan]], argue that government programs and policies also fall short of absolute perfection. While all nations currently have some kind of market regulations, the desirable degree of regulation is disputed.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n== Criticism ==\n{{Main|Criticism of capitalism}}\n[[File:Anti-capitalism color\u2014 Restored.png|thumb|The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] poster \"[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]]\" (1911)]]\nCritics of capitalism associate the economic system with [[social inequality]]; unfair [[distribution of wealth]] and power; [[Economic materialism|materialism]]; repression of workers and [[trade union]]ists; [[social alienation]]; [[economic inequality]]; [[unemployment]]; and economic instability.

This class situation rested primarily on:\n# The existence of property not intended for active use.\n# The concentration of ownership in few hands.\n# The lack of direct access by workers to the [[means of production]] and consumption goods.\n# The perpetuation of a [[Reserve army of labour|reserve army of unemployed workers]].\n\nFor Marxists, labor as commodity, which is how they regard wage labor,<ref>{{Harvnb|Marx|1990|p=1006}}: \"[L]abour-power, a commodity sold by the worker himself.\"</ref> provides a fundamental point of attack against capitalism.<ref>Another one, of course, being the capitalists' theft from workers via [[surplus-value]].</ref> \"It can be persuasively argued\", noted one concerned philosopher, \"that the conception of the worker's labour as a commodity confirms Marx's stigmatization of the wage system of private capitalism as 'wage-slavery;' that is, as an instrument of the capitalist's for reducing the worker's condition to that of a slave, if not below it\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Nelson|1995|p=158}}. This Marxist objection is what motivated Nelson's essay, which argues that labor is not, in fact, a commodity.</ref> That this objection is fundamental follows immediately from Marx's conclusion that wage labor is the very foundation of capitalism: \"Without a class dependent on wages, the moment individuals confront each other as free persons, there can be no production of surplus value; without the production of surplus-value there can be no capitalist production, and hence no capital and no capitalist!\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Marx|1990|p=1005}}.

According to Marx, capital is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases. For Marx, the use of [[labor power]] had itself become a commodity under capitalism and the exchange value of labor power, as reflected in the wage, is less than the value it produces for the capitalist.\n\nThis difference in values, he argues, constitutes [[surplus value]], which the capitalists extract and accumulate. In his book ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'', Marx argues that the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers\u2014all prior class societies had extracted [[surplus labor]], but capitalism was new in doing so via the sale-value of produced commodities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch47.htm|title=Capital.

However, other late Marxian thinkers argue that a social formation as a whole may be classed as capitalist if capitalism is the mode by which a surplus is extracted, even if this surplus is not produced by capitalist activity as when an absolute majority of the population is engaged in non-capitalist economic activity.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Ste.

This theory suggested that disasters and capitalist economy were inevitably entwined.

Sage.</ref>\n\n=== Supply and demand ===\nAt least two assumptions are necessary for the validity of the standard model: first, that supply and demand are independent; and second, that supply is \"constrained by a fixed resource\". If these conditions do not hold, then the [[Marshallian surplus|Marshallian]] model cannot be sustained. [[Piero Sraffa|Sraffa's]] critique focused on the inconsistency (except in implausible circumstances) of partial equilibrium analysis and the rationale for the upward slope of the supply curve in a market for a produced consumption good.<ref>Avi J. Cohen, \"'The Laws of Returns Under Competitive Conditions': Progress in Microeconomics Since Sraffa (1926)?\", ''Eastern Economic Journal'', {{abbr|vol.|volume}} 9, no. 3 (Jul.-Sep.): 1983)</ref> The notability of Sraffa's critique is also demonstrated by [[Paul A. Samuelson]]'s comments and engagements with it over many years, for example:\n:What a cleaned-up version of Sraffa (1926) establishes is how nearly empty are all of Marshall's partial equilibrium boxes. To a logical purist of Wittgenstein and Sraffa class, the Marshallian partial equilibrium box of constant cost is even more empty than the box of increasing cost.<ref>Paul A. Samuelson, \"Reply\" in ''Critical Essays on Piero Sraffa's Legacy in Economics'' (edited by H. D. Kurz), Cambridge University Press, 2000</ref>\n\nAggregate excess demand in a market is the difference between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as a function of price. In the model with an upward-sloping supply curve and downward-sloping demand curve, the aggregate excess demand function only intersects the axis at one point, namely at the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. The [[Sonnenschein\u2013Mantel\u2013Debreu theorem]] shows that the standard model cannot be rigorously derived in general from [[general equilibrium theory]].<ref>Alan Kirman, \"The Intrinsic Limits of Modern Economic Theory: The Emperor has No Clothes\", ''The Economic Journal'', {{abbr|vol.|volume}} 99, no. 395, Supplement: Conference Papers (1989): pp. 126\u201339</ref>\n\nThe model of prices being determined by supply and demand assumes [[perfect competition]]. However, \"economists have no adequate model of how individuals and firms adjust prices in a competitive model. If all participants are price-takers by definition, then the actor who adjusts prices to eliminate excess demand is not specified\".<ref>Alan P. Kirman, \"Whom or What Does the Representative Individual Represent?\" ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', {{abbr|vol.|volume}} 6, no.  2 (Spring 1992): pp. 117\u201336</ref> Goodwin, Nelson, Ackerman and Weisskopf write:\n:If we mistakenly confuse [[Accuracy and precision|precision with accuracy]], then we might be misled into thinking that an explanation expressed in precise mathematical or graphical terms is somehow more rigorous or useful than one that takes into account particulars of history, institutions or business strategy. This is not the case. Therefore, it is important not to put too much confidence in the apparent precision of supply and demand graphs. Supply and demand analysis is a useful precisely formulated conceptual tool that clever people have devised to help us gain an abstract understanding of a complex world. It does not \u2013 nor should it be expected to \u2013 give us in addition an accurate and complete description of any particular real world market.<ref>Goodwin, N, Nelson, J; Ackerman, F; & Weisskopf, T: Microeconomics in Context 2d {{abbr|ed.|edition}} Sharpe 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-7656-2301-0}}</ref>\n\n=== Counter-criticisms ===\n==== Austrian School ====\n[[Austrian School]] economists have argued that capitalism can organize itself into a complex system without an external guidance or central planning mechanism. [[Friedrich Hayek]] considered the phenomenon of [[self-organisation]] as underpinning capitalism. Prices serve as a signal as to the urgent and unfilled wants of people and the opportunity to earn profits if successful, or absorb losses if resources are used poorly or left idle, gives entrepreneurs [[incentive]] to use their [[Dispersed knowledge|knowledge]] and resources to satisfy those wants. Thus the activities of millions of people, each seeking his own interest, are coordinated.<ref name=walberg2003>{{cite book |author=Walberg, Herbert |title=Education and Capitalism |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/books/8328 |publisher=Hoover Institution Press |year=2003 |chapter=4, What is Capitalism? |pages=87\u201389 |isbn=0-8179-3972-5}}</ref>\n\n==== Ayn Rand ====\nThe novelist and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] made positive moral defenses of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism, most notably in her 1957 novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' and in her 1966 collection of essays ''[[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]]''.

Heavy cross ownership is referred to as circular ownership.\n\nIn the US, \"cross ownership\" also refers to a type of investment in different mass-media properties in one market.\n\n==Cross ownership of stock==\nSome countries where cross ownership of shares is a major part of the business culture are:\n* [[Japan]]\n* [[Germany]]\n\nPositives of cross ownership:\n* Closely ties each business to the economic destiny of its business partners\n* Promotes a slow rate of economic change\n\nCross ownership of shares is criticized for:\n* Stagnating the economy\n* Wasting capital that could be used to improve productivity\n* Expanding economic downturns by preventing reallocation of capital\n\nA major factor in perpetuating cross ownership of shares is a high [[capital gains tax]] rate.  A company has less incentive to sell cross owned shares if taxes are high because of the immediate reduction in the value of the assets.\n\nFor example, a company owns $1000 of stock in another company that was originally purchased for $200.  If the capital gains tax rate is 25% (like Germany) and the company sells the stock,\nthe company has $800 which is 20 percent less than before it sold the stock.\n\nLong term cross ownership of shares combined with a high capital tax rate greatly increases periods of asset deflation both in time and in severity.\n\n==Media cross ownership==\n{{main|Media cross-ownership in the United States}}\n\nCross ownership also refers to a type of media ownership in which one type of communications (say a newspaper) owns or is the sister company of another type of medium (such as a radio or TV station). One example is ''[[The New York Times]]'' 's former ownership of [[WQXR-FM|WQXR]] Radio and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'''s similar relationship with WGN Radio ([[WGN-AM]]) and Television ([[WGN-TV]]).\n\nThe [[Federal Communications Commission]] generally does not allow cross ownership, to keep from one license holder having too much local media ownership, unless the license holder obtains a waiver, such as [[News Corporation]] and the [[Tribune Company]] have in New York.\n\nThe mid-1970s cross-ownership guidelines grandfathered already-existing crossownerships, such as ''Tribune''-WGN, ''New York Times''-WQXR and the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' ownership of [[WPIX]] Television and Radio.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cross Ownership}}\n[[Category:Business ownership]]\n[[Category:Strategic management]]", "sha1": "jyqnnaaz7piwsxr7tsthep5qzfl23u0"}}, {"title": "Cardiology", "ns": "0", "id": "5421", "revision": {"id": "861475440", "parentid": "861310675", "timestamp": "2018-09-27T18:08:42Z", "contributor": {"username": "G\u00fcnniX", "id": "237572"}, "comment": "Undid revision 861280990 by [[Special:Contributions/82.219.234.141|82.219.234.141]] ([[User talk:82.219.234.141|talk]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the medical specialty dealing with the heart|the album by Good Charlotte|Cardiology (album)|the medical journal|Cardiology (journal)}}\n{{Infobox medical specialty\n| title        = Cardiology\n| subdivisions = Interventional, Nuclear\n| image        = [[File:Heart diagram blood flow en.svg|225px]]\n| caption      = Blood flow diagram of the human heart.

The field includes [[medical diagnosis]] and treatment of [[congenital heart defect]]s, [[coronary artery disease]], [[heart failure]], [[valvular heart disease]] and [[electrophysiology]]. [[Physicians]] who specialize in this field of medicine are called '''cardiologists''', a specialty of [[internal medicine]]. Pediatric cardiologists are [[pediatrician]]s who specialize in cardiology. Physicians who specialize in cardiac surgery are called '''[[cardiothoracic surgeon]]s''' or '''cardiac surgeons''', a specialty of [[general surgery]].\n\nAlthough the cardiovascular system is inextricably linked to blood, cardiology is relatively unconcerned with [[hematology]] and its diseases. Some obvious exceptions that affect the function of the heart would be blood tests ([[electrolyte]] disturbances, [[troponin]]s), decreased oxygen carrying capacity ([[anemia]], [[hypovolemic shock]]), and [[coagulopathy|coagulopathies]].\n\n== Specializations ==\nAll cardiologists study the disorders of the heart, but the study of adult and child heart disorders are through different training pathways. Therefore, an adult cardiologist (often simply called \"cardiologist\") is inadequately trained to take care of children, and pediatric cardiologists are not trained to take care of adult heart disease. The surgical aspects are not included in cardiology and are in the domain of [[cardiothoracic surgery]]. For example, [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] (CABG), [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] and [[valve replacement]] are surgical procedures performed by surgeons, not cardiologists. However the insertion of stents, pacemakers are performed by cardiologists\n\n===Adult cardiology===\nCardiology is a specialty of [[internal medicine]]. To be a cardiologist in the [[United States]], a three-year residency in internal medicine is followed by a three-year fellowship in cardiology. It is possible to specialize further in a sub-specialty. Recognized sub-specialties in the United States by the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|ACGME]] are [[cardiac electrophysiology]], [[echocardiography]], [[interventional cardiology]], and [[nuclear cardiology]]. Recognized subspecialties in the United States by the [[American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists]] (AOABOS) include [[clinical cardiac electrophysiology]] and [[interventional cardiology]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Specialties & Subspecialties|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/development/aoa-board-certification/Pages/specialty-subspecialty-certification.aspx|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|accessdate=23 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813083503/http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/development/aoa-board-certification/Pages/specialty-subspecialty-certification.aspx|archive-date=2015-08-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>\n\nPer [[doximity]], adult cardiologists make an average of $436,849 in the United States.<ref name=r1>Hamblin, James (January 27, 2015) [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/physician-salaries/384846/ What Doctors Make]. theatlantic.com</ref>\n\n==== Cardiac electrophysiology ====\n{{Main|Cardiac electrophysiology}}\n\n[[Cardiac electrophysiology]] is the [[science]] of elucidating, diagnosing, and treating the electrical activities of the [[heart]].  The term is usually used to describe studies of such phenomena by invasive (intracardiac) catheter recording of spontaneous activity as well as of cardiac responses to [[programmed electrical stimulation|programmed electrical stimulation (PES)]]. These studies are performed to assess complex [[arrhythmias]], elucidate symptoms, evaluate abnormal [[electrocardiograms]], assess risk of developing arrhythmias in the future, and design treatment.  These procedures increasingly include therapeutic methods (typically [[radiofrequency ablation]], or [[cryoablation]]) in addition to diagnostic and prognostic procedures.  Other therapeutic modalities employed in this field include [[antiarrhythmic drug]] therapy and implantation of [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]] and automatic [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillators]] (AICD).<ref name=Fauci>Fauci, Anthony, et al. ''Harrison's Textbook of Medicine''. New York: McGraw Hill, 2009.</ref><ref>Braunwald, Eugene, ed. ''Heart Disease, 6th edition.'' Philadelphia: Saunders, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe cardiac electrophysiology study (EPS) typically measures the response of the injured or cardiomyopathic myocardium to PES on specific pharmacological regimens in order to assess the likelihood that the regimen will successfully prevent potentially fatal sustained [[ventricular tachycardia|ventricular tachycardia (VT)]] or [[ventricular fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation VF]] (VF) in the future. Sometimes a ''series'' of EPS drug trials must be conducted to enable the cardiologist to select the one regimen for long-term treatment that best prevents or slows the development of VT or VF following PES. Such studies may also be conducted in the presence of a newly implanted or newly replaced cardiac pacemaker or AICD.<ref name=Fauci />\n\n===== Clinical cardiac electrophysiology =====\n{{Main|Clinical cardiac electrophysiology}}\n\n[[Clinical cardiac electrophysiology]] is a branch of the medical specialty of cardiology and is concerned with the study and treatment of rhythm disorders of the heart. Cardiologists with expertise in this area are usually referred to as electrophysiologists. Electrophysiologists are trained in the mechanism, function, and performance of the electrical activities of the heart. Electrophysiologists work closely with other cardiologists and cardiac surgeons to assist or guide therapy for heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias). They are trained to perform interventional and surgical procedures to treat cardiac arrhythmia.\n\nThe training required to become an electrophysiologist is long and requires 7 to 8 years after medical school (in the U.S.). Three years of internal medicine residency, three years of Clinical Cardiology fellowship, and one to two (in most instances) years of clinical cardiac electrophysiology.\n\n==== Cardiogeriatrics ====\n{{Main|Cardiogeriatrics}}\n\n[[Cardiogeriatrics]] or geriatric cardiology is the branch of cardiology and geriatric medicine that deals with the cardiovascular disorders in elderly people.\n\nCardiac disorders such as coronary heart disease (including myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias (as atrial fibrillation) and others are common and are a major cause of mortality in elderly people. Vascular disorders such as atherosclerosis and peripheral arterial disease cause significant morbidity and mortality in aged people.\n\n==== Echocardiography ====\n{{Main|Echocardiography}}\n\nEchocardiography uses standard two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and Doppler ultrasound to create images of the heart.\n\nEchocardiography has become routinely used in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with any suspected or known heart diseases. It is one of the most widely used diagnostic tests in cardiology. It can provide a wealth of helpful information, including the size and shape of the heart (internal chamber size quantification), pumping capacity, and the location and extent of any tissue damage. An echocardiogram can also give physicians other estimates of heart function, such as a calculation of the cardiac output, ejection fraction, and diastolic function (how well the heart relaxes).\n\nEchocardiography can help detect cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and many others. The use of stress echocardiography may also help determine whether any chest pain or associated symptoms are related to heart disease. The biggest advantage to echocardiography is that it is not invasive (does not involve breaking the skin or entering body cavities) and has no known risks or side effects.\n\n==== Interventional cardiology ====\n{{Main|Interventional cardiology}}\n\nInterventional cardiology is a branch of cardiology that deals specifically with the catheter based treatment of structural heart diseases. Andreas Gruentzig is considered the father of interventional cardiology after the development of angioplasty by interventional radiologist Charles Dotter. A large number of procedures can be performed on the heart by catheterization. This most commonly involves the insertion of a sheath into the femoral artery (but, in practice, any large peripheral artery or vein) and cannulating the heart under X-ray visualization (most commonly fluoroscopy).\n\nThe main advantages of using the interventional cardiology or radiology approach are the avoidance of the scars and pain, and long post-operative recovery. Additionally, interventional cardiology procedure of primary angioplasty is now the gold standard of care for an acute myocardial infarction. It involves the extraction of clots from occluded coronary arteries and deployment of stents and balloons through a small hole made in a major artery, which has given it the name \"pin-hole surgery\" (as opposed to \"key-hole surgery\").\n\n===Pediatric cardiology===\n[[Helen B. Taussig]] is known as the founder of pediatric cardiology. She became famous through her work with [[Tetralogy of Fallot]], a congenital heart defect in which oxygenated and deoxygenated blood enters the circulatory system resulting from a [[ventricular septal defect]] (VSD) right beneath the aorta. This condition causes newborns to have a bluish-tint, [[cyanosis]], and have a deficiency of oxygen to their tissues, [[hypoxemia]]. She worked with [[Alfred Blalock]]<nowiki/> and [[Vivien Thomas]] at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] where they experimented with dogs to look at how they would attempt to surgically cure these \"blue babies.\" They eventually figured out how to do just that by the [[anastomosis]] of the systemic artery to the pulmonary artery and called this the [[Blalock\u2013Taussig shunt|Blalock-Taussig Shunt]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Anne M.|date=2008-07-16|title=The Blalock-Taussig-Thomas Collaboration|journal=JAMA|volume=300|issue=3|doi=10.1001/jama.300.3.328|issn=0098-7484|pages=328\u201330|pmid=18632547}}</ref>\n\nTetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, double outlet right ventricle, transposition of the great arteries, persistent truncus arteriosus, and Ebsteins anomaly are various congenital cyanotic heart diseases. Congenital cyanotic heart diseases is where something is wrong with the heart of a newborn and it is not oxygenating the blood efficiently.\n[[File:Heart tetralogy fallot.svg|left|thumb|Tetralogy of Fallot]]\n\n==== Tetralogy of Fallot ====\n[[Tetralogy of Fallot]] is the most common congenital heart disease arising in 1\u20133 cases per 1,000 births. The cause of this defect is a [[ventricular septal defect]] (VSD) and an [[overriding aorta]]. These two defects combined causes deoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs and going right back into the [[circulatory system]]. The [[modified Blalock-Taussig shunt]] is usually used to fix the circulation. This procedure is done by placing a graft between the subclavian artery and the ipsilateral pulmonary artery to restore the correct blood flow.\n\n==== Pulmonary Atresia ====\n[[Pulmonary atresia|Pulmonary Atresia]] happens in 7\u20138 per 100,000 births and is characterized by the aorta branching out of the right ventricle. This causes the deoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs and enter the circulatory system. Surgeries can fix this by redirecting the aorta and fixing the right ventricle and pulmonary artery connection.\n\nThere are two types of pulmonary atresia, classified by whether or not the baby also has a [[ventricular septal defect]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-07-19|title={{Source-attribution|Ventricular Septal Defects: Background, Anatomy, Pathophysiology|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/892980-overview}}|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=|title={{Source-attribution| Facts about Pulmonary Atresia: Types of Pulmonary Atresia|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/heartdefects/pulmonaryatresia.html}}|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Centers of Disease Control|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-22}}</ref>\n* Pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum: This type of pulmonary atresia is associated with complete and intact [[septum]] between the ventricles.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Pulmonary atresia with a ventricular septal defect: This type of pulmonary atresia happens when a ventricular septal defect allows blood to flow into and out of the right ventricle.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Double Outlet Right Ventricle (DORV) ====\n[[Double outlet right ventricle]] is when both great arteries, the pulmonary artery and the aorta, are connected to the right ventricle. There is usually a VSD in different particular places depending on the variations of DORV, typically 50% are subaortic and 30%. The surgeries that can be done to fix this defect can vary due to the different physiology and blood flow in the defected heart. One way it can be cured is by a VSD closure and placing conduits to restart the blood flow between the left ventricle and the aorta and between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. Another way is systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt in cases associated with [[Pulmonic stenosis|pulmonary stenosis]]. Also, a [[Atrial septostomy|balloon atrial septostomy]] can be done to fix DORV with the Taussig-Bing anomaly.\n\n==== Transposition of Great Arteries ====\n[[File:D-tga-575px.jpg|thumb|Dextro-transposition of the Great Arteries]]\nThere are two different types of [[Transposition of the great vessels|transposition of the great arteries]], [[Dextro-Transposition of the great arteries|Dextro-transposition of the great arteries]] and [[Levo-Transposition of the great arteries|Levo-transposition of the great arteries]], depending on where the chambers and vessels connect. Dextro-transposition happens in about 1 in 4,000 newborns and is when the right ventricle pumps blood into the aorta and deoxygenated blood enters the blood stream. The temporary procedure is to create an [[atrial septal defect]] (ASD). A permanent fix is more complicated and involves redirecting the pulmonary return to the right atrium and the systemic return to the left atrium, which is known as the [[Senning procedure]]. The [[Rastelli procedure]] can also be done by rerouting the left ventricular outflow, dividing the pulmonary trunk, and placing a conduit in between the right ventricle and pulmonary trunk. Levo-transposition happens in about 1 in 13,000 newborns and is characterized by the left ventricle pumping blood into the lungs and the right ventricle pumping the blood into the aorta. This may not produce problems at the beginning, but will eventually due to the different pressures each ventricle uses to pump blood. Switching the left ventricle to be the systemic ventricle and the right ventricle to pump blood into the pulmonary artery can repair levo-transposition.\n\n==== Persistent Truncus Arteriosis ====\n[[Persistent truncus arteriosus]] is when the [[truncus arteriosus]] fails to split into the aorta and pulmonary trunk. This occurs in about 1 in 11,000 live births and allows both oxygenated and deoxygenated blood into the body. The repair consists of a VSD closure and the Rastelli procedure.\n\n==== Ebstein Anomaly ====\n[[Ebstein's anomaly]] is characterized by a right atrium that is significantly enlarged and a heart that is shaped like a box. This is very rare and happens in less than 1% of congenital heart disease cases.

To become a pediatric cardiologist in the [[United States]], one must complete a three-year residency in pediatrics, followed by a three-year fellowship in pediatric cardiology.

Simplified, the heart is a circuit of the [[Circulatory system|Circulation]].\nWhile plenty is known about the healthy heart, the bulk of study in cardiology is in disorders of the heart and restoration, and where possible, of function.\n\nThe heart is a muscle that squeezes blood and functions like a pump.\nEach part of the heart is susceptible to failure or dysfunction and the heart can be divided into the mechanical and the electrical parts.\n\nThe electrical part of the heart is centered on the periodic contraction (squeezing) of the [[myocardium|muscle cells]] that is caused by the [[cardiac pacemaker]] located in the [[sinoatrial node]].\nThe study of the electrical aspects is a sub-field of [[electrophysiology]] called [[cardiac electrophysiology]] and is epitomized with the [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG/EKG).\nThe [[action potential]]s generated in the pacemaker propagate throughout the heart in a specific pattern. The system that carries this potential is called the [[electrical conduction system of the heart|electrical conduction system]].\nDysfunction of the electrical system manifests in many ways and may include [[Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome]], [[ventricular fibrillation]], and [[heart block]].\n\nThe mechanical part of the heart is centered on the [[fluid mechanics|fluidic movement]] of [[blood]] and the functionality of the heart as a [[pump]].\nThe mechanical part is ultimately the purpose of the heart and many of the disorders of the heart disrupt the ability to move blood.\nFailure to move sufficient blood can result in failure in other organs and may result in death if severe.\n[[Heart failure]] is one condition in which the mechanical properties of the heart have failed or are failing, which means insufficient blood is being circulated.\n\n=== Coronary circulation ===\n{{Main|Coronary circulation}}\n\n[[Coronary circulation]] is the circulation of blood in the [[blood vessel]]s of the [[heart]] muscle ([[myocardium]]). The vessels that deliver oxygen-rich blood to the [[myocardium]] are known as coronary arteries. The vessels that remove the deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle are known as cardiac veins. These include the [[great cardiac vein]], the [[middle cardiac vein]], the [[small cardiac vein]] and the [[anterior cardiac veins]].\n\nAs the left and right coronary arteries run on the surface of the heart, they can be called epicardial coronary arteries. These arteries, when healthy, are capable of autoregulation to maintain coronary blood flow at levels appropriate to the needs of the [[myocardium|heart muscle]].  These relatively narrow vessels are commonly affected by [[atherosclerosis]] and can become blocked, causing [[Angina pectoris|angina]] or a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. (See also: [[circulatory system]].) The coronary arteries that run deep within the myocardium are referred to as subendocardial.\n\nThe coronary arteries are classified as \"end circulation\", since they represent the only source of blood supply to the myocardium; there is very little redundant blood supply, which is why blockage of these vessels can be so critical.\n\n=== Cardiac examination ===\n{{Main|Cardiac examination}}\n\nThe [[cardiac examination]] (also called the \"precordial exam\"), is performed as part of a [[physical examination]], or when a patient presents with [[chest pain]] suggestive of a cardiovascular [[pathology]]. It would typically be modified depending on the [[Indication (medicine)|indication]] and integrated with other examinations especially the [[respiratory examination]].\n\nLike all medical examinations, the cardiac examination follows the standard structure of inspection, palpation and auscultation.\n\n== Heart disorders ==\n{{Main|List of heart disorders}}\n\nCardiology is concerned with the normal functionality of the heart and the deviation from a healthy heart.\nMany disorders involve the heart itself but some are outside of the heart and in the vascular system.\nCollectively, the two together are termed the cardiovascular system and diseases of one part tend to affect the other.\n\n=== Hypertension ===\n[[Image:Main complications of persistent high blood pressure.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Diagram illustrating the main complications of persistent high blood pressure]]\n{{Main|Hypertension}}\n\n[[Hypertension]], also known as \"high blood pressure\"\", is a [[Chronic (medicine)|long term]] [[Disease|medical condition]] in which the [[blood pressure]] in the [[artery|arteries]] is persistently elevated.<ref name=Nai2014>{{cite book|last1=Naish|first1=Jeannette|last2=Court|first2=Denise Syndercombe|title=Medical sciences|date=2014|isbn=9780702052491|page=562|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K21_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA562}}</ref> High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms.<ref name=CDC2015>{{cite web|title=High Blood Pressure Fact Sheet|url=https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_bloodpressure.htm|website=CDC|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=February 19, 2015}}</ref> Long term high blood pressure, however, is a major risk factor for [[coronary artery disease]], [[stroke]], [[heart failure]], [[peripheral vascular disease]], [[vision loss]], and [[chronic kidney disease]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lackland|first1=DT|last2=Weber|first2=MA|title=Global burden of cardiovascular disease and stroke: hypertension at the core|journal=The Canadian Journal of Cardiology|date=May 2015|volume=31|issue=5|pages=569\u201371|pmid=25795106|doi=10.1016/j.cjca.2015.01.009}}</ref><ref name=WHO2011a>{{cite book|last1=Mendis|first1=Shanthi|last2=Puska|first2=Pekka|last3=Norrving|first3=Bo|title=Global atlas on cardiovascular disease prevention and control|date=2011|publisher=World Health Organization in collaboration with the World Heart Federation and the World Stroke Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9789241564373|page=38|edition=1st|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241564373_eng.pdf?ua=1}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Causes -->\nLifestyle factors can increase the risk of hypertension.

The series of [[fighting game]]s are among the most popular in their genre. Having sold over 30 million units, the series serves as Capcom's flagship franchise. That same year, the company introduced its ''[[Mega Man]]'' series, which also sells nearly 30 million units.\n\nThe company released the first entry in its ''[[Resident Evil]]'' survival horror series in 1996. The series has achieved financial success, selling nearly 50 million units. Following work on the second entry in the ''Resident Evil'' series, Capcom began work on a ''Resident Evil'' game for the [[PlayStation 2]]. Radically different from the existing series, Capcom decided to spin off the game into its own series, ''[[Devil May Cry]]''. While it released the first two entries exclusively for the PlayStation 2, the company brought further entries to non-[[Sony]] consoles. The series as a whole has seen sales in excess of 10 million units. Capcom began its ''[[Monster Hunter]]'' series in 2004. The series has seen sales of over 45 million units on a variety of consoles.\n\nAlthough the company often relies on existing franchises, it also published and developed several titles for the [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Wii]], based on original intellectual property: ''[[Lost Planet: Extreme Condition]]'', ''[[Dead Rising (video game)|Dead Rising]]'', ''[[Dragon's Dogma]]'', ''[[Asura's Wrath]]'' and ''[[Zack and Wiki]]''.<ref name=\"New Blood\">\"Lost Planet & Dead Rising; Capcom Brings New Blood to Xbox 360.\" EGM [i] 2006: 1-41.

The [[Free French]], under General [[Charles de Gaulle]], were determined to recover Indochina, though they offered Cambodia and the other Indochinese protectorates a carefully circumscribed measure of self-government. Convinced that they had a \"[[civilizing mission]]\", they envisioned Indochina's participation in a French Union of former colonies that shared the common experience of French culture.\n\n==Administration of Sihanouk (1953\u201370)==\n{{Main article|Japanese occupation of Cambodia|Kingdom of Cambodia (1953\u201370)}}\nOn 9 March 1945, during the [[Japanese occupation of Cambodia]], young king [[Norodom Sihanouk]] proclaimed an independent Kingdom of Kampuchea, following a formal request by the Japanese. Shortly thereafter the Japanese government nominally ratified the independence of Cambodia and established a consulate in Phnom Penh.<ref>Keat Gin Ooi ''Southeast Asia: a historical encyclopedia''</ref> The new government did away with the [[romanisation]] of the [[Khmer language]] that the French colonial administration was beginning to enforce and officially reinstated the [[Khmer script]]. This measure taken by the short-lived governmental authority would be popular and long-lasting, for since then no government in Cambodia has tried to romanise the Khmer language again.<ref>David P. Chandler, ''A History of Cambodia'', Silkworm 1993</ref>\nAfter Allied military units entered Cambodia, the Japanese military forces present in the country were disarmed and repatriated. The French were able to reimpose the colonial administration in Phnom Penh in October the same year.<ref>[http://www.country-data.com/frd/cs/cambodia/kh_appnb.html Cambodia, Appendix B \u2013 Major Political and Military Organizations]</ref>\n[[File:Norodom_Sihanouk_1941.jpg|thumb|right|Cornation of [[Norodom Sihanouk]] in 1941.]]\nSihanouk's \"royal crusade for independence\" resulted in grudging French acquiescence to his demands for a transfer of sovereignty. A partial agreement was struck in October 1953. Sihanouk then declared that independence had been achieved and returned in triumph to [[Phnom Penh]]. As a result of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, Cambodia was able to bring about the withdrawal of the [[Viet Minh]] troops from its territory and to withstand any residual impingement upon its sovereignty by external powers.\n\nNeutrality was the central element of Cambodian foreign policy during the 1950s and 1960s. By the mid-1960s, parts of Cambodia's eastern provinces were serving as bases for North Vietnamese Army and [[Viet Cong|National Liberation Front]] (NVA/NLF) forces operating against South Vietnam, and the port of [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]] was being used to supply them. As NVA/VC activity grew, the United States and [[South Vietnam]] became concerned, and in 1969, the United States began a 14-month-long series of bombing raids targeted at NVA/VC elements, contributing to destabilisation. The bombing campaign took place no further than ten, and later twenty miles (32&nbsp;km) inside the Cambodian border, areas where the Cambodian population had been evicted by the NVA.<ref>Davidson, Phillip B. ''Vietnam at War: The History 1946\u20131975''. 1988. P. 593</ref> <!--Cite supports entire paragraph--> Prince Sihanouk, fearing that the conflict between communist North Vietnam and South Vietnam might spill over to Cambodia, publicly opposed the idea of a bombing campaign by the United States along the Vietnam\u2013Cambodia border and inside Cambodian territory. However [[Peter Rodman]] claimed, \"Prince Sihanouk complained bitterly to us about these North Vietnamese bases in his country and invited us to attack them\". In December 1967 ''Washington Post'' journalist Stanley Karnow was told by Sihanouk that if the US wanted to bomb the Vietnamese communist sanctuaries, he would not object, unless Cambodians were killed.<ref>''The Washington Post'', 29 December 1967</ref> The same message was conveyed to US President Johnson's emissary Chester Bowles in January 1968.<ref>Stephen J. Morris ''Why Vietnam Invaded Cambodia'' (Stanford University Press. 1999). p. 44</ref> So the US had no real motivation to overthrow Sihanouk. However Prince Sihanouk wanted Cambodia to stay out of the North Vietnam\u2013South Vietnam conflict and was very critical of the United States government and its allies (the South Vietnamese government). Prince Sihanouk, facing internal struggles of his own, due to the rise of the Khmer Rouge, did not want Cambodia to be involved in the conflict. Sihanouk wanted the United States and its allies (South Vietnam) to keep the war away from the Cambodian border. Sihanouk did not allow the United States to use Cambodian air space and airports for military purposes. This upset the United States greatly and contributed to their view that of Prince Sihanouk as a North Vietnamese sympathiser and a thorn on the United States.<ref>{{worldhistory|quote=P. 1012|section=4084}}</ref> However, declassified documents indicate that, as late as March 1970, the Nixon administration was hoping to garner \"friendly relations\" with Sihanouk.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, domestic Cambodian politics became polarised. Opposition to the government grew within the middle class and leftists including Paris-educated leaders like [[Son Sen]], [[Ieng Sary]], and Saloth Sar (later known as [[Pol Pot]]), who led an [[insurgency]] under the clandestine Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK). Sihanouk called these insurgents the [[Khmer Rouge]], literally the \"Red Khmer\". But the 1966 national assembly elections showed a significant swing to the right, and General [[Lon Nol]] formed a new government, which lasted until 1967. During 1968 and 1969, the insurgency worsened. However members of the government and army, who resented Sihanouk's ruling style as well as his tilt away from the United States, did have a motivation to overthrow him.\n\n==Khmer Republic and the War (1970\u201375)==\n{{Main article|Cambodian Civil War|Khmer Republic|Kingdom of Cambodia (1975\u201376)}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2010}}\n[[File:Asien Bd1.jpg|350px|thumb|Map of Asia in 1890 CE.]]\nWhile visiting Beijing in 1970 Sihanouk was [[Cambodian coup of 1970|ousted by a military coup]] led by Prime Minister General [[Lon Nol]] and Prince Sisowath [[Sirik Matak]] in the early hours of 18 March 1970.<ref>Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' p. 197.</ref><ref>\n[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/133533.stm \"Prince Sihanouk was deposed in a right-wing coup in 1970 led by Lt-Gen Lon Nol\"]</ref>\nHowever, as early as 12 March 1970, the CIA Station Chief told Washington that based on communications from Sirik Matak, Lon Nol's cousin, that \"the (Cambodian) army was ready for a coup\".<ref>Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' (Henry Holt & Co.: New York, 2004) p. 195.</ref> Lon Nol assumed power after the military coup and immediately allied Cambodia with the United States. Son Ngoc Thanh, an opponent of Pol Pot, announced his support for the new government. On 9 October, the Cambodian monarchy was abolished, and the country was renamed the Khmer Republic. The new regime immediately demanded that the Vietnamese communists leave Cambodia.\n\nHanoi rejected the new republic's request for the withdrawal of NVA troops. In response, the United States moved to provide material assistance to the new government's armed forces, which were engaged against both CPK insurgents and NVA forces. The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces, desperate to retain their sanctuaries and supply lines from North Vietnam, immediately launched armed attacks on the new government. The North Vietnamese quickly overran large parts of eastern Cambodia, reaching to within {{convert|15|mi|km}} of [[Phnom Penh]]. The North Vietnamese turned the newly won territories over to the [[Khmer Rouge]]. The king urged his followers to help in overthrowing this government, hastening the onset of [[Cambodian Civil War|civil war]].<ref name=\"SIHNK\">{{Cite book| last = Sihanouk | first = Norodom | authorlink = Norodom Sihanouk | title = My War with the CIA: The Memoirs of Prince Norodom Sihanouk as Related to Wilfred Burchett | publisher=Pantheon Books | year = 1973| isbn = 0394485432}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1970, US President Richard Nixon announced to the American public that US and South Vietnamese ground forces had entered Cambodia in a campaign aimed at destroying NVA base areas in Cambodia (see [[Cambodian Incursion]]).<ref>Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' (Henry Holt & Co.: New York, 2004) p. 204.</ref> The US had already been bombing Vietnamese positions in Cambodia for well over a year by that point. Although a considerable quantity of equipment was seized or destroyed by US and South Vietnamese forces, containment of North Vietnamese forces proved elusive.\n\nThe Khmer Republic's leadership was plagued by disunity among its three principal figures: Lon Nol, Sihanouk's cousin [[Sirik Matak]], and National Assembly leader [[In Tam]]. Lon Nol remained in power in part because none of the others were prepared to take his place. In 1972, a constitution was adopted, a parliament elected, and Lon Nol became president. But disunity, the problems of transforming a 30,000-man army into a national combat force of more than 200,000 men, and spreading corruption weakened the civilian administration and army.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge insurgency inside Cambodia continued to grow, aided by supplies and military support from North Vietnam. Pol Pot and [[Ieng Sary]] asserted their dominance over the Vietnamese-trained communists, many of whom were purged. At the same time, the Khmer Rouge (CPK) forces became stronger and more independent of their Vietnamese patrons. By 1973, the CPK were fighting battles against government forces with little or no North Vietnamese troop support, and they controlled nearly 60% of Cambodia's territory and 25% of its population.\n\nThe government made three unsuccessful attempts to enter into negotiations with the insurgents, but by 1974, the CPK was operating openly as divisions, and some of the NVA combat forces had moved into South Vietnam. Lon Nol's control was reduced to small enclaves around the cities and main transportation routes. More than two million refugees from the war lived in Phnom Penh and other cities.\n\nOn New Year's Day 1975, Communist troops launched an offensive which, in 117 days of the hardest fighting of the war, caused the collapse of the Khmer Republic. Simultaneous attacks around the perimeter of Phnom Penh pinned down Republican forces, while other CPK units overran fire bases controlling the vital lower Mekong resupply route. A US-funded airlift of ammunition and rice ended when Congress refused additional aid for Cambodia. The Lon Nol government in Phnom Penh surrendered on 17 April 1975, just five days after the US mission evacuated Cambodia.<ref>Philip Short, ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'' p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe relationship between the massive carpet bombing of Cambodia by the United States and the growth of the Khmer Rouge, in terms of recruitment and popular support, has been a matter of interest to historians. Some historians have cited the US intervention and bombing campaign (spanning 1965\u20131973) as a significant factor leading to increased support of the Khmer Rouge among the Cambodian peasantry.

Remnants of the old society were abolished and religion was suppressed. Agriculture was collectivised, and the surviving part of the industrial base was abandoned or placed under state control. Cambodia had neither a currency nor a banking system.\n\nDemocratic Kampuchea's relations with Vietnam and Thailand worsened rapidly as a result of border clashes and ideological differences. While communist, the CPK was fiercely nationalistic, and most of its members who had lived in Vietnam were purged. Democratic Kampuchea established close ties with the People's Republic of China, and the Cambodian-Vietnamese conflict became part of the Sino-Soviet rivalry, with Moscow backing Vietnam. Border clashes worsened when the Democratic Kampuchea military attacked villages in Vietnam. The regime broke off relations with Hanoi in December 1977, protesting Vietnam's alleged attempt to create an Indochina Federation. In mid-1978, Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia, advancing about {{convert|30|mi|km}} before the arrival of the rainy season.\n\nThe reasons for Chinese support of the CPK was to prevent a pan-Indochina movement, and maintain Chinese military superiority in the region. The Soviet Union supported a strong Vietnam to maintain a second front against China in case of hostilities and to prevent further Chinese expansion. Since Stalin's death, relations between Mao-controlled China and the Soviet Union had been lukewarm at best. In February to March 1979, China and Vietnam would fight the brief [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] over the issue.\n\nIn December 1978, Vietnam announced the formation of the [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation]] (KUFNS) under [[Heng Samrin]], a former DK division commander. It was composed of Khmer Communists who had remained in Vietnam after 1975 and officials from the eastern sector\u2014like Heng Samrin and Hun Sen\u2014who had fled to Vietnam from Cambodia in 1978. In late December 1978, Vietnamese forces launched a full invasion of Cambodia, capturing Phnom Penh on 7 January 1979 and driving the remnants of Democratic Kampuchea's army westward toward Thailand.\n\nWithin the CPK, the Paris-educated leadership\u2014[[Pol Pot]], [[Ieng Sary]], [[Nuon Chea]], and [[Son Sen]]\u2014were in control. A new constitution in January 1976 established Democratic Kampuchea as a Communist People's Republic, and a 250-member Assembly of the Representatives of the People of Kampuchea (PRA) was selected in March to choose the collective leadership of a State Presidium, the chairman of which became the head of state.\n\nPrince Sihanouk resigned as head of state on 4 April. On 14 April, after its first session, the PRA announced that [[Khieu Samphan]] would chair the State Presidium for a 5-year term. It also picked a 15-member cabinet headed by Pol Pot as prime minister. Prince Sihanouk was put under virtual house arrest.\n\n===Destruction and deaths caused by the regime===\n{{Main article|Cambodian genocide}}\n[[File:Choeungek2.JPG|left|thumb|Skulls of Khmer Rouge victims.]]\n20,000 people died of exhaustion or disease during the evacuation of [[Phnom Penh]] and its aftermath. Many of those forced to evacuate the cities were resettled in newly created villages, which lacked food, agricultural implements, and medical care. Many who lived in cities had lost the skills necessary for survival in an agrarian environment. Thousands starved before the first harvest. Hunger and malnutrition\u2014bordering on starvation\u2014were constant during those years. Most military and civilian leaders of the former regime who failed to disguise their pasts were executed.\n\nSome of the ethnicities in Cambodia, such as the [[Cham people|Cham]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] suffered specific and targeted and violent persecutions. To the point of some international sources referring to it as the \"Cham genocide\". Entire families and towns were targeted and attacked with the goal of significantly diminishing their numbers and eventually eliminated them. Life in 'Democratic Kampuchea' was strict and brutal. In many areas of the country people were rounded up and executed for speaking a foreign language, wearing glasses, scavenging for food, absent for government assigned work, and even crying for dead loved ones. Former businessmen and bureaucrats were hunted down and killed along with their entire families; the Khmer Rouge feared that they held beliefs that could lead them to oppose their regime. A few Khmer Rouge loyalists were even killed for failing to find enough 'counter-revolutionaries' to execute.\n\nWhen Cambodian socialists began to rebel in the eastern zone of Cambodia, [[Pol Pot]] ordered his armies to exterminate 1.5 million eastern Cambodians which he branded as \"Cambodians with Vietnamese minds\" in the area.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Genocide: Vol. 1-|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Q30HcvCVuIC&pg=PA132|year=1999|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-87436-928-1|pages=132\u2013}}</ref> The purge was done speedily and efficiently as Pol Pot's soldiers quickly killed at least more than 100,000 to 250,000 eastern Cambodians right after deporting them to execution site locations in Central, North and North-Western Zones within a month's time,<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=2BTRtIv1_B8C&pg=PT435 | title=Pol Pot: The History of a Nightmare | page=435 | author=Philip Short}}</ref> making it the most bloodiest episode of mass murder under Pol Pot's regime\n\nReligious institutions were not spared by the Khmer Rouge as well, in fact [[religion]] was so viciously persecuted to such a terrifying extent that the vast majority of [[Khmer architecture|Cambodia's historic architecture]], 95% of Cambodia's Buddhist temples, was completely destroyed.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=la4kBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT23 | title=The Worst World Disasters of All Time | author=Kevin Baker | page=23}}</ref>\n\nModern research has located 20,000 mass graves from the Khmer Rouge era all over Cambodia.

To the east the rivers flow into the Tonle Sap, as in the south-west rivers flow into the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. Toward the southern slopes of the Elephant Mountains, small rivers flow south-eastward on the eastern side of the divide.\n\nThe Mekong River flows southward from the Cambodia-Laos border to a point south of [[Krati\u00e9 (town)]], where it turns west for about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} and then turns southwest towards Phnom Penh. Extensive rapids run north of [[Krati\u00e9 (town)|Kratie city]]. From [[Kampong Cham Province]] the gradient slopes very gently, and inundation of areas along the river occurs at flood stage. From June through November\u2014through breaks in the natural [[levee]]s that have built up along its course. At Phnom Penh four major water courses meet at a point called the Chattomukh (Four Faces). The Mekong River flows in from the northeast and the Tonle Sap river emanates from the Tonle Sap\u2014flows in from the northwest. They divide into two parallel channels, the Mekong River proper and the [[Bassac River]], and flow independently through the delta areas of Cambodia and Vietnam to the [[South China Sea]].\n\nThe flow of water into the Tonle Sap is seasonal. In spring, the flow of the Mekong River, fed by monsoon rains, increases to a point where its outlets through the delta can't handle the enormous volume of water. At this point, the water pushes northward up the Tonle Sap river and empties into the Tonle Sap lake, thereby increasing the size of the lake from about {{convert|2590|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} to about {{convert|24605|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} at the height of the flooding. After the Mekong's waters crest \u2014 when its downstream channels can handle the volume of water \u2014 the flow reverses, and water flows out of the engorged lake.\n\nAs the level of the Tonle Sap retreats, it deposits a new layer of sediment.

The {{convert|541|km|mi|abbr=on}} border with Laos and the {{convert|1228|km|mi|abbr=on}} border with Vietnam result from French administrative decisions and do not follow major natural features.

By 1950, it had increased to between 3,710,107 and 4,073,967, and in 1962 it had reached 5.7 million. From the 1960s until 1975, the population of Cambodia increased by about 2.2% yearly, the lowest increase in [[Southeast Asia]]. By 1975 when the [[Khmer Rouge]] took power, it was estimated at 7.3 million. Of this total an estimated one to two million reportedly died between 1975 and 1978. In 1981, the PRK gave the official population figure as nearly 6.7 million, although approximately 6.3 million to 6.4 million is probably more accurate. The average annual rate of population growth from 1978 to 1985 was 2.3% (see table 2, Appendix A). A post-Khmer Rouge baby boom pushed the population above 10 million, although growth has slowed in recent years.\n\nIn 1959, about 45% of the population was under 15 years of age. By 1962, this had increased slightly to 46%. In 1962, an estimated 52% of the population was between 15 and 64 years of age, while 2% were older than 65. The percentage of males and females in the three groups was almost the same.\n\n===Population and age distribution<ref name=\"WPP 2010\">[http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision]</ref>===\n[[File:Pyramide Cambodge.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Cambodian Population Pyramid-2005]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! width=\"80pt\"|Total population (thousands)\n! width=\"80pt\"|Population aged 0\u201314 (%)\n! width=\"80pt\"|Population aged 15\u201364 (%)\n! width=\"80pt\"|Population aged 65+ (%)\n|-\n| 1950\n| align=\"right\" | 4 346\n| align=\"right\" | 42.2\n| align=\"right\" | 55.1\n| align=\"right\" | 2.7\n|-\n| 1955\n| align=\"right\" | 4 840\n| align=\"right\" | 42.3\n| align=\"right\" | 55.0\n| align=\"right\" | 2.7\n|-\n| 1960\n| align=\"right\" | 5 433\n| align=\"right\" | 42.5\n| align=\"right\" | 54.8\n| align=\"right\" | 2.7\n|-\n| 1965\n| align=\"right\" | 6 141\n| align=\"right\" | 42.8\n| align=\"right\" | 54.4\n| align=\"right\" | 2.7\n|-\n| 1970\n| align=\"right\" | 6 938\n| align=\"right\" | 43.2\n| align=\"right\" | 54.0\n| align=\"right\" | 2.8\n|-\n| 1975\n| align=\"right\" | 7 308\n| align=\"right\" | 42.3\n| align=\"right\" | 54.9\n| align=\"right\" | 2.8\n|-\n| 1980\n| align=\"right\" | 6 306\n| align=\"right\" | 39.0\n| align=\"right\" | 58.1\n| align=\"right\" | 2.9\n|-\n| 1985\n| align=\"right\" | 7 920\n| align=\"right\" | 42.1\n| align=\"right\" | 55.0\n| align=\"right\" | 2.9\n|-\n| 1990\n| align=\"right\" | 9 532\n| align=\"right\" | 43.8\n| align=\"right\" | 53.4\n| align=\"right\" | 2.8\n|-\n| 1995\n| align=\"right\" | 11 169\n| align=\"right\" | 47.5\n| align=\"right\" | 49.7\n| align=\"right\" | 2.8\n|-\n| 2000\n| align=\"right\" | 12 447\n| align=\"right\" | 41.6\n| align=\"right\" | 55.4\n| align=\"right\" | 3.0\n|-\n| 2005\n| align=\"right\" | 13 358\n| align=\"right\" | 36.4\n| align=\"right\" | 60.3\n| align=\"right\" | 3.3\n|-\n| 2010\n| align=\"right\" | 14 138\n| align=\"right\" | 31.9\n| align=\"right\" | 64.3\n| align=\"right\" | 3.8\n|}\n\n=== Structure of the population<ref>http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2.htm</ref> ===\n\nStructure of the population (01.07.2013) (Estimates) (Excluding foreign diplomatic personnel and their dependants.

Under-five mortality rates have also decreased from 124 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000, 83 deaths in 2005 to 54 deaths per 1,000 in 2010.\n\nChildhood mortality decreases markedly with mother\u2019s education and wealth. Infant mortality, for example, is twice as high among children whose mothers have no schooling compared to those with secondary or higher education (72 versus 31). The association with wealth is even stronger. There are 77 deaths per 1,000 live births among infants from the poorest households compared to only 23 deaths per 1,000 live births among infants from the richest households.\n\nMortality rates are much higher in rural than urban areas. Infant mortality, for example, is 64 deaths per 1,000 live births in rural areas compared to only 22 in urban areas.\nMortality also differs by province. Infant mortality ranges from only 13 deaths per 1,000 live births in Phnom Penh to 78 deaths per 1,000 live births in Kampong Chhnang and Svay Rieng.\n\n===Life expectancy===\nIn 1959, life expectancy at birth was 44.2 years for males and 43.3 years for females. By 1970, life expectancy had increased by about 2.5 years since 1945. The greater [[longevity]] for females apparently reflected improved health practices during [[maternity]] and childbirth.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Period\n!Life expectancy in\nYears\n!Period\n!Life expectancy in\nYears\n|-\n|1950\u20131955\n|40.3\n|1985\u20131990\n|52.0\n|-\n|1955\u20131960\n|41.1\n|1990\u20131995\n|54.3\n|-\n|1960\u20131965\n|41.4\n|1995\u20132000\n|56.4\n|-\n|1965\u20131970\n|42.0\n|2000\u20132005\n|60.8\n|-\n|1970\u20131975\n|37.8\n|2005\u20132010\n|65.1\n|-\n|1975\u20131980\n|14.5\n|2010\u20132015\n|67.6\n|-\n|1980\u20131985\n|52.0\n|\n|\n|}\nSource: ''UN World Population Prospects''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DataQuery/|title=World Population Prospects \u2013 Population Division \u2013 United Nations|last=|date=|year=|publisher=|pages=|language=|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=2017-07-15|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}</ref>\n\n==Ethnic groups==\n{{See|Ethnic groups in Cambodia}}\n[[File:Cambodia ethnic map.svg|thumb|450px|An ethnic map of Cambodia from 1972.]]\n\nThe largest of the ethnic groups in Cambodia are the [[Khmer people|Khmer]], who comprise approximately 90% of the total population and primarily inhabit the lowland Mekong subregion and the central plains.\n\nThe Khmer historically have lived near the [[Mekong River|lower Mekong River]] in a contiguous arc that runs from the southern [[Khorat Plateau]] where modern-day [[Thailand]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] meet in the northeast, stretching southwest through the lands surrounding [[Tonle Sap]] lake to the [[Cardamom Mountains]], then continues back southeast to the mouth of the Mekong River in southeastern [[Vietnam]].\n\nEthnic groups in Cambodia other than the politically and socially dominant Khmer are classified as either \"indigenous ethnic minorities\" or \"non-indigenous ethnic minorities\". The indigenous ethnic minorities, more commonly collectively referred to as the [[Khmer Loeu]] (\"upland Khmer\"), constitute the majority in the remote mountainous provinces of [[Ratanakiri Province|Ratanakiri]], [[Mondulkiri Province|Mondulkiri]] and [[Stung Treng Province|Stung Treng]] and are present in substantial numbers in [[Kratie Province]].\n\nApproximately 17-21 separate ethnic groups, most of whom speak [[Austroasiatic languages]] related to [[Khmer language|Khmer]], are included in the Khmer Loeu designation, including the [[Kuy people|Kuy]] and [[Tampuan people]]. These peoples are considered by the Khmer to be the aboriginal inhabitants of the land. Two of these highland groups, the [[Rade people|Rade]] and the [[Jarai people|Jarai]], are [[Chamic peoples]] who speak [[Austronesian languages]] descended from ancient [[Cham language|Cham]]. These indigenous ethnic minorities haven't integrated into Khmer culture and follow their traditional animist beliefs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"line-height:0.9em; border:1px black; float:right; margin-right:1em; margin:10px\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:140px;\"| [[Ethnic group]] !!

The [[Chinese people|Chinese]] have immigrated to Cambodia from different regions of China throughout Cambodia's history, integrating into Cambodian society and today Chinese Cambodians or Cambodians of mixed Sino-Khmer ancestry dominate the business community, politics and the media. The Cham are descendants of refugees from the various wars of the historical kingdom of [[Champa]]. The Cham live amongst the Khmer in the central plains but in contrast to the Khmer who are Theravada Buddhists, the vast majority of Cham follow Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambodia-travel.com/information/ethnic-groups.htm |title=Cambodia Ethnic Groups |publisher=Cambodia-travel.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-02}}</ref>\n\nThere are also small numbers of other minority groups.

Two of these members are appointed by the King, two are elected by the lower house of the government, and the remaining fifty-seven are elected popularly by \"functional constituencies.\"  Members in this house serve a six-year term.\n\nThe official duty of the Parliament is to legislate and make laws.  Bills passed by the Parliament are given to the King who gives the proposed bills [[royal assent]].  The King does not have [[veto]] power over bills passed by the National Assembly and thus, cannot withhold royal assent.  The National Assembly also has the power to dismiss the Prime Minister and his government by a two-thirds [[vote of no confidence]].\n\n===Senate===\n\nThe upper house of the Cambodian legislature is called the ''Senate''. It consists of sixty-one members.  Two of these members are appointed by the King, two are elected by the lower house of the government, and the remaining fifty-seven are elected popularly by electors from provincial and local governments, in a similar fashion to the [[Senate of France]]. Members in this house serve six-year terms.\n\nPrior to 2006, elections had last been held for the Senate in 1999. New elections were supposed to have occurred in 2004, but these elections were initially postponed. On January 22, 2006, 11,352 possible voters went to the poll and chose their candidates.

However, in reality, the judicial branch in Cambodia is highly corrupt and often serves as a tool of the executive branch to silence civil society and its leaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/cambod12269.htm|title=Essential Background: Overview of human rights issues in Cambodia |website=Human Rights Watch|date=31 December 2005}}</ref> There are currently 17 justices on the Supreme Council.\n\n==Monarchy==\n[[File:Norodom king of Cambodia.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[King]] [[Norodom Sihamoni]]]]\nCambodia is a [[constitutional monarchy]], i.e. the King reigns but does not rule, in similar fashion to Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]].

Under the Constitution, the King has no political power, but as Norodom Sihanouk was revered in the country, his word often carried much influence in the government.  While such views are not prevalent in Cambodia, his word was respected by his subjects. The King, often irritated over the conflicts in his government, several times threatened to abdicate unless the political factions in the government got along. This put pressure on the government to solve their differences.  This influence of the King was often used to help mediate differences in government.\n\nAfter the abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk in 2004, he was succeeded by his son [[Norodom Sihamoni]]. While the retired King was highly revered in his country for dedicating his lifetime to Cambodia, the current King has spent most of his life abroad in [[France]]. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the new King's views will be as highly respected as his father's.\n\nAlthough in the [[Khmer language]] there are many words meaning \"king\", the word officially used in Khmer (as found in the 1993 Cambodian Constitution) is ''preahm\u00e2haksat'' (Khmer regular script:[[Image:Seihamuni11.png|80px]]), which literally means: ''preah''- (\"sacred\", cognate of the Indian word [[Brahmin]]) -''m\u00e2ha''- (from [[Sanskrit]], meaning \"great\", cognate with \"maha-\" in [[maharaja]]) -''ksat'' (\"warrior, ruler\", cognate of the Indian word [[Kshatriya]]).\n\nOn the occasion of HM King Norodom Sihanouk's retirement in September 2004, the Cambodian National Assembly coined a new word for the retired king: ''preahm\u00e2haviraksat'' (Khmer regular script:[[Image:Sihanouk6.png|90px]]), where ''vira'' comes from Sanskrit ''v\u012bra'', meaning \"brave or eminent man, hero, chief\", cognate of [[Latin]] ''vir'', ''viris'', [[English language|English]] ''virile''. ''Preahm\u00e2haviraksat'' is translated in English as \"King-Father\" ({{lang-fr|Roi-P\u00e8re}}), although the word \"father\" does not appear in the Khmer noun.\n\nAs ''preahm\u00e2haviraksat'', Norodom Sihanouk retained many of the prerogatives he formerly held as ''preahm\u00e2haksat'' and was a highly respected and listened-to figure. Thus, in effect, Cambodia could be described as a country with two Kings during Sihanouk's lifetime: the one who was the Head of State, the ''preahm\u00e2haksat'' Norodom Sihamoni, and the one who was not the Head of State, the ''preahm\u00e2haviraksat'' Norodom Sihanouk.\n\nSihanouk died of a pulmonary infarction on October 15, 2012.\n\n===Succession to the throne===\nUnlike most monarchies, Cambodia's monarchy is not necessarily [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary]] and the King is not allowed to select his own heir.  Instead, a new King is chosen by a Royal Council of the Throne, consisting of the president of the National Assembly, the Prime Minister, the President of the Senate, the First and Second Vice Presidents of the Senate, the Chiefs of the orders of [[Buddhism in Cambodia#Cambodian adaptations|Mohanikay and Thammayut]], and the First and Second Vice-President of the Assembly.  The Royal Council meets within a week of the King's death or abdication and selects a new King from a pool of candidates with royal blood.\n\nIt has been suggested that Cambodia's ability to peacefully appoint a new King shows that Cambodia's government has stabilized incredibly from the situation the country was in during the 1970s (see [[History of Cambodia]]).\n\n==International organization participation==\nACCT, [[Asian Development Bank|AsDB]], [[ASEAN]], ESCAP, FAO, G-77, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, [[International Criminal Court|ICC]], ICRM, IDA, IFAD, IFC, IFRCS, ILO, IMF, IMO, Intelsat (nonsignatory user), [[International Monetary Fund]], Interpol, IOC, ISO (subscriber), ITU, NAM, OPCW, PCA, [[United Nations|UN]], UNCTAD, [[UNESCO]], UNIDO, UPU, [[World Bank|WB]], WFTU, WHO, WIPO, WMO, [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], WToO, WTrO (applicant)\n\n=== International rankings ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Imports increased due to the influx of foreign aid, and exports, particularly from the country's garment industry, also increased.\n\nAfter four years of improving economic performance, Cambodia's economy slowed in 1997\u20131998 due to the regional economic crisis, civil unrest, and political infighting. [[Foreign direct investment|Foreign investment]]s declined during this period. Also, in 1998 the main harvest was hit by drought. But in 1999, the first full year of relative peace in 30 years, progress was made on economic reforms and growth resumed at 4%.\n\nCurrently, Cambodia's foreign policy focuses on establishing friendly borders with its neighbors (such as [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]]), as well as integrating itself into regional ([[ASEAN]]) and global ([[WTO]]) trading systems. Some of the obstacles faced by this emerging economy are the need for a better education system and the lack of a skilled workforce; particularly in the [[poverty]]-ridden countryside, which struggles with inadequate basic [[infrastructure]]. Nonetheless, Cambodia continues to attract investors because of its low wages, plentiful labor, proximity to Asian raw materials, and favorable tax treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joosung J.|title=An Outlook for Cambodia's Garment Industry in the Post-Safeguard Policy Era|journal=Asian Survey|date=May\u2013June 2011|volume=51|issue=3|pages=559\u2013580|jstor=10.1525/as.2011.51.3.559|doi=10.1525/as.2011.51.3.559}}</ref>\n\n==Recent economic history==\n{{main|Economic history of Cambodia}}\nFollowing its independence from France in 1953, the Cambodian state has undergone five periods of political, social, and economic transformation:\n# [[Kingdom of Cambodia (1953\u20131970)|Kingdom of Cambodia]] (1953-1970)\n# [[Khmer Republic]] (1970\u20131975)\n# [[Democratic Kampuchea]] (1975-1982, ousted in 1979); became [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]] in exile (1982-1993)\n# [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] (1979-1989), later renamed The State of Cambodia (1989 to 1993) \n# Kingdom of [[Cambodia]] (1993\u2013present)\n\nIn 1989, the State of Cambodia implemented reform policies that transformed the Cambodian economic system from a [[command economy]] to an open market one.<ref name=\"Chheang 2008 282\">{{cite journal|last=Chheang|first=Vannarith|title=The Political Economy of Tourism in Cambodia|journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research|date=September 2008|volume=13|issue=3|pages=282|doi=10.1080/10941660802280414}}</ref> In line with the economic reformation, private property rights were introduced and state-owned enterprises were privatized. Cambodia also focused on integrating itself into regional and international economic blocs, such as the [[Association of South East Asian Nations]] and the [[World Trade Organization]] respectively. These policies triggered a growth in the economy, with its national GDP growing at an average of 6.1% before a period of domestic unrest and regional economic instability in 1997 ([[1997 Asian financial crisis]]).<ref name=\"Chheang 2008 282\"/> However, conditions improved and since 1999, the Cambodian economy has continued to grow at an average pace of approximately 6-8% per annum.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Un|first=Kheang|title=A Thin Veneer of Change|journal=Asian Survey|date=January 2012|volume=52|issue=1|pages=202\u2013209|jstor=10.1525/as.2012.52.1.202|doi=10.1525/as.2012.52.1.202}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Cambodia's [[gross domestic product]] grew by an estimated 18.6%. Garment exports rose by almost 8%, while tourist arrivals increased by nearly 35%. With exports decreasing, the 2007 GDP growth was driven largely by consumption and investment. [[Foreign direct investment]] (FDI) inflows reached US$600 million (7 percent of GDP), slightly more than what the country received in official aid. Domestic investment, driven largely by the private sector, accounted for 23.4 percent of GDP. Export growth, especially to the US, began to slow in late 2007 accompanied by stiffer competition from Vietnam and emerging risks (a slowdown in the US economy and lifting of safeguards on China\u2019s exports). US companies were the fifth largest investors in Cambodia, with more than $1.2 billion in investments over the period 1997-2007.\n\nCambodia was severely hit by the [[2008 economic crisis]] (refer to table below), and its main economic sector, the garment industry, suffered a 23% drop in exports to the United States and Europe.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joosung J .|title=An Outlook for Cambodia's Garment Industry in the Post-Safeguard Policy Era|journal=Asian Survey|date=May\u2013June 2011|volume=51|issue=3|pages=570|jstor=10.1525/as.2011.51.3.559|doi=10.1525/as.2011.51.3.559}}</ref> As a result, 60,000 workers were laid off. However, in the last quarter of 2009 and early 2010, conditions were beginning to improve and the Cambodian economy began to recover. Cambodian exports to the US for the first 11 months of 2012 reached $2.49 billion, a 1 per cent increase year-on-year. Its imports of US goods grew 26 per cent for that period, reaching $213 million. Another factor underscoring the potential of the Cambodian economy is the recent halving of its poverty rate. The poverty rate is 20.5 per cent, meaning that approximately 2.8 million people live below the poverty line.\n\nThe table below represents the fluctuations in Cambodia's economy over the period from 2004\u20132011 (2012 data is not yet available).<ref>{{cite web|title=Cambodia|url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/cambodia|work=The World Bank Group|accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|-\n!

Agriculture accounted for 90 percent of [[GDP]] in 1985 and employed approximately 80 percent of the work force. [[Rice]] is the principle commodity.\n\nMajor secondary crops include [[maize]], [[cassava]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[Bambara groundnut|groundnuts]], [[soybean]]s, [[sesame seed]]s, dry beans, and [[rubber]]. The principal commercial crop is rubber. In the 1980s it was an important primary commodity, second only to rice, and one of the country's few sources of foreign exchange.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{Further|Tourism in Cambodia}}\nIn the 1960s, Cambodia was a prominent tourist destination in the [[Southeast Asia]]n region. Due to protracted periods of civil war, insurgencies, and especially the genocidal regime of the Khmer Rouge (see [[Khmer Rouge Genocide]]), Cambodia's tourism industry was reduced to being virtually non-existent. Since the late 1990s, tourism is fast becoming Cambodia's second largest industry, just behind the garment manufacturing.<ref name=\"Chheang 284\">{{cite journal|last=Chheang|first=Vannarith|title=The Political Economy of Tourism in Cambodia|pages=284}}</ref> In 2006, Cambodia's tourism sector generated a revenue of US$1.594 billion, which made up approximately 16% of the country's GDP.<ref name=\"Chheang 284\"/>\n\n[[File:Angkor Wat.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Angkor Wat]] in Siem Reap, Cambodia.]]\nCultural heritage tourism is especially popular in the country, with many foreign tourists visiting the ancient Hindu temple of [[Angkor Wat]] located in the [[Siem Reap]] province. Other popular tourist attractions include the [[Royal Palace, Phnom Penh]], as well as ecotourism spots such as [[Tonl\u00e9 Sap]] Lake and the [[Mekong]] River.\n\nThe tourism industry in Cambodia has been perpetuated by the development of important transportation infrastructure; in particular Cambodia's two international airports in [[Phnom Penh]] and [[Siem Reap]] respectively. To the Cambodian economy, tourism has been a means for accumulation of foreign currency earnings and employment for the Cambodian workforce, with about 250,000 jobs generated in 2006.<ref name=\"Chheang 284\"/> Meanwhile, challenges to the industry include a leakage of revenue to foreign markets due to a dependence on foreign goods as well as the prevalence of the [[Child sex tourism]] industry.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chheang|first=Vannarith|title=The Political Economy of Tourism in Cambodia|pages=293}}</ref>\n\n=== Gambling industry ===\n{{main|Gambling in Cambodia}}\nThe gambling industry of Cambodia supports its tourism industry, which is mostly concentrated around the Siem Reap province. The introduction of casino on border cities and towns created an industry that has thrived and contributed to the generation of employment and a steady stream of revenue for the government. However, the issue of corruption in relation to the government bureaucratic process involved in the gambling sector has been raised. It has likewise spur growth in different parts of the country at border crossing towns like Poipet, Bavet and Koh Kong. The growth of the gambling industry in Cambodia is due to its proximity to Thailand where gambling is forbidden.\n\n[[File:Russian Blvd, P.P..JPG|thumb|300px|Russian Boulevard in [[Phnom Penh]].]]\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe increase in tourist arrivals has led to growing demand for hotels and other forms of accommodation surrounding tourist hotspots. Siem Reap in particular has seen a construction boom in recent years. The capital Phnom Penh has also witnessed a growth in the construction and real estate sector. Recently, planned projects that have been on the pipeline for several years have been shelved temporarily due to a reduction in foreign investment.\nFrom 2009, the Cambodian government has allowed foreigners to own condominiums. This has helped in attracting real estate investors from [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and other countries.\n\nThe construction sector attracted investment of $2.1 billion in 2012 which is a 72 per cent rise compared with 2011. Construction licenses issued stood at 1,694 projects in 2012, which was 20% lower than 2011 but they were higher in value.\n\n=== Resources ===\n{{Further|Natural resources of Cambodia|Mineral industry in Cambodia}}\n\n[[Petroleum seep|Oil seeps]] were discovered in Cambodia as early as the 1950s by Russian and Chinese geologists. Development of the industry was delayed, however, by the [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]] and [[Cambodian Civil War]]s and the political uncertainty that followed. Further discoveries of oil and natural gas deposits offshore in the early 2000s led to renewed domestic and international interest in Cambodia's production possibilities. As of 2013, the US company [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], Japanese [[Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation|JOGMEC]] and other international companies maintained production sites both on shore and off.

There is some evidence of expansion in value-added exports from a low starting point, largely thanks to the manufacture of electrical goods and telecommunications by foreign multinationals implanted in the country. Between 2008 and 2013, high-tech exports climbed from just US$3.8million to US$76.5 million.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIt will be challenging for Cambodia to enhance the technological capacity of the many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) active in agriculture, engineering and the natural sciences. Whereas the large foreign firms in Cambodia that are the main source of value-added exports tend to specialize in electrical machinery and telecommunications, the principal task for science and technology policy will be to facilitate spillovers in terms of skills and innovation capability from these large operators towards smaller firms and across other sectors.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Southeast Asia and Oceania.

In February and November, the government published two circulars, which, if implemented fully, would require Internet cafes to install surveillance cameras and restrict operations within major urban centers. Activists also reported concern about a draft \u201ccybercrimes\u201d law, noting that it could be used to restrict online freedoms. The government maintained it would only regulate criminal activity.<ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-2012>[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&dlid=204192 \"Cambodia\"], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 21 March 2013. Retrieved 24 October 2013.</ref>\n\nThe constitution provides for freedom of speech and press; however, these rights were not always respected in practice. The 1995 press law prohibits prepublication censorship or imprisonment for expressing opinions; however, the government uses the penal code to prosecute citizens on defamation, disinformation, and incitement charges. The penal code does not prescribe imprisonment for defamation, but does for incitement or spreading disinformation, which carry prison sentences of up to three years. Judges also can order fines, which may lead to jail time if not paid. The constitution requires that free speech not adversely affect public security.<ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-2012/> \n\nThe constitution declares that the king is \u201cinviolable,\u201d and a Ministry of Interior directive conforming to the defamation law reiterates these limits and prohibits publishers and editors from disseminating stories that insult or defame government leaders and institutions. The continued criminalization of defamation and disinformation and a broad interpretation of criminal incitement constrains freedom of expression.<ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-2012/> \n\nThe law provides for the privacy of residence and correspondence and prohibits illegal searches; however, NGOs report that police routinely conduct searches and seizures without warrants.<ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-2012/> \n\nCorruption remains pervasive and governmental human rights bodies are generally ineffective. A weak judiciary that sometimes fails to provide due process or fair trial procedures is a serious problem. The courts lack human and financial resources and, as a result, are not truly independent and are subject to corruption and political influence.<ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-2012/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cambodia}}\n* [[Media of Cambodia]]\n* [[Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Cambodia]]\n\n==References==\n{{CIA World Factbook}}\n{{Reflist |32em}}\n\n==External links==\n\n* [https://www.cambopedia.com/isp-internet-service-provider-home-office-businesses-cambodia/ Internet Providers in Cambodia] \n* [https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-best-internet-providers-in-Phnom-Penh-Cambodia Which are the best internet providers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia?]\n* [http://www.mptc.gov.kh/ Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications] \n* [http://www.tc.com.kh/ Telecom Cambodia]\n* [http://www.asiawaves.net/cambodia-tv.htm Television stations in Cambodia]\n* [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2006-05/26/content_601595.htm \"3G phones banned in anti-porn drive\"], China Daily (Associated Press), 26 May 2006.

The country's weak [[infrastructure]] hindered emergency relief efforts and created tremendous problems of procurement of supplies in general and of distribution. Cambodia received [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] technical assistance and equipment to support the maintenance of the [[transport network|transportation network]].\n==Road Transport==\n[[File:Bottles of gasoline Bbang.jpg|thumb|300px|Bottles of gasoline on sale in [[Battambang Province|Battambang]].]]\n\n=== Highway Network ===\n\n* Total - 38,257&nbsp;km (2004)\n* Paved - 2,406&nbsp;km (2004)\n* Unpaved - 35,851&nbsp;km (2004)\nOf the current total, only about 50 percent of the [[road]]s and [[highway]]s were covered with [[asphalt]] and were in good condition; about 50 percent of the roads were made of crushed stone, [[gravel]], or improved earth; and the remaining approximately 30 percent were unimproved earth or were little more than tracks. In 1981 [[Cambodia]] opened a newly repaired section of National Route 1 which runs southeast from [[Phnom Penh]] to the Vietnamese border. The road, which suffered damage during the war years, was restored most probably by Vietnamese army engineers. \n\nIn the late 1980s, Cambodia's road network was both underutilized and unable to meet even the modest demands placed upon it by an unindustrialized and [[agrarian society]] (see fig. 8.). Commercial vehicles, such as trucks and [[bus]]es, were insufficient in number and lacked the [[Auto part|spare parts]] necessary to keep them running. Road construction and maintenance were ignored by a financially hard-pressed government, while [[Insurgency|insurgent]]s regularly destroyed [[bridge]]s and rendered some routes unsafe for travel.\n\nCambodia is upgrading the main highways to international standards and most are vastly improved from 2006. Most main roads are now paved. And now road construction is on going from the [[Thailand]] border at [[Poipet]] to [[Siem Reap]] ([[Angkor Wat]]).\n\nChart of 01/2014\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Cyclos are unique to Cambodia in that the cyclist is situated behind the passenger(s) seat, as opposed to Cycle rickshaws in neighbouring countries where the cyclist is at the front and \"pulls\" the carriage. With 78% mobile phone penetration rate, ride-hailing apps have become popular in recent years, thanks to the market entry of global and regional players such as Uber (no longer available in Cambodia) and Grab (which is currently the dominant player).\n\n==Railways==\n{{main|Rail transport in Cambodia}}\nTwo rail lines exist, both originating in Phnom Penh and totaling about 612 kilometers of 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3\u20448 in) metre gauge single track. A third line is planned to connect Phnom Penh with Vietnam,{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} the last missing link of the planned rail corridor between Singapore and the city of Kunming, China. A new north-south line is also planned. The active part of the network is the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville line, with stops at Takeo and Kampot.\n\n==Waterways==\n\nThe nation's extensive inland [[waterway]]s were important historically in domestic trade. The [[Mekong]] and the [[Tonl\u00e9 Sap River]]s, their numerous tributaries, and the [[Tonl\u00e9 Sap]] provided avenues of considerable length, including 3,700 kilometers navigable all year by craft drawing 0.6 meters and another 282 kilometers navigable to craft drawing 1.8 meters. In some areas, especially west of the Mekong River and north of the Tonle Sap River, the villages were completely dependent on waterways for communications. Launches, [[junk (ship)|junk]]s, or [[barge]]s transport passengers, [[rice]], and other food in the absence of roads and railways.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Communications, Transport, and Posts, Cambodia's main [[ferry]] services crossing the [[Bassac River]] and the middle Mekong River at [[Neak Leung Ferry Service]], [[Tonle Bet Ferry Service]], [[Sre Ambel Ferry Service]], [[Kampong Cham Ferry Service]], and [[Stoeng Treng Ferry Service]] were restored in 1985. The major Mekong River navigation routes also were cleared for traffic.\nAlso seaplane service to all waterways and islands in now offered by [[Aero Cambodia Airline]].\n\n==Seaports and harbors==\n[[File:Ferry across the Mekong River in Neak Leung.jpg|thumb|300px|A ferry taking vehicles and passengers across the [[Mekong]] to [[Neak Leung]] town.]]\n\nCambodia has two major ports, [[Phnom Penh Port]] and [[Sihanoukville Port]], also known as Kampong Som, and five minor ones. Phnom Penh, located at the junction of the [[Bassac River|Bassac]], the Mekong, and the Tonle Sap rivers, is the only [[river port]] capable of receiving 8,000-ton ships during the wet season and 5,000-ton ships during the dry season. It remains an important port for international commerce as well as for domestic communications.\n\nSihanoukville port reopened in late 1979. It had been built in 1960 with French assistance. In 1980 some 180 Soviet dockworkers, having brought with them forklifts and trucks, were reportedly working at Kampong Som as longshoremen or as instructors of unskilled Cambodian port workers. By 1984 approximately 1,500 Cambodian port workers were handling 2,500 tons of cargo per day. According to official statistics, Sihanoukville had handled only 769,500 tons in the four prior years (1979 to 1983), a level that contrasted sharply with the port's peacetime capacity of about 1 million tons of cargo per year.\n\n==Merchant marine==\n* total - 626 [[ship]]s ({{GRT|1,000|disp=long}} or over) totaling {{GRT|953,105}}/{{DWT|1,345,766|metric|disp=long}}\n* ships by type - [[bulk carrier]] 41, [[cargo]] 530, [[carrier (ship)|carrier]] 3, [[chemical tanker]] 10, [[container ship]] 8, [[passenger ship]]/cargo 6, [[oil tanker|petroleum tanker]] 11, refrigerated cargo 15, [[roll-on/roll-off]] 1, [[vehicle carrier]] 1 (2008)\n* note - 467 foreign-owned: [[Canada]] 2, [[People's Republic of China|China]] 193, [[Cyprus]] 7, [[Egypt]] 13, [[Gabon]] 1, [[Greece]] 3, [[Hong Kong]] 8, [[Indonesia]] 22, [[Japan]] 1, [[South Korea]] 22, [[Latvia]] 1, [[Lebanon]] 8, [[Netherlands]] 1, [[Romania]] 1, [[Russia]] 83, [[Singapore]] 4, [[Syria]] 48, [[Taiwan]] 1, [[Turkey]] 26, [[Ukraine]] 34, [[UAE]] 34, [[United States]] 6 (2008)\n\n==Airports==\n[[File:Siem reap airport.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Siem Reap International Airport]].]]\n\nThe country possesses twenty-six [[airfield]]s, of which only thirteen were usable in the mid-1980s. Eight airfields had permanent-surface runways. [[Phnom Penh International Airport]] in Phnom Penh is the largest airport; it also serves as the main base for the renascent [[Cambodian Air Force]].\n\nCambodia's second largest airport is [[Angkor International Airport]] in the major tourist city of [[Siem Reap]].  Tourist traffic into Angkor International Airport saw passenger numbers overtake those of Phnom Penh in 2006, the airport now being the country's busiest.\n\nCambodia also opened a new Soviet-built airfield at Ream, [[Sihanoukville International Airport]] in late 1983, which never saw commercial air traffic until now. There are additional airports in [[Battambang]] and [[Stung Treng]].\n\nThe new national airline [[Cambodia Angkor Air]] was launched in 2009, with a large financial investment from [[Vietnam Airlines]]. And [[Aero Cambodia Airline]] started business in 2011 offering flights to all airports and water ways with seaplanes.\n\n===Airports - with paved runways===\n''Total:''\n6\n<br />''2,500 to 3,000 m:''\n3\n<br />''1,500 to 2,2500 m:''\n2\n<br />''1000 to 1,500 m:''\n1 (2010)\n\n===Airports - with unpaved runways===\n\n''Total:''\n11\n<br>''1,500 to 2,500 m:''\n1\n<br>''1000 to 1,500 m:''\n9\n<br>''under 1000 m:''\n1 (2010)\n\n===Heliports===\n1 (2010)\n\n==See also==\n*[[State Secretariat of Civil Aviation]]\n*[[Ministry of Public Works and Transport, of Cambodia]]\n*[[Transport in Phnom Penh]]\n*[[Phnom Penh International Airport]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{CIA World Factbook}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://port.sihanoukville-cambodia.com/ The SihanoukVille Port]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5110236.stm Cambodians ride 'bamboo railway' ]\n* [http://www.globalcitizen.co.uk/wp/cambodia-cambodian-trains/ Video, photos and travel diary of Cambodia's trains by traveller Tom Grundy.]\n* [http://www.sihanoukville-cambodia.com/about-sihanoukville/airport.html The Sihanoukville Airport]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060825003757/http://www.cambodiaportal.com/index.php?mymenu=destinations&submenu=nationalroadnetwork&ext=Y&submenutitle=National%20Road%20Network National highways]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081119154405/http://www.ocm.gov.kh/c_inf3.htm Inland waterways in Cambodia]\n*[http://cambodiaa.com/directory/cambodia_bus.php Buses in Cambodia]\n*[http://www.sihanoukville-cambodia.com/about-sihanoukville/train-station.html SihanoukVille Train Station]\n\n{{Asia topic|Transport in}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2010}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Transport In Cambodia}}\n[[Category:Transport in Cambodia| ]]", "sha1": "td1xozqh18mgl0eai2yr9gfp2e9ic5e"}}, {"title": "Military of Cambodia", "ns": "0", "id": "5435", "redirect": {"title": "Royal Cambodian Armed Forces"}, "revision": {"id": "100162192", "parentid": "96529739", "timestamp": "2007-01-12T04:52:39Z", "contributor": {"ip": "203.97.106.191"}, "comment": "[[WP:AES|\u2190]]Redirected page to [[Royal Cambodian Armed Forces]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Royal Cambodian Armed Forces]]", "sha1": "axao6yurk6ltvs1pvvl7lyt6zaoza7k"}}, {"title": "Foreign relations of Cambodia", "ns": "0", "id": "5436", "revision": {"id": "861253122", "parentid": "852474508", "timestamp": "2018-09-26T04:34:03Z", "contributor": {"username": "GreenC bot", "id": "27823944"}, "comment": "Rescued 1 archive link; remove 1 link.

Based on Dravidian architecture, it was designed as a pyramid representing the structure of the universe: the highest level at the center of the temple represented [[Mount Meru]], the home of the Hindu gods, with the five towers on the highest level representing the five peaks of the mountain. The broad moat around the complex represented the oceans that surround the world.]]\n{{Culture of Cambodia}}\n\nIn '''Khmer architecture''' ({{lang-km|\u179f\u17d2\u1790\u17b6\u1794\u178f\u17d2\u1799\u1780\u1798\u17d2\u1798\u1781\u17d2\u1798\u17c2\u179a}}), the period of [[Angkor]] is the period in the history of the [[Khmer Empire]] from approximately the later half of the 8th century AD to the first half of the 15th century CE.\n\nIn any study of Angkorian architecture, the emphasis is necessarily on religious architecture, since all the remaining Angkorian buildings are religious in nature. During the period of Angkor, only temples and other religious buildings were constructed of stone. Non-religious buildings such as dwellings were constructed of perishable materials such as wood, and so have not survived.\n\nThe religious architecture of Angkor has characteristic structures, elements, and motifs, which are identified in the glossary below. Since a number of different architectural styles succeeded one another during the Angkorean period, not all of these features were equally in evidence throughout the period. Indeed, scholars have referred to the presence or absence of such features as one source of evidence for dating the remains.\n\n==Periodization==\n[[File:One of many temples in Sambor Prei Kuk.jpg|thumb|right|A temple in Sambor Prei Kuk]]\nMany temples had been built before Cambodia became a powerful Kingdom of [[Khmer Empire]] which dominated most of the [[Indochina]] region. At that time, Cambodia was known as [[Chenla]] kingdom, the predecessor state of Khmer empire. There are three pre-Angkorean architectural styles :<ref>''Ancient Angkor'' guide book, by Michael Freeman and Claude Jacques, p.30, published in 2003.</ref>\n* [[Sambor Prei Kuk]] style (610-650 AD): Sambor Prei Kuk also known as Isanapura where was the capital of [[Chenla Kingdom]]. Temples of Sambor Prei Kuk were built in round shape, plain colonettes with capitals that include a bulb.\n* [[Prei Khmeng]] style (635-700 AD): Structures reveal masterpieces of sculpture but architecture scarce. Colonettes are larger than previous style. Buildings were more heavily decorated but they had general decline of standards.\n* [[Kompong Preah]] style (700-800 AD): Temples with more decorative rings on colonettes which remain cylindrical. Brick constructions were being continued.\n\nScholars have worked to develop a periodization of Angkorean architectural styles. The following periods and styles may be distinguished. Each is named for a particular temple regarded as paradigmatic for the style.<ref>The periodization of Angkorean architecture presented here is based on that of Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', pp.30-31.</ref>\n* [[Phnom Kulen National Park|Kulen]] style (825-875 AD): Continuation of pre-Angkorean style but it was a period of innovation and borrowing such as from Cham temples. Tower is mainly square and relatively high as well as brick with laterite walls and stone door surrounds but square and octagonal colonettes begin to appear.\n* [[Preah Ko]] style (877-886 AD): [[Hariharalaya]] was the first capital city of the [[Khmer empire]] located in the area of Angkor; its ruins are in the area now called [[Roluos]] some fifteen kilometers southeast of the modern city of [[Siem Reap]]. The earliest surviving temple of [[Hariharalaya]] is Preah Ko; the others are [[Bakong]] and [[Lolei]]. The temples of the Preah Ko style are known for their small brick towers and for the great beauty and delicacy of their lintels.\n* [[Phnom Bakheng|Bakheng]] Style (889-923): Bakheng was the first temple mountain constructed in the area of Angkor proper north of Siem Reap. It was the state temple of King [[Yasovarman I|Yasovarman]], who built his capital of Yasodharapura around it. Located on a hill (phnom), it is currently one of the most endangered of the monuments, having become a favorite perch for tourists eager to witness a glorious sundown at Angkor.\n* [[Koh Ker]] Style (921-944): During the reign of King [[Jayavarman IV]], capital of Khmer empire was removed from Angkor region through the north which is called [[Koh Ker]]. The architectural style of temples in [[Koh Ker]], scale of buildings diminishes toward center. Brick still main material but sandstone also used.\n* [[Pre Rup]] Style (944-968): Under King [[Rajendravarman]], the Angkorian Khmer built the temples of [[Pre Rup]], [[East Mebon]] and [[Phimeanakas]]. Their common style is named after the state temple mountain of Pre Rup.\n* [[Banteay Srei]] Style (967-1000): Banteay Srei is the only major Angkorian temple constructed not by a monarch, but by a courtier. It is known for its small scale and the extreme refinement of its decorative carvings, including several famous narrative bas-reliefs dealing with scenes from Indian mythology.\n* [[Khleang]] Style (968-1010): The [[Khleang]] temples, first use of galleries. Cruciform gopuras. Octagonal colonettes. Restrained decorative carving. A few temples that were built in this style are [[Ta Keo]], [[Phimeanakas]].\n* [[Baphuon]] Style (1050\u20131080): Baphuon, the massive temple mountain of King [[Udayadityavarman II]] was apparently the temple that most impressed the Chinese traveller [[Zhou Daguan]], who visited Angkor toward the end of the 13th century. Its unique relief carvings have a naive dynamic quality that contrast with the rigidity of the figures typical of some other periods. As of 2008, Baphuon is under restoration and cannot currently be appreciated in its full magnificence.\n* Classical or [[Angkor Wat]] Style (1080\u20131175): Angkor Wat, the temple and perhaps the mausoleum of King [[Suryavarman II]], is the greatest of the Angkorian temples and defines what has come to be known as the classical style of Angkorian architecture. Other temples in this style are [[Banteay Samre]] and [[Thommanon]] in the area of [[Angkor]], and [[Phimai]] in modern [[Thailand]].\n* [[Bayon]] Style (1181\u20131243): In the final quarter of the 12th century, King [[Jayavarman VII]] freed the country of Angkor from occupation by an invasionary force from [[Champa]]. Thereafter, he began a massive program of monumental construction, paradigmatic for which was the state temple called the Bayon. The king's other foundations participated in the style of the Bayon, and included [[Ta Prohm]], [[Preah Khan]], [[Angkor Thom]], and [[Banteay Chmar]]. Though grandiose in plan and elaborately decorated, the temples exhibit a hurriedness of construction that contrasts with the perfection of Angkor Wat.\n* Post [[Bayon]] Style (1243\u20131431): Following the period of frantic construction under Jayavarman VII, Angkorian architecture entered the period of its decline. The 13th century [[Terrace of the Leper King]] is known for its dynamic relief sculptures of demon kings, dancers, and [[n\u0101ga]]s.\n\n==Materials==\nAngkorian builders used [[brick]], [[sandstone]], [[laterite]] and wood as their materials. The ruins that remain are of brick, sandstone and laterite, the wood elements having been lost to decay and other destructive processes.\n\n===Brick===\nThe earliest Angkorian temples were made mainly of brick. Good examples are the temple towers of [[Preah Ko]], [[Lolei]] and [[Bakong]] at [[Hariharalaya]]. Decorations were usually carved into a stucco applied to the brick, rather than into the brick itself.<ref>Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', p.27.</ref>\n\nAngkor's neighbor state of [[Champa]] was also the home to numerous brick temples that are similar in style to those of Angkor. The most extensive ruins are at [[M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n]] in [[Vietnam]]. A Cham story tells of the time that the two countries settled an armed conflict by means of a tower-building contest proposed by the Cham King [[Po klaung garai|Po Klaung Garai]]. While the Khmer built a standard brick tower, Po Klaung Garai directed his people to build an impressive replica of paper and wood. In the end, the Cham replica was more impressive than the real brick tower of the Khmer, and the Cham won the contest.<ref>Ng\u00f4 V\u01cen Doanh, ''Champa: Ancient Towers'', p.232.</ref>\n\n===Sandstone===\nThe only stone used by Angkorian builders was sandstone, obtained from the [[Phnom Kulen|Kulen mountains]]. Since its obtainment was considerably more expensive than that of brick, sandstone only gradually came into use, and at first was used for particular elements such as door frames. The 10th-century temple of [[Ta Keo]] is the first Angkorian temple to be constructed more or less entirely from Sandstone.<ref>Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', p.26.</ref>\n\n===Laterite===\nAngkorian builders used laterite, a clay that is soft when taken from the ground but that hardens when exposed to the sun, for foundations and other hidden parts of buildings. Because the surface of laterite is uneven, it was not suitable for decorative carvings, unless first dressed with stucco. Laterite was more commonly used in the Khmer provinces than at Angkor itself.<ref>Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', p.29.</ref>\n\n==Structures==\n\n===Central sanctuary===\nThe central sanctuary of an Angkorian temple was home to the temple's primary deity, the one to whom the site was dedicated: typically [[Shiva]] or [[Vishnu]] in the case of a [[Hindu]] temple, [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] or a [[bodhisattva]] in the case of a [[Buddhist]] temple. The deity was represented by a statue (or in the case of [[Shiva]], most commonly by a [[linga]]). Since the temple was not considered a place of worship for use by the population at large, but rather a home for the deity, the sanctuary needed only to be large enough to hold the statue or linga; it was never more than a few metres across.<ref>Coed\u00e8s, ''Pour mieux comprendre Angkor'', p.91.</ref> Its importance was instead conveyed by the height of the tower (''prasat'') rising above it, by its location at the centre of the temple, and by the greater decoration on its walls. Symbolically, the sanctuary represented [[Mount Meru]], the legendary home of the [[Hindu]] gods.<ref>See Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', pp.26 ff.</ref>\n\n===Prang===\nThe [[Prang (architecture)|prang]] is the tall finger-like spire, usually richly carved, common to much Khmer religious architecture.\n\n===Enclosure===\nKhmer temples were typically enclosed by a concentric series of walls, with the central sanctuary in the middle; this arrangement represented the mountain ranges surrounding [[Mount Meru]], the mythical home of the gods. Enclosures are the spaces between these walls, and between the innermost wall and the temple itself. By modern convention, enclosures are numbered from the centre outwards. The walls defining the enclosures of Khmer temples are frequently lined by galleries, while passage through the walls is by way of gopuras located at the cardinal points.<ref>Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.27.</ref>\n\n===Gallery===\n[[File:Angkor Wat, Camboya, 2013-08-15, DD 038.JPG|thumb|left|A cruciform gallery separates the courtyards at [[Angkor Wat]].]]\nA gallery is a passageway running along the wall of an enclosure or along the axis of a temple, often open to one or both sides. Historically, the form of the gallery evolved during the 10th century from the increasingly long hallways which had earlier been used to surround the central sanctuary of a temple. During the period of [[Angkor Wat]] in the first half of the 12th century, additional half galleries on one side were introduced to [[buttress]] the structure of the temple.\n\n===Gopura===\n[[File:Ta Phrom, Angkor, Camboya, 2013-08-16, DD 01.JPG|thumb|left|A gopura leads into the 12th-century temple compound at [[Ta Prohm]].]]\n[[File:Puerta Sur, Angkor Thom, Camboya, 2013-08-16, DD 09.JPG|thumb|right|Many of the gopuras constructed under [[Jayavarman VII]] toward the end of the 12th century, such as this one at [[Angkor Thom]], are adorned with gigantic stone faces of [[Avalokiteshvara]].]]\nA [[gopura]] is an entrance building. At [[Angkor]], passage through the enclosure walls surrounding a temple compound is frequently accomplished by means of an impressive gopura, rather than just an aperture in the wall or a doorway. Enclosures surrounding a temple are often constructed with a gopura at each of the four [[cardinal point]]s. In plan, gopuras are usually cross-shaped and elongated along the axis of the enclosure wall; if the wall is constructed with an accompanying gallery, the gallery is sometimes connected to the arms of the gopura. Many Angkorian gopuras have a tower at the centre of the cross. The [[lintel (architecture)|lintels]] and [[pediment]]s are often decorated, and guardian figures ([[dvarapala]]s) are often placed or carved on either side of the doorways.\n\n===Hall of Dancers===<!-- This section is linked from [[Architecture of Cambodia]] -->\nA Hall of Dancers is a structure of a type found in certain late 12th-century temples constructed under King [[Jayavarman VII]]: [[Ta Prohm]], [[Preah Khan]], [[Banteay Kdei]] and [[Banteay Chhmar]]. It is a rectangular building elongated along the temple's east axis and divided into four courtyards by galleries. Formerly it had a roof made of perishable materials; now only the stone walls remain. The pillars of the galleries are decorated with carved designs of dancing [[apsaras]]; hence scholars have suggested that the hall itself may have been used for dancing.\n\n===House of Fire===\nHouse of Fire, or ''Dharmasala'', is the name given to a type of building found only in temples constructed during the reign of late 12th-century monarch [[Jayavarman VII]]: [[Preah Khan]], [[Ta Prohm]] and [[Banteay Chhmar]]. A House of Fire has thick walls, a tower at the west end and south-facing windows.<ref>Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', p.172.</ref>\n\nScholars theorize that the House of Fire functioned as a \"rest house with fire\" for travellers. An inscription at [[Preah Khan]] tells of 121 such rest houses lining the highways into [[Angkor]]. The Chinese traveller [[Zhou Daguan]] expressed his admiration for these rest houses when he visited Angkor in 1296 AD.<ref>Coed\u00e8s, ''Pour mieux comprendre Angkor'', p.197f.</ref> Another theory is that the House of Fire had a religious function as the repository the sacred flame used in sacred ceremonies.\n\n[[File:Libraryangkorwat.JPG|thumb|Unusually, the libraries at [[Angkor Wat]] open to both the East and the West.]]\n\n===Library===\nStructures conventionally known as \"libraries\" are a common feature of Khmer temple architecture, but their true purpose remains unknown. Most likely they functioned broadly as religious shrines rather than strictly as repositories of manuscripts. Freestanding buildings, they were normally placed in pairs on either side of the entrance to an enclosure, opening to the west.<ref>Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', p.30.</ref>\n\n===Srah and baray===\nSrahs and barays were [[reservoir]]s, generally created by excavation and [[levee|embankment]], respectively. It is not clear whether the significance of these reservoirs was religious, agricultural, or a combination of the two.\n\nThe two largest reservoirs at Angkor were the [[West Baray]] and the [[East Baray]] located on either side of [[Angkor Thom]]. The East Baray is now dry. The [[West Mebon]] is an 11th-century temple standing at the center of the West Baray and the [[East Mebon]] is a 10th-century temple standing at the center of the East Baray.<ref>Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', p.161, 188.</ref>\n\nThe baray associated with [[Preah Khan]] is the Jayataka, in the middle of which stands the 12th-century temple of [[Neak Pean]]. Scholars have speculated that the Jayataka represents the Himalayan lake of [[Anavatapta]], known for its miraculous healing powers.<ref>Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', p.178.</ref>\n\n===Temple mountain===<!-- This section is linked from [[Angkor Wat]] -->\n[[File:Bakong.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bakong]] is the earliest surviving Temple Mountain at Angkor.]]\nThe dominant scheme for the construction of state temples in the Angkorian period was that of the Temple Mountain, an architectural representation of [[Mount Meru]], the home of the gods in [[Hinduism]].<ref>Glaize, ''The Monuments of Angkor'', p.24.</ref> The style was influenced by [[Architecture of India#Hindu architecture|Indian temple architecture]]. Enclosures represented the mountain chains surrounding Mount Meru, while a moat represented the ocean. The temple itself took shape as a pyramid of several levels, and the home of the gods was represented by the elevated sanctuary at the center of the temple.\n\nThe first great temple mountain was the [[Bakong]], a five-level pyramid dedicated in 881 by King [[Indravarman I]].<ref>Jessup, ''Art & Architecture of Cambodia'', pp.73 ff.</ref> The structure of Bakong took shape of [[stepped pyramid]], popularly identified as temple mountain of early Khmer temple architecture. The striking similarity of the Bakong and [[Borobudur]] in [[Java]], going into architectural details such as the gateways and stairs to the upper terraces, strongly suggests that Borobudur might served as the prototype of Bakong. There must have been exchanges of travelers, if not mission, between Khmer kingdom and the [[Sailendra]]s in [[Medang Kingdom|Java]]. Transmitting to Cambodia not only ideas, but also technical and architectural details of Borobudur, including arched gateways in [[Corbel arch|corbelling]] method.<ref>{{cite book| title=Southeast Asia in the 9th to 14th Centuries | author=David G.

Sculpture in bas-relief is distinguished from sculpture in haut-relief, in that the latter projects farther from the background, in some cases almost detaching itself from it. The Angkorian [[Khmer people|Khmer]] preferred to work in bas-relief, while their neighbors the [[Art of Champa|Cham]] were partial to haut-relief.\n\nNarrative bas-reliefs are bas-reliefs depicting stories from mythology or history. Until about the 11th century AD, the Angkorian Khmer confined their narrative bas-reliefs to the space on the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympana]] above doorways. The most famous early narrative bas-reliefs are those on the tympana at the 10th-century temple of [[Banteay Srei]], depicting scenes from [[Hindu mythology]] as well as scenes from the great works of Indian literature, the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]. By the 12th century, however, the Angkorian artists were covering entire walls with narrative scenes in bas-relief. At [[Angkor Wat]], the external gallery wall is covered with some 12,000 or 13,000 square meters of such scenes, some of them historical, some mythological. Similarly, the outer gallery at the [[Bayon]] contains extensive bas-reliefs documenting the everyday life of the medieval Khmer as well as historical events from the reign of King [[Jayavarman VII]].<ref>Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.36.</ref>\n\n[[File:Indraforestped01.JPG|thumb|right|A bas-relief in a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] at [[Banteay Srei]] shows [[Indra]] releasing the rains in an attempt to extinguish the fire created by [[Agni]].]]\n[[File:Angkor Wat, wall details.JPG|thumb|right|The Battle of [[Kurukshetra]] is the subject of this bas-relief at [[Angkor Wat]].]]\n[[File:Bayonmarket01.JPG|right|thumb|This scene from the outer gallery at the Bayon shows Chinese expats negotiating with Khmer merchants at an Angkorean market.]]\nThe following is a listing of the motifs illustrated in some of the more famous Angkorian narrative bas-reliefs:\n* bas-reliefs in the tympana at [[Banteay Srei]] (10th century)\n** the duel of the monkey princes [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] and [[Sugriva]], and the intervention of the human hero [[Rama]] on behalf of the latter\n** the duel of [[Bhima]] and [[Duryodhana]] at the [[Battle of Kurukshetra]]\n** the [[Rakshasa]] king [[Ravana]] shaking Mount Kailasa, upon which sit [[Shiva]] and his [[shakti]]\n** [[Kamadeva|Kama]] firing an arrow at [[Shiva]] as the latter sits on Mount Kailasa\n** the burning of Khandava Forest by [[Agni]] and [[Indra]]'s attempt to extinguish the flames\n* bas-reliefs on the walls of the outer gallery at [[Angkor Wat]] (mid-12th century)\n** the Battle of [[Lanka]] between the [[Rakshasas]] and the [[vanaras]] or monkeys\n** the court and procession of King [[Suryavarman II]], the builder of Angkor Wat\n** the [[Battle of Kurukshetra]] between [[Pandavas]] and [[Kauravas]]\n** the judgment of [[Yama]] and the tortures of Hell\n** the [[samudra manthan|Churning of the Ocean of Milk]]\n** a battle between [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] and [[asuras]]\n** a battle between [[Vishnu]] and a force of [[asuras]]\n** the conflict between [[Krishna]] and the asura Bana\n** the story of the monkey princes [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] and [[Sugriva]]\n* bas-reliefs on the walls of the outer and inner galleries at the [[Bayon]] (late 12th century)\n** battles on land and sea between [[Khmer people|Khmer]] and [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]] troops\n** scenes from the everyday life of [[Angkor]]\n** civil strife among the [[Khmer people|Khmer]]\n** the legend of the Leper King\n** the worship of [[Shiva]]\n** groups of dancing [[apsara]]s\n\n[[File:Colonettesbanteaysrei.JPG|thumb|This blind door at [[Banteay Srei]] is flanked by colonettes. Above the door is a [[lintel]], above which is a tympanum with a scene from the [[Mahabharata]].]]\n\n===Blind door and window===\nAngkorean shrines frequently opened in only one direction, typically to the east. The other three sides featured fake or blind doors to maintain symmetry. Blind windows were often used along otherwise blank walls.<ref>Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.40.</ref>\n\n===Colonette===\nColonettes were narrow decorative columns that served as supports for the beams and [[lintel]]s above doorways or windows. Depending on the period, they were round, rectangular, or octagonal in shape. Colonettes were often circled with molded rings and decorated with carved leaves.<ref>Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.38.</ref>\n\n===Corbelling===\n[[File:Corbelangkorthomsouth.JPG|thumb|100px|left|Corbelled arch at the south gate of [[Angkor Thom]].]]\n[[File:Ta-Prom Int\u00e9rieurGalerie.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Corbelled hallway at [[Ta Prohm]].]]\nAngkorian engineers tended to use the [[corbel arch]] in order to construct rooms, passageways and openings in buildings. A corbel arch is constructed by adding layers of stones to the walls on either side of an opening, with each successive layer projecting further towards the centre than the one supporting it from below, until the two sides meet in the middle. The corbel arch is structurally weaker than the true arch. The use of corbelling prevented the Angkorian engineers from constructing large openings or spaces in buildings roofed with stone, and made such buildings particularly prone to collapse once they were no longer maintained. These difficulties did not, of course, exist for buildings constructed with stone walls surmounted by a light wooden roof. The problem of preventing the collapse of corbelled structures at Angkor remains a serious one for modern conservation.<ref name = \"rlirmh\">Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.32.</ref>\n\n===Lintel, pediment, and tympanum===\nA [[lintel]] is a horizontal beam connecting two vertical columns between which runs a door or passageway. Because the Angkorean Khmer lacked the ability to construct a true [[arch]], they constructed their passageways using lintels or [[corbelling]]. A [[pediment]] is a roughly triangular structure above a lintel. A tympanum is the decorated surface of a pediment.\n\n[[File:Pedlintelsrei 2.JPG|thumb|right|[[lintel (architecture)|Lintel]] and [[pediment]] at [[Banteay Srei]]; the motif on the pediment is [[Shiva]] [[Nataraja]].]]\nThe styles employed by Angkorean artists in the decoration of lintels evolved over time, as a result, the study of lintels has proven a useful guide to the dating of temples. Some scholars have endeavored to develop a periodization of lintel styles.<ref>See, for example, Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', pp.32-35.</ref> The most beautiful Angkorean lintels are thought to be those of the [[Preah Ko]] style from the late 9th century.<ref>Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', pp.32-33.</ref>\n\nCommon motifs in the decoration of lintels include the [[k\u0101la (time)|kala]], the [[Naga (mythology)|n\u0101ga]] and the [[makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]], as well as various forms of vegetation.<ref>Glaize, ''The Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.40.</ref> Also frequently depicted are the [[Hindu]] gods associated with the four cardinal directions, with the identity of the god depicted on a given lintel or pediment depending on the direction faced by that element. [[Indra]], the god of the sky, is associated with East; [[Yama]], the god of judgment and Hell, with South; [[Varuna]], the god of the ocean, with West; and [[Kubera]], god of wealth, with North.<ref>Freeman and Jacques, ''Ancient Angkor'', p.20.</ref>\n\n====List of Khmer [[lintel]] styles==== \n*[[Sambor Prei Kuk]] style : Inward-facing [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]]s with tapering bodies. Four arches joined by three medallions, the central once carved with [[Indra]]. Small figure on each makara. A variation is with figures replacing the makaras and a scene with figures below the arch.  \n*[[Prei Khmeng]] style : Continuation of Sambor Prei Kuk but makaras disappear, being replaced by incurving ends and figures. Arches more rectilinear. Large figures sometimes at each end. A variation is a central scene below the arch, usually [[Vishnu]] Reclining. \n*[[Kompong Preah]] style : High quality carving. Arches replaced by a garland of vegetation (like a wreath) more or less segmented. Medallions disappear, central one sometimes replaced by a knot of leaves. Leafy pendants spray out above and below garland. \n*[[Phnom Kulen National Park|Kulen]] style : Great diversity, with influences from [[Art of Champa|Champa]] and [[architecture of Indonesia|Java]], including the kala and outward-facing makaras. \n*[[Preah Ko]] style : Some of the most beautiful of all Khmer lintels, rich, will-carved and imaginative. Kala in center, issuing garland on either side. Distinct loops of vegetation curl down from garland. Outward-facing makaras sometimes appear at the ends. Vishnu on [[Garuda]] common.[[File:Linteau du temple Preah K\u00f4 (Angkor) (6967952503).jpg|thumb|right|Rich-carved decoration of Preah Ko lintel.]]\n*[[Bakheng]] style : Continuation of Preah Ko but less fanciful and tiny figures disappear. Loop of vegetation below the [[N\u0101ga|naga]] form tight circular coils. Garland begins to dip in the center. \n*[[Koh Ker]] style : Center occupied by a prominent scene, taking up almost the entire height of the lintel. Usually no lower border. Dress of figures shows a curved line to the [[sampot]] tucked in below waist.\n*[[Pre Rup]] style : Tendency to copy earlier style, especially Preah Ko and Bakheng. Central figures. Re-appearance of lower border. \n*[[Banteay Srei]] style : Increase in complexity and detail. Garland sometimes makes pronounced loop on either side with kala at top of each loop. Central figure.\n*[[Khleang]] style : Less ornate than those of Banteay Srei. Central kala with triangular tongue, its hands holding the garland which is bent at the center. Kala sometimes surmounted by a divinity. Loops of garland on either side divided by flora stalk and pendant. Vigorous treatment of vegetation.\n*[[Baphuon]] style : The central kala surmounted by divinity, usually riding a steed or a Vishnu scene, typically from the life of [[Krishna]]. Loops of garland no longer cut. Another type is a scene with many figures and little vegetation. \n*[[Angkor Wat]] style : Centered, framed and linked by garlands. A second type is a narrative scene filled with figures. When nagas appear, they curls are tight and prominent. Dress mirrors that of [[devata]]s and [[apsara]]s in bas-reliefs. No empty spaces. \n*[[Bayon]] style : Most figures disappear, usually only a kala at the bottom of the lintel surmounted by small figure. Mainly Buddhist motifs. In the middle of the period the garland is cut into four parts, while later a series of whorls of foliage replace the four divisions.<ref>''Ancient Angkor'' guide book by Micheal Freeman and Claude Jacques, page 32-34, published in 2003</ref>\n\n===Stairs===\n[[File:Angkor Wat, Camboya, 2013-08-15, DD 054.JPG|thumb|left|The stairs leading to the inner enclosure at [[Ankor Wat]] are daunting.]]\nAngkorean [[stairs]] are notoriously steep. Frequently, the length of the [[Stair riser|riser]] exceeds that of the [[tread]], producing an angle of ascent somewhere between 45 and 70 degrees. The reasons for this peculiarity appear to be both religious and monumental. From the religious perspective, a steep stairway can be interpreted as a \"stairway to heaven,\" the realm of the gods. \"From the monumental point of view,\" according to Angkor-scholar [[Maurice Glaize]], \"the advantage is clear - the square of the base not having to spread in surface area, the entire building rises to its zenith with a particular thrust.\"<ref name = \"rlirmh\"/>\n\n==Motifs==\n\n===Apsara and devata===\n[[File:Apsarasdevatakdei01.jpg|thumb|right|'''Apsaras''' (left) and a '''devata''' (right) grace the walls at [[Banteay Kdei]].]]\n[[File:Bayon, Angkor Thom, Camboya, 2013-08-16, DD 04.jpg|thumb|left|Two '''[[apsara]]s''' appear on this pillar at the 12th-century Buddhist temple the [[Bayon]].]]\n[[Apsaras]], divine nymphs or celestial dancing girls, are characters from Indian mythology. Their origin is explained in the story of the churning of the [[Ocean of Milk]], or [[samudra manthan]], found in the [[Vishnu Purana]]. Other stories in the Mahabharata detail the exploits of individual apsaras, who were often used by the gods as agents to persuade or seduce mythological demons, heroes and ascetics. The widespread use of apsaras as a motif for decorating the walls and pillars of temples and other religious buildings, however, was a [[Khmer people|Khmer]] innovation. In modern descriptions of Angkorian temples, the term \"apsara\" is sometimes used to refer not only to dancers but also to other minor female deities, though minor female deities who are depicted standing about rather than dancing are more commonly called \"[[devatas]]\".<ref>See Roveda. ''Images of the Gods'', p.200ff.</ref>\n\nApsaras and devatas are ubiquitous at [[Angkor]], but are most common in the foundations of the 12th century. Depictions of true (dancing) apsaras are found, for example, in the [[Architecture of Cambodia#Hall of Dancers|Hall of Dancers]] at [[Preah Khan]], in the pillars that line the passageways through the outer gallery of the [[Bayon]], and in the famous bas-relief of [[Angkor Wat]] depicting the churning of the Ocean of Milk. The largest population of devatas (around 2,000) is at [[Angkor Wat]], where they appear individually and in groups.<ref>See Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.37.</ref>\n\n===Dvarapala===\n[[File:Banteay Kdei, Angkor, Camboya, 2013-08-16, DD 15.JPG|thumb|left|This '''dvarapala''' stands guard at [[Banteay Kdei]].]]\n[[Dvarapala]]s are human or demonic temple guardians, generally armed with lances and clubs. They are presented either as a stone statues or as relief carvings in the walls of temples and other buildings, generally close to entrances or passageways. Their function is to protect the temples. Dvarapalas may be seen, for example, at [[Preah Ko]], [[Lolei]], [[Banteay Srei]], [[Preah Khan]] and [[Banteay Kdei]].<ref>Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.37.</ref>\n\n===Gajasimha and Reachisey===\nThe [[gajasimha]] is a mythical animal with the body of a lion and the head of an elephant. At Angkor, it is portrayed as a guardian of temples and as a mount for some warriors. The gajasimha may be found at [[Banteay Srei]] and at the temples belonging to the [[Hariharalaya|Roluos]] group.\n\nThe reachisey is another mythical animal, similar to the gajasimha, with the head of a lion, a short elephantine trunk, and the scaly body of a dragon. It occurs at [[Angkor Wat]] in the epic bas reliefs of the outer gallery.<ref>Roveda, ''Images of the Gods'', pp.211-212.</ref>\n\n===Garuda===\n[[File:Linteau Mus\u00e9e Guimet 25972.jpg|right|thumb|In this 9th century lintel now on display at the [[Mus\u00e9e Guimet]], '''Garuda''' bears Vishnu on his shoulders.]]\n[[Garuda]] is a divine being that is part man and part bird. He is the lord of birds, the mythologial enemy of [[n\u0101ga]]s, and the battle steed of [[Vishnu]]. Depictions of Garuda at Angkor number in the thousands, and though Indian in inspiration exhibit a style that is uniquely Khmer.<ref name = \"ukougg\">Roveda, ''Images of the Gods'', p.177.</ref> They may be classified as follows:\n* As part of a narrative bas relief, Garuda is shown as the battle steed of [[Vishnu]] or [[Krishna]], bearing the god on his shoulders, and simultaneously fighting against the god's enemies. Numerous such images of Garuda may be observed in the outer gallery of [[Angkor Wat]].\n* Garuda serves as an [[Atlas (architecture)|atlas]] supporting a superstructure, as in the bas relief at Angkor Wat that depicts heaven and hell. Garudas and stylized mythological lions are the most common atlas figures at Angkor.\n* Garuda is depicted in the pose of a victor, often dominating a n\u0101ga, as in the gigantic relief sculptures on the outer wall of [[Preah Khan]]. In this context, Garuda symbolizes the military power of the Khmer kings and their victories over their enemies. Not coincidentally, the city of Preah Khan was built on the site of King [[Jayavarman VII]]'s victory over invaders from [[Champa]].\n* In free-standing n\u0101ga sculptures, such as in n\u0101ga bridges and balustrades, Garuda is often depicted in relief against the fan of n\u0101ga heads. The relationship between Garuda and the n\u0101ga heads is ambiguous in these sculptures: it may be one of cooperation, or it may again be one of domination of the n\u0101ga by Garuda.<ref name = \"ukougg\"/>\n\n===Indra===\nIn the ancient religion of the [[Vedas]], [[Indra]] the sky-god reigned supreme. In the medieval [[Hinduism]] of Angkor, however, he had no religious status, and served only as a decorative motif in architecture. Indra is associated with the East; since Angkorian temples typically open to the East, his image is sometimes encountered on lintels and pediments facing that direction. Typically, he is mounted on the three-headed elephant [[Airavata]] and holds his trusty weapon, the thunderbolt or [[vajra]]. The numerous adventures of Indra documented in Hindu epic [[Mahabharata]] are not depicted at Angkor.<ref name = \"ukougg\"/>\n\n===Kala===\n[[File:Banteay Srei Kala.jpg|thumb|right|A '''kala''' serves as the base for a deity at the 10th-century Hindu temple [[Banteay Srei]].]]\nThe kala is a ferocious monster symbolic of time in its all-devouring aspect and associated with the destructive side of the god [[Shiva|Siva]].<ref>Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.39.</ref> In Khmer temple architecture, the kala serves as a common decorative element on lintels, tympana and walls, where it is depicted as a monstrous head with a large upper jaw lined by large carnivorous teeth, but with no lower jaw. Some kalas are shown disgorging vine-like plants, and some serve as the base for other figures.\n\nScholars have speculated that the origin of the kala as a decorative element in Khmer temple architecture may be found in an earlier period when the skulls of human victims were incorporated into buildings as a kind of protective magic or [[apotropaism]]. Such skulls tended to lose their lower jaws when the ligaments holding them together dried out. Thus, the kalas of Angkor may represent the Khmer civilization's adoption into its decorative iconography of elements derived from long forgotten primitive antecedents.<ref>Roveda, ''Images of the Gods'', p.209.</ref>\n\n===Krishna===\nScenes from the life of [[Krishna]], a hero and [[Avatar]] of the god [[Vishnu]], are common in the relief carvings decorating Angkorian temples, and unknown in Angkorian sculpture in the round. The literary sources for these scenes are the [[Mahabharata]], the [[Harivamsa]], and the [[Bhagavata Purana]].<ref>See Roveda, ''Images of the Gods'', pp.76 ff.</ref> The following are some of the most important Angkorian depictions of the life of Krishna:\n* A series of bas reliefs at the 11th-century temple pyramid called [[Baphuon]] depicts scenes of the birth and childhood of Krishna.<ref>Roveda, ''Images of the Gods'', p.76.</ref>\n* Numerous bas reliefs in various temples show Krishna subduing the [[n\u0101ga]] [[Kaliya]]. In Angkorian depictions, Krishna is shown effortlessly stepping on and pushing down his opponent's multiple heads.<ref>Rovedo, ''Images of the Gods'', p.79</ref>\n* Also common is the depiction of Krishna as he lifts Mount [[Govardhan Hill|Govardhana]] with one hand in order to provide the cowherds with shelter from the deluge caused by [[Indra]].<ref>Roveda, ''Images of the Gods'', p.80.</ref>\n* Krishna is frequently depicted killing or subduing various demons, including his evil uncle [[Kamsa]].<ref>Roveda, ''Images of the Gods'', p.91.</ref> An extensive bas relief in the outer gallery of [[Angkor Wat]] depicts Krishna's battle with the [[asura]] Bana. In battle, Krishna is shown riding on the shoulders of [[Garuda]], the traditional mount of [[Vishnu]].\n* In some scenes, Krishna is depicted in his role as charioteer, advisor and protector of [[Arjuna]], the hero of the [[Mahabharata]]. A well-known bas relief from the 10th-century temple of [[Banteay Srei]] depicts the Krishna and Arjuna helping [[Agni]] to burn down Khandava forest.\n\n===Linga===\n[[File:Linga Mus\u00e9e Guimet 2597.jpg|thumb|left|This segmented '''linga''' from 10th century Angkor has a square base, an octagonal middle, and a round tip.]]\nThe [[linga]] is a phallic post or cylinder symbolic of the god [[Shiva]] and of creative power.<ref>Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.16.</ref> As a religious symbol, the function of the linga is primarily that of worship and ritual, and only secondarily that of decoration. In the [[Khmer empire]], certain lingas were erected as symbols of the king himself, and were housed in royal temples in order to express the king's consubstantiality with Siva.<ref>Coed\u00e8s, ''Pour mieux comprendre Angkor'', p.60.</ref> The lingas that survive from the Angkorean period are generally made of polished stone.\n\nThe lingas of the Angkorian period are of several different types.\n* Some lingas are implanted in a flat square base called a [[yoni]], symbolic of the womb.\n* On the surface of some lingas is engraved the face of Siva. Such lingas are called [[mukhalinga]]s.\n* Some lingas are segmented into three parts: a square base symbolic of [[Brahma]], an octagonal middle section symbolic of [[Vishnu]], and a round tip symbolic of [[Shiva]].\n\n===Makara===\n[[File:Lintel corner with makara rider 1.jpg|thumb|right|The corner of a lintel on one of the brick towers at [[Bakong]] shows a man riding on the back of a '''makara''' that in turn disgorges another monster.]]\nA [[makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] is a mythical sea monster with the body of a serpent, the trunk of an elephant, and a head that can have features reminiscent of a lion, a crocodile, or a dragon. In Khmer temple architecture, the motif of the makara is generally part of a decorative carving on a lintel, tympanum, or wall. Often the makara is depicted with some other creature, such as a lion or serpent, emerging from its gaping maw. The makara is a central motif in the design of the famously beautiful lintels of the [[Hariharalaya|Roluos]] group of temples: [[Preah Ko]], [[Bakong]], and [[Lolei]]. At [[Banteay Srei]], carvings of makaras disgorging other monsters may be observed on many of the corners of the buildings.\n\n===N\u0101ga===<!-- This section is linked from [[Angkor]] -->\n[[File:Buddha shielded by Naga.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mucalinda]], the '''n\u0101ga''' king who shielded [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] as he sat in meditation, was a favorite motif for Cambodian Buddhist sculptors from the 11th century. This statue is dated between 1150 and 1175 A.D.]]\n\nMythical serpents, or [[Naga (mythology)|n\u0101ga]]s, represent an important motif in Khmer architecture as well as in free-standing sculpture. They are frequently depicted as having multiple heads, always uneven in number, arranged in a fan. Each head has a flared hood, in the manner of a cobra.\n\n[[File:Linteau Mus\u00e9e Guimet 25973.jpg|right|thumb|This multi-headed '''n\u0101ga''' is part of a decorative lintel from the end of the 9th century.]]\nN\u0101gas are frequently depicted in Angkorian [[lintel]]s. The composition of such lintels characteristically consists in a dominant image at the center of a rectangle, from which issue swirling elements that reach to the far ends of the rectangle. These swirling elements may take shape as either vinelike vegetation or as the bodies of n\u0101gas. Some such n\u0101gas are depicted wearing crowns, and others are depicted serving as mounts for human riders.\n\nTo the Angkorian Khmer, n\u0101gas were symbols of water and figured in the myths of origin for the Khmer people, who were said to be descended from the union of an Indian [[Brahman]] and a serpent princess from Cambodia.<ref>Glaize, ''The Monuments of Angkor'', p.1.</ref> N\u0101gas were also characters in other well-known legends and stories depicted in Khmer art, such as the churning of the [[Ocean of Milk]], the legend of the Leper King as depicted in the bas-reliefs of the [[Bayon]], and the story of [[Mucalinda]], the serpent king who protected the Buddha from the elements.<ref>Glaize, ''The Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.43.</ref>\n\n===N\u0101ga Bridge===\n[[File:Statues over a bridge-angkor.jpg|thumb|right|Stone [[Asuras]] hold the '''n\u0101ga''' [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] on a bridge leading into the 12th century city of [[Angkor Thom]].]]\nN\u0101ga bridges are causeways or true bridges lined by stone [[balustrade]]s shaped as n\u0101gas.\n\nIn some Angkorian n\u0101ga-bridges, as for example those located at the entrances to 12th century city of [[Angkor Thom]], the n\u0101ga-shaped balustrades are supported not by simple posts but by stone statues of gigantic warriors. These giants are the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] and [[asuras]] who used the n\u0101ga king [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] in order to the churn the Ocean of Milk in quest of the [[amrita]] or elixir of immortality. The story of the Churning of the Ocean of Milk or [[samudra manthan]] has its source in Indian mythology.\n\n===Quincunx===\n[[File:Quincunxlingakbalspean01.JPG|thumb|left|A '''linga''' in the form of a '''quincunx''', set inside a [[yoni]], is carved into the riverbed at [[Kbal Spean]].]]\nA [[quincunx]] is a spatial arrangement of five elements, with four elements placed as the corners of a square and the fifth placed in the center. The five peaks of [[Mount Meru]] were taken to exhibit this arrangement, and Khmer temples was arranged accordingly in order to convey a symbolic identification with the sacred mountain. The five brick towers of the 10th-century temple known as [[East Mebon]], for example, are arranged in the shape of a quincunx. The quincunx also appears elsewhere in designs of the Angkorian period, as in the riverbed carvings of [[Kbal Spean]].\n\n===Shiva===\nMost temples at [[Angkor]] are dedicated to [[Shiva]]. In general, the Angkorian Khmer represented and worshipped Shiva in the form of a [[lingam]], though they also fashioned anthropomorphic statues of the god. Anthropomorphic representations are also found in Angkorian bas reliefs. A famous tympanum from [[Banteay Srei]] depicts Shiva sitting on Mount Kailasa with his consort, while the demon king [[Ravana]] shakes the mountain from below. At [[Angkor Wat]] and [[Bayon]], Shiva is depicted as a bearded ascetic. His attributes include the mystical eye in the middle of his forehead, the trident, and the rosary. His [[vahana]] or mount is the bull [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]].\n\n===Vishnu===\nAngkorian representations of [[Vishnu]] include anthropomorphic representations of the god himself, as well as representations of his incarnations or [[Avatar]]s, especially [[Krishna]] and [[Rama]]. Depictions of Vishnu are prominent at [[Angkor Wat]], the 12th-century temple that was originally dedicated to Vishnu. Bas reliefs depict Vishna battling with against [[asura]] opponents, or riding on the shoulders of his [[vahana]] or mount, the gigantic bird-man [[Garuda]]. Vishnu's attributes include the discus, the conch shell, the baton, and the orb.\n\n==Ordinary housing==\n\nThe nuclear family, in rural Cambodia, typically lives in a rectangular house that may vary in size from four by six meters to six by ten meters. It is constructed of a wooden frame with gabled thatch roof and walls of woven bamboo. [[Rural Khmer house|Khmer houses]] typically are raised on stilts as much as three meters for protection from annual floods. Two ladders or wooden staircases provide access to the house. The steep thatch roof overhanging the house walls protects the interior from rain. Typically a house contains three rooms separated by partitions of woven bamboo. The front room serves as a living room used to receive visitors, the next room is the parents' bedroom, and the third is for unmarried daughters. Sons sleep anywhere they can find space. Family members and neighbors work together to build the house, and a house-raising ceremony is held upon its completion. The houses of poorer persons may contain only a single large room. Food is prepared in a separate kitchen located near the house but usually behind it. Toilet facilities consist of simple pits in the ground, located away from the house, that are covered up when filled. Any livestock is kept below the house.<ref name=country>[[Federal Research Division]]. Russell R. Ross, ed. \"Housing\".

Its name is [[Latin]] for \"horned [[goat]]\" or \"goat [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]\" or \"having horns like a goat's\", and it is commonly represented in the form of a sea-goat: a mythical creature that is half goat, half [[fish]]. Its symbol is [[Image:Capricorn symbol 2.png|20px]] (Unicode \u2651).\n\nCapricornus is one of the [[88 modern constellations]], and was also one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]]. Under its modern boundaries it is bordered by [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], [[Microscopium]], [[Piscis Austrinus]], and [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. The constellation is located in an area of sky called the [[Sea (astronomy)|Sea]] or the Water, consisting of many water-related constellations such as Aquarius, [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] and [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]]. It is the smallest constellation in the zodiac.\n\n==Notable features==\n[[Image:CapricornusCC.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Capricornus as it can be seen with the naked eye.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allthesky.com/constellations/capricornus.html |title=Capricornus, the Goat - Constellations - Digital Images of the Sky |publisher=Allthesky.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref>]]\n\n[[File:Messier_30_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg|350px|thumb|right|The globular cluster Messier 30 imaged by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]\n\n===Stars===\n{{see also|List of stars in Capricornus}}\nCapricornus is a faint constellation, with only one star above magnitude 3; its [[Bayer designation|alpha star]] has a magnitude of only 3.6.\n\nThe brightest star in Capricornus is [[Delta Capricorni|\u03b4 Capricorni]], also called Deneb Algedi, with a magnitude of 2.9, 39 light-years from Earth. Like several other stars such as [[Denebola]] and [[Deneb]], it is named for the Arabic word for \"tail\" (''deneb''); its traditional name means \"the tail of the goat\". Deneb Algedi is a [[Beta Lyrae variable]] star (a type of [[eclipsing binary]]). It ranges by about 0.2 magnitudes with a period of 24.5 hours.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}\n\nThe other bright stars in Capricornus range in magnitude from 3.1 to 5.1. [[Alpha Capricorni|\u03b1 Capricorni]] is a multiple star also known as Algedi or Giedi. The primary (\u03b1<sup>2</sup> Cap), 109 light-years from Earth,  is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 3.6.; the secondary (\u03b1<sup>1</sup> Cap), 690 light-years from Earth, is a yellow-hued supergiant star of magnitude 4.3. The two stars are distinguishable by the naked eye, and both are themselves multiple stars. \u03b1<sup>1</sup> Capricorni is accompanied by a star of magnitude 9.2; \u03b1<sup>2</sup> Capricornus is accompanied by a star of magnitude 11.0; this faint star is itself a binary star with two components of magnitude 11. The traditional names of \u03b1 Capricorni come from the Arabic word for \"the kid\", which references the constellation's mythology.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}\n\n[[Beta Capricorni|\u03b2 Capricorni]] is a [[double star]] also known as Dabih. It is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 3.1, 340 light-years from Earth. The secondary is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 6.1. The two stars are distinguishable in binoculars. [[Beta Capricorni|\u03b2 Capricorni]]'s traditional name comes from the Arabic phrase for \"the lucky stars of the slaughterer,\" a reference to ritual sacrifices performed by ancient Arabs at the [[heliacal rising]] of Capricornus.<ref>Mark R. Chartrand III (1983) Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers, p. 126 ({{ISBN|0-307-13667-1}}).</ref> Another star visible to the naked eye is [[Gamma Capricorni|\u03b3 Capricorni]], sometimes called Nashira (\"bringing good tidings\"); it is a white-hued giant star of magnitude 3.7, 139 light-years from Earth. [[Pi Capricorni|\u03c0 Capricorni]] is a double star with a blue-white hued primary of magnitude 5.1 and a white-hued secondary of magnitude 8.3. It is 670 light-years from Earth and the components are distinguishable in a small telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}\n\n===Deep-sky objects===\nSeveral galaxies and star clusters are contained within Capricornus.  [[Messier 30]] is a globular cluster located 1 degree south of the galaxy group NGC 7103. The constellation also harbors the wide spiral galaxy NGC 6907.\n\n[[Messier 30|M30]] (NGC 7099) is a centrally-condensed globular cluster of magnitude 7.5. At a distance of 30,000 light-years, it has chains of stars extending to the north that are resolvable in small amateur telescopes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}\n\nOne [[galaxy group]] located in Capricornus is [[HCG 87]], a group of at least three galaxies located 400 million [[light-years]] from Earth ([[redshift]] 0.0296). It contains a large [[elliptical galaxy]], a face-on [[spiral galaxy]], and an edge-on spiral galaxy. The face-on spiral galaxy is experiencing abnormally high rates of [[star formation]], indicating that it is [[interacting galaxy|interacting]] with one or both members of the group. Furthermore, the large elliptical galaxy and the edge-on spiral galaxy, both of which have [[active galactic nucleus|active nuclei]], are connected by a stream of stars and dust, indicating that they too are interacting. Astronomers predict that the three galaxies may [[galaxy merger|merge]] millions of years in the future to form a giant elliptical galaxy.<ref name=\"objects\">{{Harvnb|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}</ref>\n\n==History and mythology==\nDespite its faintness, Capricornus has one of the oldest mythological associations, having been consistently represented as a [[mythological hybrid|hybrid]] of a goat and a fish since the [[Middle Bronze Age]].

They lived in the sea near the shore. They could speak and think according to Greek legend. They were favoured by the gods.\nPricus is tied to [[Chronos]] (Greek mythology), the god of time. Chronos created the immortal Pricus, who shares Chronos's ability to manipulate time.<ref>http://www.gods-and-monsters.com/capricorn-mythology.html</ref>\nHe had lots of children who lived near the seashore, however, when they found themselves on the dry land they turned into normal goats, losing their special ability to think and speak in the proses. in an effort to prevent this pricus turns back time, again and again, however, he eventually resigns himself to loneliness and misery, letting the little Sea Goats leave him. learning he cannot control their fate and not wanting to be the only Sea Goat prompts him to ask Chronos to let him die.

The solstice now takes place when the Sun is in the constellation (not the sign) of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. The sun's most southerly position, which is attained at the northern hemisphere's winter solstice, is now called the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], a term which also applies to the line on the Earth at which the sun is directly overhead at noon on that solstice. The Sun is now in Capricorn from late January through mid-February.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=102-103}}\n\nThe planet [[Neptune]] was discovered by German astronomer [[Johann Gottfried Galle|Johann Galle]], near Deneb Algedi (\u03b4 Capricorni) on September 23, 1846, which is appropriate as Capricornus can be seen best from Europe at 4:00am in September (although, by modern constellation boundaries established in the early 20th Century, Neptune lay within the confines of Aquarius at the time of its discovery).\n\n==Visualizations==\n[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Capricornus.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Capricornus as a sea-goat from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825).]]\nCapricornus's brighter stars are found on a triangle whose vertices are [[Alpha Capricorni|\u03b1<sup>2</sup> Capricorni]] (Giedi), [[Delta Capricorni|\u03b4 Capricorni]] (Deneb Algiedi), and [[Omega Capricorni|\u03c9 Capricorni]].

It is bordered by [[Nigeria]] to the west and north; [[Chad]] to the northeast; the [[Central African Republic]] to the east; and [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the south. Cameroon's coastline lies on the [[Bight of Biafra]], part of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Although Cameroon is not an ECOWAS member state, it geographically and historically is in West Africa with the [[Southern Cameroons]] which now form her [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|Northwest]] and [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest]] Regions having a strong West African history. The country is sometimes identified as West African and other times as Central African due to its strategic position at the crossroads between West and Central Africa.\n\nFrench and English are the official languages of Cameroon. The country is often referred to as \"Africa in miniature\" for its geological and cultural diversity. Natural features include [[beaches]], [[deserts]], [[mountains]], [[rainforests]], and [[savannas]]. The highest point at almost {{convert|4100|m|ft}} is [[Mount Cameroon]] in the [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest Region]] of the country, and the largest cities in population-terms are [[Douala]] on the [[Wouri river]], its economic capital and main seaport, [[Yaound\u00e9]], its political capital, and [[Garoua]]. The country is well known for its native styles of music, particularly [[makossa]] and [[bikutsi]], and for its successful [[Cameroon national football team|national football team]].\n\nEarly inhabitants of the territory included the [[Sao civilisation]] around [[Lake Chad]] and the [[Baka (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest. [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorers]] reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area ''Rio dos Camar\u00f5es'' (''Shrimp River''), which became ''Cameroon'' in English. [[Fula people|Fulani]] soldiers founded the [[Adamawa Emirate]] in the north in the 19th century, and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and [[fon (Cameroon)|fondoms]]. Cameroon became a [[German Empire|German colony]] in 1884 known as [[Kamerun]].\n\nAfter [[World War I]], the territory was divided between [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]] as [[League of Nations mandate]]s. The [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon|Union des Populations du Cameroun]] (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed by France in the 1950s, leading to the [[Cameroonian Independence War]] fought between French and UPC militant forces until early 1971. In 1960, the French-administered part of Cameroon became independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]]. The [[Southern Cameroons|southern part]] of [[British Cameroons]] federated with it in 1961 to form the [[Federal republic|Federal Republic]] of Cameroon. The federation was abandoned in 1972. The country was renamed the [[Unitary state|United Republic]] of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in 1984. Large numbers of Cameroonians live as [[subsistence farmers]]. Since 1982 [[Paul Biya]] has been President, governing with his [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]] party. The country has experienced tensions coming from the English-speaking territories. Politicians in the English-speaking regions have advocated for greater decentralisation and even complete separation or independence (as in the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]]) from Cameroon.\n\n== History ==\n\n{{Main|History of Cameroon}}\n\nThe territory of present-day Cameroon was first settled during the [[Neolithic]] Era.

Performers such as [[Manu Dibango]], [[Francis Bebey]], [[Moni Bil\u00e9]], and [[Petit-Pays]] popularised the style worldwide in the 1970s and 1980s. Bikutsi originated as war music among the Ewondo. Artists such as [[Anne-Marie Nzi\u00e9]] developed it into a popular dance music beginning in the 1940s, and performers such as [[Mama Ohandja]] and [[Les T\u00eates Brul\u00e9es]] popularised it internationally during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 51</ref><ref name= Nkolo/>\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\n{{Further|Cameroonian cuisine}}\n\n[[File:Woman weaving baskets near Lake Ossa.jpg|thumb|A woman weaves a basket near [[Lake Ossa]], Littoral Region. Cameroonians practise such handicrafts throughout the country.]]\n\n[[Cuisine of Cameroon|Cuisine]] varies by region, but a large, one-course, evening meal is common throughout the country. A typical dish is based on cocoyams, [[maize]], [[cassava]] (manioc), [[millet]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[potato]]es, [[rice]], or [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], often pounded into dough-like [[fufu]]. This is served with a sauce, soup, or stew made from greens, [[groundnut]]s, [[palm oil]], or other ingredients.<ref>[[#West|West]] 84\u20135.</ref> Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions, with chicken often reserved for special occasions.<ref name=\"Mbaku 121-2\">[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 121\u20132.</ref> Dishes are often quite hot, spiced with salt, red pepper sauce, and [[Maggi]].<ref>[[#Hudgens|Hudgens and Trillo]] 1047</ref><ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 122</ref><ref>[[#West|West]] 84.</ref>\n\nCutlery is common, but food is traditionally manipulated with the right hand. Breakfast consists of leftovers of bread and fruit with [[coffee]] or [[tea]]. Generally breakfast is made from wheat flour in various different foods such as puff-puff (doughnuts), accra banana made from [[banana]]s and flour, bean cakes and many more. Snacks are popular, especially in larger towns where they may be bought from [[street vendor]]s.<ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 121</ref><ref>[[#Hudgens|Hudgens and Trillo]] 1049.</ref>\n\nWater, [[palm wine]], and [[millet beer]] are the traditional mealtime drinks, although beer, soda, and wine have gained popularity. 33 Export beer is the official drink of the [[Cameroon national football team|national soccer team]] and one of the most popular brands, joining Castel, [[Amstel Brewery]], and [[Guinness Foreign Extra Stout|Guinness]].\n\n=== Local arts and crafts ===\n\nTraditional arts and crafts are practiced throughout the country for commercial, decorative, and religious purposes.

Traditional housing styles make use of locally available materials and vary from temporary wood-and-leaf shelters of nomadic [[Wodaabe|Mbororo]] to the rectangular mud-and-thatch homes of southern peoples. Dwellings made from materials such as cement and tin are increasingly common.<ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 110\u20133.</ref> [[Contemporary art]] is mainly promoted by independent cultural organizations ([[Doual'art]], [[Africr\u00e9a]]) and [[artist-run initiative]]s ([[Art Wash]], [[Atelier Viking]], [[ArtBakery]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postzambia.com/post-read_article.php?articleId=8690|accessdate=12 April 2013|work=The Post|author=Mulenga, Andrew|date=30 April 2010|title=Cameroon's indomitable contemporary art|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311124956/http://www.postzambia.com/post-read_article.php?articleId=8690|archivedate=11 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Literature ===\n\n{{Main|Literature of Cameroon}}\n\nCameroonian literature has concentrated on both European and African themes.

The [[Mandara kingdom]] in the [[Mandara Mountains]] was founded around 1500 and erected [[Mandara Strongholds|fortified structures]], the purpose and exact history of which are still unresolved. The [[Aro Confederacy]] of [[Nigeria]] had a presence in western (later called British) Cameroon due to trade and migration in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nDuring the late 1770s and the early 19th century, the [[Fula people|Fula]]ni, a [[pastoralism|pastoral]] [[Islam]]ic people of the western [[Sahel]], conquered most of what is now northern Cameroon, subjugating or displacing its largely non-Muslim inhabitants.\n\nAlthough the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrived on Cameroon's doorstep in the 16th century, [[malaria]] prevented significant European settlement and conquest of the interior until the late 1870s, when large supplies of the malaria suppressant [[quinine]] became available. The early European presence in Cameroon was primarily devoted to coastal trade and the acquisition of [[slavery|slaves]]. The northern part of Cameroon was an important part of the Muslim slave trade network. The slave trade was largely suppressed by the mid-19th century.

Hospitals were opened all over the colony, including two major hospitals at [[Douala]], one of which specialised in tropical diseases. However, the indigenous peoples proved reluctant to work on these projects, so the Germans instigated a harsh and unpopular system of [[unfree labour|forced labour]].<ref>DeLancey and DeLancey 125.</ref> In fact, [[Jesko von Puttkamer]] was relieved of duty as governor of the colony due to his untoward actions toward the native Cameroonians.<ref>DeLancey and DeLancey 226.</ref> In 1911 at the [[Treaty of Fez]] after the [[Agadir Crisis]], France ceded a nearly 300,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 portion of the territory of [[French Equatorial Africa]] to Kamerun which became [[Neukamerun]], while Germany ceded a smaller area in the north in present-day [[Chad]] to France.\n\nIn [[World War I]], the British invaded Cameroon from [[Nigeria]] in 1914 in the [[Kamerun campaign]], with the last German fort in the country [[Siege of Mora|surrendering]] in February 1916.  After the war, this colony was partitioned between the United Kingdom and France under June 28, 1919 [[League of Nations mandate#Class B mandates|League of Nations mandates (Class B)]]. France gained the larger geographical share, transferred Neukamerun back to neighboring French colonies, and ruled the rest from Yaound\u00e9 as [[French Cameroun|Cameroun]] (French Cameroons). Britain's territory, a strip bordering [[Nigeria]] from the sea to [[Lake Chad]], with an equal population was ruled from [[Lagos]] as [[Cameroons]] (British Cameroons). German administrators were allowed to once again run the plantations of the southwestern coastal area. A British parliamentary publication, ''Report on the British Sphere of the Cameroons'' (May 1922, p.&nbsp;62-8), reports that the German plantations there were \"as a whole . . . wonderful examples of industry, based on solid scientific knowledge. The natives have been taught discipline and have come to realize what can be achieved by industry. Large numbers who return to their villages take up cocoa or other cultivation on their own account, thus increasing the general prosperity of the country.\"        \n\n==Towards Independence (1955-1960)==\nOn 18 December 1956, the outlawed [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon]] (UPC), based largely among the [[Bamileke]] and [[Bassa people (Cameroon)|Bassa]] ethnic groups, began an armed struggle for independence in French Cameroon. This rebellion continued, with diminishing intensity, even after independence until 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uca.edu/politicalscience/dadm-project/sub-saharan-africa-region/britishfrench-cameroon-1948-1961/|title=8.

It took back its former status of associated territory as a member of the French Union. Its inhabitants became Cameroonian citizens, Cameroonian institutions were created under the sign of parliamentary democracy.  On 12 June 1958 the Legislative Assembly of French Cameroon asked the French government to: 'Accord independence to the State of Cameroon at the ends of their trusteeship. Transfer every competence related to the running of internal affairs of Cameroon to Cameroonians`. On 19 October 1958 France recognized the right of her United Nations trust territory of the Cameroons to choose independence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1958/10/20/archives/cameroons-gets-freedom-pledge-paris-backs-independence-for-african.html?sq=Cameroon%2520independence&scp=1&st=p|title=CAMEROONS GETS FREEDOM PLEDGE; Paris Backs Independence for African Trust Territory After Interim Self-Rule|first=Thomas F.|last=Brady|date=20 October 1958|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> On 24 October 1958 the Legislative Assembly of French Cameroon solemnly proclaimed the desire of Cameroonians to see their country accede full independence on 1 January 1960. It enjoined the government of French Cameroon to ask France to inform the General Assembly of the United Nations, to abrogate the trusteeship accord concomitant with the independence of French Cameroon. On 12 November 1958 having accorded French Cameroon total internal autonomy and thinking that this transfer no longer permitted it to assume its responsibilities over the trust territory for an unspecified period, the government of France asked the United Nations to grant the wish of French Cameroonians. On 5 December 1958 the United Nations\u2019 General Assembly took note of the French government\u2019s declaration according to which French Cameroon, which was under French administration, would gain independence on 1 January 1960, thus marking an end to the trusteeship period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cameroon50.cm/en/history-and-presentation/167-tutelle-a-independance.html |title=From trusteeship to independence (1946 \u2013 1960) |accessdate=2011-12-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027131756/http://www.cameroon50.cm/en/history-and-presentation/167-tutelle-a-independance.html |archivedate=27 October 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Question of the future of the Trust Territories of the Cameroons under French administration and the Cameroons under United Kingdom administration|id=A/RES/1282(XIII) |url=https://undocs.org/A/RES/1282(XIII)|website=undocs.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=17 March 2017|language=en}}</ref> On 13 March 1959 the United Nations\u2019 General Assembly resolved that the UN Trusteeship Agreement with France for French Cameroon would end when French Cameroon became independent on 1 January 1961.<ref>{{cite web|title=The future of the Trust Territories of the Cameroons under French administration|id=A/RES/1349(XIII) |url=https://undocs.org/A/RES/1349(XIII)|website=undocs.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=17 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Cameroon after independence==\n[[File:Flag of Cameroon (1961-1975).svg|thumbnail|1961\u20131975]]\n[[File:Monument Reunification.jpg|thumb|[[Reunification Monument (Cameroon)|Reunification Monument]] in [[Yaound\u00e9]]]]\n\nFrench Cameroon achieved independence on January 1, 1960 as '''La Republique du Cameroun'''. After Guinea, it was the second of France's colonies in Sub-Saharan Africa to become independent. On 21 February 1960, the new nation held a constitutional referendum. On 5 May 1960, [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]] became president. On 11 February 1961, a [[plebiscite]] organised by the United Nations was held in the British controlled part of Cameroon (British Northern and British Southern Cameroons). The pleibiscite was to choose between free association with an independent Nigerian state or re-unification with the independent Republic of Cameroun. On 12 February 1961,the results of the plebiscite were released and British Northern Cameroons attached itself to Nigeria, while the southern part voted for reunification with the Republic Of Cameroon. To negotiate the terms of this union, the [[Foumban Conference]] was held on 16\u201321 July 1961. [[John Ngu Foncha]], the leader of the [[Kamerun National Democratic Party]] . The British Southern Cameroons was to be referred to as West Cameroon and the French part as East Cameroon. Buea became the capital of the now West Cameroon while Yaounde doubled as the federal capital and East Cameroon. Ahidjo accepted the federation, thinking it was a step towards a unitary state. On 14 August 1961, the federal constitution was adopted, with Ahidjo as president. Foncha became the prime minister of west Cameroon and vice president of the Federal Republic of Cameroon. On 1 September 1966 the [[Cameroon National Union]] (CNU) was created by the union of political parties of East and West Cameroon. Most decisions about West Cameroon were taken without consultation, which led to widespread feelings  amongst the West Cameroonian public that although they voted for reunification, what they were getting is absorption or domination\".<ref>The Untold Story of Reunification: (1955-1961)</ref>\n\nOn October 1, 1961, the largely Muslim northern two-thirds of [[British Cameroons]] voted to join Nigeria; the largely Christian southern third, [[Southern Cameroons]], voted, in a referendum, to join with the Republic of Cameroon to form the '''Federal Republic of Cameroon'''. The formerly French and British regions each maintained substantial [[Self-governance|autonomy]]. Ahidjo was chosen president of the federation in 1961. In 1962, the Francs CFA became the official currency in Cameroon. \n\nAhidjo, relying on a pervasive internal security apparatus, outlawed all political parties but his own in 1966. He successfully suppressed the continuing UPC rebellion, capturing the last important rebel leader in 1970. On 28 March 1970 Ahidjo renewed his mandate as the supreme magistracy; [[Solomon Tandeng Muna]]  became Vice President. In 1972, a new constitution replaced the federation with a unitary state called the '''United Republic of Cameroon'''. \nAlthough Ahidjo's rule was characterised as authoritarian, he was seen as noticeably lacking in charisma in comparison to many post-colonial African leaders. He didn't follow the anti-western policies pursued by many of these leaders, which helped Cameroon achieve a degree of comparative political stability and economic growth.\n\nOn 30 June 1975 [[Paul Biya]] was appointed vice president. Ahidjo resigned as president in 1982 and was constitutionally succeeded by his [[Prime Minister]], [[Paul Biya]], a career official. Ahidjo later regretted his choice of successors, but his supporters failed to overthrow Biya in a [[Cameroonian Palace Guard Revolt|1984 coup]]. Biya won single-candidate elections in 1983 and 1984 when the country was again named the '''Republic of Cameroon'''.  Biya has remained in power, winning flawed multiparty elections in 1992, 1997, 2004 and 2011. His [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]] (CPDM) party holds a sizeable majority in the legislature.\n\nBy April 6, 1984, the country witnessed its first coup d'\u00e9tat headed by col. Issa Adoum.\nAt about 3 am rebel forces mostly of the Republican guard under the orders of colonel Ibrahim Saleh, attempted to '''unseat Biya's government.''' The rebels took charge of the Yaounde airport, national radio station and announced the takeover of government. They attacked the presidency. The civilian northerner who was manager of FONADER '''Issa Adoum''' was expected to become the new interim president. Unfortunately, many reasons led to its failure.\nThe principal coup plotters had been arrested by April 10, 1984 and President Biya addressed the nation that calm had been restored.\n\nOn August 15, 1984, [[Lake Monoun]] exploded in a [[limnic eruption]] that released [[carbon dioxide]], [[Asphyxia|suffocating]] 37 people to death. On August 21, 1986, another limnic eruption at [[Lake Nyos]] killed as many as 1,800 people and 3,500 livestock.  The two disasters are the only recorded instances of limnic eruptions.\n\nIn May 2014, in the wake of the [[Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping]], Presidents [[Paul Biya]] of Cameroon and [[Idriss D\u00e9by]] of [[Chad]] announced they were waging war on [[Boko Haram]], and deployed troops to the Nigerian border.<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Cameroon, Chad Deploy Troops to Fight Boko Haram - Nigeria\n| work = ReliefWeb\n| accessdate = 2014-06-10\n| url = http://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/cameroon-chad-deploy-troops-fight-boko-haram\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n| last = Kaze\n| first = Rennier\n| title = Dans le Nord du Cameroun, la \"guerre\" contre Boko Haram a commenc\u00e9 - Cameroon\n| work = ReliefWeb\n| accessdate = 2014-06-10\n| date = 2014-06-06\n| language = French\n| url = http://reliefweb.int/report/cameroon/dans-le-nord-du-cameroun-la-guerre-contre-boko-haram-commenc\n}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2006 a final resolution to the dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria over the oil-rich [[Bakassi peninsula]] was expected. In October 2002, the International Court of Justice had ruled in favour of Cameroon. Nonetheless, a lasting solution would require agreement by both countries\u2019 presidents, parliaments, and by the [[United Nations]]. The peninsula was the site of fighting between the two countries in 1994 and again in June 2005, which led to the death of a Cameroonian soldier. In 2006, Nigerian troops left the peninsula.\n\n==Football==\nCameroon has received some international attention following the relative success of its [[Cameroon national football team|football team]]. It has qualified for the FIFA World Cup on a number of occasions. Its most notable performance was at [[Italia 90]], when the team beat [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], the then reigning Champions in the opening game; Cameroon eventually lost in extra time in the Quarterfinals to [[England national football team|England]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ambazonia]]\n*[[History of Africa]]\n*[[Politics of Cameroon]]\n*[[List of heads of government of Cameroon]]\n*[[List of heads of state of Cameroon]]\n* Douala [[Douala#History|history]] and [[Timeline of Douala|timeline]]\n* Yaound\u00e9 [[Yaounde#History|history]] and [[Timeline of Yaounde|timeline]]\n\n==References==\n* [https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26431.htm  Background Note: Cameroon] from the U.S. Department of State.\n* Bullock, A.

It is comparable in size to [[Papua New Guinea]]. Cameroon's landmass is {{convert|472710|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, with {{convert|2730|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of water.\n\nThe country is located in Central and West Africa, bordering the [[Bight of Biafra]], between [[Equatorial Guinea]] and [[Nigeria]].\n\nCameroon is sometimes described as \"Africa in miniature\" because it exhibits all the major climates and vegetation of the continent: mountains, desert, rain forest, savanna grassland, and ocean coastland. Cameroon can be divided into five geographic zones. These are distinguished by dominant physical, climatic, and vegetative features.\n\n==Natural regions==\n[[Image:Cameroon Topography.png|thumb|Topography of Cameroon]]\n{{MapLibrary|Cameroon_sat.png|Cameroon}}\nCameroon's coastal plain extends {{convert|10|to|50|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} inland from the [[Gulf of Guinea]] (part of the Atlantic Ocean) to the edge of a plateau. In the former western state, however, the mass of [[Mount Cameroon]] reaches almost to the sea.  The plain is densely forested including areas of [[Central African mangroves]] especially around [[Douala]] and in the estuary of the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] on the border with [[Nigeria]].\n\nThe low [[South Cameroon Plateau]], rising from the coastal plain and dominated by tropical rain forest, has an average elevation of {{convert|1500|to|2000|ft|m|sigfig=1|order=flip}}. It is less humid than the coast.\n\nIn western Cameroon is an irregular chain of mountains, hills, and plateaus that extends from Mount Cameroon almost to [[Lake Chad]] at the northern tip of the country. This region includes the [[Bamenda highlands|Bamenda]], [[Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 highlands|Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9]], and [[Mambilla highlands]]. It also contains some of the country's most fertile soils, notably around volcanic Mt. Cameroon. This area of tropical forest has been categorised by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as the [[Cameroonian Highlands forests]] [[ecoregion]] with [[Mount Cameroon and Bioko montane forests|Mount Cameroon]] considered separately because as an active volcano it has a distinct environment from the other mountains.\n\nFrom the forested southern plateau the land rises northward to the grassy, rugged [[Adamaoua highlands|Adamaoua]] (Adamawa) highlands. Stretching across Cameroon from the western mountain area, the Adamaoua forms a barrier between the north and south. Its average elevation is {{convert|3400|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n\nThe southern [[savanna|savanna plain]] extends from the edge of the Adamaoua to Lake Chad. Its characteristic vegetation is scrub and grass. This is region of sparse rainfall and high median temperatures has been included as part of the [[East Sudanian savanna]] ecoregion.\n\n[[Image:Mount Cameroon craters.jpg|thumb|left|Mount Cameroon craters]]\n\n== Climate ==\n \nThe climate varies with terrain, from tropical along the coast to semiarid and hot in the north.\nExceedingly hot and humid, the coastal belt includes some of the wettest places on earth. For example, [[Debundscha]], at the base of Mt. Cameroon, has an average annual rainfall of {{convert|405|in|mm|order=flip}}.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120525195312/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html Highest Average Annual Precipitation Extremes].

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the [[National Assembly of Cameroon]].\n\n==Political background==\nThe government adopted legislation in 1990 to authorize the formation of multiple [[political party|political parties]] and ease restrictions on forming civil associations and private newspapers. Cameroon's first multiparty legislative and presidential elections were held in 1992 followed by [[municipal]] elections in 1996 and another round of legislative and presidential elections in 1997. Because the government refused to consider opposition demands for an independent election commission, the three major opposition parties boycotted the October 1997 presidential election, which Biya easily won. The leader of one of the opposition parties, [[Bello Bouba Maigari]] of the [[NUDP]], subsequently joined the government.\n\nCameroon has a number of independent newspapers. [[Censorship]] was abolished in 1996, but the government sometimes seizes or suspends newspapers and occasionally arrests [[journalist]]s. Although a 1990 law authorizes private radio and television stations, the government has not granted any licenses as of March 1998.\n\nThe Cameroonian Government's [[human rights]] record has been improving over the years but remains flawed. There continue to be reported abuses, including beatings of detainees, arbitrary arrests, and illegal searches. The judiciary is frequently corrupt, inefficient, and subject to political influence.<ref>[http://report.globalintegrity.org/Cameroon/2008 ''Global Integrity Report: Cameroon 2008''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120713025819/http://report.globalintegrity.org/Cameroon/2008 |date=13 July 2012 }} Retrieved 2012-02-14.</ref>\n\nWorthy of note is the fact that Cameroon is the only country in which two Constitutions are applicable side-by-side. For example, the 1972 Constitution designates the Prime Minister as constitutional successor of the Head of State in case of incapacity, death, resignation or unaccountable absence of the incumbent. Contrarily, the 1996 Constitutional Reform designates the President of the Senate as constitutional successor; but the Senate (provided for by 1996 Reform) does not exist. Apart from increasing the presidential mandate from 5 years to 7 years, very few amendments of the 1996 Constitutional Reform have been applied.\n\n==Executive branch==\n{{office-table}}\n|[[President of Cameroon|President]]\n|[[Paul Biya]]\n|[[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]]\n|6 November 1982\n|-\n|[[Prime Minister of Cameroon|Prime Minister]]\n|[[Phil\u00e9mon Yang]]\n|[[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]]\n|30 June 2009\n|}\n[[Image:Paul biya and colin powell.jpg|thumb|left|Cameroon President [[Paul Biya]] (right) with [[Colin Powell]]|alt=Colin Powell and Cameroon president Paul Biya, smiling and talking]]\nThe 1972 [[constitution]] of the '''Republic of Cameroon''' as modified by 1996 reforms provides for a strong central government dominated by the executive. The [[Presidents of Cameroon|president]] is empowered to name and dismiss [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] members (regardless of parliamentary representation), [[judge]]s, [[general]]s, provincial [[governor]]s, [[prefect]]s, [[sub-prefect]]s, and heads of Cameroon's [[parastatal]] (about 100 state-controlled) firms, obligate or disburse expenditures, approve or [[veto]] regulations, declare states of emergency, and appropriate and spend profits of parastatal firms. The president is not required to consult the National Assembly.  In 2008, a constitutional amendment was passed that eliminated term limits for president.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Cameroon parliament extends Biya's term limit|date=11 April 2008|newspaper=France 24|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20080411-cameroon-parliament-paul-biya-term-limit-extension|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008042404/http://www.france24.com/en/20080411-cameroon-parliament-paul-biya-term-limit-extension |archivedate=8 October 2009|deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\nThe judiciary is subordinate to the executive branch's [[Ministry of Justice of Cameroon|Ministry of Justice]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Ministry of Justice of Cameroon site |url=http://minjustice.gov.cm/}}</ref>. The [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] may review the constitutionality of a law only at the president's request.\n\nAll local government officials are employees of the central government's Ministry of Territorial Administration, from which local governments also get most of their budgets.\n\nWhile the president, the minister of justice, and the president's judicial advisers (the Supreme Court) top the judicial hierarchy, traditional rulers, courts, and councils also exercise functions of government. Traditional courts still play a major role in domestic, property, and [[probate law]]. [[Tribal law]]s and customs are honored in the formal court system when not in conflict with national law. Traditional rulers receive stipends from the national government.\n\n==Legislative branch==\nThe 180-member National Assembly meets in ordinary session three times a year (March/April, June/July, and November/December), and has seldom, until recently, made major changes in legislation proposed by the executive. Laws are adopted by majority vote of members present or, if the president demands a second reading, of a total membership.\n\nFollowing government pledges to reform the strongly centralized 1972 constitution, the National Assembly adopted a number of amendments in December 1995 which were promulgated in January 1996. The amendments call for the establishment of a 100-member [[senate]] as part of a [[bicameral legislature]], the creation of regional councils, and the fixing of the presidential term to 7 years, renewable once.

The drop in commodity prices for its principal [[export]]s &mdash;[[petroleum]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[coffee]], and [[cotton]] &mdash; in the mid-1980s, combined with an overvalued [[currency]] and economic mismanagement, led to a decade-long [[recession]]. Real per capita [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] fell by more than 60% from 1986 to 1994. The current account and fiscal [[Government budget deficit|deficit]]s widened, and [[foreign debt]] grew. Yet because of its [[oil reserves]] and favorable agricultural conditions, Cameroon still has one of the best-endowed primary commodity economies in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].\n\n==Finance and Banking==\n\nCameroon\u2019s financial system is the largest in the [[CEMAC]] region. Access to financial services is limited, particularly for SMEs. Aside from a traditional tendency for banks to prefer dealing with large, established companies, determining factors are also found in interest rates for loans to SMEs being capped at 15 percent and being heavily taxed. As of 2006, bank loans to SMEs hardly reached 15 percent of total outstanding loans.\n\nLess than 5 percent of Cameroonians have access to a bank account. While the microfinance sector is consequently becoming increasingly important, its development is hampered by a loose regulatory and supervisory framework for [[microfinance]] institutions (MFIs). The banking sector is highly concentrated and dominated by foreign commercial banks. 6 out of the 11 largest commercial banks are foreign-owned, and the three largest banks hold more than 50 percent of total financial system assets. While foreign banks generally display good solvency ratios, small domestic banks are in a much weaker position. Their capitalization is well below the average of banks in the CEMAC region and their profits are close to 2 percent, compared to 20 percent for foreign banks in the country. This is partially explained by the high levels of non-performing loans, which reached 12 percent in 2007, leading to most banks holding large amounts of excess reserves as a percentage of deposits and large levels of unutilized liquidity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/cameroon/cameroon-financial-sector-profile.html|title=Cameroon Financial Sector Profile: MFW4A - Making Finance Work for Africa|website=www.mfw4a.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Cameroon's financial system is being requested by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to increase its tax base to cover the losses from the North-West and South-West Cameroon's regions instabilities, the loss of oil revenue, the failure to deliver on port facilities, and the decline in oil production from mature oil fields.  <ref>IMF.org</ref>\n\n==Macro-economic trend==\n<!--[[File:YaoundePanoramicView.jpeg|center|upright=2.0|thumb|Yaounde, the second economic center of the country]]-->\n\nRecent signs, however, are encouraging. As of March 1998, Cameroon's fifth IMF program &mdash; a 3-year enhanced structural adjustment program approved in August 1997 &mdash; is on track. Cameroon has rescheduled its [[Paris Club]] debt at favorable terms. GDP has grown by about 5% a year beginning in 1995. There is cautious optimism that Cameroon is emerging from its long period of economic hardship.\n\n[[Image:2006Cameroonian exports.PNG|thumb|left|200px|Cameroonian exports in 2006]]\nThe [[Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility]] (ESAF) signed recently by the IMF and Government of Cameroon calls for greater macroeconomic planning and financial accountability; [[privatization]] of most of Cameroon's nearly 100 remaining non-financial parastatal enterprises; elimination of state marketing board [[monopoly|monopolies]] on the export of cocoa, certain coffees, and cotton; privatization and price competition in the [[banking]] sector; implementation of the 1992 [[labor code]]; a vastly improved judicial system; and political liberalization to boost investment.\n\n[[France]] is Cameroon's main trading partner and source of private investment and [[foreign aid]]. Cameroon has an investment guaranty agreement and a bilateral accord with the [[United States]]. USA investment in Cameroon is about $1 million, most of it in the oil sector. Inflation has been brought back under control. Cameroon aims at becoming emerging by 2035.\n\nThis is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Cameroon at market prices [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcselm.cfm?G=2001 estimated] by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of Central African CFA Francs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Many of these measures have been painful; the government slashed [[civil service]] salaries by 65% in 1993. The [[CFA franc]] &mdash; the common currency of Cameroon and 13 other African states &mdash; was devalued by 50% in January 1994. The government failed to meet the conditions of the first four IMF programs.\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=1980&ey=2023&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=622&s=NGDP_RPCH,PPPGDP,PPPPC,PCPIPCH,GGXWDG_NGDP&grp=0&a=&pr.x=35&pr.y=12|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-08-29|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=en-US|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Year\n!1980\n!1985\n!1990\n!1995\n!2000\n!2005\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n|-\n|GDP in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|10.84 Bln.\n|21.84 Bln.\n|22.62 Bln.\n|23.22 Bln.\n|31.52 Bln.\n|43.88 Bln.\n|46.80 Bln.\n|50.40 Bln.\n|53.18 Bln.\n|54.76 Bln.\n|57.33 Bln.\n|60.93 Bln.\n|64.87 Bln.\n|69.48 Bln.\n|74.89 Bln.\n|79.98 Bln.\n|84.60 Bln.\n|88.86 Bln.\n|-\n|GDP per capita in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|1,228\n|2,161\n|1,935\n|1,715\n|2,028\n|2,460\n|2,551\n|2,673\n|2,744\n|2,748\n|2,807\n|2,910\n|3,023\n|3,159\n|3,322\n|3,461\n|3,572\n|3,660\n|-\n|GDP growth<br /><small>(real)</small>\n|9.9 %\n|8.1 %\n|\u22126.2 %\n|3.3 %\n|3.6 %\n|2.0 %\n|3.5 %\n|4.9 %\n|3.5 %\n|2.2 %\n|3.4 %\n|4.1 %\n|4.5 %\n|5.4 %\n|5.9 %\n|5.6 %\n|4.5 %\n|3.2 %\n|-\n|Inflation<br /><small>(in Percent)</small>\n|7.7 %\n|4.2 %\n|1.5 %\n|25.8 %\n|1.2 %\n|2.0 %\n|4.9 %\n|1.1 %\n|5.3 %\n|3.0 %\n|1.3 %\n|2.9 %\n|2.4 %\n|2.1 %\n|1.9 %\n|2.7 %\n|0.9 %\n|0.6 %\n|-\n|Government debt<br /><small>(Percentage of GDP)</small>\n|...\n|...\n|...\n|...\n|79 %\n|48 %\n|20 %\n|15 %\n|12 %\n|12 %\n|15 %\n|16 %\n|15 %\n|18 %\n|22 %\n|31 %\n|31 %\n|34 %\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cameroon]]\n* [[Transport in Cameroon]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*{{dmoz|Regional/Africa/Cameroon/Business_and_Economy/Economic_Development}}\n*[http://www.trademap.org/open_access/Index.aspx?proceed=true&reporter=120 Cameroon latest trade data on ITC Trade Map]\n*[http://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/Country/CMR/Year/2012/Summary World Bank Summary Trade Statistics Cameroon]\n{{World Trade Organization}}\n{{Africa in topic|Economy of}}\n{{Cameroon topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Economy Of Cameroon}}\n[[Category:Economy of Cameroon| ]]\n[[Category:World Trade Organization member economies|Cameroon]]\n[[Category:African Union member economies|Cameroon]]", "sha1": "89vperm1rtkleseyk504aj5wvzuwv1l"}}, {"title": "Telecommunications in Cameroon", "ns": "0", "id": "5453", "revision": {"id": "864015722", "parentid": "863997986", "timestamp": "2018-10-14T15:27:54Z", "contributor": {"username": "Spinningspark", "id": "3727527"}, "comment": "Reverted [[WP:AGF|good faith]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/49.191.143.232|49.191.143.232]] ([[User talk:49.191.143.232|talk]]): [[WP:CITEVAR]].

A number of small patrol boats have been acquired or ordered from France. Latest estimates indicate naval strength consists of two combat patrol vessels, three coastal patrol vessels and approximately 30 smaller inshore and river patrol craft allocated to both the navy and the local gendarmerie. These include two 135 tonne Yunnan-class landing craft, which are able to carry and launch smaller craft for troop insertions. Some effort has been made to assess equipment needs to bring L'Audacieux P103 and Bakassi P104 to an effective combat status. This has resulted in weapons capabilities being reduced in favour of an increase in serviceability and the service is now effectively without missile attack capabilities. Bakassi (a Type P 48S missile patrol craft) completed a major refit at Lorient, France in August 1999. This included removing the Exocet missile system and EW equipment, and fitting a funnel aft of the mainmast to replace the waterline exhausts. New radars were also installed. Bakassi is now armed only with 40&nbsp;mm cannon. Although the Bizerte (P48 large patrol craft) class L'Audacieux is fitted for SS-12M missiles these are not embarked and its operational status is in some doubt, having not been reported at sea since 1995.

The landscape varies from dry plains to high active volcanoes with cliffs rising steeply from the ocean. The climate is arid.\n\nThe [[archipelago]] consists of ten (10) islands and five (5) islets, divided into the windward ([[Barlavento Islands|Barlavento]]) and leeward ([[Sotavento Islands|Sotavento]]) groups. The six (6) islands in the Barlavento group are [[Santo Ant\u00e3o, Cape Verde|Santo Ant\u00e3o]], [[S\u00e3o Vicente, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Vicente]], [[Santa Luzia, Cape Verde|Santa Luzia]], [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]], [[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal]], and [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]]. The islands in the Sotavento group are [[Maio, Cape Verde|Maio]], [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]], [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]], and [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]]. All but Santa Luzia are inhabited.\n\nThree islands &ndash; Sal, Boa Vista, and Maio &ndash; generally are level and lack natural water supplies. Mountains higher than {{convert|1280|m|ft|0}} are found on Santiago, Fogo, Santo Ant\u00e3o, and S\u00e3o Nicolau.\n\nSand carried by high winds has caused erosion on all islands, especially the windward ones. Sheer, jagged cliffs rise from the sea on several of the mountainous islands. The lack of natural vegetation in the uplands and coast also contributes to soil erosion.

During the winter, storms blowing from the [[Sahara]] sometimes form dense dust clouds that obscure the sun; however, sunny days are the norm year round. The clearest skies are found between February and June, with very little rainfall during these months. Saharan dust, Harmattan wind, laden dust from the Sahara. This occurs between November and March and is generally similar to the \"Calima\" affecting the Canary Islands.\n\nThe ocean near Cabo Verde is an area of [[tropical cyclone]] formation; since these storms have the whole Atlantic over which to develop as they move westward, they are among the most intense hurricanes, and are called [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]]s.\n\nThe Cape Verde islands are a very degradated area. Also, most islands do not always get a monsoon. In fact, it is not surprising that some atmospheric precipitation of islands are limited  in tropical rain.\n\nIf rain arrives, it is usually between August and October. The first \"rainy season\" brings high temperatures and high humidity that condenses as dew mountain. The other rainy season is between December and June, when the northeast trade winds are common during this season, only altitudes above 600m tend to receive regular rain.\nThe island of Sal receives an average of 0.0mm in May. When the rain comes, if it comes, it can be very strong. Half of the rain in a particular year can often fall into a single storm.\nMost of the Cape Verde islands are dry, but on islands with high mountains and farther away from the continental land mass, by orography, the humidity is much higher, giving a rainforest habitat, very degraded by the strong human presence.\nNortheastern slopes of high mountains often receive a lot of rain and southwestern slopes do not. This is because they are umbria areas, situated in the north hillsides or slopes of the mountainous areas, oriented behind the sun in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], in the shadyside [[Orography|orographic]]. So the amount of [[solar radiation]] that it receive is much lower than it would if it had without the island's relief  which intercepts much of the sun. In terms of botanical ecology, these umbria areas are identified as being cool and moist.\n\nThe current north of the Canaries, has a cooling effect on the islands of Cabo Verde, making the air temperature more bearable than it would expect in any case at this latitude. Conversely, the islands do not receive the upwellings (cold streams) that affect the West African coast, so the air temperature is cooler than in Senegal, but the sea is actually warmer, because the orographic relief of some islands, such as Sao Miguel with steep mountains, cover it with rich woods and luxuriant vegetation where the humid air condenses and soak the plants, rocks, soil, logs, moss etc.\n\nHurricanes often begin their training in the waters around the islands of Cabo Verde, but it is rare that the strength of the storm reaches close to the islands. A  Cape Verde type hurricane is formed in the area south of the islands, near Sao Miguel, after a tropical wave on the African continent during the rainy season. The storm picks up strength when it crosses the warm waters of Atlantic.\n\nThe [[laurel forest]] is a type of cloud forest, the [[cloud forest]]s, are developed preferably about [[mountain]]s, where the dense [[moisture]] from the sea or ocean, is precipitated by the action of the relief. Opposing the terrain to a front of warm, moist air mass, it forces to increase the height above sea level of that body wet and warm air mass, which cools and decreases the [[dew point]], causing it to condense part of the moisture that falls as rain or fog, creating a habitat especially cool, saturated with moisture in the air and soil.\n\nIt is the balance between the dry and warm influence of the subtropical anticyclone, hot and dry summer and [[orography]] the responsible for carrying  cool wet.\nAs latitude increases, this increases the impact of the storms, which in its journey from west to east, swept the western coasts of continents, dumping heavy rains as carrying high humidity.\nPrecipitation multiply if these air masses are crossing mountains in the way. The resulting climate is wetter, but with an annual oscillation of the temperature moderated by the proximity of the ocean.\nAppear mostly occupying favorable areas named geographically [[Umbria]]s, this is north hillsides or slopes of the mountainous areas that are oriented behind the sun, because the islands are in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], between 600 and 1500 meters, thus benefiting from the humidity provided by the [[trade winds]] to form such a sea of clouds. In its botanical ecology, the mountain umbria is identified with cool and moisture.\n\n== Flora ==\n\nCape Verde is the driest archipelago of the ecoregion of [[Macaronesia]]. That with a greater influence of African species due to its geographical location near the African mainland of the Sahel.\nAt first, the islands of Cabo Verde housed an extensive savanna and [[dry forest]] [[forest cover|cover]], but mostly it was removed to convert to agricultural land, which, together with the arid climate and rugged terrain, has led to a soil erosion and desertification widespread. However, the archipelago can be divided into four broad ecological zones (arid, semiarid, subhumid and humid), according to altitude and average annual rainfall ranging from 200&nbsp;mm in the arid areas of the coast to  more than 1 000&nbsp;mm in the humid mountain. Mostly rainfall precipitation is due to condensation of the ocean mist. Today much of the forest cover comprises relatively immature agroforestry plantations, in which are used non-native species such as Prosopis juliflora, Leucaena leucocephala and Jatropha curcas. The native [[laurel forest]] species are in wet area only in mountainous areas.\n\nOn the lower and drier islands the vegetation before human colonization consisted of savanna or steppe vegetation, with the flattest inland portion supporting semi-desert plants. At higher altitudes, a form of arid shrubland was also present. Once this islands were covered with savanna on the plains and arid shrubland on the mountainsides, but over 500 years of human habtitation, since colonisation by the Portuguese in the 15th century, nearly all the original vegetation has been cleared by widespread agriculture including the grazing of goats, sheep and cattle and the planting of imported crop species. There are some remaining patches of dry forest high on steep mountainside including a number of endemic plant species, but these are inaccessible and hard to study.\n\nOn the higher islands and somewhat wetter islands, exclusively in mountainous areas, like Santo Antao island, the climate is suitable for the development of dry monsoon forest, and [[laurel forest]] as this vegetation is believed to have been present in the past. However, most vegetation has now been converted to agriculture and forest fragments are now restricted to areas where cultivation is not possible, such as mountain peaks and steep slopes. The demand for wood has resulted in deforestation and desertification.\n\nOf particular note is the [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] type of [[humid subtropical]] [[laurel forest]] of macaronesian laurisilva, found on several of the [[Macaronesia]]n islands of the [[North Atlantic]] and Macaronesian African mainland enclaves, namely [[Madeira Islands]], the [[Azores]], Cape Verde Islands and the [[Canary Islands]], a [[relict]] of the [[Pliocene]] [[subtropical]] [[forest]]s, supporting numerous endemic species.\n\nThis [[laurisilva]] forests are found in the islands of [[Macaronesia]] in the eastern Atlantic, in particular the [[Azores]], [[Madeira Islands]], and western [[Canary Islands]], from 400&nbsp;m to 1200&nbsp;m elevation. Trees of the genera ''[[Apollonias]]'' ([[Lauraceae]]), ''[[Ocotea]]'' (Lauraceae), ''[[Persea]]'' (Lauraceae), ''[[Clethra]]'' (Clethraceae), ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'' ([[Ruscaceae]]), and ''[[Picconia]]'' ([[Oleaceae]]) are characteristic.<ref>[http://www.madeirabirds.com/madeira_laurel_forest Madeira Laurel Forest], Madeira Wind Birds 2005</ref> The Madeira Islands laurel forest was designated a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1999.\n\n== Fauna ==\n\nThere are four endemic bird species including the [[Raso lark]] along with more common [[swifts]], [[larks]], [[warblers]], and [[sparrows]]. The islands are an important breeding site for seabirds including the [[Cape Verde shearwater]] and [[Fea's petrel]] (''Pterodroma feae''), which breeds only here and in [[Madeira]]. Santiago Island holds the only breeding site of the endemic and critically endangered [[Bourne's heron]].  The 11 endemic reptile species include a giant gecko (''[[Tarentola]] gigas''), and there are other [[gecko]]s  and [[skink]]s in abundance. The giant skink (''[[Macroscincus coctei]]'') is now thought to be extinct.\n\n== Threats and protection ==\n\nAlmost all of the natural environment has been destroyed by conversion to agriculture and logging for firewood, as well as natural [[soil erosion]], all of which has threatened several species of birds and reptiles. The remaining original forest exists at high altitudes only. Newer problems include illegal beach sand extraction and [[overfishing]] while the nesting birds are vulnerable to introduced mammals including cats and rats.\n\n; Environment - international agreements:\n:* Party to: [[Biodiversity]], [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Desertification]], Endangered Species, [[Environmental Modification Convention|Environmental Modification]], [[Hazardous Wastes]], [[Law of the Sea]], [[Marine Dumping]], [[Nuclear Test Ban]], Ship Pollution, Wetlands\n:* Signed, but not ratified: None of the selected agreements\n\n== Visiting the ecoregion ==\n\nThe higher altitudes of the islands are accessible on the islands of [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]], where there is a road to the volcano and walks up to the crater, and the mountainous [[Santo Ant\u00e3o, Cape Verde|Santo Ant\u00e3o]] where there are hiking routes.\n\n== Extreme points ==\n* Northernmost point - [[Ponta do Sol, Cape Verde|Ponta do Sol]] on [[Santo Ant\u00e3o, Cape Verde|Santao Ant\u00e3o]] Island\n* Southernmost point - [[Ponta Nho Martinho]] on [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]]\n* Westernmost point - [[Ponta Chao de Mongrade]] on [[Santo Ant\u00e3o, Cape Verde|Santao Ant\u00e3o]]*\n* Easternmost point - [[Ponta Meringuel]] on [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]]\n* *''Note: this is also the westernmost point of Africa''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{CIA World Factbook}}\n* {{NatGeo ecoregion|id=at0201|name=Cape Verde Islands dry forests}}\n* {{WWF ecoregion|name=Cape Verde Islands dry forests|id=at0201}}\n\n{{Geography of Africa}}\n{{Africa topic|Climate of}}\n{{Cape Verde topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Geography Of Cape Verde}}\n[[Category:Geography of Cape Verde| ]]", "sha1": "5pk0fqrp6ib7y3c573vwcg1t5wozyqw"}}, {"title": "Demographics of Cape Verde", "ns": "0", "id": "5461", "revision": {"id": "857079997", "parentid": "855071869", "timestamp": "2018-08-29T12:44:50Z", "contributor": {"username": "Afus199620", "id": "30645640"}, "comment": "/* Vital statistics */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:IMG0053a.jpg|thumb|right|Two Cape Verdean children playing]]\nThis article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Cape Verde]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.\n\nCape Verde has a population of about {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Cabo Verde}}|,||}} round -4}} inhabitants, divided evenly of those who live in the islands and the ones who live abroad in the Cape Verdean diaspora in mainland Africa, Europe, U.S., Brazil, et cetera.

Subsequently,  enslaved Africans and Portuguese convicts were brought to the islands to work as agricultural field hands. As a result of the intermingling and genetic liaison of the said populations, some of the present day Cape Verdeans are considered  ''[[mulatto]]es'', who have mixed [[Black people|black]] and [[White people|white]] origins. European ancestors also include [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Italians|Italian]] and [[French people|French]] seamen who were granted land by the [[Portuguese Empire]], followed by Portuguese settlers, exiles, and Portuguese Jews who were victims of the [[Portuguese Inquisition|Inquisition]] yet perpetrated slavery. Many foreigners from other parts of the world settled in Cape Verde as their permanent country. Most of them were [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[French people|French]], [[British people|British]] ([[English people|English]]), [[Arab]] and Jewish (from [[Lebanon]] and [[Morocco]]). All of these have been absorbed into the ''mixed'' population.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe high degree of genetic mixture of individuals is a result of centuries of migration.  It is not unusual to encounter persons with dark skin, blond hair, and blue eyes, and persons with seemingly light caucasian skin and textured curly hair.\n\nSurvival in a country with few natural resources has historically induced Cape Verdeans to emigrate. In fact, of the more than 1 million people of Cape Verdean ancestry in the world, only a little more than one-third actually live on the islands. Some 500,000 people of Cape Verdean ancestry live in the [[United States]], mainly in [[New England]]. Many people of Cape Verdean ancestry also live in [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Mexico]], [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]], and [[Senegal]]. Cape Verdean populations also settled [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[Canada]], and other [[Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries|CPLP countries]] ([[Angola]], [[Brazil]] and [[Guinea-Bissau]]). Since after independence from Portugal in 1975, a number of Cape Verdean students continued to be admitted every year at Portuguese high schools, polytechnical institutes and universities, through bilateral agreements between the Portuguese and Cape Verdean governments.\n\nPortuguese functions as a state language. Virtually all formal documents and official declarations are stated in Portuguese. But it is not the first language. Cape Verdean, commonly called Creolo, is spoken as a mother tongue by virtually all Cape Verdeans, irrespective of social status or religious affiliation. Moreover, historical linguists often attribute Cape Verdean Creole as the oldest \"New World\" contact language. It is a \"contact\" language in the sense that it was birthed and evolved between linguistically different groups who, by necessity, had to create a common language to communicate with each other. There is a rich repertoire of literature and songs in Cape Verdean Creole. In religion, the majority of Cape Verdeans follow [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Christianity]]. There are some [[Protestants]], [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]]s and [[Islam|Muslims]].\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Cape-Verde-demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of Cape Verde, Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]\n[[File:Pyramide Cap-Vert.PNG|thumb]]\nAccording to {{UN_Population|source}} the total population was {{UN_Population|Cabo Verde}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to only 178 000 in 1950.

This became the [[African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde]] (PAICV) in 1980, as Cape Verde sought to distance itself from [[Guinea-Bissau]], following unrest in that country.\n\nIn 1991, following growing pressure for a more pluralistic society, multi-party elections were held for the first time. The opposition party, the [[Movement for Democracy (Cape Verde)|Movement for Democracy]] (''Movimento para a Democracia'', MpD), won the legislative elections, and formed the government. The MpD candidate also defeated the PAICV candidate in the presidential elections. In the 1996 elections, the MpD increased their majority, but in the 2001 the PAICV returned to power, winning both the Legislative and the Presidential elections.\n\nGenerally, Cape Verde enjoys a stable democratic system. The elections have been considered free and fair, there is a free press, and the rule of law is respected by the State. In acknowledgment of this, [[Freedom House]] granted Cape Verde two 1st in its annual [[Freedom in the World]] report, a perfect score. It is the only African country to receive this score.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe Prime Minister is the head of the government and as such proposes other ministers and secretaries of state.

Both are now disused.\n\n'''Roadways:'''\n<br />''total:''\n10,000&nbsp;km including unpaved tracks accessible only to four wheel drive vehicles\n<br />''asphalt:''\n360&nbsp;km\n<br />''cobbled:''\n5,000&nbsp;km (2007 estimates)\n\nThe majority of Cape Verdean roads are paved with cobblestones cut from local [[basalt]]. Recent international aid has allowed the asphalting of many roads including all of the highway between [[Praia]] and [[Tarrafal, Cape Verde|Tarrafal]], all of the highway between Praia and [[Cidade Velha]], and all of the highway between Praia, [[Pedra Badejo]], and [[Calheta de S\u00e3o Miguel]] on [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]], and the dual carriageway between [[Santa Maria, Cape Verde|Santa Maria]] and [[Espargos]] on Sal. A new ring road has been built from [[Praia International Airport]] around the city of Praia.\nThe primary method of intercity and inter-village transport for Cape Verdeans is by [[aluguer]] shared taxis, commonly called ''Yasi'', which is a derived from the name HiAce, because the [[Toyota HiAce]] is the most common shared taxi model. Few Cape Verdeans own cars, but ownership is rising rapidly with increasing prosperity, particularly on [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago Island]].\n[[File:Alternative route.jpg|thumb|An alternative route in [[Sao Domingos, Cape Verde]]]]\n\n'''[[List of ports in Cape Verde|Ports and harbor]]s:'''\n[[Mindelo]] on [[S\u00e3o Vicente, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Vicente]] is the main port for cruise liners and the terminus for the ferry service to Santo Ant\u00e3o. A marina for yachts is undergoing enlargement (2007). [[Praia]] on [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] is a main hub for local ferry services to other islands. [[Palmeira, Cape Verde|Palmeira]] on [[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal]] supplies fuel for the main airport on the island, [[Am\u00edlcar Cabral International Airport]], and is important for the hotel construction taking place on the island. [[Porto Novo, Cape Verde|Porto Novo]] on [[Santo Ant\u00e3o, Cape Verde|Santo Ant\u00e3o]] is the only source for imports and exports of produce from the island as well as passenger traffic since the closure of the airstrip at Ponta do Sol. There are smaller harbors, essentially single jetties at [[Tarrafal de S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde (municipality)#Tarrafal de S\u00e3o Nicolau (town)|Tarrafal]] on [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]], [[Sal Rei]] on [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]], [[Vila do Maio, Cape Verde|Vila do Maio]] (Porto Ingl\u00eas) on [[Maio, Cape Verde|Maio]], [[S\u00e3o Filipe, Cape Verde (municipality)#S\u00e3o Filipe(city)|S\u00e3o Filipe]] on [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]] and [[Furna (Brava), Cape Verde|Furna]] on [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]]. These act as terminals for the inter island ferry services which carry both freight and passengers. There are very small harbors, with protective breakwaters, essentially used by fishing boats at Tarrafal on Santiago, Pedra de Lume on Sal and Ponta do Sol on Santo Ant\u00e3o. Some offer suitable protection for small yachts on passage. The pier at Santa Maria on Sal used by both fishing and dive boats has been rehabilitated.\n\n'''[[Merchant marine]]:'''\n<br>''total:''\n10\n<br>''ships by type:''\n[[chemical tanker]] 1, trawler/[[cargo ship]] 5, passenger/cargo 5\n<br>''foreign-owned:'' 2 (Spain 1, UK 1) (2008)\n\n'''[[List of airports in Cape Verde|Airports]]'''\n*7 operational in 2014 - 4 international and 3 domestic.\n*2 non-operational, one on Brava and the other on Santo Ant\u00e3o, closed for safety reasons.\n*Over 3,047 m: 1\n*1,524 to 2,437 m: 3\n*914 to 1,400 m: 3\n\n'''International Airports:'''\n* [[Am\u00edlcar Cabral International Airport]], [[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal Island]].

Currently (2007) these flights are on Wednesdays, but schedules vary and are subject to frequent change. It also has flights four times weekly from Lisbon to Francisco Mendes the recently opened airport at Praia on Santiago island and four times weekly from Lisbon to [[Am\u00edlcar Cabral International Airport]] on [[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal island]]. There is a flight on Mondays from [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport]] to Sal and on Thursdays from [[Amsterdam Schiphol Airport]] via [[Munich-Riem Airport]] to Sal. Return flights are just after midnight on the same day.\n\nFrom [[Las Palmas]] in the [[Canary Islands]], Spain there are night flights on Mondays and Thursdays, with departures just after midnight. Return flights are the previous day. There is a service from Praia to [[Fortaleza]], Brazil on Mondays and Thursdays departing early evening and returning at night. All international flights are operated by Boeing 757 aircraft. Most international flights are subject to intermittent delay and sometimes cancellation.\n\n[[TAP Air Portugal]] the Portuguese national carrier operates a daily service from Lisbon to Sal with late evening departures returning after midnight and reaching Lisbon in the early morning. Most flights are delayed and onward connections from Lisbon can be missed as a result. TAP and other European carriers provide connections with most European capitals, enabling same day through flights.\n\nFrom the UK, direct routes by [[Astraeus]] from [[London Gatwick]] and [[Manchester Airport]] to Sal ceased in April 2008, their website has not been taking reservations since May 2008. [[TACV Cabo Verde Airlines]] opened a route from [[London Stansted]] in October 2008 though it was rumoured that flights were being cancelled due to minimum take up though with effect from May 2008, TACV have ceased flights from [[London Gatwick]]. There is a [http://www.flytacv.com Fly TACV website], and you can book from their website.

Various options and bookings can be made via [https://web.archive.org/web/20080705221214/http://thomsonfly.com/ Thomsonfly] to both Sal and Boa Vista.\n\n[[Hamburg International]] provides a charter service from Hamburg via D\u00fcsseldorf on Thursdays and Condor operatus from [[Frankfurt Airport|Frankfurt Rhein Main]] on Tuesdays returning on Wednesday.\n\n[[Neos (airline)|Neos]] operates charter flights from [[Milan Malpensa]], [[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport|Rome Fiumcino]] and [[Bologna Airport|Bologna]] on Wednesdays.\n\nReturn fares from European airports are generally around \u00a3400 or \u20ac600. Fares from North American airports are generally close to $1000 but special offers are often available.\n\nTACV Cabo Verde Airlines, the national airline has been a monopoly carrier within the island archipelago (2007). It operates services from the main hub airports at Sal and Santiago to Boa Vista, Fogo, Maio, S\u00e3o Nicolau and S\u00e3o Vicente at frequencies ranging from thrice weekly to thrice daily. Air strips on the other islands of Brava and Santo Ant\u00e3o are closed (2007) and can only be reached by ferry services from other islands.\n\nTACV does not publish timetables, but flight times are listed on departure boards, when these are functioning. Tickets can be bought at the TACV shop at each airport by queuing and paying in cash (euros or escudos). Flights are often delayed and sometimes cancelled due to weather or operational conditions. Services are operated by ATR 42 turboprop aircraft, which are currently being replaced (2007) by the enlarged ATR 72 aircraft. Inter island tariffs vary depending on the distance but are generally around \u20ac180 return. Air passes are obtainable for multiple flights, when buying an international ticket on TACV.\n\n[[Halcyonair]] a private carrier with Portuguese and Cape Verdean shareholders is commenced operations on inter-island flights during 2007. It has obtained the necessary licensing from the Cape Verde Government.\n\n== Travel within the islands ==\n[[File:2006.06.25.cv.sv.BaiadasGatas.transportes.png|thumb|400px|Minibuses (''Aluguers'') on a beach in Ba\u00eda das Gatas]][[File:AluguerEmNossaSra.jpg|thumb|400px|A minibus (''aluguer'') on the island of Brava]]\nThe frequency and regularity of publicly accessible ground transportation services vary between the islands and municipalities, however there are some common features that can be found throughout Cape Verde.  The primary mode of transportation between municipalities is via shared minibuses commonly referred to as a \"yasi\", because of the [[Toyota HiAce]] which makeup the majority of the minibuses in service.  While 12-14 passenger \"yasi\" class minibuses connect the major municipalities at their end points, modified pickup trucks with partially covered cabs and benches installed in the back transport passengers along shorter distances through minor municipalities and the rural areas in between.  These modified pickup trucks are referred to as \"hilux\" after the [[Toyota Hilux]] which is the common base model adapted.  Notably, both \"yasi\" and \"hilux\" transportation will stop and pickup any passenger that hails them, as well as drop off any passenger that requests to get off, at any point along the journey.  intermuncipality transportation licenses are granted on an individual basis to each vehicle in the name of the owner by the Direc\u00e7\u00e3o Geral dos Transportes e Rodovi\u00e1rios (General Directorate of Transport and Roads).  \nWith the exception of the Praia \u21c4 Assomada route on Santiago,  all yasi and hilux class vehicles licensed to carry passengers act as individual freelancers rather than function collectively.  As such, they do not adhere to scheduling, and have no obligation to provide service if they do not want to.  This includes many vehicles running the same route, owned by the same person.\n\n'''Brava'''\n\nHiluxes and yasis connect Furna and Nova Sintra mostly when boats arrive.  Other parts of the island are also connected by these vehicles.\n\n'''Fogo'''\n\nFogo has many yasis running the routes between S\u00e3o Filipe and Mosteiros, S\u00e3o Filipe and Ch\u00e3 das Calderas, however unlike many other islands, these buses all depart at roughly the same time every day, and despite the presence of multiple vehicles running each route, passengers can find themselves stranded if they do not board a vehicle during the limited departure window.  Yasis tend to depart Mosteiros headed to S\u00e3o Filipe around 6am, and tend to Depart S\u00e3o Filipe headed to Ch\u00e3 around noon.\n\n'''S\u00e3o Vicente'''\n\n[[Mindelo]] has a municipal bus service run by the company Transcor.  Yasi and hilux transportation connects [[Mindelo]] with other parts of the island.  Other transportation companies especially minibuses include Transporte Morabeza, Transporte Alegr\u00eda, Amizade, Sotral y Automindelo.\n\n'''Santiago'''\n\nMaura Company and Sol Atl\u00e1ntico are the only two companies that have been granted municipal bus service licenses.  Over the past decade, Maura Company, which had previously been the dominant bus company, has retired the majority of its buses, while many that continue to run are in a state of disrepair due to financial difficulties.  Sol Atl\u00e1ntico, in contrast, has greatly increased its fleet of buses, adding several new high capacity buses in 2015.  Municipal bus prices are regulated at 44 escudos per ride.  Transfers are not allowed.  Bus schedules do not exist, but buses start running around 6am and stop around 9pm.  Bus stops exist, and are frequently infiltrated by minibus vehicles (also called \"yasis\") and both (taxi) licensed and unlicensed \"clan\" taxis illegally running municipal bus routes without a municipal license.  No other city on Santiago has a municipal bus service.  The government of Assomada has solicited requests for a bus service but so far none has been approved, and there are no short term plans for any bus company to enter the municipal market.\n\nTransportation between the municipalities and rural areas is handled predominantly by yasi and hilux transportation. Rates are not fixed and range from 20 escudos for short trips between rural areas up to 500 escudos for Praia \u21c4 Tarrafal. Some commonly accepted prices charged between municipalities are 100 escudos for Praia \u21c4 S\u00e3o Domingos, 150 escudos for Praia \u21c4 Org\u00e3os, and 250 escudos for Praia \u21c4 Assomada. Some of the yasis start collecting passengers before dawn to transport between Praia and Assomada and Praia and Pedra Badejo, and the last departures usually occur between 7 and 8pm.  These vehicles do not maintain a schedule (with the exception of two early morning vehicles departing Assomada at 5:40 and 6:20 headed to Praia), instead choosing to drive around in circles within the urban centers of Praia, Assomada, and Pedra Badejo to pick up passengers until they are full, or over capacity (14 passengers is the legal limit for an actual Toyota HiAce), at which point they depart.  Yasi drivers employ helpers to hawk out the window the destination that the yasi will eventually head to, as well as the obligatory \"cheio\", meaning full, with little regard for the actual number of people on board. Helpers and drivers sometimes use [[shills]] (fake passengers) to overcome the common chicken and egg problem wherein passengers will not board an empty or low passenger minibus in an urban center because they know it will not depart until it is full, however they will board a nearly full (or over capacity) bus because they know it is likely to depart soon.  \nIn 2015 a project called [http://www.EcobusCV.com EcobusCV] started running a fleet of dual fuel [[waste vegetable oil]] / diesel modified Toyota HiACE minibuses using a scheduled service model between Praia and Assomada.  Buses depart at a rate of one per hour, on the hour, from designated bus stops in Praia, at Igreja Nova Apost\u00f3lica in Fazenda, and Assomada, in front of the court house.  The current departure schedule as of September 15 is one departure per hour, every hour starting at 7am, with the last departure at 6pm.  EcobusCV plans to expand to departures in 30 minute intervals before the end of 2015.  EcobusCV has instituted [http://ecobuscv.com/precario-e-trajetoria/ aggressive, transparent pricing] undercutting the informal generally accepted prices between municipalities, which has started to cause freelance yasis to alter their pricing.\n\nTaxis are common in Praia and Assomada. Taxis with a base in Praia are painted beige, while taxis with a base in Assomada are painted white.  They can carry passengers between municipalities, but they are prohibited from circulating and picking up passengers outside of their base city, though they will usually pickup passengers if they get hailed on their way back to their home city. Taximeters are installed in most legal taxis, but many are not functional and they are almost never used because the generally accepted rates are cheaper than what the taximeter would usually count.  In Praia there is a large number of \"clan\" or clandestine taxis that operate without paying for a license.  Most people identify Toyota Corolla hatchbacks as clans and they are frequently hailed.  While the minimum taximeter price is officially 80, in practice 100 is the minimum a person pays if they board a taxi.  Taxi rates in Praia generally go up to 250 escudos from the furthest points of the city to Plateau, and cross town taxis cap out at 400 during the day. Rates generally go up by 50 escudos after 10pm at night, though for longer distances some will try to charge an extra 100.  An exception to this rule is the airport.  Airport rates generally range from 500-1000 depending on the starting place or destination, and can go up by several hundred at night.\n\n'''Sal'''\n\nSal has unscheduled yasi service between [[Espargos]] and Santa Maria, with frequent departures in the morning from Espargos, where most locals live, to Santa Maria, where most locals work, and vice versa in the afternoon.\n\n== Inter-Island ferries in Cape Verde ==\nSeveral ferries operate between the islands with much lower fares than the airlines. These are provided by various independent shipping companies and their conditions and seaworthiness vary considerably. Many services depart from [[Praia]] at about midnight, arriving in outlying islands at breakfast time. Return trips often depart around mid-day. But service schedules are approximate only and delays or cancellations of service are common. Conditions can be very crowded it is advisable to pre-book a cabin for all but the shortest of trips. Some passages can be very rough during the winter.\n\nDeparture days vary according to the season and are frequently altered. Enquire at the shipping offices in Praia and other Cape Verdean ports.\n\nIn early 2011, the Kriola, the first of a proposed fleet of ferryboats belonging to the company Cabo Verde Fast Ferry (CVFF)<ref>[http://www.cvfastferry.com Cabo Verde Fast Ferry's website]</ref> arrived in Praia directly from Singapore.

They include two branches, the National Guard and the Coast Guard.\n\n==History==\nBefore 1975, Cape Verde was an overseas province of [[Portugal]], having a small Portuguese military garrison that included both Cape Verdean and European Portuguese soldiers.\n\nAt the same time, some Cape Verdeans were serving in the People's Revolutionary Armed Forces ({{lang|pt|For\u00e7as Armadas Revolucionarias do Povo}}, FARP), the military wing of the [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] that was fighting for the joint independence of Guinea and Cape Verde in the [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence]]. The FARP became the national armed forces of [[Guinea-Bissau]], when its independence was recognized by Portugal in 1974.\n\nThe Armed Forces of Cape Verde were created when the country became independent in 1975, being also officially designated the People's Revolutionary Armed Forces ({{lang|pt|For\u00e7as Armadas Revolucionarias do Povo}}, FARP). The Cape Verdean FARP consisted of two independent branches, the Army ({{lang|pt|Ex\u00e9rcito}}) and the Coast Guard ({{lang|pt|Guarda Costeira}}).\n\nIn the early 1990s, the designation \"FARP\" was dropped and the military of Cape Verde started to be designated the Cape Verdean Armed Forces ({{lang|pt|For\u00e7as Armadas Cabo Verdeanas}}, FACV).\n\nIn 2007, the FACV started a major reorganization that included the transformation of the Army into the National Guard ({{lang|pt|Guarda Nacional}}).\n\nTogether with the Cape Verdean Police, the FACV carried out Operation ''Flying Launch'' ({{lang|pt|Operac\u00e3o Lancha Voadora}}), a successful operation to put an end to a [[drug trafficking]] group which smuggled [[cocaine]] from [[Colombia]] to the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]] using Cape Verde as a reorder point. The operation took more than three years, being a secret operation during the first two years, and ended in 2010.\n\nAlthough located in Africa, Cape Verde had always close relations with Europe. Because of this, several opinions defend that Cape Verde may enter the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] and [[NATO]].<ref>[http://davidnoack.net/v2/2010/01/sprungbrett-nach-westafrika sprungbrett-nach-westafrika]</ref>\n\nThe most recent engagement of the FACV was the [[Monte Tchota massacre]] that resulted in 11 deaths.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-capeverde-killings-idUSKCN0XN2LA|title=Eleven shot dead in Cape Verde, including two Spanish citizens|date=2016-04-27|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-04-28}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Dornier Do-228-212, Cabo Verde - Coast Guard JP6789427.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Dornier 228 of the Cape Verdean Coast Guard]]\nThe Cape Verdean Armed Forces are part of the Ministry of National Defense of Cape Verde and include:\n* the Military bodies of command:\n** Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces (CEMFA),\n** Office of the CEMFA,\n** Staff of the Armed Forces (EMFA),\n** Personnel Command,\n** Logistics Command;\n* the National Guard;\n* the Coast Guard.\n\nThe CEMFA is Colonel, being the highest rank officer of the Armed Forces.\n\n===National Guard===\n[[Image:Policia Militar Cabo Verde 2006.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Military Police in [[Mindelo]]]]\nThe National Guard (''Guarda National'') is the main branch of the Cape Verdean Armed Forces for the military defense of the country, being responsible for the execution of land and maritime environment operations and the support to internal security.

While there is no archaeological evidence for an indigenous people on the islands, a variety of settlers from various backgrounds made their home on the islands, including [[pirate]]s, shipwrecked sailors, and deserters from [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army in [[Jamaica]].<ref>Bauman, Robert (2007) ''The Complete Guide to Offshore Residency''. p. 115. {{ISBN|0-9789210-9-7}}.</ref> Folklore suggests that the emergence of the name \u2018Cayman\u2019 is a result of a captive\u2019s successful flee from Cromwell\u2019s army. His name was Cayman Cushing, and he supposedly initiated the escape. It is believed that several other captives escaped to the islands alongside Cushing. As a result of his bravery, the runaway prisoners settled on what they called the Cayman Islands.<ref>Bauman, Robert (2007) ''The Complete Guide to Offshore Residency''. p. 117. {{ISBN|0-9789210-9-7}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cayman Islands National Museum - George Town, Grand Cayman.jpg|thumb|left|Cayman Islands National Museum, George Town, Grand Cayman]]\nThe first recorded permanent inhabitant of the Cayman Islands, Isaac Bodden, was born on [[Grand Cayman]] around 1661. He was the grandson of the original settler named Bodden who was probably one of Oliver Cromwell's soldiers at the taking of Jamaica in 1655.<ref>Keith Thompson, ''Life in The Caribbean'' (2010, {{ISBN|9987-16-015-8}}), p. 152</ref>\n\n[[Kingdom of England|England]] took [[English overseas possessions|formal control]] of the Cayman Islands, along with Jamaica, as a result of the [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)|Treaty of Madrid of 1670]]. Following several unsuccessful attempts at settlement, a permanent English-speaking population in the islands dates from the 1730s. With settlement, after the first royal land grant by the [[Governor of Jamaica]] in 1734, came the perceived need for slaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gocayman.ky/history.html |title=Cayman Islands History |publisher=Gocayman.ky |date= |archivedate=12 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012073753/http://www.gocayman.ky/history.html}}</ref> Many were brought to the islands from Africa; this is evident today with the majority of native Caymanians being of African and English descent. The results of the first census taken in the islands in 1802 showed the population on Grand Cayman to be 933 with 545 of those inhabitants being enslaved. Slavery was abolished in the Cayman Islands in 1833.

Although an MLA can only be Premier twice any person who meets the qualifications and requirements for a seat in the Legislative Assembly can be elected to the Legislative Assembly indefinitely.<ref>The Constitution of the Cayman Islands, Part VI The Legislature</ref>\n\nThere are two official members of the Legislative Assembly, the [[deputy governor|Deputy Governor]] and the [[attorney general|Attorney General]]. They are appointed by the Governor in accordance with Her Majesty's instructions, and although they have seats in the Legislative Assembly, under the 2009 Constitution, they do not vote. They serve in a professional and advisory role to the MLAs, the Deputy Governor represents the Governor who is a representative of the Queen and the British Government. While the Attorney General serves to advise on legal matters and has special responsibilities in the LA, he is generally responsible for changes to the Penal code among other things.\n\nThe seven Ministers are voted into office by the 19 elected members of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands]]. One of the Ministers, the leader of the majority political party, is appointed Premier by the Governor.\n\nAfter consulting the Premier, the Governor allocates a portfolio of responsibilities to each Cabinet Minister. Under the principle of collective responsibility, all Ministers are obliged to support in the Assembly any measures approved by Cabinet.\n\nAlmost 80 departments, sections and units carry out the business of government, joined by a number of statutory boards and authorities set up for specific purposes, such as the Port Authority, the Civil Aviation Authority, the Immigration Board, the Water Authority, the University College Board of Governors, the National Pensions Board and the Health Insurance Commission.\n\nSince 2000, there have been two official major political parties: The [[United Democratic Party (Cayman Islands)|Cayman Democratic Party]] (CDP) and the [[People's Progressive Movement (Cayman Islands)|People's Progressive Movement]] (PPM). While there has been a shift to political parties, many contending for office still run as independents. The two parties are notably similar, though they consider each other rivals in most cases, their differences are generally in personality and implementation rather than actual policy. The Cayman Islands currently lacks any real liberal or progressive representation in the Legislative Assembly or in the form of organized political parties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://portal.elections.ky/files/downloads/2017/Register-of-Political-Parties-14-March-2017.pdf|title=Official Register of Political Parties|last=|first=|date=29 August 2018|website=Cayman Islands Elections Office|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref> As of the May 2017 General Election, members of the PPM and CDP have joined together with 3 independent members to form a government coalition despite many years of enmity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.caymancompass.com/2017/05/31/premier-mclaughlin-to-lead-13-member-coalition-government/|title=\"Premier McLaughlin to lead 13-member coalition government\"|last=|first=|date=31 May 2017|work=Cayman Compass|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Defence and law enforcement===\nThe defence of the Cayman Islands is the responsibility of the United Kingdom.

These two agencies co-operate in aspects of law enforcement, including their [[Royal Cayman Islands Police Service#Joint Marine Unit|joint marine unit]]. The [[Cayman Islands Cadet Corps]] was formed in March 2001 and carries out military-type training with teenage citizens of the country. As of 2017 the PPM led Coalition government have pledged to form a Coast Guard to protect the interests of the Islands, especially in terms of illegal immigration and illegal drug importation.\n\n===Taxation===\nNo direct taxation is imposed on residents and Cayman Islands companies. The government receives the majority of its income from indirect taxation. Duty is levied against most imported goods, which is typically in the range of 22% to 25%. Some items are exempted, such as baby formula, books, cameras and certain items are taxed at 5%. Duty on automobiles depends on their value. The duty can amount to 29.5% up to $20,000.00 KYD CIF (cost, insurance and freight) and up to 42% over $30,000.00 KYD CIF for expensive models. The government charges flat licensing fees on financial institutions that operate in the islands and there are work permit fees on foreign labour. A 13% government tax is placed on all tourist accommodations in addition to US$37.50 airport departure tax which is built into the cost of an airline ticket. There are no taxes on corporate profits, capital gains, or personal income. There are no estate or death inheritance taxes payable on Cayman Islands real estate or other assets held in the Cayman Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/funds-and-fund-management-survey/pages/cayman-islands-taxation.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519012001/http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/funds-and-fund-management-survey/pages/cayman-islands-taxation.aspx|dead-url=yes|archivedate=19 May 2015|title=Cayman Islands \u2013 Taxation |publisher=KPMG }}</ref>\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{main|Foreign relations of the Cayman Islands}}\n[[File:1953caymanislands1poundelizabethIIblue.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Postage stamp with portrait of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], 1953]]\n\nForeign policy is controlled by the United Kingdom, as the islands remain an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. Although in its early days, the Cayman Islands' most important relationships were with Britain and [[Jamaica]], in recent years, as a result of economic dependence, a relationship with the United States has developed.\n\nThough the Cayman Islands is involved in no major international disputes, they have come under some criticism due to the use of their territory for narcotics trafficking and [[money laundering]]. In an attempt to address this, the government entered into the Narcotics Agreement of 1984 and the [[Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty]] of 1986 with the United States, to reduce the use of their facilities associated with these activities. In more recent years, they have stepped up the fight against money laundering, by limiting banking secrecy, introducing requirements for customer identification and record keeping, and requiring banks to co-operate with foreign investigators.\n\nDue to their status as an overseas territory of the UK, the Cayman Islands has no representation either in the [[United Nations]] or in most other international organisations. However, the Cayman Islands still participates in some international organisations, being an associate member of [[Caricom]] and [[UNESCO]], and a member of a sub-bureau of [[Interpol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Europe/United-Kingdom |title=United Kingdom / Europe / Member countries / Internet / Home \u2013 INTERPOL |publisher=Interpol.int |date=30 December 2012 |accessdate=30 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n{{main|Transport in the Cayman Islands}}\n\n===Ports===\nGeorge Town is the port capital of Grand Cayman.

Overfishing nearly extinguished the turtles from the local waters. Turtles were the main source for an economy on the islands. In 1787, Captain Hull of HMS Camilla estimated between 1,200 and 1,400 turtles were captured and sold at seaports in Jamaica per year. According to historian Edward Long the inhabitants on Grand Cayman had the principal occupation of turtle-fishery. Once Caymanian turtlers greatly reduced the turtle population around the islands they journeyed to the waters of other islands in order to maintain their livelihood.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Christopher|date=2011|title=Did Slavery Really Matter in the Cayman Islands?|url=|journal=The Journal of Caribbean History|volume=45|pages=165|via=}}</ref>\n\nCaymanian folklore explains that the island's first inhabitants were a Welshman named Walters (or Watler) and his companion named Bawden (or Bodden), who first arrived in Cayman in 1658 after serving in [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army in [[Jamaica]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nationaltrust.org.ky/index.php/info-sheets/watler-cemetary |title = Watler Cemetery|author = National Trust for the Cayman Islands |date = 29 Nov 2011 |work = National Trust for the Cayman Islands |accessdate = 24 May 2012}}\n</ref> The first recorded permanent inhabitant of the Cayman Islands, Isaac Bodden, was born on [[Grand Cayman]] around 1700.

Caymanians enticed passing ships by creating objects that piqued sailors' interests. Often these objects did not look like other vessels. Caymanians made mules or donkeys with lanterns tied to their bodies to walk along the beaches or lit a large bonfire to attract sailors. Having very little knowledge of the area, sailors often became stuck on the reefs in the process of reaching a distance to where they could communicate with those on the island. Once the ships were stuck on the reefs, islanders took canoes to plunder and salvage the ships under the false pretense of providing assistance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cayman Islands in Transition: The Politics, History, and Sociology of a Changing Society|last=Bodden|first=J.

These first settlements were abandoned after attacks by Spanish privateers, but English privateers often used the Cayman Islands as a base and in the 18th century they became an increasingly popular hideout for pirates, even after the end of legitimate privateering in 1713. Following several unsuccessful attempts, permanent settlement of the islands began in the 1730s. The Cayman Islands historically have been popular as a [[tax haven]]. In the early morning hours of February 8, 1794, ten vessels which were part of a convoy escorted by HMS Convert, were wrecked on the reef in Gun Bay, on the East end of Grand Cayman. Despite the darkness and pounding surf on the reef, local settlers braved the conditions attempting to rescue the passengers and crew of the fledgling fleet. There are conflicting reports, but it is believed that between six, and eight lives were lost that night, among them, the Captain of the Britannia. However, the overwhelming majority, more than 450 people, were successfully rescued. The incident is now remembered as The [[Wreck of the Ten Sail]]. Legend has it that among the fleet, there was a member of the [[British Royal Family]] on board. Most believe it to be a nephew of King George III. To reward the bravery of the island's local inhabitants, King George III reportedly issued a decreed that Caymanians should never be conscripted for war service, and shall never be subject to taxation. However, no official documentation of this decree has been found. All evidence for this being the origin of their tax-free status is purely anecdotal. Regardless, the Cayman Islands' status as a tax-free [[British overseas territory]] remains to this day.\n\nFrom 1670, the Cayman Islands were effective dependencies of Jamaica, although there was considerable self-government. In 1831, a [[Legislative Assembly|legislative assembly]] was established by local consent at a meeting of principal inhabitants held at [[Pedro St. James Castle]] on December 5 of that year. Elections were held on December 10 and the fledgling legislature passed its first [[Special legislation|local legislation]] on December 31, 1831. Subsequently, the Jamaican governor ratified a legislature consisting of eight magistrates appointed by the Governor of Jamaica and 10 (later increased to 27) elected representatives.\n\nThe collapse of the Federation of the West Indies created a period of decolonization in the English-speaking Caribbean.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Caribbean History Reader|last=Foote|first=Nicola|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=313}}</ref> In regards to independence, of the six dependent territories, the Cayman Islands were the most opposed because it lacked the natural resources needed. This opposition came from the fear that independence might prevent any special United States visas that aided Caymanian sailors working on American ships and elsewhere in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Islands at the Crossroads: Politics in the Non-Independent Caribbean|last=Ramos Aaron Gamaliel|first=Rivera Angel Israel|publisher=Ian Randle Publishers|year=2001|isbn=|location=Kingston|pages=120}}</ref> The people had concerns about their economic viability if the country was to become independent. The Cayman Islands were not the only smaller British territory that was reluctant in regards to gaining independence. The United Kingdom authorities established a new governing constitution framework for the reluctant territories. In place of the Federation of the West Indies, a constitution was created that allowed for the continuation of formal ties with London. In the Cayman Islands, the Governor's only obligation to the British Crown is that of keeping the Executive Council informed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Caribbean History Reader|last=Foote|first=Nicola|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=309, 313, 314}}</ref>\n\n==Slavery==\n\nGrand Cayman was the only island of the three that create the Cayman Islands that had instituted slavery. Although slavery was instituted, Grand Cayman did not hold witness to violent slave revolts. While scholars tend to agree that to an extent a slave society did exist on at least Grand Cayman, there are debates amongst them on how important slavery was to the society as a whole.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Christopher A.|date=Winter 2013|title=Premature Abolition, Ethnocentrism, and Bold Blackness: Race Relations in the Cayman Islands|url=|journal=The Historian|volume=75|pages=785, 786|via=}}</ref> The slave period for the Cayman Islands lasted between 1734 and 1834. In 1774, George Gauld estimated that approximately four hundred people lived on Grand Cayman; half the inhabitants were free while the other half were constituted slaves. By 1802, the estimation of inhabitants was at 933 with a 545 slaves. An April 1834 census recorded a population of 1,800 with roughly 46 percent considered free Caymanians. By the time of emancipation, slaves outnumbered that of freemen on Grand Cayman.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Christopher|date=2011|title=Did Slavery Really Matter in the Cayman Islands?|url=|journal=The Journal of Caribbean History|volume=45|pages=160\u2013162|via=}}</ref> In 1835, Governor Sligo arrived in Cayman from Jamaica to declare all slaves free in accordance with the Emancipation Act of 1833.\n\nCaymanian settlers resented their administrative association with Jamaica causing them to seize every opportunity to undermine the authorities. This problematic relationship reached its peak during the period leading up to emancipation. Caymanian slaveholders who did not appreciate being deprived of their chattel refused to cooperate with the Slave Registration Act 1817. In response to the Abolition Act 1807, the Slave Registration 1817, and the Emancipation Act of 1834 slaveowners organized resistance efforts against the authorities in Jamaica.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cayman Islands in Transition: The Politics, History, and Sociology of a Changing Society|last=Bodden|first=J. A. Roy|publisher=Ian Randle Publishers|year=2007|isbn=|location=Kingston|pages=8}}</ref>\n\nLocal residents of the Cayman Islands resisted the stationing of troops of the West India Regiments. This animosity stemmed from the fact that the West India Regiment enlisted black men, which the white establishment was upset by. The resisters were insulted at the idea of black soldiers defending their settlements.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cayman Islands in Transition: The Politics, History, and Sociology of a Changing Society|last=Bodden|first=J. A. Roy|publisher=Ian Randle Publishers|year=2007|isbn=|location=Kingston|pages=12}}</ref>\n\n==Dependency of Jamaica==\nThe Cayman Islands were officially declared and administered as a dependency of Jamaica from 1863 but were rather like a [[parish]] of Jamaica with the nominated [[Justice of the Peace|justices of the peace]] and elected vestrymen in their Legislature. From 1750 to 1898 the Chief Magistrate was the administrating official for the dependency, appointed by the Jamaican governor. In 1898 the Governor of Jamaica began appointing a Commissioner for the Islands. The first Commissioner was Frederick Sanguinetti. In 1959, upon the formation of the [[Federation of the West Indies]] the dependency status with regards to Jamaica ceased officially although the Governor of Jamaica remained the Governor of the Cayman Islands and had [[reserve power]]s over the Islands. Starting in 1959 the chief official overseeing the day-to-day affairs of the islands (for the Governor) was the Administrator. Upon Jamaica's independence in 1962, the Cayman Islands broke its administrative links with Jamaica and opted to become a direct dependency of the [[British monarchy|British Crown]], with the chief official of the islands being the Administrator.\n\nIn 1953 the first airfield in the Cayman Islands was opened as well as the George Town [[Public hospital]]. Barclays ushered in the age of formalised commerce by opening the first commercial bank.\n\n==Governmental changes==\nFollowing a two-year campaign by women to change their circumstances, in 1959 Cayman received its first written constitution which, for the first time, allowed women to vote. Cayman ceased to be a dependency of Jamaica.\n\nDuring 1966, legislation was passed to enable and encourage the banking industry in Cayman.\n\nIn 1971 the governmental structure of the Islands was again changed with a Governor now running the Cayman Islands. Athel Long CMG, CBE was the last Administrator and the first [[Governor of the Cayman Islands]].\n\nIn 1991 a review of the 1972 constitution recommended several constitutional changes to be debated by the Legislative Assembly. The post of [[Chief Secretary (British Empire)|Chief Secretary]] was reinstated in 1992 after having been abolished in 1986. The establishment of the post of [[Chief Minister]] was also proposed. However, in November 1992 elections were held for an enlarged Legislative Assembly and the Government was soundly defeated, casting doubt on constitutional reform.  The \"National Team\" of government critics won 12 (later reduced to 11) of the 15 seats, and independents won the other three, after a campaign opposing the appointment of \nChief Minister and advocating spending cuts. The unofficial leader of the team, Thomas Jefferson, had been the appointed [[Financial secretary|Financial Secretary]] until March 1992, when he resigned over [[Public finance|public spending]] disputes to fight the election. After the elections, Mr. Jefferson was appointed Minister and [[Premier of the Cayman Islands|leader of government business]]; he also held the portfolios of Tourism, Aviation and Commerce in the Executive Council. Three teams with a total of 44 candidates contested the [[general election]] held on November 20, 1996: the governing National Team, Team Cayman and the Democratic Alliance Group. The National Team were returned to office but with a reduced majority, winning 9 seats. The Democratic Alliance won 2 seats in George Town, Team Cayman won one in Bodden Town and independents won seats in George Town, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman.\n\nAlthough all administrative links with Jamaica were broken in 1962, the Cayman Islands and Jamaica continue to share many links including a common [[united church]] (the [[United Church in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands]]) and [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] [[diocese]] (although there is debate about this).  They also shared a [[Jamaican dollar|common currency]] until 1972. In 1999, 38\u201340% of the expat population of the Cayman Islands was of Jamaican origin and in 2004/2005 little over 50% of the [[expatriates]] [[work permit|working]] in the Cayman Islands (i.e. 8,000) were Jamaicans (with the next largest expatriate communities coming from the United States, United Kingdom and Canada).\n\n==Hurricane Ivan==\n[[File:Cayman - Ivan damage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hurricane Ivan|Ivan]] damage in the [[Cayman Islands]]]]\n{{See also|:Category:Natural disasters in the Cayman Islands|l1=Natural disasters in the Cayman Islands}}\n\nIn September 2004, The Cayman Islands were hit by [[Hurricane Ivan]], causing mass devastation, loss of human and [[Fauna|animal life]] (both wild and domestic/livestock) and flooding, with some accounts reporting that the majority of Grand Cayman had been underwater and with the lower floors of buildings being completely flooded in excess of 8&nbsp;ft. An Ivan Flood Map is available from the Lands & Survey Dept. of The Cayman Islands indicating afflicted areas and their corresponding flood levels.<ref>http://www.caymanlandinfo.ky/Portals/0/ls_images/maps/IvanFlood.jpg</ref> This [[natural disaster]] also led to the bankruptcy of a heavily invested [[Insurance|insurance company]] called Doyle. The company had re-leased estimates covering 20% damage to be re-insured at minimal fees when in fact the damage was over 65% and every claim was in the millions. The company simply could not keep paying out and the adjusters could not help lower the payments due to the high [[building code]] the Islands adhere to.\n\nMuch suspense was built around the devastation that Hurricane Ivan had caused as the leader of Government business Mr. [[McKeeva Bush|Mckeeva Bush]] decided to close the Islands to any and all reporters, aid and denied permissions to land any aircraft except for Cayman Airways. The line of people wishing to leave but unable to do so because of his actions extended from the airport to the post office each day as thousands stranded with no shelter, food, or fresh water hoped for a chance to evacuate. As a result, most evacuations and the mass exodus which ensued in the aftermath was done so by private charter through personal & Corporate expense, with or without official permission. It was also a collective decision within the government at that time to turn away two [[Royal Navy surface fleet|British warships]] that had arrived the day after the storm with supplies. This decision was met by outrage from the Islanders who thought that it should have been their decision to make. Power and water was cut off due to damaged pipes and destroyed utility poles, with all utilities restored to various areas over the course of the next three months. [[Fortis Inc.]], a Canadian-owned utility company, sent a team down to Grand Cayman to assist the local power company, [[Caribbean Utilities|CUC]], with restoration. The official report, extent of damage, duration and recovery efforts in the words of Mr. Bush himself are first recorded a month following to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs Written Evidence, Letter from the Cayman Islands Government Office in the United Kingdom, 8 October 2004.<ref>https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmfaff/115/115we08.htm</ref>\n\n\"Hurricane Ivan weakened to a category four hurricane as it moved over Grand Cayman. It is the most powerful hurricane ever to hit the cayman islands. The eye of the storm passed within eight to 15 miles of Grand Cayman. It struck on Sunday 12 September, bringing with it sustained winds of 155 miles per hour, gusts of up to 217 mph, and a storm surge of sea water of eight to 10 feet, which covered most of the Island. A quarter of Grand Cayman remained submerged by flood waters two days later. Both Cayman Brac and Little Cayman suffered damage, although not to the same extent as Grand Cayman.\n\nDamage on Grand Cayman has been extensive. I include with this letter, for your reference, a detailed briefing about the damage and the recovery effort, and some photographs[5]of the devastation. 95% of our housing stock has sustained damage, with around 25% destroyed or damaged beyond repair. We currently have 6,000 homes that are uninhabitable-these are homes that house teachers, nurses, manual and other workers. Thankfully, loss of life in Cayman has been limited, relative to the impact of the storm.\"- Honourable McKeeva Bush, OBE, JP.<ref>https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmfaff/115/115we08.htm</ref>\n\nWhile there still remains visible signs of damage, in the vegetation and destruction to buildings particularly along the southern and eastern coastal regions, the Island took considerable time to become suitable as a bustling financial & tourism destination again. There remain housing issues for many of the residents as of late 2005, with some buildings still lying derelict due to insurance claims as of 2013, feasibility, new regulations and building codes. Many residents simply were unable to rebuild, and abandoned the damaged structures.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscatinline}}\n\n{{History of North America}}\n\n[[Category:History of the Cayman Islands| ]]", "sha1": "2to418hjx2rgugfp3zee9q9nky33avg"}}, {"title": "Geography of the Cayman Islands", "ns": "0", "id": "5470", "revision": {"id": "846741965", "parentid": "837940859", "timestamp": "2018-06-20T16:24:55Z", "contributor": {"username": "KolbertBot", "id": "31691822"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Bot: [[User:KolbertBot|HTTP\u2192HTTPS]] (v485)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{Country geography |\nname =the Cayman Islands |\nmap =Cayman Islands Map.svg |\ncontinent =&mdash; |\nregion =[[Central America]]<br />[[Caribbean Sea]]|\ncoordinates =19\u00b030'N, 80\u00b030'W |\narea ranking =205th |\nkm area =264 |\nmiles area =101.2 |\npercent land= 100 |\npercent water =0 |\nkm coastline =160  |\nmiles coastline =99.42  |\nborders =[[Land borders|Total land borders]]:<br />0&nbsp;km (0&nbsp;miles)|\nhighest point= [[The Bluff (Cayman Islands)|The Bluff]]<br />43&nbsp;m (141.08&nbsp;ft)|\nlowest point= [[Caribbean Sea]]<br />0&nbsp;m (0&nbsp;ft)|\nlongest river=&mdash;|\nlargest lake=&mdash;|\n}}\nThe '''[[Cayman Islands]]''' are a [[British overseas territories|British dependency]] and [[island country]].

The largest numbers of expatriates living in the Cayman Islands (as of the government's 1999 Census Report) hail from Jamaica (8,320), the [[United Kingdom]] (2,392), the United States (2,040), [[Canada]] (1,562), and [[Honduras]] (873). Approximately 3,300 more residents are citizens of various other countries. While the government doesn't restrict foreign land ownership, it does strongly enforce its immigration laws. Businesses are required to grant access to job openings to Caymanian citizens first; if none of them are suitable, the business may then seek employees from other countries. In order to work in the Cayman Islands, foreigners must have a job offer before immigrating.\n\nThe estimated population of {{UN_Population|Year}} is {{UN_Population|Cayman Islands}} ({{UN_Population|source}}).\n===District populations===\nThe vast majority of its residents live on the island of [[Grand Cayman]].

This infuriated the elected members of the Legislative Assembly as they maintained that the Governor and the United Kingdom had put into question the Cayman Islands' reputation as a tightly regulated offshore jurisdiction.

The harvesting of [[sea turtle]]s to resupply passing sailing ships was the first major economic activity on the islands, but local stocks were depleted by the 1790s. [[Agriculture]], while sufficient to support the small early settler population, has always been limited by the scarcity of arable land. [[Fishing]], [[shipbuilding]], and [[cotton]] production boosted the [[economy]] during the early days of settlement.  In addition, settlers scavenged shipwreck remains from the surrounding coral reefs.\n\nThe boom in the Cayman Islands' international finance industry can also be at least partly attributed to the [[British overseas territory]] having no [[direct taxation]].  A popular legend attributes the tax-free status to the heroic acts of the inhabitants during a maritime tragedy in 1794, often referred to as \"Wreck of the Ten Sails\".<ref>[http://www.caymanchamber.ky/visitor/poi.htm#wreck Points of Interest: The Wreck of the Ten Sails].

However, the [[Government of the Cayman Islands]] have [[autonomy]] and often resolves important issues with foreign governments alone, without intervention from Britain. Although in its early days, the Cayman Islands' most important relationships were with Britain and [[Jamaica]], in recent years, this has shifted, and they now rely more so on the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].\n\nThough the Cayman Islands are involved in no major international disputes, they have come under some criticism due to the use of their territory for [[narcotics trafficking]] and [[money laundering]]. In an attempt to address this, the Government entered into the Narcotics Agreement of 1984 and the [[Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty]] of 1986 with the United States, in order to reduce the use of their facilities associated with these activities. In more recent years, they have stepped up the fight against money laundering, by limiting banking secrecy, introducing requirements for customer identification and record keeping, and requiring banks to cooperate with foreign investigators.\n\nDue to their status as an overseas territory of the UK, the Cayman Islands have no representation either on the [[United Nations]], or in most other international organizations. However, the Cayman Islands still participates in some international organisations, being a full member of the [[Central Development Bank]] and [[International Olympic Committee]], an associate member of [[Caricom]] and [[UNESCO]], and a member of a subbureau of [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]].\n\n==Bilateral relations==\n===India===\n{{main|Cayman Islands\u2013India relations}}\n\n===United States===\n{{main|Cayman Islands\u2013United States relations}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Foreign relations of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[British Overseas Territories]]\n\n{{Foreign relations in the Caribbean}}\n{{Americas topic|Foreign relations of|title=Foreign relations in the Americas}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Foreign Relations of the Cayman Islands}}\n[[Category:Government of the Cayman Islands]]\n[[Category:Foreign relations of the Caribbean]]", "sha1": "3slw394k2jzyp8vf8b306ik06je697j"}}, {"title": "Central African Republic", "ns": "0", "id": "5478", "revision": {"id": "865599270", "parentid": "865597354", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T22:51:28Z", "contributor": {"ip": "41.223.184.148"}, "comment": "Test", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|CAR|the region in the Philippines|Cordillera  Administrative Region|other uses|Car (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2015}}\n{{Coord|7|N|21|E|display=title}}\n{{Infobox country\n| conventional_long_name = Central African Republic\n| common_name = the Central African Republic\n| native_name = {{vunblist |{{native name|sg|K\u00f6d\u00f6r\u00f6s\u00ease t\u00ee B\u00eaafr\u00eeka}}|{{native name|fr|R\u00e9publique centrafricaine}}}}\n| image_flag = Flag of the Central African Republic.svg\n| image_coat = Coat of arms of the Central African Republic.svg\n| national_motto = {{native phrase|fr|\"Unit\u00e9, Dignit\u00e9, Travail\"|italics=off}}<br />{{small|\"Unity, Dignity, Work\"}}\n| national_anthem = {{native phrase|sg|[[La Renaissance|E Zingo]]|nolink=no}}<br />{{native phrase|fr|La Renaissance|nolink=yes}}<br />{{small|\"The Renaissance\"}}<br /><center>[[File:La Renaissance.ogg|La Renaissance]]</center>\n| image_map = Location Central African Republic AU Africa.svg\n| map_caption = {{map caption |countryprefix= |location_color=dark blue |region=Africa |region_color=dark grey |subregion=the [[African Union]] |subregion_color=light blue}}\n| image_map2 = Central African Republic - Location Map (2013) - CAF - UNOCHA.svg\n| capital = [[Bangui]]\n| coordinates = {{Coord|4|22|N|18|35|E|type:city}}\n| largest_city = capital\n| official_languages = [[French language|French]]<br>[[Sango language|Sango]]\n| ethnic_groups = {{vunblist\n  | [[Gbaya people|Baya]]\n  |  [[Banda people|Banda]]\n  |  [[Mandja people|Mandjia]]\n  |  [[Sara people|Sara]]\n  |  [[Fula people|Fulani]]\n  |  Mboum\n  |  [[M'Baka people|M'Baka]]\n  |  [[Yakoma people|Yakoma]]\n  |   others\n }}\n| religion = Predominantly [[Christianity]]\n| demonym = [[Demographics of the Central African Republic|Central African]]\n| government_type = [[Unitary state|Unitary]] [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[Republic|constitutional republic]]\n| leader_title1 = [[List of heads of state of the Central African Republic and Central African Empire|President]]\n| leader_name1 = [[Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra]]\n| leader_title2 = [[List of heads of government of the Central African Republic and Central African Empire|Prime Minister]]\n| leader_name2 = [[Simplice Sarandji]]\n| legislature = [[National Assembly (Central African Republic)|National Assembly]]\n| sovereignty_type = [[Independence]]\n| established_event1 = from [[France]]\n| established_date1 = 13 August 1960\n| established_event2 = [[Central African Empire]] established\n| established_date2 = 4 December 1976\n| established_event3 = Republic restored\n| established_date3 = 21 September 1979\n| area_km2 = 622,984\n| area_rank = 44th <!-- Area rank should match [[List of countries and dependencies by area]] -->\n| area_sq_mi = 240,534 <!--Do not remove per [[WP:MOSNUM]]-->\n| percent_water = 12\n| population_estimate = {{UN_Population|Central African Republic}}{{UN_Population|ref}}\n| population_census = 4,987,640<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrymeters.info/en/Central_African_Republic|title=Live Central African Republic population (2017).

Pressure from the United States, France, and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called GIBAFOR (France, the USA, Germany, Japan, the EU, the [[World Bank]], and the UN) finally led Kolingba to agree, in principle, to hold free elections in October 1992 with help from the UN Office of Electoral Affairs. After using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power, President Kolingba came under intense pressure from GIBAFOR to establish a \"Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la R\u00e9publique\" (Provisional National Political Council, CNPPR) and to set up a \"Mixed Electoral Commission\", which included representatives from all political parties.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen a second round of elections were finally held in 1993, again with the help of the international community coordinated by GIBAFOR,  Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9 won in the second round of voting with 53% of the vote while Goumba won 45.6%. Patass\u00e9's party, the ''Mouvement pour la Lib\u00e9ration du Peuple Centrafricain'' (MLPC) or Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People, gained a simple but not an absolute majority of seats in parliament, which meant Patass\u00e9's party required coalition partners.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Patass\u00e9 Government (1993\u20132003) ====\n{{one source|section|date=January 2015}}\nPatass\u00e9 purged many of the Kolingba elements from the government and Kolingba supporters accused Patass\u00e9's government of conducting a \"witch hunt\" against the Yakoma. A new constitution was approved on 28 December 1994 but had little impact on the country's politics. In 1996\u20131997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government's erratic behaviour, three mutinies against Patass\u00e9's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. During this time (1996) the Peace Corps evacuated all its volunteers to neighboring Cameroon.  To date, the Peace Corps has not returned to the Central African Republic.  The [[Bangui Agreements]], signed in January 1997, provided for the deployment of an inter-African military mission, to Central African Republic and re-entry of ex-mutineers into the government on 7 April 1997. The inter-African military mission was later replaced by a U.N. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1159|peacekeeping force (MINURCA)]].

The earliest period of settlement began around 10,000 years ago when nomadic people first began to settle, farm and fish in the region. The next period began around 1,000 to 3,000 years ago when several non-indigenous groups began to migrate into the region from other parts of the continent. The third period involved the colonial conquest and rule of the country by France and Germany which spanned from the late 1800s until 1960 when the Central African Republic became an independent state. The final period has been the era during which the Central African Republic has been an independent state.\n\n== Early history ==\nApproximately 10,000 years ago, [[desertification]] forced hunter-gatherer societies south into the Sahel regions of northern Central Africa, where some groups settled and began farming as part of the [[Neolithic Revolution]].<ref name=\"Eastern Africa 2011, pg. 4\">The History of Central and Eastern Africa, Amy McKenna, 2011, pg. 4</ref> Initial farming of [[Dioscorea rotundata|white yam]] progressed into [[millet]] and [[sorghum]], and then later the domestication of [[Elaeis guineensis|African oil palm]] improved the groups' nutrition and allowed for expansion of the local populations.<ref>The History of Central and Eastern Africa, Amy McKenna, 2011, pg. 5</ref> Bananas arrived in the region and added an important source of carbohydrates to the diet; they were also used in the production of alcohol.{{when|date=June 2014}} This Agricultural Revolution, combined with a \"Fish-stew Revolution\", in which fishing began to take place, and the use of boats, allowed for the transportation of goods.

Europeans, primarily the French, German, and [[Belgium|Belgians]], arrived in the area in 1885. The French consolidated their legal claim to the area through an 1887 convention with [[Congo Free State]], which granted France possession of the right bank of the [[Oubangui River]]. Two years later, the French established an outpost at [[Bangui]], and in 1894, [[Oubangui-Chari]] became a French territory. However, the French did not consolidate their control over the area until 1903, after having defeated the forces of Rabih in the [[battle of Kouss\u00e9ri]], and established colonial administration throughout the territory. In 1906, the Oubangui-Chari territory was united with the [[Chad]] colony; in 1910, it became one of the four territories of the [[Federation of French Equatorial Africa]] (AEF), along with Chad, [[Republic of the Congo|Middle Congo]], and [[Gabon]]. The next thirty years were marked by mostly small scale revolts against French rule and the development of a [[plantation]]-style economy. The largest of these revolts was the [[Kongo-Wara rebellion]], when over 350,000 natives rebelled against the colonial administration.\n\nThe European penetration of Central African territory began in the late 19th century during the [[Scramble for Africa]].<ref>[http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Centr_Afr_Rep.shtml French Colonies \u2013 Central African Republic]. Discoverfrance.net. Retrieved on 6 April 2013.</ref> Count [[Savorgnan de Brazza]] established the [[French Congo]] and sent expeditions up the Ubangi River from [[Brazzaville]] in an effort to expand France's claims to territory in Central Africa. [[Belgium]], [[German Empire|Germany]], and the [[United Kingdom]] also competed to establish their claims to territory in the region.\n\nIn 1889, the French established a post on the Ubangi River at Bangui. In 1890\u201391, de Brazza sent expeditions up the [[Sangha River]], in what is now south-western CAR, up the center of the Ubangi basin toward [[Lake Chad]], and eastward along the Ubangi River toward the [[Nile]], with the intention of expanding the borders of the French Congo to link up the other French territories in Africa. In 1894, the French Congo's borders with [[Leopold II of Belgium]]'s [[Congo Free State]] and [[German Cameroon]] were fixed by diplomatic agreements. In 1899, the French Congo's border with Sudan was fixed along the [[Congo-Nile divide]]. This situation left France without her much coveted outlet on the Nile.\n\nOnce European negotiators had agreed upon the borders of the French Congo, France had to decide how to pay for the costly occupation, administration, and development of the territory it had acquired. The reported financial successes of Leopold II's concessionary companies in the Congo Free State convinced the French government to grant 17 private companies large concessions in the Ubangi-Shari region in 1899. In return for the right to exploit these lands by buying local products and selling European goods, the companies promised to pay rent to France and to promote the development of their concessions. The companies employed European and African agents who frequently used brutal methods to force the natives to labor.\n\nAt the same time, the French colonial administration began to force the local population to pay [[tax]]es and to provide the state with free labor. The companies and the French administration at times collaborated in forcing the Central Africans to work for them. Some French officials{{who|date=January 2014}} reported abuses committed by private company militias, and their own colonial colleagues and troops, but efforts to hold these people accountable almost invariably failed. When any news of atrocities committed against Central Africans reached France and caused an outcry, investigations were undertaken and some feeble attempts at reform were made{{by whom|date=January 2014}}, but the [[facts on the ground|situation on the ground]] in Ubangi-Shari remained virtually unchanged.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nDuring the first decade of French colonial rule, from about 1900 to 1910, the rulers of the Ubangi-Shari region increased both their slave-raiding activities and the selling of local produce to Europe. They took advantage of their treaties with the French to procure more [[Firearm|weapons]], which were used to capture more slaves: much of the eastern half of Ubangi-Shari was depopulated as a result of slave-trading by local rulers during the first decade of colonial rule. After the power of local African rulers was destroyed by the French, slave raiding greatly diminished.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nIn 1911, the Sangha and Lobaye basins were ceded to Germany as part of an agreement which gave France a free hand in [[Morocco]]. Western Ubangi-Shari remained under German rule until World War I, after which France again annexed the territory using Central African troops.\n\n[[File:De Gaulle Bangui 1940.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Charles de Gaulle]] in Bangui, 1940]]\nFrom 1920 to 1930, a network of roads was built, [[cash crop]]s were promoted and mobile health services were formed to combat [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]]. [[Protestant]] [[Mission (Christianity)|missions]] were established in different parts of the country. New forms of forced labor were also introduced, however, as the French conscripted large numbers of Ubangians to work on the [[Congo-Ocean Railway]]; many of these recruits died of exhaustion and illness as a result of the poor conditions.\n\nIn 1925, the French writer [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] published ''[[Voyage au Congo]]'', in which he described the alarming consequences of conscription for the Congo-Ocean railroad. He exposed the continuing atrocities committed against Central Africans in Western Ubangi-Shari by such employers as the Forestry Company of Sangha-Ubangi. In 1928, a major insurrection, the [[Kongo-Wara rebellion]] or 'war of the hoe handle', broke out in Western Ubangi-Shari and continued for several years. The extent of this insurrection, which was perhaps the largest anti-colonial rebellion in Africa during the interwar years, was carefully hidden from the French public because it provided evidence of strong opposition to French colonial rule and forced labor.\n\nDuring the 1930s, [[cotton]], [[tea]], and [[coffee]] emerged as important cash crops in Ubangi-Shari and the mining of [[diamond]]s and [[gold]] began in earnest. Several cotton companies were granted purchasing [[Monopoly|monopolies]] over large areas of cotton production and were able to fix the prices paid to cultivators, which assured profits for their shareholders. In September 1940, during the [[Second World War]], [[Charles de Gaulle|pro-Gaullist]] French officers took control of Ubangi-Shari.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/102152/Central-African-Republic/40700/The-colonial-era Central African Republic: The colonial era \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia].

After World War II, the [[French Constitution]] of 1946 inaugurated the first of a series of reforms that led eventually to complete independence for all French territories in western and equatorial Africa. In 1946, all AEF inhabitants were granted French citizenship and allowed to establish local assemblies. The assembly in CAR was led by [[Barth\u00e9lemy Boganda]], a Catholic priest who also was known for his forthright statements in the French Assembly on the need for African emancipation. In 1956 French legislation eliminated certain voting inequalities and provided for the creation of some organs of self-government in each territory.\n\nThe French constitutional referendum of September 1958 dissolved the AEF, and on 1 December of the same year the Assembly declared the birth of the autonomous Central African Republic with Boganda as head of government. Boganda ruled until his death in a plane crash on 29 March 1959. His cousin, [[David Dacko]], replaced him as head of Government. On 12 July 1960 France agreed to the Central African Republic becoming fully independent.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00D1FFA3D581A7A93C1A8178CD85F448685F9 | work=The New York Times | first=W.

Bokassa abolished the constitution of 1959, dissolved the National Assembly, and issued a decree that placed all legislative and executive powers in the hands of the president. On 4 December 1976, the republic became a monarchy \u2013&nbsp;the [[Central African Empire]]&nbsp;\u2013 with the promulgation of the imperial constitution and the proclamation of the president as [[Emperor Bokassa I]]. His regime was characterized by numerous human rights atrocities.\n\n=== Dacko ===\n[[File:David Dacko 1962 crop.jpg|thumb|130px|First [[President of the Central African Republic|Central African President]] David Dacko in 1962]]\nOn 20 September 1979, Dacko, with French support, led a bloodless coup that [[1979 Central African Republic coup d'\u00e9tat|overthrew Bokassa]] while he was out of the country. The republic was restored, and Bokassa, who took refuge in [[Ivory Coast]] and France, was sentenced to death in absentia for various crimes, including [[cannibalism]]. Moreover, an African judicial commission reported that he had \"almost certainly\" taken part in the massacre of some 100 children for refusing to wear the compulsory school uniforms. In January 1981, six of his supporters, including two sons-in-law, were executed. Bokassa returned unexpectedly in October 1986 and on 12 June 1987, he was convicted of having ordered the murders of at least 20 prisoners and the arrest of the schoolchildren who were murdered. He was sentenced to death, but this was commuted to a life term in February 1988. He was released from prison on 1 September 1993, as a result of an amnesty and died of a heart attack in [[Bangui]] on 3 November 1996 at age 75.\n\n=== Kolingba ===\nDacko's efforts to promote economic and political reforms proved ineffectual, and on 20 September 1981, he in turn was overthrown in a bloodless coup by General [[Andr\u00e9 Kolingba]]. For four years, Kolingba led the country as head of the Military Committee for National Recovery (CRMN).\n\n\nKolingba suspended the constitution and ruled with a military junta until 1985. In 1985, the CRMN was dissolved, and Kolingba named a new cabinet with increased civilian participation, signaling the start of a return to civilian rule. The process of democratization quickened in 1986 with the creation of a new political party, the Rassemblement D\u00e9mocratique Centrafricain (RDC), and the drafting of a new constitution that subsequently was ratified in a national referendum. General Kolingba was sworn in as constitutional President on 29 November 1986. The constitution established a National Assembly made up of 52 elected deputies, elected in July 1987 and municipal elections were held in 1988. Kolingba's two major political opponents, Abel Goumba and [[Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9]], boycotted these elections because their parties were not allowed to participate.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nBy 1990, inspired by the fall of the Berlin Wall, a pro-democracy movement became very active. In May 1990, a letter signed by 253 prominent citizens asked for the convocation of a National Conference, but Kolingba refused this request and instead detained several opponents. Pressure from the United States, France, and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called GIBAFOR (France, the USA, Germany, Japan, the EU, the World Bank, and the UN) finally led Kolingba to agree, in principle, to hold free elections in October 1992 with help from the UN Office of Electoral Affairs.\n\nAfter using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power, President Kolingba came under intense pressure from GIBAFOR to establish a \"Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la R\u00e9publique\" (Provisional National Political Council, CNPPR) and to set up a \"Mixed Electoral Commission\", which included representatives from all political parties.\n\n=== Patass\u00e9 ===\nWhen elections were finally held in 1993, again with the help of the international community, [[Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9]] led in the first round and Kolingba came in fourth behind Abel Goumba and David Dacko. In the second round, Patass\u00e9 won 53% of the vote while Goumba won 45.6%. Most of Patass\u00e9's support came from Gbaya, Kare, and Kaba voters in seven heavily populated prefectures in the northwest while Goumba's support came largely from ten less-populated prefectures in the south and east. Furthermore, Patass\u00e9's party, the ''Mouvement pour la Lib\u00e9ration du Peuple Centrafricain'' (MLPC) or Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People, gained a simple but not an absolute majority of seats in parliament, which meant Patass\u00e9's party required coalition partners.\n\nPatass\u00e9 relieved former President Kolingba of his military rank of general in March 1994 and then charged several former ministers with various crimes. Patass\u00e9 also removed many [[Yakoma people|Yakoma]] from important, lucrative posts in the government. Two hundred predominantly Yakoma members of the presidential guard were also dismissed or reassigned to the army. Kolingba's RDC loudly proclaimed that Patass\u00e9's government was conducting a \"witch hunt\" against the Yakoma.\n\n\nA new constitution was approved on 28 December 1994 and promulgated on 14 January 1995, but this constitution, like those before it, did not have much impact on the country's politics. In 1996\u20131997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government's erratic behaviour, three mutinies against Patass\u00e9's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. On 25 January 1997, the [[Bangui Agreements]], which provided for the deployment of an inter-African military mission, the ''Mission Interafricaine de Surveillance des Accords de Bangui'' (MISAB), were signed. Mali's former president, [[Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9|Amadou Tour\u00e9]], served as chief mediator and brokered the entry of ex-mutineers into the government on 7 April 1997. The MISAB mission was later replaced by a U.N. peacekeeping force, the ''Mission des Nations Unies en RCA'' ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1159|MINURCA]]).\n\nIn 1998, parliamentary elections resulted in Kolingba's RDC winning 20 out of 109 seats, constituting a comeback. However, in 1999, in spite of widespread public anger in urban centers over his corrupt rule, Patass\u00e9 won free elections to become president for a second term.\n\n== Current period ==\nOn 28 May 2001, rebels stormed strategic buildings in Bangui in an unsuccessful coup attempt. The army chief of staff, Abel Abrou, and General Fran\u00e7ois N'Djadder Bedaya were killed, but Patass\u00e9 regained the upper hand by bringing in at least 300 troops of the rebel leader [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] (from across the river in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) and by Libyan soldiers.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n=== 2003\u20132007: Bush War ===\n{{main|Central African Republic Bush War}}\nIn the aftermath of the failed [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]], militias loyal to Patass\u00e9 sought revenge against rebels in many neighborhoods of the capital, Bangui, and incited unrest which resulted in the destruction of many homes as well as the torture and murder of many opponents. Eventually, Patass\u00e9 came to suspect that General [[Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9]] was involved in another coup attempt against him, which led Boziz\u00e9  to flee with loyal troops to Chad. In March 2003, Boziz\u00e9 launched a surprise attack against Patass\u00e9, who was out of the country. Libyan troops and some 1,000 soldiers of Bemba's Congolese rebel organization failed to stop the rebels, who took control of the country and thus succeeded in overthrowing Patass\u00e9. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n[[File:Rebel in northern Central African Republic 04.jpg|left|thumb|Rebel in northern Central African Republic]]\nOn 15 March 2003, while Patass\u00e9 was abroad, rebels moved into Bangui and installed their commander, General [[Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9]], as president. Boziz\u00e9 has since been elected President in an election considered by observers to be fair and free.\n\nPatass\u00e9 has been found guilty of major crimes in Bangui and CAR has brought a case to the International Criminal Court against him and Jean Pierre Bemba from the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo accusing them both of multiple crimes in suppressing one of the mutinies against Patasse. Civil tranquillity has yet to be established and parts of the country remain out of government control. The UN continues to maintain a peace building mission in Bangui.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, and his promise to step down at the end of the transition, Boziz\u00e9 contested the 13 March 2005 presidential elections in which all of the leading opposition candidates were allowed to run except for Patass\u00e9. Boziz\u00e9 won on the second run-off round on 8 May 2005, defeating [[Martin Zigu\u00e9l\u00e9]], who ran on the ticket of the MLPC, the former ruling party. The National Elections Commission declared Boziz\u00e9 the winner with 64.6 percent of the vote to 35.4 percent for Zigu\u00e9l\u00e9. The election was generally considered to be fair, although the absence of Patass\u00e9 cast a shadow over the legitimacy of the process.\n\nAfter Boziz\u00e9 seized power in 2003, the [[Central African Republic Bush War]] began with the rebellion by the [[Union of Democratic Forces for Unity]] (UFDR), led by [[Michel Djotodia]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Stephanie |last=Hancock |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/feature-bush-war-leaves-central-african-villages-deserted |title=Feature&nbsp;- Bush war leaves Central African villages deserted |publisher=[[ReliefWeb]] |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=30 August 2007 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref> This quickly escalated into major fighting during 2004.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4035239.stm |title=Raid on CAR town 'leaves 20 dead' |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=23 December 2004 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref> The UFDR rebel forces consisted of three allies, the ''Groupe d'action patriotique pour la liberation de Centrafrique'' (GAPLC), the [[Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace]] (CPJP), the [[People's Army for the Restoration of Democracy (CAR)|People's Army for the Restoration of Democracy]] (APRD), the [[Movement of Central African Liberators for Justice]] (MLCJ), and the ''Front d\u00e9mocratique Centrafricain'' (FDC).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200611020004.html |title=Central African Republic: Rebels Call for Dialogue After Capturing Key Town |publisher=[[AllAfrica.com]] |agency=[[IRIN]] |date=2 November 2006 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 May 2005, Boziz\u00e9 gained yet a further victory when his coalition, Convergence [[Kwa Na Kwa]], won 42 parliamentary seats in the legislative run-off vote. The MLPC came in second with 11 seats while the RDC won only eight seats. The remaining seats were won by independents or by smaller parties. In June later that year, the [[African Union]] (AU) lifted sanctions against the country, which had been applied after the 2003 coup.\n\nIn early 2006, Boziz\u00e9's government appeared stable. However, Patass\u00e9, who was living in exile in [[Togo]], could not be ruled out as a leader of a future uprising. His supporters reportedly were joining or were prepared to join rebel movements in belief that their leader was still the rightful head of state of the country. Further, members of Kolingba's [[Yakoma people|Yakoma]] tribe in the south posed a potential threat to Boziz\u00e9's government because of their widespread boycott of the second round of the legislative elections. Members of the Yakoma dominate the army.\n\nOn 13 April 2007, a peace agreement between the government and the UFDR was signed in Birao. The agreement provided for an amnesty for the UFDR, its recognition as a political party, and the integration of its fighters into the army.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200611130081.html |title=Central African Republic: Concern As Civilians Flee, Government Denies Rebel Capture of Third Town |publisher=[[AllAfrica.com]] |agency=[[IRIN]] |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-04-13-central-africa_N.htm |title=Central African Republic, rebels sign peace deal |work=[[USA Today]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=13 April 2007 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref> Further negotiations resulted in an agreement in 2008 for reconciliation, a unity government, and local elections in 2009 and parliamentary and presidential elections in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2009/01/20/2003434210 |title=CAR president dissolves government, vows unity |work=[[Taipei Times]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=20 January 2009 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref> The new unity government that resulted was formed in January 2009.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iDaBqt-PZaqJ6IPUfGowi9_x95Ag |title=Touadera names rebels in new Central African Republic govt |publisher=[[Google News]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=19 January 2009 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref>\n\n=== 2012\u20132014: Civil War ===\n{{main|Central African Republic Civil War (2012\u20132014)}}\n[[File:Central African Republic 2012 Battles-en.svg|thumb|300px|Conflict in the Central African Republic (2012\u20132014)]]\nIn late 2012, a coalition of old rebel groups under new name of [[S\u00e9l\u00e9ka CPSK-CPJP-UFDR|S\u00e9l\u00e9ka]] [[Central African Republic conflict (2012\u2013present)|renewed fighting]].

It is bordered by the countries of [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]]. Much of the country consists of flat, or rolling plateau savanna, about {{convert|1640|ft|m|0}} above sea level. In the northeast are the [[Fertit Hills]], and there are scattered hills in the southwestern part of the country. To the northwest are the [[Karre Mountains]] (also known as Yade Massif), a granite plateau with an altitude of {{convert|3750|ft|m|0}}.\n\nAt {{convert|622984|km2|sqmi|0}}, the Central African Republic is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|world's 45th-largest country]] (after [[Somalia]]). It is comparable in size to [[Ukraine]] or slightly smaller than the state of [[Texas]].\n\nMuch of the southern border is formed by tributaries of the [[Congo River]], with the [[Mbomou River]] in the east merging with the [[Uele River]] to form the [[Ubangi River]]. In the west, the [[Sangha River]] flows through part of the country. The eastern border lies along the edge of the [[Congo-Nile watershed]].\n\nEstimates of the amount of the country covered by forest ranges up to 8%, with the densest parts in the south. The forest is highly diverse, and includes commercially important species of Ayous, Sapelli and Sipo. The deforestation rate is 0.4% per annum, and lumber poaching is commonplace.\n\n== Climate ==\n\n{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}\nThe climate of the C.A.R. is generally [[tropical]]. The northern areas are subject to [[harmattan]] winds, which are hot, dry, and carry dust. The tip of the northern regions have been subject to [[desertification]]. The remainder of the country is prone to flooding from nearby rivers. About 1/3 of the Central African Republic\u2019s population do not have access to clean water.\n\n== Notes ==\n[[File:Central African Republic map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Central African Republic map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.]]\n[[File:Satellite map of the Central African Republic.png|thumb|450px|A satellite map of the Central African Republic.]]\n[[Image:Central African Republic Topography.png|thumb|450px|Topography of Central African Republic.]]\n\n'''Location:'''\nCentral [[Africa]], north of [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\n\n'''Area - comparative:'''\n*Canada: slightly smaller than [[Manitoba]]\n*US: slightly smaller than [[Texas]]\n\n'''Land boundaries:'''\n<br>''total:''\n5,920&nbsp;km\n<br>''border countries:''\n[[Cameroon]] 901&nbsp;km, [[Chad]] 1,556&nbsp;km, Democratic Republic of the Congo 1,747&nbsp;km, [[Republic of the Congo]] 487&nbsp;km, [[Sudan]] 174&nbsp;km and [[South Sudan]] 1,055&nbsp;km\n\n'''Coastline:'''\n0&nbsp;km (landlocked)\n\n'''Maritime claims:'''\nnone (landlocked)\n\n'''Terrain:'''\nvast, flat to rolling, monotonous plateau; scattered hills in northeast and southwest\n\n'''Elevation extremes:'''\n<br>''lowest point:''\n[[Oubangui River]] 335 m\n<br>''highest point:''\n[[Mont Ngaoui]] 1,420 m\n\n'''Natural resources:'''\n[[diamond]]s, [[uranium]], [[timber]], [[gold]], [[petroleum]], [[hydropower]]\n\n'''Land use:'''\n<br>''arable land:''\n2.89%\n<br>''permanent crops:''\n0.13%\n<br>''other:''\n96.98% (2012 est.)\n\n'''Irrigated land:'''\n1.35&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2003)\n\n'''Total renewable water resources:'''\n144.4&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> (2011)\n\n'''Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):'''\n<br>''total:''\n0.07&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>/yr (83%/17%/1%)\n<br>''per capita:''\n17.42 m<sup>3</sup>/yr (2005)\n\n'''Natural hazards:'''\nhot, dry, dusty harmattan winds affect northern areas; floods are common\n\n'''Environment - current issues:'''\ntap water is not potable; poaching has diminished its reputation as one of the last great wildlife refuges; desertification\n\n'''Environment - international agreements:'''\n<br>''party to:''\n[[Biodiversity]], [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Desertification]], [[Endangered Species]], Hazardous Wastes, [[Nuclear Test Ban]], [[Ozone Layer Protection]], [[Tropical Timber 94]], Wetlands\n<br>''signed, but not ratified:''\n[[Law of the Sea]]\n\n'''Geography - note:'''\n[[landlocked]]; almost the precise center of Africa\n\n== Extreme points ==\n\nThis is a list of the extreme points of the [[Central African Republic]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\n\n*Northernmost point - unnamed location in the [[Aoukal\u00e9 river]] on the border with [[Chad]], [[Vakaga province]]\n*Easternmost point - unnamed location immediately east of the [[tripoint]] with [[Sudan]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and south of the town of [[Ezo, Sudan|Ezo]] in [[Sudan]], [[Haut-Mbomou province]]\n*Southernmost point - the [[tripoint]] with [[Cameroon]] and the [[Republic of Congo]], [[Sangha province]]\n*Westernmost point - unnamed location on the border with [[Cameroon]] west of the town of [[Kound\u00e9]] in Central African Republic near Cameroon's [[Lokoti]] to [[Garoua Boulai]] road, [[Nana Mamb\u00e9r\u00e9 province]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{CIA World Factbook}}\n\n{{Central African Republic topics}}\n{{Geography of Africa}}\n{{Africa topic|Climate of}}\n\n[[Category:Geography of the Central African Republic| ]]\n\n[[pt:Rep\u00fablica Centro-Africana#Geografia]]", "sha1": "by2cxp7rm5u0hyqwyehpcbjq5f57mp9"}}, {"title": "Demographics of the Central African Republic", "ns": "0", "id": "5481", "revision": {"id": "857070970", "parentid": "849783580", "timestamp": "2018-08-29T11:04:33Z", "contributor": {"username": "Afus199620", "id": "30645640"}, "comment": "/* Fertility and Births */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of the [[Central African Republic]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.\n\n[[Image:Central African Republic-demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of Central African Republic, Data of [[FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]\nThere are more than 80 ethnic groups in the [[Central African Republic]] (CAR), each with its own language.

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and parliament.\n\nChanges in government have occurred in recent years by three methods: violence, negotiations, and elections. Both Bozize and Djotodia assumed the Presidency through takeover by violent means; however, elections were held in March 2005 and promised in 2013. A ceasefire agreement in January 2013 called for a multipartisan unity government.\n\nThe government was deposed on March 13, 2003 by forces under the rebel leader [[Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9]], who promised elections in 18 to 30 months. A new cabinet was set up on April 1, 2003. Elections were held on March 13, 2005.\n\nOn January 11, 2013, a ceasefire was signed by the [[S\u00e9l\u00e9ka]] rebel coalition, which had aimed to bring down the government of President Boziz\u00e9. According to this agreement, a new unity government would be formed. The President would appoint a new prime minister from the opposition parties, and the [[National Assembly of the Central African Republic]] would be dissolved and new legislative elections would be held within twelve months.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20990671 Central African Republic ceasefire signed]</ref>\n\nHowever, two months later, the S\u00e9l\u00e9ka rebels felt their terms were not being met, and at the culmination of the [[2012-2013 Central African Republic conflict]], they attacked and took the capital, [[Bangui]].

The vast bulk of the population engages in [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]] and 55% of the country's GDP arises from [[agriculture]]. Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry, remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African Republic (CAR), with more than 70% of the population living in outlying areas.\n\nPrincipal food [[crop]]s include [[cassava]], [[peanut]]s, [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[maize]], [[sesame]], and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]]. Principal [[cash crop]]s for [[export]] include [[cotton]], [[coffee]], and [[tobacco]]. [[Timber]] has accounted for about 16% of export earnings and the [[diamond]] industry for nearly 54%.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n[[File:Ubangi river near Bangui.jpg|thumb|240px|Though periodically unusable, the Ubangi River is nonetheless an important transportation route.]]Much of the country's limited [[electricity|electrical supply]] is provided by [[hydroelectric plant]]s located in [[Boali]]. Fuel supplies must be barged in via the [[Oubangui River]] or trucked overland through [[Cameroon]], resulting in frequent shortages of [[gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], and [[jet fuel]]. The C.A.R.'s [[transportation]] and [[communication]] network is limited. The country has only 429 kilometers of paved road, limited international, and no domestic [[Civil aviation|air service]], and does not possess a [[railroad]].\n\nRiver traffic on the [[Oubangui River]] is impossible from April to July, and conflict in the region has sometimes prevented shipments from moving between [[Kinshasa]] and [[Bangui]]. The [[telephone]] system functions, albeit imperfectly. Four [[radio station]]s currently operate in the C.A.R., as well as one [[television station]]. Numerous [[newspaper]]s and pamphlets are published on a regular basis, and one company has begun providing [[Internet service provider|Internet service]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph.}}\n\n== Forestry ==\n[[File:Central African Republic - Log transport.jpg|thumb|250px|The country has rich but largely unexploited natural resources; meanwhile, forestry remains an important contributor to the C. A. R. economy.]]\n\nThere are 22.2 million hectares (56.5 million acres) of forest (36 percent of the total land area), but only 3.4 million hectares (8.4 million acres) of dense forest, all in the south in the regions bordering the DRC, Republic of Congo and Cameroon. The CAR\u2019s exploitable forests cover 27 million hectares (68 million acres), or 43% of the total land area. Transportation bottlenecks on rivers and lack of rail connections are serious hindrances to commercial exploitation. Most timber is shipped down the Ubangi and Zaire rivers and then on the Congo railway to the Atlantic. About 34 species of trees are felled, but 85 percent of the total is [[ayous]], [[Pouteria|Aniegr\u00e9]], [[iroko]], [[sapele]], and [[sipo (timber)|sipo]].<ref name=\"ETTF\">{{cite web|title=Country profile Central African Republic|url=http://www.timbertradeportal.com/countries/central-african-republic/|website=EUROPEAN TIMBER TRADE FEDERATION|accessdate=28 October 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nA dozen sawmills produced {{convert|650000|m3|cuft }} of sawn logs and veneer logs in 2014. The government is encouraging production of plywood and veneer due to the high exporting costs due to poor transportation infrastructure. Competition from lower-cost Asian and Latin American loggers has hurt the local industry, which is encumbered with high transportation and labor costs. In 2014, the country exported 59.3 million US dollars of forest products. This accounts for 40% of the countries total export earnings.<ref name=\"ETTF\" />\n\n== Natural resources ==\nThe country has rich but largely unexploited natural resources in the form of [[diamond]]s, [[gold]], [[uranium]], and other [[mineral]]s. Diamonds constitute one of the most important exports of the CAR, frequently accounting for 20-30% of export [[revenue]]s, but an estimated 30-50% of the diamonds produced each year leave the country clandestinely. There may be [[petroleum]] deposits along the country's northern border with [[Chad]] (Two billion barrels of oil are present in private estimates).\n\nDiamonds are the only of these mineral resources currently being developed; reported sales of largely uncut diamonds range between 20-30% of the CAR's export earnings. Industry contributes less than 20% of the country's GDP, with artesian diamond mining, [[breweries]], and [[sawmill]]s making up the bulk of the sector. Services currently account for 25% of GDP, largely because of the oversized government [[bureaucracy]] and high [[transportation]] costs arising from the country's landlocked position.<ref>http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/caf/</ref>\n\n== Agriculture ==\n{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=Boutures de manioc.jpg|image2=R\u00e9colte du manioc.jpg|image3=Manioc transformation.JPG|width=250|caption1=[[Cassava]] plant trimmings to be planted.|caption2=A woman harvesting and transporting cassava in Boukoko.|caption3=Women processing fresh cassava for cooking.}}\n74 percent of the population in the [[Central African Republic]] works in the [[agriculture industry]], so [[Central African Republic]]'s economy is dominated by the cultivation and sale of foodcrops such as [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[cassava]], [[peanut]]s, [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[sesame]], and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s. The importance of foodcrops over exported [[cash crop]]s is illustrated by the fact that the total production of cassava, the staple food of most Central Africans, ranges between c. 200,000 and 300,000 tons a year, while the production of [[cotton]], the principal exported cash crop, ranges from c. 25,000 to 45,000 tons a year.\n\nFoodcrops are not exported in large quantities but they still constitute the principal cash crops of the country because Central Africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of surplus foodcrops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or [[coffee]]. Many rural and urban women also transform some foodcrops into [[Alcoholic beverage|alcoholic drinks]] such as [[sorghum beer]] or [[Distilled beverage|hard liquor]] and derive considerable income from the sale of these drinks. Much of the income derived from the sale of foods and alcohol is not \"on the books\" and thus is not considered in calculating [[per capita income]], which is one reason why official figures for per capita income are not accurate in the case of the CAR.\n\nThe per capita income of the CAR is often listed as being around $400 a year, said to be one of the lowest in the world, but this figure is based mostly on reported sales of [[export]]s and largely ignores the more important but unregistered sale of foods, locally produced alcohol, [[diamond]]s, [[ivory]], [[bushmeat]], and [[traditional medicine]]s, for example. The [[informal economy]] of the CAR is more important than the formal economy for most Central Africans.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph.}}\n\n== Finance and banking ==\nThe financial sector of the CAR, the smallest in the CEMAC, plays a limited role in supporting economic growth. Suffering from weak market infrastructure and legal and judicial frameworks, the financial system remains small, undeveloped, and dominated by commercial banks. Because of economic and security concerns, financial institutions, and particularly microfinance institutions (MFIs), have consolidated their business in the capital, Bangui, over the past few years.<ref name=\"MFW4A\">[http://www.mfw4a.org/central-african-republic/car-financial-sector-profile.html MFW4A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222203512/http://www.mfw4a.org/central-african-republic/car-financial-sector-profile.html |date=22 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nWith less than 1 percent of the total population holding a bank account, access to financial services is extremely limited in the CAR. Microfinance accounts only for 1 percent of the total credit facilities, serving 0.5 percent of the population. Low levels of mobile penetration \u2013 which stand at 30 percent, a significantly lower percentage than in the rest of the continent \u2013 dampen the potential expansion of access to financial services through mobile technology.<ref name=\"MFW4A\"/>\n\n== Fishing ==\n\nFishing is carried on extensively along the rivers, but most of the catch is sold or bartered on the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) side of the [[Ubangi River]]. In 1950,\nthe government began a fish-farming program, and by the end of 1968 there were almost 12,000 ponds. The 2003 fish catch was about 15,000 tons.<ref name=\"National Aquaculture Sector Overview: Democratic Republic of the Congo\">{{cite web|last1=G.L.B|first1=Kombozi|title=\u00a9 FAO 2006-2017.

As one [[UNDP]] official put it, the CAR is a country \"sous serum,\" or a country hooked up to an [[Intravenous therapy|IV]]. (Mehler 2005:150) The very presence of numerous foreign personnel and organizations in the country, including peacekeepers and even [[refugee camp]]s, provides an important source of revenue for many Central Africans.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph. A full citation is needed for Mehler 2005:150}}\n\nIn the 40 years since independence, the CAR has made slow progress toward economic development. Economic mismanagement, poor [[infrastructure]], a limited [[tax base]], scarce private investment, and adverse external conditions have led to deficits in both its [[budget]] and external [[trade]]. Its debt burden is considerable, and the country has seen a decline in per capita [[gross national product]] over the last 40 years.\n\nImportant constraints to economic development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy of misdirected [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] policies. The 50% [[devaluation]] of the currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had mixed effects on the CAR's economy. Diamond, timber, coffee, and cotton exports increased, leading an estimated rise of GDP of 70% in 1994 and nearly 50% in 1995.\n\nMilitary rebellions and social unrest in 1996 were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and a drop in GDP of 2%. Ongoing violence between the government and rebel military groups over pay issues, living conditions, and political representation has destroyed many businesses in the capital and reduced tax revenues for the government.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph.}}\n\nThe [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) approved an Extended Structure Adjustment Facility in 1998. The government has set targets of annual 5% growth and 25% inflation for 2000-2001. Structural adjustment programs with the [[World Bank]] and IMF and interest-free credits to support investments in the [[agriculture]], [[livestock]], and transportation sectors have had limited impact. The World Bank and IMF are now encouraging the government to concentrate exclusively on implementing much-needed economic reforms to jump-start the economy and defining its fundamental priorities with the aim of alleviating poverty. As a result, many of the state-owned business entities have been privatized and limited efforts have been made to standardize and simplify labor and investment codes and to address problems of corruption. The Central African Government is currently in the process of adopting new labor and investment codes.<ref>https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2012/191125.htm</ref>\n\n==Macro-Economic==\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=1980&ey=2023&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=626&s=NGDP_RPCH,PPPGDP,PPPPC,PCPIPCH,GGXWDG_NGDP&grp=0&a=&pr.x=85&pr.y=9|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-09-05|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=en-US|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Year\n!1980\n!1985\n!1990\n!1995\n!2000\n!2005\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n|-\n|GDP in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|0.93 Bln.\n|1.39 Bln..\n|1.83 Bln.\n|2.35 Bln.\n|2.69 Bln.\n|2.69 Bln.\n|3.22 Bln.\n|3.45 Bln.\n|3.59 Bln.\n|3.68 Bln.\n|3.84 Bln.\n|4.05 Bln.\n|4.29 Bln.\n|2.76 Bln.\n|2.84 Bln.\n|3.01 Bln.\n|3.19 Bln.\n|3.37 Bln.\n|-\n|GDP per capita in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|406\n|537\n|628\n|718\n|738\n|752\n|797\n|841\n|858\n|863\n|883\n|913\n|949\n|599\n|604\n|627\n|652\n|677\n|-\n|GDP growth<br /><small>(real)</small>\n|\u22123.0 %\n|3.7 %\n|\u22122.1 %\n|4.3 %\n|\u22121.7 %\n|2.5 %\n|4.8 %\n|4.6 %\n|2.1 %\n|1.9 % \n|3.0 %\n|3.3 %\n|4.1 %\n|\u221236.7 %\n|1.0 %\n|4.8 %\n|4.5 %\n|4.0 %\n|-\n|Inflation<br /><small>(in Percent)</small>\n|13.3 %\n|10.5 %\n|\u22120.2 %\n|19.2 %\n|3.2 %\n|2.9 %\n|6.7 %\n|0.9 %\n|9.3 %\n|3.5 %\n|1.5 %\n|1.2 %\n|5.9 %\n|6.6 %\n|11.6 %\n|4.5 %\n|4.6 %\n|3.8 %\n|-\n|Government debt<br /><small>(Percentage of GDP)</small>\n|...\n|...\n|...\n|...\n|93 %\n|109 %\n|49 %\n|49 %\n|37 %\n|21 %\n|21 %\n|22 %\n|24 %\n|39 %\n|69 %\n|64 %\n|56 %\n|53 %\n|}\n\n== Exchange Rates ==\n{{Exchange Rate|XAF}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Central African Republic]]\n* [[Economy of Africa]]\n* [[Mining industry of the Central African Republic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{dmoz|Regional/Africa/Central_African_Republic/Business_and_Economy/Economic_Development}}\n\n{{Central African Republic topics}}\n{{Africa in topic|Economy of}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Economy of the Central African Republic}}\n[[Category:Economy of the Central African Republic| ]]\n[[Category:World Trade Organization member economies|Central African Republic]]\n[[Category:African Union member economies|Central African Republic]]", "sha1": "2k4f2wn220ftpi65ocri2kn0l6z8535"}}, {"title": "Telecommunications in the Central African Republic", "ns": "0", "id": "5484", "revision": {"id": "864790891", "parentid": "846792078", "timestamp": "2018-10-19T13:47:05Z", "contributor": {"username": "Gq5483", "id": "34902476"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Telecommunications in the Central African Republic''' includes radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet as well as the postal system.\n\nPersistent conflict has hampered telecommunication and media development in the [[Central African Republic]].

The immediate former president, General [[Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9]] was a former army chief-of-staff and his government included several high-level military officers. Among the country's five presidents since independence in 1960, three have been former army chiefs-of-staff, who have taken power through [[coups d'\u00e9tat]]. No president with a military background has, however, ever been succeeded by a new military president.\n\nThe country's first president, [[David Dacko]] was overthrown by his army chief-of-staff, [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa]] in 1966. Following Bokassa, David Dacko was restored in 1981, only to be overthrown once again by his new army chief of staff, General [[Andr\u00e9 Kolingba]], after only a few months in power.\n\nIn 1993, [[Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9]] became the Central African Republic's first elected president. He soon became unpopular within the army, resulting in violent mutinies in 1996\u20131997. In May 2001, there was an unsuccessful coup attempt by Kolingba and once again Patass\u00e9 had to turn to friends abroad for support, this time [[Libya]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]]. Some months later, at the end of October, Patass\u00e9 sacked his army chief-of-staff, Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, and attempted to arrest him. Boziz\u00e9 then fled to [[Chad]] and gathered a group of rebels. In 2002, he seized [[Bangui]] for a short period, and in March 2003 took power in a coup d'\u00e9tat .<ref name=\"one\">{{cite web|url=http://www.franceevasion.com/toutsavoir/pays-republique-centrafricaine.htm|title=\u2013 Histoire: R\u00e9publique centrafricaine|work=franceevasion.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625065519/http://www.franceevasion.com/toutsavoir/pays-republique-centrafricaine.htm|archivedate=2007-06-25|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Importance of ethnicity===\nWhen General Kolingba became president in 1981, he implemented an ethnicity-based recruitment policy for the administration. Kolingba was a member of the [[Yakoma people]] from the south of the country, which made up approximately 5% of the total population. During his rule, members of Yakoma were granted all key positions in the administration and made up a majority of the military. This later had disastrous consequences when Kolingba was replaced by a member of a northerner tribe, Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9.\n\n===Army mutinies of 1996\u20131997===\nSoon after the election 1993, Patass\u00e9 became unpopular within the army, not least because of his inability to pay their wages (partly due to economic mismanagement and partly because [[France]] suddenly ended its economic support for the soldiers' wages). Another reason for the irritation was that most of FACA consisted of soldiers from Kolingba's ethnic group, the [[Yakoma people|Yakoma]]. During Patass\u00e9's rule they had become increasingly marginalised, while he created militias favouring his own Gbaya tribe, as well as neighbouring Sara and Kaba. This resulted in army mutinies in 1996\u20131997, where fractions of the military clashed with the presidential guard, the ''Unit\u00e9 de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sidentielle (USP)'' and militias loyal to Patass\u00e9.<ref name=\"two\">[http://www.sangonet.com/actu-snews/santeah/fich-RCA-unhcr2005.pdf \u2013 UNDP: Fiche Pays: R\u00e9publique centrafricaine (2005)]</ref>\n\n* On April 18, 1996, between 200\u2013300 soldiers mutinied, claiming that they had not received their wages since 1992\u20131993. The confrontations between the soldiers and the presidential guard resulted in 9 dead and 40 wounded. French forces provided support (Operation Almandin I) and acted as negotiators. The unrest ended when the soldiers were finally paid their wages by France and the President agreed not to start legal proceedings against them.\n* On May 18, 1996, a second mutiny was led by 500 soldiers who refused to be disarmed, denouncing the agreement reached in April. French forces were once again called to Bangui (Operation Almadin II), supported by the militaries of Chad and [[Gabon]]. 3,500 foreigners were evacuated during the unrest, which left 43 persons dead and 238 wounded.\n* On May 26, a peace agreement was signed between France and the mutineers. The latter were promised amnesty, and were allowed to retain their weapons. Their security was ensured by the French military.\n* On November 15, 1996, a third mutiny took place, and 1,500 French soldiers were flown in to ensure the safety of foreigners. The mutineers demanded the discharge of the president.\n\nOn 6 December, a negotiation process started, facilitated by Gabon, [[Burkina-Faso]], Chad and [[Mali]]. The military \u2014 supported by the opposition parties \u2014 insisted that Patass\u00e9 had to resign. In January, 1997, however, the [[Bangui Agreements]] were signed and the French EFAO troop were replaced by the 1,350 soldiers of the ''Mission interafricaine de surveillance des Accords de Bangui (MISAB)''. In March, all mutineers were granted amnesty. The fighting between MISAB and the mutineers continued with a large offensive in June, resulting in up to 200 casualties. After this final clash, the mutineers calmed.<ref name=\"two\" />\n\nAfter the mutinies, President Patass\u00e9 suffered from a typical \"dictator's paranoia\", resulting in a period of cruel terror executed by the presidential guard and various militias within the FACA loyal to the president, such as the Karako. The violence was directed against the Yakoma tribe, of which it is estimated that 20,000 persons fled during this period. The oppression also targeted other parts of the society. The president accused his former ally France of supporting his enemies and sought new international ties. When he strengthened his presidential guard (creating the FORSIDIR, see below), Libya sent him 300 additional soldiers for his own personal safety. When former President Kolingba attempted a coup d'\u00e9tat in 2001 (which was, according to Patass\u00e9, supported by France), the [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] (MLC) of [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] in DR Congo came to his rescue.<ref name=\"three\">[http://web.amnesty.org/web/ar2002.nsf/afr/central+african+republic!Open \u2013 Amnesty International: Amnesty International Report 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813060557/http://web.amnesty.org/web/ar2002.nsf/afr/central%2Bafrican%2Brepublic%21Open |date=August 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nCrimes conducted by Patass\u00e9's militias and Congolese soldiers during this period are now being investigated by the [[International Criminal Court]], who wrote that \"sexual violence appears to have been a central feature of the conflict\", having identified more than 600 rape victims.<ref name=\"four\">[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070522/wl_africa_afp/icccentrafrica_070522145948 \u2013 Yahoo News: ICC to investigate Central African Republic sexual violence, 22 May 2007]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Present situation==\nThe FACA has been dominated by soldiers from the Yakoma ethnic group since the time of Kolingba. It has hence been considered disloyal by the two northerner presidents Patass\u00e9 and Boziz\u00e9, both of whom have equipped and run their own militias outside FACA. The military also proved its disloyalty during the mutinies in 1996\u20131997. Although Francois Boziz\u00e9 had a background in FACA himself (being its chief-of-staff from 1997 to 2001), he was cautious by retaining the defence portfolio, as well as by appointing his son Jean-Francis Boziz\u00e9 cabinet director in charge of running the Ministry of Defence. He kept his old friend General Antoine Gambi as Chief of Staff.

The situation has deteriorated since early 2006, and the regular army and the presidential guard regularly execute extortion, torture, killings and other human rights violations. There is no possibility for the national judicial system to investigate these cases. At the end of 2006, there were an estimated 150,000 internally displaced people in CAR. During a UN mission in the northern part of the country in November 2006, the mission had a meeting with a prefect who said that he could not maintain law and order over the military and the presidential guards. The FACA currently conducts summary executions and burns houses. On the route between [[Kaga-Bandoro]] and Ouandago some 2,000 houses have been burnt, leaving an estimated 10,000 persons homeless.<ref name=\"eleven\">[http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004BE3B1/(httpInfoFiles)/63ACDE89E61019B5C125726F0035E8A0/$file/CAR_report_Jan2007.pdf \u2013 Internal displacement in Central African Republic: a protection crisis, January 26, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621160703/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004BE3B1/%28httpInfoFiles%29/63ACDE89E61019B5C125726F0035E8A0/%24file/CAR_report_Jan2007.pdf |date=June 21, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Reform of the army===\nBoth the ''Multinational Force in the Central African Republic'' (FOMUC) and France are assisting in the current reform of the army.

Boziz\u00e9 is in many ways dependent on Chad's support. Chad has an interest in CAR, since it needs to ensure calmness close to its oil fields and [[Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project|the pipeline leading to the Cameroonian coast]], close to CAR's troubled northwest. Before seizing power, Boziz\u00e9 built up his rebel force in Chad, trained and augmented by the Chadian military. Chadian President [[Idriss D\u00e9by|D\u00e9by]] assisted him actively in taking the power in March 2003 (his rebel forces included 100 Chadian soldiers). After the coup, Chad provided another 400 soldiers. Current direct support includes 150 non-FOMUC Chadian troops that patrol the border area near Gor\u00e9, a contingent of soldiers in Bangui, and troops within the presidential lifeguard.<ref name=\"nine\" /> The CEMAC Force includes 121 Chadian soldiers.\n\n=== France ===\nThere has been an almost uninterrupted French military presence in Central African Republic since independence, regulated through agreements between the two Governments. French troops were allowed to be based in the country and to intervene in cases of destabilisation. This was particularly important during the cold war era, when Francophone Africa was regarded as a natural French sphere of influence.\n\nAdditionally, the strategic location of the country made it a more interesting location for military bases than its neighbours, and [[Bouar]] and Bangui were hence two of the most important French bases abroad.\n\nHowever, in 1997, following [[Lionel Jospin|Lionel Jospin's]] expression \"Neither interference nor indifference\", France came to adopt new strategic principles for its presence in Africa. This included a reduced permanent presence on the continent and increased support for multilateral interventions.<ref name=\"five\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/27c/377.html|title=Out of Africa? Not the French|work=hartford-hwp.com}}</ref> In Central African Republic, the Bouar base and the B\u00e9al Camp (at that time home to 1,400 French soldiers) in Bangui were shut down, as the French concentrated its African presence to [[Abidjan]], [[Dakar]], [[Djibouti]], [[Libreville]] and [[N'Djamena]] and the deployment of a ''Force d'action rapide'', based in France.<ref name=\"six\">[http://www.uca.edu.ar/esp/sec-fpoliticas/esp/docs-publicaciones/coleccion/ed-especial/02martin.pdf \u2013 Guy Martin: France\u2019s African policy in transition: disengagement and redeployment, University of Virginia, 2000]</ref>\n\nHowever, due to the situation in the country, France has retained a military presence. During the mutinies, 2,400 French soldiers patrolled the streets of Bangui. Their official task was to evacuate foreign citizens, but this did not prevent direct confrontations with the mutineers (resulting in French and mutineer casualties). The level of French involvement resulted in protests among the Central African population, since many sided with the mutineers and accused France of defending a dictator against the people's will. Criticism was also heard in France, where some blamed their country for its protection of a discredited ruler, totally incapable of exerting power and managing the country.<ref name=\"seven\">[http://www.african-geopolitics.org/show.aspx?ArticleId=3466 \u2013 Francis Laloupo: Centrafrique, un destin confisqu\u00e9] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927174737/http://www.african-geopolitics.org/show.aspx?ArticleId=3466 |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> After the mutinies in 1997, the MISAB became a multilateral force, but it was armed, equipped, trained and managed by France.

Africa|north]]-[[central Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Libya]] to the north, [[Sudan]] to the east, the [[Central African Republic]] to the south, [[Cameroon]] and [[Nigeria]] to the southwest, and [[Niger]] to the west. It is the fifth largest country in Africa and the second-largest in Central Africa in terms of area.\n\nChad has several regions: a [[desert]] zone in the north, an arid [[Sahel]]ian belt in the centre and a more fertile [[Sudanian Savanna]] zone in the south. [[Lake Chad]], after which the country is named, is the largest [[wetland]] in Chad and the second-largest in Africa. The capital [[N'Djamena]] is the largest [[List of cities in Chad|city]].  Chad's official languages are [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[French language|French]]. Chad is home to over 200 different [[List of ethnic groups in Chad|ethnic]] and [[Languages of Chad|linguistic groups]]. The most popular religion of Chad is Islam (at 55%), followed by Christianity (at 40%).\n\nBeginning in the 7th millennium BC, human populations moved into the Chadian basin in great numbers. By the end of the 1st millennium AD, a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region. [[France]] conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of [[French Equatorial Africa]]. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of [[Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye]]. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting [[The Tombalbaye Regime#Rebellion in Chad|civil war]] in 1965. In 1979 [[Transitional Government of National Unity|the rebels]] conquered the capital and put an end to the south's hegemony. However, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until [[Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9]] defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general [[Idriss D\u00e9by]]. Since 2003 the [[War in Darfur|Darfur crisis]] in Sudan has spilt over the border and [[Chadian Civil War (2005\u20132010)|destabilised the nation]], with hundreds of thousands of [[Sudanese refugees]] living in and around camps in eastern Chad. An uneven inclusion into the global political economy as a site for colonial resource extraction (primarily cotton and crude oil), a global economic system that does not promote nor encourage the development of Chadian industrialization,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=347BAAAAIAAJ|title=Poverty and neoliberalism: persistence and reproduction in the global south|year=2007|last=Bush|first=Ray|isbn=9780745319605}}</ref> and the failure to support local agricultural production has meant that the majority of Chadians live in daily uncertainty and hunger.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_5HjgjpmmUC|title=Maldevelopment: Anatomy of a Global Failure|publisher=[[United Nations University Press]]|last=Amin|first=Samir|year=1990|isbn=9780862329310}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tBXF3IIcBwYC|title=Looting Africa: The Economics of Exploitation|last=Bond|first=Patrick|publisher=[[Zed Books]]|year=2006|isbn=9781842778111}}</ref> \n\nWhile many political parties are active, power lies firmly in the hands of President D\u00e9by and his political party, the [[Patriotic Salvation Movement]]. Chad remains plagued by [[political violence]] and recurrent attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coups d'\u00e9tat]]. \nSince 2003, [[petroleum|crude oil]] has become the country's primary source of export earnings, superseding the traditional [[cotton]] industry.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of Chad}}\n\nIn the 7th millennium BC, ecological conditions in the northern half of Chadian territory favored human settlement, and the region experienced a strong population increase. Some of the most important [[African archaeology|African archaeological]] sites are found in Chad, mainly in the [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region]]; some date to earlier than 2000 BC.<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 44\u201345</ref><ref name=\"Collelo\">S.

The [[Kanem-Bornu Empire]] controlled almost all of what is today Chad.|left]]\n\nFor more than 2,000 years, the Chadian Basin has been inhabited by agricultural and sedentary people. The region became a crossroads of civilizations. The earliest of these were the legendary [[Sao civilisation|Sao]], descendants of the Hyksos who conquered Ancient Egypt known for skills in designing weapons and artifacts, they are also known for their oral histories. After a century of rule, the Sao fell to the [[Kanem Empire]],<ref name=Lange88>D. Lange 1988</ref><ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], p. 6</ref> the first and longest-lasting of the empires that developed in Chad's [[Sahel]]ian strip by the end of the 1st millennium AD. Two other states in the region, [[Sultanate of Bagirmi]] and [[Wadai Empire]] emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries. The power of Kanem and its successors was based on control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region.<ref name=\"Collelo\"/> These states, at least tacitly [[Islam in Africa|Muslim]], never extended their control to the southern grasslands except to [[Arab slave trade|raid for slaves]].<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 7\u20138</ref> In Kanem, about a third of the population were slaves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |title=Welcome to Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's Guide to Black History |work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=29 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006131931/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |archivedate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chadian soldier of WWII.jpg|thumb|left|A Chadian soldier fighting for [[Free French Forces|Free France]] during [[World War II]]. The Free French Forces included 15,000 soldiers from Chad.<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], p. 53</ref>]]\n\nFrench colonial expansion led to the creation of the {{lang|fr|Territoire Militaire des Pays et Protectorats du Tchad}} in 1900. By 1920, France had secured full control of the colony and incorporated it as part of [[French Equatorial Africa]].<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 8, 309</ref> [[Colonial Chad|French rule in Chad]] was characterised by an absence of policies to unify the territory and sluggish modernisation compared to other French colonies.<ref name=\"Decalo, pp. 8\u20139\">[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 8\u20139</ref>\n\nThe French primarily viewed the colony as an unimportant source of untrained labour and raw cotton; France introduced large-scale cotton production in 1929. The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed and had to rely on the dregs of the French civil service. Only the [[Sara people|Sara]] of the south was governed effectively; French presence in the Islamic north and east was nominal. The educational system was affected by this neglect.<ref name=\"Collelo\"/><ref name=\"Decalo, pp. 8\u20139\"/>\n\nAfter [[World War II]], France granted Chad the status of [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas territory]] and its inhabitants the right to elect representatives to the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] and a [[National Assembly (Chad)|Chadian assembly]]. The largest political party was the [[Chadian Progressive Party]] (PPT), based in the southern half of the colony. Chad was granted independence on 11 August 1960 with the PPT's leader, [[Sara people|Sara]] [[Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye]], as its first [[Heads of state of Chad|president]].<ref name=\"Collelo\"/><ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 248\u2013249</ref><ref>[[#Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], p. 17</ref>\n\nTwo years later, Tombalbaye banned opposition parties and established a one-party system. Tombalbaye's autocratic rule and insensitive mismanagement exacerbated inter-ethnic tensions. In 1965, Muslims in the north, led by the [[FROLINAT|National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT)]], began a [[Transitional Government of National Unity|civil war]]. Tombalbaye was [[1975 Chadian coup d'\u00e9tat|overthrown and killed]] in 1975,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917376,00.html \"Death of a Dictator\"], ''Time'', (28 April 1975).

Later, more renowned groups such as African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix modernity and tradition. Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on ''sai'', a traditional style of music from southern Chad. The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music. However, in 1995 greater interest has developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring Chadian artists.

Although the Spanish did not find the extensive gold and silver they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of Chile's central valley, and Chile became part of the [[Spanish Empire]].<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nConquest took place gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks. A massive [[Mapuche]] insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death and the destruction of many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of [[slavery]] by the Spanish crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission. Despite royal prohibitions, relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/storiadellaguer00caivgoog/storiadellaguer00caivgoog_djvu.txt |title=B\u00e1rbaros, page 66.

The [[Government Junta of Chile (1810)|Government Junta of Chile]] proclaimed Chile an autonomous republic within the Spanish monarchy (in memory of this day, Chile celebrates its [[Fiestas Patrias (Chile)|National Day]] on 18 September each year).\n\nAfter these events, a movement for total independence, under the command of [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]] (one of the most renowned patriots) and his two brothers Juan Jos\u00e9 and [[Luis Carrera]], soon gained a wider following. Spanish attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called the [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]] led to a prolonged struggle, including infighting from [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], who challenged Carrera's leadership.\n\nIntermittent warfare continued until 1817. With Carrera in prison in Argentina, O'Higgins and anti-Carrera cohort [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]], hero of the [[Argentine War of Independence]], led [[Army of the Andes|an army]] that [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes]] into Chile and defeated the royalists. On 12 February 1818, [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|Chile was proclaimed an independent republic]]. The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th-century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nChile slowly started to expand its influence and to establish its borders. By the Tantauco Treaty, the archipelago of Chilo\u00e9 was incorporated in 1826. The economy began to boom due to the discovery of silver ore in Cha\u00f1arcillo, and the growing trade of the port of Valpara\u00edso, which led to conflict over maritime supremacy in the Pacific with Peru. At the same time, attempts were made to strengthen sovereignty in southern Chile intensifying [[Occupation of Araucan\u00eda|penetration into Araucan\u00eda]] and [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|colonizing Llanquihue with German immigrants]] in 1848. Through the founding of [[Fort Bulnes]] by the [[Schooner Ancud]] under the command of [[John Williams Wilson]], the [[Magallanes Region|Magallanes region]] joined the country in 1843, while the [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta region]], at the time part of Bolivia, began to fill with people.\n\n[[File:Sinking of the Esmeralda during the battle of Iquique.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Battle of Iquique]] on 21 May 1879. The victory of Chile in the [[War of the Pacific]] allowed its expansion into new territories.]]\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by the [[Occupation of Araucan\u00eda]]. The [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] confirmed Chilean sovereignty over the [[Strait of Magellan]]. As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with Peru and Bolivia (1879\u201383), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable [[Caliche (mineral)#Chilean caliche|nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence. Chile had joined the stand as one of the high-income countries in South America by 1870.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors. Soon after, the country engaged in a [[Argentine\u2013Chilean naval arms race|vastly expensive naval arms race]] with [[Argentina]] that nearly led to war.\n\n===20th century===\n{{see also|Parliamentary Era in Chile|1960 Valdivia earthquake|South American dreadnought race}}\n[[File:Chilean battleship Almirante Latorre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Chile's ''Almirante Latorre'' [[dreadnought]] in 1921]]\nThe Chilean economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a ruling [[oligarchy]]. By the 1920s, the emerging middle and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo Alessandri]], whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress. In the 1920s, [[Marxism|Marxist]] groups with strong popular support arose.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nA military coup led by General [[Luis Altamirano]] in 1924 set off a period of political instability that lasted until 1932. Of the ten governments that held power in that period, the longest lasting was that of General [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo]], who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a [[de facto]] dictatorship (although not really comparable in harshness or corruption to the type of military dictatorship that has often bedeviled the rest of Latin America).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Authoritarianism in Latin America since independence|last=Fowler|first=Will|year=1996|publisher=Geenwood Press|location=University of Virginia|isbn=0-313-29843-2|pages=30\u201396}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Frazier|first=Lessie Jo |title=Salt in the Sand: Memory, Violence, and the Nation-State in Chile, 1890 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQU-GYGeVSEC&pg=PA163|accessdate=14 July 2013|date=17 July 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-4003-4|pages=163\u2013184}}</ref>\n\nBy relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. During the period of [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]] dominance (1932\u201352), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo to office for another six years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo in 1958, bringing Chilean conservatism back into power democratically for another term.\n\nThe [[Chilean presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]] of [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an [[absolute majority]] initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan \"Revolution in Liberty\", the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.<ref name=\"countrystudies\">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/chile/85.htm|title=Development and Breakdown of Democracy, 1830\u20131973|work=Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress|date=31 March 1994}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Salvador Allende Gossens-.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|[[Salvador Allende]]]]\n\nIn the 1970 election, Senator [[Salvador Allende]] of the [[Socialist Party of Chile]] (then part of the \"[[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]]\" coalition which included the Communists, Radicals, Social-Democrats, dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement, and the Independent Popular Action),<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/> achieved a partial majority in a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest, followed by candidates Radomiro Tomic for the Christian Democrat Party and Jorge Alessandri for the Conservative Party.

It entered into force in March 1981. After Pinochet's defeat in the [[Chilean national plebiscite, 1988|1988 plebiscite]], the constitution was amended to ease provisions for future amendments to the Constitution. In September 2005, President Ricardo Lagos signed into law several constitutional amendments passed by Congress. These include eliminating the positions of appointed senators and [[senators for life]], granting the President authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, and reducing the presidential term from six to four years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4157908.stm|title=Chile scraps Pinochet-era system|publisher=BBC | date=16 August 2005 | accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Congress of Chile]] has a 38-seat [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] and a 120-member [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]]. Senators serve for eight years with staggered terms, while deputies are elected every 4 years. The last congressional elections were held on 17 November 2013, concurrently with the presidential election. The current Senate has a 21\u201315 split in favor of the governing coalition and 2 independents. The current lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, contains 67 members of the governing center-left coalition, 48 from the center-right opposition and 5 from small parties or independents. The Congress is located in the port city of Valpara\u00edso, about {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=off}} west of the capital, Santiago.\n\n[[File:Congresschile.jpg|thumb|[[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]] building in [[Valpara\u00edso]]]]\n\nChile's congressional elections are governed by a [[Binomial System|binomial system]] that, for the most part, rewards the two largest representations equally, often regardless of their relative popular support. Parties are thus forced to form wide coalitions and, historically, the two largest coalitions (Concertaci\u00f3n and Alianza) split most of the seats. Only if the leading coalition ticket out-polls the second place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain both seats, which tends to lock the legislature in a roughly 50\u201350 split.\n\nChile's judiciary is independent and includes a court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the [[Supreme Court of Chile]]. In June 2005, Chile completed a nationwide overhaul of its criminal justice system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chileangovernment.cl/index.php?id=448&option=com_content&task=view |work=Chilean Government |title=President Lagos: We can make a greater effort to make yesterday's and today's trials equally just |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423171251/http://www.chileangovernment.cl/index.php?id=448&option=com_content&task=view |archivedate=23 April 2008 }}</ref> The reform has replaced inquisitorial proceedings with an adversarial system more similar to that of the United States.\n\nIn the 2001 congressional elections, the conservative [[Independent Democratic Union]] (UDI) surpassed the [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile|Christian Democrats]] for the first time to become the largest party in the lower house. In the [[Chilean parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]], both leading parties, the Christian Democrats and the UDI lost representation in favor of their respective allies [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] (which became the biggest party in the Concertaci\u00f3n block) and [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] in the right-wing alliance. In the 2009 legislative elections in Chile, the [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]] won 3 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in 30 years (the Communist Party was not allowed to exist as such during the dictatorship).\n\nChileans voted in the first round of presidential elections on 17 November 2013. None of the nine presidential candidates got more than 50 percent of the vote. As a result, the top two candidates, center-left [[Nueva Mayor\u00eda]] coalition's [[Michelle Bachelet]] and center-right [[Alianza (Chile)|Alianza]] coalition's [[Evelyn Matthei]], competed in a run-off election on 15 December 2013, which Bachelet won. This was Chile's sixth presidential election since the end of the Pinochet era. All six have been judged free and fair.

In 1837 the country aggressively challenged the dominance of Peru's port of [[Callao]] for preeminence in the Pacific trade routes, defeating the short-lived alliance between Peru and Bolivia, the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] (1836\u201339) in the [[War of the Confederation]]. The war dissolved the confederation while distributing power in the Pacific. A second international war, the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u201383), further increased Chile's regional role, while adding considerably to its territory.<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\nDuring the 19th century, Chile's commercial ties were primarily with Britain, a nation that had a major influence on the formation of the Chilean navy. The French influenced Chile's legal and educational systems and had a decisive impact on Chile, through the architecture of the capital in the boom years at the turn of the 20th century. German influence came from the organization and training of the army by [[Prussia]]ns.<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\nOn 26 June 1945, Chile participated as a founding member of the United Nations being among 50 countries that signed the [[United Nations Charter]] in San Francisco, California.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/members/list.shtml#c |title=United Nations Member States |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=1 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417145758/http://www.un.org/members/list.shtml |archivedate=17 April 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/members/growth.shtml |title=United Nations Member States |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/av/photo/detail/0001314.html?browse=all.html |title=The San Francisco Conference: Chile Signs United Nations Charter }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> With the military coup of 1973, Chile became isolated politically as a result of widespread human rights abuses.<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\nSince its return to democracy in 1990, Chile has been an active participant in the international political arena.

It was just a depression accumulated marine sediments began to rise at the end of the Mesozoic, 66 million years ago, due to the collision between the Nazca and South American plates, resulting in the Andes. The territory would be shaped by millions of years due to the folding of the rocks, forming the current relief.\n\nThe Chilean relief consists of the central depression, which crosses the country longitudinally, flanked by two mountain ranges that make up about 80% of the territory: the Andes mountains to the east-natural border with [[Bolivia]] and [[Argentina]] in the [[Atacama Region|region of Atacama]] and the Coastal Range west-minor height from the Andes. Chile's highest peak is the [[Nevado Ojos del Salado]], at 6891.3 m, which is also the highest volcano in the world. The highest point of the Coastal Range is Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna, at 3114 meters, located in the Sierra Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna, the south of [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta]]. Among the coastal mountains and the Pacific is a series of coastal plains, of variable length, which allow the settlement of coastal towns and big ports. Some areas of the plains territories encompass territory east of the Andes, and the Patagonian steppes and Magellan, or are high plateaus surrounded by high mountain ranges, such as the Altiplano or Puna de Atacama.\n\nThe [[Far North, Chile|Far North]] is the area between the northern boundary of the country and the [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] 26\u00b0 S, covering the first three regions. It is characterized by the presence of the [[Atacama desert]], the most arid in the world. The desert is fragmented by streams that originate in the area known as the [[Pampa del Tamarugal|pampas Tamarugal]]. The Andes, split in two and whose eastern arm runs [[Bolivia]], has a high altitude and volcanic activity, which has allowed the formation of the Andean altiplano and salt structures as the [[Salar de Atacama]], due to the gradual accumulation of sediments over time.\n\nTo the south is the [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]], extending to the [[Aconcagua River|Aconcagua river]]. Los Andes begin to decrease its altitude to the south and closer to the coast, reaching 90&nbsp;km away at the height of [[Illapel]], the narrowest part of the Chilean territory. The two mountain ranges intersect, virtually eliminating the intermediate depression. The existence of rivers flowing through the territory allows the formation of [[Transverse Valleys|transverse valleys]], where agriculture has developed strongly in recent times, while the [[coastal plains]] begin to expand.\n\nThe [[Zona Central, Chile|Central]] area is the most populated region of the country. The coastal plains are wide and allow the establishment of cities and ports along the Pacific. The Andes maintains altitudes above 6000m but descend slowly starts approaching the 4000 meters on average. The intermediate depression reappears becoming a fertile valley that allows agricultural development and human settlement, due to sediment accumulation. To the south, the Cordillera de la Costa reappears in the [[Nahuelbuta Range|range of Nahuelbuta]] while glacial sediments originate a series of lakes in the area of [[La Frontera, Chile|La Frontera]].\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left;clear:left;margin-right:1em\"\n|+ Ten highest peaks of Chile\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Name\n!scope=\"col\"| Altitude ([[metre|m]])\n|- \n|[[Nevado Ojos del Salado]]<sup>1</sup> ||align=right|6891,3\n|-\n|[[Nevado Tres Cruces]]<sup>1</sup> ||align=right|6758\n|- \n|[[Llullaillaco]]<sup>1</sup> ||align=right|6739\n|-\n|[[Incahuasi]]<sup>1</sup> ||align=right|6638\n|- \n|[[Tupungato]]<sup>1</sup> ||align=right|6565\n|-\n|[[Ata (mountain)|Ata Volcano]]<sup>1</sup> ||align=right|6501\n|-\n|[[Cerro El Muerto]]<sup>1</sup> ||align=right|6488\n|-\n|[[Parinacota (volcano)|Parinacota]]<sup>2</sup> ||align=right|6342\n|- \n|[[Pomerape]]<sup>2</sup> ||align=right|6282\n|- \n|[[Los Patos]]<sup>1</sup> ||align=right|6239\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#efefef;text-align:left\"|<small>Note:<sup>1</sup> shared with Argentina, <sup>2</sup> shared with Bolivia.</small>\n|}\nPatagonia extends from within Reloncavi, at the height of parallel 41\u00b0S, to the south. During the [[Llanquihue glaciation|last glaciation]], this area was covered by ice that strongly eroded Chilean relief structures. As a result, the intermediate depression sinks in the sea, while the coastal mountains rise to a series of archipelagos, such as [[Chilo\u00e9 Island|Chilo\u00e9]] and the [[Chonos Archipelago|Chonos]], disappearing in Taitao peninsula, in the parallel 47\u00b0S. The Andes mountain range loses height and erosion caused by the action of glaciers has caused [[fjords]].\n\nEast of the Andes, on the continent, or north of it, on the [[Tierra del Fuego (main island)|island of Tierra del Fuego]] are located relatively flat plains, which in the Strait of Magellan cover large areas.\n\nThe Andes, as he had done previously Cordillera de la Costa, begins to break in the ocean causing a myriad of islands and islets and disappear into it, sinking and reappearing in the Southern Antilles arc and then the Antarctic Peninsula, where it is called Antartandes, in the Chilean Antarctic Territory, lying between the meridians 53\u00b0W and 90\u00b0W.\n\nIn the middle of the Pacific, the country has sovereignty over several islands of volcanic origin, collectively known as Insular Chile. Of these, we highlight the archipelago of Juan Fernandez and Easter Island, which is located in the fracture zone between the Nazca plate and the Pacific plate known as East Pacific Rise.\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left;clear:left;margin-right:1em\"\n|+ Ten longest rivers of Chile\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Name\n!scope=\"col\"| Length ([[Kilometre|km]])\n|-\n|[[Loa River|Loa]] ||align=right|440\n|-\n|[[B\u00edo B\u00edo River|B\u00edo B\u00edo]] ||align=right|380\n|-\n|[[Baker River (Chile)|Baker]] ||align=right|370\n|-\n|[[Copiap\u00f3 River|Copiap\u00f3]] ||align=right|292\n|-\n|[[Maipo River|Maipo]] ||align=right|250\n|-\n|[[Yelcho River|Yelcho]]-[[Futaleuf\u00fa River|Futaleuf\u00fa]] ||align=right|246\n|-\n|[[Maule River|Maule]] ||align=right|240\n|-\n|[[Palena River|Palena]] ||align=right|240\n|-\n|[[Tolt\u00e9n River|Tolt\u00e9n]] ||align=right|231\n|-\n|[[Huasco River|Huasco]] ||align=right|230\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#efefef;text-align:left\"|<small>Note: All lengths exclusively through Chilean territory.</small>\n|}\n[[File:Lago General Carrera - Camino a Capilla de M\u00e1rmol.JPG|thumb|left|[[General Carrera Lake|General Carrera lake]], the largest in the country.]]\n\nDue to the characteristics of the territory, Chile is crossed by numerous rivers generally short in length and with low torrential flow.

Historically agriculture is one of the bases of Chile's economy. Now agriculture and allied sectors like [[forestry]], [[logging]] and [[fishing]] account for only 4.9% of the [[GDP]] {{As of|2007|lc=y}} and employ 13.6% of the country's labor force. Some major agriculture products of Chile include [[grapes]], [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[onion]]s, [[wheat]], [[corn]], [[oats]], [[peach]]es, [[garlic]], [[asparagus]], [[bean]]s, [[beef]], [[poultry]], [[wool]], [[fish]], [[timber]] and [[hemp]].[1] Due to its geographical isolation and strict customs policies Chile is free from diseases such as [[Mad Cow Disease]], [[Drosophilidae|fruit fly]] and [[Phylloxera]]. This, its location in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], which has quite different harvesting times from the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and its wide range of agriculture conditions are considered Chile's main comparative advantages. However, Chile's mountainous landscape limits the extent and intensity of agriculture so that arable land corresponds only to 2.62% of the total territory.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main article|Tourism in Chile}}\n[[File:Salar de Atacama.jpg|thumb|[[Salar de Atacama]] in the [[Atacama Desert]]]]\n[[File:Valle_del_Elqui,_La_Serena-Chile.JPG|thumb|[[Elqui Valley (wine region)|Elqui Valley]], wine and pisco region]]\n[[File:Cerro Concepcion.jpg|thumb|[[Valpara\u00edso]]]]\n[[File:Puerto Varas Osorno.jpg|thumb|[[Puerto Varas]]]]\n\nTourism in Chile has experienced sustained growth over the last few decades.

By the 16th century, [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] conquistadors began to subdue and colonize the region of present-day Chile, and the territory became a colony between 1540 and 1818, when it gained [[Chilean War of Independence|independence from Spain]]. The country's economic development was successively marked by the export of first agricultural produce, then [[sodium nitrate|saltpeter]] and later copper. The wealth of raw materials led to an economic upturn, but also led to dependency, and even wars with neighboring states. Chile was governed during most of its first 150 years of independence by different forms of restricted government, where the electorate was carefully vetted and controlled by an elite.\n\nFailure to address the economic and social increases and increasing political awareness of the less-affluent population, as well as indirect intervention and economic funding to the main political groups by both the [[KGB]]<ref name=\"R.

This in turn resulted in the [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|1973 coup d'\u00e9tat]] and the military dictatorship of General [[Augusto Pinochet]], whose subsequent [[Military government of Chile (1973\u201390)|17-year regime]] was responsible for numerous [[Human rights violations in Pinochet's Chile|human rights violations]] and [[Chicago Boys|deep market-oriented economic reforms]]. In 1990, Chile finally made a peaceful [[Chilean transition to democracy|transition to democracy]].\n\n==Early history (pre-1540)==\n{{see also|Incas in Central Chile}}\nAbout 10,000 years ago, migrating [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] settled in the fertile valleys and coastal areas of what is present day Chile. Pre-Hispanic Chile was home to over a dozen different Amerindian societies. The current prevalent theories are that the initial arrival of humans to the continent took place either along the Pacific coast southwards in a rather rapid expansion long preceding the [[Clovis culture]], or even trans-Pacific migration. These theories are backed by findings in the [[Monte Verde]] archaeological site, which predates the Clovis site by thousands of years. Specific early human settlement sites from the very early human habitation in Chile include the [[Cueva del Milodon]] and the [[Pali Aike Crater]]'s [[lava tube]].<ref name=Hogan>{{cite book |title=Pali Aike |last=Hogan |first=C.

A mobile people who engaged in trade and warfare with other indigenous groups, they lived in scattered family clusters and small villages. Although the Araucanians had no written language, they did use a common tongue. Those in what became central Chile were more settled and more likely to use irrigation. Those in the south combined slash-and-burn agriculture with hunting. Of the three Araucanian groups, the one that mounted the fiercest resistance to the attempts at seizure of their territory were the [[Mapuche]], meaning \"people of the land.\"<ref name=\"Mapuches\" />\n\n[[Image:Urville-Araucanians.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Mapuche]] were the original inhabitants of central and southern Chile.]]\nThe [[Inca Empire]] briefly extended their empire into what is now northern Chile, where they collected tribute from small groups of fishermen and oasis farmers but were not able to establish a strong cultural presence in the area.<ref name=Chile>{{cite book |title=Chile |last=Minnis |first=Natalie |year=2002 |publisher=Langenscheidt Publishing Group |page=381 |isbn=978-9812348906 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nf8SnJ_ZJbkC&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=inca+did+not+conquer+araucanians |accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref> As the Spaniards would after them, the Incas encountered fierce resistance and so were unable to exert control in the south.

The result of the bloody three-day confrontation known as the [[Battle of the Maule]] was that the Inca conquest of the territories of Chile ended at the [[Maule river]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1981.htm|title=Chile|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref> which subsequently became the boundary between the Incan empire and the Mapuche lands until the arrival of the Spaniards.\n\nScholars speculate that the total Araucanian population may have numbered 1.5 million at most when the Spaniards arrived in the 1530s; a century of European conquest and disease reduced that number by at least half. During the conquest, the Araucanians quickly added horses and European weaponry to their arsenal of clubs and bows and arrows. They became adept at raiding Spanish settlements and, albeit in declining numbers, managed to hold off the Spaniards and their descendants until the late 19th century. The Araucanians' valor inspired the Chileans to mythologize them as the nation's first national heroes, a status that did nothing, however, to elevate the wretched living standard of their descendants.<ref name=\"Mapuches\" /><ref>{{ISBN|978-9563107746}} Map of Patagonia</ref>\n\nThe Chilean [[Patagonia]] located south of the [[Calle-Calle River]] in [[Valdivia]] was composed of many tribes, mainly [[Tehuelches]], who were considered giants by Spaniards during Magellan's voyage of 1520.\n\nThe name Patagonia comes from the word ''[[patagon|patag\u00f3n]]''<ref name=\"Pigafetta\">[[Antonio Pigafetta]], ''[[:wikisource:it:Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo|Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo]]'', 1524: \"Il capitano generale nomin\u00f2 questi popoli Patagoni.\" The original word would probably be in [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]'s native Portuguese (''patag\u00e3o'') or the Spanish of his men (''patag\u00f3n'').

However, the title of discoverer of Chile is usually assigned to [[Diego de Almagro]]. Almagro was [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s partner, and he received the Southern area (''Nueva Toledo''). He organized an expedition that brought him to central Chile in 1537, but he found little of value to compare with the gold and silver of the Incas in Peru. Left with the impression that the inhabitants of the area were poor, he returned to Peru, later to be garotted following defeat by Hernando Pizarro in a Civil War.<ref>Prescott</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/chile/5.htm|title=Chile \u2013 Conquest and Colonization, 1535\u20131810|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter this initial excursion there was little interest from colonial authorities in further exploring modern-day Chile. However, [[Pedro de Valdivia]], captain of the army, realizing the potential for expanding the Spanish empire southward, asked Pizarro's permission to invade and conquer the southern lands. With a couple of hundred men, he subdued the local inhabitants and founded the city of Santiago de Nueva Extremadura, now [[Santiago de Chile]], on February 12, 1541.<ref>{{cite book |title=Carta a sus apoderados en la corte |last=Valdivia |first=Pedro de |authorlink=Pedro de Valdivia |date=October 15, 1550 |publisher= |location=  |language=Spanish |isbn= |page= |pages= |quote=...y llegado al valle de Copiap\u00f3, lo que trabaj\u00e9 en hacer la guerra a los naturales e fuertes que les romp\u00ed y la guerra que hice por todos los valles adelante, hasta que llegu\u00e9 al valle de Mapocho, que es cien leguas de Copiap\u00f3, e fund\u00e9 la cibdad de Sanctiago del Nuevo Extremo, a los veinte e cuatro de hebrero del a\u00f1o de mill quinientos e cuarenta e uno, formando Cabildo, Justicia e Regimiento. |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12593842001258285209068/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n[[File:El joven Lautaro - P. Subercaseaux.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Picture \"The young [[Lautaro]]\" of [[Pedro Subercaseaux]] that show to genius military and hero of the Arauco war after the arrival of the Spanish to Chilean territory.]]\nAlthough Valdivia found little gold in Chile he could see the agricultural richness of the land. He continued his explorations of the region west of the Andes and founded over a dozen towns and established the first ''[[encomienda]]s''. The greatest resistance to Spanish rule came from the [[Mapuche]] people, who opposed European conquest and colonization until the 1880s; this resistance is known as the [[Arauco War]]. Valdivia died at the [[Battle of Tucapel]], defeated by [[Lautaro (toqui)|Lautaro]], a young Mapuche ''[[toqui]]'' (war chief), but the European conquest was well underway.\n\nThe Spaniards never subjugated the Mapuche territories; various attempts at conquest, both by military and peaceful means, failed. The Great Uprising of 1598 swept all Spanish presence south of the [[B\u00edo-B\u00edo River]] except Chilo\u00e9 (and Valdivia which was decades later reestablished as a fort), and the great river became the frontier line between Mapuche lands and the Spanish realm.\nNorth of that line cities grew up slowly, and Chilean lands eventually became an important source of food for the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]].\n\nValdivia became the first governor of the [[Captaincy General of Chile]]. In that post, he obeyed the viceroy of Peru and, through him, the King of Spain and his bureaucracy. Responsible to the governor, town councils known as ''[[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo]]'' administered local municipalities, the most important of which was Santiago, which was the seat of a Royal Appeals Court (''Real Audiencia'') from 1609 until the end of colonial rule.\n\nChile was the least wealthy realm of the Spanish Crown for most of its colonial history. Only in the 18th century did a steady economic and demographic growth begin, an effect of the reforms by Spain's [[Enlightenment in Spain|Bourbon]] dynasty and a more stable situation along the frontier.\n\n==Independence (1810\u20131827)==\n{{Main|Chilean War of Independence}}\n\n[[Image:ohiggins.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Bernardo O'Higgins]].]]\nThe drive for independence from Spain was precipitated by usurpation of the Spanish throne by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]]. The Chilean War of Independence was part of the larger [[Spanish American wars of independence|Spanish American independence movement]], and it was far from having unanimous support among Chileans, who became divided between independentists and royalists. What started as an elitist political movement against their colonial master, finally ended as a full-fledged civil war between pro-Independence [[Criollo people|Criollos]] who sought political and economic independence from Spain and [[royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalist]] Criollos, who supported the continued allegiance to and permanence within the [[Spanish Empire]] of the [[Captaincy General of Chile]]. The struggle for independence was a war within the upper class, although the majority of troops on both sides consisted of conscripted mestizos and Native Americans.\n\nThe beginning of the Independence movement is traditionally dated as September 18, 1810 when a national junta was established to govern Chile in the name of the deposed king [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]]. Depending on what terms one uses to define the end, the movement extended until 1821 (when the Spanish were expelled from mainland Chile) or 1826 (when the last Spanish troops surrendered and [[Chilo\u00e9]] was incorporated to the Chilean republic). The independence process is normally divided into three stages: ''[[Patria Vieja]]'', ''[[Reconquista (Chile)|Reconquista]]'', and ''[[Patria Nueva (Chile)|Patria Nueva]]''.\n\nChile's first experiment with self-government, the \"Patria Vieja\" (''old republic'', 1810\u20131814), was led by [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]], an aristocrat then in his mid-twenties. The military-educated Carrera was a heavy-handed ruler who aroused widespread opposition. Another of the earliest advocates of full independence, [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], captained a rival faction that plunged the Criollos into civil war. For him and for certain other members of the Chilean elite, the initiative for temporary self-rule quickly escalated into a campaign for permanent independence, although other Criollos remained loyal to Spain.\n\nAmong those favoring independence, conservatives fought with liberals over the degree to which French revolutionary ideas would be incorporated into the movement. After several efforts, Spanish troops from Peru took advantage of the internecine strife to reconquer Chile in 1814, when they reasserted control by winning the [[Battle of Rancagua]] on October 12. O'Higgins, Carrera and many of the Chilean rebels escaped to Argentina.\n\nThe second period was characterized by the Spanish attempts to reimpose arbitrary rule during the period known as the ''[[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]]'' of 1814\u20131817 (\"Reconquest\": the term echoes the ''[[Reconquista]]'' in which the Christian kingdoms retook Iberia from the Muslims). During this period, the harsh rule of the Spanish loyalists, who punished suspected rebels, drove more and more Chileans into the insurrectionary camp. More members of the Chilean elite were becoming convinced of the necessity of full independence, regardless of who sat on the throne of Spain. As the leader of guerrilla raids against the Spaniards, [[Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Erdo\u00edza|Manuel Rodr\u00edguez]] became a national symbol of resistance.\n\n[[Image:Battle of Chacabuco.jpg|thumb|250px|Chilean and Argentinean troops going to the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] (February 12, 1817) led by [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]].]]\nIn exile in Argentina, O'Higgins joined forces with [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]]. Their combined army freed Chile with a daring assault over the Andes in 1817, defeating the Spaniards at the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] on February 12 and marking the beginning of the ''Patria Nueva''. San Mart\u00edn considered the liberation of Chile a strategic stepping-stone to the emancipation of Peru, which he saw as the key to hemispheric victory over the Spanish.\n\nChile won its formal independence when San Mart\u00edn defeated the last large Spanish force on Chilean soil at the [[Battle of Maip\u00fa]] on April 5, 1818. San Mart\u00edn then led his Argentine and Chilean followers north to liberate Peru; and fighting continued in Chile's southern provinces, the bastion of the royalists, until 1826.\n\nA [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] was officially issued by Chile on February 12, 1818 and formally recognized by Spain in 1840, when full diplomatic relations were established.\n\n==Republican era (1818\u20131891)==\n\n===Constitutional organization (1818\u20131833)===\n{{see also|Chilean Civil War of 1829|Chilean Constitution of 1833}}\n\n[[File:Escena Patri\u00f3tica-Rugendas.jpg|thumb|250px|Chilean patriots, by [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]].]]\n[[File:Mauricio rugendas - el malon.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Arauco War]]. The painting depicts a woman being kidnapped during a [[mal\u00f3n]].]]\nFrom 1817 to 1823, Bernardo O'Higgins ruled Chile as [[President of Chile#Supreme Directors (1814)|supreme director]]. He won plaudits for defeating royalists and founding schools, but civil strife continued. O'Higgins alienated liberals and provincials with his authoritarianism, conservatives and the church with his anticlericalism, and landowners with his proposed reforms of the land tenure system. His attempt to devise a constitution in 1818 that would legitimize his government failed, as did his effort to generate stable funding for the new administration. O'Higgins's dictatorial behavior aroused resistance in the provinces. This growing discontent was reflected in the continuing opposition of partisans of [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera|Carrera]], who was executed by the Argentine regime in Mendoza in 1821, like his two brothers were three years earlier.\n\nAlthough opposed by many liberals, O'Higgins angered the Roman Catholic Church with his liberal beliefs. He maintained Catholicism's status as the official state religion but tried to curb the church's political powers and to encourage religious tolerance as a means of attracting Protestant immigrants and traders. Like the church, the landed aristocracy felt threatened by O'Higgins, resenting his attempts to eliminate noble titles and, more important, to eliminate entailed estates.\n\nO'Higgins's opponents also disapproved of his diversion of Chilean resources to aid San Mart\u00edn's liberation of Peru. O'Higgins insisted on supporting that campaign because he realized that Chilean independence would not be secure until the Spaniards were routed from the Andean core of the empire. However, amid mounting discontent, troops from the northern and southern provinces forced O'Higgins to resign. Embittered, O'Higgins departed for Peru, where he died in 1842.\n\nAfter O'Higgins went into exile in 1823, civil conflict continued, focusing mainly on the issues of anticlericalism and regionalism. Presidents and constitutions rose and fell quickly in the 1820s. The civil struggle's harmful effects on the economy, and particularly on exports, prompted conservatives to seize national control in 1830.\n\nIn the minds of most members of the Chilean elite, the bloodshed and chaos of the late 1820s were attributable to the shortcomings of liberalism and federalism, which had been dominant over conservatism for most of the period. The political camp became divided by supporters of [[Bernardo O'Higgins|O'Higgins]], [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera|Carrera]], liberal [[Pipiolos]] and conservative [[Pelucones]], being the two last the main movements that prevailed and absorbed the rest. The abolition of slavery in 1823\u2014long before most other countries in the Americas\u2014was considered one of the Pipiolos' few lasting achievements. One Pipiolo leader from the south, [[Ram\u00f3n Freire]], rode in and out of the presidency several times (1823\u20131827, 1828, 1829, 1830) but could not sustain his authority. From May 1827 to September 1831, with the exception of brief interventions by Freire, the presidency was occupied by [[Francisco Antonio Pinto]], Freire's former vice president.\n\nIn August 1828, Pinto's first year in office, Chile abandoned its short-lived federalist system for a [[unitary state|unitary]] form of government, with separate legislative, executive, and judicial branches. By adopting a moderately liberal constitution in 1828, Pinto alienated both the federalists and the liberal factions. He also angered the old aristocracy by abolishing estates inherited by primogeniture (mayorazgo) and caused a public uproar with his [[anticlericalism]]. After the defeat of his liberal army at the Battle of Lircay on April 17, 1830, Freire, like O'Higgins, went into exile in Peru.\n\n===Conservative Era (1830\u20131861)===\n[[Image:DiegoPortales.jpg|thumb|[[Diego Portales]].|226x226px]]\nAlthough never president, [[Diego Portales]] dominated Chilean politics from the cabinet and behind the scenes from 1830 to 1837. He installed the \"autocratic republic\", which centralized authority in the national government. His political program enjoyed support from merchants, large landowners, foreign capitalists, the church, and the military. Political and economic stability reinforced each other, as Portales encouraged economic growth through free trade and put government finances in order. Portales was an agnostic who said that he believed in the clergy but not in God. He realized the importance of the Roman Catholic Church as a bastion of loyalty, legitimacy, social control and stability, as had been the case in the colonial period. He repealed Liberal reforms that had threatened church privileges and properties.\n\nThe \"Portalian State\" was institutionalized by the [[Chilean Constitution of 1833]]. One of the most durable charters ever devised in Latin America, the Portalian constitution lasted until 1925. The constitution concentrated authority in the national government, more precisely, in the hands of the president, who was elected by a tiny minority. The chief executive could serve two consecutive five-year terms and then pick a successor. Although the Congress had significant budgetary powers, it was overshadowed by the president, who appointed provincial officials. The constitution also created an independent judiciary, guaranteed inheritance of estates by primogeniture, and installed Catholicism as the state religion. In short, it established an autocratic system under a republican veneer.\n\nPortales also achieved his objectives by wielding dictatorial powers, censoring the press, and [[electoral fraud|manipulating elections]]. For the next forty years, Chile's armed forces would be distracted from meddling in politics by skirmishes and defensive operations on the [[La Frontera, Chile|southern frontier]], although some units got embroiled in domestic conflicts in [[Revolution of 1851|1851]] and 1859.\n\nThe Portalian president was General [[Joaqu\u00edn Prieto]], who served two terms (1831\u20131836, 1836\u20131841). President Prieto had four main accomplishments: implementation of the 1833 constitution, stabilization of government finances, defeat of provincial challenges to central authority, and victory over the Peru-Bolivia Confederation. During the presidencies of Prieto and his two successors, Chile modernized through the construction of ports, railroads, and telegraph lines, some built by United States entrepreneur William Wheelwright. These innovations facilitated the export-import trade as well as domestic commerce.\n\n[[File:Una chingana - Chile.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Fiestas Patrias (Chile)|Fiestas Patrias of Chile]], 1854.]]\nPrieto and his adviser, Portales, feared the efforts of Bolivian general [[Andr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz]] to unite with Peru against Chile. These qualms exacerbated animosities toward Peru dating from the colonial period, now intensified by disputes over customs duties and loans. Chile also wanted to become the dominant South American military and commercial power along the Pacific. Santa Cruz united Peru and Bolivia in the [[Peru\u2013Bolivian Confederation]] in 1836 with a desire to expand control over Argentina and Chile. Portales got Congress to declare war on the Confederation. Portales was killed by traitors in 1837. The general [[Manuel Bulnes]] defeated the Confederation in the [[Battle of Yungay]] in 1839.\n\nAfter his success Bulnes was elected president in 1841. He served two terms (1841-1846, 1846-1851). His administration concentrated on the occupation of the territory, especially the [[Strait of Magellan]] and the [[Araucan\u00eda (historic region)|Araucan\u00eda]]. The Venezuelan [[Andr\u00e9s Bello|Andres Bello]] make in this period important intellectual advances, specially the creation of the [[University of Santiago, Chile|University of Santiago]]. But political tensions, including a liberal rebellion, led to the [[1851 Chilean Revolution|Chilean Civil War of 1851]]. Finally the conservatives defeated the liberals.\n\nThe last conservative president was [[Manuel Montt]], who also served two terms (1851-1856, 1856-1861), but his bad administration led to the liberal rebellion in 1859. Liberals triumphed in 1861 with the election of [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Perez|Jose Joaquin Perez]] as president.\n\n[[File:Borders Chile 1879 and 2006.png|thumb|150px|Map showing changes of territory due to the [[War of the Pacific]].]]\n\n===Liberal era (1861\u20131891)===\nThe political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.<ref name=\"USDoS\">{{Cite web\n| url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1981.htm\n| title=Background Note: Chile\n| work=[[United States Department of State]], Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, January 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by persistently suppressing the [[Mapuche]] during the [[Occupation of the Araucan\u00eda]]. In 1881, it signed the [[Boundary Treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] confirming Chilean sovereignty over the [[Strait of Magellan]], but conceding all of oriental [[Patagonia]], and a considerable fraction of the territory it had during colonial times. As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] (1879\u20131883), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third and acquired valuable [[nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence.\n\nIn the 1870s, the church influence started to diminish slightly with the passing of several laws that took some old roles of the church into the State's hands such as the registry of births and marriages.\n\n[[Image:JoseManuelBalmaceda.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda]].]]\nIn 1886, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda]] was elected president. His economic policies visibly changed the existing liberal policies. He began to violate the [[constitution]] and slowly began to establish a dictatorship. Congress decided to depose Balmaceda, who refused to step down. [[Jorge Montt]], among others, directed an armed conflict against Balmaceda, which soon extended into the [[1891 Chilean Civil War]]. Defeated, Balmaceda fled to Argentina's embassy, where he committed suicide. Jorge Montt became the new president.\n\n==Parliamentary era (1891\u20131925)==\n{{Main|History of Chile during the Parliamentary Era (1891\u20131925)}}\n{{see also|Argentine\u2013Chilean naval arms race|South American dreadnought race}}\nThe so-called Parliamentary Republic was not a true parliamentary system, in which the chief executive is elected by the legislature. It was, however, an unusual regime in presidentialist Latin America, for Congress really did overshadow the rather ceremonial office of the president and exerted authority over the chief executive's cabinet appointees. In turn, Congress was dominated by the landed elites. This was the heyday of classic political and economic liberalism.\n\n[[File:Chile. Elecci\u00f3n Presidencial de 1915.png|thumb|250px|Picture of the 1915 presidential election in Chile.]]\nFor many decades thereafter, historians derided the Parliamentary Republic as a quarrel-prone system that merely distributed spoils and clung to its laissez-faire policy while national problems mounted.<ref name=\"country-data.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-2410.html|title=Chile - PARLIAMENTARY REPUBLIC, 1891\u20131925|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref> The characterization is epitomized by an observation made by President [[Ram\u00f3n Barros Luco]] (1910\u20131915), reputedly made in reference to labor unrest: \"There are only two kinds of problems: those that solve themselves and those that can't be solved.\"\n\nAt the mercy of Congress, cabinets came and went frequently, although there was more stability and continuity in public administration than some historians have suggested. Chile also temporarily resolved its border disputes with Argentina with the [[Puna de Atacama Lawsuit]] of 1899, the [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] and the [[1902 General Treaty of Arbitration]], though not without engaging in [[Argentine\u2013Chilean naval arms race|an expensive naval arms race]] beforehand.\n\nPolitical authority ran from local electoral bosses in the provinces through the congressional and executive branches, which reciprocated with payoffs from taxes on nitrate sales. Congressmen often won election by bribing voters in this clientelistic and corrupt system. Many politicians relied on intimidated or loyal peasant voters in the countryside, even though the population was becoming increasingly urban. The lackluster presidents and ineffectual administrations of the period did little to respond to the country's dependence on volatile nitrate exports, spiraling inflation, and massive urbanization.<ref name=\"country-data.com\"/>\n\nIn recent years, however, particularly when the authoritarian regime of Augusto Pinochet is taken into consideration, some scholars have reevaluated the Parliamentary Republic of 1891\u20131925.<ref name=\"country-data.com\"/> Without denying its shortcomings, they have lauded its democratic stability. They have also hailed its control of the armed forces, it respect for civil liberties, its expansion of suffrage and participation, and its gradual admission of new contenders, especially reformers, to the political arena. In particular, two young parties grew in importance \u2013 the Democrat Party, with roots among artisans and urban workers, and the [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]], representing urban middle sectors and provincial elites.\n\nBy the early 20th century, both parties were winning increasing numbers of seats in Congress. The more leftist members of the Democrat Party became involved in the leadership of labor unions and broke off to launch the [[Communist Party of Chile|Socialist Workers' Party]] ({{lang-es|Partido Obrero Socialista}} \u2013 POS) in 1912. The founder of the POS and its best-known leader, [[Luis Emilio Recabarren]], also founded the [[Communist Party of Chile]] ({{lang-es|Partido Comunista de Chile}} \u2013 PCCh) in 1922.\n\n==Presidential era (1925\u20131973)==\n{{Main|Presidential Republic (1925\u20131973)}}\n[[File:Alessandri Ulk (1932).jpg|thumb|[[Arturo Alessandri Palma]].|267x267px]]\nBy the 1920s, the emerging middle and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo Alessandri Palma]]. Alessandri appealed to those who believed the social question should be addressed, to those worried by the decline in nitrate exports during World War I, and to those weary of presidents dominated by Congress. Promising \"evolution to avoid revolution\", he pioneered a new campaign style of appealing directly to the masses with florid oratory and charisma. After winning a seat in the Senate representing the mining north in 1915, he earned the sobriquet \"Lion of Tarapac\u00e1.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-2412.html|title=Chile - Arturo Alessandri's Reformist Presidency, 1920\u201325|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs a dissident Liberal running for the presidency, Alessandri attracted support from the more reformist Radicals and Democrats and formed the so-called Liberal Alliance. He received strong backing from the middle and working classes as well as from the provincial elites. Students and intellectuals also rallied to his banner. At the same time, he reassured the landowners that social reforms would be limited to the cities.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAlessandri soon discovered that his efforts to lead would be blocked by the conservative Congress. Like Balmaceda, he infuriated the legislators by going over their heads to appeal to the voters in the congressional elections of 1924. His reform legislation was finally rammed through Congress under pressure from younger military officers, who were sick of the neglect of the armed forces, political infighting, social unrest, and galloping inflation, whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress.\n\nA double military coup set off a period of great political instability that lasted until 1932. First military right-wingers opposing Alessandri seized power in September 1924, and then reformers in favor of the ousted president took charge in January 1925. The ''[[Saber noise]]'' (ruido de sables) incident of September 1924, provoked by discontent of young officers, mostly lieutenants from middle and working classes, lead to the establishment of the [[September Junta]] led by General [[Luis Altamirano]] and the exile of Alessandri.\n\nHowever, fears of a conservative restoration in progressive sectors of the army led to [[1925 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|another coup in January]], which ended with the establishment of the [[January Junta]] as interim government while waiting for Alessandri's return. The latter group was led by two colonels, [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo]] and [[Marmaduke Grove]]. They returned Alessandri to the presidency that March and enacted his promised reforms by decree. The latter re-assumed power in March, and a [[Chilean Constitution of 1925|new Constitution]] encapsulating his proposed reforms was ratified in a plebiscite in September 1925.\n\nThe new constitution gave increased powers to the presidency. Alessandri broke with the [[classical liberalism]]'s policies of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' by creating a [[Chilean Central Bank|Central Bank]] and imposing a [[revenue tax]]. However, social discontents were also crushed, leading to the [[Marusia massacre]] in March 1925 followed by the [[La Coru\u00f1a massacre]].\n\nThe longest lasting of the ten governments between 1924 and 1932 was that of General Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a ''de facto'' dictatorship. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years.\n\nThe [[Seguro Obrero Massacre]] took place on September 5, 1938, in the midst of a heated three-way election campaign between the ultraconservative [[Gustavo Ross Santa Mar\u00eda]], the radical [[Popular Front (Chile)|Popular Front]]'s [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]], and the newly formed Popular Alliance candidate, [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo]]. The [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]] supported Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez's candidacy, which had been announced on September 4. In order to preempt Ross's victory, the National Socialists mounted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] that was intended to take down the rightwing government of [[Arturo Alessandri Palma]] and place Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez in power.\n\nDuring the period of [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]] dominance (1932\u20131952), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez to office for another 6 years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez in 1958.\n\nThe [[Chilean presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]] of [[Christian Democratic Party (Chile)|Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an [[absolute majority]] initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan \"Revolution in Liberty\", the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[Chilean land reform|agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had accomplished many noteworthy objectives, but he had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.\n\n===Popular Unity years===\n{{Further|Chile under Allende|Chilean nationalization of copper|United States intervention in Chile}}\n\n[[File:Allende supporters.jpg|thumb|Marchers for [[Salvador Allende]].|277x277px]]\nIn the [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|1970 presidential election]], Senator [[Salvador Allende Gossens]] won a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest. He was a [[Marxism|Marxist]] physician and member of Chile's [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]], who headed the \"[[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]]\" (UP or \"Unidad Popular\") coalition of the Socialist, Communist, Radical, and Social-Democratic Parties, along with dissident Christian Democrats, the [[Popular Unitary Action Movement]] (MAPU), and the Independent Popular Action.\n\nAllende had two main competitors in the election \u2014 [[Radomiro Tomic]], representing the incumbent Christian Democratic party, who ran a left-wing campaign with much the same theme as Allende's, and the right-wing former president [[Jorge Alessandri]]. In the end, Allende received a plurality of the votes cast, getting 36% of the vote against Alessandri's 35% and Tomic's 28%.\n\nDespite pressure from the government of the United States,<ref name=CIA>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20001113/|title=Chile: 16,000 Secret Documents Declassified|year=2000|publisher=Chile Documentation Project, The National Security Archive|location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> the [[National Congress of Chile|Chilean Congress]], keeping with tradition, conducted a runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende and former president [[Jorge Alessandri]]. This procedure had previously been a near-formality, yet became quite fraught in 1970. After assurances of legality on Allende's part, the murder of the Army Commander-in-Chief, General [[Ren\u00e9 Schneider]] and Frei's refusal to form an alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende \u2013 on the grounds that the Christian Democrats were a workers' party and could not make common cause with the oligarchs \u2013 Allende was chosen by a vote of 153 to 35.\n\nThe Popular Unity platform included the nationalization of U.S. interests in Chile's major [[copper]] mines, the advancement of workers' rights, deepening of the [[Chilean land reform]], reorganization of the national economy into socialized, mixed, and private sectors, a foreign policy of \"international solidarity\" and national independence and a new institutional order (the \"people's state\" or \"poder popular\"), including the institution of a unicameral congress. Immediately after the election, the United States expressed its disapproval and raised a number of economic sanctions against Chile.<ref name=\"CIA\"/>\n\nIn addition, the [[CIA]]'s website reports that the agency aided three different Chilean opposition groups during that time period and \"sought to instigate a coup to prevent Allende from taking office\".<ref name=\"CIA\"/> The action plans to prevent Allende from coming to power were known as Track I and [[Project FUBELT|Track II]].\n\nIn the first year of Allende's term, the short-term economic results of Economics Minister [[Pedro Vuskovic]]'s [[Vuskovic plan|expansive monetary policy]] were unambiguously favorable: 12% industrial growth and an 8.6% increase in [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], accompanied by major declines in inflation (down from 34.9% to 22.1%) and unemployment (down to 3.8%). Allende adopted measures including price freezes, wage increases, and tax reforms, which had the effect of increasing consumer spending and redistributing income downward. Joint public-private [[public works]] projects helped reduce unemployment. Much of the banking sector was [[Nationalization|nationalized]]. Many enterprises within the copper, [[coal]], [[iron]], [[nitrate]], and [[steel]] industries were [[Nationalization|expropriated]], nationalized, or subjected to state intervention. Industrial output increased sharply and [[unemployment]] fell during the administration's first year. However, these results were not sustainable and in 1972 the Chilean ''escudo'' had runaway [[inflation]] of 140%. An [[economic depression]] that had begun in 1967 peaked in 1972, exacerbated by [[capital flight]], plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and unemployment rose. The combination of inflation and government-mandated price-fixing led to the rise of [[black market]]s in rice, beans, sugar, and flour, and a \"disappearance\" of such basic commodities from supermarket shelves.<ref>[http://www.glamorama.cl/medio/articulo/0,0,38035857_178048856_151840537,00.html]</ref>\n\nRecognizing that U.S. intelligence forces were trying to destabilize his presidency through a variety of methods, the KGB offered financial assistance to the first democratically elected Marxist president.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Siegel|first1=Robert|title=The KGB in the Third World|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4948068|website=NPR.org|publisher=NPR|accessdate=October 6, 2005}}</ref> However, the reason behind the U.S. covert actions against Allende concerned not the spread of Marxism but fear over losing control of its investments. \"By 1968, 20 percent of total U.S. foreign investment was tied up in Latin America...Mining companies had invested $1 billion over the previous fifty years in Chile's copper mining industry \u2013 the largest in the world \u2013 but they had sent $7.2 billion home.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=A Draconian Cure for Chile's Economic Ills?|date=January 12, 1976|agency=BusinessWeek}}</ref> Part of the CIA's program involved a propaganda campaign that portrayed Allende as a would-be Soviet dictator.

He allowed the peso to float and reinstated restrictions on the movement of capital in and out of the country. He introduced [[Bank regulation]]s, simplified and reduced the corporate tax. Chile went ahead with privatizations, including public utilities plus the re-privatization of companies that had returned to the government during the 1982\u20131983 crisis. From 1984 to 1990, Chile's gross domestic product grew by an annual average of 5.9%, the fastest on the continent. Chile developed a good export economy, including the export of fruits and vegetables to the northern hemisphere when they were out of season, and commanded high prices.\n\nThe military junta began to change during the late 1970s. Due to problems with Pinochet, Leigh was expelled from the junta in 1978 and replaced by General [[Fernando Matthei]]. In the late 1980s, the government gradually permitted greater freedom of assembly, [[Freedom of speech|speech]], and association, to include trade union and political activity.

Pinochet tried to defend himself by referring to the [[State Immunity Act of 1978]], an argument rejected by the British justice. However, [[UK Home Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] took the responsibility to release him on medical grounds, and refused to extradite him to Spain. Thereafter, Pinochet returned to Chile in March 2000. Upon descending the plane on his wheelchair, he stood up and saluted the cheering crowd of supporters, including an army band playing his favorite military march tunes, which was awaiting him at the airport in Santiago.

Continuing the coalition's free-trade strategy, in August 2006 President Bachelet promulgated a [[free trade agreement]] with the [[People's Republic of China]] (signed under the previous administration of Ricardo Lagos), the first Chinese free-trade agreement with a Latin American nation; similar deals with Japan and India were promulgated in August 2007. In October 2006, Bachelet promulgated a multilateral trade deal with New Zealand, [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]], the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]] (P4), also signed under Lagos' presidency.

After Pinochet left power in 1988, saying this country was ready to keep going along with a [[plebiscite]], the Constitution was [[Constitutional amendment|amended]] to ease provisions for future amendments to the Constitution. In September 2005, President [[Ricardo Lagos]] signed into law several constitutional amendments passed by Congress. These include eliminating the positions of appointed senators and [[senators for life]], granting the President authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, and reducing the presidential term from six to four years while also disabling immediate [[re-election]]. The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] has rated Chile as \"[[Democracy Index#Classification definitions|flawed democracy]]\" in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex2016|title=Democracy Index 2016 - The Economist Intelligence Unit|last=solutions|first=EIU digital|website=www.eiu.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch==<!-- This section is linked from [[Chile]] -->\n{{Outdated as of | year = 2013 | month = 12 | day = 31 | last updated = December 16, 2011 }}\n{{main|National Congress of Chile}}\n[[File:Congresschile.jpg|thumb|left|[[National Congress of Chile]] in [[Valpara\u00edso]]]]\n<!--[[Image:Tuca jfuentes.jpg|thumb|250px|right|On the poster: ''[[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]] was not a saint... he murdered my father and thousands of [[Chilean people|Chileans]].''<br />Pinochet's legacy continues to be a hot subject in Chilean politics, especially since many leftist politicians, such as Tucapel Jim\u00e9nez in the picture, had their parents killed.]]-->\nThe bicameral [[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]] ''(Congreso Nacional)'' consists of the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] ''(Senado)'' and the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] ''(C\u00e1mara de Diputados).''\n\nChile's congressional elections are governed by a unique [[binomial voting system]] that rewards coalition slates. Each coalition can present two candidates for the two Senate and two lower-chamber seats apportioned to each chamber's electoral districts. Typically, the two largest coalitions split the seats in a district. Only if the leading coalition ticket outpolls the second-place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain both seats. The political parties with the largest representation in the current Chilean Congress are the centrist [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile|Christian Democrat Party]] and the conservative [[Independent Democratic Union]] ''(Uni\u00f3n Dem\u00f3crata Independiente)''. The [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]] and the small [[Humanist Party of Chile|Humanist Party]] failed to gain any seats in the 1998 elections.\n\nElections are very labor-intensive but efficient, and vote counting normally takes place the evening of the election day. One voting table, with a ballot-box each, is set up for at-most 200 names in the voting registry. Each table is manned by five people (''vocales de mesa'') from the same registry. Vocales have the duty to work as such during a cycle of elections, and can be penalized legally if they do not show up. A registered citizen can only vote after his identity has been verified at the table corresponding to his registry. Ballots are manually counted by the five vocales, after the table has closed, at least eight hours after opening, and the counting witnessed by representatives of all the parties who choose to have observers.\n\nThe Senate is made up of 38 members elected from regions or subregions. Senators serve approximately eight-year terms.\n\nThe Chamber of Deputies has 120 members, who are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The last congressional elections were held on December 11, 2006. The next congressional elections are scheduled for December 2009.\n\nThe current Senate composition is as follows: 20 seats are held by the [[Coalition of Parties for Democracy]] (CPD): Six [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrats]] (PDC), eight [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialists]] (PS), three [[Party for Democracy (Chile)|Party for Democracy]] (PPD) and three [[Social Democrat Radical Party]] (PRSD); 17 by the [[Alliance for Chile]] (APC): nine [[Independent Democratic Union]] (UDI) and eight [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] (RN); and one independent leaning right.\n\nThe current lower house&mdash;the Chamber of Deputies &mdash;contains 65 members of the governing coalition: 21 [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrats]] (PDC), 15 [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialists]] (PS), 22 [[Party for Democracy (Chile)|Party for Democracy]] (PPD) and seven [[Social Democrat Radical Party]] (PRSD); 54 from the center-right [[Alliance for Chile]](APC): 34 [[Independent Democratic Union]] (UDI) and 20 [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] (RN); and 1 from the [[Independent Regional Force]] (FRI) coalition: 1 [[Regionalist Action Party of Chile]] (PAR).\n\nSince 1987, the Congress operates in the port city of [[Valpara\u00edso]], about 110 kilometers (~70&nbsp;mi.) northwest of the capital, [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]]. However some commissions are allowed to meet in other places, especially Santiago. Congressional members have tried repeatedly to relocate the Congress back to Santiago, where it operated until the [[Chilean Coup of 1973]], but have not been successful. The last attempt was in 2000, when the project was rejected by the Constitutional Court, because it allocated funds from the national budget, which, under the Chilean Constitution, is a privilege of the President.\n\n==Legal system==\n[[file:2017 Santiago de Chile - Edificio de los Tribunales de Justicia.jpg|thumb|The [[Palacio de los Tribunales de Justicia de Santiago]].]]\nChile's legal system is [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] based. It is primarily based on the [[Civil code]] of 1855, derived from Spanish law and subsequent codes influenced by European law of the last half of the 19th Century. It does not accept compulsory ICJ jurisdiction.\n\nFrom the year 2000 onward, Chile completely overhauled its criminal justice system; a new, US-style [[adversarial system]] has been gradually implemented throughout the country with the final stage of implementation in the Santiago metropolitan region completed on June 9, 2001\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{elect|List of political parties in Chile|Elections in Chile}}\n{{see also|Chilean presidential election, 2009\u20132010|Chilean parliamentary election, 2009}}\n\n==Pressure groups==\nPressure groups according to the [[CIA World Factbook]]:\n* Student federations at all major universities\n* [[Roman Catholic Church]]\n* [[Workers' United Center of Chile]] trade unionists from Chile's five largest labor confederations.\n\n==International organization participation==\nChile or Chilean organizations participate in the following international organizations:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean]] (OPANAL)\n* [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC)\n* [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS)\n* [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO)\n* Group of 15 (G-15)\n* [[Group of 77]] (G-77)\n* [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IADB)\n* [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA)\n* International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ([[World Bank]])\n* [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO)\n* [[International Criminal Court]] (party since 2005)\n* [[International Chamber of Commerce]]\n* [[International Development Association]] (IDA)\n* [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD)\n* [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC)\n* [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRCS)\n* [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO)\n* [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO)\n* [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)\n* [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO)\n* [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]]\n* [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC)\n* [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM)\n* [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO)\n{{col-2}}\n* [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Red Cross]]\n* [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU)\n* [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC)\n* [[Latin American Economic System]] (LAES)\n* [[Latin American Integration Association]] (LAIA)\n* [[Mercosur]] (associate)\n* [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM)\n* [[Organization of American States]] (OAS)\n* [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]] (OPCW)\n* [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] (PCA)\n* [[Rio Group]]\n* [[Union of South American Nations]] (UNASUR)\n* [[United Nations]] (UN)\n** [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UN Conference on Trade & Development]] (UNCTAD)\n** [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO)\n** [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (UNHCR)\n** [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UN Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO)\n** [[United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan|UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan]] (UNMOGIP)\n** [[United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (MONUC)\n** [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|UN Truce Supervision Organization]] (UNTSO)\n* [[Universal Postal Union]] (UPU)\n* [[World Customs Organization]] (WCO)\n* [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] (WFTU)\n* [[World Health Organization]] (WHO)\n* [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO)\n* [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO)\n* [[World Tourism Organization]] (WToO)\n* [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Chilean presidential election, 2009]]\n*[[President of Chile]]\n*[[List of political parties in Chile]]\n*[[Foreign relations of Chile]]\n*[[Law of Chile]]\n*[[Human rights in Chile]]\n*[[Judiciary of Chile]]\n*[[Chilean political scandals]]\n*[[Augusto Pinochet]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.presidencia.cl/ Presidency] {{es icon}}\n* [http://www.poderjudicial.cl/ Judicial Branch] {{es icon}}\n* [http://www.congreso.cl/ National Congress] {{es icon}}\n* [http://www.gob.cl/ministros/ Ministries] {{es icon}}\n* [http://www.chileatiende.cl/ Chile Atiende -

During early colonial times there were gold exports to Per\u00fa from [[placer deposit]]s which soon depleted. Trade restrictions and monopolies established by the Spanish crown are credited for having held back economic development for much of the colonial times. As effect of these restrictions the country incorporated very few new crops and animal breeds after initial conquest. Other sectors that were held back by restrictions were the wine and mining industries. The [[Bourbon reforms]] in the 18th century eased many monopolies and trade restrictions.\n\nIn the 1830s Chile consolidated under the ideas of [[Diego Portales]] as a stable state open to foreign trade. Foreign investment in Chile grew over the 19th century. After the [[War of the Pacific]] the Chilean treasury grew by 900%. The [[League of Nations]] labeled Chile the country hardest hit by the [[Great Depression]] because 80% of government revenue came from exports of copper and nitrates, which were in low demand. After the Great Depression Chilean economic policies changed toward [[import substitution industrialization]] and the [[CORFO|Production Development Corporation]] was established.\n\nUnder the influence of the [[Chicago Boys]] the [[Pinochet regime]] made of Chile a leading country in establishing [[neoliberal]] policies. These policies allowed large corporations to consolidate their power over the Chilean economy, leading to long-term economic growth.<ref>Ricardo Ffrench-Davis, ''Economic Reforms in Chile: From Dictatorship to Democracy'', University of Michigan Press, 2002, {{ISBN|9780472112326}}, p. 7</ref>\nThe [[crisis of 1982]] caused the appointment of [[Hern\u00e1n B\u00fcchi]] as minister of finance and a sharp revision of economic policy.

It should be noted, however, that the Aylwin government departed significantly from the neoliberal doctrine of the Chicago boys, as evidenced by higher government expenditure on social programs to tackle poverty and poor quality housing.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dominguez|first1=Jorge|title=Constructing democratic governance in Latin America|date=2003|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=1421409798}}</ref> Growth in real GDP averaged 8% from 1991\u20131997,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} but fell to half that level in 1998 because of tight monetary policies (implemented to keep the current account deficit in check) and lower exports due to the Asian financial crisis.

The income tax revenue comprises different taxes. While there is a corporate income tax of 20% over profits from companies (called First Category Tax), the system is ultimately designed to tax individuals. Therefore, corporate income taxes paid constitute a credit towards two personal income taxes: the Global Complementary Tax (in the case of residents) or the Additional Tax (in the case of non-residents). The Global Complementary Tax is payable by those that have different sources of income, while those receiving income solely from dependent work are subject to the Second Category Tax. Both taxes are equally progressive in statutory terms, with a top marginal rate of 40%. Income arising from corporate activity under the Global Complementary Tax only becomes payable when effectively distributed to the individual.

Total trade registered a 31% increase over 2005. During 2006, exports of goods and services totaled US $58 billion, an increase of 41%. This figure was somewhat distorted by the skyrocketing price of copper. In 2006, copper exports reached a historical high of US $33.3 billion. Imports totaled US $35 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the previous year. Chile thus recorded a positive trade balance of US $2.3 billion in 2006.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\n[[File:Tree map export 2009 Chile.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|Graphical depiction of Chile's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]\nThe main destinations for Chilean exports were the Americas (US $39 billion), Asia (US $27.8 billion) and Europe (US $22.2 billion). Seen as shares of Chile's export markets, 42% of exports went to the Americas, 30% to Asia and 24% to Europe. Within Chile's diversified network of trade relationships, its most important partner remained the United States. Total trade with the U.S. was US $14.8 billion in 2006. Since the U.S.\u2013Chile Free Trade Agreement went into effect on January 1, 2004, U.S.\u2013Chilean trade has increased by 154%. Internal Government of Chile figures show that even when factoring out inflation and the recent high price of copper, bilateral trade between the U.S. and Chile has grown over 60% since then.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nTotal trade with Europe also grew in 2006, expanding by 42%. The Netherlands and Italy were Chile's main European trading partners. Total trade with Asia also grew significantly at nearly 31%. Trade with Korea and Japan grew significantly, but China remained Chile's most important trading partner in Asia. Chile's total trade with China reached U.S. $8.8 billion in 2006, representing nearly 66% of the value of its trade relationship with Asia.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>=\n\nThe growth of exports in 2006 was mainly caused by a strong increase in sales to the United States, the Netherlands, and Japan. These three markets alone accounted for an additional US $5.5 billion worth of Chilean exports. Chilean exports to the United States totaled US $9.3 billion, representing a 37.7% increase compared to 2005 (US $6.7 billion). Exports to the European Union were US $15.4 billion, a 63.7% increase compared to 2005 (US $9.4 billion). Exports to Asia increased from US $15.2 billion in 2005 to US $19.7 billion in 2006, a 29.9% increase.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nDuring 2006, Chile imported US $26 billion from the Americas, representing 54% of total imports, followed by Asia at 22%, and Europe at 16%. Mercosur members were the main suppliers of imports to Chile at US $9.1 billion, followed by the United States with US $5.5 billion and the European Union with US $5.2 billion. From Asia, China was the most important exporter to Chile, with goods valued at US $3.6 billion. Year-on-year growth in imports was especially strong from a number of countries \u2013 Ecuador (123.9%), Thailand (72.1%), Korea (52.6%), and China (36.9%).<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nChile's overall trade profile has traditionally been dependent upon copper exports. The state-owned firm CODELCO is the world's largest copper-producing company, with recorded copper reserves of 200 years. Chile has made an effort to expand nontraditional exports. The most important non-mineral exports are forestry and wood products, fresh fruit and processed food, fishmeal and seafood, and [[Chilean wine|wine]].<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\n====Trade agreements====\n[[File:Chile FTA.png|thumb|Nations that have an FTA with Chile appear in dark blue, those that have not ratified a negotiated FTA in light blue, and those in FTA negotiations in purple. Chile is in red.]]\nOver the last several years, Chile has signed FTAs with the European Union, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, China, and Japan. It reached a partial trade agreement with India in 2005 and began negotiations for a full-fledged FTA with India in 2006. Chile conducted trade negotiations in 2007 with Australia, Malaysia, and Thailand, as well as with China to expand an existing agreement beyond just trade in goods. Chile concluded FTA negotiations with Australia and an expanded agreement with China in 2008. The members of the P4 (Chile, Singapore, New Zealand, and Brunei) also plan to conclude a chapter on finance and investment in 2008.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nSuccessive Chilean governments have actively pursued trade-liberalizing agreements. During the 1990s, Chile signed [[free trade agreement]]s (FTA) with Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Chile also concluded preferential trade agreements with Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. An association agreement with Mercosur-Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay-went into effect in October 1996. Continuing its export-oriented development strategy, Chile completed landmark free trade agreements in 2002 with the European Union and South Korea. Chile, as a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) organization, is seeking to boost commercial ties to Asian markets. To that end, it has signed trade agreements in recent years with New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, India, China, and most recently Japan. In 2007, Chile held trade negotiations with Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, and China. In 2008, Chile hopes to conclude an FTA with Australia, and finalize an expanded agreement (covering trade in services and investment) with China. The P4 (Chile, Singapore, New Zealand, and Brunei) also plan to expand ties through adding a finance and investment chapter to the existing P4 agreement. Chile's trade talks with Malaysia and Thailand are also scheduled to continue in 2008.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nAfter two years of negotiations, the United States and Chile signed an agreement in June 2003 that will lead to completely duty-free bilateral trade within 12 years. The U.S.-Chile FTA entered into force January 1, 2004, following approval by the U.S. and Chilean congresses. The FTA has greatly expanded U.S.-Chilean trade ties, with total bilateral trade jumping by 154% during the FTA's first three years.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/> On January 1, 2014, Chile-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement officially took effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wtocenter.vn/other-agreement/vietnam-chile-free-trade-agreement-vcfta|title=Vietnam-Chile Free Trade Agreement (VCFTA) \u2013 WTO and International trade Policies|author=|date=|website=wtocenter.vn|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Issues==\nUnemployment hovered at 8\u201310% after the start of the economic slowdown in 1999, above the 7% average for the 1990s.

Due partly to the nature of the terrain and evolution in transportation systems, rail travel has suffered greatly at the hands of bus and air competition. The train usually takes longer to reach a destination than a bus, and the comfort is comparable. Prices also tend to be uncompetitive.  Rail freight transport has also suffered at the hands of the trucking industry and will continue to do so due to the immense leverage the truck driver's union can bring to bear if they were to feel threatened.\n\nThe [[Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia]] is a metre gauge railway in the north of the country.  It was originally constructed in {{RailGauge|2ft6in}} gauge.\n\nThe northern rail line out of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] is now disused past the intersection with the [[Valpara\u00edso]] line. Until there it is used nearly exclusively for freight. Although the rest of the northern line is still in place, it is in a state of serious disrepair.\n\nThe southern line runs as far as [[Puerto Montt]] and is electrified as far as the city of [[Temuco]], from where diesel locomotives are used.  Due to lack of budget and care, the 389&nbsp;km Temuco to Puerto Montt section was abandoned in 1992 but after a $44m upgrade it has been back in use since 6 December 2005 with daily service between Victoria (north of Temuco) and Puerto Montt; today, however only the service between Victoria and Temuco still operates.<ref>{{cite news | title=Passengers return to Puerto Montt | publisher = ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'' | date=2006-01-01 | url = http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//passengers-return-to-puerto-montt.html}}</ref>\n\nWork to build/restore(?) the [[Trans-Andean Railways|South Trans-Andean Railway]] link between [[Zapala]], Argentina and [[Lonquimay]], Chile was underway in 2005.<ref>[[International Railway Journal|IRJ]] March 2005</ref> Possible [[break-of-gauge]].

Barros succeeded in his mission: Argentina was granted east Patagonia and Chile the Strait of Magellan.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHowever, border disputes continued. In 1902, war was again avoided when British King [[Edward VII]] agreed to mediate between the two nations. He established the current border in the Patagonia region.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Beagle conflict]] began to brew in the 1960s, when Argentina began to claim that the [[Beagle Channel cartography since 1881|Picton, Lennox and Nueva]] islands in the [[Beagle Channel]] were rightfully hers. In 1971 Chile and Argentina signed an agreement formally submitting the Beagle Channel issue to binding [[Beagle Channel Arbitration]]. On May 2, 1977 the court ruled that the islands and all adjacent formations belonged to Chile. See the [http://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXI/53-264.pdf Report and decision of the Court of Arbitration].\n\nOn 25 January 1978, the Argentina military junta led by General [[Jorge Videla]] declared the award fundamentally null and intensified their claim over the islands.

In order to achieve a victory, certain objectives had to be reached before the seventh day after the attack. Some military leaders considered this not enough time due to the difficulty involved in transportation through the passes over the Andean Mountains.''\nand in cite 46:\n: ''According to Clar\u00edn, two consequences were feared. First, those who were dubious feared a possible regionalization of the conflict. Second, as a consequence, the conflict could acquire great power proportions. In the first case decisionmakers speculated that Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Brazil might intervene. Then the great powers could take sides. In this case, the resolution of the conflict would depend not on the combatants, but on the countries that supplied the weapons.''\n\nIn December that year, moments before Videla signed a declaration of war against Chile, [[Pope John Paul II]] agreed to mediate between the two nations. The Pope's envoy, [[Antonio Samor\u00e8]], successfully averted war and proposed a new definitive boundary in which the three disputed islands would remain Chilean.  Chile immediately accepted this decision, but Argentina still disliked and avoided acceptance until after the lost [[Falklands War]] in 1982. Both agreed to Samor\u00e9's proposal and signed the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]], ending that dispute.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/CHL-ARG1984PF.PDF|title=Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Chile and Argentina (with annexes and maps),29 November 1984|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, under presidents [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle|Frei]] and [[Carlos Menem|Menem]] both countries solved almost all of the remaining border disputes during bilateral talks.

The Spaniards never bothered to definitely establish a border between Chile and Bolivia. Chile claimed its limit with Peru ran through the Loa River and that Bolivia was therefore landlocked, while Bolivia claimed it did have a coast and that the limit with Chile ran along the Salado River. The border remained vague throughout the 19th century. Finally, Bolivia and Chile agreed, in 1866, to allow Bolivia access to the Pacific and that the limit of the two countries would run along the 24th parallel. The area between the 25th and 23rd parallel would remain demilitarized and both nations would be allowed to mine there.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Boundary_Treaty_between_Bolivia_and_Chile_of_1866|title=Boundary Treaty between Bolivia and Chile of 1866}}</ref> It was also agreed that taxes on the exportation of [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]] would not increase.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nHowever, in 1879, Bolivian dictator General [[Hilari\u00f3n Daza]] increased the taxes on the exportation of saltpeter, violating the 1866 treaty. When Chilean-owned saltpeter companies protested, Daza expropriated their companies and sold them in a [[public auction]]. Daza then put an end to all commerce with Chile and exiled all Chilean residents in Bolivia (the Bolivian port of [[Antofagasta]] had more Chileans than Bolivians). In response, Chile declared war on Bolivia and occupied Bolivia's coast. Peru had, in 1873, signed a secret pact with Bolivia in which the two countries agreed to fight together against any nation that threatened either of them. When Peru refused to be neutral in the conflict between Chile and Bolivia, Chile declared war on Peru. Chile defeated both countries and annexed the coast claimed by Bolivia. This was ratified in a 1904 treaty.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1905-01-01|title=Chile|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=div&did=FRUS.FRUS1905.i0011&isize=text|journal=Foreign relations of the United States}}</ref>\n\nDiplomatic relations with Bolivia continued to be strained because of Bolivia's continuing aspiration to the sea.  In 1964, Bolivian President [[V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro]] severed diplomatic relations with Chile.  Generals [[Augusto Pinochet]] and [[Hugo Banzer]] resumed diplomatic relations and attempted to settle territorial disputes.  The secret negotiations started in 1973 and in 1975 diplomatic relations between Chile and Bolivia were established.  That year, both dictators met in the Bolivian border town of Chara\u00f1a. Pinochet agreed to give Bolivia a small strip of land running between the Chilean city of [[Arica]] and the [[Peru]]vian border.  However the Treaty of Lima between Peru and Chile specified that Chile must consult Peru before granting any land to a third party in the area of [[Tarapac\u00e1 Region|Tarapac\u00e1]].  Peruvian dictator General  [[Francisco Morales Berm\u00fadez]] did not agree with the Chara\u00f1a proposal and instead drafted his own proposal, in which the three nations would share administration of the port of Arica and the sea immediately in front of it.  Pinochet refused this agreement, and Banzer broke ties with Chile again in 1978.  The failure of the Chara\u00f1a accords was one of the reasons of Banzer's downfall that very year.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nChile and Bolivia maintain consular relations, and appear to have become friendlier.

Chile and Peru participated in a common conflict against Spain, the [[Chincha Islands War]] (1864\u20131866), despite their causes for war with Spain where different. Despite the Chilean port of [[Valpara\u00edso]] was bombed and mostly destroyed by Spain during the conflict, the combined Peru-Chile fleet managed to defend Chilean territory near Abtao, and the Peruvian defenders of Callao managed to drive back the Spanish attack. In 1873, Peru signed a secret defensive pact with Bolivia in which it agreed to help that nation in case of foreign attack. The moment came in 1879, when Chile declared war on Bolivia. Peru refused to null its defensive pact with Bolivia, and Chile declared war on Peru. The [[War of the Pacific]], as the conflict was called, resulted in a decisive victory for Chile, which managed to reach Lima and occupied Peru for a few years.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nIn 1883, Chile and Peru signed the Treaty of Anc\u00f3n in which Peru handed over the Province of [[Tarapac\u00e1 Province (Peru)|Tarapac\u00e1]]. Peru also had to hand over the departments of [[Arica]] and [[Tacna]]. These would remain under Chilean control until a later date, when there would be a plebiscite to decide which nation would maintain control over Arica and Tacna. Chile and Peru, however, were unable to agree on how or when to hold the plebiscite, and in 1929, both countries signed the Treaty of Lima, in which Peru gained Tacna and Chile maintained control of Arica.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nRelations have remained sour because of the war. In 1975, both countries were at the brink of war, only a few years before the centennial of the War of the Pacific. The conflict was fueled by ideological disputes: Peruvian General [[Juan Velasco]] was a left-winger while Chilean General [[Augusto Pinochet]] was a right-winger. Velasco,  backed by [[Cuba]], set the date for invasion on August 6, the 150th independence anniversary of Bolivia, and the proposed date when Chile intended to grant this country with a sovereign corridor north of Arica, in former Peruvian territory, transfer not approved by Peru. However, he was successfully dissuaded from starting the invasion on that date by his advisor, General [[Francisco Morales Berm\u00fadez]], whose original family was from the former Peruvian (currently Chilean) region of Tarapac\u00e1. Velasco later fell ill and was deposed by a group of generals who proclaimed Morales Berm\u00fadez president on August 28.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nMorales Berm\u00fadez assured the Chilean government that Peru had no plans for an invasion despite its tremendous military superiority.  Tensions mounted again when a Chilean spy mission in Peru was discovered. Morales Berm\u00fadez was again able to avert war, despite pressure from Velasco's ultranationalist followers.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nRelations between the two nations have since mostly recovered.  In 2005, the Peruvian Congress unilaterally approved a new law which stated the sea limit with Chile.  Peru's position was that the border has never been fully demarcated, but Chile disagreed reminding on treaties in 1952 and 1954 between the countries, which supposedly defined seaborder. The border problem has still not been solved. However, former Chilean president [[Michelle Bachelet]] and Peru's [[Alan Garc\u00eda]] established a positive diplomatic relationship, and it is very unlikely any hostilities will break out because of the dispute.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nNevertheless, in early April 2007, Peruvian nationalistic sectors, mainly represented by left wing ex-presidential candidate [[Ollanta Humala]] decided to congregate at 'hito uno' right at the border with Chile, in a symbolic attempt to claim sovereignty over a maritime area known in Peru as [[Mar de Grau]] (Grau's Sea) just west of the Chilean city of [[Arica]]. Peruvian police stopped a group of nearly 2,000 people just ten kilometers from the border, preventing them from reaching their intended destination. Despite these incidents, the presidents of both Chile and Peru have confirmed their intentions to improve the relationships between the two countries, mainly fueled by the huge amount of commercial exchange between both countries private sectors.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|United States}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Chile\u2013United States relations]]\n\n[[File:Michelle Bachelet & Barack Obama 2014.jpg|thumb|Bachelet with U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], 30 June 2014]]\nChile-United States relations have been better in the period 1988 to the present than any other time in history.

The song has a history of two lyrics and two melodies that made up three different versions. The current version was composed by [[Ram\u00f3n Carnicer]], with words by Eusebio Lillo, and has six parts plus the chorus.\n\n== First national anthem ==\nThe first Chilean National Anthem dates back to 1819, when the government called for, on the 19th of July, the creation of music and lyrics for this purpose.\n\nThe composer Manuel Robles and the poet Bernardo de Vera y Pintado fulfilled this mandate and their \"National Song\" debuted on 20 August 1820 in the Domingo Arteaga theater, although other historians claim that it was played and sung during the festivities of September 1819.\n\nIn the beginning, everyone would stand for the song. The custom of always singing it at the theater slowly disappeared, until it was requested that it only be sung at the anniversary of the country.\n\nThe doctor Bernardo Vera, known in the history of the independence, was the author of the verses that were sung to Robles' music.\n\nThis first hymn was sung until 1828,<ref>[http://www.nationalanthems.info/cl-47.htm first hymn original lyric 1819-1847]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5fkM1Ov-8 first original hymn Full lyric 1819-1847]</ref> when it was replaced with what is sung today.\n\n== Second national anthem ==\n[[File:Himno Nacional de Chile en Fa mayor Piano.png|thumb|450px|\"National Anthem of Chile\", opening piano.]]\nThe second Chilean National Anthem was composed by the Spanish composer Ram\u00f3n Carnicer, when he was exiled in England because of his liberal ideas. Mariano Ega\u00f1a, Chilean Minister in London, acting on the criticism that Robles' song was receiving, asked Carnicer to compose a new hymn with Bernardo de Vera's original text.\n\nThe Spanish musician probably wrote the work by 1827, the date he returned to Barcelona, and his hymn debuted in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], in the Arteaga theater, 23 December 1828.\n\nYears later, in 1847, the Chilean government entrusted the young poet Eusebio Lillo with a new text that would replace the anti-Spain poem of Vera y Pintado, and after being analyzed by [[Andr\u00e9s Bello]], retained the original chorus (\"''Dulce patria, recibe los votos...''\"). The lyrics were slightly revised in 1909.\n\nDuring the military government (1973\u20131990) of [[Augusto Pinochet]], the Verse III was officially incorporated because of his praise of the armed forces and the national police (Carabiners). After the end of Pinochet's regime, in 1990, it was only sung in military events. Supporters from the former military regime also sing the anthem with the Verse III in private ceremonies and rallies.\n\nIn the celebrations marking the return of democracy in March 1990 at Santiago's [[Estadio Nacional Julio Mart\u00ednez Pr\u00e1danos]], the anthem was played in its present melody, raised to F Major (the Royal Musical Official Version of the anthem) which is the original melody of the second anthem by Carnicer, but using the 1847 lyrics as text, save for the original chorus of the 1819 anthem. This was the version that from 1991 to 2013 was played during [[sign-on]] and [[sign-off]] broadcasts of Chilean television stations. Now the anthem is played in C Major during sign-on and sign-off.\n\n[[Joe Walsh]], famed musician who was part of the United States rock band the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], sang the National Anthem of Chile at a Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim baseball game in 2003.\n\n== Official version lyrics ==\n{{Listen\n |filename     = National_Anthem_of_Chile.ogg\n |title        = Vocal choir version\n |filename2    =\n |title2       = Instrumental version \n}}\nBelow are the lyrics of the most played version; it corresponds to Verse V of the full version and the chorus:\n{|\n!Spanish original\n!Translation\n|-\n|width=50%|\nPuro, Chile, es tu cielo azulado.<br />\nPuras brisas te cruzan tambi\u00e9n.<br />\nY tu campo de flores bordado<br />\nEs la copia feliz del Ed\u00e9n.<br />\nMajestuosa es la blanca monta\u00f1a<br />\nQue te dio por baluarte el Se\u00f1or<br />\nQue te dio por baluarte el Se\u00f1or,<br />\nY ese mar que tranquilo te ba\u00f1a<br />\nTe promete futuro esplendor<br />\nY ese mar que tranquilo te ba\u00f1a<br />\nTe promete futuro esplendor.\n\n'''Coro'''<br />\nDulce Patria, recibe los votos<br />\nCon que Chile en tus aras jur\u00f3:<br />\nQue o la tumba ser\u00e1s de los libres<br />\nO el asilo contra la opresi\u00f3n<br />\nQue o la tumba ser\u00e1s de los libres<br />\nO el asilo contra la opresi\u00f3n<br />\nQue o la tumba ser\u00e1s de los libres<br />\nO el asilo contra la opresi\u00f3n<br />\nO el asilo contra la opresi\u00f3n<br />\nO el asilo contra la opresi\u00f3n.\n|width=50%|\nHow pure, [[Chile]], is your blue sky<br />\nAnd how pure the breezes that blow across you<br />\nAnd your countryside embroidered with flowers<br />\nIs a wonderful copy of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]<br />\nHow majestic are the [[Andes|snow-covered mountains]]<br />\nThat were given to you by [[God]] as protection<br />\nThat were given to you by God as protection<br />\nAnd [[Pacific Ocean|the sea]] that tranquilly bathes your shores<br />\nPromises a splendor future for you<br />\nAnd the sea that tranquilly bathes your shores<br />\nPromises a splendor future for you.<br />\n'''Chorus'''<br />\n[[Chile|Beloved Homeland]], receive the vows<br />\nThat Chile gave you on your altars<br />\nThat you be either the tomb of the free<br />\nOr a refuge from [[Captaincy General of Chile|oppression]]<br />\nThat you be either the tomb of the free<br />\nOr a refuge from oppression<br />\nThat you be either the tomb of the free<br />\nOr a refuge from oppression<br />\nOr a refuge from oppression<br />\nOr a refuge from oppression<br />\n|}\n\n'''Full National Anthem''' According to Chilean Constitution (Only Verse V and the chorus are played officially as the National Anthem [decree 260])\n\n{|class=\"toccolours\" cellpadding=\"10\" align=center rules=\"cols\"\n!colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"coral\" | Himno Nacional de Chile\n|-\n!Spanish !!

It has an area of {{convert|135|km2|sqmi}}.\n\nChristmas Island had a population of 1,843 residents {{as of|2016|lc=y}},<ref name=Census2016/> the majority of whom live in settlements on the northern tip of the island. The main settlement is [[Flying Fish Cove]]. Around two-thirds of the island's population is estimated to have [[Malaysian Chinese]] origin (though just 21.2% of the population declared a Chinese ancestry in 2016<ref name=Census2016/>), with significant numbers of [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] and [[European Australian]]s as well as smaller numbers of [[Malaysian Indian]]s and [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]]. Several languages are in use, including [[English language|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], and various Chinese dialects. [[Islam]] and [[Buddhism]] are major religions on the island, though a vast majority of the population does not declare a formal religious affiliation and may be involved in ethnic [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religion]].\n\nThe first European to sight the island was Richard Rowe of the ''Thomas'' in 1615.

The main languages of Christmas Island are English and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. Dress is usually modest, and tourists should keep a wrap, such as a [[sarong]] or [[pareo]], on hand to cover shorts, bathing suits, and tank tops. It is common to remove shoes when entering a house and to also avoid touching anyone's head.\n\nReligious beliefs are diverse, but people are very tolerant of each other's religions. The religions practised include [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]], Islam, and Christianity. There is a Mosque in Flying Fish Cove.

There are many rare species of animals and plants on the island, making nature-walking a popular activity. Along with the diversity of species, many different types of caves exist, such as plateau caves, coastal caves, raised coastal caves and alcoves, sea caves, fissure caves, collapse caves and basalt caves; most of these are near the sea and have been formed by the action of water. Altogether, there are approximately 30 caves on the island,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The History of Christmas Island and the Management of its Karst Features|last=Meek|first=Paul D.|journal=Helictite|volume=37|issue=2|pages=31\u201336|url=http://helictite.caves.org.au/pdf1/37.2.Meek.pdf|access-date=17 January 2018}}</ref> with Lost Lake Cave, Daniel Roux Cave and Full Frontal Cave being the most well-known. The many freshwater springs include Hosnies Spring Ramsar, which also has a mangrove stand.\n\nThe Dales is a [[rainforest]] in the western part of the island and consists of seven deep valleys, all of which were formed by spring streams. Hugh's Dale waterfall is part of this area and is a popular attraction. The annual breeding migration of the [[Christmas Island red crab]]s is a popular event.\n\nFishing is another common activity. There are many distinctive species of fish in the oceans surrounding Christmas Island. Snorkeling and swimming in the ocean are two other activities that are extremely popular. Walking trails are also very popular, for there are many beautiful trails surrounded by extravagant [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. 63% of the island is [[Christmas Island National Park|national park]] making it one of the main attractions to experience when visiting.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n{{See also|Birds of Christmas Island|List of mammals of Christmas Island}}\n[[File:Cococrb2.jpg|thumb|[[Coconut crab|Robber Crab (Coconut crab)]]]]\n[[File:Christmas Island (5775069028).jpg|thumb|right|[[Christmas Island red crab]]]]\n[[File:Red-footed booby.jpg|thumb|right|[[Red-footed booby|Red-footed boobies]]]]\n[[File:Anous stolidus nesting cropped.JPG|thumb|[[Common noddy]]]]\n[[File:Brown booby.jpg|thumb|[[Brown booby]]]]\n\nChristmas Island was uninhabited until the late 19th century, allowing many species to evolve without human interference. Two-thirds of the island has been declared a [[National Park]], which is managed by the Australian Department of Environment and Heritage through Parks Australia. Christmas Island has always been known for its unique species, both of flora and fauna.\n\n===Flora===\nThe dense [[rainforest]] has grown in the deep soils of the [[plateau]] and on the terraces. The forests are dominated by 25 tree species. [[Fern]]s, [[orchid]]s and [[vine]]s grow on the branches in the humid atmosphere beneath the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]]. The 135 plant species include at least 18 that are found nowhere else. The rainforest is in great condition despite the mining activities over the last 100 years. Areas that have been damaged by [[mining]] are now a part of an ongoing rehabilitation project. The island is small and covers 135 square kilometres of land which 63% of that land has been declared [[National park|National Park]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Essential Christmas Island Travel Guide|last=Tierney|first=Beth|publisher=Christmas Island Tourism Association|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nChristmas Island's [[endemism|endemic]] plants include the trees ''[[Arenga listeri]]'', ''[[Pandanus elatus]]'' and ''[[Dendrocnide peltata]]'' var.

The [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] [[Christmas Island shrew]] has not been seen since the mid-1980s and may be already extinct, while the [[Christmas Island pipistrelle]] (a small bat) is critically endangered and probably also extinct.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://environment.gov.au/parks/index.html |title=Parks Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe Christmas Island [[flying fox]] (fruit bat), an important pollinator and rainforest seed-disperser, is also in decline and under increasing pressure from land clearing and introduced pest species. The flying fox's low rate of reproduction (one pup each year) and high infant mortality rate makes it especially vulnerable. Flying foxes are an `umbrella` species helping forests regenerate and other species survive in stressed environments.\n\nThe land crabs and seabirds are the most noticeable fauna on the island. Christmas Island has been identified by [[BirdLife International]] as both an [[Endemic Bird Area]] and an [[Important Bird Area]] because it supports five endemic species and five subspecies as well as over one percent of the world populations of five other seabirds.<ref>BirdLife International.

Once at the ocean, the mothers release the embryos where they can survive and grow until they are able to live on land.\n\nThe island is a focal point for seabirds of various species. Eight species or [[subspecies]] of seabirds nest on it. The most numerous is the [[red-footed booby]], which nests in colonies, using trees on many parts of the shore terrace. The widespread [[brown booby]] nests on the ground near the edge of the seacliff and inland cliffs. [[Abbott's booby]] (listed as [[endangered]]) nests on tall emergent trees of the western, northern and southern plateau rainforest, the only remaining nesting habitat for this bird in the world.\n\nAnother endangered and endemic bird, the [[Christmas frigatebird]], has nesting areas on the northeastern shore terraces. The more widespread [[great frigatebird]]s nest in semi-[[deciduous]] trees on the shore terrace, with the greatest concentrations being in the North West and South Point areas. The [[common noddy]] and two species of bosun or [[tropicbird]]s, with their brilliant gold or silver plumage and distinctive streamer tail feathers, also nest on the island.\n\nOf the ten native land birds and shorebirds, seven are endemic species or subspecies. This includes the [[Christmas thrush]] and the [[Christmas imperial pigeon]]. Some 86 migrant bird species have been recorded as visitors to the island.\n\nSix species of [[butterfly]] are known to occur on Christmas Island. These are the Christmas swallowtail (''[[Papilio memnon]]''), striped albatross (''[[Appias olferna]]''), Christmas emperor (''[[Polyura andrewsi]]''), king cerulean (''[[Jamides bochus]]''), lesser grass-blue (''[[Zizina otis]]''), and Papuan grass-yellow (''[[Eurema blanda]]'').<ref name=butterflies>{{cite book|last=Braby|first=Michael F.|title=The Complete Field Guide to Butterflies of Australia|year=2008|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|isbn=0 643 09027 4}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\nChristmas Island has access to a range of modern communication services.\n\nRadio broadcasts from Australia include [[Radio National|ABC Radio National]], [[ABC Kimberley]], [[Triple J]] and [[Red FM (Australia)|Red&nbsp;FM]]. All services are provided by satellite links from the mainland. [[Broadband internet]] became available to subscribers in urban areas in mid-2005 through the local internet service provider, [[Christmas Island Internet Administration|CIIA]] (formerly&nbsp;dotCX).\n\nChristmas Island, due to its close proximity to Australia's northern neighbours, falls within many of the satellite footprints throughout the region. This results in ideal conditions for receiving various Asian broadcasts, which locals sometimes prefer to those emanating from Western Australia. Additionally, ionospheric conditions are conducive to terrestrial radio transmissions, from [[High frequency|HF]] through [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and sometimes into [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]. The island plays home to a small array of radio equipment that spans a good chunk of the usable spectrum. A&nbsp;variety of government owned and operated antenna systems are employed on the island to take advantage of this.\n\n===Television===\nFree-to-air digital television stations from Australia are broadcast in the same time zone as Perth, and are broadcast from three separate locations:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was closed in December 1987, when the Australian government closed the mine, and since has been recovered as scrap, leaving only earthworks in places.\n\n[[Virgin Australia Regional Airlines]] provides two weekly flights to [[Christmas Island Airport]] from Perth, Western Australia, [[Garuda Indonesia]] conduct weekly open-charter flights from/to Jakarta with bookings done through Christmas Island Travel Exchange and [[Malindo Air]] operate fortnightly open-charter flights from/to Kuala Lumpur with bookings done through Evercrown Air Services.\n\nHire cars are available from the airport however no franchised companies are represented. CI Taxi Service also operates most days.\n\nThe road network covers most of the island and is of generally good quality, although four-wheel drive vehicles are needed to reach some of the more distant parts of the rainforest or the more isolated beaches on the rough dirt roads.\n\n==Education==\nThe island-operated [[Day care|cr\u00e8che]] is in the Recreation Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shire.gov.cx/Recreation_Centre/crechemain.html |title=Recreation Centre |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915191041/http://shire.gov.cx///Recreation_Centre/crechemain.html |archivedate=15 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> [[Christmas Island District High School]], catering to students in grades [[K-12#P\u201312|P-12]], is run by the [[Western Australian Education Department]].

This was eventually ruled out due to the hostile climate and remote location. The French explored reopening the lagoon and developing a harbour for trade and tourism during the 1970s but this idea was abandoned. An automatic weather installation was completed on 7 April 1980, with data collected by this station being transmitted by satellite to [[Brittany]].\n\nIn 1981, the [[Academy of Sciences for Overseas Territories]] recommended that the island have its own economic infrastructure, with an airstrip and a fishing port in the [[lagoon]]. This would mean opening up the lagoon by creating a passage in the atoll rim. For this purpose, an agreement was signed with the French government, represented by the High Commissioner for French Polynesia, whereby the island became French state property. In 1986 a meeting took place regarding the establishment of a permanent base for fishing, between the High Commissioner and the survey firm for the development and exploitation of the island (SEDEIC). Taking into account the economic constraints, the distance from markets, and the small size of the atoll, nothing apart from preliminary studies was undertaken. All plans for development were abandoned.\n\n===Castaways===\nIn early 1962 the island provided a home to nine crewmen of the sunken tuna clipper MV ''Monarch'', stranded for 23 days from 6 February to 1 March. They reported that the lagoon water was drinkable, though they preferred to drink water from the coconuts they found. Unable to use any of the dilapidated buildings, they constructed a crude shelter from cement bags and tin salvaged from [[Quonset hut]]s built by the American military 20 years earlier. Wood from the huts was used for firewood, and fish caught off the fringing reef combined with some potatoes and onions they had saved from their sinking vessel to augment the meagre supply of coconuts. The crewmen reported that they tried eating bird's eggs, but found them to be rancid, and they decided after trying to cook a \"little black bird\" that it did not have enough meat to make the effort worthwhile. Pigs had been eradicated, though the crewmen reported seeing their skeletons around the atoll. The crewmen were eventually discovered by another fishing boat and rescued by the United States Navy destroyer [[USS Robison (DDG-12)|USS ''Robison'']].<ref name=No94/>\n\nIn 1988, five Mexican fishermen became lost at sea after a storm during their trip along the coast of [[Costa Rica]].

All 19 crew members were reported safe, and the vessel reported no leaks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://diver.net/bbs/posts002/81342.shtml |title=Re: Probe into Sichem Osprey grounding |website=Diver.net |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Xylene Tanker Runs Aground on Clipperton Island |url=http://reeftools.com/news/xylene-tanker-runs-aground-on-clipperton-island/ |website=Reeftools |date=2010-02-22 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> The vessel was refloated on March 6<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lloydslist.maritimeintelligence.informa.com/LL105629/Eitzen-tanker-Sichem-Osprey-refloated |title=Eitzen tanker Sichem Osprey refloated |publisher=Lloydslist.com |date=2010-03-08 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> and returned to service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?MMSI=249534000 |title=Sichem Osprey |website=MarineTraffic |date=2012-06-13 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-March 2012, the crew from The Clipperton Project <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clippertonproject.com/plastic-surveying-and-collection/ |website=The Clipperton Project |date=2012-03-12 |title=Plastic Surveying and Collection |accessdate=2012-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502053953/http://www.clippertonproject.com/plastic-surveying-and-collection/ |archivedate=2012-05-02}}</ref> noted the widespread presence of refuse, particularly on the northeast shore and around the Rock. Debris including plastic bottles and containers create a potentially harmful environment to its flora and fauna. This trash is common to only two beaches (North East and South West) and the rest of the island is fairly clean. Other refuse has been left over after the occupation by the Americans in 1944\u201345, the French in 1966\u201369 and the 2008 scientific expedition.\n\n===Amateur radio DX-peditions===\nThe island has long been an attractive destination for amateur radio groups, due to its remoteness, difficulty of landing, permit requirements, romantic history, and interesting environment. While some radio operation was done ancillary to other expeditions, major DX-peditions include FO0XB (1978), FO0XX (1985), FO0CI (1992), FO0AAA (2000), and TX5C (2008).\n\nOne [[DX-pedition]] was the Cordell Expedition in March 2013 using the callsign TX5K,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tx5k.org |title=Clipperton Island \u2014 The 2013 Cordell Expedition |website=TX5K.org}}</ref> organized and led by [[Robert Schmieder]]. The project combined radio operations with selected scientific investigations. The team of 24 radio operators made more than 114,000 contacts, breaking the previous record of 75,000. The activity included extensive operation on 6 metres, including EME ([[Earth\u2013Moon\u2013Earth communication]] or 'moonbounce') contacts. A notable accomplishment was the use of DXA, a real-time satellite-based online graphic radio log web page that allowed anyone anywhere with a browser to see the radio activity. Scientific work carried out during the expedition included the first collection and identification of [[foraminifera]], and extensive aerial imaging of the island using kite-borne cameras. The team included two scientists from the French-Polynesian [[University of Tahiti]] and a TV crew from the French documentary television series [[Thalassa (TV series)|THALASSA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cordell.org/CI/CI_Documents/TX5K_Project_Report_1.0.pdf |title=Report of the Expedition Leader \u2014 The 2013 Cordell Expedition to Clipperton Island |author=Robert W.

It is part of [[Southeast Asia]] and is in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].  The territory's [[Dual naming|dual name]] (official since the islands\u2019 incorporation into Australia in 1955) reflects that the islands have historically been known as either the '''Cocos Islands''' or the '''Keeling Islands'''.\n\nThe territory consists of two [[atoll]]s made up of 27 [[coral island]]s, of which only two \u2013 [[West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|West Island]] and [[Home Island]] \u2013 are inhabited. The population of around 600 people consists mainly of [[Cocos Malays]], who practise [[Sunni Islam]] and speak [[Cocos Malay|a dialect of Malay]] as their first language. The territory is administered by the Australian federal government's [[Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities]], and together with [[Christmas Island]] forms the [[Australian Indian Ocean Territories]] administrative unit. However, the islanders do have a degree of self-government through [[Shire of Cocos|the local shire council]]. Many public services \u2013 including health, education, and policing \u2013 are provided by the state of [[Western Australia]], and Western Australian law applies except where the federal government has determined otherwise.\n\nThe islands were first discovered in 1609 by [[William Keeling]], but no settlement occurred until the early 19th century. One of the first settlers was John Clunies-Ross, a Scottish merchant; much of the island's current population is descended from the Malay workers he brought in to work his [[copra]] plantation. The [[Clunies-Ross family]] ruled the islands as a private fiefdom for almost 150 years, with the head of the family usually recognised as [[resident magistrate]].  The British formally annexed the islands in 1857, and for the next century they were officially administered from either [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] or [[Colony of Singapore|Singapore]]. The territory was transferred to Australia in 1955, although until 1979 virtually all of the island's [[real estate]] still belonged to the Clunies-Ross family.\n\n==Name==\nThe islands have been called the ''Cocos Islands'' (from 1622), the ''Keeling Islands'' (from 1703), the ''Cocos\u2013Keeling Islands'' (since [[James Horsburgh]] in 1805) and the ''Keeling\u2013Cocos Islands'' (19th century).<ref name=\"arb399p1t2\">{{cite book|last1=Woodroffe|first1=C.D.|last2=Berry|first2=P.F. |title=Scientific Studies in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands: An Introduction|url=https://archive.org/stream/atollresearchbu399425smit#page/n14|series=Atoll Research Bulletin|volume=399|date=February 1994|publisher=National Museum of Natural History |location=Washington DC|pages=1\u20132}}</ref> ''Cocos'' refers to the abundant [[coconut]] trees, while ''Keeling'' is [[William Keeling]], who discovered the islands in 1609.<ref name=\"arb399p1t2\" />  \n\nJohn Clunies-Ross,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Dynasties: Clunies-Ross|url = http://www.abc.net.au/dynasties/txt/s1227294.htm|website = www.abc.net.au|accessdate = 2016-01-06}}</ref> who sailed there in the ''Borneo'' in 1825, called the group the ''Borneo Coral Isles'',  restricting ''Keeling'' to [[North Keeling]], and calling South Keeling \"the Cocos properly so called\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Horsburgh|first=James |authorlink=James Horsburgh|title=The India directory, or, Directions for sailing to and from the East Indies, China, Australia, and the interjacent ports of Africa and South America: comp. chiefly from original journals of the honourable company's ships, and from observations and remarks, resulting from the experience of twenty-one years in the navigation of those seas|chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/indiadirectoryor01hors#page/142/mode/2up|edition=5th|volume=Vol.1|year=1841|publisher=W.H.

The climate is pleasant, moderated by the southeast [[trade winds]] for about nine months of the year and with moderate rainfall. [[Tropical cyclone]]s may occur in the early months of the year.\n\n'''[[North Keeling]] Island''' is an atoll consisting of just one C-shaped island, a nearly closed atoll ring with a small opening into the lagoon, about {{convert|50|m|ft}} wide, on the east side. The island measures {{convert|1.1|km2|acre}} in land area and is uninhabited. The lagoon is about {{convert|0.5|km2|acre}}.

A landing party from the German cruiser {{SMS|Emden|1906|6}} captured and disabled the wireless and cable communications station on [[Direction Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Direction Island]], but not before the station was able to transmit a distress call. An Allied troop convoy was passing nearby, and the Australian cruiser {{HMAS|Sydney|1912|6}} was detached from the convoy escort to investigate.\n\n''Sydney'' spotted the island and ''Emden'' at 09:15, with both ships preparing for combat.  At 11:20, the heavily damaged ''Emden'' beached herself on [[North Keeling Island]]. The Australian warship broke to pursue ''Emden''{{'}}s supporting [[Collier (ship)|collier]], which scuttled herself, then returned to North Keeling Island at 16:00. At this point, ''Emden''{{'}}s [[battle ensign]] was still flying: usually a sign that a ship intends to continue fighting. After no response to instructions to lower the ensign, two salvoes were shot into the beached cruiser, after which the Germans lowered the flag and raised a [[flag of surrender|white sheet]]. ''Sydney'' had orders to ascertain the status of the transmission station, but returned the next day to provide medical assistance to the Germans.\n\n134 personnel aboard ''Emden'' were killed, and 69 were wounded, compared to 4 killed and 16 wounded aboard ''Sydney''. The German survivors were taken aboard the Australian cruiser, which caught up to the troop convoy in [[Colombo]] on 15 November, then transported to [[Malta]] and handed over the prisoners to the [[British Army]]. An additional 50 German personnel from the shore party, unable to be recovered before ''Sydney'' arrived, commandeered a schooner and escaped from Direction Island, eventually arriving in [[Constantinople]]. ''Emden'' was the last active [[Central Powers]] warship in the Indian or Pacific Ocean, which meant troopships from Australia and New Zealand could sail without naval escort, and Allied ships could be deployed elsewhere.\n\n===World War II===\nDuring [[World War II]], the cable station was once again a vital link. The Cocos were valuable for direction finding by the [[Y service]], the worldwide intelligence system used during the war.<ref>McKay, S. 2012. ''The Secret Listeners''. Aurum Press Ltd. {{ISBN|978 1 78131 079 3}}</ref>\n\nAllied planners noted that the islands might be seized as an airfield for [[Nazi Germany|German]] planes and as a base for commerce raiders operating in the Indian Ocean.  Following [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s entry into the war, Japanese forces occupied neighbouring islands. To avoid drawing their attention to the Cocos cable station and its islands' garrison, the [[seaplane]] anchorage between Direction and [[Horsburgh Island|Horsburgh]] islands was not used. Radio transmitters were also kept silent, except in emergencies.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nAfter the [[Fall of Singapore]] in 1942, the islands were administered from [[Ceylon]] ([[Sri Lanka]]), and West and Direction Islands were placed under [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] military administration. The islands' garrison initially consisted of a platoon from the British Army's [[King's African Rifles]], located on Horsburgh Island, with two {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=4}} guns to cover the anchorage. The local inhabitants all lived on Home Island. Despite the importance of the islands as a communication centre, the Japanese made no attempt either to raid or to occupy them and contented themselves with sending over a reconnaissance aircraft about once a month.\n\nOn the night of 8\u20139 May 1942, 15 members of the garrison, from the [[Ceylon Defence Force]], [[Mutiny|mutinied]] under the leadership of [[Gratien Fernando]]. The mutineers were said to have been provoked by the attitude of their British officers and were also supposedly inspired by Japanese anti-British propaganda. They attempted to take control of the [[Artillery|gun battery]] on the islands. The [[Cocos Islands Mutiny]] was crushed, but the mutineers murdered one non-mutinous soldier and wounded one officer. Seven of the mutineers were sentenced to death at a trial that was later alleged to have been improperly conducted, though the guilt of the accused was admitted. Four of the sentences were commuted, but three men were executed, including Fernando. These were to be the only [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] soldiers executed for mutiny during the Second World War.<ref name=CIM>{{cite book |last=Cruise |first=Noel |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Cocos Islands Mutiny |publisher=Fremantle Arts Centre Press |year=2002 |location=Fremantle |page=248 |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=1-86368-310-0}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 December 1942, the Japanese submarine ''[[Japanese submarine I-166|I-166]]'' bombarded the islands but caused no damage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/I-166.htm|title=Imperial Submarines|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLater in the war, two airstrips were built, and three bomber squadrons were moved to the islands to conduct raids against Japanese targets in South East Asia and to provide support during the [[Operation Tiderace|planned]] reinvasion of [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and reconquest of Singapore.

Pgs. 133-134</ref>\n*The Commonwealth Parliament and the Government requested and consented to the enactment of a United Kingdom Act for the purpose.\n*The Cocos Islands Act, 1955, authorized Her Majesty, by Order in Council, to direct that the islands should cease to form part of the [[Colony of Singapore]] and be placed under the authority of the Commonwealth.\n*By the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act, 1955, the Parliament of the Commonwealth provided for the acceptance of the islands as a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth and for its government. \n*The Cocos Islands Order in Council, 1955, made under the United Kingdom Act of 1955, provided that upon the appointed day (23 November 1955) the islands should cease to form part of the Colony of Singapore and be placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia.\nThe reason for this comparatively complex machinery was due to the terms of the Straits Settlement (Repeal) Act, 1946. According to Sir Kenneth Roberts-Wray \"any other procedure would have been of doubtful validity\".<ref>Commonwealth and Colonial Law by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966.

In 1978, Australia forced the family to sell the islands for the sum of {{currency|6,250,000|AUD}}, using the threat of compulsory acquisition. By agreement, the family retained ownership of Oceania House, their home on the island. In 1983, the Australian government reneged on this agreement, and told [[John Clunies-Ross]] that he should leave the Cocos. The following year the [[High Court of Australia]] ruled that resumption of Oceania House was unlawful, but the Australian government ordered that no government business was to be granted to Clunies-Ross's shipping company, an action that contributed to his bankruptcy.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Cabinet papers: The last King of Cocos loses his palace|url = http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/cabinet-papers-the-last-king-of-cocos-loses-his-palace-20151217-glqb6m.html|website = The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate = 2016-01-01}}</ref> John Clunies-Ross now lives in Perth, Western Australia. However, some members of the Clunies-Ross family still live on the Cocos.\n\nExtensive preparations were undertaken by the government of Australia to prepare the Cocos Malays to vote in their referendum of self-determination. Discussions began in 1982, with an aim of holding the referendum, under United Nations supervision, in mid-1983. Under guidelines developed by the UN Decolonization Committee, residents were to be offered three choices: full independence, free association, or integration with Australia. The last option was preferred by both the islanders and the Australian government. A change in government in Canberra following the March 1983 Australian elections delayed the vote by one year. While the Home Island Council stated a preference for a traditional communal consensus \"vote\", the UN insisted on a secret ballot. [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands status referendum, 1984|The referendum]] was held on 6 April 1984, with all 261 eligible islanders participating, including the Clunies-Ross family: 229 voted for integration, 21 for Free Association, nine for independence, and two failed to indicate a preference.<ref>Kenneth Chen, \"Pacific Island Development Plan: Cocos (Keeling) Islands- The Political Evolution of a Small Island Territory in the Indian Ocean\" (1987): Mr Chen was Administrator, Cocos Islands, from December 1983 \u2013 November 1985.</ref> In recent years a series of disputes have occurred between the Muslim Coco Malay inhabitants and the non-Muslim population of the islands.[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/lost-in-transition/story-e6frg6z6-1225768109174]\n\n== Government ==\n\nThe capital of the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands is [[West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|West Island]] while the largest settlement is the village of Bantam{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} ([[Home Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Home Island]]).

Barkun writes that conspiracies are \"actual covert plots planned and/or carried out by two or more persons\". A conspiracy theory, on the other hand, is \"an intellectual construct\", a \"template imposed upon the world to give the appearance of order to events\". Positing that \"some small and hidden group\" has manipulated events, a conspiracy theory can be local or international, focused on single events or covering multiple incidents and entire countries, regions and periods of history. Conspiracy theorists see themselves as having privileged access to special knowledge or a special mode of thought that separates them from the masses who believe the official account.<ref name=Barkun2016>Barkun, Michael (25 October 2016). \"Conspiracy Theories as Stigmatized Knowledge\".

Whether the Web has increased the prevalence of conspiracy theories or not is an open research question.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Wood, M. |title= Has the Internet been good for conspiracy theorising? | journal=Psychology Postgraduate Affairs Group (PsyPAG) Quarterly |year= 2015 | number=88|pages= 31\u201333|url=http://www.psypag.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Issue-88.pdf}}</ref> The presence and representation of conspiracy theories in [[search engine]] results has been monitored and studied, showing significant variation across different topics, and a general absence of reputable, high-quality links in the results.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Ballatore, A. |title= Google chemtrails: A methodology to analyze topic representation in search engine results |journal=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]] |year= 2015 | volume=20 | number=7 | url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/5597 | doi=10.5210/fm.v20i7.5597}}</ref>\n\n== Types of conspiracy theory ==\n===Walker's five kinds===\n[[Jesse Walker]] (2013) has identified five kinds of conspiracy theories:\n* The \"Enemy Outside\" refers to theories based on figures alleged to be scheming against a community from without.\n* The \"Enemy Within\" finds the conspirators lurking inside the nation, indistinguishable from ordinary citizens.\n* The \"Enemy Above\" involves powerful people manipulating events for their own gain.\n* The \"Enemy Below\" features the lower classes working to overturn the social order.\n* The \"Benevolent Conspiracies\" are angelic forces that work behind the scenes to improve the world and help people.<ref>[[Jesse Walker]], ''The United States of Paranoia: A Conspiracy Theory'' (2013) [https://www.amazon.com/United-States-Paranoia-Conspiracy-Theory/dp/0062135554/ excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\n===Barkun's three types===\nBarkun has identified three classifications of conspiracy theory:\n* ''Event conspiracy theories''.  This refers to limited and well-defined events.  Examples may include such conspiracies theories as those concerning the [[Kennedy assassination conspiracies|Kennedy assassination]], [[9/11]], and the [[discredited AIDS origins theories|spread of AIDS]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n* ''Systemic conspiracy theories''.  The conspiracy is believed to have broad goals, usually conceived as securing control of a country, a region, or even the entire world. The goals are sweeping, whilst the conspiratorial machinery is generally simple: a single, evil organization implements a plan to infiltrate and subvert existing institutions. This is a common scenario in conspiracy theories that focus on the alleged machinations of [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Jews]], [[Masonic conspiracy theories|Freemasons]], [[Red Scare|Communism]], or the [[Vatican conspiracy theories|Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n* ''Superconspiracy theories''. For Barkun, such theories link multiple alleged conspiracies together hierarchically.  At the summit is a distant but all-powerful evil force.  His cited examples are the ideas of [[David Icke]] and [[Milton William Cooper]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n\n=== Rothbard: shallow vs. deep ===\n[[Murray Rothbard]] argues in favor of a model that contrasts \"deep\" conspiracy theories to \"shallow\" ones. According to Rothbard, a \"shallow\" theorist observes an event and asks ''[[Cui bono]]''? (\"Who benefits?\"), jumping to the conclusion that a posited beneficiary is responsible for covertly influencing events.  On the other hand, the \"deep\" conspiracy theorist begins with a hunch and then seeks out evidence. Rothbard describes this latter activity as a matter of confirming with certain facts one's initial paranoia.<ref>As quoted by B.K. Marcus in \"[https://mises.org/journals/jls/20_2/20_2_2.pdf Radio Free Rothbard],\" ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Vol 20, No 2. (SPRING 2006): pp 17\u201351.

They trace all evil back to a single source, the conspirators and their agents. \n* Third, conspiracy theories are often presented as special, [[esotericism|secret knowledge]] unknown or unappreciated by others. For conspiracy theorists, the masses are a [[sheeple|brainwashed herd]], while the conspiracy theorists in the know can congratulate themselves on penetrating the plotters' deceptions.\"<ref name=\"New Internationalist 1 2004\"/>\n\nThis third point is supported by research of Roland Imhoff, professor in [[Social Psychology]] at the [[Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz]]. The research suggests that the smaller the minority believing in a specific theory, the more attractive it is to conspiracy theorists.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Imhoff |first1=Roland |title=Conspiracy Theorists Just Want to Feel Special |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9kg8j3/conspiracy-theorists-just-want-to-feel-special |website=motherboard.vice.com |accessdate=July 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Humanistic psychology|Humanistic psychologists]] argue that even if a posited cabal behind an alleged conspiracy is almost always perceived as hostile, there often remains an element of reassurance for theorists. This is because it is a consolation to imagine that difficulties in human affairs are created by humans, and remain within human control.  If a cabal can be implicated, there may be a hope of breaking its power or of joining it.

This projection, according to the argument, is manifested in the form of attribution of undesirable characteristics of the self to the conspirators. Historian Richard Hofstadter stated that:\n\n<blockquote>This enemy seems on many counts a projection of the self; both the ideal and the unacceptable aspects of the self are attributed to him. A fundamental paradox of the paranoid style is the imitation of the enemy. The enemy, for example, may be the cosmopolitan intellectual, but the paranoid will outdo him in the apparatus of scholarship, even of pedantry.&nbsp;...&nbsp;The Ku Klux Klan imitated Catholicism to the point of donning priestly vestments, developing an elaborate ritual and an equally elaborate hierarchy. The [[John Birch Society]] emulates Communist cells and quasi-secret operation through \"front\" groups, and preaches a ruthless prosecution of the ideological war along lines very similar to those it finds in the Communist enemy. Spokesmen of the various fundamentalist anti-Communist \"crusades\" openly express their admiration for the dedication, discipline, and strategic ingenuity the Communist cause calls forth.<ref name=\"harpers=1964\"/></blockquote>\n\nHofstadter also noted that \"sexual freedom\" is a vice frequently attributed to the conspiracist's target group, noting that \"very often the fantasies of true believers reveal strong sadomasochistic outlets, vividly expressed, for example, in the delight of anti-Masons with the cruelty of Masonic punishments.\"<ref name=\"harpers=1964\">{{cite book|author=Hofstadter, Richard|author-link=Richard Hofstadter|year=1965|title=The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A.

While the complete facts of the situation and correct methodology are ostensibly important to them, Latour proposes that the scientific process is instead laid on as a patina to one's pet theories to lend a sort of reputation high ground. The \"fact position\" argues that individuals are dominated, often covertly and without their awareness, by external forces (e.g., economics, gender).{{r|critiquesteam|page2=238}} Latour concludes that each of these two approaches in Academia has led to a polarized, inefficient atmosphere highlighted (in both approaches) by its causticness. \"Do you see now why it feels so good to be a critical mind?\" asks Latour: no matter which position you take, \"You're always right!\"{{r|critiquesteam|page3=238\u201339}}\n\nLatour notes that such social criticism has been appropriated by those he describes as conspiracy theorists, including [[climate change denial]]ists and the [[9/11 Truth movement]]: \"Maybe I am taking conspiracy theories too seriously, but I am worried to detect, in those mad mixtures of knee-jerk disbelief, punctilious demands for proofs, and free use of powerful explanation from the social neverland, many of the weapons of social critique.\"{{r|critiquesteam|page4=230}}\n\n===Fusion paranoia===\n[[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]], a ''[[Washington Post]]'' journalist and critic of [[anti-war]] movements on both the left and right, coined the term \"fusion paranoia\" to refer to a political convergence of left-wing and right-wing activists around anti-war issues and [[civil liberties]], which he said were motivated by a shared belief in conspiracism or shared [[Anti-statism|anti-government]] views.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/06/19/the-road-to-paranoia|title=THE ROAD TO PARANOIA|last=Kelly|first=Michael|date=1995-06-12|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>\n\nBarkun has adopted this term to refer to how the synthesis of paranoid conspiracy theories, which were once limited to American fringe audiences, has given them mass appeal and enabled them to become commonplace in [[mass media]],{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=230}} thereby inaugurating an unrivaled period of people actively preparing for [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] or [[millenarianism|millenarian]] scenarios in the United States of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.{{sfn|Barkun|2003|pp=207, 210, 211}} Barkun notes the occurrence of lone-wolf conflicts with law enforcement acting as proxy for threatening the established political powers.{{sfn|Barkun|2003|pp=193, 197}}\n\n==Viability of conspiracies==\nThe physicist [[David Robert Grimes]] published in the [[PLOS ONE]] journal an estimation of the time it would take for a conspiracy to be exposed, based on the number of people involved.<ref name=\"pbs_plos_one\">{{cite web|last1=Barajas|first1=Joshua|title=How many people does it take to keep a conspiracy alive?|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/math-formula-charts-the-lifespan-of-hoaxes/|website=PBS NEWSHOUR|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)|accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Grimes_PLOS_ONE\">{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=David R|authorlink1=David Robert Grimes|title=On the Viability of Conspiratorial Beliefs|journal=PLOS ONE|date=26 January 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0147905|pmid=26812482|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147905|accessdate=22 July 2016|volume=11|pmc=4728076|pages=e0147905}}</ref>  \nHis calculations used data from verified events such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|The National Security Agency (NSA) PRISM affair]], [[Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment]] and the [[FBI Laboratory#Controversy|FBI forensic scandal]].\n\n* [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|Moon landing hoax]] would require the involvement of 411,000 people and would be exposed within 3.68 years;\n* [[Global warming conspiracy theory|Climate-change fraud]] would require 405,000 people and would be exposed within 3.70 years;\n* [[Vaccine controversies|Vaccination conspiracy]] would require a minimum of 22,000 people (without drug companies) and would be exposed within at least 3.15 years and at most 34.78 years depending on the number involved;\n* [[Big Pharma conspiracy theory|Suppressed cancer cure conspiracy]] would require 714,000 people and would be exposed within 3.17 years.\n\n==Political use==\nIn his book ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] used the term \"conspiracy theory\" to criticize the ideologies driving [[historicism]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=Open Society and Its Enemies, Book II|year=1945|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|location=London|chapter=14}}</ref> Popper argued that [[totalitarianism]] was founded on \"conspiracy theories\" which drew on imaginary plots driven by paranoid scenarios predicated on tribalism, chauvinism, or racism.

The only inhabited island is [[Willis Island]]. The territory covers {{convert|780000|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}}, most of which is ocean, extending east and south from the outer edge of the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and includes Heralds Beacon Island, [[Osprey Reef]], the Willis Group and fifteen other reef/island groups.

In the 1870s and 1880s the islands were mined for [[guano]] but the absence of a reliable supply of fresh water prevented long-term habitation.<ref name=\"Geosci\"/> The Coral Sea Islands became an Australian external territory in 1969 by the ''Coral Sea Islands Act'' (prior to that, the area was considered part of Queensland) and extended in 1997 to include [[Elizabeth Reef]] and [[Middleton Reef]] nearly 800&nbsp;km further south, already in the [[Tasman Sea]].\n\nThe two latter reefs are much closer to [[Lord Howe Island]], [[New South Wales]], (about {{convert|150|km|0|abbr=on}}) than to the southernmost island of the rest of the territory, Cato Island. The islands, cays and reefs of the [[Great Barrier Reef]] are not part of the territory, belonging to Queensland instead. The outer edge of the Great Barrier Reef is the boundary between Queensland and the Coral Sea Islands Territory.\n\nThe territory is a possession or external territory of [[Australia]], administered from [[Canberra]] by the [[Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities]].
