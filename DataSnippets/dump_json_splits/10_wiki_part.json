The magnitude scale is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]. A difference of 1 in magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of {{radic|100|5}}, or about 2.512.

Apparent magnitudes are used to quantify the brightness of sources at [[ultraviolet]], [[Visible spectrum|visible]], and [[infrared]] wavelengths. An apparent magnitude is usually measured in a specific [[passband]] corresponding to some [[photometric system]] such as the [[UBV photometric system|UBV system]]. In standard astronomical notation, an apparent magnitude in the V (\"visual\") filter band would be denoted either as ''m''<sub>V</sub> or often simply as ''V'', as in \"''m''<sub>''V''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;15\" or \"''V''&nbsp;=&nbsp;15\" to describe a 15th-magnitude object.\n\n== History ==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: center;\"\n!

The [[List of brightest stars|brightest stars]] in the night sky were said to be of [[first magnitude star|first magnitude]] ({{mvar|m}} = 1), whereas the faintest were of sixth magnitude ({{mvar|m}} = 6), which is the limit of [[human]] [[visual perception]] (without the aid of a [[telescope]]). Each grade of magnitude was considered twice the brightness of the following grade (a [[logarithmic scale]]), although that ratio was subjective as no [[photodetector]]s existed. This rather crude scale for the brightness of stars was popularized by [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' and is generally believed to have originated with [[Hipparchus]].\n\nIn 1856, [[Norman Robert Pogson]] formalized the system by defining a first magnitude star as a star that is 100 times as bright as a sixth-magnitude star, thereby establishing the logarithmic scale still in use today. This implies that a star of magnitude {{mvar|m}} is about 2.512 times as bright as a star of magnitude {{math|''m'' + 1}}. This figure, the [[Generalized continued fraction#Example 2|fifth root of 100]], became known as Pogson's Ratio.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0017//0000012.000.html |title=Magnitudes of Thirty-six of the Minor Planets for the first day of each month of the year 1857 |authorlink=Norman Robert Pogson |first=N. |last=Pogson |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|MNRAS]] |volume=17 |page=12 |date=1856|bibcode=1856MNRAS..17...12P |doi=10.1093/mnras/17.1.12 }}</ref> The zero point of Pogson's scale was originally defined by assigning [[Polaris]] a magnitude of exactly 2. Astronomers later discovered that Polaris is slightly variable, so they switched to [[Vega]] as the standard reference star, assigning the brightness of Vega as the definition of zero magnitude at any specified wavelength.\n\nApart from small corrections, the brightness of Vega still serves as the definition of zero magnitude for visible and [[Infrared#ISO 20473 scheme|near infrared]] wavelengths, where its [[spectral energy distribution]] (SED) closely approximates that of a [[black body]] for a temperature of {{val|11000|u=K}}. However, with the advent of [[infrared astronomy]] it was revealed that Vega's radiation includes an [[Infrared excess]] presumably due to a [[circumstellar disk]] consisting of [[Cosmic dust|dust]] at warm temperatures (but much cooler than the star's surface). At shorter (e.g. visible) wavelengths, there is negligible emission from dust at these temperatures. However, in order to properly extend the magnitude scale further into the infrared, this peculiarity of Vega should not affect the definition of the magnitude scale. Therefore, the magnitude scale was extrapolated to ''all'' wavelengths on the basis of the [[Planck's law|black body radiation curve]] for an ideal stellar surface at {{val|11000|u=K}} uncontaminated by circumstellar radiation. On this basis the [[spectral irradiance]] (usually expressed in [[jansky]]s) for the zero magnitude point, as a function of wavelength, can be computed.<ref>See [https://archive.is/20121204144725/http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~patton/astro/mags.html].</ref> Small deviations are specified between systems using measurement apparatuses developed independently so that data obtained by different astronomers can be properly compared, but of greater practical importance is the definition of magnitude not at a single wavelength but applying to the response of standard spectral filters used in [[Photometry (astronomy)#methods|photometry]] over various wavelength bands.\n\nWith the modern magnitude systems, brightness over a very wide range is specified according to the logarithmic definition detailed below, using this zero reference. In practice such apparent magnitudes do not exceed 30 (for detectable measurements). The brightness of Vega is exceeded by four stars in the night sky at visible wavelengths (and more at infrared wavelengths) as well as the bright planets Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and these must be described by ''negative'' magnitudes. For example, [[Sirius]], the brightest star of the [[celestial sphere]], has an apparent magnitude of \u22121.4 in the visible. Negative magnitudes for other very bright astronomical objects can be found in the [[#Table of notable celestial objects|table]] below.\n\nAstronomers have developed other photometric zeropoint systems as alternatives to the Vega system. The most widely used is the [[AB magnitude]] system,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Oke|first1=J. B.|last2=Gunn|first2=J. E.|title=Secondary standard stars for absolute spectrophotometry|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=March 15, 1983|volume=266|pages=713\u2013717|doi=10.1086/160817|bibcode=1983ApJ...266..713O}}</ref> in which photometric zeropoints are based on a hypothetical reference spectrum having constant [[Spectral flux density|flux per unit frequency interval]], rather than using a stellar spectrum or blackbody curve as the reference. The AB magnitude zeropoint is defined such that an object's AB and Vega-based magnitudes will be approximately equal in the V filter band.\n\n== Calculations ==\n[[File:VISTA Magellanic Cloud Survey view of the Tarantula Nebula.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[30 Doradus]] image taken by [[ESO]]'s [[VISTA (telescope)|VISTA]]. This [[nebula]] has an apparent magnitude of 8.]]\n[[File:Apparent magnitude.svg|thumb|A graph of apparent magnitude against brightness]]\n\nAs the amount of light actually received by a telescope is reduced by transmission through the [[Earth's atmosphere]], any measurement of apparent magnitude is [[Photometry (astronomy)#Calibrations|corrected]] for what it would have been as seen from above the atmosphere. The dimmer an object appears, the higher the numerical value given to its apparent magnitude, with a difference of 5 magnitudes corresponding to a brightness factor of exactly 100. Therefore, the apparent magnitude {{mvar|m}}, in the [[Photometric system|spectral band]] {{mvar|x}}, would be given by\n\n:<math>m_{x}= -5 \\log_{100} \\left(\\frac {F_x}{F_{x,0}}\\right),</math>\n\nwhich is more commonly expressed in terms of [[Common logarithm|common (base-10) logarithms]] as\n\n:<math>m_{x} = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac {F_x}{F_{x,0}}\\right),</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|F<sub>x</sub>}} is the observed [[flux density]] using spectral filter {{mvar|x}}, and {{math|''F''<sub>''x'',0</sub>}} is the reference flux (zero-point) for that [[Photometric system#Filters used|photometric filter]]. Since an increase of 5 magnitudes corresponds to a decrease in brightness by a factor of exactly 100, each magnitude increase implies a decrease in brightness by the factor {{radic|100|5}} \u2248&nbsp;2.512 (Pogson's ratio). Inverting the above formula, a magnitude difference {{math|''m''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''m''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} \u0394''m''}} implies a brightness factor of\n\n:<math> \\frac{F_2}{F_1} = 100^\\frac{\\Delta m}{5} = 10^{0.4 \\Delta m} \\approx 2.512^{\\Delta m}.</math>\n\n=== Example: Sun and Moon ===\n''What is the ratio in brightness between the [[Sun]] and the full [[Moon]]?''\n\nThe apparent magnitude of the Sun is \u221226.74 (brighter), and the mean apparent magnitude of the [[full moon]] is \u221212.74 (dimmer).\n\nDifference in magnitude: \n:<math> x = m_1 - m_2 = (-12.74) - (-26.74) = 14.00. </math>\n\nBrightness factor: \n:<math> v_b = 10^{0.4 x} = 10^{0.4 \\times 14.00} \\approx 398\\,107.17. </math>\n\nThe Sun appears about {{val|400000}} times brighter than the full moon.\n\n===Magnitude addition===\nSometimes one might wish to add brightnesses. For example, [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] on closely separated [[double star]]s may only be able to produce a measurement of their combined light output. How would we reckon the combined magnitude of that double star knowing only the magnitudes of the individual components? This can be done by adding the brightnesses (in linear units) corresponding to each magnitude.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magnitude Arithmetic|url=http://www.caglow.com/info/wtopic/mag-arith|work=Weekly Topic|publisher=Caglow|accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref>\n:<math> 10^{-m_f \\times 0.4} = 10^{-m_1 \\times 0.4} + 10^{-m_2 \\times 0.4}. </math>\n\nSolving for <math>m_f</math> yields\n:<math> m_f = -2.5\\log_{10} \\left(10^{-m_1 \\times 0.4} + 10^{-m_2 \\times 0.4} \\right), </math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|m<sub>f</sub>}} is the resulting magnitude after adding the brightnesses referred to by {{math|''m''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''m''<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\n===Absolute magnitude===\n{{main|Absolute magnitude}}\nSince flux decreases with distance according to the [[inverse-square law]], a particular apparent magnitude could equally well refer to a star at one distance, or a star four times brighter at twice that distance, and so on. When one is not interested in the brightness as viewed from Earth, but the ''intrinsic'' brightness of an astronomical object, then one refers not to the apparent magnitude but the absolute magnitude. The absolute magnitude {{mvar|M}}, of a star or astronomical object is defined as the apparent magnitude it would have as seen from a distance of 10 [[parsec]]s (about 32.6 [[light-year]]s).

For example, a difference of 3.2 means that one object is about 19 times as bright as the other, because [[Apparent magnitude#History|Pogson's Ratio]] raised to the power 3.2 is approximately 19.05.\n\nA common misconception is that the logarithmic nature of the scale is because the [[human eye]] itself has a logarithmic response. In Pogson's time this was thought to be true (see [[Weber\u2013Fechner law]]), but it is now believed that the response is a [[power law]] (see [[Stevens' power law]]).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Misconceptions About Astronomical Magnitudes|authorlink=Eric Schulman|first1=E.|last1=Schulman|first2=C.

The sensitivity of a light detector varies according to the wavelength of the light, and the way it varies depends on the type of light detector. For this reason, it is necessary to specify how the magnitude is measured for the value to be meaningful. For this purpose the [[UBV system]] is widely used, in which the magnitude is measured in three different wavelength bands: U (centred at about 350&nbsp;nm, in the near [[ultraviolet]]), B (about 435&nbsp;nm, in the blue region) and V (about 555&nbsp;nm, in the middle of the human visual range in daylight). The V band was chosen for spectral purposes and gives magnitudes closely corresponding to those seen by the light-adapted human eye, and when an apparent magnitude is given without any further qualification, it is usually the V magnitude that is meant, more or less the same as visual magnitude.\n\nBecause cooler stars, such as [[red giant]]s and [[red dwarf]]s, emit little energy in the blue and UV regions of the spectrum their power is often under-represented by the UBV scale. Indeed, some [[stellar classification|L and T class]] stars have an estimated magnitude of well over 100, because they emit extremely little visible light, but are strongest in [[infrared]].\n\nMeasures of magnitude need cautious treatment and it is extremely important to measure like with like. On early 20th century and older orthochromatic (blue-sensitive) [[photographic film]], the relative brightnesses of the blue [[supergiant]] [[Rigel]] and the red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] irregular variable star (at maximum) are reversed compared to what human eyes perceive, because this archaic film is more sensitive to blue light than it is to red light. Magnitudes obtained from this method are known as [[photographic magnitude]]s, and are now considered obsolete.\n\nFor objects within the [[Milky Way]] with a given absolute magnitude, 5 is added to the apparent magnitude for every tenfold increase in the distance to the object. For objects at very great distances (far beyond the Milky Way), this relationship must be [[K correction|adjusted for redshifts]] and for [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] distance measures due to [[general relativity]].<ref name=umeh>{{cite journal|bibcode=2014CQGra..31t5001U|arxiv=1402.1933|title=Nonlinear relativistic corrections to cosmological distances, redshift and gravitational lensing magnification: II.

An object's absolute magnitude is defined to be equal to the [[apparent magnitude]] that the object would have if it were viewed from a distance of exactly 10&nbsp;[[parsecs]] (32.6 [[light-year]]s), with no [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] (or dimming) of its light due to absorption by [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] particles. By hypothetically placing all objects at a standard reference distance from the observer, their luminosities can be directly compared on a magnitude scale. As with all astronomical [[magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]], the absolute magnitude can be specified for different [[wavelength]] ranges corresponding to specified [[Filter (optics)|filter]] bands or [[passband]]s; for stars a commonly quoted absolute magnitude is the '''absolute visual magnitude''', which uses the visual (V) band of the spectrum (in the [[UBV photometric system]]). Absolute magnitudes are denoted by a capital M, with a subscript representing the filter band used for measurement, such as M<sub>V</sub> for absolute magnitude in the V band.\n\nThe more luminous an object, the smaller the numerical value of its absolute magnitude. A difference of 5 magnitudes between the absolute magnitudes of two objects corresponds to a ratio of 100 in their luminosities, and a difference of n magnitudes in absolute magnitude corresponds to a luminosity ratio of 100<sup>(n/5)</sup>. For example, a star of absolute magnitude M<sub>V</sub>=3 would be 100 times more luminous than a star of absolute magnitude M<sub>V</sub>=8 as measured in the V filter band. The [[Sun]] has absolute magnitude M<sub>V</sub>=+4.83.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sun Fact Sheet|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/sunfact.html|publisher=[[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center]]|accessdate=25 February 2017}}</ref> Highly luminous objects can have negative absolute magnitudes: for example, the [[Milky Way]] galaxy has an absolute B magnitude of about \u221220.8.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Karachentsev|first1=I.

To convert from an absolute magnitude in a specific filter band to absolute bolometric magnitude, a [[bolometric correction]] is applied.\n\nFor [[Solar System]] bodies that shine in reflected light, a different definition of absolute magnitude (H) is used, based on a standard reference distance of one [[astronomical unit]].\n\n== Stars and galaxies ({{mvar|''M''}}) ==\nIn stellar and galactic astronomy, the standard distance is 10 parsecs (about 32.616 light-years, 308.57 petameters or 308.57 [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]] kilometres). A star at 10 parsecs has a [[parallax]] of 0.1\u2033 (100 milli[[minute of arc|arcseconds]]). Galaxies (and other [[nebula|extended objects]]) are much larger than 10 parsecs, their light is radiated over an extended patch of sky, and their overall brightness cannot be directly observed from relatively short distances, but the same convention is used. A galaxy's magnitude is defined by measuring all the light radiated over the entire object, treating that integrated brightness as the brightness of a single point-like or star-like source, and computing the magnitude of that point-like source as it would appear if observed at the standard 10 parsecs distance. Consequently, the absolute magnitude of any object ''equals'' the apparent magnitude it ''would have'' if it were 10 parsecs away.\n\nThe measurement of absolute magnitude is made with an instrument called a [[bolometer]]. When using an absolute magnitude, one must specify the type of [[electromagnetic radiation]] being measured. When referring to total energy output, the proper term is [[bolometer|bolometric]] magnitude. The bolometric magnitude usually is computed from the visual magnitude plus a [[bolometric correction]], {{math|''M''<sub>bol</sub> {{=}} ''M''<sub>V</sub> + BC}}. This correction is needed because very hot stars radiate mostly ultraviolet radiation, whereas very cool stars radiate mostly infrared radiation (see [[Planck's law]]).\n\nSome stars visible to the naked eye have such a low absolute magnitude that they would appear bright enough to outshine the [[planet]]s and cast shadows if they were at 10 parsecs from the Earth. Examples include [[Rigel]] (\u22127.0), [[Deneb]] (\u22127.2), [[Zeta Puppis|Naos]] (\u22126.0), and [[Betelgeuse]] (\u22125.6). For comparison, [[Sirius]] has an absolute magnitude of 1.4, which is brighter than the [[Sun]], whose absolute visual magnitude is [[fifth magnitude star|4.83]] (it actually serves as a reference point). The Sun's absolute bolometric magnitude is set arbitrarily, usually at 4.75.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Cayrel de Strobel\n| first = G.\n| title = Stars resembling the Sun\n| journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics Review\n| volume = 7\n| issue = 3\n| pages = 243\u2013288\n| date = 1996\n| doi = 10.1007/s001590050006\n|bibcode = 1996A&ARv...7..243C }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{Cite journal\n| last = Casagrande | first = L. |last2= Portinari|first2= L.|last3= Flynn|first3= C.\n|date=November 2006\n| title = Accurate fundamental parameters for lower main-sequence stars\n| journal = MNRAS | volume = 373 | issue = 1 | pages = 13\u201344\n| doi =10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.10999.x\n| bibcode = 2006MNRAS.373...13C\n| type = Abstract |arxiv= astro-ph/0608504}}\n</ref>\nAbsolute magnitudes of stars generally range from \u221210 to +17.

Planned as the first [[low Earth orbit]]al test of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] with a crew, to launch on February 21, 1967, the mission never flew; a cabin fire during a launch rehearsal test at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34]] on January 27 killed all three crew members\u2014Command Pilot [[Gus Grissom|Virgil I. \"Gus\" Grissom]], Senior Pilot [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and Pilot [[Roger B. Chaffee]]\u2014and destroyed the Command Module (CM). The name ''Apollo 1'', chosen by the crew, was officially retired by [[NASA]] in commemoration of them on April 24, 1967.\n\nImmediately after the fire, NASA convened the ''Apollo 204 Accident Review Board'' to determine the cause of the fire, and both houses of the [[United States Congress]] conducted their own [[United States congressional hearing|committee inquiries]] to oversee NASA's investigation. The ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material, and the high pressure, pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. The astronauts' rescue was prevented by the [[plug door]] hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure of the cabin. Because the rocket was unfueled, the test was not considered hazardous, and emergency preparedness for the test was poor.\n\nDuring the Congressional investigation, Senator [[Walter Mondale]] publicly revealed a NASA internal document citing problems with prime Apollo contractor [[North American Aviation]], which became known as the \"[[Phillips Report]]\". This disclosure embarrassed NASA Administrator [[James E. Webb]], who was unaware of the document's existence, and attracted controversy to the Apollo program. Despite congressional displeasure at NASA's lack of openness, both congressional committees ruled that the issues raised in the report had no bearing on the accident.\n\nManned Apollo flights were suspended for 20 months while the Command Module's hazards were addressed. However, the development and unmanned testing of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) and [[Saturn V]] Moon rocket continued. The [[Saturn IB]] launch vehicle for Apollo 1, AS-204, was used for the first LM test flight, [[Apollo 5]]. The first successful manned Apollo mission was flown by Apollo 1's backup crew on [[Apollo 7]] in October 1968.\n\n== Crew ==\n{{Spaceflight crew\n|terminology      = Astronaut\n|position1        = Command Pilot\n|crew1_up         = [[Gus Grissom|Virgil I. \"Gus\" Grissom]]\n|flights1_up      = Would have been third\n|crew2_up         = [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]]\n|flights2_up      = Would have been second\n|position3        = Pilot\n|crew3_up         = [[Roger B.

In October 1963, [[Joseph Francis Shea|Joseph F. Shea]] was named Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO) manager, responsible for managing the design and construction of both the CSM and the LM.\nIn a spacecraft review meeting held with Shea on August 19, 1966 (a week before delivery), the crew expressed concern about the amount of flammable material (mainly nylon netting and [[hook and loop fastener|Velcro]]) in the cabin, which both astronauts and technicians found convenient for holding tools and equipment in place. Although Shea gave the spacecraft a passing grade, after the meeting they gave him a crew portrait they had posed with heads bowed and hands clasped in prayer, with the inscription:\n<blockquote>It isn't that we don't trust you, Joe, but this time we've decided to go over your head.<ref name=\"murray\">{{cite book |last1=Murray |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Murray (political scientist) |last2=Cox |first2=Catherine Bly |title=Apollo: The Race to the Moon |year=1990 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-671-70625-8 |ref=Murray & Cox}}</ref>{{rp|184}}</blockquote>\nShea gave his staff orders to tell North American to remove the flammables from the cabin, but did not supervise the issue personally.<ref name=\"murray\"/>{{rp|185}}\n\nNorth American shipped spacecraft CM-012 to Kennedy Space Center on August 26, 1966, under a conditional Certificate of Flight Worthiness: 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes had to be completed at KSC.

Altitude testing was performed first unmanned, then with both the prime and backup crews, from October 10 through December 30. During this testing, the Environmental Control Unit in the Command Module was found to have a design flaw, and was sent back to the manufacturer for design changes and rework. The returned ECU then leaked water/glycol coolant, and had to be returned a second time. Also during this time, a propellant tank in Service Module 017 had ruptured during testing at NAA, prompting the separation of the modules and removal from the chamber so the Service Module could be tested for signs of the tank problem. These tests were negative.\n\n[[File:McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart in preliminary training for Apollo AS-258 mission.jpg|thumb|McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart were training for the second Apollo mission on January 26, 1967, in the first Block II Command Module, wearing early blue versions of the Block II pressure suit.]]\nIn December, the second Block I flight AS-205 was canceled as unnecessary; and Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the backup crew for Apollo 1.

Passing this test was essential to making the February 21 launch date. The test was considered non-hazardous because neither the launch vehicle nor the spacecraft was loaded with fuel or [[cryogenics]], and all [[pyrotechnic fastener|pyrotechnic]] systems (explosive bolts) were disabled.<ref name=\"SP4029\" />\n\nAt 1:00&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (1800 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]]) on January 27, first Grissom, then Chaffee, and White entered the Command Module fully pressure-suited, and were strapped into their seats and hooked up to the spacecraft's oxygen and communication systems. Grissom immediately noticed a strange odor in the air circulating through his suit which he compared to \"sour buttermilk\", and the simulated countdown was held at 1:20&nbsp;pm, while air samples were taken. No cause of the odor could be found, and the countdown was resumed at 2:42&nbsp;pm. The accident investigation found this odor not to be related to the fire.<ref name=\"SP4029\" />\n\nThree minutes after the count was resumed, the hatch installation was started. The hatch consisted of three parts: a removable inner hatch, which stayed inside the cabin; a hinged outer hatch, which was part of the spacecraft's heat shield; and an outer hatch cover, which was part of the boost protective cover enveloping the entire Command Module to protect it from aerodynamic heating during launch, and from launch escape rocket exhaust in the event of a launch abort. The boost hatch cover was partially, but not fully, latched in place because the flexible boost protective cover was slightly distorted by some cabling run under it to provide the simulated internal power. (The spacecraft's fuel cell reactants were not loaded for this test.) After the hatches were sealed, the air in the cabin was replaced with pure oxygen at {{convert|16.7|psi|kPa|abbr=on|lk=on}}, {{convert|2|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} higher than atmospheric pressure.<ref name=\"SP4029\" /><ref name=\"aibreport\"/>{{rp|Enclosure V-21, p. 181}}\n\n[[File:Apollo One Recording.ogg|thumb|Audio recording from the ground loop, starting from Grissom's \"talk between buildings\" remark. First mention of fire is heard at 1:05.]]\nMovement by the astronauts was detected by the spacecraft's [[inertial measurement unit]] and the astronaut's biomedical sensors, and also indicated by increases in oxygen spacesuit flow, and sounds from Grissom's stuck-open microphone. There was no evidence to identify the movement, or whether it was related to the fire.  The stuck microphone was part of a problem with the communications loop connecting the crew, the [[Operations and Checkout Building]], and the Complex 34 blockhouse control room. The poor communications led Grissom to remark: \"How are we going to get to the Moon if we can't talk between two or three buildings?\" The simulated countdown was held again at 5:40&nbsp;pm while attempts were made to troubleshoot the communications problem. All countdown functions up to the simulated internal power transfer had been successfully completed by 6:20&nbsp;pm, but at 6:30 the count remained on hold at T minus 10 minutes.<ref name=\"SP4029\" />\n\n=== Fire ===\n[[File:Apollo 1's Command Module - GPN-2003-00057.jpg|thumb|upright|Exterior of the Command Module was blackened from eruption of the fire after the cabin wall failed]]\nThe crew members were using the time to run through their checklist again, when a momentary increase in AC Bus 2 voltage occurred. Nine seconds later (at 6:31:04.7), one of the astronauts (some listeners and laboratory analysis indicate Grissom) exclaimed \"Hey!\", \"Fire!\",<ref name=\"aibreport\"/>{{rp|5\u20138}} or \"Flame!\";<ref>{{cite book |last=Slade |first=Suzanne |others=Illustrated by Thomas Gonzalez |title=Countdown: 2979 Days to the Moon |publisher=Peachtree |location=Atlanta |page=18 |year=2018 |isbn=978-1-68263-013-6}}</ref> this was followed by two seconds of scuffling sounds through Grissom's open microphone. This was immediately followed at 6:31:06.2 (23:31:06.2 GMT) by someone (believed by most listeners, and supported by laboratory analysis, to be Chaffee) saying, \"[I've, or We've] got a fire in the cockpit.\" After 6.8 seconds of silence, a second, badly garbled transmission occurred, interpreted by various listeners as:\n* \"They're fighting a bad fire\u2014Let's get out ....Open 'er up\"\n* \"We've got a bad fire\u2014Let's get out ....We're burning up\", or\n* \"I'm reporting a bad fire ....I'm getting out ....\".\nThis transmission, believed by some listeners to be Chaffee, lasted 5.0 seconds and ended with a cry of pain.<ref name=\"aibreport\"/>{{rp|5\u20138,5\u20139}}\n\nSome blockhouse witnesses said that they saw White on the television monitors, reaching for the inner hatch release handle<ref name=\"SP4029\" /> as flames in the cabin spread from left to right.<ref name=\"aibreport\"/>{{rp|5\u20133}}\n\nThe intensity of the fire fed by pure oxygen caused the pressure to rise to {{convert|29|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}, which ruptured the Command Module's inner wall at 6:31:19 (23:31:19 GMT, initial phase of the fire). Flames and gases then rushed outside the Command Module through open access panels to two levels of the pad service structure. Intense heat, dense smoke, and ineffective gas masks designed for toxic fumes rather than heavy smoke hampered the ground crew's attempts to rescue the men. There were fears the Command Module had exploded, or soon would, and that the fire might ignite the solid fuel rocket in the launch escape tower above the Command Module, which would have likely killed nearby ground personnel, and possibly have destroyed the pad.<ref name=\"SP4029\" />\n\nAs the pressure was released by the cabin rupture, the convective rush of air caused the flames to spread across the cabin, beginning the second phase. The third phase began when most of the oxygen was consumed and was replaced with atmospheric air, essentially quenching the fire, but causing high concentrations of carbon monoxide and heavy smoke to fill the cabin, and large amounts of soot to be deposited on surfaces as they cooled.<ref name=\"SP4029\"/><ref name=\"aibreport\"/>{{rp|5\u20133,5\u20134}}\n\nIt took five minutes for the pad workers to open all three hatch layers, and they could not drop the inner hatch to the cabin floor as intended, so they pushed it out of the way to one side. Although the cabin lights remained lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. White's restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was not able to do so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.<ref name=\"SP4029\" />\n\nDeke Slayton was possibly the first NASA official to examine the spacecraft interior.<ref name=\"Leopold\">{{cite book |last=Leopold |first=George |title=Calculated Risk: The Supersonic Life and Times of Gus Grissom |year=2016 |publisher=[[Purdue University Press]] |location=West Lafayette, Indiana |isbn=978-1-55753-745-4 |pages=259\u2013260}}</ref> His testimony contradicted the official report concerning the position of Grissom's body.

White suffered third degree burns on almost half of his body and a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over almost a quarter of his body and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged. The autopsy report confirmed that the primary cause of death for all three astronauts was [[cardiac arrest]] caused by high concentrations of [[carbon monoxide]]. Burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem. [[Asphyxiation]] happened after the fire melted the astronauts' suits and oxygen tubes, exposing them to the lethal atmosphere of the cabin.<ref name=\"aibreport\"/>{{rp|6\u20131}}\n\n===Major causes of accident===\nThe review board identified several major factors which combined to cause the fire and the astronauts' deaths:<ref name=\"SP4029\"/>\n* An ''ignition source'' most probably related to \"vulnerable wiring carrying spacecraft power\" and \"vulnerable plumbing carrying a combustible and corrosive coolant\"\n* A ''pure oxygen atmosphere'' at higher than atmospheric pressure\n* A ''cabin sealed with a hatch cover'' which could not be quickly removed at high pressure\n* An extensive distribution of ''combustible materials'' in the cabin\n* ''Inadequate emergency preparedness'' (rescue or medical assistance, and crew escape)\n\n==== Ignition source ====\nThe review board determined that the electrical power momentarily failed at 23:30:55 GMT, and found evidence of several [[electric arc]]s in the interior equipment. They were unable to conclusively identify a single ignition source. They determined that the fire most likely started near the floor in the lower left section of the cabin, close to the Environmental Control Unit.<ref name=\"aibreport\" />{{rp|6\u20131}} It spread from the left wall of the cabin to the right, with the floor being affected only briefly.<ref name=\"aibreport\"/>{{rp|5\u20133}}\n\nThe board noted that a silver-plated copper wire, running through an environmental control unit near the center couch, had become stripped of its [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] insulation and abraded by repeated opening and closing of a small access door.{{efn|In 1967 a vice president of North American Aviation, John McCarthy, speculated that Grissom had accidentally \"scuffed the insulation of a wire\" while moving about the spacecraft, but his remarks were ignored by the review board and strongly rejected by a congressional committee. [[Frank Borman]], who had been the first astronaut to go inside the burned spacecraft, testified, \"We found no evidence to support the thesis that Gus, or any of the crew members kicked the wire that ignited the flammables.\" A 1978 history of the accident written internally by NASA said at the time, \"the spark that led to the fire still has wide currency at Kennedy Space Center.

The normal pressure level used for launch ({{convert|2|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} above ambient) created sufficient force to prevent removing the cover until the excess pressure was vented. Emergency procedure called for Grissom to open the cabin vent valve first, allowing White to remove the cover,<ref name=\"SP4029\" /> but Grissom was prevented from doing this because the valve was located to the left, behind the initial wall of flames.

But the decision to eliminate the use of any gas but oxygen was crystalized when a serious accident occurred on April 21, 1960, in which [[McDonnell Aircraft]] test pilot G.B.

Anderson]]. Seamans, Webb, Manned Space Flight Administrator Dr. [[George Mueller (NASA)|George E. Mueller]], and Apollo Program Director [[Major general (United States)|Maj Gen]] [[Samuel C. Phillips]] were called to testify before Anderson's committee.<ref name=\"anderson\"/>\n\nIn the February 27 hearing, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Walter Mondale|Walter F. Mondale]] asked Webb if he knew of a report of extraordinary problems with the performance of North American Aviation on the Apollo contract. Webb replied he did not, and deferred to his subordinates on the witness panel. Mueller and Phillips responded they too were unaware of any such \"report\".<ref name=\"chariots9-3\"/>\n\nHowever, in late 1965, just over a year before the accident, Phillips had headed a \"[[tiger team]]\" investigating the causes of inadequate quality, schedule delays, and cost overruns in both the Apollo CSM and the Saturn V second stage (for which North American was also prime contractor). He gave an oral presentation (with transparencies) of his team's findings to Mueller and Seamans, and also presented them in a memo to North American president [[John Leland Atwood|John L. Atwood]], to which Mueller appended his own strongly worded memo to Atwood.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/phillip1.html |title=The Phillips Report |publisher=NASA History Office |accessdate=April 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring Mondale's 1967 questioning about what was to become known as the \"[[Phillips Report]]\", Seamans was afraid Mondale might actually have seen a hard copy of Phillips' presentation, and responded that contractors have occasionally been subjected to on-site progress reviews; perhaps this was what Mondale's information referred to.<ref name=\"toughDecisions\" /> Mondale continued to refer to \"the Report\" despite Phillips' refusal to characterize it as such, and angered by what he perceived as Webb's deception and concealment of important program problems from Congress, he questioned NASA's selection of North American as prime contractor. Seamans later wrote that Webb roundly chastised him in the cab ride leaving the hearing, for volunteering information which led to the disclosure of Phillips' memo.<ref name=\"toughDecisions\" />\n\nOn May 11, Webb issued a statement defending NASA's November 1961 selection of North American as the prime contractor for Apollo. This was followed on June 9 by Seamans filing a seven-page memorandum documenting the selection process. Webb eventually provided a [[document control|controlled copy]] of Phillips' memo to Congress. The Senate committee noted in its final report NASA's testimony that \"the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident\",<ref name=\"anderson\">{{cite book| last = Anderson | first = Clinton P. | author-link = Clinton Presba Anderson\n  | title = Apollo 204 Accident: Report of the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, United States Senate, with Additional Views | volume = Senate Report 956\n  | place = Washington, D.C. | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office\n  | date = January 30, 1968\n  | url = http://klabs.org/richcontent/Reports/Failure_Reports/as-204/senate_956/index.htm\n  |ref=Anderson\n  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220043317/http://klabs.org/richcontent/Reports/Failure_Reports/as-204/senate_956/index.htm\n  |archivedate=December 20, 2014 }}</ref>{{rp|7}} but stated in its recommendations:\n<blockquote>Notwithstanding that in NASA's judgment the contractor later made significant progress in overcoming the problems, the committee believes it should have been informed of the situation.

Brooke III]] and [[Charles H.

Mondale wrote his own, even more strongly worded Additional View, accusing NASA of \"evasiveness, \u2026 lack of candor, \u2026 patronizing attitude toward Congress, \u2026 refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate Congressional inquiries, and \u2026 solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy.\"<ref name=\"anderson\"/>{{rp|16}}\n\nThe potential political threat to Apollo blew over, due in large part to the support of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who at the time still wielded a measure of influence with the Congress from his own Senatorial experience. He was a staunch supporter of NASA since its inception, had even recommended the Moon program to President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1961, and was skilled at portraying it as part of Kennedy's legacy.\n\nRelations between NASA and North American deteriorated over assignment of blame. North American argued unsuccessfully it was not responsible for the fatal error in spacecraft atmosphere design. Finally, Webb contacted Atwood, and demanded either he or Chief Engineer [[Harrison Storms|Harrison A. Storms]] resign.

The Command Module was found to be extremely hazardous and, in some instances, carelessly assembled (for example, a misplaced socket wrench was found in the cabin).<ref name=\"aibreport\" />{{rp|5\u201310}}\n\nIt was decided that remaining Block I spacecraft would be used only for unmanned Saturn V test flights. All manned missions would use the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Major differences between Block I and Block II|Block II spacecraft]], to which many Command Module design changes were made:\n* The cabin atmosphere at launch was adjusted to 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen at sea-level pressure: {{convert|14.7|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}. During ascent the cabin rapidly vented down to {{convert|5|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}, releasing approximately 2/3 of the gas originally present at launch. The vent then closed and the environmental control system maintained a nominal cabin pressure of {{convert|5|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} as the spacecraft continued into vacuum. The cabin was then very slowly purged (vented to space and simultaneously replaced with 100% oxygen), so the nitrogen concentration fell asymptotically to zero over the next day. Although the new cabin launch atmosphere was significantly safer than 100% oxygen, it still contained almost three times the amount of oxygen present in ordinary sea level air (20.9% oxygen). This was necessary to ensure a sufficient partial pressure of oxygen when the astronauts removed their helmets after reaching orbit. (60% of 5 psi is 3 psi, compared to 20.9% of {{convert|14.7|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|3.07|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} in sea-level air.)<ref name=\"chariot\"/>\n* The environment within the astronauts' pressure suits was not changed. Because of the rapid drop in cabin (and suit) pressures during ascent, [[decompression sickness]] was likely unless the nitrogen had been purged from the astronauts' tissues before launch. They would still breathe pure oxygen, starting several hours before launch, until they removed their helmets on orbit. Avoiding the \"bends\" was considered worth the residual risk of an oxygen-accelerated fire within a suit.<ref name=\"chariot\"/>\n* Nylon used in the [[Gemini space suit|Block I suits]] was replaced in the [[Apollo/Skylab A7L|Block II suits]] with [[Beta cloth]], a non-flammable, highly melt-resistant fabric woven from [[Glass (fiber)|fiberglass]] and coated with Teflon.<ref name=\"chariot\">{{cite web |url= http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch9-4.html|title=The Slow Recovery|last1= Brooks|first1=Courtney|last2= Grimwood|first2= James|last3=Swenson|first3=Loyd|date= 1979|publisher= NASA|access-date= 2016-05-14}}</ref>\n* Block II had already been planned to use a completely redesigned hatch which opened outward, and could be opened in less than five seconds.<ref name=\"chariot\"/> Concerns of accidental opening were addressed by using a cartridge of pressurized nitrogen to drive the release mechanism in an emergency, instead of the [[explosive bolt]]s used on Project Mercury.\n* Flammable materials in the cabin were replaced with self-extinguishing versions.\n* Plumbing and wiring were covered with protective [[thermal insulation|insulation]].

Cooper, Slayton noted, had a very small chance of receiving the Apollo 13 command if he did an outstanding job with the assignment, which he did not. Eisele, despite his issues with management, was always intended for future assignment to the [[Apollo Applications Program]] (which was eventually cut down to only the [[Skylab]] component) and not a lunar mission.<ref>[[#Slayton & Cassutt|Slayton & Cassutt 1994]], p. 236</ref>\n\n==Objectives==\n{| {{Table|class=floatright}}\n|-\n!  !!

Apollo 10 was the first mission to carry a [[color television]] camera inside the spacecraft, and made the first live color TV transmissions from space.\n\nAfter reaching lunar orbit three days later, Young remained in the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]] (CM) ''Charlie Brown'' while Stafford and Cernan entered the LM ''Snoopy'' and flew it separately.

They surveyed the landing site in the [[Sea of Tranquility]], then separated the descent stage and fired the [[Ascent Propulsion System|ascent engine]] to return to ''Charlie Brown''. The descent stage was left in orbit, but eventually crashed onto the lunar surface because of the Moon's non-uniform gravitational field; its location was not tracked.\n\nUpon descent stage separation and ascent engine ignition, the Lunar Module began to roll violently because the crew accidentally duplicated commands into the flight computer which took the LM out of abort mode, the correct configuration for this maneuver.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{YouTube|id=fsObsxU08ys|title=\"Astronaut Gene Cernan Interview on Apollo 10 - (December 23, 2009)\"|link=no}}</ref> The live network broadcasts caught Cernan and Stafford uttering several expletives before regaining control of the LM.

The idea was to give children a way to identify with the mission by using humor.<ref>{{cite news |title=Young Takes Rover for a Spin |first=Michael |last=Shinabery |url=http://moonandback.com/2012/09/30/young-takes-rover-for-a-spin-this-week-in-space-history/ |date=September 30, 2012 |work=moonandback.com |publisher=Moonandback Media LLC |location=Sacramento, CA |page=Part 2 of 3 |nopp=y |accessdate=July 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dreamsofspace.blogspot.com/2010/12/apollo-16-poster-with-casper-friendly.html |title=Apollo 16 poster with Casper the Friendly Ghost (1972) |last=Sisson |first=John |date=December 13, 2010 |website=Dreams of Space |type=Blog |accessdate=July 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Hardware disposition==\nThe Command Module ''Charlie Brown'' is currently on loan to the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in London, where it is on display.

A CSM circles the Moon as an LM ascent stage flies up from its low pass over the lunar surface with its engine firing. The Earth is visible in the background.

Mission commander [[Pete Conrad|Charles \"Pete\" Conrad]] and Lunar Module Pilot [[Alan Bean|Alan L.

The landing site for the mission was located in the southeastern portion of the [[Ocean of Storms]].\n\nUnlike the first landing on Apollo 11, Conrad and Bean achieved a precise landing at their expected location, the site of the ''[[Surveyor 3]]'' unmanned probe, which had landed on April 20, 1967. They carried the first color television camera to the lunar surface on an Apollo flight, but transmission was lost after Bean accidentally destroyed the camera by pointing it at the Sun. On one of two moonwalks, they visited the ''Surveyor'' and removed some parts for return to Earth. The mission ended on November 24 with a successful [[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]].\n\n==Crew==\n{{Spaceflight crew\n|terminology = Astronaut\n|position1 = Commander\n|crew1_up = [[Pete Conrad|Charles \"Pete\" Conrad Jr.]]<ref name=\"smith\" />\n|flights1_up = Third\n|position2 = Command Module Pilot\n|crew2_up = [[Richard F.

It was the first rocket launch attended by an incumbent US president, [[Richard Nixon]]. Thirty-six-and-a-half seconds after lift-off, the vehicle triggered a [[lightning]] discharge through itself and down to the Earth through the Saturn's ionized plume. Protective circuits on the [[fuel cell]]s in the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Module (SM)|Service Module]] (SM) detected overloads and took all three fuel cells offline, along with much of the Command/Service Module (CSM) instrumentation. A second strike at 52 seconds after launch knocked out the \"8-ball\" [[attitude indicator]]. The [[telemetry]] stream at [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#Houston (1965\u2013present)|Mission Control]] was garbled. However, the vehicle continued to fly correctly; the strikes had not affected the [[Saturn V Instrument Unit]].\n\nThe loss of all three fuel cells put the CSM entirely on batteries, which were unable to maintain normal 75-ampere launch loads on the 28-volt DC bus. One of the [[Inverter (electrical)|AC inverter]]s dropped offline. These power supply problems lit nearly every warning light on the control panel and caused much of the instrumentation to malfunction.\n\n[[Flight controller#Electrical, Environmental and Consumables Manager (EECOM)|Electrical, Environmental and Consumables Manager (EECOM)]] [[John Aaron]] remembered the telemetry failure pattern from an earlier test when a power supply malfunctioned in the CSM Signal Conditioning Electronics (SCE), which converted raw signals from instrumentation to standard voltages for the spacecraft instrument displays and telemetry encoders.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kranz |first1=Eugene F. |authorlink1=Gene Kranz |last2=Covington |first2=James Otis |title=What Made Apollo a Success? |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-287/sp287.htm |accessdate=November 7, 2011 |origyear=\"A series of eight articles reprinted by permission from the March 1970 issue of ''Astronautics & Aeronautics'', a publication of the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]].\" |year=1971 |work=NASA History Program Office |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=69849598 |id=NASA SP-287 |chapter=Flight Control in the Apollo Program |chapterurl=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-287/ch5.htm}} Chapter 5.</ref>\n\nAaron made a call, \"Flight, EECOM.

Once in Earth [[parking orbit]], the crew carefully checked out their spacecraft before re-igniting the [[S-IVB]] third stage for [[trans-lunar injection]]. The lightning strikes had caused no serious permanent damage.\n\nInitially, it was feared that the lightning strike could have caused the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]]'s (CM) parachute mechanism to prematurely fire, disabling the explosive bolts that open the parachute compartment to deploy them.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} If they were indeed disabled, the Command Module would have crashed uncontrollably into the [[Pacific Ocean]] and killed the crew instantly. Since there was no way to figure out whether or not this was the case, ground controllers decided not to tell the astronauts about the possibility. The parachutes deployed and functioned normally at the end of the mission.\n\nAfter [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) separation, the S-IVB was intended to fly into solar orbit. The S-IVB auxiliary propulsion system was fired, and the remaining propellants vented to slow it down to fly past the Moon's trailing edge (the Apollo spacecraft always approached the Moon's leading edge). The Moon's gravity would then slingshot the stage into solar orbit. However, a small error in the state vector in the Saturn's guidance system caused the S-IVB to fly past the Moon at too high an altitude to achieve Earth escape velocity. It remained in a semi-stable Earth orbit after passing the Moon on November 18, 1969. It finally escaped Earth orbit in 1971 but was briefly recaptured in Earth orbit 31 years later. It was discovered by amateur astronomer [[William Kwong Yu Yeung|Bill Yeung]] who gave it the temporary designation [[J002E3]] before it was determined to be an artificial object.<ref name=NASA>{{cite news|url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news136.html |title=J002E3: An Update  |publisher=nasa.gov |first1=Paul |last1=Chodas |first2=Steve |last2=Chesley|date=October 9, 2002 |accessdate=September 18, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Jorgensen>{{cite journal |last1=Jorgensen |first1=K. |last2=Rivkin |first2=A. |last3=Binzel |first3=R. |last4=Whitely |first4=R. |last5=Hergenrother |first5=C. |last6=Chodas |first6=P. |last7=Chesley |first7=S. |last8=Vilas |first8=F |title=Observations of J002E3: Possible Discovery of an Apollo Rocket Body |journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society |date =May 2003 |volume=35 |page=981 |bibcode = 2003DPS....35.3602J}}</ref>\n\n===Moon landing===\n[[File:Lunar module AS12-51-7507.jpg|right|thumb|Lunar Module above the Moon]]\n[[Image:Apollo 12 landing site 3154 h2.jpg|thumb|left|High-resolution [[Lunar Orbiter 3]] image of the Apollo 12 landing site at center, used in mission planning.

The [[International Astronomical Union]], recognizing this, christened this region ''[[Mare Cognitum]] (Known Sea)''. The [[Selenographic coordinates|Lunar coordinates]] of the landing site were 3.01239\u00b0 S latitude, 23.42157\u00b0 W longitude.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/collections/imagery/apollo/landsites.htm |title=Landing Sites |work=The Apollo Program |publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]] |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> The landing site would thereafter be listed as ''Statio Cognitum'' on lunar maps. Conrad and Bean did not formally name their landing site, though Conrad nicknamed the intended touchdown area \"Pete's Parking Lot\".\n\nThe second lunar landing was an exercise in precision targeting, which would be needed for future Apollo missions. Most of the descent was automatic, with manual control assumed by Conrad during the final few hundred feet of descent. Unlike Apollo 11, where [[Neil Armstrong]] had to use the manual control to direct his lander downrange of the computer's target which was strewn with boulders, Apollo 12 succeeded in landing at its intended target \u2013 within walking distance of the ''Surveyor 3'' probe, which had landed on the Moon in April 1967.<ref name=\"Chaikin 1995\">[[#Chaikin|Chaikin 1995]]</ref> This was the first \u2013 and, to date, only \u2013 occasion in which humans have \"caught up\" to a probe sent to land on another world.\n\nConrad actually landed ''Intrepid'' {{convert|580|ft|m|round=5|0}} short of \"Pete's Parking Lot\", because it looked rougher during final approach than anticipated, and was a little under {{convert|1180|ft|m|round=5|0}} from ''Surveyor 3'', a distance that was chosen to eliminate the possibility of lunar dust (being kicked up by ''Intrepid's'' descent engine during landing) from covering ''Surveyor 3''.<ref name=\"autogenerated1969\">{{cite news |title=1969 Year in Review: Apollo 11 |url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1969/Apollo-11/12303189849225-2/ |work=UPI.com |publisher=[[United Press International]] |year=1969 |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> But the actual touchdown point \u2013 approximately {{convert|600|ft|m|round=5|0}}  from ''Surveyor 3'' \u2013 did cause high velocity sandblasting of the probe.

The instruments were part of the first complete nuclear-powered [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package|ALSEP]] station set up by astronauts on the Moon to relay long-term data from the lunar surface. The instruments on Apollo 11 were not as extensive or designed to operate long term. The astronauts also took photographs, although by accident Bean left several rolls of exposed film on the lunar surface. Meanwhile, Gordon, on board the ''Yankee Clipper'' in lunar orbit, took multi-spectral photographs of the surface.\n\n[[Image:a12-plaque.jpg|right|thumb|Replica of the plaque attached to the Apollo 12 LM]]\n\nThe [[lunar plaque]] attached to the descent stage of ''Intrepid'' is unique in that unlike the other plaques, it (a) did not have a depiction of the Earth, and (b) it was textured differently: The other plaques had black lettering on polished stainless steel while the Apollo 12 plaque had the lettering in polished stainless steel while the background was brushed flat.\n\n===Return===\n[[File:SH-3D of HS-4 flies over Apollo 12 command module near USS Hornet (CVS-12) on 24 November 1969.jpg|thumb|Apollo 12 recovery by {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}]]\n\n''Intrepid's'' ascent stage was dropped (per normal procedures) after Conrad and Bean rejoined Gordon in orbit.

NASA's long-range cameras, based 60 miles south in [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]], had a clear shot of the remainder of the launch. Following the launch, the [[Launch Control Center]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]] was visited by [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] [[Spiro Agnew|Spiro T. Agnew]], [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Prince Juan Carlos]] of [[Spain]], and his wife, [[Queen Sof\u00eda of Spain|Princess Sof\u00eda]].\n\nAt the beginning of the mission, the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|CSM]] ''Kitty Hawk'' had difficulty achieving capture and docking with the [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] ''Antares''. Repeated attempts to dock went on for 1 hour and 42 minutes, until it was suggested that Roosa hold ''Kitty Hawk'' against ''Antares'' using its thrusters, then the docking probe would be retracted out of the way, hopefully triggering the docking latches. The sixth attempt was successful, and no further docking problems were encountered during the mission.\n\n===Lunar descent===\nAfter separating from the Command Module in lunar orbit, the LM ''Antares'' also had two serious problems. First, the LM computer began getting an ABORT signal from a faulty switch. NASA believed that the computer might be getting erroneous readings like this if a tiny ball of solder had shaken loose and was floating between the switch and the contact, closing the circuit. The immediate solution&nbsp;\u2014 tapping on the panel next to the switch&nbsp;\u2014 did work briefly, but the circuit soon closed again. If the problem recurred after the descent engine fired, the computer would think the signal was real and would initiate an auto-abort, causing the [[Apollo Lunar Module#Ascent stage|ascent stage]] to separate from the [[Apollo Lunar Module#Descent stage|descent stage]] and climb back into orbit. NASA and the software teams at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] scrambled to find a solution, and determined the fix would involve reprogramming the flight software to ignore the false signal. The [[patch (computing)|software modifications]] were transmitted to the crew via voice communication, and Mitchell manually entered the changes (amounting to over 80 keystrokes on the LM computer pad) just in time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/video/aerospace/space-flight/don-eyles-space-hacker |publisher=''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'' |title=Don Eyles: Space Hacker |first=Stephen |last=Cass |first2=Christina |last2=Dabney |date=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA second problem occurred during the powered descent, when the LM [[Doppler radar|landing radar]] failed to lock automatically onto the Moon's surface, depriving the navigation computer of vital information on the vehicle's altitude and vertical descent speed (this was not a result of the modifications to the ABORT command; rather, the post-mission report indicated it was an unrelated bug in the radar's operation). After the astronauts cycled the landing radar breaker, the unit successfully acquired a signal near {{convert|18000|ft|m}}, again just in time. Shepard then manually landed the LM closer to its intended target than any of the other five Moon landing missions. Mitchell believed that Shepard would have continued with the landing attempt without the radar, using the LM inertial guidance system and visual cues. A post-flight review of the descent data showed the inertial system alone would have been inadequate, and the astronauts probably would have been forced to abort the landing as they approached the surface.\n\n===Lunar surface operations===\n[[Image:a14-plaque.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lunar plaque|plaque]] left on the Moon by Apollo 14]]\nShepard and Mitchell named their landing site ''Fra Mauro Base'', and this designation is recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (depicted in Latin on lunar maps as ''Statio Fra Mauro'').\n\nShepard's first words, after stepping onto the lunar surface were, \"And it's been a long way, but we're here.\" Unlike [[Neil Armstrong]] on [[Apollo 11]] and [[Pete Conrad]] on Apollo 12, Shepard had already stepped off the LM footpad and was a few yards away before he spoke.\n\nShepard's moonwalking suit was the first to utilize red stripes on the arms and legs and on the top of the lunar EVA sunshade \"hood,\" so as to allow easy identification between the commander and LM pilot on the surface;<ref>{{cite journal |last=von Braun |first=Wernher |authorlink=Wernher von Braun |title=Space Suits\u2014from Pressurized Prison to Mini-Spacecraft |date=July 1972 |journal=[[Popular Science]] |page=121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZ6okH8FCs4C&lpg=PA121&dq=space%20suits%20red%20bands&pg=PA121#v=onepage&q=space%20suits%20red%20bands&f=false |accessdate=July 17, 2013}}</ref> on the [[Apollo 12]] pictures, it had been almost impossible to distinguish between the two crewmen, causing a great deal of confusion. This feature was included on [[Jim Lovell]]'s Apollo 13 suit; because no landing was made on that mission, Apollo 14 was the first to make use of it. This feature was used for the remaining Apollo missions, and for the EVAs of [[Space Shuttle]] flights afterwards, and it is still in use today on both the U.S. and Russian [[space suit]]s on the [[International Space Station]].\n\nAfter landing in the Fra Mauro formation\u2014the destination for Apollo 13\u2014Shepard and Mitchell took two moonwalks, adding new [[Apollo 14 Passive Seismic Experiment|seismic studies]]<ref>Brzostowski and Brzostowski, pp 414-416</ref> to the by now familiar [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP), and using the [[Modular Equipment Transporter]] (MET), a pull-cart for carrying equipment and samples, nicknamed \"lunar rickshaw\". Roosa, meanwhile, took pictures from on board Command Module ''Kitty Hawk'' in lunar orbit.\n\nThe second moonwalk, or EVA, was intended to reach the rim of the {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} wide Cone Crater. The two astronauts were not able to find the rim amid the rolling terrain of the crater's slopes. They became physically exhausted from the attempt and with their suits' oxygen supplies starting to run low, the effort was called off. Later analysis, using the pictures that they took, determined that they had come within an estimated {{convert|65|ft|m}} of the crater's rim. Images from the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (LRO) show the tracks of the astronauts and the MET come to within 30&nbsp;m of the rim.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/91-Trail-of-Discovery-at-Fra-Mauro.html |title = Trail of Discovery at Fra Mauro |last=Lawrence |first=Samuel |date=August 19, 2009 |work=Featured Images |publisher=LROC News System |location=Tempe, Arizona}}</ref>\n[[Image:Apollo 14 golf.jpg|thumb|right|The lunar surface [[Apollo TV camera|television]] broadcast Alan Shepard taking a couple of [[Golf#Stroke mechanics|golf swings]] on the Moon]]\n\nShepard and Mitchell deployed and activated various scientific instruments and experiments and collected almost {{convert|100|lb|kg}} of lunar samples for return to Earth. Other Apollo 14 achievements included the only use of MET; longest distance traversed by foot on the lunar surface; first use of shortened lunar orbit rendezvous techniques; and the first extensive orbital science period conducted during CSM solo operations.\n\nThe astronauts also engaged in less serious activities on the Moon. Shepard brought along a [[Golf club#Iron|six iron golf club head]] which he could attach to the handle of a lunar excavation tool, and two golf balls, and took several one-handed swings (due to the limited flexibility of the EVA suit). He exuberantly exclaimed that the second ball went \"miles and miles and miles\" in the low lunar [[gravity]], but later estimated the distance as {{convert|200|to|400|yd|sp=us}}. Mitchell then threw a lunar scoop handle as if it were a [[Javelin throw|javelin]].\n\n===Return, splashdown and quarantine===\n[[File:Apollo14 - Landung.jpg|thumb|Apollo 14 landing]]\nOn the way back to Earth, the crew conducted the first U.S. materials processing experiments in space.\n\nThe Command Module ''Kitty Hawk'' splashed down in the South Pacific Ocean on February 9, 1971 at 21:05 [UTC], approximately {{convert|760|nmi|km}} south of [[American Samoa]]. After recovery by the ship [[USS New Orleans (LPH-11)|USS ''New Orleans'']], the crew was flown to [[Pago Pago International Airport]] in [[Tafuna, American Samoa|Tafuna]] for a reception before being flown on a [[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter|C-141]] cargo plane to [[Honolulu]]. The Apollo 14 astronauts were the last lunar explorers to be [[Mobile Quarantine Facility|quarantined]] on their return from the Moon.\n\nRoosa, who worked in forestry in his youth, took several hundred tree seeds on the flight. These were germinated after the return to Earth, and widely distributed around the world as commemorative [[Moon tree]]s.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/moon_tree.html| title=The 'Moon Trees'| first=David R.| last=Williams| publisher=NASA| work=[[Goddard Space Flight Center]]| date=28 July 2009| accessdate=July 17, 2013}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Mission insignia ==\n[[File:Apollo 14 Flown Silver Robbins Medallion (SN-192).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Apollo 14 space-flown silver [[NASA space-flown Gemini and Apollo medallions|Robbins medallion]]]]\nThe oval insignia shows a gold NASA [[Astronaut badge#NASA astronaut pins|Astronaut Pin]], given to U.S. astronauts upon completing their first space flight, traveling from the Earth to the Moon.

The mission landed near [[Mons Hadley|Hadley rille]], in an area of the [[Mare Imbrium]] called ''Palus Putredinus'' (Marsh of Decay). The crew explored the area using the first lunar rover, which allowed them to travel much farther from the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) than had been possible on missions without the rover. They collected {{convert|77|kg}} of lunar surface material. At the same time, Command Module Pilot [[Alfred Worden]] orbited the Moon, using a Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) in the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Module (SM)|Service Module]] (SM) to study the lunar surface and environment in great detail with a panoramic camera, a [[Gamma ray spectrometer|gamma-ray spectrometer]], a mapping camera, a laser [[altimeter]], a [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]], and a lunar subsatellite deployed at the end of Apollo 15's stay in [[lunar orbit]] (an Apollo program first).\n\nThe mission successfully accomplished its objectives, but was marred by negative publicity that accompanied disclosure of [[Apollo 15 postage stamp incident|the crew carrying unauthorized postage stamps]] which they had planned to sell after their return.  Ironically, this mission was one of very few that had been honored with the issue of [[U.S. space exploration history on U.S. stamps#Space Achievement Decade Issue of 1971|a commemorative US stamp]], with this first use of a lunar rover happening one decade after the [[Mercury-Redstone 3|launch of the first manned Mercury mission]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{Further|Apollo program}}\nIn 1962, [[NASA]] contracted for fifteen [[Saturn V]] Moon rockets to achieve the Apollo program's goal of a manned landing on the Moon by 1970; at the time no one knew how many missions would be required to achieve this.{{sfn|Chaikin|pp=232\u2013233}} Since success was obtained with the sixth Saturn V on [[Apollo 11]], nine rockets remained available for a [[Canceled Apollo missions#Follow-on lunar missions|plan of ten total lunar landings]]. These plans included a heavier, extended version of the [[Apollo spacecraft]] to be used in the last five missions (Apollo 16-20). The extensions included a package of lunar orbital experiments carried in the Service Module, and an extended [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] capable of up to 75-hour stays and carrying a [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] to the lunar surface. In the original plan, Apollo 15 was to be the last of the non-extended missions, to land in [[Censorinus (crater)|Censorinus crater]]. But in anticipation of budget cuts, NASA cancelled the last three landing missions by September 1970. Apollo 15 became the first of three extended missions, known as J missions, and the landing site was moved to [[Hadley Rille]], originally planned for Apollo 19.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apollo 18 through 20 - The Cancelled Missions|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_18_20.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Crew and key Mission Control personnel ==\n{{Spaceflight crew\n|terminology      = Astronaut\n|position1        = Commander\n|crew1_up         = [[David Scott|David R.

Schmitt realized that what was needed was an expert teacher who could fire the astronauts' enthusiasm, and contacted Caltech geologist [[Leon Silver|Lee Silver]], whom Schmitt introduced to [[Apollo 13]] mission commander [[Jim Lovell]] and Lunar Module Pilot [[Fred Haise]], then in training for their mission. Lovell and Haise were willing to go on a field expedition with Silver, and geology became a significant part of their training. Geologist [[Farouk El-Baz]] trained the prime crew's Command Module Pilot, [[Ken Mattingly]] to inform his planned observations from lunar orbit. The crew's newly-acquired skills mostly went unused, due to the explosion that damaged the Apollo 13 spacecraft.{{efn|Mattingly was replaced before launch by [[Jack Swigert]].}} Apollo 14's CMP, [[Stu Roosa]], was enthusiastic about geology, but the mission commander, [[Alan Shepard]], less so.{{sfn|Chaikin|pp=387\u2013396}}\n\nScott, once assigned as Apollo 15 commander, was determined that his crew bring back the maximum amount of scientific data possible, and met with Silver in April 1970 to begin planning the geological training. The assignment of Schmitt as Apollo 15's backup LMP made him an insider, and allowed him to spark competition between the prime and backup crews. The cancellation of two Apollo missions in September 1970 transformed Apollo 15 into a J mission, with a longer stay on the lunar surface, and the first [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV). This change was welcomed by Scott,{{sfn|Chaikin|pp=397\u2013402}} who according to David West Reynolds in his account of the Apollo Program, was \"something more than a hotshot pilot. Scott had the spirit of a true explorer,\" one determined to get the most from the J mission.{{sfn|Reynolds|p=171}} The additional need for communications, including from experiments in the Command Module and from the rover, required the near-rebuilding of the [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station]] in Australia.{{sfn|Lindsay|p=303}}\n\nGeology field trips took place about once a month, throughout the crew's 20 months of training. At first Silver would take the commanders and LMPs from the prime and backup crews to various geological sites in Arizona and New Mexico as if for a normal field geology lesson, but closer to launch, these trips became more realistic. Crews began to wear mock-ups of the backpacks they would carry, and communicate using [[walkie-talkie]]s to a CAPCOM in a tent. (During a mission the [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM)|Capsule Communicators]] (CAPCOMs), always fellow astronauts, were the only people who normally would speak to the crew.) The CAPCOM was accompanied by a geologist unfamiliar with the area who would rely on the astronauts' descriptions to interpret the findings, and familiarized the crew members with describing landscapes to people who could not see them.{{sfn|Scott & Leonov|loc=4490\u20134513}}<!-- Kindle location, Chapter 9, paragraph beginning \"Lee Silver was an inspiring teacher\" through \"Once our knowledge--> Considering himself a serious amateur, Scott came to enjoy field geology.{{sfn|Compton|p=236}}\n\nThe decision to land at Hadley came in September 1970. The Site Selection Committees had narrowed the field down to two sites \u2014 Hadley Rille, a deep channel on the edge of [[Mare Imbrium]] close to the [[Montes Apenninus|Apennine mountains]] or the crater [[Marius (crater)|Marius]], near which were a [[Marius Hills|group of low, possibly volcanic, domes]]. Although not ultimately his decision, the commander of a mission always held great sway.{{sfn|Chaikin|pp=402\u2013403}} To David Scott the choice was clear, as Hadley \"had more variety.

Working with El-Baz, he studied maps and photographs of the craters he would pass over while orbiting alone in the CSM. As El-Baz listened and gave feedback, Worden learned how to describe lunar features in a way that would be useful to the scientists who would listen to his transmissions back on Earth. Worden found El-Baz to be an enjoyable and inspiring teacher. In addition, Worden usually accompanied his crewmates on their geology field trips, though he was often in an airplane overhead, describing features of the landscape as the plane simulated the speed at which the lunar landscape would pass below the CSM.{{sfn|Worden|loc=2373\u20132408}}<!--Chapter 7, \"while Dave and Jim\" to \"I went on almost all\"  -->\n\nThe demands of the training strained Worden's marriage and also that of Irwin; each sought Scott's advice, fearing that divorce might endanger their places on the mission as not projecting the image NASA wanted for the astronauts.

Part of this was due to an error in the landing path of some {{convert|3000|ft}}, of which the CAPCOM, [[Ed Mitchell]] informed the crew prior to pitchover; part because the craters Scott had relied on in the simulator were difficult to make out under lunar conditions, and he initially could not see Hadley Rille.

As a satellite passes 50 or 60 miles overhead, the mascons pull it forward, back, left, right, or down, the exact direction and magnitude of the tugging depends on the satellite's trajectory. Absent any periodic boosts from onboard rockets to correct the orbit, most satellites released into low lunar orbits (under about 60 miles or 100 km) will eventually crash into the Moon. ... [There are] a number of 'frozen orbits' where a spacecraft can stay in a low lunar orbit indefinitely. They occur at four inclinations: 27\u00b0, 50\u00b0, 76\u00b0, and 86\u00b0\"\u2014the last one being nearly over the lunar poles. The orbit of the relatively long-lived Apollo 15 subsatellite [[PFS-1]] had an inclination of 28\u00b0, which turned out to be close to the inclination of one of the frozen orbits\u2014but poor PFS-2 was cursed with an inclination of only 11\u00b0.''}}</ref>\n\nReleasing the subsatellite was the crew's final activity in lunar orbit, occurring an hour before the burn to take them back to Earth. A \n[[PFS-2|virtually identical subsatellite]] was deployed by [[Apollo 16]].\n\n===Launch vehicle===\nThe [[Saturn V]] that launched Apollo 15 was designated SA-510, the tenth flight-ready model of the rocket. As the payload of the rocket was greater, changes were made to the rocket and to its launch trajectory. It was launched in a more southerly direction (80\u2013100 degrees [[azimuth]]) than that of previous missions, and the Earth [[parking orbit]] was lowered to {{convert|166|km|nmi||abbr=off|sp=us}}. These two changes meant {{convert|1100|lb|kg}} more could be launched. The [[propellant]] reserves were reduced and the number of retrorockets on the S-IC first stage (used to separate the spent first stage from the S-II second stage) reduced from eight to four. The four outboard engines of the S-IC would be burned longer and the center engine would also burn longer before being shut down (see [[Saturn V]] for more information on the launch sequence). Changes were also made to the S-II to stop [[pogo oscillation]]s.<ref name=presskit/>\n\nOnce all the various components had been installed on the Saturn V, it was moved to the launch site, Launch Complex 39A. During late June and early July 1971, the rocket and Launch Umbilical Tower (LUT) were struck by [[lightning]] at least four times. All was well however, with only minor damage suffered.\n\n===Space suits===\n[[File:Apollo 15 Space Suit David Scott.jpg|thumb|upright|David Scott's space suit on display at the [[National Air and Space Museum]]]]\nThe astronauts themselves wore new [[space suit]]s. On all previous Apollo flights, including the non-lunar flights, the commander and lunar module pilot had worn suits with the life support, liquid cooling, and communications connections in two parallel rows of three. On Apollo 15, the new suits, dubbed the \"[[Apollo/Skylab A7L#A7LB Spacesuit (Apollo, Skylab and ASTP)|A7LB]],\" had the connectors situated in triangular pairs. This new arrangement, along with the relocation of the entry zipper (which went in an up-down motion on the old suits), from the right shoulder to the left hip, allowed the inclusion of a new waist joint, allowing the astronauts to bend completely over and to sit on the rover. Upgraded backpacks allowed for longer-duration moonwalks, and the Command Module Pilot, who wore a suit with three connectors, would wear a five-connector version of the old Moon suit \u2014 the liquid cooling water connector being removed, as the Command Module Pilot would make a \"deep-space EVA\" to retrieve film cartridges on the flight home.<ref name=presskit/>\n\n== Scandals ==\n{{further|Apollo 15 postal covers incident}}\n\nAfter a successful mission, the reputations of the crew and NASA were tarnished by a deal the crew had made with a German stamp dealer.<ref>{{cite news |title=Apollo's most controversial mission |first=Thom |last=Patterson |url=http://lightyears.blogs.cnn.com/2011/07/27/apollos-most-controversial-mission/ |work=Light Years |publisher=[[CNN]] |type=Blog |date=July 27, 2011 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> [[H. Walter Eiermann]], who had many professional and social contacts with NASA employees and the astronaut corps, arranged for Scott to carry unauthorized commemorative postal covers in his space suit, in addition to the postal covers NASA had contracted to carry for the [[United States Postal Service]]. Eiermann had promised each astronaut $7,000 in the form of savings accounts in return for 100 covers signed after having been on the Moon. He told the astronauts that he would not advertise or sell the covers until the end of the [[Apollo program]]. Irwin wrote in his book ''To Rule the Night'' that the astronauts had agreed to the deal as a way to help finance their children's college tuition.<ref>[[#Irwin & Emerson|Irwin & Emerson 1973]]</ref>{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nAnother controversy arose after the flight, caused by the ''[[Fallen Astronaut]]'' statuette that Scott had left on the Moon. The crew claim they had agreed with the sculptor, [[Paul Van Hoeydonck]], that no replicas were to be made, in order to satisfy NASA's aversion to commercial exploitation of the space program. After the sculpture's existence was publicly disclosed during their post-flight press conference, the [[National Air and Space Museum]] contacted the crew asking for a replica made for the museum. Van Hoeydonck, whose account of the agreement contradicts Scott's, subsequently advertised replicas for sale to the public.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Corey S.|last2=Shapiro|first2=Lauren G.|title=The Sculpture on the Moon|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/12/sculpture_on_the_moon_paul_van_hoeydonck_s_fallen_astronaut.html|website=Slate|publisher=The Slate Group|date=2013}}</ref> Under pressure from NASA, Van Hoeydonck withdrew the sale offer. <ref>{{harvnb|Van den Bussche|1980|pp=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\n== Mission insignia ==\n[[File:Apollo 15 Flown Silver Robbins Medallion (SN-92).jpg|thumb|Apollo 15 space-flown silver [[NASA space-flown Robbins medallions of the Apollo missions|Robbins medallion]]]]\nThe three astronauts of Apollo 15 were all United States Air Force active duty officers, and their patch carries Air Force motifs (just as the Apollo 12 all-Navy crew's patch had featured a sailing ship). The circular patch features stylized red, white and blue birds flying over the [[Hadley Rille]] section of the Moon. Immediately behind the birds, a line of craters form the [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] XV. The artwork is circled in red, with a white band giving the mission and crew names and a blue border. Scott contacted fashion designer [[Emilio Pucci]] to design the patch, who came up with the basic idea of the three-bird motif on a square patch. The crew changed the shape to round and the colors from blues and greens to a patriotic red, white and blue. Worden stated that each bird also represented an astronaut, white being his own color (and as Command Module Pilot, uppermost), with Scott the blue bird and Irwin the red. The Roman numeral design was created when NASA insisted that the mission number be displayed in [[Arabic numerals]].<ref>[[#Worden & French|Worden & French 2011]], pp. 144\u2013145</ref>\n\n== Visibility from space ==\nThe halo area of the Apollo 15 landing site, generated by the LM's exhaust plume, was observed by a camera aboard the Japanese lunar orbiter [[SELENE]] and confirmed by comparative analysis of photographs in May 2008.

Although previous Apollo expeditions, including Apollo 14 and [[Apollo 15]], obtained samples of pre-[[Lunar mare|mare]] lunar material, before [[lava]] began to upwell from the Moon's interior and flood the low areas and basins, none had actually visited the lunar highlands.<ref name=overview>{{cite web|title=Descartes Surprise|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.summary.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=26 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nApollo 14 had visited and sampled a ridge of material that had been ejected by the impact that created the [[Mare Imbrium|Mare Imbrium impact basin]]. Likewise, Apollo 15 had also sampled material in the region of Imbrium, visiting the basin's edge. There remained the possibility, because the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 landing sites were closely associated with the Imbrium basin, that different geologic processes were prevalent in areas of the lunar highlands far from Mare Imbrium. Several members of the scientific community remarked that the central lunar highlands resembled regions on Earth that were created by [[Volcanism|volcanic]] processes and hypothesized the same might be true on the Moon. They had hoped that scientific output from the Apollo 16 mission would provide an answer.<ref name=overview/>\n\n[[Image:Apollo 16 landing site AS16-M-0440.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Location of the Apollo 16 landing site]]\n[[Image:Apollo 16 landing site AS14-69-9535.jpg|thumb|left|Oblique closeup of the proposed Apollo 16 landing site as photographed by [[Apollo 14]] from lunar orbit. [[North Ray (crater)|North Ray]] crater is at left and [[South Ray (crater)|South Ray]] crater is at right, with bright rays.]]\n\nTwo locations on the Moon were given primary consideration for exploration by the Apollo 16 expedition: the [[Descartes Highlands]] region west of [[Mare Nectaris]] and the crater [[Alphonsus (crater)|Alphonsus]]. At Descartes, the Cayley and Descartes formations were the primary areas of interest in that scientists suspected, based on telescopic and orbital imagery, that the terrain found there was formed by magma more [[Viscosity|viscous]] than that which formed the lunar maria. The Cayley Formation's age was approximated to be about the same as Mare Imbrium based on the local frequency of impact craters. The considerable distance between the Descartes site and previous Apollo landing sites would be beneficial for the network of geophysical instruments,<ref>Brzostowski and Brzostowski, pp 414-416</ref> portions of which were deployed on each Apollo expedition beginning with [[Apollo 12]].<ref name=lpi>{{cite web|title=Landing Site Overview|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_16/landing_site/|work=Apollo 16 Mission|publisher=[[Lunar and Planetary Institute]]|accessdate=26 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nAt the Alphonsus, three scientific objectives were determined to be of primary interest and paramount importance: the possibility of old, pre-Imbrium impact material from within the crater's wall, the composition of the crater's interior and the possibility of past volcanic activity on the floor of the crater at several smaller \"dark halo\" craters. Geologists feared, however, that samples obtained from the crater might have been contaminated by the Imbrium impact, thus preventing Apollo 16 from obtaining samples of pre-Imbrium material. There also remained the distinct possibility that this objective had already been satisfied by the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 missions, as the Apollo 14 samples had not yet been completely analyzed and samples from Apollo 15 had not yet been obtained.<ref name=lpi/>\n\nIt was decided to target the Apollo 16 mission for the Descartes site. Following the decision, the Alphonsus site was considered the most likely candidate for Apollo 17, but was eventually rejected. With the assistance of orbital photography obtained on the Apollo 14 mission, the Descartes site was determined to be safe enough for a manned landing. The specific landing site was between two young impact craters, [[North Ray (crater)|North Ray]] and [[South Ray (crater)|South Ray]] craters &ndash; {{convert|1000|and|680|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}} in diameter, respectively &ndash; which provided \"natural drill holes\" which penetrated through the lunar [[regolith]] at the site, thus leaving exposed [[bedrock]] that could be sampled by the crew.<ref name=lpi/>\n\n[[File:Young and Duke train for Apollo 16.jpg|thumb|right|John Young and Charles Duke train at the [[Rio Grande Gorge]] in [[New Mexico]]]]\n\nAfter selecting the landing site for Apollo 16, sampling the Descartes and Cayley formations, two geologic units of the lunar highlands, was determined by mission planners to be the primary sampling interest of the mission. It was these formations that the scientific community widely suspected were formed by lunar volcanism, but this hypothesis was proven incorrect by the composition of lunar samples from the mission.<ref name=lpi/>\n\n===Training===\nIn preparing for their mission, in addition to the usual Apollo spacecraft training, Young and Duke, along with backup commander [[Fred Haise]], underwent an extensive [[geology|geological]] training program that included several field trips to introduce them to concepts and techniques they would use in analyzing features and collecting samples on the lunar surface.

On day two, the crew performed an [[electrophoresis]] experiment, also performed on Apollo 14, in which they attempted to prove the higher purity of particle migrations in the zero-gravity environment. The remainder of day two included a two-second mid-course correction burn performed by the Command/Service Module's [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Propulsion System|Service Propulsion System]] engine to tweak the spacecraft's trajectory. Later in the day, the astronauts entered the Lunar Module for the second time in the mission to further inspect the landing craft's systems. The crew reported they had observed additional paint peeling from a portion of the LM's outer aluminum skin. Despite this, the crew discovered that the spacecraft's systems were performing nominally. Following the LM inspection, the crew reviewed checklists and procedures for the following days in anticipation of their arrival and the [[Lunar orbit|Lunar Orbit Insertion]] burn. Command Module Pilot Mattingly reported a \"[[gimbal lock]]\" warning light, indicating the craft was not reporting an [[Attitude (aircraft)|attitude]]. Mattingly alleviated this by realigning the guidance system using the Sun and Moon.

The velocity of the craft steadily decreased, as it had not yet reached the lunar sphere of gravitational influence. The early part of day three was largely housekeeping, spacecraft maintenance and exchanging status reports with Mission Control in Houston. The crew performed the Apollo light flash experiment, or ALFMED, to investigate \"light flashes\" that were seen by the astronauts when the spacecraft was dark, regardless of whether or not their eyes were open, on Apollo lunar flights. This was thought to be caused by the penetration of the [[Human eye|eye]] by [[cosmic ray]] particles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apollo 16: Day Three Part One: ALFMED Experiment|url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap16fj/08_Day3_Pt1.htm|publisher=Apollo 16 Flight Journal|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=alfmed>{{cite web|title=Apollo Light Flash Investigations (AP009)|url=http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/experiment/exper.aspx?exp_index=380|work=Life Sciences Data Archive|publisher=NASA|accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> During the second half of the day, Young and Duke again entered the Lunar Module to power it up and check its systems, and perform housekeeping tasks in preparation for lunar landing. The systems were found to be functioning as expected. Following this, the crew donned their space suits and rehearsed procedures that would be used on landing day.

While over the [[far side of the Moon]], the Command/Service Module's Service Propulsion System engine burned for 6 minutes and 15 seconds, braking the spacecraft into an orbit around the Moon with a low point (pericynthion) of 58.3 and a high point (apocynthion) of 170.4 nautical miles (108.0 and 315.6&nbsp;km, respectively).<ref>{{cite web|title=Apollo 16: Day Four Part Two; Lunar Orbit Insertion, Rev One and Rev Two|url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap16fj/11_Day4_Pt2.htm|publisher=Apollo 16 Flight Journal|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref> After entering lunar orbit, the crew began preparations for the Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI) maneuver to further modify the spacecraft's orbital trajectory.

The boom that extended the [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] out from the Command/Service Module's Scientific Instruments Bay was stuck in a semi-deployed position. It was decided that Young and Duke would visually inspect the boom after undocking from the CSM in the LM. They entered the LM for activation and checkout of the spacecraft's systems. Despite entering the LM 40 minutes ahead of schedule, they completed preparations only 10 minutes early due to numerous delays in the process.<ref name=\"fullsummary\" /> With the preparations finished, they undocked in the LM ''Orion'' from Mattingly in the Command/Service Module ''Casper'' 96 hours, 13 minutes, 13 seconds into the mission.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apollo 16: Day Five Part Two: Lunar Module Undocking and Descent Preparation; Revs 11 and 12|url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap16fj/14_Day5_Pt2.htm|publisher=Apollo 16 Flight Journal|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref> For the rest of the two crafts' passes over the [[near side of the Moon]], Mattingly prepared to shift ''Casper'' to a circular orbit while Young and Duke prepared ''Orion'' for the descent to the lunar surface. At this point, during tests of the CSM's steerable rocket engine in preparation for the burn to modify the craft's orbit, a malfunction occurred in the engine's backup system. According to mission rules, ''Orion'' would have then re-docked with ''Casper'', in case Mission Control decided to abort the landing and use the Lunar Module's engines for the return trip to Earth. After several hours of analysis, however, mission controllers determined that the malfunction could be worked around and Young and Duke could proceed with the landing.<ref name=overview/> As a result of this, powered descent to the lunar surface began about six hours behind schedule. Because of the delay, Young and Duke began their descent to the surface at an altitude higher than that of any previous mission, at {{convert|20.1|km|nmi|sp=us}}. At an altitude of about {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}}, Young was able to view the landing site in its entirety. Throttle-down of the LM's landing engine occurred on time and the spacecraft tilted forward to its landing orientation at an altitude of {{convert|2200|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}}. The LM landed {{convert|270|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}} north and {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}} west of the planned landing site at 104 hours, 29 minutes, and 35 seconds into the mission, at 2:23:35 UTC on April 21.<ref name=\"fullsummary\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Landing at Descartes|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.landing.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter landing, Young and Duke began powering down some of the LM's systems to conserve battery power. Upon completing their initial adjustments, the pair configured ''Orion'' for their three-day stay on the lunar surface, removed their space suits and took initial geological observations of the immediate landing site. They then settled down for their first meal on the surface. After eating, they configured the cabin for their first sleep period on the Moon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Post-Landing Activities|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.postland.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Window Geology|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.window.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref> The landing delay caused by the malfunction in the Command/Service Module's main engine necessitated significant modifications to the mission schedule. Apollo 16 would spend one less day in lunar orbit after surface exploration had been completed to afford the crew contingency time to compensate for any further problems and to conserve expendables. In order to improve Young's and Duke's sleep schedule, the third and final moonwalk of the mission was trimmed from seven hours to five.<ref name=\"fullsummary\" />\n\nThe next morning, flight day five, Young and Duke ate breakfast and began preparations for the first extra-vehicular activity (EVA), or moonwalk.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wake-up for EVA-1|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1wake.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Preparations for EVA-1|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva1prep.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref> After the pair donned and pressurized their space suits and depressurized the Lunar Module cabin, Young climbed out onto the \"porch\" of the LM, a small platform above the ladder.

This was done without problems. On first driving the lunar rover, Young discovered that the rear steering was not working. He alerted Mission Control to the problem before setting up the television camera and planting the [[Lunar Flag Assembly|flag of the United States]] with Duke. The day's next task was to deploy the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP); while they were parking the lunar rover, on which the TV camera was mounted, to observe the deployment, the rear steering began functioning without explanation. While deploying a heat-flow experiment (that had burned up with the Lunar Module ''Aquarius'' on Apollo 13 and had been attempted with limited success on Apollo 15), a cable was inadvertently snapped after getting caught around Young's foot. After ALSEP deployment, they collected samples in the vicinity. About four hours after the beginning of EVA-1, they mounted the lunar rover and drove to the first geologic stop, Plum Crater, a {{convert|36|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=mid|-wide}} crater on the rim of [[Flag (crater)|Flag crater]], about {{convert|240|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}} across. There, at a distance of {{convert|1.4|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} from the LM, they sampled material from the vicinity of Flag Crater, which scientists believed penetrated through the upper [[regolith]] layer to the underlying Cayley Formation.

Bypassing station seven to save time, they arrived at station eight on the lower flank of Stone Mountain, where they sampled material on a ray from South Ray Crater for about an hour. There, they collected black and white breccias and smaller, [[crystal]]line rocks rich in [[plagioclase]]. At station nine, an area known as the \"Vacant Lot,\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Geology Station 9|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta9.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref> which was believed to be free of ejecta from [[South Ray (crater)|South Ray]], they spent about 40 minutes gathering samples. Twenty-five minutes after departing station nine, they arrived at the final stop of the day, halfway between the ALSEP site and the LM. There, they dug a double core and conducted several [[penetrometer]] tests along a line stretching {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} east of the ALSEP. At the request of Young and Duke, the moonwalk was extended by ten minutes. After returning to the LM to wrap up the second lunar excursion, they climbed back inside the landing craft's cabin, sealing and pressurizing the interior after 7 hours, 23 minutes, and 26 seconds of EVA time, breaking a record that had been set on Apollo 15.<ref name=honeysuckle/><ref>{{cite web|title=EVA-2 Closeout|url=http://next.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.clsout2.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=28 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026042001/http://next.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.clsout2.html|archivedate=26 October 2011|df=}}</ref> After eating a meal and proceeding with a debriefing on the day's activities with Mission Control, they reconfigured the LM cabin and prepared for the sleep period.<ref>{{cite web|title=Post-EVA-2 Activities and Goodnight|url=http://next.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva2post.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=28 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231519/http://next.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.eva2post.html|archivedate=25 April 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Charlie Duke near Shadow Rock, Apollo 16.jpg|thumb|left|John Young stands in the shadow of Shadow Rock]]\n[[File:House Rock AS16-106-17336HR.jpg|thumb|right|House Rock]]\n[[File:DUKE - AS16-117-18841.jpg|thumb|right|Charlie Duke left a photo of his family on the Moon.

During the third and final lunar excursion, they were to explore North Ray Crater, the largest of any of the craters any Apollo expedition had visited. After exiting ''Orion'', the pair drove the lunar rover {{convert|0.8|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} away from the LM before adjusting their heading to travel {{convert|1.4|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} to [[North Ray (crater)|North Ray]] Crater. The drive was smoother than that of the previous day, as the craters were shallower and boulders were less abundant north of the immediate landing site. After passing [[Palmetto (crater)|Palmetto]] crater, boulders gradually became larger and more abundant as they approached North Ray in the lunar rover. Upon arriving at the rim of [[North Ray (crater)|North Ray]] crater, they were {{convert|4.4|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} away from the LM. After their arrival, the duo took photographs of the {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} wide and {{convert|230|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}} deep crater. They visited a large boulder, taller than a four-story building, which became known as 'House Rock'. Samples obtained from this boulder delivered the final blow to the pre-mission volcanic hypothesis, proving it incorrect. House Rock had numerous bullet hole-like marks where [[micrometeoroid]]s from space had impacted the rock. About 1 hour and 22 minutes after arriving, they departed for station 13, a large boulder field about {{convert|0.5|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} from North Ray. On the way, they set a lunar speed record, traveling at an estimated {{convert|17.1|km/h|mph|sp=us}} downhill. They arrived at a {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}} high boulder, which they called 'Shadow Rock'. Here, they sampled permanently shadowed soil. During this time, Mattingly was preparing the Command/Service Module in anticipation of their return approximately six hours later. After three hours and six minutes, they returned to the LM, where they completed several experiments and offloaded the rover. A short distance from the LM, Duke placed a photograph of his family and a [[United States Air Force]] commemorative medallion on the surface.<ref name=honeysuckle/> Young drove the rover to a point about {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}} east of the LM, known as the 'VIP site,' so its television camera, controlled remotely by Mission Control, could observe Apollo 16's liftoff from the Moon.

Two minutes before launch, they activated the \"Master Arm\" switch and then the \"Abort Stage\" button, after which they awaited ignition of ''Orion''\u2019s [[Apollo Lunar Module#Ascent stage|ascent stage]] engine. When the ascent stage ignited, small explosive charges severed the ascent stage from the [[Apollo Lunar Module#Descent stage|descent stage]] and cables connecting the two were severed by a [[guillotine]]-like mechanism. Six minutes after liftoff, at a speed of about {{convert|5000|km/h|mph|sp=us}}, Young and Duke reached lunar orbit.<ref name=honeysuckle/><ref>{{cite web|title=Return to Orbit|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.launch.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref> Young and Duke successfully rendezvoused and re-docked with Mattingly in the Command/Service Module. To minimize the transfer of lunar dust from the LM cabin into the CSM, Young and Duke cleaned the cabin before opening the hatch separating the two spacecraft. After opening the hatch and reuniting with Mattingly, the crew transferred the samples Young and Duke had collected on the surface into the CSM for transfer to Earth. After transfers were completed, the crew would sleep before jettisoning the empty Lunar Module ascent stage the next day, when it was to be crashed intentionally into the lunar surface.<ref name=\"fullsummary\" />\n\nThe next day, after final checks were completed, the expended LM ascent stage was jettisoned.<ref name=lmjett>{{cite web|title=Apollo 16: Day 9 Part 2 - LM Jettison and Trans Earth Injection|url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap16fj/25_Day9_Pt2.htm|publisher=Apollo 16 Flight Journal|accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref> Because of a failure by the crew to activate a certain switch in the LM before sealing it off, it initially tumbled after separation and did not execute the rocket burn necessary for the craft's intentional de-orbit. The ascent stage eventually crashed into the lunar surface nearly a year after the mission. The crew's next task, after jettisoning the Lunar Module ascent stage, was to release a subsatellite into lunar orbit from the CSM's Scientific Instrument Bay. The burn to alter the CSM's orbit to that desired for the subsatellite had been cancelled; as a result, the subsatellite lasted half of its anticipated lifetime. Just under five hours later, on the CSM's 65th orbit around the Moon, its Service Propulsion System main engine was reignited to propel the craft on a trajectory that would return it to Earth. The SPS engine performed the burn flawlessly despite the malfunction that had delayed the lunar landing several days before.<ref name=\"fullsummary\" /><ref name=lmjett/>\n\n[[File:S72-37001.jpg|thumb|left|Ken Mattingly performs his deep-space EVA, retrieving film cassettes from the CSM's exterior]]\n\nAt a distance of about {{convert|170000|nmi|km|sp=us}} from Earth, Mattingly performed a \"deep-space\" extra-vehicular activity, or spacewalk, during which he retrieved several film cassettes from the CSM's SIM bay.

Its principal objective was to measure charged particles and magnetic fields all around the Moon as the Moon orbited Earth, similar to its sister spacecraft, [[PFS-1]], released eight months earlier by Apollo 15. \"The low orbits of both subsatellites were to be similar ellipses, ranging from {{convert|55|to|76|mi|km|abbr=off}} above the lunar surface.\"<ref name=nasa20061106/>\n\n\"Instead, something bizarre happened. The orbit of PFS-2 rapidly changed shape and distance from the Moon. In 2-1/2 weeks the satellite was swooping to within a hair-raising {{convert|6|mi|km}} of the lunar surface at closest approach. As the orbit kept changing, PFS-2 backed off again, until it seemed to be a safe 30 miles away. But not for long: inexorably, the subsatellite's orbit carried it back toward the Moon. And on May 29, 1972\u2014only 35 days and 425 orbits after its release\"\u2014PFS-2 crashed into the Lunar surface.<ref name=nasa20061106/>\n\nIn later years, through a study of many [[lunar orbit]]ing satellites, scientists came to discover that most [[Lunar orbit|low lunar orbit]]s (LLO) are unstable.

Since Apollo 17 was to be the final lunar landing of the Apollo program, high-priority landing sites that had not been visited previously were given consideration for potential exploration. A landing in the crater [[Copernicus (lunar crater)|Copernicus]] was considered, but was ultimately rejected because [[Apollo 12]] had already obtained samples from that impact, and three other Apollo expeditions had already visited the vicinity of Mare Imbrium. A landing in the lunar highlands near the crater [[Tycho (lunar crater)|Tycho]] was also considered, but was rejected because of the rough terrain found there and a landing on the [[Far side of the Moon|lunar far side]] in the crater [[Tsiolkovskiy (crater)|Tsiolkovskiy]] was rejected due to technical considerations and the operational costs of maintaining communication during surface operations. A landing in a region southwest of [[Mare Crisium]] was also considered, but rejected on the grounds that a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spacecraft could easily access the site; [[Luna 21]] eventually did so shortly after the Apollo 17 site selection was made.<ref name=lpi>{{cite web|title=Landing Site Overview|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_17/landing_site/|work=Apollo 17 Mission|publisher=[[Lunar and Planetary Institute]]|accessdate=23 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter the elimination of several sites, three sites made the final consideration for Apollo 17: [[Alphonsus (crater)|Alphonsus crater]], [[Gassendi (crater)|Gassendi crater]], and the Taurus-Littrow valley. In making the final landing site decision, mission planners took into consideration the primary objectives for Apollo 17: obtaining old highlands material from a substantial distance from Mare Imbrium, sampling material from young volcanic activity (i.e., less than three billion years), and having minimal ground overlap with the orbital ground tracks of Apollo 15 and Apollo 16 to maximize the amount of new data obtained.<ref name=lpi/>\n\nThe Taurus-Littrow site was selected with the prediction that the crew would be able to obtain samples of old highland material from the remnants of a landslide event that occurred on the south wall of the valley and the possibility of relatively young, explosive volcanic activity in the area. Although the valley is similar to the [[Hadley\u2013Apennine (Moon)|landing site of Apollo 15]] in that it is on the border of a [[lunar mare]], the advantages of Taurus-Littrow were believed to outweigh the drawbacks, thus leading to its selection as the Apollo 17 landing site.<ref name=lpi/>\n\nApollo 17 was the only lunar landing mission to carry the Traverse [[Gravimeter]] Experiment (TGE), an experiment built by [[Charles Stark Draper Laboratory|Draper Laboratory]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] designed to provide relative gravity measurements throughout the landing site at various locations during the mission's moonwalks.

The gravimeter was used to obtain readings at the landing site in the immediate vicinity of the Lunar Module (LM), as well as various locations on the mission's traverse routes.

A mapping camera, panoramic camera, and a [[Lidar|laser altimeter]] were also included in the SIM bay.<ref name=presskit/>\n\nThe lunar sounder beamed [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] impulses toward the lunar surface, which were designed with the objective of obtaining data to assist in developing a geological model of the interior of the Moon to an approximate depth of {{convert|1.3|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=presskit/>\n\nThe Infrared Scanning Radiometer was designed with the objective of generating a temperature map of the lunar surface to aid in locating surface features such as rock fields, structural differences in the [[Internal structure of the Moon|lunar crust]], and volcanic activity.<ref name=presskit/>\n\nThe Far-Ultraviolet Spectrometer was to be used to obtain data pertaining to the composition, density, and constituency of the [[Atmosphere of the Moon|lunar atmosphere]].

These flashes, described as \"streaks\" or \"specks\" of light, were usually observed by astronauts while the spacecraft was darkened during a sleep period. These flashes, while not observed on the lunar surface, would average about two per minute and were observed by the crew members during the trip out to the Moon, back to Earth, and in lunar orbit.<ref name=presskit/>\n\nThe Apollo 17 crew conducted an experiment, also conducted on Apollo 16, with the objective of linking these light flashes with [[cosmic ray]]s. As part of an experiment conducted by NASA and the [[University of Houston]], one astronaut wore a device that recorded the time, strength, and path of high-energy atomic particles that penetrated the device. Analysis of the results concluded that the evidence supported the hypothesis that the flashes occurred when charged particles travelled through the [[retina]] in the eye.<ref name=presskit/><ref name=lightflash>{{cite book |last1=Osborne |first1=W.

The experiment included two major components: a transmitting antenna deployed near the Lunar Module and a receiving antenna located on the Lunar Roving Vehicle. At different stops during the mission's traverses, electrical signals traveled from the transmitting device, through the ground, and received at the LRV. The electrical properties of the [[lunar soil]] could be determined by comparison of the transmitted and received electrical signals.

The issue was quickly determined to be a minor technical error. The clock was reset and held at the T-22 minute mark while technicians worked around the malfunction in order to continue with the launch.

Several minutes after the descent phase was initiated, the Lunar Module pitched over, giving the crew their first look at the landing site during the descent phase and allowing Cernan to guide the spacecraft to a desirable landing target while Schmitt provided data from the flight computer essential for landing. The LM touched down on the lunar surface at 2:55&nbsp;pm EST on December 11.

The first task of the first lunar excursion was to offload the Lunar Roving Vehicle and other equipment from the Lunar Module. While working near the rover, a fender was accidentally broken off when Gene Cernan brushed up against it, his hammer getting caught under the right-rear fender, breaking off the rear extension. The same incident had also occurred on Apollo 16 as Commander [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] maneuvered around the rover. Although this was not a mission-critical issue, the loss of the fender caused Cernan and Schmitt to be covered with dust thrown up when the rover was in motion.<ref name=\"brokenfender\">{{cite web|title=ALSEP Off-load|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.alsepoff.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=24 August 2011}}</ref> The crew used [[duct tape]] to fix the problem by attaching a map to the damaged fender, but the dust picked up on the tape surface prevented it from sticking properly and the first fix was short lived.

The American Patriots in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] won independence from Great Britain, becoming the [[United States|United States of America]]. They defeated the British in the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783) in alliance with France and others.\n\nMembers of [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonial society]] argued the position of \"[[no taxation without representation]]\", starting with the [[Stamp Act Congress]] in 1765. They rejected the authority of [[Parliament of Great Britain|the British Parliament]] to tax them because they lacked members in that governing body. Protests steadily escalated to the [[Boston Massacre]] in 1770 and the [[Gaspee Affair|burning of the ''Gaspee'']] in [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] in 1772, followed by the [[Boston Tea Party]] in December 1773, during which Patriots destroyed a consignment of taxed tea. The British responded by closing Boston Harbor, then followed with a [[Intolerable Acts|series of legislative acts]] which effectively rescinded [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]'s rights of self-government and caused the other colonies to rally behind Massachusetts. In late 1774, the Patriots set up [[First Continental Congress|their own alternative government]] to better coordinate their resistance efforts against Great Britain; other colonists preferred to remain aligned to the Crown and were known as [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|''Loyalists'']] or ''Tories''.\n\nTensions erupted into battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when the king's army attempted to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] on April 19, 1775. The conflict then developed into a global war, during which the Patriots (and later their French, Spanish, and Dutch allies) fought the British and Loyalists in what became known as the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u201383). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a [[Provincial Congress]] that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and from there they built a [[Continental Army]] under the leadership of General [[George Washington]]. The Continental Congress determined [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]]'s rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists' [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]], and they declared the colonies [[Lee Resolution|free and independent states]] on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] and [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed that all men are created equal.\n\nThe Continental Army [[Siege of Boston|forced the redcoats out of Boston]] in March 1776, but that summer [[New York and New Jersey campaign|the British captured and held New York City]] and its strategic harbor for the duration of the war. The Royal Navy blockaded ports and captured other cities for brief periods, but they failed to defeat Washington's forces. The Patriots unsuccessfully [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|attempted to invade Canada during the winter of 1775\u201376]], but successfully captured a British army at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in October 1777. France now entered the war as an ally of the United States with a large army and navy that threatened Britain itself. The war turned to the American South where the British under the leadership of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] captured an army at [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in early 1780 but failed to enlist enough volunteers from Loyalist civilians to take effective control of the territory. A combined American\u2013French force captured a second British army [[Siege of Yorktown|at Yorktown]] in the fall of 1781, effectively ending the war. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed September 3, 1783, formally ending the conflict and confirming the new nation's complete separation from the British Empire. The United States took possession of nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, with the British retaining control of Canada and Spain taking Florida.\n\nAmong the significant results of the revolution was the creation of the [[United States Constitution]], establishing a relatively strong federal national government that included an [[President of the United States|executive]], a [[United States Supreme Court|national judiciary]], and a bicameral [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] that represented states in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the population in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].<ref name=\"Wood, 1992\">Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992)</ref><ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 70</ref> The Revolution also resulted in the migration of around 60,000 Loyalists to other British territories, especially British North America (Canada).\n\n==Origin==\n{{see also|Thirteen Colonies}}\n[[File:Map of territorial growth 1775.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|alt=Eastern North America in 1775.

The North American theater of the Seven Years' War is commonly known as the [[French and Indian War]] in the United States; it removed France as a major player in North American affairs and led to the territory of [[New France]] being ceded to Great Britain. [[Lawrence Henry Gipson]] writes: <blockquote>It may be said as truly that the American Revolution was an aftermath of the Anglo-French conflict in the New World carried on between 1754 and 1763.</blockquote><ref>Lawrence Henry Gipson, \"The American revolution as an aftermath of the Great War for the Empire, 1754\u20131763.\" ''Political Science Quarterly'' (1950): 86\u2013104.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2144276 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] may also have{{ww|date=September 2018}} played a role in the separation of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] from England, as colonists wanted to continue migrating west to lands awarded by the Crown for their wartime service.{{cn|date=September 2018}} The Proclamation, however, cut them off. The lands west of Quebec and west of a line running along the crest of the [[Allegheny Mountains]] became Indian territory, barred to settlement for two years.\n\nThe colonists protested, and the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with the Indians. In 1768, Indians agreed to the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] and the [[Treaty of Hard Labour]], followed in 1770 by the [[Treaty of Lochaber]]. The treaties opened most of Kentucky and West Virginia to colonial settlement. The new map was drawn up at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768 which moved the line much farther to the west, from the green line to the red line on the map at right.<ref>{{cite book|author=William J Campbell|title=Speculators in Empire: Iroquoia and the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_ACAAAQBAJ&pg=PT118|date=29 April 2015|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|pages=118\u201320|isbn=978-0806147109}}</ref>\n\n===1764\u20131766: Taxes imposed and withdrawn===\n{{Main|Sugar Act|Currency Act|Quartering Acts|Stamp Act 1765|Declaratory Act}}\n{{Further|No taxation without representation|Virtual representation}}\n[[File:Parliament Stamp Act1765.jpg|thumb|Notice of Stamp Act of 1765 in newspaper]]\n\nIn 1764, Parliament passed the [[Currency Act]] to restrain the use of paper money, fearing that otherwise the colonists might evade debt payments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Larry|title=The Encyclopedia of Money|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date=2009|isbn=978-1598842517|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X4kgDkYxGrcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|pages=96\u201397}}</ref> Parliament also passed the [[Sugar Act]], imposing customs [[Duty (economics)|duties]] on a number of articles.

They used public demonstrations, [[boycott]], violence, and threats of violence to ensure that the British tax laws were unenforceable. In Boston, the Sons of Liberty burned the records of the [[vice admiralty court]] and looted the home of chief justice [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. Several legislatures called for united action, and nine colonies sent delegates to the [[Stamp Act Congress]] in [[New York City]] in October 1765. Moderates led by [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] drew up a \"[[Declaration of Rights and Grievances]]\" stating that taxes passed without representation violated their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]].

Benjamin Franklin made the case for repeal, explaining that the colonies had spent heavily in manpower, money, and blood in defense of the empire in a series of wars against the French and Indians, and that further taxes to pay for those wars were unjust and might bring about a rebellion. Parliament agreed and repealed the tax (February 21, 1766), but insisted in the [[Declaratory Act]] of March 1766 that they retained full power to make laws for the colonies \"in all cases whatsoever\".<ref>\n{{cite book|author=Miller|title=Origins of the American Revolution\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlmrAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA181|year=1943|pages=181\u2013|isbn=978-0804705936\n}}</ref> The repeal nonetheless caused widespread celebrations in the colonies.\n\n===1767\u20131773: Townshend Acts and the Tea Act===\n{{Main|Townshend Acts|Tea Act}}\n{{Further|Massachusetts Circular Letter|Boston Massacre|Boston Tea Party}}\n[[File:Gaspee Affair.jpg|thumb|alt=Burning of the Gaspee|<center>Burning of the ''[[Gaspee Affair|Gaspee]]''</center>]]\n\nIn 1767, the Parliament passed the [[Townshend Acts]] which placed duties on a number of essential goods, including paper, glass, and tea, and established a Board of Customs in Boston to more rigorously execute trade regulations. The new taxes were enacted on the belief that Americans only objected to internal taxes and not to external taxes such as custom duties. The Americans, however, argued against the constitutionality of the act because its purpose was to raise revenue and not regulate trade.<ref>Melvin I. Urofsky and Paul Finkelman, ''A March of Liberty: A Constitutional History of the United States'' (Oxford UP, 2002) v. 1 p. 52.</ref> Colonists responded by organizing new boycotts of British goods. These boycotts were less effective, however, as the Townshend goods were widely used.\n\nIn February 1768, the Assembly of Massachusetts Bay [[Massachusetts Circular Letter|issued a circular letter]] to the other colonies urging them to coordinate resistance. The governor dissolved the assembly when it refused to rescind the letter. Meanwhile, a riot broke out in Boston in June 1768 over the seizure of the sloop ''Liberty'', owned by [[John Hancock]], for alleged smuggling. Customs officials were forced to flee, prompting the British to deploy troops to Boston. A Boston town meeting declared that no obedience was due to parliamentary laws and called for the convening of a convention. A convention assembled but only issued a mild protest before dissolving itself. In January 1769, Parliament responded to the unrest by reactivating the [[Treason Act 1543]] which called for subjects outside the realm to face trials for treason in England. The governor of Massachusetts was instructed to collect evidence of said treason, and the threat caused widespread outrage, though it was not carried out.\n\nOn March 5, 1770, a large crowd gathered around a group of British soldiers. The crowd grew threatening, throwing snowballs, rocks, and debris at them. One soldier was clubbed and fell.<ref name=\"Hiller B. Zobel 1996\">Hiller B. Zobel, ''The Boston Massacre'' (1996)</ref> There was no order to fire, but the soldiers fired into the crowd anyway. They hit 11 people; three civilians died at the scene of the shooting, and two died after the incident. The event quickly came to be called the [[Boston Massacre]]. The soldiers were tried and acquitted (defended by [[John Adams]]), but the widespread descriptions soon began to turn colonial sentiment against the British. This, in turn, began a downward spiral in the relationship between Britain and the Province of Massachusetts.<ref name=\"Hiller B. Zobel 1996\"/>\n\nA new ministry under [[Lord North]] came to power in 1770, and Parliament withdrew all taxes except the tax on tea, giving up its efforts to raise revenue while maintaining the right to tax. This temporarily resolved the crisis, and the boycott of British goods largely ceased, with only the more radical patriots such as [[Samuel Adams]] continuing to agitate.\n\n[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=Two ships in a harbor, one in the distance.

The affair was investigated for possible treason, but no action was taken.\n\nIn 1772, it became known that the Crown intended to pay fixed salaries to the governors and judges in Massachusetts. Samuel Adams in Boston set about creating new Committees of Correspondence, which linked Patriots in all 13 colonies and eventually provided the framework for a rebel government. Virginia, the largest colony, set up its Committee of Correspondence in early 1773, on which Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson served.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 22\u201324</ref>\n\nA total of about 7000 to 8000 Patriots served on \"Committees of Correspondence\" at the colonial and local levels, comprising most of the leadership in their communities. Loyalists were excluded. The committees became the [[leadership|leaders]] of the American resistance to British actions, and largely determined the war effort at the state and local level. When the First Continental Congress decided to boycott British products, the colonial and local Committees took charge, examining merchant records and publishing the names of merchants who attempted to defy the boycott by importing British goods.<ref name=\"Mary Beth Norton 2001 pp 144\">Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation'' (6th ed. 2001) vol 1 pp. 144\u201345\n</ref>\n\nIn 1773, [[Hutchinson Letters Affair|private letters were published]] in which Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson claimed that the colonists could not enjoy all English liberties, and Lieutenant Governor [[Andrew Oliver]] called for the direct payment of colonial officials. The letters' contents were used as evidence of a systematic plot against American rights, and discredited Hutchinson in the eyes of the people; the Assembly petitioned for his recall. [[Benjamin Franklin]], postmaster general for the colonies, acknowledged that he leaked the letters, which led to him being berated by British officials and fired from his job.\n\nMeanwhile, Parliament passed the [[Tea Act]] to lower the price of taxed tea exported to the colonies in order to help the [[East India Company]] undersell smuggled Dutch tea. Special consignees were appointed to sell the tea in order to bypass colonial merchants. The act was opposed by those who resisted the taxes and also by smugglers who stood to lose business.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In most instances, the consignees were forced to resign and the tea was turned back, but Massachusetts governor Hutchinson refused to allow Boston merchants to give in to pressure. A town meeting in Boston determined that the tea would not be landed, and ignored a demand from the governor to disperse. On December 16, 1773, a group of men, led by Samuel Adams and dressed to evoke the appearance of American Indians, boarded the ships of the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] and dumped \u00a310,000 worth of tea from their holds (approximately \u00a3636,000 in 2008) into Boston Harbor.

They consisted of four laws enacted by the British parliament.<ref>Miller (1943) pp. 353\u201376\n</ref> The first was the [[Massachusetts Government Act]] which altered the Massachusetts charter and restricted town meetings. The second act was the [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Administration of Justice Act]] which ordered that all British soldiers to be tried were to be arraigned in Britain, not in the colonies. The third Act was the [[Boston Port Act]], which closed the port of Boston until the British had been compensated for the tea lost in the Boston Tea Party. The fourth Act was the [[Quartering Acts|Quartering Act of 1774]], which allowed royal governors to house British troops in the homes of citizens without requiring permission of the owner.<ref>Carp, ''Defiance of the Patriots: The Boston Tea Party and the Making of America'' (2010) ch 9</ref>\n\nIn response, Massachusetts patriots issued the [[Suffolk Resolves]] and formed an alternative shadow government known as the \"Provincial Congress\" which began training militia outside British-occupied Boston.<ref>{{cite book|author=John K.

The Patriots laid siege to Boston, expelled royal officials from all the colonies, and took control through the establishment of [[Provincial Congress]]es. The [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] followed on June 17, 1775.

The attack was a complete failure; many Americans who weren't killed were either captured or died of smallpox.\n\nIn March 1776, the Continental Army forced the British to [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|evacuate Boston]], with George Washington as the commander of the new army. The revolutionaries were now in full control of all 13 colonies and were ready to declare independence.

In all 13 colonies, Patriots had overthrown their existing governments, closing courts and driving away British officials. They had elected conventions and \"legislatures\" that existed outside any legal framework; new constitutions were drawn up in each state to supersede royal charters. They declared that they were states now, not colonies.<ref name = \"Pole-ch29\">Nevins (1927); Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 29</ref>\n\nOn January 5, 1776, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] ratified the first state constitution.

They decided what form of government to create, and also how to select those who would craft the constitutions and how the resulting document would be ratified. On 26 May 1776, [[John Adams]] wrote James Sullivan from Philadelphia:\n\n\"Depend upon it, sir, it is dangerous to open so fruitful a source of controversy and altercation, as would be opened by attempting to alter the qualifications of voters.

In 1790, conservatives gained power in the state legislature, called a new constitutional convention, and rewrote the constitution. The new constitution substantially reduced universal male suffrage, gave the governor veto power and patronage appointment authority, and added an upper house with substantial wealth qualifications to the unicameral legislature.

However, the British were seriously handicapped by their misunderstanding of the depth of support for the Patriot position. Ignoring the advice of General Gage, they misinterpreted the situation as merely a large-scale riot. London decided that they could overawe the Americans by sending a large military and naval force, forcing them to be loyal again:\n\n{{quote|Convinced that the Revolution was the work of a full few miscreants who had rallied an armed rabble to their cause, they expected that the revolutionaries would be intimidated\u2026.

Howe demanded a retraction of the Declaration of Independence, which was refused, and negotiations ended. The British then [[Battle of Kip's Bay|quickly seized New York City]] and nearly captured Washington's army. They made New York their main political and military base of operations in North America, [[Evacuation Day (New York)|holding it until November 1783]].

Their aim was to neutralize the [[Yankee#Early_usage|Yankees]], whom the British perceived as the primary source of agitators. The British army in New York City went to Philadelphia in a major case of mis-coordination, capturing it from Washington. The invasion army under [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]] was much too slow and became trapped in northern New York state. It surrendered after the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October 1777. From early October 1777 until November 15, a siege distracted British troops at [[Fort Mifflin]], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and allowed Washington time to preserve the Continental Army by safely leading his troops to harsh winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]].\n\n===Prisoners===\n{{Main|Prisoners of war in the American Revolutionary War}}\nIn August 1775, George III declared Americans in arms against royal authority to be traitors to the Crown. Following their surrender at the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October 1777, there were thousands of British and Hessian soldiers in American hands. Although Lord Germain took a hard line, the British generals on the scene never held treason trials; they treated captured enemy soldiers as [[prisoners of war]].<ref>Alan Valentine, ''Lord George Germain'' (1962) pp.&nbsp;309\u201310</ref> The dilemma was that tens of thousands of Loyalists were under American control and American retaliation would have been easy.

Chance, luck, and even the vagaries of the weather played crucial roles.\" Ellis's point is that the strategic and tactical decisions of the Howes were fatally flawed because they underestimated the challenges posed by the Patriots.

British Prime Minister [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] was in full charge of the British negotiations.

It gained fishing rights off Canadian coasts, and agreed to allow British merchants and Loyalists to try to recover their property. It was a highly favorable treaty for the United States, and deliberately so from the British point of view. Prime Minister Shelburne foresaw highly profitable two-way trade between Britain and the rapidly growing United States, as indeed came to pass. Since the blockade was lifted and the old imperial restrictions were gone, American merchants were free to trade with any nation anywhere in the world, and their businesses flourished.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan R.

The war revealed the limitations of Britain's [[fiscal-military state]] when they discovered that they suddenly faced powerful enemies with no allies, and they were dependent on extended and vulnerable transatlantic lines of communication. The defeat heightened dissension and escalated political antagonism to the King's ministers. Inside Parliament, the primary concern changed from fears of an over-mighty monarch to the issues of representation, parliamentary reform, and government retrenchment. Reformers sought to destroy what they saw as widespread institutional corruption.<ref name=\"William Hague 2004\">William Hague, ''William Pitt the Younger'' (2004)</ref><ref name=\"Jeremy Black 2006\">Jeremy Black, ''George III: America's Last King''(2006)</ref>\n\nThe result was a powerful crisis from 1776 to 1783. The peace in 1783 left France financially prostrate, while the British economy boomed thanks to the return of American business. The crisis ended after 1784 thanks to the King's shrewdness in outwitting [[Charles James Fox]] (the leader of the [[Fox-North Coalition]]), and renewed confidence in the system engendered by the leadership of the new Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]].

The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and exports.

Indeed, the soldiers and officers were given land grants in 1783 to cover the wages that they had earned but had not been paid during the war. Not until 1781 did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters, when [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] was named [[Superintendent of Finance of the United States]].<ref name=\"Charles Rappleye 2010 pp 225\"/>\n\nMorris used a French loan in 1782 to set up the private [[Bank of North America]] to finance the war. Seeking greater efficiency, Morris reduced the civil list, saved money by using competitive bidding for contracts, tightened accounting procedures, and demanded the national government's full share of money and supplies from the confederated states.<ref name=\"Charles Rappleye 2010 pp 225\"/>\n\nCongress used four main methods to cover the cost of the war, which cost about 66 million dollars in specie (gold and silver).<ref>Oliver Harry Chitwood, ''A History of Colonial America'' (1961) pp. 586\u201389</ref> Congress made two issues of paper money\u2014in 1775\u20131780 and in 1780\u201381. The first issue amounted to 242 million dollars. This paper money would supposedly be redeemed for state taxes, but the holders were eventually paid off in 1791 at the rate of one cent on the dollar. By 1780, the paper money was \"not worth a Continental\", as people said.<ref>{{cite book|author=Terry M.

Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper. The greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the Continental Army, whose wages were usually in arrears and declined in value every month, weakening their morale and adding to the hardships of their families.<ref>Ralph Volney Harlow, \"Aspects of Revolutionary Finance, 1775\u20131783,\" ''American Historical Review'' (1929) 35#1 pp. 46\u201368 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1838471 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1777, Congress repeatedly asked the states to provide money. But the states had no system of taxation either, and were little help. By 1780, Congress was making requisitions for specific supplies of corn, beef, pork, and other necessities\u2014an inefficient system that kept the army barely alive.<ref>Erna Risch, ''Supplying Washington's Army'' (1982)</ref><ref>E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775\u20131783'' (1990)</ref>\n\nStarting in 1776, the Congress sought to raise money by loans from wealthy individuals, promising to redeem the bonds after the war. The bonds were in fact redeemed in 1791 at face value, but the scheme raised little money because Americans had little specie, and many of the rich merchants were supporters of the Crown. Starting in 1776, the French secretly supplied the Americans with money, gunpowder, and munitions in order to weaken its arch enemy Great Britain. When France officially entered the war in 1778, the subsidies continued, and the French government, as well as bankers in Paris and Amsterdam, lent large sums to the American war effort. These loans were repaid in full in the 1790s.<ref>E.

The national government was still operating under the Articles of Confederation and was able to settle the issue of the western territories, which were ceded by the states to Congress. American settlers moved rapidly into those areas, with Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee becoming states in the 1790s.<ref>Greene and Pole, eds. ''Companion to the American Revolution,'' pp. 557\u2013624</ref>\n\nHowever, the national government had no money to pay either the war debts owed to European nations and the private banks, or to pay Americans who had been given millions of dollars of promissory notes for supplies during the war. Nationalists led by Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and other veterans feared that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war, or even internal revolts such as the [[Shays' Rebellion]] of 1786 in Massachusetts.\n\nCalling themselves \"Federalists,\" the nationalists convinced Congress to call the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787.<ref>Richard B. Morris, ''The Forging of the Union: 1781\u20131789'' (1987) pp. 245\u201366</ref> It adopted a new [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] that provided for a much stronger federal government, including an effective executive in a [[Separation of powers|check-and-balance]] system with the judiciary and legislature.<ref>Morris, ''The Forging of the Union: 1781\u20131789'' pp. 300\u201313</ref> The Constitution was ratified in 1788, after a fierce debate in the states over the nature of the proposed new government.

The amendments were ratified by the states in 1791.\n\n===National debt===\n{{Further|United States public debt|Alexander Hamilton}}\n\nThe national debt fell into three categories after the American Revolution. The first was the $12 million owed to foreigners, mostly money borrowed from France. There was general agreement to pay the foreign debts at full value. The national government owed $40 million and state governments owed $25 million to Americans who had sold food, horses, and supplies to the revolutionary forces. There were also other debts that consisted of [[promissory note]]s issued during the Revolutionary War to soldiers, merchants, and farmers who accepted these payments on the premise that the new Constitution would create a government that would pay these debts eventually.\n\nThe war expenses of the individual states added up to $114 million compared to $37 million by the central government.<ref>Jensen, ''The New Nation'' (1950) p. 379</ref> In 1790, Congress combined the remaining state debts with the foreign and domestic debts into one national debt totaling $80 million at the recommendation of first Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. Everyone received face value for wartime certificates, so that the national honor would be sustained and the national credit established.<ref>Joseph J. Ellis, ''His Excellency: George Washington'' (2004) p. 204</ref>\n\n==Ideology and factions==\nThe population of the 13 Colonies was not homogeneous in their political views and attitudes.

Chief among the ideas of the American Enlightenment were the concepts of Natural Law, Natural Rights, Consent of the Governed, Individualism, Property Rights, Self-Ownership, Self-Determination, liberalism, republicanism and fear of corruption.

Leaders of both the Patriots and the Loyalists were men of educated, propertied classes.

In the mid-20th century, historian [[Leonard Woods Labaree]] identified eight characteristics of the Loyalists that made them essentially conservative; opposite traits to those characteristic of the Patriots.<ref name=\"Labaree, 1948 pp. 164\u201365\">Labaree, ''Conservatism in Early American History'' (1948) pp. 164\u201365</ref> Older and better established men, Loyalists tended to resist innovation. They thought resistance to the Crown\u2014which they insisted was the only legitimate government\u2014was morally wrong, while the Patriots thought morality was on their side.<ref name=\"Hull 1978 pp. 344\">Hull et al., ''Choosing Sides'' (1978) pp. 344\u201366</ref><ref name=\"Wallace, 1972 pp. 167\">Burrows and Wallace, ''The American Revolution'' (1972) pp. 167\u2013305</ref>\n\nLoyalists were alienated when the Patriots resorted to violence, such as burning houses and [[tarring and feathering]]. Loyalists wanted to take a centrist position and resisted the Patriots' demand to declare their opposition to the Crown. Many Loyalists, especially merchants in the port cities, had maintained strong and long-standing relations with Britain (often with business and family links to other parts of the British Empire).<ref name=\"Hull 1978 pp. 344\"/><ref name=\"Wallace, 1972 pp. 167\"/>\n\nMany Loyalists realized that independence was bound to come eventually, but they were fearful that revolution might lead to anarchy, tyranny or mob rule. In contrast, the prevailing attitude among Patriots, who made systematic efforts to use mob violence in a controlled manner, was a desire to seize the initiative.<ref name=\"Hull 1978 pp. 344\"/><ref name=\"Wallace, 1972 pp. 167\"/> Labaree also wrote that Loyalists were pessimists who lacked the confidence in the future displayed by the Patriots.<ref name=\"Labaree, 1948 pp. 164\u201365\"/>\n\nHistorians in the early 20th century, such as [[J. Franklin Jameson]], examined the class composition of the Patriot cause, looking for evidence of a class war inside the revolution.<ref>J.

Most yeomen farmers, craftsmen, and small merchants joined the Patriot cause to demand more political equality. They were especially successful in Pennsylvania but less so in New England, where John Adams attacked Thomas Paine's ''Common Sense'' for the \"absurd democratical notions\" it proposed.<ref name=\"Nash 2005\"/><ref name=\"Resch 2006\"/>\n\n===King George III===\n{{main|George III of Great Britain}}\nThe war became a personal issue for [[George III of the United Kingdom|the king]], fueled by his growing belief that British leniency would be taken as weakness by the Americans.

While formal Revolutionary politics did not include women, ordinary domestic behaviors became charged with political significance as Patriot women confronted a war that permeated all aspects of political, civil, and domestic life. They participated by boycotting British goods, spying on the British, following armies as they marched, washing, cooking, and tending for soldiers, delivering secret messages, and in a few cases like [[Deborah Samson]], fighting disguised as men. Also, [[Mercy Otis Warren]] held meetings in her house and cleverly attacked Loyalists with her creative plays and histories.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eileen K.

A woman's loyalty to her husband, once a private commitment, could become a political act, especially for women in America committed to men who remained loyal to the King. Legal divorce, usually rare, was granted to Patriot women whose husbands supported the King.<ref>Kerber, ''Women of the Republic'' (1997) chapters 4 and 6</ref><ref>Mary Beth Norton, ''Liberty's Daughters: The Revolutionary Experience of American Women'' (1980)</ref>\n\n==Other participants==\n{{further|Diplomacy in the American Revolutionary War}}\n\n===France===\n{{main|France in the American Revolutionary War}}\nIn early 1776, France set up a major program of aid to the Americans, and the Spanish secretly added funds.

The great majority of the 200,000 Indians east of the Mississippi distrusted the Colonists and supported the British cause, hoping to forestall continued colonial encroachment on their territories.<ref>Greene and Pole (2004) chapters 19, 46 and 51; Colin G. Calloway, ''The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities'' (1995)</ref> Those tribes that were more closely involved in trade tended to side with the Patriots, although political factors were important, as well.\n\nMost Indians did not participate directly in the war, except for warriors and bands associated with four of the [[Iroquois]] nations in New York and Pennsylvania which allied with the British. The British did have other allies, especially in the upper Midwest. They provided Indians with funding and weapons to attack American outposts. Some Indians tried to remain neutral, seeing little value in joining what they perceived to be a European conflict, and fearing reprisals from whichever side they opposed. The [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] and [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] among the Iroquois of central and western New York supported the American cause.<ref>Joseph T. Glatthaar and James Kirby Martin, ''Forgotten Allies: The Oneida Indians and the American Revolution'' (2007)</ref>\n\nThe British provided arms to Indians who were led by [[Loyalists]] in war parties to raid frontier settlements from the [[Province of Carolina|Carolinas]] to New York.

The [[Chickamauga Cherokee]] under [[Dragging Canoe]] allied themselves closely with the British, and fought on for an additional decade after the signing of the Treaty of Paris.\n\n[[Joseph Brant]] of the powerful [[Mohawk nation]], part of the Iroquois Confederacy based in New York, was the most prominent Indian leader against the Colonial forces. In 1778 and 1780, he led 300 Iroquois warriors and 100 white Loyalists in multiple attacks on small frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania, killing many settlers and destroying villages, crops, and stores.<ref>{{cite DCB |last=Graymont |first=Barbara |title=Thayendanegea (Joseph Brant) |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/thayendanegea_5E.html  |volume=5}}</ref> The Seneca, Onondaga, and Cayuga of the Iroquois Confederacy also allied with the British against the Americans.<ref name=\"Colin G.

The [[Battle of Newtown]] proved decisive as the Patriots had a 3-1 advantage and ended significant resistance. Otherwise there was little combat. Sullivan systematically burned the villages and destroyed about 160,000 bushels of corn that composed the winter food supply. Facing starvation and homeless for the winter, the Iroquois fled to Canada. The British resettled them in Ontario, providing land grants as compensation for some of their losses.<ref>Joseph R. Fischer, ''A Well-Executed Failure: The Sullivan Campaign against the Iroquois, July\u2013September 1779'' (1997).</ref>\n\nAt the peace conference following the war, the British ceded lands which they did not really control, and did not consult their Indian allies. They transferred control to the United States of all the land east of the Mississippi and north of Florida. Calloway concludes:\n\n{{quote|Burned villages and crops, murdered chiefs, divided councils and civil wars, migrations, towns and forts choked with refugees, economic disruption, breaking of ancient traditions, losses in battle and to disease and hunger, betrayal to their enemies, all made the American Revolution one of the darkest periods in American Indian history.<ref>Calloway (1995) p. 290</ref>}}\n\nThe British did not give up their forts in the West until 1796 in what is now the eastern Midwest, stretching from Ohio to Wisconsin; they kept alive the dream of forming a satellite Indian nation there, which they called a Neutral Indian Zone.

Tens of thousands of slaves escaped to British lines throughout the South, causing dramatic losses to slaveholders and disrupting cultivation and harvesting of crops. For instance, [[South Carolina]] was estimated to have lost about 25,000 slaves to flight, migration, or death\u2014amounting to one third of its slave population. From 1770 to 1790, the black proportion of the population (mostly slaves) in South Carolina dropped from 60.5 percent to 43.8 percent, and from 45.2 percent to 36.1 percent in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619\u20131877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, p. 73</ref>\n\nBritish forces gave transportation to 10,000 slaves when they evacuated [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], carrying through on their promise.<ref>Kolchin, ''American Slavery'', p. 73</ref> They evacuated and resettled more than 3,000 [[Black Loyalist]]s from New York to [[Nova Scotia]], [[Upper Canada]], and [[Lower Canada]].

These were demonstrated by a leadership and government that espoused protection of natural rights, and a system of laws chosen by the people.<ref>Wood, ''The American Revolution: A History'' (2003)</ref> John Murrin, by contrast, argues that the definition of \"the people\" at that time was mostly restricted to free men who were able to pass a property-qualification.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murrin|first1=John M.|last2=Johnson|first2=Paul E.|last3=McPherson|first3=James M.|last4=Fahs|first4=Alice|last5=Gerstle|first5=Gary|title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People|date=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495904991|page=296|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGSQOiy6uZUC&pg=PT337#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"U.S. Voting Rights\">{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/timelines/voting.html|title=U.S. Voting Rights|accessdate=2 July 2013}}</ref> This view argues that any significant gain of the revolution was irrelevant in the short term to women, black Americans and slaves, poor white men, youth, and American Indians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring07/elections.cfm|title=Voting in Early America|last=Crews|first=Ed|accessdate=2 July 2013}}</ref><ref>McCool, Daniel, Susan M.

It did displace the deference, the patronage, the social divisions that had determined the way people viewed one another for centuries and still view one another in much of the world. It did give to ordinary people a pride and power, not to say an arrogance, that have continued to shock visitors from less favored lands. It may have left standing a host of inequalities that have troubled us ever since. But it generated the egalitarian view of human society that makes them troubling and makes our world so different from the one in which the revolutionists had grown up.<ref>{{cite book|author=Edmund S.

Concepts of liberty, individual rights, equality among men and hostility toward corruption became incorporated as core values of liberal republicanism. The greatest challenge to the old order in Europe was the challenge to inherited political power and the democratic idea that government rests on the [[consent of the governed]]. The example of the first successful revolution against a European empire, and the first successful establishment of a republican form of democratically elected government, provided a model for many other colonial peoples who realized that they too could break away and become self-governing nations with directly elected representative government.<ref>Palmer, (1959)</ref>\n\nThe Dutch Republic, also at war with Britain, was the next country to sign a treaty with the United States, on October 8, 1782.<ref name=\"Hamilton, 1974 p. 28\"/> On April 3, 1783, Ambassador Extraordinary [[Gustaf Philip Creutz]], representing King [[Gustav III of Sweden]], and Benjamin Franklin, signed a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (USA\u2013Sweden)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] with the U.S.<ref name=\"Hamilton, 1974 p. 28\"/>\n\nThe American Revolution was the first wave of the [[Atlantic Revolutions]]: the [[French Revolution]], the [[Haitian Revolution]], and the [[Latin American wars of independence]]. Aftershocks reached Ireland in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and in the Netherlands.<ref>Greene and Pole (1994) ch. 53\u201355</ref><ref>Wim Klooster, ''Revolutions in the Atlantic World: A Comparative History'' (2009)</ref>\n\nThe Revolution had a strong, immediate influence in Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. Many British and Irish [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] spoke in favor of the American cause. In Ireland, there was a profound impact; the [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestants who controlled Ireland]] were demanding more and more self-rule. Under the leadership of [[Henry Grattan]], the so-called \"[[Irish Patriot Party#Grattan's Patriots|Patriots]]\" forced the reversal of mercantilist prohibitions against trade with other British colonies. The King and his cabinet in London could not risk another rebellion on the American model, and made a series of concessions to the Patriot faction in Dublin. Armed Protestant volunteer units were set up to protect against an invasion from France. As in America, so too in Ireland the King no longer had a monopoly of lethal force.<ref>R. B. McDowell, ''Ireland in the Age of Imperialism and Revolution, 1760\u20131801'' (1979)</ref>\n\nThe Revolution, along with the [[Dutch Revolt]] (end of the 16th century) and the 17th century [[English Civil War]], was among the examples of overthrowing an old regime for many Europeans who later were active during the era of the French Revolution, such as the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]]. The American Declaration of Independence influenced the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]] of 1789.<ref>Palmer, (1959); Greene and Pole (1994) chapters 49\u201352</ref><ref>Center for History and New Media, ''Liberty, equality, fraternity'' (2010)</ref> The spirit of the Declaration of Independence led to laws ending slavery in all the Northern states and the Northwest Territory, with New Jersey the last in 1804. States such as New Jersey and New York adopted gradual emancipation, which kept some people as slaves for more than two decades longer.<ref>Greene and Pole pp. 409, 453\u201354</ref>\n\n===Status of American women===\nThe democratic ideals of the Revolution inspired changes in the roles of women.<ref>Linda K. Kerber, et al. \"Beyond Roles, Beyond Spheres: Thinking about Gender in the Early Republic,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly,'' (1989), 46#3 565\u201385 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1922356 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe concept of [[republican motherhood]] was inspired by this period and reflects the importance of [[revolutionary republicanism|Republicanism as the dominant American ideology]]. It assumed that a successful republic rested upon the virtue of its citizens. Women were considered to have the essential role of instilling their children with values conducive to a healthy republic. During this period, the wife's relationship with her husband also became more liberal, as love and affection instead of obedience and subservience began to characterize the ideal marital relationship. In addition, many women contributed to the war effort through fundraising and running family businesses in the absence of husbands.\n\nThe traditional constraints gave way to more liberal conditions for women. Patriarchy faded as an ideal; young people had more freedom to choose their spouses and more often used birth control to regulate the size of their families. Society emphasized the role of mothers in child rearing, especially the patriotic goal of raising republican children rather than those locked into aristocratic value systems. There was more permissiveness in child-rearing. Patriot women married to Loyalists who left the state could get a divorce and obtain control of the ex-husband's property.<ref>Mary Beth Norton, ''Liberty's Daughters: The Revolutionary Experience of American Women, 1750\u20131800'' (3rd ed. 1996)</ref>\nWhatever gains they had made, however, women still found themselves subordinated, legally and socially, to their husbands, disfranchised and usually with only the role of mother open to them. But, some women earned livelihoods as midwives and in other roles in the community, which were not originally recognized as significant by men.\n\n[[Abigail Adams]] expressed to her husband, the president, the desire of women to have a place in the new republic:\n\n{{quote|I desire you would remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands.<ref>{{cite book|author=Woody Holton|title=Abigail Adams|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ltgyHkFGF3EC&pg=PA172|year=2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=172|isbn=978-1451607369}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Revolution sparked a discussion on the rights of woman and an environment favorable to women's participation in politics. Briefly the possibilities for women's rights were highly favorable, but a backlash led to a greater rigidity that excluded women from politics.<ref>[[Rosemarie Zagarri]], ''Revolutionary Backlash: Women and Politics in the Early American Republic'' (2007), p. 8</ref>\n\nFor more than thirty years, however, the 1776 [[New Jersey State Constitution]] gave the vote to \"all inhabitants\" who had a certain level of wealth, including unmarried women and blacks (not married women because they could not own property separately from their husbands), until in 1807, when that state legislature passed a bill interpreting the constitution to mean universal ''white male'' [[suffrage]], excluding paupers.<ref>Klinghoffer and Elkis (\"The Petticoat Electors: W omen's Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776\u20131807\", ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 12, no. 2 (1992): 159\u201393.)</ref>\n\n===Status of African Americans===\nIn the first two decades after the American Revolution, state legislatures and individuals took actions to free numerous slaves, in part based on revolutionary ideals. Northern states passed new constitutions that contained language about equal rights or specifically abolished slavery; some states, such as New York and New Jersey, where slavery was more widespread, passed laws by the end of the 18th century to abolish slavery by a gradual method; in New York, the last slaves were freed in 1827.\n\nWhile no southern state abolished slavery, for a period individual owners could free their slaves by personal decision, often providing for manumission in wills but sometimes filing deeds or court papers to free individuals. Numerous slaveholders who freed their slaves cited revolutionary ideals in their documents; others freed slaves as a reward for service. Records also suggest that some slaveholders were freeing their own [[mixed-race]] children, born into slavery to slave mothers.\n\n===Commemorations===\n{{Main|Commemoration of the American Revolution|United States Bicentennial}}\n[[File:American revolution bicentennial.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[United States Bicentennial]], 1976]]\n[[File:Colonial Williamsburg Governors Palace Front Dscn7232.jpg|thumb|Governor's Palace, [[Colonial Williamsburg]], a restored colonial city in Williamburg, Virginia]]\nThe American Revolution has a central place in the American memory<ref>Michael Kammen, ''A Season of Youth: The American Revolution and the Historical Imagination'' (1978); Kammen, ''Mystic Chords of Memory: The Transformation of Tradition in American Culture'' (1991)</ref> as the story of the nation's founding.

He has written and produced more than seventy full-length plays in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] and London and was, between 1972 and 2009, the artistic director of the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre]] in Scarborough, where all but four of his plays have received their first performance. More than 40 have subsequently been produced in the [[West End theatre|West End]], at the [[Royal National Theatre]] or by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] since his first hit ''[[Relatively Speaking (play)|Relatively Speaking]]'' opened at the Duke of York's Theatre in 1969.\n\nMajor successes include ''[[Absurd Person Singular]]'' (1975), ''[[The Norman Conquests]]'' trilogy (1973), ''[[Bedroom Farce (play)|Bedroom Farce]]'' (1975), ''Just Between Ourselves'' (1976), ''[[A Chorus of Disapproval (play)|A Chorus of Disapproval]]'' (1984), ''[[Woman in Mind]]'' (1985), ''[[A Small Family Business]]'' (1987), ''[[Man Of The Moment (play)|Man Of The Moment]]'' (1988), [[House & Garden (plays)|''House'' & ''Garden'']] (1999) and ''[[Private Fears in Public Places]]'' (2004). His plays have won numerous awards, including seven London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' Awards. They have been translated into over 35 languages and are performed on stage and television throughout the world. Ten of his plays have been staged on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], attracting two [[Tony Awards|Tony]] nominations, and one [[Tony Awards|Tony]] award.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Childhood===\n\nAyckbourn was born in [[Hampstead]], London.<ref name=p9>P.

Allen, 2001, p. 10</ref>  His father, Horace Ayckbourn (1904\u20131965), was an orchestral violinist, at one time deputy leader of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]].<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 6</ref> His parents, who separated shortly after [[World War II]], never married, and Ayckbourn's mother divorced her first husband to marry again in 1948.<ref name=p9/>\n\nAyckbourn wrote his first play at Wisborough Lodge (a preparatory school in the village of [[Wisborough Green]]) when he was about 10.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 20</ref> Whilst at prep school as a boarder, his mother wrote to tell him she was marrying Cecil Pye, a bank manager. When he went home for the holidays, his new family consisted of his mother, his stepfather and Christopher, his stepfather's son by an earlier marriage. This relationship too, reportedly ran into difficulties early on.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 17\u201319</ref>\n\nAyckbourn attended [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]], in the village of [[Hertford Heath]], and whilst there toured Europe and America with the school's Shakespeare company.<ref name=webbio/><ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 30\u201333</ref>\n\n===Adult life===\n\nAfter leaving school at 17, Ayckbourn's career took several temporary jobs in various places before starting a temporary job at the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre|Scarborough Library Theatre]], where he was introduced to the artistic director, [[Stephen Joseph]].<ref name=webbio/><ref name=p41>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 43\u201346</ref> It is said that Joseph became both a mentor and father figure for Ayckbourn until his untimely death in 1967,<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 118\u2013119</ref> and he has consistently spoken highly of him.<ref>Ayckbourn, Alan (2003). ''The Crafty Art of Playmaking'', Faber, {{ISBN|0-571-21509-2}}</ref>\n\nAyckbourn's career was briefly interrupted when he was called for [[National Service]]. He was swiftly discharged, officially on medical grounds, but it is suggested that a doctor who noticed his reluctance to join the Armed Forces deliberately failed the medical as a favour.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 72\u201375</ref> Although Ayckbourn continued to move where his career took him, he settled in Scarborough, eventually buying Longwestgate House, the house formerly owned by [[Stephen Joseph]].<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 145\u2013146</ref>\n\nIn 1957, Ayckbourn married Christine Roland, another member of the Library Theatre company,<ref name=20facts>[http://biography.alanayckbourn.net/BiographyFacts.htm 20 Facts about Alan Ayckbourn] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119100222/http://biography.alanayckbourn.net/BiographyFacts.htm |date=19 January 2009 }} accessed 5 January 2009</ref><ref>P.

Ayckbourn said that his relationship with Roland became easy once they agreed their marriage was over. Around this time, he started to share a home with Heather Stoney,<ref>P.

Allen, 2001, p. 123</ref> There is no clear answer to this question. There has only been one biography, written by Paul Allen, and this primarily covers his career in the theatre.<ref name=biography>P. Allen, 2001,</ref> Ayckbourn has frequently said he sees aspects of himself in all his characters. For example, in ''[[Bedroom Farce (play)|Bedroom Farce]]'' (1975), he admitted to being, in some respects, all four of the men in the play.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 155</ref> It has been suggested that, after Ayckbourn himself, the person who is used the most in his plays is his mother, particularly as Susan in ''[[Woman in Mind]]''<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 3</ref> (1985).\n\nWhat is less clear is how much influence events in Ayckbourn's life have had on his writing. It is true that the theme of marriages in various difficulties was heavily present throughout his plays in the early seventies, around the time his own marriage was coming to an end. However, by this time, he had also witnessed the failures of his parents' relationships as well as those of some of his friends.<ref name=auto/> Which relationships, if any, he drew on for his plays, is unclear. In Paul Allen\u2019s biography, Ayckbourn is briefly compared to Dafydd and Guy in ''[[A Chorus of Disapproval (play)|A Chorus of Disapproval]]'' (1984). Both characters feel themselves in trouble, and there was speculation that Ayckbourn himself may have felt himself to be in trouble. At the time, he had reportedly become seriously involved with another actress, which threatened his relationship with Stoney.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, pp. 209\u2013210</ref> But again, it is unclear whether this had any effect on the writing, and Paul Allen's view is that it is not current experience that Ayckbourn uses for his plays.\n\nIt could be that Ayckbourn had written plays with himself and his own issues in mind, but as Ayckbourn is portrayed as a guarded and private man,<ref name=biography/> it is hard to imagine him exposing his own life in his plays to any great degree. In the biography, Paul Allen wrote, regarding a suggestion in ''Cosmopolitan'' that his plays were becoming autobiographical: \"If we take that to mean that his plays tell his own life story, he still hasn't started.\"<ref name=auto/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career and acting===\n\nOn leaving school his theatrical career started immediately, with an introduction to Sir [[Donald Wolfit]] by his French master.<ref>P. Allen, 2001, p. 32</ref> Ayckbourn joined Wolfit on tour to the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] as an acting assistant stage manager (meaning a role that involved both acting and stage management) for three weeks,<ref name=webbio/><ref>P.

\n}}\n\nThe '''Amiga''' is a family of [[personal computer]]s introduced by [[Commodore International|Commodore]] in 1985. The original model was part of a wave of 16 and 32 bit computers that featured 256 KB or more of RAM, mouse-based GUIs, and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems. This wave included the [[Atari ST]]&mdash;released the same year&mdash;Apple's [[Macintosh]], and later the [[Apple IIGS]]. Based on the [[Motorola 68000 series|Motorola 68000]] [[microprocessor]], the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound, including [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and a [[blitter]], and a [[pre-emptive multitasking]] operating system called [[AmigaOS]].\n\nThe [[Amiga 1000]] was released in July 1985, but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986. The best selling model, the [[Amiga 500]], was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold.<ref name=\"reimer\" /> The [[Amiga 3000|A3000]], introduced in 1990, started the second generation of Amiga systems, followed by the [[Amiga 500 Plus|A500+]], and the [[Amiga 600|A600]] in March 1992. Finally, as the third generation, the [[Amiga 1200|A1200]] and the [[Amiga 4000|A4000]] were released in late 1992. The platform became particularly popular for gaming and [[demo (computer programming)|programming demo]]s. It also found a prominent role in the [[desktop video]], [[video production]], and [[show control]] business, leading to video editing systems such as the [[Video Toaster]]. The Amiga's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early [[Music tracker|tracker]] music software. The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory led to the development of several 3D rendering packages, including [[LightWave 3D]], [[Imagine (3D modeling software)|Imagine]], [[Aladdin4D]], and [[TurboSilver]].\n\nAlthough early Commodore advertisements attempt to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine, especially when outfitted with the [[Amiga Sidecar]] PC compatibility add-on, the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer, with a wide range of games and creative software.<ref name=\"ad1987a\" /><ref name=\"ad1987b\" /> Poor marketing and the failure of the later models to repeat the technological advances of the first systems meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms, such as the [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|fourth generation game consoles]], [[Macintosh]], and the rapidly dropping prices of [[IBM PC compatible]]s which gained 256 color VGA graphics in 1987.<ref name=\"reimer\" /> Commodore ultimately went bankrupt in April 1994 after the [[Amiga CD32]] model failed in the marketplace.\n\nSince the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line, including [[Genesi]], [[Eyetech]], [[ACube Systems Srl]] and A-EON Technology. Likewise, AmigaOS has influenced replacements, clones and compatible systems such as [[MorphOS]], [[AmigaOS 4]] and [[AROS Research Operating System|AROS]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Amiga}}\n\n{{quote\n| \"The Amiga was so far ahead of its time that almost nobody\u2014including Commodore's marketing department\u2014could fully articulate what it was all about. Today, it's obvious the Amiga was the first multimedia computer, but in those days it was derided as a game machine because few people grasped the importance of advanced graphics, sound, and video. Nine years later, vendors are still struggling to make systems that work like 1985 Amigas.\n| ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte Magazine]]'', August 1994\n}}\n\n===Concept and early development===\n[[Jay Miner]] joined [[Atari]] in the 1970s to develop custom [[integrated circuit]]s, and led development of the [[Atari 2600]]'s [[Television Interface Adaptor|TIA]].<ref name=p1p3>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/07/a-history-of-the-amiga-part-1/3/ |title=A history of the Amiga, part 1: Genesis |website=Ars Technica |first=Jeremy|last=Reimer |date=3 July 2007}}</ref> Almost as soon as its development was complete, the team began developing a much more sophisticated set of chips, [[CTIA and GTIA|CTIA]], [[ANTIC]] and [[POKEY]], that formed the basis of the [[Atari 8-bit family]].<ref name=p1p4>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/07/a-history-of-the-amiga-part-1/4/ |title=A history of the Amiga, part 1: Genesis |website=Ars Technica |first=Jeremy|last=Reimer |date=3 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nWith the 8-bit line's launch in 1979, the team once again started looking at a next generation chipset. [[Nolan Bushnell]] had sold the company to [[Warner Communications]] in 1978, and the new management was much more interested in the existing lines than development of new products that might cut into their sales. Miner wanted to start work with the new [[Motorola 68000]], but management was only interested in another [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] based system. Miner left the company, and the industry.<ref name=p1p4/>\n\nIn 1979, [[Larry Kaplan]] left Atari and founded [[Activision]]. In 1982, Kaplan was approached by a number of investors who wanted to develop a new game platform. Kaplan hired Miner to run the hardware side of the newly formed company, \"Hi-Toro\". The system was code-named \"Lorraine\" in keeping with Miner's policy of giving systems female names, in this case the company president's wife, Lorraine Morse.<ref name=\"AutoP5-1\" /> When Kaplan left the company late in 1982, Miner was promoted to head engineer<ref name=p1p4/> and the company relaunched as Amiga Corporation.<ref>''New York Times'', 29 August 1984, p. D1</ref>\n\nA breadboard prototype was largely completed by late 1983, and shown at the January 1984 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) with the [[Demo (computer programming)#The bouncing ball|Boing Ball demo]]. A further developed version was demonstrated at the June 1984 CES and shown to many companies in hopes of garnering further funding, but found little interest in a market that was in the final stages of the [[North American video game crash of 1983]].<ref name=\"AutoP5-1\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-2\" />\n\nIn March, Atari expressed a tepid interest in Lorraine for its potential use in a games console or home computer tentatively known as the 1850XLD. But the talks were progressing slowly,<ref>''New York Times'', 29 August 1984, p. D16</ref> and Amiga was running out of money. A temporary arrangement led to a $500,000 loan from Atari to Amiga to keep the company going. The terms required the loan to be repaid in one month, otherwise Amiga would forfeit the Lorraine design to Atari.\n\n===Commodore launch===\nDuring 1983, Atari lost over $1 million a week, due to the combined effects of the crash and the ongoing price war in the home computer market. Warner became desperate to sell the company. [[Jack Tramiel]] resigned from Commodore in January 1984 due to internal battles over the future direction of the company. In June, Tramiel arranged a no-cash deal to take over Atari and reformed it as Atari Corporation.\n\nTramiel's purchase of Atari resulted in a considerable number of Commodore employees following him, including a number of the senior technical staff. This left Commodore with no workable path to a next generation computer. The company approached Amiga offering to fund development as a home computer system. They quickly arranged to repay the Atari loan, ending that threat. The two companies were initially arranging a $4 million license agreement before Commodore offered $24 million to purchase Amiga outright.<ref name=p3p3>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/08/a-history-of-the-amiga-part-3/3/ |title=A history of the Amiga, part 3: The first prototype |website=Ars Technica |first=Jeremy|last=Reimer |date=21 August 2007}}</ref>\n\nBy late 1984 the prototype breadboard chipset had successfully been turned into integrated circuits, and the system hardware was being readied for production. At this time the [[operating system]] (OS) was not as ready, and led to a deal to port an OS known as [[TRIPOS]] to the platform. TRIPOS was a [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] system that had been written in [[BCPL]] during the 1970s for [[minicomputer]] systems like the [[PDP-11]], but later experimentally ported to the 68000. This early version was known as AmigaDOS and the GUI as Workbench. The BCPL parts were later rewritten in the [[C (programming language)|C]] language, and the entire system became AmigaOS.\n\nIn common with many contemporaneous [[Unix workstation]]s, the system was enclosed in a [[pizza box form factor]] case; a late change was the introduction of vertical supports on either side of the case to provide a \"garage\" under the main section of the system where the keyboard could be stored.<ref name=p5p1>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/10/amiga-history-4-commodore-years/2/ |title=A history of the Amiga, part 4: Enter Commodore |website=Ars Technica |first=Jeremy|last=Reimer |date=10 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe first model was announced in 1985 as simply \"The Amiga from Commodore\", later to be retroactively dubbed the [[Amiga 1000]].{{efn|The name \"Amiga\" was chosen because it is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for ''(female) friend'', and alphabetically it appears before Apple in lists of computer makers.

He immediately implemented an ambitious plan that covered almost all of the company's operations. Among these were the long overdue cancelation of the now outdated [[Commodore PET|PET]] and [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]] lines, as well as a variety of poorly selling [[Commodore 64]] offshoots and the [[Commodore 900]] [[workstation]] effort.<ref name=p6p2/>\n\nAnother of the changes was to split the Amiga into two products, a new high-end version of the Amiga aimed at the creative market, and a cost-reduced version that would take over for the Commodore 64 in the low-end market.<ref name=p6p2>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/02/amiga-history-part-6/2/ |title=A history of the Amiga, part 6: stopping the bleeding |website=Ars Technica |first=Jeremy|last=Reimer |date=11 February 2008}}</ref> These new designs were released in 1987 as the [[Amiga 2000]] and [[Amiga 500]], the latter of which went on to widespread success and became their best selling model.\n\nSimilar high-end/low-end models would make up the Amiga line for the rest of its history; follow-on designs included the [[Amiga 3000]]/[[Amiga 500 Plus]]/[[Amiga 600]], and the [[Amiga 4000]]/[[Amiga 1200]]. These models incorporated a series of technical upgrades known as the [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set|ECS]] and [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]], which added higher resolution displays among many other improvements and simplifications.\n\nUltimately the Amiga line would sell an estimated 4,850,000 machines over its lifetime. The machines were most popular in the UK and Germany, with about 1.5 million sold in each country, and sales in the high hundreds of thousands in other European nations. The machine was less popular in North America, where an estimated 700,000 were sold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amigahistory.plus.com/sales.html |title=Commodore-Amiga Sales Figures |first=Gareth |last=Knight |website=Amiga history guide}}</ref> In particular, in the U.S. the Amiga did not achieve any success outside of Commodore's traditional enthusiast market except in [[vertical market]]s for [[video processing]] and editing.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|pages=29\u201330}}</ref>\n\n===Bankruptcy ===\nIn spite of his successes in making the company profitable and bringing the Amiga line to market, Rattigan was soon forced out in a power struggle with majority shareholder, [[Irving Gould]]. This is widely regarded as the turning point, as further improvements to the Amiga were eroded by rapid improvements in other platforms.<ref name=p8p2>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/04/a-history-of-the-amiga-part-9-the-demo-scene/2/ |title=A history of the Amiga, part 8: The demo scene |website=Ars Technica |first=Jeremy|last=Reimer |date=28 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Commodore filed for bankruptcy and its assets were purchased by [[Escom (computer corp)|Escom]], a German PC manufacturer, who created the subsidiary company Amiga Technologies. They re-released the A1200 and A4000T, and introduced a new [[Motorola 68060|68060]] version of the A4000T. However, Escom in turn went bankrupt in 1997.\n\nThe Amiga brand was then sold to a US [[Wintel]] PC manufacturer, [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway 2000]], which had announced grand plans for it. However, in 2000, Gateway sold the Amiga brand without having released any products. The current owner of the trademark, [[Amiga, Inc.]], licensed the rights to sell hardware using either the Amiga or [[AmigaOne]] brand to [[Eyetech|Eyetech Group]], [[Hyperion Entertainment]] and [[Commodore USA]].\n\n== Hardware ==\n[[File:Amiga 1000 computer.jpg|thumb|[[Amiga 1000]]]]\n[[File:Amiga 600.jpg|thumb|[[Amiga 600]]]]\n[[File:Amiga 1200 with mouse, drives.jpg|thumb|[[Amiga 1200]]]]\n[[File:Amiga-CD32-wController-L.jpg|thumb|[[Amiga CD32]]]]\n[[File:Deluxe Paint for Amiga.jpg|thumb|Amiga diskette containing the [[Deluxe Paint]] bitmap graphics editing program]]\nAt its core, the Amiga has a custom chipset consisting of several [[coprocessor]]s, which handle audio, video and [[direct memory access]] independently of the [[Central processing unit|Central Processing Unit]] (CPU). This architecture freed up the Amiga's processor for other tasks and gave the Amiga a performance edge over its competitors, particularly in terms of video-intensive applications and games.<ref name=\"amiga_hardware_ref\" />\n\nThe general Amiga architecture uses two distinct [[bus (computing)|bus]] subsystems, namely, the chipset bus and the CPU bus. The chipset bus allows the custom coprocessors and CPU to address [[Amiga Chip RAM|\"Chip RAM\"]]. The CPU bus provides addressing to other subsystems, such as conventional RAM, ROM and the [[Amiga Zorro II|Zorro II]] or [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro III]] expansion subsystems. This architecture enables independent operation of the subsystems; the CPU \"Fast\" bus can be much faster than the chipset bus. CPU expansion boards may provide additional custom buses. Additionally, \"busboards\" or \"bridgeboards\" may provide [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] or [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] buses.<ref name=\"amiga_hardware_ref\" />\n\n=== Central processing unit ===\nThe [[Motorola]] [[Motorola 68000 family|68000]] series of microprocessors was used in all Amiga models from Commodore. While all CPU in the 68000 family have a [[32-bit]] [[Instruction Set Architecture|ISA]] design (programmer uses and sees a 32-bit model), the MC68000 used in the most popular models is a [[16-bit]] (or 16/32-bit) processor because its [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] operates in 16-bit (32-bit operations require additional clock cycles, consuming more time).<ref name=\"AutoP5-4\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-5\" /> The MC68000 has a 16-bit external [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] so 32-bits of data is transferred in two consecutive steps, a technique called [[multiplexing]]. This is transparent to the software, which was 32-bit from the beginning. The MC68000 can address 16&nbsp;MB of physical memory. Later Amiga models featured higher-speed, full 32-bit CPUs with a larger address space and [[Instruction pipelining|instruction pipeline]] facilities.\n\nCPU upgrades were offered by both Commodore and third-party manufacturers. Most Amiga models can be upgraded either by direct CPU replacement or through expansion boards. Such boards often featured faster and higher capacity memory interfaces and [[hard disk drive|hard disk]] controllers.\n\nTowards the end of Commodore's time in charge of Amiga development there were suggestions that Commodore intended to move away from the 68000 series to higher performance [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] processors, such as the [[PA-RISC]].<ref name=\"actuator\" /><ref name=\"Haynie\" /> However, these ideas were never developed before Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Despite this, third-party manufacturers designed upgrades featuring a combination of 68000 series and PowerPC processors along with a PowerPC native [[microkernel]] and software.<ref name=\"AutoP5-6\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-7\" /> Later Amiga clones featured [[PowerPC]] processors only.\n\n=== Custom chipset ===\nThe custom chipset at the core of the Amiga design appeared in three distinct generations, with a large degree of backward-compatibility. The [[Original Chip Set]] (OCS) appeared with the launch of the A1000 in 1985. OCS was eventually followed by the modestly improved [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set|Enhanced Chip Set]] (ECS) in 1990 and finally by the partly 32-bit [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA) in 1992. Each chipset consists of several coprocessors which handle [[blitter|graphics acceleration]], digital audio, [[direct memory access]] and communication between various peripherals (e.g., CPU, memory and floppy disks). In addition, some models featured auxiliary [[Amiga custom chips|custom chip]]s which performed tasks such as [[SCSI]] control and display de-interlacing.\n\n==== Graphics ====\n[[File:HAM6example.png|thumb|A 4096 color [[Hold-And-Modify|HAM]] picture created with [[Photon Paint]] in 1989]]\n\nAll Amiga systems can display full-screen animated graphics with 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 ([[Amiga Halfbrite mode|EHB Mode]]), or 4096 colors ([[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM Mode]]). Models with the AGA chipset (A1200 and A4000) also have non-EHB 64, 128, 256, and {{nowrap|262144}} ([[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM8 Mode]]) color modes and a palette expanded from 4096 to [[True Color|16.8 million colors]].\n\nThe Amiga chipset can ''[[genlock]]'', which is the ability to adjust its own screen refresh timing to match an incoming NTSC or PAL video signal. When combined with setting transparency, this allows an Amiga to overlay an external video source with graphics. This ability made the Amiga popular for many applications, and provides the ability to do [[Character generator|character generation]] and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects far more cheaply than earlier systems. This ability has been frequently utilized by wedding videographers, TV stations and their weather forecasting divisions (for weather graphics and radar), advertising channels, music video production, and desktop videographers. The [[NewTek]] [[Video Toaster]] was made possible by the genlock ability of the Amiga.\n\nIn 1988, the release of the Amiga A2024 fixed-frequency [[monochrome]] monitor with built-in [[framebuffer]] and flicker fixer hardware provided the Amiga with a choice of high-resolution graphic modes (1024\u00d7800 for NTSC and 1024\u00d71024 for PAL).<ref name=\"AutoP5-8\" />\n\n==== ReTargetable Graphics ====\n{{main|ReTargetable Graphics}}\n\nReTargetable Graphics is an [[application programming interface|API]] for [[device driver]]s mainly used by 3rd party graphics hardware to interface with AmigaOS via a set of [[library (computing)|libraries]]. The software libraries may include software tools to adjust [[Display resolution|resolution]], screen colors, [[Cursor (computers)#Mouse cursor|pointers]] and screenmodes. The standard [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition interface]] is limited to [[color depth|display depths]] of [[8-bit]]s, while RTG makes it possible to handle higher depths like [[24-bit]]s.\n\n==== Sound ====\nThe sound chip, named Paula, supports four [[pulse-code modulation|PCM]]-sample-based sound channels (two for the left speaker and two for the right) with 8-bit resolution for each channel and a 6-bit volume control per channel. The analog output is connected to a low-pass filter, which filters out high-frequency aliases when the Amiga is using a lower sampling rate (see [[Nyquist frequency]]). The brightness of the Amiga's power LED is used to indicate the status of the Amiga's low-pass filter. The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness, and deactivated when dimmed (or off on older A500 Amigas). On Amiga 1000 (and first Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000 model), the power LED had no relation to the filter's status, and a wire needed to be manually soldered between pins on the sound chip to disable the filter. Paula can read directly from the system's [[Random-access memory|RAM]], using direct memory access (DMA), making sound playback without CPU intervention possible.\n\nAlthough the hardware is limited to four separate sound channels, software such as ''[[OctaMED]]'' uses software mixing to allow eight or more virtual channels, and it was possible for software to mix two hardware channels to achieve a single 14-bit resolution channel by playing with the volumes of the channels in such a way that one of the source channels contributes the most significant bits and the other the least.\n\nThe quality of the Amiga's sound output, and the fact that the hardware is ubiquitous and easily addressed by software, were standout features of Amiga hardware unavailable on PC platforms for years. Third-party sound cards exist that provide [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] functions, multi-track [[direct-to-disk recording]], multiple hardware sound channels and 16-bit and beyond resolutions. A retargetable sound API called [[AHI (Amiga)|AHI]] was developed allowing these cards to be used transparently by the [[Operating system|OS]] and software.\n\n=== Kickstart firmware ===\n{{Main|Kickstart (Amiga)}}\n\nKickstart is the [[firmware]] upon which AmigaOS is [[booting|bootstrap]]ped. Its purpose is to initialize the Amiga hardware and core components of AmigaOS and then attempt to boot from a [[Booting|bootable]] [[volume (computing)|volume]], such as a floppy disk or hard disk drive. Most models (excluding the Amiga 1000) come equipped with Kickstart on an embedded [[Read-only memory|ROM-chip]].\n\n=== Keyboard and mouse ===\n[[File:Amiga Mouse.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Amiga mouse]]\n\nThe keyboard on Amiga computers is similar to that found on a mid 80s IBM PC: Ten function keys, a numeric keypad, and four separate directional arrow keys. Caps Lock and Control share space to the left of A. Missing are the Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys: These are accomplished on Amigas by pressing shift and the appropriate arrow key. The Amiga keyboard adds a Help key, which a function key usually acts as on PCs (usually F1). In addition to the Control and Alt modifier keys, the Amiga has 2 'Amiga' keys, rendered as 'Open Amiga' and 'Closed Amiga' similar to the Open/Closed Apple logo keys on Apple II keyboards. The left is used to manipulate the operating system (moving screens and the like) and the right delivered commands to the application. The absence of Num lock frees space for more math symbols around the number pad. Contemporary Macintosh computers, for comparison, lack function keys completely.\n\nThe mouse has two buttons like Windows, but unlike Windows pressing and holding the right button replaces the system [[Status bar|status line]] at the top of the screen with a Maclike [[menu bar]]. As with Apple's [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] prior to [[Mac OS 8]], menu options are selected by releasing the button over that option, not by left clicking. Menu items that have a boolean toggle state can be left clicked whilst the menu is kept open with the right button, this allows the user - for example - to set some selected text to bold, underline and italics all at once.\n\nThe mouse plugs into one of two [[Atari joystick port]]s used for [[joystick]]s, [[Paddle (game controller)|game paddles]], and [[graphics tablet]]s. Although compatible with [[analog stick|analog joystick]]s, Atari-style digital joysticks became standard.<ref name=\"anderson198710\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1987-10-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_089_1987_Oct#page/n17/mode/2up | title=Close Up: The Amiga 500 | work=Compute! | date=October 1987 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | author=Anderson, Rhett | pages=16\u201319}}</ref>\n\n=== Other peripherals and expansions ===\n[[File:Amiga Sound Sampling Hardware.jpg|thumb|upright|8-bit sound sampling hardware for the Amiga]]\n\nThe Amiga was one of the first computers for which inexpensive sound sampling and video digitization accessories were available. As a result of this and the Amiga's audio and video capabilities, the Amiga became a popular system for editing and producing both music and video.\n\nMany expansion boards were produced for Amiga computers to improve the performance and capability of the hardware, such as memory expansions, [[SCSI]] controllers, CPU boards, and graphics boards. Other upgrades include [[genlock]]s, network cards for [[Ethernet]], [[modem]]s, [[sound card]]s and samplers, [[Video capture|video digitizers]], extra [[serial port]]s, and [[Parallel ATA|IDE]] controllers. Additions after the demise of Commodore company are [[USB]] cards. The most popular upgrades were memory, SCSI controllers and CPU accelerator cards. These were sometimes combined into the one device.\n\nEarly CPU accelerator cards feature full 32-bit CPUs of the 68000 family such as the [[Motorola 68020]] and [[Motorola 68030]], almost always with 32-bit memory and usually with [[Floating-point unit|FPUs]] and [[Memory management unit|MMUs]] or the facility to add them. Later designs feature the [[Motorola 68040]] or [[Motorola 68060]]. Both CPUs feature integrated FPUs and MMUs. Many CPU accelerator cards also had integrated SCSI controllers.\n\nPhase5 designed the [[PowerUP (accelerator)|PowerUP]] boards ([[Blizzard PPC]] and [[PowerUP (accelerator)#Cyberstorm PPC|CyberStorm PPC]]) featuring both a 68k (a 68040 or 68060) and a PowerPC (603 or 604) CPU, which are able to run the two CPUs at the same time and share the system memory. The PowerPC CPU on PowerUP boards is usually used as a coprocessor for heavy computations; a powerful CPU is needed to run [[MAME]] for example, but even decoding [[JPEG]] pictures and [[MP3]] audio was considered heavy computation at the time. It is also possible to ignore the 68k CPU and run [[Linux]] on the PPC via project Linux APUS, but a PowerPC-native AmigaOS promised by Amiga Technologies GmbH was not available when the PowerUP boards first appeared.<ref name=\"AutoP5-9\" />\n\n24-bit graphics cards and video cards were also available. Graphics cards were designed primarily for 2D artwork production, workstation use, and later, gaming. Video cards are designed for inputting and outputting video signals, and processing and manipulating video.\n\nIn the North American market, the ''NewTek [[Video Toaster]]'' was a video effects board which turned the Amiga into an affordable video processing computer which found its way into many professional video environments. One particularly well-known use was to create the special effects in early series of ''[[Babylon 5]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/games/cgi-first-introduced-to-tv-in-babylon-5-by-mit-presentor-771051/ |work=geek.com|title= CGI first introduced to TV in Babylon 5 by MIT presentor &#91;sic&#93;}}</ref> Due to its [[NTSC]]-only design, it did not find a market in countries that used the [[PAL]] standard, such as in Europe. In those countries, the ''OpalVision'' card was popular, although less featured and supported than the Video Toaster. Low-cost [[Time base correction|time base correctors]] (TBC) specifically designed to work with the Toaster quickly came to market, most of which were designed as standard Amiga bus cards.\n\nVarious manufacturers started producing PCI busboards for the A1200, A3000 and A4000, allowing standard Amiga computers to use PCI cards such as graphics cards, [[Sound Blaster]] sound cards, 10/100 Ethernet cards, USB cards, and television tuner cards. Other manufacturers produced hybrid boards which contained an Intel x86 series chip, allowing the Amiga to emulate a PC.\n\nPowerPC upgrades with Wide SCSI controllers, PCI busboards with Ethernet, sound and 3D graphics cards, and tower cases allowed the A1200 and A4000 to survive well into the late nineties.\n\nExpansion boards were made by [[Richmond Sound Design]] that allow their [[show control]] and [[sound design]] software to communicate with their custom hardware frames either by either ribbon cable or fiber optic cable for long distances, allowing the Amiga to control up to eight million digitally controlled external audio, lighting, automation, relay and voltage control channels spread around a large theme park, for example.

The PowerPC based [[AmigaOne]] computers were later marketed since 2002. Several companies and private persons have also released Amiga [[Clone (computing)|clones]] and still do so today.\n\n=== Commodore Amiga ===\n[[File:Amiga 1000DP.jpg|thumb|The [[Amiga 1000]] (1985) was the first model released.<ref name=\"AutoP5-13\" />]]\n[[File:Amiiga4000DP.jpg|thumb|The [[Amiga 4000]] (1992) was the last desktop computer made by Commodore.]]\n\nThe first Amiga model, the Amiga 1000, was launched in 1985. In 2006, [[PC World]] rated the Amiga 1000 as the seventh greatest PC of all time, stating \"Years ahead of its time, the Amiga was the world's first multimedia, multitasking personal computer\".<ref name=\"AutoP5-14\" />\n\nCommodore updated the desktop line of Amiga computers with the [[Amiga 2000]] in 1987, the [[Amiga 3000]] in 1990, and the [[Amiga 4000]] in 1992, each offering improved capabilities and expansion options. However, the best selling models were the budget models, particularly the highly successful [[Amiga 500]] (1987) and the [[Amiga 1200]] (1992). The [[Amiga 500+]] (1991) was the shortest lived model, replacing the Amiga 500 and lasting only six months until it was phased out and replaced with the [[Amiga 600]] (1992), which in turn was also quickly replaced by the Amiga 1200.<ref name=\"AutoP5-15\" />\n\nThe [[Commodore CDTV|CDTV]], launched in 1991, was a [[CD-ROM]] based all-in-one multimedia system. It was an early attempt at a multi-purpose multimedia appliance in an era before multimedia consoles and CD-ROM drives were common. Unfortunately for Commodore, the system never achieved any real commercial success. Like the [[Commodore 64 Games System|Commodore 64GS]] that was a video game console based on a computer, the CDTV was designed as a video game console and multimedia platform. It had existed before the Sony [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn]], but had influenced them{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. It competed with the [[TurboGrafx-16|Turbo-Grafx CD]] and [[Sega CD]] system add ons when it was being sold.\n\nCommodore's last Amiga offering before filing for bankruptcy was an attempt to capture a portion of the highly competitive 1990s console market with the [[Amiga CD32]] (1993), a 32-bit CD-ROM games console. Although discontinued after Commodore's demise it met with moderate commercial success in Europe. The CD32 was a next generation CDTV, and it was designed to save Commodore by entering the growing video game console market.\n\nFollowing purchase of Commodore's assets by Escom in 1995, the A1200 and A4000T continued to be sold in small quantities until 1996, though the ground lost since the initial launch and the prohibitive expense of these units meant that the Amiga line never regained any real popularity.\n\nSeveral Amiga models contained references to songs by the [[rock music|rock]] band [[The B-52's]]. Early A500 units had the words \"B52/ROCK LOBSTER\"<ref name=\"AutoP5-16\" /> [[Printed circuit board#Manufacturing|silk-screen printed]] onto their [[printed circuit board]], a reference to the song \"[[Rock Lobster]]\" The [[Amiga 600]] referenced \"JUNE BUG\" (after the song \"Junebug\") and the [[Amiga 1200]] had \"CHANNEL Z\" (after \"[[Channel Z (song)|Channel Z]]\").,<ref name=\"AutoP5-17\" /> and the CD-32 had \"Spellbound.\"\n\n=== AmigaOS 4 systems ===\n{{Main|AmigaOS 4}}\n\n[[AmigaOS 4]] is designed for PowerPC Amiga systems. It is mainly based on AmigaOS 3.1 source code, with some parts of version 3.9. Currently runs on both Amigas equipped with CyberstormPPC or BlizzardPPC accelerator boards, on the Teron series based [[AmigaOne]] computers built by [[Eyetech]] under license by [[Amiga, Inc.]], on the [[Pegasos|Pegasos II]] from [[Genesi]]/[[Genesi|bPlan GmbH]], on the [[ACube Systems Srl]] [[Sam440ep]] / [[Sam460ex]] / AmigaOne 500 systems and on the A-EON [[AmigaOne X1000]].\n\nAmigaOS 4.0 had been available only in developer pre-releases for numerous years until it was officially released in December 2006.<ref name=\"AutoP5-18\" /> Due to the nature of some provisions of the contract between Amiga Inc. and [[Hyperion Entertainment]] (the Belgian company which is developing the OS), the commercial AmigaOS 4 had been available only to licensed buyers of AmigaOne motherboards.\n\nAmigaOS 4.0 for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards was released in November 2007.<ref name=\"AutoP5-19\" /> Version 4.1 was released in August 2008 for AmigaOne systems,<ref name=\"AutoP5-20\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-21\" /> and in May 2011 for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards.<ref name=\"AutoP5-22\" /> The most recent release of AmigaOS for all supported platforms is 4.1 update 5.<ref name=\"AutoP5-23\" /> Starting with release 4.1 update 4 there is an Emulation drawer containing official AmigaOS 3.x ROMs (all classic Amiga models including CD32) and relative Workbench files.\n\n[[Acube Systems]] entered an agreement with Hyperion under which it has ported AmigaOS 4 to its [[Sam440ep]] and [[Sam460ex]] line of PowerPC-based motherboards.<ref name=\"AutoP5-24\" /> In 2009 a version for [[Pegasos II]] was released in co-operation with Acube Systems.<ref name=\"AutoP5-25\" /> In 2012, A-EON Technology Ltd manufactured and released the [[AmigaOne X1000]] to consumers through their partner, [[Amiga Kit]] who provided end-user support, assembly and worldwide distribution of the new system.\n\n=== Amiga hardware clones ===\nLong-time Amiga developer MacroSystem entered the Amiga-clone market with their [[DraCo]] non-linear video editing system.<ref name=\"AutoP5-26\" /> It appears in two versions, initially a tower model and later a cube. DraCo expanded upon and combined a number of earlier expansion cards developed for Amiga (VLabMotion, Toccata, WarpEngine, RetinaIII) into a true Amiga-clone powered by the [[Motorola 68060]] processor. The DraCo can run AmigaOS 3.1 up through AmigaOS 3.9. It is the only Amiga-based system to support [[FireWire]] for video [[Input/output|I/O]]. DraCo also offers an Amiga-compatible [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro-II]] expansion bus and introduced a faster custom DraCoBus, capable of {{nowrap|30 MB/sec}} transfer rates (faster than Commodore's [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro-III]]). The technology was later used in the Casablanca system, a set-top-box also designed for non-linear video editing.\n\nIn 1998, Index Information released the Access, an Amiga-clone similar to the Amiga 1200, but on a motherboard which could fit into a standard [[Drive bay#5%\"|5\u00bc\" drive bay]]. It features either a [[Motorola 68020|68020]] or [[Motorola 68030|68030]] CPU, with a redesigned [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset, and runs AmigaOS 3.1.\n\nIn 1998, former Amiga employees (John Smith, Peter Kittel, [[Dave Haynie]] and Andy Finkel to mention few) formed a new company called PIOS. Their hardware platform, PIOS One, was aimed at Amiga, Atari and Macintosh users. The company was renamed to Met@box in 1999 until it folded.<ref name=\"AutoP5-27\" />\n\nThe NatAmi (short for ''Native Amiga'') hardware project began in 2005 with the aim of designing and building an Amiga clone motherboard that is enhanced with modern features.<ref name=\"AutoP5-28\" /> The NatAmi motherboard is a standard [[Mini-ITX]]-compatible form factor computer motherboard, powered by a Motorola/Freescale [[68060]] and its chipset. It is compatible with the original Amiga chipset, which has been inscribed on a programmable FPGA [[Altera]] chip on the board. The NatAmi is the second Amiga clone project after the [[Minimig]] motherboard, and its history is very similar to that of the [[C-One]] mainboard developed by [[Jeri Ellsworth]] and Jens Sch\u00f6nfeld. From a commercial point of view, Natami's circuitry and design are currently [[Proprietary software|closed source]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} One goal of the NatAmi project is to design an Amiga-compatible motherboard that includes up-to-date features but that does not rely on emulation (as in [[WinUAE]]), modern PC [[Intel]] components, or a modern [[PowerPC]] mainboard. As such, NatAmi is not intended to become another evolutionary heir to classic Amigas, such as with [[AmigaOne]] or [[Pegasos]] computers. This \"purist\" philosophy essentially limits the resulting processor speed but puts the focus on bandwidth and low latencies. The developers also recreated the entire Amiga chipset, freeing it from legacy Amiga limitations such as two [[megabyte]]s of audio and video graphics RAM as in the [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA chipset]], and rebuilt this new chipset by programming a modern [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] [[Altera]] Cyclone IV chip. Later, the developers decided to create from scratch a new software-form processor chip, codenamed \"N68050\" that resides in the physical Altera FPGA programmable chip.<ref name=\"AutoP5-29\" />\n\nIn 2006, two new Amiga clones were announced, both using [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] based hardware synthesis to replace the Amiga [[Original Chip Set|OCS]] custom chipset. The first, the [[Minimig]], is a personal project of Dutch engineer Dennis van Weeren. Referred to as \"new Amiga hardware\",<ref name=\"minimig\" /> the original model was built on a [[Xilinx]] Spartan-3 development board, but soon a dedicated board was developed. The minimig uses the FPGA to reproduce the custom Denise, Agnus, Paula and [[Amiga custom chips#Gary|Gary]] chips as well as both 8520 [[MOS Technology CIA|CIAs]] and implements a simple version of [[Amiga custom chips#Amber|Amber]]. The rest of the chips are an actual 68000 CPU, ram chips, and a PIC microcontroller for [[BIOS]] control.<ref name=\"minimig\" /> The design for Minimig was released as [[Open-source software|open-source]] on July 25, 2007. In February 2008, an Italian company [[Acube Systems]] began selling Minimig boards. A third party upgrade replaces the PIC microcontroller with a more powerful ARM processor, providing more functionality such as write access and support for hard disk images. The Minimig core has been ported to the FPGArcade \"Replay\" board. The Replay uses an FPGA with about {{nowrap|3 times}} more capacity and which does support the AGA chipset and a [[Motorola 68020|68020]] [[Soft core (synthesis)|soft core]] with [[Motorola 68030|68030]] capabilities. The Replay board is designed to implement many older computers and classic arcade machines.\n\nThe second is the Clone-A system announced by [[Individual Computers]]. As of mid 2007 it has been shown in its development form, with FPGA-based boards replacing the Amiga chipset and mounted on an Amiga 500 motherboard.<ref name=\"individual\" />\n\n=== Emulation ===\n{{Main|Amiga emulation}}\n\nLike many popular but discontinued platforms, the Amiga has been emulated so that software developed for the Amiga can be run on other computer platforms without the original hardware. Such emulators attempt to replicate the functionality of the Amiga architecture in software. As mentioned above, attempts have also been made to replicate the Amiga chipset in [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] chips.<ref name=\"AutoP5-31\" />\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of emulation is the design of the Amiga chipset, which relies on cycle-critical timings. As a result, early emulators did not always achieve the intended results though later emulator versions can now accurately reproduce the behavior of Amiga systems.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n== Operating systems ==\n\n=== AmigaOS ===\n[[File:AmigaOne X1000 02.jpg|thumb|AmigaOne X1000 running AmigaOS 4.1]]\n\n{{Main|AmigaOS}}\n{{quote\n| \"[AmigaOS] remains one of the great operating systems of the past 20 years, incorporating a small kernel and tremendous [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] capabilities the likes of which have only recently been developed in [[OS/2]] and [[Windows NT]]. The biggest difference is that the AmigaOS could operate fully and multitask in as little as {{nowrap|250 K}} of address space.\n| ''[[John C. Dvorak]], PC Magazine'', October 1996.<ref name=\"AutoP5-32\" />\n}}\n\nAmigaOS is a single-user multitasking [[operating system]]. It was developed first by Commodore International, and initially introduced in 1985 with the Amiga 1000. Original versions run on the Motorola 68000 series of microprocessors, while AmigaOS 4 runs only on PowerPC microprocessors. At the time of release AmigaOS put an operating system that was well ahead of its time into the hands of the average consumer. It was one of the first commercially available consumer operating systems for personal computers to implement [[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]] multitasking.\n\nAnother notable feature was the combined use of both a [[command-line interface]] and [[graphical user interface]]. [[AmigaDOS]] was the disk operating system and command line portion of the OS and [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] the native graphical windowing, [[Icon (computing)|icon]]s, menu and pointer environment for file management and launching applications. Notably, AmigaDOS allowed long [[filename]]s (up to 107 characters) with [[Whitespace character|whitespace]] and did not require [[filename extension]]s. The [[windowing system]] and user interface engine which handles all input events is called [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]].<ref name=\"amiga_intuition_ref\" />\n\nThe multi-tasking kernel is called [[Exec (Amiga)|Exec]]. It acts as a scheduler for tasks running on the system, providing pre-emptive multitasking with prioritised round-robin scheduling. It enabled true pre-emptive multitasking in as little as 256&nbsp;KB of free memory.<ref name=\"amiga_rkm_libs_exec\" /><ref name=\"holloway_oo_amiga_exec\" />\n\nAmigaOS is one of the few microkernel-based operating systems not to implement [[memory protection]], though this lack is common amongst many of its contemporary operating systems. The lack of memory protection is because the [[Motorola 68000|68000]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] does not include a [[memory management unit]] and therefore there is no way to enforce protection of memory.<ref name=\"google.groups.com (Memory Protection)\" /> Although this speeds and eases [[inter-process communication]] because programs can communicate by simply passing a [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] back and forth, the lack of memory protection made the AmigaOS more vulnerable to [[Crash (computing)|crashes]] from badly behaving [[Computer program|programs]] than other multitasking systems that did implement memory protection,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lr8ldHhh_wsC&lpg=PA74&ots=9a5En0ab4F&pg=PA74 |title=Tech Book 1 - Published articles Oct 2006 - June 2008 - Michael Reed - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref> and Amiga OS is fundamentally incapable of enforcing any form of security model since any program had full access to the system. A co-operational memory protection feature was implemented in AmigaOS 4 and could be retrofitted to old AmigaOS systems using Enforcer or CyberGuard tools.\n\nThe problem was somewhat exacerbated by Commodore's initial decision to release documentation relating not only to the OS's underlying software routines, but also to the hardware itself, enabling intrepid programmers who had developed their skills on the [[Commodore 64]] to [[PEEK and POKE|POKE]] the hardware directly, as was done on the older platform. While the decision to release the documentation was a popular one and allowed the creation of fast, sophisticated sound and graphics routines in games and demos, it also contributed to system instability as some programmers lacked the expertise to program at this level. For this reason, when the new [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset was released, [[Commodore International|Commodore]] declined to release low-level documentation in an attempt to force developers into using the approved software routines.\n\n==== Influence on other operating systems ====\nAmigaOS directly or indirectly inspired the development of various operating systems. [[MorphOS]] and [[AROS Research Operating System|AROS]] clearly inherit heavily from the structure of AmigaOS as explained directly in articles regarding these two operating systems. AmigaOS also influenced [[BeOS]], which featured a centralized system of [[Amiga support and maintenance software#Datatypes|Datatypes]], similar to that present in AmigaOS. Likewise, [[DragonFly BSD]] was also inspired by AmigaOS as stated by Dragonfly developer Matthew Dillon who is a former Amiga developer.<ref name=\"AutoP5-33\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-34\" /> [[WindowLab]] and [[amiwm]] are among several [[window manager]]s for the [[X Window System]] seek to mimic the Workbench interface. IBM licensed the Amiga GUI from Commodore in exchange for the REXX language license. This allowed OS/2 to have the WPS (Work Place Shell) GUI shell for OS/2 2.0 a 32-bit operating system.<ref>[http://www.os2bbs.com/os2news/OS2Warp.html OS/2 News, OS/2 BBS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020022353/http://www.os2bbs.com/os2news/OS2Warp.html |date=October 20, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Doug McIlroy |url=http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch03s02.html#os_2 |title=OS/2 Eric S. Raymond Operating System Comparisons The Art of Unix Programming |publisher=Catb.org |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref>\n\n=== Unix and Unix-like systems ===\nCommodore-Amiga produced [[Amiga Unix]], informally known as Amix, based on AT&T [[UNIX System V|SVR4]]. It supports the [[Amiga 2500]] and Amiga 3000 and is included with the [[Amiga 3000UX]]. Among other unusual features of Amix is a hardware-accelerated windowing system which can scroll windows without copying data. Amix is not supported on the later Amiga systems based on [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[Motorola 68060|68060]] processors.\n\nOther, still maintained, operating systems are available for the classic Amiga platform, including Linux and [[NetBSD]]. Both require a CPU with [[Memory management unit|MMU]] such as the [[Motorola 68020|68020]] with [[Motorola 68851|68851]] or full versions of the [[Motorola 68030|68030]], [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[Motorola 68060|68060]]. There is also a version of Linux for Amigas with PowerPC accelerator cards. [[Debian]] and [[Yellow Dog Linux]] can run on the AmigaOne.\n\nThere is an official, older version of [[OpenBSD]]. The last Amiga release is 3.2. [[MINIX]] 1.5.10 also runs on Amiga.<ref name=\"AutoP5-35\" />\n\n=== Emulating other systems ===\n{{Main|Emulation on the Amiga}}\n\nThe Amiga is able to emulate other computer platforms ranging from many 8-bit systems such as the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], Nintendo Game Boy, Nintendo Entertainment System, [[Apple II]] and the [[TRS-80]]. The Commodore PC-Transformer software emulated an IBM 5150 at 1&nbsp;MHz in Monochrome mode. Later PC-Bridgecards were a full hardware PC on a card with 8086/80286/80386 Intel chips running MS-DOS and Windows in an Amiga window. A-Max emulated an Apple Macintosh using a serial port dongle that had a Macintosh ROM on it. The Amiga had the same 68000 CPU as the Macintosh and, using a Macintosh emulator, could run Mac 68K operating systems and programs. However, the Amiga could not directly read Macintosh 3.5\" floppies due to their proprietary format. Further, it required a compatible Macintosh for a copy of its ROM. The Atari ST was also emulated. [[MAME]] (the arcade machine emulator) is also available for Amiga systems with PPC accelerator card upgrades.\n\n== Amiga software ==\n{{Main|Amiga software}}\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s the platform became particularly popular for gaming, [[demoscene]] activities and creative software uses. During this time commercial developers marketed a wide range of games and creative software, often developing titles simultaneously for the [[Atari ST]] due to the similar hardware architecture. Popular creative software included [[3D computer graphics software|3D rendering]] (ray-tracing) packages, [[raster graphics editor|bitmap graphics editors]], [[desktop video]] software, software development packages and \"[[Tracker (music software)|tracker]]\" music editors.\n\nUntil the late 1990s the Amiga remained a popular platform for non-commercial software, often developed by enthusiasts, and much of which was freely redistributable. An on-line archive, [[Aminet]], was created in 1992 and until around 1996 was the largest public archive of software, art and documents for any platform.\n\n== Marketing ==\n[[File:Amiga-90sLogo.gif|thumb|Logo used in the US on some product packaging for the Amiga 500{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}]]\n[[File:Recent Amiga.svg|thumb|Amiga Technologies logo incorporating the \"Boing Ball\" (1996)]]\n\nThe name ''Amiga'' was chosen by the developers from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for a female friend, because they knew Spanish,<ref name=\"AutoP5-36\" /> and because it occurred before [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Atari]] alphabetically. It also conveyed the message that the Amiga computer line was \"user friendly\" as a pun or play on words.<ref name=\"AutoP5-37\" />\n\nThe first official Amiga logo was a rainbow-colored double [[check mark]]. In later marketing material Commodore largely dropped the checkmark and used logos styled with various typefaces. Although it was never adopted as a [[trademark]] by Commodore, the \"Boing Ball\" has been synonymous with Amiga since its launch. It became an unofficial and enduring theme after a visually impressive animated demonstration at the 1984 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1984 showing a checkered ball bouncing and rotating. Following Escom's purchase of Commodore in 1996, the Boing Ball theme was incorporated into a new logo.<ref name=\"AutoP5-38\" />\n\nEarly Commodore advertisements attempted to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine, though the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer.<ref name=ad1987a/><ref name=ad1987b/> Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s Commodore primarily placed advertising in computer magazines and occasionally in national newspapers and on television.\n\n== Legacy ==\nSince the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line:\n\n* [[Genesi]] sold PowerPC based hardware under the [[Pegasos]] brand running AmigaOS and [[MorphOS]];\n* [[Eyetech]] sold PowerPC based hardware under the [[AmigaOne]] brand from 2002 to 2005 running AmigaOS 4;\n* [[Amiga Kit]] distributes and sells PowerPC based hardware under the [[AmigaOne]] brand from 2010 to present day running [[AmigaOS 4]];\n* [[ACube Systems]] sells the AmigaOS 3 compatible [[Minimig]] system with a Freescale MC68SEC000 CPU (Motorola 68000 compatible) and AmigaOS 4 compatible [[Sam440ep|Sam440]] / [[Sam460ex|Sam460]] / AmigaOne 500 systems with PowerPC processors;\n* A-EON Technology Ltd sells the AmigaOS 4 compatible [[AmigaOne X1000]] system with P.A. Semi [[PWRficient]] PA6T-1682M processor.\n* [[Amiga Kit]] Amiga Store, Vesalia Computer and ASB Computer sell numerous items from aftermarket components to refurbished classic systems.\n\nAmigaOS and MorphOS are commercial proprietary operating systems. AmigaOS 4, based on AmigaOS 3.1 source code with some parts of version 3.9, is developed by [[Hyperion Entertainment]] and runs on PowerPC based hardware. MorphOS, based on some parts of AROS source code, is developed by MorphOS Team and is continued on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and other PowerPC based hardware.\n\nThere is also [[AROS Research Operating System|AROS]], a free and open source operating system (re-implementation of the AmigaOS 3.1 APIs), for Amiga 68k, x86 and ARM hardware (one version runs Linux-hosted on the [[Raspberry Pi]]). In particular, AROS for Amiga 68k hardware aims to create an open source Kickstart ROM replacement for emulation purpose and/or for use on real \"classic\" hardware.<ref name=\"AutoP5-39\" />\n\n== Amiga community ==\nAfter Commodore went bankrupt in 1994, there remained a very active Amiga community, which continued to support the platform long after mainstream commercial vendors abandoned it. The most popular Amiga magazine, ''[[Amiga Format]]'', continued to publish editions until 2000, some six years after Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Another magazine, ''[[Amiga Active]]'', was launched in 1999 and was published until 2001. Several notable magazines are in publication today: ''Amiga Future'',<ref name=\"AutoP5-40\" /> which is available in both English and German; ''Bitplane.it'',<ref name=\"AutoP5-41\" /> a bi-monthly magazine in Italian; and ''AmigaPower'',<ref name=\"AutoP5-42\" /> a long-running French magazine.\n\nIn spite of declining interest in the platform there was a bi-weekly specialist column in the UK weekly magazine [[Micro Mart]]. There is also a fan website,<ref name=\"AutoP5-43\" /> that has served as a community discussion and support resource since the 1994 bankruptcy. Other popular English-language ''[[Internet forum|forums]]'' also exist, particularly amiga.org since 1994 and amigaworld.net<ref name=\"AutoP5-44\" /> and English Amiga Board.<ref name=\"AutoP5-45\" />\n\n== Notable historic uses ==\n{{fiction trivia|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe Amiga series of computers found a place in early computer graphic design and television presentation. Below are some examples of notable uses and users:\n* Season 1 and part of season 2 of the television series ''[[Babylon 5]]'' were rendered in LightWave 3D on Amigas.<ref name=\"lurk-effects\" /><ref name=\"lurk-thornton\" /> Other television series using Amigas for special effects included ''[[SeaQuest DSV]]''<ref name=\"AutoP5-46\" /> and ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]''.<ref name=\"AutoP5-47\" />\n\nIn addition, many other celebrities and notable individuals have made use of the Amiga:<ref name=\"AutoP5-48\" />\n\n* [[Andy Warhol]] was an early user of the Amiga and appeared at the launch,<ref name=\"AutoP5-49\" /> where he made a computer artwork of [[Debbie Harry]].<ref name=\"AutoP5-50\" /> Warhol used the Amiga to create a new style of art made with computers, and was the author of a multimedia opera called ''[[You Are the One (Andy Warhol)|You Are the One]]'' which consists of an animated sequence featuring images of actress [[Marilyn Monroe]] assembled in a short movie with a soundtrack. The video was discovered on two old Amiga floppies in a drawer in Warhol's studio and repaired in 2006 by the Detroit [[Museum of New Art]].<ref name=\"AutoP5-51\" /> The pop artist has been quoted as saying: ''\"The thing I like most about doing this kind of work on the Amiga is that it looks like my work in other media\"''.<ref name=\"AutoP5-52\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-53\" />\n* Artist [[Jean Giraud|Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud]] credits the Amiga he bought for his son as a bridge to learning about \"using paint box programs\".<ref name=\"AutoP5-58\" /> He uploaded some of his early experiments to the file sharing forums on [[CompuServe]].\n* The [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' contains a computer animated music video parody of the [[Dire Straits]] song \"[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]\", titled \"[[Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*]]\". According to the DVD commentary track, this spoof was created on an Amiga home computer.<ref name=\"AutoP5-60\" />\n* [[Rolf Harris]] used an Amiga to digitize his hand-drawn art work for animation on his television series, ''Rolf's Cartoon Club''.\n* [[Todd Rundgren]]'s video \"Change Myself\" was produced with Toaster and Lightwave.\n* Scottish pop artist [[Calvin Harris]] composed his 2007 debut album ''[[I Created Disco]]'' with an [[Amiga 1200]].<ref name=\"AutoP5-61\" />\n* [[Susumu Hirasawa]], a [[Japan]]ese [[Progressive rock|progressive]]-[[Electronic music|electronic]] [[artist]] is known for using Amigas to compose and perform music, aid his live shows and make his promotional videos. He has also been inspired by the Amiga, and has referenced it in his lyrics. His December 13, 1994 \"Adios Jay\" Interactive Live Show was dedicated to (then recently deceased) Jay Miner. He also used the Amiga to create the virtual drummer TAINACO, who was a CG rendered figure whose performance was made with Elan Performer and was projected with DCTV. He also composed and performed \"Eastern-boot\", the AmigaOS 4 boot jingle.\n* Electronic musician [[Max Tundra]] also created his three albums with an Amiga 500.<ref name=\"AutoP5-62\" />\n* [[Bob Casale]], keyboardist and guitarist of the [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Devo]] used Amiga computer graphics on the album cover to Devo's album ''[[Total Devo]]''\n* Eric W. Schwartz, a [[furry fandom|furry]] animator, enthusiast and the creator of Sabrina Online and Amy the Squirrel who creates cartoons.\n* Most of [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']]'s music was created on an Amiga computer, converted to MIDI, and then reconverted to the game's music format.<ref name=\"Masuda's blog post about HeartGold/SoulSilver music\">{{cite web|last=Masuda|first=Junichi|title=HIDDEN POWER of masuda|url=http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/?p=185|publisher=GameFreak|accessdate=7 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\nThe Amiga was also used in a number of special purpose applications:\n* Amigas were used in various [[NASA]] laboratories to keep track of low orbiting satellites, and were still used up to 2003/2004 (dismissed and sold in 2006). This is another example of long lifetime reliability of Amiga hardware, as well as professional use. Amigas were also used at Kennedy Space Center to run strip-chart recorders, to format and display data, and control stations of platforms for [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta rocket]] launches.<ref name=\"AutoP5-64\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-65\" />\n* [[Palomar Observatory]] used Amigas to calibrate and control the [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]] in their telescopes, as well as to display and store the digitized images they collected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-13/Info_Issue_13_1987_Jan-Feb#page/n29/mode/2up|title=Info magazine issue 13}}</ref>\n* [[London Transport Museum]] developed their own interactive multi-media software for the CD32. The software included a walkthrough of various exhibits and a virtual tour of the museum.<ref name=\"AutoP5-66\" />\n* Amiga 500 motherboards were used, in conjunction with a [[LaserDisc]] player and [[genlock]] device, in arcade games manufactured by [[American Laser Games]].<ref name=\"AutoP5-67\" />\n* A custom [[Amiga 4000T]] motherboard was used in the HDI 1000 medical ultrasound system built by Advanced Technology Labs (now part of Philips Medical Systems).<ref name=\"AutoP5-68\" />\n* Four Amiga 2000s were used from 1988 to 1991 to develop the digital displays panels installed in the M1-A2 Abrams Main Battle Tank built by General Dynamics Land Systems. In the General Dynamics Simulation Laboratory, the Amigas interfaced with a central simulation environment computer and produced graphics for the display panels. During demonstrations at Fort Knox, the Amigas did not interact with each other, but instead operated in \"remote mode\" because the simulation environment computer was not portable.\n*{{as of|2015}}, the Grand Rapids Public School district still uses a Commodore Amiga 2000 computer, complete with 1200 baud modem, to automate its air conditioning and heating systems for the 19 schools covered by the GRPS district. \"The system controls the start/stop of boilers, the start/stop of fans, pumps, [it] monitors space temperatures, and so on.\" The system has been running day and night for decades.<ref name=\"AutoP5-69\">{{cite news|author=Eric Limer|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a16010/30-year-old-computer-runs-school-heat/|title=One Ancient Commodore Amiga Runs the Heat and AC for 19 Public Schools|publisher=Hearst Digital Media|date=June 12, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://woodtv.com/2015/06/11/1980s-computer-controls-grps-heat-and-ac/|title=1980s computer controls GRPS heat and AC}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Amiga custom chips]]\n* [[AmigaOS]]\n* [[Aminet]]\n* [[Hold-And-Modify]]\n* [[List of Amiga games]]\n* [[Minimig]]\n* [[UAE (emulator)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist\n|colwidth = 30em\n|refs =\n<ref name=\"reimer\">{{cite web |url = https://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/total-share.ars |title = Total share: 30 years of personal computer market share figures |author=Jeremy Reimer |work = Ars Technica |accessdate = April 21, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080421195957/http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/total-share.ars |archivedate = April 21, 2008 |deadurl = no }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"ad1987a\">{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsJ0ZZMuEQs |title = Amiga TV Advert (Celebrity) |website = YouTube |date=2007-01-07 |accessdate = 2012-08-24 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"ad1987b\">{{YouTube|ludrX2s1ZuM|Commodore advert 1987 - TV spot version of 20-minute presentation}} {{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoP5-1\">{{cite web |url = http://www.amigau.com/aig/prototypes/lorraine.html |title = Amiga Lorraine |work = Amiga History Guide |author = Gareth Knight |accessdate = April 21, 2008 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoP5-2\">{{cite web |url = http://www.amigaforever.com/games/ |title = Amiga Games |publisher = Amiga Forever |accessdate = 2012-08-24 }}</ref>\n<!--\n<ref name=\"AutoP5-3\">{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yC4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA39&ots=CtmypWJGu2&pg=PA41 |title = Amiga Demos Its New Machine }}</ref>\n -->\n<ref name=\"amiga_hardware_ref\">{{cite book |author=Commodore-Amiga, Inc. |title = Amiga Hardware Reference Manual |edition = 3rd |series=Amiga Technical Reference Series |year=1991 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |ISBN = 0-201-56776-8 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoP5-4\">{{cite web |url = http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/oneamiga1.html | title = The One for 16-bit Games | accessdate = July 17, 2007 | first = Gareth | last = Knight | work = Amiga History Guide | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070712191820/http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/oneamiga1.html | archivedate= July 12, 2007 | deadurl= no }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoP5-5\">{{cite web | url = http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/s_snippe.htm | title = Amiga Reviews: Zzap 16-Bit Gaming | accessdate = May 23, 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080512010049/http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/s_snippe.htm | archivedate= May 12, 2008 | deadurl= yes | df= }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"actuator\">{{citation | url = http://www.thule.no/haynie/research/acutiatr/docs/acu1.pdf | title=Architecture Specification for Acutiator | first=Dave | last=Haynie | publisher=Commodore International Services Corporation, Technology Division | date=October 18, 1992 }}</ref>\n<ref name=Haynie >{{cite web |url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/haynie3drisc.html |title=CBM's Plans for the RISC-Chipset |author=Dave Haynie |date=1995-01-24 |quote=The initial schedule of 18 months was for the Hombre game machine hardware.

After our people had been on board about one glass, people in the two canoes began to call out to us in gruff, hollow voices. We could not in the least understand any of it; however, when they called out again several times we called back to them as a token answer. But they did not come nearer than a stone's shot. They also blew many times on an instrument, which produced a sound like the moors' trumpets.

He charted the eastern tip of [[Vanua Levu]] and [[Cikobia]] before making his way back into the open sea.\n\nThe expedition turned north-west towards [[New Guinea]] and arrived at Batavia on 15 June 1643.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n== Second major voyage ==\nTasman left [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] on 30 January 1644 on his second voyage with three ships (''Limmen'', ''Zeemeeuw'' and the tender ''Braek''). He followed the south coast of New Guinea eastwards in an attempt to find a passage to the eastern side of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. However, he missed the [[Torres Strait]] between New Guinea and Australia, probably due to the numerous reefs and islands obscuring potential routes, and continued his voyage by following the shore of the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] westwards along the north Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia making observations on [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]], and its people.<ref name=Quanchi>Quanchi, ''Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands'', page 237</ref> He arrived back in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in August 1644.\n\nFrom the point of view of the [[Dutch East India Company]], Tasman's explorations were a disappointment: he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route. Although received modestly, the company was upset to a degree that Tasman did not fully explore the lands he found, and decided that a more \"persistent explorer\" should be chosen for any future expeditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Abel Tasman's great voyage|url=http://tpo.tepapa.govt.nz/ViewTopicExhibitDetail.asp?TopicFileID=0x000ae4f7|work=Abel Tasman's great voyage|publisher=Tai Awatea-Knowledge Net|accessdate=14 September 2011}}</ref> For over a century, until the era of James Cook, Tasmania and New Zealand were not visited by Europeans \u2013 mainland Australia was visited, but usually only by accident.\n\n== Later life ==\nOn 2 November 1644 Abel Tasman was appointed a member of the Council of Justice at Batavia. He went to Sumatra in 1646, and in August 1647 to Siam (now [[Thailand]]) with letters from the company to the King. In May 1648 he was in charge of an expedition sent to [[Manila]] to try to intercept and loot the Spanish silver ships coming from America, but he had no success and returned to Batavia in January 1649. In November 1649 he was charged and found guilty of having in the previous year hanged one of his men without trial, was suspended from his office of commander, fined, and made to pay compensation to the relatives of the sailor. On 5 January 1651 he was formally reinstated in his rank and spent his remaining years at Batavia. He was in good circumstances, being one of the larger landowners in the town. He died at Batavia on 10 October 1659 and was survived by his second wife and a daughter by his first wife. His property was divided between his wife and his daughter by his first marriage.

The picture represents a portion of its real [[locus (mathematics)|locus]].]]\n{{General geometry |branches}}\n\n'''Algebraic geometry''' is a branch of [[mathematics]], classically studying [[zero of a function|zeros]] of [[multivariate polynomial]]s. Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from [[commutative algebra]], for solving  [[geometry|geometrical problems]] about these sets of zeros.\n\nThe fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], which are geometric manifestations of [[solution set|solutions]] of [[systems of polynomial equations]]. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: [[plane algebraic curve]]s, which include [[line (geometry)|lines]], [[circle]]s, [[parabola]]s, [[ellipse]]s, [[hyperbola]]s, [[cubic curve]]s like [[elliptic curve]]s, and quartic curves like [[lemniscate of Bernoulli|lemniscate]]s and [[Cassini oval]]s. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given [[polynomial equation]]. Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the [[singular point of a curve|singular point]]s, the [[inflection point]]s and the [[point at infinity|points at infinity]]. More advanced questions involve the [[topology]] of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations.\n\nAlgebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as [[complex analysis]], [[topology]] and [[number theory]]. Initially a study of [[systems of polynomial equations]] in several variables, the subject of algebraic geometry starts where [[equation solving]] leaves off, and it becomes even more important to understand the intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations, than to find a specific solution; this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.\n<!-- this paragraph is misplaced in the lead. May be in the history section?\n\n[[Descartes]]'s idea of [[coordinates]] is central to algebraic geometry, because a '''point''' of an algebraic variety is a point whose coordinates are a solution of the equations defining the variety. However it has undergone a series of remarkable transformations beginning in the early 19th century. Before then, the coordinates were assumed to be [[tuple]]s of [[real number]]s, but this changed when first [[complex number]]s, and then elements of an arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|field]] became acceptable. [[Homogeneous coordinates]] of [[projective geometry]] offered an extension of the notion of coordinate system in a different direction, and enriched the scope of algebraic geometry. -->\n\nIn the 20th century, algebraic geometry split into several subareas.\n* The mainstream of algebraic geometry is devoted to the study of the complex points of the algebraic varieties and more generally to the points with coordinates in an [[algebraically closed field]].\n* The study of the points of an algebraic variety with coordinates in the field of the [[rational number]]s or in a [[number field]] became [[arithmetic geometry]] (or more classically Diophantine geometry), a subfield of [[algebraic number theory]].\n* The study of the real points of an algebraic variety is the subject of [[real algebraic geometry]].\n* A large part of [[singularity theory]] is devoted to the singularities of algebraic varieties.\n* With the rise of the computers, a [[#Computational algebraic geometry|computational algebraic geometry]] area has emerged, which lies at the intersection of algebraic geometry and [[computer algebra]]. It consists essentially in developing [[algorithm]]s and [[software]] for studying and finding the properties of explicitly given algebraic varieties.\n\nMuch of the development of the mainstream of algebraic geometry in the 20th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework, with increasing emphasis being placed on \"intrinsic\" properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space; this parallels developments in [[topology]], [[differential geometry|differential]] and [[complex geometry]]. One key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is [[Grothendieck]]'s [[scheme theory]] which allows one to use [[sheaf theory]] to study algebraic varieties in a way which is very similar to its use in the study of [[differential manifold|differential]] and [[complex manifold|analytic manifolds]]. This is obtained by extending the notion of point: In classical algebraic geometry, a point of an affine variety may be identified, through [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]], with a [[maximal ideal]] of the [[coordinate ring]], while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals of this ring. This means that a point of such a scheme may be either a usual point or a subvariety. This approach also enables a unification of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry, mainly concerned with complex points, and of algebraic number theory. [[Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|Wiles's proof]] of the longstanding conjecture called [[Fermat's last theorem]] is an example of the power of this approach.\n\n==Basic notions==\n{{Further|Algebraic variety}}\n\n=== Zeros of simultaneous polynomials ===\n[[File:Slanted circle.png|thumb|right|Sphere and slanted circle]]\nIn classical algebraic geometry, the main objects of interest are the vanishing sets of collections of [[polynomial]]s, meaning the set of all points that simultaneously satisfy one or more [[systems of polynomial equations|polynomial equations]]. For instance, the [[N-sphere|two-dimensional]] [[sphere]] of radius 1 in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>3</sup> could be defined as the set of all points (''x'',''y'',''z'') with\n\n:<math>x^2+y^2+z^2-1=0.\\,</math>\n\nA \"slanted\" circle in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> can be defined as the set of all points (''x'',''y'',''z'') which satisfy the two polynomial equations\n\n:<math>x^2+y^2+z^2-1=0,\\,</math>\n:<math>x+y+z=0.\\,</math>\n\n=== Affine varieties ===\n{{main|Affine variety}}\n\nFirst we start with a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k''. In classical algebraic geometry, this field was always the complex numbers '''C''', but many of the same results are true if we assume only that ''k'' is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. We consider the [[affine space]] of dimension ''n'' over ''k'', denoted '''A'''<sup>n</sup>(''k'') (or more simply '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup>, when ''k'' is clear from the context). When one fixes a coordinate system, one may identify '''A'''<sup>n</sup>(''k'') with ''k''<sup>''n''</sup>. The purpose of not working with ''k''<sup>''n''</sup> is to emphasize that one \"forgets\" the vector space structure that ''k''<sup>n</sup> carries.\n\nA function ''f'' : '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''A'''<sup>1</sup> is said to be ''polynomial'' (or ''regular'') if it can be written as a polynomial, that is, if there is a polynomial ''p'' in ''k''[''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>] such that ''f''(''M'') = ''p''(''t''<sub>1</sub>,...,''t''<sub>''n''</sub>) for every point ''M'' with coordinates (''t''<sub>1</sub>,...,''t''<sub>''n''</sub>) in '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup>. The property of a function to be polynomial (or regular) does not depend on the choice of a coordinate system in '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\nWhen a coordinate system is chosen, the regular functions on the affine ''n''-space may be identified with the ring of [[polynomial function]]s in ''n'' variables over ''k''. Therefore, the set of the regular functions on '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup> is a ring, which is denoted ''k''['''A'''<sup>''n''</sup>].\n\nWe say that a polynomial ''vanishes'' at a point if evaluating it at that point gives zero. Let ''S'' be a set of polynomials in ''k''['''A'''<sup>n</sup>]. The ''vanishing set of S'' (or ''vanishing locus'' or ''zero set'') is the set ''V''(''S'') of all points in '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup> where every polynomial in ''S'' vanishes. Symbolically,\n\n:<math>V(S) = \\{(t_1,\\dots,t_n)|\\forall p\\in S, p(t_1,\\dots,t_n) = 0\\}.\\,</math>\n\nA subset of '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup> which is ''V''(''S''), for some ''S'', is called an ''algebraic set''. The ''V'' stands for ''variety'' (a specific type of algebraic set to be defined below).\n\nGiven a subset ''U'' of '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup>, can one recover the set of polynomials which generate it? If ''U'' is ''any'' subset of '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup>, define ''I''(''U'') to be the set of all polynomials whose vanishing set contains ''U''. The ''I'' stands for [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]: if two polynomials ''f'' and ''g'' both vanish on ''U'', then ''f''+''g'' vanishes on ''U'', and if ''h'' is any polynomial, then ''hf'' vanishes on ''U'', so ''I''(''U'') is always an ideal of the polynomial ring ''k''['''A'''<sup>''n''</sup>].\n\nTwo natural questions to ask are:\n* Given a subset ''U'' of '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup>, when is ''U'' = ''V''(''I''(''U''))?\n* Given a set ''S'' of polynomials, when is ''S'' = ''I''(''V''(''S''))?\n\nThe answer to the first question is provided by introducing the [[Zariski topology]], a topology on '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup> whose closed sets are the algebraic sets, and which directly reflects the algebraic structure of ''k''['''A'''<sup>''n''</sup>]. Then ''U'' = ''V''(''I''(''U'')) if and only if ''U'' is an algebraic set or equivalently a Zariski-closed set. The answer to the second question is given by [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]]. In one of its forms, it says that ''I''(''V''(''S'')) is the [[radical of an ideal|radical]] of the ideal generated by ''S''. In more abstract language, there is a [[Galois connection]], giving rise to two [[closure operator]]s; they can be identified, and naturally play a basic role in the theory; the [[Galois connection#Examples|example]] is elaborated at Galois connection.\n\nFor various reasons we may not always want to work with the entire ideal corresponding to an algebraic set ''U''. [[Hilbert's basis theorem]] implies that ideals in ''k''['''A'''<sup>''n''</sup>] are always finitely generated.\n\nAn algebraic set is called ''[[irreducible component|irreducible]]'' if it cannot be written as the union of two smaller algebraic sets. Any algebraic set is a finite union of irreducible algebraic sets and this decomposition is unique. Thus its elements are called the ''irreducible components'' of the algebraic set. An irreducible algebraic set is also called a ''[[algebraic variety|variety]]''. It turns out that an algebraic set is a variety if and only if it may be defined as the vanishing set of a [[prime ideal]] of the polynomial ring.\n\nSome authors do not make a clear distinction between algebraic sets and varieties and use ''irreducible variety'' to make the distinction when needed.\n\n=== Regular functions ===\n{{main|Regular function}}\n\nJust as [[continuous function]]s are the natural maps on [[topological space]]s and [[smooth function]]s are the natural maps on [[differentiable manifold]]s, there is a natural class of functions on an algebraic set, called ''regular functions'' or ''polynomial functions''. A regular function on an algebraic set ''V'' contained in '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup> is the restriction to ''V'' of a regular function on '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup>. For an algebraic set defined on the field of the complex numbers, the regular functions are smooth and even [[analytic function|analytic]].\n\nIt may seem unnaturally restrictive to require that a regular function always extend to the ambient space, but it is very similar to the situation in a [[normal space|normal]] [[topological space]], where the [[Tietze extension theorem]] guarantees that a continuous function on a closed subset always extends to the ambient topological space.\n\nJust as with the regular functions on affine space, the regular functions on ''V'' form a ring, which we denote by ''k''[''V'']. This ring is called the ''[[coordinate ring]] of V''.\n\nSince regular functions on V come from regular functions on '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup>, there is a relationship between the coordinate rings. Specifically, if a regular function on ''V'' is the restriction of two functions ''f'' and ''g'' in ''k''['''A'''<sup>''n''</sup>], then ''f''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''g'' is a polynomial function which is null on ''V'' and thus belongs to ''I''(''V''). Thus ''k''[''V''] may be identified with ''k''['''A'''<sup>''n''</sup>]/''I''(''V'').\n\n=== Morphism of affine varieties ===\nUsing regular functions from an affine variety to '''A'''<sup>1</sup>, we can define [[morphism of algebraic varieties|regular map]]s from one affine variety to another. First we will define a regular map from a variety into affine space: Let ''V'' be a variety contained in '''A'''<sup>''n''</sup>. Choose ''m'' regular functions on ''V'', and call them ''f''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>''m''</sub>. We define a ''regular map'' ''f'' from ''V'' to '''A'''<sup>''m''</sup> by letting {{nowrap|1=''f'' = (''f''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>''m''</sub>)}}. In other words, each ''f''<sub>''i''</sub> determines one coordinate of the [[image (mathematics)|range]] of ''f''.\n\nIf ''V''\u2032 is a variety contained in '''A'''<sup>''m''</sup>, we say that ''f'' is a ''regular map'' from ''V'' to ''V''\u2032 if the range of ''f'' is contained in ''V''\u2032.\n\nThe definition of the regular maps apply also to algebraic sets.\nThe regular maps are also called ''morphisms'', as they make the collection of all affine algebraic sets into a [[category theory|category]], where the objects are the affine algebraic sets and the [[morphism]]s are the regular maps. The affine varieties is a subcategory of the category of the algebraic sets.\n\nGiven a regular map ''g'' from ''V'' to ''V''\u2032 and a regular function ''f'' of ''k''[''V''\u2032], then {{nowrap|''f'' \u2218 ''g'' \u2208 ''k''[''V'']}}. The map {{nowrap|''f'' \u2192 ''f'' \u2218 ''g''}} is a [[ring homomorphism]] from ''k''[''V''\u2032] to ''k''[''V'']. Conversely, every ring homomorphism from ''k''[''V''\u2032] to ''k''[''V''] defines a regular map from ''V'' to ''V''\u2032. This defines an [[equivalence of categories]] between the category of algebraic sets and the [[dual (category theory)|opposite category]] of the finitely generated [[reduced ring|reduced]] ''k''-algebras. This equivalence is one of the starting points of [[scheme theory]].\n\n=== Rational function and birational equivalence ===\n{{main|Rational mapping}}\nIn contrast to the preceding sections, this section concerns only varieties and not algebraic sets. On the other hand, the definitions extend naturally to projective varieties (next section), as an affine variety and its projective completion have the same field of functions.\n\nIf ''V'' is an affine variety, its coordinate ring is an [[integral domain]] and has thus a [[field of fractions]] which is denoted ''k''(''V'') and called the ''field of the rational functions'' on ''V'' or, shortly, the ''[[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]]'' of ''V''. Its elements are the restrictions to ''V'' of the [[rational function]]s over the affine space containing ''V''. The [[domain of a function|domain]] of a rational function ''f'' is not ''V'' but the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of the subvariety (a hypersurface) where the denominator of ''f'' vanishes.\n\nAs with regular maps, one may define a ''rational map'' from a variety ''V'' to a variety ''V''<nowiki>'</nowiki>. As with the regular maps, the rational maps from ''V'' to ''V''<nowiki>'</nowiki> may be identified to the [[ring homomorphism|field homomorphism]]s from ''k''(''V''<nowiki>'</nowiki>) to ''k''(''V'').\n\nTwo affine varieties are ''birationally equivalent'' if there are two rational functions between them which are [[function inverse|inverse]] one to the other in the regions where both are defined. Equivalently, they are birationally equivalent if their function fields are isomorphic.\n\nAn affine variety is a ''[[rational variety]]'' if it is birationally equivalent to an affine space. This means that the variety admits a rational parameterization. For example, the circle of equation <math>x^2+y^2-1=0</math> is a rational curve, as it has the parameterization\n:<math>x=\\frac{2\\,t}{1+t^2}</math>\n:<math>y=\\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}\\,,</math>\nwhich may also be viewed as a rational map from the line to the circle.\n\nThe problem of [[resolution of singularities]] is to know if every algebraic variety is birationally equivalent to a variety whose projective completion is nonsingular (see also [[smooth completion]]). It was solved in the affirmative in characteristic 0 by [[Heisuke Hironaka]] in 1964 and is yet unsolved in finite characteristic.\n\n=== Projective variety ===\n{{Main|Algebraic geometry of projective spaces}}\n\n[[File:Parabola & cubic curve in projective space.png|thumb|Parabola ({{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}, red) and cubic ({{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''<sup>3</sup>}}, blue) in projective space]]\nJust as the formulas for the roots of second, third, and fourth degree polynomials suggest extending real numbers to the more algebraically complete setting of the complex numbers, many properties of algebraic varieties suggest extending affine space to a more geometrically complete projective space. Whereas the complex numbers are obtained by adding the number ''i'', a root of the polynomial {{nowrap|''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1}}, projective space is obtained by adding in appropriate points \"at infinity\", points where parallel lines may meet.\n\nTo see how this might come about, consider the variety {{nowrap|''V''(''y'' &minus; ''x''<sup>2</sup>)}}. If we draw it, we get a [[parabola]]. As ''x'' goes to positive infinity, the slope of the line from the origin to the point (''x'',&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup>) also goes to positive infinity. As ''x'' goes to negative infinity, the slope of the same line goes to negative infinity.\n\nCompare this to the variety ''V''(''y''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''x''<sup>3</sup>). This is a [[cubic curve]]. As ''x'' goes to positive infinity, the slope of the line from the origin to the point (''x'',&nbsp;''x''<sup>3</sup>) goes to positive infinity just as before. But unlike before, as ''x'' goes to negative infinity, the slope of the same line goes to positive infinity as well; the exact opposite of the parabola. So the behavior \"at infinity\" of ''V''(''y''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''x''<sup>3</sup>) is different from the behavior \"at infinity\" of ''V''(''y''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup>).\n\nThe consideration of the ''projective completion'' of the two curves, which is their prolongation \"at infinity\" in the [[projective plane]], allows us to quantify this difference: the point at infinity of the parabola is a [[regular point of an algebraic variety|regular point]], whose tangent is the [[line at infinity]], while the point at infinity of the cubic curve is a [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]]. Also, both curves are rational, as they are parameterized by ''x'', and the [[Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic curves|Riemann-Roch theorem]] implies that the cubic curve must have a singularity, which must be at infinity, as all its points in the affine space are regular.\n\nThus many of the properties of algebraic varieties, including birational equivalence and all the topological properties, depend on the behavior \"at infinity\" and so it is natural to study the varieties in projective space. Furthermore, the introduction of projective techniques made many theorems in algebraic geometry simpler and sharper: For example, [[B\u00e9zout's theorem]] on the number of intersection points between two varieties can be stated in its sharpest form only in projective space. For these reasons, projective space plays a fundamental role in algebraic geometry.\n\nNowadays, the ''[[projective space]]'' '''P'''<sup>''n''</sup> of dimension ''n'' is usually defined as the set of the lines passing through a point, considered as the origin, in the affine space of dimension {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}, or equivalently to the set of the vector lines in a vector space of dimension {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}. When a coordinate system has been chosen in the space of dimension {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}, all the points of a line have the same set of coordinates, up to the multiplication by an element of ''k''. This defines the [[homogeneous coordinates]] of a point of '''P'''<sup>''n''</sup> as a sequence of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} elements of the base field ''k'', defined up to the multiplication by a nonzero element of ''k'' (the same for the whole sequence).\n\nA polynomial in {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} variables vanishes at all points of a line passing through the origin if and only if it is [[Homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]]. In this case, one says that the polynomial ''vanishes'' at the corresponding point of '''P'''<sup>''n''</sup>. This allows us to define a ''projective algebraic set'' in '''P'''<sup>''n''</sup> as the set {{nowrap|''V''(''f''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>''k''</sub>)}}, where a finite set of homogeneous polynomials {{nowrap|{''f''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>''k''</sub>} }} vanishes. Like for affine algebraic sets, there is a bijection between the projective algebraic sets and the reduced [[homogeneous ideal]]s which define them. The ''projective varieties'' are the projective algebraic sets whose defining ideal is prime. In other words, a projective variety is a projective algebraic set, whose [[homogeneous coordinate ring]] is an [[integral domain]], the ''projective coordinates ring'' being defined as the quotient of the graded ring or the polynomials in {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} variables by the homogeneous (reduced) ideal defining the variety. Every projective algebraic set may be uniquely decomposed into a finite union of projective varieties.\n\nThe only regular functions which may be defined properly on a projective variety are the constant functions. Thus this notion is not used in projective situations. On the other hand, the ''field of the rational functions'' or ''function field '' is a useful notion, which, similarly to the affine case, is defined as the set of the quotients of two homogeneous elements of the same degree in the homogeneous coordinate ring.\n\n==Real algebraic geometry==\n{{main|Real algebraic geometry}}\n\nReal algebraic geometry is the study of the real points of algebraic geometry.\n\nThe fact that the field of the real numbers is an [[ordered field]] cannot be ignored in such a study. For example, the curve of equation <math>x^2+y^2-a=0</math> is a circle if <math> a>0</math>, but does not have any real point if <math> a<0</math>. It follows that real algebraic geometry is not only the study of the real algebraic varieties, but has been generalized to the study of the ''semi-algebraic sets'', which are the solutions of systems of polynomial equations and polynomial inequalities. For example, a branch of the [[hyperbola]] of equation <math>x y-1 = 0</math> is not an algebraic variety, but is a semi-algebraic set defined by <math>x y-1=0</math> and <math>x>0</math> or by <math>x y-1=0</math> and <math>x+y>0</math>.\n\nOne of the challenging problems of real algebraic geometry is the unsolved [[Hilbert's sixteenth problem]]: Decide which respective positions are possible for the ovals of a nonsingular plane curve of degree 8.\n\n== Computational algebraic geometry ==\nOne may date the origin of computational algebraic geometry to meeting EUROSAM'79 (International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation) held at [[Marseille]], France in June 1979. At this meeting,\n* Dennis S. Arnon showed that [[George E. Collins]]'s [[Cylindrical algebraic decomposition]] (CAD) allows the computation of the topology of semi-algebraic sets,\n* [[Bruno Buchberger]] presented the [[Gr\u00f6bner basis|Gr\u00f6bner bases]] and his algorithm to compute them,\n* [[Daniel Lazard]] presented a new algorithm for solving systems of homogeneous polynomial equations with a [[computational complexity]] which is essentially polynomial in the expected number of solutions and thus simply exponential in the number of the unknowns. This algorithm is strongly related with [[Francis Sowerby Macaulay|Macaulay]]'s [[Resultant|multivariate resultant]].\n\nSince then, most results in this area are related to one or several of these items either by using or improving one of these algorithms, or by finding algorithms whose complexity is simply exponential in the number of the variables.\n\nA body of mathematical theory complementary to symbolic methods called [[numerical algebraic geometry]] has been developed over the last several decades.  The main computational method is [[homotopy continuation]].  This supports, for example, a model of [[floating point]] computation for solving problems of algebraic geometry.\n\n===Gr\u00f6bner basis===\n\n{{main|Gr\u00f6bner basis}}\n\nA [[Gr\u00f6bner basis]] is a system of [[Ideal (ring theory)#Ideal generated by a set|generators]] of a polynomial [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] whose computation allows the deduction of many properties of the affine algebraic variety defined by the ideal.\n\nGiven an ideal ''I'' defining an algebraic set ''V'':\n* ''V'' is empty (over an algebraically closed extension of the basis field), if and only if the Gr\u00f6bner basis for any [[monomial order]]ing is reduced to {1}.\n* By means of the [[Hilbert series]] one may compute the [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] and the [[degree of an algebraic variety|degree]] of ''V'' from any Gr\u00f6bner basis of ''I'' for a monomial ordering refining the total degree.\n* If the dimension of ''V'' is 0, one may compute the points (finite in number) of ''V'' from any Gr\u00f6bner basis of ''I'' (see [[Systems of polynomial equations]]).\n* A Gr\u00f6bner basis computation allows one to remove from ''V'' all irreducible components which are contained in a given hyper-surface.\n* A Gr\u00f6bner basis computation allows one to compute the Zariski closure of the image of ''V'' by the projection on the ''k'' first coordinates, and the subset of the image where the projection is not proper.\n* More generally Gr\u00f6bner basis computations allow one to compute the Zariski closure of the image and the [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s of a rational function of ''V'' into another affine variety.\n\nGr\u00f6bner basis computations do not allow one to compute directly the primary decomposition of ''I'' nor the prime ideals defining the irreducible components of ''V'', but most algorithms for this involve Gr\u00f6bner basis computation. The algorithms which are not based on Gr\u00f6bner bases use [[regular chain]]s but may need Gr\u00f6bner bases in some exceptional situations.\n\nGr\u00f6bner bases are deemed to be difficult to compute. In fact they may contain, in the worst case, polynomials whose degree is doubly exponential in the number of variables and a number of polynomials which is also doubly exponential. However, this is only a worst case complexity, and the complexity bound of Lazard's algorithm of 1979 may frequently apply. [[Faug\u00e8re F5 algorithm]] realizes this complexity, as it may be viewed as an improvement of Lazard's 1979 algorithm. It follows that the best implementations allow one to compute almost routinely with algebraic sets of degree more than 100. This means that, presently, the difficulty of computing a Gr\u00f6bner basis is strongly related to the intrinsic difficulty of the problem.\n\n===Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD)===\nCAD is an algorithm which was introduced in 1973 by G. Collins to implement with an acceptable complexity the [[Tarski\u2013Seidenberg theorem]] on [[quantifier elimination]] over the real numbers.\n\nThis theorem concerns the formulas of the [[first-order logic]] whose [[atomic formula]]s are polynomial equalities or inequalities between polynomials with real coefficients. These formulas are thus the formulas which may be constructed from the atomic formulas by the logical operators ''and'' (\u2227), ''or'' (\u2228), ''not'' (\u00ac), ''for all'' (\u2200) and ''exists'' (\u2203). Tarski's theorem asserts that, from such a formula, one may compute an equivalent formula without quantifier (\u2200, \u2203).\n\nThe complexity of CAD is doubly exponential in the number of variables. This means that CAD allows, in theory, to solve every problem of real algebraic geometry which may be expressed by such a formula, that is almost every problem concerning explicitly given varieties and semi-algebraic sets.\n\nWhile Gr\u00f6bner basis computation has doubly exponential complexity only in rare cases, CAD has almost always this high complexity. This implies that, unless if most polynomials appearing in the input are linear, it may not solve problems with more than four variables.\n\nSince 1973, most of the research on this subject is devoted either to improve CAD or to find alternative algorithms in special cases of general interest.\n\nAs an example of the state of art, there are efficient algorithms to find at least a point in every connected component of a semi-algebraic set, and thus to test if a semi-algebraic set is empty. On the other hand, CAD is yet, in practice, the best algorithm to count the number of connected components.\n\n=== Asymptotic complexity vs. practical efficiency ===\nThe basic general algorithms of computational geometry have a double exponential worst case [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]]. More precisely, if ''d'' is the maximal degree of the input polynomials and ''n'' the number of variables, their complexity is at most <math>d^{2^{c n}}</math> for some constant ''c'', and, for some inputs, the complexity is at least <math>d^{2^{c' n}}</math> for another constant ''c''\u2032.\n\nDuring the last 20 years of 20th century, various algorithms have been introduced to solve specific subproblems with a better complexity. Most of these algorithms have a complexity <math>d^{O(n^2)}</math>.\n\nAmong these algorithms which solve a sub problem of the problems solved by Gr\u00f6bner bases, one may cite ''testing if an affine variety is empty'' and ''solving nonhomogeneous polynomial systems which have a finite number of solutions.'' Such algorithms are rarely implemented because, on most entries [[Faug\u00e8re's F4 and F5 algorithms]] have a better practical efficiency and probably a similar or better complexity (''probably'' because the evaluation of the complexity of Gr\u00f6bner basis algorithms on a particular class of entries is a difficult task which has been done only in a few special cases).\n\nThe main algorithms of real algebraic geometry which solve a problem solved by CAD are related to the topology of semi-algebraic sets. One may cite ''counting the number of connected components'', ''testing if two points are in the same components'' or ''computing a [[Whitney stratification]] of a real algebraic set''. They have a complexity of\n<math>d^{O(n^2)}</math>, but the constant involved by ''O'' notation is so high that using them to solve any nontrivial problem effectively solved by CAD, is impossible even if one could use all the existing computing power in the world. Therefore, these algorithms have never been implemented and this is an active research area to search for algorithms with have together a good asymptotic complexity and a good practical efficiency.\n\n== Abstract modern viewpoint ==\nThe modern approaches to algebraic geometry redefine and effectively extend the range of basic objects in various levels of generality to schemes, [[formal scheme]]s, [[ind-scheme]]s, [[algebraic space]]s, [[algebraic stack]]s and so on. The need for this arises already from the useful ideas within theory of varieties, e.g. the formal functions of Zariski can be accommodated by introducing nilpotent elements in structure rings; considering spaces of loops and arcs, constructing quotients by group actions and developing formal grounds for natural intersection theory and deformation theory lead to some of the further extensions.\n\nMost remarkably, in late 1950s, algebraic varieties were subsumed into [[Alexander Grothendieck]]'s concept of a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]. Their local objects are affine schemes or prime spectra which are locally ringed spaces which form a category which is antiequivalent to the category of commutative unital rings, extending the duality between the category of affine algebraic varieties over a field ''k'', and the category of finitely generated reduced ''k''-algebras. The gluing is along Zariski topology; one can glue within the category of locally ringed spaces, but also, using the Yoneda embedding, within the more abstract category of presheaves of sets over the category of affine schemes. The Zariski topology in the set theoretic sense is then replaced by a [[Grothendieck topology]]. Grothendieck introduced Grothendieck topologies having in mind more exotic but geometrically finer and more sensitive examples than the crude Zariski topology, namely the [[\u00e9tale topology]], and the two flat Grothendieck topologies: fppf and fpqc; nowadays some other examples became prominent including [[Nisnevich topology]]. Sheaves can be furthermore generalized to stacks in the sense of Grothendieck, usually with some additional representability conditions leading to Artin stacks and, even finer, [[Deligne-Mumford stack]]s, both often called algebraic stacks.\n\nSometimes other algebraic sites replace the category of affine schemes. For example, [[Nikolai Durov]] has introduced commutative algebraic monads as a generalization of local objects in a generalized algebraic geometry. Versions of a [[tropical geometry]], of an [[absolute geometry]] over a field of one element and an algebraic analogue of [[Arakelov's geometry]] were realized in this setup.\n\nAnother formal generalization is possible to [[universal algebraic geometry]] in which every [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety of algebras]] has its own algebraic geometry. The term ''variety of algebras'' should not be confused with ''algebraic variety''.\n\nThe language of schemes, stacks and generalizations has proved to be a valuable way of dealing with geometric concepts and became cornerstones of modern algebraic geometry.\n\nAlgebraic stacks can be further generalized and for many practical questions like deformation theory and intersection theory, this is often the most natural approach. One can extend the [[Grothendieck site]] of affine schemes to a [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] site of [[derived affine scheme]]s, by replacing the commutative rings with an infinity category of [[differential graded commutative algebra]]s, or of simplicial commutative rings or a similar category with an appropriate variant of a Grothendieck topology. One can also replace presheaves of sets by presheaves of simplicial sets (or of infinity groupoids). Then, in presence of an appropriate homotopic machinery one can develop a notion of derived stack as such a presheaf on the infinity category of derived affine schemes, which is satisfying certain infinite categorical version of a sheaf axiom (and to be algebraic, inductively a sequence of representability conditions). [[Quillen model category|Quillen model categories]], Segal categories and [[quasicategory|quasicategories]] are some of the most often used tools to formalize this yielding the ''[[derived algebraic geometry]]'', introduced by the school of [[Carlos Simpson]], including Andre Hirschowitz, [[Bertrand To\u00ebn]], Gabrielle Vezzosi, Michel Vaqui\u00e9 and others; and developed further by [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Bertrand To\u00ebn]], and [[Gabrielle Vezzosi]]. Another (noncommutative) version of derived algebraic geometry, using A-infinity categories has been developed from early 1990s by [[Maxim Kontsevich]] and followers.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Before the 16th century===\nSome of the roots of algebraic geometry date back to the work of the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic Greeks]] from the 5th century BC. The [[Delian problem]], for instance, was to construct a length ''x'' so that the cube of side ''x'' contained the same volume as the rectangular box ''a''<sup>2</sup>''b'' for given sides ''a'' and ''b''. [[Menaechmus]] (circa 350 BC) considered the problem geometrically by intersecting the pair of plane conics ''ay''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup> and ''xy''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''ab''.<ref name=\"Dieudonn\u00e9\">{{Cite journal |last=Dieudonn\u00e9 |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Dieudonn\u00e9 |title=The historical development of algebraic geometry |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=79 |issue=8 |year=1972 |pages=827\u2013866 |doi=10.2307/2317664 |jstor=2317664 }}</ref> The later work, in the 3rd century BC, of [[Archimedes]] and [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]] studied more systematically problems on [[conic sections]],<ref>Kline, M.

The geometrical approach to construction problems, rather than the algebraic one, was favored by most 16th and 17th century mathematicians, notably [[Blaise Pascal]] who argued against the use of algebraic and analytical methods in geometry.<ref>Kline, M. (1972) ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (Volume 1). Oxford University Press. p. 279.</ref> The French mathematicians [[Franciscus Vieta]] and later [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] revolutionized the conventional way of thinking about construction problems through the introduction of [[coordinate geometry]]. They were interested primarily in the properties of ''algebraic curves'', such as those defined by [[Diophantine equations]] (in the case of Fermat), and the algebraic reformulation of the classical Greek works on conics and cubics (in the case of Descartes).\n\nDuring the same period, Blaise Pascal and [[G\u00e9rard Desargues]] approached geometry from a different perspective, developing the [[synthetic geometry|synthetic]] notions of [[projective geometry]]. Pascal and Desargues also studied curves, but from the purely geometrical point of view: the analog of the Greek ''ruler and compass construction''. Ultimately, the [[analytic geometry]] of Descartes and Fermat won out, for it supplied the 18th century mathematicians with concrete quantitative tools needed to study physical problems using the new calculus of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. However, by the end of the 18th century, most of the algebraic character of coordinate geometry was subsumed by the ''calculus of infinitesimals'' of [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] and [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]].\n\n===19th and early 20th century===\nIt took the simultaneous 19th century developments of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] and [[Abelian integral]]s in order to bring the old algebraic ideas back into the geometrical fold. The first of these new developments was seized up by [[Edmond Laguerre]] and [[Arthur Cayley]], who attempted to ascertain the generalized metric properties of projective space. Cayley introduced the idea of ''homogeneous polynomial forms'', and more specifically [[quadratic form]]s, on projective space. Subsequently, [[Felix Klein]] studied projective geometry (along with other types of geometry) from the viewpoint that the geometry on a space is encoded in a certain class of [[transformation group|transformations]] on the space. By the end of the 19th century, projective geometers were studying more general kinds of transformations on figures in projective space. Rather than the projective linear transformations which were normally regarded as giving the fundamental [[Kleinian geometry]] on projective space, they concerned themselves also with the higher degree [[birational transformation]]s. This weaker notion of congruence would later lead members of the 20th century [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]] to classify [[algebraic surface]]s up to [[birational isomorphism]].\n\nThe second early 19th century development, that of Abelian integrals, would lead [[Bernhard Riemann]] to the development of [[Riemann surface]]s.\n\nIn the same period began the algebraization of the algebraic geometry through [[commutative algebra]]. The prominent results in this direction are [[Hilbert's basis theorem]] and [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]], which are the basis of the connexion between algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, and [[Francis Sowerby Macaulay|Macaulay]]'s [[multivariate resultant]], which is the basis of [[elimination theory]]. Probably because of the size of the computation which is implied by multivariate resultants, elimination theory was forgotten during the middle of the 20th century until it was renewed by [[singularity theory]] and computational algebraic geometry.<ref>\nA witness of this oblivion is the fact that [[Van der Waerden]] removed the chapter on elimination theory from the third edition (and all the subsequent ones) of his treatise ''Moderne algebra'' (in German).</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[B. L. van der Waerden]], [[Oscar Zariski]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]] developed a foundation for algebraic geometry based on contemporary [[commutative algebra]], including [[valuation theory]] and the theory of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]]. One of the goals was to give a rigorous framework for proving the results of [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]]. In particular, this school used systematically the notion of [[generic point]] without any precise definition, which was first given by these authors during the 1930s.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Alexander Grothendieck]] recast the foundations making use of [[sheaf theory]]. Later, from about 1960, and largely led by Grothendieck, the idea of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] was worked out, in conjunction with a very refined apparatus of [[homological algebra|homological techniques]]. After a decade of rapid development the field stabilized in the 1970s, and new applications were made, both to [[number theory]] and to more classical geometric questions on algebraic varieties, [[singularity theory|singularities]] and [[moduli space|moduli]].\n\nAn important class of varieties, not easily understood directly from their defining equations, are the [[abelian variety|abelian varieties]], which are the projective varieties whose points form an abelian [[group (mathematics)|group]]. The prototypical examples are the [[elliptic curve]]s, which have a rich theory. They were instrumental in the proof of [[Fermat's last theorem]] and are also used in [[elliptic-curve cryptography]].\n\nIn parallel with the abstract trend of the algebraic geometry, which is concerned with general statements about varieties, methods for effective computation with concretely-given varieties have also been developed, which lead to the new area of computational algebraic geometry. One of the founding methods of this area is the theory of [[Gr\u00f6bner basis|Gr\u00f6bner bases]], introduced by [[Bruno Buchberger]] in 1965. Another founding method, more specially devoted to real algebraic geometry, is the [[cylindrical algebraic decomposition]], introduced by [[George E. Collins]] in 1973.\n\nSee also: [[derived algebraic geometry]].<!-- related to this, we really should mention more recent stuff like moduli of curves, connection to theoretical physics, etc.-->\n\n==Analytic geometry==\nAn '''[[analytic variety]]''' is defined locally as the set of common solutions of several equations involving [[analytic function]]s. It is analogous to the included concept of real or complex [[algebraic variety]]. Any [[complex manifold]] is an analytic variety. Since analytic varieties may have [[Mathematical singularity|singular points]], not all analytic varieties are manifolds.\n\nModern analytic geometry is essentially equivalent to real and complex algebraic geometry, as has been shown by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] in his paper ''[[GAGA]]'', the name of which is French for ''Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry''. Nevertheless, the two fields remain distinct, as the methods of proof are quite different and algebraic geometry includes also geometry in finite [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]].\n\n==Applications==\nAlgebraic geometry now finds applications in [[algebraic statistics|statistics]],<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Drton| first1 = Mathias| last2 = Sturmfels| first2 = Bernd| last3 = Sullivant| first3 = Seth| title = Lectures on Algebraic Statistics| url = https://books.google.com/?id=TytYUTy5V_IC| year = 2009| publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-3-7643-8904-8 }}</ref> [[control theory]],<ref>{{cite book| last = Falb| first = Peter| title = Methods of Algebraic Geometry in Control Theory Part II Multivariable Linear Systems and Projective Algebraic Geometry| url = https://books.google.com/?id=V--84aGmWh4C| year = 1990| publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-0-8176-4113-9 }}</ref><ref>[[Allen Tannenbaum]] (1982), Invariance and Systems Theory: Algebraic and Geometric Aspects, Lecture Notes in Mathematics, volume 845, Springer-Verlag, {{ISBN|9783540105657}}</ref> [[robotics]],<ref>{{cite book| last = Selig| first = J.M.| title = Geometric Fundamentals of Robotics| url = https://books.google.com/?id=9FljXoISr8AC| year = 2005| publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-0-387-20874-9 }}</ref> [[algebraic geometric code|error-correcting codes]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tsfasman |first1=Michael A. |last2=Vl\u0103du\u021b |first2=Serge G. |last3=Nogin |first3=Dmitry |title=Algebraic Geometric Codes Basic Notions |year=1990 |publisher=American Mathematical Soc. |isbn=978-0-8218-7520-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=o2sA-wzDBLkC}}</ref> [[computational phylogenetics|phylogenetics]]<ref>[[Barry A.

The 14-block grid plan was bisected by a broad north-south thoroughfare, Congress Avenue, running up from the river to Capital Square, where the new Texas State Capitol was to be constructed. A temporary one-story capitol was erected on the corner of Colorado and 8th Streets.

But Lamar's political enemy, [[Sam Houston]], used two Mexican army incursions to [[San Antonio]] as an excuse to move the government.

Upon threats of Mexican troops in Texas, Houston raided the Land Office to transfer all official documents to Houston for safe keeping in what was later known as the [[Archive War]], but the people of Austin would not allow this unaccompanied decision to be executed. The documents stayed, but the capital would temporarily move from Austin to Houston to [[Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas|Washington-on-the-Brazos]]. Without the governmental body, Austin's population declined to a low of only a few hundred people throughout the early 1840s. The voting by the fourth President of the Republic, [[Anson Jones]], and Congress, who reconvened in Austin in 1845, settled the issue to keep Austin the seat of government, as well as annex the Republic of Texas into the United States.\n\nIn 1860, 38% of Travis County residents were [[slavery in the United States|slaves]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Census Office, Department of the Interior |title= Map Showing the Distribution of the Slave Population of the Southern States of the United States |url= http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/opinion/FULLFRAMEmap.pdf |accessdate= December 13, 2010 |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |year= 1961}}</ref> In 1861, with the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], voters in Austin and other Central Texas communities voted against secession.<ref name=\"HOT: Bastrop\"/><ref name=\"HOT: Austin\"/> However, as the war progressed and fears of attack by [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces increased, Austin contributed hundreds of men to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces.

The city last went to a Republican candidate in 2000 when former Texas Governor George W. Bush successfully ran for President. In 2004, the Democrats rebounded strongly as John Kerry enjoyed a 14.0% margin over Bush, who once again won Texas.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/vote2004/countymap.htm |title=Latest vote, county by county |date=November 16, 2004 |work=USA Today}}</ref>\n\nCity residents have been supportive of alternative candidates; for example, [[Ralph Nader presidential campaign, 2000|Ralph Nader]] won 10.4% of the vote in Austin in 2000.\n\nIn 2003, the city adopted a resolution against the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] that reaffirmed constitutionally guaranteed rights.\n\nOf Austin's six state legislative districts, three are strongly Democratic and three are swing districts, two of which are held by Democrats and one of which is held by a Republican.\n\nTravis County was also the only county in Texas to reject Texas Constitutional Amendment Proposition 2 that effectively outlawed gay marriage and status equal or similar to it and did so by a wide margin (40% for, 60% against).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.co.travis.tx.us/county_clerk/election/20051108/enight_results.pdf |title = November 8, 2005 Joint Special Elections |publisher = [[Travis County, Texas]] |date = November 8, 2005 |format = PDF |accessdate = October 19, 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081028224014/http://www.co.travis.tx.us/county_clerk/election/20051108/enight_results.pdf| archivedate = October 28, 2008 | deadurl = no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=311361 |title=Austin \u2013 the Only Gay Place |last=Nichols |first=Lee |work=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |date=November 18, 2005 |accessdate=October 19, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlo/79R/billtext/HJ00006F.HTM |title = 79(R) HJR 6 \u2013 Enrolled version \u2013 Bill Text |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051125072148/http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlo/79R/billtext/HJ00006F.HTM |archivedate = November 25, 2005}}</ref>\n\nTwo of the candidates for president in the 2004 race called Austin home.

Before then, Austin had been entirely or almost entirely within the borders of a single congressional district\u2013what was then the 10th District\u2013for over a century. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan [[gerrymandering]], and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists; of note, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7\u20132 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin's districting, as U.S. Rep. [[Lloyd Doggett]]'s district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced [[minority influence]] in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Greg |last=Stohr |title=Republican Texas Redistricting Upheld by Top Court |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=ah1suoNgrH7g&refer=us |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Environmental movement====\nThe distinguishing political movement of Austin politics has been that of the environmental movement, which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement, then the more recent conservationist movement (as typified by the Hill Country Conservancy),<ref>{{Cite news|title=Conservancy shifts into high gear; Efforts steer land away from development |first=Sara |last=Zaragosa |newspaper=Austin Business Journal |date=August 28, 2009 |url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2009/08/31/story4.html }}</ref> and eventually the current ongoing debate about \"sense of place\" and preserving the Austin quality of life.

The highway is noted for having the entire route with a speed limit of at least {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The 41-mile section of the toll road between Mustang Ridge and Seguin has a posted speed limit of {{convert|85|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, the highest posted [[speed limits in the United States|speed limit in the United States]].\n\n[[State Highway 45 (Texas)|State Highway 45]] runs east-west from just south of Highway 183 in [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]] to 130 inside [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] (just east of Round Rock). A tolled extension of State Highway Loop 1 was also created. A new southeast leg of Highway 45 has recently been completed, running from US 183 and the south end of Segment 5 of TX-130 south of Austin due west to I-35 at the [[FM 1327]]/Creedmoor exit between the south end of Austin and [[Buda, Texas|Buda]]. The 183A Toll Road opened March 2007, providing a tolled alternative to U.S. 183 through the cities of [[Leander, Texas|Leander]] and [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]]. Currently under construction is a change to East US 290 from US 183 to the town of Manor.  Officially, the tollway will be dubbed Tollway 290 with the Manor Expressway as a nickname.\nDespite the overwhelming initial opposition to the toll road concept when it was first announced, all three toll roads have exceeded revenue projections.<ref name=\"Toll Road Revenue\">{{Cite news| first = Ben | last = Wear | title = Positive signs for financial future of Texas 130; | date = September 28, 2009 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&p_theme=aasb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_hidethis=no&p_field_label-0=Author&p_text_label-0=Ben%20Wear&p_field_label-1=title&p_bool_label-1=AND&s_dispstring=Toll%20revenue%20exceed%20AND%20byline(Ben%20Wear)%20AND%20date(09/01/2009%20to%2001/01/2010)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=09/01/2009%20to%2001/01/2010)&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(Toll%20revenue%20exceed)&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no | work = Austin American-Statesman | pages = B\u20131 | accessdate = August 7, 2010 | quote = Report on the tollway...has been making more money than projected.}}</ref>\n\n===Airports===\nAustin's airport is [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport]] (ABIA) ([[List of airports by IATA code: A#AU|IATA code]] '''AUS'''), located {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} southeast of the city.

Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that [[God]] is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The argument from morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in [[meta-ethics]].\n\nGerman philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] devised an argument from morality based on [[practical reason]]. Kant argued that the goal of humanity is to achieve perfect happiness and virtue (the [[summum bonum]]) and believed that an [[afterlife]] must exist in order for this to be possible, and that God must exist to provide this. In his book ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', [[C. S. Lewis]] argued that \"conscience reveals to us a moral law whose source cannot be found in the natural world, thus pointing to a supernatural Lawgiver.\"<ref name=\"Marty2010\">{{cite book|last=Marty|first=Elsa J.|title=A Dictionary of Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=78962vlrCDcC&pg=PA154|accessdate=2 December 2012|date=2010-08-19|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=9781441111975|page=154|quote=C.S.

S. Lewis revived the moral argument for the existence of God.  By moving from the fact of human quarrels and the moral law that these presuppose, to the reality of God as the moral Lawgiver whose law people break, Lewis set forth a foundation not only for the existence of God, but for the message that \"the Christians are talking about.... The tell you how the demands of this law, which you and I cannot meet, have been met on our behalf, how God himself becomes a man to save a man from the disapproval of God.\"\n}}</ref> Lewis argued that accepting the validity of human reason as a given must include accepting the validity of practical reason, which could not be valid without reference to a higher cosmic moral order which could not exist without a God to create and/or establish it. A related argument is from conscience; [[John Henry Newman]] argued that the [[conscience]] supports the claim that objective moral truths exist because it drives people to act morally even when it is not in their own interest. Newman argued that, because the conscience suggests the existence of objective moral truths, God must exist to give authority to these truths.\n\nContemporary defenders of the argument from mortality are [[Graham Ward (theologian)|Graham Ward]], [[Alister McGrath]] and [[William Lane Craig]].\n\n==General form==\nAll variations of the argument from morality begin with an observation about moral thought or experiences and conclude with the existence of God. Some of these arguments propose moral facts which they claim evident through human experience, arguing that God is the best explanation for these. Other versions describe some end which humans should strive to attain, only possible if God exists.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-arguments-god/ | title=Moral Arguments for the Existence of God | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=May 25, 2004 | accessdate=March 24, 2012 | author=Byrne, Peter}}</ref>\n\nMany arguments from morality are based on moral normativity, which suggests that objective moral truths exist and require God's existence to give them authority. Often, they consider that morality seems to be binding \u2013 obligations are seen to convey more than just a preference, but imply that the obligation will stand, regardless of other factors or interests. For morality to be binding, God must exist.<ref name=SEPNormative>{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-arguments-god/#ArgNorMor | title=Moral Arguments for the Existence of God | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=May 25, 2004 | accessdate=March 24, 2012 | author=Byrne, Peter}}</ref> In its most general form, the argument from moral normativity is:\n\n#A human experience of morality is observed.\n#God is the best or only explanation for this moral experience.\n#Therefore, God exists.<ref name=SEPNormative/>\n\nSome arguments from moral order suggest that morality is based on rationality and that this can only be the case if there is a moral order in the universe. The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of moral order in the universe, so God must exist. Alternative arguments from moral order have proposed that we have an obligation to attain the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists. A natural moral order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so God must exist.<ref name=SEPOrder>{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-arguments-god/#ArgMorOrd | title=Moral Arguments for the Existence of God | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=May 25, 2004 | accessdate=March 24, 2012 | author=Byrne, Peter}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n\n===Practical Reason===\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|Portrait of Immanuel Kant, who proposed an argument for the existence of God from morality]]\nIn his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] stated that no successful argument for God's existence arises from [[reason]] alone. In his ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'' he went on to argue that, despite the failure of these arguments, morality requires that God's existence is assumed, owing to practical reason.<ref name=OppyKant>Oppy 2006, pp. 372\u2013373</ref> Rather than proving the existence of God, Kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists.<ref>Guyer 2006, p. 234</ref> Kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about the ''[[summum bonum]]'': the two central aims of moral virtue and happiness, where happiness arises out of virtue. As [[ought implies can]], Kant argued, it must be possible for the ''summum bonum'' to be achieved.<ref name=SEPOrder/> He accepted that it is not within the power of humans to bring the ''summum bonum'' about, because we cannot ensure that virtue always leads to happiness, so there must be a higher power who has the power to create an [[afterlife]] where virtue can be rewarded by happiness.<ref name=OppyKant/>\n\nPhilosopher G. H. R. Parkinson notes a common objection to Kant's argument: that what ought to be done does not necessarily entail that it is possible. He also argues that alternative conceptions of morality exist which do not rely on the assumptions that Kant makes \u2013 he cites [[utilitarianism]] as an example which does not require the ''summum bonum''.<ref name=Parkinson>Parkinson 1988, p. 344</ref> Nicholas Everitt argues that much moral guidance is unattainable, such as the Biblical command to be Christ-like. He proposes that Kant's first two premises only [[logical consequence|entail]] that we must try to achieve the perfect good, not that it is actually attainable.<ref>Everitt 2003, p. 137</ref>\n\n===Argument from objective moral truths===\nBoth theists and non-theists have accepted that the existence of objective moral truths might entail the existence of God. [[Atheism|Atheist]] philosopher [[J. L. Mackie]] accepted that, if objective moral truths existed, they would warrant a supernatural explanation. Scottish philosopher [[W. R. Sorley]] presented the following argument:\n#If morality is objective and absolute, God must exist.\n#Morality is objective and absolute.\n#Therefore, God must exist.<ref name=Martin>Martin 1992, pp. 213\u2013214</ref>\n\nMany critics have challenged the second premise of this argument, by offering a biological and sociological account of the development of human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] and philosopher [[Michael Ruse]], proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of [[evolution|evolutionary pressures]], which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist [[David Hume]] made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless.<ref>Craig & Moreland 2011, p. 393</ref>\n\nBecause evolutionary naturalism proposes an [[empiricism|empirical]] account of morality, it does not require morality to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead to [[moral scepticism]] or [[antirealism]].<ref>Craig & Moreland 2011, pp. 393\u2013394</ref><ref>Boniolo & De Anna 2006, pp. 24\u201325</ref> [[C. S. Lewis]] argued that, if evolutionary naturalism is accepted, human morality cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right or wrong. Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent.<ref>McSwain & Ward 2010, pp. 110\u2013111</ref> As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form of [[divine command theory]] which equated God with goodness and treated goodness as an essential part of reality, thus asserting God's existence.<ref>McSwain & Ward 2010, p. 112</ref>\n\nJ.C.A. Gaskin challenges the first premise of the argument from moral objectivity, arguing that it must be shown why absolute and objective morality entails that morality is [[divine command theory|commanded by God]], rather than simply a human invention.  It could be the consent of humanity that gives it moral force, for example.<ref name=Parkinson/> American philosopher [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] argues that it is not [[logical truth|necessarily true]] that objective moral truths must entail the existence of God, suggesting that there could be alternative explanations: he argues that naturalism may be an acceptable explanation and, even if a supernatural explanation is necessary, it does not have to be God (polytheism is a viable alternative). Martin also argues that a non-objective account of ethics might be acceptable and challenges the view that a subjective account of morality would lead to moral anarchy.<ref name=Martin/>\n\n===Conscience===\n[[File:John Henry Newman by Sir John Everett Millais, 1st Bt.jpg|thumb|Portrait of John Henry Newman, who used the conscience as evidence of the existence of God]]\nRelated to the argument from morality is the argument from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop [[Joseph Butler]] and nineteenth-century cardinal [[John Henry Newman]].<ref name=\"Parkinson\"/> Newman proposed that the [[conscience]], as well as giving moral guidance, provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate explanation of the human experience of morality because people avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests. Newman proposed that, to explain the conscience, God must exist.<ref name=Martin214>Martin 1992, p. 214</ref>\n\nBritish philosopher [[John Locke]] argued that moral rules cannot be established from conscience because the differences in people's consciences would lead to contradictions. Locke also noted that the conscience is influenced by \"education, company, and customs of the country\", a criticism mounted by J. L. Mackie, who argued that the conscience should be seen as an \"introjection\" of other people into an agent's mind.<ref>Parkinson 1988, pp. 344\u2013345</ref> Michael Martin challenges the argument from conscience with a naturalistic account of conscience, arguing that naturalism provides an adequate explanation for the conscience without the need for God's existence. He uses the example of the internalization by humans of social pressures, which leads to the fear of going against these norms. Even if a supernatural cause is required, he argues, it could be something other than God; this would mean that the phenomenon of the conscience is no more supportive of [[monotheism]] than polytheism.<ref name=Martin214/>\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book | title=The Virtue of Faith and Other Essays in Philosophical Theology | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1987 | author=Adams, Robert | isbn=9780195041460}}\n*{{cite book | title=Evolutionary Ethics and Contemporary Biology | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2006 | last1=Boniolo | first1=Giovanni | last2=De Anna | first2=Gabriele | isbn=9780521856294}}\n*{{cite book | title=Essays on Moral Realism | publisher=Cornell University Press | year=1988 | at=Moral Arguments for Theistic Belief | author=Boyd, Richard | editor=Sayre-McCord, Geoffery | isbn=9780801495410}}\n*{{cite book | title=The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | year=2011 | last1=Craig | first1=William Lane | last2=Moreland | first2=J.P. | isbn=9781444350852}}\n*{{cite book | title=Non-Existence of God | publisher=Routledge | year=2003 | isbn=9780415301060| author=Everitt, Nicholas }}\n*{{cite book | title=Kant | publisher=Taylor & Francis | year=2006 | author=Guyer, Paul | isbn=9780415283359}}\n*{{cite book | title=The Moral Gap: Kantian Ethics, Human Limits, and God's Assistance | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1996 | author=Hare, John}}\n*{{cite book | title=Critique of Practical Reason | at=Part I, Bk.

It consisted of '''{{no wrap|Auschwitz I}}''' (the original concentration camp), '''Auschwitz II\u2013Birkenau''' (a combined concentration/extermination camp), {{no wrap|[[Monowitz concentration camp|Auschwitz III\u2013Monowitz]]}} (a labor camp to staff an [[IG Farben]] factory), and 45 satellite camps.\n\nAuschwitz I was first constructed to hold Polish political prisoners, who began to arrive in May 1940. The first extermination of prisoners took place in September 1941. Auschwitz II\u2013Birkenau went on to become a major site of the Nazis' [[Final Solution to the Jewish Question]] during the [[Holocaust]]. From early 1942 until late 1944, transport trains delivered [[Jews]] to the camp's [[gas chamber]]s from all over [[German-occupied Europe]], where they were killed en masse with the [[cyanide]]-based poison [[Zyklon B]], originally developed to be used as a [[pesticide]]. An estimated 1.3 million people were sent to the camp, of whom at least 1.1&nbsp;million died. Around 90 percent of those were Jews; approximately one in six Jews killed in the Holocaust died at the camp.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=298}}{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=383}} Others deported to Auschwitz included 150,000 [[Poles]], 23,000 [[Romani people|Romani]] and [[Sinti]], 15,000 [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet prisoners of war]], 400 [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and tens of thousands of others of diverse nationalities, including an unknown number of [[homosexual]]s.{{sfn|Hoare|2015}} Many of those not killed in the gas chambers died of starvation, forced labor, infectious diseases, individual executions, and [[Nazi human experimentation|medical experiments]].\n\nIn the course of the war, the camp was staffed by 7,000 members of the German ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS), approximately 12 percent of whom were later convicted of [[war crime]]s. Some, including camp commandant [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]], were executed. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] did not act on early reports of atrocities at the camp, and their failure to bomb the camp or its railways [[Auschwitz bombing debate|remains controversial]]. At least 802 prisoners attempted to escape from Auschwitz, 144 successfully, and on 7 October 1944 two ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' units, consisting of prisoners assigned to staff the gas chambers, launched a brief, unsuccessful uprising.\n\nAs [[Red Army|Soviet troops]] approached Auschwitz in January 1945, most of its population was sent west on a [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]]. The prisoners remaining at the camp were liberated on 27 January 1945, a day now commemorated as [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day]]. In the following decades, survivors such as [[Primo Levi]], [[Viktor Frankl]], and [[Elie Wiesel]] wrote memoirs of their experiences in Auschwitz, and the camp became a dominant symbol of the Holocaust. In 1947 Poland founded the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]] on the site of Auschwitz I and II, and in 1979 it was named a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n\nThe ideology of [[Nazism]] brought together elements of [[antisemitism]], [[racial hygiene]], and [[eugenics]], and combined them with [[pan-Germanism]] and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (living space) for the Germanic people.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=7}} Immediately after the [[Nazi seizure of power]] in Germany, acts of violence perpetrated against Jews became ubiquitous.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=33\u201335}} The [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed on 7 April 1933 excluded most Jews from the legal profession and the civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of the right to practise.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=38\u201339}} Harassment and economic pressure were used by the regime to encourage Jews to leave the country voluntarily.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=67\u201369}} Their businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of government contracts. [[German Jews]] were subjected to violent attacks and boycotts.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=41}}\n\nIn September 1935, the [[Nuremberg Laws]] were enacted. These laws prohibited marriages between Jews and people of Germanic extraction, extramarital relations between Jews and Germans, and the employment of German women under the age of 45 as domestic servants in Jewish households.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=346}} The Reich Citizenship Law stated that only those of Germanic or related blood were defined as citizens. Thus Jews and other minority groups were stripped of their German citizenship.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=544}} The laws were expanded on 26 November 1935 to include [[Romani people]] and [[Afro-Germans]]. This supplementary decree defined Gypsies as \"enemies of the race-based state\", the same category as Jews.{{sfn|Majer|2003|p=102}} By the start of [[World War II]] in 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Palestine, the United Kingdom, and other countries.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=127}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=555}}\n\n[[Nazi Germany]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939. German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered that the Polish leadership and intelligentsia be destroyed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=144}} Approximately 65,000 civilians, who were viewed as being inferior to the [[Aryan race|Aryan]] [[master race]], were killed by the end of 1939. In addition to leaders of Polish society, the Nazis killed Jews, prostitutes, Romani, and the mentally ill.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=15}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=430\u2013432}} SS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], then head of the [[Gestapo]], ordered on 21 September that [[Polish Jews]] should be rounded up and concentrated into cities with good rail links. Initially the intention was to deport the Jews to points further east, or possibly to [[Madagascar Plan|Madagascar]].{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=148\u2013149}} Two years later, in an attempt to obtain new territory, Hitler [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]],{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=7}} intending to deport or kill the Jews and [[Slavs]] living there.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=132}}\n\n===Auschwitz I===\n[[File:Auschwitz I Entrance.jpg|thumb|upright|Auschwitz I entrance<br>{{Coord|50.027606|19.203088|display=inline|region:PL-MA_type:landmark|name=Site of Auschwitz I entrance with ''Arbeit Macht Frei'' (work makes you free) gate}}]]\n[[File:Map of Auschwitz and environs, 1944.jpg|thumb|Map showing the location of the three main camps (1944). Prisoners: yellow; facilities: blue-gray]]\n\nAfter this part of Poland was [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|annexed by Nazi Germany]], [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]] (Auschwitz) was located administratively in [[Germany]], [[Province of Upper Silesia]], [[Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz]], Landkreis Bielitz. It was first suggested as a site for a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] for Polish prisoners by ''[[SS-Oberf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Arpad Wigand]], an aide to [[Higher SS and Police Leader]] for Silesia, [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski]]. Bach-Zelewski had been searching for a site to house prisoners in the Silesia region, as the local prisons were filled to capacity. [[Richard Gl\u00fccks]], head of the [[Concentration Camps Inspectorate]], sent former [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] commandant [[Walter Eisfeld]] to inspect the site, which already held sixteen dilapidated one-story buildings that had once served as an Austrian and later Polish Army barracks and a camp for transient workers.{{sfn|Dwork|van Pelt|2002|p=166}} ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]], head of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS), approved the site in April 1940, intending to use the facility to house political prisoners. SS-''[[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' (lieutenant colonel) [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]] oversaw the development of the camp and served as the first commandant. SS-''[[Obersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' (senior lieutenant) [[Josef Kramer]] was appointed H\u00f6ss's deputy. Auschwitz I, the original camp, became the administrative center for the whole complex.{{sfn|Gutman|1994|pp=10, 16}}{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nLocal residents were evicted, including 1,200 people who lived in shacks around the barracks. Around 300 Jewish residents of O\u015bwi\u0119cim were brought in to lay foundations. From 1940 to 1941, 17,000 Polish and Jewish residents of the western districts of O\u015bwi\u0119cim were expelled from places adjacent to the camp. The Germans also ordered [[Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany|expulsions of Poles]] from the villages of [[Broszkowice]], [[Babice, O\u015bwi\u0119cim County|Babice]], [[Brzezinka]], [[Rajsko, O\u015bwi\u0119cim County|Rajsko]], [[P\u0142awy]], [[Harm\u0119\u017ce]], [[B\u00f3r, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|B\u00f3r]], and Budy to the [[General Government]].{{sfn|Oswiecim 60th Anniversary}} German citizens were offered tax concessions and other benefits if they would relocate to the area.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=63}} By October 1943, more than 6,000 Reich Germans had arrived.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=72}} The Nazis planned to build a model modern residential area for incoming Germans, including schools, playing fields, and other amenities. Some of the plans went forward, including the construction of several hundred apartments, but many were never fully implemented.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=67, 69}} Basic amenities such as water and sewage disposal were inadequate, and water-borne illnesses were commonplace.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=73}}\n\nThe first prisoners (30 German criminal prisoners from the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]) arrived in May 1940, intended to act as functionaries within the prison system. The [[first mass transport to Auschwitz concentration camp]], which included Catholic prisoners, suspected members of the resistance, and 20 Jews, arrived from the prison in [[Tarn\u00f3w]], Poland, on 14 June 1940. They were interned in the former building of the Polish Tobacco Monopoly, adjacent to the site, until the camp was ready.{{sfn|Gutman|1994|pp=10, 16}}{{sfn|Nagorski|1995}}\n\nThe inmate population grew quickly as the camp absorbed Poland's intelligentsia and dissidents, including the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish underground resistance]]. By March 1941, 10,900 were imprisoned there, most of them Poles.{{sfn|Gutman|1994|pp=10, 16}} By the end of 1940, the SS had confiscated land in the surrounding area to create a {{convert|40|km2|adj=on}} \"zone of interest\" surrounded by a double ring of electrified barbed wire fences and watchtowers.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=27}} Like other Nazi concentration camps, the gates to Auschwitz I displayed the motto ''[[Arbeit macht frei]]'' (\"Work brings freedom\").{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=9}}\n\n===Auschwitz II-Birkenau{{anchor|Birkenau}}===<!-- This section is linked from [[Treblinka extermination camp]] -->\n[[File:Birkenau25August1944.jpg|thumb|American surveillance photo of Birkenau (1944). South is at the top in this photo.]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R69919, KZ Auschwitz, Brillen.jpg|thumb|Eyeglasses of victims]]\n\nThe victories of [[Operation Barbarossa]] in the summer and fall of 1941 against Hitler's new enemy, the Soviet Union, led to dramatic changes in Nazi anti-Jewish ideology and the profile of prisoners brought to Auschwitz.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=260\u2013262, 264\u2013265, 270}} Construction on Auschwitz II-Birkenau began in October 1941 to ease congestion at the main camp. ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]], head of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS), intended the camp to house 50,000 [[prisoners of war]], who would be interned as forced laborers. Plans called for the expansion of the camp first to house 150,000 and eventually as many as 200,000 inmates.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=89}} An initial contingent of 10,000 Soviet prisoners of war arrived at Auschwitz I in October 1941, but by March 1942 only 945 were still alive, and these were transferred to Birkenau, where most of them died from disease or starvation by May.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=94}} By this time Hitler had decided to annihilate the Jewish people, so Birkenau was changed to a labor camp\u2013[[extermination camp]].{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=94}}{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=282\u2013283}} The [[Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum]] estimates that 1.3 million people, 1.1 million of them Jewish, were sent to the camp during its existence.<ref>{{cite web | title = Number of deportees by ethnicity | publisher = [[Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum]] | url = http://auschwitz.org/en/history/the-number-of-victims/number-of-deportees-by-ethnicity | access-date = 16 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe chief of construction of Auschwitz II-Birkenau was [[Karl Bischoff]]. Unlike his predecessor, he was a competent and dynamic bureaucrat who, in spite of the ongoing war, carried out the construction deemed necessary. The Birkenau camp, the four [[crematorium|crematoria]], a new reception building, and hundreds of other buildings were planned and constructed. Bischoff's plans called for each barrack to have an occupancy of 550 prisoners (one-third of the space allotted in other Nazi concentration camps). He later changed this to 744 prisoners per barrack. The SS designed the barracks not so much to house people as to destroy them.{{sfn|BBC Television|2005}}\n\nThe first [[gas chamber]] at Birkenau was the \"red house\" (called Bunker 1 by SS staff), a brick cottage converted into a gassing facility by tearing out the inside and bricking up the windows. It was operational by March 1942.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=96}} A second brick cottage, the \"white house\" or Bunker 2, was converted some weeks later.{{sfn|Rees|2005|pp=97, 101}}{{sfn|Piper|1994c|p=161}} These structures were in use for mass killings until early 1943.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=98}} Himmler visited the camp in person on 17 and 18 July 1942. He was given a demonstration of a mass killing using the gas chamber in Bunker 2 and toured the building site of the new [[IG Farben]] plant being constructed at the nearby town of [[Monowitz]].{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=106}}\n\nIn early 1943, the Nazis decided to greatly increase the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, which had been designed as a mortuary with morgues in the basement and ground-level incinerators, was converted into a killing factory by installing gas-tight doors, vents for the [[Zyklon B]] (a highly lethal [[cyanide]]-based [[poison]]) to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas thereafter.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|pp=100\u2013101}} It went into operation in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most of the victims were killed using these four structures.{{sfn|Rees|2005|pp=168\u2013169}}\n\n===={{anchor|Gypsy camp}}{{anchor|Theresienstadt family camp}}{{anchor|Family camp}}{{anchor|Family camps}}Family camps====\n{{main|Theresienstadt family camp|Gypsy camp (Auschwitz)}}\nA separate camp for Roma known as the ''Zigeunerfamilienlager'' (Gypsy Family Camp) was set up at Auschwitz II-Birkenau; unlike other arrivals, the Romani prisoners were not subject to selection and families were allowed to remain together. The first transport of German Gypsies arrived on 26 February 1943, and was housed in Section B-IIe of Auschwitz II. Approximately 23,000 Gypsies had been brought to Auschwitz by 1944, 20,000 of whom died there.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=248}} One transport of 1,700 Polish Sinti and Roma were killed in the gas chambers upon arrival, as they were suspected to be ill with [[spotted fever]].{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=110}} Gypsy prisoners were used primarily for construction work.{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=110}} Thousands died of typhus and [[Noma (disease)|noma]] due to overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, and malnutrition.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=248}} Between 1,400{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=251}} and 3,000{{sfn|Steinbacher|2005|p=111}} prisoners were transferred to other concentration camps. On 2 August 1944, the SS cleared the Gypsy camp; the surviving population (estimated at 2,897 to 5,600) was then killed en masse in the gas chambers.{{sfn|Rees|2005|p=251}}{{sfn|Epstein|2015|p=165}} \n\nThe [[Theresienstadt family camp]], which existed between September 1943 and July 1944, served a different purpose. The SS deported 17,500 Jews from [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] to Auschwitz, but allowed them to remain alive temporarily and send letters to friends and relatives to cast doubt on reports of the [[Final Solution]], both at Theresienstadt and in the wider world. On 8 March 1944, the remaining Jews from the first two transports in September were murdered; this was the largest massacre of Czechoslovak citizens in history.

Historian [[Timothy D.

Never has some form of reaction, a corrective of the total tyranny, been lacking, not even in the Third Reich or Stalin's Soviet Union: in both cases, public opinion, the magistrature, the foreign press, the churches, the feeling for justice and humanity that ten or twenty years of tyranny were not enough to eradicate, have to a greater or lesser extent acted as a brake. Only in the ''Lager'' [camp] was the restraint from below non-existent, and the power of these small [[satrap]]s absolute.{{sfn|Gutman|1994|p=5}} }}\n\nElie Wiesel wrote about his own imprisonment at Auschwitz in ''[[Night (book)|Night]]'' (1960) and other works, and became a prominent spokesman against ethnic violence.

Historically, archery has been used for hunting and combat. In modern times, it is mainly a competitive sport and recreational activity. A person who participates in archery is typically called an '''archer''' or a ''bowman'', and a person who is fond of or an expert at archery is sometimes called a '''toxophilite'''.<ref>The noun \"toxophilite\", meaning \"a lover or devotee of archery, an archer\" derives from ''[[Toxophilus]]'' by [[Roger Ascham]] \u2014\"imaginary proper name invented by Ascham, and hence title of his book (1545), intended to mean 'lover of the bow'.\" \"toxophilite, n.\" ''Oxford English Dictionary''.

The oldest signs of its use in Europe come from the {{Interlanguage link|Stellmoor|de}} in the {{Interlanguage link|Ahrensburg valley|de|3=Stellmoor\u2013Ahrensburger Tunneltal}} north of [[Hamburg]], Germany and dates from the late [[Paleolithic]], about 10,000\u20139000 BC. The arrows were made of [[pine]] and consisted of a mainshaft and a {{convert|15|\u2013|20|cm|in|abbr=off}} long fore shaft with a [[flint]] point. There are no definite earlier bows; previous pointed shafts are known, but may have been launched by [[spear-thrower]]s rather than bows. The [[Holmegaard bow|oldest bows]] known so far comes from the [[Holmegaard|Holmeg\u00e5rd]] swamp in Denmark. Bows eventually replaced the [[spear-thrower]] as the predominant means for launching shafted [[projectiles]], on every continent except [[Australasia]], though spear-throwers persisted alongside the bow in parts of the Americas, notably Mexico and among the [[Inuit]].\n\nBows and arrows have been present in [[Egypt]]ian & neighboring [[Nubia]]n culture since its respective [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] & [[Pre-Kerma]] origins. In the [[Levant]], artifacts that could be arrow-shaft straighteners are known from the [[Natufian culture]], (c. 10,800\u20138,300 BC) onwards. The [[Khiamian]] and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPN A]] shouldered Khiam-points may well be arrowheads.\n\n[[Classical antiquity|Classical]] civilizations, notably the [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[History of Armenia|Armenians]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Parthia]]ns, [[History of India|Indians]], [[History of Korea|Koreans]], [[History of China|Chinese]], and [[History of Japan|Japanese]] fielded large numbers of archers in their armies. [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]] were the first to use [[composite bows]] in war according to the victory stele of [[Naram-Sin of Akkad]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zutterman|first=C.|date=2003|title=The bow in the Ancient Near East.

Lightly armoured, but highly mobile archers were excellently suited to warfare in the Central Asian steppes, and they formed a large part of armies that repeatedly conquered large areas of Eurasia.

In England and Wales, for example, the government tried to enforce practice with the longbow until the end of the 16th century.<ref>Steven Gunn, ''Archery Practice in Early Tudor England'', Past and Present, (2010) Vol. 209 (1): 53\u201381. {{doi|10.1093/pastj/gtq029}}</ref> This was because it was recognised that the bow had been instrumental to military success during the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Despite the high social status, ongoing utility, and widespread pleasure of archery in Armenia, China, Egypt, England and Wales, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|America]], India, Japan, Korea, Turkey and elsewhere, almost every culture that gained access to even early firearms used them widely, to the neglect of archery. Early firearms were inferior in rate-of-fire, and were very sensitive to wet weather. However, they had longer effective range<ref name=\"koreantrad\" /> and were tactically superior in the common situation of soldiers shooting at each other from behind obstructions. They also required significantly less training to use properly, in particular penetrating steel armour without any need to develop special musculature. Armies equipped with guns could thus provide superior firepower, and highly trained archers became obsolete on the battlefield. However, the bow and arrow is still an effective weapon, and archers have seen action in the 21st century.<ref>Bows and arrows: deadly weapons of rural Kenya's war.

Sir [[Ashton Lever]], an antiquarian and collector, formed the Toxophilite Society in London in 1781, with the patronage of [[George III|George, the Prince of Wales]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Toxophilite Society|url=http://www.longbow-archers.com/royaltoxophilitesociety.html|website=Longbow Archers|access-date=24 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nArchery societies were set up across the country, each with its own strict entry criteria and outlandish costumes. Recreational archery soon became extravagant social and ceremonial events for the nobility, complete with flags, music and [[21 gun salute]]s for the competitors. The clubs were \"the drawing rooms of the great country houses placed outside\" and thus came to play an important role in the social networks of the local upper class. As well as its emphasis on display and status, the sport was notable for its popularity with females. Young women could not only compete in the contests but retain and show off their sexuality while doing so. Thus, archery came to act as a forum for introductions, flirtation and romance.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnes |first=Martin |url=https://swansea.academia.edu/MartinJohnes/Papers/127610/Archery--Romance-and-Elite-Culture-in-England-and-Wales--c--1780-1840 |title=Archery\u2014Romance-and-Elite-Culture-in-England-and-Wales\u2014c-1780-1840 Martin Johnes.

General meetings were held from 1789, in which local lodges convened together to standardise the rules and ceremonies. Archery was also co-opted as a distinctively British tradition, dating back to the lore of [[Robin Hood]] and it served as a patriotic form of entertainment at a time of political tension in [[Europe]]. The societies were also elitist, and the new [[middle class]] [[bourgeoisie]] were excluded from the clubs due to their lack of social status.\n\nAfter the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the sport became increasingly popular among all classes, and it was framed as a nostalgic reimagining of the [[Industrialisation|preindustrial]] rural Britain. Particularly influential was Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s 1819 novel, ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' that depicted the heroic character Lockseley winning an archery tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/archers.html |title=The Royal Company of Archers |access-date=17 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125050714/http://www.martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/archers.html |archivedate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===A modern sport===\nThe 1840s saw the second attempts at turning the recreation into a modern sport. The first [[Grand National Archery Society]] meeting was held in [[York]] in 1844 and over the next decade the extravagant and festive practices of the past were gradually whittled away and the rules were standardised as the 'York Round' - a series of shoots at 60, 80, and 100 yards. [[Horace A. Ford]] helped to improve archery standards and pioneered new archery techniques. He won the Grand National 11 times in a row and published a highly influential guide to the sport in 1856.\n\n[[File:Saxton Pope and grizzly.jpg|thumb|left|Picture of [[Saxton Pope]] taken while grizzly hunting at Yellowstone]]\nTowards the end of the 19th century, the sport experienced declining participation as alternative sports such as [[croquet]] and [[tennis]] became more popular among the middle class. By 1889, just 50 archery clubs were left in Britain, but it was still included as a sport at the [[1900 Paris Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Archery results - Pari 1900|url=http://www.olympic.org/content/results-and-medalists/gamesandsportsummary/?sport=31766&games=1900%2f1&event=122225|website=olympic.org|access-date=11 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, primitive archery was revived in the early 20th century.

Archery features in the story of Oguz Khagan.\n\nIn [[West Africa]]n [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] belief, [[Ochosi|Osoosi]] is one of several deities of the hunt who are identified with bow and arrow iconography and other insignia associated with archery.\n\n==Equipment==\n===Types of bow===\n{{Main|Bow and arrow}}\n[[File:Pacific Yew Selfbow.jpg|thumb|Clay Hayes drawing a Pacific yew selfbow using the split finger method. Selfbows are made from a single piece of wood.]]\nWhile there is great variety in the construction details of bows (both historic and modern), all bows consist of a string attached to elastic limbs that store mechanical energy imparted by the user drawing the string. Bows may be broadly split into two categories: those drawn by pulling the string directly and those that use a mechanism to pull the string.\n\nDirectly drawn bows may be further divided based upon differences in the method of limb construction, notable examples being [[self bow]]s, [[laminated bow]]s and [[composite bow]]s. Bows can also be classified by the [[shape|bow shape]] of the limbs when unstrung; in contrast to traditional European straight bows, a [[Recurve bow#Recurve bow|recurve bow]] and some types of longbow have tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is unstrung. The cross-section of the limb also varies; the classic [[longbow]] is a tall bow with narrow limbs that are D-shaped in cross section, and the [[flatbow]] has flat wide limbs that are approximately rectangular in cross-section. The classic D-shape comes from the use of the wood of the yew tree. The sap-wood is best suited to the tension on the back of the bow, and the heart-wood to the compression on the belly. Hence, a cross-section of a yew longbow shows the narrow, light-coloured sap-wood on the 'straight' part (riser) of the D, and the red/orange heartwood forms the curved part of the D, to balance the mechanical tension/compression stress. [[Cable-backed bow]]s use cords as the back of the bow; the draw weight of the bow can be adjusted by changing the tension of the cable. They were widespread among [[Inuit]] who lacked easy access to good bow wood. One variety of cable-backed bow is the Penobscot bow or [[Wabenaki]] bow, invented by Frank Loring (Chief Big Thunder) about 1900.<ref>The Penobscot War Bow. Gordon M Day. Contributions to Canadian Ethnology 1975. Canadian Ethnology Service Paper no. 31. {{ISSN|0316-1854}}. Ottawa 1975.</ref> It consists of a small bow attached by cables on the back of a larger main bow.\n\nIn different cultures, the arrows are released from either the left or right side of the bow, and this affects the hand grip and position of the bow. In [[Arab archery]], [[Turkish archery]] and [[Ky\u016bd\u014d]], the arrows are released from the right hand side of the bow, and this affects construction of the bow. In western archery, the arrow is usually released from the left hand side of the bow for a right-handed archer.\n\n[[File:recurve bow.jpg|thumb|right|Modern (takedown) recurve bow]]\n\n[[Compound bow]]s are designed to reduce the force required to hold the string at full draw, hence allowing the archer more time to aim with less muscular stress. Most compound designs use cams or elliptical wheels on the ends of the limbs to achieve this. A typical let-off is anywhere from 65% to 80%. For example, a 60-pound bow with 80% let-off only requires 12 pounds of force to hold at full draw. Up to 99% let-off is possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conceptarchery.com/ |title=99% Let Off Bows |publisher=Concept Archery |date= |access-date=26 March 2013}}</ref> The compound bow was invented by [[Holless Wilbur Allen]] in the 1960s (a US patent was filed in 1966 and granted in 1969) and it has become the most widely used type of bow for all forms of archery in North America.\n\nMechanically drawn bows typically have a stock or other mounting, such as the [[crossbow]]. Crossbows typically have shorter draw lengths compared to compound bows. Because of this, heavier draw weights are required to achieve the same energy transfer to the arrow. These mechanically drawn bows also have devices to hold the tension when the bow is fully drawn. They are not limited by the strength of a single archer and larger varieties have been used as [[siege engine]]s.\n\n===Types of arrows and fletchings===\n{{Main|Arrow}}\nThe most common form of arrow consists of a [[Arrow straightener|shaft]], with an [[arrowhead]] at the front end, and [[fletching]]s and a [[Arrow#Nocks|nock]] at the other end. Arrows across time and history have normally been carried in a container known as a [[quiver]], which can take many different forms. Shafts of arrows are typically composed of solid [[wood]], [[bamboo]], [[glass-reinforced plastic|fiberglass]], [[aluminium alloy]], [[carbon fiber]], or [[composite material]]s. Wooden arrows are prone to warping. Fiberglass arrows are brittle, but can be produced to uniform specifications easily. Aluminium shafts were a very popular high-performance choice in the latter half of the 20th century, due to their straightness, lighter weight, and subsequently higher speed and flatter trajectories. Carbon fiber arrows became popular in the 1990s because they are very light, flying even faster and flatter than aluminium arrows. Today, the most popular arrows at tournaments and Olympic events are made of composite materials, in particular the X10 and A/C/E, made by [[Easton (company)|Easton]],\n\nThe arrowhead is the primary functional component of the arrow. Some arrows may simply use a sharpened tip of the solid shaft, but separate arrowheads are far more common, usually made from metal, stone, or other hard materials. The most commonly used forms are target points, field points, and broadheads, although there are also other types, such as bodkin, judo, and blunt heads.\n\n[[File:Spliced feather 0002.jpg|thumb|Shield cut straight fletching \u2013 here the hen [[feather]]s are barred red]]\n[[Fletching]] is traditionally made from bird feathers, but solid plastic vanes and thin sheet-like spin vanes are used. They are attached near the nock (rear) end of the arrow with thin double sided tape, glue, or, traditionally, sinew. The most common configuration in all cultures is three fletches, though as many as six have been used. Two makes the arrow unstable in flight. When the arrow is ''three-fletched'', the fletches are equally spaced around the shaft, with one placed such that it is perpendicular to the bow when nocked on the string, though variations are seen with modern equipment, especially when using the modern spin vanes. This fletch is called the \"index fletch\" or \"cock feather\" (also known as \"the odd vane out\" or \"the nocking vane\"), and the others are sometimes called the \"hen feathers\". Commonly, the cock feather is of a different color. However, if archers are using fletching made of feather or similar material, they may use same color vanes, as different dyes can give varying stiffness to vanes, resulting in less precision. When an arrow is ''four-fletched'', two opposing fletches are often cock feathers, and occasionally the fletches are not evenly spaced.\n\nThe fletching may be either ''parabolic'' cut (short feathers in a smooth parabolic curve) or ''shield'' cut (generally shaped like half of a narrow shield), and is often attached at an angle, known as ''helical'' fletching, to introduce a stabilizing spin to the arrow while in flight. Whether helicial or straight fletched, when natural fletching (bird feathers) is used it is critical that all feathers come from the same side of the bird. Oversized fletchings can be used to accentuate drag and thus limit the range of the arrow significantly; these arrows are called ''[[flu-flu arrow|flu-flus]]''. Misplacement of fletchings can change the arrow's flight path dramatically.\n\n===Bowstring===\n{{Main|Bowstring}}\n[[Dacron]] and other modern materials offer high strength for their weight and are used on most modern bows. Linen and other traditional materials are still used on traditional bows. Several modern methods of making a bowstring exist, such as the 'endless loop' and 'Flemish twist'. Almost any fiber can be made into a bowstring. The author of ''Arab Archery'' suggests the hide of a young, emaciated camel.<ref name=\"arabarchery\">{{citation\n |title = Arab Archery: An Arabic manuscript of about AD 1500, \"A book on the excellence of the bow & arrow\" and the description thereof\n |author1 = Nabih Amin Faris\n |author2 = Robert Potter Elmer\n |publisher = Princeton University Press\n |year = 1945\n |url = http://www.sacred-archery.com/arab%20archery%20anno%20domini%201500.pdf\n |postscript = <!-- none -->\n |deadurl = yes\n |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090225181419/http://www.sacred-archery.com/arab%20archery%20anno%20domini%201500.pdf\n |archivedate = 25 February 2009\n |df = dmy-all\n}}</ref> [[Nj\u00e1l's saga]] describes the refusal of a wife, Hallger\u00f0ur, to cut her hair to make an emergency bowstring for her husband, [[Gunnar H\u00e1mundarson]], who is then killed.\n\n===Protective equipment===\n{{Main|Bracer|Finger tab|Thumb ring}}\n[[File:Finger-tab hg.jpg|A right-hand finger tab to protect the hand while the string is drawn.|thumb]]\nMost archers wear a [[bracer (archery)|bracer]] (also known as an arm-guard) to protect the inside of the bow arm from being hit by the string and prevent clothing from catching the bowstring.

''Target Archery'' (1952), pp. 345\u2013349</ref>\n\n===Release aids===\n{{Main|Release aid}}\n[[File:Release-aid.jpg|thumb|right|Release aid]]\nA release aid is a mechanical device designed to give a crisp and precise loose of arrows from a compound bow. In the most commonly used, the string is released by a finger-operated trigger mechanism, held in the archer's hand or attached to their wrist. In another type, known as a back-tension release, the string is automatically released when drawn to a pre-determined tension.\n\n===Stabilizers===\n{{Main|Stabiliser (archery)}}\nStabilizers are mounted at various points on the bow. Common with competitive archery equipment are special brackets that allow multiple stabilizers to be mounted at various angles to fine tune the bow's balance.\n\nStabilizers aid in aiming by improving the balance of the bow. Sights, quivers, rests, and design of the riser (the central, non-bending part of the bow) make one side of the bow heavier. One purpose of stabilizers are to offset these forces. A reflex riser design will cause the top limb to lean towards the shooter. In this case a heavier front stabilizer is desired to offset this action. A deflex riser design has the opposite effect and a lighter front stabilizer may be used.\n\nStabilizers can reduce noise and vibration. These energies are absorbed by viscoelastic polymers, gels, powders, and other materials used to build stabilizers.\n\nStabilizers improve the forgiveness and accuracy by increasing the moment of inertia of the bow to resist movement during the shooting process. Lightweight carbon stabilizers with weighted ends are desirable because they improve the moment of interia while minimizing the weight added.\n\n==Shooting technique and form==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}\n[[File:Mediaeval archery reenactment.jpg|thumb|left|[[Historical reenactment]] of medieval archery]]\n[[File:Thrill_of_the_hunt.jpg|thumb|Chief Master Sgt. Kevin Peterson demonstrates safe archery techniques while aiming an arrow at a target on the 28th Force Support Squadron trap and skeet range at [[Ellsworth Air Force Base]], S.D., October 11, 2012.]]\nThe standard convention on teaching archery is to hold the bow depending upon eye dominance.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is eye dominance? Why does it matter for my first bow?|url=http://esdf.org/discover-archery/equipment/what-is-eye-dominance-why-does-it-matter-for-my-first-bow/|website=Discover Archery|publisher=Easton Foundations|access-date=24 January 2017}}</ref> (One exception is in modern [[Kyudo]] where all archers are trained to hold the bow in the left hand.)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Deprospero|first1=Dan and Jackie|title=One Point Lessons: A collection of simple lessons and explanations of Kyudo technique|url=http://www.kyudo.com/kyudo-l.html|website=Meishin Kyudojo|access-date=24 January 2017}}</ref> Therefore, if one is right-eye dominant, they would hold the bow in the left hand and draw the string with the right hand. However, not everyone agrees with this line of thought. A smoother, and more fluid release of the string will produce the most consistently repeatable shots, and therefore may provide greater accuracy of the arrow flight. Some believe that the hand with the greatest dexterity should therefore be the hand that draws and releases the string. Either eye can be used for aiming, and the less dominant eye can be trained over time to become more effective for use. To assist with this, an eye patch can be temporarily worn over the dominant eye.\n\nThe hand that holds the bow is referred to as the ''bow hand'' and its arm the ''bow arm''. The opposite hand is called the ''drawing hand'' or ''string hand''. Terms such as ''bow shoulder'' or ''string elbow'' follow the same convention.\n\nIf shooting according to eye dominance, right-eye-dominant archers shooting conventionally hold the bow with their left hand. If shooting according to hand dexterity, the archer draws the string with the hand that possesses the greatest dexterity, regardless of eye dominance.\n\n===Modern form===\n\nTo shoot an arrow, an archer first assumes the correct stance. The body should be at or nearly perpendicular to the target and the shooting line, with the feet placed shoulder-width apart. As an archer progresses from beginner to a more advanced level other stances such as the \"open stance\" or the \"closed stance\" may be used, although many choose to stick with a \"neutral stance\". Each archer has a particular preference, but mostly this term indicates that the leg furthest from the shooting line is a half to a whole foot-length from the other foot, on the ground.\n\nTo load, the bow is pointed toward the ground, tipped slightly clockwise of vertical (for a right handed shooter) and the shaft of the arrow is placed on the arrow rest or shelf. The back of the arrow is attached to the bowstring with the '''nock''' (a small locking groove located at the proximal end of the arrow). This step is called \"nocking the arrow\". Typical arrows with three vanes should be oriented such that a single vane, the \"cock feather\", is pointing away from the bow, to improve the clearance of the arrow as it passes the arrow rest.\n\nA compound bow is fitted with a special type of arrow rest, known as a launcher, and the arrow is usually loaded with the cock feather/vane pointed either up, or down, depending upon the type of launcher being used.\n\nThe bowstring and arrow are held with three fingers, or with a mechanical arrow release. Most commonly, for finger shooters, the index finger is placed above the arrow and the next two fingers below, although several other techniques have their adherents around the world, involving three fingers below the arrow, or an arrow pinching technique. ''Instinctive'' shooting is a technique eschewing sights and is often preferred by traditional archers (shooters of longbows and recurves). In either the split finger or three finger under case, the string is usually placed in the first or second joint, or else on the pads of the fingers. When using a mechanical release aid, the release is hooked onto the D-loop.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Billets to Bows|last = St. Charles|first = Glenn|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-0965139403|location = |pages =}}</ref>\n\nAnother type of string hold, used on traditional bows, is the type favoured by the Mongol warriors, known as the \"thumb release\", style. This involves using the thumb to draw the string, with the fingers curling around the thumb to add some support. To release the string, the fingers are opened out and the thumb relaxes to allow the string to slide off the thumb. When using this type of release, the arrow should rest on the same side of the bow as the drawing hand i.e. Left hand draw = arrow on left side of bow.\n\nThe archer then raises the bow and draws the string, with varying alignments for vertical versus slightly canted bow positions. This is often one fluid motion for shooters of recurves and longbows, which tend to vary from archer to archer. Compound shooters often experience a slight jerk during the drawback, at around the last inch and a half, where the draw weight is at its maximum\u2014before relaxing into a comfortable stable full draw position. The archer draws the string hand towards the face, where it should rest lightly at a fixed ''anchor point''. This point is consistent from shot to shot, and is usually at the corner of the mouth, on the chin, to the cheek, or to the ear, depending on preferred shooting style. The archer holds the bow arm outwards, toward the target. The elbow of this arm should be rotated so that the inner elbow is perpendicular to the ground, though archers with hyper extendable elbows tend to angle the inner elbow toward the ground, as exemplified by the Korean archer [[Jang Yong-Ho]]. This keeps the forearm out of the way of the bowstring.\n\nIn modern form, the archer stands erect, forming a \"T\". The archer's lower [[trapezius muscle]]s are used to pull the arrow to the anchor point. Some modern recurve bows are equipped with a mechanical device, called a clicker, which produces a clicking sound when the archer reaches the correct draw length. In contrast, traditional English Longbow shooters step \"into the bow\", exerting force with both the bow arm and the string hand arm simultaneously, especially when using bows having draw weights from 100&nbsp;lbs to over 175&nbsp;lbs. Heavily stacked traditional bows (recurves, long bows, and the like) are released immediately upon reaching full draw at maximum weight, whereas compound bows reach their maximum weight around the last inch and a half, dropping holding weight significantly at full draw. Compound bows are often held at full draw for a short time to achieve maximum accuracy.\n\nThe arrow is typically released by relaxing the fingers of the drawing hand (see [[Bow draw]]), or triggering the mechanical release aid. Usually the release aims to keep the drawing arm rigid, the bow hand relaxed, and the arrow is moved back using the back muscles, as opposed to using just arm motions. An archer should also pay attention to the recoil or ''follow through'' of his or her body, as it may indicate problems with form (technique) that affect accuracy.\n\n==Aiming methods==\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2011}}\n[[File:Kyujutsu14.jpg|thumb|From ''[[Hokusai Manga]]'', 1817]]\nThere are two main forms of aiming in archery: using a mechanical or fixed sight, or barebow.\n\nMechanical sights can be affixed to the bow to aid in aiming. They can be as simple as a pin, or may use optics with magnification. They usually also have a peep sight (rear sight) built into the string, which aids in a consistent anchor point. Modern compound bows automatically limit the draw length to give a consistent arrow velocity, while traditional bows allow great variation in draw length. Some bows use mechanical methods to make the draw length consistent. Barebow archers often use a sight picture, which includes the target, the bow, the hand, the arrow shaft and the arrow tip, as seen at the same time by the archer. With a fixed \"anchor point\" (where the string is brought to, or close to, the face), and a fully extended bow arm, successive shots taken with the sight picture in the same position fall on the same [[Predicted impact point|point]]. This lets the archer adjust aim with successive shots to achieve accuracy.\n\nModern archery equipment usually includes [[Sight (device)|sights]]. Instinctive aiming is used by many archers who use traditional bows. The two most common forms of a non-mechanical release are split-finger and three-under. Split-finger aiming requires the archer to place the index finger above the nocked arrow, while the middle and ring fingers are both placed below. Three-under aiming places the index, middle, and ring fingers under the nocked arrow. This technique allows the archer to better look down the arrow since the back of the arrow is closer to the dominant eye, and is commonly called \"gun barreling\" (referring to common aiming techniques used with firearms).\n\nWhen using short bows or shooting from horseback, it is difficult to use the sight picture. The archer may look at the target, but without including the weapon in the field of accurate view. Aiming then involves hand-eye coordination\u2014which includes proprioception and motor-muscle memory, similar to that used when throwing a ball. With sufficient practice, such archers can normally achieve good practical accuracy for hunting or for war.<ref name=\"lehman\">{{citation\n| title= Nine years among the Indians, 1870\u20131879\n| last= Lehman| first = Herman\n| publisher= University of New Mexico Press\n| year= 1927\n| isbn= 0-8263-1417-1\n| quote= I amused myself by making blunt arrows...

However, the energy must be imparted over a limited distance (determined by arm length) and therefore (because the projectile is accelerating) over a limited time, so the limiting factor is not work but rather [[Power (physics)|power]], which determined how much energy can be added in the limited time available. Power generated by muscles, however, is limited by [[Muscle contraction#Force-length and force-velocity relationships|force\u2013velocity relationship]], and even at the optimal contraction speed for power production, total work by the muscle is less than half of what it would be if the muscle contracted over the same distance at slow speeds, resulting in less than 1/4 the projectile launch velocity possible without the limitations of the force\u2013velocity relationship.\n\nWhen a bow is used, the muscles are able to perform work much more slowly, resulting in greater force and greater work done. This work is stored in the bow as [[elastic potential energy]], and when the bowstring is released, this stored energy is imparted to the arrow much more quickly than can be delivered by the muscles, resulting in much higher velocity and, hence, greater distance. This same process is employed by frogs, which use elastic tendons to increase jumping distance. In archery, some energy dissipates through [[Hysteresis#Elastic hysteresis|elastic hysteresis]], reducing the overall amount released when the bow is shot. Of the remaining energy, some is dampened both by the limbs of the bow and the bowstring. Depending on the arrow's elasticity, some of the energy is also absorbed by compressing the arrow, primarily because the release of the bowstring is rarely in line with the arrow shaft, causing it to flex out to one side. This is because the bowstring accelerates faster than the archer's fingers can open, and consequently some sideways motion is imparted to the string, and hence arrow nock, as the power and speed of the bow pulls the string off the opening fingers.\n\nEven with a release aid mechanism some of this effect is usually experienced, since the string always accelerates faster than the retaining part of the mechanism. This makes the arrow oscillate in flight\u2014its center flexing to one side and then the other repeatedly, gradually reducing as the arrow's flight proceeds. This is clearly visible in high-speed photography of arrows at discharge. A direct effect of these energy transfers can clearly be seen when [[dry firing]]. Dry firing refers to releasing the bowstring without a nocked arrow. Because there is no arrow to receive the stored potential energy, almost all the energy stays in the bow. Some have suggested that dry firing may cause physical damage to the bow, such as cracks and fractures\u2014and because most bows are not specifically made to handle the high amounts of energy dry firing produces, should never be done.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/75758007/The-Physics-of-Archery-AstraZeneca-Science-Teaching-Trust |title=The Physics of Archery AstraZeneca Science Teaching Trust |publisher=Docstoc.com |date= |access-date=26 March 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Snake Indians - Testing Bows - Walters 37194060.jpg|thumb|left|[[Snake Indians]] - testing bows, circa 1837 by [[Alfred Jacob Miller]], the [[Walters Art Museum]]]]\n\nModern arrows are made to a specified 'spine', or stiffness rating, to maintain matched flexing and hence accuracy of aim. This flexing can be a desirable feature, since, when the spine of the shaft is matched to the acceleration of the bow(string), the arrow bends or flexes around the bow and any arrow-rest, and consequently the arrow, and fletchings, have an un-impeded flight. This feature is known as the [[archer's paradox]]. It maintains accuracy, for if part of the arrow struck a glancing blow on discharge, some inconsistency would be present, and the excellent accuracy of modern equipment would not be achieved.\n\nThe accurate flight of an arrow is dependent on its fletching. The arrow's manufacturer (a \"fletcher\") can arrange fletching to cause the arrow to rotate along its axis. This improves accuracy by evening pressure buildups that would otherwise cause the arrow to \"plane\" on the air in a random direction after shooting. Even with a carefully made arrow, the slightest imperfection or air movement causes some unbalanced turbulence in air flow. Consequently, rotation creates an equalization of such turbulence, which, overall, maintains the intended direction of flight i.e. accuracy. This rotation is not to be confused with the rapid gyroscopic rotation of a rifle bullet. Fletching that is not arranged to induce rotation still improves accuracy by causing a restoring drag any time the arrow tilts from its intended direction of travel.\n\nThe innovative aspect of the invention of the bow and arrow was the amount of power delivered to an extremely small area by the arrow. The huge ratio of length vs. cross sectional area, coupled with velocity, made the arrow more powerful than any other hand held weapon until firearms were invented. Arrows can spread or concentrate force, depending on the application. Practice arrows, for instance, have a blunt tip that spreads the force over a wider area to reduce the risk of injury or limit penetration. Arrows designed to pierce armor in the Middle Ages used a very narrow and sharp tip (\"bodkinhead\") to concentrate the force. Arrows used for hunting used a narrow tip (\"broadhead\") that widens further, to facilitate both penetration and a large wound.\n\n{{Further|Archer's paradox}}\n\n==Hunting==\n{{Main|Bow hunting}}\n[[File:Bow compound.JPG|thumb|A modern compound hunting bow]]\nUsing archery to take game animals is known as \"bow hunting\". Bow hunting differs markedly from hunting with firearms, as distance between hunter and prey must be much shorter to ensure a humane kill. The skills and practices of bow hunting therefore emphasize very close approach to the prey, whether by still hunting, stalking, or waiting in a blind or tree stand. In many countries, including much of the United States, bow hunting for large and small game is legal. Bow hunters generally enjoy longer seasons than are allowed with other forms of hunting such as black powder, shotgun, or rifle. Usually, compound bows are used for large game hunting due to the relatively short time it takes to master them as opposed to the longbow or recurve bow. These compound bows may feature fiber optic sights, stabilizers, and other accessories designed to increase accuracy at longer distances. Using a bow and arrow to take fish is known as \"[[bow fishing]]\".\n\n==Modern competitive archery==\n{{Main|Modern competitive archery}}\nCompetitive archery involves shooting arrows at a target for accuracy from a set distance or distances. This is the most popular form of competitive archery worldwide and is called [[target archery]]. A form particularly popular in Europe and [[Americas|America]] is [[field archery]], shot at targets generally set at various distances in a wooded setting. Competitive archery in the United States is governed by USA Archery and National Field Archery Association (NFAA), which also certifies instructors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Archery/Resources/About-Us |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105090748/http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Archery/Resources/About-Us |archivedate=5 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nPara-Archery is an adaptation of archery for athletes with a disability governed by the [[World Archery Federation]] (WA), and is one of the sports in the Summer [[Paralympic Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://worldarchery.org/Para-Archery|title=Para Archery|website=World Archery|publisher=World Archery Foundation}}</ref> There are also several other lesser-known and historical forms of archery, as well as [[archery games|archery novelty games]] and [[Modern competitive archery#Flight archery|flight archery]], where the aim is to shoot the greatest distance.\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Portal inline|size=tiny|Archery}}\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*[[Modern competitive archery#3D archery|3D archery]]\n*[[Archery games]]\n*[[Bow draw]]\n*[[Bowfishing]]\n*[[Bowhunting]]\n*[[Clout archery]]\n*[[Field archery]]\n*[[Gungdo]] \n*[[Ky\u016bd\u014d]]\n*[[Ky\u016bjutsu]]\n*[[Mounted archery]]\n*[[Run archery]]\n*[[Sagittarii]]\n*[[Target archery]]\n*[[Turkish archery]]\n*[[List of archery terms]]\n*[[List of notable archers]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Ford, Horace (1887) [https://archive.org/details/theorypracticeof00ford ''The Theory and Practice of Archery''] London: Longmans, Green\n* Elmer, Robert P.

What is typical for his entire career, however, is a concern for design as a [[Gesamtkunstwerk]], a ''total work of art''; whereby he \u2013 together with his first wife [[Aino Aalto]] \u2013 would design not just the building, but give special treatments to the interior surfaces and design furniture, lamps, and furnishings and glassware. His furniture designs are considered [[Scandinavian design|Scandinavian Modern]], in the sense of a concern for materials, especially wood, and simplification but also technical experimentation, which led to him receiving patents for various manufacturing processes, such as bent wood.<ref name=Boy>{{harvnb|Boyce|1985|p=1}}</ref> The Alvar Aalto Museum, designed by Aalto himself, is located in what is regarded as his home city [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]].<ref>{{harvnb|Alvar Aalto Museum|2011}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Life===\n[[File:Alvar-Aalto-1976.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Alvar Aalto portrayed on a stamp published in 1976]]\n[[File:Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4n Kaupunginteatteri Aalto-laatta.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The signature of Alvar Aalto on the wall of [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]]'s theatre building.]]\n[[File:VIPlibrary.jpg|thumb|Auditorium of the Viipuri Municipal Library in the 1930s.]]\n[[File:Aalto studio.JPG|thumb|right|Alvar Aalto Studio, Helsinki (1954\u201356)]]\n[[File:Studio Aalto.jpg|thumb|right|Alvar Aalto Studio, Helsinki (1954\u201356)]]\n[[File:University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 main Building.jpg|thumb|right|Main Building of the [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]] University (1955)]]\n[[File:Heilig Geist Kirche Wolfsburg Alvar Aalto 1958 62 photo by Christian G\u00e4nshirt.JPG|thumb|Church of the Holy Ghost, [[Wolfsburg]] (1958-62)<ref name=\"heilig\">[http://www.kirche-wolfsburg.de/gemeinde/gemeindedetails.php?ID=21 Heilig-Geist-Kirchengemeinde bei kirche-wolfsburg.de], retrieved 27 February 2018.</ref>]]\n\nHugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born in [[Kuortane]], Finland.<ref>{{harvnb|Thorne|1984|p=1}}</ref> His father, Johan Henrik Aalto, was a Finnish-speaking land-surveyor and his mother, Selma Matilda \"Selly\" (n\u00e9e Hackstedt) was a Swedish-speaking postmistress. When Aalto was 5 years old, the family moved to [[Alaj\u00e4rvi]], and from there to [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]] in [[Central Finland]].{{cn|date=February 2018}} \n\nHe studied at the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 Lyceum school, where he completed his basic education in 1916, and took drawing lessons from a local artist named [[Jonas Heiska]]. In 1916, he then enrolled to study architecture at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]]. His studies were interrupted by the [[Finnish Civil War]], which he fought in. He fought on the side of the ''[[White Guard (Finland)|White Army]]'' and fought at the [[Battle of L\u00e4nkipohja]] and the [[Battle of Tampere]].<ref name=Pelkonen>{{harvnb|Pelkonen|2009|p=201}}</ref> \n\nHe built his first piece of architecture while still a student, a house for his parents, at [[Alaj\u00e4rvi]].<ref name=Labo1>{{harvnb|Lab\u00f2|1968|p=1}}</ref> Afterwards, he continued his education, graduating in 1921. In the summer of 1922 he began his official military service, finishing at the Hamina reserve officer training school, and was promoted to reserve second lieutenant in June 1923.<ref name=\"Heporauta 1999 10\">{{harvnb|Heporauta|1999|p=10}}</ref>\n\nIn 1920, while still a student, Aalto made his first trip abroad, travelling via [[Stockholm]] to [[Gothenburg]], where he even briefly found work with the architect Arvid Bjerke.<ref>{{harvnb|Weston|1997|p=20}}</ref> In 1922, he accomplished his first independent piece at the Industrial Exposition in [[Tampere]].<ref name=Labo1/> In 1923, he returned to [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]], where he opened his first architectural office under the name 'Alvar Aalto, Architect and Monumental Artist'. At that same time he also wrote articles for the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 newspaper ''Sis\u00e4-Suomi'' under the pseudonym Remus.<ref name=\"Heporauta 1999 10\"/> During this time, he designed a number of small single-family houses in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, and the office's workload steadily increased.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn October 6, 1924, Aalto married architect [[Aino Aalto|Aino Marsio]]; their honeymoon journey to Italy was Aalto's first trip there, though Aino had previously made a study trip there.<ref name=SK>{{harvnb|Suominen-Kokkonen|2007|p=18}}</ref> The latter trip together sealed an intellectual bond with the culture of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] region that was to remain important to Aalto for the rest of his life. \n\nOn their return, they continued with a number of local projects, notably the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 Worker's Club, which incorporated a number of motifs which they had studied during their trip, most notably the decorations of the Festival hall modelled on the [[Rucellai Sepulchre]] in Florence by  [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. Following winning the architecture competition for the Southwest Finland Agricultural Cooperative building in 1927 the Aaltos moved their office to [[Turku]]. They had made contact with the city's most progressive architect, [[Erik Bryggman]], already before moving, and they then began collaborating with him, most notably on the Turku Fair of 1928-29. Aalto's biographer, G\u00f6ran Schildt, claimed that Bryggman was the only architect with whom Aalto cooperated as an equal.<ref>{{harvnb|Schildt|1994|p=54}}</ref> With increasing works in the Finnish capital, the Aaltos' office moved again in 1933 to Helsinki.<ref>{{harvnb|Heporauta|1999|p=24}}</ref>\n\nThe Aaltos designed and built a [[Villa Aalto|joint house-office]] (1935\u201336) for themselves in [[Munkkiniemi]], Helsinki, but later (1954\u201356) had a [[Studio Aalto|purpose-built office]] erected in the same neighbourhood \u2013 nowadays the former is a \"home museum\" and the latter the premises of the Alvar Aalto Academy. In 1926, the young Aaltos designed and had built for themselves a summer cottage in [[Alaj\u00e4rvi]], Villa Flora.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Death==\nAino Aalto died of cancer in 1949. Aino and Alvar Aalto had two children, a daughter, Johanna \"Hanni\", Mrs Alanen (born 1925), and a son, Hamilkar Aalto (born 1928). In 1952, Aalto married architect [[Elissa M\u00e4kiniemi]] (died 1994), who had been working as an assistant in his office. \n\nIn 1952, he designed and built a summer cottage, the [[Alvar Aalto Museum#The Muuratsalo Experiental House|so-called Experimental House]], for himself and his new wife in [[Muuratsalo]] in Central Finland.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Guimaraes |first1=M. |title=A precedent in sustainable architecture: Alvar Aalto's summer house |journal=Journal of Green Building |date=2012 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=64-73}}</ref> Alvar Aalto died on 11 May 1976, in [[Helsinki]], and is buried in the [[Hietaniemi cemetery]] in Helsinki. His wife and the office employees continued the works of the office which were still in progress. In 1978 the [[Museum of Finnish Architecture]] in Helsinki arranged a major exhibition of Aalto's works.\n\n==Architecture career==\n\n===Early career: classicism===\n\nAlthough he is sometimes regarded as among the first and most influential architects of Nordic [[modernism]], a closer examination of the historical facts reveals that Aalto (while a pioneer in Finland) closely followed and had personal contacts with other pioneers in Sweden, in particular [[Gunnar Asplund]]<ref>{{harvnb|Paavilainen|1982|p=23}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Aalto|1998|p=29}}</ref> and [[Sven Markelius]].<ref>{{harvnb|Aalto|1998|p=76}}</ref> What they and many others of that generation in the Nordic countries had in common was that they started off from a classical education and were first designing classical architecture, though what historians now call [[Nordic Classicism]]<ref>{{harvnb|Paavilainen|1982|pp=11\u201315}}</ref> \u2013 a style that had been a reaction to the previous dominant style of [[National romantic style|National Romanticism]] \u2013 before moving, in the late 1920s, towards Modernism.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nUpon returning to Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 in 1923 to establish his own architect's office, Aalto busied himself with a number of single-family homes, all designed in the Nordic Classicism style, such as the manor-like house for his mother's cousin Terho Manner in T\u00f6ysa in 1923, a summer villa for the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 chief constable in 1923 and the Alatalo farmhouse in Tarvaala in 1924. During this period he also completed his first public buildings, the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 Workers' Club in 1925, the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 Defence Corps building in 1926 and the Sein\u00e4joki Defence Corp building in 1924\u201329.{{cn|date=February 2018}} He entered several architectural competitions for prestigious state public buildings, both in Finland and abroad, including the two competitions for the Finnish Parliament building in 1923 and 1924, the extension to the [[University of Helsinki]] in 1931, and the building to house the [[League of Nations]] in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1926\u201327. {{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nFurthermore, this was the period when Aalto was most prolific in his writings, with articles for professional journals and newspapers. Among his most well-known essays from this period are \"Urban culture\" (1924),<ref>{{harvnb|Aalto|1998|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> \"Temple baths on Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 ridge\" (1925),<ref>{{harvnb|Aalto|1998|pp=17\u201319}}</ref> \"Abb\u00e9 Coignard's sermon\" (1925),<ref>{{harvnb|Aalto|1998|pp=56\u201357}}</ref> and \"From doorstep to living room\" (1926).<ref>{{harvnb|Aalto|1998|pp=49\u201355}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Villa Mairea, Noormarkku, Finland.jpg|thumb|[[Villa Mairea]] in [[Noormarkku]]]]\n[[Image:Baker House, MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|Facade of [[List of MIT undergraduate dormitories#Baker House|Baker House]] on the [[Charles River]]]]\n[[Image:Helsinki University of Technology auditorium.jpg|thumb|Auditorium of the University of Technology, Helsinki, Finland (1949\u201366)]]\n[[Image:Aalto cultural house.JPG|thumb|House of Culture, Helsinki]]\n[[File:Library Wolfsburg Alvar Aalto photo by Christian G\u00e4nshirt.jpg|thumb|Cultural Center [[Wolfsburg]] (1958-62)<ref>[http://aalto-wolfsburg.com/content.php?id=kulturhaus Das Alvar-Aalto-Kulturhaus auf der Website des Alvar Aalto Zentrums Deutschland e.V.

Yet his humanistic approach is in full evidence in the library: the interior displays natural materials, warm colours, and undulating lines. Due to problems over financing and a change of site, the Viipuri Library project lasted eight years, and during that same time he also designed the Standard Apartment Building (1928-29) in Turku, Turun Sanomat Building (1929\u201330) and Paimio Sanatorium (1929\u201332). A number of factors heralded Aalto's shift towards modernism: on a personal level, Aalto's increased familiarization of international trends especially after travelling throughout Europe, but in terms of completed projects it was the client of the Standard Apartment Building giving Aalto the opportunity to experiment with concrete prefabrication, the cutting-edge Corbusian form language of the Turun Sanomat Building, and these were then carried forward both in the Paimio Sanatorium and in the ongoing design for the library. Although the Turun Sanomat Building and Paimio Sanatorium are comparatively pure modernist works, they too carried the seeds of his questioning of such an orthodox modernist approach and a move to a more daring, synthetic attitude. It has been pointed out that the planning principle for Paimio Sanatorium - the splayed wings - was indebted to the Zonnestraal Sanatorium (1925-31) by Jan Duiker, which Aalto visited while it was still under construction.<ref>{{harvnb|Hipeli|2014|p=116}}</ref> But while these early Functionalist works by Aalto bear hallmarks of influences from [[Le Corbusier]], [[Walter Gropius]] and other key modernist figures of central Europe, in all these buildings Aalto nevertheless started to show his individuality in a departure from such norms with the introduction of organic references.\n\nThrough Sven Markelius, Aalto became a member of the [[Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM), attending the second congress in Frankfurt in 1929 and the fourth congress in Athens in 1933, where he established a close friendship with [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy]], [[Sigfried Giedion]] and [[Philip Morton Shand]]. It was during this time that he followed closely the work of the main driving force behind the new modernism, [[Le Corbusier]], and visited him in his Paris office several times in the following years.\n\nIt was not until the completion of the Paimio Sanatorium (1932) and Viipuri Library (1935) that Aalto first achieved world attention in architecture. His reputation grew in the USA following the invitation to hold a retrospective exhibition of his works at the MOMA in New York in 1938, which was also the first time he visited the US. The significance of the exhibition - which afterwards went on a 12-city tour of the country - lies in the fact that he was only the second ever architect - after Le Corbusier - to have a solo exhibition at the museum. His reputation grew in the USA following the critical reception of his design for the Finnish Pavilion at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], described by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] as a \"work of genius\".<ref>{{harvnb|McCarter|2006|p=143}}</ref> It could be said that Aalto's international reputation was sealed with his inclusion in the second edition of Sigfried Giedion's influential book on Modernist architecture, ''Space, Time and Architecture: The growth of a new tradition'' (1949), in which Aalto received more attention than any other Modernist architect, including [[Le Corbusier]]. In his analysis of Aalto, Giedion gave primacy to qualities that depart from direct functionality, such as mood, atmosphere, intensity of life and even national characteristics, declaring that \"Finland is with Aalto wherever he goes\".\n\n===Mid career: experimentation===\nDuring the 1930s Alvar spent some time experimenting with laminated wood, making sculptures, and abstract reliefs, characterized by irregular curved forms. Utilizing this knowledge he was able to solve technical problems concerning the flexibility of wood and also of working out spatial issues in his designs.<ref name=Pelkonen/> Aalto's early experiments with wood and his move away from a purist modernism would be tested in built form with the commission to design [[Villa Mairea]] (1939) in [[Noormarkku]], the luxury home of the young industrialist couple Harry and [[Maire Gullichsen]]. It was Maire Gullichsen who acted as the main client, and she worked closely not only with Alvar but also Aino Aalto on the design, inspiring them to be more daring in their work. The original design was to include a [[art museum|private art gallery]], but this was never built. The building forms a U-shape around a central inner \"garden\" the central feature of which is a kidney-shaped swimming pool. Adjacent to the pool is a sauna executed in a rustic style, alluding to both Finnish and Japanese precedents. The design of the house is a synthesis of numerous stylistic influences, from traditional Finnish vernacular to purist modernism, as well as influences from English and Japanese architecture. While the house is clearly intended for a wealthy family, Aalto nevertheless argued that it was also an experiment that would prove useful in the design of mass housing.<ref>{{harvnb|Pallasmaa|1998|p=31}}</ref>\n\nHis increased fame led to offers and commissions outside Finland. In 1941 he accepted an invitation as a visiting professor to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in the USA. Because of the [[Second World War]], he returned to Finland to direct the Reconstruction Office. After the war, he returned to MIT, where he designed the student dormitory [[List of MIT undergraduate dormitories#Baker House|Baker House]], completed in 1949.{{sfn|Vitra Design Museum}} The dormitory lay along the [[Charles River]] and its undulating form provided maximum view and ventilation for each resident.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|Fenske|Fixler|2012}}</ref> This building was the first building of Aalto's redbrick period. Originally used in Baker House to signify the Ivy League university tradition, on his return to Finland Aalto used it in a number of key buildings, in particular, in several of the buildings in the new [[Helsinki University of Technology]] campus (starting in 1950), [[S\u00e4yn\u00e4tsalo Town Hall]] (1952), Helsinki Pensions Institute (1954), [[Kulttuuritalo|Helsinki House of Culture]] (1958), as well as in his own summer house, the so-called Experimental House in Muuratsalo (1957).\n\nIn the fifties Aalto immersed himself in his sculpting, be it with wood, bronze, marble, or mixed media. Among the notable works from this period is the memorial to the [[Battle of Suomussalmi]] (1960); located on the battlefield, it consists of a leaning bronze pillar on a pedestal.<ref name=Pelkonen/>\n\n===Mature career: monumentalism===\nThe early 1960s and 1970s (up until his death in 1976) were marked by key works in Helsinki, in particular the huge town plan for the void in centre of Helsinki adjacent to [[T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6]] Bay and the vast [[VR warehouses|railway yards]], and marked on the edges by significant buildings such as the National Museum and the main railway station, both by [[Eliel Saarinen]]. In his town plan Aalto proposed a line of separate marble-clad buildings fronting the bay which would house various cultural institutions, including a concert hall, opera, museum of architecture and headquarters for the [[Finnish Academy]]. The scheme also extended into the [[Kamppi]] district with a series of tall office blocks. Aalto first presented his scheme in 1961, but it went through various modifications during the early 1960s. Only two fragments of the overall plan were ever realized: the [[Finlandia Hall]] concert hall (1976) fronting T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 Bay, and an office building in the Kamppi district for the Helsinki Electricity Company (1975). The [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Miesian]] formal language of geometric grids employed in the buildings was also used by Aalto for other sites in Helsinki, including the [[Stora Enso|Enso-Gutzeit]] building (1962), the [[Stockmann|Academic Bookstore]] (1962) and the SYP Bank building (1969).\n\nFollowing Aalto's death in 1976 his office continued to operate under the direction of his widow, Elissa, completing works already to some extent designed. These works include the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 City Theatre and [[Aalto Theatre|Essen opera house]]. Since the death of Elissa Aalto the office has continued to operate as the Alvar Aalto Academy, giving advice on the restoration of Aalto buildings and organising the vast archive material.\n\n==Furniture career==\n[[File:Wolfsonian-FIU Museum - IMG 8234.JPG|thumb|Paimio chair]] \nWhereas Aalto was famous for his architecture, his furniture designs were well thought of and are still popular today. He studied [[Josef Hoffmann]] and the [[Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte]], and for a period of time, worked under [[Eliel Saarinen]].<ref name=Boy/> He also gained inspiration from [[Gebr\u00fcder Thonet]].<ref name=Boy/> During the late 1920s and 1930s he, working closely with Aino Aalto, also focused a lot of his energy on furniture design, partly due to the decision to design much of the individual furniture pieces and lamps for the Paimio Sanatorium. Of particular significance was the experimentation in bent plywood chairs, most notably the so-called Paimio chair, which had been designed for the sitting tuberculosis patient. The Aaltos, together with visual arts promoter Maire Gullichsen and art historian Nils-Gustav Hahl founded the [[Artek (company)|Artek]] company in 1935, ostensibly to sell Aalto products but also other imported products.<ref>{{harvnb|Pallasmaa|1998|p=19}}</ref> He became the first furniture designer to use the cantilever principle in chair design using wood.<ref name=Boy/>\n\n==Awards==\nAalto's awards included the [[Prince Eugen Medal]] in 1954, the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture from the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in 1957 and the [[AIA Gold Medal|Gold Medal]] from the [[American Institute of Architects]] in 1963. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1957.<ref name=AAAS>{{harvnb|Tourney|2013}}</ref> He also was a member of the [[Academy of Finland]], and was its president from 1963 to 1968. From 1925 to 1956 he was a member of the [[Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne]]. In 1960 he received an honorary doctorate at the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] (NTNU).<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2014}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nAalto's career spans the changes in style from ([[Nordic Classicism]]) to purist [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] Modernism to a more personal, synthetic and idiosyncratic Modernism. Aalto's wide field of design activity ranges from the large scale of [[city planning]] and architecture to interior design, furniture and [[glassware]] design and painting. It has been estimated that during his entire career Aalto designed over 500 individual buildings, approximately 300 of which were built, the vast majority of which are in Finland. He also has a few buildings in France, Germany, Italy and the USA.<ref name = GS>{{harvnb|Schildt|1994|pp=310\u2013313}}</ref>\n\nAalto's work with wood, was influenced by early Scandinavian architects; however, his experiments and departure from the norm brought attention to his ability to make wood do things not previously done. His techniques in the way he cut the [[beech]] tree, for example, and also his ability to use plywood as structural and aesthetic. Other examples include the rough-hewn vertical placement of logs at his pavilion at the [[Lapua]] expo, looking similar to a medieval barricade, at the orchestra platform at [[turku]] and the Paris expo at the World Fair, he used varying sizes and shapes of planks. Also at Paris and at [[Villa Mairea]] he utilized birch boarding in a vertical arrangement. Also his famous undulating walls and ceilings made of red pine.<ref name=Labo2>{{harvnb|Lab\u00f2|1968|p=2}}</ref> In his roofing, he created massive spans (155-foot at the covered statium at [[Otaniemi]]) all without tie rods. His stairway at Villa Mairea, he evokes feelings of a natural forest by binding beech wood with withes into columns.<ref name=Labo3>{{harvnb|Lab\u00f2|1968|p=3}}</ref>\n\nAalto claimed that his paintings were not made as individual artworks but as part of his process of architectural design, and many of his small-scale \"sculptural\" experiments with wood led to later larger architectural details and forms. These experiments also led to a number of patents: for example, he invented a new form of laminated bent-plywood furniture in 1932 (which was patented in 1933).<ref name=Chilvers/> His experimental method had been influenced by his meetings with various members of the [[Bauhaus]] design school, especially [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy]], whom he first met in 1930. Aalto's furniture was exhibited in London in 1935, to great critical acclaim, and to cope with the consumer demand Aalto, together with his wife Aino, [[Maire Gullichsen]] and Nils-Gustav Hahl founded the company [[Artek (company)|Artek]] that same year. Aalto glassware (Aino as well as Alvar) is manufactured by [[Iittala]].\n\nAalto's 'High Stool' and 'Stool E60' (manufactured by [[Artek (company)|Artek]]) are currently used in [[Apple Store]]s across the world to serve as seating for customers. Finished in black lacquer, the stools are used to seat customers at the 'Genius Bar' and also in other areas of the store at times when seating is required for a product workshop or special event. Aalto was also influential in bringing [[modern art]] to the knowledge of the Finnish people, in particular the work of his friends, [[Alexander Milne Calder]] and [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]].<ref name=Pelkonen/>\n\n===Significant buildings===\n[[File:KUNSTEN Aalborg 2006.jpg|thumb|KUNSTEN Museum of Modern Art Aalborg, Denmark (1958\u201372)]]\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Vergato, 1980) - BEIC 6353784.jpg|thumb|Church of Santa Maria Assunta, Riola of [[Vergato]], Italy, designed in 1966 and built 1975-1978.

In his analysis of Aalto, Giedion gave primacy to qualities that depart from direct functionality, such as mood, atmosphere, intensity of life and even national characteristics, declaring that \"Finland is with Aalto wherever he goes\". However, a few more recent architecture critics and historians have questioned Aalto's position of influence in the canonic history. Italian Marxist architecture historians [[Manfredo Tafuri]] and [[Francesco Dal Co]] put forward the viewpoint that Aalto's \"historical significance has perhaps been rather exaggerated; with Aalto we are outside of the great themes that have made the course of contemporary architecture so dramatic. The qualities of his works have a meaning only as masterful distractions, not subject to reproduction outside the remote reality in which they have their roots.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Tafuri|Co|1976|p=338}}</ref> Their viewpoint was propounded by their own priority given to urbanism, seeing Aalto as an anti-urban, and thus consequently disparaging what they regarded as peripheral non-urban areas of the world: \"Essentially his architecture is not appropriate to urban typologies.\" Similarly concerned with the appropriateness of Aalto's form language, at the other end of the political spectrum, American postmodernist critic [[Charles Jencks]] made a claim for the need for buildings to signify meaning; however, he then lifted out Aalto's Pensions Institute building as an example of what he termed Aalto's 'soft paternalism': \"Conceived as a fragmented mass to break up the feeling of bureaucracy, it succeeds all too well in being humane and killing the pensioner with kindness. The forms are familiar red brick and ribbon-strip windows broken by copper and bronze elements \u2013 all carried through with a literal-mindedness that borders on the soporific.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Jencks|1973|pp=80\u201381}}</ref> But also during Aalto's lifetime he faced critique from his fellow architects in Finland, most notably Kirmo Mikkola and [[Juhani Pallasmaa]]; by the last decade of his life Aalto's work was seen as idiosyncratic and individualistic, when the opposing tendencies of rationalism and constructivism \u2013 often championed under left-wing politics \u2013 argued for anonymous virtually non-aesthetic architecture. Mikkola wrote of Aalto's late works: \"Aalto has moved to his present baroque line...\"<ref>{{harvnb|Mikkola|1969|p=31}}</ref>\n\n==Memorials==\nAalto has been commemorated in a number of ways:\n* Alvar Aalto is the [[eponym]] of the [[Alvar Aalto Medal]], now considered{{bywho|date=September 2017}} one of world architecture's most prestigious awards.\n* Aalto was featured in the 50 mk note in the last series of the [[Finnish markka]] (before its replacement by the [[Euro]] in 2002).\n* The centenary of Aalto's birth in 1998 was marked in Finland not only by several books and exhibitions, but also by the promotion of specially bottled red and white Aalto Wine and a specially designed [[cupcake]].\n* In 1976, the year of his death, Aalto was commemorated on a Finnish postage stamp.\n* Piazza Alvar Aalto, a square named after Aalto, can be found in the Porta Nuova business district of Milan, Italy\n* [[Aalto University]], a Finnish university formed by merging [[Helsinki University of Technology]], [[Helsinki School of Economics]] and [[University of Art and Design Helsinki|TaiK]] in 2010, is named after Alvar Aalto.\n* An Alvar Aallon katu (Alvar Aalto Street) can be found in five different Finnish cities: Helsinki, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Oulu, Kotka and Sein\u00e4joki.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Architecture of Finland]]\n*[[Aino Aalto]]\n*[[Elissa Aalto]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n\n* {{cite book | last = Aalto | first = Alvar | editor-last1 = Schildt | editor-first1 = Goran  | title = Alvar Aalto in His Own Words | year = 1998 | publisher = Rizzoli | location = Helsinki, Finland | isbn = 978-0847820801 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite web | author = Alvar Aalto Museum | website = www.alvaraalto.fi | url = http://www.alvaraalto.fi/ | year = 2011 |title = Alvar Aalto Museo |trans-title=Alvar Aalto Museum | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Stanford | editor-last1 = Fenske | editor-first1 = Gail  | editor-last2 = Fixler | editor-first2 = David |   title = Aalto and America | year = 2013 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, MASS | isbn = 9780300176001 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite web|author=Anon |year=2014 |url=http://www.ntnu.no/forskning/aeresdoktorer |title=Honorary Doctors |website=NTNU |language=Norwegian |accessdate=10 September 2014 |archivedate=10 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SUHYDbx3?url=http://www.ntnu.no/forskning/aeresdoktorer |deadurl=yes |ref=harv |df=dmy }}\n* {{cite web | author = Anon | url = http://architect.architecture.sk/alvar-aalto-architect/alvar-aalto-architect.php | publisher = Architecture.sk | website = architect.architecture.sk | title = Alvar Aalto : architect biography | year = 2013 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite web | author=Anon |publisher = Vitra Design Museum | title = Biography Alvar Aalto 1898\u20131976 | url = http://www.design-museum.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Bilder/Ausstellungen/A62_Aalto/Biografie_Alvar_Aalto_EN.pdf | ref = {{harvid|Vitra Design Museum}} }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | last = Boyce | first = Charles | year = 1985 | encyclopedia = Dictionary of Furniture | publisher = Henry Holt and Co. | location = New York, NY | title = Aalto, Hugo Alvar Henrik (1899\u20131976) | isbn = 0-8050-0752-0 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | last = Brown | first = Theodore M. | title = Alto, Hugo Alvar Henrik | encyclopedia = McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Art | editor-first = Bernard S. | editor-last = Myers | publisher = McGraw-Hill Book Company | location = New York, NY | volume = I: AA-Ceylon | year = 1969 | lccn = 68026314 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | editor-last = Chilvers | editor-first = Ian | title = Aalto, Alvar | encyclopedia = The Oxford Dictionary of Art | edition = 3rd | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, UK | isbn = 0-19-860476-9 | origyear = 1988 | year = 2004 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Enckell | first = Ulla | title = Alvar Aalto: Taiteilija -

Similarly, the language spread to numerous other parts of the world as a result of British trade and colonisation elsewhere and the spread of the former [[British Empire]], which, by 1921, held sway over a population of 470\u2013570 million people, approximately a quarter of the world's population at that time.\n\nOver the past 400 years, the form of the language used in the [[Americas]]\u2014especially in the [[United States]]\u2014and that used in the United Kingdom have diverged in a few minor ways, leading to the versions now occasionally referred to as American English and British English. Differences between the two include [[pronunciation]], [[grammar]], [[Lexis (linguistics)|vocabulary (lexis)]], [[spelling]], [[punctuation]], [[idiom]]s, and formatting of [[calendar date|date]]s and [[number]]s. However, the differences in written and most spoken grammar structure tend to be much less than those of other aspects of the language in terms of mutual intelligibility. A small number of words have completely different meanings in the two versions or are even unknown or not used in one of the versions. One particular contribution towards formalizing these differences came from [[Noah Webster]], who wrote the [[Webster's Dictionary|first American dictionary]] (published 1828) with the intention of showing that people in the United States spoke a different dialect from Britain, much like a regional accent.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sokolowski|first1=Peter|title=Soop vs. Soup|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/video/0028-soopsoup.html|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=4 January 2015|format=Video|quote=\"Noah Webster: the man who changed the way we spell... up to a point.\"}}</ref>\n\nThis divergence between American English and British English has provided opportunities for humorous comment, e.g., [[George Bernard Shaw]] has a character say that the United States and United Kingdom are \"two countries divided by a common language\";<ref>See, for example, Krueger CL, Stade G, Karbiener K, Encyclopedia of British Writers: 19th and 20th Centuries Book Builders LLC Infobase Publishing {{ISBN|0816046700}}, p. 309</ref> and [[Oscar Wilde]] that \"We have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, the language\" (''[[The Canterville Ghost]]'', 1888). [[Henry Sweet]] incorrectly predicted in 1877 that within a century American English, Australian English and British English would be mutually unintelligible (''A Handbook of Phonetics''). It may be the case that increased worldwide communication through radio, television, the Internet and [[globalization]] has reduced the tendency towards regional variation. This can result either in some variations becoming extinct (for instance, ''the wireless'', being progressively superseded by ''the radio'') or in the acceptance of wide variations as \"perfectly good English\" everywhere.\n\nAlthough spoken American and British English are generally mutually intelligible, there are occasional differences which might cause embarrassment\u2014for example, in American English a ''rubber'' is usually interpreted as a ''condom'' rather than an ''eraser'';<ref>{{cite web|title=Macmillan Dictionary|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/rubber|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Lts|accessdate=30 September 2013|location=definition 3}}</ref> and a British ''fanny'' refers to the female pubic area, while the American ''fanny'' refers to an ''ass'' (US) or an ''arse'' (UK).\n\n==Word derivation and compounds==\n* Directional suffix ''-ward(s)'': British ''forwards'', ''towards'', ''rightwards'', etc.; American ''forward'', ''toward'', ''rightward''. In both dialects distribution varies somewhat: ''afterwards'', ''towards'', and ''backwards'' are not unusual in America; while in Britain ''upward'' and ''rightward'' are the more common options, as is ''forward'', which is standard in [[phrasal verb]]s such as ''look forward to''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/rightward|title=rightward - Definition of rightward in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/upward|title=upward - Definition of upward in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/forward|title=forward - Definition of forward in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref> The forms with ''-s'' may be used as adverbs (or preposition ''towards'') but rarely as adjectives: in Britain as in America, one says \"an upward motion\". The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 1897 suggested a semantic distinction for adverbs, with ''-wards'' having a more definite directional sense than ''-ward''; subsequent authorities such as [[Fowler's Modern English Usage|Fowler]] have disputed this contention.\n* American English (AmE) freely adds the suffix ''-s'' to ''day'', ''night'', ''evening'', ''weekend'', ''Monday'', etc. to form adverbs denoting repeated or customary action: ''I used to stay out evenings''; ''the library is closed Saturdays''. This usage has its roots in Old English but many of these constructions are now regarded as American (for example, the OED labels ''nights'' \"now chiefly N. Amer. colloq.\" in constructions such as ''to sleep nights'', but ''to work nights'' is standard in British English).\n* In British English (BrE), the agentive ''-er'' suffix is commonly attached to ''football'' (also ''[[cricket]]''; often ''[[netball]]''; occasionally ''basketball'' and ''volleyball''). AmE usually uses ''football player''. Where the sport's name is usable as a verb, the suffixation is standard in both dialects: for example, ''[[golf]]er'', ''bowler'' (in [[Ten-pin bowling]] and in [[Bowls|Lawn Bowls]]), and ''[[Shooting sport|shooter]]''. AmE appears sometimes to use the BrE form in ''baller'' as slang for a basketball player, as in the video game ''[[NBA Ballers]]''. However, this is derived from slang use of ''to ball'' as a verb meaning to play basketball.\n* English writers everywhere occasionally make new compound words from common phrases; for example, ''health care'' is now being replaced by ''healthcare'' on both sides of the Atlantic. However, AmE has made certain words in this fashion that are still treated as phrases in BrE.<!--example?-->\n* In [[English compound#Compound nouns|compound nouns]] of the form <verb>&lt;noun>, sometimes AmE prefers the [[Infinitive#Uses of the bare infinitive|bare infinitive]] where BrE favours the [[gerund]]. Examples include (AmE first): ''[[jump rope]]''/''skipping&nbsp;rope''; ''racecar''/''racing car''; ''rowboat''/''rowing boat''; ''sailboat''/''sailing boat''; ''file cabinet''/''filing cabinet''; ''dial tone''/''dialling tone''; ''drainboard''/''draining board''. <!-- the use of \"jump rope\" instead of \"skipping rope\" is much more complex than this rather simplistic explanation makes clear... not to mention that the actual British equivalent is \"jumping\" (not \"skipping\") rope, because \"to jump\" is different from \"to skip\" -->\n* Generally AmE has a tendency to drop inflectional suffixes, thus preferring clipped forms: compare ''cookbook'' v. ''cookery book''; ''Smith, age 40'' v. ''Smith, aged 40''; ''skim milk'' v. ''skimmed milk''; ''dollhouse'' v. ''dolls' house''; ''barber shop'' v. ''barber's shop''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&which_entry=008170%23x1%23x2%23cookbook&selected_word=cookbook&search_word=cookery |title='&#39;Cookbook'&#39; is now often used in BrE |publisher=Oup.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> This has recently been extended to appear on professionally printed commercial signage and some boxes themselves (not mere greengrocers' chalkboards): ''can vegetables'' and ''mash potatoes'' appear in the US.\n* Singular attributives in one country may be plural in the other, and ''vice versa''. For example, the UK has a ''drugs problem'', while the United States has a ''drug problem'' (although the singular usage is also commonly heard in the UK); Americans read the ''[[sports]]'' section of a newspaper; the British are more likely to read the ''sport'' section. However, BrE ''maths'' is singular, just as AmE ''math'' is: both are abbreviations of ''mathematics''.\n* Some British English words come from French roots, while American English finds its words from other places, e.g.  AmE ''[[eggplant]]'' and ''[[zucchini]]'' are ''[[aubergine]]'' and ''[[courgette]]'' in BrE.\n* Similarly, American English has occasionally replaced more traditional English words with their Spanish counterparts. This is especially common in regions historically affected by Spanish settlement (such as the American Southwest and Florida) as well as other areas that have since experienced strong Hispanic migration (such as urban centers). Examples of these include grocery markets' preference in the U.S. for Spanish names such as [[cilantro]] and [[chamomile|manzanilla]] over [[coriander]] and [[camomile]] respectively.\n\n==Vocabulary==\n{{see also|Lists of words having different meanings in American and British English|Glossary of American terms not widely used in the United Kingdom|Glossary of British terms not widely used in the United States}}\n\n===Overview of lexical differences===\n\n''Note: A lexicon is not made up of different words but different \"units of meaning\" (lexical units or lexical items e.g., \"fly ball\" in baseball), including idioms and figures of speech.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} This makes it easier to compare the dialects.''\n\nThough the influence of cross-culture media has done much to familiarize BrE and AmE speakers with each other's regional words and terms, many words are still recognized as part of a single form of English. Though the use of a British word would be acceptable in AmE (and vice versa), most listeners would recognize the word as coming from the other form of English and treat it much the same as a word borrowed from any other language.\n\n====Words and phrases that have their origins in BrE====\n\nMost speakers of AmE are aware of some BrE terms, although they may not generally use them or may be confused as to whether someone intends the American or British meaning (such as for ''[[biscuit]]''). It is generally very easy to guess what some words, such as \"driving licence\", mean. However, use of many other British words such as ''[[Polari#Naff|naff]]'' (slang but commonly used to mean \"not very good\") are unheard of in American English.\n\n====Words and phrases that have their origins in AmE====\n\nSpeakers of BrE are likely to understand most common AmE terms, examples such as \"sidewalk (pavement)\", \"gas (gasoline/petrol)\", \"counterclockwise (anticlockwise)\" or \"elevator (lift)\", without any problem, thanks in part to considerable exposure to American popular culture and literature. Certain terms that are heard less frequently, especially those likely to be absent or rare in American popular culture, e.g., \"copacetic (satisfactory)\", are unlikely to be understood by most BrE speakers.\n\n====Divergence====\n===== Words and phrases with different meanings =====\nWords such as ''bill''  and ''biscuit'' are used regularly in both AmE and BrE but mean different things in each form.  In AmE a bill is usually paper money (as in \"dollar bill\") though it can mean the same as in BrE, an invoice (as in \"the repair bill was \u00a3250\").  In AmE a biscuit (from the French twice baked as in biscotto) is what in BrE is called a scone and a biscuit in BrE is in AmE a cookie (from the Dutch 'little cake').  As chronicled by [[Winston Churchill]], the opposite meanings of the verb ''[[Table (verb)|to table]]'' created a misunderstanding during a meeting of the Allied forces;<ref>{{cite book |title=The Second World War, Volume 3: The Grand Alliance |last=Churchill |first=Winston |authorlink=Winston Churchill |year=1948\u20131954 |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn=978-0141441740}}</ref> in BrE to table an item on an agenda means to ''open it up'' for discussion whereas in AmE, it means to ''remove'' it from discussion, or at times, to suspend or delay discussion.\n\nThe word \"football\" in BrE refers to [[association football]], also known as [[Names for association football|soccer]]. In AmE, \"football\" means [[American football]]. The standard AmE term \"soccer\", a contraction of \"association (football)\", is of British origin, derived from the formalization of different codes of football in the 19th century, and was a fairly unremarkable usage (possibly marked for class) in BrE until relatively recently; it has lately become perceived incorrectly as an Americanism. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} In international (i.e. non-American) context, particularly in sports news outside English-speaking North America, American (or US branches of foreign) news agencies also use \"football\" to mean \"soccer\", especially in direct quotes.\n\nSimilarly, the word \"hockey\" in BrE refers to [[field hockey]] and in AmE, \"hockey\" means [[ice hockey]].\n\n=====Other ambiguity (complex cases)=====\n\nWords with [[List of words having different meanings in British and American English|completely different meanings]] are relatively few; most of the time there are either (1) words with one or more shared meanings and one or more meanings unique to one variety (for example, bathroom and toilet) or (2) words the meanings of which are actually common to both BrE and AmE but that show differences in frequency, connotation or denotation (for example, ''smart'', ''clever'', ''mad'').\n\nSome differences in usage and/or meaning can cause confusion or embarrassment. For example, the word ''fanny'' is a slang word for [[vulva]] in BrE but means [[buttocks]] in AmE\u2014the AmE phrase ''[[fanny pack]]'' is ''bum bag'' in BrE. In AmE the word ''pissed'' means being annoyed whereas in BrE it is a coarse word for being drunk (in both varieties, ''pissed off'' means irritated).\n\nSimilarly, in AmE the word ''pants'' is the common word for the BrE ''trousers'' and ''knickers'' refers to a variety of half-length trousers (though most AmE users would use the term \"shorts\" rather than knickers), while the majority of BrE speakers would understand ''pants'' to mean ''underpants'' and ''knickers'' to mean ''female underpants''.\n\nSometimes the confusion is more subtle. In AmE the word ''quite'' used as a qualifier is generally a reinforcement: for example, \"I'm quite hungry\" means \"I'm very hungry\". In BrE ''quite'' (which is much more common in conversation) may have this meaning, as in \"quite right\" or \"quite mad\", but it more commonly means \"somewhat\", so that in BrE \"I'm quite hungry\" can mean \"I'm somewhat hungry\". This divergence of use can lead to misunderstanding.\n\n====Frequency====\n* In the UK the word ''whilst'' is historically acceptable as a conjunction (as an alternative to ''while'', especially prevalent in some dialects). In AmE only ''while'' is used in both contexts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Other conjunctions with the ''-st'' ending are also found even in AmE as much as in BrE, despite being old-fashioned or an affection.  ''Whilst'' tends to appear in non-temporal senses, as when used to point out a contrast.\n* In the UK generally the term ''fall'' meaning \"[[autumn]]\" is [[obsolete]]. Although found often from [[English literature#Elizabethan era|Elizabethan literature]] to [[Victorian literature]], continued understanding of the word is usually ascribed to its continued use in America.<ref>{{cite dictionary |title= fall, n.1. |encyclopedia= OED Online |date= December 2016 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref>\n*In the UK the term ''period'' for a [[full stop]] is not used; in AmE the term ''full stop'' is rarely, if ever, used for the punctuation mark.

In Britain, the phrases \"holiday season\" and \"holiday period\" refer to the period in the summer when most people take time off from work, and travel; AmE does not use ''holiday'' in this sense, instead using ''[[vacation]]'' for recreational excursions.\n\nIn AmE, the prevalent Christmas greeting is \"Merry Christmas\", which is the traditional English Christmas greeting, famously found in the English Christmas [[carol (music)|carol]] \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]],\" and which appears several times in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''.<ref>{{cite news | title = Dickens' classic 'Christmas Carol' still sings to us| url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2008-12-17-dickens-main_N.htm| publisher = ''[[USA Today]]''| accessdate =May 4, 2010| first=Bob| last=Minzesheimer| date=December 22, 2008}}</ref> In BrE,\"Happy Christmas\" is a common alternative to \"Merry Christmas\".\n\n===Idiosyncratic differences===\n====Figures of speech====\nBoth BrE and AmE use the expression \"I couldn't care less\" to mean the speaker does not care at all. Some Americans use \"I could care less\" to mean the same thing. This variant is frequently derided as sloppy, as the literal meaning of the words is that the speaker ''does'' care to some extent.\n\nIn both areas, saying, \"I don't mind\" often means, \"I'm not annoyed\" (for example, by someone's smoking), while \"I don't care\" often means, \"The matter is trivial or boring\". However, in answering a question such as \"Tea or coffee?\", if either alternative is equally acceptable an American may answer, \"I don't care\", while a British person may answer, \"I don't mind\". Either sounds odd to the other.\n\n====Equivalent idioms====\nA number of English idioms that have essentially the same meaning show lexical differences between the British and the American version; for instance:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!British English\n!American English\n|-\n|''not touch something with a bargepole''\n|''not touch something with a ten-foot pole''\n|-\n|''sweep under the carpet''\n|''sweep under the rug*''\n|-\n|''touch wood''\n|''knock on wood''\n|-\n|''see the wood for the trees''\n|''see the forest for the trees''\n|-\n|''put a spanner in the works''\n|''throw a ''(''monkey'')'' wrench (into a situation)''\n|-\n|''put ''(or'' stick'')'' your oar in''<ref>{{cite web|title=put/stick your oar in|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/put-stick-your-oar-in|work=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref><br/>but ''it won't make a ha'porth of difference''<ref>{{cite web|title=(not) a ha'porth of difference|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/ha-porth#ha-porth__3|work=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref><br/>''to put your two penn'orth'' (or ''tuppence worth'') ''in''\n|''to put your two cents ''(or ''two cents' worth'')'' in''<ref>{{cite web|title=two cents/two cents' worth|url=http://dictionaries.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=two*1+1&dict=A|work=Cambridge Dictionary of American English|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref>\n|-\n|''skeleton in the cupboard''\n|''skeleton in the closet''\n|-\n|''a home from home''\n|''a home away from home''\n|-\n|''blow one's own trumpet''\n|''blow ''(or'' toot'')'' one's own horn''\n|-\n|''a drop in the ocean''\n|''a drop in the bucket'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Drop|url=http://www.learnersdictionary.com/search/drop|work=Mirriam-Webster's Learner's Dictionary|publisher=Mirriam-Webster|accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref> \n|-\n|''flogging a dead horse''\n|''beating a dead horse''\n|-\n|''haven't (got) a clue''\n|''don't have a clue'' or ''have no clue'' (the British forms are also acceptable)\n|-\n|''couldn't care less''\n|''could care less'' or ''couldn't care less''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/could-care-less-versus-couldnt-care-less|title=\"Could Care Less\" Versus \"Couldn't Care Less\"|website=Quickanddirtytips.com|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|''a new lease of life''\n|''a new lease on life''\n|-\n|''lie of the land''\n|''lay of the land''\n|-\n|''take it with a pinch of salt''\n|''take it with a grain of salt''\n|-\n|''a storm in a teacup''\n|''a tempest in a teapot''\n|-\n|''slowcoach''\n|''slowpoke''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2013/05/slowpoke.html|title=The \u201cpoke\u201d in \u201cslowpoke\u201d|date=2013-05-06|work=Grammarphobia|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en-US}}</ref>\n|}\n{{Asterisk}} In the US, a \"carpet\" typically refers to a [[fitted carpet]], rather than a rug.\n\n==Style==\n===Use of ''that'' and ''which'' in restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses===\n{{Further|English relative clauses#Restrictive or non-restrictive relative clauses}}\nGenerally, a non-restrictive relative clause (also called non-defining or supplementary)  is one that contains information that is supplementary, i.e. does not change the meaning of the rest of the sentence, while a restrictive relative clause (also called defining or integrated) is, one which contains information essential to the meaning of the sentence, effectively limiting the modified noun phrase to a subset that is defined by the relative clause.<ref name=\"Garner 2016, 900-902\">{{Cite book|pages=900\u2013902 |last1=Garner |first1=Bryan A. |authorlink1= Bryan A.

Different standards became noticeable after the publishing of influential [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. For the most part current BrE spellings follow those of [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755), while AmE spellings follow those of [[Noah Webster]]'s ''[[An American Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1828). In Britain, the influences of those who preferred the French spellings of certain words proved decisive. In many cases AmE spelling deviated from mainstream British spelling; on the other hand it has also often retained older forms. Many of the now characteristic AmE spellings were popularized, although often not created, by Noah Webster. Webster chose already-existing alternative spellings \"on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology\".<ref>Algeo, John. \"The Effects of the Revolution on Language\", in ''A Companion to the American Revolution''. John Wiley & Sons, 2008. p.599</ref> Webster did attempt to introduce some [[English-language spelling reform|reformed spellings]], as did the [[Simplified Spelling Board]] in the early 20th century, but most were not adopted. Later spelling changes in the UK had little effect on present-day US spelling, and vice versa.\n\n===Punctuation===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of British words not widely used in the United States]] -->\n\n====Full stops and periods in abbreviations====\nThere have been some trends of transatlantic difference in use of periods in some abbreviations. These are discussed at ''[[Abbreviation#Periods (full stops) and spaces|Abbreviation \u00a7 Periods (full stops) and spaces]]''. Unit symbols such as kg and Hz are never punctuated.<ref>{{SIBrochure8th|page = 130}}</ref>\n\n====Parentheses/brackets====\nIn British English, \"( )\" marks are often referred to as brackets, whereas \"[ ]\" are called square brackets and \"{ }\" are called curly brackets. In formal British English and in American English \"( )\" marks are parentheses (singular: parenthesis), \"[ ]\" are called brackets or square brackets, and \"{ }\" can be called either curly brackets or curly braces.<ref>{{citation|last=Crystal|first=David|title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|edition=second|ISBN=0-521-82348-X|page=278}} \"It also gives ... clues about the prosody ... through such features as question marks, exclamation marks and parentheses\".</ref> In both countries, standard usage is to place punctuation outside the parenthesis, unless the entire sentence is contained within them:\n* \"I am going to the store (if it is still open).\"\n* (This page is intentionally blank.)\nIn the case of a parenthetical expression which is itself a complete sentence, the final punctuation may be placed inside the parenthesis, particularly if not a full stop:\n* \"I am going to the store (Is it still open?)\"\n* \"I am going to the store (I hope it's still open!)\"\n\n==Demographics==\nLinguist [[Braj Kachru]], quoted by the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' in 1996, stated that \"American English is spreading faster than British English\". The ''Monitor'' stated that English taught in Europe, India, and parts of Asia and Africa is more British-influenced (while English taught in Latin America, Japan, and South Korea is more American-influenced); however, informal English use outside the classroom is more influenced by the United States: Americans greatly outnumber Britons; in addition, as of 1993, the United States controlled 75 percent of the world's TV programming.<ref>{{cite news|title=The World Rushes To Speak and Write 'American' English|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1996/0904/090496.intl.global.1.html|accessdate=28 December 2017|work=Christian Science Monitor|date=4 September 1996}}</ref> A BBC columnist assessed in 2015 that \"American English is the current dominant force globally, like it or not\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Harbeck|first1=James|title=Why isn't 'American' a language?|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150715-why-isnt-american-a-language|accessdate=28 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Language|United Kingdom|United States}}\n* [[Lists of words having different meanings in American and British English]]\n* [[American and British English pronunciation differences]]\n* [[American and British English spelling differences]]\n* [[American and British English grammatical differences]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Algeo, John (2006).

A read  returns the value stored in R and write(v) changes the value stored in R to v.\nA register is called atomic if it satisfies the two following properties:\n\n1) Each invocation op of a read or write operation:\n\n\u2022Must appear as if it were executed at a single point \u03c4(op) in time.\n\n\u2022\u03c4 (op) works as follow:\n\u03c4b(op) \u2264 \u03c4 (op) \u2264 \u03c4e(op): where \u03c4b(op) and \u03c4e(op) indicate the time when the operation op begins and ends.\n\n\u2022If op1 \u2260 op2, then \u03c4 (op1)\u2260\u03c4 (op2)\n\n2) Each read operation returns the value written by the last write operation before the read, in the sequence where all operations are ordered by their \u03c4 values.\n\n'''Atomic/Linearizable register:'''\n\nTermination: when a node is correct,sooner or later each read and write operation will complete.\n\n'''Safety Property''' (Linearization points for read and write and failed operations):\n\nRead operation:It appears as if happened at all nodes at some times between the invocation and response time.\n\nWrite operation: Similar to read operation,it appears as if happened at all nodes at some times between the invocation and response time.\n\nFailed operation(The atomic term comes from this notion):It appears as if it is completed at every single node or it never happened at any node.\n\nExample : We know that an atomic register is one that is linearizable to a sequential safe register.\n\n[[File:Atomic register1.jpg|centre|atomic]]\n\nThe following picture shows where we should put the linearization point for each operation:\n\n[[File:Atomic register.jpg|center|Atomic register]]\n\n \nAn atomic register could be defined for a variable with a single writer but multi- readers(SWMR),single-writer/single-reader (SWSR),or multi-writer/multi-reader(MWMR).

The current is circumpolar due to the lack of any landmass connecting with Antarctica and this keeps warm ocean waters away from Antarctica, enabling that continent to maintain its huge [[ice sheet]].\n\nAssociated with the Circumpolar Current is the [[Antarctic Convergence]], where the cold Antarctic waters meet the warmer waters of the [[subantarctic]], creating a zone of upwelling nutrients. These nurture high levels of [[phytoplankton]] with associated copepods and krill, and resultant foodchains supporting fish, whales, seals, penguins, albatrosses, and a wealth of other species.\n\nThe ACC has been known to sailors for centuries; it greatly speeds up any travel from west to east, but makes sailing extremely difficult from east to west; although this is mostly due to the prevailing [[Westerlies|westerly winds]]. The circumstances preceding the [[mutiny on the Bounty|mutiny on the ''Bounty'']] and [[Jack London]]'s story \"Make Westing\" poignantly illustrated the difficulty it caused for mariners seeking to round [[Cape Horn]] on the clipper ship route between New York and California.<ref>{{Harvnb|London|1907}}</ref> The [[clipper route]], which is the fastest sailing route around the world, follows the ACC around three continental capes \u2013 [[Cape Agulhas]] (Africa), [[South East Cape]] (Australia), and [[Cape Horn]] (South America).\n\nThe current creates the [[Ross Gyre|Ross]] and [[Weddell Gyre|Weddell gyres]].\n\n== Structure ==\n[[Image:Antarctic Circumpolar Current.jpg|thumb|The Antarctic Circumpolar Current is the strongest current system in the world oceans and the only ocean current linking all major oceans: the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans.  Seawater density fronts after {{Harvnb|Orsi|Whitworth|Nowlin|1995}}.]]\nThe ACC connects the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and [[Indian Ocean]]s, and serves as a principal pathway of exchange among them. The current is strongly constrained by [[landform]] and [[bathymetric]] features. To trace it starting arbitrarily at South America, it flows through the [[Drake Passage]] between South America and the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] and then is split by the [[Scotia Arc]] to the east, with a shallow warm branch flowing to the north in the [[Falkland Current]] and a deeper branch passing through the Arc more to the east before also turning to the north. Passing through the Indian Ocean, the current first retroflects the [[Agulhas Current]] to form the [[Agulhas Return Current]] before it is split by the [[Kerguelen Plateau]], and then moving northward again. Deflection is also seen as it passes over the [[mid-ocean ridge]] in the Southeast Pacific.\n\n===Fronts===\nThe current is accompanied by three [[Front (Oceanography)|fronts]]: the Subantarctic front (SAF), the [[Polar front]] (PF), and the Southern ACC front (SACC).<ref>{{Harvnb|Stewart|2007}}</ref> Furthermore, the waters of the Southern Ocean are separated from the warmer and saltier subtropical waters by the [[subtropical front]] (STF).<ref>{{Harvnb|Orsi|Whitworth|Nowlin|1995|loc=Introduction, p.641}}</ref>\n\nThe northern boundary of the ACC is defined by the northern edge of the SAF, this being the most northerly water to pass through Drake Passage and therefore be circumpolar. Much of the ACC transport is carried in this front, which is defined as the latitude at which a subsurface salinity minimum or a thick layer of unstratified Subantarctic [[mode water]] first appears, allowed by temperature dominating density stratification. Still further south lies the PF, which is marked by a transition to very cold, relatively fresh, Antarctic Surface Water at the surface. Here a temperature minimum is allowed by salinity dominating density stratification, due to the lower temperatures. Farther south still is the SACC, which is determined as the southernmost extent of Circumpolar Deep Water (temperature of about 2&nbsp;\u00b0C at 400&nbsp;m). This water mass flows along the shelfbreak of the western Antarctic Peninsula and thus marks the most southerly water flowing through Drake Passage and therefore circumpolar. The bulk of the transport is carried in the middle two fronts.\n\nThe total transport of the ACC at Drake Passage is estimated to be around 135&nbsp;Sv, or about 135 times the transport of all the world's rivers combined. There is a relatively small addition of flow in the Indian Ocean, with the transport south of [[Tasmania]] reaching around 147&nbsp;Sv, at which point the current is probably the largest on the planet.\n\n==Dynamics==\nThe circumpolar current is driven by the strong westerly winds in the latitudes of the Southern Ocean.\n\nIn latitudes where there are continents, winds blowing on light surface water can simply pile up light water against these continents. But in the Southern Ocean, the momentum imparted to the surface waters cannot be offset in this way. There are different theories on how the Circumpolar Current balances the momentum imparted by the winds. The increasing eastward momentum imparted by the winds causes water parcels to drift outward from the axis of the Earth's rotation (in other words, northward) as a result of the [[Coriolis force]]. This northward [[Ekman transport]] is balanced by a southward, pressure-driven flow below the depths of the major ridge systems. Some theories connect these flows directly, implying that there is significant upwelling of dense deep waters within the Southern Ocean, transformation of these waters into light surface waters, and a transformation of waters in the opposite direction to the north. Such theories link the magnitude of the Circumpolar Current with the global [[thermohaline circulation]], particularly the properties of the North Atlantic.\n\nAlternatively, [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)#Mesoscale ocean eddies|ocean eddies]], the oceanic equivalent of atmospheric storms, or the large-scale meanders of the Circumpolar Current may directly transport momentum downward in the water column. This is because such flows can produce a net southward flow in the troughs and a net northward flow over the ridges without requiring any transformation of density. In practice both the thermohaline and the eddy/meander mechanisms are likely to be important.\n\nThe current flows at a rate of about {{Convert|4|km/h|abbr=on}} over the [[Macquarie Fault Zone|Macquarie Ridge]] south of New Zealand.<ref name=\"brittlestar\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-05/coml-ema051208.php |title=Explorers marvel at 'Brittlestar City' on seamount in powerful current swirling around Antarctica |accessdate=6 June 2008 |date=18 May 2008 |work= }}</ref> The ACC varies with time.

Trends in the Antarctic Oscillation have been hypothesized to account for an increase in the transport of the Circumpolar Current over the past two decades.\n\n== Formation ==\nPublished estimates of the onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current vary, but it is commonly considered to have started at the [[Eocene]]/[[Oligocene]] boundary. The isolation of Antarctica and formation of the ACC occurred with the openings of the [[Tasmanian Seaway]] and the [[Drake Passage]]. The Tasmanian Seaway separates East Antarctica and Australia, and is reported to have opened to water circulation 33.5 Ma.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hassold|Rea|Pluijm|Par\u00e9s|2009}}</ref> The timing of the opening of the Drake Passage, between South America and the Antarctic Peninsula, is more disputed; [[tectonic]] and sediment evidence show that it could have been open as early as pre 34&nbsp;Ma,<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|Filippelli|Florindo|Martin|2007}}</ref> estimates of the opening of the Drake passage are between 20 and 40 Ma.<ref name=\"Siegert-etal-2008\">{{Harvnb|Siegert|Barrett|Deconto|Dunbar|2008}}</ref> The isolation of Antarctica by the current is credited by many researchers with causing the [[glaciation]] of Antarctica and global cooling in the [[Eocene]] epoch.

Phytoplankton blooms are dominated by diatoms and grazed by copepods in the open ocean, and by krill closer to the continent. Diatom production continues through the summer, and populations of krill are sustained, bringing large numbers of [[cetacean]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, seals, birds, and fish to the area.<ref name=\"Miller-2004\" />\n\nPhytoplankton blooms are believed to be limited by irradiance in the austral (southern hemisphere) spring, and by biologically available iron in the summer.<ref>{{Harvnb|Peloquin|Smith|2007}}</ref> Much of the biology in the area occurs along the major fronts of the current, the Subtropical, Subantarctic, and the Antarctic Polar fronts, these are areas associated with well defined temperature changes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/education-and-outreach/additional/science-focus/locus/tutorials/module6.shtml |title=The Southern Ocean |publisher=GES DISC: Goddard Earth Sciences, Data & Information Services Center |date=May 2012 |accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref> Size and distribution of phytoplankton are also related to fronts.

Areas of open water left from ice melt are good areas for phytoplankton blooms. The phytoplankton takes carbon from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. As the blooms die and sink, the carbon can be stored in sediments for thousands of years. This natural carbon sink is estimated to remove 3.5 million tonnes from the ocean each year. 3.5 million tonnes of carbon taken from the ocean and atmosphere is equivalent to 12.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.<ref>{{Harvnb|Peck|Barnes|Cook|Fleming|2010}}</ref>\n\n== Studies ==\nAn expedition in May 2008 by 19 scientists<ref>{{Harvnb|O'Hara|Rowden|Williams|2008}}</ref> studied the geology and biology of eight [[Macquarie Fault Zone|Macquarie Ridge]] sea mounts, as well as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to investigate the effects of climate change of the Southern Ocean.

From 1916 to 1928, Arbor Day was celebrated on the Chinese [[Qingming Festival]], which is on the first day of the fifth solar term of the traditional Chinese [[lunisolar calendar]]. In 1929, the date for Arbor Day was changed to March 12 to commemorate [[Sun Yat-sen]]. In 1981, the fourth session of the Fifth [[National People's Congress]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] adopted the Resolution on the Unfolding of a Nationwide Voluntary Tree-planting Campaign. This resolution established the Arbor Day and stipulated that every able-bodied citizen between the ages of 11 and 60 should plant three to five trees per year or do the equivalent amount of work in seedling, cultivation, tree tending or other services. Supporting documentation instructs all units to report population statistics to the local afforestation committees as the basis for workload allocation.

J. Ayer''', was a British philosopher known for his promotion of [[logical positivism]], particularly in his books ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936) and ''The Problem of Knowledge'' (1956).\n\nHe was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[Oxford University]], after which he studied the philosophy of logical positivism at the [[University of Vienna]]. From 1933 to 1940 he lectured on philosophy at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://biography.yourdictionary.com/alfred-jules-ayer|title= Alfred Jules Ayer Facts|publisher= Your Dictionary|accessdate = 18 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] Ayer was a [[Special Operations Executive]] and [[MI6]] agent.<ref>{{cite book |title=The politics of apolitical culture: the Congress for Cultural Freedom, the CIA, and post-war American hegemony |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |author=Scott-Smith, Giles |page=109 |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-24445-9}}</ref>\n\nHe was [[Grote Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic|Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic]] at [[University College London]] from 1946 until 1959, after which he returned to Oxford to become [[Wykeham Professor]] of Logic at [[New College, Oxford|New College]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Alfred Jules Ayer|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ayer/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=15 April 2016|date=2005}}</ref> He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1951 to 1952 and [[knight]]ed in 1970. He was known for his advocacy of [[humanism]], and was the second President of the [[British Humanist Association]] (now known as Humanists UK).\n\n== Life ==\nAyer was born in [[St John's Wood]], in north west London, to a wealthy family from continental Europe. His mother, Reine Citro\u00ebn, was from the Dutch-Jewish family who founded the [[Citro\u00ebn]] car company in France. His father, Jules Ayer, was a Swiss [[Calvinist]] financier who worked for the [[Rothschild family]].<ref>{{cite book |title= A.J.

It was at Eton that Ayer first became known for his characteristic bravado and precocity. Although primarily interested in furthering his intellectual pursuits, he was very keen on sports, particularly rugby, and reputedly played the [[Eton wall game|Eton Wall Game]] very well.<ref>{{cite book |title= A.J. Ayer: A Life |author= Rogers, Ben |publisher= Vintage |location =London |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |pages=42\u201344 |isbn= 978-0-09-953681-9}}</ref> In the final examinations at Eton, Ayer came second in his year, and first in classics. In his final year, as a member of Eton's senior council, he unsuccessfully campaigned for the abolition of [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]] at the school. He won a classics scholarship to [[Christ Church, Oxford]].\n\nAfter graduation from Oxford University Ayer spent a year in Vienna, returned to England and published his first book, ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'' in 1936.  The first exposition in English of [[Logical Positivism]] as newly developed by the [[Vienna Circle]], this made Ayer at age 26 the 'enfant terrible' of British philosophy.  In the Second World War he served as an officer in the Welsh Guards, chiefly in intelligence (Special Operations Executive (SOE) and [[MI6]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/21/mi6-first-authorised-history |location=London |work =The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Norton-Taylor |title=Graham Greene, Arthur Ransome and Somerset Maugham all spied for Britain, admits MI6 |date=21 September 2010}}</ref>).   Ayer was commissioned [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Welsh Guards]] from Officer Cadet Training Unit on 21 September 1940.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34957 |supp=y|page=5776|date=27 September 1940}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war he briefly returned to [[Oxford University]] where he became a fellow and [[Dean of Wadham College]]. He thereafter taught philosophy at [[London University]] from 1946 until 1959, when he also started to appear on radio and television. He was an extrovert and social mixer who liked dancing and attending the clubs in London and New York. He was also obsessed with sport: he had played rugby for Eton, and was a noted cricketer and a keen supporter of [[Tottenham Hotspur]] football team. For an academic, Ayer was an unusually well-connected figure in his time, with close links to 'high society' and the establishment. Presiding over Oxford high-tables, he is often described as charming, but at times he could also be intimidating.<ref>{{cite book |title= Iris Murdoch as I knew her |first=A.

She died in 1985 and in 1989 he remarried Dee Wells, who survived him.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Ayer also had a daughter with Hollywood columnist [[Sheilah Graham Westbrook]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nFrom 1959 to his retirement in 1978, Sir Alfred held the Wykeham Chair, Professor of Logic at Oxford. He was knighted in 1970.\n\nAyer died on 27 June 1989. From 1980 to 1989, Ayer lived at 51 York Street, [[Marylebone]], where a memorial plaque was unveiled on 19 November 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |title=City of Westminster green plaques|accessdate=2011-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |archivedate=16 July 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== Philosophical ideas ==\nIn ''Language, Truth and Logic'' (1936), Ayer presents the [[verification principle]] as the only valid basis for philosophy.  Unless logical or empirical verification is possible, statements like \"God exists\" or \"charity is good\" are not true or untrue but meaningless, and may thus be excluded or ignored.  Religious language in particular was unverifiable and as such literally nonsense. He also criticises C. A. Mace's opinion<ref>\"Representation and Expression,\" Analysis, Vol.1, No.3; \"Metaphysics and Emotive Language,\" Analysis Vol. II, nos. 1 and 2,</ref> that metaphysics is a form of intellectual poetry.<ref>Language, Truth and Logic 1946/1952, New York/Dover</ref> The stance that a belief in \"God\" denotes no verifiable hypothesis is sometimes referred to as [[Ignosticism|igtheism]] (for example, by [[Paul Kurtz]]).<ref>{{cite book |title= The New Skepticism: Inquiry and Reliable Knowledge |page=194 |author=Kurtz, Paul |authorlink=Paul Kurtz |year=1992 |publisher=Prometheus |location =Buffalo, NY |isbn= 978-0-87975-766-3}}</ref> In later years Ayer reiterated that he did not believe in God<ref>\"I do not believe in God. It seems to me that theists of all kinds have very largely failed to make their concept of a deity intelligible; and to the extent that they have made it intelligible, they have given us no reason to think that anything answers to it.\" Ayer, A.J. (1966). \"What I Believe,\" ''Humanist'', Vol.81 (8) August, p. 226.</ref> and began to refer to himself as an atheist.<ref>\"I trust that my remaining an atheist will allay the anxieties of my fellow supporters of the [[British Humanist Association]], the [[Rationalist Press Association]] and the [[South Place Ethical Society]].\" (Ayer 1989, p. 12)</ref> He followed in the footsteps of [[Bertrand Russell]] by debating with the Jesuit scholar [[Frederick Copleston]] on the topic of religion.\n\nAyer's version of emotivism divides \"the ordinary system of ethics\" into four classes:\n#\"Propositions that express definitions of ethical terms, or judgements about the legitimacy or possibility of certain definitions\"\n#\"Propositions describing the phenomena of moral experience, and their causes\"\n#\"Exhortations to moral virtue\"\n#\"Actual ethical judgments\"<ref>Ayer, ''Language'', 103</ref>\nHe focuses on propositions of the first class\u2014moral judgments\u2014saying that those of the second class belong to science, those of the third are mere commands, and those of the fourth (which are considered in [[normative ethics]] as opposed to [[meta-ethics]]) are too concrete for ethical philosophy.\n\nAyer argues that moral judgments cannot be translated into non-ethical, empirical terms and thus cannot be verified; in this he agrees with [[ethical intuitionism|ethical intuitionists]]. But he differs from intuitionists by discarding appeals to intuition of non-empirical moral truths as \"worthless\" <ref>Ayer, ''Language'', 106</ref> since the intuition of one person often contradicts that of another. Instead, Ayer concludes that ethical concepts are \"mere pseudo-concepts\":\n\n{{quote|The presence of an ethical symbol in a proposition adds nothing to its factual content. Thus if I say to someone, \"You acted wrongly in stealing that money,\" I am not stating anything more than if I had simply said, \"You stole that money.\" In adding that this action is wrong I am not making any further statement about it. I am simply evincing my moral disapproval of it. It is as if I had said, \"You stole that money,\" in a peculiar tone of horror, or written it with the addition of some special exclamation marks. \u2026 If now I generalise my previous statement and say, \"Stealing money is wrong,\" I produce a sentence that has no factual meaning\u2014that is, expresses no proposition that can be either true or false. \u2026 I am merely expressing certain moral sentiments.<ref>Ayer, ''Language'', 107</ref>}}\n\nBetween 1945 and 1947, together with Russell and [[George Orwell]], he contributed a series of articles to ''[[Polemic (magazine)|Polemic]]'', a short-lived British \"Magazine of Philosophy, Psychology, and Aesthetics\" edited by the ex-Communist [[Humphrey Slater]].<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/arthistorical-notes-where-are-the-hirsts-of-the-1930s-now-1184514.html |title= Where are the Hirsts of the 1930s now? |work=The Independent |location =London |date=13 November 1998 |author=Buckman, David}}</ref><ref name=\"Absent Minds\">{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=j-OjW2JvVfAC&pg=PA396&vq=ayer&cad=1_1#PPA396,M1 |title= Absent Minds: Intellectuals in Britain |author= Collini, Stefan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn= 978-0-19-929105-2}}</ref>\n\nAyer was closely associated with the British [[secular humanism|humanist]] movement. He was an Honorary Associate of the [[Rationalist Press Association]] from 1947 until his death.

In 1968 he edited ''The Humanist Outlook'', a collection of essays on the meaning of humanism. In addition he was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |title=Humanist Manifesto II |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=4 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |archivedate=20 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nHe taught or lectured several times in the United States, including serving as a visiting professor at [[Bard College]] in the fall of 1987. At a party that same year held by fashion designer [[Fernando Sanchez]], Ayer, then 77, confronted [[Mike Tyson]] who was forcing himself upon the (then) little-known model [[Naomi Campbell]]. When Ayer demanded that Tyson stop, the boxer said: \"Do you know who the fuck I am? I'm the heavyweight champion of the world,\" to which Ayer replied: \"And I am the former [[Wykeham Professor of Logic]]. We are both pre-eminent in our field. I suggest that we talk about this like rational men\". Ayer and Tyson then began to talk, while Naomi Campbell slipped out.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=D26bGPQw0GsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A.+J.+Ayer&ei=ECIPTKLSL4WyzgSbpJiaCg&cd=1#v=onepage&q=naomi&f=false Rogers (1999), p. 344].</ref>\n\n=== Near-death experience ===\nIn 1988, shortly before his death, Ayer wrote an article entitled, \"What I saw when I was dead\",<ref>{{cite web|last=Ayer |first=A. J. |url=http://www.philosopher.eu/others-writings/a-j-ayer-what-i-saw-when-i-was-dead/ |title=What I Saw When I Was Dead |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> describing an unusual [[near-death experience]]. Of the experience, Ayer first said that it \"slightly weakened my conviction that my genuine death ... will be the end of me, though I continue to hope that it will be.\"<ref>{{citation|last=Lougrhan |first=Gerry |title=Can There Be Life After Life? Ask the Atheist! |date=18 March 2001 }}</ref> However, a few days later he revised this, saying \"what I should have said is that my experiences have weakened, not my belief that there is no life after death, but my inflexible attitude towards that belief\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Dennett |first=Daniel C. |url=http://edge.org/3rd_culture/dennett06/dennett06_index.html |title=THANK GOODNESS! |publisher=Edge.org |date=3 November 2006 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001 Dr Jeremy George, the attending physician, claimed that Ayer had confided to him: \"I saw a Divine Being. I'm afraid I'm going to have to revise all my books and opinions.\" Ayer's son Nick, however, said that he had never mentioned this to him though he did find his father's words to be extraordinary, and said he had long felt there was something possibly suspect about his father's version of his near death experience.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cash |first=William |url=http://variousenthusiasms.wordpress.com/2009/04/28/did-atheist-philosopher-see-god-when-he-died-by-william-cash/ |title=Did atheist philosopher see God when he 'died'? |publisher=National Post |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\nAyer is best known for popularising the [[verification principle]], in particular through his presentation of it in ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936). The principle was at the time at the heart of the debates of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]] which Ayer visited as a young guest. Others, including the leading light of the circle, [[Moritz Schlick]], were already offering their own papers on the issue.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schlick |first=Moritz |url=http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/moritz.htm |title=Unanswerable Questions |publisher=The Philosopher |volume=XIII |year=1935 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> Ayer's own formulation was that a sentence can only be meaningful if it has verifiable [[empirical]] import, otherwise it is either \"[[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytical]]\" if [[Tautology (logic)|tautologous]], or \"metaphysical\" (i.e. meaningless, or \"literally senseless\"). He started to work on the book at the age of 23<ref>page ix, \"Language, Truth and Logic\", Penguin, 2001</ref> and it was published when he was 26. Ayer's philosophical ideas were deeply influenced by those of the Vienna Circle and [[David Hume]]. His clear, vibrant and polemical exposition of them makes ''Language, Truth and Logic'' essential reading on the tenets of [[logical empiricism]]\u2013 the book is regarded as a classic of 20th century [[analytic philosophy]], and is widely read in philosophy courses around the world. In it, Ayer also proposed that the distinction between a conscious man and an unconscious machine resolves itself into a distinction between 'different types of perceptible behaviour',<ref>page 140, ''Language, Truth and Logic'', Penguin, 2001</ref> an argument which anticipates the [[Turing test]] published in 1950 to test a machine's capability to demonstrate intelligence.\n\nAyer wrote two books on the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], ''Russell and Moore: The Analytic Heritage'' (1971) and ''Russell'' (1972). He also wrote an introductory book on the philosophy of [[David Hume]] and a short biography of [[Voltaire]].\n\nAyer was a strong critic of the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]]. As a logical positivist Ayer was in conflict with Heidegger's proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence. These he felt were completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis. This sort of philosophy was an unfortunate strain in modern thought. He considered Heidegger to be the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed to be entirely useless.\n\nIn 1972\u20131973 Ayer gave the [[Gifford Lectures]] at [[University of St Andrews]], later published as ''The Central Questions of Philosophy''. In the preface to the book, he defends his selection to hold the lectureship on the basis that Lord Gifford wished to promote \"[[natural theology]]\", in the widest sense of that term', and that non-believers are allowed to give the lectures if they are \"able reverent men, true thinkers, sincere lovers of and earnest inquirers after truth\".<ref>''The Central Questions of Philosophy'', p. ix</ref> He still believed in the viewpoint he shared with the logical positivists: that large parts of what was traditionally called \"philosophy\"\u2013 including the whole of [[metaphysics]], theology and [[aesthetics]]\u2013 were not matters that could be judged as being true or false and that it was thus meaningless to discuss them.\n\nIn ''The Concept of a Person and Other Essays'' (1963), Ayer heavily criticized [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[private language argument]].\n\nAyer's sense-data theory in ''Foundations of Empirical Knowledge'' was famously criticised by fellow Oxonian [[J. L. Austin]] in ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Austin)|Sense and Sensibilia]]'', a landmark 1950s work of common language philosophy. Ayer responded to this in the essay \"Has Austin Refuted the Sense-data Theory?\", which can be found in his ''Metaphysics and Common Sense'' (1969).\n\n== Awards ==\nHe was awarded a Knighthood as [[Knight Bachelor]] in the London Gazette on 1 January 1970.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=44999 |supp=y|page=1|date=30 December 1969}}</ref>\n\n== Selected publications ==\n* 1936, ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'', London: Gollancz.

The famous philosopher [[Simone Weil]] was Weil's only sibling. He studied in Paris, [[Rome]] and [[G\u00f6ttingen]] and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] in 1928. While in Germany, Weil befriended [[Carl Ludwig Siegel]]. Starting in 1930, he spent two academic years at [[Aligarh Muslim University]]. Aside from mathematics, Weil held lifelong interests in classical Greek and Latin literature, in [[Hinduism]] and [[Sanskrit literature]]: he taught himself Sanskrit in 1920.<ref name =\"Aczel\">Amir D.

He married \u00c9veline in 1937.\n\nWeil was in [[Finland]] when [[World War II]] broke out; he had been traveling in Scandinavia since April 1939. His wife \u00c9veline returned to France without him. Weil was mistakenly arrested in Finland at the outbreak of the [[Winter War]] on suspicion of spying; however, accounts of his life having been in danger were shown to be exaggerated.<ref>Osmo Pekonen: ''L'affaire Weil \u00e0 Helsinki en 1939'', Gazette des math\u00e9maticiens 52 (avril 1992), pp. 13\u201420. With an afterword by Andr\u00e9 Weil.</ref> Weil returned to France via Sweden and the United Kingdom, and was detained at [[Le Havre]] in January 1940. He was charged with failure to report for duty, and was imprisoned in Le Havre and then [[Rouen]]. It was in the military prison in Bonne-Nouvelle, a district of Rouen, from February to May, that Weil completed the work that made his reputation. He was tried on 3 May 1940. Sentenced to five years, he requested to be attached to a military unit instead, and was given the chance to join a regiment in [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]]. After the [[fall of France]], he met up with his family in Marseille, where he arrived by sea. He then went to [[Clermont-Ferrand]], where he managed to join his wife \u00c9veline, who had been living in German-occupied France.\n\nIn January 1941, Weil and his family sailed from [[Marseille]] to New York. He spent the remainder of the war in the United States, where he was supported by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]]. For two years, he taught undergraduate mathematics at [[Lehigh University]], where he was unappreciated, overworked and poorly paid, although he didn't have to worry about being drafted, unlike his American students. But, he hated Lehigh very much for their heavy teaching workload and he swore that he would never talk about \"Lehigh\" any more.{{citation needed|date=May 2015|http://www.landsburg.com/weil.htm=}} He quit the job at Lehigh, and then he moved to Brazil and taught at the [[Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo]] from  1945 to 1947, where he worked with [[Oscar Zariski]]. He then returned to the United States and taught at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1947 to 1958, before moving to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], where he would spend the remainder of his career.

This began in his doctoral work leading to the [[Mordell\u2013Weil theorem]] (1928, and shortly applied in [[Siegel's theorem on integral points]]).<ref>A.

Both aspects of Weil's work have steadily developed into substantial theories.\n\nAmong his major accomplishments were the 1940s proof of the [[Weil conjectures|Riemann hypothesis for zeta-functions]] of curves over finite fields,<ref>{{Citation | last1=Weil | first1=Andr\u00e9 | author1-link=Andr\u00e9 Weil | title=Numbers of solutions of equations in finite fields | url=http://www.ams.org/bull/1949-55-05/S0002-9904-1949-09219-4/home.html | doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1949-09219-4  | mr=0029393 | year=1949 | journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9904 | volume=55 | pages=497\u2013508 | issue=5}} Reprinted in Oeuvres Scientifiques/Collected Papers by Andr\u00e9 Weil {{isbn|0-387-90330-5}}</ref> and his subsequent laying of proper [[foundations for algebraic geometry]] to support that result (from 1942 to 1946, most intensively).

Eventually the adelic approach became basic in [[automorphic representation]] theory.

Taniyama\u2013Weil conjecture) based on a roughly formulated question of Taniyama at the 1955 Nikk\u014d conference. His attitude towards conjectures was that one should not dignify a guess as a conjecture lightly, and in the Taniyama case, the evidence was only there after extensive computational work carried out from the late 1960s.<ref>Lang, S. \"Some History of the Shimura-Taniyama Conjecture.\" Not.

In the Iliad, the names \"Achaeans\" and \"Danaans\" and \"Argives\" are used synonymously in the sense of Panhellenes = \"all Hellenes\" = \"all Greeks.\"\"}}</ref> In the historical period, the '''Achaeans''' were the inhabitants of the region of [[Achaea (ancient region)#Name|Achaea]], a region in the north-central part of the [[Peloponnese]]. The city-states of this region later formed a confederation known as the [[Achaean League]], which was influential during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.\n\n==Homeric versus later use==\nThe Homeric \"long-haired Achaeans\" would have been a part of the [[Mycenaean civilization]] that dominated Greece from circa 1600 BC until 1100 BC. Later, by the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods, the term \"Achaeans\" referred to inhabitants of the much smaller region of [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaea]]. [[Herodotus]] identified the [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaeans]] of the northern [[Peloponnese]] as descendants of the earlier, Homeric Achaeans. According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], writing in the 2nd century CE, the term \"Achaean\" was originally given to those Greeks inhabiting the [[Argolis]] and [[Laconia]].<ref>Pausanias. ''Description of Greece'', VII.1.</ref>\n\nPausanias and Herodotus both recount the legend that the Achaeans were forced from their homelands by the [[Dorians]], during the legendary [[Dorian invasion]] of the Peloponnese. They then moved into the region later called Achaea.\n\nA scholarly consensus has not yet been reached on the origin of the historic Achaeans relative to the Homeric Achaeans and is still hotly debated. Former emphasis on presumed race, such as John A. Scott's article about the blond locks of the Achaeans as compared to the dark locks of \"Mediterranean\" [[Poseidon]],<ref>{{harvnb|Scott|1925|pp=366\u2013367}}.</ref> on the basis of hints in Homer, has been rejected by some. The contrasting belief that \"Achaeans\", as understood through Homer, is \"a name without a country\", an ''ethnos'' created in the [[Epic Cycle|Epic tradition]],<ref>As William K. Prentice expressed this long-standing skepticism of a genuine Achaean ethnicity in the distant past, at the outset of his article \"The Achaeans\" (see {{harvnb|Prentice|1929|p=206}}).</ref> has modern supporters among those who conclude that \"Achaeans\" were redefined in the 5th century BC, as contemporary speakers of [[Aeolic Greek]].\n\n[[Karl Beloch]] suggested there was no Dorian invasion, but rather that the Peloponnesian Dorians were the Achaeans.<ref>{{harvnb|Beloch|1893|loc=Volume I, pp. 88 (Note #1) and 92}}.</ref> [[Eduard Meyer]], disagreeing with Beloch, instead put forth the suggestion that the real-life Achaeans were mainland pre-Dorian Greeks.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|1884\u20131902|loc=Volume II, Part 1: Die Zeit der \u00e4gyptischen Gro\u00dfmacht \u2013  [http://www.zeno.org/Geschichte/M/Meyer,+Eduard/Geschichte+des+Altertums/Zweiter+Band.+Erste+Abteilung%3A+Die+Zeit+der+%C3%A4gyptischen+Gro%C3%9Fmacht/V.+Das+griechische+Festland+und+die+mykenische+Kultur V. Das griechische Festland und die mykenische Kultur]}}.</ref> His conclusion is based on his research on the similarity between the languages of the Achaeans and pre-historic Arcadians. William Prentice disagreed with both, noting archeological evidence suggests the Achaeans instead migrated from \"southern [[Asia Minor]] to Greece, probably settling first in lower [[Ancient Thessaly|Thessaly]]\" probably prior to 2000 BC.<ref>{{harvnb|Prentice|1929|pp=206\u2013218}}.</ref>\n\n==Hittite documents==\n[[Emil Forrer]], a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] Hittitologist who worked on the Boghazk\u00f6y tablets in [[Berlin]], said the Achaeans of pre-Homeric Greece were directly associated with the term \"Land of Ahhiyawa\" mentioned in the Hittite texts.<ref name=\"G\u00fcterbock\">{{harvnb|G\u00fcterbock|1984|p=114}}.</ref> His conclusions at the time were challenged by other Hittitologists (i.e. [[Johannes Friedrich (linguist)|Johannes Friedrich]] in 1927 and [[Albrecht Goetze|Albrecht G\u00f6tze]] in 1930), as well as by Ferdinand Sommer, who published his ''Die Ahhijava-Urkunden'' (\"The Ahhiyawa Documents\") in 1932.<ref name=\"G\u00fcterbock\"/>\n[[File:Map Hittite rule en.svg|thumb|175px|left|Map showing the Hittite Empire, Ahhiyawa (Achaeans) and Wilusa (Troy) in c. 1300 BC.]]\n\nSome [[Hittite language|Hittite]] texts mention a nation lying to the west called '''''Ahhiyawa'''''.<ref>{{harvnb|Huxley|1960|p=22}}; {{harvnb|G\u00fcterbock|1983|pp=133\u2013138}}; {{harvnb|Mellink|1983|pp=138\u2013141}}.</ref> In the earliest reference to this land, a letter outlining the treaty violations of the Hittite vassal [[Madduwatta]],<ref>[http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations/historical%2fCTH147_Madduwatta.html Translation of the Sins of Madduwatta]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228042849/http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations%2Fhistorical%2FCTH147_Madduwatta.html |date=February 28, 2007 }}</ref> it is called ''Ahhiya''. Another important example is the ''[[Tawagalawa Letter]]'' written by an unnamed [[Hittites|Hittite]] king (most probably [[Hattusili III]]) of the empire period (14th\u201313th century BC) to the king of ''Ahhiyawa'', treating him as an equal and implying [[Miletus]] (''Millawanda'') was under his control.<ref>[http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations/historical%2fPiyama-radu+Letter.html Translation of the Tawagalawa Letter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021192729/http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations%2Fhistorical%2FPiyama-radu+Letter.html |date=2013-10-21 }}</ref> It also refers to an earlier \"''Wilusa'' episode\" involving hostility on the part of ''Ahhiyawa''. Ahhiya(wa) has been identified with the Achaeans of the [[Trojan War]] and the city of [[Wilusa]] with the legendary city of [[Troy]] (note the similarity with early Greek {{lang|grc|\u03dc\u03af\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}} ''Wilion'', later {{lang|grc|\u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}} ''Ilion'', the name of the [[acropolis]] of Troy). The exact relationship of the term ''Ahhiyawa'' to the Achaeans beyond a similarity in pronunciation was hotly debated by scholars, even following the discovery that Mycenaean [[Linear B]] is an early form of Greek; the earlier debate was summed up in 1984 by [[Hans G. G\u00fcterbock]] of the [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute]].<ref>{{harvnb|G\u00fcterbock|1984|pp=114\u2013122}}.</ref> More recent research based on new readings and interpretations of the Hittite texts, as well as of the material evidence for Mycenaean contacts with the Anatolian mainland, came to the conclusion that ''Ahhiyawa'' referred to the Mycenaean world, or at least to a part of it.<ref>{{harvnb|Windle|2004|pp=121\u2013122}}; {{harvnb|Bryce|1999|p=60}}.</ref>\n\n==Egyptian sources==\n[[File:Path3959-83.png|thumb|175px|right|Map of Mycenaean cultural areas, 1400-1100 BC (unearthed sites in red dots).]]\nIt has been proposed that ''Ekwesh'' of the Egyptian records may relate to ''Achaea'' (compared to Hittite ''Ahhiyawa''), whereas ''[[Denyen]]'' and ''Tanaju'' may relate to Classical Greek ''Danaoi''.<ref name=\"Kelder125\u2013126\">{{harvnb|Kelder|2010|pp=125\u2013126}}.</ref> The earliest textual reference to the Mycenaean world is in the Annals of [[Thutmosis III]] (ca. 1479\u20131425 BC), which refers to messengers from the king of the Tanaju, circa 1437 BC, offering greeting gifts to the Egyptian king, in order to initiate diplomatic relations, when the latter campaigned in Syria.<ref name=\"Kelder125\u2013126\"/> Tanaju is also listed in an inscription at the [[Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III]]. The latter ruled Egypt in circa 1382\u20131344 BC. Moreover, a list of the cities and regions of the Tanaju is also mentioned in this inscription; among the cities listed are Mycenae, [[Nauplion]], [[Kythera]], [[Messenia]] and the Thebaid (region of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]).<ref name=\"Kelder125\u2013126\"/>\n\nDuring the 5th year of Pharaoh [[Merneptah]], a confederation of [[Libya]]n and northern peoples is supposed to have attacked the western delta. Included amongst the ethnic names of the repulsed invaders is the [[Ekwesh]] or Eqwesh, whom some have seen as Achaeans, although Egyptian texts specifically mention these Ekwesh to be [[circumcised]] (which does not seem to have been a general practice in the Aegean at the time). Homer mentions an Achaean attack upon the delta, and [[Menelaus]] speaks of the same in Book IV of the ''Odyssey'' to [[Telemachus]] when he recounts his own return home from the [[Trojan War]]. Later Greek myths also say Helen had spent the time of the Trojan War in [[Egypt]], and not at [[Troy]], and that after Troy the [[Greeks]] went there to recover her.\n\n==Greek mythology==\nIn [[Greek mythology]], the perceived cultural divisions among the Hellenes were represented as legendary lines of descent that identified kinship groups, with each line being derived from an [[eponymy|eponymous]] ancestor. Each of the Greek ''[[Ethnic group|ethne]]'' were said to be named in honor of their respective ancestors: [[Achaeus (son of Xuthus)|Achaeus]] of the Achaeans, [[Danaus]] of the Danaans, [[Cadmus]] of the Cadmeans ([[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|the Thebans]]), [[Hellen]] of the Hellenes (not to be confused with [[Helen of Troy]]), [[Aeolus]] of the [[Aeolians]], [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]] of the [[Ionians]], and [[Dorus]] of the [[Dorians]].\n\nCadmus from [[Phoenicia]], Danaus from [[Egypt]], and Pelops from [[Anatolia]] each gained a foothold in mainland Greece and were assimilated and Hellenized. Hellen, Graikos, Magnes, and Macedon were sons of [[Deucalion]] and [[Pyrrha]], the only people who survived the [[Ancient Greek flood myths|Great Flood]];<ref>Hesiod. ''Catalogue of Women'', Fragments.</ref> the ''ethne'' were said to have originally been named ''Graikoi'' after the elder son but later renamed ''Hellenes'' after Hellen who was proved to be the strongest.<ref>Aristotle.

He was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1950.\n\n== Early years ==\nSelberg was born in [[Langesund]], Norway, the son of teacher Anna Kristina Selberg and mathematician [[Ole Michael Ludvigsen Selberg]]. Two of his brothers also went on to become mathematicians as well, and the remaining one became a professor of engineering. \n<!-- There seems to be no source for the following anecdote, and the reference given does not mention Selberg:\nHis first result came at age 14 when he found[[Johann Bernoulli]]'s  remarkable 1697 formula\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n^{-n} = \\int_0^1 x^{-x} dx\\quad\\quad(=1.291285997...)</math>\nwhich he published as a problem in the book ''Problems and Theorems in Analysis'' (part I, problem 160) by [[P\u00f3lya]] and [[G\u00e1bor Szeg\u00f6]].\n-->\nWhile he was still at school he was influenced by the work of [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] and he found an exact analytical formula for the [[Partition (number theory)#Partition function|partition function]] as suggested by the works of Ramanujan; however, this result was first published by [[Hans Rademacher]]. During the war he fought against the German invasion of Norway, and was imprisoned several times. \nHe studied at the [[University of Oslo]] and completed his [[Ph.D.]] in 1943.\n\n== World War II ==\nDuring [[World War II]], Selberg worked in isolation due to the [[German occupation of Norway]]. After the war his accomplishments became known, including a proof that a positive proportion of the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] lie on the line <math>\\Re(s)=\\tfrac{1}{2}</math>. \n \nAfter the war, he turned to [[sieve theory]], a previously neglected topic which Selberg's work brought into prominence. In a 1947 paper he introduced the [[Selberg sieve]], a method well adapted in particular to providing auxiliary upper bounds, and which contributed to [[Chen's theorem]], among other important results.\n\nIn 1948 Selberg submitted two papers in ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'' in which he proved by elementary means the theorems for [[primes in arithmetic progression]] and the [[prime number theorem|density of primes]].<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=1969455|\n title=An Elementary Proof of the Prime-Number Theorem| url=https://www.math.lsu.edu/~mahlburg/teaching/handouts/2014-7230/Selberg-ElemPNT1949.pdf| \n first=Atle|\n last=Selberg|\n journal=Annals of Mathematics|\n year=April 1949|\n pages=305\u2013313|\nvolume=50|\ndoi=10.2307/1969455\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal|jstor= 1969454| \n title=An Elementary Proof of Dirichlet's Theorem About Primes in Arithmetic Progression|\n first=Atle|\n last=Selbert|\n journal=Annals of Mathematics|\n year=April 1949|\n pages=297\u2013304|\nvolume=50|\ndoi=10.2307/1969454 }}</ref> This challenged the widely held view of his time that certain theorems are only obtainable with the advanced methods of [[complex analysis]].

During the 1950s he worked on introducing [[spectral theory]] into [[number theory]], culminating in his development of the [[Selberg trace formula]], the most famous and influential of his results. In its simplest form, this establishes a duality between the lengths of [[closed geodesic]]s on a [[compact Riemann surface]] and the [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[Laplace-Beltrami operator|Laplacian]], which is analogous to the duality between the [[prime number]]s and the zeros of the zeta function.\n\nHe was awarded the 1986 [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]]. He was also awarded an honorary [[Abel Prize]] in 2002, its founding year, before the awarding of the regular prizes began.\n\nSelberg received many distinctions for his work in addition to the [[Fields Medal]], the [[Wolf Prize]] and the [[Gunnerus Medal]]. He was elected to the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]], the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].\n\nIn 1972 he was awarded an [[honorary degree]], doctor philos. honoris causa, at the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]], later part of [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntnu.edu/phd/honorary-doctors|title=Honorary doctors at NTNU|publisher=Norwegian University of Science and Technology}}</ref>\n\nSelberg had two children, Ingrid Selberg and Lars Selberg.

According to another tradition, tragedy was established in Athens in the late 530s BC, but that may simply reflect an absence of records. Major innovations in dramatic form, credited to Aeschylus by Aristotle and the anonymous source ''The Life of Aeschylus'', may be exaggerations and should be viewed with caution (Martin Cropp (2006), \"Lost Tragedies: A Survey\" in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', pp. 272\u201374)</ref>\n\nOnly seven of his estimated seventy to ninety plays have survived, and there is a long-standing [[Prometheus Bound#Debate over authenticity|debate regarding his authorship of one of these plays]], ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', which some believe his son [[Euphorion (playwright)|Euphorion]] actually wrote.

The significance of war in Ancient Greek culture was so great that Aeschylus' epitaph commemorates his participation in the Greek victory at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] while making no mention of his success as a playwright. Despite this, Aeschylus's work \u2013 particularly the ''Oresteia'' ''\u2013'' is generally acclaimed by modern critics and scholars.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Aeschylus Bust.jpg|thumb|Bust of Aeschylus at [[North Carolina Museum of Art]]]]\n\nAeschylus was born in c.&nbsp;525 BC in [[Eleusis]], a small town about 27&nbsp;kilometers northwest of [[Athens]], which is nestled in the fertile valleys of western [[Attica]],<ref name=\"S33\">{{harvnb |Sommerstein |1996 |p=33}}{{citation not found}}</ref> though the date is most likely based on counting back forty years from his first victory in the Great Dionysia.

Cleisthenes' reforms included a system of registration that emphasized the importance of the [[deme]] over family tradition. In the last decade of the 6th century, Aeschylus and his family were living in the deme of [[Eleusis]].<ref name=\"Kopff 1997 pp.1-472\">Kopff 1997 pp. 1\u2013472</ref>\n\nThe [[Persian Wars]] played a large role in the playwright's life and career. In 490&nbsp;BC, Aeschylus and his brother [[Cynegeirus]] fought to defend Athens against the invading army of [[Darius I of Persia]] at the [[Battle of Marathon]].<ref name=S33/> The Athenians emerged triumphant, a victory celebrated across the city-states of Greece.<ref name=S33/> Cynegeirus, however, died in the battle, receiving a mortal wound while trying to prevent a Persian ship retreating from the shore, for which his countrymen extolled him as a hero.<ref name=S33/><ref name=\"Kopff 1997 pp.1-472\"/>\n\nIn 480 BC, Aeschylus was called into military service again, this time against [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes&nbsp;I]]'s invading forces at the [[Battle of Salamis]], and perhaps, too, at the [[Battle of Plataea]] in 479 BC.<ref name=S33/> [[Ion of Chios]] was a witness for Aeschylus's war record and his contribution in Salamis.<ref name=\"Kopff 1997 pp.1-472\" /> Salamis holds a prominent place in ''The Persians'', his oldest surviving [[Play (theatre)|play]], which was performed in 472 BC and won first prize at the [[Dionysia]].<ref name=\"S34\">{{harvnb |Sommerstein |1996 |p=34}}</ref>\n\nAeschylus was one of many Greeks who were initiated into the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], an ancient cult of [[Demeter]] based in his home town of Eleusis.<ref>{{harvnb |Martin |2000 |loc=\u00a710.1}}</ref> Initiates gained secret knowledge through these rites, likely concerning the afterlife.

[[Heracleides of Pontus]] asserts that the audience tried to stone Aeschylus. He then took refuge at the altar in the orchestra of the Theater of Dionysus. At his trial, he pleaded ignorance. He was acquitted, with the jury sympathetic to the military service of Aeschylus and his brothers during the Persian Wars. According to the 2nd-century AD author Aelian, Aeschylus's younger brother [[Ameinias of Athens|Ameinias]] helped to acquit Aeschylus by showing the jury the stump of the hand that he lost at Salamis, where he was voted bravest warrior.

With the exception of this last play&nbsp;\u2013 the success of which is uncertain&nbsp;\u2013 all of Aeschylus's [[Extant literature|extant]] tragedies are known to have won first prize at the City Dionysia.\n\nThe Alexandrian ''Life of Aeschylus'' claims that he won the first prize at the City Dionysia thirteen times. This compares favorably with Sophocles' reported eighteen victories (with a substantially larger catalogue, at an estimated 120 plays), and dwarfs the five victories of Euripides, who is thought to have written roughly 90 plays.\n\n===Trilogies===\nOne hallmark of Aeschylean [[dramaturgy]] appears to have been his tendency to write connected trilogies, in which each play serves as a chapter in a continuous dramatic narrative.<ref>{{harvnb |Sommerstein |1996}}</ref> ''[[The Oresteia]]'' is the only extant example of this type of connected trilogy, but there is evidence that Aeschylus often wrote such trilogies. The comic satyr plays that follow his trilogies also drew upon stories derived from myths.\n\nFor example, the ''Oresteia'''s satyr play ''[[Proteus]]'' treated the story of Menelaus'  detour in Egypt on his way home from the [[Trojan War]]. Based on the evidence provided by a catalogue of Aeschylean play titles, [[scholia]], and play fragments recorded by later authors, it is assumed that three other of his extant plays were components of connected trilogies: ''Seven against Thebes'' being the final play in an Oedipus trilogy, and ''The Suppliants'' and ''Prometheus Bound'' each being the first play in a Danaid trilogy and Prometheus trilogy, respectively (see below). Scholars have moreover suggested several completely lost trilogies derived from known play titles. A number of these trilogies treated myths surrounding the Trojan War. One, collectively called the ''[[Achilleis (trilogy)|Achilleis]]'', comprised the titles ''Myrmidons'', ''Nereids'' and ''Phrygians'' (alternately, ''The Ransoming of Hector'').\n\nAnother trilogy apparently recounts the entry of the Trojan ally [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]] into the war, and his death at the hands of Achilles (''Memnon'' and ''The Weighing of Souls'' being two components of the trilogy); ''The Award of the Arms'', ''The Phrygian Women'', and ''The Salaminian Women'' suggest a trilogy about the madness and subsequent suicide of the Greek hero [[Ajax the great|Ajax]]; Aeschylus also seems to have written about [[Odysseus]]' return to Ithaca after the war (including his killing of his wife [[Penelope]]'s suitors and its consequences) in a trilogy consisting of ''The Soul-raisers'', ''Penelope'' and ''The Bone-gatherers''. Other suggested trilogies touched on the myth of Jason and the Argonauts (''Arg\u00f4'', ''Lemnian Women'', ''Hypsipyl\u00ea''); the life of Perseus (''The Net-draggers'', ''Polydekt\u00eas'', ''Phorkides''); the birth and exploits of Dionysus (''Semele'', ''Bacchae'', ''Pentheus''); and the aftermath of the war portrayed in ''Seven against Thebes'' (''Eleusinians'', ''Argives'' (or ''Argive Women''), ''Sons of the Seven'').<ref>Sommerstein 2002, 34.</ref>\n\n==Surviving plays==\n===''The Persians''===\n{{Main|The Persians}}\n[[File:Dariuslarge.jpg|thumb|right|''The Ghost of Darius Appearing to Atossa'', drawing by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]].]]\nThe earliest of his plays to survive is ''The Persians'' (''Persai''), performed in 472 BC and based on experiences in Aeschylus's own life, specifically the [[Battle of Salamis]].<ref name=\"F244\">{{harvnb |Freeman |1999 |p=244}}</ref> It is unique among surviving Greek tragedies in that it describes a recent historical event.<ref name=F243/> ''The Persians'' focuses on the popular Greek theme of ''[[hubris]]'' by blaming Persia's loss on the pride of its king.<ref name=F244/>\n\nIt opens with the arrival of a messenger in [[Susa]], the Persian capital, bearing news of the catastrophic Persian defeat at Salamis to [[Atossa]], the mother of the Persian King [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]].

It is, he says, the result of Xerxes' hubris in building a bridge across the [[Hellespont]], an action which angered the gods.

In the play, the [[Danaids]], the fifty daughters of [[Danaus]], founder of [[Argos]], flee a forced marriage to their cousins in Egypt. They turn to King [[Pelasgus]] of Argos for protection, but Pelasgus refuses until the people of Argos weigh in on the decision, a distinctly democratic move on the part of the king.

A plausible reconstruction of the trilogy's last two-thirds runs thus:<ref>See (e.g.) Sommerstein 1996, 141\u201351; Turner 2001, 36\u201339.</ref> In ''The Egyptians'', the Argive-Egyptian war threatened in the first play has transpired. During the course of the war, King Pelasgus has been killed, and Danaus rules Argos. He negotiates a peace settlement with Aegyptus, as a condition of which, his fifty daughters will marry the fifty sons of Aegyptus. Danaus secretly informs his daughters of an oracle predicting that one of his sons-in-law would kill him; he therefore orders the Danaids to murder their husbands on their wedding night. His daughters agree. ''The Danaids'' would open the day after the wedding.<ref name=\"Sommerstein 2002, 89\">Sommerstein 2002, 89.</ref>\n\nIn short order, it is revealed that forty-nine of the Danaids killed their husbands as ordered; Hypermnestra, however, loved her husband Lynceus, and thus spared his life and helped him to escape. Angered by his daughter's disobedience, Danaus orders her imprisonment and, possibly, her execution. In the trilogy's climax and d\u00e9nouement, Lynceus reveals himself to Danaus, and kills him (thus fulfilling the oracle). He and Hypermnestra will establish a ruling dynasty in Argos. The other forty-nine Danaids are absolved of their murderous crime, and married off to unspecified Argive men. The satyr play following this trilogy was titled ''Amymone'', after one of the Danaids.<ref name=\"Sommerstein 2002, 89\"/>\n\n===''The Oresteia''===\n{{Main|Oresteia}}\nThe only complete [[trilogy]] of Greek plays by any playwright still extant (save a few missing lines in several spots) is the ''[[Oresteia]]'' (458 BC), although the satyr play that originally followed it, ''[[Proteus]]'', is lost except for some fragments.<ref name=F244/> The trilogy consists of ''[[The Oresteia#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]]'', ''[[The Oresteia#The Libation Bearers|The Libation Bearers]]'' (''Choephoroi''), and ''[[The Oresteia#The Eumenides|The Eumenides]]''.<ref name=F244246/> Together, these plays tell the bloody story of the family of [[Agamemnon]], King of [[Argos]].\n\n====''Agamemnon''====\n[[Image:G\u00e9rin Clytemnestre h\u00e9sitant avant de frapper Agamemnon endormi Louvre 5185.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Murder of Agamemnon'' by [[Pierre-Narcisse Gu\u00e9rin]] (1817)]]\n\nAeschylus begins in Greece describing the return of King [[Agamemnon]] from his victory in the [[Trojan War]], from the perspective of the towns people (the Chorus) and his wife, [[Clytemnestra]]. However, dark foreshadowings build to the death of the king at the hands of his wife, who was angry at his sacrifice of their daughter [[Iphigenia]], who was killed so that the gods would restore the winds and allow the Greek fleet to sail to Troy. She was also unhappy at his keeping of the Trojan prophetess [[Cassandra]] as a concubine. Cassandra foretells of the murder of Agamemnon, and of herself, to the assembled townsfolk, who are horrified. She then enters the palace knowing that she cannot avoid her fate. The ending of the play includes a prediction of the return of [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]], son of Agamemnon, who will seek to avenge his father.<ref name=F244246/>''\n\n====''The Libation Bearers''====\n''The Libation Bearers'' continues the tale, opening with Orestes's arrival at Agamemnon's tomb. At the tomb, Electra meets [[Orestes]], who has returned from exile in [[Phocis]], and they plan revenge upon Clytemnestra and her lover [[Aegisthus]].  Clytemnestra's account of a nightmare in which she gives birth to a snake is recounted by the chorus; and this leads her to order [[Electra]], her daughter, to pour libations on Agamemnon's tomb (with the assistance of libation bearers) in hope of making amends. Orestes enters the palace pretending to bear news of his own death, and when Clytemnestra calls in Aegisthus to share in the news, Orestes kills them both. Orestes is then beset by the [[Erinyes|Furies]], who avenge the murders of kin in Greek mythology.<ref name=F244246/>\n\n====''The Eumenides''====\nThe final play of ''The Oresteia'' addresses the question of Orestes' guilt.<ref name=F244246/> The Furies drive Orestes from Argos and into the wilderness. He makes his way to the temple of Apollo and begs him to drive the Furies away. Apollo had encouraged Orestes to kill Clytemnestra, and so bears some of the guilt for the murder. The Furies are a more ancient race of the gods, and Apollo sends Orestes to the temple of Athena, with Hermes as a guide.<ref name=F246/>\n\nThe Furies track him down, and the goddess [[Athena]], patron of Athens, steps in and declares that a trial is necessary. Apollo argues Orestes' case and, after the judges, including Athena deliver a tie vote, Athena announces that Orestes is acquitted. She renames the Furies  ''The Eumenides'' (The Good-spirited, or Kindly Ones), and extols the importance of reason in the development of laws, and, as in ''The Suppliants'', the ideals of a democratic Athens are praised.<ref name=F246/>\n\n===''Prometheus Bound''===\n{{Main|Prometheus Bound}}\n[[File:Dirck van Baburen - Prometheus Being Chained by Vulcan Rijksmuseum SK-A-1606.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[Prometheus Being Chained by Vulcan]]'' by [[Dirck van Baburen]] (1623)]]\n\nIn addition to these six works, a seventh tragedy, ''Prometheus Bound'', is attributed to Aeschylus by ancient authorities. Since the late 19th century, however, scholars have increasingly doubted this ascription, largely on stylistic grounds. Its production date is also in dispute, with theories ranging from the 480s BC to as late as the 410s.<ref name=S33/><ref>{{harvnb |Griffith |1983 |pp=32\u201334}}</ref>\n\nThe play consists mostly of static dialogue, as throughout the play the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]] is bound to a rock as punishment from the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] [[Zeus]] for providing fire to humans. The god [[Hephaestus]], the Titan [[Oceanus]], and the [[greek chorus|chorus]] of [[Oceanids]] all express sympathy for Prometheus' plight. Prometheus meets [[Io (mythology)|Io]], a fellow victim of Zeus' cruelty; and prophesies her future travels, revealing that one of her descendants will free Prometheus. The play closes with Zeus sending Prometheus into the abyss because Prometheus refuses to divulge the secret of a potential marriage that could prove Zeus' downfall.<ref name=Vellacott/>\n\nThe ''Prometheus Bound'' appears to have been the first play in a trilogy called the ''[[Prometheia]]''. In the second play, ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Aeschylus)|Prometheus Unbound]]'', Heracles frees Prometheus from his chains and kills the eagle that had been sent daily to eat Prometheus' perpetually regenerating liver. Perhaps foreshadowing his eventual reconciliation with Prometheus, we learn that Zeus has released the other Titans whom he imprisoned at the conclusion of the [[Titanomachy]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">For a discussion of the trilogy's reconstruction, see (e.g.) Conacher 1980, 100\u201302.</ref>\n\nIn the trilogy's conclusion, ''[[Prometheus the Fire-Bringer]]'', it appears that the Titan finally warns Zeus not to sleep with the sea nymph [[Thetis]], for she is fated to give birth to a son greater than the father. Not wishing to be overthrown, Zeus marries Thetis off to the mortal Peleus; the product of that union is Achilles, Greek hero of the Trojan War. After reconciling with Prometheus, Zeus probably inaugurates a festival in his honor at Athens.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Lost plays==\nOnly the titles and assorted fragments of Aeschylus's other plays have come down to us.  We have enough fragments of some plays (along with comments made by later authors and scholiasts) to produce rough synopses of their plots.\n\n===''Myrmidons''===\nThis play was based on books 9 and 16 in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. Achilles sits in silent indignation over his humiliation at Agamemnon's hands for most of the play. Envoys from the Greek army attempt to reconcile him to [[Agamemnon]], but he yields only to his friend [[Patroclus]], who then battles the Trojans in Achilles' armour. The bravery and death of Patroclus are reported in a messenger's speech, which is followed by mourning.<ref name=\"Kopff 1997 pp.1-472\"/>\n\n===''Nereids''===\nThis play was based on books 18, 19, and 22 of the ''Iliad''; it follows the Daughters of Nereus, the sea god, who lament Patroclus' death.

See Summers 2007, 23.</ref> though Aristotle gives this distinction to Sophocles. Aeschylus is also said to have made the costumes more elaborate and dramatic, and having his actors wear platform boots (''cothurni'') to make them more visible to the audience. According to a later account of Aeschylus's life, as they walked on stage in the first performance of the ''Eumenides'', the chorus of Furies were so frightening in appearance that they caused young children to faint, patriarchs to urinate, and pregnant women to go into labour.<ref>''Life of Aeschylus''.</ref>\n\nHis plays were written in verse, no violence is performed on stage, and the plays have a remoteness from daily life in Athens, either by relating stories about the gods or by being set, like ''The Persians'', in far-away locales.<ref name=\"P223\">{{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|p=223}}</ref> Aeschylus's work has a strong moral and religious emphasis.<ref name=P223/> The ''Oresteia'' trilogy concentrated on man's position in the cosmos in relation to the gods, divine law, and divine punishment.<ref>{{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|pp=224\u201325}}</ref>\n\nAeschylus's popularity is evident in the praise the comic playwright [[Aristophanes]] gives him in ''[[The Frogs]]'', produced some half-century after Aeschylus's death. Appearing as a character in the play, Aeschylus claims at line 1022 that his ''Seven against Thebes'' \"made everyone watching it to love being warlike\"; with his ''Persians'', Aeschylus claims at lines 1026\u20137 that he \"taught the Athenians to desire always to defeat their enemies.\" Aeschylus goes on to say at lines 1039ff. that his plays inspired the Athenians to be brave and virtuous.\n\n===Influence outside Greek culture===\nAeschylus's works were influential beyond his own time. [[Hugh Lloyd-Jones]] draws attention to [[Richard Wagner]]'s reverence of Aeschylus. Michael Ewans argues in his ''Wagner and Aeschylus. The Ring and the Oresteia'' (London: Faber. 1982) that the influence was so great as to merit a direct character by character comparison between Wagner's ''Ring'' and Aeschylus's ''Oresteia''. A critic of his book however, while not denying that Wagner read and respected Aeschylus, has described his arguments as unreasonable and forced.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Furness, Raymond |title=The Modern Language Review |journal=The Modern Language Review |volume=79 |issue=1 |date=January 1984 |pages= 239\u201340 |jstor=3730399 |ref=harv |doi=10.2307/3730399}}</ref>\n\nSir [[J. T. Sheppard]] argues in the second half of his ''Aeschylus and Sophocles: Their Work and Influence'' that Aeschylus, along with [[Sophocles]], have played a major part in the formation of dramatic literature from the [[Renaissance]] to the present, specifically in French and Elizabethan drama. He also claims that their influence went beyond just drama and applies to literature in general, citing Milton and the Romantics.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Aeschylus and Sophocles: their Work and Influence |journal=[[The Journal of Hellenic Studies]] |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=265 |year=1927 |doi=10.2307/625177 |last=Sheppard |first=J.

Prior to writing his acclaimed trilogy, O'Neill had been developing a play about Aeschylus himself, and he noted that Aeschylus \"so changed the system of the tragic stage that he has more claim than anyone else to be regarded as the founder (Father) of Tragedy.\"<ref>Floyd, Virginia, ed.

Kennedy]] and, quoting a passage from the play ''Agamemnon'' (in translation), said: \"My favorite poet was Aeschylus. And he once wrote: 'Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, until in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.' What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness; but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black&nbsp;... Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world.\" The quotation from Aeschylus was later inscribed on a memorial at the gravesite of Robert Kennedy following his own assassination.<ref name=\"flickr.com\"/>{{better source|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Editions==\n*[[Martin Litchfield West|Martin L.

The modularity theorem involved elliptic curves, which was also Wiles's own specialist area.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Peter|title=How Math's Most Famous Proof Nearly Broke|url=http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-maths-most-famous-proof-nearly-broke|publisher=Nautilus|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=28 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as important, but extraordinarily difficult or perhaps impossible to prove.<ref name=\"Singh\">[[Simon Singh]] (1997).

There was no hint in the title that Fermat's last theorem would be discussed, Dr. Ribet said. ... Finally, at the end of his third lecture, Dr. Wiles concluded that he had proved a general case of the Taniyama conjecture. Then, seemingly as an afterthought, he noted that that meant that Fermat's last theorem was true. Q.E.D.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|last=Kolata|first=Gina|title=At Last, Shout of 'Eureka!'

Wiles tried and failed for over a year to repair his proof. According to Wiles, the crucial idea for circumventing, rather than closing this area, came to him on 19 September 1994, when he was on the verge of giving up. Together with his former student [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]], he published a second paper which circumvented the problem and thus completed the proof.

This work settles many of the basic problems on [[cyclotomic field]]s which go back to Kummer, and is unquestionably one of the major advances in number theory in our times. Earlier he did deep work on the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer for elliptic curves with complex multiplication \u2013 one offshoot of this was his proof of an unexpected and beautiful generalisation of the classical explicit reciprocity laws of Artin\u2013Hasse\u2013Iwasawa. Most recently, he has made new progress on the construction of l-adic representations attached to Hilbert modular forms, and has applied these to prove the \"main conjecture\" for cyclotomic

daughter of [[Patrick Bront\u00eb]], a poor Irish clergyman in the [[Church of England]], Anne Bront\u00eb lived most of her life with her family at the parish of [[Haworth]] on the Yorkshire moors. She also attended a boarding school in [[Mirfield]] between 1836 and 1837. At 19 she left Haworth and worked as a governess between 1839 and 1845. After leaving her teaching position, she fulfilled her literary ambitions. She published a volume of poetry with her sisters (''[[Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell]]'', 1846) and two novels. ''[[Agnes Grey]]'', based upon her experiences as a governess, was published in 1847. Her second and last novel, ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'', which is considered to be one of the first sustained [[Feminism|feminist]] novels, appeared in 1848. Like her poems, both her novels were first published under the masculine pen name of '''Acton Bell'''. Anne's life was cut short when she died of what is now suspected to be [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] at the age of 29.\n\nPartly because the re-publication of ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'' was prevented by [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]] after Anne's death, she is not as well known as her sisters.

In April 1820, the Bront\u00ebs moved into the five-roomed Haworth Parsonage which became their home for the rest of their lives.\n\nAnne was barely a year old when her mother became ill of what is believed to have been [[uterine cancer]].<ref name=\"Barker 102 -104\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', pp. 102\u2013104</ref> Maria Branwell died on 15 September 1821.<ref name=\"Fraser 28\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 28</ref> In order to provide a mother for his children, Patrick tried to remarry, but without success.<ref name=\"Fraser 30\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 30</ref> Maria's sister, Elizabeth Branwell (1776\u20131842), moved to the parsonage, initially to nurse her dying sister, but she spent the rest of her life there raising the children.

For the next five years, they were educated at home, largely by their father and aunt.<ref name=\"Fraser 44-45\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', pp. 44\u201345</ref> The children made little attempt to mix with others outside the parsonage, but relied on each other for friendship and companionship. The bleak moors surrounding Haworth became their playground. Anne shared a room with her aunt; they were close, which may have influenced Anne's personality and religious beliefs.<ref name=\"G\u00e9rin 35\">G\u00e9rin, ''Anne Bront\u00eb'', p. 35</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[Image:Anne Bronte.jpg|thumb|Anne Bront\u00eb, by [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]], 1834]]\nAnne's studies at home included music and drawing. Anne, Emily and Branwell had piano lessons from the Keighley church organist. They had art lessons from John Bradley of Keighley and all drew with some skill.<ref name=\"Barker 150\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 150</ref> Their aunt tried to teach the girls how to run a household, but their minds were more inclined to literature.<ref name=\"Fraser 45\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 45</ref> Their father's well-stocked library was a source of knowledge. They read the Bible, [[Homer]], [[Virgil]], [[Shakespeare]], [[John Milton|Milton]], [[Byron]], [[Walter Scott|Scott]], and many others, they examined articles from [[Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine]], [[Fraser's Magazine]], and The Edinburgh Review and read history, geography and biographies.<ref name=\"Fraser 45-48\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', pp. 45\u201348</ref>\n\nReading fed the children's imagination. Their creativity soared after their father presented Branwell with a set of toy soldiers in June 1826. They gave the soldiers names and developed their characters, which they called the \"Twelves\".<ref>The soldiers appear in ''[[The Twelve and the Genii]]'', a 1962 children's fantasy novel by [[Pauline Clarke]].</ref> This led to the creation of an imaginary world: the African kingdom of \"[[Angria (fictional country)|Angria]]\" which was illustrated with maps and watercolour renderings. The children devised plots about the inhabitants of Angria and its capital city, \"Glass Town\", later called Verreopolis or Verdopolis.<ref name=\"Barker 154-155\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nThe fantasy worlds and kingdoms gradually acquired the characteristics of real world\u2014sovereigns, armies, heroes, outlaws, fugitives, inns, schools and publishers. The characters and lands created by the children had newspapers, magazines and chronicles which were written in extremely tiny books, with writing so small it was difficult to read without a magnifying glass. These creations and writings were an apprenticeship for their later, literary talents.<ref name=\"Fraser 48-58\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', pp. 48\u201358</ref>\n\n==Juvenilia==\nAround 1831, when Anne was eleven, she and Emily broke away from Charlotte and Branwell to create and develop their own fantasy world, \"[[Gondal (fictional country)|Gondal]]\". Anne was particularly close to Emily especially after Charlotte's departure for Roe Head School, in January 1831.<ref name=\"Fraser 52-53\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', pp. 52\u201353</ref> When Charlotte's friend [[Ellen Nussey]] visited Haworth in 1833, she reported that Emily and Anne were \"like twins\", \"inseparable companions\". She described Anne:\n\"Anne, dear gentle Anne was quite different in appearance from the others, and she was her aunt's favourite. Her hair was a very pretty light brown, and fell on her neck in graceful curls. She had lovely violet-blue eyes; fine pencilled eyebrows and a clear almost transparent complexion. She still pursued her studies and especially her sewing, under the surveillance of her aunt.\"<ref name=\"Fraser 39\">Fraser, ''A Life of Anne Bront\u00eb'', p. 39</ref><ref name=\"Barker 195\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 195</ref>\nAnne took lessons from Charlotte, after she returned from Roe Head. Charlotte returned to Roe Head as a teacher on 29 July 1835 accompanied by Emily as a pupil; Emily's tuition was largely financed by Charlotte's teaching. Within a few months, Emily unable to adapt to life at school, was physically ill from homesickness. She was withdrawn from school by October, and replaced by Anne.\n\nAged 15, it was Anne's first time away from home, and she made few friends at Roe Head. She was quiet and hard working, and determined to stay and get the education she needed to support herself.<ref name=\"Barker 237-238\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', pp. 237\u2013238</ref><ref name=\"Fraser 84\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 84</ref> She stayed for two years, winning a good-conduct medal in December 1836, and returning home only during Christmas and summer holidays. Anne and Charlotte do not appear to have been close while at Roe Head (Charlotte's letters almost never mention her) but Charlotte was concerned about her sister's health. Sometime before December 1837, Anne became seriously ill with [[gastritis]] and underwent a religious crisis.<ref name=\"Fraser 113\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 113</ref> A [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] minister was called to see her several times during her illness, suggesting her distress was caused, in part, by conflict with the local Anglican clergy. Charlotte wrote to her father who took Anne home where she remained while she recovered.\n\n==Employment at Blake Hall==\n[[File:Blake Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Blake Hall, illustration, reproduced from photographs taken at the end of 19th century. It was demolished in 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wessyman137.wordpress.com/2015/04/19/the-mirfield-murders-1847/|title=The Mirfield Murders  1847|date=19 April 2015|publisher=}}</ref>]]\nIn 1839, a year after leaving the school and aged 19, she was seeking a teaching position. As the daughter of a poor clergyman, she needed to earn a living. Her father had no private income and the parsonage would revert to the church on his death. Teaching or working as governess for a family were among the few options available to poor but educated women. In April 1839, Anne started work as a governess for the Ingham family at Blake Hall, near [[Mirfield]].<ref name=\"Barker 307\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 307</ref>\n\nThe children in her charge were spoilt and often disobedient.<ref name=\"Barker 308\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 308</ref> She had great difficulty controlling them and had little success in instilling any education. She was not empowered to inflict punishment, and when she complained about their behaviour received no support, but was criticised for not being capable. The Inghams, dissatisfied with their children's progress, dismissed Anne.<ref name=\"Barker 318\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 318</ref> She returned home at Christmas, 1839, joining Charlotte and Emily, who had left their positions, and Branwell. The episode at Blake Hall was so traumatic that she reproduced it in almost perfect detail in her novel ''Agnes Grey''.\n\n==William Weightman==\nOn her return to Haworth, she met William Weightman (1814\u20131842), her father's new curate, who started work in the parish in August 1839.<ref name=\"Alexander & Smith, 531\">Alexander & Smith, '' The Oxford Companion to the Bront\u00ebs'', p. 531</ref> Aged 25, he had obtained a two-year licentiate in theology from the [[University of Durham]]. He was welcome at the parsonage. Her acquaintance with him parallels her writing a number of poems, which may suggest she fell in love with him<ref name=\"Barker 341\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 341</ref><ref name=\"Barker 407\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 407</ref> although there is disagreement over this possibility.<ref name=\"Barker 344\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 344</ref> Little evidence exists beyond a teasing anecdote of Charlotte's to Ellen Nussey in January 1842.\n\nThe source of ''Agnes Grey'''s renewed interest in poetry is, however, the curate to whom she is attracted. William Weightman aroused much curiosity. It seems clear he was a good-looking, engaging young man, whose easy humour and kindness towards the sisters made a considerable impression. It is such a character that she portrays in Edward Weston, and that her heroine Agnes Grey finds deeply appealing.<ref name=\"G\u00e9rin 138\">G\u00e9rin, ''Anne Bront\u00eb'', p. 138</ref>\n\nIf Anne formed an attachment to Weightman it does not imply that he was attracted to her. It is possible that Weightman was no more aware of her, her sisters or their friend Ellen Nussey. Nor does it imply that Anne believed him to be interested in her. If anything, her poems suggest the opposite\u2013they speak of quietly experienced but intensely felt emotions, hidden from others, without any indication of being requited. It is possible that an initially mild attraction to Weightman assumed increasing importance to Anne over time, in the absence of other opportunities for love, marriage and children.\n\nAnne would have seen Weightman on her holidays at home, particularly during the summer of 1842 when her sisters were away. Weightman died of cholera in the same year.<ref name=\"Barker 403\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 403</ref> Anne expressed her grief for his death in her poem \"I will not mourn thee, lovely one\", in which she called him \"our darling\".<ref name=\"Alexander & Smith, 531\"/>\n\n==Governess==\n[[Image:Emily Bront\u00eb cropped.jpg|thumb|Disputed portrait made by [[Branwell Bront\u00eb]] about 1833; sources are in disagreement over whether this image is of Emily or Anne.<ref name=\"Portrait\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brontesisters.co.uk/The-Profile-Portrait-Emily-or-Anne.html|title=The Bronte Sisters - A True Likeness? - The Profile Portrait - Emily or Anne|website=www.brontesisters.co.uk}}</ref>]]\nAnne obtained a second post as governess to the children of the Reverend Edmund Robinson and his wife Lydia, at Thorp Green Hall, a comfortable country house near [[York]].<ref name=\"Barker 329\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 329</ref> Anne was employed at Thorp Green Hall from 1840 to 1845.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boroughbridgewalks.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BronteTrail.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512112951/http://www.boroughbridgewalks.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BronteTrail.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 May 2013 |title=The Bront\u00eb Trail |publisher=oroughbridgewalks.org.uk |year= |accessdate=9 October 2013 }}</ref> The house appeared as Horton Lodge in her novel ''Agnes Grey''.

Anne missed her home and family, commenting in a diary paper in 1841 that she did not like her situation and wished to leave it. Her quiet, gentle disposition did not help.<ref name=\"G\u00e9rin 135\">G\u00e9rin, ''Anne Bront\u00eb'', p. 135</ref> However, despite her outwardly placid appearance, Anne was determined and with experience, made a success of her position, becoming well liked by her employers. Her charges, the Robinson girls, became lifelong friends.\n\nFor the next five years, Anne spent no more than five or six weeks a year with her family, during holidays at Christmas and in June. The rest of her time was spent with the Robinsons at Thorp Green. She was obliged to accompany them on annual holidays to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]. Between 1840 and 1844, Anne spent around five weeks each summer at the coastal town and loved the place.<ref name=\"Barker 358-359\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', pp. 358\u2013359</ref> A number of locations in Scarborough were the setting for ''Agnes Grey'''s final scenes and for Linden-Car village in ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall''.\n\nWhilst working for the Robinsons, Anne and her sisters considered the possibility of setting up a school. Various locations including the parsonage were considered. The project never materialised and Anne chose to return to Thorp Green. She came home on the death of her aunt in early November 1842 while her sisters were in Brussels.<ref name=\"Barker 404\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 404</ref> Elizabeth Branwell left a \u00a3350 legacy (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|350|1842|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} for each of her nieces.<ref name=\"Barker 409\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 409</ref>\n\nIt was at the Long Plantation at Thorp Green in 1842 that Anne wrote her three-verse poem ''Lines Composed in a Wood on a Windy Day'', which was published in 1846 under her pen-name of Acton Bell.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boroughbridgewalks.org.uk/?p=12 |title=The Bront\u00eb Trail |publisher=boroughbridgewalks.org.uk |year= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnne returned to Thorp Green in January 1843 where she secured a position for Branwell. He was to take over as tutor to the Robinsons' son, Edmund, who was growing too old to be in Anne's care. Branwell did not live in the house as Anne did.

Charlotte came across Emily's poems which had been shared only with Anne, her partner in the world of Gondal. Charlotte proposed that they be published.

''[[Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell]]'' was available for sale in May 1846. The cost of publication was about three-quarters of Anne's salary at Thorp Green. On 7 May 1846, the first three copies were delivered to Haworth Parsonage.<ref name=\"Barker 491\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 491</ref> It achieved three somewhat favourable reviews, but was a dismal failure, with only two copies being sold in the first year. Anne, however, found a market for her more recent poetry. The ''Leeds Intelligencer'' and ''Fraser's Magazine'' published her poem \"The Narrow Way\" under her pseudonym, Acton Bell in December 1848. Four months earlier, in August, Fraser's Magazine had published her poem \"The Three Guides\".\n\n==Novels==\n\n===''Agnes Grey''===\n{{Main article|Agnes Grey}}\nEven before the fate of the book of poems became apparent, the sisters began work on their first [[novel]]s. Charlotte wrote ''[[The Professor (novel)|The Professor]]'', Emily ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', and Anne ''Agnes Grey''. By July 1846, a package with the three manuscripts was making the rounds of London publishers.\n\nAfter a number of rejections, Emily's ''Wuthering Heights'' and Anne's ''Agnes Grey'' were accepted by the publisher [[Thomas Cautley Newby]], but Charlotte's novel was rejected by every publisher to whom it was sent.<ref name=\"Barker 525\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 525</ref> Charlotte was not long in completing her second novel, ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', which was immediately accepted by [[Smith, Elder & Co.]] and became the first of the sisters' novels to appear in print. While Anne and Emily's novels 'lingered in the press', ''Jane Eyre'' was an immediate and resounding success. Anne and Emily were obliged to pay fifty pounds to help meet their publishing costs. Their publisher, urged on by the success of ''Jane Eyre'', published ''Wuthering Heights'' and ''Agnes Grey'' in December 1847.<ref name=\"Barker 539\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 539</ref> They sold well, but ''Agnes Grey'' was outshone by Emily's more dramatic ''Wuthering Heights''.<ref name=\"Barker 540\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 540</ref>\n\n===''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall''===\n{{Main article|The Tenant of Wildfell Hall}}\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=360\n|image1=The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.jpg\n|alt1=Title-page of the first edition, 1848\n|caption1=Title-page of the first edition, 1848\n|width1=969\n|height1=1460\n|image2=The Tenant of Wildfell Hall American Edition.png\n|width2=969\n|height2=1460\n|alt2=Title-page of the first American edition, 1848\n|caption2=Title-page of the first American edition, 1848<ref>Here Acton Bell (Anne Bront\u00eb) is mistakenly identified as the author of Wuthering Heights.

In seeking to present the truth in literature, Anne's depiction of alcoholism and debauchery was profoundly disturbing to 19th-century sensibilities. Helen Graham, the tenant of the title, intrigues Gilbert Markham and gradually she reveals her past as an artist and wife of the dissipated Arthur Huntingdon. The book's brilliance lies in its revelation of the position of women at the time, and its multi-layered plot.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/bronte/abronte/downey2.html\n|title=The Critics of Wildfell Hall\n|publisher=www.victorianweb.org\n|accessdate=8 October 2009\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIt is easy today to underestimate the extent to which the novel challenged existing social and legal structures. [[May Sinclair]], in 1913, said that the slamming of Helen Huntingdon's bedroom door against her husband reverberated throughout Victorian England. Anne's heroine eventually left her husband to protect their young son from his influence. She supported herself and her son by painting while living in hiding, fearful of discovery. In doing so, she violated not only social conventions, but English law. Until 1870, when the [[Married Women's Property Act 1870|Married Women's Property Act]] was passed, a married woman had no independent legal existence apart from her husband; could not own property, sue for divorce, or control custody of her children. If she attempted to live apart, her husband had the right to reclaim her. If she took their child, she was liable for kidnapping. By living on her own income she was held to be stealing her husband's property, since any property she held or income she made was legally his.<ref name=\"Oxcomp\"/>\n\nIn the second edition of ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'', which appeared in August 1848, Anne clearly stated her intentions in writing it. She presented a forceful rebuttal to critics (Charlotte was among them) who considered her portrayal of Huntingdon overly graphic and disturbing.\n\n{{quote|When we have to do with vice and vicious characters, I maintain it is better to depict them as they really are than as they would wish to appear.

Emily refused to go with them. The women spent several days in his company. Many years after Anne's death, he wrote in the [[Cornhill Magazine]] his impressions of her, describing her as:\n\"a gentle, quiet, rather subdued person, by no means pretty, yet of a pleasing appearance. Her manner was curiously expressive of a wish for protection and encouragement, a kind of constant appeal which invited sympathy.\"<ref name=\"Barker 559\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 559</ref>\n\nThe increasing popularity of the Bells' work led to renewed interest in the ''Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell'', originally published by Aylott and Jones. The remaining print run was bought by Smith and Elder, and reissued under new covers in November 1848. It still sold poorly.\n\n==Family tragedies==\nAlthough Anne and her sisters were only in their late twenties, a highly successful literary career appeared a certainty for them.

En route, they spent a day and a night in York, where, escorting Anne around in a wheelchair, they did some shopping, and at Anne's request, visited York Minster. However, it was clear that Anne had little strength left.\n[[File:AnnBrontegrave.JPG|left|thumb|Memorial slab lying on the grave of Anne Bront\u00eb]]\nOn Sunday, 27 May, Anne asked Charlotte whether it would be easier if she returned home to die instead of remaining in Scarborough.

She expressed her love and concern for Ellen and Charlotte, and seeing Charlotte's distress, whispered to her to \"take courage\".<ref name=\"Barker 594\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 594</ref> Conscious and calm, Anne died at about two o'clock in the afternoon, Monday, 28 May 1849 at age 29.\n\nOver the following days, Charlotte made the decision to \"lay the flower where it had fallen\".<ref name=\"Biography of Anne Bront\u00eb\"/> Anne was buried, not in Haworth with the rest of her family, but in Scarborough. The funeral was held on Wednesday 30 May which did not allow time for Patrick Bront\u00eb to make the {{convert|70|mi|km|adj=on}} journey, had he wished to do so. The former schoolmistress at Roe Head, Miss Wooler, was in Scarborough and she was the only other mourner at Anne's funeral.<ref name=\"Barker 595\">Barker, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 595</ref> She was buried in [[St Mary's Church, Scarborough|St Mary's]] churchyard, beneath the castle walls, overlooking the bay. Charlotte commissioned a stone to be placed over her grave, with the simple inscription \"Here lie the remains of Anne Bront\u00eb, daughter of the Revd P. Bront\u00eb, Incumbent of Haworth, Yorkshire. She died Aged 28 May 28th 1849\". When Charlotte visited the grave three years later, she discovered multiple errors on the headstone, and thus it was refaced. However, Anne's age at death was still written as 28 when, in fact, she was 29 when she died.\n\nIn 2011, the Bront\u00eb Society installed a new plaque at Anne Bront\u00eb's grave. Due to weathering and erosion, the original gravestone had become illegible at places and could not be restored.

By the time he realized that he needed to know Greek, it was too late; and although he acquired a smattering of the language, he was never eloquent with it. However, his mastery of Latin was another matter. He became an expert both in the eloquent use of the language and in the use of clever arguments to make his points.\n\n===Move to Carthage, Rome, Milan===\n[[File:Augustine Lateran.jpg|thumb|The earliest known portrait of Saint Augustine in a 6th-century fresco, Lateran, Rome]]\n\nAugustine taught grammar at Thagaste during 373 and 374. The following year he moved to Carthage to conduct a school of rhetoric and would remain there for the next nine years.<ref name=EA/> Disturbed by unruly students in Carthage, he moved to establish a school in Rome, where he believed the best and brightest rhetoricians practiced, in 383. However, Augustine was disappointed with the apathetic reception. It was the custom for students to pay their fees to the professor on the last day of the term, and many students attended faithfully all term, and then did not pay.\n\nManichaean friends introduced him to the prefect of the City of Rome, [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]], who while traveling through Carthage had been asked by the imperial court at [[Milan]]<ref name=\"celife\" /> to provide a rhetoric professor. Augustine won the job and headed north to take his position in Milan in late 384. Thirty years old, he had won the most visible academic position in the Latin world at a time when such posts gave ready access to political careers.\n\nAlthough Augustine showed some fervour for Manichaeism, he was never an initiate or \"elect\", but an \"auditor\", the lowest level in the sect's hierarchy.<ref name = \"celife\" /> While still at Carthage a disappointing meeting with the Manichaean Bishop, [[Faustus of Mileve]], a key exponent of Manichaean theology, started Augustine's scepticism of Manichaeanism.<ref name=\"celife\" /> In Rome, he reportedly turned away from Manichaeanism, embracing the [[Philosophical scepticism|scepticism]] of the [[New Academy]] movement. Because of his education, Augustine had great rhetorical prowess and was very knowledgeable of the philosophies behind many faiths.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Kishlansky| first1=Mark| last2=Geary| first2=Patrick| last3=O'Brien| first3=Patricia| title=Civilization in the West| date=2010| publisher=Pearson Education Inc.| location=New Jersey| pages=142\u2013143| volume=Vol. 1: to 1715| ref=Augustine of Hippo|isbn=978-0205664726}}</ref> At Milan, his mother's religiosity, Augustine's own studies in [[Neoplatonism]], and his friend [[Simplician]]us all urged him towards Christianity.<ref name=\"EA\" /> Initially Augustine was not strongly influenced by Christianity and its ideologies, but after coming in contact with [[Ambrose]] of Milan, Augustine reevaluated himself and was forever changed.\n\nLike Augustine, Ambrose was a master of rhetoric, but older and more experienced.<ref name = \"BeDuhn2009\">{{cite book | first = Jason David | last = BeDuhn | title = Augustine's Manichaean Dilemma: Conversion and Apostasy, 373\u2013388 C.E. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEmZaq1Gg3wC&pg=PA163 | accessdate = 17 June 2011 | date =2009| publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-4210-2|page= 163}}</ref> Augustine was very much influenced by Ambrose, even more than by his own mother and others he admired.

More interested in his speaking skills than the topic of speech, Augustine quickly discovered that Ambrose was a spectacular orator. Eventually, Augustine says that he was spiritually led into the faith of Christianity.<ref name=\"Augustine: Account of His Own Conversion\"/>\n\nAugustine's mother had followed him to Milan and arranged a marriage for him. Although Augustine accepted this marriage, for which he had to abandon his concubine, he was deeply hurt by the loss of his lover. He wrote, \"My mistress being torn from my side as an impediment to my marriage, my heart, which clave to her, was racked, and wounded, and bleeding.\" Augustine confessed that he was not a lover of wedlock so much as a slave of lust, so he procured another concubine since he had to wait two years until his fianc\u00e9e came of age. However, his emotional wound was not healed, even began to fester.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 6:15</ref>\n\nThere is evidence that Augustine may have considered this former relationship to be equivalent to marriage.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Burrus | first=Virginia| year=2011| title=\"Fleeing the Uxorious Kingdom\": Augustine's Queer Theology of Marriage | journal =Journal of Early Christian Studies|volume=19| issue=1| pages = 1\u201320| doi=10.1353/earl.2011.0002}}</ref> In his ''Confessions'', he admitted that the experience eventually produced a decreased sensitivity to pain. Augustine eventually broke off his engagement to his eleven-year-old fianc\u00e9e, but never renewed his relationship with either of his concubines. [[Alypius of Thagaste]] steered Augustine away from marriage, saying that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married.

[[#Brown|Brown]], p. 64.\n</ref> at the age of 31, after having heard and been inspired and moved by the story of Ponticianus's and his friends' first reading of the life of [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony of the Desert]], Augustine converted to Christianity. As Augustine later told it, his conversion was prompted by a childlike voice he heard telling him to \"take up and read\" ({{lang-la|tolle, lege}}), which he took as a divine command to open the Bible and read the first thing he saw. Augustine read from [[Epistle to the Romans|Paul's Epistle to the Romans]] \u2013 the \"''[[Epistle to the Romans#Transformation of believers (12\u201315:13)|Transformation of Believers]]''\" section, consisting of chapters 12 to 15 \u2013 wherein Paul outlines how the Gospel transforms believers, and the believers' resulting behaviour. The specific part to which Augustine opened his Bible was Romans chapter 13, verses 13 and 14, to wit:\n{{Quote |Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof.<ref>{{cite book| author = Augustine of Hippo | title = Confessions |year= 2008| publisher= Oxford University Press| place = New York | pages =152\u2013153 | others = Chadwick, Henry transl}}</ref>}}\n\nHe later wrote an account of his conversion \u2013 his very transformation, as Paul described \u2013 in his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' ({{lang-la|Confessiones}}), which has since become a classic of Christian theology and a key text in the history of [[autobiography]]. This work is an outpouring of thanksgiving and penitence.

Around 720, his remains were transported again by Peter, [[bishop of Pavia]] and uncle of the Lombard king [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]], to the church of [[San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro]] in Pavia, in order to save them from frequent coastal raids by [[Muslim]]s. In January 1327, [[Pope John XXII]] issued the papal bull ''Veneranda Santorum Patrum'', in which he appointed the [[Augustinians]] guardians of the tomb of Augustine (called ''Arca''), which was remade in 1362 and elaborately carved with bas-reliefs of scenes from Augustine's life.\n\nIn October 1695, some workmen in the Church of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia discovered a marble box containing some human bones (including part of a skull). A dispute arose between the Augustinian hermits (Order of Saint Augustine) and the [[regular canons]] (Canons Regular of Saint Augustine) as to whether these were the bones of Augustine. The hermits did not believe so; the canons affirmed that they were. Eventually [[Pope Benedict XIII]] (1724\u20131730) directed the Bishop of Pavia, [[Monsignor]] Pertusati, to make a determination.

It sufficed for him to admit that they are metaphysically distinct: to be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, and the soul is superior to the body.

He argued that the six-day structure of creation presented in the Book of Genesis represents a [[framework interpretation (Genesis)|logical framework]], rather than the passage of time in a physical way \u2013 it would bear a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, which is no less literal. One reason for this interpretation is the passage in [[Sirach]] 18:1, ''creavit omnia simul'' (\"He created all things at once\"), which Augustine took as proof that the days of Genesis 1 had to be taken non-literally.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Wm B Eerdmans | isbn = 978-0-8028-3843-8 | pages = 377\u2013378 | editor-first = Allan D | editor-last = Fitzgerald | last = Teske| first = Roland J | title = Genesi ad litteram liber imperfectus, De| encyclopedia = Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia| year = 1999}}</ref> As an additional support for describing the six days of creation as a [[heuristic]] device, Augustine thought that the actual event of creation would be incomprehensible by humans and therefore need to be translated.<ref>{{cite book | last = Franklin-Brown | first = Mary | title = Reading the world : encyclopedic writing in the scholastic age | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago London | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780226260709|p=280}}</ref>\n\nAugustine also does not envision original sin as causing structural changes in the universe, and even suggests that the bodies of [[Adam and Eve]] were already created mortal before [[Fall of man|the Fall]].<ref>''On the Merits'', 1.2; ''City of God'', 13:1; ''Enchiridion'', 104</ref>\n\n====Ecclesiology====\n{{See also|Ecclesiology}}\n[[File:Carlo Crivelli - St. Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|''St. Augustine'' by [[Carlo Crivelli]]]]\nAugustine developed his doctrine of the Church principally in reaction to the [[Donatist]] sect. He taught that there is one Church, but that within this Church there are two realities, namely, the visible aspect (the institutional [[hierarchy of the Catholic Church|hierarchy]], the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Catholic sacraments]], and the [[laity]]) and the invisible (the souls of those in the Church, who are either dead, sinful members or elect predestined for Heaven). The former is the institutional body established by Christ on earth which proclaims salvation and administers the [[sacrament]]s, while the latter is the invisible body of the elect, made up of genuine believers from all ages, and who are known only to God. The Church, which is visible and societal, will be made up of \"wheat\" and \"tares\", that is, good and wicked people (as per Mat. 13:30), until the end of time. This concept countered the Donatist claim that only those in a [[state (theology)|state of grace]] were the \"true\" or \"pure\" church on earth, and that priests and bishops who were not in a state of grace had no authority or ability to confect the sacraments.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\">{{cite book\n| author=Gonzalez, Justo L.\n| title=A History of Christian Thought: Volume 2 (From Augustine to the eve of the Reformation)\n| publisher=Abingdon Press\n| isbn=978-0687171835\n| date=1970\u20131975}}</ref>{{rp|28}}\n\nAugustine's ecclesiology was more fully developed in ''[[The City of God (book)|City of God]]''. There he conceives of the church as a heavenly city or kingdom, ruled by love, which will ultimately triumph over all earthly empires which are self-indulgent and ruled by pride. Augustine followed [[Cyprian]] in teaching that the bishops and priests of the Church are the [[apostolic succession|successors of the Apostles]],<ref name=\"Gonzalez\"/> and that their authority in the Church is God-given.\n\n====Eschatology====\nAugustine originally believed in [[premillennialism]], namely that Christ would establish a literal 1,000-year kingdom prior to the general [[resurrection]], but later rejected the belief, viewing it as carnal. He was the first theologian to expound a systematic doctrine of [[amillennialism]], although some theologians and Christian historians believe his position was closer to that of modern [[postmillennialism|postmillennialists]]. The mediaeval Catholic church built its system of eschatology on Augustinian amillennialism, where Christ rules the earth spiritually through his triumphant church.<ref>{{cite book| author=Blomberg, Craig L. |title=From Pentecost to Patmos| publisher=Apollos| year=2006| page=519| isbn=978-0805432480}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Reformation]] theologians such as [[John Calvin]] accepted amillennialism.

His teaching provided fuel for later theology.<ref name=Cross/>\n\n====Mariology====\nAlthough Augustine did not develop an independent [[Mariology]], his statements on Mary surpass in number and depth those of other early writers. Even before the [[Council of Ephesus]], he defended the [[perpetual virginity of Mary|Ever-Virgin Mary]] as the [[theotokos|Mother of God]], believing her to be \"full of grace\" (following earlier Latin writers such as [[Jerome]]) on account of her sexual integrity and innocence.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De Sancta Virginitate'', 6,6, 191.</ref> Likewise, he affirmed that the Virgin Mary \"conceived as virgin, gave birth as virgin and stayed virgin forever\".<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De Sancta Virginitate'', 18</ref>\n\n====Natural knowledge and biblical interpretation====\nAugustine took the view that, if a literal interpretation contradicts science and our God-given reason, the Biblical text should be interpreted metaphorically. While each passage of Scripture has a literal sense, this \"literal sense\" does not always mean that the Scriptures are mere history; at times they are rather an extended [[metaphor]].<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''De Genesi ad literam 1:19\u201320'', Chapt. 19 [408], ''De Genesi ad literam'', 2:9</ref>\n\n====Original sin====\n{{see also|Original sin}}\n\n[[File:Saint Augustine by Philippe de Champaigne.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 17th century]]\nAugustine taught that the sin of Adam and Eve was either an act of foolishness (''insipientia'') followed by pride and disobedience to God or that pride came first.<ref group=lower-alpha>He explained to Julian of Eclanum that it was a most subtle job to discern what came first: ''Sed si disputatione subtilissima et elimatissima opus est, ut sciamus utrum primos homines insipientia superbos, an insipientes superbia fecerit''.

For it does many things through vicious desire, as though in forgetfulness of itself. For it sees some things intrinsically excellent, in that more excellent nature which is God: and whereas it ought to remain steadfast that it may enjoy them, it is turned away from Him, by wishing to appropriate those things to itself, and not to be like to Him by His gift, but to be what He is by its own, and it begins to move and slip gradually down into less and less, which it thinks to be more and more.\" (\"[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/130105.htm On the Trinity]\" (''De Trinitate''), 5:7; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 50, 320 [1\u201312])</ref>\n\nThey would not have fallen into pride and lack of wisdom, if [[Satan]] hadn't sown into their senses \"the root of evil\" (''radix Mali'').<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Nisi radicem mali humanus tunc reciperet sensus''  (\"Contra Julianum\", I, 9.42; <abbr title=\"Patrologia Latina\">[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]</abbr> 44, 670)</ref> Their nature was wounded by [[concupiscence]] or [[libido]], which affected human intelligence and will, as well as affections and desires, including sexual desire.<ref group=lower-alpha>In one of Augustine's late works, ''[[Retractationes]]'', he made a significant remark indicating the way he understood difference between spiritual, moral libido and the sexual desire: \"Libido is not good and righteous use of the libido\" (\"libido non est bonus et rectus usus libidinis\"). See the whole passage: ''Dixi etiam quodam loco: \u00abQuod enim est cibus ad salutem hominis, hoc est concubitus ad salutem generis, et utrumque non est sine delectatione carnali, quae tamen modificata et temperantia refrenante in usum naturalem redacta, libido esse non potest\u00bb.

Who, then, in that case can rightly separate any unlawful lust whatever from the category of fornication, if covetousness is fornication? And from this we perceive, that because of unlawful lusts, not only those of which one is guilty in acts of uncleanness with another's husband or wife, but any unlawful lusts whatever, which cause the soul making a bad use of the body to wander from the law of God, and to be ruinously and basely corrupted, a man may, without crime, put away his wife, and a wife her husband, because the Lord makes the cause of fornication an exception; which fornication, in accordance with the above considerations, we are compelled to understand as being general and universal.''

[[Anselm of Canterbury]] established in his ''[[Cur Deus Homo]]'' the definition that was followed by the great 13th-century Schoolmen, namely that Original Sin is the \"privation of the righteousness which every man ought to possess\", thus separating it from ''concupiscence'', with which some of Augustine's disciples had defined it<ref name=Bonner/>{{rp|371}}<ref>{{cite book |title=The Making of the Middle Ages |last=Southern |first=R.W. |year=1953 |location=London |pages=234\u2013237}}</ref> as later did Luther and Calvin.<ref name=Cross/>{{rp|1200\u20131204}} In 1567, [[Pope Pius V]] condemned the identification of Original Sin with concupiscence.<ref name=Cross/>{{rp|1200\u20131204}}\n\n====Predestination====\n{{see also|Predestination}}\nAugustine taught that God orders all things while preserving human freedom.<ref name=\"Levering\">{{cite book |last=Levering |first=Matthew |title=Predestination: Biblical and Theological Paths |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-19-960452-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cLBS6Dl1OYgC}}</ref>{{rp|44}} Prior to 396, he believed that predestination was based on God's foreknowledge of whether individuals would believe, that God's grace was \"a reward for human assent\".<ref name=\"Levering\"/>{{rp|48\u201349}} Later, in response to [[Pelagius]], Augustine said that the sin of [[pride]] consists in assuming that \"we are the ones who choose God or that God chooses us (in his foreknowledge) because of something worthy in us\", and argued that God's grace causes individual act of faith.<ref name=\"Levering\"/>{{rp|47\u201348}}\n\nScholars are divided over whether Augustine's teaching implies [[double predestination]], or the belief that God chooses some people for damnation as well as some for salvation.

Regular sacraments are performed by clergy of the Catholic Church, while sacraments performed by schismatics are considered irregular. Nevertheless, the validity of the sacraments do not depend upon the holiness of the priests who perform them (''[[ex opere operato]]''); therefore, irregular sacraments are still accepted as valid provided they are done in the name of Christ and in the manner prescribed by the Church. On this point Augustine departs from the earlier teaching of [[Cyprian]], who taught that converts from schismatic movements must be re-baptised.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\"/> Augustine taught that sacraments administered outside the Catholic Church, though true sacraments, avail nothing. However, he also stated that baptism, while it does not confer any grace when done outside the Church, does confer grace as soon as one is received into the Catholic Church.\n\nAugustine upheld the early Christian understanding of the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], saying that Christ's statement, \"This is my body\" referred to the bread he carried in his hands,<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Explanations of the Psalms'' 33:1:10 [405]</ref><ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Sermons'' 227 [411]</ref> and that Christians must have faith that the bread and wine are in fact the body and blood of Christ, despite what they see with their eyes.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Sermons'' 272</ref>\n\nAgainst the [[Pelagians]], Augustine strongly stressed the importance of [[infant baptism]]. About the question whether baptism is an absolute necessity for salvation, however, Augustine appears to have refined his beliefs during his lifetime, causing some confusion among later theologians about his position. He said in one of his sermons that only the baptized are saved.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''A Sermon to Catechumens on the Creed'', Paragraph 16</ref> This belief was shared by many early Christians. However, a passage from his ''City of God'', concerning the [[Apocalypse]], may indicate that Augustine did believe in an exception for children born to Christian parents.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book 20, Chapter 8</ref>\n\n===Philosophy===\n====Astrology====\nAugustine's contemporaries often believed [[astrology]] to be an exact and genuine science. Its practitioners were regarded as true men of learning and called ''mathemathici''. Astrology played a prominent part in Manichaean doctrine, and Augustine himself was attracted by their books in his youth, being particularly fascinated by those who claimed to foretell the future. Later, as a bishop, he used to warn that one should avoid astrologers who combine science and [[horoscope]]s. (Augustine's term \"mathematici\", meaning \"astrologers\", is sometimes mistranslated as \"mathematicians\".) According to Augustine, they were not genuine students of [[Hipparchus]] or [[Eratosthenes]] but \"common swindlers\".<ref>{{cite book | title = Augustine the Bishop.

His early dialogues [''Contra academicos'' (386) and ''De Magistro'' (389)], both written shortly after his conversion to Christianity, reflect his engagement with sceptical arguments and show the development of his doctrine of [[divine illumination]]. The doctrine of illumination claims that God plays an active and regular part in human perception (as opposed to God designing the human mind to be reliable consistently, as in, for example, Descartes' idea of clear and distinct perceptions) and understanding by illuminating the mind so that human beings can recognize intelligible realities that God presents. According to Augustine, illumination is obtainable to all rational minds, and is different from other forms of [[sense perception]]. It is meant to be an explanation of the conditions required for the mind to have a connection with intelligible entities.<ref name=encyclopedia>{{cite encyclopedia| last=Mendelson| first=Michael| title=Saint Augustine| url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/augustine/| publisher=''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''| accessdate=21 December 2012| date=2000-03-24}}</ref>\n\nAugustine also posed the [[problem of other minds]] throughout different works, most famously perhaps in ''[[On the Trinity]]'' (VIII.6.9), and developed what has come to be a standard solution: the argument from analogy to other minds.<ref>{{cite book| author=Matthews, Gareth B. |title=Thought's ego in Augustine and Descartes| isbn=978-0801427756| publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1992}}</ref> In contrast to Plato and other earlier philosophers, Augustine recognized the centrality of [[Philosophical problems of testimony|testimony]] to human knowledge and argued that what others tell us can provide knowledge even if we don't have independent reasons to believe their testimonial reports.<ref>{{cite journal| last=King| first=Peter| author2=Nathan Ballantyne| title=Augustine on Testimony| journal=[[Canadian Journal of Philosophy]]| year=2009| volume=39| issue=2| doi=10.1353/cjp.0.0045| url=http://www.canadianjournalofphilosophy.com/PDFs/cjp39-2--195-214--Ballantyne-King.pdf| page=195| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911164130/http://www.canadianjournalofphilosophy.com/PDFs/cjp39-2--195-214--Ballantyne-King.pdf| archivedate=11 September 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Just war====\n{{See also|Just war theory}}\nAugustine asserted that Christians should be [[pacifists]] as a personal, philosophical stance.<ref>[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/septemberweb-only/9-17-55.0.html \"A Time For War?\"] ''Christianity Today'' (2001-01-09).

In ''On Christian Doctrine'' Augustine contrasts love, which is enjoyment on account of God, and lust, which is not on account of God.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''On Christian Doctrine'', 3.37</ref> Augustine claims that, following the Fall, sexual passion has become necessary for copulation (as required to stimulate male erection), sexual passion is an evil result of the Fall, and therefore, evil must inevitably accompany sexual intercourse (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 1.19). Therefore, following the Fall, even marital sex carried out merely to procreate the species inevitably perpetuates evil (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 1.27; ''A Treatise against Two Letters of the Pelagians'' 2.27). For Augustine, proper love exercises a denial of selfish pleasure and the subjugation of corporeal desire to God. The only way to avoid evil caused by sexual intercourse is to take the \"better\" way (''Confessions'' 8.2) and abstain from marriage (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 1.31). Sex within marriage is not, however, for Augustine a sin, although necessarily producing the evil of sexual passion. Based on the same logic, Augustine also declared the pious virgins raped during the sack of Rome to be innocent because they did not intend to sin nor enjoy the act.<ref>[[#Russel|Russell]], p. 356.</ref><ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book I, Ch. 16, 18.</ref>\n\nBefore the Fall, Augustine believed that sex was a passionless affair, \"just like many a laborious work accomplished by the compliant operation of our other limbs, without any lascivious heat\"; the penis would have been engorged for sexual intercourse \"simply by the direction of the will, not excited by the ardour of concupiscence\" (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 2.29; cf. ''City of God'' 14.23). After the Fall, by contrast, the penis cannot be controlled by mere will, subject instead to both unwanted impotence and involuntary erections: \"Sometimes the urge arises unwanted; sometimes, on the other hand, it forsakes the eager lover, and desire grows cold in the body while burning in the mind... It arouses the mind, but it does not follow through what it has begun and arouse the body also\" (''City of God'' 14.16).\n\nAugustine believed that Adam and Eve had both already chosen in their hearts to disobey God's command not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge before Eve took the fruit, ate it, and gave it to Adam.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', 14.13</ref><ref>Clark, E. ed.

In his ''Tractates on the Gospel of John'', Augustine, commenting on the [[Samaritan]] woman from John 4:1\u201342, uses the woman as a figure of the Church in agreement with the New Testament teaching that the Church is the bride of Christ. \"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.\" <ref>(Eph: 5, 25)</ref>\n\n====Pedagogy====\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - St Augustin dans son cabinet de travail.jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Augustine in His Cell (Botticelli)|Saint Augustine in His Study]]'' by [[Sandro Botticelli]], 1494, [[Uffizi Gallery]]]]\nAugustine is considered an influential figure in the history of education. A work early in Augustine's writings is ''De Magistro'' (On the Teacher), which contains insights about education. His ideas changed as he found better directions or better ways of expressing his ideas. In the last years of his life Saint Augustine wrote his ''[[Retractationes]]'' (''Retractations''), reviewing his writings and improving specific texts. Henry Chadwick believes an accurate translation of \"retractationes\" may be \"reconsiderations\". Reconsiderations can be seen as an overarching theme of the way Saint Augustine learned. Augustine's understanding of the search for understanding, meaning, and truth as a restless journey leaves room for doubt, development, and change.<ref name=mccloskey/>\n\nAugustine was a strong advocate of [[critical thinking]] skills. Because written works were still rather limited during this time, spoken communication of knowledge was very important. His emphasis on the importance of community as a means of learning distinguishes his pedagogy from some others. Augustine believed that dialectic is the best means for learning and that this method should serve as a model for learning encounters between teachers and students. Saint Augustine's dialogue writings model the need for lively interactive dialogue among learners.<ref name=mccloskey>McCloskey, Gary N. (April 2008) [http://www.merrimack.edu/academics/augustinian_pedagogy/documents/encountering_0408.pdf Encounters of Learning: Saint Augustine on Education], Saint Augustine Institute for Learning and Teaching, [[Merrimack College]].</ref>\n\nHe recommended adapting educational practices to fit the students' educational backgrounds:\n* the student who has been well-educated by knowledgeable teachers;\n* the student who has had no education; and\n* the student who has had a poor education, but believes himself to be well-educated.\n\nIf a student has been well educated in a wide variety of subjects, the teacher must be careful not to repeat what they have already learned, but to challenge the student with material which they do not yet know thoroughly. With the student who has had no education, the teacher must be patient, willing to repeat things until the student understands, and sympathetic. Perhaps the most difficult student, however, is the one with an inferior education who believes he understands something when he does not. Augustine stressed the importance of showing this type of student the difference between \"having words and having understanding\" and of helping the student to remain humble with his acquisition of knowledge.\n\nUnder the influence of [[Bede]], [[Alcuin]], and [[Rabanus Maurus]], ''De catechizandis rudibus'' came to exercise an important role in the education of clergy at the monastic schools, especially from the eighth century onwards.<ref>Howie, G. (1969) ''Educational Theory and Practice in St. Augustine'' (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, pp. 150\u2013153</ref>\n\nAugustine believed that students should be given an opportunity to apply learned theories to practical experience. Yet another of Augustine's major contributions to education is his study on the styles of teaching. He claimed there are two basic styles a teacher uses when speaking to the students. The ''mixed style'' includes complex and sometimes showy language to help students see the beautiful artistry of the subject they are studying. The ''grand style'' is not quite as elegant as the mixed style, but is exciting and heartfelt, with the purpose of igniting the same passion in the students' hearts. Augustine balanced his teaching philosophy with the traditional [[Bible]]-based practice of strict discipline.\n\n==Works==\n{{main article|Augustine of Hippo bibliography}}\n[[File:Antonio Rodr\u00edguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Saint Augustine'' painting by Antonio Rodr\u00edguez]]\nAugustine was one of the most prolific Latin authors in terms of surviving works, and the list of his works consists of more than one hundred separate titles.<ref>Wright, F.A. and Sinclair, T.A. (1931) ''A History of Later Latin Literature'', Dawsons of Pall Mall, London, pp. 56 ff.</ref> They include [[apologetics|apologetic]] works against the heresies of the [[Arianism|Arians]], [[Donatists]], [[Manichaeans]] and [[Pelagians]]; texts on Christian [[doctrine]], notably ''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (''On Christian Doctrine''); [[exegesis|exegetical]] works such as commentaries on [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], the [[Psalms]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] [[Letter to the Romans]]; many [[sermon]]s and [[Letter (message)|letters]]; and the ''Retractationes'', a review of his earlier works which he wrote near the end of his life.\n\nApart from those, Augustine is probably best known for his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'', which is a personal account of his earlier life, and for ''De civitate Dei'' (''[[The City of God]]'', consisting of 22 books), which he wrote to restore the confidence of his fellow Christians, which was badly shaken by the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]] by the [[Visigoths]] in 410. His ''[[On the Trinity]]'', in which he developed what has become known as the 'psychological analogy' of the [[Trinity]], is also considered to be among his masterpieces, and arguably one of the greatest theological works of all time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} He also wrote ''On Free Choice of the Will'' (''[[De libero arbitrio (Augustine)|De libero arbitrio]]''), addressing why God gives humans free will that can be used for evil.\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Verg\u00f3s Group - Saint Augustine Disputing with the Heretics - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Saint Augustine Disputing with the Heretics'' painting by Verges Group]]\n\nIn both his philosophical and theological reasoning, Augustine was greatly influenced by [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]] and [[Neoplatonism]], particularly by the work of [[Plotinus]], author of the ''[[Enneads]]'', probably through the mediation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Gaius Marius Victorinus|Victorinus]] (as [[Pierre Hadot]] has argued). Although he later abandoned Neoplatonism, some ideas are still visible in his early writings.<ref>[[#Russel|Russell]], Book II, Chapter IV</ref> His early and influential writing on the [[Will (philosophy)|human will]], a central topic in [[ethics]], would become a focus for later philosophers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. He was also influenced by the works of [[Virgil]] (known for his teaching on language), and [[Cicero]] (known for his teaching on argument).<ref name=encyclopedia/>\n\n===In philosophy===\n[[Philosopher]] [[Bertrand Russell]] was impressed by Augustine's meditation on the nature of time in the ''Confessions'', comparing it favourably to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s version of the view that time is subjective.<ref>[[#Russel|Russell]], pp. 352\u2013353.</ref> Catholic theologians generally subscribe to Augustine's belief that God exists [[eternity|outside of time]] in the \"eternal present\"; that time only exists within the created universe because only in space is time discernible through motion and change. His meditations on the nature of time are closely linked to his consideration of the human ability of [[memory]]. [[Frances Yates]] in her 1966 study ''[[The Art of Memory]]'' argues that a brief passage of the ''Confessions'', 10.8.12, in which Augustine writes of walking up a flight of stairs and entering the vast fields of memory<ref>[http://www.stoa.org/hippo/text10.html#TB10C8S12 Confessiones Liber X: commentary on 10.8.12] ''(in Latin)''</ref> clearly indicates that the ancient Romans were aware of how to use explicit spatial and architectural metaphors as a [[mnemonic]] technique for organizing large amounts of information.\n\n[[File:Verg\u00f3s Group - Saint Augustine Meditates on the Trinity when the Child Jesus Appears before him - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Saint Augustine Meditates on the Trinity when the Child Jesus Appears before him'' by Verg\u00f3s Group]]\nAugustine's philosophical method, especially demonstrated in his ''Confessions'', had continuing influence on Continental philosophy throughout the 20th century. His descriptive approach to intentionality, memory, and language as these phenomena are experienced within consciousness and time anticipated and inspired the insights of modern [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]].<ref>{{cite book| last=de Paulo| first=Craig J.

Bloomington: Indiana UP, p. 21.</ref>\n\n[[Martin Heidegger]] refers to Augustine's descriptive philosophy at several junctures in his influential work ''[[Being and Time]]''.<ref group=lower-alpha>For example, Heidegger's articulations of how \"Being-in-the-world\" is described through thinking about ''seeing'': \"The remarkable priority of 'seeing' was noticed particularly by Augustine, in connection with his Interpretation of ''concupiscentia''.\" Heidegger then quotes the''Confessions'': \"Seeing belongs properly to the eyes.

New York: Harpers, 1964, p. 171.</ref> [[Hannah Arendt]] began her philosophical writing with a dissertation on Augustine's concept of love, ''Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin'' (1929): \"The young Arendt attempted to show that the philosophical basis for ''vita socialis'' in Augustine can be understood as residing in neighbourly love, grounded in his understanding of the common origin of humanity.\"<ref>{{cite journal| author=Chiba, Shin| title= Hannah Arendt on Love and the Political: Love, Friendship, and Citizenship| journal=The Review of Politics| volume= 57| issue= 3 | year=1995| pages= 505\u2013535 (507)| jstor=1408599| doi=10.1017/S0034670500019720}}</ref>\n\nJean Bethke Elshtain in ''Augustine and the Limits of Politics'' tried to associate Augustine with Arendt in their concept of evil: \"Augustine did not see evil as glamorously demonic but rather as absence of good, something which paradoxically is really nothing.

On the topic of original sin, Aquinas proposed a more optimistic view of man than that of Augustine in that his conception leaves to the reason, will, and passions of fallen man their natural powers even after the Fall, without \"supernatural gifts\".<ref name=Cross/>{{rp|1203}} While in his pre-Pelagian writings Augustine taught that Adam's guilt as transmitted to his descendants much enfeebles, though does not destroy, the freedom of their will, Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin affirmed that Original Sin completely destroyed liberty (see [[total depravity]]).<ref name=Cross/>{{rp|1200\u20131204}}\n\nAccording to [[Leo Ruickbie]], Augustine's arguments against [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], differentiating it from miracle, were crucial in the early Church's fight against [[paganism]] and became a central thesis in the later denunciation of witches and [[witchcraft]]. According to Professor Deepak Lal, Augustine's vision of the heavenly city has influenced the secular projects and traditions of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], [[Marxism]], [[Freudianism]] and eco-fundamentalism.<ref name=\"Deepak Lal\">Lal, D.

[[Hannah Arendt]], an influential 20th-century political theorist, wrote her doctoral dissertation in philosophy on Augustine, and continued to rely on his thought throughout her career. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] extensively quotes Augustine in ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' for his approach to language, both admiringly, and as a sparring partner to develop his own ideas, including an extensive opening passage from the ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]''. Contemporary linguists have argued that Augustine has significantly influenced the thought of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who did not 'invent' the modern discipline of [[semiotics]], but rather built upon [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and Neoplatonist knowledge from the Middle Ages, via an Augustinian connection: \"as for the constitution of Saussurian semiotic theory, the importance of the Augustinian thought contribution (correlated to the Stoic one) has also been recognized. Saussure did not do anything but reform an ancient theory in Europe, according to the modern conceptual exigencies.\"<ref>Munteanu, E.

Acting also demands an ability to employ [[dialect]]s, [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]], [[improvisational theatre|improvisation]], observation and emulation, [[Mime artist|mime]], and [[stage combat]]. Many actors train at length in specialist programmes or colleges to develop these skills. The vast majority of professional actors have undergone extensive training. Actors and actresses will often have many instructors and teachers for a full range of training involving singing, scene-work, audition techniques, and acting for [[camera]].\n\nMost [[History of theatre|early sources]] in the [[Western culture|West]] that examine the [[art]] of acting ({{lang-grc-gre|\u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}, ''hypokrisis'') discuss it as part of [[rhetoric]].<ref>Csapo and Slater (1994, 257); ''hypokrisis'', which literally means \"acting,\" was the word used in discussions of [[rhetoric]]al delivery.</ref>\n\n== History of acting ==<!--''History of acting'' redirects here. Do not remove this heading. Thank you.-->\n{{Main|History of theatre}}\n\n===The first actor===\n\nOne of the first known [[actor]]s is believed to have been an [[Classical Greece|ancient Greek]] called [[Thespis]] of [[Icaria]]. Writing two centuries after the event, [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' ({{circa|335 BCE}}) suggests that Thespis stepped out of the [[dithyramb]]ic [[Greek chorus|chorus]] and addressed it as a separate [[Character (arts)|character]]. Before Thespis, the chorus [[Narration|narrated]] (for example, \"Dionysus did this, Dionysus said that\"). When Thespis stepped out from the chorus, he spoke as if he was the character (for example, \"I am Dionysus, I did this\"). To distinguish between these different [[Mode (literature)|modes]] of storytelling\u2014enactment and narration\u2014Aristotle uses the terms \"[[mimesis]]\" (via enactment) and \"[[diegesis]]\" (via narration). From Thespis' name derives the word \"thespian\".\n\n==Professional and amateur acting==\n{{Further information|Actor|Amateur theatre}}\nA professional actor is someone who is paid to act. Professional actors sometimes undertake unpaid work for a variety of reasons, including educational purposes or for charity events. [[Amateur theatre|Amateur actors]] are those who do not receive payment for performances.\n\nNot all people working as actors in [[film]], [[television]], or [[theatre]] are professionally trained. [[Bob Hoskins]], for example, had no formal training before becoming an actor.\n\n==Training==\n{{Further information|Drama school}}\n[[File:Student's studio 1915.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the First Studio, with whom [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] began to develop his [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] of actor training, which forms the basis for most professional training in the [[Western culture|West]].]]\nConservatories and [[drama school]]s typically offer two- to four-year training on all aspects of acting. Universities mostly offer three- to four-year programs, in which a student is often able to choose to focus on acting, whilst continuing to learn about other aspects of [[theatre]]. Schools vary in their approach, but in North America the most popular method taught derives from the [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], which was developed and popularised in America as [[method acting]] by [[Lee Strasberg]], [[Stella Adler]], [[Sanford Meisner]], and others.\n\nOther approaches may include a more physically based orientation, such as that promoted by [[theatre practitioner]]s as diverse as [[Anne Bogart]], [[Jacques Lecoq]], [[Jerzy Grotowski]], or [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]]. Classes may also include [[psychotechnique]], [[mask]] work, [[physical theatre]], [[improvisation]], and acting for camera.\n\nRegardless of a school's approach, students should expect intensive training in textual interpretation, voice, and movement. Applications to drama programmes and conservatories usually involve extensive [[Audition (performing arts)|auditions]]. Anybody over the age of 18 can usually apply. Training may also start at a very young age. Acting classes and professional schools targeted at under-18s are widespread. These classes introduce young actors to different aspects of acting and theatre, including scene study.\n\nIncreased training and exposure to [[public speaking]] allows humans to maintain calmer and more relaxed [[physiologically]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zuardi|last2=Crippa|last3=Gorayeb|title=Human experimental anxiety: actual public speaking induces more intense physiological responses than simulated public speaking.|journal=Sci Elo Brazil|date=2012|volume=35|issue=3|pages=248\u2013253|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462013000300248&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en|accessdate=2017-03-13|doi=10.1590/1516-4446-2012-0930}}</ref> By measuring a public speaker\u2019s [[heart rate]] maybe one of the easiest ways to judge shifts in [[Psychological stress|stress]] as the heart rate increases with anxiety .

Most notable is its use by the troupes of the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'', a form of [[mask]]ed comedy that originated in Italy.\n\nImprovisation as an approach to acting formed an important part of the Russian [[theatre practitioner]] [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] of actor training, which he developed from the 1910s onwards. Late in 1910, the playwright [[Maxim Gorky]] invited Stanislavski to join him in [[Capri]], where they discussed training and Stanislavski's emerging \"grammar\" of acting.<ref>Benedetti (1999, 203) and Magarshack (1950, 320).</ref> Inspired by a popular theatre performance in [[Naples]] that utilised the techniques of the ''commedia dell'arte'', Gorky suggested that they form a company, modelled on the [[Medieval theatre|medieval strolling players]], in which a playwright and group of young actors would [[Devised theatre|devise]] new plays together by means of improvisation.<ref>Benedetti (1999, 203-204) and Magarshack (1950, 320-321).</ref> Stanislavski would develop this use of improvisation in his work with his First Studio of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]].<ref>Benedetti (1999, 204) and Magarshack (1950, 320-322, 332-333).</ref> Stanislavski's use was extended further in the approaches to acting developed by his students, [[Michael Chekhov]] and [[Maria Knebel]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the use of improvisation was pioneered by [[Joan Littlewood]] from the 1930s onwards and, later, by [[Keith Johnstone]] and Clive Barker. In the United States, it was promoted by [[Viola Spolin]], after working with [[Neva Boyd]] at a Hull House in Chicago, Illinois (Spolin was Boyd's student from 1924 to 1927). Like the British practitioners, Spolin felt that playing games was a useful means of training actors and helped to improve an actor's performance. With improvisation, she argued, people may find expressive freedom, since they do not know how an improvised situation will turn out. Improvisation demands an open mind in order to maintain spontaneity, rather than pre-planning a response. A character is created by the actor, often without reference to a dramatic text, and a drama is developed out of the spontenous interactions with other actors. This approach to creating new drama has been developed most substantially by the British filmmaker [[Mike Leigh]], in films such as ''[[Secrets & Lies (film)|Secrets & Lies]]'' (1996), ''[[Vera Drake]]'' (2004), ''[[Another Year (film)|Another Year]]'' (2010), and ''[[Mr. Turner]]'' (2014).\n\nImprovisation is also used to cover up if an actor or actress makes a mistake.\n\n==Physiological effects==\nSpeaking or acting in front of an audience is a stressful situation, which causes an increased heart rate<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin, Clevenger|first1=T|title=Effect of Speakers' Sex and size of audience on heart-rate changes during short impromptu speeches|journal=Psychological Reports|date=1980|accessdate=|doi=10.2466/pr0.1980.46.1.123}}</ref>(Baldwin, 1980 <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lacey|title=Coronary vasoconstriction induced by mental stress (simulated public speaking|journal=The American Journal of Cardiology|date=1995|volume=75|pages=503\u2013505|accessdate=|doi=10.1016/s0002-9149(99)80590-6}}</ref> Lacey, 1995).\n\nIn a 2017 study on American university students, actors of various experience levels all showed similarly elevated heart rates throughout their performances; this agrees with previous studies on professional and amateur actors' heart rates<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Konijin|title=What\u2019s on between the actor and his audience? Empirical Analysis of emotion processes in the theatre}}</ref>(Konijin,1993). While all actors experienced stress, causing elevated heart rate, the more experienced actors displayed less heart rate variability than the less experienced actors in the same play. The more experienced actors experienced less stress while performing, and therefore had a smaller degree of variability than the less experienced, more stressed actors. The more experienced an actor is, the more stable their heart rate will be while performing, but will still experience elevated heart rates.\n\n==Semiotics of acting==\n[[File:Brehms Tierleben - allgemeine Kunde des Tierreichs (1911-1921) (20226745749).jpg|thumb|right|[[Antonin Artaud]] compared the effect of an actor's performance on an audience in his \"[[Theatre of Cruelty]]\" with the way in which a [[Snake charming|snake charmer]] affects snakes.]]\nThe [[semiotics]] of acting involves a study of the ways in which aspects of a performance come to operate for its audience as [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]]s. This process largely involves the production of meaning, whereby elements of an actor's performance acquire significance, both within the broader context of the dramatic action and in the relations each establishes with the real world.\n\nFollowing the ideas proposed by the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] theorist [[Antonin Artaud]], however, it may also be possible to understand communication with an audience that occurs 'beneath' significance and meaning (which the semiotician [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]] described as a process involving the transmission of \"a-signifying signs\"). In his ''[[The Theatre and its Double]]'' (1938), Artaud compared this interaction to the way in which a [[Snake charming|snake charmer]] communicates with a snake, a process which he identified as \"[[mimesis]]\"\u2014the same term that [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE) used to describe the [[Mode (literature)|mode]] in which [[drama]] communicates its story, by virtue of its embodiment by the actor enacting it, as distinct from \"[[diegesis]]\", or the way in which a [[Narration|narrator]] may describe it. These \"vibrations\" passing from the actor to the audience may not necessarily precipiate into significant elements as such (that is, consciously perceived \"meanings\"), but rather may operate by means of the circulation of \"[[Affect (philosophy)|affect]]s\".\n\nThe approach to acting adopted by other [[theatre practitioners]] involve varying degrees of concern with the semiotics of acting. [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], for example, addresses the ways in which an actor, building on what he calls the \"experiencing\" of a role, should also shape and adjust a performance in order to support the overall significance of the drama\u2014a process that he calls establishing the \"perspective of the role\". The semiotics of acting plays a far more central role in [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s [[epic theatre]], in which an actor is concerned to bring out clearly the sociohistorical significance of behaviour and action by means of specific performance choices\u2014a process that he describes as establishing the \"[[Not / But|not/but]]\" element in a performed physical \"''[[gestus]]''\" within context of the play's overal \"''[[Fabel]]''\". [[Eugenio Barba]] argues that actors ought not to concern themselves with the significance of their performance behaviour; this aspect is the responsibility, he claims, of the [[theatre director|director]], who weaves the signifying elements of an actor's performance into the director's [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] \"montage\".\n\nThe theatre semiotician [[Patrice Pavis]], alluding to the contrast between [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavski's 'system']] and Brecht's [[Demonstration (acting)|demonstrating]] performer\u2014and, beyond that, to [[Denis Diderot]]'s foundational essay on the art of acting, ''[[Paradox of the Actor]]'' (c. 1770\u201478)\u2014argues that:\n<blockquote>Acting was long seen in terms of the actor's sincerity or hypocrisy\u2014should he believe in what he is saying and be moved by it, or should he distance himself and convey his role in a detached manner? The answer varies according to how one sees the effect to be produced in the audience and the social function of theatre.<ref name=pavis7>Pavis (1998, 7).</ref></blockquote>\n\nElements of a semiotics of acting include the actor's gestures, facial expressions, intonation and other vocal qualities, rhythm, and the ways in which these aspects of an individual performance relate to the drama and the theatrical event (or film, television programme, or radio broadcast, each of which involves different semiotic systems) considered as a whole.<ref name=\"pavis7\"/> A semiotics of acting recognises that all forms of acting involve [[Dramatic convention|conventions]] and [[Code (semiotics)|codes]] by means of which performance behaviour acquires significance\u2014including those approaches, such as Stanislvaski's or the closely related [[method acting]] developed in the United States, that offer themselves as \"a natural kind of acting that can do without conventions and be received as self-evident and universal.\"<ref name=pavis7/> Pavis goes on to argue that:\n<blockquote>Any acting is based on a codified system (even if the audience does not see it as such) of behaviour and actions that are considered to be believable and realistic or artificial and theatrical. To advocate the natural, the spontaneous, and the instinctive is only to attempt to produce natural effects, governed by an [[Ideology|ideological]] code that determines, at a particular historical time, and for a given audience, what is natural and believable and what is [[Declamation|declamatory]] and theatrical.<ref name=pavis7/></blockquote>\nThe conventions that govern acting in general are related to structured forms of [[Play (activity)|play]], which involve, in each specific experience, \"[[Game|rules of the game]].\"<ref name=pavis8-9>Pavis (1998, 8-9).</ref> This aspect was first explored by [[Johan Huizinga]] (in ''[[Homo Ludens]]'', 1938) and [[Roger Caillois]] (in ''[[Man, Play and Games]]'', 1958).<ref>Pavis (1998, 8).</ref> Caillois, for example, distinguishes four apects of play relevant to acting: ''[[mimesis]]'' ([[simulation]]), ''[[agon]]'' ([[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]] or competition), ''[[Alea (Greek soldier)|alea]]'' ([[Indeterminism|chance]]), and ''illinx'' ([[vertigo]], or \"vertiginous psychological situations\" involving the spectator's [[Identification (literature)|identification]] or [[catharsis]]).<ref name=pavis8-9/> This connection with play as an activity was first proposed by Aristotle in his ''Poetics'', in which he defines the desire to imitate in play as an essential part of being human and our first means of [[Child development|learning as children]]:\n<blockquote>For it is an instinct of human beings, from childhood, to engage in [[mimesis]] (indeed, this distinguishes them from other animals: man is the most mimetic of all, and it is through mimesis that he develops his earliest understanding); and equally natural that everyone enjoys mimetic objects. (IV, 1448b)<ref>Halliwell (1995, 37).</ref></blockquote>\nThis connection with play also informed the words used in English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages) for [[drama]]: the word \"[[Play (theatre)|play]]\" or \"game\" (translating the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''pl\u00e8ga'' or [[Latin]] ''ludus'') was the standard term used until [[William Shakespeare]]'s time for a dramatic entertainment\u2014just as its creator was a \"play-maker\" rather than a \"dramatist\", the person acting was known as a \"player\", and, when in the [[Elizabethan era]] specific buildings for acting were built, they was known as \"play-houses\" rather than \"[[Theater (building)|theatres]].\"<ref>Wickham (1959, 32\u201441; 1969, 133; 1981, 68\u201469). The sense of the creator of plays as a \"maker\" rather than a \"writer\" is preserved in the word \"[[playwright]].\" [[The Theatre]], one of the first purpose-built playhouses in London, was \"a self-conscious [[latin]]ism to describe one particular playhouse\" rather than a term for the buildings in general (1967, 133). The word 'dramatist' \"was at that time still unknown in the English language\" (1981, 68).</ref>\n\n== Resume and Auditioning ==\nActors and actresses need to make a resume <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyactor.com/acting-resume/|title=How To Make An Acting Resume That Works For You|work=Daily Actor|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}</ref> when they go to auditions, similarly to when people of other occupations go into an interview. The acting resume is very different from the normal resume, it has a lot less information on it with lists, instead of paragraphs and it should have the head shot <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.backstage.com/backstage-guides/everything-you-need-know-about-headshots/|title=Headshots: Everything You Need to Know|work=Backstage.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}</ref> on the back.\n\nAuditioning is the act of performing either a monologue <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/monologue|title=the definition of monologue|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}</ref> or sides <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.youryoungactor.com/2009/12/04/what-are-the-sides-for-acting-auditions-acting-term-of-the-day/|title=What Are the Sides for Acting Auditions? (Showbiz Term of the Day)|website=www.youryoungactor.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}</ref> the casting director either mails or emails to the actors right before your audition. Auditioning entails showing the skills the actors have to instantly turn into a completely different person within a two-minute frame period.  For theater auditions it can be longer than two minutes or they can perform more than one monologue, each casting director can have different requirements for actors. For auditions, actors will have to go dressed similarly to the character they are auditioning for to make it easier for the casting director to visualize them as the character. For television or film they will have to undergo more than one audition, if the casting director chooses to put them forward into the process. Oftentimes actors are called into another audition last minute and will send them the sides either the morning of or the night before. Auditioning can be part of the stressful side to acting, especially if one is not trained to audition.\n\n== Rehearsing ==\n[[Rehearsal]] is a process in which actors prepare and practice a performance, exploring the vicissitudes of [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]] between [[Character (arts)|character]]s, testing specific actions in the scene, and finding means to convey a particular sense. Some actors continue to rehearse a scene throughout the run of a show in order to keep the scene fresh in their minds and exciting for the audience.\n\n== Audience and the actor ==\nA critical audience with evaluative spectators is known to induce stress on actors during performance,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bode|first1=D|last2=Brutten|first2=E|title=A palmar sweat investigation of the effect of audience variation upon stage fright|journal=Speech Monographs|date=1963|issue=30|pages=92\u201396}}</ref> (see Bode & Brutten) and an actor will typically rate the quality of their performance higher than their spectators.<ref>{{cite book|author1=ELLY KONIJN|editor1-last=WILSON|editor1-first=GLENN|title=PSYCHOLOGY AND PERFORMING ARTS|date=1991|publisher=SWETS & ZEITLINGER|location=AMSTERDAM}}</ref> Heart rates are generally always higher during a performance with an audience when compared to rehearsal, however what's interesting is that this audience also seems to induce a higher quality of performance.  Simply put, while public performances cause extremely high stress levels in actors (more so amateur ones), the stress actually improves the performance, supporting the idea of \"positive stress in challenging situations\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Richard S. Lazarus|author2=Susan Folkman|title=stress, appraisial and coping|date=March 15, 1984|publisher=New York Springer}}</ref>\n\n== Heart rate while acting ==\nDepending on what an actor is doing, his or her heart rate will vary. This is the body's way of responding to stress. Prior to a show one will see an increase in heart rate due to anxiety. While performing an actor has an increased sense of exposure which will increase [[performance anxiety]] and the associated physiological arousal, such as heart rate.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">{{cite journal|last1=Yoshie|first1=M|title=Music performance anxiety in skilled pianists: effects of social-evaluative performance situation on subjective, autonomic, and electromyographic reactions|pmid=19701628|doi=10.1007/s00221-009-1979-y|volume=199|year=2009|journal=Exp Brain Res|pages=117\u201326}}</ref> Heart rates increases more during shows compared to rehearsals because of the increased pressure, which is due to the fact that a performance has a potentially greater impact on an actors career.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>  After the show you will see a decrease in the heart rate due to the conclusion of the stress inducing activity.

Actors claim that having an audience has no change in their stress level, but as soon as they come on stage their heart-rate rises quickly.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Konijin|first1=Elly A.|title=What's On Between The Actor and His Audience|page=65}}</ref> A 2017 study done in an American University looking at actors' stress by measuring heart-rate showed individual heart-rates rose right before the performance began for those actors opening. There are many [[Factor analysis|factors]] that can add to an actors' stress. For example, length of monologues, experience level,  and actions done on stage including moving the set. Throughout the performance heart-rate rises the most before an actor is speaking. The stress and thus heart-rate of the actor then drops significantly at the end of a monologue, big action scene, or performance.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin and Clevenger Jr.|first1=Sandra F. and Theodore|title=Effect of Speakers' Sex and Size of Audience On Heart-Rate Changes During Short Impromptu Speeches}}</ref> This idea of getting stressed during the anticipation period for any big moment happening is applied throughout the performance. Stress, therefore, has a bigger impact on the actor's overall performance whether motivating or pressuring them to give a more proficient end performance.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Biomechanics (Meyerhold)|Biomechanics]]\n* [[Meisner technique]]\n* [[Method acting]]\n* [[Presentational and representational acting]]\n* [[Stanislavski's system]]\n* [[Viewpoints]]\n* [[Lists of actors]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n* [[Richard Boleslavsky|Boleslavsky, Richard]]. 1933 ''Acting: the First Six Lessons''.

This behavior frequently led to conflict between Athens and the less powerful members of the League. By 431 BC, Athens' heavy-handed control of the Delian League prompted the outbreak of the [[Peloponnesian War]]; the League was dissolved upon the war's conclusion in 404 BC under the direction of [[Lysander]], the [[Sparta]]n commander.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main article|Greco-Persian Wars}}\n\nThe Greco-Persian Wars had their roots in the conquest of the Greek cities of [[Asia Minor]], and particularly [[Ionia]], by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]] of [[Cyrus the Great]] shortly after 550 BC. The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule, eventually settling for sponsoring a [[tyrant]] in each Ionian city.<ref name = h147>Holland, Tom.

However, in a decision of great historic significance, the Persian king [[Darius the Great]] decided that, despite having subdued the revolt, there remained the unfinished business of exacting punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt.<ref name = h175>Holland, pp. 175\u201377</ref> The Ionian revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius's empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with.

During the [[First Persian invasion of Greece|first invasion]], [[Thrace]], [[Macedon]] and the [[Aegean Islands]] were added to the Persian Empire, and Eretria was duly destroyed.<ref name = h183>Holland, pp. 183\u201386</ref> However, the invasion ended in 490 BC with the decisive Athenian victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]].<ref name = h187>Holland, pp. 187\u201394</ref> Between the two invasions, Darius died, and responsibility for the war passed to his son [[Xerxes I]].<ref name = h202>Holland, pp. 202\u201303</ref>\n\nXerxes then personally led a [[second Persian invasion of Greece]] in 480 BC, taking an enormous (although oft-exaggerated) army and navy to Greece.<ref name = h240>Holland, pp. 240\u201344</ref> Those Greeks who chose to resist (the 'Allies') were defeated in the twin simultaneous battles of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] on land and [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]] at sea.<ref name = h276>Holland, pp. 276\u201381</ref> All of Greece except the [[Peloponnesus]] thus having fallen into Persian hands, the Persians then seeking to destroy the Allied navy once and for all, suffered a decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Salamis]].<ref name=h320>Holland, pp. 320\u201326</ref> The following year, 479 BC, the Allies assembled the largest Greek army yet seen and defeated the Persian invasion force at the [[Battle of Plataea]], ending the invasion and the threat to Greece.<ref name=h342>Holland, pp. 342\u201355</ref>\n\nThe Allied fleet defeated the remnants of the Persian fleet in the [[Battle of Mycale]] near the islands of Salamis\u2014on the same day as Plataea, according to tradition.<ref name=h357>Holland, pp. 357\u201358</ref> This action marks the end of the Persian invasion, and the beginning of the next phase in the Greco-Persian wars, [[Greco-Persian Wars#Greek counterattack|the Greek counterattack]].<ref>Lazenby, p. 247</ref> After Mycale, the Greek cities of Asia Minor again revolted, with the Persians now powerless to stop them.<ref name = TI89>Thucydides [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200;query=chapter%3D%2389;layout=;loc=1.88.1 I, 89]</ref> The Allied fleet then sailed to the [[Thracian Chersonese]], still held by the Persians, and besieged and captured the town of [[Sestos]].<ref name = IX114>Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231570;layout=;loc=9.115.1 IX, 114]</ref> The following year, 478 BC, the Allies sent a force to capture the city of [[Byzantion]] (modern day [[Istanbul]]).

The Spartans were of the view that, with the liberation of mainland Greece, and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that establishing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible.<ref name = h362/> In the aftermath of Mycale, the Spartan king [[Leotychidas]] had proposed transplanting all the Greeks from Asia Minor to Europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from Persian dominion.<ref name = h362>Holland, p. 362</ref>\n\nXanthippus, the Athenian commander at Mycale, had furiously rejected this; the Ionian cities had been Athenian colonies, and the Athenians, if no-one else, would protect the Ionians.<ref name = h362>Holland, p. 362</ref> This marked the point at which the leadership of the Greek alliance effectively passed to the Athenians.<ref name = h362/> With the Spartan withdrawal after Byzantion, the leadership of the Athenians became explicit.\n\nThe loose alliance of city states which had fought against Xerxes's invasion had been dominated by Sparta and the [[Peloponnesian league]]. With the withdrawal of these states, a congress was called on the holy island of [[Delos]] to institute a new alliance to continue the fight against the Persians; hence the modern designation \"Delian League\". According to Thucydides, the official aim of the League was to \"avenge the wrongs they suffered by ravaging the territory of the king.\"<ref name = TI96>Thucydides I, 96</ref>\n\nIn reality, this goal was divided into three main efforts\u2014to prepare for future invasion, to seek revenge against Persia, and to organize a means of dividing spoils of war. The members were given a choice of either offering armed forces or paying a tax to the joint treasury; most states chose the tax.<ref name = TI96/> League members swore to have the same friends and enemies, and dropped ingots of iron into the sea to symbolize the permanence of their alliance. The Athenian politician [[Aristides]] would spend the rest of his life occupied in the affairs of the alliance, dying (according to [[Plutarch]]) a few years later in Pontus, whilst determining what the tax of new members was to be.<ref>Plutarch, Aristeides 26</ref>\n\n==Members==\n{{main article|Members of the Delian League}}\n\n==Composition and expansion==\n[[Image:Athenian empire atheight 450 shepherd1923.png|thumb|300px|The Athenian Empire at its height, c. 450 BC]]\n\nIn the first ten years of the league's existence, [[Cimon|Cimon/Kimon]] forced [[Karystos]] in [[Euboea]] to join the league, conquered the island of [[Skyros]] and sent Athenian colonists there.<ref>Thucydides I.98</ref>\n\nOver time, especially with the suppression of rebellions, Athens exercised [[hegemony]] over the rest of the league. [[Thucydides]] describes how Athens's control over the League grew:\n<blockquote> Of all the causes of defection, that connected with arrears of tribute and vessels, and with failure of service, was the chief; for the Athenians were very severe and exacting, and made themselves offensive by applying the screw of necessity to men who were not used to and in fact not disposed for any continuous labor. In some other respects the Athenians were not the old popular rulers they had been at first; and if they had more than their fair share of service, it was correspondingly easy for them to reduce any that tried to leave the confederacy. The Athenians also arranged for the other members of the league to pay its share of the expense in money instead of in ships and men, and for this the subject city-states had themselves to blame, their wish to get out of giving service making most leave their homes. Thus while Athens was increasing her navy with the funds they contributed, a revolt always found itself without enough resources or experienced leaders for war.<ref>Thucydides i. 99</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Rebellion==\n\n===Naxos===\nThe first member of the league to attempt to secede was the island of [[Naxos Island|Naxos]] in c. 471 BC.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brand|first=Peter J |title=Athens & Sparta: Democracy vs. Dictatorship}}</ref>  After being defeated, Naxos is believed (based on similar, later revolts) to have been forced to tear down its walls along with losing its fleet and vote in the League.\n\n===Thasos===\n{{main article|Thasian rebellion}}\n\nIn 465 BC, Athens founded the colony of [[Amphipolis]] on the Strymon river. [[Thasos]], a member of the League, saw her interests in the mines of Mt. Pangaion threatened and defected from the League to Persia. She called to Sparta for assistance but was denied, as Sparta was facing the largest [[Helots|helot]] revolution in its history.<ref>Thucydides I, 100</ref>\n\nAfter more than two years of siege, Thasos surrendered to the Athenian leader [[Cimon]] and was forced back into the league. As a result, the fortification walls of Thasos were torn down, and they had to pay yearly tribute and fines. Additionally, their land, naval ships, and the mines of Thasos were confiscated by Athens. The siege of Thasos marks the transformation of the Delian league from an alliance into, in the words of Thucydides, a [[hegemony]].<ref>Thucydides 101</ref>\n\n==Policies of the League==\nIn 461 BC, Cimon was [[ostracism|ostracized]] and was succeeded in his influence by democrats such as [[Ephialtes]] and Pericles. This signaled a complete change in Athenian foreign policy, neglecting the alliance with the Spartans and instead allying with her enemies, [[Argos]] and [[Thessaly]]. [[Megara]] deserted the Spartan-led [[Peloponnesian League]] and allied herself with Athens, allowing construction of a double line of walls across the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] and protecting Athens from attack from that quarter. Roughly a decade earlier, due to encouragement from influential speaker [[Themistocles]], the Athenians had also constructed the [[Long Walls]] connecting their city to the [[Piraeus]], its port, making it effectively invulnerable to attack by land.\n\nIn 454 BC, the Athenian general [[Pericles]] moved the Delian League's treasury from Delos to Athens, allegedly to keep it safe from Persia. However, [[Plutarch]] indicates that many of Pericles' rivals viewed the transfer to Athens as usurping monetary resources to fund elaborate building projects. Athens also switched from accepting ships, men and weapons as dues from league members, to only accepting money.\n\nThe new treasury established in Athens was used for many purposes, not all relating to the defence of members of the league. It was from tribute paid to the league that Pericles set to building the [[Parthenon]] on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], replacing an older temple, as well as many other non-defense related expenditures. The Delian League was turning from an alliance into an empire.\n\n==Wars against Persia==\n{{Main article|Wars of the Delian League}}\n\nWar with the Persians continued. In 460 BC, [[Egypt]] revolted under local leaders the Hellenes called [[Inaros II|Inaros]] and [[Amyrtaeus]], who requested aid from Athens. Pericles led 250 ships, intended to attack [[Cyprus]], to their aid because it would further damage Persia. After four years, however, the Egyptian rebellion was defeated by the Achaemenid general [[Megabyzus]], who captured the greater part of the Athenian forces. In fact, according to Isocrates, the Athenians and their allies lost some 20,000 men in the expedition, while modern estimates place the figure at 50,000 men and 250 ships including reinforcements.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From the earliest times to the Battle of Lepanto|last=Fuller|first=John|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1954|isbn=|location=|pages=56}}</ref> The remainder escaped to [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] and thence returned home.\n\nThis was the Athenians' main (public) reason for moving the treasury of the League from Delos to Athens, further consolidating their control over the League. The Persians followed up their victory by sending a fleet to re-establish their control over [[Cyprus]], and 200 ships were sent out to counter them under [[Cimon]], who returned from [[ostracism]] in 451 BC. He died during the blockade of [[Citium]], though the fleet won a double victory by land and sea over the Persians off [[Salamis, Cyprus]].\n\nThis battle was the last major one fought against the Persians. Many writers report that a peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Callias]], was formalized in 450 BC, but some writers believe that the treaty was a myth created later to inflate the stature of Athens. However, an understanding was definitely reached, enabling the Athenians to focus their attention on events in Greece proper.\n\n==Wars in Greece==\nSoon, [[First Peloponnesian War|war with the Peloponnesians]] broke out. In 458 BC, the Athenians blockaded the island of [[Aegina]], and simultaneously defended Megara from the Corinthians by sending out an army composed of those too young or old for regular military service. The following year, Sparta sent an army into [[Boeotia]], reviving the power of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] in order to help hold the Athenians in check. Their return was blocked, and they resolved to march on Athens, where the Long Walls were not yet completed, winning a victory at the [[Battle of Tanagra (457 BC)|Battle of Tanagra]]. All this accomplished, however, was to allow them to return home via the Megarid. Two months later, the Athenians under [[Myronides]] invaded Boeotia, and winning the [[Battle of Oenophyta]] gained control of the whole country except Thebes.\n\nReverses followed peace with Persia in 449 BC. The [[battle of Coronea (447 BC)|Battle of Coronea]], in 447 BC, led to the abandonment of Boeotia. [[Euboea]] and Megara revolted, and while the former was restored to its status as a tributary ally, the latter was a permanent loss. The Delian and Peloponnesian Leagues signed a peace treaty, which was set to endure for thirty years. It only lasted until 431 BC, when the [[Peloponnesian War]] broke out.\n\nThose who revolted unsuccessfully during the war saw the example made of the [[Mytilene|Mytilenians]], the principal people on [[Lesbos]]. After an unsuccessful revolt, the Athenians ordered the death of the entire male population. After some thought, they rescinded this order, and only put to death the leading 1000 ringleaders of the revolt, and redistributed the land of the entire island to Athenian shareholders, who were sent out to reside on Lesbos.\n\nThis type of treatment was not reserved solely for those who revolted. Thucydides documents the example of [[Melos]], a small island, neutral in the war, though founded by Spartans. The Melians were offered a choice to join the Athenians, or be conquered. Choosing to resist, their town was besieged and conquered; the males were put to death and the women sold into slavery (see [[Melian dialogue]]).\n\n==The Athenian Empire (454\u2013404 BC)==\nBy 454 BC, the Delian League could be fairly characterised as an Athenian Empire; a key event of 454 BC was the moving of the treasury of the Delian League from Delos to Athens. This is often seen as a key marker of the transition from alliance to empire, but while it is significant, it is important to view the period as a whole when considering the development of Athenian imperialism, and not to focus on a single event as being the main contributor to it. At the start of the [[Peloponnesian War]], only [[Chios]] and [[Lesbos]] were left to contribute ships, and these states were by now far too weak to secede without support. Lesbos tried to revolt first, and failed completely. Chios, the most powerful of the original members of the Delian League save Athens, was the last to revolt, and in the aftermath of the [[Syracusan Expedition]] enjoyed success for several years, inspiring all of [[Ionia]] to revolt. Athens was nonetheless eventually able to suppress these revolts.\n\nTo further strengthen Athens' grip on its empire, Pericles in 450 BC began a policy of establishing ''[[Cleruchy|kleruchiai]]''\u2014quasi-colonies that remained tied to Athens and which served as garrisons to maintain control of the League's vast territory. Furthermore, Pericles employed a number of offices to maintain Athens' empire: ''[[proxeny|proxenoi]]'', who fostered good relations between Athens and League members; ''episkopoi'' and ''[[archont]]es'', who oversaw the collection of tribute; and ''[[hellenotamiai]]'', who received the tribute on Athens' behalf.\n\nAthens' empire was not very stable and after 27 years of war, the Spartans, aided by the Persians and Athenian internal strife, were able to defeat it. However it did not remain defeated for long. The [[Second Athenian League]], a maritime self-defense league, was founded in 377 BC and was led by Athens. The Athenians would never recover the full extent of their power, and their enemies were now far stronger and more varied.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Greece}}\n* [[Athenian democracy]]\n* [[Pentecontaetia]]\n* [[Hellenic civilization]]\n* [[Zone (colony)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Jack Martin Balcer (ed.): ''Studien zum Attischen Seebund''.

His new firm was initially called ''Horch Automobil-Werke GmbH'', but following a legal dispute over the ''Horch'' name, he decided to make another automobile company.  (The court decided that ''Horch'' was a registered trademark on behalf of August Horch's former partners and August Horch was not entitled to use it any more). Consequently, Horch named his new company ''[[Audi Automobilwerke GmbH]]'' in 1910, ''Audi'' being the Latinization of Horch.\n\n==Post Audi==\nHorch left Audi in 1920 and went to Berlin and took various jobs.

Most modern [[helicopter]]s now have budget splits of 60/40 in favour of avionics. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe civilian market has also seen a growth in cost of avionics. Flight control systems ([[fly-by-wire]]) and new navigation needs brought on by tighter airspaces, have pushed up development costs. The major change has been the recent boom in consumer flying.

Each channel is spaced from the adjacent ones by 8.33&nbsp;kHz in Europe, 25&nbsp;kHz elsewhere. VHF is also used for line of sight communication such as aircraft-to-aircraft and aircraft-to-ATC. [[Amplitude modulation]] (AM) is used, and the conversation is performed in [[Simplex communication|simplex]] mode.  Aircraft communication can also take place using HF (especially for trans-oceanic flights) or satellite communication.\n\n{{see also|Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System}}\n\n===Navigation===\n\n{{main|Air navigation}}\n[[Air navigation]] is the determination of position and direction on or above the surface of the Earth. Avionics can use [[satellite navigation]] systems (such as [[GPS]] and [[WAAS]]), ground-based [[radio navigation]] systems (such as [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] or [[LORAN]]), or any combination thereof. Navigation systems calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on moving map displays. Older avionics required a pilot or navigator to plot the intersection of signals on a paper map to determine an aircraft's location; modern systems calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on moving map displays.\n\n===Monitoring===\n\n{{main|Glass cockpit}}\n[[File:Airbus A380 cockpit.jpg|thumb|The Airbus A380 glass cockpit featuring pull-out keyboards and two wide computer screens on the sides for pilots.]] The first hints of [[glass cockpit]]s emerged in the 1970s when flight-worthy [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) screens began to replace electromechanical displays, gauges and instruments. A \"glass\" cockpit refers to the use of computer monitors instead of gauges and other analog displays. Aircraft were getting progressively more displays, dials and information dashboards that eventually competed for space and pilot attention. In the 1970s, the average aircraft had more than 100 cockpit instruments and controls.<ref name=\"three\">''Avionics: Development and Implementation'' by Cary R. Spitzer (Hardcover \u2013 December 15, 2006)</ref>\n\nGlass cockpits started to come into being with the [[Gulfstream Aerospace|Gulfstream]] G\u2011IV private jet in 1985. One of the key challenges in glass cockpits is to balance how much control is automated and how much the pilot should do manually. Generally they try to automate flight operations while keeping the pilot constantly informed.<ref name=\"three\"/>\n\n===Aircraft flight-control system===\n\n{{main|Aircraft flight control system}}\nAircraft have means of automatically controlling flight. [[Autopilot]] was first invented by [[Lawrence Sperry]] during [[World War&nbsp;I]] to fly bomber planes steady enough to hit accurate targets from 25,000 feet. When it was first adopted by the [[U.S.&nbsp;military]], a [[Honeywell Aerospace|Honeywell]] engineer sat in the back seat with bolt cutters to disconnect the autopilot in case of emergency. Nowadays most commercial planes are equipped with aircraft flight control systems in order to reduce pilot error and workload at landing or takeoff.<ref name=\"two\">By Jeffrey L. Rodengen. {{ISBN|0-945903-25-1}}. Published by Write Stuff Syndicate, Inc. in 1995. \"The Legend of Honeywell.\"</ref>\n\nThe first simple commercial auto-pilots were used to control [[Aircraft heading|heading]] and altitude and had limited authority on things like [[thrust]] and [[flight control]] surfaces. In [[helicopter]]s, auto-stabilization was used in a similar way. The first systems were electromechanical. The advent of [[fly by wire]] and electro-actuated flight surfaces (rather than the traditional hydraulic) has increased safety. As with displays and instruments, critical devices that were electro-mechanical had a finite life. With safety critical systems, the software is very strictly tested.\n\n===Collision-avoidance systems===\n\n{{main|Aircraft collision avoidance systems}}\nTo supplement [[air traffic control]], most large transport aircraft and many smaller ones use a [[TCAS|traffic alert and collision avoidance system]] (TCAS), which can detect the location of nearby aircraft, and provide instructions for avoiding a midair collision. Smaller aircraft may use simpler traffic alerting systems such as TPAS, which are passive (they do not actively interrogate the [[transponder]]s of other aircraft) and do not provide advisories for conflict resolution.\n\nTo help avoid controlled flight into terrain ([[CFIT]]), aircraft use systems such as [[GPWS|ground-proximity warning systems]] (GPWS), which use radar altimeters as a key element. One of the major weaknesses of GPWS is the lack of \"look-ahead\" information, because it only provides altitude above terrain \"look-down\". In order to overcome this weakness, modern aircraft use a terrain awareness warning system ([[TAWS]]).\n\n===Flight recorders===\n{{Main|Flight recorder}}\n\nCommercial aircraft cockpit data recorders, commonly known as \"black boxes\", store flight information and audio from the [[cockpit]]. They are often recovered from an aircraft after a crash to determine control settings and other parameters during the incident.\n\n===Weather systems===\n{{main|Weather radar|Lightning detector}}\nWeather systems such as [[weather radar]] (typically [[Arinc&nbsp;708]] on commercial aircraft) and [[lightning detector]]s are important for aircraft flying at night or in [[instrument meteorological conditions]], where it is not possible for pilots to see the weather ahead.  Heavy precipitation (as sensed by radar) or severe [[Clear-air turbulence|turbulence]] (as sensed by lightning activity) are both indications of strong convective activity and severe turbulence, and weather systems allow pilots to deviate around these areas.\n\nLightning detectors like the Stormscope or Strikefinder have become inexpensive enough that they are practical for light aircraft. In addition to radar and lightning detection, observations and extended radar pictures (such as [[NEXRAD]]) are now available through satellite data connections, allowing pilots to see weather conditions far beyond the range of their own in-flight systems. Modern displays allow weather information to be integrated with moving maps, terrain, and traffic onto a single screen, greatly simplifying navigation.\n\nModern weather systems also include [[wind shear]] and turbulence detection and terrain and traffic warning systems.<ref name=\"four\">{{cite news\n | last =Ramsey\n | first =James \n | title =Broadening Weather Radar's Scope\n | publisher =Aviation Today\n | date =August 1, 2000\n | url =http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/commercial/Broadening-Weather-Radars-Scope_12786.html\n | accessdate =January 25, 2012 }}</ref> In\u2011plane weather avionics are especially popular in Africa, [[India]], and other countries where air-travel is a growing market, but ground support is not as well developed.<ref>{{cite news\n | last =Fitzsimons\n | first =Bernard\n | title =Honeywell Looks East While Innovating For Safe Growth\n | publisher =Aviation International News\n | date =November 13, 2011\n | url =http://www.ainonline.com/?q=aviation-news/dubai-air-show/2011-11-13/honeywell-looks-east-while-innovating-safe-growth\n | accessdate =December 27, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Aircraft management systems===\nThere has been a progression towards centralized control of the multiple complex systems fitted to aircraft, including engine monitoring and management. [[Health and usage monitoring systems]] (HUMS) are integrated with aircraft management computers to give maintainers early warnings of parts that will need replacement.\n\nThe [[integrated modular avionics]] concept proposes an integrated architecture with application software portable across an assembly of common hardware modules. It has been used in [[fourth generation jet fighter]]s and the latest generation of [[airliner]]s.\n\n==Mission or tactical avionics==\n[[Military aircraft]] have been designed either to deliver a weapon or to be the eyes and ears of other weapon systems. The vast array of sensors available to the military is used for whatever tactical means required. As with aircraft management, the bigger sensor platforms (like the E\u20113D, JSTARS, ASTOR, Nimrod MRA4, Merlin HM Mk 1) have mission-management computers.\n\nPolice and EMS aircraft also carry sophisticated tactical sensors.\n\n===Military communications===\n\nWhile aircraft communications provide the backbone for safe flight, the tactical systems are designed to withstand the rigors of the battle field. [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]], [[Very high frequency|VHF]] Tactical (30\u201388&nbsp;MHz) and SatCom systems combined with [[Electronic counter-countermeasures|ECCM]] methods, and [[cryptography]] secure the communications. Data links such as [[Link 11]], [[Link 16|16]], [[Link 22|22]] and [[Bowman (communications system)|BOWMAN]], [[JTRS]] and even [[TETRA]] provide the means of transmitting data (such as images, targeting information etc.).\n\n===Radar===\n\nAirborne [[radar]] was one of the first tactical sensors. The benefit of altitude providing range has meant a significant focus on airborne radar technologies. Radars include [[airborne early warning]] (AEW), [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW), and even [[weather radar]] ([[Arinc 708]]) and ground tracking/proximity radar.\n\nThe military uses [[Terrain-following radar|radar in fast jets to help pilots fly at low levels]]. While the civil market has had weather radar for a while, there are strict rules about using it to navigate the aircraft.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://avionics.askdefine.com|title=Define avionics {{!}} Dictionary and Thesaurus|website=avionics.askdefine.com|access-date=2017-05-30}}</ref>\n\n===Sonar===\n\nDipping sonar fitted to a range of military helicopters allows the [[helicopter]] to protect shipping assets from submarines or surface threats. Maritime support aircraft can drop active and passive sonar devices ([[sonobuoy]]s) and these are also used to determine the location of enemy submarines.\n\n===Electro-Optics===\nElectro-optic systems include devices such as the [[head-up display]] (HUD), [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR), [[infra-red search and track]] and other passive infrared devices ([[Passive infrared sensor]]). These are all used to provide imagery and information to the flight crew. This imagery is used for everything from search and rescue to [[navigational aid]]s and [[target acquisition]].\n\n===ESM/DAS===\n\nElectronic support measures and defensive aids are used extensively to gather information about threats or possible threats. They can be used to launch devices (in some cases automatically) to counter direct threats against the aircraft. They are also used to determine the state of a threat and identify it.\n\n===Aircraft networks===\nThe avionics systems in military, commercial and advanced models of civilian aircraft are interconnected using an avionics databus. Common avionics databus protocols, with their primary application, include:\n* [[Aircraft Data Network]] ([[Aircraft Data Network|ADN]]): Ethernet derivative for Commercial Aircraft\n* [[AFDX|Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX)]]: Specific implementation of ARINC 664 ([[Aircraft Data Network|ADN]]) for Commercial Aircraft\n* [[ARINC 429]]: Generic Medium-Speed Data Sharing for Private and Commercial Aircraft\n* [[Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet|ARINC 664]]: See ADN above\n* [[ARINC 629]]: Commercial Aircraft (Boeing 777)\n* [[ARINC 708]]: Weather Radar for Commercial Aircraft\n* [[ARINC 717]]: Flight Data Recorder for Commercial Aircraft\n* [[ARINC 825]]: [[CAN bus]] for commercial aircraft (for example Boeing 787 and Airbus A350)\n* [[IEEE 1394b#Military Aircraft|IEEE 1394b]]: Military Aircraft\n* [[MIL-STD-1553]]: Military Aircraft\n* [[MIL-STD-1760]]: Military Aircraft\n* [[Time-Triggered Protocol|TTP]] \u2013 Time-Triggered Protocol: [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]], [[Airbus A380]], Fly-By-Wire Actuation Platforms from Parker Aerospace\n* [[TTEthernet]] \u2013 Time-Triggered Ethernet: [[NASA Orion]] Spacecraft\n\n==See also==\n*[[ACARS]]\n*[[Acronyms and abbreviations in avionics]]\n*[[ARINC]]\n*[[Avionics software]]\n*[[Emergency locator beacon]]\n*[[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station]]\n*[[Flight recorder]]\n*[[Integrated modular avionics]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Avionics: Development and Implementation'' by Cary R.

For the sake of modesty, the goddesses demurred, but the male gods went to witness the sight. Some commented on the beauty of Aphrodite, others remarked that they would eagerly trade places with Ares, but all who were present mocked the two. Once the couple was released, the embarrassed Ares returned to his homeland, Thrace, and Aphrodite went to Paphos.{{refn|group=n|name=\"Odyssey, 8.295\"}}\n\nIn a much later interpolated detail, Ares put the young soldier [[Alectryon (mythology)|Alectryon]] by his door to warn them of Helios's arrival as Helios would tell Hephaestus of Aphrodite's infidelity if the two were discovered, but Alectryon fell asleep on guard duty.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Helios discovered the two and alerted Hephaestus.

During the war, [[Diomedes]] fought with [[Hector]] and saw Ares fighting on the Trojans' side. Diomedes called for his soldiers to fall back slowly (V.590\u2013605).\n\nAthene or Athena, Ares's sister, saw his interference and asked Zeus, his father, for permission to drive Ares away from the battlefield, which Zeus granted (V.711\u2013769). Hera and Athena encouraged Diomedes to attack Ares (V.780\u2013834). Diomedes thrust with his spear at Ares, with Athena driving it home, and Ares's cries made Achaeans and Trojans alike tremble (V.855\u2013864). Ares fled to [[Mt. Olympus]], forcing the Trojans to fall back.\n\nWhen Hera mentioned to [[Zeus]] that Ares's son, Ascalaphus, was killed, Ares overheard and wanted to join the fight on the side of the Achaeans, disregarding Zeus's order that no Olympic god should enter the battle, but Athena stopped him (XV.110\u2013128). Later, when Zeus allowed the gods to fight in the war again (XX.20\u201329), Ares was the first to act, attacking Athena to avenge himself for his previous injury.

He was, however, able to play a dominant role in mathematics for around a decade, gathering a strong school.<ref name=\"artist\">{{cite book |title=The Artist and the Mathematician |author=Amir D. Aczel |date=2009 |publisher=Basic Books}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, he had officially as students [[Michel Demazure]] (who worked on SGA3, on [[group scheme]]s), [[Luc Illusie]] (cotangent complex), [[Michel Raynaud]], [[Jean-Louis Verdier]] (cofounder of the [[derived category]] theory) and [[Pierre Deligne]]. Collaborators on the SGA projects also included [[Michael Artin]] ([[\u00e9tale cohomology]]) and [[Nick Katz]] ([[monodromy theory]] and [[Lefschetz pencil]]s). [[Jean Giraud (mathematician)|Jean Giraud]] worked out [[torsor]] theory extensions of [[nonabelian cohomology]]. Many others were involved.\n\n===\"Golden Age\"===\nAlexander Grothendieck's work during the \"Golden Age\" period at the IH\u00c9S established several unifying themes in [[algebraic geometry]], [[number theory]], [[topology]], [[category theory]] and [[complex analysis]].<ref name=\"Festschrift\"/> His first (pre-IH\u00c9S) discovery in algebraic geometry was the [[Grothendieck\u2013Hirzebruch\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch theorem]], a generalisation of the [[Hirzebruch\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch theorem]] proved algebraically; in this context he also introduced [[K-theory]]. Then, following the programme he outlined in his talk at the 1958 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], he introduced the theory of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], developing it in detail in his ''[[\u00c9l\u00e9ments de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique]]'' (''EGA'') and providing the new more flexible and general foundations for algebraic geometry that has been adopted in the field since that time.<ref name=\"jackson1\"/> He went on to introduce the [[\u00e9tale cohomology]] theory of schemes, providing the key tools for proving the [[Weil conjectures]], as well as [[crystalline cohomology]] and [[algebraic de Rham cohomology]] to complement it. Closely linked to these cohomology theories, he originated [[topos]] theory as a generalisation of topology (relevant also in [[categorical logic]]). He also provided an algebraic definition of [[fundamental group]]s of schemes and more generally the main structures of a categorical [[Galois theory]]. As a framework for his [[coherent duality]] theory he also introduced [[derived category|derived categories]], which were further developed by Verdier.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Notes on derived categories and Grothendieck duality |author=Joseph Lipman |title=Foundations of Grothendieck Duality for Diagrams of Schemes |series=Lecture Notes in Math., no. 1960 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |date=2009 |url=http://www.math.purdue.edu/~lipman/Duality.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe results of work on these and other topics were published in the ''EGA'' and in less polished form in the notes of the ''[[S\u00e9minaire de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique]]'' (''SGA'') that he directed at the IH\u00c9S.<ref name=\"jackson1\"/>\n\n===Political activism===\nGrothendieck's political views were [[Political radicalism|radical]] and [[pacifist]], and he strongly opposed both United States [[Vietnam War|intervention in Vietnam]] and [[Soviet Empire|Soviet military expansionism]]. He gave lectures on [[category theory]] in the forests surrounding [[Hanoi]] while the city was being bombed, to protest against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>''The Life and Work of Alexander Grothendieck'', ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', vol. 113, no. 9, footnote 6.</ref> He retired from scientific life around 1970, having found out that IH\u00c9S was partly funded by the military.<ref>SGA1, Springer Lecture Notes 224, {{pp.|xii, xiii}}</ref> He returned to academia a few years later as a professor at the [[University of Montpellier]].\n\nWhile the issue of military funding was perhaps the most obvious explanation for Grothendieck's departure from the IH\u00c9S, those who knew him say that the causes of the rupture ran deeper. [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]], a ''visiteur de longue dur\u00e9e'' (\"long-term guest\") at the IH\u00c9S, wrote a piece about Grothendieck for a special volume published on the occasion of the [http://www.ams.org/notices/199903/ihes-changes.pdf IH\u00c9S's fortieth anniversary]. The ''Grothendieck Festschrift'', published in 1990, was a three-volume collection of research papers to mark his sixtieth birthday in 1988.<ref>The editors were [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]], [[Luc Illusie]], [[Nick Katz]], [[G\u00e9rard Laumon]], [[Yuri Manin]], and [[Ken Ribet]]. A second edition has been printed (2007) by Birkhauser.</ref>\n\nIn it, Cartier notes that as the son of an antimilitary anarchist and one who grew up among the disenfranchised, Grothendieck always had a deep compassion for the poor and the downtrodden. As Cartier puts it, Grothendieck came to find [[Bures-sur-Yvette]] \"''une cage dor\u00e9e''\" (\"a gilded cage\"). While Grothendieck was at the IH\u00c9S, opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] was heating up, and Cartier suggests that this also reinforced Grothendieck's distaste at having become a mandarin of the scientific world.{{sfn|Cartier|2004}} In addition, after several years at the IH\u00c9S, Grothendieck seemed to cast about for new intellectual interests. By the late 1960s, he had started to become interested in scientific areas outside mathematics. [[David Ruelle]], a physicist who joined the IH\u00c9S faculty in 1964, said that Grothendieck came to talk to him a few times about [[physics]].<ref group=\"n\">Ruelle<!--not Lorenz?--> invented the concept of a [[strange attractor]] in a [[dynamical system]] and, with the Dutch mathematician [[Floris Takens]], produced a new model for [[turbulence]] during the 1970s.</ref> [[Biology]] interested Grothendieck much more than physics, and he organized some seminars on biological topics.<ref>Allyn Jackson, [http://www.ams.org/notices/199903/ihes-changes.pdf The IH\u00c9S at Forty], Notices of the AMS, March 1999, pp.&nbsp;329\u2013337.</ref>\n\nIn 1970, Grothendieck, with two other mathematicians, [[Claude Chevalley]] and [[Pierre Samuel]], created a political group called ''Survivre''\u2014the name later changed to ''Survivre et vivre''. The group published a bulletin and was dedicated to antimilitary and ecological issues, and also developed strong criticism of the indiscriminate use of science and technology.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} Grothendieck devoted the next three years to this group and served as the main editor of its bulletin.{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}}\n\nAfter leaving the IH\u00c9S, Grothendieck became a [[temporary professor]] at [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]] for two years.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} He then became a professor at the University of Montpellier, where he became increasingly estranged from the mathematical community. His mathematical career, for the most part, ended when he left the IH\u00c9S.<ref name=\"nytob\"/> He formally retired in 1988, a few years after having accepted a research position at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|CNRS]].{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}}\n\n===Manuscripts written in the 1980s===\nWhile not publishing mathematical research in conventional ways during the 1980s, he produced several influential manuscripts with limited distribution, with both mathematical and biographical content.\n\nProduced during 1980 and 1981, ''La Longue Marche \u00e0 travers la th\u00e9orie de Galois'' (''[[The Long March Through Galois Theory]]'') is a 1600-page handwritten manuscript containing many of the ideas that led to the ''[[Esquisse d'un programme]]''.<ref name=\"esquissefr\">Alexandre Grothendieck, [http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/esquissefr.pdf Esquisse d'un Programme], [http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/esquisseeng.pdf English translation]</ref> It also includes a study of [[Teichm\u00fcller space|Teichm\u00fcller theory]].\n\nIn 1983, stimulated by correspondence with [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronald Brown]] and Tim Porter at  [[Bangor University]], Grothendieck wrote a 600-page manuscript titled ''[[Pursuing Stacks]]'', starting with a letter addressed to [[Daniel Quillen]]. This letter and successive parts were distributed from Bangor (see [[#External links|External links]] below). Within these, in an informal, diary-like manner, Grothendieck explained and developed his ideas on the relationship between [[algebraic homotopy theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]] and prospects for a noncommutative theory of [[Stack (mathematics)|stack]]s. The manuscript, which is being edited for publication by G. Maltsiniotis, later led to another of his monumental works, ''Les D\u00e9rivateurs''. Written in 1991, this latter opus of about 2000 pages further developed the homotopical ideas begun in ''Pursuing Stacks''.<ref name=\"jackson2\"/> Much of this work anticipated the subsequent development of the motivic homotopy theory of [[Fabien Morel]] and [[V. Voevodsky]] in the mid-1990s.\n\nIn 1984, Grothendieck wrote the proposal ''[[Esquisse d'un Programme]]''<ref name=\"esquissefr\"/> (\"Sketch of a Programme\") for a position at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS). It describes new ideas for studying the [[moduli space]] of complex curves. Although Grothendieck himself never published his work in this area, the proposal inspired other mathematicians' work by becoming the source of [[dessin d'enfant]] theory and [[Anabelian geometry]].

In 1938, aged ten, he moved to France as a refugee. Records of his nationality were destroyed in the fall of Germany in 1945 and he did not apply for French citizenship after the war. He thus became a stateless person for at least the majority of his working life, traveling on a [[Nansen passport]].{{sfn|Cartier|2004|loc=p. 10, footnote 12}}{{sfn|Kleinert|2007}}{{sfn|Douroux|2012}}<!--Note: Douroux 2012's 1971 date is incorrect; given Cartier's other statements, 1981 (i.e. during the 1980s) is more credible (see Cartier 2001, p.&nbsp;393: \"...an absurd trial in 1977 due to a 1945 regulation that made it a misdemeanor to meet with a foreigner,\" indicating that Grothendieck did not have French nationality in 1977.--> Part of this reluctance to hold French nationality is attributed to not wishing to serve in the French military, particularly due to the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u201362).{{sfn|Cartier|2001}}{{sfn|Cartier|2004}}{{sfn|Kleinert|2007}} He eventually applied for French citizenship in the early 1980s, well past the age that exempted him from military service.{{sfn|Cartier|2004}}\n\n===Family===\nGrothendieck was very close to his mother to whom he dedicated his dissertation. She died in 1957 from the [[tuberculosis]] that she contracted in camps for displaced persons.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} He had five children: a son with his landlady during his time in Nancy,{{sfn|Cartier|2004}} three children, Johanna (1959), Alexander (1961) and Mathieu (1965) with his wife Mireille Dufour,<ref>Hersh, John-Steiner, p.113.</ref>{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}} and one child with Justine Skalba, with whom he lived in a commune in the early 1970s.{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}}\n\n== Mathematical work ==\n\nGrothendieck's early mathematical work was in [[functional analysis]]. Between 1949 and 1953 he worked on his doctoral thesis in this subject at [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], supervised by [[Jean Dieudonn\u00e9]] and [[Laurent Schwartz]]. His key contributions include [[topological tensor product]]s of [[topological vector space]]s, the theory of [[nuclear space]]s as foundational for [[Schwartz distribution]]s, and the application of [[Lp space|L<sup>p</sup> spaces]] in studying linear maps between topological vector spaces. In a few years, he had turned himself into a leading authority on this area of functional analysis\u2014to the extent that Dieudonn\u00e9 compares his impact in this field to that of [[Stefan Banach|Banach]].<ref>{{harv|Dieudonn\u00e9|1990}}</ref>\n\nIt is, however, in [[algebraic geometry]] and related fields where Grothendieck did his most important and influential work. From about 1955 he started to work on [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory and [[homological algebra]], producing the influential \"[[T\u00f4hoku paper]]\" (''Sur quelques points d'alg\u00e8bre homologique'', published in the [[Tohoku Mathematical Journal]] in 1957) where he introduced [[Abelian category|abelian categories]] and applied their theory to show that [[sheaf cohomology]] can be defined as certain [[derived functor]]s in this context.<ref name=\"jackson1\"/>\n\nHomological methods and sheaf theory had already been introduced in algebraic geometry by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and others, after sheaves had been defined by [[Jean Leray]]. Grothendieck took them to a higher level of abstraction and turned them into a key organising principle of his theory. He shifted attention from the study of individual varieties to the ''[[Grothendieck's relative point of view|relative point of view]]'' (pairs of varieties related by a [[morphism]]), allowing a broad generalization of many classical theorems.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} The first major application was the relative version of Serre's theorem showing that the cohomology of a [[coherent sheaf]] on a complete variety is finite-dimensional; Grothendieck's theorem shows that the [[higher direct image]]s of coherent sheaves under a proper map are coherent; this reduces to Serre's theorem over a one-point space.\n\nIn 1956, he applied the same thinking to the [[Riemann\u2013Roch theorem]], which had already recently been generalized to any dimension by [[Friedrich Hirzebruch|Hirzebruch]]. The [[Grothendieck\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch theorem]] was announced by Grothendieck at the initial [[Mathematische Arbeitstagung]] in [[Bonn]], in 1957.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} It appeared in print in a paper written by [[Armand Borel]] with Serre. This result was his first work in algebraic geometry. He went on to plan and execute a programme for rebuilding the foundations of algebraic geometry, which were then in a state of flux and under discussion in [[Claude Chevalley]]'s seminar; he outlined his programme in his talk at the 1958 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]].\n\nHis foundational work on algebraic geometry is at a higher level of abstraction than all prior versions. He adapted the use of non-closed [[generic point]]s, which led to the theory of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]. He also pioneered the systematic use of [[nilpotent]]s. As 'functions' these can take only the value 0, but they carry [[infinitesimal]] information, in purely algebraic settings. His ''theory of schemes'' has become established as the best universal foundation for this field, because of its expressiveness as well as technical depth. In that setting one can use [[birational geometry]], techniques from [[number theory]], [[Galois theory]] and [[commutative algebra]], and close analogues of the methods of [[algebraic topology]], all in an integrated way.<ref name=\"jackson1\"/><ref>See, for example, {{harv|Deligne|1998}}.</ref><ref name=\"Mclarty\">{{cite web |last=Mclarty |first=Colin |title=The Rising Sea: Grothendieck on simplicity and generality I |url=http://people.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/mclarty1.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=13 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nHe is also noted for his mastery of abstract approaches to mathematics and his perfectionism in matters of formulation and presentation.<ref name=\"artist\"/> Relatively little of his work after 1960 was published by the conventional route of the [[learned journal]], circulating initially in duplicated volumes of seminar notes; his influence was to a considerable extent personal.

Weil realized that to prove such a connection one needed a new cohomology theory, but neither he nor any other expert saw how to do this until such a theory was found by Grothendieck.\n\nThis program culminated in the proofs of the [[Weil conjectures]], the last of which was settled by Grothendieck's student [[Pierre Deligne]] in the early 1970s after Grothendieck had largely withdrawn from mathematics.<ref name=\"jackson1\"/>\n\n===Major mathematical contributions===\nIn Grothendieck's retrospective ''R\u00e9coltes et Semailles'', he identified twelve of his contributions which he believed qualified as \"great ideas\".{{sfn|Grothendieck|1986|p=21}}  In chronological order, they are:\n# [[Topological tensor product]]s and [[nuclear space]]s.\n# \"Continuous\" and \"discrete\" [[Duality (mathematics)|duality]] ([[derived category|derived categories]], \"[[six operations (mathematics)|six operations]]\").\n# Yoga of the [[Grothendieck\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch theorem]] ([[K-theory]], relation with [[intersection theory]]).\n# [[Scheme (mathematics)|Scheme]]s.\n# [[Topos|Topoi]].\n# [[\u00c9tale cohomology]] and [[l-adic cohomology]].\n# [[Motive (mathematics)|Motive]]s and the [[motivic Galois group]] (Grothendieck \u2297-categories).\n# Crystals and [[crystalline cohomology]], yoga of \"de Rham coefficients\", \"Hodge coefficients\", ...\n# \"Topological algebra\": \u221e-stacks, [[derivator]]s; cohomological formalism of topoi as inspiration for a new [[homotopical algebra]].\n# [[Tame topology]].\n# Yoga of [[anabelian geometry|anabelian algebraic geometry]], [[Galois\u2013Teichm\u00fcller theory]].\n# \"Schematic\" or \"arithmetic\" point of view for [[regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]] and regular configurations of all kinds.\n\nHere the term ''yoga'' denotes a kind of \"meta-theory\" that can be used heuristically; [[Michel Raynaud]] writes the other terms \"Ariadne's thread\" and \"philosophy\" as effective equivalents.<ref>[http://www.ams.org/notices/200309/rev-raynaud.pdf, at p.&nbsp;2.]</ref>\n\nGrothendieck wrote that, of these themes, the largest in scope was topoi, as they synthesized algebraic geometry, topology, and arithmetic.  The theme that had been most extensively developed was schemes, which were the framework \"''par excellence''\" for eight of the other themes (all but 1, 5, and 12).  Grothendieck wrote that the first and last themes, topological tensor products and regular configurations, were of more modest size than the others.  Topological tensor products had played the role of a tool rather than a source of inspiration for further developments; but he expected that regular configurations could not be exhausted within the lifetime of a mathematician who devoted himself to it.  He believed that the deepest themes were motives, anabelian geometry, and Galois\u2013Teichm\u00fcller theory.{{sfn|Grothendieck|1986|p=22}}\n\n== Influence ==\nGrothendieck is considered by many to be the greatest mathematician of the 20th century.<ref name=obit/>  In an obituary [[David Mumford]] and [[John Tate]] wrote:\n<blockquote>Although mathematics became more and more abstract and general throughout the 20th century, it was Alexander Grothendieck who was the greatest master of this trend.

Algebraic geometry has traditionally meant the understanding of geometric objects, such as [[algebraic curve]]s and surfaces, through the study of the algebraic equations for those objects. Properties of algebraic equations are in turn studied using the techniques of [[ring theory]]. In this approach, the properties of a geometric object are related to the properties of an associated ring. The space (e.g., real, complex, or projective) in which the object is defined is extrinsic to the object, while the ring is intrinsic.\n\nGrothendieck laid a new foundation for algebraic geometry by making intrinsic spaces (\"spectra\") and associated rings the primary objects of study. To that end he developed the theory of [[Scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], which can be informally thought of as [[topological space]]s on which a [[commutative ring]] is associated to every open subset of the space. Schemes have become the basic objects of study for practitioners of modern algebraic geometry. Their use as a foundation allowed geometry to absorb technical advances from other fields.<ref>{{cite book|author=Miles Reid|title=Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KvKdSkPwwmMC&pg=PA115|date=15 December 1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-35662-6|page=115}}</ref>\n\nHis [[Grothendieck\u2013Hirzebruch\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch theorem|generalization]] of the classical [[Riemann-Roch theorem]] related topological properties of complex [[algebraic curve]]s to their algebraic structure.

Grothendieck's discovery of the [[\u00e9tale cohomology|\u2113-adic \u00e9tale cohomology]], the first example of a [[Weil cohomology]] theory, opened the way for a proof of the Weil conjectures, ultimately completed in the 1970s by his student [[Pierre Deligne]].<ref name=\"Hartshorne AG\"/> Grothendieck's large-scale approach has been called a \"visionary program.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=M.

Within days, Wilson admitted himself to the [[Charles B. Towns|Charles B. Towns Hospital]] after drinking four beers on the way\u2014the last alcohol he ever drank. Under the care of [[William Duncan Silkworth|William Duncan Silkworth]] (an early benefactor of AA), Wilson's detox included the [[deliriant]] [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]].<ref>Pittman, Bill \"AA the Way it Began\"  1988, Glenn Abbey Books</ref>  At the hospital a despairing Wilson experienced a bright flash of light, which he felt to be God revealing himself.{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=19\u201320}} Following his hospital discharge Wilson joined the Oxford Group and recruited other alcoholics to the Group.  Wilson's early efforts to help others become sober were ineffective, prompting Silkworth to suggest that Wilson place less stress on religion and more on \"the science\" of treating alcoholism. Wilson's first success came during a business trip to Akron, Ohio, where he was introduced to Robert Smith, a surgeon and Oxford Group member who was unable to stay sober. After thirty days of working with Wilson, Smith drank his last drink on 10 June 1935, the date marked by AA for its anniversaries.{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=33}}\n\nWhile Wilson and Smith credited their sobriety to working with alcoholics under the auspices of the Oxford Group, a Group associate [[pastor]] sermonized against Wilson and his alcoholic Groupers for forming a \"secret, ashamed sub-group\" engaged in \"divergent works\".{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=45}} By 1937, Wilson separated from the Oxford Group. AA Historian Ernest Kurtz described the split:{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=45}}\n<blockquote>...more and more, Bill discovered that new adherents could get sober by believing in each other and in the strength of this group.  Men [no women were members yet] who had proven over and over again, by extremely painful experience, that they could not get sober on their own had somehow become more powerful when two or three of them worked on their common problem. This, then\u2014whatever it was that occurred among them\u2014was what they could accept as a power greater than themselves. They did not need the Oxford Group.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1955, Wilson acknowledged AA's debt, saying \"The Oxford Groupers had clearly shown us what to do. And just as importantly, we learned from them ''what not to do.''\"  Among the Oxford Group practices that AA retained were informal gatherings, a \"changed-life\" developed through \"stages\", and working with others for no material gain, AA's analogs for these are meetings, \"the steps\", and sponsorship. AA's tradition of anonymity was a reaction to the publicity-seeking practices of the Oxford Group, as well as AA's wish to not promote, Wilson said, \"erratic public characters who through broken anonymity might get drunk and destroy confidence in us.\"{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=46-47}}\n\n==The Big Book, the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions==\nTo share their method, Wilson and other members wrote the initially-titled book, ''Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism'',<ref>[http://gsowatch.aamo.info/1939/uslaw.htm GSOwatch.aamo.info]</ref> from which AA drew its name.

Rudy and Arthur L. Greil found that for an AA member to remain sober a high level of commitment is necessary. This commitment is facilitated by a change in the member's [[world view|worldview]]. To help members stay sober AA must, they argue, provide an all-encompassing worldview while creating and sustaining an atmosphere of [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] in the organization. To be all-encompassing AA's ideology places an emphasis on tolerance rather than on a narrow religious worldview that could make the organization unpalatable to potential members and thereby limit its effectiveness. AA's emphasis on the spiritual nature of its program, however, is necessary to institutionalize a feeling of transcendence. A tension results from the risk that the necessity of transcendence, if taken too literally, would compromise AA's efforts to maintain a broad appeal. As this tension is an integral part of AA, Rudy and Greil argue that AA is best described as a ''quasi-religious organization''.<ref name=\"RUDY1989\">{{cite journal |last1=Rudy |first1=David R. |last2=Greil |first2=Arthur L. |title=Is Alcoholics Anonymous a Religious Organization?: Meditations on Marginality |volume=50 |issue=1 |year=1989 |pages=41\u201351 |doi=10.2307/3710917 |jstor=3710917 |journal=Sociological Analysis}}</ref>\n\n===Meetings===\nAA meetings are \"quasi-ritualized therapeutic sessions run by and for, alcoholics\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Dimensions of Alcoholics Anonymous: 1935\u20131965|journal=Substance Use & Misuse |volume=4 |issue=4 |page=509 |year=1969 |doi=10.3109/10826086909062033 |last1=Leach |first1=Barry |last2=Norris |first2=John L. |last3=Dancey |first3=Travis |last4=Bissell |first4=Leclair}}</ref> They are usually informal and often feature discussions.

It is often useful to render image elements in separate passes, and then combine the resulting multiple [[2D computer graphics|2D]] images into a single, final image called the [[compositing|composite]]. For example, compositing is used extensively when combining computer-rendered image elements with live footage.\n\nIn order to combine these image elements correctly, it is necessary to keep an associated ''[[matte (filmmaking)|matte]]'' for each element. This matte contains the coverage information\u2014the shape of the geometry being drawn\u2014making it possible to distinguish between parts of the image where the geometry was actually drawn and other parts of the image that are empty.\n\n==Description==\nTo store matte information, the concept of an alpha channel was introduced by [[Alvy Ray Smith]] in the late 1970s, and fully developed in a 1984 paper by [[Thomas Porter (Pixar)|Thomas Porter]] and [[Tom Duff]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Porter|first=Thomas|author2=Tom Duff|authorlink=Thomas Porter (Pixar)|authorlink2=Tom Duff|year=1984|title=Compositing Digital Images|journal=Computer Graphics|volume=18|issue=3|pages=253\u2013259|doi=10.1145/800031.808606|isbn=0-89791-138-5}}<br>(Available at [http://graphics.pixar.com/library/Compositing/ pixar.com.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415005102/http://graphics.pixar.com/library/Compositing/ |date=2011-04-15 }})</ref> In a 2D image element, which stores a color for each pixel, additional data is stored in the alpha channel with a value between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means that the pixel does not have any coverage information and is transparent; i.e. there was no color contribution from any geometry because the geometry did not overlap this pixel. A value of 1 means that the pixel is opaque because the geometry completely overlapped the pixel.\n\nIf an alpha channel is used in an image, there are two common representations that are available: straight (unassociated) alpha, and premultiplied (associated) alpha.\n\nWith straight alpha, the RGB components represent the color of the object or pixel, disregarding its opacity.\n\nWith premultiplied alpha, the RGB components represent the color of the object or pixel, adjusted for its opacity by multiplication. A more obvious advantage of this is that, in certain situations, it can save a subsequent multiplication (e.g. if the image is used many times during later compositing). However, the most significant advantages of using premultiplied alpha are for correctness and simplicity rather than performance: premultiplied alpha allows correct filtering and blending. In addition, premultiplied alpha allows regions of regular alpha blending and regions with [[Blend_modes#Addition|additive blending mode]] to be encoded within the same image.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tomforsyth1000.github.io/blog.wiki.html#%5B%5BPremultiplied+alpha%5D%5D|title=TomF's Tech Blog - It's only pretending to be a wiki.|author=|date=|website=tomforsyth1000.github.io|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212111056/http://tomforsyth1000.github.io/blog.wiki.html#%5B%5BPremultiplied+alpha%5D%5D|archivedate=12 December 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\nAssuming that the pixel color is expressed using ''straight'' (non-premultiplied) RGBA [[tuple]]s, a pixel value of (0, 0.7, 0, 0.5) implies a pixel that has 70% of the maximum green intensity and 50% opacity. If the color were fully green, its RGBA would be (0, 1, 0, 0.5).\n\nHowever, if this pixel uses premultiplied alpha, all of the RGB values (0, 0.7, 0) are multiplied by 0.5 and then the alpha is appended to the end to yield (0, 0.35, 0, 0.5). In this case, the 0.35 value for the G channel actually indicates 70% green intensity (with 50% opacity). Fully green would be encoded as (0, 0.5, 0, 0.5). For this reason, knowing whether a file uses straight or premultiplied alpha is essential to correctly process or composite it.\n\nIt is often said that [[associativity]] is an advantage of premultiplied alpha blending over straight alpha blending, but both are associative. The only important difference is in the dynamic range of the colour representation in finite precision numerical calculations (which is in all applications): premultiplied alpha has a unique representation for transparent pixels, avoiding the need to choose a \"clear color\" or resultant artefacts such as edge fringes (see the next paragraphs). In other words, color information of transparent pixels is lost in premultiplied alpha, as the conversion from premultiplied alpha to straight alpha is undefined for alpha equal to zero.\nPremultiplied alpha has some practical advantages over normal alpha blending because [[interpolation]] and [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]] give correct results{{Citation needed|reason=difference can only be numerical: please show examples|date=July 2017}}.\n\nOrdinary interpolation without premultiplied alpha leads to RGB information leaking out of fully transparent (A=0) regions, even though this RGB information is ideally invisible. When interpolating or filtering images with abrupt borders between transparent and opaque regions, this can result in borders of colors that were not visible in the original image. Errors also occur in areas of semitransparancy\nbecause the RGB components are not correctly weighted, giving incorrectly high weighting to the color of the more transparent (lower alpha) pixels.\n\nPremultiplication can reduce the available relative precision in the RGB values when using integer or fixed-point representation for the color components, which may cause a noticeable loss of quality if the color information is later brightened or if the alpha channel is removed. In practice, this is not usually noticeable because during typical composition operations, such as OVER, the influence of the low-precision colour information in low-alpha areas on the final output image (after composition) is correspondingly reduced. This loss of precision also makes premultiplied images easier to [[Data compression|compress]] using certain compression schemes, as they do not record the color variations hidden inside transparent regions, and can allocate fewer bits to encode low-alpha areas.\n\nWith the existence of an alpha channel, it is possible to express compositing image operations using a ''compositing algebra''. For example, given two image elements A and B, the most common compositing operation is to combine the images such that A appears in the foreground and B appears in the background. This can be expressed as A '''over''' B. In addition to '''over''', Porter and Duff defined the compositing operators '''in''', '''held out by''' (usually abbreviated '''out'''), '''atop''', and '''xor''' (and the reverse operators '''rover''', '''rin''', '''rout''', and '''ratop''') from a consideration of choices in blending the colors of two pixels when their coverage is, conceptually, overlaid orthogonally:\n\n[[Image:Alpha compositing.svg]]\n\nThe '''over''' operator is, in effect, the normal painting operation (see [[Painter's algorithm]]). The '''in''' operator is the alpha compositing equivalent of [[Clipping (computer graphics)|clipping]].\n\nAs an example, the '''over''' operator can be accomplished by applying the following formula to each pixel value:\n\n:<math>C_o = \\frac{C_a \\alpha_a + C_b \\alpha_b \\left(1 - \\alpha_a\\right)}{\\alpha_a + \\alpha_b \\left(1 - \\alpha_a\\right)}</math>\n\nwhere <math>C_o</math> is the result of the operation, <math>C_a</math> is the color of the pixel in element A, <math>C_b</math> is the color of the pixel in element B, and <math>\\alpha_a</math> and <math>\\alpha_b</math> are the alpha of the pixels in elements A and B respectively.  If it is assumed that all color values are premultiplied by their alpha values (<math>c_i = \\alpha_i C_i</math>), we can rewrite the equation for output color as:\n\n:<math>c_o = c_a + c_b \\left(1 - \\alpha_a\\right)</math>\nand resulting alpha channel value is\n:<math>\\alpha_o = \\frac{c_o}{C_o} = \\alpha_a + \\alpha_b \\left(1 - \\alpha_a\\right)</math>\n:\n\n=== Examples ===\nExamples of red overlaid with green with both colours fully opaque:\n\n<gallery>\nPorterDuffAdd.png|ADD operation\nPorterDuffClear.png|CLEAR operation\nPorterDuffMultiply.png|MULTIPLY operation\nPorterDuffOverlay.png|OVERLAY operation\n</gallery>\n\n==Analytical derivation of the over operator==\n\nPorter and Duff gave a geometric interpretation of the alpha compositing formula by studying orthogonal coverages. Another derivation of the formula, based on a physical [[reflectance]]/[[transmittance]] model, can be found in a 1981 paper by [[Bruce A. Wallace]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Bruce|year=1981|title=Merging and transformation of raster images for cartoon animation|journal=SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics|volume=15|issue=3|pages=253\u2013262|doi=10.1145/800224.806813|isbn=0-89791-045-1|citeseerx=10.1.1.141.7875}}</ref>\n\nA third approach is found by starting out with two very simple assumptions. For simplicity, we shall here use the shorthand notation <math>a \\odot b</math> for representing the '''over''' operator.\n\nThe first assumption is that in the case where the background is opaque (i.e. <math>\\alpha_b = 1</math>), the over operator represents the [[convex combination]] of <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>:\n\n:<math>C_o = \\alpha_a C_a + (1 - \\alpha_a) C_b</math>\n\nThe second assumption is that the operator must respect the associative rule:\n\n:<math>(a \\odot b) \\odot c = a \\odot (b \\odot c)</math>\n\nNow, let us assume that <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> have variable transparencies, whereas <math>c</math> is opaque. We're interested in finding\n\n:<math>o = a \\odot b</math>.\n\nWe know from the associative rule that the following must be true:\n\n:<math>o \\odot c = a \\odot (b \\odot c)</math>\n\nWe know that <math>c</math> is opaque and thus follows that <math>b \\odot c</math> is opaque, so in the above equation, each <math>\\odot</math> operator can be written as a convex combination:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n  \\alpha_o C_o + (1 - \\alpha_o) C_c &= \\alpha_a C_a + (1 - \\alpha_a) (\\alpha_b C_b + (1 - \\alpha_b) C_c) \\\\\n  &= \\alpha_a C_a + (1 - \\alpha_a) \\alpha_b C_b + (1 - \\alpha_a) (1 - \\alpha_b) C_c\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nHence we see that this represents an equation of the form <math>X_0 + Y_0 C_c = X_1 + Y_1 C_c</math>. By setting <math>X_0 = X_1</math> and <math>Y_0 = Y_1</math> we get\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n  \\alpha_o &= 1 - (1 - \\alpha_a) (1 - \\alpha_b),\\\\\n  C_o &= \\frac{\\alpha_a C_a + (1 - \\alpha_a)\\alpha_b C_b}{\\alpha_o},\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhich means that we have analytically derived a formula for the output alpha and the output color of <math>a \\odot b</math>.\n\nAn even more compact representation is given by noticing that <math>(1 - \\alpha_a)\\alpha_b = \\alpha_o - \\alpha_a</math>:\n\n:<math>\n  C_o = \\frac{\\alpha_a}{\\alpha_o} C_a + \\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha_a}{\\alpha_o}\\right) C_b\n</math>\n\nTthe <math>\\odot</math> operator fulfills all the requirements of a [[non-commutative]] [[monoid]], where the [[identity element]] <math>e</math> is chosen such that <math>e \\odot a = a \\odot e = a</math> (i.e. the identity element can be any tuple <math>\\langle C,\\alpha\\rangle</math> with <math>\\alpha = 0</math>.)\n\n==Alpha blending==\n\nAlpha blending is the process of combining a translucent foreground color with a background color, thereby producing a new blended color. The degree of the foreground color's translucency may range from completely transparent to completely opaque. If the foreground color is completely transparent, the blended color will be the background color. Conversely, if it is completely opaque, the blended color will be the foreground color. The translucency can range between these extremes, in which case the blended color is computed as a weighted average of the foreground and background colors.\n\nAlpha blending is a [[convex combination]] of two [[color]]s allowing for [[Transparency (graphic)|transparency]] effects in [[computer graphics]]. The value of <code>alpha</code> in the color code ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 represents a fully transparent color, and 1.0 represents a fully opaque color.

This mode devotes 5 bits for every primary RGB color ([[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#15-bit RGB|15-bit RGB]]) plus a remaining bit as the \"alpha channel\".\n\n==Composing alpha blending with gamma correction==\n\n[[File:Mix lazy.png|thumb|Alpha blending, not taking into account the gamma correction]]\n\n[[File:Mix precise.png|thumb|Alpha blending, taking into account the gamma correction.\n\nA demonstration with python code can be found [https://gist.github.com/pthom/5155d319a7957a38aeb2ac9e54cc0999 here] ]]\n\nThe RGB values stored in computer images are actually not the real light intensities, but they have been transformed by a [[Gamma correction]], in order to optimize the usage of bits when encoding an image.\n\nThe gamma correction can be roughly summarised as below:\n\n* let <math>displayed_{RGB}</math> be the RGB intensity that is displayed on the screen (in normalised intensities, i.e between 0 and 1)\n* let <math>stored_{RGB}</math> be the RGB intensity that is stored as bits in the computer memory (in normalised intensities also)\n* let <math>\\gamma</math> be the \"decoding\" gamma of 2.2  of the <math>stored_{RGB}</math> image (<math>\\gamma</math> has a typical value of 2.2)\nThen we have the following relation:\n\n<math>displayed_{RGB} = {stored_{RGB}} ^ {\\gamma}</math>\n\n\nThus, when dealing with computer stored RGB values, alpha blending will look much better it the gamma correction is unapplied before averaging the images and re-applied afterwards.

In some cases the term \"vector\" is used in computing to refer to an array, although [[tuple]]s rather than [[vector space|vectors]] are the more mathematically correct equivalent. [[table (information)|Table]]s are often implemented in the form of arrays, especially [[lookup table]]s; the word ''table'' is sometimes used as a synonym of ''array''.\n\nArrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures, such as [[list (computing)|list]]s and [[string (computer science)|string]]s. They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many [[external storage]] devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses. [[Central processing unit|Processors]], especially [[vector processor]]s, are often optimized for array operations.\n\nArrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]]. Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative [[statement (programming)|statement]] to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation.

Array types are often implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they may be implemented by [[hash table]]s, [[linked list]]s, [[search tree]]s, or other data structures.\n\nThe term is also used, especially in the description of [[algorithm]]s, to mean [[associative array]] or \"abstract array\", a [[theoretical computer science]] model (an [[abstract data type]] or ADT) intended to capture the essential properties of arrays. Arrays have better cache locality as compared to [[linked list]]s.\n\n==History==\nThe first digital computers used machine-language programming to set up and access array structures for data tables, vector and matrix computations, and for many other purposes. [[John von Neumann]] wrote the first array-sorting program ([[merge sort]]) in 1945, during the building of the [[EDVAC|first stored-program computer]].<ref>Donald Knuth, ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'', vol. 3. Addison-Wesley</ref><sup>p.&nbsp;159</sup>  Array indexing was originally done by [[self-modifying code]], and later using [[index register]]s and [[Addressing mode|indirect addressing]].  Some mainframes designed in the 1960s, such as the [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs B5000]] and its successors, used [[memory segmentation]] to perform index-bounds checking in hardware.<ref>{{citation|title=Capability-based Computer Systems|first=Henry M.|last=Levy|publisher=Digital Press|year=1984|isbn=9780932376220|page=22}}.</ref>\n\nAssembly languages generally have no special support for arrays, other than what the machine itself provides. The earliest high-level programming languages, including [[Fortran|FORTRAN]] (1957), [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] (1958), [[COBOL]] (1960), and [[ALGOL|ALGOL 60]] (1960), had support for multi-dimensional arrays, and so has [[C (programming language)|C]] (1972). In [[C++]] (1983), class templates exist for multi-dimensional arrays whose dimension is fixed at runtime<ref name=\"garcia\" /><ref name=\"veldhuizen\" /> as well as for runtime-flexible arrays.<ref name=\"andres\" />\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}\n\n==Applications==\nArrays are used to implement mathematical [[coordinate vector|vectors]] and [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], as well as other kinds of rectangular tables.  Many [[database]]s, small and large, consist of (or include) one-dimensional arrays whose elements are [[record (computer science)|record]]s.\n\nArrays are used to implement other data structures, such as lists, [[heap (data structure)|heaps]], [[hash table]]s, [[double-ended queue|deque]]s, [[queue (data structure)|queue]]s, [[stack (data structure)|stacks]], [[String (computer science)|strings]], and [[VList]]s. Array-based implementations of other data structures are frequently simple and space-efficient ([[implicit data structure]]s), requiring little space [[Overhead (computing)|overhead]], but may have poor space complexity, particularly when modified, compared to tree-based data structures (compare a [[sorted array]] to a [[search tree]]).\n\nOne or more large arrays are sometimes used to emulate in-program [[dynamic memory allocation]], particularly [[memory pool]] allocation. Historically, this has sometimes been the only way to allocate \"dynamic memory\" portably.\n\nArrays can be used to determine partial or complete [[control flow]] in programs, as a compact alternative to (otherwise repetitive) multiple <code>IF</code> statements. They are known in this context as [[control table]]s and are used in conjunction with a purpose built interpreter whose [[control flow]] is altered according to values contained in the array. The array may contain [[subroutine]] [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointers]] (or relative subroutine numbers that can be acted upon by [[Switch statement|SWITCH]] statements) that direct the path of the execution.\n\n==Element identifier and addressing formulas==\n\nWhen data objects are stored in an array, individual objects are selected by an index that is usually a non-negative [[scalar (computing)|scalar]] [[integer]]. Indexes are also called subscripts.  An index ''maps'' the array value to a stored object.\n\nThere are three ways in which the elements of an array can be indexed:\n\n* '''0''' (''[[Zero-based numbering|zero-based indexing]]''): The first element of the array is indexed by subscript of 0.<ref>{{cite web\n| accessdate = 8 April 2011\n| location = http://www.configure-all.com/\n| publisher = Computer Programming Web programming Tips\n| title = Array Code Examples - PHP Array Functions - PHP code\n| quote = In most computer languages array index (counting) starts from 0, not from 1.

Automobiles[12]. The variable name is \"Automobiles\" and the array subscripts are the numbers 1 through 12. [i.e. in Modula-2, the index starts by one!]\n| url = http://www.modula2.org/tutor/chapter6.php}}</ref>\n* '''n''' (''n-based indexing''): The base index of an array can be freely chosen. Usually programming languages allowing ''n-based indexing'' also allow negative index values and other [[scalar (computing)|scalar]] data types like [[Enumerated type|enumerations]], or [[Character (computing)|characters]] may be used as an array index.\n\nUsing zero based indexing is design choice of many influential programming languages, including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]. This leads to simpler implementation where the subscript refers to an offset from the starting position of an array, so the first element has an offset of zero.\n\nArrays can have multiple dimensions, thus it is not uncommon to access an array using multiple indices. For example, a two-dimensional array  <code>A</code> with three rows and four columns might provide access to the element at the 2nd row and 4th column by the expression <code>A[1][3]</code> in the case of a zero-based indexing system. Thus two indices are used for a two-dimensional array, three for a three-dimensional array, and ''n'' for an ''n''-dimensional array.\n\nThe number of indices needed to specify an element is called the dimension, dimensionality, or [[rank (computer programming)|rank]] of the array.\n\nIn standard arrays, each index is restricted to a certain range of consecutive integers (or consecutive values of some [[enumerated type]]), and the address of an element is computed by a \"linear\" formula on the indices.\n\n===One-dimensional arrays===\nA one-dimensional array (or single dimension array) is a type of linear array. Accessing its elements involves a single subscript which can either represent a row or column index.\n\nAs an example consider the C declaration <code>int anArrayName[10];</code>\n\nSyntax : datatype anArrayname[sizeofArray];\n\nIn the given example the array can contain 10 elements of any value available to the <code>int</code> type.  In C, the array element indices are 0-9 inclusive in this case.  For example, the expressions <code>anArrayName[0]</code> and <code>anArrayName[9]</code> are the first and last elements respectively.\n\nFor a vector with linear addressing, the element with index ''i'' is located at the address ''B'' + ''c'' \u00d7 ''i'', where ''B'' is a fixed ''base address'' and ''c'' a fixed constant, sometimes called the  ''address increment'' or ''stride''.\n\nIf the valid element indices begin at 0, the constant ''B'' is simply the address of the first element of the array. For this reason, the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] specifies that array indices always begin at 0; and many programmers will call that element \"[[Zero-based numbering|zeroth]]\" rather than \"first\".\n\nHowever, one can choose the index of the first element by an appropriate choice of the base address ''B''.  For example, if the array has five elements, indexed 1 through 5, and the base address ''B'' is replaced by ''B'' + 30''c'', then the indices of those same elements will be 31 to 35.  If the numbering does not start at 0, the constant ''B'' may not be the address of any element.\n\n===Multidimensional arrays===\nFor a multidimensional array, the element with indices ''i'',''j'' would have address ''B'' + ''c'' \u00b7 ''i'' + ''d'' \u00b7 ''j'', where the coefficients ''c'' and ''d'' are the ''row'' and ''column address increments'', respectively.\n\nMore generally, in a ''k''-dimensional array, the address of an element with indices ''i''<sub>1</sub>, ''i''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''i''<sub>''k''</sub> is\n:''B'' + ''c''<sub>1</sub> \u00b7 ''i''<sub>1</sub> + ''c''<sub>2</sub> \u00b7 ''i''<sub>2</sub> + ... + ''c''<sub>''k''</sub> \u00b7 ''i''<sub>''k''</sub>.\n\nFor example: int a[2][3];\n\nThis means that array a has 2 rows and 3 columns, and the array is of integer type. Here we can store 6 elements they will be \nstored linearly but starting from first row linear then continuing with second row. The above array will be stored as a<sub>11</sub>, a<sub>12</sub>, a<sub>13</sub>, a<sub>21</sub>, a<sub>22</sub>, a<sub>23</sub>.\n\nThis formula requires only ''k'' multiplications and ''k'' additions, for any array that can fit in memory. Moreover, if any coefficient is a fixed power of 2, the multiplication can be replaced by [[bitwise operation|bit shifting]].\n\nThe coefficients ''c''<sub>''k''</sub> must be chosen so that every valid index tuple maps to the address of a distinct element.\n\nIf the minimum legal value for every index is 0, then ''B'' is the address of the element whose indices are all zero.  As in the one-dimensional case, the element indices may be changed by changing the base address ''B''.  Thus, if a two-dimensional array has rows and columns indexed from 1 to 10 and 1 to 20, respectively, then replacing  ''B'' by ''B'' + ''c''<sub>1</sub> - \u2212 3 ''c''<sub>1</sub> will cause them to be renumbered from 0 through 9 and 4 through 23, respectively.  Taking advantage of this feature, some languages (like FORTRAN 77) specify that array indices begin at 1, as in mathematical tradition while other languages (like Fortran 90, Pascal and Algol) let the user choose the minimum value for each index.\n\n===Dope vectors===\nThe addressing formula is completely defined by the dimension ''d'', the base address ''B'', and the increments ''c''<sub>1</sub>, ''c''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''c''<sub>''k''</sub>.  It is often  useful to pack these parameters into a record called the array's ''descriptor'' or ''stride vector'' or ''[[dope vector]]''.<ref name=\"andres\" /><ref name=\"garcia\" />  The size of each element, and the minimum and maximum values allowed for each index may also be included in the dope vector.  The dope vector is a complete [[handle (computing)|handle]] for the array, and is a convenient way to pass arrays as arguments to [[subroutine|procedures]].  Many useful [[array slicing]] operations (such as selecting a sub-array, swapping indices, or reversing the direction of the indices) can be performed very efficiently by manipulating the dope vector.<ref name=\"andres\" />\n\n===Compact layouts===\n{{Main|Row- and column-major order}}\nOften the coefficients are chosen so that the elements occupy a contiguous area of memory.  However, that is not necessary.  Even if arrays are always created with contiguous elements, some array slicing operations may create non-contiguous sub-arrays from them.\n\n[[File:Row_and_column_major_order.svg|thumb|upright|Illustration of row- and column-major order]]\nThere are two systematic compact layouts for a two-dimensional array.  For example, consider the matrix\n:<math>\\mathbf{A} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n7 & 8 & 9\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\nIn the row-major order layout (adopted by C for statically declared arrays), the elements in each row are stored in consecutive positions and all of the elements of a row have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive row:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9\n|}\nIn column-major order (traditionally used by Fortran), the elements in each column are consecutive in memory and all of the elements of a column have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive column:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| 1 || 4 || 7 || 2 || 5 || 8 || 3 || 6 || 9\n|}\nFor arrays with three or more indices, \"row major order\" puts in consecutive positions any two elements whose index tuples differ only by one in the ''last'' index.  \"Column major order\" is analogous with respect to the ''first'' index.\n\nIn systems which use [[processor cache]] or [[virtual memory]], scanning an array is much faster if successive elements are stored in consecutive positions in memory, rather than sparsely scattered.  Many algorithms that use multidimensional arrays will scan them in a predictable order. A programmer (or a sophisticated compiler) may use this information to choose between row- or column-major layout for each array.  For example,  when computing the product ''A''\u00b7''B'' of two matrices, it would be best to have ''A'' stored in row-major order, and  ''B'' in column-major order.\n\n===Resizing===\n{{Main|Dynamic array}}\n\nStatic arrays have a size that is fixed when they are created and consequently do not allow elements to be inserted or removed. However, by allocating a new array and copying the contents of the old array to it, it is possible to effectively implement a ''dynamic'' version of an array; see [[dynamic array]]. If this operation is done infrequently, insertions at the end of the array require only amortized constant time.\n\nSome array data structures do not reallocate storage, but do store a count of the number of elements of the array in use, called the count or size. This effectively makes the array a [[dynamic array]] with a fixed maximum size or capacity; [[Pascal string]]s are examples of this.\n\n===Non-linear formulas===\nMore complicated (non-linear) formulas are occasionally used. For a compact two-dimensional [[triangular array]], for instance, the addressing formula is a polynomial of degree 2.\n\n==Efficiency==\nBoth ''store'' and ''select'' take (deterministic worst case) [[constant time]]. Arrays take linear ([[Big-O notation|O]](''n'')) space in the number of elements ''n'' that they hold.\n\nIn an array with element size ''k'' and on a machine with a cache line size of B bytes, iterating through an array of ''n'' elements requires the minimum of ceiling(''nk''/B) cache misses, because its elements occupy contiguous memory locations. This is roughly a factor of B/''k'' better than the number of cache misses needed to access ''n'' elements at random memory locations. As a consequence, sequential iteration over an array is noticeably faster in practice than iteration over many other data structures, a property called [[locality of reference]] (this does ''not'' mean however, that using a [[Perfect hash function|perfect hash]] or [[hash function#Trivial hash function|trivial hash]] within the same (local) array, will not be even faster - and achievable in [[constant time]]). Libraries provide low-level optimized facilities for copying ranges of memory (such as [[String.h|memcpy]]) which can be used to move [[Contiguous data storage|contiguous]] blocks of array elements significantly faster than can be achieved through individual element access. The speedup of such optimized routines varies by array element size, architecture, and implementation.\n\nMemory-wise, arrays are compact data structures with no per-element [[Computational overhead|overhead]]. There may be a per-array overhead, e.g. to store index bounds, but this is language-dependent. It can also happen that elements stored in an array require ''less'' memory than the same elements stored in individual variables, because several array elements can be stored in a single [[Word (data type)|word]]; such arrays are often called ''packed'' arrays. An extreme (but commonly used) case is the [[bit array]], where every bit represents a single element. A single [[octet (computing)|octet]] can thus hold up to 256 different combinations of up to 8 different conditions, in the most compact form.\n\nArray accesses with statically predictable access patterns are a major source of [[data parallelism]].\n\n===Comparison with other data structures===\n{{List data structure comparison}}\n[[Dynamic array]]s or growable arrays are similar to arrays but add the ability to insert and delete elements; adding and deleting at the end is particularly efficient. However, they reserve linear ([[Big-O notation#Family of Bachmann\u2013Landau notations|\u0398]](''n'')) additional storage, whereas arrays do not reserve additional storage.\n\n[[Associative array]]s provide a mechanism for array-like functionality without huge storage overheads when the index values are sparse. For example, an array that contains values only at indexes 1 and 2 billion may benefit from using such a structure. Specialized associative arrays with integer keys include [[Radix tree|Patricia trie]]s, [[Judy array]]s, and [[van Emde Boas tree]]s.\n\n[[Self-balancing binary search tree|Balanced trees]] require O(log ''n'') time for indexed access, but also permit inserting or deleting elements in O(log ''n'') time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/algorithms/cbtree.html|title=Counted B-Trees|publisher=}}</ref> whereas growable arrays require linear (\u0398(''n'')) time to insert or delete elements at an arbitrary position.\n\n[[Linked list]]s allow constant time removal and insertion in the middle but take linear time for indexed access. Their memory use is typically worse than arrays, but is still linear.\n\n[[Image:Array of array storage.svg|120px|left|A two-dimensional array stored as a one-dimensional array of one-dimensional arrays (rows).]]\nAn [[Iliffe vector]] is an alternative to a multidimensional array structure. It uses a one-dimensional array of [[reference (computer science)|references]] to arrays of one dimension less. For two dimensions, in particular, this alternative structure would be a vector of pointers to vectors, one for each row(pointer on c or c++)\n.  Thus an element in row ''i'' and column ''j'' of an array ''A'' would be accessed by double indexing (''A''[''i''][''j''] in typical notation). This alternative structure allows [[jagged array]]s, where each row may have a different size \u2014 or, in general, where the valid range of each index depends on the values of all preceding indices.  It also saves one multiplication (by the column address increment) replacing it by a bit shift (to index the vector of row pointers) and one extra memory access (fetching the row address), which may be worthwhile in some architectures.\n\n==Dimension==\nThe dimension of an array is the number of indices needed to select an element. Thus, if the array is seen as a function on a set of possible index combinations, it is the dimension of the space of which its domain is a discrete subset. Thus a one-dimensional array is a list of data, a two-dimensional array a rectangle of data, a three-dimensional array a block of data, etc.\n\nThis should not be confused with the dimension of the set of all matrices with a given domain, that is, the number of elements in the array. For example, an array with 5 rows and 4 columns is two-dimensional, but such matrices form a 20-dimensional space. Similarly, a three-dimensional vector can be represented by a one-dimensional array of size three.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Dynamic array]]\n* [[Parallel array]]\n* [[Variable-length array]]\n* [[Bit array]]\n* [[Array slicing]]\n* [[Offset (computer science)]]\n* [[Row- and column-major order]]\n* [[Stride of an array]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Wiktionary|array}}\n{{Wikibooks|Data Structures/Arrays}}\n{{Commons category|Array data structure}}\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}{{Parallel computing}}{{Data structures}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Array Data Structure}}\n[[Category:Arrays|*]]", "sha1": "surs5u6e7fzbkb205s5m97017rx9s20"}}, {"title": "Advance Australia Fair", "ns": "0", "id": "2053", "revision": {"id": "865487937", "parentid": "864556345", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T07:55:59Z", "contributor": {"ip": "121.45.229.88"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=April 2012}}\n{{Infobox anthem\n | title       = Advance Australia Fair\n | image       = Advance Australia Fair.png{{!}}border\n | image_size  =\n | alt         =\n | caption     = \n | prefix      = National\n | country     = [[Australia]]\n | author      = [[Peter Dodds McCormick]]\n | lyrics_date = 1878\n | composer    = Peter Dodds McCormick\n | music_date  = 1878\n | adopted     = 1984\n | until       =\n | sound       = U.S. Navy Band, Advance Australia Fair (instrumental).ogg\n | sound_title = \"Advance Australia Fair\" (instrumental)\n}}\n\"'''Advance Australia Fair'''\" is the [[national anthem]] of [[Australia]]. Created by the Scottish-born composer [[Peter Dodds McCormick]], the song was first performed in 1878 and sung in Australia as a patriotic song. It replaced \"[[God Save the Queen]]\" as the official national anthem in 1984, following a [[Australian plebiscite, 1977 (National Song)|plebiscite to choose the national song in 1977]]. Other songs and marches have been influenced by \"Advance Australia Fair\", such as the Australian [[Honors music|vice-regal salute]].\n\n==History==\n===Origin===\n[[File:Petermccormick.jpg|thumb|Peter Dodds McCormick, the composer of \"Advance Australia Fair\"]]\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Advance Australia Fair (1915).ogg|title=\"Advance Australia Fair\"|description=Performed in 1915}}\n\"Advance Australia Fair\" was composed in the late 19th century by [[Peter Dodds McCormick]] under the pen-name \"Amicus\" (which means \"friend\" in Latin). It was first performed by Andrew Fairfax at a function of the Highland Society of New South Wales in Sydney on 30 November 1878. The song quickly gained popularity and an amended version was sung by a choir of around 10,000 at the inauguration of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] on 1 January 1901. In 1907 the Australian Government awarded McCormick \u00a3100 for his composition.<ref>{{cite AuDB | id2=mccormick-peter-dodds-7323 |title=McCormick, Peter Dodds (1834\u20131916) |first=Jim |last=Fletcher |volume=10 |year=1986 |access-date=17 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn a letter to R.B. Fuller, dated 1 August 1913, McCormick described the circumstances that inspired him to write \"Advance Australia Fair\":\n\n{{quote|One night I attended a great concert in the Exhibition Building, when all the National Anthems of the world were to be sung by a large choir with band accompaniment. This was very nicely done, but I felt very aggravated that there was not one note for Australia. On the way home in a bus, I concocted the first verse of my song & when I got home I set it to music. I first wrote it in the Tonic Sol-fa notation, then transcribed it into the Old Notation, & I tried it over on an instrument next morning, & found it correct. Strange to say there has not been a note of it altered since. Some alteration has been made in the wording, but the sense is the same. It seemed to me to be like an inspiration, & I wrote the words & music with the greatest ease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an000008257145|title=Letters [manuscript]|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=26 October 2008}} Letter to R.B.

In 1973 the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] government decided that the country needed an anthem that could represent Australia with \"distinction\" and started a competition to find one. This decision by Whitlam was driven by the desire to forge a new nationalism separate from Great Britain. In 1973, Gough Whitlam dedicated an entire Australia Day speech to the search for a new anthem saying that it will be a \"symbolic expression of our national pride and dignity\".<ref>Whitlam, G 1973, 'National Anthem', Australia Day Broadcast</ref> The [[Australia Council for the Arts]] organised the contest, which was dubbed the \"Australian National Anthem Quest\". The contest was held in two stages, the first seeking lyrics and the second music, each having an [[Australian dollar|A$]]5,000 prize for the winning entry. On the recommendation of the Council for the Arts, none of the new entries were felt worthy enough, so the contest ended with the suggestions for \"Advance Australia Fair\", \"[[Waltzing Matilda]]\" and \"[[Song of Australia]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/symbols/anthem.cfm#history|title=Australian National Anthem \u2013 History|publisher=Australian Government|date=10 July 2007|accessdate=1 November 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109134834/http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/symbols/anthem.cfm#dvd_cd|archivedate=9 November 2007|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974 the Whitlam government then performed a nationwide opinion survey to determine the song to be sung on occasions of national significance. Conducted through the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], it polled 60,000 people nationally. \"Advance Australia Fair\" was chosen and was enshrined as the national song, to be used on all occasions excepting those of a specifically regal nature. A spokesman for the Prime Minister Gough Whitlam stated that the Government regarded the tune primarily as the national anthem.  During the [[Australian federal election, 1975|1975 election campaign]] following the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|dismissal of Whitlam by Sir John Kerr]], it was proposed by [[David Combe]] that the song be played at the start of the Labor Party's official campaign launch on 24 November 1975 at Festival Hall, Melbourne. Whitlam's speechwriter [[Graham Freudenberg]] rejected this idea, on two grounds, one of which was that the status of the anthem was still tentative.<ref>Graham Freudenberg, \"We've been sacked\", ''The Sunday Age'', 6 November 2005, p. 13</ref>\n\nIn January 1976 the [[Malcolm Fraser|Fraser]] government reinstated \"God Save the Queen\" for royal, vice-regal, defence and [[loyal toast]] occasions as well as making plans to conduct a national poll to find a song for use on ceremonial occasions when it was desired to mark a separate Australian identity. This was conducted as a [[Australian plebiscite, 1977 (National Song)|plebiscite to choose the National Song]], held as an optional additional question in the [[Australian referendum, 1977|1977 referendum]] on various issues. \"Advance Australia Fair\" received 43.29% of the vote, defeating the three alternatives, \"[[Waltzing Matilda]]\" (28.28%), \"[[Song of Australia]]\" (9.65%) and the existing national anthem, \"God Save the Queen\" (18.78%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/elect/referend/pleb.htm |title=Plebiscite results: National Song Poll |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] |date=30 June 2002 |accessdate=13 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205110200/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/elect/referend/pleb.htm |archivedate=5 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n\"Advance Australia Fair\", with modified lyrics from the original (see [[#Development of lyrics|development of lyrics]]), was adopted as the Australian national anthem on 19 April 1984 by a proclamation by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[Ninian Stephen|Sir Ninian Stephen]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/handbook/national_symbols/index.htm |title=Parliamentary Handbook of the Commonwealth of Australia \u2013 National Symbols |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] |date=21 September 2005 |accessdate=1 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830052800/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/handbook/national_symbols/index.htm |archivedate=30 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }} (proclamation by Governor-General dated 19 April 1984)</ref> on a recommendation by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government of [[Bob Hawke]]. \"God Save the Queen\", now known as the [[royal anthem]], continues to be played alongside the Australian national anthem at public engagements in Australia that are attended by [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] or members of the Royal Family.\n\n==Lyrics==\nThe lyrics of \"Advance Australia Fair\" were officially adopted in 1984 as follows:<ref name=anthem>{{cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/nat_anthem.html|title=The Australian National Anthem|publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]|accessdate=1 November 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023080802/http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/nat_anthem.html|archivedate=23 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n<poem style=\"float:left;\">Australians all let us rejoice,\nFor we are young and free;\nWe've golden soil and wealth for toil;\nOur home is girt by sea;\nOur land abounds in nature's gifts\nOf beauty rich and rare;\nIn history's page, let every stage\nAdvance Australia Fair.\nIn joyful strains then let us sing,\nAdvance Australia Fair.</poem>\n<poem style=\"float:left; margin-left:2em;\">Beneath our radiant [[Southern Cross]]\nWe'll toil with hearts and hands;\nTo make this Commonwealth of ours\nRenowned of all the lands;\nFor those who've come across the seas\nWe've boundless plains to share;\nWith courage let us all combine\nTo Advance Australia Fair.\nIn joyful strains then let us sing,\nAdvance Australia Fair.</poem>\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n==Copyright==\nEven though any [[copyright]] of Peter Dodds McCormick's original lyrics has expired, as he died in 1916, the Commonwealth of Australia claims copyright on the official lyrics and particular arrangements of music.

The first verse was kept largely as the 1879 original, except for the change in the first line from \"{{em|Australia's sons}} let us rejoice\" to \"{{em|Australians all}} let us rejoice\".<ref name=anthem/> The second, third and fourth verses of the original were dropped, in favour of a modified version of the new third verse which was sung at [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.mus-an6397822|title=Digital Collections \u2013 Advance Australia Fair (1901\u20131919)|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=3 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe original lyrics published in 1879 were as follows:<ref name=1879orig>{{cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview?pi=nla.mus-an24220024-s1-e|title=Digital Collections \u2013 Advance Australia Fair (1879)|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=1 November 2007}}</ref>\n\n<poem style=\"float:left;\">Australia's sons let us rejoice,\nFor we are young and free;\nWe've golden soil and wealth for toil,\nOur home is girt by sea;\nOur land abounds in Nature's gifts\nOf beauty rich and rare;\nIn hist'ry's page, let ev'ry stage\nAdvance Australia fair.\nIn joyful strains then let us sing,\nAdvance Australia fair.</poem>\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em; float:left;\">When gallant [[James Cook|Cook]] from [[Albion]] sailed,\nTo trace wide oceans o'er,\nTrue British courage bore him on,\nTil he landed on our shore.\nThen here he raised Old England's flag,\nThe standard of the brave;\n\"With all her faults we love her still\"\n\"[[Command of the sea|Britannia rules the wave]].\"\nIn joyful strains then let us sing\nAdvance Australia fair.</poem>\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em; float:left;\">While other nations of the globe\nBehold us from afar,\nWe'll rise to high renown and shine\nLike our glorious southern star;\nFrom England soil and Fatherland,\n[[Scotland|Scotia]] and [[Ireland|Erin]] fair,\nLet all combine with heart and hand\nTo advance Australia fair.\nIn joyful strains then let us sing\nAdvance Australia fair.</poem>\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em; float:left;\">Should foreign foe e'er sight our coast,\nOr dare a foot to land,\nWe'll rouse to arms like sires of yore,\nTo guard our native strand;\nBritannia then shall surely know,\nThough oceans roll between,\nHer sons in fair Australia's land\nStill keep their courage green.\nIn joyful strains then let us sing\nAdvance Australia fair.</poem>\n{{Clear|left}}\nThe 1901 Federation version of the third verse was originally sung as:\n\n<poem>Beneath our radiant Southern Cross,\nWe'll toil with hearts and hands;\nTo make our youthful Commonwealth,\nRenowned of all the lands;\nFor loyal sons beyond the seas\nWe've boundless plains to share;\nWith courage let us all combine\nTo advance Australia fair.\nIn joyful strains then let us sing\nAdvance Australia fair!</poem>\n\n==Criticism==\nBoth the lyrics and melody of the Australian national anthem have been criticised in some quarters as being dull and unendearing to the Australian people.

The facility has a telephone number that may be called to listen to an automatic announcement that includes the caller's telephone number.\n\nThe ANAC number is useful primarily during the installation of landline telephones to quickly identify one of multiple lines.\n\n== Operation ==\nA technician calls the local telephone number of the automatic number announcement service. This call is connected to equipment at a local [[telephone exchange|central office]] that uses a voice synthesizer or digital samples to [[text-to-speech|announce]] the telephone number of the line calling in. The main purpose of this system is to allow telephone company technicians to identify the telephone line they are connected to.\n\nAutomatic number announcement systems are based on [[automatic number identification]], and meant for phone company technicians, the ANAC system works with [[unlisted number]]s, numbers with caller ID blocking, and numbers with no outgoing calls allowed. Installers of multi-line business services where outgoing calls from all lines display the company's main number on call display can use ANAC to identify a specific line in the system, even if CID displays every line as \"line one\".\n\nSome ANACs are very regional or local in scope, while others are state-/province- or [[telephone numbering plan|area-code]]-wide: there appears to be no consistent national system for them. Most are provider-specific. Every telephone company, whether large or small, determines its own ANAC for each individual central office, which tends to perpetuate the current situation of a mess of overlapping and/or spotty areas of coverage.<ref>[http://www.artofhacking.com/tucops/phreak/callerid/live/aoh_anac.htm artofhacking.com List of local ANAC phone numbers] in United States, Canada, Australia and Britain</ref> No official lists of ANAC numbers are published as telephone companies believe overuse of these numbers could make them more likely to be busy when needed by installers.<ref>[http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r25283784-Internet-What-is-the-number-to-dial-to-get-the-phone-line- DSLreports: Identifying the telephone number of an ADSL dry loop (Canada)]</ref>\n\n=== 958 local test exchanges ===\nUnder the [[North American Numbering Plan]], almost all North American area codes reserve telephone numbers beginning with ''958'' and ''959'' for internal local and long distance testing (respectively), sometimes called plant testing. (One exception is [[Area code 204|Winnipeg]], which reserves ''959'' only). Numbers within this block are used for various test utilities such as a [[ringback number]] (to test the ringer when installing [[telephone]] sets), milliwatt tone (a number simply answers with a continuous [[test tone]]) and a [[loop around]] (which connects a call to another inbound call to the same or another test number). ANAC numbers can also appear in the ''958'' range, but there is no requirement that they reside there.\n\nIn some area codes, multiple additional prefixes had been reserved for test purposes, in addition to the standard 958 and 959. Many area codes reserved 999; 320 was also formerly reserved in [[Bell Canada]] territory. As widespread inefficiencies in numbering (such as the assignment of entire blocks of 10000 numbers to every competing carrier in every small village to support local number portability schemes) have created shortages of available numbers, these prefixes are often \"reclaimed\" and issued as standard exchanges, moving the handful of numbers in them to one standard test exchange (usually 958).\n\nSome carriers have been known to disable [[payphone]] calls to 958 or 959 test lines, such as Bell Canada's system-wide ANAC line at '''(area code) 958-2580'''. Conversely, a standard line on which voice service has been unsubscribed (such as an [[ADSL]] [[dry loop]]) may still accept calls to the 958 test exchange but not allow calls to standard numbers. This \"soft disconnect\" condition is intended to allow calls to [[9-1-1#Inactive telephones|9-1-1 emergency services]] and to the telco business office to order telephone service, but to no other numbers.\n\n===Tollfree numbers===\nSome large telephone companies have [[toll-free number]]s set up. In most cases, these numbers remain undisclosed to prevent abuse, but MCI maintains this widely published, toll-free ANAC: '''1-800-437-7950'''. This is distinct from technical support and other lines which use [[automatic number identification|ANI]] so that a computer can automatically display the customer's account on a \"[[screen pop]]\" for the next available [[customer service]] representative: the MCI number is intended specifically for ANAC use.\n\nFormerly, some companies changed their ANAC number every month for secrecy; this is still the case with a few numbers. In one example of this concern, most payphones in the United States are assigned a telephone number and can ring if the number is called. The phone can then be used to make and receive calls by anyone, making it a potential tool in anonymous criminal activity such as [[narcotics trafficking]].{{Disputed inline|Unlisted ANAC|date=December 2014|reason=So what? Calling any number with caller ID would reveal the info. If they don't want incoming calls to a coin phone, they would disable incoming calls outright. If the ANAC number is unlisted, it's to stop the public from tying up the ANAC machine when telco installers need or want to use it.}} Where a payphone does not have any number listed on the unit, the number can be discovered by calling an ANAC service.\n\nLate in the 20th century, after [[caller ID]] and [[prepay mobile phone|pre-paid cell phone]] service became commonplace and with these services being more easily [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]]ed for criminal purposes, especially in the case of [[burner (mobile application)|burner]] phones, this type of abuse of payphones faded from concern. In Canada, this behaviour has always been more difficult. As a matter of course, incoming calls to payphones are disabled; furthermore, the Bell ANAC number is also disabled (although the telephone number is marked on the payphone itself as it is needed to report a non-working coin phone to [[6-1-1]] repair service).\n\nThere are some private national toll-free numbers that use [[automatic number identification|ANI]] and then have a computer read back the number that is calling, but these are not intended for use in identifying the customer's own phone number. They are used in order for the agent in the [[call center]] to confirm the phone the customer is calling from, so that a computer can automatically display the customer's account on a \"[[screen pop]]\" for the next available [[customer service]] representative; they are distinct from purpose-made toll-free ANAC numbers. Regardless, if one were to call one of these numbers, listen for the number confirmation and hang up, they would in effect be using this system as if it were an ANAC.\n\nOne such toll-free service is one owned by MCI - 1-800-444-4444. This number (US only) is easy to remember and, when called, will read back the number after a very short message.<ref>http://aplawrence.com/Unixart/dhanacsnumbers.html</ref> A suspended (out of service) line or an incoming only line would not be able to reach any toll-free numbers.\n\n==ANAC numbers==\n\n{{outdated section|date=December 2014}}\n\nThese numbers appear on various lists circulated on-line, many from the 1980s and 1990s. Most were published years ago by [[Phrack]], [[2600: The Hacker Quarterly|2600 Magazine]], the alt.2600 [[Usenet]] newsgroup<ref>[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-2600/faq/part2/ alt.2600 FAQ], rev 0.14, part 2 of 4 (2000/05/29) is the most common list, hopelessly out of date.</ref> (as part of the [[FAQ]]) or [[phreaking|phone phreaks]] and are now hopelessly outdated. The information is not reliable, as numbers change often. Many of the listed numbers no longer work.\n\nThe list is presented by area code, number and location. In some regions, there are several numbers, depending on the telephone company or the area code of the caller, as there can be several central offices serving some areas.\n\n===United States===\nThe [[North American Numbering Plan]] reserves 958-XXXX and 1-NPA-959-XXXX for local and long-distance test numbers in almost all USA and Canadian area codes.\n\nFrequently, a prefix outside the 958 or 959 range (such as 200, 997, 998, 999) was also listed as a test exchange, only to be reclaimed and issued as a block of standard numbers at a later date. NANPA's utilised codes report will indicate 'UA' (unassignable) for valid test prefixes; if a formerly 'UA' code newly appears on the available list or becomes an active exchange, any former test numbers from its time as a reserved prefix are presumed invalid and deprecated. [[N11 code|N11]] prefixes such as [[2-1-1|211]], [[3-1-1|311]] and [[5-1-1|511]] are also disappearing as test numbers as these codes are reassigned to local services such as city, community or highway information.\n\n;958, 959 test prefixes: The standard location for test numbers in most NANP area codes, although specific local numbers vary. 1-NPA-959 traditionally contained long-distance test numbers, but this convention is often ignored; AT&T's 959-1122 and GTE (Verizon)'s 959-1114 are local. Some area codes will flag additional codes as 'UA' or unassignable, in some cases reserving them for test numbers.\n\nA few commonly-used 958 or 959 numbers for major incumbent landline carriers:\n* 958, as a three-digit number in many former [[NYNEX]]/Bell Atlantic areas, now Verizon or [[FairPoint Communications|FairPoint]] (207 Maine, 212 New York, 215 Pennsylvania, 315 New York, 413 Massachusetts, 508 Massachusetts, 516 New York, 603 New Hampshire, 609 New Jersey, 610 Pennsylvania, 617 Massachusetts, 718 New York, 732 New Jersey, 856 New Jersey, 958 New Jersey)\n* 959-1114 [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]], for all former [[GTE]] points in California (area codes 310, 714, 760, 805); also Southwestern Virginia (276), Farmersburg/North Terre Haute/South Terre Haute/Riley Indiana (812) and Durham, North Carolina (919)\n* 959-1122 [[Pacific Bell|PacBell]] ([[AT&T]]), all points (California area codes 209, 213, 310, 408, 415, 510, 530, 619, 650, 714, 760, 805, 831, 909, 916 and 925)\n* 959-1122 [[Southwestern Bell]] (AT&T), (417 Missouri, 620 Kansas, 816 Missouri, 913 Kansas, 817 Texas, 972 Texas and 682 Texas)\n\nNumbers otherwise vary arbitrarily by locality:\n* 216: 959-9892 Akron/Canton/Cleveland/Lorain/Youngstown, Ohio\n* 301: 958-9968 Hagerstown/Rockville, Maryland\n* 309: 959-1114 Central Illinois (Frontier, Ex-Verizon)\n* 309: 959-9833 Quad City Iowa/Illinois Area (AT&T)\n* 412: 959-1114 Pittsburgh Pennsylvania (Verizon)\n* 503: 958 Portland, Oregon (CLEC, MCIMetro ATS)\n* 602/623/480: 958-7847 Phoenix Metro Area (Qwest)\n* 610: 958-4100 Allentown/Reading, Pennsylvania\n* 717: 958 Harrisburg/Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania <CenturyLink: \"Sorry but your call can not be completed\">\n* 724: 959-1114 Pittsburgh Pennsylvania (Verizon)\n* 787: 787-959-1240 Puerto Rico (PRTC)\n* 787: 787-959-1250 Puerto Rico (PRTC)\n* 805: 959-1123 Bakersfield/San Luis Obispo, California (?)

While his elder brothers were sent to the [[University of Pisa]] to pursue scholarly careers, Amerigo Vespucci embraced a [[mercantile]] life, and was hired as a clerk by the Florentine commercial [[Medici bank|house of Medici]], headed by [[Lorenzo de' Medici]].  Vespucci acquired the favor and protection of [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]] who became the head of the business after the elder Lorenzo's death in 1492.  In March 1492, the Medici dispatched the thirty-eight-year-old Vespucci and Donato Niccolini as confidential agents to look into the Medici branch office in [[C\u00e1diz]] (Spain), whose managers and dealings were under suspicion.<ref name = markham />\n\nIn April 1495, by the intrigues of Bishop [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca]], the [[Crown of Castile]] broke their monopoly deal with [[Christopher Columbus]] and began handing out licenses to other navigators for the [[West Indies]].  Just around this time (1495\u201396), Vespucci was engaged as the executor of Giannotto Berardi, an Italian merchant who had recently died in Seville. Vespucci organized the fulfillment of Berardi's outstanding contract with the Castilian crown to provide twelve vessels for the Indies.<ref name = markham />  After these were delivered, Vespucci continued as a provision contractor for Indies expeditions, and is known to have secured beef supplies for at least one (if not two) of Columbus' voyages.<ref name = markham />\n\n== Expeditions ==\n[[File:Amerigo Vespucci Uffizzi Florence.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Statue outside the [[Uffizi]], Florence]]\nVespucci claimed at the invitation of king [[Manuel I of Portugal]], Vespucci participated as observer in several voyages that explored the east coast of [[South America]] between 1499 and 1502.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} On the first of these voyages Vespucci claimed he was aboard the ship that discovered that South America extended much further south than previously thought.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nVespucci's expeditions became known in Europe after two accounts attributed to Vespucci were published between 1502 and 1503.<ref name=S>{{cite web|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-waldseemuller-map-charting-the-new-world-148815355/|title=The Waldseem\u00fcller Map: Charting the New World|author=Lester, Toby|date=December 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1507, [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]] produced a world map on which he named the new continent [[Americas|America]] after the feminine Latin version of Vespucci's first name, which is Americus.<ref name=S/> In an accompanying book, Waldseem\u00fcller published one of the Vespucci accounts, which led to criticism that Vespucci was trying to upset [[Christopher Columbus]]' glory.

''[[Mundus Novus]]'' (New World) was a Latin translation of a lost Italian letter sent from [[Lisbon]] to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici. It describes a voyage to South America in 1501\u20131502.

Printed in 1504 or 1505, it claimed to be an account of four voyages to the Americas made by Vespucci between 1497 and 1504. A Latin translation was published by the German [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]] in 1507 in ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio]]'', a book on [[cosmography]] and [[geography]], as ''Quattuor Americi Vespucij navigationes'' (Four Voyages of Amerigo Vespucci).<ref name=formisano/>\n\nOn March 22, 1508, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] made Vespucci chief navigator of Spain at a huge salary<ref>Ober, p. 234</ref> and commissioned him to found a school of navigation, in order to standardize and modernize navigation techniques used by Iberian sea captains then exploring the world. Vespucci even developed a rudimentary, but fairly accurate method of determining longitude (which only more accurate chronometers would later improve upon).<ref>Vespucci, Amerigo. \"Letter from Seville to Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de' Medici, 1500.\" Pohl, Frederick J.

Engraving by Johann Froschauer for an edition of Amerigo Vespucci's ''Mundus Novus'', published in Augsburg in 1505]]\nIn the 18th century, three unpublished familiar letters from Vespucci to Lorenzo de' Medici were rediscovered. One describes a voyage made in 1499\u20131500 which corresponds with the second of the \"four voyages\". Another was written from [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]] in 1501 in the early part of the third of the four voyages, before crossing the Atlantic. The third letter was sent from Lisbon after the completion of that voyage.<ref name=formisano />\n\nSome have suggested that Vespucci, in the two letters published in his lifetime, was exaggerating his role and constructed deliberate fabrications. However, many scholars now believe that the two letters were not written by him but were fabrications by others based in part on genuine letters by Vespucci. It was the publication and widespread circulation of the letters that might have led Waldseem\u00fcller to name the new continent [[Americas|America]] on his world map of 1507 in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]]. Vespucci used a [[Latinization (literature)|Latinised]] form of his name, ''Americus Vespucius'', in his [[Latin]] writings, which Waldseem\u00fcller used as a base for the new name, taking the feminine form ''America'', according to the prevalent view. The book accompanying the map stated: \"I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part, after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerige, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women\". It is possible that Vespucci was not aware that Waldseem\u00fcller had named the continent after him.<ref>Ray, p. 93</ref>\n\nThe two disputed letters claim that Vespucci made four voyages to America, while at most two can be verified from other sources. At the moment, there is a dispute between historians on when Vespucci visited the mainland the first time. Some historians like [[Germ\u00e1n Arciniegas]]<ref>Germ\u00e1n Arciniegas, ''Amerigo and the New World : The Life & Times of Amerigo Vespucci'', translated by Harriet de On\u00eds, Octagon (1978) {{ISBN|0-374-90280-1}}\n</ref> and Gabriel Camargo P\u00e9rez think that his first voyage was made in June 1497 with the Spanish pilot [[Juan de la Cosa]].\n\nVespucci's real historical importance may well rest more in his letters, whether he wrote them all or not, than in his discoveries. From these letters, the European public learned about the newly discovered continents of the Americas for the first time; their existence became generally known throughout Europe within a few years of the letters' publication. In his words:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=upkyAQAAMAAJ Mundus Novus: Letter to Lorenzo Pietro Di Medici], by Amerigo Vespucci;\n translated by George Tyler Northrup, Princeton University Press, 1916.</ref><blockquote>''..concerning my return from those new regions which we found and explored ... we may rightly call a new world. Because our ancestors had no knowledge of them, and it will be a matter wholly new to all those who hear about them, for this transcends the view held by our ancients, inasmuch as most of them hold that there is no continent to the south beyond the equator, but only the sea which they named the Atlantic and if some of them did aver that a continent there was, they denied with abundant argument that it was a habitable land. But that this their opinion is false and utterly opposed to the truth ... my last voyage has made manifest; for in those southern parts I have found a continent more densely peopled and abounding in animals than our Europe Asia or Africa, and, in addition, a climate milder and more delightful than in any other region known to us, as you shall learn in the following account.''</blockquote>\n\n== Voyages ==\n[[File:Domenico ghirlandaio, amerigo vespucci, ognissanti, Firenze.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Portrait of a young member of the Vespucci family, identified by [[Giorgio Vasari]] as Amerigo Vespucci.]]\nThe first and fourth voyages are perhaps fabricated, but the second and third are certain.{{ref label|5th|b|b}}\n\n=== First voyage ===\nA letter published in 1504 purports to be an account by Vespucci, written to Soderini, of a lengthy visit to the New World, leaving Spain in May 1497 and returning in October 1498. However, some modern scholars{{ref label|5th|b|b /}} have doubted that this voyage took place, and consider this letter a forgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/canaday.html|title=Life of Amerigo Vespucci|publisher=Millersville.edu|date=|accessdate=2010-02-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328011335/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/canaday.html|archivedate=2010-03-28|deadurl=yes|df=}}</ref> Whoever did write the letter makes several observations of native customs, including use of [[hammock]]s and [[sweat lodge]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1497vespucci%2Damerica.html|title=Account of alleged 1497 voyage|publisher=Fordham.edu|date=|accessdate=2010-02-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Second voyage ===\nAbout 1499\u20131500, Vespucci joined an expedition in the service of Spain, with [[Alonso de Ojeda]] (or Hojeda) as the fleet commander. The intention was to sail around the southern end of the African mainland into the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref name=OGorman>{{cite book | last = O'Gorman | first = Edmundo | authorlink = Edmundo O'Gorman | title = The Invention of America | publisher = Indiana University Press | year = 1961 | pages = 106\u2013107}}</ref> After hitting land at the coast of what is now [[Guyana]], the two seem to have separated. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] and reaching 6\u00b0S, before turning around and seeing [[Trinidad]] and the [[Orinoco River]] and returning to Spain by way of [[Hispaniola]]. The letter, to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, claims that Vespucci determined his longitude celestially\n<ref name=Vcelest>on a rainy and stormy day with calm seas, stars could be identified\n   near the horizon to judge [[latitude]]/[[longitude]]\n   celestially. Although South America's [[continental shelf]]\n   drops quickly into the deep ocean beyond the [[Orinoco River]],\n   the mouth is on the shelf, avoiding the ocean swells\n   and waves which hinder visibility of stars near the\n   horizon.  Seamen who could navigate from Europe to America\n   and back could chart stars on the horizon, especially\n   for a [[cartographer]] like Vespucci.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}</ref>\non August 23, 1499, while on this voyage. However, that claim may be fraudulent,<ref name=Vcelest /> which could cast doubt on the letter's credibility.\n\n=== Third voyage (''Letter to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici'') ===\n[[File:Amerigo Vespucci (with turban).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Portrait engraving of Vespucci by [[Crispijn van de Passe]], which titles him \"''discoverer and conqueror of Brazilian land''\"]]\nThe last certain voyage of Vespucci was led by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] in 1501\u20131502 in the service of [[Portugal]]. Departing from [[Lisbon]], the fleet sailed first to [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]] where they met two of [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]]'s ships returning from [[India]]. In a letter from Cape Verde, Vespucci says that he hopes to visit the same lands that \u00c1lvares Cabral had explored, suggesting that the intention is to sail west to Asia, as on the 1499\u20131500 voyage.<ref name=OGorman /> On reaching the coast of [[Brazil]], they sailed south along the coast of [[South America]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s bay. If his own account is to be believed, he reached the latitude of [[Patagonia]] before turning back, although this also seems doubtful, since his account does not mention the broad estuary of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]], which he must have seen if he had gotten that far south. Portuguese maps of South America, created after the voyage of Coelho and Vespucci, do not show any land south of present-day [[Canan\u00e9ia]] at 25\u00b0 S, so this may represent the southernmost extent of their voyages.\n\nAfter the first half of the expedition, Vespucci mapped [[Alpha Centauri|Alpha]] and [[Beta Centauri]], as well as the [[constellation]] [[Crux]], the Southern Cross and the Coalsack Nebula.<ref>Dekker, Elly (1990), ''Annals of Science'', vol. 47, pp. 535\u2013543.</ref> Although these [[star]]s had been known to the ancient [[Greece|Greeks]], gradual [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] had lowered them below the [[Europe]]an horizon so that they had been forgotten. On his return to Lisbon, Vespucci [[Amerigo Vespucci Letter from Seville|wrote in a letter from Seville]] to [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]] that the land masses they explored were much larger than anticipated and different from the Asia described by [[Ptolemy]] or [[Marco Polo]] and therefore, must be a New World, that is, a previously unknown fourth continent, after Europe, Asia, and Africa.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/amerigo-vespucci|title=Amerigo Vespucci|work=HISTORY|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Fourth voyage ===\n[[File:\"America\" (Engraving) Nova reperta (Speculum diuersarum imaginum speculatiuarum 1638).tif|thumb|upright=1.15|Vespucci awakens \"America\" in a [[Stradanus]] engraving (circa 1638)]]\nVespucci's fourth voyage was another expedition for the Portuguese crown down the eastern coast of Brazil, that set out in May 1503 and returned to Portugal in June 1504. Like his alleged first voyage, Vespucci's last voyage in 1503\u20131504 is also disputed to have taken place.<ref>Ray, p. 91</ref>  The only source of information for the last voyage is the ''Letter to Soderini'',<ref>Markham, pp. 52\u201356</ref> but as several modern scholars dispute Vespucci's authorship of the letter to Soderini, it is also sometimes doubted whether Vespucci undertook this trip.{{ref label|5th|b|b}}  However, Portuguese documents do confirm a voyage to Brazil was undertaken in 1503\u201304 by the captain [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], very likely the same captain of the 1501 mapping expedition (Vespucci's third voyage), and so it is quite possible that Vespucci went on board this one as well.<ref>Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto (2007: pp. 168\u2013169).</ref>  However, it is not independently confirmed Vespucci was aboard and there are some difficulties in the reported dates and details.\n\nThe letters caused controversy after Vespucci's death, especially among the supporters of Columbus who believed Columbus' priority for the discovery of America was being undermined, and seriously damaged Vespucci's reputation.<ref>Ray, pp. 96\u201397; Arciniegas (1955: p. 16)</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nVespucci was a cousin of the husband of [[Simonetta Vespucci]]. He married Maria Cerezo. One of the very few references to Amerigo's wife is contained in a royal decree dated May 22, 1512, giving his widow, Maria Cerezo a lifetime pension of ten thousand [[Maraved\u00ed|maraved\u00eds]] per annum deducted from the salary of her husband's successor.\n\n== Final years ==\nNot long after his return to Spain, Vespucci became a Spanish citizen. On March 22, 1508 he was made the [[pilot major]] of Spain by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] in honor of his discoveries. Vespucci also ran a school for navigators in the Spanish [[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n|House of Trade]], based in Seville.\n\nHe died on February 22, 1512 at his home in [[Seville]], Spain.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvP-m6EuU3UC&pg=PA20&dq=amerigo+vespucci+death&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qm2qVN3eDcaSuAT_9IHICQ&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA|title=Amerigo Vespucci: A Primary Source Biography|last=Hoogenboom|first=Lynn|date=2005-09-01|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4042-3037-8|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0eLn3I6iUtkC|title=Amerigo Vespucci|last=Donaldson-Forbes|first=Jeff|date=2002-01-01|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-5833-7|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n:{{note label|4th|a|a}}Europeans had long conceptualized the [[Afro-Eurasia]]n landmass as divided into the same three continents known today: [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]].  Once [[cosmographer]]s realized that the [[New World]] was not connected to the [[Old World|Old]] (but before its true [[geography]] was fully [[map]]ped), they considered the [[Americas]] to be a single, fourth [[continent]].\n\n:{{note label|5th|b|b}} The question of the authenticity of Vespucci's authorship of the 1504 ''Mundus Novus'' and the 1505 ''Letter of Soderini'', the only two texts published in Vespucci's lifetime, was famously raised by Magnaghi (1924). He proposed the Soderini letter was ''not'' written by Vespucci, but rather cobbled together by unscrupulous Florentine publishers, cutting and pasting together various accounts, some from Vespucci, others from elsewhere. Magnaghi was the first to propose that only the second and third voyages were true (as they are corroborated in Vespucci's other manuscript letters), while the first and fourth voyages (which are only found in the Soderini text) were fabricated by the publishers. The later (1937) discovery of a corrobotary Vespucci manuscript letter for the first voyage \u2013 the \"Ridolfi fragment\" (Formisiano, 1992: pp. 37\u201344) \u2013 means only the fourth voyage is really found in Soderini alone. The Magnaghi thesis has been a bitterly divisive factor in Vespucci scholarship.  The Magnaghi thesis was accepted and popularized by Pohl (1944) but rejected by Arciniegas (1955), who posited all four voyages as truthful.  Formisiano (1992) also rejects the Magnaghi thesis (although recognizing publishers probably fiddled with it), and declares all four voyages genuine, but in details (esp. the first) differing from Arciniegas.  Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto (2007: p. 128) declares the authenticity question \"inconclusive\", hypothesizes that the first voyage is probably just another version of the second, the third is unassailable, and the fourth probably true (but too mangled to be sure).\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Arciniegas, German (1955) ''Amerigo and the New World: The Life & Times of Amerigo Vespucci''.

In 1893 Maillol opened a tapestry workshop in Banyuls, producing works whose high technical and aesthetic quality gained him recognition for renewing this art form in France. He began making small [[terracotta]] sculptures in 1895, and within a few years his concentration on sculpture led to the abandonment of his work in tapestry.\n[[File:La Rivi\u00e8re by Aristide Maillol (Barcelona).jpg|thumb|Maillol, ''[[La Rivi\u00e8re (Maillol)|The River]]'', bronze, 1938-1943, (displayed in [[Barcelona]]) in 2009]]\nIn July 1896, Maillol married Clotilde Narcis, one of his employees at his tapestry workshop.

The figurative style of his large bronzes is perceived as an important precursor to the greater simplifications of [[Henry Moore]], and his serene classicism set a standard for European (and American) figure sculpture until the end of [[World War II]].\n\n[[Josep Pla]] said of Maillol, \"These archaic ideas, Greek, were the great novelty Maillol brought into the tendency of modern sculpture.

Canova designed, financed, and partly built the structure himself.<ref name=\"GoV\"/> The structure was to be a testament to Canova's piety.<ref name=\"Batschmann\"/> The building's design was inspired by combining the [[Parthenon]] and the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] together.<ref name=\"GoV\"/><ref name=\"CA\"/> On 11 July 1819, Canova laid the foundation stone dressed in red Papal uniform and decorated with all his medals.<ref name=\"Batschmann\"/> It first opened in 1830, and was finally completed in 1836.<ref name=\"Batschmann\"/> After the foundation-stone of this edifice had been laid, Canova returned to Rome; but every succeeding autumn he continued to visit Possagno to direct the workmen and encourage them with rewards.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nDuring the period that intervened between commencing operations at Possagno and his death, he executed or finished some of his most striking works.

This version is now owned jointly by the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and the [[National Galleries of Scotland]], and is alternately displayed at each.\n\n==Artistic process==\n{{rquote|right|''Canova's system of work concentrated on the initial idea, and on the final carving of the marble''<ref name=\"DoA-5\"/>}}\n\nCanova's sculptures fall into three categories: Heroic compositions, compositions of grace, and sepulchral monuments.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> In each of these, Canova's underlying artistic motivations were to challenge, if not compete, with classical statues.<ref name=\"GoV\"/>\n\nCanova refused to take in pupils and students,<ref name=\"DoA-5\"/> but would hire workers to carve the initial figure from the marble.

He was schooled traditionally, took a craftsman-like approach to his work, and desired academic recognition,<ref name=\"H76\">Hale, 76.</ref> although he was never accepted into Paris's foremost school of art.\n\nRodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply pocketed surface in [[clay]]. Many of his most notable sculptures were criticized during his lifetime. They clashed with predominant figurative sculpture traditions, in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic. Rodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and [[allegory]], modeled the human body with realism, and celebrated individual character and physicality. Rodin was sensitive to the controversy surrounding his work, but refused to change his style. Successive works brought increasing favor from the government and the artistic community.\n\nFrom the unexpected realism of his first major figure \u2013 inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy \u2013 to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew, and he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin's work after his [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|World's Fair]] exhibit, and he kept company with a variety of high-profile intellectuals and artists. His students included [[Antoine Bourdelle]], [[Camille Claudel]], [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]], and [[Charles Despiau]]. He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, in the last year of both their lives. His sculptures suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades, his legacy solidified. Rodin remains one of the few sculptors widely known outside the visual arts community.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Formative years===\nRodin was born in 1840 into a working-class family in Paris, the second child of Marie Cheffer and Jean-Baptiste Rodin, who was a police department clerk.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=''[[The New Yorker]]'' |first=Peter |last=Schjeldahl |title=The Stubborn Genius of Auguste Rodin |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/02/the-stubborn-genius-of-auguste-rodin |quote=Rodin was a child of the working class. (His father was a police clerk.) |access-date=October 7, 2017}}</ref> He was largely self-educated,<ref>\"(Fran\u00e7ois) Auguste (Ren\u00e9) Rodin.\" ''International Dictionary of Art and Artists''. St. James Press, 1990. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Thomson Gale. 2006.</ref> and began to draw at age 10. Between ages 14 and 17, he attended the ''Petite \u00c9cole'', a school specializing in art and mathematics where he studied drawing and painting<!--with Belloc-->. His drawing teacher [[Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran]] believed in first developing the personality of his students so that they observed with their own eyes and drew from their recollections, and Rodin expressed appreciation for his teacher much later in life.<ref>Jianou & Goldscheider, 31.</ref> It was at Petite \u00c9cole that he met [[Jules Dalou]] and [[Alphonse Legros]].\n\n[[File:Auguste Rodin, Paris, c1862 by Charles Hippolyte Aubry.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Rodin circa 1862.]]\nIn 1857, Rodin submitted a clay model of a companion to the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in an attempt to win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied.<ref name=\"nytobit\"/> Entrance requirements were not particularly high at the ''Grande \u00c9cole'',<ref>Hale, 40.</ref> so the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have been due to the judges' [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. He left the ''Petite \u00c9cole'' in 1857 and earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.\n\nRodin's sister Maria, two years his senior, died of [[peritonitis]] in a convent in 1862, and Rodin was anguished with guilt because he had introduced her to an unfaithful suitor. He turned away from art and joined the Catholic order of the [[Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament]]. Saint [[Peter Julian Eymard]], founder and head of the congregation, recognized Rodin's talent and sensed his lack of suitability for the order, so he encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. Rodin returned to work as a decorator while taking classes with animal sculptor [[Antoine-Louis Barye]]. The teacher's attention to detail and his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion significantly influenced Rodin.<ref name=\"morey\">{{cite journal|last=Morey|first=C. R.|title=The Art of Auguste Rodin|journal=The Bulletin of the College Art Association of America|volume=1|issue=4|year=1918|pages=145\u2013154|doi=10.2307/3046338|jstor=3046338}}</ref>\n\nIn 1864, Rodin began to live with a young seamstress named [[Rose Beuret]] (born in June 1844),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rodin-web.org/bio/bio_long_1.htm|title=Auguste Rodin - Biography|work=rodin-web.org|accessdate=14 March 2017}}</ref> with whom he stayed for the rest of his life, with varying commitment. The couple had a son named Auguste-Eug\u00e8ne Beuret (1866\u20131934).<ref>Date of death from Elsen, 206.</ref> That year, Rodin offered his first sculpture for exhibition and entered the studio of [[Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse]], a successful mass producer of ''objets d'art''. Rodin worked as Carrier-Belleuse' chief assistant until 1870, designing roof decorations and staircase and doorway embellishments. With the arrival of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Rodin was called to serve in the French National Guard, but his service was brief due to his near-sightedness.<ref>Jianou & Goldscheider, 34.</ref> Decorators' work had dwindled because of the war, yet Rodin needed to support his family, as poverty was a continual difficulty for him until about the age of 30.<ref name = \"tabhhj\">Jianou & Goldscheider, 35.</ref> Carrier-Belleuse soon asked him to join him in Belgium, where they worked on ornamentation for the [[Brussels Stock Exchange]].\n\nRodin planned to stay in Belgium a few months, but he spent the next six years outside of France. It was a pivotal time in his life.<ref name = \"tabhhj\"/> He had acquired skill and experience as a craftsman, but no one had yet seen his art, which sat in his workshop since he could not afford castings. His relationship with Carrier-Belleuse had deteriorated, but he found other employment in Brussels, displaying some works at salons, and his companion Rose soon joined him there. Having saved enough money to travel, Rodin visited Italy for two months in 1875, where he was drawn to the work of [[Donatello]] and [[Michelangelo]]. Their work had a profound effect on his artistic direction.<ref>Hale, 49\u201350.</ref> Rodin said, \"It is Michelangelo who has freed me from academic sculpture.\"<ref>Taillandier, 91.</ref> Returning to Belgium, he began work on ''[[The Age of Bronze]]'', a life-size male figure whose realism brought Rodin attention but led to accusations of sculptural cheating\u2014its realism and scale was such that critics alleged he had cast the work from a living model. Much of Rodin's later work was explicitly larger or smaller than life, in part to demonstrate the folly of such accusations.\n\n===Artistic independence===\n[[File:Auguste Rodin, 1884.jpg|thumb|left|''Auguste Rodin'', [[John Singer Sargent]], 1884]]\n\nRose Beuret and Rodin returned to Paris in 1877, moving into a small flat on the [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]]. Misfortune surrounded Rodin: his mother, who had wanted to see her son marry, was dead, and his father was blind and senile, cared for by Rodin's sister-in-law, Aunt Th\u00e9r\u00e8se. Rodin's eleven-year-old son Auguste, possibly developmentally delayed, was also in the ever-helpful Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's care. Rodin had essentially abandoned his son for six years,<ref>Hale, 65.</ref> and would have a very limited relationship with him throughout his life. Father and son now joined the couple in their flat, with Rose as caretaker. The charges of fakery surrounding ''The Age of Bronze'' continued. Rodin increasingly sought more soothing female companionship in Paris, and Rose stayed in the background.\n\nRodin earned his living collaborating with more established sculptors on public commissions, primarily memorials and [[neo-baroque]] architectural pieces in the style of [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]].<ref name=\"j638\">Janson, 638.</ref> In competitions for commissions he submitted models of [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and [[Lazare Carnot]], all to no avail. On his own time, he worked on studies leading to the creation of his next important work, ''St. John the Baptist Preaching''.\n\n[[File:Camille Claudel.jpg|alt=Head and shoulders of a young, dark haired woman looking downward.|thumb|right|180px|[[Camille Claudel]] (1864\u20131943)]]\n[[File:August rodin dornac 1898.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rodin in his studio.]]\n\nIn 1880, Carrier-Belleuse&nbsp;\u2013 now art director of the [[S\u00e8vres]] national [[porcelain]] factory&nbsp;\u2013 offered Rodin a part-time position as a designer. The offer was in part a gesture of reconciliation, and Rodin accepted. That part of Rodin which appreciated 18th-century tastes was aroused, and he immersed himself in designs for vases and table ornaments that brought the factory renown across Europe.<ref>Hale, 70.</ref>\n\nThe artistic community appreciated his work in this vein, and Rodin was invited to [[Paris Salon]]s by such friends as writer [[L\u00e9on Cladel]]. During his early appearances at these social events, Rodin seemed shy;<ref name=\"H71\">Hale, 71.</ref> in his later years, as his fame grew, he displayed the loquaciousness and temperament for which he is better known. French statesman [[Leon Gambetta]] expressed a desire to meet Rodin, and the sculptor impressed him when they met at a salon. Gambetta spoke of Rodin in turn to several government ministers, likely including [[:fr:Edmond Turquet|Edmund Turquet]], the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Fine Arts, whom Rodin eventually met.<ref name=\"H71\"/>\n\nRodin's relationship with Turquet was rewarding: through him, he won the 1880 commission to create a [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] for a planned museum of decorative arts. Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate ''[[Gates of Hell]]'', an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built. Many of the portal's figures became sculptures in themselves, including Rodin's most famous, ''[[The Thinker]]'' and ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]''. With the museum commission came a free studio, granting Rodin a new level of artistic freedom. Soon, he stopped working at the porcelain factory; his income came from private commissions.\n\nIn 1883, Rodin agreed to supervise a course for sculptor [[Alfred Boucher]] in his absence, where he met the 18-year-old [[Camille Claudel]]. The two formed a passionate but stormy relationship and influenced each other artistically. Claudel inspired Rodin as a model for many of his figures, and she was a talented sculptor, assisting him on commissions.\n\nAlthough busy with ''The Gates of Hell'', Rodin won other commissions. He pursued an opportunity to create a historical monument for the town of [[Calais]]. For a monument to French author [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]], Rodin was chosen in 1891. His execution of both sculptures clashed with traditional tastes, and met with varying degrees of disapproval from the organizations that sponsored the commissions. Still, Rodin was gaining support from diverse sources that propelled him toward fame.\n\nIn 1889, the Paris Salon invited Rodin to be a judge on its artistic jury. Though Rodin's career was on the rise, Claudel and Beuret were becoming increasingly impatient with Rodin's \"double life\". Claudel and Rodin shared an [[wikt:atelier|atelier]] at a small old castle, but Rodin refused to relinquish his ties to Beuret, his loyal companion during the lean years, and mother of his son. During one absence, Rodin wrote to Beuret, \"I think of how much you must have loved me to put up with my caprices...I remain, in all tenderness, your Rodin.\"<ref>Hale, 75.</ref> <!-- no source: He never fulfilled a contract with Claudel to give up all contact with other women and marry her.-->\n\nClaudel and Rodin parted in 1898.<ref>{{cite web|title=(1) Camille Claudel|publisher=Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press|url=http://www.groveart.com/shared/views/article.html?section=art.018005.1|author=Ward-Jackson, Philip|accessdate=19 December 2006}}</ref> Claudel suffered an alleged nervous breakdown several years later and was confined to an institution for 30 years by her family, until her death in 1943, despite numerous attempts by doctors to explain to her mother and [[Paul Claudel|brother]] that she was sane.\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Rodin The bronze age.jpg|alt=Life-sized nude stature of a male on a pedestal on display in a museum.|thumb|right|150px|''[[The Age of Bronze]]'' (1877).]]\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - M. Auguste Rodin - Edward Steichen.jpg|thumb|left|150px|M. Auguste Rodin - photo by [[Edward Steichen]], ca. 1911]]\n\nIn 1864, Rodin submitted his first sculpture for exhibition, ''The Man with the Broken Nose'', to the [[Paris Salon]]. The subject was an elderly neighbourhood street porter. The unconventional [[bronze]] piece was not a traditional [[bust (sculpture)|bust]], but instead the head was \"broken off\" at the neck, the nose was flattened and crooked, and the back of the head was absent, having fallen off the clay model in an accident. The work emphasized texture and the emotional state of the subject; it illustrated the \"unfinishedness\" that would characterize many of Rodin's later sculptures.<ref>Janson, 637.</ref> The Salon rejected the piece.\n\n===Early figures: the inspiration of Italy===\nIn Brussels, Rodin created his first full-scale work, ''[[The Age of Bronze]]'', having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure drew inspiration from Michelangelo's ''[[Dying Slave]]'', which Rodin had observed at the [[Louvre]]. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally with his right hand atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.\n\nIn 1877, the work debuted in Brussels and then was shown at the Paris Salon. The statue's apparent lack of a theme was troubling to critics&nbsp;\u2013 commemorating neither mythology nor a noble historical event&nbsp;\u2013 and it is not clear whether Rodin intended a theme.<ref>Hale, 50.</ref> He first titled the work ''The Vanquished'', in which form the left hand held a spear, but he removed the spear because it obstructed the torso from certain angles. After two more intermediary titles, Rodin settled on ''The Age of Bronze'', suggesting the [[Bronze Age]], and in Rodin's words, \"man arising from nature\".<ref name=\"H51\">Hale, 51.</ref> Later, however, Rodin said that he had had in mind \"just a simple piece of sculpture without reference to subject\".<ref name=\"H51\"/>\n\nIts mastery of form, light, and shadow made the work look so realistic that Rodin was accused of ''surmoulage''&nbsp;\u2013 having taken a cast from a living model. Rodin vigorously denied the charges, writing to newspapers and having photographs taken of the model to prove how the sculpture differed. He demanded an inquiry and was eventually exonerated by a committee of sculptors. Leaving aside the false charges, the piece polarized critics. It had barely won acceptance for display at the Paris Salon, and criticism likened it to \"a statue of a sleepwalker\" and called it \"an astonishingly accurate copy of a low type\".<ref name=\"H51\"/> Others rallied to defend the piece and Rodin's integrity. The government minister Turquet admired the piece, and ''The Age of Bronze'' was purchased by the state for 2,200 [[franc]]s&nbsp;\u2013 what it had cost Rodin to have it cast in bronze.<ref name=\"H51\"/>\n\n[[File:St-John-the-Baptist-Preaching.jpg|alt=Nude man holding is hand out, as if explaining a point.|thumb|upright|''St. John the Baptist Preaching'' (1878).]]\nA second male nude, ''[[Saint John the Baptist (Rodin)|St. John the Baptist Preaching]]'', was completed in 1878. Rodin sought to avoid another charge of ''surmoulage'' by making the statue larger than life: ''St. John'' stands almost 6' 7\"<nowiki>''</nowiki> (2&nbsp;m). While ''The Age of Bronze'' is statically posed, ''St. John'' gestures and seems to move toward the viewer. The effect of walking is achieved despite the figure having both feet firmly on the ground&nbsp;\u2013 a technical achievement that was lost on most contemporary critics.<ref>Hale, 80.</ref> Rodin chose this contradictory position to, in his words, \"display simultaneously...views of an object which in fact can be seen only successively\".<ref name=\"H68\">Hale, 68.</ref>\n\nDespite the title, ''St. John the Baptist Preaching'' did not have an obviously religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin felt compelled to capture. Rodin thought of [[John the Baptist]], and carried that association into the title of the work.<ref name=\"H68\"/> In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.<ref name=\"H68\"/>\n\nRegardless of the immediate receptions of ''St. John'' and ''The Age of Bronze'', Rodin had achieved a new degree of fame. Students sought him at his studio, praising his work and scorning the charges of ''surmoulage''. The artistic community knew his name.\n\n===''The Gates of Hell''===\n[[File:Z\u00fcrich - Kunsthaus - Rodin's H\u00f6llentor IMG 7384 ShiftN.jpg|alt=Ornate, bronze door panels and frame showing figures and scenes in relief.|thumb|upright|''[[The Gates of Hell]]'' (unfinished), [[Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich]]]]\n\nA commission to create a [[Gate|portal]] for Paris' planned Museum of Decorative Arts was awarded to Rodin in 1880.<ref name=\"j638\"/> Although the museum was never built, Rodin worked throughout his life on ''[[The Gates of Hell]]'', a monumental sculptural group depicting scenes from [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[The Divine Comedy|Inferno]]'' in high relief.

He pursued the commission, interested in the medieval motif and patriotic theme. The mayor of Calais was tempted to hire Rodin on the spot upon visiting his studio, and soon the memorial was approved, with Rodin as its architect. It would commemorate the six townspeople of Calais who offered their lives to save their fellow citizens.\n\nDuring the [[Hundred Years' War]], the army of [[King Edward III]] besieged Calais, and Edward ordered that the town's population be killed ''en masse''. He agreed to spare them if six of the principal citizens would come to him prepared to die, bareheaded and barefooted and with ropes around their necks. When they came, he ordered that they be executed, but pardoned them when his queen, [[Philippa of Hainault]], begged him to spare their lives. ''[[The Burghers of Calais]]'' depicts the men as they are leaving for the king's camp, carrying keys to the town's gates and citadel.\n\nRodin began the project in 1884, inspired by the chronicles of the siege by [[Jean Froissart]].<ref name=\"swedberg\">{{cite journal|last=Swedberg|first=Richard|title=Auguste Rodin's ''The Burghers of Calais'': The Career of a Sculpture and its Appeal to Civic Heroism|journal=Theory, Culture, & Society|volume=22|issue=2|pages=45\u201367|year=2005|doi=10.1177/0263276405051665}}</ref> Though the town envisioned an [[allegorical]], heroic piece centered on Eustache de Saint-Pierre, the eldest of the six men, Rodin conceived the sculpture as a study in the varied and complex emotions under which all six men were laboring. One year into the commission, the Calais committee was not impressed with Rodin's progress. Rodin indicated his willingness to end the project rather than change his design to meet the committee's conservative expectations, but Calais said to continue.\n\nIn 1889, ''The Burghers of Calais'' was first displayed to general acclaim. It is a bronze sculpture weighing two tons (1,814&nbsp;kg), and its figures are 6.6&nbsp;ft (2&nbsp;m) tall.<ref name=\"swedberg\"/> The six men portrayed do not display a united, heroic front;<ref name=\"apollo\">{{cite journal|author=Stocker, Mark|title=A simple sculptor or an apostle of perversion?|journal=Apollo|pages=94\u201397|volume=164|issue=537|date=November 2006}}</ref> rather, each is isolated from his brothers, individually deliberating and struggling with his expected fate. Rodin soon proposed that the monument's high pedestal be eliminated, wanting to move the sculpture to ground level so that viewers could \"penetrate to the heart of the subject\".<ref>Hale, 117.</ref> At ground level, the figures' positions lead the viewer around the work, and subtly suggest their common movement forward.<ref>Hale, 115</ref>\n\nThe committee was incensed by the untraditional proposal, but Rodin would not yield. In 1895, Calais succeeded in having ''Burghers'' displayed in their preferred form: the work was placed in front of a public garden on a high platform, surrounded by a cast-iron railing. Rodin had wanted it located near the town hall, where it would engage the public. Only after damage during the First World War, subsequent storage, and Rodin's death was the sculpture displayed as he had intended.

Like many of Rodin's public commissions, ''Monument to Victor Hugo'' was met with resistance because it did not fit conventional expectations. Commenting on Rodin's monument to Victor Hugo, ''[[The Times]]'' in 1909 expressed that \"there is some show of reason in the complaint that [Rodin's] conceptions are sometimes unsuited to his medium, and that in such cases they overstrain his vast technical powers\".<ref>{{cite news|title=M.

The society commissioned Rodin to create the memorial in 1891, and Rodin spent years developing the concept for his sculpture. Challenged in finding an appropriate representation of Balzac given the author's rotund physique, Rodin produced many studies: portraits, full-length figures in the nude, wearing a [[frock coat]], or in a [[robe]]&nbsp;\u2013 a replica of which Rodin had requested. The realized sculpture displays Balzac cloaked in the drapery, looking forcefully into the distance with deeply gouged features. Rodin's intent had been to show Balzac at the moment of conceiving a work<ref name=\"times1711\">{{cite news|title=Auguste Rodin.

After this experience, Rodin did not complete another public commission. Only in 1939 was ''[[Monument to Balzac]]'' cast in bronze and placed on the [[Boulevard du Montparnasse]] at the intersection with [[Boulevard Raspail]].\n\n===Other works===\n[[File:Auguste Rodin par Camille Claudel (mus\u00e9e Rodin) (8026456955).jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Auguste Rodin'', 1892 by [[Camille Claudel]]]]\nThe popularity of Rodin's most famous sculptures tends to obscure his total creative output.

His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.<ref name=\"H76\"/>\n\nRodin's talent for surface modeling allowed him to let every part of the body speak for the whole. The male's passion in ''The Thinker'' is suggested by the grip of his toes on the rock, the rigidness of his back, and the differentiation of his hands.<ref name=\"morey\"/> Speaking of ''The Thinker'', Rodin illuminated his aesthetic: \"What makes my Thinker think is that he thinks not only with his brain, with his knitted brow, his distended nostrils and compressed lips, but with every muscle of his arms, back, and legs, with his clenched fist and gripping toes.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/sculpture/flash/zone2-2.htm|title=NGA Sculpture Galleries: Auguste Rodin|publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.|accessdate=12 December 2006|format=[[Adobe Flash]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061130113846/http://www.nga.gov/collection/sculpture/flash/zone2-2.htm| archivedate= 30 November 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nSculptural fragments to Rodin were autonomous works, and he considered them the essence of his artistic statement. His fragments&nbsp;\u2013 perhaps lacking arms, legs, or a head&nbsp;\u2013 took sculpture further from its traditional role of portraying likenesses, and into a realm where forms existed for their own sake.<ref>Hale, 69.</ref> Notable examples are ''[[The Walking Man]]'', ''Meditation without Arms'', and ''Iris, Messenger of the Gods''.\n\nRodin saw suffering and conflict as hallmarks of modern art. \"Nothing, really, is more moving than the maddened beast, dying from unfulfilled desire and asking in vain for grace to quell its passion.\"<ref name=\"alhadeff\"/> [[Charles Baudelaire]] echoed those themes, and was among Rodin's favorite poets. Rodin enjoyed music, especially the opera composer [[Gluck]], and wrote a book about [[List of cathedrals in France|French cathedrals]]. He owned a work by the as-yet-unrecognized [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]], and admired the forgotten [[El Greco]].<ref name=\"werner\"/>\n\n===Method===\n[[File:Rodin The Shade.jpg|thumb|''The Shade'', (1880-81) [[High Museum of Art]], Atlanta]]\n[[File:Age of bronze plaster.jpg|thumb|right|A [[plaster]] of ''[[The Age of Bronze]]'']]\n\nInstead of copying traditional academic postures, Rodin preferred his models to move naturally around his studio (despite their nakedness).<ref name=\"morey\"/> The sculptor often made quick sketches in clay that were later fine-tuned, cast in plaster, and cast in bronze or carved from marble. Rodin's focus was on the handling of clay.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Quoted in Jianou & Goldscheider, 62.</ref>\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw sat for a portrait and gave an idea of Rodin's technique: \"While he worked, he achieved a number of miracles. At the end of the first fifteen minutes, after having given a simple idea of the human form to the block of clay, he produced by the action of his thumb a bust so living that I would have taken it away with me to relieve the sculptor of any further work.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nHe described the evolution of his bust over a month, passing through \"all the stages of art's evolution\": first, a \"[[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] masterpiece\", then \"[[Bernini]] intermingled\", then an elegant [[Houdon]]. \"The hand of Rodin worked not as the hand of a sculptor works, but as the work of ''[[Elan Vital (term)|Elan Vital]]''. The ''Hand of God'' is his own hand.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAfter he completed his work in clay, he employed highly skilled assistants to re-sculpt his compositions at larger sizes (including any of his large-scale monuments such as ''The Thinker''), to cast the clay compositions into plaster or bronze, and to carve his marbles. Rodin's major innovation was to capitalize on such multi-staged processes of 19th century sculpture and their reliance on plaster casting.\n\nSince clay deteriorates rapidly if not kept wet or fired into a terra-cotta, sculptors used plaster casts as a means of securing the composition they would make from the fugitive material that is clay. This was common practice amongst Rodin's contemporaries, and sculptors would exhibit plaster casts with the hopes that they would be commissioned to have the works made in a more permanent material. Rodin, however, would have multiple plasters made and treat them as the raw material of sculpture, recombining their parts and figures into new compositions, and new names.\n\nAs Rodin's practice developed into the 1890s, he became more and more radical in his pursuit of fragmentation, the combination of figures at different scales, and the making of new compositions from his earlier work. A prime example of this is the bold ''[[The Walking Man]]'' (1899\u20131900), which was exhibited as his major one-person show in 1900. This is composed of two sculptures from the 1870s that Rodin found in his studio&nbsp;\u2013 a broken and damaged torso that had fallen into neglect and the lower extremities of a statuette version of his 1878 ''St. John the Baptist Preaching'' he was having re-sculpted at a reduced scale.\n\nWithout finessing the join between upper and lower, between torso and legs, Rodin created a work that many sculptors at the time and subsequently have seen as one of his strongest and most singular works. This is despite the fact that the object conveys two different styles, exhibits two different attitudes toward finish, and lacks any attempt to hide the arbitrary fusion of these two components. It was the freedom and creativity with which Rodin used these practices&nbsp;\u2013 along with his activation surfaces of sculptures through traces of his own touch and with his more open attitude toward bodily pose, sensual subject matter, and non-realistic surface&nbsp;\u2013 that marked Rodin's re-making of traditional 19th century sculptural techniques into the prototype for modern sculpture.\n\n==Later years (1900\u20131917)==\n[[File:Legros -buste de Rodin (dessin).jpg|thumb|left|upright|A portrait of Rodin by his friend [[Alphonse Legros]]]]\n\nBy 1900, Rodin's artistic reputation was entrenched. Gaining exposure from a pavilion of his artwork set up near the 1900 [[World's Fair]] (''Exposition Universelle'') in Paris, he received requests to make busts of prominent people internationally,<ref name=\"bell\"/> while his assistants at the atelier produced duplicates of his works. His income from portrait commissions alone totaled probably 200,000 francs a year.<ref>Hale, 147.</ref> As Rodin's fame grew, he attracted many followers, including the German poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], and authors [[Octave Mirbeau]], [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]], and [[Oscar Wilde]].<ref name=\"apollo\"/>\n\nRilke stayed with Rodin in 1905 and 1906, and did administrative work for him; he would later write a laudatory [[monograph]] on the sculptor. Rodin and Beuret's modest country estate in [[Meudon]], purchased in 1897, was a host to such visitors as [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward]], dancer [[Isadora Duncan]], and [[harpsichord]]ist [[Wanda Landowska]]. Rodin moved to the city in 1908, renting the main floor of the [[H\u00f4tel Biron]], an 18th-century townhouse.

Because of his technique and the frankness of some of his work, he did not have an easy time selling his work to American industrialists. However, he came to know [[Sarah Tyson Hallowell]] (1846\u20131924), a curator from Chicago who visited Paris to arrange exhibitions at the large Interstate Expositions of the 1870s and 1880s. Hallowell was not only a curator but an adviser and a facilitator who was trusted by a number of prominent American collectors to suggest works for their collections, the most prominent of these being the Chicago hotelier [[Potter Palmer]] and his wife, [[Bertha Palmer]] (1849\u20131918).\n\nThe next opportunity for Rodin in America was the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]].<ref>The Indefatigable Miss Hallowell, Page 6</ref> Hallowell wanted to help promote Rodin's work and he suggested a solo exhibition, which she wrote him was ''beaucoup moins beau que l'original'' but impossible, outside the rules. Instead, she suggested he send a number of works for her loan exhibition of French art from American collections and she told him she would list them as being part of an American collection.<ref>Rodin: The Shape of Genius, Page 399</ref> Rodin sent Hallowell three works, ''Cupid and Psyche'', ''Sphinx'' and ''[[Andromeda (Rodin)|Andromeda]]''. All nudes, these works provoked great controversy and were ultimately hidden behind a drape with special permission given for viewers to see them.<ref name=\"The Documented Image, Page 97\">The Documented Image, Page 97</ref>\n\n''Bust of Dalou'' and ''Burgher of Calais'' were on display in the official French pavilion at the fair and so between the works that were on display and those that were not, he was noticed. However, the works he gave Hallowell to sell found no takers, but she soon brought the controversial Quaker-born financier [[Charles Yerkes]] (1837\u20131905) into the fold and he purchased two large marbles for his Chicago manse;<ref name=\"The Documented Image, Page 97\"/> Yerkes was likely the first American to own a Rodin sculpture.<ref>Franch, John (2006).

In appreciation for her efforts at unlocking the American market, Rodin eventually presented Hallowell with a bronze, a marble and a terra cotta.

He first visited England in 1881, where his friend, the artist [[Alphonse Legros]], had introduced him to the poet [[William Ernest Henley]]. With his personal connections and enthusiasm for Rodin's art, Henley was most responsible for Rodin's reception in Britain.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Newton|first=Joy|title='Rodin Is a British Institution'|journal=The Burlington Magazine|volume=136|issue=1101|year=1994|pages=822\u2013828}}</ref> (Rodin later returned the favor by sculpting a [[:File:HenleyRodin.JPG|bust of Henley]] that was used as the frontispiece to Henley's collected works and, after his death, on his monument in London.)<ref name=b1>{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Henley, William Ernest|volume=2|pages=244, 246}}</ref>\n\nThrough Henley, Rodin met [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and [[Robert Browning]], in whom he found further support.<ref>Hale, 73.</ref> Encouraged by the enthusiasm of British artists, students, and high society for his art, Rodin donated a significant selection of his works to the nation in 1914.\n\nAfter the revitalization of the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] in 1890, Rodin served as the body's vice-president.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography |publisher=Mus\u00e9e Rodin |url=http://www.musee-rodin.fr/en/chronology-auguste-rodin |accessdate=15 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207201859/http://www.musee-rodin.fr/en/chronology-auguste-rodin |archivedate=7 December 2011 }}</ref> In 1903, Rodin was elected president of the [[International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers|International Society of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers]].

Rodin met American dancer [[Isadora Duncan]] in 1900, attempted to seduce her,<ref>Hale, 10.</ref> and the next year sketched studies of her and her students.

However, it is formally dated as 1700 in official use, such as the listing for the act in the ''[[Chronological Table of the Statutes]]'', because acts passed before the [[Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793]] came into force are dated by the year in which the relevant parliamentary session began, which, in this case, was 1700 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]]).</ref> to settle the [[order of succession|succession]] to the [[List of English monarchs|English]] and [[List of Irish monarchs|Irish]] crowns on [[Protestant]]s only. The next Protestant in line to the throne was the [[Electress]] [[Sophia of Hanover]], a granddaughter of [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland and I of England]]. After her the crowns would descend only to her non-[[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] heirs.\n\nThe act was prompted by the failure of [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]], as well as of Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], to produce any surviving children, and the [[Roman Catholic]] religion of all other members of the [[House of Stuart]]. The line of [[Sophia of Hanover]] was the most junior among the Stuarts, but consisted of convinced Protestants. Sophia died on 8 June 1714, before the death of Queen Anne on 1 August 1714. On Queen Anne's death, Sophia's son duly became [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] and started the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian dynasty]] in Britain.\n\nThe act played a key role in the formation of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. England and Scotland had [[Union of the Crowns|shared a monarch]] since 1603, but had remained separately governed countries. The [[Scottish Parliament (pre-1707)|Scottish parliament]] was more reluctant than the [[English Parliament|English]] to abandon the House of Stuart, members of which had been [[Scottish monarchs]] long before they became [[English monarchs|English ones]]. English pressure on Scotland to accept the Act of Settlement was one factor leading to the [[Acts of Union 1707|parliamentary union of the two countries]] in 1707.\n\nUnder the Act of Settlement anyone who became a Roman Catholic, or who married one, became disqualified to inherit the throne. The act also placed limits on both the role of foreigners in the British government and the power of the monarch with respect to the Parliament of England. Some of those provisions have been altered by subsequent legislation.\n\nAlong with the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], the Act of Settlement remains today one of the main constitutional laws governing the [[Succession to the British throne|succession]] not only to the [[throne of the United Kingdom]], but to those of the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, whether by assumption or by [[patriation]].<ref name=Topo>{{cite journal| last=Toporoski| first=Richard| title=The Invisible Crown| journal=Monarchy Canada| issue=Summer 1998| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| location=Toronto| year=1998| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm| accessdate=16 May 2009| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209220704/http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm| archivedate=9 February 2008}}</ref> The Act of Settlement cannot be altered in any realm except by that realm's own parliament and, by [[Convention (norm)#Government|convention]], only with the consent of all the other realms, as it touches on the succession to the [[Commonwealth realm#The Crown in the Commonwealth realms|shared crown]].<ref>{{Cite legislation UK |type=act |year=1931 |chapter=4 |act=The Statute of Westminster 1931}}</ref>\n\nThe original documents are deposited in the Lower Saxon State Archives in Hanover, Germany.<ref>Lower Saxon State Archives, Hanover (HStAH), Cal.

The Bill of Rights also provided that the line of succession would go through their descendants, then through Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] and her descendants, and then to the issue of William III by a possible later marriage. During the debate, the House of Lords had attempted to append Sophia and her descendants to the line of succession, but the amendment failed in the Commons.<ref name=melville>{{cite book|last=Melville|first=Lewis|title=The First George in Hanover and England|year=1908|publisher=Isaac Pitman and Sons|location=London|pages=130\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nMary II died childless in 1694, after which William III did not remarry. In 1700, [[Prince William, Duke of Gloucester]], who was Anne's only child to survive infancy, died of a fever at the age of 11. Thus, Anne was left as the only person in line to the throne. The Bill of Rights excluded Catholics from the throne, which ruled out James II and his descendants. However, it did not provide for the further succession after Anne. Parliament thus saw the need to settle the succession on Sophia and her descendants, and thereby guarantee the continuity of the Crown in the Protestant line.\n\nWith religion and lineage initially decided, the ascendancy of William of Orange in 1689 would also bring his partiality to his foreign favourites that followed. By 1701 English jealousy of foreigners was rampant, and action was considered necessary for correction.<ref name=\"Henriq\"/>\n\n==Provisions==\nThe Act of Settlement provided that the throne would pass to the [[Sophia of Hanover|Electress Sophia of Hanover]]&nbsp;\u2013 a granddaughter of [[James I of England|James VI and I]] and a niece of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]&nbsp;\u2013 and her descendants, but it excluded \"for ever\" \"all and every Person and Persons who ... is are or shall be reconciled to or shall hold Communion with the [[Holy See|See]] or [[Roman Catholic Church|Church of Rome]] or shall profess the Popish Religion or shall marry a Papist\". Thus, those who were Roman Catholics, and those who married Roman Catholics, were barred from ascending the throne. Eight additional provisions of the act would only come into effect upon the death of both William and Anne:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/1700/1565208.html |title=Act of Settlement 1700 |publisher=[[British and Irish Legal Information Institute|BAILII]] |accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n* The monarch \"shall join in communion with the [[Church of England]]\". This was intended to ensure the exclusion of a Roman Catholic monarch. Along with James II's perceived despotism, his religion was the main cause of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and of the previous linked religious and succession problems which had been resolved by the joint monarchy of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]].\n* If a person not native to England comes to the throne, England will not wage war for \"any dominions or territories which do not belong to the Crown of England, without the consent of Parliament\". This was far-sighted, because when a member of the [[House of Hanover]] ascended the British throne, he would retain the territories of the [[Kingdom of Hanover|Electorate of Hanover]] in what is now [[Lower Saxony]], then part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. This provision has been dormant since [[Queen Victoria]] ascended the throne, because she did not inherit Hanover under the [[Salic Law]]s of the German-speaking states.\n* No monarch may leave \"the dominions of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], or [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]\", without the consent of Parliament. This provision was repealed in 1716, at the request of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] who was also the [[prince-elector|Elector of Hanover]] and Duke of [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; because of this, and also for personal reasons, he wished to visit Hanover from time to time.<ref name=tarkowp547>{{cite journal |last=Naamani Tarkow |first=I. |year=1943 |title= The Significance of the Act of Settlement in the Evolution of English Democracy |journal=Political Science Quarterly |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=537\u2013561 at p. 547 |doi=10.2307/2144947}}</ref>\n* All government matters within the jurisdiction of the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] were to be transacted there, and all council resolutions were to be signed by those who advised and consented to them. This was because Parliament wanted to know who was deciding policies, as sometimes councillors' signatures normally attached to resolutions were absent.

It has however been disapplied in particular cases by a number of other statutes.\n* No person who has an office under the monarch, or receives a pension from the Crown, was to be a Member of Parliament. This provision was inserted to avoid unwelcome royal influence over the House of Commons. It remains in force, but with several exceptions. (As a side effect, this provision means that members of the Commons seeking to resign from parliament can get round the age-old prohibition on [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation]] by obtaining a [[sinecure]] in the control of the Crown; while several offices have historically been used for this purpose, two are currently in use: appointments generally alternate between the stewardships of the [[Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds|Chiltern Hundreds]] and of the [[Steward of the Manor of Northstead|Manor of Northstead]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/P11.pdf |work=House of Commons Information Office |title=The Chiltern Hundreds |date=1 June 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003101512/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/P11.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>)\n* Judges' commissions are valid ''quamdiu se bene gesserint'' (during good behaviour) and if they do not behave themselves, they can be removed only by both Houses of Parliament (or in other Commonwealth realms the one House of Parliament, depending on the legislature's structure.) This provision was the result of various monarchs influencing judges' decisions, and its purpose was to assure [[judicial independence]]. This [[letters patent|patent]] was used prior the 1701 but did not prevent [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] from removing [[John Walter (judge)|Sir John Walter]] as [[Chief Baron of the Exchequer]].\n* That \"no Pardon under the [[Great Seal of England]] be pleadable to an Impeachment by the Commons in Parliament\". This meant in effect that no pardon by the monarch was to save someone from being [[Impeachment|impeached]] by the House of Commons.\n\n==Effects==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2011}}\nFor different reasons, various [[constitutionalist]]s have praised the Act of Settlement: [[Henry Hallam]] called the Act \"the seal of our constitutional laws\" and [[David Lindsay Keir]] placed its importance above the Bill of Rights of 1689.<ref>Quoted in Tarkow, p. 537.</ref> Naamani Tarkow has written: \"If one is to make sweeping statements, one may say that, save [[Magna Carta]] (more truly, its implications), the Act of Settlement is probably the most significant statute in English history\".<ref>Tarkow, p. 561.</ref>{{explain|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Kingdom of Great Britain===\n[[Image:Act of Settlement 3323.jpg|thumb|right|Facsimile of the Act of Settlement sent to Electress Sophia of Hanover]]\n[[Image:Kurfuerstin Sophie.JPG|thumb|right|''Sophia, Electress of Hanover'']]\n\nThe Act of Settlement was, in many ways, the major cause of the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] of [[Scotland]] with [[England and Wales]] to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] was not happy with the Act of Settlement and, in response, passed the [[Act of Security]] in 1704, through which Scotland reserved the right to choose its own successor to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. Stemming from this, the Parliament of England decided that, to ensure the stability and future prosperity of Great Britain, full union of the two parliaments and nations was essential before Anne's death.\n\nIt used a combination of exclusionary legislation (the [[Alien Act 1705]]), politics, and [[bribery]] to achieve this within three years under the [[Act of Union 1707]]. This success was in marked contrast to the four attempts at political union between 1606 and 1689, which all failed owing to a lack of political will in both kingdoms. By virtue of Article II of the [[Treaty of Union]], which defined the succession to the throne of Great Britain, the Act of Settlement became part of [[Scots Law]] as well.\n\n===Succession to the Crown===\nIn addition to [[James II of England|James II]] (who died a few months after the act received royal assent) and his Roman Catholic children, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Prince James]] and the [[Louisa Maria Teresa Stuart|Princess Royal]], the act also excluded the descendants of King James's sister, [[Princess Henrietta of England|Henrietta]], the youngest daughter of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Henrietta's daughter, [[Anne Marie d'Orl\u00e9ans|Anne]], was then the Queen of Sardinia and a Roman Catholic; [[Jacobite succession|Jacobite pretenders]] after 1807 are descended from her.\n\nWith the legitimate descendants of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] either childless (in the case of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]) or Roman Catholic, Parliament's choice was limited to the Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover, the daughter of the late [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]], who was the only other child of [[James I of England|King James I]] not to have died in childhood. Elizabeth had borne nine children who reached adulthood, of whom [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia]] was the youngest daughter. However, in 1701, Sophia was the senior Protestant with a legitimate claim to the English throne; Parliament passed over senior living representatives of lines which included [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine|Elizabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans]]; [[Louis Otto, Prince of Salm]], and his sisters; [[Anne Henriette of Bavaria|Anne Henriette, Princess of Cond\u00e9]]; [[Benedicta Henrietta of the Palatinate|Benedicta Henrietta, Duchess of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]]; and Sophia's sister, [[Louise Hollandine of the Palatinate]] because they were all Roman Catholic.\n\n===Removal from the succession due to Catholicism===\nSince the Act's passing the most senior living member of the Royal Family to have married a Roman Catholic, and thereby to have been removed from the line of succession, is [[Prince Michael of Kent]], who married [[Princess Michael of Kent|Baroness Marie-Christine von Reibnitz]] in 1978; he was fifteenth in the line of succession at the time. He was restored to the line of succession in 2015 when the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] came into force, and became 34th in line.<ref name=royalcentral>{{cite web |url=http://royalcentral.co.uk/state/what-do-the-new-royal-succession-changes-mean-46610 |title=What do the new royal succession changes mean? |publisher=Royal Central |date=26 March 2015 |accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe next most senior living descendant of the Electress Sophia who had been ineligible to succeed on this ground is [[George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews]], the elder son of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], who married the Roman Catholic [[Sylvana Windsor, Countess of St Andrews|Sylvana Palma Tomaselli]] in 1988. His son, [[Edward Windsor, Lord Downpatrick|Lord Downpatrick]], converted to Roman Catholicism in 2003 and is the most senior descendant of Sophia to be barred as a result of his religion. More recently, [[Peter Phillips]], the son of [[Anne, Princess Royal]], and eleventh in line to the throne, married [[Autumn Phillips|Autumn Kelly]]; Kelly had been brought up as a Roman Catholic, but she converted to [[Anglicanism]] prior to the wedding. Had she not done so, Phillips would have forfeited his place in the succession upon their marriage.\n\nExcluding those princesses who have married into Roman Catholic royal families, such as [[Marie of Romania|Marie of Edinburgh]], [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] and [[Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Princess Beatrice of Edinburgh]], one member of the Royal Family (that is, with the style of ''[[Royal Highness]]'') has converted to Roman Catholicism since the passage of the Act: the [[Katharine, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]], wife of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]] who converted on 14 January 1994, but her husband did not lose his place in the succession because she was an Anglican at the time of their marriage.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Present status==\nAs well as being part of the law of the United Kingdom, the Act of Settlement was received into the laws of all the countries and territories over which the British monarch reigned. It remains part of the laws of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s and the relevant jurisdictions within those realms. In accordance with established convention, the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] and later laws, the Act of Settlement (along with the other laws governing the succession of the Commonwealth realms) may only be changed with the agreement of all the realms (and, in some federal realms, the constituent members of those federations).\n\n==Amendment proposals==\nChallenges have been made against the Act of Settlement, especially its provisions regarding Roman Catholics and [[Primogeniture|preference for males]]. However, legislating for alterations to the Act is a complex process, since the Act is a common denominator in the shared succession of all the [[Commonwealth realm]]s. The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] acknowledges by established convention that any changes to the rules of succession may be made only with the agreement of all of the states involved, with concurrent amendments to be made by each state's parliament or parliaments. Further, as the current monarch's eldest child and, in turn, his eldest child, are Anglican males, any change to the succession laws would have no immediate implications. Consequently, there was little public concern with the issues and debate had been confined largely to academic circles until, in November 2010, the announcement that [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] was [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton|to marry]]. This raised the question of what would happen if he were to produce first a daughter and then a son.\n\n''[[The Times]]'' reported on 6 November 1995 that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] had said on that day to [[Tony Blair]] and [[Paddy Ashdown]] that \"Catholics should be able to ascend to the British throne\".

[[Norman Spector]] called in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' for [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] to address the issue of the act's bar on Catholics, saying Phillips' marriage to Kelly would be the first time the provisions of the act would bear directly on Canada\u2014Phillips would be barred from acceding to the Canadian throne because he married a Roman Catholic Canadian.<ref name=Spector/> (In fact, [[George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews|the Earl of St Andrews]] had already lost his place in the line of succession when he married the Roman Catholic Canadian [[Sylvana Windsor, Countess of St Andrews|Sylvana Palma Tomaselli]] in 1988. But St Andrews' place in the line of succession was significantly lower than Phillips'.) Criticism of the Act of Settlement due to the Phillips\u2013Kelly marriage was muted when Autumn Kelly converted to Anglicanism shortly before her marriage, thus preserving her husband's place in the line of succession.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|Succession to the British throne#Reform}}\n\nFrom time to time there has been debate over repealing the clause that prevents Roman Catholics, or those who marry one, from ascending to the British throne. Proponents of repeal argue that the clause is a bigoted [[anachronism]]; [[Thomas Winning|Cardinal Winning]], who was leader of the Roman Catholic Church in [[Scotland]], called the act an \"insult\" to Catholics. [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor|Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor]], the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England, pointed out that Prince William (later the Duke of Cambridge) \"can marry by law a [[Hindu]], a [[Buddhist]], anyone, but not a Roman Catholic\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2021615.stm |work=[[BBC News Online]] |title=Let monarchy marry Catholics |date=2 June 2002 |accessdate=30 March 2010 }}</ref> Opponents of repeal, such as [[Enoch Powell]] and [[Adrian Hilton]], believe that it would lead to the disestablishment of the Church of England as the state religion if a Roman Catholic were to come to the throne. They also note that the monarch must swear to defend the faith and be a member of the [[Anglican Communion]], but that a Roman Catholic monarch would, like all Roman Catholics, owe allegiance to the Pope. This would, according to opponents of repeal, amount to a loss of [[sovereignty]] for the Anglican Church.\n\nWhen in December 1978 there was media speculation that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] might marry a Roman Catholic, Powell defended the provision that excludes Roman Catholics from ascending the throne, claiming his objection was not rooted in religious bigotry but in political considerations. He stated a Roman Catholic monarch would mean the acceptance of a source of authority external to the realm and \"in the literal sense, foreign to the [[Queen-in-Parliament|Crown-in-Parliament]] ... Between Roman Catholicism and [[royal supremacy]] there is, as St [[Thomas More]] concluded, no reconciliation\". Powell concluded that a Roman Catholic crown would be the destruction of the Church of England because \"it would contradict the essential character of that church\".\n\nHe continued:\n<blockquote>When [[Thomas Hobbes]] wrote that \"the Papacy is no other than the ghost of the deceased [[Roman Empire]] sitting crowned upon the grave thereof\", he was promulgating an enormously important truth. Authority in the Roman Church is the exertion of that ''imperium'' from which England in the 16th century finally and decisively declared its national independence as the ''alter imperium'', the \"other empire\", of which [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] declared \"This realm of England is an empire\" ... It would signal the beginning of the end of the British monarchy. It would portend the eventual surrender of everything that has made us, and keeps us still, a nation.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Like the Roman: The Life of Enoch Powell]] |last=Heffer |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Heffer |year=1999 |publisher=Phoenix Giant |location=London |isbn=0-7538-0820-X |page= |pages=810\u2013812}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Scottish Parliament]] unanimously passed a motion in 1999 calling for the complete removal of any discrimination linked to the monarchy and the repeal of the Act of Settlement.<ref name=Scotsman2011>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/catholics_still_barred_from_throne_despite_law_change_1_1937348 |title=Catholics still barred from throne despite law change |date=28 October 2011 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |accessdate=29 October 2011 }}</ref> The following year, ''[[The Guardian]]'' challenged the succession law in court,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/06/monarchy.claredyer |last=Dyer |first=Clare |title=A Challenge to the Crown: now is the time for change |date=6 December 2000 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=16 January 2010 }}</ref> claiming that it violated the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which provides,\n<blockquote>The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.</blockquote>\n\nAs the Convention nowhere lists the right to succeed to the Crown as a human right, the challenge was rejected.\n\n[[Adrian Hilton]], writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in 2003, defended the Act of Settlement as not \"irrational prejudice or blind bigotry\", but claimed that it was passed because \"the nation had learnt that when a Roman Catholic monarch is upon the throne, religious and civil liberty is lost\". He points to the Pope's claiming universal jurisdiction, and Hilton argues that \"it would be intolerable to have, as the sovereign of a Protestant and free country, one who owes any allegiance to the head of any other state\" and contends that, if such situation came about, \"we will have undone centuries of common law\". He said that because the Roman Catholic Church [[apostolicae curae|does not recognise]] the Church of England as an apostolic church, a Roman Catholic monarch who abided by their faith's doctrine would be obliged to view Anglican and [[Church of Scotland]] archbishops, bishops, and clergy as part of the [[laity]] and therefore \"lacking the ordained authority to preach and celebrate the sacraments\". (Hilton noted that the Church of Scotland's [[Presbyterian polity]] does not include bishops or archbishops.) Hilton said a Roman Catholic monarch would be unable to be crowned by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and notes that other European states have similar religious provisions for their monarchs: [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]], whose constitutions compel their monarchs to be [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]; the [[Netherlands]], which has a constitution requiring its monarchs be members of the Protestant [[House of Orange]]; and [[Belgium]], which has a constitution that provides for the succession to be through Roman Catholic houses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200311/ai_n9341744 |last=Hilton |first=Adrian |title=The price of liberty |newspaper=[[The Spectator]] |date=8 November 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604070506/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200311/ai_n9341744 |archivedate= 4 June 2007 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, a private member's bill\u2014the [[Succession to the Crown Bill 2004|Succession to the Crown Bill]]\u2014was introduced in the House of Lords.

Various motives have driven such occurrences, including demanding the release of certain [[Incarceration|inmate]]s (notably [[Indian Airlines Flight 814|IC-814]]), highlighting the grievances of a particular community (notably [[Air France Flight 8969|AF 8969]]), or [[political asylum]] (notably [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961|ET 961]]). Hijackers also have used aircraft as a weapon to target particular locations (notably during the [[September 11 attacks]]).\n\nHijackings for hostages commonly produce an armed standoff during a period of negotiation between hijackers and authorities, followed by some form of settlement. Settlements do not always meet the hijackers' original demands. If the hijackers' demands are deemed too great and the perpetrators show no inclination to surrender, authorities sometimes employ armed [[Counter-terrorism|special forces]] to attempt a rescue of the hostages (notably [[Lufthansa Flight 181]] and [[Operation Entebbe|Air France Flight 139]]). \n\nBecause it is widely considered an act of [[terrorism]] and how it can seriously endanger the lives of those upon the aircraft and others, aircraft hijacking is often treated as an extremely serious crime. In most jurisdictions of the world, aircraft hijacking is punishable by life imprisonment or a lengthy prison sentence. In most jurisdictions where the death penalty is a legal punishment, aircraft hijacking is a [[capital crime]], including in China, India, and the U.S. states of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Mississippi]].\n\n[[File:S\u00e9curit\u00e9 A\u00e9rienne Afrique.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Warning posters in a Central African airport, in French and English.

Howard \"Doc\" DeCelles states that he was actually the victim of the first skyjacking in December 1929. He was flying a postal route for the Mexican company Transportes Aeras Transcontinentales, ferrying mail from San Luis Potos\u00ed to Toreon and then on to Guadalajara. He was approached by Gen. Saturnino Cedillo, governor of the state of San Luis Potos\u00ed and one of the last remaining lieutenants of Pancho Villa. Cedillo was accompanied by several other men. He was told through an interpreter that he had no choice in the matter; he had to fly the group to their chosen destination. He stalled long enough to convey the information to his boss, who told him to cooperate. He had no maps, but was guided by the men as he flew above Mexican mountains. He landed on a road as directed, and was held captive for several hours under armed guard. He eventually was released with a \"Buenos\" from Cedillo and his staff. DeCelles kept his flight log, according to the article, but he did not file a report with authorities. He went on to work for the FAA in Fort Worth after his flying career.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole paragraph}}\n\n===Record-setting hijackings===\n{{Expand section|date=January 2015}}\n* 1931: The first recorded aircraft hijack took place on February 21, 1931, in [[Arequipa]], [[Peru]]. Byron Richards, flying a [[Ford Tri-Motor]], was approached on the ground by armed revolutionaries. He refused to fly them anywhere and after a 10-day standoff, Richards was informed that the revolution was successful and he could go in return for flying one group member to [[Lima]].<ref>30 years later Richards was again the victim of a failed hijacking attempt. A father and son boarded his [[Continental Airlines]] [[Boeing 707]] in [[El Paso, Texas]] and tried to force him at gunpoint to fly the plane to [[Cuba]] hoping for a cash reward from [[Fidel Castro]]. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents and police chased the plane down the runway and shot out its tires, averting the hijacking.

None were aviators but they managed to take off. However, the aircraft crashed in [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o de Meriti]], killing the four men. Apparently, the hijack was related to the events of the [[Constitutionalist Revolution]] in S\u00e3o Paulo and it is considered to be the first hijack that took place in Brazil.\n* 28 October 1939: The first documented murder-hijacking. Earnest P. \"Larry\" Pletch shot Carl Bivens, 39, a flight instructor who was offering Pletch lessons in a yellow Taylor Cub monoplane with tandem controls in the air after taking off in Brookfield, Missouri. Bivens, instructing from the front seat, was shot in the back of the head twice. \"Carl was telling me I had a natural ability and I should follow that line,\" Pletch later confessed to prosecutors in Missouri. \"I had a revolver in my pocket and without saying a word to him, I took it out of my overalls and I fired a bullet into the back of his head. He never knew what struck him.\" The ''[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]'' called it \"One of the most spectacular crimes of the 20th century, and what is believed to be the first airplane kidnap murder on record.\" Because it occurred somewhere over three Missouri counties, and involved interstate transport of a stolen airplane, it raised questions in legal circles about where, by whom, and even whether he could be prosecuted. Ernest Pletch pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison without parole. However, his sentence was commuted (probably due to [[prison overcrowding]]), and he was released on 1 March 1957, after serving 17 years. He died in Eldredge, Missouri, in June 2001.<ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/murderous-story-americas-first-hijacking-180956152/ \"The Murderous Story of America's First Hijacking\"], Mike Dash, smithsonian.com (5 August 2015)</ref><ref>http://www.magbloom.com/PDF/bloom20/Bloom_20_Killer.pdf</ref>\n* 1948: The first hijacking of a commercial flight was of the Cathay Pacific ''[[Miss Macao]]'' on 16 July 1948.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/May-June-08/On-this-Day--The-First-Commercial-Flight-is-Hijacked.html |title=On This Day: First Commercial Flight Hijacked |date=16 July 2010 |accessdate=24 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103075904/http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/May-June-08/On-this-Day--The-First-Commercial-Flight-is-Hijacked.html |archivedate=3 January 2012 }}</ref> \n* 1956: The first hijacking of a commercial flight with political purposes was of the [[Lloyd A\u00e9reo Boliviano|Lloyd Aereo Boliviano]] on 26 September 1956.

They were being transported from [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz, Bolivia]] to the town of El Alto, in [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz]]. There, a political group was waiting to take them to a concentration camp located in Carahuara de Carangas, [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]]. The 47 prisoners gained control of the aircraft in mid-flight and rerouted the airplane to [[Tartagal, Argentina]]. Two of the 47 prisoners took control of the aircraft controls and received instructions to again reroute to [[Salta|Salta, Argentina]] as the airfield in Tartagal was not big enough for the DC-4. They did and moments later arrived safely to the city of Salta. They told the government of the injustice they were submitted to, and received [[political asylum]].\n* 1968: The longest hijacking of a commercial flight (until 1999) according to [[BBC News]], was the [[El Al Flight 426 hijacking]] by [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) militants on 23 July 1968, lasting 40 days.<ref name=\"HistoryHijackings\">{{cite news|title=History of airliner hijackings|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1578183.stm |accessdate=8 December 2015|publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=3 October 2001}}</ref>\n*1999: 12 April, 1999, six ELN members hijacked a Fokker 50 of [[Avianca|Avianca Colombian Airlines]] [[flight 9463]]([[:es:Vuelo 9463 de Avianca|es]]), flying from Bogot\u00e1 to Bucaramanga.

[[Aviator|Pilot]]s and [[flight attendant]]s are still trained to adopt the \"Common Strategy\" tactic, which was approved by the United States [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]. It teaches crew members to comply with the hijackers' demands, get the plane to land safely and then let the security forces handle the situation. Crew members should advise passengers to sit quietly in order to increase their chances of survival. They were also trained not to make any  heroic  moves that could endanger themselves or other people. The FAA realized that the longer a hijacking persisted, the more likely it would end peacefully with the hijackers reaching their goal;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch3.htm|title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|publisher=}}</ref> often, during the epidemic of skyjackings in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the end result was an inconvenient but otherwise harmless trip to Cuba for the passengers.\n\nLater examples of active passenger and crew member resistance occurred when passengers and flight attendants of [[2001 failed shoe bomb attempt|American Airlines Flight 63]] from [[Paris]] to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] on December 22, 2001, teamed up to help prevent [[Richard Reid (shoe bomber)|Richard Reid]] from igniting explosives hidden in his shoes. Another example is when a few passengers and flight attendants teamed up to subdue [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]] who attempted to detonate explosives sewn into his underwear aboard [[Northwest Flight 253]] on December 25, 2009. Flight attendants and pilots now receive extensive anti-hijacking and self-defense training designed to thwart a hijacking or bombing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.secure-skies.org/crewtraining.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126110320/http://secure-skies.org/crewtraining.php |archivedate=2013-11-26 |df= }} Secure Skies (website)</ref>\n\nIn 2012, six hijackers hijacked [[Tianjin Airlines Flight 7554|Tianjin Airlines flight 7554]]. Two of the hijackers died from severe injuries sustained during a fight with passengers and crew who attempted to subdue them. A doctor led elderly and children away from the violence. The hijackers had weapons which they used to attack cabin crew and passengers.\n\nSix policemen were on board the aircraft. They helped remove explosives and weapons from the hijackers. A group of resourceful passengers protected the cockpit door using a beverage cart that was rolled in front of the door. The pilot heard screaming and fighting from the cabin. A first class flight attendant was injured trying to stop three hijackers who were in first class from entering the cockpit. Seven passengers were injured during the fights on board the aircraft. It was the first violent hijacking since the 9/11 attacks in North America. When the pilot realized what was happening, he decided to fly the aircraft back to the airport. Once the plane landed, police surrounded it.\n\n===Informing air traffic control===\n{{globalize/US|date=July 2015|section=yes}}\nTo alert air traffic control that an aircraft is being hijacked, a pilot under duress should [[Transponder (aviation)#Transponder codes|squawk]] 7500 or vocally, by radio communication, transmit \"(Aircraft callsign); Transponder seven five zero zero.\" This should be done when possible and safe. An air traffic controller who suspects an aircraft may have been hijacked may ask the pilot to confirm \"squawking assigned code.\" If the aircraft is ''not'' being hijacked, the pilot should ''not'' squawk 7500 and should inform the controller accordingly. A pilot under [[duress]] may also elect to respond that the aircraft is not being hijacked, but then neglect to change to a different squawk code. In this case, the controller would make no further requests and immediately inform the appropriate authorities. A complete lack of a response would also be taken to indicate a possible hijacking. Of course, a loss of radio communications may also be the cause for a lack of response, in which case a pilot would usually squawk 7600 anyway.<ref>Aeronautical Information Manual, paragraph 6-3-4, \"Special Emergency (Air Piracy)\", [[Federal Aviation Administration]], 1999</ref>\n\nOn 9/11, the suicide hijackers did not make any attempt to contact ground control to inform anyone about their hijackings, nor engage in any dialogue or negotiations. However, the hijacker-pilot of Flight 11 and the ringleader of the terrorist cell, [[Mohamed Atta]], mistakenly transmitted announcements to [[Air traffic control|ATC]], meaning to go through the Boeing 767. Also, onboard flight attendants [[Madeline Amy Sweeney|Amy Sweeney]] and [[Betty Ong]] called the [[American Airlines]] office, telling the workers that Flight 11 was hijacked. 9/11 hijacker-pilot [[Ziad Jarrah]] aboard Flight 93 also made a similar error when he mistakenly transmitted two announcements to ATC about the hijacking.\n\n===Prevention===\nCockpit doors on most commercial aircraft have been strengthened and are now bullet resistant. In the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, Austria, the Netherlands and France, [[Air Marshal (civil aviation)|air marshal]]s have also been added to some flights to deter and thwart hijackers. [[Airport security]] plays a major role in preventing hijackers. Screening passengers with [[metal detector]]s and luggage with [[x-ray]] machines helps prevent weapons from being taken on an aircraft. Along with the [[FAA]], the [[FBI]] also monitors terror suspects. Any person who is seen as a threat to civil aviation is banned from flying.\n\n==Shooting down aircraft==\nAccording to reports, U.S. fighter pilots have been trained to shoot down hijacked commercial airliners if necessary.<ref>{{cite web|title=US pilots train shooting civilian planes|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3161354.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 November 2012|date=3 October 2003}}</ref> Other countries, such as India, Poland, and Russia, have enacted similar laws or decrees that allow the downing of hijacked planes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4172487.stm|work=BBC News|title=Poland to down hijacked aircraft|date=13 January 2005|accessdate=30 March 2010}}</ref> However, in September 2008 the Polish Constitutional Court ruled that the Polish rules were unconstitutional, and voided them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trybunal.gov.pl/eng/summaries/documents/K_44_07_GB.pdf |title=Trybuna\u0142 Konstytucyjny |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201044248/http://trybunal.gov.pl/eng/summaries/documents/K_44_07_GB.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-01 }}</ref>\n\n===India===\nIndia published its new anti-hijacking policy in August 2005.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4150640.stm \"India adopts tough hijack policy\"]. [[BBC News]], 14 August 2005</ref> The policy came into force after the [[Cabinet Committee on Security]] (CCS) approved it. The main points of the policy are:\n* Any attempt to hijack will be considered an act of aggression against the country and will prompt a response fit for an aggressor.\n* Hijackers, if captured alive, will be put on trial, convicted, and sentenced to death.\n* Hijackers will be engaged in negotiations only to bring the incident to an end, to comfort passengers and to prevent loss of lives.\n* The hijacked plane will be shot down if it is deemed to become a missile heading for strategic targets.\n* The hijacked plane will be escorted by armed fighter aircraft and will be forced to land.\n* A hijacked grounded plane will not be allowed to take off under any circumstance.\n\nThe list of strategic targets is prepared by the Bureau of Civil Aviation in India. The decision to shoot down a plane is taken by CCS. However, due to the shortage of time, whoever \u2013 the prime minister, the defense minister or the home minister \u2013 can be reached first will take the call. In situations in which an aircraft becomes a threat while taking off \u2013 which gives very little reaction time \u2013 a decision on shooting it down may be taken by an Indian Air Force officer not below the rank of Assistant Chief of Air Staff (Operations).\n\n===Germany===\nIn January 2005, a federal law came into force in [[Germany]] \u2013 the ''[[Luftsicherheitsgesetz]]'' \u2013 that allowed \"direct action by armed force\" against a hijacked aircraft to prevent a 9/11-type attack. However, in February 2006 the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] struck down these provisions of the law, stating such preventive measures were unconstitutional and would essentially be state-sponsored murder, even if such an act would save many more lives on the ground.

The detailed analysis of the quoted article shows{{according to whom|date=August 2014}} that in order of an unlawful takeover of an aircraft to take place, and at the same time to start the application of the convention, three conditions should be met:\n \n# The hijacking or control takeover of an aircraft must be a result of unlawful use of violence or an attempt to use violence; \n# An aircraft should be \"in flight\" (that is, according to Article 1, paragraph 3 of the Tokyo Convention, from the moment when power is applied for the purpose of take-off until the moment when the landing run ends); \n# The unlawful act must be committed on board an aircraft (that is, by a person on board an aircraft, e.g. a passenger or crew member. In case of an assault \"from the outside\", such an offense would be treated as an act of aviation piracy).\n\nHowever, even without the order of the captain, any crewmember or passenger can take reasonable measures, when he or she has reasonable grounds to believe that such action is necessary to protect the safety of the aircraft, or of people or property therein. The captain may decide to disembark a suspected person on the territory of any country, where the aircraft would land, and that country must agree to that (Articles 8 and 12 of the Convention).\n\nContinuation of the passengers' journey was a provision that first appeared in the Tokyo Convention (Article 11).<ref>''Sovereignty and Jurisdiction in Airspace and Outer Space: Legal Criteria for Spatial Delimitation'', by Gbenga Oduntan, [[Routledge]], 2011, pg. 118.</ref>\n\n===Hague Convention===\nThe [[Hague Hijacking Convention|Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft]] (known as The Hague Convention) went into effect on 14 October 1971.

[[Homer]] is assumed to refer to this fortification when he mentions the \"strong-built House of [[Erechtheus]]\" (''[[Odyssey]]'' 7.81). At some time before the 13th century BC, an earthquake caused a fissure near the northeastern edge of the Acropolis. This fissure extended some 35 meters to a bed of soft marl in which a well was dug.<ref>Hurwit 2000, p. 78.</ref> An elaborate set of stairs was built and the well served as an invaluable, protected source of drinking water during times of siege for some portion of the Mycenaean period.<ref>[http://www.hydriaproject.net/en/cases/athens/acropolis_hill/mycenaean.html \"The springs and fountains of the Acropolis hill\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728143221/http://www.hydriaproject.net/en/cases/athens/acropolis_hill/mycenaean.html |date=2013-07-28 }}, Hydria Project.

For this reason, Athenians decided to stop the construction of the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Olympieion]] temple which was connoted with the tyrant Peisistratos and his sons and, instead, used the [[Piraeus]] limestone destined for the Olympieion to build the Older Parthenon. In order to accommodate the new temple, the south part of the summit was cleared, made level by adding some 8,000 two-ton blocks of limestone, a foundation {{convert|11|m|0|abbr=on}} deep at some points, and the rest was filled with soil kept in place by the retaining wall. However, after the victorious [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BC, the plan was revised and marble was used instead.

He adopted the name of \"Brother [[Spartacus]]\" within the order. Even encyclopedia references vary on the goal of the order, such as ''New Advent'' saying the Order was not [[egalitarian]] or democratic internally, but sought to promote the doctrines of equality and freedom throughout society;<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\">Catholic Encyclopedia: [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07661b.htm Illuminati],</ref> while others like ''Collier's'' have said the aim was to combat religion and foster rationalism in its place.<ref>{{cite book |last=Couch |first=William |date=1956 |title=Collier's Encyclopedia, Volume 10 |url= |location= |publisher=Crowell-Collier Publishing Company |page=370 |isbn= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nThe actual character of the society was an elaborate network of spies and counter-spies. Each isolated cell of initiates reported to a superior, whom they did not know: a party structure that was effectively adopted by some later groups.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\" />\n\nWeishaupt was initiated into the [[Masonic lodge]] \"Theodor zum guten Rath\", at Munich in 1777. His project of \"illumination, enlightening the understanding by the sun of reason, which will dispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice\" was an unwelcome reform.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\" /> He used [[Freemasonry]] to recruit for his own quasi-masonic society, with the goal of \"perfecting human nature\" through re-education to achieve a communal state with nature, freed of government and organized religion. Presenting their own system as pure masonry, Weishaupt and [[Adolph Freiherr Knigge]], who organised his ritual structure, greatly expanded the secret organisation.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\" />\n\nContrary to Immanuel Kant's [[Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?|famous dictum]] that [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (and Weishaupt's Order was in some respects an expression of the Enlightenment Movement) was the passage by man out of his 'self-imposed immaturity' through daring to 'make use of his own reason, without the guidance of another,' Weishaupt's Order of Illuminati prescribed in great detail everything which the members had obediently to read and think, so that Dr. Wolfgang Riedel has commented that this approach to illumination or enlightenment constituted a degradation and twisting of the Kantian principle of Enlightenment.<ref>Dr. Wolfgang Riedel, 'Aufklaerung und Macht', in ''Die Weimarer Klassik und ihre Geheimbuende'', ed. by W. Mueller-Seidel and W. Riedel, Koenigshausen und Neumann, 2002, p. 112</ref> Riedel writes:\n\n'The independence of thought and judgement required by Kant ... was specifically prevented by the Order of the Illuminati's rules and regulations. Enlightenment takes place here, if it takes place at all, precisely ''under''  the direction of another, namely under that of the \"Superiors\" [of the Order].<ref>Dr. Wolfgang Riedel, ''Die Weimarer Klassik und ihre Geheimbuende'',2002, p. 112</ref>\n\nWeishaupt's radical rationalism and vocabulary were not likely to succeed. Writings that were intercepted in 1784 were interpreted as seditious, and the Society was banned by the government of [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Karl Theodor]], Elector of Bavaria, in 1784. Weishaupt lost his position at the University of Ingolstadt and fled Bavaria.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\" />\n\n==Activities in exile==\nHe received the assistance of [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg|Duke Ernest II]] of [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]] (1745\u20131804), and lived in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]] writing a series of works on illuminism, including ''A Complete History of the Persecutions of the Illuminati in Bavaria'' (1785), ''A Picture of Illuminism'' (1786), ''An Apology for the Illuminati'' (1786), and ''An Improved System of Illuminism'' (1787). Adam Weishaupt died in Gotha on 18 November 1830.<ref name=\"ADB Vol. 41\"/><ref name=\"Engel 1906\"/><ref name=\"van D\u00fclmen 1975\"/><ref name=\"Stauffer 1918\"/> He was survived by his second wife, Anna Maria (n\u00e9e Sausenhofer), and his children Nanette, Charlotte, Ernst, [[Karl von Weishaupt|Karl]], Eduard, and Alfred.<ref name=\"Engel 1906\"/> Weishaupt was buried next to his son Wilhelm who preceded him in death in 1802.\n\nAfter Weishaupt's Order of Illuminati was banned and its members dispersed, it left behind no enduring traces of an influence, not even on its own erstwhile members, who went on in the future to develop in quite different directions.<ref>Dr. Eberhard Weis in ''Die Weimarer Klassik und ihre Geheimb\u00fcnde'', edited by Professor Walter M\u00fcller-Seidel and Professor Wolfgang Riedel, K\u00f6nigshausen und Neumann, 2003, pp. 100-101</ref>\n\n==Assessment of character and intentions==\n[[File:Illuminaten397.jpg|thumb|[[Death mask]] of Adam Weishaupt]]\n\nWeishaupt's character and intentions have been variously assessed from those such as [[Augustin Barruel]] and [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]] who regarded him as a 'human devil' and saw his mission as one of malevolent destructiveness.  While others such as [[Thomas Jefferson]], who wrote in a letter to [[James Madison]] that \"Barruel\u2019s own parts of the book are perfectly the ravings of a Bedlamite\" and considered Weishaupt as an \"enthusiastic Philanthropist\" who believed in the indefinite perfectibility of man and his intention was simply to \"reinstate natural religion, and by diffusing the light of his morality, to teach us to govern ourselves\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-31-02-0297|title=From Thomas Jefferson to Bishop James Madison, 31 January 1800}}</ref>\n\nIn his defense, Weishaupt wrote a ''Kurze Rechtfertigung meiner Absichten''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Kurze_Rechtfertigung_meiner_Absichten.html?id=WggXMQAACAAJ&redir_esc=y|title=Kurze Rechtfertigung meiner Absichten - Adam Weishaupt|website=www.books.google.com}}</ref> in 1787 (A Brief Justification of my Intentions). A translation was done by Dr. Tony Page in which he wrote:\n\n\"Weishaupt\u2019s plan was to educate Illuminati followers in the highest levels of humanity and morality (basing his teachings on the supremacy of Reason, allied with the spirit of the Golden Rule of not doing to others what one would not wish done to oneself), so that if Illuminati alumni subsequently attained positions of significance and power (such as in the fields of education and politics), they could exert a benevolent and uplifting influence upon society at large. His project was utopian and naively optimistic, and he himself was certainly not without flaws of character \u2013 but neither he nor his plan was evil or violent in and of themselves. It is one of the deplorable and tragic ironies of history that a man who tried to inculcate virtue, philanthropy, social justice and morality has become one of the great hate-figures of 21st-century \u2018conspiracy\u2019 thinking.\"<ref>Dr. Tony Page (translator and editor), ''Supplement to the Justification of My Intentions by Adam Weishaupt'', Justice Publications, Bangkok, Amazon Kindle, 2014, p. 1</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nAdam Weishaupt is referred to repeatedly in ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'', written by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]], as the founder of the [[Illuminati]] and as an impostor who killed [[George Washington]] and took his place as the first president of the United States. Washington's portrait on the [[U.S. one-dollar bill]] is said to actually be Weishaupt's.\n\nAnother version of Adam Weishaupt appears in the extensive comic book novel ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark]]'' by [[Dave Sim]], as a combination of Weishaupt and George Washington. He appears primarily in the ''Cerebus'' and ''[[Church & State I]]'' volumes. His motives are [[republic]]an confederalizing of city-states in Estarcion (a pseudo-Europe) and the accumulation of capital unencumbered by government or church.\n\nWeishaupt's name is one of many references made to the [[Illuminati]] and other conspiracies in the video game ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' (2000). The protagonist uncovers a virus engineered by the VersaLife Corporation with its molecular structure in multiples of [[23 enigma|17 and 23]]. An ally of the protagonist notes \"1723. The birth of Adam Weishaupt\" even though this reference is actually incorrect as Weishaupt was born in 1748.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masonrytoday.com/index.php?new_month=11&new_day=18&new_year=2015|title=Today in Masonic History - Johann Adam Weishaupt Passes Away|website=www.masonrytoday.com}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Philosophical works===\n* (1775) ''De Lapsu Academiarum Commentatio Politica''.\n* (1786) ''\u00dcber die Schrecken des Todes&nbsp;\u2013 eine philosophische Rede''.\n** {{fr icon}} ''Discours Philosophique sur les Frayeurs de la Mort'' (1788).

In June 1982, cofounder [[Hermann Hauser]] was asked about the recently announced \u00a3175 [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]]'s potential to hurt sales of the BBC Micro. Hauser responded that in the third quarter of that year Acorn would release a new \u00a3120-150 computer which \"will probably be called the Electron\", with graphics superior to the Spectrum's and compatibility with BBC Micro software. Acorn's [[Chris Curry]] stated that \"the Electron is designed to compete with the Spectrum. The idea is to get the starting price very low, but not preclude expansion in the long term.\" The company reduced the number of chips in the Electron by 90% from the BBC Micro's about 100, with most functionality on a single [[Uncommitted Logic Array]] (ULA). Problems with the ULA delayed the Electron, however, and Acorn repeatedly missed deadlines to ship the computer.<ref name=\"smith20130823\">{{cite web | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/23/acorn_electron_history_at_30/ | title=Acorn\u2019s would-be ZX Spectrum killer, the Electron, is 30 | publisher=The Register | work=2013-08-23 | accessdate=12 January 2015 | author=Smith, Tony}}</ref>\n\nAcorn formally announced the Electron at the [[Acorn User|''Acorn User'' Exhibition]] in August 1983, one year after Hauser mentioned the computer, by which time its price had risen to \u00a3175 while the Spectrum cost \u00a3130. The company expected to ship the Electron before Christmas, and sell 100,000 by February 1984. Reviews were generally favorable, noting its excellent graphics compared to the [[Commodore 64]]. While its speed was acceptable compared to the Commodore and competing computers the Electron was, however, much slower than the BBC Micro; ''[[Popular Computing Weekly]]'' reported, for example, that BBC Micro games ran \"at less than half the speed, with very significant effects on their appeal\".<ref name=\"smith20130823\" />\n\nThe reduced processor speed was attributable to the use of a 4 bit wide memory system instead of the 8 bit wide memory system of the [[BBC Micro]] to reduce cost. The Electron used just 4 64kbit RAM devices instead of the 16 16kbit RAM devices deployed on the BBC Model B. In the [[BBC Micro]], the RAM ran at 2x the speed (4&nbsp;MHz) of the CPU (2&nbsp;MHz) allowing the video (screen refresh) and CPU memory access to be cleverly interleaved.  On the Electron two accesses had to be made to get an 8 bit word, meaning that the CPU was unable to access its RAM while screen refresh accesses were happening.  This reduced the effective CPU speed by as much as a factor of 6. At the same time the [[BBC Micro#B.2B64 and B.2B128|BBC Micro B+]] was being developed just metres away in the same Laboratory. This model used 8 64kbit RAMs enabling the screen memory to be overlaid with the BASIC and OS ROMs in the processor memory map.  This allowed the full 32k byte program RAM to be used in addition to using a 20kbyte memory mapped screen.\n\nThe ULA continued to cause problems, delaying large-scale manufacturing. By October 1983 Acorn had received orders for more than 150,000 units, and expected to produce 25,000 a month before Christmas; the existing backlog would take more than six months to fulfil. Demand for the Electron was high but only two of [[WH Smith]]'s London branches had inventory. As the company increased production during 1984, however, the British home-computer market greatly weakened; one Acorn executive later said, \"after Christmas [1983] they were just delivering and the company ended up with \u00a343&nbsp;million of unsaleable stock\". Acorn's Christmas 1984 sales were greatly below expectations and in January 1985 the company reduced the Electron's price to \u00a3129. In conjunction with an unsuccessful expansion into the United States, by February Acorn's [[market capitalization]] declined 85% from the previous year. [[Olivetti]] acquired the company later that year and [[Dixons Retail]] acquired the remaining Electron inventory for less than manufacturing cost, ending Acorn's home-computer business.<ref name=\"smith20130823\" />\n\nWith hindsight, the machine lacked the RAM (a typical program would need to fit in only around 20&nbsp;kB once display memory is subtracted) and processing power to take on the prevailing Spectrum and Commodore 64. Despite this, several features that would later be associated with [[BBC Master]] and [[Acorn Archimedes|Archimedes]] were first features of Electron expansion units, including ROM cartridge slots and the [[Advanced Disc Filing System]], a hierarchical improvement to the BBC's original [[Disc Filing System]].\n\nWhile it may not have been as popular as the Spectrum, Commodore 64 or [[Amstrad CPC]], it did sell in sufficient numbers to ensure that new software was being produced right up until the early 1990s. This meant the Electron had a lifespan not much shorter than those more popular micros and much longer than competitors such as the [[Oric-1]] and [[Dragon 32]].\n\n==Popular upgrades==\n\n===Acorn Plus 1===\n[[File:Acorn Electron and Plus 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An Acorn Electron with Plus 1 expansion unit attached]]\nThe Acorn Plus 1 added two ROM cartridge slots, an analogue interface (supporting two channels) and a Centronics parallel port. The analogue interface was normally used for joysticks, the parallel for a printer. The ROM slots could be booted from via the \"Shift+BREAK\" key-combination. (The slot at the front of the interface took priority if both were populated).\n\nAccess to ROM memory occurred at 2&nbsp;MHz regardless of graphics mode so theoretically programs released on ROM could run at least twice as fast as those released on tape or disc. Despite this all of the games released on ROM were packaged as \"serial ROMS\", from which the micro would load programs into main memory in exactly the same way as if it were loading from tape. This meant that programs did not need to be modified for their new memory location but gave no execution speed benefits.\n\nThe Cartridge-port ROM-slots provided additional control lines, (compared to the lines available via the Edge-connector on the rear of the Electron), such as ROMSTBY, SNDIN, ROMQA, and some additional Voltage sources (+16V) etc. The total number of lines exposed via the Cartridge port almost matched those from the 1&nbsp;MHz bus of the BBC.<ref>Electron Advanced User Guide -  Appendix E</ref>\n\nAdditional peripheral cartridge-holders by companies such as P.R.E.S. (via their [http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/hardware/cats/acp_pres.html ARA/ARA2/ASR] products) allowed [[Sideways address space|'Sideways ROM']] capability, that allowed the standard Acorn ROM space to be programmatically mapped out for alternative EPROMs, either physically via ZIF Sockets, or 'virtually' via ROM-images loaded into (battery-backed) RAM in the same ROM memory space. This enabled the Electron to achieve the same functionality as that provided by the Expansion-ROM slots under the keyboard and on the bottom-left of the BBC Micro B keyboard.\n\nThe addition of the Plus 1 added a number of new *FX and OSBYTE calls that allowed the OS to read the values from the analogue and parallel interfaces.\n\n====Compatibility====\nThe Plus 1 needed memory page &D for its workspace, and some games used this space. To disable the Plus 1, after pressing BREAK, the following commands could be issued:\n\n *FX163,128,1<br>\n ?&212=&D6<br>\n ?&213=&F1<br>\n ?&2AC=0\n\n===Acorn Plus 2===\nPer a News article on Page #9 of the October 1984 issue of Acorn User, the Acorn 'Plus 2' interface was due to provide [[Econet]] capability. This interface did not make it to market.\n\n===Acorn Plus 3===\n[[File:Acorn ALA13 Electron Plus 3 (front).jpg|thumb|Acorn Plus 3, showing the connector and disc drive]]\nThe Acorn Plus 3 was a hardware module that connected independently of the Plus 1 and provided a double-density 3\u00bd\" disc drive connected through a [[WD1770]] drive controller and an [[Advanced Disc Filing System|ADFS]] ROM. There were two versions of the Plus 3 produced: A Single-sided and a Double-sided drive version. Because the WD1770 is capable of single density mode and uses the same IBM360 derived floppy disc format as the Intel 8271 found in the BBC Micro, it was also possible to run a [[Disc Filing System|DFS]] filing system with an alternate ROM, such as the P.R.E.S AP4 interface.\n\nThe Plus 3 reset PAGE to &1D00, reducing the amount of free RAM available to user. The ADFS system could be temporarily disabled (and PAGE reset to &E00) via the <tt>*NOADFS</tt> command. Alternative WD1770-based DFS and ADFS interfaces such as the P.R.E.S AP4 and 'ADFS E00' products left PAGE at &E00, and did not require the presence of the ZYSYSHELP file (see below)\n\nDisks had to be manually mounted and dismounted using the <tt>*MOUNT / *DISMOUNT</tt> commands, or using the <tt>CTRL-A+BREAK</tt> key combination. Disks could also be booted from via the standard \"Shift+BREAK\" key-combination, if the !BOOT file was present on the disk. This behaviour was the same as on the BBC Micro.\n\nThe Plus 3 included an uprated square black power supply unit with mains cord, manufactured by STC, designed and manufactured in England to BS 415 and BS 5850, that was designed to power the Plus 3, in addition to the Electron and the Plus 1 interface as well. This replaced the original cream-coloured \"wall wart\" style power supply, designed to BS 415 and manufactured in Hong Kong.\n\n*'''Original'''; Part no: unknown; input 220/240 V AC/50&nbsp;Hz; output 19 V AC/0.737 A/14 W:  '''Usage''':   Electron, Electron+Plus1\n*'''Uprated''' Part no: 865-010;   input 240 V AC/50&nbsp;Hz 50 W; output 21 V AC/1.75 A/36.75 W: '''Usage''': Electron+Plus3, Electron+Plus3+Plus1\n\nThe original Electron Edge-connector was repeated on the back of the Plus3, in addition to a secondary smaller edge-connector, that enabled additional drives to be connected ([[Shugart bus|Shugart]]-compatible connection). These required their own power-supply. The secondary edge-connector could not power external drives.\n\nRepair note: If the internal power-supply connector, used to power the existing internal 3.5\" drive is damaged, and requires replacement, then the original AMP 800-930 4-pin connector, which was already in short supply during the original production run, may be replaced with a Molex 5264 50-37-5043 \"Mini-SPOX\" connector as an alternative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stardot.org.uk/forums/download/file.php?id=4417&sid=0a0f02b8369739630c42f2d91c6594be |title=Acorn Electron Disc Drive Connector - Internal Memo |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIf using the Plus3 in screen modes 0-3, the pseudo-variable <tt>TIME</tt> would be thrown off, as the interrupts were disabled during disk access in these modes.\n\nPer a News article on page 9 of the October 1984 issue of Acorn User, the Plus 3 was originally designed to have used the Intel 8272 disk controller, (and not 8271, which were in short supply at the time).\n\n====ADFS quirks====\nThe ADFS file format used the bytes <tt>[[Advanced Disc Filing System|Hugo]]</tt> to delimit the directory names on the disc, named after ADFS author Hugo Tyson. Another quirk was the presence of the file  <tt>ZYSYSHELP</tt> which was required by the system, and created during formatting. This was a kludge. Acorn's v1.0 ADFS implementation on the Electron was unreliable when writing to the first few tracks of a floppy disc, so this was a \"fix\" and simply involved writing a file full of garbage to the suspect part. The ADFS would then skip it. Disc corruption could also occur if attempting to use the <tt>*COMPACT</tt> command without disabling the blinking cursor with the following command:\n<pre>VDU23,1,0;0;0;0; </pre> This was due to the fact that the <tt>*COMPACT</tt> command used screen memory (by default) as working space during the operation, and the software-implemented blinking cursor corrupted that memory space.  An alternative would be to give arguments to make it use non-screen memory for workspace, for example <tt>*COMPACT 40 20</tt> in <tt>MODE 6</tt>.  Tyson recalls that this bug was found during late testing but not fixed in the initial ROM release in order to avoid late changes, as workarounds exist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portices.fr/formation/Res/Info/Dimet/Ordinateurs/AcornBBC/www.stairwaytohell.com/Ressources/r-EU-ACP-E00ADFS.html |title=Stairwaytohell.Com - Hardware |publisher=Portices.fr |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref><ref>On the BBC Micro, the blinking cursor, if enabled, was superimposed onto the display output by the 6845 CRTC and Acorn's video ULA, without changing any screen memory. The Acorn Electron did not have this extra hardware and had to alter screen memory in software to blink the cursor.</ref>\n\nDisc formatting was done via the <tt>*EFORM</tt> command, vs the more familiar <tt>*FORM40/*FORM80</tt> DFS commands. Note additionally that the <tt>*EFORM</tt> command differs from the equivalent <tt>*AFORM</tt> command for the 1770 ADFS on the BBC Microcomputer. This is possibly as a result of needing to create the ZYSYSHELP file on the Electron. The *EFORM command was only supplied on the Welcome disc that was shipped with the Plus3, and was not included in the ROM.\n\n===First Byte Joystick Interface===\nAs a games machine the Electron shared the same failing as the Sinclair Spectrum in not having a joystick port. This was quickly remedied by First Byte Computers who developed an interface and software which allowed a \"switched\" joystick to be used with the majority of software titles. This interface became very popular and was sold by W.H. Smiths, Boots, Comet and hundreds of independent computer dealers.\n\n===P.R.E.S. Advanced Plus 3===\n[[File:Advanced Plus 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The P.R.E.S. Advanced Plus 3 with a 3\u00bd\" drive]]\nThe Advanced Plus 3 was very similar to the Acorn Plus 3 but packaged as an ADFS ROM cartridge for the Plus 1 with a disc drive connector at the head. This made it possible to connect a 5\u00bc\" floppy disc drive as used by BBC Micro owners or a more common 3\u00bd\" drive.\n\n===P.R.E.S. Advanced Plus 5===\n[http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/hardware/cats/acp_pres.html AP5] Provided User Port (all lines), 1&nbsp;MHz bus and 'Tube' bus capability, enabling second processor usage.\nFor the PRES5, and other similar interfaces, the User Port is usually implemented via a 6522 VIA chip.\n\n===Slogger/Elektuur Turbo Board===\nThe Slogger and Elektuur Turbo Boards were born out of a hack initially devised at Acorn. By moving the lowest 8&nbsp;kB of RAM outside of reach of the ULA, the CPU could always access it at 2&nbsp;MHz. The tradeoff was that the screen could not be located in that 8&nbsp;kB. In practice the operating system ROMs always put the screen into the top 24&nbsp;kB and as a result this probably only broke compatibility with around 2% of software.\n\nThe Slogger Turbo Board was a professionally fitted upgrade whereas the Elektuur modification was described in an article in Dutch Electronics magazine Elektuur and intended for users to perform at home.<ref name=\"8bs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.8bs.com/see/kupers_electron_6.jpg |title= kupers_electron_6 |publisher=8bs.com|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nSpeeding up the low portion of memory is particularly useful on 6502 derived machines because that processor has a faster addressing mode for the first 256 bytes and so it is common for software to put any variables involved in time critical sections of program into that region.\n\nIf Acorn had thought to include this small modification in the original Electron design it is likely the machine would have had a much greater impact as it would have nearly doubled the amount of motion possible in games and saved modes 0\u20133 (including the only 16 colour mode) from being nearly useless due to contended memory timings.\n\n===Slogger Master RAM Board===\nA development of the Turbo Board, the Master RAM Board duplicated the Turbo Board functionality and added a further option of running the micro with 32&nbsp;kB of shadow RAM in addition to the ordinary 32&nbsp;kB \u2014  giving 64&nbsp;kB total. Some clever program counter catches meant that the ordinary system ROMs and any software using the OS calls could function without significant modification, making substantially more memory available for BASIC, View, Viewsheet and almost every other business application. By providing extra storage this modification also allowed some games and applications intended for the BBC Micro to function on the Electron despite the lack of a native Mode 7.<ref name=\"Hobbyist page describing BBC Micro software compatibility using 64 bK expansion cards\">{{cite web\n  | title = Andy's guide to using BBC software on a 64K modified Acorn Electron.\n  | url = http://www.andysarcade.net/personal/elk/64kmod/64kelectron.htm\n  | accessdate = 4 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nApplications could not directly address video memory in this mode without modification, so it was incompatible with most games, although there is no inherent reason why a game could not be written to function in shadow mode.\n\nDuring its decline, Master RAM Boards were added to every Electron in an attempt to increase sales.\n\n===Jafa Systems Mode 7 Display Unit===\nOf the capabilities present in the BBC Micro but absent from the Electron, the [[teletext]]-style ''mode 7'' was particularly conspicuous because of the very low memory usage in that mode (just less than 1&nbsp;kB) and the high number of BBC programs that used it. Jafa Systems provided a number of solutions to redress this deficiency.<ref>http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/hardware/cats/jafa.html</ref> (Note - the Jafa interface did not provide Teletext interface itself, but it did work in conjunction with specific CEEFAX/Teletext/Prestel adaptors from other manufacturers such as Morley<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/mags/aab/revs/jafa/r-m7du.html |title=A&B Computing review |publisher=Acornelectron.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/hardware/cats/morley.html |title=Acorn Electron World - Hardware, Information & Link Archives |publisher=Acornelectron.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref>)\n\nThe most basic solution was a pure software system supplied on a ROM cartridge that drew a low resolution approximation of the mode 7 display in a graphics mode. Although cheap and effective in enabling use of some software that only used official ROM entry points for text output, this solution proved very slow because the Electron had to be placed into an 80-byte-pitch display to be able to get anywhere near to reproducing mode 7 and the CPU spent a lot of time drawing approximations of mode 7 characters and graphics that in a hardware solution would be achieved without any CPU processing. It also used up 20&nbsp;kB of RAM for the graphics display rather than the 1&nbsp;kB of a hardware mode 7.\n\nTwo solutions with additional hardware were provided. The first used the same graphics processor as the BBC Micro in mode 7 \u2014 the [[SAA5050]] \u2014 but used software to ensure that it was fed with the correct graphics data. A software ROM would put the machine into an ordinary 40-byte-pitch display. While the ULA would read the display from memory in the usual fashion, the SAA5050 would listen to the data it was reading and produce a mode 7 interpretation of the same information. When necessary the hardware would switch between the graphics output being produced by the micro and that being produced by the add-on.\n\nThe disadvantage to this system is that while the SAA5050 would expect to be repeatedly fed the same 40 bytes of data for every display scanline of each character row, the ULA would read a different set of 40 bytes for every display scanline in order to produce a full graphics display. A software ROM worked around this by duplicating the data intended for a mode 7 display in memory. Although this produced a mode 7 that barely impacted upon CPU performance and gave the same visual quality as the BBC Micro, it remained compatible only with software that used the ROM routines for outputting text and graphics and still used 10&nbsp;kB of memory for the display.\n\nA second version of the hardware add-on corrected these problems. By adding a [[CRTC6845]] to the package, a full hardware solution was created that did not reduce CPU performance and only used 1&nbsp;kB of memory for the display. A software ROM was still supplied, but this did no more than expand the hardware ROM so that it knew mode 7 now existed and was able to switch into it.\n\n===Electron Second Processor===\nDuring the latter years, PMS produced a 2nd Processor specifically for the Electron. This provided an alternative to buying the combination of the P.R.E.S. Advanced Plus 5 and Acorn 6502 2nd Processor.<ref>http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/mags/aab/revs/pms/r-e2p.html</ref>\n\n==Merlin M2105==\nAn unusual variant of the Electron was sold by [[British Telecom]] Business Systems as the BT Merlin M2105 Communications Terminal. This consisted of a de-badged Electron plus a large expansion unit containing 32&nbsp;kB of RAM, 48&nbsp;kB of ROM, a [[Centronics printer port]] and a [[modem]]. The ROM firmware provided [[dial-up]] communications facilities. These were used by the [[Interflora]] florists network in the UK for over a decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/hardware/cats/bt.html |title=Merlin M2105 information |publisher=Acornelectron.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chrisacorns.computinghistory.org.uk/Computers/BT_MerlinM2105.html |title=Chris's Acorns: BT Merlin M2105 |publisher=chrisacorns.computinghistory.org.uk |date=16 January 2008 |accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Technical information==\nThe hardware of the BBC Micro was emulated by a single customized ULA chip designed by Acorn in conjunction with [[Ferranti]]. It had feature limitations such as the inability to output more than one channel of sound or provide [[teletext]] mode.<ref name=\"smith20130823\" /> By contrast, the BBC Micro was capable of three-way polyphony (plus one noise channel).\n\nThe edge-connector on the rear of the Electron exposed almost all the Bus lines, but not all. (The BBC Micro, courtesy of all its ports, exposed all lines.)\n\nFor Issue 1-4 motherboards, the ULA had an issue similar to those experienced by other socketed CPU's. Over time, the thermal heating and cooling could cause the ULA to rise slightly out of its socket just enough to cause the machine to start exhibiting 'hanging' or other startup-failure issues, such as a continuous 'startup beep'. This was despite a metal cover, and locking-bar mechanism designed to prevent this from occurring. Pushing down on the metal cover to reseat the ULA was normally sufficient to rectify these issues.<ref name=\"computerhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/physical-object/acorn/102688877.lg.jpg|title=Image: 102688877.lg.jpg, (500 \u00d7 359 px)|publisher=archive.computerhistory.org|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"blogspot\">{{cite web|url=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7zQebyfYlPE/T0dYrkTIIpI/AAAAAAAAAVY/injg8GeCoco/s1600/DSCF3052.JPG|title=Image: DSCF3052.JPG, (1600 \u00d7 1200 px)|publisher=3.bp.blogspot.com|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"blogspot2\">{{cite web|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kyRwGNknHnU/T0dZHG8ThnI/AAAAAAAAAVo/JMFmxQLJstY/s1600/DSCF3055.JPG|title=Image: DSCF3055.JPG, (1600 \u00d7 1200 px)|publisher=1.bp.blogspot.com|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"bygonebytes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bygonebytes.co.uk/images/electron_issue4.jpg|title=Image: electron_issue4.jpg, (350 \u00d7 221 px)|publisher=bygonebytes.co.uk|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref> Issue 5 and 6 boards utilized a different epoxy resin covering directly over the ULA, which resolved this issue.<ref name=\"bygonebytes2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bygonebytes.co.uk/images/electron_issue6.jpg|title=Image: electron_issue6.jpg, (350 \u00d7 220 px)|publisher=bygonebytes.co.uk|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe keyboard included a form of single-key keyword input, similar to that used on the [[Sinclair Spectrum]], via the 'func' key. However, unlike the Spectrum, the single-keypress keyword-entry was optional, and keywords could be entered manually if preferred.\n\nThe ULA controlled memory access and was able to provide 32K \u00d7 8 bits of addressable RAM using 4 \u00d7 64K \u00d7 1-bit [[random-access memory|RAM]] chips (4164). Due to needing two accesses to each chip instead of one, and the complications of the video hardware also needing access, reading or writing RAM was much slower than on the BBC Micro. This meant that although ROM applications ran at the same speed, there was a substantial speed decrease on applications running from RAM.\n\n===Hardware===\n[[File:Acorn ALF03 Data Recorder (top).jpg|thumb|Acorn ALF03 Data Recorder]]\n* [[central processing unit|CPU]]: [[MOS Technology]] [[MOS Technology 6502|6502A]]<ref name=\"pastraiser\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pastraiser.com/computers/acornelectron/acornelectron.html|title=Acorn Electron Hardware|publisher=pastraiser.com|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref>\n* Clock rate: variable.

Of the 32&nbsp;kB RAM, 3\u00bd kB was allocated to the OS at startup and at least 10&nbsp;kB was taken up by the display buffer in contiguous display modes.\n\nDue to the timing of interrupts it was possible to disable either the top 100 or bottom 156 lines of the display with palette changes. Many games took advantage of this, gaining storage by leaving non-graphical data in the disabled area.\n\nOther games would load non-graphical data into the display, leaving it visible as regions of apparently randomly coloured pixels.\n\nAlthough [[page flipping]] was a hardware possibility, the limited memory forced most applications to do all their drawing directly to the visible screen, often resulting in graphical [[Flicker (screen)|flicker]] or visible redraw. A notable exception is [[Players (publisher)|Players]]' ''[[Joe Blade]]'' series.\n\n===Tricks===\n\n====FireTrack: smooth vertical scrolling====\nAlthough programs can alter the position of the screen in memory, the non-linear format of the display means that vertical scrolling can only be done in blocks of 8 pixels without further work.\n\n''[[Firetrack|FireTrack]]'' exploits a division in the way the Electron handles its display \u2014 of the seven available graphics modes, two are configured so that the final two of every ten scanlines are blank and are not based on the contents of RAM. If 16 scanlines of continuous graphical data are written to a character-block-aligned portion of the screen then they will appear as a continuous block in most modes but in the two non-continuous modes they will be displayed as two blocks of eight scanlines, separated in the middle by two blank scanlines.\n\nIn order to keep track of its position within the display, the Electron maintains an internal display address counter. The same counter is used in both the continuous and non-continuous graphics modes and switching modes mid-frame does not cause any adjustment to the counter.\n\n''FireTrack'' switches from a non-continuous to a continuous graphics mode part way down the display. By using the palette to mask the top area of the display and taking care about when it changes mode it can shift the continuous graphics at the bottom of the display down in two pixel increments because the internal display counter is not incremented on blank scanlines during non-continuous graphics modes.\n\n====Exile: sampled speech====\n''[[Exile (1988 video game)|Exile]]'' turns the Electron's one channel output into a digital speaker for [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] output.\n\nThe speaker can be programmatically switched on or off at any time but is permanently attached to a hardware counter so is normally only able to output a square wave. But if set to a frequency outside the human audible range then the ear can't perceive the square wave, only the difference between the speaker being switched on and off. This gives the effect of a simple toggle speaker similar to that seen in the 48&nbsp;kB [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]]. ''Exile'' uses this to output 1-bit audio samples.\n\n====Frak! and Zalaga: Polyphonic music====\nAardvark Software's \"[[Frak!]]\" and \"Zalaga\" As part of the copy protection, illegal copies of the games would cause a pseudo-polyphonic rendition of Trumpet Hornpipe, the [[Captain Pugwash]] theme tune, to play endlessly rather than loading the game properly (Pugwash being a pirate). On the Electron version of Frak!, the tune was the main theme from \"Benny Hill\" ([[Boots Randolph]]'s \"[[Yakety Sax]]\"). The polyphony was achieved via fast note-switching to achieve the necessary chords.\n\n==Popular games==\n{{see also|List of Acorn Electron games}}\nAlthough not as well supported by the biggest software publishers as rivals like the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], a good range of games were available for the Electron. The traditional [[BBC Micro]] publishers such as [[Acornsoft]], [[Superior Software]] and [[Micro Power]] offered the widest support. Notable popular games particularly associated with the Electron include:[[File:CrystalCastles Electron.gif|thumb|''[[Crystal Castles (video game)|Crystal Castles]]'' is an example of a popular arcade game officially ported to the Electron (US Gold).]]\n* ''[[Starship Command]]'' ([[Acornsoft]], 1983)\n* ''[[Chuckie Egg]]'' (A'n'F, 1984)\n* ''[[Elite (video game)|Elite]]'' ([[Acornsoft]], 1984)\n* the ''[[Repton (video game)|Repton]]'' series ([[Superior Software]], 1985\u20131989)\n* ''[[Thrust (video game)|Thrust]]'' ([[Superior Software]], 1986)\n* ''[[Exile (1988 video game)|Exile]]'' ([[Superior Software]], 1988)\n\nThere were also many popular games officially converted to the Electron from arcade machines (including ''[[Crystal Castles (video game)|Crystal Castles]]'', ''[[Tempest (arcade game)|Tempest]]'', ''[[Commando (arcade game)|Commando]]'', ''[[Paperboy (video game)|Paperboy]]'' and ''[[Yie Ar Kung-Fu]]'') or other home computer systems (including ''[[Impossible Mission]]'', ''[[Jet Set Willy]]'', ''[[The Way of the Exploding Fist]]'', ''[[Tetris]]'', ''[[The Last Ninja]]'', ''[[Barbarian (computer game)|Barbarian]]'' and ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'').\n\nDespite Acorn themselves effectively shelving the Electron in 1985, games continued to be developed and released by professional software houses until 1991. There were around 1,400 games released for the Acorn Electron, several thousand extra public domain titles were released on disc through Public Domain libraries. Notable enterprises which produced discs of such software are [[BBC PD]], [[EUG (Electron User Group)|Electron User Group]] and [[HeadFirst PD]].\n\n==Emulation==\nThree emulators of the machine exist, [[ElectrEm]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electrem.emuunlim.com |title=ElectrEm |publisher=Electrem.emuunlim.com |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]/[[Linux]]/[[macOS]], Elkulator<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elkulator.acornelectron.co.uk |title=Elkulator - The Acorn Electron emulator |publisher=Elkulator.acornelectron.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]/[[DOS]], ElkJS<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elkjs.azurewebsites.net |title=ElkJS }} - JavaScript browser based Acorn Electron emulator</ref> is a browser-based (JavaScript/HTML5) Emulator and the Multi-system emulator [[MESS]].

The CD-ROM edition included numerous annotations by Vinge on his thoughts and intentions about different parts of the book, and was later released as a standalone [[e-book]] (no longer available).<ref>[http://books.slashdot.org/books/03/09/18/0411259.shtml Review of the annotated ebook edition of ''A Fire Upon the Deep''] at [[Slashdot]]</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe novel is set in various locations in the [[Milky Way]]. The galaxy is divided into four concentric volumes called the \"Zones of Thought\"; it is not clear to the novel's characters whether this is a natural phenomenon or an artificially-produced one, but it seems to roughly correspond with galactic-scale stellar density and a Beyond region is mentioned in the [[Sculptor Galaxy]] as well.<ref name=\"sculptor\"/> The Zones reflect fundamental differences in basic physical laws, and one of the main consequences is their effect on intelligence, both biological and artificial. Artificial intelligence and automation is most directly affected, in that advanced hardware and software from the Beyond or the Transcend will work less and less well as a ship \"descends\" towards the Unthinking Depths. But even biological intelligence is affected to a lesser degree. The four zones are spoken of in terms of \"low\" to \"high\" as follows:\n\n* The '''Unthinking Depths''' are the innermost zone, surrounding the [[Galactic Core|galactic core]]. In it, only minimal forms of intelligence, biological or otherwise, are possible. This means that any ship straying into the Depths will be stranded, effectively permanently. Even if the crew did not die immediately\u2014and some forms of life native to \"higher\" Zones would likely do so\u2014they would be rendered incapable of even human intelligence, leaving them unable to operate their ship in any meaningful way.\n* Surrounding the Depths is the '''Slow Zone'''. The [[Earth]] (called \"Old Earth\") is located in this Zone, and humanity is said to have originated there, although Earth plays no significant role in the story. Biological intelligence is possible in \"the Slowness\", but not true, sentient, [[artificial intelligence]]. [[Faster than light travel|Faster-than-light travel]] may not be initiated in the Slow Zone, i.e., one may \"jump\" into the Slow Zone, but not back out. All ships which find themselves in the Slow Zone are restricted to sub-light speeds. [[Faster-than-light communication]] is impossible into or out of the Slow Zone. As the boundaries of the Zones are unknown and subject to change, accidental entry to the Slow Zone is a major interstellar navigational hazard at the \"Bottom\" of the Beyond.  Starships which operate near the Beyond/Slow Zone border often have an auxiliary [[Bussard ramjet]] drive, so that, if they accidentally stray into the Slow Zone (thus disabling any FTL drive), they will at least have a backup (sub-light) drive to push them back \"up\" to the Beyond. Such ships also tend to include \"[[suspended animation|coldsleep]]\" equipment, as it is likely that any such return will still take many subjective lifetimes for most species.\n* The next outermost layer is the '''Beyond''', within which artificial intelligence, faster-than-light travel and faster-than-light communication, and [[antigravity]] are possible. A few human civilizations exist in the Beyond, all descended from a single ethnic [[Norway|Norwegian]] group which managed to travel from the Slow Zone to the Beyond (presumably at sub-light speeds) and thence spread using FTL travel. The original settlement of this group is known as Nyjora; other human settlements in the Beyond include Straumli Realm and Sjandra Kei. In the Beyond, FTL travel is accomplished by making many small \"jumps\" across intervening space, and the efficiency of the drive increases the farther a ship travels from the galactic core. This reflects increases in both drive efficiency and the ship's automation's increased capacity as one moves outward, enabling the computation of longer and longer jumps. The Beyond is not a homogeneous zone\u2014many references are made to, e.g., the \"High Beyond\" or the \"Bottom of the Beyond\", depending on distance to the galactic core. These terms seem to refer to differences in the Zone itself, not just relative distance from the Core, but there are no obvious Zone boundaries within the Beyond the way there are between the Slow Zone and the Beyond, or between the Beyond and the Transcend. Whereas a ship that crosses from the Beyond to the Slow Zone or vice versa will experience a dramatic change in its capabilities, a ship in the Beyond which moves farther from the Core will experience a gradual increase in efficiency (assuming it has the technology to make use of it) until another major shift at the boundary to the Transcend. The Beyond is populated by a very large number of interstellar and intergalactic<ref name=\"sculptor\">{{cite book|last1=Vinge|first1=Vernor|title=A Fire Upon the Deep|quote=Relay was now the main intermediate to the Magellanics, and one of the few sites with any sort of link to the Beyond in [[Sculptor Galaxy|Sculptor]].}}</ref> civilizations which are linked by a faster-than-light communication network, \"the Net\", sometimes cynically called the \"Net of a Million Lies\". The Net does connect with the Transcend, on the off-chance that one of the \"Powers\" that live there deigns to communicate, but has no connections with the Slow Zone, as FTL communication is impossible into or out of that Zone. In the novel, the Net is depicted as working much like the [[Usenet]] network in the early 1990s, with transcripts of messages containing header and footer information as one would find in such forums. \n* The outermost layer, containing the [[galactic halo]], is the '''Transcend''', within which incomprehensible, [[Superintelligence|superintelligent]] beings dwell. When a \"Beyonder\" civilization reaches the point of [[technological singularity]], it is said to \"Transcend\", becoming a \"Power\". Such Powers always seem to relocate to the Transcend, seemingly necessarily, where they become engaged in affairs which remain entirely mysterious to those that remain in the Beyond.\n\n==Plot==\nAn expedition from Straumli Realm, an ambitious young human civilization in the high Beyond, investigates a five-billion-year-old data archive in the low Transcend that offers the possibility of unimaginable riches. The expedition's facility, High Lab, is gradually compromised by a dormant [[superintelligence]] within the archive later known as the Blight. However, shortly before the Blight's final \"flowering\", two self-aware entities  created similarly to the Blight plot to aid the humans before the Blight can escape.\n\nRecognizing the danger of what they have awakened, the researchers at High Lab attempt to flee in two ships, one carrying all the adults and the second carrying all the children in \"[[suspended animation|coldsleep boxes]]\". Suspicious, the Blight discovers that the first ship contains a data storage device in its cargo manifest; assuming it contains information that could harm it, the Blight destroys the ship. The second ship escapes. The Blight assumes that it is no threat, but later realizes that it is actually carrying away a \"countermeasure\" against it.\n\nThe ship lands on a distant planet with a [[Middle Ages|medieval]]-level civilization of dog-like creatures, dubbed \"Tines\", who live in packs as [[Group mind (science fiction)|group minds]]. Upon landing, however, the two surviving adults are ambushed and killed by Tine fanatics known as Flenserists, in whose realm they have landed. The Flenserists capture a young boy named Jefri Olsndot and his wounded sister, Johanna. While Jefri is taken deeper into Flenserist territory, Johanna is rescued by Tine pilgrims who witnessed the ambush and deliver her to a neighboring kingdom ruled by a Tine named Woodcarver. The Flenserists tell Jefri that Johanna had been killed by Woodcarver and exploit him in order to develop advanced technology (such as cannon and radio communication), while Johanna and the knowledge stored in her \"dataset\" device help Woodcarver rapidly develop in turn.\n\nA distress signal from the sleeper ship eventually reaches \"Relay\", a major node in the galactic communications network. A benign transcendent entity named \"Old One\" contacts Relay, seeking information about the Blight and the humans who released it, and reconstitutes a human man named Pham Nuwen from an old wreck to act as its agent, using his doubt of his own memory's veracity to bend him to the Old One's will.  Ravna Bergsndot, the only human Relay employee, traces the sleeper ship's signal to the Tines world and persuades her employer to investigate what the human ship took from High Lab, contracting the merchant vessel ''Out of Band II'', owned by two sentient plant Skroderiders, Blueshell and Greenstalk, to transport them.\n\nBefore the mission is launched, the Blight attacks Relay and concurrently kills Old One. As Old One dies, it downloads what information it can into Pham to defeat the Blight, and Pham, Ravna and the Skroderiders barely escape Relay's destruction in the ''Out of Band II''.\n\nThe Blight expands, taking over races and \"rewriting\" their people to become its agents, murdering several other Powers, and seizing other archives in the Beyond, looking for what was taken. It finally realizes where the danger truly lies and sends a hastily assembled fleet in pursuit of the ''Out of Band II''.\n\nThe humans arrive at the Tines homeworld and ally with Woodcarver to defeat the Flenserists. Pham initiates Countermeasure, which extends the Slow Zone by thousands of light years, enveloping the Blight at the cost of wrecking thousands of uninvolved civilizations and causing trillions of deaths.  The humans are stranded on the Tines world, now in the depths of the \"Slow Zone\". Activating the countermeasure costs Pham his life, but just before Pham dies, he realizes that, although his body is a reconstruction, his memories are real. Vinge expands on Pham's backstory in ''[[A Deepness in the Sky]]''.\n\n==Intelligent species==\n\n===Aprahanti===\nA race of humanoids with colorful butterfly-like wings who attempt to use the chaos wrought by the Blight to reestablish their waning hegemony.

One of the major human habitations is Sjandra Kei, three systems<ref>p. 436</ref> comprising roughly 28 billion<ref>p. 322</ref> individuals. Their main language is [[Norwegian language|Samnorsk]], the Norwegian term for a hypothetical unification of the [[Bokm\u00e5l]] and [[Nynorsk]] forms of the language.

An early example appears in ancient Egyptian texts.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Later medieval Islamic scientists also made such studies. The founders of modern aeronautics, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in the Renaissance and Cayley in 1799, both began their investigations with studies of bird flight.\n\nMan-carrying kites are believed to have been used extensively in ancient China. In 1282 the European explorer [[Marco Polo]] described the Chinese techniques then current.<ref name=\"pelham\">Pelham, D.; ''The Penguin book of kites'', Penguin (1976)</ref> The Chinese also constructed small hot air balloons, or lanterns, and rotary-wing toys.\n\nAn early European to provide any scientific discussion of flight was [[Roger Bacon]], who described principles of operation for the lighter-than-air [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] and the flapping-wing [[ornithopter]], which he envisaged would be constructed in the future. The lifting medium for his balloon would be an \"aether\" whose composition he did not know.{{sfn|Wragg|1974|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nIn the late fifteenth century, Leonardo da Vinci followed up his study of birds with designs for some of the earliest flying machines, including the flapping-wing [[ornithopter]] and the rotating-wing [[helicopter]]. Although his designs were rational, they were not based on particularly good science.{{sfn|Wragg|1974|p=11}} Many of his designs, such as a four-person screw-type helicopter, have severe flaws. He did at least understand that \"An object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object.\"{{sfn|Fairlie|Cayley|1965|p=163}} ([[Isaac Newton|Newton]] would not publish the [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s third law|Third law of motion]] until 1687.) His analysis led to the realisation that manpower alone was not sufficient for sustained flight, and his later designs included a mechanical power source such as a spring. Da Vinci's work was lost after his death and did not reappear until it had been overtaken by the work of [[George Cayley]].\n\n===Balloon flight===\n{{Main article|History of ballooning}}\n[[File:Flying boat.png|thumb|right|upright|Francesco Lana de Terzi's flying boat concept c.1670]]\nThe modern era of lighter-than-air flight began early in the 17th century with [[Galileo]]'s experiments in which he showed that air has weight. Around 1650 [[Cyrano de Bergerac]] wrote some fantasy novels in which he described the principle of ascent using a substance (dew) he supposed to be lighter than air, and descending by releasing a controlled amount of the substance.{{sfn|Ege|1973|p=6}} [[Francesco Lana de Terzi]] measured the pressure of air at sea level and in 1670 proposed the first scientifically credible lifting medium in the form of hollow metal spheres from which all the air had been pumped out. These would be lighter than the displaced air and able to lift an [[airship]]. His proposed methods of controlling height are still in use today; by carrying ballast which may be dropped overboard to gain height, and by venting the lifting containers to lose height.{{sfn|Ege|1973|p=7}} In practice de Terzi's spheres would have collapsed under air pressure, and further developments had to wait for more practicable lifting gases.\n[[File:Montgolfier brothers flight.jpg|thumb|Montgolfier brothers flight, 1784]]\nFrom the mid-18th century the [[Montgolfier brothers]] in France began experimenting with balloons. Their balloons were made of paper, and early experiments using steam as the lifting gas were short-lived due to its effect on the paper as it condensed. Mistaking smoke for a kind of steam, they began filling their balloons with hot smoky air which they called \"electric smoke\" and, despite not fully understanding the principles at work, made some successful launches and in 1783 were invited to give a demonstration to the French ''Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences''.\n\nMeanwhile, the discovery of [[hydrogen]] led [[Joseph Black]] in c. 1780 to propose its use as a lifting gas, though practical demonstration awaited a gas tight balloon material. On hearing of the Montgolfier Brothers' invitation, the French Academy member [[Jacques Charles]] offered a similar demonstration of a hydrogen balloon. Charles and two craftsmen, the Robert brothers, developed a gas tight material of rubberised silk for the envelope. The hydrogen gas was to be generated by chemical reaction during the filling process.\n\nThe Montgolfier designs had several shortcomings, not least the need for dry weather and a tendency for sparks from the fire to set light to the paper balloon. The manned design had a gallery around the base of the balloon rather than the hanging basket of the first, unmanned design, which brought the paper closer to the fire. On their free flight, De Rozier and d'Arlandes took buckets of water and sponges to douse these fires as they arose. On the other hand, the manned design of Charles was essentially modern.{{sfn|Ege|1973|pp=97\u2013100}} As a result of these exploits, the hot-air balloon became known as the ''Montgolfi\u00e8re'' type and the hydrogen balloon the ''Charli\u00e8re''.\n\nCharles and the Robert brothers' next balloon, ''[[Robert brothers#Further ballooning activities \u2013 La Caroline|La Caroline]]'', was a Charli\u00e8re that followed [[Jean Baptiste Meusnier]]'s proposals for an elongated dirigible balloon, and was notable for having an outer envelope with the gas contained in a second, inner ballonet. On 19 September 1784, it completed the first flight of over 100&nbsp;km, between Paris and [[Beuvry]], despite the man-powered propulsive devices proving useless.\n\nIn an attempt the next year to provide both endurance and controllability, de Rozier developed a balloon having both hot air and hydrogen gas bags, a design which was soon named after him as the ''Rozi\u00e8re.'' The principle was to use the hydrogen section for constant lift and to navigate vertically by heating and allowing to cool the hot air section, in order to catch the most favourable wind at whatever altitude it was blowing. The balloon envelope was made of [[goldbeaters skin|goldbeater's skin]]. The first flight ended in disaster and the approach has seldom been used since.{{sfn|Ege|1965|p=105}}\n\n===Cayley and the foundation of modern aeronautics===\n[[Sir George Cayley]] (1773-1857) is widely acknowledged as the founder of modern aeronautics. He was first called the \"father of the aeroplane\" in 1846{{sfn|Fairlie|Cayley|1965}} and Henson called him the \"father of aerial navigation.\"{{sfn|Wragg|1974}} He was the first true scientific aerial investigator to publish his work, which included for the first time the underlying principles and forces of flight.<ref>{{cite web| title = Sir George Carley| url = http://www.flyingmachines.org/cayl.html| publisher = Flyingmachines.org| accessdate = 2009-07-26| quote = Sir George Cayley is one of the most important people in the history of aeronautics.

He also identified and described the importance of [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]], diagonal bracing and drag reduction, and contributed to the understanding and design of [[ornithopter]]s and [[parachute]]s.{{sfn|Wragg|1974}}\n\nAnother significant invention was the tension-spoked wheel, which he devised in order to create a light, strong wheel for aircraft undercarriage.\n\n===The 19th century===\nDuring the 19th century Cayley's ideas were refined, proved and expanded on. Important investigators included [[Otto Lilienthal]] and [[Horatio Phillips]].\n\n===The 20th century===\n\nPedro Paulet, scientist born in the city of Arequipa, Peru in the year of 1874, was one of the first to experiment with propulsion rockets being considered the \u00abFather of Modern Rocket\u00bb and by others as the \u00abFather of Aeronautics Modern \u00bb. He developed plans for a \"torpedo plane\", which is why he is considered ahead of his time. When the internal explosion engines were invented, small enough to be able to propel a flying device with them, a race started between two flight possibilities: the lighter than the air (dirigibles) and the heavier than the air (aeroplanes) .\n\n==Branches==\n[[File:Typhoon f2 zj910 arp.jpg|thumb|The [[Eurofighter Typhoon]].]]\n[[File:An-225 Mriya.jpg|thumb|[[Antonov An-225 Mriya|Antonov An-225 ''Mriya'']], the largest aeroplane ever built.]]\nAeronautics may be divided into three main branches comprising [[Aviation]], [[Aeronautical science]] and [[Aeronautical engineering]].\n\n===Aviation===\n{{Main article|Aviation}}\n\nAviation is the art or practice of aeronautics.

[[Louis Le Prince]] and [[Claude Mechant]] had been shooting moving picture sequences on paper film as soon as 1888, but had never performed a public demonstration.

Acts continues the story of [[Christianity in the 1st century]], beginning with Jesus's [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]] to [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]]. The early chapters, set in [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], describe the [[Pentecost|Day of Pentecost]] (the coming of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]) and the growth of the church in Jerusalem. Initially, the Jews are receptive to the Christian message, but soon they turn against the followers of Jesus. Rejected by the Jews, under the guidance of the [[Apostle Peter]] the message is taken to the [[Gentiles]]. The later chapters tell of [[Conversion of Paul the Apostle|Paul's conversion]], his mission in Asia Minor and the Aegean, and finally his imprisonment in Rome, where, as the book ends, he awaits trial.\n\nLuke\u2013Acts is an attempt to answer a theological problem, namely how the Messiah of the Jews came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church; the answer it provides, and its central theme, is that the message of Christ was sent to the Gentiles because the [[Rejection of Jesus|Jews rejected it]].{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=263}} Luke\u2013Acts can be also seen as a defense of (or \"apology\" for) the Jesus movement addressed to the Jews: the bulk of the speeches and sermons in Acts are addressed to Jewish audiences, with the Romans serving as external arbiters on disputes concerning Jewish customs and law.{{sfn|Pickett|2011|pp=6\u20137}} On the one hand, Luke portrays the [[Jewish Christian|Christians as a sect of the Jews]], and therefore entitled to legal protection as a recognised religion; on the other, Luke seems unclear as to the future God intends for Jews and Christians, celebrating the Jewishness of Jesus and his immediate followers while also stressing how the Jews had rejected God's promised Messiah.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=563}}\n\n==Composition and setting==\n{{Main|Authorship of Luke\u2013Acts}}\n[[File:ApostleFedorZubov.jpg|thumb|left|240px|''Ministry of the Apostles'': [[Russian icons|Russian icon]] by [[Fyodor Zubov]], 1660]]\n\n===Title, unity of Luke\u2013Acts, authorship and date===\nThe title \"Acts of the Apostles\" ([[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03a0\u03c1\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd}} ''Praxeis Apostolon'') was first used by [[Irenaeus]] in the late 2nd century.

[[Saul of Tarsus]], one of the Jews who persecuted the Christians, is converted by a vision to become a follower of Christ (an event which Luke regards as so important that he relates it three times). Peter, directed by a series of visions, preaches to [[Cornelius the Centurion]], a Gentile God-fearer, who becomes a follower of Christ. The Holy Spirit descends on Peter and Cornelius, thus confirming that the message of eternal life in Christ is for all mankind.

The Spirit is \"poured out\" at [[Pentecost]], on the first Samaritan and Gentile believers, and on disciples who had been baptised only by [[John the Baptist]], each time as a sign of God's approval. The Holy Spirit represents God's power (At his ascension, Jesus tells his followers, \"You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you\"): through it the disciples are given speech to convert thousands in Jerusalem, forming the first church (the term is used for the first time in Acts 5).{{sfn|Burkett|2002|pp=268\u201370}}\n\nOne issue debated by scholars is Luke\u2019s political vision regarding the relationship between the early church and the Roman Empire. On the one hand, Luke generally does not portray this interaction as one of direct conflict. Rather, there are ways in which each may have considered having a relationship with the other rather advantageous to its own cause. For example, early Christians may have appreciated hearing about the protection Paul received from Roman officials against Gentile rioters in Philippi (Acts 16:16-40) and Ephesus (Acts 19:23-41), and against Jewish rioters on two occasions (Acts 17:1-17; Acts 18:12-17). Meanwhile, Roman readers may have approved of Paul\u2019s censure of the illegal practice of magic (Acts 19:17-19) as well as the amicability of his rapport with Roman officials such as Sergius Paulus (Acts 13:6-12) and Festus (Acts 26:30-32). Furthermore, Acts does not include any account of a struggle between Christians and the Roman government as a result of the latter\u2019s imperial cult. Thus Paul is depicted as a moderating presence between the church and the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Phillips|2009|pp=119}}\n\nOn the other hand, events such as the imprisonment of Paul at the hands of the empire (Acts 22-28) as well as several encounters that reflect negatively on Roman officials (for instance, Felix\u2019s desire for a bribe from Paul in Acts 24:26) function as concrete points of conflict between Rome and the early church.{{sfn|Phillips|2009|pp=119-21}} Perhaps the most significant point of tension between Roman imperial ideology and Luke\u2019s political vision is reflected in Peter\u2019s speech to the Roman centurion, Cornelius (Acts 10:36). Peter states that \"this one\" [\u03bf\u1f57\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2], i.e. Jesus, \"is lord [\u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2] of all.\" The title, \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, was often ascribed to the Roman emperor in antiquity, rendering its use by Luke as an appellation for Jesus an unsubtle challenge to the emperor\u2019s authority.{{sfn|Rowe|2005|pp=291-8}} Thus, while the overt relationship between Christianity and empire in the book of Acts can generally be characterized as irenic, Luke insinuates the inevitability of conflict between the two over the issue of ultimate allegiance.\n\n==Comparison with other writings==\n[[File:Probably Valentin de Boulogne - Saint Paul Writing His Epistles - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Saint Paul Writing His Epistles'', ascribed to [[Valentin de Boulogne]], 17th century]]\n\n===Gospel of Luke===\nAs the second part of the two-part work Luke\u2013Acts, Acts has significant links to the [[Gospel of Luke]]. Major turning points in the structure of Acts, for example, find parallels in Luke: the presentation of the child Jesus in the Temple parallels the opening of Acts in the Temple, Jesus's forty days of testing in the wilderness prior to his mission parallel the forty days prior to his Ascension in Acts, the mission of Jesus in Samaria and the Decapolis (the lands of the Samaritans and Gentiles) parallels the missions of the Apostles in Samaria and the Gentile lands, and so on (see [[Gospel of Luke]]). These parallels continue through both books. There are also differences between Luke and Acts, amounting at times to outright contradiction. For example, the gospel seems to place the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]] on [[Easter Sunday]], immediately after the [[Resurrection of Christ|Resurrection]], while Acts 1 puts it forty days later.{{sfn|Zwiep|2010|p=39}} There are similar conflicts over the theology. While not seriously questioning the single authorship of Luke\u2013Acts, these differences do suggest the need for caution in seeking too much consistency in books written in essence as popular literature.{{sfn|Parsons|1993|pp=17\u201318}}\n\n===Pauline epistles===\nActs agrees with Paul's letters on the major outline of Paul's career: he is converted and becomes a Christian missionary and apostle, establishing new churches in Asia Minor and the Aegean and struggling to free Gentile Christians from the [[Jewish Law]]. There are also agreements on many incidents, such as Paul's escape from Damascus, where he is lowered down the walls in a basket. But details of these same incidents are frequently seen as contradictory: for example, according to Paul it was a pagan king who was trying to arrest him in Damascus, but according to Luke it was the Jews (2 Corinthians 11:33 and Acts 9:24).

However, the much older attested Assyrian tradition itself lists the first king of Assyria as the 25th century BC [[Tudiya]], and an early urbanised Assyrian king named [[Ushpia]] (c. 2050 BC) as having dedicated the first temple to the god Ashur in the city in the mid-21st century BC.

However it is likely that they were initially Sumerian-dominated administrative centres. In the late 26th century BC, [[Eannatum]] of [[Lagash]], then the dominant [[Sumer]]ian ruler in Mesopotamia, mentions \"smiting [[Subartu]]\" (Subartu being the Sumerian name for Assyria). Similarly, in ''c.'' the early 25th century BC, [[Lugal-Anne-Mundu]] the king of the Sumerian state of [[Adab (city)|Adab]] lists Subartu as paying tribute to him.\n\nOf the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is known. In the [[Assyrian King List]], the earliest king recorded was [[Tudiya]]. According to [[Georges Roux]] he would have lived in the mid 25th century BC, i.e. circa 2450 BC. In archaeological reports from [[Ebla]], it appeared that Tudiya's activities were confirmed with the discovery of a tablet where he concluded a treaty for the operation of a ''[[Karum (trade post)|karum]]'' (trading colony) in Eblaite territory, with \"king\" Ibrium of Ebla (who is now known to have been the [[vizier]] of Ebla for king Ishar-Damu).\n\nTudiya was succeeded on the list by [[Adamu]], the first known reference to the Semitic name ''Adam''<ref>Hamilton, Victor (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 1 \u2013 17. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. {{ISBN|9780802825216}}.</ref> and then a further thirteen rulers ([[Yangi]], [[Suhlamu]], [[Harharu]], [[Mandaru]], [[Imsu]], [[Harsu]], [[Didanu]], [[Hanu]], [[Zuabu]], [[Nuabu]], [[Abazu (Assyrian king)|Abazu]], [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]] and [[Azarah]]). Nothing concrete is yet known about these names, although it has been noted that a much later Babylonian tablet listing the ancestral lineage of [[Hammurabi]], the [[Amorite]] king of Babylon, seems to have copied the same names from Tudiya through Nuabu, though in a heavily corrupted form.\n\nThe earliest kings, such as Tudiya, who are recorded as ''kings who lived in tents'', were independent semi-nomadic pastoralist rulers. These kings at some point became fully urbanised and founded the ''city state'' of [[Ashur]] in the mid 21st century BC.{{sfn|Saggs|1984|p=24}}\n\n===Akkadian Empire and Neo-Sumerian Empires===\n\n\n{{further|Akkadian Empire|Neo-Sumerian Empire}}\n[[File:Empire akkad.svg|thumb|250px|right|Map of the Akkadian Empire (brown) and the directions in which military campaigns were conducted (yellow arrows).]]\n\nDuring the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2334\u20132154 BC), the Assyrians, like all the Akkadian speaking Mesopotamians (and also the Sumerians), became subject to the dynasty of the city state of [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], centered in central Mesopotamia. The Akkadian Empire founded by [[Sargon the Great]] claimed to encompass the surrounding \"four quarters\". The region of Assyria, north of the seat of the empire in central Mesopotamia, had also been known as [[Subartu]] by the Sumerians, and the name Azuhinum in Akkadian records also seems to refer to Assyria proper.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=EwBuAAAAMAAJ |page=32 }} |title=Prehistory and Protohistory of the Arabian Peninsula: Bahrain|work=M.

On those tablets, Assyrian traders in [[Burushanda]] implored the help of their ruler, Sargon the Great, and this appellation continued to exist throughout the Assyrian Empire for about 1,700 years. The name \"Hatti\" itself even appears in later accounts of his grandson, [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], campaigning in [[Anatolia]].\n\nAssyrian and Akkadian traders spread the use of writing in the form of the Mesopotamian [[cuneiform]] script to Asia Minor and [[The Levant]] (modern [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]).

However, the king list is the only information from Assyria for this period.\n\nMost of Assyria briefly became part of the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]] (or [[3rd dynasty of Ur]]) founded in c. 2112 BC.

One local ruler (''shakkanakku'') named Z\u0101riqum (who does not appear on any Assyrian king list) is listed as paying tribute to [[Amar-Sin]] of Ur. Ashur's rulers appear to have remained largely under Sumerian domination until the mid-21st century BC (c. 2050 BC); the king list names Assyrian rulers for this period and several are known from other references to have also borne the title of ''shakkanakka'' or vassal governors for the neo-Sumerians.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=fhMTRcUm9WsC |page=7 }} |title=The Invention of Cuneiform: Writing in Sumer|work=Jean-Jacques Glassner|year=1990|page=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=BPX0h_wbFtEC |page=11 }} |title=Area Handbook for the Persian Gulf States|work=Richard F.

Assyria was a major [[Mesopotamian]] [[Afro-Asiatic language|Afro-Asiatic]]-speaking kingdom and empire of the [[ancient Near East]]. Centered on the [[Tigris-Euphrates River System]] in [[Upper Mesopotamia]], the [[Assyrian people]] came to rule powerful empires at several times. Making up a substantial part of the \"[[Cradle of Civilization]]\", which included [[Sumer]], the [[Akkadian Empire]], and [[Babylonia]], Assyria was at the height of technological, scientific and cultural achievements at its peak.\n\nAt its peak, the Assyrian empire ruled over what the [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]] referred to as the \"[[Four Corners of the World]]\": as far north as the [[Caucasus Mountains]] within the territory of present-day [[Armenia]] and the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]], as far east as the [[Zagros Mountains]] within the territory of present-day [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], as far south as the [[Arabian Desert]] of today's [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]], as far west as the island of [[Cyprus]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and even further to the west in [[Egypt]] and eastern [[Libya]].<ref name=\"Albert Kirk Grayson 1972 108\"/>\n\nAssyria is named for its original capital, the ancient city of [[A\u0161\u0161ur]], which dates to c. 2600 BC, originally one of a number of Akkadian city states in Mesopotamia. Assyria was also sometimes known as Subartu and Azuhinum prior to the rise of the city-state of A\u0161\u0161\u016br, after which it was A\u0161\u0161\u016br\u0101yu, and after its fall.\n\n[[Ushpia]] (2050\u20132030 BC) appears to have been the first fully urbanised independent king of Assyria, and is traditionally held to have dedicated temples to the god [[Ashur]] in the city of the same name.<ref>Poebel, Arno (1942). The Assyrian King List from Khorsabad, Journal of Near Eastern Studies 1/3, 253.</ref> He was followed by [[Sulili]], [[Kikkiya]] and [[Akiya]], of whom little is known aside from Kikkiya conducting various building works in Assur.\n\nAssyria remained strong and secure; when Babylon was sacked and its Amorite rulers deposed by the [[Hittite Empire]], and subsequently fell to the [[Kassites]] in 1595 BC, both powers were unable to make any inroads into Assyria, and there seems to have been no trouble between the first Kassite ruler of Babylon, [[Agum II]], and [[Erishum III]] (1598\u20131586 BC) of Assyria, and a mutually beneficial treaty was signed between the two rulers. [[Shamshi-Adad II]] (1585\u20131580 BC), [[Ishme-Dagan II]] (1579\u20131562 BC) and [[Shamshi-Adad III]] (1562\u20131548 BC) seem also to have had peaceful tenures, although few records have thus far been discovered about their reigns. Similarly, [[Ashur-nirari I]] (1547\u20131522 BC) seems not to have been troubled by the newly founded [[Mitanni]] Empire in Asia Minor, the Hittite empire, or Babylon during his 25-year reign. He is known to have been an active king, improving the infrastructure, dedicating temples and conducting various building projects throughout the kingdom.\n\n====Decline, 1450\u20131393 BC====\n[[File:Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia c. 1450 BC.png|thumb|250px|right|Overview map of the Ancient Near East in the 15th century BC (Middle Assyrian period), showing the core territory of Assyria with its two major cities [[Assur]] and [[Nineveh]] wedged between [[Babylonia]] downstream (to the south-east) and the states of [[Mitanni]] and [[Hittite Empire|Hatti]] upstream (to the north-west).]]\n\nThe emergence of the Mitanni Empire in the 16th century BC did eventually lead to a short period of sporadic [[Mitannian]]-[[Hurrian]] domination in the latter half of the 15th century. The Indo-European-speaking Mitannians are thought to have conquered and formed the ruling class over the indigenous Hurrians of eastern Anatolia. The Hurrians spoke a language isolate, i.e. neither Semitic nor Indo-European.\n[[Ashur-nadin-ahhe I]] (1450\u20131431 BC) was courted by the Egyptians, who were rivals of Mitanni, and attempting to gain a foothold in the Near East. [[Amenhotep II]] sent the Assyrian king a tribute of gold to seal an alliance against the Hurri-Mitannian empire. It is likely that this alliance prompted [[Saushtatar]], the emperor of Mitanni, to invade Assyria, and sack the city of Ashur, after which Assyria became a sometime vassal state, with Ashur-nadin-ahhe I being deposed by Shaustatar and replaced by his own brother [[Enlil-nasir II]] (1430\u20131425 BC) in 1430 BC, who was then made to pay tribute to the Mitanni. [[Ashur-nirari II]] (1424\u20131418 BC) had an uneventful reign, and appears to have also paid tribute to the Mitanni Empire.\nThe Assyrian monarchy survived, and the Mitannian influence appears to have been short lived.\n\nThey appear not to have been always willing or indeed able to interfere in Assyrian internal and international affairs.\n[[Ashur-bel-nisheshu]] (1417\u20131409 BC) seems to have been independent of Mitannian influence, as evidenced by his signing a mutually beneficial treaty with [[Karaindash]], the Kassite king of Babylonia in the late 15th century. He also undertook extensive rebuilding work in Ashur itself, and Assyria appears to have redeveloped its former highly sophisticated financial and economic systems during his reign.\n[[Ashur-rim-nisheshu]] (1408\u20131401 BC) also undertook building work, strengthening the city walls of the capital.\n[[Ashur-nadin-ahhe II]] (1400\u20131393 BC) also received a tribute of gold and diplomatic overtures from Egypt, probably in an attempt to gain Assyrian military support against Egypt's Mitannian and Hittite rivals in the region. However, the Assyrian king appears not to have been in a strong enough position to challenge Mitanni or the Hittites.\n\n[[Eriba-Adad I]] (1392\u20131366 BC), a son of Ashur-bel-nisheshu, ascended the throne in 1392 BC and finally broke the ties to the Mitanni Empire, and instead began to exert Assyrian influence on the Mitanni.\n\n===Middle Assyrian Empire 1392\u20131056 BC===\n{{Main|Middle Assyrian Empire}}\n{{Infobox former country\n|conventional_long_name = Middle Assyrian Empire\n|common_name = Middle Assyrian Empire\n|native_name = \n|\n|p1 = Old Assyrian Empire\n|flag_p1 =\n|year_start = 1392 BC\n|year_end = 934 BC\n|s1 = Neo-Assyrian Empire\n|flag_s1 = Map of Assyria.png\n|\n|image_flag =\n|image_coat =\n|\n|image_map = 14 century BC Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East.png\n|image_map_caption = Map of the [[Ancient Near East]] during the [[Amarna Period]] (14th century BC), showing the great powers of the day: Egypt (orange), [[Hittite empire|Hatti]] (blue), the [[Kassites|Kassite]] kingdom of Babylon (black), Assyria (yellow), and Mitanni (brown).

Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between [[Tushratta]] and his brother [[Artatama II]] and after this his son [[Shuttarna III]], who called himself king of the Hurri while seeking support from the Assyrians. The Hittites, having failed to save Mitanni, allied with Babylon in an unsuccessful economic war against Assyria for many years. Assyria was now a large and powerful empire, and a major threat to Egyptian and Hittite interests in the region, and was perhaps the reason that these two powers, fearful of Assyrian might, made peace with one another.<ref>{{harvnb|Roux|1964|p=263}}.</ref>\n\nShalmaneser's son and successor, [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (1244\u20131207 BC), won a major victory against the Hittites and their king [[Tudhaliya IV]] at the [[Battle of Nihriya]] and took thousands of prisoners. He then conquered Babylonia, taking [[Kashtiliash IV]] as a captive and ruled there himself as king for seven years, taking on the old title \"King of Sumer and Akkad\" first used by Sargon of Akkad.

As relations with the priesthood in Ashur began deteriorating, Tukulti-Ninurta built a new capital city; [[Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta]].<ref>{{harvnb|Roux|1964|pp=26\u201334}}.</ref>\n\nThe Aramaeans of northern and central Syria were the next targets of the Assyrian king, who made his way as far as the sources of the Tigris.<ref name=\"Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968\">{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=968}}</ref> The control of the high road to the Mediterranean was secured by the possession of the Hittite town of [[Pitru]]<ref>Bryce, Trevor.

Leo Oppenheim]] translates as a [[narwhal]]) in the sea.<ref name=\"Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968\"/> He was passionately fond of hunting and was also a great builder.

He maintained friendly relations with [[Marduk-shapik-zeri]] of Babylon, however upon the death of that king, he invaded Babylonia and deposed the new ruler [[Kada\u0161man-Buria\u0161]], appointing [[Adad-apla-iddina]] as his vassal in Babylon. He built some of the earliest examples of both [[Zoological Gardens]] and [[Botanical Gardens]] in Ashur, collecting all manner of animals and plants from his empire, and receiving a collection of exotic animals as tributes from Egypt.\n\nLate in his reign, the Middle Assyrian Empire erupted into civil war, when a rebellion was orchestrated by Tukulti-Mer, a pretender to the throne of Assyria. Ashur-bel-kala eventually crushed Tukulti-Mer and his allies, however the civil war in Assyria had allowed hordes of Arameans to take advantage of the situation, and press in on Assyrian controlled territory from the west. Ashur-bel-kala counterattacked them, and conquered as far as Carchemish and the source of the [[Khabur (Tigris)|Khabur river]], but by the end of his reign many of the areas of Syria and Phoenicia-Canaan to the west of these regions as far as the Mediterranean, previously under firm Assyrian control, were eventually lost to the Assyrian Empire.\n\n====Society and law in the Middle Assyrian Period====\n[[File:C+B-Music-Fig24-AssyrianQuartet.PNG|thumb|220px|Assyrian [[quartet]].]]\nThe Middle Assyrian kingdom was well organized, and in the firm control of the king, who also functioned as the High Priest of [[Anshar|Ashur]], the state god. He had certain obligations to fulfill in the cult, and had to provide resources for the temples. The priesthood became a major power in Assyrian society. Conflicts with the priesthood are thought to have been behind the murder of king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]].\n\nThe Middle Assyrian Period was marked by the long wars fought that helped build Assyria into a [[warrior society]]. The king depended on both the citizen class and priests in his capital, and the landed nobility who supplied the horses needed by Assyria's military. Documents and letters illustrate the importance of the latter to Assyrian society. Assyria needed less artificial [[irrigation]] than Babylonia, and horse-breeding was extensive. Portions of elaborate texts about the care and training of them have been found. Trade was carried out in all directions. The mountain country to the north and west of Assyria was a major source of metal ore, as well as lumber. Economic factors were a common ''[[casus belli]]''.\n\nAll free male citizens were obliged to serve in the army for a time, a system which was called the ''ilku''-service. A [[legal code]] was produced during the 14th and 13th centuries which, among other things, clearly shows that the social position of women in Assyria was lower than that of neighbouring societies. Men were permitted to [[divorce]] their wives with no compensation paid to the latter. If a woman committed [[adultery]], she could be beaten or put to death. It's not certain if these laws were seriously enforced, but they appear to be a backlash against some older documents that granted things like equal compensation to both partners in divorce.\n\nThe women of the king's [[harem]] and their servants were also subject to harsh punishments, such as [[Strike (attack)|beatings]], [[mutilation]], and death. Assyria, in general, had much harsher laws than most of the region. [[Execution]]s were not uncommon, nor were whippings followed by [[forced labour]]. Some offenses allowed the accused a trial under torture or duress. One tablet that covers property rights has brutal penalties for violators. A creditor could force debtors to work for him, but not sell them.\n\nIn the Middle Assyrian Laws, [[sex crime]]s were punished identically whether they were [[homosexual]] or [[heterosexual]].<ref name=\"Nissinen\">Homoeroticism in the Biblical World: A Historical Perspective, by Martti Nissinen, Fortress Press, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sHSNPG85tUC&lpg=PP1&dq=Homoeroticism%20in%20the%20Biblical%20World%20Nissinen&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 24\u201328]</ref> An individual faced no punishment for penetrating a cult prostitute, someone of an equal [[social class]], or someone whose [[gender role]]s were not considered solidly masculine.

However, upon the death of [[Ashur-bel-kala]] in 1056 BC, Assyria went into a ''comparative'' decline for the next 100 or so years. The empire shrank significantly, and by 1020 BC Assyria appears to have controlled only areas close to Assyria itself, essential to keeping trade routes open in eastern Aramea, south eastern Asia Minor, central Mesopotamia and north western Iran.\n\nNew [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic-speaking]] peoples such as the [[Arameans]], [[Chaldea]]ns and [[Suteans]] moved into areas to the west and south of Assyria, including overrunning much of Babylonia to the south, Indo-European speaking [[Iranic]] peoples such as the [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Sarmatians]] and [[Parthia|Parthians]] moved into the lands to the east of Assyria, displacing the native [[Kassites]] and [[Gutians]] and pressuring [[Elam]] and [[Mannea]] (all of which ancient non Indo-European civilisations of Ancient Iran), and to the north in [[Asia Minor]] the [[Phrygians]] overran that part of the Hittites not already destroyed by Assyria, and [[Lydia]] emerged, a new [[Hurrian]] state named [[Urartu]] arose in the [[Caucasus]], and [[Cimmerians]], [[Colchians]] (Georgians) and [[Scythians]] around the [[Black Sea]] and [[Caucasus]].

The use of quotation marks in association with the term \"Sea Peoples\" in our title is intended to draw attention to the problematic nature of this commonly used term. It is noteworthy that the designation \"of the sea\" appears only in relation to the Sherden, Shekelesh, and Eqwesh. Subsequently, this term was applied somewhat indiscriminately to several additional ethnonyms, including the Philistines, who are portrayed in their earliest appearance as invaders from the north during the reigns of Merenptah and Ramesses Ill (see, e.g., Sandars 1978; Redford 1992, 243, n. 14; for a recent review of the primary and secondary literature, see Woudhuizen 2006).

He cleared Aramean and other tribal peoples from Assyria's borders and began to expand in all directions into [[Anatolia]], [[Ancient Iran]], [[Levant]] and [[Babylonia]].\n\n[[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883\u2013859 BC) continued this expansion apace, subjugating much of the Levant to the west, the newly arrived [[Persians]] and [[Medes]] to the east, annexed central Mesopotamia from Babylon to the south, and expanded deep into [[Asia Minor]] to the north. He moved the capital from [[Ashur]] to [[Kalhu]] ([[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]) and undertook impressive building works throughout Assyria. [[Shalmaneser III]] (859\u2013824 BC) projected Assyrian power even further, conquering to the foothills of the [[Caucasus]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Aram-Damascus]], and subjugating [[Persia]] and the [[Arabs]] who dwelt to the south of Mesopotamia, as well as driving the [[Egyptians]] from [[Canaan]]. It was during the reign of Shalmaneser III that the [[Arab people|Arabs]] and [[Chaldaea|Chaldeans]] first enter the pages of recorded history.\n\nLittle further expansion took place under [[Shamshi-Adad V]] and his successor, the regent queen [[Semiramis]], however when [[Adad-nirari III]] (811\u2013783 BC) came of age, he took the reins of power from mother and set about a relentless campaign of conquest; subjugated the Arameans, Phoenicians, Philistines, Israelites, Neo-Hittites and Edomites, Persians, Medes and Manneans, penetrating as far as the [[Caspian Sea]]. He invaded and subjugated [[Babylonia]], and then the migrant [[Chaldea]]n and [[Sutean]] tribes settled in south eastern Mesopotamia whom he conquered and reduced to vassalage.\n\nAfter the reign of Adad-nirari III, Assyria entered a period of instability and decline, losing its hold over most of its vassal and tributary territories by the middle of the 8th century BC, until the reign of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] (745\u2013727 BC). He created the world's first [[professional army]], introduced [[Imperial Aramaic]] as the [[lingua franca]] of Assyria and its vast empire, and reorganised the empire drastically. Tiglath-Pileser III conquered as far as the [[East Mediterranean]], bringing the [[Greeks]] of [[Cyprus]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Philistia]], [[Samarra]] and the whole of [[Aramea]] under Assyrian control. Not satisfied with merely holding Babylonia in vassalage, Tiglath-Pileser deposed its king and had himself crowned king of Babylon. The imperial, economic, political, military and administrative reforms of Tiglath-Pileser III were to prove a blueprint for future empires, such as those of the Persians, Greeks, Romans, Carthaginians, Byzantines, Arabs and Turks.\n\n[[Shalmaneser V]] reigned only briefly, but once more drove the Egyptians from southern Canaan, where they were fomenting revolt against Assyria. [[Sargon II]] quickly took Samaria, effectively ending the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] and carrying 27,000 people away into captivity into the Israelite diaspora. He was forced to fight a war to drive out the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] who had attempted to invade Assyria's vassal states of [[Persia]] and [[Media (region)|Media]]. The [[Neo-Hittite]] states of northern Syria were conquered, as well as [[Cilicia]]. [[Lydia]] and [[Commagene]]. King [[Midas]] of [[Phrygia]], fearful of Assyrian power, offered his hand in friendship. [[Elam]] was defeated and [[Babylonia]] and [[Chaldea]] reconquered. He made a new capital city named [[Dur Sharrukin]]. He was succeeded by his son [[Sennacherib]] who moved the capital to [[Nineveh]] and made the deported peoples work on improving Nineveh's system of irrigation canals. Nineveh was transformed into the largest city in the world at the time.\n\n[[Esarhaddon]] had Babylon rebuilt, he imposed a ''vassal treaty'' upon his Persian, Median and Parthian subjects, and he once more defeated the Scythes and Cimmerians. Tiring of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] interference in the Assyrian Empire, [[Esarhaddon]] decided to conquer Egypt. In 671 BC he crossed the [[Sinai Desert]], invaded and took Egypt with surprising ease and speed. He drove its foreign [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] and [[Ethiopia]]n rulers out, destroying the [[Kushite Empire]] in the process. Esarhaddon declared himself \"king of [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], and [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]\".

[[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Egypt's 26th Dynasty]], which had been installed by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]] as vassals, quietly detached itself from Assyria, although it was careful to retain friendly relations.\n\nThe [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] took advantage of the bitter fighting among the Assyrians to raid [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] colonies, with hordes of horse-borne marauders ravaging parts of [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], where the vassal kings of [[Urartu]] and [[Lydia]] begged their [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] overlord for help in vain. They also raided the [[Levant]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (where [[Ashkelon]] was sacked by the [[Scythians]]) and all the way into [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] whose coasts were ravaged and looted with impunity.\n\nThe [[Iranic]] peoples (the [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns and [[Parthia|Parthians]]), aided by the previous [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] destruction of the hitherto dominant [[Elamites]] of [[Ancient Iran]], also took advantage of the upheavals in [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]] to coalesce into a powerful Median-dominated force which destroyed the ''pre-Iranic'' kingdom of [[Mannea]] and absorbed the remnants of the pre-Iranic [[Elamites]] of southern [[Iran]], and the equally pre-Iranic [[Gutians]], [[Manneans]] and [[Kassites]] of the [[Zagros Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea]].\n\n[[Cyaxares]] (technically a vassal of [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]]), in an alliance with the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]], launched a surprise attack on a civil war beleaguered Assyria in 615 BC, sacking Kalhu (the Biblical [[Nimrud|Calah/Nimrud]]) and [[Battle of Arrapha|taking Arrapha]] (modern Kirkuk) and [[Gasur]].

In a twist of fate, [[Nabonidus]], the last king of [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylon]] (together with his son and co-regent [[Belshazzar]]), was himself an Assyrian from [[Harran]]. He had overthrown the short-lived [[Chaldea]]n dynasty in Babylonia, after which the Chaldeans disappeared from history, being fully absorbed into the native population of Babylonia. However, apart from plans to dedicate religious temples in the city of Harran, Nabonidus showed little interest in rebuilding Assyria. [[Nineveh]] and [[Kalhu]] remained in ruins with only small numbers of Assyrians living within them; conversely, a number of towns and cities, such as [[Arrapkha]], [[Guzana]], [[Nohadra]] and [[Harran]], remained intact, and [[Assur]] and [[Erbil|Arbela]] ([[Irbil]]) were not completely destroyed, as is attested by their later revival.

Between 546 and 545 BC, Assyria rebelled against the new Persian Dynasty, which had usurped the previous Median dynasty. The rebellion centered around [[Tyareh]] was eventually quashed by [[Cyrus the Great]].\n\nAssyria seems to have recovered dramatically, and flourished during this period. It became a major agricultural and administrative centre of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], and its soldiers were a mainstay of the Persian Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html |title=Assyrians after Assyria |publisher=Nineveh.com |date=4 September 1999 |access-date=19 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714183623/http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html |archivedate=14 July 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}</ref> In fact, Assyria even became powerful enough to raise another full-scale revolt against the Persian empire in 520\u2013519 BC.\n\nThe [[Persian people|Persians]] had spent centuries under Assyrian domination (their first ruler [[Achaemenes]] and his successors, having been vassals of Assyria), and Assyrian influence can be seen in Achaemenid art, infrastructure and administration. Early Persian rulers saw themselves as successors to [[Ashurbanipal]], and [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] was retained as the ''lingua franca'' of the empire for over two hundred years, and Greek writers such as [[Thucydides]] still referred to it as ''the Assyrian language''.<ref>{{harvnb|Van de Mieroop|2004b|p=293}}</ref> [[Nineveh]] was never rebuilt however, and 200 years after it was sacked [[Xenophon]] reported only small numbers of Assyrians living amongst its ruins.

Five centuries later these were later to have a global influence as the liturgical language and written script for [[Syriac Christianity]] and its accompanying [[Syriac literature]] which also emerged in Assyria before spreading throughout the [[Near East]], [[Asia Minor]], The [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and [[China]].\n\n====Macedonian and Seleucid Assyria====\nIn 332 BC, Assyria fell to [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] Emperor, who called the inhabitants ''Assyrioi''. The [[Macedonian Empire]] (332\u2013312) was partitioned in 312 BC. It thereafter became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]] (312 BC). It is from this period that the later [[Name of Syria|''Syria'' vs ''Assyria'' naming controversy arises]], the Seleucids applied the name 'Syria' which is a 9th-century BC [[Indo-Anatolian]] derivation of 'Assyria' (see [[Etymology of Syria]]) not only to Assyria itself, but also to the Levantine lands to the west (historically known as [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] and [[Eber Nari]]), which had been part of the Assyrian empire but, the north east corner aside, never a part of Assyria proper.\n\nWhen the Seleucids lost control of Assyria proper, the name ''Syria'' survived but was erroneously applied not only to the land of Assyria itself, but also now to [[Aramea]] (also known as [[Eber Nari]]) to the west that had once been part of the Assyrian empire, but apart from the north eastern corner, had never been a part of Assyria itself, nor inhabited by Assyrians. This was to lead to both the Assyrians from Northern Mesopotamia and the Arameans and Phoenicians from the Levant being collectively dubbed ''Syrians'' (and later also ''Syriacs'') in [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] and later European culture, regardless of ethnicity, history or geography.\n\nDuring Seleucid rule, Assyrians ceased to hold the senior military, economic and civil positions they had enjoyed under the Achaemenids, being largely replaced by Greeks. The Greek language also replaced Mesopotamian East Aramaic as the lingua franca of the empire, although this did not affect the Assyrian population themselves, who were not Hellenised during the Seleucid era.\n\nDuring the Seleucid period in southern Mesopotamia, [[Babylon]] was gradually abandoned in favour of a new city named [[Seleucia on the Tigris]], effectively bringing an end to ''Babylonia'' as a geo-political entity.\n\n====Parthian Assyria (150 BC \u2013 225 AD)====\n{{Main|Adiabene}}\nBy 150 BC, Assyria was largely under the control of the [[Parthian Empire]]. The Parthians seem to have exercised only loose control over Assyria, and between the mid 2nd century BC and 4th century AD a number of [[Neo-Assyrian]] states arose; these included the ancient capital of [[Assur]] itself, [[Adiabene]] with its capital of [[Irbid|Arbela]] (modern [[Irbil]]), [[Beth Nuhadra]] with its capital of [[Nohadra]] (modern [[Dohuk]]), [[Osroene]], with its capitals of [[Edessa]] and [[Amid]] (modern [[Sanliurfa]] and [[Diyarbakir]]), [[Hatra]], and \"\u0712\u071d\u072c\u0713\u072a\u0721\u071d\" ([[Beth Garmai]]) with its capital at [[Arrapha]] (modern [[Kirkuk]]).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfYnu5F20coC&pg=PA135|title=Sasanid soldiers in early Muslim society: the origins of 'Ayy\u0101r\u0101n and Futuwwa|last=Mohsen|first=Zakeri|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=1995|isbn=978-3-447-03652-8|page=135}}</ref> Adiabenian rulers converted to [[Second Temple Judaism|Judaism]] from [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|paganism]] in the 1st century.<ref>{{cite web\n|last=Gottheil\n|first=Richard\n|title=Adiabene\n|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/801-adiabene\n|publisher=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref> After 115 AD, there are no historic traces of Jewish royalty in Adiabene.\n\nThese freedoms were accompanied by a major Assyrian cultural revival, and temples to the Assyrian national gods [[Ashur]], [[Sin]], [[Hadad]], [[Ishtar]], [[Ninurta]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] and [[Shamash]] were once more dedicated throughout Assyria and Upper Mesopotamia during this period.<ref>Crone & Cook 1977, p. 55</ref>\n\nIn addition, [[Christianity]] arrived in Assyria soon after the death of Christ and the Assyrians began to gradually convert to [[Christianity]] from the [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]] during the period between the early first and third centuries. Assyria became an important centre of [[Syriac Christianity]] and [[Syriac Literature]], with the [[Church of the East]] evolving in Assyria, and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] partly also, with Osroene becoming the first independent [[Christian]] state in history.<ref name=\"Winkler p. 1\"/>\n\n====Roman Assyria (116\u20138)====\n{{Main|Assyria (Roman province)}}\nHowever, in 116, under [[Trajan]], Assyria and its independent states were briefly taken over by Rome as the [[Assyria (Roman province)|province of Assyria]]. The Assyrian kingdom of [[Adiabene]] was destroyed as an independent state during this period. Roman rule lasted only a few years, and the Parthians once more regained control with the help of the Assyrians, who were incited to overthrow the Roman garrisons by the Parthian king. However, a number of Assyrians were conscripted into the [[Roman Army]], with many serving in the region of [[Hadrian's Wall]] in [[Roman Britain]], and inscriptions in Aramaic made by soldiers have been discovered in [[Northern England]] dating from the second century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/oct/13/hadrians-wall|title=When Syrians, Algerians and Iraqis patrolled Hadrian's Wall|author=Charlotte Higgins|work=the Guardian|access-date=16 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith loose Parthian rule restored, Assyria and its patchwork of states continued much as they had before the Roman interregnum, although Assyria and Mesopotamia as a whole became a front line between the Roman and Parthian empires. Other new religious movements also emerged in the form of [[gnosticism|gnostic sects]] such as [[Mandeanism]], as well as the now extinct [[Manichean]] religion.\n\n===Christian period===\n\n====Sassanid Assyria (226 \u2013 c. 650)====\n{{Main|As\u014drist\u0101n}}\n[[Image:N-Mesopotamia and Syria.svg|thumb|360px|[[Upper Mesopotamia]] and Syria in the [[early Christian]] period, with [[Edessa]] in the left upper quadrant]]\nIn 226, Assyria was largely taken over by the [[Sasanian Empire]]. After driving out the Romans and Parthians, the Sassanid rulers set about [[annexing]] the independent states within Assyria during the mid- to late 3rd century, the last being Assur itself in the late 250's to early 260's. Christianity continued to spread, and many of the ethnically Assyrian churches that exist today are among the oldest in the world. For example, the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] is purported to have been founded by [[St Peter]] himself in 67 AD.\n\nNevertheless, although predominantly Christian, a minority of Assyrians still held onto their ancient [[Mesopotamian religion]] until as late as the 10th or 11th century AD.<ref name=\"nineveh.com\">{{cite web|last=Parpola |first=Simo |title=ASSYRIAN IDENTITY IN ANCIENT TIMES AND TODAY |url=http://www.nineveh.com/parpola_eng.pdf}}</ref><ref>Fuller, 1864, pp. 200\u2013201.</ref> The Assyrians lived in a province known as [[Asuristan]], and the region was on the frontier of the Byzantine and Sassanian empires.\n\nThe land was known as [[As\u014drist\u0101n]] (the Sassanid Persian name meaning \"Land of the Assyrians\") during this period, and became the birthplace of the distinct [[Church of the East]] (now split into the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Ancient Church of the East]] and [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]) and a centre of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], with a flourishing [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]] ([[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]) Christian culture which exists there to this day. Temples were still being dedicated to the national god [[Ashur]] (as well as other Mesopotamian gods) in his home city, in [[Harran]] and elsewhere during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, indicating the ancient pre-Christian Assyrian identity was still extant to some degree.\n\nDuring the Sasanian period, much of what had once been [[Babylonia]] in southern Mesopotamia was incorporated into Assyria, and in effect the whole of Mesopotamia came to be known as As\u014drist\u0101n. Parts of Assyria appear to have been semi independent as late as the latter part of the 4th century AD, with a king named [[Sennacherib II]] reputedly ruling the northern reaches in 370s AD.\n\n====Arab Islamic conquest (630\u2013780)====\nCenturies of constant warfare between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Sassanid Empire]] left both empires exhausted, which made both of them open to loss in a war against the [[Muslim]] Arab army, under the newfound [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. After the early Islamic conquests, Assyria was dissolved as an official administrative entity by an empire. Under Arab rule, Mesopotamia as a whole underwent a gradual process of further [[Arabisation]] and the beginning of [[Islamification]], and the region saw a large influx of ''non indigenous'' Arabs, [[Kurds]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], and [[Turkic peoples]].\n\nHowever, the indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] population of northern Mesopotamia retained their language, religion, culture and identity.\n\nUnder the Arab Islamic empires, the Christian Assyrians were classed as ''[[dhimmis]]'', who had certain restrictions imposed upon them. Assyrians were thus excluded from specific duties and occupations reserved for Muslims, they did not enjoy the same political rights as Muslims, their word was not equal to that of a Muslim in legal and civil matters without a Muslim witness, they were subject to payment of a special tax ([[jizyah]]) and they were banned from spreading their religion further in Muslim-ruled lands. However, personal matters such as marriage and divorce were governed by the cultural laws of the Assyrians.<ref>H. Patrick Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World''.

A large number of followers of the [[Church of the East]] were dissatisfied with the leadership of the Church, at this point based in the [[Rabban Hormizd Monastery]] near [[Alqosh]], and in particular with the system of hereditary succession of the patriarch.

In 1677, he obtained recognition from the Turkish authorities as invested with independent power in Diyarbak\u0131r and Mardin, and in 1681 he was recognized by Rome as \"patriarch of the Chaldean nation deprived of its patriarch\".

His successor Eliya XII, after sending his profession of faith to Rome and receiving confirmation as Catholic patriarch, adopted a traditionalist position in 1779. His opponents elected [[Yohannan VIII Hormizd|Yohannan Hormizd]], a young nephew of Eliya XI, whom Eliya XI had intended to be his successor. Although Yohannan Hormizd won the support of most of the followers of the Alqosh patriarchate, Rome considered his election to be irregular and, instead of accepting him as patriarch, merely confirmed him as metropolitan of Mosul and patriarchal administrator. He was thus granted the powers and the insignia of a patriarch, but not the title. It made the same arrangement in Diyarbak\u0131r, appointing as patriarchal administrator [[Joseph V Augustine Hindi|Augustine Hindi]], a nephew of [[Joseph IV (Chaldean Patriarch)|Joseph IV]], whom his uncle wished to be his successor as patriarch. There were thus two traditionalist patriarchates (the Eliya line and the Shimun) and, under administrators, two Catholic patriarchates (Diyarbak\u0131r and Alqosh/Mosul).\n\nIn 1804, Eliya XI died and had no traditionalist successor.

The Assyrian Genocide ran largely in conjunction with the similarly ethno-religiously motivated [[Armenian Genocide]], [[Greek Genocide]] and [[Great Famine of Mount Lebanon]].\n\nIn reaction against Ottoman cruelty, the Assyrians took up arms, and an [[Assyrian war of independence]] was fought during [[World War I]] which took place in what is today south eastern Turkey, northern Iraq, north western Iran and north eastern Syria. For a time, the Assyrians fought successfully against overwhelming numbers, scoring a number of victories against the Ottomans and Kurds, and also hostile Arab and Iranian groups. However, due to the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]]\u2014due to the [[Russian Revolution]]\u2014and the similar collapse of the [[Occupation of Turkish Armenia|Armenian Defense]], the Assyrians were left without allies. As a result, the Assyrians were vastly outnumbered, outgunned, surrounded, cut off, and without supplies. The only option they had was to flee the region into northwest Iran and fight their way, with around 50,000 civilians in tow, to [[United Kingdom|British]] train lines going to [[Mandatory Iraq]]. The sizable Assyrian presence in south eastern Anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced to no more than 15,000 by the end of World War I, and by 1924 many of those who remained were forcibly expelled in a display of [[ethnic cleansing]] by the Turkish government, with many leaving and later founding villages in the [[Sapna valley|Sapna]] and [[Nahla valley]]s in the [[Dohuk Governorate]] of [[Iraq]].\n\nIn 1920 the Assyrian settlements in [[Mindan]] and [[Baquba]] were attacked by [[Iraqi Arabs]], but the Assyrian tribesmen displayed their military prowess by successfully defeating and driving off the Arab forces.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">The Tragedy of the Assyrians By R. S. Stafford \u2013 Page \u2013 59</ref> The Assyrians also sided with the British during the [[Iraqi revolt against the British]].\n\nThe [[Assyrian Levies]] were founded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1922, with ancient Assyrian military rankings, such as [[Rab-shakeh]], Rab-talia and Turtanu, being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline, and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs, Kurds and [[Iraqi Turkman|Turcoman]], guard the borders with Iran and Turkey, and protect British military installations. During the 1920s Assyrian levies saw action in effectively defeating Arab and Kurdish forces during anti-British rebellions in Iraq.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>[[Len Deighton]] (1993), ''[[Blood, Tears and Folly]]''</ref><ref>A Modern History of the Kurds \u2013 Page 178 by David MacDowall \u2013 2004</ref>\n\n====Simele Massacre and World War II (1930\u20131950)====\n[[File:Assyria Map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Assyrian populated areas]]\nAfter Iraq was granted independence by the British in 1933, the Assyrians suffered the [[Simele Massacre]], where thousands of unarmed villagers (men, women and children) were slaughtered by joint Arab-Kurdish forces of the Iraqi Army. The massacres of civilians followed a clash between armed Assyrian tribesmen and the Iraqi army, where the Iraqi forces suffered a defeat after trying to disarm the Assyrians, whom they feared would attempt to secede from Iraq. Armed [[Iraq Levies|Assyrian Levies]] were prevented by the British from going to the aid of these civilians, and the British government then whitewashed the massacres at the [[League of Nations]].\n\nDespite these betrayals, the Assyrians were allied with the British during [[World War II]], with eleven Assyrian companies seeing action in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]/[[Israel]] and another four serving in [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Albania]]. Assyrians played a major role in the victory over Arab-Iraqi forces at the [[Battle of Habbaniya]] and elsewhere in 1941, when the Iraqi government decided to join World War II on the side of [[Nazi Germany]]. The British presence in Iraq lasted until 1955, and Assyrian Levies remained attached to British forces until this time, after which they were disarmed and disbanded.\n\nA further persecution of Assyrians took place in the [[Soviet Union]] in the late 1940s and early 1950s when thousands of Assyrians settled in Georgia, Armenia and southern Russia were forcibly deported from their homes in the dead of night by [[Stalin]] without warning or reason to [[Central Asia]], with most being relocated to [[Kazakhstan]], where a small minority still remain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://astanatimes.com/2014/12/assyrian-community-kazakhstan-survived-dark-times-now-focuses-education/|title=Assyrian Community in Kazakhstan Survived Dark Times, Now Focuses on Education|work=The Astana Times|accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Ba'athism (1966\u20132003)====\n[[File:FlagofAssyria.svg|thumb| The [[Assyrian flag|Flag of the Assyrian Nation]] (created and used since 1968)<ref>[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/assyria.html Assyria<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012054550/http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/Flags/assyria.html |date=12 October 2008 }}</ref>]]\nThe period from the 1940s through to 1963 was a period of respite for the Assyrians in northern Iraq and north east Syria. The regime of Iraqi President Kassim in particular saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, a number of Assyrians moved south to cities such as [[Baghdad]], [[Basra]] and [[Nasiriyah]] to enhance their economic prospects, others were well represented in politics, the military, the arts and entertainment, Assyrian towns, villages, farmsteads and Assyrian quarters in major cities flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel and be over-represented in sports such as boxing, football, athletics, wrestling and swimming.\n\nHowever, in 1963, the [[Ba'ath Party]] took power by force in Iraq, and came to power in Syria the same year. The Baathists, though secular, were [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalists]], and set about attempting to [[Arabization|Arabize]] the many non-Arab peoples of Iraq and Syria, including the Assyrians. This policy included refusing to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group, banning the publication of written material in Eastern Aramaic, and banning its teaching in schools, together with an attempt to ''Arabize'' the ancient pre-Arab heritage of Mesopotamian civilisation.\n\nThe policies of the Baathists have also long been mirrored in Turkey, whose nationalist governments have refused to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group since the 1920s, and have attempted to [[Turkification|Turkify]] the Assyrians by calling them \"Semitic Turks\" and forcing them to adopt Turkish names and language.

The destruction of the Assyrian capitals of Nineveh and Assur by the Babylonians, Medes and their allies, ensured that much of the bilingual elite (but not all) were wiped out. By the 7th century BC, much of the Assyrian population used distinct Akkadian influenced [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic varieties]] and not Akkadian itself. The last Akkadian inscriptions in Mesopotamia date from the 1st century AD. The [[Syriac language]] also emerged in Assyria during the 5th century BC, and during the Christian era, [[Syriac literature]] and [[Syriac script]] were to become hugely influential.\n\nHowever, the descendant Akkadian influenced Eastern Aramaic dialects from the Neo-Assyrian Empire, as well as Akkadian and Mesopotamian Aramaic personal, tribal, family and place names, still survive to this day among [[Assyrian people]] and are spoken fluently by up to 1,000,000 Assyrians, with a further number having lesser and varying degrees of fluency.<ref name=\"Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382\"/> These dialects which contain many Akkadian loan words and grammatical features are very different from the now almost extinct [[Western Aramaic]] of the [[Arameans]] in the [[Levant]] and [[Transjordan (region)|Trans-Jordan]], which does not have any Akkadian grammatical structure or loan words.\n\nAfter 90 years of effort, the [[University of Chicago]] in 2011 completed an Assyrian [[dictionary]], the style of which is more like an [[encyclopedia]] than a dictionary.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/science/07dictionary.html|title=After 90 Years, a Dictionary of an Ancient World|date=7 June 2011|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n\n====Ancient Assyrian religion====\n{{Main|Ancient Mesopotamian religion}}\nThe Assyrians, like the rest of the Mesopotamian peoples, followed [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]], with their national god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] having the most importance to them during the Assyrian Empire.

Assyrians had begun to adopt [[Christianity]] (as well as for a time [[Manicheanism]] and [[gnosticism]]) between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD.\n\n====Christian history of the Assyrian people====\nThe Assyrian people originally adhered to one of two Churches- The [[Assyrian Church of the East]], an [[East Syrian Rite]] Church, or the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], a [[West Syrian Rite]] Church. However, now there are nearly 20 different Assyrian Christian Churches including the ones followed by ethnically [[Malayali]] Converts in [[India]], known as [[St Thomas Christians]] who are not regarded as Assyrians. The first new Church formed around 100 years after the massacres by Timur during the 14th century due to the [[Schism of 1552]], which occurred among the Assyrians of northern Mesopotamia when a large number of Nestorian (followers of the Assyrian Church of the East) Assyrians in [[Diyarbakir|Amid]] elected a rival [[Patriarch]] named [[Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa]] after becoming dissatisfied with the leadership of the Assyrian Church (at this point based in [[Alqosh]]). Due to a need for an official ordination, Sulaqa went into communion with the [[Catholic Church]] after at first failing to gain acceptance within the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]. Rome named this new church ''The Church of Assyria and Mosul'' and its first leader ''Patriarch of the East Assyrians'' in 1553 AD.\n\nSoon after coming back Sulaqa was assassinated by supporters of the rival patriarch in Alqosh, but was able to form a new church structure and line of succession known as the Shimun Line prior to his death. This group of Assyrians eventually broke off ties with Rome, moved en masse to the Hakkari Mountains, and returned to the Nestorian faith they once adhered to prior to the Schism of 1552 (although the Shimun line still operated independently from the original Assyrian Church structure based in Alqosh).\n\nLater on in the 1830s the original [[Assyrian Church of the East]] structure in Alqosh combined with the Chaldean Catholic Jacobite one, creating the modern Chaldean Catholic Church structure, which is ironic considering that the only remaining ethnic Assyrian Church to practice the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] denomination until this day is ruled by the Shimun line- the very first Church to split from the Assyrian Church of the East back in 1552. There was also another Nestorian Denomination known as the [[Ancient Church of the East]], which split from the Assyrian Church of the East due to reforms passed under the rule of [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] in the 1960s, but with the election of [[Gewargis III]] in 2015 the churches had a reconciliation, and reunited.\n\nThe Syriac Orthodox Church also has a large number of ethnically Assyrian Adherents mainly in the historically Assyrian regions of north east Syria and south east Turkey, who are known as ''[[Syriac Orthodox Christians (Middle East)|Syriacs]]''. The Syriac Orthodox Church has 5 million adherents across the globe, mostly in India, but is based in Damascus. However, since the 11th century it was based in the [[Saffron Monastery]] of [[Tur Abdin]], and prior to that it was based in [[Antakya|Antioch]]. Like the Nestorian churches, schisms also occurred within the Syriac Orthodox Church.\n\nIn 1626 [[Jesuit]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] missionaries began to proselytize among the Syriac Orthodox faithful at [[Aleppo]], forming a larger pro-catholic movement within the Syriac Orthodox Church. So in 1662, when the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate had fallen vacant, the Catholic party was able to elect one of its own, [[Ignatius Andrew Akijan|Andrew Akijan]] as Patriarch of the Syriac Church. This provoked a split in the community, and after Akijan's death in 1677 two opposing patriarchs were elected, with one of those becoming the first Patriarch of the [[Syriac Catholic Church]]. This line of succession died out quickly, however, but in 1782 with the election of [[Ignatius Michael III Jarweh|Michael Jarweh]] as Patriarch the ''Ignatius'' line has been the head of the Syriac Catholic Church since then, and also has its base in [[Damascus]].\n\nSome Assyrians converted to [[Protestantism]] during the 20th century as well, forming the [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]] among others.\n\nTherefore, by the end of all the schisms which occurred, the Assyrian people are now followers of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Ancient Church of the East]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Syriac Catholic Church]], [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]]- in addition to even more sub churches which are located in India that are adherent to the mother sees in the Middle East.\n\n===Architecture===\n\n{{Main|Architecture of Mesopotamia}}\n\nAssyrian architecture, like that of Babylonia, was influenced by Sumero-Akkadian styles (and to some degree Mitanni), but early on developed its own distinctive style. Palaces sported colourful wall decorations, and seal-cutting (an art learned from [[Mittani]]) developed apace. Schools for scribes taught both the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of Akkadian, and Sumerian and Akkadian literary works were often copied with an Assyrian flavour.\n\nThe Assyrian dialect of Akkadian was used in legal, official, religious, and practical texts such as medicine or instructions on manufacturing items. During the 13th to 10th centuries, picture tales appeared as a new art form: a continuous series of images carved on square stone steles. Somewhat reminiscent of a comic book, these show events such as warfare or hunting, placed in order from the upper left to the lower right corner of the stele with captions written underneath them. These and the excellent cut seals show that Assyrian art was beginning to surpass that of Babylon. Architecture saw the introduction of a new style of [[ziggurat]], with two towers and colorful enameled tiles.\n\n===Arts and Sciences===\n\n{{Main|Art of Mesopotamia}}\n\n[[File:Transport of cedar Dur Sharrukin.jpg|thumb|Relief from Assyrian capital of [[Dur Sharrukin]], showing transport of Lebanese cedar (8th century BC)]]\nAssyrian art preserved to the present day predominantly dates to the Neo-Assyrian period. Art depicting battle scenes, and occasionally the impaling of whole villages in gory detail, was intended to show the power of the emperor, and was generally made for propaganda purposes. These stone reliefs lined the walls in the royal palaces where foreigners were received by the king. Other stone reliefs depict the king with different deities and conducting religious ceremonies. Many stone reliefs were discovered in the royal palaces at [[Nimrud]] (Kalhu) and [[Khorsabad]] (Dur-Sharrukin). A rare discovery of metal plates belonging to wooden doors was made at [[Balawat]] ([[Imgur-Enlil]]).\n\n[[File:S03 06 01 017 image 2350.jpg|thumb|upright|Assyria. Head of winged bull, 9th c. B.C.; Brooklyn Museum Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]\nAssyrian sculpture reached a high level of refinement in the Neo-Assyrian period. One prominent example is the winged bull [[lamassu]] or [[shedu]] that guard the entrances to the king's court. These were apotropaic meaning they were intended to ward off evil. C. W. Ceram states in ''The March of Archaeology'' that lamassi were typically sculpted with five legs so that four legs were always visible, whether the image were viewed frontally or in profile.\n\nAlthough works of precious gems and metals usually do not survive the ravages of time, some fine pieces of Assyrian jewelry were found in royal tombs at Nimrud.\n\nThere is ongoing discussion among academics over the nature of the [[Nimrud lens]], a piece of [[quartz]] unearthed by [[Austen Henry Layard]] in 1850, in the Nimrud palace complex in northern [[Iraq]]. A small minority believe that it is evidence for the existence of ancient Assyrian telescopes, which could explain the great accuracy of [[Assyrian astronomy]]. Other suggestions include its use as a magnifying glass for jewellers, or as a decorative furniture inlay. The Nimrud Lens is held in the British Museum.<ref name = \"Mu\u017feum\">[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=369215&partid=1 Lens], British Museum.</ref>\n\nThe Assyrians were also innovative in military technology, with the use of heavy cavalry, sappers and siege engines.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Main|Achaemenid Assyria|Assyriology|Assyrian nationalism}}\n[[File:Layard Nineveh.jpg|thumb|[[Austen Henry Layard]] in [[Nineveh]], 1852]]\n\n[[Achaemenid Assyria]] (539\u2013330 BC) retained a separate identity, official correspondence being in [[Imperial Aramaic]], and there was even a determined revolt of the two Assyrian provinces of Mada and Athura in 520 BC. Under Seleucid rule, however, Aramaic gave way to [[Greek language|Greek]] as the official administrative language. Aramaic was marginalised as an official language, but remained spoken in both Assyria and Babylonia by the general populace. It also remained the spoken tongue of the indigenous Assyrian/Babylonian citizens of all Mesopotamia under Persian, Greek and Roman rule, and indeed well into the Arab period it was still the language of the majority, particularly in the north of Mesopotamia, surviving to this day among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christians.\n\nBetween 150 BC and 226 AD, Assyria changed hands between the [[Parthian Empire]] and the Romans until coming under the rule of the [[Sasanian Empire]] from 226\u2013651, where it was known as [[As\u014drist\u0101n]].\n\nA number of at least partly neo-Assyrian kingdoms existed in the area between in the late classical and early Christian period also; [[Adiabene]], [[Hatra]] and [[Osroene]].\n\n[[Mesopotamia in Classical literature|Classical historiographers]] and Biblical writers had only retained a fragmented, very dim and often inaccurate picture of Assyria. It was remembered that there had been an Assyrian empire predating the Persian one, but all particulars were lost. Thus Jerome's ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' lists 36 kings of the Assyrians, beginning with [[Ninus]], son of [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]], down to [[Sardanapalus]], the last king of the Assyrians before the empire fell to [[Arbaces]] the Median. Almost none of these have been substantiated as historical, with the exception of the Neo-Assyrian and Babylonian rulers listed in the ''[[Canon of Kings]]'', beginning with [[Nabonassar]].\n\nThe Assyrians began to form and adopt a distinct [[Eastern Christianity]], with its accompanying [[Syriac literature]], between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD; however, [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]] was still alive and well into the fourth century and pockets survived into the 10th century and possibly as late as the 17th century in [[Mardin]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/faq.html|title=Assyrians: Frequently Asked Questions|website=www.aina.org|access-date=2017-03-15}}</ref> However, the religion is now dead, and the Assyrian people, though still retaining Eastern Aramaic dialects as a mother tongue, are now wholly Christian.\n\nThe [[Modern discovery of Babylonia and Assyria|modern discovery of Babylonia and Assyria]] begins with excavations in [[Nineveh]] in 1845, which revealed the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]]. Decipherment of the [[cuneiform script]] was a formidable task that took more than a decade; but, by 1857, the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]] was convinced that reliable reading of cuneiform texts was possible. [[Assyriology]] has since pieced together the formerly largely forgotten history of Mesopotamia. In the wake of the archaeological and philological rediscovery of ancient Assyria, [[Assyrian nationalism]] became increasingly popular among the surviving remnants of the [[Assyrian people]], who have come to strongly identify with ancient Assyria.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Assyrians|Ancient Near East}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Achaemenid Assyria]]\n* [[Ancient Church of the East]]\n* [[Assur]]\n* [[Assuristan]]\n* [[Assyrian Christians]]\n* [[Assyrian Church of the East]]\n* [[Assyrian culture]]\n* [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]]\n* [[Assyrian Genocide]]\n* [[Assyrian nationalism]]\n* [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]]\n* [[Assyrian people]]\n* [[Assyrian struggle for independence]]\n* [[Babylonia]]\n* [[Chaldea]]\n* [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]\n* [[Church of the East]]\n* [[Eastern Aramaic]]\n* [[List of Assyrians]]\n* [[Mesopotamian religion]]\n* [[Name of Syria]]\n* [[Syriac language]]\n* [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2 |year=1911 |wstitle=Tiglath-Pileser |volume=26 |page=968 }}\n* {{citation |last=Parpola |first=Simo |author-link=Simo Parpola |date=2004 |contribution=National and Ethnic Identity in the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Assyrian Identity in Post-Empire Times |title=[[Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies]] |volume=Vol. 18 |issue=No. 2 |contribution-url = http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf }}\n* {{citation |last=Roux |first=Georges |date=1964 |title=Ancient Iraq |location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=0-14-012523-X }}\n* {{citation |last=Saggs |first=H.

Aphasia does not refer to damage to the brain that results in motor or sensory deficits, which produces [[dysarthria|abnormal speech]]; that is, aphasia is not related to the mechanics of [[speech]] but rather the individual's language cognition (although a person can have both problems). An individual's \"language\" is the socially shared set of rules as well as the thought processes that go behind verbalized speech. It is not a result of a more peripheral motor or sensory difficulty, such as [[paralysis]] affecting the speech muscles or a general hearing impairment.\n\nAphasia affects about 2 million people in the US and 250,000 people in Great Britain.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Though nearly 180,000 people in the US acquire the disorder a year, 84.5% of people have never heard of the condition.<ref>{{cite web |title=Aphasia Fact sheet - National Aphasia Association |url=http://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-resources/aphasia-factsheet/ |website=National Aphasia Association|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nPeople with aphasia may experience any of the following behaviors due to an acquired brain injury, although some of these symptoms may be due to related or concomitant problems such as [[dysarthria]] or [[apraxia]] and not primarily due to aphasia.

It is characterized by a gradual loss in language functioning while other cognitive domains are mostly preserved, such as memory and personality. PPA usually initiates with sudden word-finding difficulties in an individual and progresses to a reduced ability to formulate grammatically correct sentences (syntax) and impaired comprehension. The etiology of PPA is not due to a stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or infectious disease; it is still uncertain what initiates the onset of PPA in those affected by it.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Primary Progressive Aphasia|url = http://www.asha.org/Glossary/Primary-Progressive-Aphasia/|website = www.asha.org|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}</ref>\n\n[[Epilepsy]] can also include transient aphasia as a [[prodromal]] or episodic symptom.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Blumenfeld|first1=H|last2=Meador|first2=KJ|title=Consciousness as a useful concept in epilepsy classification.|journal=Epilepsia|date=August 2014|volume=55|issue=8|pages=1145\u201350|doi=10.1111/epi.12588|pmid=24981294|pmc=4149314}}</ref> Aphasia is also listed as a rare side-effect of the [[fentanyl]] patch, an opioid used to control chronic pain.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.drugs.com/pro/fentanyl-transdermal.html#A02A9CB6-35CF-4F01-A980-C3733E0F861A |title=Fentanyl Transdermal Official FDA information, side effects and uses |format= |work=Drug Information Online |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nAphasia is best thought of as a collection of different disorders, rather than a single problem. Each individual with aphasia will present with their own particular combination of language strengths and weaknesses. Consequently, it is a major challenge just to document the various difficulties that can occur in different people, let alone decide how they might best be treated. Most classifications of the aphasias tend to divide the various symptoms into broad classes. A common approach is to distinguish between the fluent aphasias (where speech remains fluent, but content may be lacking, and the person may have difficulties understanding others), and the nonfluent aphasias (where speech is very halting and effortful, and may consist of just one or two words at a time).\n\nHowever, no such broad-based grouping has proven fully adequate. There is wide variation among people even within the same broad grouping, and aphasias can be highly selective. For instance, people with naming deficits (anomic aphasia) might show an inability only for naming buildings, or people, or colors.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Kolb, Bryan |author2=Whishaw, Ian Q. |title=Fundamentals of human neuropsychology |publisher=Worth |location=[New York] |year=2003 |pages= 502, 505, 511|isbn=0-7167-5300-6 |oclc=464808209 }}</ref>\n\nIt is important to note that there are typical difficulties with speech and language that come with normal aging as well.  As we age language can become more difficult to process resulting in a slowing of verbal comprehension, reading abilities and more likely word finding difficulties.

Although fluent, the speech may lack in key substantive words (nouns, verbs, adjectives), and may contain incorrect words or even nonsense words. This subtype has been associated with damage to the posterior left temporal cortex, most notably Wernicke's area. These individuals usually have no body weakness, because their brain injury is not near the parts of the brain that control movement.\n* [[Conduction aphasia]], where speech remains fluent, and comprehension is preserved, but the person may have disproportionate difficulty where repeating words or sentences.

These schemes also identify several further aphasia subtypes, including: [[anomic aphasia]], which is characterized by a selective difficulty finding the names for things; and [[global aphasia]], where both expression and comprehension of speech are severely compromised.\n\nMany localizationist approaches also recognize the existence of additional, more \"pure\" forms of language disorder that may affect only a single language skill.<ref name=\"KolbWhishaw1\">{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of human neuropsychology|author1=Kolb, Bryan|author2=Whishaw, Ian Q.|publisher=Worth|year=2003|isbn=0-7167-5300-6|location=[New York]|pages=502\u2013504|oclc=464808209}}<!-- The whole paragraph \"fluent, non-fluent and pure aphasias\" is written with help of this reference.--></ref> For example, in [[pure alexia]], a person may be able to write but not read, and in [[pure word deafness]], they may be able to produce speech and to read, but not understand speech when it is spoken to them.\n\n===Cognitive neuropsychological approaches===\nAlthough localizationist approaches provide a useful way of classifying the different patterns of language difficulty into broad groups, one problem is that a sizeable number of individuals do not fit neatly into one category or another.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Godefroy O. |author2=Dubois C. |author3=Debachy B. |author4=Leclerc M. |author5=Kreisler A. | year = 2002 | title = Vascular aphasias: main characteristics of patients hospitalized in acute stroke units | url = | journal = Stroke | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 702\u2013705 | doi=10.1161/hs0302.103653}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Ross K.B. |author2=Wertz R.T. | year = 2001 | title = Type and severity of aphasia during the first seven months poststroke | url = | journal = Journal of Medical Speech-Language Pathology | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 31\u201353 }}</ref> Another problem is that the categories, particularly the major ones such as Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, still remain quite broad. Consequently, even amongst individuals who meet the criteria for classification into a subtype, there can be enormous variability in the types of difficulties they experience.\n\nInstead of categorizing every individual into a specific subtype, cognitive neuropsychological approaches aim to identify the key language skills or \"modules\" that are not functioning properly in each individual. A person could potentially have difficulty with just one module, or with a number of modules. This type of approach requires a framework or theory as to what skills/modules are needed to perform different kinds of language tasks. For example, the model of [[Max Coltheart]] identifies a module that recognizes [[phonemes]] as they are spoken, which is essential for any task involving recognition of words. Similarly, there is a module that stores phonemes that the person is planning to produce in speech, and this module is critical for any task involving the production of long words or long strings of speech. Once a theoretical framework has been established, the functioning of each module can then be assessed using a specific test or set of tests. In the clinical setting, use of this model usually involves conducting a battery of assessments,<ref>{{cite book |author1=Coltheart, Max |author2=Kay, Janice |author3=Lesser, Ruth |title=PALPA psycholinguistic assessments of language processing in aphasia |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=0-86377-166-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>Porter, G., & Howard, D.

Gradual loss of language function occurs in the context of relatively well-preserved memory, visual processing, and personality until the advanced stages. Symptoms usually begin with word-finding problems (naming) and progress to impaired grammar (syntax) and comprehension (sentence processing and semantics).<American Speech-Language-Hearing Association> The loss of language before the loss of memory differentiates PPA from typical dementias. People suffering from PPA may have difficulties comprehending what others are saying. They can also have difficulty trying to find the right words to make a sentence.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mesulam MM |title=Primary progressive aphasia |journal=Ann.

Speech is fluent and effortless with intact [[syntax]] and [[grammar]], but the person has problems with the selection of [[noun]]s. Either they will replace the desired word with another that sounds or looks like the original one or has some other connection or they will replace it with [[sound]]s. As such, people with jargon aphasia often use [[neologism]]s, and may [[perseveration|perseverate]] if they try to replace the words they cannot find with sounds. Substitutions commonly involve picking another (actual) word starting with the same sound (e.g., clocktower - colander), picking another semantically related to the first (e.g., letter - scroll), or picking one phonetically similar to the intended one (e.g., lane - late).\n\n===Deaf aphasia===\nThere have been many instances showing that there is a form of aphasia among deaf individuals. Sign languages are, after all, forms of language that have been shown to use the same areas of the brain as verbal forms of language. Mirror neurons become activated when an animal is acting in a particular way or watching another individual act in the same manner. These mirror neurons are important in giving an individual the ability to mimic movements of hands. Broca's area of speech production has been shown to contain several of these mirror neurons resulting in significant similarities of brain activity between sign language and vocal speech communication. Facial communication is a significant portion of how animals interact with each other. Humans use facial movements to create, what other humans perceive, to be faces of emotions. While combining these facial movements with speech, a more full form of language is created which enables the species to interact with a much more complex and detailed form of communication. Sign language also uses these facial movements and emotions along with the primary hand movement way of communicating. These facial movement forms of communication come from the same areas of the brain. When dealing with damages to certain areas of the brain, vocal forms of communication are in jeopardy of severe forms of aphasia. Since these same areas of the brain are being used for sign language, these same, at least very similar, forms of aphasia can show in the Deaf community. Individuals can show a form of Wernicke's aphasia with sign language and they show deficits in their abilities in being able to produce any form of expressions. Broca's aphasia shows up in some people, as well. These individuals find tremendous difficulty in being able to actually sign the linguistic concepts they are trying to express.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil|title=Physiology of Behavior|year=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=New York|pages=494\u2013496}}</ref>\n\n=== Severity ===\nThe severity of the type of aphasia varies depending on the size of the stroke. However, there is much variance between how often one type of severity occurs in certain types of aphasia. &nbsp;For instance, any type of aphasia can range from mild to profound. Regardless of the severity of aphasia, people can make improvements due to spontaneous recovery and treatment in the acute stages of recovery.<ref name=\":5\" /> Klebic et al. (2011) found that people with severe aphasia improved after receiving therapy for a year, consequently reducing the severity of their aphasia.<ref name=\":4\" /> Additionally, while most studies propose that the greatest outcomes occur in people with severe aphasia when treatment is provided in the acute stages of recovery, Robey (1998) also found that those with severe aphasia are capable of making strong language gains in the chronic stage of recovery as well.<ref name=\":5\" /> This finding implies that persons with aphasia have the potential to have functional outcomes regardless of how severe their aphasia may be.<ref name=\":5\" /> While there is no distinct pattern of the outcomes of aphasia based on severity alone, global aphasia typically makes functional language gains, but may be gradual since global aphasia affects many language areas.\n\n==Prevention==\nFollowing are some precautions that should be taken to avoid aphasia, by decreasing the risk of stroke, the main cause of aphasia:\n* Exercising regularly\n* Eating a healthy diet\n* Keeping alcohol consumption low and avoiding tobacco use\n* Controlling blood pressure<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Management==\n\nWhen addressing Wernicke\u2019s aphasia, according to Bakheit et al.

With this said, people with global aphasia may retain gestural communication skills that may enable success when communicating with conversational partners within familiar conditions. Process-oriented treatment options are limited, and people may not become competent language users as readers, listeners, writers, or speakers no matter how extensive therapy is.<ref name=\"Brookshire 2007\" /> However, people\u2019s daily routines and quality of life can be enhanced with reasonable and modest goals.<ref name=\"Brookshire 2007\" />  After the first month, there is limited to no healing to language abilities of most people. There is a grim prognosis leaving 83% who were globally aphasic after the first month they will remain globally aphasic at the first year. Some people are so severely impaired that their existing process-oriented treatment approaches offer signs of progress, and therefore cannot justify the cost of therapy.<ref name=\"Brookshire 2007\" />\n\nPerhaps due to the relative rareness of conduction aphasia, few studies have specifically studied the effectiveness of therapy for people with this type of aphasia. From the studies performed, results showed that therapy can help to improve specific language outcomes. One intervention that has had positive results is auditory repetition training. Kohn et al. (1990) reported that drilled auditory repetition training related to improvements in spontaneous speech, Francis et al. (2003) reported improvements in sentence comprehension, and Kalinyak-Fliszar et al.

Recovery and improvement can continue for years after the stroke. After the onset of Aphasia, there is approximately a six-month period of spontaneous recovery; during this time, the brain is attempting to recover and repair the damaged neurons. Improvement varies widely, depending on the aphasia's cause, type, and severity. Recovery also depends on the person's age, health, motivation, [[handedness]], and educational level.<ref name = \"medicinenet.com\" />\n\nThere is no one treatment proven to be effective for all types of aphasias. The reason that there is no universal treatment for aphasia is because of the nature of the disorder and the various ways it is presented, as explained in the above sections. Aphasia is rarely exhibited identically, implying that treatment needs to be catered specifically to the individual.

This will help researchers to understand exactly what the brain must go through in order to recover from Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and how different areas of the brain respond after such an injury.\n\nAnother intriguing approach being tested is that of drug therapy. Research is in progress that will hopefully uncover whether or not certain drugs might be used in addition to speech-language therapy in order to facilitate recovery of proper language function. It\u2019s possible that the best treatment for Aphasia might involve combining drug treatment with therapy, instead of relying on one over the other.\n\nOne other method being researched as a potential therapeutic combination with speech-language therapy is brain stimulation. One particular method, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), alters brain activity in whatever area it happens to stimulate, which has recently led scientists to wonder if this shift in brain function caused by TMS might help people re-learn languages.\n\nThe research being put into Aphasia has only just begun. Researchers appear to have multiple ideas on how Aphasia could be more effectively treated in the future. {{cite web |url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/aphasia |title=Aphasia |website=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders |access-date=December 16, 2017}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Agnosia]]\n* [[Aphasiology]]\n* [[Apraxia of speech]]\n* [[Aprosodia]]\n* [[Auditory processing disorder]]\n* [[Lethologica]]\n* [[Lists of language disorders]]\n*''[[My Beautiful Broken Brain]]''\n* [[Origin of speech]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|   DiseasesDB     = 4024\n|   ICD10          = {{ICD10|F|80|1|f|80}}, {{ICD10|F|80|2|f|80}}, {{ICD10|R|47|0|r|47}}\n|   ICD9           = {{ICD9|315.31}}, {{ICD9|315.32}}, {{ICD9|784.3}}, {{ICD9|438.11}}\n|   ICDO           =\n|   OMIM           =\n|   MedlinePlus    = 003204\n|   eMedicineSubj  = neuro\n|   eMedicineTopic = 437\n|   MeshID         = D001037\n}}\n{{Library resources box|by=no|onlinebooks=no|about=yes|wikititle=aphasia}}\n{{Wiktionary|aphasia|aphemia}}\n* {{DMOZ|Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Communication_Disorders/Language_and_Speech/Aphasia/}}\n<!-- navigation boxes listed below-->\n{{Navboxes\n|title= [[File:Nuvola apps kpdf2.png|25px]] Topics related to Aphasia\n|state=off\n|list=\n{{Speech and voice symptoms and signs}}\n{{Lesions of spinal cord and brain}}\n{{Dyslexia}}\n{{CNS diseases of the nervous system}}\n<!-- add new navigation boxes above here -->\n}}\n\n<!-- categories listed below -->\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Aphasias| ]]\n[[Category:Alexia (condition)]]\n[[Category:Communication disorders]]\n[[Category:Language disorders]]\n[[Category:Symptoms and signs: Speech and voice]]", "sha1": "swzrmy8lrsisazilgxny9v6nsm1i0y1"}}, {"title": "Aorta", "ns": "0", "id": "2089", "revision": {"id": "854915955", "parentid": "854913329", "timestamp": "2018-08-14T17:31:58Z", "contributor": {"ip": "31.52.113.206"}, "comment": "/* History */ el is Modern Greek", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{for|the American band|Aorta (band)}}\n{{Anatomy terms}}\n{{Infobox artery\n| Name        = Aorta\n| Latin       = Aorta, arteria maxima\n| Image       = File:Aorta segments.jpg\n| Width       = \n| Caption     = Schematic view of the aorta and its segments\n| Image2      = File:Aorta branches.jpg\n| Width2      = \n| Caption2    = Branches of the aorta\n| BranchFrom  = [[Ventricle (heart)|Left ventricle]]\n| BranchTo    = Ascending aorta:\n:[[Right coronary artery|Right]] and [[Left coronary artery|left]] coronary arteries.\nArch of aorta (supra-aortic vessels):\n:[[Brachiocephalic artery|Brachiocephalic trunk]]\n:[[Common carotid artery|Left common carotid artery]]\n:[[Subclavian artery|Left subclavian artery]]\nDescending aorta, thoracic part:\n:[[Bronchial arteries|Left bronchial arteries]]\n:[[Esophageal branches of thoracic part of aorta|esophageal arteries]] to the thoracic part of the [[esophagus]]\n:Third to eleventh [[Posterior intercostal arteries]], and the [[Subcostal arteries]]\nDescending aorta, abdominal part:\n:Parietal branches:\n:[[Inferior phrenic arteries]]\n:[[Lumbar arteries]]\n:[[Median sacral artery]]\n:Visceral branches:\n:[[Celiac trunk]]\n:[[Middle suprarenal arteries]]\n:[[Superior mesenteric artery]]\n:[[Renal arteries]]\n:[[Gonadal artery|Gonadal arteries]] [[Testicular artery|testicular]] in males, [[Ovarian artery|ovarian]] in females\n:[[Inferior mesenteric artery]]\nTerminal branches:\n:[[Common iliac arteries]]\n:[[Median sacral artery]]\n| Vein        = Combination of [[coronary sinus]], [[superior vena cava]] and [[inferior vena cava]]\n| Precursor   = [[Truncus arteriosus (embryology)|Truncus arteriosus]] [[Aortic arches|Fourth left branchial artery]] [[Dorsal aorta|Paired dorsal aortae]] (combine into the single descending aorta)\n| Supplies    = The [[systemic circulation]]<br />(entire body with exception of the respiratory zone of the [[Human lung|lung]] which is supplied by the [[pulmonary circulation]])\n| Pronunciation = {{IPAc-en|e\u026a|\u02c8|\u0254r|t|\u0259}}\n}}\n\nThe '''aorta''' ({{IPAc-en|e\u026a|\u02c8|\u0254r|t|\u0259}} {{respell|ay|OR|t\u0259}}) is the main [[artery]] in the [[human body]], originating from the [[Ventricle (heart)|left ventricle]] of the [[heart]] and extending down to the [[abdomen]], where it [[aortic bifurcation|splits]] into two smaller arteries (the [[common iliac artery|common iliac arteries]]).

Broadly speaking, branches from the ascending aorta supply the heart; branches from the aortic arch supply the head, neck and arms; branches from the thoracic descending aorta supply the chest (excluding the heart and the respiratory zone of the lung); and branches from the abdominal aorta supply the [[abdomen]].

Measuring the pulse wave velocity (invasively and non-invasively) is a means of determining [[arterial stiffness]]. Maximum aortic velocity may be noted as '''V<sub>max</sub>''' or less commonly as '''AoV<sub>max</sub>'''.\n\n[[Mean arterial pressure]] (MAP) is highest in the aorta and the MAP decreases across the circulation from aorta to arteries to arterioles to capillaries to veins back to atrium. The difference between aortic and right atrial pressure accounts for blood flow in the circulation.<ref>Nichols WW, O'Rourke MF. McDonald's Blood Flow in Arteries: Theoretical, Experimental and Clinical Principles. 4th ed. London, UK: Edward Arnold; 1998</ref> When the left ventricle contracts to force blood into the aorta, the aorta expands. This stretching gives the potential energy that will help maintain blood pressure during [[diastole]], as during this time the aorta contracts passively. This [[Windkessel effect]] of the great elastic arteries has important biomechanical implications. The elastic recoil helps conserve the energy from the pumping heart and smooth out the pulsatile nature created by the heart. Aortic pressure is highest at the aorta and becomes less pulsatile and lower pressure as blood vessels divide into arteries, arterioles, and capillaries such that flow is slow and smooth for gases and nutrient exchange.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n* [[Aortic aneurysm]] \u2013 mycotic, bacterial (e.g. [[syphilis]]), senile, genetic, associated with [[valvular heart disease]]\n* [[Aortic coarctation]] \u2013 pre-[[ductus arteriosus|ductal]], post-ductal\n* [[Aortic dissection]]\n* [[Aortic stenosis]]\n* [[Aortitis]], inflammation of the aorta that can be seen in trauma, infections, and autoimmune disease\n* [[Atherosclerosis]]\n* [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]]\n* [[Marfan syndrome]]\n* [[Physical trauma|Trauma]], such as [[traumatic aortic rupture]], most often thoracic and distal to the left subclavian artery<ref>Samett EJ.\n[http://www.emedicine.com/radio/topic44.htm http://www.emedicine.com/radio/topic44.htm Aorta, Trauma]. eMedicine.com.

The '''ventral aorta''' carries de-oxygenated blood from the heart to the [[gill]]s; part of this vessel forms the ascending aorta in tetrapods (the remainder forms the [[pulmonary artery]]). A second, '''dorsal aorta''' carries oxygenated blood from the gills to the rest of the body, and is [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] with the descending aorta of tetrapods.

It supersedes [[Integer BASIC]] and is the BASIC in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] in all Apple II series computers after the original [[Apple II#Apple II|Apple II]] model. It is also referred to as '''FP BASIC''' (from \"[[floating point]]\") because of the [[Apple DOS]] command used to invoke it, instead of <code>INT</code> for Integer BASIC.\n\nApplesoft BASIC was supplied by [[Microsoft]] and its name is derived from the names of both [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Microsoft]]. Apple employees, including [[Randy Wigginton]], adapted Microsoft's interpreter for the Apple II and added several features. The first version of Applesoft was released in 1977 on [[cassette tape]] and lacked proper support for high-resolution graphics. '''Applesoft II''', which was made available on cassette and disk and in the ROM of the Apple II Plus and subsequent models, was released in 1978. It is this latter version, which has some syntax differences and support for the Apple II high-resolution graphics modes, that is usually synonymous with the term \"Applesoft.\"\n\n==History==\nWhen [[Steve Wozniak]] wrote [[Integer BASIC]] for the [[Apple II]], he did not implement support for [[floating point]] math because he was primarily interested in writing games, a task for which integers alone were sufficient.<ref name=\"wozniak20140501\">{{cite web | url=https://gizmodo.com/how-steve-wozniak-wrote-basic-for-the-original-apple-fr-1570573636 | title=How Steve Wozniak Wrote BASIC for the Original Apple From Scratch | publisher=Gizmodo | date=2014-05-01 | accessdate=2 May 2014 | author=Wozniak, Steve}}</ref> In 1976, Microsoft had developed [[Microsoft BASIC]], a BASIC interpreter for the [[MOS Technology 6502]], but at the time there was no production computer that used it. Upon learning that Apple had a 6502 machine, Microsoft asked if the company were interested in licensing BASIC, but [[Steve Jobs]] replied that Apple already had one.\n\nThe Apple II was unveiled to the public at the [[West Coast Computer Faire]] in April 1977 and became available for sale in June. One of the most common customer complaints about the computer was BASIC's lack of floating-point capability.{{fact|date=July 2018}} Integer BASIC is limited to whole numbers between \u221232768 and 32767 and caused problems for users attempting to write business applications with it. Steve Wozniak had never added floating point capabilities to Integer BASIC as he did not consider them necessary for gaming and educational software, the two primary tasks he envisioned for the Apple II. As Wozniak\u2014the only person who understood Integer BASIC well enough to add floating point features\u2014was busy with the [[Disk II]] drive and controller and with [[Apple DOS]], Apple turned to Microsoft. Making things more problematic was that the rival [[Commodore PET]] personal computer had a floating point-capable BASIC interpreter from the beginning. The Applesoft license also saved Microsoft from near-bankruptcy when they licensed BASIC to Commodore for the PET in an agreement that proved unexpectedly costly for them.\n\nApple reportedly obtained an eight-year license for Applesoft BASIC from Microsoft for a flat fee of $31,000, renewing it in 1985 through an arrangement that gave Microsoft the rights and source code for Apple's [[MacBASIC|Macintosh version of BASIC]].<ref>Herzfeld, Andy \"MacBasic \u2013 The Sad Story of MacBasic\". http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=MacBasic.txt . Folklore.org. 2014 February 12</ref> Applesoft was designed to be backwards-compatible with Integer BASIC and uses the core of Microsoft's 6502 BASIC implementation, which includes using the GET command for detecting key presses and not requiring any spaces on program lines. While Applesoft BASIC is slower than Integer BASIC, it has many features that the older BASIC lacks:\n* Atomic strings: A string is no longer an array of characters (as in Integer BASIC and [[C (programming language)|C]]); it is instead a [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage-collected]] object (as in [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]). This allows for string arrays; <code>DIM A$(10)</code> resulted in a [[Array data type|vector]] of ''eleven'' string variables numbered 0\u201310.\n* Multidimensional [[Array data type|arrays]] (numbers or strings)\n* Single-precision [[floating point]] variables with an 8-bit exponent and a 31-bit significand and improved math capabilities, including trigonometry and logarithmic functions\n* Commands for high-resolution graphics\n* <code>DATA</code> statements, with <code>READ</code> and <code>RESTORE</code> commands, for representing numerical and string values in quantity\n* <code>CHR$</code>, <code>STR$</code>, and <code>VAL</code> functions for converting between string and numeric types (both languages did have the <code>ASC</code> function)\n* [[User-defined function]]s: simple one-line functions written in BASIC, with a single parameter\n* Error-trapping, allowing BASIC programs to handle unexpected errors by means of a subroutine written in BASIC\nConversely, Applesoft lacked the <code>MOD</code> (remainder) operator that had been present in Integer BASIC.\n\nAdapting BASIC for the Apple II was a tedious job as Apple received a source listing for Microsoft 6502 BASIC which proved to be extremely buggy{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} and also required the addition of Integer BASIC commands. Since Apple had no 6502 assembler on hand, the development team was forced to send the source code over the phone lines to Call Computer, an outfit that offered compiler services. This was an extremely tedious, slow process and after Call Computer lost the source code due to an equipment malfunction, one of the programmers, Cliff Huston, used his own IMSAI 8080 computer to cross assemble the BASIC source.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah16/|title=History of the Apple II - Chapter 16 - Languages|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\nApplesoft is similar to Commodore's BASIC 2.0 aside from features inherited from Integer BASIC. There are a few minor differences such as Applesoft's lack of bitwise operators; otherwise most BASIC programs that do not utilize hardware-dependent features will run on both BASICs.\n\nThe PR# statement is used to redirect output to an expansion card, and IN# is used to redirect input from an expansion card. The slot number of the card is specified after the PR# or IN# statement. The computer will lock up if there is no card present in the slot and require a reboot. PR#0 will restore output to the 40 column screen and IN#0 to the keyboard.\n\nThere is no dedicated command in Applesoft BASIC for printer output. To send a string to the printer, the PR# statement can be used to redirect output to the printer (eg. 10 PR#x:PRINT\"Hello!\") where x is the slot number containing the printer port card. To send a BASIC program listing to the printer, the user would type PR#x:LIST. After outputting to the printer, it is necessary to execute a PR#0 statement to reset output to the screen.\n\nPR#6 will cause Applesoft to boot the disk drives (although the Disk II controller can be in any slot, it is usually in slot 6). PR#3 will switch to 80 column text mode if an 80 column card is present. 80 column cards also add 12 new control codes that can be displayed with the CHR$ function. Enhanced Apple IIe and IIc models with the MouseText character set include another two control codes to enable and disable it.\n\nAs with Commodore BASIC, Applesoft handles numeric variables as 40-bit floating point, thus each variable requires five bytes of memory, and the programmer may also designate variables as integer by following them with a percent sign, in which case they use two bytes and are limited to a range of -32767 to 32768, however BASIC internally converts them back to floating point, which slows down program execution and each percent sign also takes an additional byte, so in practice this feature is only useful for reducing the memory usage of large array variables.\n\nThe RND function generates a fractional number between 0 and 1. In Applesoft BASIC, if RND(0) is executed, the most recently generated random number is produced. RND with a negative number will jump to a point in the sequence determined by the particular negative number used. RND with a value of 1 or greater will generate a new random number. Random numbers are generated via a hash stored in $4E-$4F, and thus are not truly random.\n\nLike with other implementations of Microsoft BASIC, Applesoft does not require any spaces on a program line and if the user types them, they are discarded by the interpreter during the process of tokenizing program lines, whereas Commodore BASIC did not delete spaces. LISTing programs will however still display spaces for readability purposes.\n\nThe INPUT statement in Applesoft BASIC does not display a question mark with its prompt if a message is displayed with it, and the PRINT statement does not add a leading space in front of numbers.\n\n[[Coleco]] claimed that its [[Coleco Adam|Adam]] home computer's SmartBASIC was source-code compatible with Applesoft.<ref name=\"coleco19830928\">{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg_I9TGYM-w |title=Coleco Presents The Adam Computer System |date=2016-05-03 |publisher=YouTube |orig-year=1983-09-28 |time=31:55 |quote=Everybody who knows Applesoft BASIC will also know Adam SmartBASIC.

(Thus, Applesoft can display lowercase letters, but cannot recognize them as part of a program; thus, <code>PRINT</code> is a valid command but <code>print</code> and <code>Print</code> are unrecognizable and result in a syntax error.)\n\nApplesoft lacks several commands and functions common to most of the non-6502 Microsoft BASIC interpreters, such as:\n* <code>INSTR</code> (search for a substring in a given string)\n* <code>PRINT USING</code> (formatting numbers in printed output)\n* <code>INKEY$</code> (check for a keypress without stopping the program) although a PEEK location did provide this functionality.\n* <code>LPRINT</code> (output printed content to a printer instead of the screen)\n\nApplesoft, like Integer BASIC before it, does not come with any built-in commands for file or disk handling, other than a feature to save programs to, and load programs from, cassette tape. The Apple II disk operating system, known simply as DOS, augments the language to provide such abilities.\n\nUnlike in Integer BASIC, Applesoft BASIC variable names are significant only to two letters; they can be made longer, but only the first two letters are used. For instance, \"LOW\" and \"LOSS\" are treated as the same variable, and attempting to assign a value to \"LOSS\" overwrites any value assigned to \"LOW\". Furthermore, because the language used [[Tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenization]], a programmer has to avoid using any consecutive letters that are also Applesoft commands or operations (one cannot use the name \"SCORE\" for a variable because it interprets the OR as a Boolean operator, thus rendering it SC OR E, nor can one use \"BACKGROUND\" because the command \"GR\" invokes the low-resolution graphics mode, in this case creating a syntax error).\n\n===Sound and graphics===\nThere is no sound support\u2013aside from a <code>[[PEEK and POKE|PEEK]]</code> command that can be used to click the speaker. One can also <code>PRINT</code> an ASCII [[bell character]] to sound the system alert [[beep (sound)|beep]]. The language is not fast enough to produce more than a baritone buzz from repeated clicks.\n\nVector-based [[shape table]]s can be used to draw objects, but are slow in comparison to routines that draw bitmaps directly. They also only support horizontal and vertical lines. Diagonals and curves are not supported. No provision existed for mixing text and graphics, except for the limited \"hardware split screen\" of the Apple II (four lines of text at the bottom of the screen).\n\n===Extensions===\nApplesoft BASIC can be extended by two means: the ampersand (&amp;) command and the USR() function. These are two features that called machine-language routines stored in memory. Routines that need to be fast or require direct access to arbitrary functions or data in memory can thus be called from a higher-level interpreted BASIC program. The USR() function takes one numerical argument, and can be programmed to derive and return a calculated function value, to be used in a numerical expression. \"&\" was effectively a shorthand for CALL, with an address that would be predefined.\n\n===Bugs===\nA deficiency in Applesoft's error-trapping with ONERR means that the system stack would not be reset if an error-handling routine did not invoke RESUME, potentially leading to a crash. Error-handling that does not employ RESUME can avoid the problem with a CALL -3288 or (equivalent) 62248 before exiting the routine.<ref name=\"ManualIIe\">Applesoft BASIC Programmer's Reference Manual (for IIe only), Apple Computer, Inc., 1982</ref>\n\n===Performance===\nWhereas Wozniak originally referred to his Integer BASIC as \"Game BASIC\" (having written it so he could write a [[Breakout clone]] for his new computer),<ref name=\"wozniak20140501\" /> few [[action game]]s were written in Applesoft BASIC.\n\nThe use of \"real\" (floating-point) numbers for all math operations degraded performance. Although a <code>%</code> can be placed after a variable to mark it as integer, its value is merely converted back into single-precision, slowing down program execution and wasting memory (as each \"%\" required one extra byte of memory). The integer variable type on Microsoft 6502 BASIC was really only designed for arrays because each element would take two bytes (versus, in the case of Applesoft, five for floating-point).\n\nApplesoft BASIC programs are stored as a [[linked list]] of lines; a <code>[[GOTO]]</code> or <code>[[GOSUB]]</code> takes [[Computational complexity theory|linear time]]. Large programs were often written with the most-used subroutines at the top of the program to reduce the processing time for <code>GOSUB</code> calls.\n\n==Sample code==\n[[File:Applesoft BASIC.png|thumb|[[Hello World]], with [[inverse video]] and [[bell character]], run then listed]]\n[[Hello World]] in Applesoft BASIC can be entered as the following:\n<source lang=\"basic\">\n 10TEXT:HOME\n 20?\"HELLO WORLD\"\n</source>\nMultiple commands can be included on the same line of code if separated by a colon (<code>:</code>). The <code>?</code> can be used in Applesoft BASIC (and almost all versions of Microsoft BASIC) as a shortcut for \"PRINT\", though spelling out the word is not only acceptable but canonical\u2014Applesoft converted \"?\" in entered programs to the same token as \"PRINT\" (thus no memory is actually saved by using \"?\"), thus either appears as \"PRINT\" when a program is listed. The program above appears in a <code>LIST</code> command as:\n<source lang=\"basic\">\n 10  TEXT : HOME\n 20  PRINT \"HELLO WORLD\"\n</source>\n<ref>This article includes text from [http://everything2.com/?node=Applesoft+BASIC Everything2], licensed under GFDL.</ref>\n\nWhen Applesoft II BASIC was initially released in mid-1978, it came on cassette tape and could be loaded into memory via the Apple II's machine language monitor. When the enhanced Apple II+ replaced the original II in 1979, Applesoft was now included in ROM and automatically started on power-up if no bootable floppy disk was present. Conversely, Integer BASIC was now removed from ROM and turned into an executable file on the DOS 3.3 disk.\n\n==Early evolution==\nThe original Applesoft, stored in RAM as documented in its Reference Manual of November 1977, has smaller interpreter code than the later Applesoft II, occupying 8\u00bd kb of memory,<ref>Applesoft Extended Precision Floating Point Basic Language Reference Manual, Apple Computer, Inc., November 1977</ref> instead of the 10 kb used by the later Applesoft II. Consequently, it lacks a number of command features developed for the later, mainstream version:\n* All commands supporting Apple's \"high resolution\" graphics (9 total)\n* Error-trapping with ONERR...GOTO and RESUME\n* Machine-routine shorthand call \"&\"\n* Screen-clearing HOME (a call to a system ROM routine)\n* Text-output control NORMAL, INVERSE, FLASH and SPEED=\n* The print-space function SPC() is listed among reserved words in the manual, but is not otherwise documented (the TAB() print-function ''is'' documented)\n* Cassette tape storage of numerical arrays: STORE and RECALL\n* Device response: WAIT\nas well as several the later version would have, that had already been present in Apple's Integer BASIC:\n* Program-line deletion: DEL\n* Machine-routine access: CALL\n* Peripheral device access: IN# and PR# (although IN without \"#\" is listed among reserved words)\n* Memory range control: HIMEM: and LOMEM:\n* Execution tracking for debugging: TRACE and NOTRACE\n* Screen-positioning: HTAB and VTAB\n* Subroutine aborting POP\n* Functions PDL() to read the analog controllers, and SCRN() to read the low-resolution graphics screen (both accessing system ROM routines)\nIn addition, its low-resolution graphics commands have different names from their Integer BASIC/Applesoft II counterparts. All command names are of the form PLTx such that GR, COLOR=, PLOT, HLIN and VLIN are called PLTG, PLTC, PLTP, PLTH, and PLTV, respectively. The command for returning to text mode, known as TEXT in other versions, is simply TEX, and carries the proviso that it has to be the last statement in a program line.\n\nApplesoft BASIC 1.x was closer to Microsoft's original 6502 BASIC code than the later Applesoft II; it retained the Memory Size? prompt and displayed a Microsoft copyright notice. To maintain consistency with Integer BASIC, the \"Ok\" prompt from Microsoft's code was replaced by a ] character. Applesoft 1.x also prompted the user if he wished to disable the LET and REM statements in exchange for lo-res graphics functions.\n\nThe USR() function is also defined differently, serving as a stand-in for the absent CALL command. Its argument is not for passing a numerical value to the machine-language routine, but is instead the call-address of the routine itself; there is no \"hook\" to pre-define the address. All of several examples in the manual use the function only to access \"system monitor ROM\" routines, or short user-routines to manipulate the ROM routines. No mention is made of any code to calculate the value returned by the function itself; the function is always shown being assigned to \"dummy\" variables, which, without action to set a value by user-code, just receive a meaningless value handed back to them. Even accessed ROM routines that return values (in examples, those that provide the service of PDL() and SCRN() functions) merely have their values stored, by user-routines, in locations that are separately PEEKed in a subsequent statement.\n\nUnlike in Integer BASIC and Applesoft II, the Boolean operators AND, OR and NOT perform [[bitwise operation]]s on 16-bit integer values. If they are given values outside that range, an error results.\n\nThe terms OUT and PLT (and the aforementioned IN) appear in the list of reserved words, but are not explained anywhere in the manual.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ALF Products#FTL|ALF's Formula Transfer Link]], speed enhancement for Applesoft BASIC\n* [[Chinese BASIC]], a Chinese-localized version of Applesoft BASIC\n* [[Apple III#BASIC|Apple III BASIC]]s from Apple and Microsoft\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.txbobsc.com/scsc/scdocumentor/ Disassembled ROM]\n* [http://www.calormen.com/jsbasic/ AppleSoft BASIC in JavaScript]\n\n{{BASIC}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Applesoft Basic}}\n[[Category:Apple II software]]\n[[Category:BASIC interpreters]]\n[[Category:Discontinued Microsoft BASICs]]", "sha1": "4owmdh9knoorqx4zqnkppvoqyc5pvkx"}}, {"title": "Asterix", "ns": "0", "id": "2101", "revision": {"id": "866490687", "parentid": "866490674", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T17:25:16Z", "contributor": {"username": "ClueBot NG", "id": "13286072"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverting possible vandalism by [[Special:Contribs/204.10.252.245|204.10.252.245]] to version by Hayholt.

The series first appeared in the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] magazine ''[[Pilote]]'' on 29 October 1959. It was written by [[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny]] and illustrated by [[Albert Uderzo]] until the death of Goscinny in 1977. Uderzo then took over the writing until 2009, when he sold the rights to publishing company [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]]. In 2013, a new team consisting of [[Jean-Yves Ferri]] (script) and [[Didier Conrad]] (artwork) took over. As of 2017, 37 volumes have been released.\n\nThe series follows the adventures of a village of [[Gauls]] as they resist [[Roman Republic|Roman]] occupation in 50 BC. They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their [[druid]] Panoramix (named Getafix in the English translations), which temporarily gives the recipient superhuman strength. The protagonists, the title character [[Asterix (character)|Asterix]] and his friend [[Obelix]], have various adventures. The \"ix\" ending of both names (as well as all the other pseudo-Gaulish \"ix\" names in the series) alludes to the \"rix\" suffix (meaning \"king\") present in the names of many real Gaulish chieftains such as [[Vercingetorix]], [[Orgetorix]] and [[Dumnorix]]. Many of the stories see them travel to foreign countries, though others are set in and around their village. For much of the history of the series (Volumes 4 through 29), settings in Gaul and abroad alternated, with even-numbered volumes set abroad and odd-numbered volumes set in Gaul, mostly in the village.\n\nThe ''Asterix'' series is one of the most popular Franco-Belgian comics in the world, with the series being translated into 111 languages and dialects.<ref name=\"Time\">{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1931169,00.html|title=Asterix at 50: The Comic Hero Conquers the World|date=November 19, 2009|newspaper=Time|first=Leo|last=Cendrowicz|access-date=7 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908022648/http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1931169,00.html|archive-date=8 September 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the series has led to the adaptation of its books into [[List of Asterix films|13 films]]: nine animated, and four live action (one of which, ''[[Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra]]'', was [[Lists of highest-grossing films in France|a major box office success in France]]).

Uderzo decided to sell these rights to Hachette instead of Albert-Ren\u00e9, but the publishing rights on new albums were still owned by Albert Uderzo (40%), Sylvie Uderzo (20%) and Anne Goscinny (40%).\n\nIn December 2008, Uderzo sold his stake to Hachette, which took over the company.<ref>Lezard, Nicholas (January 16, 2009), \"[https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jan/16/asterix-sylvie-uderzo-le-monde Asterix has sold out to the Empire] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819074148/https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jan/16/asterix-sylvie-uderzo-le-monde |date=19 August 2016 }},\" [[The Guardian]] (retrieved June 21, 2016)</ref> In a letter published in the French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' in 2009, Uderzo's daughter, Sylvie, attacked her father's decision to sell the family publishing firm and the rights to produce new ''Ast\u00e9rix'' adventures after his death.

Julius Caesar has conquered nearly all of Gaul for the Roman Republic. The little Armorican village, however, has held out because the villagers can gain temporary superhuman strength by drinking a magic potion brewed by the local village druid, [[List of Asterix characters#Getafix|Getafix]]. His chief is [[List of Asterix characters#Vitalstatistix|Vitalstatistix]].\n\nThe main protagonist and hero of the village is [[Asterix (character)|Asterix]], who, because of his shrewdness, is usually entrusted with the most important affairs of the village. He is aided in his adventures by his rather fat and slower thinking friend, Obelix, who, because he fell into the druid's cauldron of the potion as a baby, has permanent superhuman strength (because of this, Getafix steadily refuses to allow Obelix to drink the potion, as doing so would have a dangerous and unpredictable result). Obelix is usually accompanied by [[List of Asterix characters#Dogmatix|Dogmatix]], his little dog. (Except for Asterix and Obelix, the names of the characters change with the language. For example, Obelix's dog's name is \"Dogmatix\" in English, but \"Id\u00e9fix\" in the original French edition.)\n\nAsterix and Obelix (and sometimes other members of the village) go on various adventures both within the village and in far away lands. Places visited in the series include parts of [[Gaul]] ([[Lutetia]], [[Corsica]] etc.), neighbouring nations ([[Belgium]], [[Spain]], [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Germany]] etc.), and far away lands ([[North America]], [[Middle East]], [[India]] etc.).\n\nThe series employs [[science-fiction]] and [[fantasy]] elements in the more recent books; for instance, the use of [[extraterrestrials]] in ''[[Asterix and the Falling Sky]]'' and the city of [[Atlantis]] in ''[[Asterix and Obelix All at Sea]]''.\n\n==Humour==\n\nThe humour encountered in the ''Asterix'' comics often centers around puns, caricatures, and [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[stereotype]]s of contemporary European nations and [[List of regions in France|French regions]]. Much of the humour in the initial Asterix books was French-specific, which delayed the translation of the books into other languages for fear of losing the jokes and the spirit of the story. Some translations have actually added local humour: In the Italian translation, the Roman legionaries are made to speak in 20th century Roman dialect and Obelix's famous \"''Ils sont fous ces romains''\" (\"These Romans are crazy\") is translated as \"Sono pazzi questi romani\", alluding to the Roman abbreviation ''[[SPQR]]''. In another example: [[Hiccups]] are written [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeically]] in French as \"hips\", but in English as \"hic\", allowing Roman legionaries in at least one of the English translations to [[declension|decline]] their hiccups in Latin (\"hic, haec, hoc\"). The newer albums share a more universal humour, both written and visual.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7049642.stm |title=The vital statistics of Asterix |author= |date=18 October 2007 |work= |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=10 March 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100208100111/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7049642.stm| archivedate= 8 February 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n===Character names===\nAll the fictional characters in ''Asterix'' have names which are puns on their roles or personalities and which follow certain patterns specific to nationality. Certain rules are followed (most of the time) such as Gauls (and their neighbours) having an '-ix' suffix for the males and ending in '-a' for the females, for example, Chief [[List of Asterix characters#Vitalstatistix|Vitalstatistix]] (so called due to his portly stature) and his wife [[List of Asterix characters#Impedimenta|Impedimenta]] (often at odds with the chief). The male Roman names end in '-us', echoing Latin nominitive male singular form, as in [[List of Asterix characters#Romans|Gluteus Maximus]], a muscle-bound athlete whose name is literally the [[gluteus maximus|butt]] of the joke. Gothic names (present-day Germany) end in \"-ic\", after Gothic chiefs such as [[Alaric I|Alaric]] and [[Theoderic]], for example [[Rhetoric]] the interpreter. Greek names end in \"-os\" or \"-es\";  for example, [[Thermos]] the restaurateur. British names end in \"-ax\" and are often puns on the [[taxation]] associated with the later [[United Kingdom]], such as [[Value added tax|Valuaddedtax]] the druid and [[Selective employment tax|Selectivemploymentax]] the mercenary. Other nationalities are treated to [[Pidgin]] translations from their language, like Huevos y Bacon, a Spanish chieftain (whose name, meaning [[eggs and bacon]], is often guidebook Spanish for tourists) or literary and other popular media references, like [[List of Asterix characters#Caricatures|Dubbelosix]] (a reference to [[James Bond]]'s codename 007).\n\nMost of these jokes, and hence the names of the characters, are specific to the translation; for example, the druid [[List of Asterix characters#Getafix|Getafix]] is ''Panoramix'' in the original French and ''Miraculix'' in German.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asterix.com/the-a-to-z-of-asterix/characters/getafix.html|publisher=Asterix the official website|title=A to Z of Asterix: Getafix|access-date=8 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111204808/http://www.asterix.com/the-a-to-z-of-asterix/characters/getafix.html|archive-date=11 January 2018|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Even so, occasionally the wordplay has been preserved: Obelix's dog, known in the original French as ''Id\u00e9fix'' (from ''id\u00e9e fixe'', a \"fixed idea\" or obsession), is called ''Dogmatix'' in English, which not only renders the original meaning strikingly closely (\"dogmatic\") but in fact adds another layer of wordplay with the syllable \"Dog-\" at the beginning of the name.\n\nThe name ''Asterix'', [[French language|French]] ''Ast\u00e9rix'', comes from ''{{lang|fr|ast\u00e9risque}}'', meaning \"[[asterisk]]\", which is the typographical symbol '''*''' indicating a footnote, from the Greek word \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 (''aster''), meaning a \"star\". His name is usually left unchanged in translations, aside from accents and the use of local [[alphabet]]s. For example, in [[Esperanto]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] it is ''Asteriks'' (in Turkish he was first named ''B\u00fcc\u00fcr'' meaning \"shorty\", but the name was then changed). Two exceptions include [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], in which he is known as ''\u00c1str\u00edkur'' (\"Rich of love\") and [[Sinhalese Language|Sinhalese]], where he is known as \u0dc3\u0dd6\u0dbb \u0db4\u0db4\u0dca\u0db4\u0dcf (''Soora Pappa''), which can be interpreted as \"[[Hero]]\".\n\nFor explanations of some of the other names, see [[List of Asterix characters|List of ''Asterix'' characters]].\n\n===Ethnic stereotypes===\n\nMany of the Asterix adventures take place in other countries aside from their homeland, Gaul. In every album that takes place abroad, they meet (usually modern-day) stereotypes for each country as seen by the French.\n\n* Italics (Italians) are the inhabitants of Italy. In the adventures of Asterix, the term \"Romans\" is used by non-Italics to refer to all inhabitants of Italy, who at that time had extended their dominion over a large part of the Mediterranean basin. But as can be seen in [[Asterix and the Chariot Race]], in the Italic peninsula this term is used only to the people from the capital, with many Italics preferring to identify themselves as Umbrians, Etruscans, Venetians, etc. Various topics from this country are explored, as in this case the Italian gastronomy (pasta, pizza, wine), art, famous people (Pavarotti, Berlusconi, Mona Lisa) and even the controversial issue of political corruption.\n* Goths (Germans) are disciplined and militarists, they are composed of many races that fight each other (which is a reference to Germany before [[Otto von Bismarck]] and to East and West Germany after the Second World War) and they wear the [[Pickelhaube]] helmet common during the [[German Empire]].\n* Helvetians (Swiss) are neutral, eat [[fondue]] and are obsessed with cleaning, accurate time-keeping and banks.\n* The Britons (English) are [[phlegmatic]] and speak with early 20th century aristocratic slang (like [[Bertie Wooster]]). They stop for [[Tea (drink)|Tea]] every day (making it with hot water and a drop of milk until Asterix brings them actual [[tea]] leaves), drink lukewarm beer ([[Bitter (beer)|Bitter]]), eat tasteless foods with mint sauce ([[Rosbif]]) and live in streets containing rows of identical houses.\n* Hibernians (Irish) are the inhabitants of Hibernia, the Latin name of Ireland. They fight against the Romans alongside the Britons to defend the British Isles.\n* Hispania (Spain) is a place [[tourism in Spain|full of tourists]]. Hispania is the country where people of northern Europe go on vacation (and ask to eat the same food they eat at their homelands), causing tremendous traffic jams in the Roman roads while traveling. Other recurring topics are flamenco, bullfighting and olive oil. Reference is also made to the famous character of [[Don Quixote]].\n* When the Gauls visited North America in [[Asterix and the Great Crossing]], Obelix punches one of the attacking Native Americans with a [[knockout]] blow. The warrior sees first American-style emblematic eagles; the second time he sees stars in the formation of the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]]; the third time, he sees stars shaped like the [[United States military aircraft national insignia|United States Air Force roundel]]. Asterix's idea for getting the attention of a [[L'Anse aux Meadows|nearby Viking ship]] (which could take them back to Gaul) by holding up a torch refers to the Statue of Liberty (which was a gift from France).\n* Corsicans are proud, patriotic, and easily aroused, but lazy and make decisions by using [[political corruption|pre-filled]] [[ballot box]]es. They harbour vendettas against each other and always take their [[siesta]]. \n* Greeks are [[chauvinism|chauvinists]] and consider Romans to be [[barbarians]]. They eat [[dolma|stuffed grape leaves]], drink [[retsina]] and always have a cousin for the appropriate job.\n* Normans ([[Vikings]]) drink endlessly, they don't know what fear is (which they're trying to discover) and in their country ([[Scandinavia]]) night lasts for 6 months.\n* Cimbres (Danes) are very similar to the Normans. But while Asterix and Obelix were unable to communicate with them, they are perfectly able to understand the Cimbres. Their names end in -ten, perhaps similar to those of the Normans, whose names end in -sen.\n* Belgians speak with a funny accent, snub the Gauls and always eat sliced roots deep-fried in bear fat. They also tell [[Belgian joke]]s.\n* Lusitanians (Portuguese) are short in stature and polite (Uderzo said all the Portuguese who he had met were like that).\n* Sumerians, Assyrians, Hittites, Akkadians and Babylonians are at war with each other and attack strangers because they confuse them for their enemies, but they apologize when they realize that the strangers are not their enemies. This is likely a criticism of the constant conflicts between the Middle Eastern peoples.\n* The Jews are all depicted as [[Yemenite Jews]], with dark skin and black eyes and beards, a tribute to [[Marc Chagall]], the famous painter whose painting of [[King David]] hangs at the [[Knesset]] (Israeli Parliament). Asterix's and Obelix's visit to [[Jerusalem]] is full of references to the [[Bible]].\n* Numidians, contrary to the Berber inhabitants of ancient Numidia, located in North Africa, are obviously Africans from sub-Saharan Africa. The names end in -tha after the historical king [[Jugurtha]] of Numidia.\n* The Picts (Scots) wear a typical dress with kilt (skirt), have the habit of drinking \"malt water\" (whisky) and throwing logs (caber tossing) as a popular sport and, of course, the names of the characters all start with Mac.\n* Sarmatians (Russians).

(The [[Green Bay Packers]] were an independent team until they joined the NFL a year after its creation in 1921.) The club then moved to [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis]] in {{Cardinals NFL season|1960}} and played in that city through {{Cardinals NFL season|1987}} (sometimes referred to as the \"Football Cardinals\" or the \"Big Red\" to avoid confusion with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] of [[Major League Baseball]]). Before the {{Cardinals NFL season|1988}} season, the team moved west to [[Tempe, Arizona]], a [[college town|college suburb]] east of Phoenix, and played their home games for the next 18 seasons at [[Sun Devil Stadium]] on the campus of [[Arizona State University]]. In {{Cardinals NFL season|2006}}, the club moved to their current home field in Glendale, although the team's executive offices and training facility remain in Tempe.\n\nThe franchise has won two NFL championships, both while it was based in Chicago. The first occurred in {{Cardinals NFL season|1925}}, but is the subject of [[1925 NFL Championship controversy|controversy]], with supporters of the [[Pottsville Maroons]] believing that Pottsville should have won the title. Their second title, and the first to be won in a [[History of the National Football League championship|championship game]], came in {{Cardinals NFL season|1947}}, nearly two decades before the [[Super Bowl I|first]] [[Super Bowl]]. They returned to the title game to defend in [[1948 NFL Championship Game|1948]], but lost the rematch 7\u20130 in a snowstorm in Philadelphia.\n\nSince winning the [[1947 NFL Championship Game|championship in 1947]], the team suffered many losing seasons, and currently holds [[List of NFL franchise post-season droughts|the longest active championship drought]] of North American sports at 70 consecutive seasons after [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Chicago Cubs]] ended their [[Curse of the Billy Goat|108 year drought]] in 2016.

During that season, they won their only [[NFC Championship Game]] since the 1970 [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]], and reached [[Super Bowl XLIII]] (losing 27\u201323 to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]). The team has also won five division titles ({{Cardinals NFL season|1974}}, {{Cardinals NFL season|1975}}, {{Cardinals NFL season|2008}}, {{Cardinals NFL season|2009}} and {{Cardinals NFL season|2015}}) since their 1947\u201348 NFL championship game appearances. The Cardinals are the only NFL team who have never lost a playoff game at home, with a 5\u20130 record: the [[1947 NFL Championship Game]], two postseason victories during the aforementioned 2008\u201309 NFL playoffs, one during the [[2009\u201310 NFL playoffs|2009\u201310 playoffs]], and one during the [[2015\u201316 NFL playoffs|2015\u201316 playoffs]].\n\nFrom 1988 through 2012 (except 2005, when they trained in [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]]), the Cardinals conducted their annual summer training camp at [[Northern Arizona University]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]]. The Cardinals moved their training camp to University of Phoenix Stadium in 2013. The stadium was the site of the [[2015 Pro Bowl]], unlike in past years, where it was held at [[Aloha Stadium]] in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. The stadium also played host to Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XLII|XLII]] and [[Super Bowl XLIX|XLIX]], and will host [[Super Bowl LVII]] in 2023.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{Main|History of the Arizona Cardinals}}\n\n===Chicago===\n{{Main|History of the Chicago Cardinals}}\nThe franchise's inception dates back to 1898, when a neighborhood group gathered to play in the [[Chicago]] [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]], calling themselves Morgan Athletic Club. Chicago painting and building contractor [[Chris O'Brien (American football)|Chris O'Brien]] acquired the team, which he relocated to [[Normal Park|Normal Field]] on Racine Avenue. The team was known as Racine Normals until 1901, when O'Brien bought used jerseys from the [[University of Chicago]]. He described the faded [[maroon]] clothing as \"[[Cardinal (color)|Cardinal red]]\" and the team became the Racine Street Cardinals. The team eventually became in 1920 a charter member of the American Professional Football Association (APFA), which two years later was rechristened to [[National Football League]] (NFL). The team entered the league as the Racine Cardinals, however the name was changed in 1922 to Chicago Cardinals to avoid confusion with the [[Racine Legion|Horlick-Racine Legion]], who entered the league the same year.<ref>{{Cite book|title = To the NFL: You Sure Started Somethin': A Historical Guide of All 32 NFL Teams and the Cities They've Played In|last = Griffith|first = R.D.|publisher = Dorrance Publishing|year = 2012|isbn = 978-1434916815|location = |page = 2}}</ref> Except for [[1925 NFL season|1925]], when they were awarded the championship after the [[Pottsville Maroons]] were suspended, the Cardinals experienced only minimal success on the playing field during their first 26 seasons in the league.

In {{Cardinals NFL season|1990}}, the team began wearing red pants with their white jerseys, as new coach [[Joe Bugel]] wanted to emulate his former employer, the [[Washington Redskins]], who at the time wore burgundy pants with their white jerseys (the Redskins later returned to their 1970s gold pants with all their jerseys).\n\nIn {{nfly|1994}}, the Cardinals participated in the NFL's 75th anniversary throwback uniform program. The jerseys were similar to those of the 1920s Chicago Cardinals, with an interlocking \"CC\" logo and three stripes on each sleeve. The uniform numbers were relocated to the right chest. The pants were khaki to simulate the color and material used in that era. The Cardinals also stripped the logos from their helmets for two games: at [[1994 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland]] and home vs. [[1994 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]].\n\nThe Cardinal head on the helmet was repeated on the white jersey from 1982 to 1995. In 1996, the state flag of Arizona was moved higher on the sleeve after the Cardinal head was eliminated, and black was removed as an accent color, instead replaced with a blue to match the predominant color of the state flag. In 2002, the Cardinals began to wear all-red and all-white combinations, and continued to do so through 2004, prior to the team's makeover.\n\nIn {{nfly|2005}}, the team unveiled its first major changes in a century.

The Packers won 31\u201314, and the Cards headed into their bye week with a 1\u20137 mark. Following the bye week, the Cardinals came out in an all-red combination at home against the Dallas Cowboys and lost, 27\u201310. Arizona did not wear the red pants for the remainder of the season and won four of their last seven games. However, the following season, in {{Cardinals NFL season|2007}}, the Cardinals again wore their red pants for their final 3 home games. They wore red pants with white jerseys in games on the road at the Cincinnati Bengals and Seattle Seahawks. They paired red pants with red jerseys, the all-red combination, for home games against the Detroit Lions, San Francisco 49ers, Cleveland Browns, and St. Louis Rams. The red pants were not worn at all in {{Cardinals NFL season|2008}}, but they were used in home games vs. Seattle, Minnesota, and St. Louis in {{Cardinals NFL season|2009}}. The red pants were paired with the white road jersey for the first time in three years during a 2010 game at Carolina, but the white jersey/red pants combination has not been used since.\n\nThe Cardinals' first home game in Arizona, in 1988, saw them play in red jerseys. Thereafter, for the next 18 years in Arizona, the Cardinals, like a few other NFL teams in warm climates, wore their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season\u2014forcing opponents to suffer in their darker jerseys during Arizona autumns that frequently see temperatures over 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C). However, this tradition did not continue when the Cardinals moved from Sun Devil Stadium to University of Phoenix Stadium in 2006, as early-season games (and some home games late in the season) were played with the roof closed. With the temperature inside at a comfortable 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C), the team opted to wear red jerseys at home full-time. The Cardinals wore white jerseys at home for the first time in University of Phoenix Stadium on August 29, 2008, in a preseason game against the [[Denver Broncos]].\n\nThe Cardinals wore white at home for the first time in a regular season game at University of Phoenix Stadium against the [[Houston Texans]] on October 11, {{nfly|2009}}. In October 2009, the NFL recognized [[Breast Cancer Awareness Month]], and players wore pink-accented items, including gloves, wristbands, and shoes.

The NFL had planned to add two teams in {{nfly|1967}}; the competition with the AFL for Atlanta forced the first to be added a year early in {{nfly|1966}}. The odd number of teams (15) resulted in one idle team (bye) each week, with each team playing fourteen games over fifteen weeks (similar to {{nfly|1960}}: twelve games over thirteen weeks). The second expansion team, the [[1967 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], joined the NFL as planned in 1967 as its sixteenth franchise.\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons franchise began on June 30, 1965, when Rozelle granted ownership to forty-year-old [[Rankin Smith Sr.]], an Executive Vice President of Life Insurance Company of Georgia. He paid $8.5 million, the highest price in NFL history at the time for a franchise.<ref name=\"AtlantaFalcons1\"/> Rozelle and Smith made the deal in about five minutes and the Atlanta Falcons brought the largest and most popular sport to the city of Atlanta. The Atlanta expansion team became the fifteenth NFL franchise, and they were awarded the first overall pick in the [[1966 NFL Draft]] as well as the final pick in each of the first five rounds.<ref name=HOF1966>{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/story.jsp?story_id=1998|title=1966 NFL Draft|accessdate =September 27, 2008 |publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame}}</ref> They selected consensus [[1965 College Football All-America Team|All-American]] [[linebacker]] [[Tommy Nobis]] from the [[1965 Texas Longhorns football season|University of Texas]], making him the first-ever Falcon.

Miss Julia Elliott, a school teacher from [[Griffin, Georgia|Griffin]], was singled out from many people who suggested \"Falcons\" as the nickname for the new franchise.

Under head coach [[Norb Hecker]], Atlanta lost their first nine regular season games in 1966; their first victory came on the road against the struggling [[1966 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on November 20 in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. Two weeks later, Atlanta won at [[1966 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]], and beat [[1966 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis]] in Atlanta the next week for their first home win.  The team finished the 1960s with twelve wins in four seasons.\n\nThe Falcons had their first [[Monday Night Football]] game in Atlanta during the [[1970 Atlanta Falcons season|1970]] season, a 20\u20137 loss to the [[1970 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]. The only two winning seasons in their first twelve years were {{nowrap|[[1971 Atlanta Falcons season|1971]] (7\u20136\u20131)}} and {{nowrap|[[1973 Atlanta Falcons season|1973]] (9\u20135).}}\n\n===1978\u20131989===\n[[File:1987 Atlanta Falcons Pocket Schedule.jpg|thumb|right|The Falcons' defense taking on [[1985 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] quarterback [[John Elway]] during a [[1985 Atlanta Falcons season|1985]] game.]]\nIn the [[1978 Atlanta Falcons season|1978]] season, the Falcons qualified for the playoffs for the first time and won the Wild Card game against the [[1978 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] 14\u201313. The following week, they lost to the [[1978 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 27\u201320 in the Divisional Playoffs.\n\nIn the [[1980 Atlanta Falcons season|1980]] season, after a nine-game winning streak, the Falcons posted a franchise then-best record of 12\u20134 and captured their first NFC West division title. The next week, their dream season ended at home with a loss to the Cowboys 30\u201327 in the divisional playoffs. In the strike-shortened [[1982 Atlanta Falcons season|1982]] season, the Falcons made the playoffs but lost to the [[1982 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], 30\u201324. Falcons coach [[Leeman Bennett]] was fired after the loss. The team then had losing seasons for the next eight years.\n\n===1989\u20131996===\nIn the [[1989 NFL Draft]], the Falcons selected cornerback [[Deion Sanders]] in the first round, who helped them for the next four years, setting many records for the franchise. \"Neon Deion\" (a.k.a. \"Prime Time\") had a flashy appeal and helped bring media attention to one of the league's most anonymous franchises. Sanders was also famous for playing on major league baseball teams ([[New York Yankees]] and the [[Atlanta Braves]]) while simultaneously playing in the NFL.\n\n[[File:Atlanta Falcons at Los Angeles Rams 1991-12-08 - 01 (Atlanta Falcons crop).jpg|thumb|right|The Falcons playing against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] during a 1991 away game.]]\n\nAfter defeating the [[1991 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] in the NFC Wild Card game, the Falcons' [[1991 Atlanta Falcons season|1991]] season ended in a divisional playoff loss to the [[1991 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. In the [[1991 NFL Draft]], the Falcons selected quarterback [[Brett Favre]] as the thirty-third overall pick. During his rookie season, he played in two games where he amassed a record of four passing attempts with no receptions and two interceptions. The following February, Favre was traded to the [[1992 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]].\n\nIn [[1992 Atlanta Falcons season|1992]], the Atlanta Falcons opened a new chapter in their history moving into the newly constructed Georgia Dome, where the team has defeated all 31 other NFL teams at least once during its time there.\n\n===1997\u20132000: The Dan Reeves era===\nIn 1998, under recently acquired head coach [[Dan Reeves]], quarterback [[Chris Chandler]] and running back [[Jamal Anderson]] the \"Dirty Bird\" Falcons had their greatest season to date. On November 8, they beat the [[New England Patriots]] 41\u201310, ending a streak of 22 losses at cold-weather sites. The team finished with a franchise-best 14\u20132 regular season record and the NFC West division championship. On January 17, 1999, the Falcons upset the top-seeded Vikings at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in the [[NFC Championship Game]] 30\u201327, in an exciting overtime victory. However, in their first-ever Super Bowl appearance, they lost 34\u201319 to the defending champion [[Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]].\n\nIn the second game of the Falcons 1999 season, running back [[Jamal Anderson]], who had been a key player in the Falcons' 1998 success, suffered a season-ending knee injury. The Falcons finished the season with a very disappointing 5\u201311 regular season record.<ref name=\"AtlantaFalcons1\"/> In 2000, the Falcons suffered through another horrendous season finishing 4\u201312 and once again missing the playoffs.\n\n===2001\u20132006===\nIn the [[2001 NFL draft]], the Falcons orchestrated a trade with the [[San Diego Chargers]], acquiring the first overall pick (which was used on quarterback [[Michael Vick]]) in exchange for wide receiver-return specialist [[Tim Dwight]] and the fifth overall pick (used on running back [[LaDainian Tomlinson]]).\n\nThe Falcons finished the [[2001 Atlanta Falcons season|2001 season]] with a record of 7\u20139 and missed the playoffs. [[Jessie Tuggle]] retired following 14 seasons in Atlanta. On December 6, 2001, [[Arthur M. Blank]] reached a preliminary agreement with the Falcons' Taylor Smith to purchase the team.

Although the gold was removed after several seasons, the white remains to this day. They wore white pants and either black or white jerseys. At first, the falcon crest logo was also put on the jersey sleeves, but it was replaced by a red and white stripe pattern four years later.

The Falcons also wore their all-black uniform in 2007 against the New York Giants, and in 2008 against the Carolina Panthers and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (for the second time).\n\nIn the 1980s, the Falcons wore their white uniforms at home most of the time because of the heat. When the Falcons started playing in a dome, the team switched to their dark uniforms for home games but have worn their white uniforms at home a few times since switching to the dome. It was announced at the 2009 state of the franchise meeting that the Falcons would wear 1966 throwback uniforms for a couple games during the 2009 season. The Atlanta Falcons wore 1966 throwback jerseys for two home games in 2009 \u2013 against the Carolina Panthers on September 20 and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 29. The Falcons won both of those games. They donned the throwbacks again for 2 games in 2010, against Baltimore and San Francisco, winning both of those games as well.\n\nThe Falcons unveiled an all-red [[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]] uniform on September 13, 2016; however, due to the fact that the Falcons and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] had similar all-red Color Rush uniforms, the Falcons were unable to wear their Color Rush uniform until the 2017 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=NFL AND NIKE REVEAL COLOR RUSH UNIFORMS|url=http://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/blog/article-1/NFL-and-Nike-Reveal-Color-Rush-Uniforms/883c04f8-5825-4a4d-95ef-6be771804c10|publisher=Atlanta Falcons|date=September 13, 2016|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Tabeek|first=Matthew|title=LOOK: THREE STRAIGHT HOME GAMES WITH THREE DIFFERENT UNIFORM COMBINATIONS FOR FALCONS|url=http://www.atlantafalcons.com/news/article-1/LOOK-Three-straight-home-games-with-three-different-uniform-combinations-for-Falcons/12bd613d-78fc-41ae-968c-a5a295b1118a|publisher=Atlanta Falcons|date=December 4, 2017|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Rivalries==\n===New Orleans Saints===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2017}}\n{{Main|Falcons\u2013Saints rivalry}}\nIn every season except for their debut season, the Falcons have shared a division with the [[New Orleans Saints]] (first the NFC West, and now the NFC South).
