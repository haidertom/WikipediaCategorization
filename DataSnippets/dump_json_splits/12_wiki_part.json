Abiotic stress is essentially unavoidable.\nAbiotic stress affects animals, but plants are especially dependent, if not solely dependent, on environmental factors, so it is particularly constraining.  Abiotic stress is the most harmful factor concerning the growth and [[Agricultural productivity|productivity of crops]] worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gao | first1 = Ji-Ping | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2007 | title = Understanding Abiotic Stress Tolerance Mechanisms: Recent Studies on Stress Response in Rice | url = | journal = Journal of Integrative Plant Biology | volume = 49 | issue = 6| pages = 742\u2013750 | doi=10.1111/j.1744-7909.2007.00495.x}}</ref>  Research has also shown that abiotic stressors are at their most harmful when they occur together, in combinations of abiotic stress factors.<ref name =\"mitt\">{{cite journal | last1 = Mittler | first1 = Ron | year = 2006 | title = Abiotic stress, the field environment and stress combination | url = | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 15\u201319 | doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2005.11.002}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nAbiotic stress comes in many forms.  The most common of the stressors are the easiest for people to identify, but there are many other, less recognizable abiotic stress factors which affect environments constantly.<ref name=\"Palta, Jiwan P 2006\">Palta, Jiwan P. and Farag, Karim.  \"Methohasds for enhancing plant health, protecting plants from biotic and abiotic stress related injuries and enhancing the recovery of plants injured as a result of such stresses.\"  United States Patent 7101828, September 2006.</ref>\n\nThe most basic stressors include:  \n* High [[winds]]<ref name=\"Palta, Jiwan P 2006\"/>\n* Extreme [[temperatures]]<ref name=\"Palta, Jiwan P 2006\"/>\n* [[Drought]]<ref name=\"Palta, Jiwan P 2006\"/>\n* [[Flood]]<ref name=\"Palta, Jiwan P 2006\"/>\n* Other natural disasters, such as [[tornado]]es and [[wildfires]].<ref name=\"Palta, Jiwan P 2006\"/>\n\nLesser-known stressors generally occur on a smaller scale. They include: poor [[edaphic]] conditions like rock content and [[pH|pH levels]], high [[radiation]], compaction, contamination, and other, highly specific conditions like rapid [[tissue hydration|rehydration]] during [[seed germination]].<ref name=\"Palta, Jiwan P 2006\"/>\n\n==Effects==\nAbiotic stress, as a natural part of every ecosystem, will affect organisms in a variety of ways.  Although these effects may be either beneficial or detrimental, the location of the area is crucial in determining the extent of the impact that abiotic stress will have.  The higher the latitude of the area affected, the greater the impact of abiotic stress will be on that area.  So, a [[taiga]] or boreal forest is at the mercy of whatever abiotic stress factors may come along, while tropical zones are much less susceptible to such stressors.<ref name=\"wolf\">Wolfe, A.  \u201cPatterns of biodiversity.\u201d  Ohio State University, 2007.</ref>\n\n===Benefits===\nOne example of  a situation where abiotic stress plays a constructive role in an ecosystem is in natural wildfires.  While they can be a human safety hazard, it is productive for these ecosystems to burn out every once in a while so that new organisms can begin to grow and thrive.\nEven though it is healthy for an ecosystem, a wildfire can still be considered an abiotic stressor, because it puts an obvious stress on individual organisms within the area.  Every tree that is scorched and each bird nest that is devoured is a sign of the abiotic stress.  On the larger scale, though, natural wildfires are positive manifestations of abiotic stress.<ref name=\"bruss\">{{cite journal | last1 = Brussaard | first1 = Lijbert | last2 = de Ruiter | first2 = Peter C. | last3 = Brown | first3 = George G. | year = 2007 | title = Soil biodiversity for agricultural sustainability | url = | journal = Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment | volume = 121 | issue = | pages = 233\u2013244 | doi=10.1016/j.agee.2006.12.013}}</ref>\n\nWhat also needs to be taken into account when looking for benefits of abiotic stress, is that one phenomenon may not affect an entire ecosystem in the same way.  While a flood will kill most plants living low on the ground in a certain area, if there is rice there, it will thrive in the wet conditions.\nAnother example of this is in [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]].  The same types of conditions are usually considered stressful for these two types of organisms.  They act very similarly when exposed to ultraviolet light and most toxins, but at elevated temperatures the phytoplankton reacts negatively, while the [[thermophilic]] zooplankton reacts positively to the increase in temperature. The two may be living in the same environment, but an increase in temperature of the area would prove stressful only for one of the organisms.<ref name = \"vine\"/>\n\nLastly, abiotic stress has enabled species to grow, develop, and evolve, furthering natural selection as it picks out the weakest of a group of organisms.  Both plants and animals have evolved mechanisms allowing them to survive extremes.<ref name=\"roel\">{{cite journal | last1 = Roelofs | first1 = D. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2008 | title = Functional ecological genomics to demonstrate general and specific responses to abiotic stress | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01312.x | journal = Functional Ecology | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 8\u201318 }}</ref>\n\n===Detriments===\nThe most obvious detriment concerning abiotic stress involves farming.  It has been claimed by one study that abiotic stress causes the most crop loss of any other factor and that most major crops are reduced in their yield by more than 50% from their potential yield.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = W. | last2 = Vinocur | first2 = B. | last3 = Altman | first3 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Plant responses to drought, salinity and extreme temperatures towards genetic engineering for stress tolerance | doi = 10.1007/s00425-003-1105-5 | journal = Planta | volume = 218 | issue = | pages = 1\u201314 }}</ref>\n\nBecause abiotic stress is widely considered a detrimental effect, the research on this branch of the issue is extensive. For more information on the harmful effects of abiotic stress, see the sections below on plants and animals.\n\n==In plants==\nA plant's first line of defense against abiotic stress is in its roots.  If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.<ref name=\"bruss\"/>\n\nThe plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cramer|first=Grant R|last2=Urano|first2=Kaoru|last3=Delrot|first3=Serge|last4=Pezzotti|first4=Mario|last5=Shinozaki|first5=Kazuo|date=2011-11-17|year=|title=Effects of abiotic stress on plants: a systems biology perspective|journal=BMC Plant Biology|volume=11|pages=163|doi=10.1186/1471-2229-11-163|issn=1471-2229|pmc=3252258|pmid=22094046|via=}}</ref>\n\nOne of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell.  High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions.  Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Conde|first=Artur|year=2011|title=Membrane Transport, Sensing and Signaling in Plant Adaptation to Environmental Stress|url=http://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/pcp/52/9/10.1093/pcp/pcr107/2/pcr107.pdf?Expires=1485797994&Signature=Cemd6gLc-NOAT39G3-6uNqRUU6r97KGEAOyCNNn2uYjNVPelfxGYMUDxK660bIU6Afj6fNwTfB9pXf9DgOcCqz5CJOjC-bL3H19H1eFUe0Wsid8jnH9J4k30SaaF-arCEmbLrBsTJrWkrsq84THqi0ervfu-4hd~5arrd-ytItFSqkXje1frT3zWxJoosf3~Asfs-5qt50yGImSOXHjVk2LNgZeyD5FKqt7KZReojKLjZnZIUsdHLnDBD4RjF24ezB3mbbNtz8kq60eoiVUFMWlJhkYoD7NYwijrartby2612WMmS1vkKnZ3bT5emRl9qe8trQJarCUlQEKUYp6MDA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q|journal=Plant & Cell Physiology|volume=52 | issue = 9 |pages=1583\u20131602|via=Google Scholar|doi=10.1093/pcp/pcr107}}</ref>\n\nFacilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment.  It is how plants work together.  In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well.  This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Maestre | first1 = Fernando T. | last2 = Cortina | first2 = Jordi | last3 = Bautista | first3 = Susana | year = 2007 | title = Mechanisms underlying the interaction between Pinus halepensis and the native late-successional shrub Pistacia lentiscus in a semi-arid plantation | doi = 10.1111/j.0906-7590.2004.03990.x | journal = Ecography | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 776\u2013786 }}</ref>\n\nPlants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area.  When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely.  Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.<ref name =\"mitt\"/>\n\nRice (''[[Oryza sativa]]'') is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India.  Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied among several rice varieties with different genotypes using molecular markers.\n\nSerpentine soils (media with low concentrations of nutrients and high concentrations of heavy metals) can be a source of abiotic stress. Initially, the absorption of toxic metal ions is limited by cell membrane exclusion. Ions that are absorbed into tissues are sequestered in cell vacuoles. This sequestration mechanism is facilitated by proteins on the vacuole membrane.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Palm, Brady |author2=Van Volkenburgh|date=2012|title=Serpentine tolerance in Mimuslus guttatus does not rely on exclusion of magnesium|url=|journal=Functional Plant Biology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nChemical priming has been proposed to increase tolerance to abiotic stresses in crop plants. In this method, which is analogous to vaccination, stress-inducing chemical agents are introduced to the plant in brief doses so that the plant begins preparing defense mechanisms. Thus, when the abiotic stress occurs, the plant has already prepared defense mechanisms that can be activated faster and increase tolerance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Savvides|first=Andreas|date=December 15, 2015|title=Chemical Priming of Plants Against Multiple Abiotic Stresses: Mission Possible?|url=http://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/abstract/S1360-1385(15)00283-6|journal=Trends in Plant Science|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2015.11.003|pmid=|access-date=March 10, 2016|hdl=10754/596020}}</ref>\n\n=== Salt stress in plants ===\nSoil salinization, the accumulation of water-soluble salts to levels that negatively impact plant production, is a global phenomenon affecting approximately 831 million hectares of land.<ref>Martinez-Beltran J, Manzur CL.

Ethylene is known for regulating plant growth and development and dealing with stress conditions. Many central membrane proteins in plants, such as ETO2, ERS1 and EIN2, are used for ethylene signaling in many plant growth processes. Mutations in these proteins can lead to heightened salt sensitivity and can limit plant growth. The effects of salinity has been studied on Arabidopsis plants that have mutated ERS1, ERS2, ETR1, ETR2 and EIN4 proteins. These proteins are used for ethylene signaling again certain stress conditions, such as salt and the ethylene precursor ACC is used to suppress any sensitivity to the salt stress.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lei|first=Gang|last2=Shen|first2=Ming|last3=Li|first3=Zhi-Gang|last4=Zhang|first4=Bo|last5=Duan|first5=Kai-Xuan|last6=Wang|first6=Ning|last7=Cao|first7=Yang-Rong|last8=Zhang|first8=Wan-Ke|last9=Ma|first9=Biao|date=2011-10-01|title=EIN2 regulates salt stress response and interacts with a MA3 domain-containing protein ECIP1 in Arabidopsis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2011.02363.x/abstract|journal=Plant, Cell & Environment|language=en|volume=34|issue=10|pages=1678\u20131692|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3040.2011.02363.x|issn=1365-3040}}</ref>\n\n=== Phosphate starvation in plants ===\n\nPhosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient required for plant growth and development, but most of the world's soil is limited in this important plant nutrient. Plants can utilize P mainly in the form if soluble inorganic phosphate (Pi) but are subjected to abiotic stress of P-limitation when there is not sufficient soluble PO4 available in the soil. Phosphorus forms insoluble complexes with Ca and Mg in alkaline soils and Al and Fe in acidic soils that makes it unavailable for plant roots. When there is limited bioavailable P in the soil, plants show extensive abiotic stress phenotype such as short primary roots and more lateral roots and root hairs to make more surface available for Pi absorption, exudation of organic acids and phosphatase to release Pi from complex P containing molecules and make it available for growing plants organs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Raghothama|first=K.

A decrease in precipitation and subsequent increase in drought are extremely likely in the future due to an increase in global warming.<ref name=\":1\"/> Plants have come up with many mechanisms and adaptations to try and deal with drought stress. One of the leading ways that plants combat drought stress is by closing their stomates.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-20|title=Stoma|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stoma&oldid=837425367|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}</ref> A key hormone regulating stomatal opening and closing is abscisic acid (ABA). Synthesis of ABA causes the ABA to bind to receptors. This binding then effects the opening of ion channels thereby decreasing turgor pressure in the stomata and causing them to close. Recent studies, by Gonzalez-Villagra, et al., showed how ABA levels increased in drought-stressed plants (2018). They showed that when plants were placed in a stressful situation they produced more ABA to try and conserve any water they had in their leaves.<ref name=\":02\" />  Another extremely important factor in dealing with drought stress and regulating the uptake and export of water is aquaporins (AQPs). AQPs are integral membrane proteins that make up channels.

This is because many species are unable to regulate their internal [[body temperature]].  Even in the species that are able to regulate their own [[temperature]], it is not always a completely accurate system.  Temperature determines [[metabolic rate]]s, [[heart rate]]s, and other very important factors within the bodies of animals, so an extreme temperature change can easily distress the animal's body.  Animals can respond to extreme heat, for example, through natural heat acclimation or by burrowing into the ground to find a cooler space.<ref name=\"roel\"/>\n\nIt is also possible to see in animals that a high genetic diversity is beneficial in providing resiliency against harsh abiotic stressors.

If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.<ref name=\"bruss\"/>\n\nThis idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related.  It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases.<ref name=\"wolf\"/>  This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ecophysiology]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{modelling ecosystems}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Abiotic Stress}}\n[[Category:Stress]]\n[[Category:Biodiversity]]\n[[Category:Habitat]]", "sha1": "dl9y4x3cmrnsvck6r5z0fqlxtsvvzlh"}}, {"title": "Accusative case", "ns": "0", "id": "2251", "revision": {"id": "865201158", "parentid": "863985315", "timestamp": "2018-10-22T12:27:31Z", "contributor": {"username": "BD2412", "id": "196446"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Semitic languages */Improving links and other minor cleanup tasks", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "The '''accusative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{smallcaps|'''acc'''}}) of a [[noun]] is the [[grammatical case]] used to mark the [[direct object]] of a [[transitive verb]]. The same case is used in many languages for the objects of (some or all) [[preposition]]s.  It is a noun that is having something done to it, usually used together (such as in [[Latin]]) with the [[nominative case]]. For example, \"they\" in English is nominative; \"them\" is accusative. The sentence \"They like them\" shows the nominative case and accusative case working in conjunction using the same base word.

[[Finnic languages]], such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]], have two cases to mark objects, the accusative and the [[partitive case]]. In [[morphosyntactic alignment]] terms, both perform the accusative function, but the accusative object is [[Telicity|telic]], while the partitive is not.\n\nModern [[English language|English]], which almost entirely lacks [[declension]] in its nouns, does not have an explicitly marked accusative case even in the pronouns.  Such forms as ''whom'', ''them'', and ''her'' derive rather from the old Germanic [[dative case|dative]] forms, of which the -m and -r endings are characteristic.  This conflation of the old accusative, dative, and (after prepositions) genitive cases is the ''[[oblique case]]''.  Most modern English grammarians no longer use the Latin accusative/dative model, though they tend to use the terms ''objective'' for oblique, ''subjective'' for nominative, and ''possessive'' for genitive ''(see [[declension in English]]).''  ''Hine'', a true accusative masculine third person singular pronoun, is attested in some northern English dialects as late as the 19th century.<ref>Oxford University Press.

In English the two uses are distinguished by different forms of the pronoun: he/him. If, however, instead of a pronoun, we use a noun, we make no such distinction in the form of the word. Thus, we use the same word \"man\" in both '''''The man''' sees the woman'' and ''The woman sees '''the man'''''. In many languages, however, different forms of the word are used not only for pronouns, but for nouns too. For example, in Latin ''The man sees the woman'' = '''''Vir''' feminam videt'', while ''The woman sees the man'' = ''Femina '''virum''' videt''. For \"man\", Latin uses \"vir\" for the subject, and \"virum\" for the object. Likewise, in the same pair of sentences, we have \"femina\" for a subject and \"feminam\" for object. The form used for the direct object (\"him\", \"virum\", \"feminam\") is known as the \"accusative case\", while the form used for the subject (\"he\", \"vir\", \"femina\") is known as the [[nominative case]].\n\nJust as with pronouns and nouns, many inflected languages also make distinctions between cases in their adjectives and (for languages that have them) articles. Thus in German, \"the giant\" as the subject of a sentence may be expressed as ''der Riese'': nominative case. As the object of a verb, this becomes '''''den''' Riesen'', the accusative.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Indo-European languages===\n\n==== Latin ====\nIn Latin, nouns, adjectives, or pronouns in the accusative case (''accusativus'') can be used\n* as [[object (grammar)|direct object]].\n* to indicate duration of time. E.g., ''multos annos'', \"for many years\"; ''ducentos annos'', \"for 200 years.\"  This is known as the '''accusative of time'''. Compare the [[ablative of time]], which was used for most points in time except\u2014in classical Latin\u2014for dates of the form ''ante diem N. Kal./Non./Id.'', which followed [[ancient Greek language|Greek]] in taking the accusative.\n* to indicate direction towards which.  E.g. ''domum'', \"homewards\"; ''Romam'', \"to Rome\" with no preposition needed. This is known as the '''accusative of place to which''', and is equivalent to the [[lative case]] found in some other languages.\n* as the subject of an [[indirect statement]] (e.g. ''Dixit '''me''' fuisse saevum'', \"He said that '''I''' had been cruel;\" in later Latin works, such as the [[Vulgate]], such a construction is replaced by ''quod'' and a regularly structured sentence, having the subject in the nominative: e.g., ''Dixit quod '''ego''' fueram saevus'').\n* with case-specific prepositions such as \"per\" (through), \"ad\" (to/toward), and \"trans\" (across).\n* in exclamations, such as ''me miseram,'' \"wretched me\" (spoken by [[Circe]] to [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] in [[Ovid]]'s ''Remedium Amoris;'' note that this is feminine: the masculine form would be me miser<ins>um</ins>).\n\nFor the accusative endings, see [[Latin declension]].\n\n=====Latin prepositions=====\nSome Latin [[preposition]]s take a noun in the accusative.  A few prepositions may take either an accusative or an [[ablative case|ablative]], in which case the accusative indicates motion, and the ablative indicates no motion. E.g. (ablative) ''in cas\u0101'', \"in the cottage\"; (accusative) ''in casam'', \"into the cottage\".<ref>Wheelock, Frederic M. ''[[Wheelock's Latin]]'', HarperCollins, 2005. {{ISBN|0-06-078371-0}}</ref>\n\nThis ''aide-memoire'' was taught in schools when Latin was on the curriculum:<br />\n''Ante, apud, ad, adversus,''<br />\n''Circum, circa, citra, cis,''<br />\n''Contra, inter, erga, extra,''<br />\n''Infra, intra, iuxta, ob,''<br />\n''Penes, pone, post,'' and ''praeter,''<br />\n''Prope, propter, per, secundum,''<br />\n''Supra, versus, ultra, trans:''\n**Add ''super, subter, sub,'' and ''in,''\nWhen 'motion' 'tis, not 'state' they mean.**<ref>[http://laudatortemporisacti.blogspot.co.uk/2006/03/latin-prepositions.html Laudator Temporis Acti: Latin Prepositions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOr try: ** ''And unto these if motion be intended,''<br/>\n''Let In, Sub, Super, Subter be appended ''\n\n==== German ====\n[[German language|German]] uses the accusative to mark direct objects and objects of certain [[preposition and postposition|prepositions]], or [[adverb]]s relating to time. The accusative is only marked for masculine [[article (grammar)|articles]], [[pronoun]]s, [[adjective]]s, and weak nouns.\n\n=====German articles=====\nThe masculine forms for [[German articles]], e.g., ''der'' (the), ''ein'' (a/an), ''mein'' (my), etc., change in the accusative case: they always end in ''-en''. Feminine, neuter and plural articles do not change in the accusative.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n! Neuter\n! Plural\n|-\n| Definite article (the)\n| ''den''\n| die\n| das\n| die\n|-\n| Indefinite article (a/an)\n| ''einen''\n| eine\n| ein\n| \n|}\n\nFor example, \"''Hund''\" (dog) is a masculine (''ein/der'') word, so the article changes when used in the accusative case:\n*''Ich habe einen Hund.'' (lit., I have a dog.) In this sentence \"a dog\" is in the accusative case as it is the second idea (the [[Object (grammar)|object]]) of the sentence.\n\n=====German pronouns=====\nMost [[German pronouns]] also change in the accusative case, with the exception of the third-person forms except the masculine, which are ''sie'' in the nominative and accusative forms, and the second-person formal form, which is ''Sie'' in both forms.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Case\n!

These include ''bis'' (until), ''durch'' (through), ''f\u00fcr'' (for), ''gegen'' (against), ''ohne'' (without), ''um'' (around, by), after which the accusative case is always used, and ''an'' (at), ''auf'' (on), ''entlang'' (along), ''hinter'' (behind), ''in'' (in, into), ''neben'' (beside, next to), ''\u00fcber'' (over, across), ''unter'' (under, below), ''vor'' (in front of), ''zwischen'' (among, between) which can govern either the accusative or the dative. The latter prepositions take the accusative when motion or action is specified (being done into/onto the space), but take the dative when location is specified (being done in/on that space). These prepositions are also used in conjunction with certain verbs, in which case it is the verb in question which governs whether the accusative or dative should be used.\n\nSome two-way prepositions can be contracted with ''das'':\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Preposition\n! + das\n|-\n| an\n| ans\n|-\n| auf\n| aufs\n|-\n| hinter\n| hinters\n|-\n| in\n| ins\n|-\n| \u00fcber\n| \u00fcbers\n|-\n| unter\n| unters\n|-\n| vor\n| vors\n|}\n\n=====German adjectives=====\nAdjective endings also change in the accusative case. Another factor that determines the endings of adjectives is whether the adjective is being used after a definite article (the), after an indefinite article (a/an) or without any article before the adjective (''many'' green apples).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n! Neuter\n! Plural\n|-\n| Definite article\n| -en\n| -e\n| -e\n| -en\n|-\n| Indefinite Article\n| -en\n| -e\n| -es\n| -en\n|-\n| No article\n| -en\n| -e\n| -es\n| -e\n|}\n\n=====German adverbial use=====\nIn German, the accusative case is also used for some adverbial expressions, mostly temporal ones, as in \"''Diesen Abend bleibe ich daheim''\" (This evening I'm staying at home), where \"''diesen Abend''\" is marked as accusative, although not a direct object.\n\n==== Russian ====\nIn Russian, the accusative (\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439) is used not only to indicate the direct object of an action, but also to indicate the destination or goal of motion. It is also used with some prepositions. The prepositions ''\u0432'' and ''\u043d\u0430'' can both take the accusative in situations where they indicate the goal of a motion.\n\nIn the [[Grammatical gender|masculine]], Russian also distinguishes between [[animacy|animate and inanimate]] nouns with regard to the accusative; only the animates carry a [[marker (linguistics)|marker]] in this case.\n\nOver time, Russian has almost lost the real PIE accusative case, since only singular nouns ending in 'a' have a distinct form. Other words use the forms of the genitive case or the nominative case in place of the accusative, depending on their [[animacy]].\n\n==== Armenian ====\nWhile the [[Armenian language|Armenian]] dialects both have a [[de facto]] accusative case, Eastern Armenian uses an accusative marker for transitive verbs<ref>[http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Armenian_Language_Lessons_Chapter_2#Accusative_case Armenian Language Lessons Chapter 2] Armeniapedia</ref>\n\nExample:\n\n\u0563\u056b\u0580\u0584 - girkh - book (Nominative)<br/>\n\u0578\u0582\u057d\u0578\u0582\u0581\u056b\u0579 - usuchi\u010dh - teacher (Nominative)\n\n\u0531\u0580\u0561\u0574\u0568 \u057e\u0565\u0580\u0581\u0580\u0565\u0581 \u0563\u056b\u0580\u0584<u>\u0568</u>: <br/>\nAram\u00eb verchrech girkh<u>\u00eb</u><br/>\nAram took the book.\n\n\u0531\u0580\u0561\u0574\u0568 \u057d\u056b\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0574 \u0567 \u056b\u0580 \u0578\u0582\u057d\u0578\u0582\u0581\u0579<u>\u056b\u0576</u>: <br/>\nAram\u00eb sirum \u0113 ir usuch\u010dh<u>in</u><br/>\nAram loves his teacher.\n\n==== Greek ====\nIn both [[Ancient Greek grammar|Ancient]] and [[Modern Greek grammar|Modern Greek]], nouns, adjectives, verb participles, articles and pronouns are used in the accusative case, when they indicate a direct object or if they are preceded by a preposition. There is a wide variety of accusative markers depending on gender, number and declension. Like in Latin, all neuter names yield the same form in both the nominative and the accusative case in Ancient Greek. In its modern successor, this rule also extends to most feminine nouns, except these ending to -\u03bf\u03c2.\n\nExample: \"''He was also calumniating [[Socrates]].''\"\n* In Ancient Greek: ''\"\u0394\u03b9\u03ad\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 '''\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd''' \u03a3\u03c9\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4'''\u03b7\u03bd'''.\" (Di\u00e9balle de kai '''ton''' S\u014dkr\u00e1t'''\u0113n'''.)''\n* In Modern Greek: ''\"\u0394\u03b9\u03ad\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 '''\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd''' \u03a3\u03c9\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4'''\u03b7'''.\" (Di\u00e9valle ke '''ton''' Sokr\u00e1t'''i'''.)''\n\n===Constructed languages===\n\n==== Esperanto ====\n[[Esperanto grammar]] involves only two cases, a nominative and an accusative. The accusative is formed by the addition of ''-n'' to the nominative form, and is the case used for direct objects. (Example: ''knabo'' (\"boy\") \u2192 ''knabon'' (\"boy.ACC\")) Other case functions, including dative functions, are achieved with prepositions, all of which normally take the nominative case. Direction of motion can be expressed either by the accusative case, or by the preposition ''al'' (to) with the nominative.\n\n==== Ido ====\nIn [[Ido (language)|Ido]] the ''-n'' suffix is optional, as [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] order is assumed when it is not present. Note that this is sometimes done in Esperanto{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}, especially by beginners, but it is considered incorrect while in Ido it is the norm.\n\n===Uralic languages===\n\n==== Finnish ====\nAccording to traditional Finnish grammars, the accusative is the case of a total object, while the case of a partial object is the [[partitive case|partitive]]. The negative forms of verbs always take the partial object, whereas in positive sentences it depends on the nature of the action, the main rule being that incomplete or indefinite action requires a partial object.\n\nThe accusative singular is identical either to the [[nominative case|nominative]] (often called nominative-accusative) or the [[genitive case|genitive]] (genitive-accusative). In plural, only nominative-accusative exists. The active verb forms usually require the total object in the genitive-accusative and passive forms take the nominative-accusative. The only exceptions to this rule are imperative first and second persons, and the rarely used third infinitive in instructive, which take the total object in nominative-accusative.\n\nThe [[personal pronoun]]s and the personal [[interrogative pronoun]] ''kuka/ken'' have a special accusative form ending in ''-t'' which is used in place of both nominative-accusative and genitive-accusative. For example, the accusative form of ''h\u00e4n'' (he/she) is ''h\u00e4net'', and the accusative form of ''kuka'' (or ''ken'') is ''kenet''.\n\nThe major new Finnish grammar, ''[[Iso suomen kielioppi]]'', breaks with the traditional classification by limiting the accusative case to the special case of the personal pronouns and ''kuka/ken''. The new grammar considers other total objects as being in the nominative or genitive case.\n\n==== Hungarian ====\nThe accusative case in Hungarian applies to nouns, pronouns; even to adjectives and numerals when either of them stands alone in the sense of direct object.\n\nAccusative is formed by the suffix '''''-t'''''. In many cases, ''-t'' is preceded by a suffix-initial vowel, primarily based on specific [[vowel harmony]], resulting in ''-et'', ''-ot'', or ''-\u00f6t''. The rules are complex, also involve consonants, and have exceptions. Thus: k''e''rt''et'' \"garden\", k''\u00e9''k''et'' \"blue\"; h''a''t''o''t \"six\"; p''o''lc''ot'' \"shelf\"; k''\u00f6''d''\u00f6t'' \"fog\".\n\nIn some words, a low vowel ''a'' or ''e'' appears instead of the expected harmonic vowel: e.g. fal''at'' (\u02e3fal''ot'') \"wall\"; nyolc''at'' (\u02e3nyolc''ot'') \"eight\"; k\u00f6nyv''et'' (\u02e3k\u00f6nyv''\u00f6t'') \"book\".\n\nIn fewer cases, the root of the word is also affected. Word endings ''-a'' or ''-e'' will (even if they are the endings of a preceding suffix) change to ''-\u00e1'' and ''-\u00e9'', respectively, before ''-t''. E.g.: f''a'' (tree) -> f'''''\u00e1t'''''. The long vowel of a one-syllable word may get shortened. E.g.: \u00far (lord) -> ''u''r'''''at'''''. But: b''\u00fa''r (Boer) -> b''\u00fa''r'''''t'''''. If a word has more than one syllable and the last syllable ends in a consonant, the vowel of the last syllable may drop. E.g.: k\u00f6r\u00f6m (fingernail) -> ''k\u00f6rm'''\u00f6t'''''. But: k\u00f6r''\u00f6m'' (''my'' circle) -> k\u00f6r\u00f6m'''''et'''''. Notably, the first-person and second-person personal pronouns have quite unique accusative forms (indeed, as indicated in the table, in the singular case the ending ''-et'' is rather optional, even considered archaic).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!

It is succession in a Church which witnesses to the apostolic faith, in communion with the other Churches, witnesses of the same apostolic faith. The \"see (''[[cathedra]]'') plays an important role in inserting the bishop into the heart of ecclesial apostolicity\",  but, once ordained, the bishop becomes in his Church the guarantor of apostolicity and becomes a successor of the apostles.<ref>{{citation |title=The Mystery of the Church and of the Eucharist in the Light of the Mystery of the Holy Trinity |chapter=II,4 |url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/ch_orthodox_docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_19820706_munich_en.html |year=1982}}</ref><ref name=Finland1988>{{citation |title=The Sacrament of Order in the Sacramental Structure of the Church with Particular Reference to the Importance of Apostolic Succession for the Santification and Unity of the People of God |chapter=Apostolic succession |url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/ch_orthodox_docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_19880626_finland_en.html |year=1988}}</ref>\n\nThose who hold for the importance of apostolic succession via episcopal [[Christian laying on of hands|laying on of hands]] appeal to the [[New Testament]], which, they say, implies a personal apostolic succession (from [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] to [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] and [[Apostle Titus|Titus]], for example).

Further, proponents of the necessity of the personal apostolic succession of bishops within the Church point to the universal practice of the undivided early Church (up to AD 431), before being divided into the [[Church of the East]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

ITC says that the apostles or their closest assistants or their successors directed the local colleges of ''episkopoi'' and ''presbyteroi'' by the end of the first century; while by the beginning of the second century the figure of a single bishop, as the head of the communities, appears explicitly in the letters of [[Ignatius of Antioch]] ({{circa}} 35-107).<ref name=ITC1973/> In the ''Epistle to the Smyrnaeans'', Ignatius wrote about three degrees ministry:\n<blockquote>\"See that you all follow the ''bishop'', even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the ''presbytery'' as you would the apostles; and reverence the ''deacons'', as being the institution of God.

They see it as one of [[Four Marks of the Church|four elements]] that define the true Church of Jesus Christ<ref>Oskar Sommel, ''Rudolf St\u00e4hlin Christliche Religion,'' Frankfurt 1960, p.19</ref> and legitimize the ministry of its clergy, since only a bishop within the succession can perform valid ordinations, and only bishops and [[Priesthood|presbyters (priests)]] ordained by bishops in the apostolic succession can validly celebrate (or \"confect\") several of the other [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]], including the [[Eucharist]], [[Confession (religion)|reconciliation of penitents]], [[confirmation]] and [[anointing of the sick]]. [[Everett Ferguson]] argued that [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], in ''Apostolic Tradition 9'', is the first known source to state that only bishops have the authority to ordain; and normally at least three bishops were required to ordain another bishop ([[First Council of Nicaea]], ''can''. 4).

Brown]] says that in the earlier stage (before the third century and perhaps earlier) there were plural bishops or overseers (\"presbyter-bishops\") in an individual community; in the later stage changed to only one bishop per community. Little is known about how the early bishops were formally chosen or appointed; afterwards the Church developed a regularized pattern of selection and ordination of bishops, and from the third century on that was universally applied. Brown asserts that the ministry was not ordained by the Church to act on its own authority, but as an important part to continue the ministry of Jesus Christ and helps to make the Church what it is.<ref name=Brown101>{{cite book |title=101 Questions and Answers on the Bible |author=Raymond E. Brown |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2003 |isbn=9780809142514 |pages=119\u2013122}}</ref>\n\nRaymond E. Brown also states that by the early second century, as written in the letters of [[Ignatius of Antioch]], in the threefold structure of the single bishop, plural presbyters, and plural deacons, the celebration of the Eucharist is assigned to the bishop alone; the bishop may delegate others when he goes away. At the [[Last Supper]], Jesus says to those present, who were or included the [[Twelve Apostles]], \"Do this in commemoration of me,\" Brown presumes that the Twelve were remembered as presiding at the Eucharist. But they could scarcely have been present at all the Eucharists of the first century, and no information in New Testament whether a person was regularly assigned to do this task and, if so, who that person was. After all the Church regulated and regularized the celebration of the Eucharist, as that was an inevitable establishment if communities were to be provided regularly with the 'bread of life', since it could not rely on gratuitous provision.<ref name=Brown101/>\n\n===Objections to the transmission of grace theory===\nAccording to [[William Griffith Thomas]], some Protestants have objected that this theory is not explicitly found in Scripture, and the New Testament uses 'bishop' and 'presbyter' as alternative names for the same office.<ref name=\"gt\">Thomas, Griffith. ''The Principles of Theology''. Church Book Room Press:1963, p.357</ref> [[Michael Ramsey]] argued it is not clearly found in the writings of the Fathers before [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] in the fourth century and there were attempts to read it back as implicit in earlier writers.<ref>Ramsey, Arthur Michael. ''The Gospel and the Catholic Church'' (translated from the Spanish edition published in the Dominican Republic: 1964, p.136)</ref>\n\nFor example, [[C. K. Barrett]] points out that the Pastoral Epistles are concerned that ministers of the generation of Timothy and Titus should pass on the doctrine they had received to the third generation. According to Barrett, teaching and preaching are \"the main, almost the only, activities of ministry.\"  He argues that in [[Clement of Rome]] ministerial activity is liturgical: the undifferentiated 'presbyter-bishops' are to \"make offerings to the Lord at the right time and in the right places\" something which is simply not defined by the evangelists. He also mentions the change in the use of sacrificial language as a more significant still: for Paul the Eucharist is a receiving of gifts from God, the Christian sacrifice is the offering of one's body (Romans 12:1).<ref name=Barrett>Barrett, C.K. ''Church, Ministry and Sacraments in the New Testament'' Paternoster Press: 1993</ref>{{rp|92f}} Moving on to [[Ignatius of Antioch]], Barrett states that a sharp distinction found between 'presbyter' and 'bishop': the latter now stands out as \"an isolated figure\" who is to be obeyed and without whom it is not lawful to baptise or hold a love-feast.<ref name=Barrett/>{{rp|94f}} He also points out that when Ignatius writes to the Romans, there is no mention of a bishop of the Roman Church, \"which we may suppose had not yet adopted the monarchical episcopate.\"<ref name=Barrett/>{{rp|95}} Jalland{{who |date=August 2015}} comes to a similar conclusion and locates the change from the \"polyepiscopacy\" of the [[house church]] model in Rome, to monepiscopacy as occurring before the middle of the second century.<ref>Jalland, Trevor Gervaise. ''The Church and the Papacy''. SPCK: 1944, pp.80ff</ref><br />\n\nSimilar objections are voiced by Harvey{{who |date=August 2015}} who comments that there is a \"strong and ancient tradition\" that the presence of an ordained man is necessary for the celebration of the Eucharist. But, according to him, there is \"certainly no evidence for this view in the New Testament\" and in the case of Clement of Rome and Ignatius of Antioch the implication is not that it ''cannot'' be celebrated by anyone else, but that it ''ought'' not. Harvey says in the third century this \"concern for propriety\" begins to be displaced by the concept of 'power' to do so which means that in the absence of such a man it is \"literally impossible\" for a Eucharist to be celebrated.<ref>Harvey, A.E. ''Priest or President?''. SPCK:1975, pp.45f</ref>\n\n==Apostolicity as doctrinal and related continuity==\nSome [[Protestant]] denominations, not including Scandinavian Lutherans, Anglicans and Moravians, deny the need of maintaining episcopal continuity with the early Church, holding that the role of the apostles was that, having been chosen directly by Jesus as witnesses of his resurrection, they were to be the \"special instruments of the Holy Spirit in founding and building up the Church\".<ref name=Litton>Litton, E.A. ''Introduction to Dogmatic Theology''. James Clarke & C\u00b0: 1960, p.388-389</ref> E.A. Litton{{who |date=August 2015}} argues that the Church is \"built upon 'the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles' (Ephes. ii. 20), but a foundation does not repeat itself\"; therefore he says that when the apostles died, they were replaced by their writings.<ref name=Litton/> To share with the apostles the same faith, to believe their word as found in the Scriptures, to receive the same Holy Spirit, is to many Protestants the only meaningful \"continuity\". The most meaningful ''apostolic succession'' for them, then, is a \"faithful succession\" of apostolic teaching.\n\n[[Max Thurian]], before his conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1988, described the classic [[Reformed]]/[[Presbyterian]] concept of apostolic succession in the following terms. \"The Christian ministry is not derived from the people but from the pastors; a scriptural ordinance provides for this ministry being renewed by the ordination of a presbyter by presbyters; this ordinance originates with the apostles, who were themselves presbyters, and through them it goes back to Christ as its source.\".<ref>quoted by Thurian from a report to the 1911 General Assembly of the Church of Scotland</ref>  Then he continued:\n:\"it does not guarantee the continuity and faithfulness of the Church. A purely historical or mechanical succession of ministers, bishops or pastors would not mean ''ipso facto'' true apostolic succession in the church, Reformed tradition, following authentic Catholic tradition, distinguishes four realities which make up the true apostolic succession, symbolized, but not absolutely guaranteed, by ministerial succession.\"<ref name=\"Thurian\">Thurian, Max. ''Priesthood & Ministry''. Paula Clifford (tr) Mowbrays: 1983, pp.167f</ref>\nAt the same time Thurian argued that the realities form a \"composite faithfulness\" and are (i) \"perseverance in the apostolic doctrine\"; (ii) \"the will to proclaim God's word\"; (iii) \"communion in the fundamental continuity of the Church, the Body of Christ, the faithful celebration of Baptism and the Eucharist\"; (iv) \"succession in the laying on of hands, the sign of ministerial continuity\".<ref name=\"Thurian\" />\n\nAccording to [[Walter Kasper]], the Reformed-Catholic dialogue came to belief that there is an apostolic succession which is important to the life of the Church, though both sides distinguish the meaning of that succession. Besides, the dialogue states that apostolic succession \"consists at least in continuity of apostolic doctrine, but this is not in opposition to succession through continuity of ordained ministry\" (''Ref I'', 100).<ref name=Kasper>{{cite book |title=Harvesting the Fruits: Basic Aspects of Christian Faith in Ecumenical Dialogue |author=Walter Kasper |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=9781441136817}}</ref>{{rp|85}} While the Lutheran-Catholic dialogue distinguishes between apostolic succession in faith (in substantive meaning) and apostolic succession as ministerial succession of bishops; agreed that \"succession in the sense of the succession of ministers must be seen within the succession of the whole church in the apostolic faith\" (''Ministry'', 61; cf. ''Malta'', 48).<ref name=Kasper/>{{rp|84}}\n\n[[Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church]] asserts that apostolic succession means something more than just a transmission of authorities; it witnesses to the apostolic faith from the same apostolic faith, and in communion with other Churches (attached to the apostolic communion). Apostolic tradition deals with the community, not only an ordained bishop as an isolated person. Since the bishop, once ordained, becomes the guarantor of apostolicity and successor of the apostles; he joins together all the bishops, thus maintaining ''episkope'' of the local Churches derived from the college of the apostles.<ref name=Finland1988/>\n\n==Churches claiming apostolic succession==\n\nChurches that claim some form of [[historical episcopate|episcopal apostolic succession]], dating back to the apostles or to leaders from the apostolic era,<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01648b.htm Apostolicity] [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article</ref> include the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]], the [[Church of the East]], the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Communion]], some [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches (see [[#Lutheran churches|below]]), [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/restoration-of-the-gospel?lang=eng|title=Restoration of the Priesthood|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints|website=www.lds.org}}</ref> and other smaller bodies incorporating the term \"Catholic\". The [[Anglican Communion]] (see [[#Anglican Churches|below]]) and those Lutheran churches which claim apostolic succession do not specifically teach this but exclusively practice episcopal ordination. While some Anglicans claim it for their communion, their views are often nuanced and there is widespread reluctance to 'unchurch' Christian bodies which lack it.<ref>Ramsey, Arthur Michael. ''From Gore to Temple'' Longmans: 1960, pp. 119\u201324</ref>\n\nRoman Catholics recognise the validity of the apostolic successions of the bishops, and therefore the rest of the clergy, of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, Old Catholic Church (Union of Utrecht only),{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and [[Polish National Catholic Church]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}. The Orthodox generally recognise Roman Catholic clerical orders as being of apostolic lineage, but have a different concept of the apostolic succession as it exists outside the canonical borders of the Orthodox Church, extending the term only to bishops who have maintained communion, received ordination from a line of apostolic bishops, and preserved the catholic faith once delivered through the apostles and handed down as [[Holy Tradition]]. The lack of apostolic succession through bishops is the primary basis on which Protestant denominations (barring some like Anglicans and Old Catholics) are not called ''Churches'', in the proper sense, by the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches, the latter referring to them as \"ecclesial communities\" in the official documents of the [[Second Vatican Council]].<ref name=\"vatican.va\">\"[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070629_responsa-quaestiones_en.htmlResponsesto Some Questions Regarding Certain Aspects of the Doctrine on the Church]\", published 10 July 2007.</ref>\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] also claims apostolic succession.  According to Mormon tradition, in 1829, [[Joseph Smith]] received the priesthood from Jesus' disciples Peter, James, and John.  After its establishment, each subsequent prophet and leader of the church have received the authority passed down by the [[laying on of hands]], or through apostolic succession. Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant Christians reject the claim that Smith possessed direct or indirect apostolic authority.\n\n==Apostolic founders==\n{{main article|Apostolic see}}\nAn early understanding of apostolic succession is represented by the traditional claims of various churches, as organised around important [[episcopal see]]s, to have been founded by specific apostles. On the basis of these traditions, the churches claim to have inherited specific authority, doctrines and/or practices on the authority of their founding apostle(s), which is understood to be continued by the bishops of the [[apostolic throne]] of the church that each founded and whose original leader he was. Thus:\n\n*The [[episcopal see|See]] of [[Holy See|Rome]] claims to have been founded by [[Saint Peter|Simon Peter]] (traditionally called the \"Chief of the Apostles\") and [[Saint Paul]].\n*The

of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints claims apostolic succession.  Joseph Smith was visited in 1829 by Peter, James, and John (three of the original 12 apostles) and by the laying on of hands, gave him the keys of the priesthood.  These keys have been since passed down by the laying on of hands to subsequent leaders of the church (aka, apostolic succession).\n\n==Teachings==\nTeachings on the nature of Apostolic Succession vary depending on the ecclesiastic body, especially within various Protestant denominations. Christians of the [[Church of the East]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] all recognize the validity of each other's apostolic succession. Among the previously mentioned churches opinions vary as to the validity of succession within [[Old Catholic]], [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]], [[Moravian Church|Moravian]], and  [[Lutheran]] communities. Roman Catholics deny the validity of all Sacraments by Protestant Churches with an \"episcopal polity\" whilst the Church of the East has very little stance on the matter entirely. Opinions within the Orthodox churches are often inconclusive. Episcopal Protestants typically recognize the validity of the four traditional apostolic churches.\n\n===Catholic Church===\n{{quote box|align=right|width=25%|quote=Wherefore we must obey the priests of the Church who have succession from the Apostles, as we have shown, who, together with succession in the episcopate, have received the mark of truth according to the will of the Father; all others, however, are to be suspected, who separated themselves from the principal succession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103426.htm |title=Adversus Haereses (Book IV, Chapter 26) |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>|source=[[Irenaeus]]}}\n\nIn [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] theology, the doctrine of apostolic succession is that the apostolic tradition - including apostolic teaching, preaching, and authority - is handed down from the college of apostles to the college of [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]] through the laying on of hands, as a permanent office in the Church.<ref>{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|date=2002|publisher=Catholic Church|location=Vatican City|pages=77, 861}}</ref> Historically, this has been understood as a succession in office, a succession of valid ordinations, or a succession of the entire college.

The Catholic Church has traditionally claimed a unique leadership role for the Apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]], believed to have been named by Jesus as head of the Apostles and as a focus of their unity, who became the first Bishop of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]], and whose successors inherited the role and accordingly became the leaders of the worldwide Church as well. Even so, Catholicism acknowledges the papacy is built on apostolic succession, not the other way around. As such, apostolic succession is a foundational doctrine of authority in the Catholic Church.<ref>\"If the very order of episcopal succession is to be considered, how much more surely, truly, and safely do we number them from Peter himself, to whom, as to one representing the whole Church, the Lord said, \u2018Upon this rock I will build my Church\u2019....{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|16:18}} Peter was succeeded by Linus, Linus by Clement, Clement by Anacletus, Anacletus by Evaristus...\" (St. Augustine; Letters 53:1:2 [A.D. 412]).</ref><ref>The Roman Catholic position is summarised this way: \"The Lord says to Peter: \u2018I say to you,\u2019 he says, \u2018that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it ....\u2019{{bibleref2c|Mt.|16:18}} On him [Peter] he builds the Church, and to him he gives the command to feed the sheep,{{bibleref2c|Jn|21:17}} and although he assigns a like power to all the apostles, yet he founded a single chair [cathedra], and he established by his own authority a source and an intrinsic reason for that unity....

The apostles then passed on this office and authority by ordaining bishops to follow after them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect2chpt3art9p3.shtml#861 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, #861\u2013862 |publisher=Old.usccb.org |date=14 December 1975 |accessdate=18 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729121143/http://old.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect2chpt3art9p3.shtml |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nRoman Catholic theology holds that the apostolic succession effects the power and authority to administer the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]] except for [[baptism]] and [[matrimony]]. (Baptism may be administered by anyone and matrimony by the couple to each other.) Authority to so administer such sacraments is passed on only through the sacrament of [[Holy Orders]], a rite by which a priest is ordained (ordination can be conferred only by bishop). The bishop, of course, must be from an unbroken line of bishops stemming from the original apostles selected by Jesus Christ. Thus, apostolic succession is necessary for the valid celebration of the sacraments.<ref name=ITC1973/>\n\nOn 29 June 2007, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith explained why apostolic succession is integral to, and indeed, \"a constitutive element\" of the Church. In response to the question why the [[Second Vatican Council]] and other official statements of the Catholic Church do not call Protestant Christian Communities \"Churches\", it stated that \"according to Catholic doctrine, these Communities do not enjoy ''apostolic succession'' in the sacrament of Orders, and are, therefore, deprived of a constitutive element of the Church. These ecclesial Communities which, specifically because of the absence of the sacramental priesthood, have not preserved the genuine and integral substance of the Eucharistic Mystery cannot, according to Catholic doctrine, be called 'Churches' in the proper sense\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070629_responsa-quaestiones_en.html |title=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, '&#39;Responses to some questions regarding certain aspects of the doctrine of the Church'&#39; |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=18 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Views concerning other churches====\n[[File:Leo XIII.jpg|thumb|upright|Pope Leo XIII rejected Anglican arguments for apostolic succession in his bull ''Apostolicae curae''.]]\nIn the Catholic Church, [[Pope Leo XIII]] stated in his 1896 [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Apostolicae curae]]'' that the [[Catholic Church]] believes specifically that the Anglican consecrations are \"absolutely null and utterly void\" because of changes made to the rite of consecration during the 16th century under [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], thus denying that Anglicans participate in the apostolic succession.

Accordingly, these Protestants strip the notion of apostolic succession from the definition of \"apostolic\" or \"apostolicity.\" For them, to be apostolic is simply to be in submission to the teachings of the original twelve apostles as recorded in Scripture.<ref>Martin E. Marty, ''A Short History of Christianity'' (New York: Meridian Books 1959) at 75\u201377 (traditional doctrine).</ref> This doctrinal stance reflects the Protestant view of authority, embodied in the doctrine known as [[Sola Scriptura]].\n\nAmong the first who rejected the doctrine of apostolic succession were [[John Calvin]],<ref>Cf., John Calvin, ''Institutio Christianae Religionis'' 1536, 5th ed. 1559; translated by John Allen as ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'' (London 1813; reprinted Philadelphia: Presbyterian Board of Publications, 6th ed. 1921), 2 volumes.</ref> and [[Martin Luther]].<ref>Martin Luther ''The Bondage of the Will'' (1525)</ref> They both said that the episcopacy was inadequate to address corruption, doctrinal or otherwise, and that this inadequacy justified the intervention of the church of common people. In part this position was also necessary, as otherwise there would have been no means to elicit or initiate reform of the church.\n\nIn the 20th century, there has been more contact between Protestants and Christians from Eastern traditions which claim apostolic succession for their ministry. Like the Roman Catholic Church, these ancient Eastern churches may use the doctrine of apostolic succession in ministry in their apologetics against some forms of Protestantism. Some Protestants feel that such claims of apostolic succession are proven false by the differences in traditions and doctrines between these churches: Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox consider both the [[Church of the East]] and the [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches to be heretical, having been anathematized in the early ecumenical councils of [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]] (431) and [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] (451) respectively. However, churches that claim apostolic succession in ministry distinguish this from doctrinal orthodoxy, holding that \"it is possible to have valid orders coming down from the apostles, and yet not to have a continuous spiritual history coming down from the apostles\".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=Knox+%22orders+coming+down+from+the+apostles%22&btnG |first=Ronald |last=Knox |title=In Soft Garments |publisher=Ignatius Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-58617-300-5  |accessdate=18 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nAll Christians who have a genuine relationship with God through and in Christ are part of the \"true Church\", according to exemplary statements of evangelical Protestant theology, notwithstanding condemnation of the Catholic Church by some Protestants.<ref>But cf., Mark A. Noll and Carolyn Nystrom, ''Is the Reformation Over? An evangelical assessment of contemporary Roman Catholicism'' (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic 2005).</ref> According to these statements, claims that one or more denominations might be the \"true Church\" are nothing more than propaganda which has evolved over centuries to support authoritarian claims\u2014based on tradition or based on scripture\u2014of merely human institutions.

It is a white solid, but impure samples can appear yellowish.  It dissolves well in water to give mildly acidic solutions.  It is a mild [[redox|reducing agent]].\n\nAscorbic acid exists as two [[enantiomer]]s (mirror-image [[isomer]]s), commonly denoted \"<small>L</small>\" (for \"levo\") and \"<small>D</small>\" (for \"dextro\"). The <small>L</small> isomer is the one most often ecountered: it occurs naturally in many foods, and is one form (\"[[vitamer]]\") of [[vitamin C]], an essential nutrient for humans and many animals. Deficiency of vitamin C causes [[scurvy]], formerly a major disease of sailors in long sea voyages. It is used in as a [[food additive]] and a [[dietary supplement]] for its [[antioxidant]] properties. The \"<small>D</small>\" form can be made [[chemical synthesis]] but has no significant biological role.\n\n==History==\n<!--Please try to restrict this section to the history of the chemistry of the compound.  The medical aspects belong more properly to the [[scurvy]] and [[vitamin C]] articles.-->\nThe [[scurvy|antiscorbutic]] properties of certain foods were demonstrated in the 18th century by [[James Lind]]. In 1907, [[Axel Holst]] and [[Theodor Fr\u00f8lich]] discovered that the antiscorbutic factor was a water-soluble chemical substance, distinct from the one that prevented [[beriberi]]. Between 1928 to 1932, [[Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi]] isolated a candidate for this substance, which he called it \"hexuronic acid\", first from plants and later from animal adrenal glands. In 1932 [[Charles Glen King]] confirmed that it was indeed the antiscorbutic factor.\n\nIn 1933, sugar chemist [[Norman Haworth|Walter Norman Haworth]], working with samples of \"hexuronic acid\" that Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi had isolated from [[paprika]] and sent him in the previous year, deduced the correct structure and optical-isomeric nature of the compound, and in 1934 reported its first synthesis.<ref>[https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/WG/Views/Exhibit/narrative/szeged.html Story of Vitamin C's chemical discovery].

The ascorbate anion is stabilized by electron delocalization that results from [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] between two forms:\n:[[File:Ascorbate resonance.png|400px]]\nFor this reason, ascorbic acid is much more acidic than would be expected if the compound contained only isolated hydroxyl groups.\n\n===Salts===\nThe ascorbate anion forms [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], such as [[sodium ascorbate]], [[calcium ascorbate]], and [[potassium ascorbate]].\n\n===Esters===\nAscorbic acid can also react with organic acids as an [[alcohol (chemistry)|alcohol]] forming [[ester]]s such as [[ascorbyl palmitate]] and [[ascorbyl stearate]].\n\n===Nucleophilic attack===\n[[Nucleophile|Nucleophilic attack]] of ascorbic acid on a proton results in a 1,3-diketone: \n:[[Image:Ascorbic diketone.png|400px]]\n\n===Oxidation===\n[[File:L-Semidehydroascorbins\u00e4ure.svg|right|thumb|220px|Semidehydroascorbate acid radical]]\n[[File:Dehydroascorbic_acid_2.svg|right|thumb|220px|Dehydroascorbic acid]]\nThe ascorbate ion is the predominant species at typical biological pH values. It is a mild [[reducing agent]] and [[antioxidant]]. It is oxidized with loss of one electron to form a [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] [[cation]] and then with loss of a second electron to form [[dehydroascorbic acid]]. It typically reacts with oxidants of the [[reactive oxygen species]], such as the [[hydroxyl radical]]. \n\nAscorbic acid is special because it can transfer a single electron, owing to the resonance-stabilized nature of its own [[radical ion]], called [[dehydroascorbate|semidehydroascorbate]].

Sometimes these radicals initiate chain reactions. Ascorbate can terminate these chain radical reactions by [[electron transfer]].  The oxidized forms of ascorbate are relatively unreactive and do not cause cellular damage.\n\nHowever, being a good electron donor, excess ascorbate in the presence of free metal ions can not only promote but also initiate free radical reactions, thus making it a potentially dangerous pro-oxidative compound in certain metabolic contexts.\n\nAscorbic acid and its sodium, potassium, and calcium [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]s are commonly used as [[antioxidant]] [[food additive]]s. These compounds are water-soluble and, thus, cannot protect [[fat]]s from oxidation: For this purpose, the fat-[[Solubility|soluble]] [[ester]]s of ascorbic acid with long-chain [[fatty acid]]s (ascorbyl palmitate or ascorbyl stearate) can be used as food antioxidants.\n\n===Other reactions===\nIt creates volatile compounds when mixed with [[glucose]] and [[amino acid]]s in 90&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Seck, S. |author2=Crouzet, J. | title = Formation of Volatile Compounds in Sugar-Phenylalanine and Ascorbic Acid-Phenylalanine Model Systems during Heat Treatment | journal = Journal of Food Science | year = 1981 | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 790\u2013793 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2621.1981.tb15349.x }}</ref>\n\nIt is a cofactor in [[tyrosine]] [[oxidation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Sealock, R.

In the first of a five-step process, glucose is catalytically [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] to [[sorbitol]], which is then [[redox|oxidized]] by the [[microorganism]] ''[[Acetic acid bacteria#Acetobacter|Acetobacter]] suboxydans'' to [[sorbose]]. Only one of the six hydroxy groups is oxidized by this enzymatic reaction.  From this point, two routes are available.  Treatment of the product with [[acetone]] in the presence of an acid [[Catalysis|catalyst]] converts four of the remaining [[hydroxyl]] groups to [[acetal]]s. The unprotected hydroxyl group is oxidized to the carboxylic acid by reaction with the catalytic oxidant [[TEMPO]] (regenerated by [[sodium hypochlorite]] \u2014 [[bleach]]ing solution). Historically, industrial preparation via the Reichstein process used [[potassium permanganate]] as the bleaching solution.  Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of this product performs the dual function of removing the two acetal groups and [[lactone|ring-closing lactonization]]. This step yields ascorbic acid. Each of the five steps has a yield larger than 90%.<ref>{{Ullmann | author = Eggersdorfer, M. |display-authors=etal| title = Vitamins | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a27_443 }}</ref>\n\nA more biotechnological process, first developed in China in the 1960s, but further developed in the 1990s,  bypasses the use of acetone-protecting groups.

Iodine is reduced by ascorbic acid, and, when all the ascorbic acid has reacted, the iodine is then in excess, forming a blue-black complex with the starch indicator.  This indicates the end-point of the titration. \n\nAs an alternative, ascorbic acid can be treated with iodine in excess, followed by back titration with sodium thiosulfate using starch as an indicator.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.saps.org.uk/attachments/article/556/simple_test_for_vitamin_c.pdf |title=A Simple Test for Vitamin C |journal=School Science Review |year=2002 |volume=83 |issue=305 |page=131 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704170133/http://www.saps.org.uk/attachments/article/556/simple_test_for_vitamin_c.pdf |archivedate=July 4, 2016}}</ref> \n\nThis iodometric method has been revised to exploit reaction of ascorbic acid with [[iodate]] and [[iodide]] in [[acid]] solution. Electrolyzing the solution of potassium iodide produces iodine, which reacts with ascorbic acid. The end of process is determined by [[potentiometric titration]] in a manner similar to [[Karl Fischer titration]]. The amount of ascorbic acid can be calculated by [[Faraday's laws of electrolysis|Faraday's law]].\n\nAnother alternative uses [[N-Bromosuccinimide|''N''-bromosuccinimide]] (NBS) as the oxidizing agent, in the presence of [[potassium iodide]] and starch. The NBS first oxidizes the ascorbic acid; when the latter is exhausted, the NBS liberates the iodine from the potassium iodide, which then forms the blue-black complex with starch.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Colour retention agent]]\n* [[Erythorbic acid]]: a [[diastereomer]] of ascorbic acid.\n* [[Mineral ascorbates]]: salts of ascorbic acid\n* [[Acids in wine]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{citation | last1 = Clayden | last2 = Greeves | last3 = Warren | last4 = Wothers | title = Organic Chemistry | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-19-850346-6}}.\n* {{citation | title = Vitamin C: Its Chemistry and Biochemistry | first1 = Michael B. | last1 = Davies | first2 = John | last2 = Austin | first3 = David A. | last3 = Partridge | publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry | isbn = 0-85186-333-7}}.\n* {{citation | title = Food: The Chemistry of Its Components | edition = 3rd | first = T.

Ajax also regularly supplies the Dutch national youth teams with local talent.\n\nDue to mutual agreements with foreign clubs, the youth academy has also signed foreign players as teenagers before making first team debuts, such as Belgian defensive trio [[Jan Vertonghen]], [[Toby Alderweireld]] and [[Thomas Vermaelen]] along with winger [[Tom De Mul]], all of whom are full internationals, as well as Dutch international [[Vurnon Anita]] and [[Javier Martina]], representing [[Cura\u00e7ao national football team|Cura\u00e7ao]].\n\nAjax has also expanded its talent searching programme to South Africa with [[Ajax Cape Town FC|Ajax Cape Town]]. Ajax Cape Town was set up with the help of Rob Moore. Ajax has also had a satellite club in the United States under the name [[Ajax Orlando Prospects|Ajax America]], until it filed for bankruptcy. There are some youth players from Ajax Cape Town that have been drafted into the Eredivisie squad, such as South African internationals [[Steven Pienaar]], [[Thulani Serero]] and Cameroonian international [[Eyong Enoh]].\n\nIn 1995, the year Ajax won the UEFA Champions League, the Netherlands national team was almost entirely composed of Ajax players, with Edwin van der Sar in goal; players such as Michael Reiziger, Frank de Boer and Danny Blind in defence; Ronald de Boer, Edgar Davids and Clarence Seedorf in midfield; and Patrick Kluivert and [[Marc Overmars]] in attack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/trainingground/grassroots/features/video/videoid=1562470.html |title=Inside the Ajax academy on |publisher=Uefa.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Ajax opened its first youth academies outside the Netherlands when the club partnered up with George Kazianis and All Star Consultancy in Greece to open the [[Ajax Hellas Youth Academy]].

Ajax later played in the stadium built for the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] hosted in Amsterdam. This stadium, designed by [[Jan Wils]], is known as the Olympic Stadium. In 1934, Ajax moved to [[De Meer Stadion]] in east Amsterdam, designed by architect and Ajax-member [[Jordanus Roodenburgh|Daan Roodenburgh]], who had also designed the club's first stadium. It could accommodate 29,500 spectators and Ajax continued to play there until 1996. For big European and national fixtures the club would often play at the Olympic Stadium, which could accommodate about twice the number of spectators.\n[[File:Amsterdam Arena Aerial.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the [[Johan Cruyff Arena]]]]\nIn 1996, Ajax moved to a new home ground in the southeast of the city known as the Amsterdam Arena, since 2018 known as the [[Johan Cruyff Arena]]. This stadium was built by the Amsterdam city authority at a cost of $134 million. The stadium is capable of holding approximately 54,990 spectators. The average attendance in 2006\u201307 was 48,610, rising in the next season to 49,128. The Arena has a retractable roof and set a trend for other modern stadiums built in Europe in the following years. In the Netherlands, the Arena has earned a reputation for a terrible grass pitch caused by the removable roof that, even when open, takes away too much sunlight and fresh air. During the 2008\u201309 season, ground staff introduced an artificial lighting system that has finally reduced this problem considerably.\n\nThe much-loved De Meer Stadion was torn down and the land was sold to the city council. A residential neighbourhood now occupies the area. The only thing left of the old stadium are the letters \"AJAX\", which nowadays is in place on the fa\u00e7ade of the youth training grounds [[Sportpark De Toekomst|De Toekomst]], near the Johan Cruyff Arena.\n\n==Crest and colours==\n\n===Crest===\nIn 1900, when the club was founded, the emblem of Ajax was just a picture of an Ajax player. The crest was slightly altered following the club's promotion to the top division in 1911 to match the club's new outfits. In 1928, the club logo was introduced with the head of the [[Greeks|Greek]] hero [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]]. The logo was once again changed in 1990 into an abstract version of the previous one. The new logo still sports the portrait of Ajax, but drawn with just 11 lines, symbolizing the 11 players of a football team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~michielh/hetlogo.html |title=History of the Ajax logo |publisher=Xs4all.nl |date=20 September 1928 |accessdate=4 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721231604/http://www.xs4all.nl/~michielh/hetlogo.html |archivedate=21 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n|[[File:Ajax Amsterdam (1900\u20131928).gif|thumbnail|130px|<center>The first Ajax crest<br/>(1900\u20131911)</center>]]\n|\n|[[File:Ajax Amsterdam (1911\u20131928).jpeg|thumbnail|130px|<center>The second crest<br/>(1911\u20131928)</center>]]\n|\n|[[File:Ajax Amsterdam (1928\u20131990).png|130px|thumbnail|<center>The third crest<br/>(1928\u20131990)</center>]]\n|\n|[[File:Ajax Amsterdam.svg|130px|thumbnail|<center>The current crest<br/>(1990\u2013present)</center>]]\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Colours===\nAjax originally played in an all-black uniform with a red sash tied around the players' waists, but that uniform was soon replaced by a red/white striped shirt and black shorts. Red, black and white are the three colours of the [[flag of Amsterdam]]. When under manager [[Jack Kirwan]], however, the club earned promotion to the top flight of Dutch football for the first time in 1911 (then the ''Eerste Klasse'' or 'First Class', later named the Eredivisie), Ajax were forced to change their colours because [[Sparta Rotterdam]] already had exactly the same outfit. Special kits for away fixtures did not exist at the time and according to football association regulations the newcomers had to change their colours if two teams in the same league had identical uniforms. Ajax opted for white shorts and white shirt with a broad, vertical red stripe over chest and back, which still is Ajax's outfit.\n\n==Financial==\n\n===AFC Ajax N.V.===\n{{Main|AFC Ajax N.V.}}\nAFC Ajax are the only Dutch club with an [[Initial public offering]] (IPO).

He was also a [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] and a populariser of science. The [[Eddington limit]], the natural limit to the [[luminosity]] of stars, or the radiation generated by accretion onto a compact object, is named in his honour.\n\nAround 1920, he anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars, in his paper \"The Internal Constitution of the Stars\".<ref name=eddington>The Internal Constitution of the Stars A. S. Eddington The Scientific Monthly Vol. 11, No. 4 (Oct., 1920), pp. 297-303 {{JSTOR|6491}}</ref><ref name=eddington2>{{cite journal|bibcode=1916MNRAS..77...16E|title=On the radiative equilibrium of the stars|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=77|pages=16\u201335|author1=Eddington|first1=A. S.|year=1916|doi=10.1093/mnras/77.1.16}}</ref> At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington was the first to correctly speculate that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium.\n\nHe is famous for his work concerning the [[theory of relativity]]. Eddington wrote a number of articles that announced and explained [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[general relativity]] to the English-speaking world. [[World War I]] severed many lines of scientific communication and new developments in German science were not well known in England.  He also conducted an expedition to observe the [[solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]] that provided one of the earliest confirmations of [[general relativity]], and he became known for his popular expositions and interpretations of the theory.\n\n==Early years==\nEddington was born 28 December 1882 in [[Kendal]], [[Westmorland]] (now [[Cumbria]]), England, the son of [[Quaker]] parents, Arthur Henry Eddington, headmaster of the Quaker School, and Sarah Ann Shout.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783\u20132002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref>\n\nHis father taught at a Quaker training college in Lancashire before moving to Kendal to become headmaster of Stramongate School. He died in the [[typhoid]] epidemic which swept England in 1884. His mother was left to bring up her two children with relatively little income. The family moved to [[Weston-super-Mare]] where at first Stanley (as his mother and sister always called Eddington) was educated at home before spending three years at a preparatory school.  The family lived at a house called Varzin, 42 Walliscote Road, Weston-super-Mare.  There is a commemorative plaque on the building explaining Sir Arthur's contribution to science.\n\nIn 1893 Eddington entered Brynmelyn School. He proved to be a most capable scholar, particularly in mathematics and English literature. His performance earned him a scholarship to Owens College, Manchester (what was later to become the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]]) in 1898, which he was able to attend, having turned 16 that year. He spent the first year in a general course, but turned to [[physics]] for the next three years. Eddington was greatly influenced by his physics and mathematics teachers, [[Arthur Schuster]] and [[Horace Lamb]]. At Manchester, Eddington lived at Dalton Hall, where he came under the lasting influence of the Quaker mathematician J. W. Graham. His progress was rapid, winning him several scholarships and he graduated with a B.Sc. in physics with First Class Honours in 1902.\n\nBased on his performance at Owens College, he was awarded a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1902. His tutor at Cambridge was [[Robert Alfred Herman]] and in 1904 Eddington became the first ever second-year student to be placed as [[Senior Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Senior Wrangler]].  After receiving his M.A. in 1905, he began research on [[thermionic emission]] in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]. This did not go well, and meanwhile he spent time teaching mathematics to first year engineering students. This hiatus was brief. Through a recommendation by [[E. T. Whittaker]], his senior colleague at Trinity College, he secured a position at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich where he was to embark on his career in astronomy, a career whose seeds had been sown even as a young child when he would often \"try to count the stars\".<ref name=Douglas1956 />\n[[File:Arthur Eddington.jpg|thumb|260x260px|Plaque at 42 Walliscote Road, Weston-super-Mare]]\n\n==Astronomy==\n\nIn January 1906, Eddington was nominated to the post of chief assistant to the [[Astronomer Royal]] at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]]. He left Cambridge for Greenwich the following month. He was put to work on a detailed analysis of the [[parallax]] of [[433 Eros]] on [[photographic plate]]s that had started in 1900. He developed a new statistical method based on the apparent drift of two background stars, winning him the [[Smith's Prize]] in 1907. The prize won him a Fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge. In December 1912 [[George Darwin]], son of [[Charles Darwin]], died suddenly and Eddington was promoted to his chair as the [[Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy]] in early 1913. Later that year, [[Robert Stawell Ball|Robert Ball]], holder of the theoretical [[Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry|Lowndean chair]] also died, and Eddington was named the director of the entire [[Cambridge Observatory]] the next year. In May 1914 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]: he was awarded the [[Royal Medal]] in 1928 and delivered the [[Bakerian Lecture]] in 1926.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27eddington%27%29| title = Library and Archive Catalogue| publisher = Royal Society| accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nEddington also investigated the interior of [[star]]s through theory, and developed the first true understanding of stellar processes. He began this in 1916 with investigations of possible physical explanations for [[Cepheid variables|Cepheid variable stars]].  He began by extending [[Karl Schwarzschild]]'s earlier work on radiation pressure in [[Lane-Emden equation|Emden polytropic models]]. These models treated a star as a sphere of gas held up against gravity by internal thermal pressure, and one of Eddington's chief additions was to show that radiation pressure was necessary to prevent collapse of the sphere. He developed his model despite knowingly lacking firm foundations for understanding opacity and energy generation in the stellar interior. However, his results allowed for calculation of temperature, [[density]] and [[pressure]] at all points inside a star, and Eddington argued that his theory was so useful for further astrophysical investigation that it should be retained despite not being based on completely accepted physics. [[James Jeans]] contributed the important suggestion that stellar matter would certainly be [[Ionization|ionized]], but that was the end of any collaboration between the pair, who became famous for their lively debates.\n\nEddington defended his method by pointing to the utility of his results, particularly his important [[mass-luminosity relation]]. This had the unexpected result of showing that virtually all stars, including giants and dwarfs, behaved as [[ideal gases]].  In the process of developing his stellar models, he sought to overturn current thinking about the sources of stellar energy. Jeans and others defended the [[Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz mechanism]], which was based on classical mechanics, while Eddington speculated broadly about the qualitative and quantitative consequences of possible proton-electron annihilation and nuclear fusion processes.\n\nAround 1920, he anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.<ref name=eddington/><ref name=eddington2/> At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein's equation ''E = mc<sup>2</sup>''. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered. Eddington's paper, based on knowledge at the time, reasoned that:\n\n:# The leading theory of stellar energy, the [[contraction hypothesis]], should cause stars' rotation to visibly speed up due to [[conservation of angular momentum]]. But observations of [[Cepheid]] variable stars showed this was not happening.\n:# The only other known plausible source of energy was conversion of matter to energy; Einstein had shown some years earlier that a small amount of matter was equivalent to a large amount of energy. \n:# [[Francis William Aston|Francis Aston]] had also recently shown that the mass of a [[helium]] atom was about 0.8% less than the mass of the four hydrogen atoms which would, combined, form a helium atom, suggesting that if such a combination could happen, it would release considerable energy as a byproduct.\n:# If a star contained just 5% of fusible hydrogen, it would suffice to explain how stars got their energy. (We now know that most 'ordinary' stars contain far more than 5% hydrogen)\n:# Further elements might also be fused, and other scientists had speculated that stars were the \"crucible\" in which light elements combined to create heavy elements, but without more accurate measurements of their [[atomic mass]]es nothing more could be said at the time.\n\nAll of these speculations were proven correct in the following decades.\n\nWith these assumptions, he demonstrated that the interior temperature of stars must be millions of degrees. In 1924, he discovered the [[Main sequence|mass-luminosity relation]] for [[star]]s (see Lecchini in [[#External links and references]] ).  Despite some disagreement, Eddington's models were eventually accepted as a powerful tool for further investigation, particularly in issues of stellar evolution.  The confirmation of his estimated stellar diameters by Michelson in 1920 proved crucial in convincing astronomers unused to Eddington's intuitive, exploratory style. Eddington's theory appeared in mature form in 1926 as ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars'', which became an important text for training an entire generation of astrophysicists.\n\nEddington's work in astrophysics in the late 1920s and the 1930s continued his work in stellar structure, and precipitated further clashes with Jeans and [[Edward Arthur Milne]]. An important topic was the extension of his models to take advantage of developments in [[quantum physics]], including the use of degeneracy physics in describing dwarf stars.\n\n===Dispute with Chandrasekhar on existence of black holes===\n\nThe topic of extension of his models precipitated his famous dispute with [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], who was then a student at Cambridge. Chandrasekhar's work presaged the discovery of [[black hole]]s, which at the time seemed so absurdly non-physical that Eddington refused to believe that Chandrasekhar's purely mathematical derivation had consequences for the real world. History clearly proved Eddington wrong, but his motivation remains a matter of some controversy. Chandrasekhar's narrative of this incident, in which his work is harshly rejected, portrays Eddington as rather cruel, dogmatic, and racist.  Eddington's criticism seems to have been based on a suspicion that a purely mathematical derivation from relativity theory was not enough to explain away the seemingly daunting physical paradoxes that were inherent to degenerate stars.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Padmanabhan | first1 = T.\n| title = The dark side of astronomy\n| doi = 10.1038/435020a\n| journal = Nature\n| volume = 435\n| issue = 7038\n| pages = 20\n| year = 2005\n| pmid =  \n| pmc = \n|bibcode = 2005Natur.435...20P }}</ref>\n\n==Relativity==\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Eddington was Secretary of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]], which meant he was the first to receive a series of letters and papers from [[Willem de Sitter]] regarding Einstein's theory of general relativity.

He quickly became the chief supporter and expositor of relativity in Britain. He and [[Astronomer Royal]] [[Frank Watson Dyson]] organized two expeditions to observe a [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse in 1919]] to make the first empirical test of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory: the measurement of the deflection of light by the sun's gravitational field. In fact, Dyson's argument for the indispensability of Eddington's expertise in this test was what prevented Eddington from eventually having to enter military service.<ref name=Douglas1956 /><ref name=Chandrasekhar1983 />\n\nWhen conscription was introduced in Britain on 2 March 1916, Eddington intended to apply for an exemption as a [[conscientious objector]].<ref name=Douglas1956 /> Cambridge University authorities instead requested and were granted an exemption on the ground of Eddington's work being of national interest. In 1918, this was appealed against by the [[Ministry of National Service]]. Before the appeal tribunal in June, Eddington claimed conscientious objector status, which was not recognized and would have ended his exemption in August 1918. A further two hearings took place in June and July, respectively. Eddington's personal statement at the June hearing about his objection to war based on religious grounds is on record.<ref name=Douglas1956 /> [[Astronomer Royal]], [[Sir Frank Dyson]], supported Eddington at the July hearing with a written statement, emphasising Eddington's essential role in the [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse]] expedition to Principe in May 1919. Eddington made clear his willingness to serve in the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]], under the jurisdiction of the British  [[Red Cross]], or as a harvest labourer. However, the tribunal's decision to grant a further twelve months exemption from military service was on condition of Eddington continuing his astronomy work, in particular in preparation for the Principe expedition.<ref name=Douglas1956 /><ref name=Chandrasekhar1983 /> The war ended before the end of his exemption.\n\n[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|260px|thumb|right|One of Eddington's photographs of the total [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]], presented in his 1920 paper announcing its success, confirming [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory that light \"bends\"]]\nAfter the war, Eddington travelled to the island of [[Pr\u00edncipe]] off the west coast of Africa to watch the [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]]. During the eclipse, he took pictures of the stars (several stars in the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades cluster]] include [[Kappa Tauri]] of the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]) in the region around the Sun.<ref name=\"Eddington1920\"/> According to the theory of [[general relativity]], stars with light rays that passed near the Sun would appear to have been slightly shifted because their light had been curved by its gravitational field. This effect is noticeable only during eclipses, since otherwise the Sun's brightness obscures the affected stars. Eddington showed that Newtonian gravitation could be interpreted to predict half the shift predicted by Einstein.\n\nEddington's observations published the next year<ref name=\"Eddington1920\">{{cite journal|last=Dyson|author2=Eddington, A.S.|author3=Davidson, C.R. |date=1920 |title=A Determination of the Deflection of Light by the Sun's Gravitational Field, from Observations Made at the Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|Phil.

The news was reported in newspapers all over the world as a major story. Afterward, Eddington embarked on a campaign to popularize relativity and the expedition as landmarks both in scientific development and international scientific relations.\n\nIt has been claimed that Eddington's observations were of poor quality, and he had unjustly discounted simultaneous observations at [[Sobral, Brazil]], which appeared closer to the Newtonian model, but a 1979 re-analysis with modern measuring equipment and contemporary software validated Eddington's results and conclusions.<ref>[http://xxx.arxiv.org/abs/0709.0685 Not Only Because of Theory: Dyson, Eddington and the Competing Myths of the 1919 Eclipse Expedition by Daniel Kennewick, published in Einstein and the Changing Worldview of Physics, 2012]</ref> The quality of the 1919 results was indeed poor compared to later observations, but was sufficient to persuade contemporary astronomers.  The rejection of the results from the Brazil expedition was due to a defect in the telescopes used which, again, was completely accepted and well understood by contemporary astronomers.<ref name=\"PhysToday\">[http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.3099578 D. Kennefick, \"Testing relativity from the 1919 eclipse&nbsp;\u2013 a question of bias,\" ''Physics Today,'' March 2009, pp. 37\u201342.]</ref>\n\nThroughout this period, Eddington lectured on relativity, and was particularly well known for his ability to explain the concepts in lay terms as well as scientific. He collected many of these into the ''Mathematical Theory of Relativity'' in 1923, which [[Albert Einstein]] suggested was \"the finest presentation of the subject in any language.\" He was an early advocate of Einstein's General Relativity, and an interesting anecdote well illustrates his humour and personal intellectual investment: [[Ludwik Silberstein]], a physicist who thought of himself as an expert on relativity, approached Eddington at the [[Royal Society]]'s (6 November) 1919 meeting where he had defended Einstein's Relativity with his Brazil-Principe Solar Eclipse calculations with some degree of skepticism, and ruefully charged Arthur as one who claimed to be one of three men who actually understood the theory (Silberstein, of course, was including himself and Einstein as the other). When Eddington refrained from replying, he insisted Arthur not be \"so shy\", whereupon Eddington replied, \"Oh, no! I was wondering who the third one might be!\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">As related by Eddington to Chandrasekhar and quoted in Walter Isaacson \"Einstein: His Life and Universe\", page 262</ref>\n\n==Cosmology==\nEddington was also heavily involved with the development of the first generation of general relativistic cosmological models. He had been investigating the instability of the Einstein universe when he learned of both [[Georges Lema\u00eetre|Lema\u00eetre's]] 1927 paper postulating an expanding or contracting universe and Hubble's work on the recession on the spiral nebulae. He felt the [[cosmological constant]] must have played the crucial role in the universe's evolution from an Einsteinian steady state to its current expanding state, and most of his cosmological investigations focused on the constant's significance and characteristics.  In ''The Mathematical Theory of Relativity,'' Eddington interpreted the cosmological constant to mean that the universe is \"self-gauging\".\n\n==Fundamental theory and the Eddington number==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Chandrasekhar limit]] & redirect [[Fundamental theory (Eddington)]] -->\nDuring the 1920s until his death, Eddington increasingly concentrated on what he called \"fundamental theory\" which was intended to be a unification of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], [[theory of relativity|relativity]], cosmology, and [[gravitation]]. At first he progressed along \"traditional\" lines, but turned increasingly to an almost [[numerology|numerological]] analysis of the dimensionless ratios of fundamental constants.\n\nHis basic approach was to combine several fundamental constants in order to produce a dimensionless number. In many cases these would result in numbers close to 10<sup>40</sup>, its square, or its square root. He was convinced that the mass of the [[proton]] and the charge of the [[electron]] were a ''natural and complete specification for constructing a Universe'' and that their values were not accidental. One of the discoverers of quantum mechanics, [[Paul Dirac]], also pursued this line of investigation, which has become known as the [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis]], and some scientists even today believe it has something to it.{{Citation needed|reason=Which scientists? What is the 'something'?|date=December 2016}}\n\nA somewhat damaging statement in his defence of these concepts involved the [[fine structure constant]], \u03b1. At the time it was measured to be very close to 1/136, and he argued that the value should in fact be exactly 1/136 for epistemological reasons. Later measurements placed the value much closer to 1/137, at which point he switched his line of reasoning to argue that one more should be added to the [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], so that the value should in fact be exactly 1/137, the [[Eddington number]]. Wags at the time started calling him \"Arthur Adding-one\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Kean, Sam|title=The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements|year=2010|location=New York|publisher=Little, Brown and Co|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cky2x4wWvEUC&pg=PT241&lpg=PT241}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}  This change of stance detracted from Eddington's credibility in the physics community. The [http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?alphinv|search_for=fine+structure+constant current measured value] is estimated at 1/137.035 999 074(44).\n\nEddington believed he had identified an algebraic basis for fundamental physics, which he termed \"E-numbers\" (representing a certain [[group (mathematics)|group]]&nbsp;\u2013 a [[Clifford algebra]]). These in effect incorporated [[spacetime]] into a higher-dimensional structure. While his theory has long been neglected by the general physics community, similar algebraic notions underlie many modern attempts at a [[grand unified theory]]. Moreover, Eddington's emphasis on the values of the fundamental constants, and specifically upon dimensionless numbers derived from them, is nowadays a central concern of physics. In particular, he predicted a number of hydrogen atoms in the Universe 136 \u00d7 2<sup>256</sup>, or equivalently the half of the total number of particles protons + electrons.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barrow |first=J.

The Eddington number in the context of cycling is defined as the maximum number E such that the cyclist has cycled E miles on E days.<ref>[http://physicsworldarchive.iop.org/index.cfm?action=summary&doc=18%2F11%2Fphwv18i11a30%40pwa-xml&qt= PhysicsWorld Archive \u00bb Volume 18 \u00bb Cycling record<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://tlatet.blogspot.com/2008/03/eddington-number.html Tlatet: Eddington number<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> For example, an Eddington number of 70 would imply that the cyclist has cycled at least 70 miles in a day on 70 occasions. Achieving a high Eddington number is difficult since moving from, say, 70 to 75 will probably require more than five new long distance rides since any rides shorter than 75 miles will no longer be included in the reckoning. Eddington's own E-number was 84.<ref>Physics World (Institute of Physics) July 2012 page 15</ref>\n\nThe Eddington number for cycling is analogous to the [[h-index|''h''-index]] that quantifies both the actual scientific productivity and the apparent scientific impact of a scientist.\n\nThe Eddington Number for cycling has units (indeed applying it to any physical property will result in E having units).  For example, an E of 62 miles means a cyclist has covered 62 or more miles on 62 or more days.  However, in units of kilometers the 62 miles becomes 100&nbsp;km. It is possible that the cyclist, while having covered 100&nbsp;km on 62 days or more, may '''not''' have covered 100&nbsp;km on 100 days or more. Thus the order of bicyclists may change depending on units used. Using the original miles, one cyclist may have an Eddington number of 60 \u2013 60 miles (97&nbsp;km) in 60 days, another of 50 (corresponding to 80&nbsp;km). However, the latter may be a regular on a distance like this and get a km-Eddington of 80, while the former only had those 60 days riding, and thus stays at a km-Eddington of 60.\n\n==Philosophy==\n\n===Idealism===\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}\nEddington wrote in his book ''The Nature of the Physical World'' that  \"The stuff of the world is mind-stuff.\"\n{{quote|The mind-stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual conscious minds ... The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it ... It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed, has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness ... Consciousness is not sharply defined, but fades into subconsciousness; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature ... It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character. But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience, and all else is remote inference.|Eddington, ''The Nature of the Physical World'', 276\u201381.}}\n\nThe [[idealist]] conclusion was not integral to his epistemology but was based on two main arguments.\n\nThe first derives directly from current physical theory. Briefly, mechanical theories of the ether and of the behaviour of fundamental particles have been discarded in both relativity and quantum physics. From this, Eddington inferred that a materialistic metaphysics was outmoded and that, in consequence, since the disjunction of materialism or idealism are assumed to be exhaustive, an idealistic metaphysics is required. The second, and more interesting argument, was based on Eddington's epistemology, and may be regarded as consisting of two parts. First, all we know of the objective world is its structure, and the structure of the objective world is precisely mirrored in our own consciousness. We therefore have no reason to doubt that the objective world too is \"mind-stuff\". Dualistic metaphysics, then, cannot be evidentially supported.\n\nBut, second, not only can we not know that the objective world is nonmentalistic, we also cannot intelligibly suppose that it could be material. To conceive of a dualism entails attributing material properties to the objective world. However, this presupposes that we could observe that the objective world has material properties. But this is absurd, for whatever is observed must ultimately be the content of our own consciousness, and consequently, nonmaterial.\n\n[[Ian Barbour]], in his book ''Issues in Science and Religion'' (1966), p.&nbsp;133, cites Eddington's ''The Nature of the Physical World'' (1928) for a text that argues the [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] [[Uncertainty principle|Uncertainty Principles]] provides a scientific basis for \"the defense of the idea of human freedom\" and his ''Science and the Unseen World'' (1929) for support of philosophical idealism \"the thesis that reality is basically mental\".\n\n[[Charles De Koninck]] points out that Eddington believed in objective reality existing apart from our minds, but was using the phrase \"mind-stuff\" to highlight the inherent intelligibility of the world: that our minds and the physical world are made of the same \"stuff\" and that our minds are the inescapable connection to the world.<ref name=\"de Koninck\">{{Cite book\n| publisher = University of Notre Dame Press\n| isbn = 978-0-268-02595-3\n| last = de Koninck\n| first = Charles\n| authorlink=Charles De Koninck\n| title = The writings of Charles de Koninck\n| location = Notre Dame, Ind.\n| date = 2008\n| oclc = 615199716\n| chapter = The philosophy of Sir Arthur Eddington and The problem of indeterminism\n}}</ref> As De Koninck quotes Eddington,\n\n{{quote|There is a doctrine well known to philosophers that the moon ceases to exist when no one is looking at it.

Many of these were gathered into books, including ''The Nature of the Physical World'' and ''New Pathways in Science''. His skillful use of literary allusions and humour helped make these famously difficult subjects quite accessible.\n\nEddington's books and lectures were immensely popular with the public, not only because of Eddington's clear and entertaining exposition, but also for his willingness to discuss the philosophical and religious implications of the new physics. He argued for a deeply rooted philosophical harmony between scientific investigation and religious mysticism, and also that the positivist nature of modern physics (i.e., relativity and quantum physics) provided new room for personal religious experience and free will. Unlike many other spiritual scientists, he rejected the idea that science could provide proof of religious propositions.\n\nHe is sometimes misunderstood as having promoted the [[infinite monkey theorem]] in his 1928 book ''The Nature of the Physical World'', with the phrase \"If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters, they might write all the books in the [[British Museum]]\". It is clear from the context that Eddington is not suggesting that the probability of this happening is worthy of serious consideration. On the contrary, it was a [[rhetorical]] illustration of the fact that below certain levels of probability, the term ''improbable'' is functionally equivalent to ''impossible''.\n\nHis popular writings made him a household name in Great Britain between the world wars.\n\n==Death==\nEddington died of cancer in the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 22 November 1944.

Perhaps most significantly, the Apple II was a catalyst for personal computers across many industries; it was responsible for opening the doors to software marketed at consumers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Overview==\nIn the May 1977 issue of [[Byte (magazine)|''Byte'']], [[Steve Wozniak]] published a detailed description of his design; the article began, \"To me, a personal computer should be small, reliable, convenient to use and inexpensive\".<ref name=\"wozniak197705\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1977-05/1977_05_BYTE_02-05_Interfacing#page/n35/mode/2up | title=System Description / The Apple-II | work=BYTE | date=May 1977 | accessdate=October 17, 2013 | author=Wozniak, Steve | pages=34\u201343}}</ref>\n\nThe Apple II used a multiplicity of idiosyncratic engineering shortcuts to save hardware and reduce costs. For example:\n\n* Taking advantage of the way that 6502 processor only accesses memory on alternate phases of the clock cycle, the video generation circuitry's memory access on the otherwise unused phase avoids memory contention issues and interruptions of the video stream. \n* This arrangement simultaneously eliminated the need for a separate [[Memory refresh|refresh]] circuit for the [[DRAM]] chips, as the video transfer accessed each row of the dynamic memory within the [[Memory refresh#Refresh interval|timeout]] period. In addition, it did not require separate RAM chips for the video RAM, while the PET and TRS-80 had SRAMs for the video.\n* Rather than use a complex [[analog-to-digital]] circuit to read the outputs of the game controller, Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period is proportional to the resistance of the game controller, and used a software loop to measure the timer.\n* A single 14.31818&nbsp;MHz master oscillator was divided by various ratios to produce all other required frequencies, including the microprocessor clock signals, the video transfer counters, and the color-burst samples.\n\nThe text and graphics screens have a complex arrangement (the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory) which is reputedly due to Wozniak's realization that doing it that way would allow for the refresh of the dynamic RAM as a side effect, as described above; it had no cost overhead to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline and avoided the need for significant extra hardware. Similarly, in the high-resolution graphics mode, color is determined by pixel position and can thus be implemented in software, saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors. This also allows for [[subpixel]] font rendering since orange and blue pixels appear half a pixel-width farther to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm |title=The origins of sub-pixel font rendering |publisher=Gibson Research Corporation |last=Gibson |first=Steve|accessdate=August 4, 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060721130149/http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm| archivedate= July 21, 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nThe Apple II at first used [[data cassette]] storage like most other microcomputers of the time. In 1978, the company introduced an external {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch [[floppy disk]] drive, the [[Disk II]], attached via a controller card that plugs into one of the computer's [[expansion slot]]s (usually slot 6). The Disk II interface, created by Wozniak, is regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components.<ref>{{cite web|title=5-The Disk II |url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html |publisher=Apple II History |author=Steven Weyhrich |date=December 28, 2001 |accessdate=November 16, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201122002/http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html |archivedate=December 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|last1=Freiberger\n|first1=Paul\n|authorlink1=Paul Freiberger\n|first2=Michael\n|last2=Swaine\n|authorlink2=Michael Swaine (technical author)\n|title=Fire In The Valley, Part Two\n|work=A+ Magazine\n|type=Book excerpt\n|date=January 1985\n|page=45}}</ref>\n\nThe approach taken in the Disk II controller is typical of Wozniak's designs. With a few small-scale logic chips and a cheap PROM ([[programmable read-only memory]]), he created a functional floppy disk interface at a fraction of the component cost of standard circuit configurations.\n\n==Case design==\nSteve Jobs extensively pushed to give the Apple II a case that looked visually appealing and sellable to people outside of electronics hobbyists, rather than the generic wood and metal boxes typical of early microcomputers. The result was a futuristic-looking molded white plastic case. Jobs also paid close attention to the keyboard design and decided to use dark brown keycaps as it contrasted well with the case.\n\nThe first production Apple IIs had hand-molded cases; these had visible bubbles and other lumps in them from the imperfect plastic molding process, which was soon switched to machine molding. In addition, the initial case design had no vent openings, causing high heat buildup from the PCB and resulting in the plastic softening and sagging. Apple added vent holes to the case within three months of production; customers with the original case could have them replaced at no charge.\n\n==PCB revisions==\nThe Apple II's PCB underwent several revisions as Steve Wozniak made modifications to it. The earliest version was known as Revision 0, and the first 6,000 units shipped used it. Later revisions added a color killer circuit to prevent color fringing when the computer was in text mode, as well as modifications to improve the reliability of cassette I/O. Revision 0 Apple IIs powered up in an undefined mode and had garbage on-screen, requiring the user to press Reset. This was eliminated on the later board revisions. Revision 0 Apple IIs could display only four colors, but Wozniak was later able to generate 16 in low-res mode.\n\nThe PCB had three RAM banks for a total of 24 RAM chips. Original Apple IIs had jumper switches to adjust the RAM size, and RAM configurations could be 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 36, or 48k. The three smallest memory configurations used 4kx1 DRAMs, with larger ones using 16kx1 DRAMs, or mix of 4k and 16k banks (the chips in any bank have to be the same size). The early Apple II+ models retained this feature, but after a drop in DRAM prices, Apple redesigned the circuit boards without the jumpers so that only 16kx1 chips were supported. A few months later they started shipping all machines with a full 48&nbsp;KB complement of DRAM.\n\nUnlike most machines, all ICs on the Apple II PCB were socketed; although this cost more to manufacture and created the possibility of loose chips causing a system malfunction, it was considered preferable to make servicing and replacement of bad chips easier.\n\nThe Apple II PCB lacks any means of generating an [[Interrupt request (PC architecture)|IRQ]], although expansion cards may generate one. Program code had to stop everything to perform any I/O task; like many of the computer's other idiosyncrasies, this was due to cost reasons and Steve Wozniak assuming interrupts were not needed for gaming or using the computer as a teaching tool.\n\n==Display and graphics==\n{{Main article|Apple II graphics}}\nColor on the Apple II series uses a quirk of the [[NTSC]] television signal standard, which made color display relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. The original NTSC television signal specification was black-and-white. Color was added on later by adding a 3.58-MHz subcarrier signal that was partially ignored by black-and-white TV sets. Color is encoded based on the ''[[phase (waves)|phase]]'' of this signal in relation to a reference ''[[color burst]]'' signal. The result is that the position, size, and intensity of a series of pulses define color information. These pulses can translate into ''[[pixel]]s'' on the computer screen, with the possibility of exploiting [[composite artifact colors]].\n\nThe Apple II display provides two pixels per subcarrier cycle. When the color burst reference signal is turned on and the computer attached to a color display, it can display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels, magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels, and white by placing two pixels next to each other. Blue and orange are available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel-width in relation to the color-burst signal. The high-resolution display offers more colors by compressing more (and narrower) pixels into each subcarrier cycle.\n\nThe coarse, low-resolution graphics display mode works differently, as it can output a pattern of dots per pixel to offer more color options. These patterns are stored in the character generator ROM and replace the text character bit patterns when the computer is switched to low-res graphics mode. The text mode and low-res graphics mode use the same memory region and the same circuitry is used for both.\n\nA single HGR page occupied 8k of RAM; in practice this meant that the user had to have at least 12k of total RAM to use HGR mode and 32k to use two pages. Early Apple II games from the 1977 to 79 period often ran only in text or low resolution mode to support users with small memory configurations; HGR not being near universally supported by games until 1980.\n\n==Sound==\nRather than a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II has a toggle circuit that can only emit a click through a built-in speaker or a line out jack; all other sounds (including two-, three- and, eventually, four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) are generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times. Similar techniques are used for cassette storage: the cassette output works the same as the speaker, and the input is a simple [[Zero crossing threshold detector|zero-crossing detector]] that serves as a relatively crude (1-bit) audio digitizer. Routines in the ROM encode and decode data in [[frequency-shift keying]] for the cassette.\n\n==Languages==\nInitially, the Apple II was shipped with Integer BASIC encoded in the motherboard [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chips. Written by Wozniak, the interpreter enabled users to write software applications without needing to purchase additional development utilities. Written with game programmers and hobbyists in mind, the language only supported the encoding of numbers in 16-bit integer format. Since it only supported whole numbers between -32768 and +32767, it was less suitable to business software and Apple soon received complaints from customers. Because Steve Wozniak was too busy developing the Disk II hardware, he did not have time to modify Integer BASIC for floating point support, so Apple instead licensed Microsoft's 6502 BASIC to create Applesoft BASIC. Disk users normally purchased a so-called Language Card which had Applesoft in ROM and sat below the Integer BASIC ROM in system memory. The user could switch between either BASIC by typing FP or INT at the BASIC prompt. Apple also offered a different version of Applesoft for cassette users which occupied low memory and was started by using the LOAD command in Integer BASIC.\n\nAs shipped, the machine incorporated a \"monitor\" program which supported functions such as displaying and altering the contents of the computer's RAM memory in [[hexadecimal]] format, either one byte at a time or in blocks of 256 bytes at once. This feature enabled hackers to write and debug machine code programs without needing further development software. The computer powered on into the monitor ROM and the user was greeted with a * prompt. From there, he could enter BASIC by typing Ctrl+B, or he could load a machine language program from cassette. Disk software could be booted by typing Ctrl+P followed by 6, referring to Slot 6 which normally contained the Disk II controller.\n\nA 6502 assembler was soon offered on disk, and later the [[UCSD]] compiler and operating system for the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] language were made available. The Pascal system required a 16&nbsp;KB RAM card to be installed in the language card position (expansion slot 0) in addition to the full 48&nbsp;KB of motherboard memory.\n\n==Manual==\nThe first 1000 or so Apple IIs shipped with a 68-page [[mimeograph]]ed \"Apple II Mini Manual\" bound with brass paper fasteners. This was the basis for the ''Apple II Reference Manual'' which was published in January 1978. All existing customers who sent in their warranty cards were sent free copies of the Red Book. The Apple II Reference Manual contained the complete schematic of the entire computer's circuitry and a complete source listing of the \"Monitor\" ROM firmware that served as the machine's [[BIOS]].\n\n==Third-party devices and applications==\nWhen the Apple II initially shipped in June 1977, no expansion cards were available for the slots, so the user did not have any way of connecting a modem or performing printer output; a popular hack involved connecting a teletype machine to the cassette output.\n\nWozniak's [[open architecture|open-architecture]] design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permit a wide variety of third-party devices, including [[Apple II peripheral cards|peripheral cards]] such as [[Apple II serial cards|serial controllers]], display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, networking components, and [[Apple II system clocks|realtime clocks]]. There are plug-in [[Apple II processor cards|expansion cards]] \u2013 such as the [[Z-80 SoftCard]] \u2013 that permit the Apple to use the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor and run programs for the [[CP/M]] operating system,<ref name=z80>{{cite journal|work=[[InfoWorld]]|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group|date=February 6, 1984| issue=Vol. 6, Num. 6|quote=Several manufacturers, however, make Z80 coprocessor boards that plug into the Apple II.|page=64|title=Review: Premium Softcard IIe|last=Petersen|first=Marty}}</ref> including the [[dBase|dBase II]] database and the [[WordStar]] word processor. The Z80 card also allows the connection to a modem and thereby to any networks that the user might have access to. In the early days, these were scarce, but expanded significantly with the development of bulletin board systems. There is also a third-party [[Motorola 6809|6809]] card that allows [[OS-9]] Level One to be run. Third-party [[Apple II sound cards|sound cards]] greatly improve audio capabilities, allowing simple music synthesis and text-to-speech functions. [[Apple II accelerators|Apple II accelerator cards]] double or quadruple the computer's speed.\n\nEarly Apple IIs were often sold with a [[Sup'R'Mod]], which allowed the composite video signal to be viewed on a television.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Apple II advertisement Dec 1977 page 2.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for the Apple II (1977)]]\nJesse Adams Stein wrote, \"As the first company to release a 'consumer appliance' micro-computer, Apple Computer offers us a clear view of this shift from a ''machine'' to an ''appliance''.\" But the company also had \"to negotiate the attitudes of its potential buyers, bearing in mind social anxieties about the uptake of new technologies in multiple contexts.

The magazine praised the sophisticated monitor software, user expandability, and comprehensive documentation, and concluded that \"the Apple II is a very promising machine\" which \"would be even more of a temptation were its price slightly lower ... for the moment, colour is an Apple II\".<ref name=\"pcw197808\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Personal_Computer_World_1978-08_Apple_II_Review#page/n0/mode/2up | title=Colour is an Apple II | work=Personal Computer World | date=August 1978 | accessdate=18 August 2014 |author1=Coll, John |author2=Sweeten, Charles | pages=50}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it sold well from the launch, the initial market was to hobbyists, games players and computer enthusiasts. Sales expanded exponentially into the business and professional market when the spreadsheet program [[VisiCalc]] was launched in mid-1979. VisiCalc is credited as being the defining \"[[killer app]]\" in the microcomputer industry.\n\nDuring the first five years of operations, revenues doubled about every four months.

They started playing together as a duo, started the influential London Blues and Barrelhouse Club in 1955 and made their first record together in 1957. Korner made his first official record on [[Decca Records]] DFE 6286 in the company of [[Ken Colyer]]'s [[Skiffle]] Group. His talent extended to playing [[mandolin]] on one of the tracks of this rare British [[Extended play|EP]], recorded in London on 28 July 1955.

The group included, at various times, [[Charlie Watts]], [[Jack Bruce]], [[Ginger Baker]], [[Long John Baldry]], [[Graham Bond]], [[Danny Thompson]] and [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]]. It also attracted a wider crowd of mostly younger fans, some of whom occasionally performed with the group, including [[Mick Jagger]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Brian Jones]], [[Geoff Bradford (musician)|Geoff Bradford]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[John Mayall]] and [[Jimmy Page]].<ref name=Shapiro1997>{{cite book|last = Shapiro |first = Harry  |title = Alexis Korner: The Biography |year =1997|isbn = 0-7475-3163-3}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Cyril Davies left the group in late 1962, Blues Incorporated continued to record, with Korner at the helm, until 1966. However, by that time its originally stellar line-up (and crowd of followers) had mostly left to start their own bands. \"While his one-time acolytes the Rolling Stones and [[Cream (band)|Cream]] made the front pages of music magazines all over the world, Korner was relegated to the role of 'elder statesman'.\"<ref name = \"tsxbpf\"/>\n\nAlthough he himself was a blues purist, Korner criticised better-known British blues musicians during the blues boom of the late 1960s for their blind adherence to [[Chicago blues]], as if the music came in no other form. He liked to surround himself with [[jazz]] musicians and often performed with a [[horn section]] drawn from a pool that included, among others, saxophone players [[Art Themen]], [[Mel Collins]], [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]], [[Lol Coxhill]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palladium/9932/chodg_s.htm |title=Colin Hodgkinson sessions (The Musicians' Olympus) |publisher=Reocities.com |date= |accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref> [[Dick Morrissey]], [[John Surman]] and [[trombonist]] [[Mike Zwerin]].\n\n==Broadcasting==\nIn the 1960s Korner began a media career, working initially as a show business interviewer and then on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''Five O'Clock Club'', a children's TV show. Korner also wrote about blues for the music papers, and continued to maintain his own career as a blues artist, especially in Europe.\n\nOn 17 October 1967, Korner interviewed [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] for the [[BBC]] radio show ''[[Top Gear (radio show)|Top Gear]]''. Some of these tracks, including audio of Korner himself, appear on the Hendrix double-CD ''[[BBC Sessions (The Jimi Hendrix Experience album)|BBC Sessions]]'', including Korner playing slide guitar on \"[[(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man]]\".\n\nWhile touring [[Scandinavia]] he formed the band New Church with guitarist and singer [[Peter Thorup]]. They subsequently were one of the support bands at the [[Stones in the Park|Rolling Stones Free Concert]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London, on 5 July 1969. [[Jimmy Page]] reportedly found out about a new singer, [[Robert Plant]], who had been jamming with Korner, who wondered why Plant had not yet been discovered. Plant and Korner were recording an album with Plant on vocals until Page had asked him to join \"the New [[Yardbirds]]\", a.k.a. [[Led Zeppelin]]. Only two songs are in circulation from these recordings: \"Steal Away\" and \"Operator\".<ref name=\"Shapiro1997\"/> Korner gave one of his last radio interviews to BBC Midlands on the ''Record Collectors Show'' with Mike Adams and Chris Savory.\n\n===1970s===\n{{Main|Collective Consciousness Society}}\n[[Image:Alexis Korner 1968 Bremen.jpg|thumb|160px|Korner and [[Peter Thorup]] in [[Bremen]]]]\nIn 1970 Korner and Thorup formed a big-band ensemble, [[C.

Another instrumental called \"Brother\" was used as the theme to the [[BBC Radio 1]] Top 20/40 when [[Tom Browne (broadcaster and actor)|Tom Browne]]/[[Simon Bates]] presented the programme in the 1970s. It was also used in the 1990s on Radio Luxembourg for the Top 20 Singles chart.

In the mid-1970s, while touring Germany, Korner established an intensive working relationship with bassist [[Colin Hodgkinson]] who played for the support act [[Back Door (jazz trio)|Back Door]]. They would continue to collaborate right up until Korner's death.<ref name=\"Shapiro1997\"/>\n\nIn the 1970s Korner's main career was in broadcasting.

He also used his gravelly voice to great effect as an advertising voice-over artist. In 1978, for Korner's 50th birthday, an all-star concert was held featuring many of his above-mentioned friends, as well as [[Eric Clapton]], [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]], [[Chris Farlowe]], [[Zoot Money]] and others, which was later released as ''[[The Party Album (Alexis Korner album)|The Party Album]]'', and as a video.\n\nIn 1981, Korner joined another \"supergroup\", [[Rocket 88 (band)|Rocket 88]], a project led by [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] based on [[boogie-woogie]] keyboard players, which featured a [[rhythm section]] comprising [[Jack Bruce]] and [[Charlie Watts]], among others, as well as a [[horn section]].

Early in the war, the [[Germans]] began to create makeshift assault guns by mounting their [[infantry support weapon]]s on the bed of a [[truck]] or on obsolete [[tank]]s with the turret removed. Later in the war, both the Germans and the Soviets introduced fully [[armoured warfare|armoured]] purpose-built assault guns into their arsenals.\n\nEarly on, the Soviets built the [[KV-2]], a variant of the [[KV-1 (tank)|KV-1]] heavy tank with a short-barrelled [[152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20)|152 mm howitzer]] mounted in an oversized turret. This was not a success in battle, and was replaced with a very successful series of turretless assault guns: the [[SU-76]], [[SU-122]], and the heavy [[SU-152]], which were followed by the [[ISU-122]] and [[ISU-152]] on the new [[Iosif Stalin tank|IS]] heavy tank [[chassis]].\n\n[[Image:Germany06 086.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Sturmtiger]]'' in the ''[[Deutsches Panzermuseum]]'' at [[Munster, Lower Saxony]].]]\n\nThe primary German assault gun was the ''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III]]'' (StuG III). At about the same time (March 1942) as the howitzer-like KwK 37 gun was dropped from the Panzer IV's use, its ''Sturmkanone'' equivalent in the StuG III up to that time, was likewise replaced with a longer-barreled, high-velocity dual-purpose [[7.5 cm KwK 40|75mm gun]] that had also been derived from the successful [[PaK 40]] anti-tank towed artillery piece. The Germans also built a number of other fully armoured turretless assault guns, including the [[StuG IV]], [[Sturm-Infanteriegesch\u00fctz 33B|StuIG 33B]], ''[[Brummb\u00e4r]]'' and ''[[Sturmtiger]]''. The latter two were very heavy vehicles, and were built only in small quantities.\n\n[[Battalions]] of assault guns, usually StuG IIIs, commonly replaced the intended [[panzer]] battalion in the German [[panzergrenadier]] [[division (military)|divisions]] due to the chronic shortage of tanks, and were sometimes used as makeshifts even in the [[panzer division]]s.<ref>Thomas L. Jentz (1996): Panzertruppen: The Complete Guide to the Creation & Combat Employment of Germany's Tank Force, vol.2, 1943-1945, p.68</ref> Independent battalions were also deployed as \"stiffeners\" for [[infantry]] divisions, and the StuG III's [[anti-tank]] capabilities bolstered dwindling tank numbers on the Eastern and Western fronts.\n[[Image:Sherman Tank WW2.jpg|right|thumb|A preserved Sherman M4 (105).]]\nUS and UK forces also deployed vehicles designed for a close support role, but these were conventional tanks whose only significant modification was the replacement of the main gun with a howitzer. Two versions of the American  [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]] were armed with the [[M101 howitzer|M4 105 mm howitzer]], the M4(105) and the M4A3(105); these were designated assault guns in US usage of the term. The [[M8 Scott]], based on the chassis of the [[M5 Stuart]] light tank, was also an assault cannon and carried a [[M116 howitzer|75 mm short howitzer]]. The [[Churchill tank|Churchill]], [[Cromwell tank|Centaur]] and [[Cromwell tank|Cromwell]] tanks were all produced in versions armed with [[Ordnance QF 95 mm Howitzer|95&nbsp;mm howitzers]]: the Churchill Mark V and Mark VIII, the Centaur Mark IV and the Cromwell Mark VI. Earlier British tanks, such as the [[Crusader tank|Crusader cruiser tank]] and the [[Matilda II|Matilda II Infantry tank]] were produced in versions armed with the [[Ordnance QF 3-inch howitzer|3-inch howitzer]]; the first versions of the Churchill tank also had this gun in a hull mounting. American [[tank destroyer]] units were often used in the assault gun role for infantry support.\n\nThe AVRE version of the Churchill Tank was armed with a [[Mortar (weapon)#Spigot mortar|Spigot mortar]] that fired a {{convert|40|lb|kg|abbr=on}} [[High explosive|HE]]-filled projectile (nicknamed the ''Flying Dustbin'') {{convert|150|yd|m}}. Its task was to attack fortified positions such as [[bunker]]s at close range (see [[Hobart's Funnies]]).\n\n=== Post-war use ===\n\nIn the post-[[World War II|WWII]] era, vehicles fitting into an \"assault gun\" category were developed as a light-weight, air-deployable, direct fire weapon for use with airborne troops. Current weapons were either based on [[jeep]]s or small [[Caterpillar track|tracked]] vehicles and the airborne troops thus always fought at a distinct disadvantage in terms of heavy weapons. The Soviet Union and the United States were the most attracted to the idea of providing this capability to traditionally light airborne forces. Their answers to the problem were similar, with the United States developing the [[M56 Scorpion]] and the Soviet Union developing the [[ASU-57]], both essentially air-droppable light anti-tank guns.\n\nThe Soviets went on to develop an improved air-droppable assault gun, the [[ASU-85]], which served through the 1980s, while their [[SU-100]] remained in service with Communist countries, including Vietnam and Cuba, years after World War II. The US M56 and another armoured vehicle, the [[Ontos|M50 Ontos]], were to be the last of the more traditional assault guns in US service. Improvised arrangements such as [[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier#Weapons|M113]] personnel carriers with recoilless rifles were quickly replaced by missile carrier vehicles in the anti-tank role.\n\nThe only vehicle with the qualities of an assault gun to be fielded after the removal of the M50 and M56 from service within the US military was the [[M551 Sheridan]]. The Sheridan's gun was a low-velocity weapon suitable in the assault role, but with the addition of the [[Shillelagh missile]] could double in the anti-tank role as well. The Sheridan, however, was not developed as an assault gun but as a light reconnaissance vehicle.\n\nCurrently there appears to be a move toward wheeled vehicles fitting a \"tank destroyer\" or \"assault gun\" role, such as the [[M1128 Mobile Gun System]] of the [[US Army]], the [[Centauro]] Wheeled Tank Destroyer of the [[Italian Army|Italian]] and [[Spanish Army|Spanish Armies]], the Chinese anti-tank gun PTL-02 and ZBL08 assault gun, and the French [[AMX 10 RC]] heavy armoured car. While these vehicles might be useful in a direct fire role, none were developed with this specifically in mind, reminiscent of the use of tank destroyers by the US military in the assault gun role during World War II.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Armoured warfare]]\n* [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz]]\n* [[Tank destroyer]]\n* [[Armoured fighting vehicle]]\n* [[List of assault guns]]\n* [[Self-propelled gun]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Assault Gun}}\n[[Category:Assault guns| ]]", "sha1": "rp0jwu6phz1s4s6w1jqm1ywvir03gpu"}}, {"title": "Anti-tank vehicles", "ns": "0", "id": "2285", "redirect": {"title": "Tank destroyer"}, "revision": {"id": "783846379", "parentid": "653683671", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T01:19:12Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Tank destroyer]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from alternative name}}\n}}", "sha1": "rinc5cfa6vd8h9ax7czg2y174rqe9sf"}}, {"title": "Tank destroyer", "ns": "0", "id": "2286", "revision": {"id": "859530795", "parentid": "858754435", "timestamp": "2018-09-14T16:38:41Z", "contributor": {"ip": "107.13.173.100"}, "comment": "/* Romania */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{More citations needed|date=March 2009}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Tank destroyers.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Two American [[M10 tank destroyer]]s in France during World War II]]\n{{History of the tank|state-unclloapsed}}\n\nA '''tank destroyer''' or '''tank hunter''' is a type of [[armoured fighting vehicle]], armed with a direct-fire artillery [[Tank gun|gun]] or missile launcher, with limited operational capacities and designed specifically to engage enemy [[tank]]s.\n\nTanks are [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s designed for [[front-line]] combat, combining [[operational mobility]] and [[Military tactics|tactical]] offensive and defensive capabilities; tanks perform all primary tasks of the armoured troops. The tank destroyer on the other hand is specifically designed to take on enemy tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles.<ref>von Senger and Etterlin (1960), ''The World's Armored Fighting Vehicles'', p. 9.</ref> Many are based on a [[Continuous track|tracked]] tank [[chassis]], while others are wheeled.\n\nSince [[World War II]], gun-armed tank destroyers have fallen out of favor as armies have favored multirole [[main battle tank]]s. However, lightly armored [[Anti-tank missile|anti-tank guided missile]] (ATGM) carriers are commonly used for supplementary long-range anti-tank work. The resurgence of [[expeditionary warfare]] in the first two decades of the 21st century has seen the emergence of gun-armed wheeled vehicles, sometimes called ''protected gun systems'', which may bear a superficial resemblance to tank destroyers, but are employed as direct fire support units typically providing support in low-intensity operations such as the wars in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==20th century==\n=== World War II ===\nDedicated anti-tank vehicles made their first major appearance in the Second World War as combatants developed effective armored vehicles and tactics. Some were little more than stopgap solutions, mounting an [[anti-tank gun]] on a tracked vehicle to give mobility, while others were more sophisticated designs. An example of the development of tank destroyer technology throughout the war are the [[Marder III]] and [[Hetzer|Jagdpanzer 38]] vehicle, that were very different in spite of being based on the same chassis: Marder was straightforwardly an anti-tank gun on tracks whereas the Jagdpanzer 38 traded some firepower (its [[7.5 cm PaK 39|Pak 39]], designed to operate within the confines of a fully armored fighting compartment, fires the same projectiles from a reduced propellant charge compared to Marder's [[7.5 cm Pak 40|Pak 40]]) for better armor protection and ease of  concealment on the battlefield.\n\nExcept for most American designs, tank destroyers were all turretless and had fixed or [[casemate]] superstructures. When a tank destroyer was used against enemy tanks from a defensive position such as by ambush, the common lack of a rotating [[Gun turret#Combat vehicles|turret]] was not particularly critical, while the lower silhouette was highly desirable. The turretless design allowed accommodation of a more powerful gun, typically a dedicated anti-tank gun (in lieu of a regular tank's general-purpose [[tank gun|main gun]] that fired both anti-tank and high explosive ammunition) that had a longer barrel than could be mounted in a turreted tank on the same chassis. The lack of a turret increased the vehicle's internal volume, allowing for increased ammunition stowage and crew comfort.<ref>([[#References|Perrett 1987:84]])</ref> Eliminating the turret let the vehicle carry thicker armor, and also let this armour be concentrated in the hull. Sometimes there was no armored roof (only a weather cover) to keep the overall weight down to the limit that the chassis could bear. The absence of a turret meant that tank destroyers could be manufactured significantly cheaper, faster, and more easily than the tanks on which they were based, and they found particular favor when production resources were lacking. After hard lessons early in the war, machine guns were mounted for use against infantry, but the limited traverse of the mounting meant that they were still less effective than those used on turreted tanks.\n\n====Poland====\nVariants of the Polish [[TKS]] and [[TK-3]] tankettes up-armed with 20&nbsp;mm gun (23\u201326 vehicles) were operationally deployed in the [[invasion of Poland]].<ref>A. Jo\u0144ca, R. Szuba\u0144ski, J. Tarczy\u0144ski, Wrzesie\u0144 1939 Pojazdy Wojska Polskiego, Wyd. WKi\u0141, Warszawa 1990, s. 72.</ref><ref>There were also 37&nbsp;mm armed [[TKS-D]] (2 experimental vehicles) or 45&nbsp;mm armed [[TKD]] (4 experimental vehicles). It is not sure whether they were used operationally at all.</ref> They were used as an anti-tank component of the reconnaissance units.\n\n====France====\nDue to the quick defeat of France, few French vehicles were built.  The Laffly W15 TCC (''Chasseur de char'') was an attempt to quickly build a light tank destroyer by mounting a 47&nbsp;mm SA37 anti-tank gun onto a lightly armored [[Laffly S15|Laffly W15T]] artillery tractor. Other French tank destroyers were being developed, including the SOMUA SAu-40, ARL V39 and various ad hoc conversions of the [[Lorraine 37L]].\n\n====Germany====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-782-0041-31, Nordafrika, Panzerj\u00e4ger 1.jpg|thumb|''Panzerj\u00e4ger'' I]]\n\nThe first [[Nazi Germany|German]] tank destroyers were the ''[[Panzerj\u00e4ger]]'' (\"tank hunters\"), which mounted an existing anti-tank gun on a convenient chassis for mobility, usually with just a three-sided [[gun shield]] for crew protection. For instance, 202 obsolete [[Panzer I]] light tanks were modified by removing the turret and were rebuilt as the [[Panzerj\u00e4ger I]] self-propelled [[4,7cm KP\u00daV vz. 38|4.7 cm PaK(t)]]. Similarly, [[Panzer II]] tanks were used on the eastern front. Captured Soviet {{nowrap|76.2 mm}} anti-tank guns were mounted on modified Panzer II chassis, producing the [[Marder II]] self-propelled anti-tank gun. The most common mounting was a German {{nowrap|75 mm}} anti-tank gun on the Czech [[Panzer 38(t)]] chassis to produce the [[Marder III]]. The Panzer 38(t) chassis was also used to make the [[Hetzer|Jagdpanzer 38]] casemate style tank destroyer. The Panzerj\u00e4ger series continued up to the {{nowrap|88 mm}} equipped [[Nashorn]].\n\n[[File:StuG-III-latrun-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Sturmgesch\u00fctz'' III]]\n\nGerman tank destroyers based on the [[Panzer III]] and later German tanks were unique in that they had more armor than their tank counterparts. One of the more successful German tank destroyers was actually designed as a self-propelled artillery gun, the [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III]]. Based on the Panzer III tank chassis, the Sturmgesch\u00fctz III was originally fitted with a low-velocity gun, and was assigned to the artillery arm for infantry fire support. Later, after encountering Soviet tanks, it was refitted with a comparatively short-barreled high-velocity anti-tank gun, usually with a [[muzzle brake]], enabling it to function as a tank destroyer. The ''Sturmgesch\u00fctz III'' from its 1938 origin used a new casemate-style superstructure with an integrated design similar to the later ''[[Jagdpanzer]]'' to completely enclose the crew. It was employed in infantry support and offensive armored operations as well as in the defensive anti-tank role. The StuG III was the most-produced German armored fighting vehicle of any type built during the war years, with some 10,000 examples built from January 1940 through March 1945.\n\n[[File:Jagdpanther2.jpg|thumb|right|''Jagdpanther'']]\n\nAlthough the early German ''Panzerj\u00e4ger'' carried more effective weapons than the tanks on which they were based, they were generally lacking in protection for the crew, having thinly armored open-topped superstructures. The \"open-topped\" design format of the ''Panzerj\u00e4ger'' vehicles was succeeded by the ''Jagdpanzer'' '(\"hunting tanks\"), which mounted the gun in true casemate-style superstructures, completely enclosing the crew compartment in armor that was usually integral to the hull. The first of these ''Jagdpanzer''s was the 70-ton ''Ferdinand'' (later renamed ''[[Elefant]]''), based on the chassis, hulls, and drive systems of ninety-one Porsche [[VK 4501 (P)|VK4501 (P)]] heavy tanks, mounting a long-barreled [[8.8 cm Pak 43|88&nbsp;mm]] cannon in an added casemate, more like the earlier ''Panzerj\u00e4gers'' had with their added-on armor shielding for the gun crew, but in the ''Ferdinand'' completely enclosing the gun and firing crew in the added casemate, as the later purpose-built ''Jagdpanzers'' would. However, the ''Ferdinand'' was mechanically unreliable and difficult to maneuver, and once all ninety-one unturreted \"Porsche Tiger\" hulls/drive systems were converted, no more were built. The German Army had more success with the [[Jagdpanther]]. Introduced in mid-1944, the Jagdpanther, of which some 415 examples were produced, was considered the best of the casemate-design Jagdpanzer designs.<ref name=\"tanks\">Forty and Livesey 2006 p. 33</ref> It featured the same powerful PaK 43 88&nbsp;mm cannon used on the unwieldy ''Elefant'', now fitted to the chassis of the medium [[Panther tank]], providing greatly improved armor-penetrating capability in a medium-weight vehicle.\n\n[[File:Jagdtiger 1 Bovington.jpg|thumb|left|''Jagdtiger'']]\nFacing an increasingly defensive war, the German Army turned to larger and more powerfully armed Jagdpanzer designs, and in July 1944 the first ''[[Jagdtiger]]'' rolled off the production line; it was the heaviest German armored fighting vehicle to go into active service.<ref name=\"tanks\"/>  The ''Jagdtiger'' featured a huge [[12.8 cm Pak 44|128&nbsp;mm PaK 44]] cannon and heavy armor protection. Only 88 ''Jagdtiger'' vehicles were produced, barely matching the total number of the earlier Ferdinand/Elefant vehicles. They were first deployed to combat units in September 1944.\n\nThe decision of German armored vehicle designers to use a casemate-style superstructure for all tank destroyers had the advantage of a reduced silhouette, allowing the crew to more frequently fire from defilade ambush positions. Such designs were also easier and faster to manufacture and offered good crew protection from artillery fire and shell splinters.  However, the lack of a rotating turret limited the gun's traverse to a few degrees. This meant that the driver normally had to turn the entire tank onto its target, a much slower process than simply rotating a powered turret.<ref>Irwin, John P. ''Another River, Another Town'', New York: Random House Publishers (2002), pp. 61\u201361</ref> If the vehicle became immobilized due to engine failure or track damage, it could not rotate its gun to counter opposing tanks, making it highly vulnerable to counterfire.<ref>Irwin, pp. 61\u201361</ref> This vulnerability was later exploited by opposing tank forces. Even the largest and most powerful of German tank destroyers were found abandoned on the field after a battle, having been immobilized by one or more hits by high explosive (HE) or armor-piercing (AP) shells to the track or front drive sprocket.<ref>Irwin, pp. 61\u201362: Even the U.S. M4 Sherman could disable a Jagdpanther's track or fracture the front drive sprocket with a 75&nbsp;mm HE shell. As the crew abandoned their vehicle, they were easy targets for enemy machinegun fire.</ref>\n\n====Italy====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Semovente M42.Saumur.0008fefh.jpg|thumb|left|Semovente da 75-18]]\nThe most famous Italian tank destroyer of the Second World War was technically not a tank destroyer, but self-propelled artillery. The [[Semovente da 75/18]], based on the [[M13/40]] frame, was developed to support front-line infantry, and therefore has fixed armament: a 75&nbsp;mm gun in casemate. However, thanks to its low height (185&nbsp;cm) and the caliber of its gun the 75/18 also had good results in anti-tank combat, fighting against British and American (but not Soviet) units. After the Armistice of 1943, the 75/18 remained in use by German forces until Italy's liberation.\n[[File:Savoia Cavalleria Centauro.png|thumb|A Centauro]]\nBuilt on the same frame, the [[Semovente da 105/25]] was equipped with a 105&nbsp;mm gun and known as \"bassotto\" (Italian for [[dachshund]]) due to its lower height. As manufacturing began in 1943, the 105/25 was used by German forces. A further development was the [[Semovente da 75/46]], which had a longer gun than the 75/18 and inclined armour 100&nbsp;mm thick, making it similar to [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III]]. Only 11 of these were manufactured.\n\nBefore the Semovente da 75/18, the [[Semovente da 47/32|L40]], built on an [[L6/40]] frame, saw action in Africa and in Russia, but with disappointing results.\n\nAs of 2017, Italian forces use the wheeled tank destroyer [[B1 Centauro|Centauro]], armed with a 105 or 120&nbsp;mm gun.\n\n====Soviet Union====\n[[Image:ISU-122 skos RB.jpg|thumb|Soviet [[ISU-122]], a [[casemate]] tank destroyer of the Second World War, shown here with postwar [[Polish Army]] markings]]\n{{Main|Samokhodnaya Ustanovka}}\nAs with the Germans of 1943, most of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] designs mounted anti-tank guns, with limited traverse in casemate-style turretless hulls, in a general design format looking much like the Germans' own ''Jagdpanzer'' vehicles. The results were smaller, lighter, and simpler to build weapons that could carry larger guns than any contemporary tank, including the King Tiger. The Soviets produced high numbers of the {{nowrap|85 mm}} [[SU-85]] and {{nowrap|100 mm}} [[SU-100]] self-propelled guns based on the same chassis as the [[T-34]] medium tank; the heavier-duty powertrain and hull of the [[IS-2]] heavy tank were instead used to produce the heavier-hitting {{nowrap|122 mm}}-armed [[ISU-122]] and {{nowrap|152 mm}}-armed [[ISU-152]], both of which had impressive anti-tank capabilities earning each of them the Russian nickname ''Zveroboy'' (\"beast killer\") for their ability to destroy German [[Tiger I tank|Tigers]], [[Panther tank|Panthers]] and [[Elefant]]s. The predecessor of the ISU 152 was the [[SU-152]], built on the KV-1s chassis and shared many similarities (including its gun) with the ISU-152. The ISU-152 built as a heavy assault gun, relied on the weight of the shell fired from its M-1937/43 howitzer to defeat tanks.<ref name=\"tanks2\">Forty and Livesey 2006 p. 329</ref> In 1943, the Soviets also shifted all production of light tanks like the [[T-70]] to much simpler and better-armed [[SU-76]] self-propelled guns, which used the same drive train. The SU-76 was originally designed as an anti-tank vehicle, but was soon relegated to the infantry-support role.<ref name=\"tanks3\">Forty and Livesey 2006 p. 392</ref>\n\n==== United States ====\n{{Main|Tank destroyer battalion (United States)}}\n[[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and counterpart British designs were very different in conception. U.S. doctrine was based, in light of the [[fall of France]], on the perceived need to defeat German [[blitzkrieg]] tactics, and U.S. units expected to face large numbers of German tanks, attacking on relatively narrow fronts. These were ''expected'' to break through a thin screen of anti-tank guns, hence the decision that the main anti-tank units\u2014the [[Tank destroyer battalion (United States)|Tank Destroyer (TD) battalions]]\u2014should be concentrated and very mobile. In actual practice, such German attacks rarely happened. Throughout the war, only one battalion ever fought in an engagement like that originally envisaged (the [[601st Tank Destroyer Battalion|601st]], at the [[Battle of El Guettar]]). The Tank Destroyer Command eventually numbered over 100,000 men and 80 battalions each equipped with 36 self-propelled tank destroyers or towed guns.\n\n[[File:Aberdean proving grounds 036.JPG|thumb|3in Gun Motor Carriage M10]]\nOnly [[Shoot-and-scoot|a few shots were expected to be fired from any firing position]]. Strong reconnaissance elements were provided so that TDs could use pre-arranged firing positions to best advantage. [[Flanking fire]] by TDs was emphasized, both to penetrate thinner enemy side armor, and to reduce the likelihood of accurate enemy return fire.\n\nAll American tank destroyers were officially known by exactly the same collective term used for American self-propelled artillery ordnance, ''gun motor carriage''. The designs were intended to be very mobile and heavily armed. Most of the tank-hull based designs used special open-topped turrets, of a differing design to the original tank it was based on, which was meant to both save weight and to accommodate a larger gun. The earliest expedient design was an [[M3 Half-track]] mounting an M1897 {{nowrap|75 mm}} gun in a limited-traverse mount, and called the [[M3 GMC|75 mm Gun Motor Carriage M3]]. Another, considerably less successful, early design mounted a 37-mm anti-tank gun in the bed of a Dodge 3/4-ton truck\u2014the [[M6 Fargo|37-mm GMC M6]]. By far the most common US design, and the first that was fully tracked and turreted (which became the American hallmark of World War II \"tank destroyer\" design) was the [[M10 Tank Destroyer|3in Gun Motor Carriage M10]], later supplemented by the [[M36 tank destroyer|90&nbsp;mm Gun Motor Carriage M36]]\u2014both based on the [[M4 Sherman]] hull and powertrain\u2014and the [[M18 Hellcat|76&nbsp;mm Gun Motor Carriage M18 (Hellcat)]], based on a unique hull and powertrain design, with a slight visual resemblance to what was used for the later [[M24 Chaffee]] light tank. The M18 came closest to the US ideal; the vehicle was very fast, small, and mounted a {{nowrap|76 mm}} gun in a roofless open turret. The M36 Jackson GMC possessed the only American-origin operational gun that could rival [[8.8 cm Pak 43|the vaunted 88&nbsp;mm]] German anti-tank ordnance, the [[90 mm Gun M1/M2/M3|90 mm M3 gun]], and the M36 remained in service well after World War II.  The only dedicated American-origin, casemate hull design fighting vehicle of any type built during the war, that resembled the German and Soviet tank destroyers in hull and general gun mounting design, was the experimental [[T28 Super Heavy Tank]], which mounted a 105&nbsp;mm T5E1 long-barrel cannon, which had a maximum firing range of 12 miles (20&nbsp;km), and was originally designed as a self-propelled assault gun to breach Germany's [[Siegfried Line]] defenses.\n\nOf these tank destroyers, only the {{nowrap|90 mm}} gun of the M36 proved effective against the frontal armor of Germans' larger armored vehicles at long range.<ref>Forty and Livesey 2006 p. 117</ref> The open top and light armor made these tank destroyers vulnerable to anything greater than small-arms fire. As the number of German tanks encountered by American forces steadily decreased throughout the war, most battalions were split up and assigned to infantry units as supporting arms, fighting as [[assault gun]]s or being used essentially as tanks. In this sense they were an alternative to the [[Independent tank battalion]]s that were attached to various Infantry Divisions.\n\nThe expectation that German tanks would be engaged in mass formation was a failed assumption. In reality, German attacks effectively used [[combined arms]] on the ground, fighting cohesively. American tank destroyer battalions comprised three tank destroyer companies supported by nine security sections. The single-purpose tactics of the tank destroyer battalion failed to account for non-tank threats.<ref name=\"single purpose\">{{cite book|last1=Gabel|first1=Christopher R.|title=Seek, Strike and Destroy: US Army Tank Destroyer Doctrine in World War II|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=9781428915770|pages=68\u201369|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IA1ljqnb7IwC&pg=PA70&dq=main+battle+tank+doctrine#v=onepage&q=main%20battle%20tank%20doctrine&f=false|accessdate=4 May 2015|year=1985}}</ref>\n\n====United Kingdom====\nBritish tanks in the early years of the war, both infantry and cruiser, were (with the exception of the pre-war Matilda I design) equipped with a gun capable of use against contemporary enemy tanks\u2014the 40&nbsp;mm [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder]]. This was replaced with the 57&nbsp;mm [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder]] when that became available. There was extra impetus given to the development of anti-tank weaponry, which culminated in the 76mm [[Ordnance QF 17 pounder]], widely considered one of the best anti-tank guns of the war.<ref name=\"tanks4\">Forty and Livesey 2006 p. 116</ref>\n\nTowed anti-tank guns were the domain of the [[Royal Artillery]] rather than the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] and vehicles adapted to mount artillery, including anti-tank self-propelled guns such as the [[Deacon (artillery)|Deacon]] (6pdr on an armoured wheeled truck chassis) and [[Archer (tank destroyer)|Archer]] (17pdr on tracked chassis), were their preserve, as were US-supplied vehicles.\n\n[[File:Archer SP 17 pdr Tank Destroyer.jpg|thumb|Archer. The gun faced to the rear]]\n[[File:Achilles tank destroyer on the east bank of the Rhine.jpg|thumb|right|A British Achilles self-propelled anti-tank gun on the east bank of the [[Rhine]].]]\nThe self-propelled guns that were built in the \"tank destroyer\" mould came about through the desire to field the QF 17 pounder anti-tank gun and simultaneous lack of suitable standard tanks to carry it. As a result, they were of a somewhat extemporized nature. Mounting the gun on the [[Valentine tank]] chassis in a fixed superstructure gave the [[Archer (tank destroyer)|Archer]], looking somewhat like the light-chassis German [[Marder III]] in appearance. The 17 pounder was also used to re-equip the US-supplied [[M10 Tank Destroyer]], replacing the American 3-inch gun to produce the [[17pdr SP Achilles]].\n\nIn 1942 the General Staff agreed on investigating self-propelled mountings of the 6-pounder, 17-pounder, [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch 20cwt]] guns and the 25-pounder field gun/howitzer on the Matilda II, Valentine, Crusader and [[Cavalier tank|Cruiser Mark VII]] tank chassis. In October 1942 it was decided to progress using the Valentine chassis with a 17-pdr (which would become Archer) and 25-pdr (which entered service as Bishop)<ref>[http://www.tankmuseum.org/museum-online/vehicles/object-e1969-43 S-P 17pdr, Archer (E1969.43)]</ref>\n\nWhile there was a general move to a general purpose gun that was usable against both tanks and in supporting infantry, there was a need to put the 17 pdr into a tank for use against the enemy's heavy tanks. The [[Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger]] was a project to bring a 17 pdr tank into use to support the [[Cromwell tank|Cromwell cruiser tank]]. Delays led to it being outnumbered in use by the [[Sherman Firefly]]\u2014but a derivative of Challenger was the more or less open-topped variant ''Avenger'', which was delayed until post war before entering service. A cut-down 17 pdr, the 77mmHV was used to equip the [[Comet tank]] in the last year of the war.\n\nThe closest the British came to developing an armored tank destroyer in the vein of the German Jagdpanzers or Soviet ISU series was the Churchill 3-inch Gun Carrier\u2014a [[Churchill tank]] chassis with a boxy superstructure in place of the turret and mounting a [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch anti-aircraft gun]]. Although a number were ordered and fifty delivered in 1942, they were not put into service as the immediate threat passed. The design was rejected in favor of developing a 17 pounder armed Cromwell tank variant, ultimately leading to the [[Comet tank]]. The [[Tortoise (tank)|Tortoise]] \"heavy assault tank\", intended for use in breaking through fixed defensive lines, was well armoured and had a very powerful 32-pounder (94&nbsp;mm) gun, but did not reach service use.\n\nBy 1944, a number of the [[Sherman tank|Shermans]] in British use were being converted to [[Sherman Fireflies]] by adding the QF 17 pounder gun. Initially this gave each troop (platoon) of Shermans one powerfully armed tank. By war's end\u2014through the production of more Fireflies and the replacement of Shermans by British tanks\u2014about 50% of Shermans in British service were Fireflies.\n\n==== Romania ====\n[[File:TACAM T-60.jpg|thumb|180x180px|TACAM T-60s  during Romania's National Day Parade (May 10th, 1943)]]\n\nDuring World War 2, the Romanians made some tank destroyers by removing the turrets of some of their tanks and adding a compartment and a stronger gun that could face the new Soviet tanks that were much stronger than the Romanian ones. One of these tank destroyers was the [[TACAM T-60]] created on the hull of the Soviet [[T-60]] light tank by removing its turret and adding a compartment together with a [[76 mm divisional gun M1936 (F-22)|76,2 FL-22 L/51 model 1936]] gun. Another tank destroyer was the [[TACAM R-2]] created by removing the turret of the [[Panzer 35(t)|R-2]] light tank (name of the Czechoslovakian LT vz. 35 in the Romanian army) and adding to it a compartment together with a Soviet [[76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)|76.2mm ZiS-3 gun]]. There were 21 pieces made of which 1 survived and can be found in the National Military Museum, Bucharest. The only turreted tank destroyer made by Romania was the [[Renault R35#Romania|V\u00e2n\u0103torul de care R-35]], created by extending the turret of the French [[Renault R35|Renault R-35]] tank and adding to it a 45&nbsp;mm gun instead of its [[Puteaux SA 18|37 mm]] gun. Another tank destroyer was the [[Mare\u015fal tank destroyer|Mare\u015fal]], which is credited with being the inspiration for the German Jagdpanzer 38(t).<ref>Steven J. Zaloga, ''Tanks of Hitler\u2019s Eastern Allies 1941\u201345'', p. 31</ref> The first prototypes were made on a modified T-60 hull and were equipped with a [[122 mm howitzer M1910/30|122 mm Soviet howitzer]]. Other guns used were a [[76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)|Soviet 76 mm gun]] and the Romanian [[75 mm Re\u0219i\u021ba Model 1943|75 mm DT-UDR 26 Re\u015fi\u0163a]]. The prototypes and plans were captured by the Soviets after they invaded Romania. Two planned tank destroyers were the [[TACAM R-1]] and the [[TACAM T-38]].<ref>Axworthy, Mark; Scafes, Cornel; Craciunoiu, Cristian (1995).

In the late 1960s, West Germany developed the [[Kanonenjagdpanzer]], essentially a modernized World War II Jagdpanzer mounting a {{nowrap|90 mm}} gun. As Soviet designs became more heavily armored, the {{nowrap|90 mm}} gun became ineffective and the Kanonenjagdpanzers were retrofitted for different roles or retired. Some provisions were made for the fitting of a 105&nbsp;mm cannon, and many of the vehicles were modified to fire [[Euromissile HOT|HOT]] or [[TOW missile]]s in place of a main gun. These upgraded variants remained in service into the 1990s.<ref>([[#References|Gelbart 1996:137-8]])</ref>\n\nWith the development of flexible [[anti-tank missile]]s, which were capable of installation on almost any vehicle in the 1960s, the concept of the tank destroyer has morphed into light vehicles with missiles. With the weight of [[main battle tank]]s growing to the forty to seventy-tonne range, airborne forces were unable to deploy reasonable anti-tank forces. The result was a number of attempts to make a light vehicle, including the conventional [[ASU-85]], the recoilless rifle-armed [[Ontos]], and missile-armed [[Malkara missile#FV1620 Humber Hornet|Hornet Malkara]] armored car and [[M551 Sheridan|Sheridan]] light assault vehicle. The latest entry into that category is the [[2S25|2S25 Sprut-SD]], armed with a current-issue 125&nbsp;mm tank gun that is also capable of launching missiles like the [[9M119 Svir]].\n\n==21st century==\nMany forces' [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s (IFVs) carry [[anti-tank missile]]s in every infantry platoon, and [[attack helicopter]]s have also added anti-tank capability to the modern battlefield. But there are still dedicated anti-tank vehicles with very heavy long-range missiles, and ones intended for [[Airborne forces|airborne]] use.\n\n[[Image:NM142 x 3.jpg|thumb|A Norwegian anti-tank platoon equipped with [[NM142]] TOW missile launchers]]\n\nThere have also been dedicated anti-tank vehicles built on ordinary [[armoured personnel carrier|armored personnel carrier]] or [[armored car (military)|armored car]] chassis. Examples include the U.S. [[M901 ITV|M901 ITV (Improved TOW Vehicle)]] and the Norwegian [[NM142]], both on an [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]] chassis, several [[Soviet Army|Soviet]] ATGM launchers based on the [[BRDM]] reconnaissance car, the British [[FV438 Swingfire]] and [[FV102 Striker]] and the German [[Raketenjagdpanzer]] series built on the chassis of the [[HS 30]] and [[Marder (IFV)|Marder]] IFV.\n\nA [[United States Army|US Army]] combined arms battalion has two infantry companies with TOW missile-armed [[M2 Bradley|Bradley IFVs]] and can bring a large concentration of accurate and lethal fire to bear on an attacking enemy unit that uses AFVs. They can be complemented by mobile units of AH-64 Apache helicopters armed with Hellfire antitank missiles.\n\n[[Image:Pzj Tow PIRANHA - Schweizer Armee - Steel Parade 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Mowag Piranha]]\u2013based, [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-armed ATGM carrier of the [[Swiss Army]]]]\n\nMissile carrying vehicles however are referred to as [[anti-tank missile carriers]] instead of tank destroyers.\n\nSome gun-armed tank destroyers remain in use. China has developed the tracked [[Type 89 (Tank Destroyer)|PTZ89]] and the wheeled [[PTL02]] tank destroyers. The PTZ89 is armed with a {{nowrap|120 mm}} smoothbore cannon while the PTL02, developed by NORINCO for the PLA's new light (rapid reaction) mechanized infantry divisions, carries a {{nowrap|100 mm}} one (a version armed with a 105&nbsp;mm rifled gun is available for export). The PTL02 is built on the 6\u00d76 wheeled chassis of the [[WZ551]] APC.\n\nItaly and Spain use the Italian-built [[Centauro]], a wheeled tank destroyer with a {{nowrap|105 mm}} cannon.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Armoured warfare]]\n*[[Jagdpanzer]]\n*[[Panzerj\u00e4ger]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Harry Yeide, (2005) ''The Tank Killers: A History of America's World War II Tank Destroyer Force.''

By the start of the new war, the German army possessed some highly effective reconnaissance vehicles, such as the ''[[Schwerer Panzersp\u00e4hwagen]]''.\n\nThe Soviet [[BA-64]] was influenced by a captured ''[[Leichter Panzersp\u00e4hwagen]]'' before it was first tested in January 1942.\n\nIn the second half of the war, the American [[M8 Greyhound]] and the British [[Daimler Armoured Car]]s featured turrets mounting light guns (40&nbsp;mm or less). As with other wartime armored cars, their reconnaissance roles emphasized greater speed and stealth than a tracked vehicle could provide, so their limited armor, armament and off-road capabilities were seen as acceptable compromises.\n\n==Military use==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\n{{See also|List of military armored cars}}\n[[File:White M3A1.jpeg|thumb|A preserved, World War 2, American [[M3 Scout Car]]]]\nA military armored car is a type of [[armored fighting vehicle]] having [[wheel]]s (from four to ten large, off-road wheels) instead of [[Caterpillar track|tracks]], and usually light [[vehicle armor|armor]]. Armored cars are typically less expensive and on roads have better speed and range than tracked military vehicles. They do however have less mobility as they have less off-road capabilities because of the higher ground pressure. They also have less obstacle climbing capabilities than tracked vehicles. Wheels are more vulnerable to enemy fire than tracks, they have a higher signature and in most cases less armor than comparable tracked vehicles. As a result, they are not intended for heavy fighting; their normal use is for [[reconnaissance]], command, control, and communications, or for use against lightly armed insurgents or rioters. Only some are intended to enter close combat, often accompanying convoys to protect soft-skinned vehicles.\n\nLight armored cars, such as the British [[Ferret armoured car|Ferret]] are armed with just a machine gun. Heavier vehicles are armed with [[autocannon]] or a large caliber gun. The heaviest armored cars, such as the German, World War II era [[SdKfz 234]] or the modern, US [[M1128 Mobile Gun System]], mount the same guns that arm medium tanks.\n\n[[Image:DanishResistanceAC2795.jpg|thumb|left|Vehicle built by railway shop workers for the [[Danish resistance movement]], near the end of World War 2]]\nArmored cars are popular for peacekeeping or internal security duties. Their appearance is less confrontational and threatening than tanks, and their size and maneuverability is said to be more compatible with tight urban spaces designed for wheeled vehicles. However, they do have a larger turning radius compared to tracked vehicles which can turn on the spot and their tires are vulnerable and are less capable in climbing and crushing obstacles. Further, when there is true combat they are easily outgunned and lightly armored. The threatening appearance of a tank is often enough to keep an opponent from attacking, whereas a less threatening vehicle such as an armored car is more likely to be attacked.\n\nMany modern forces now have their dedicated armored car designs, to exploit the advantages noted above. Examples would be the [[M1117 Armored Security Vehicle]] of the USA or [[Alvis Saladin]] of the post-World War II era in the United Kingdom.\n\nAlternatively, civilian vehicles may be modified into improvised armored cars in ''ad hoc'' fashion. Many militias and irregular forces adapt civilian vehicles into AFVs (armored fighting vehicles) and troop carriers, and in some regional conflicts these [[technical (fighting vehicle)|\"technicals\"]] are the only combat vehicles present. On occasion, even the soldiers of national militaries are forced to adapt their [[Gun truck|civilian-type vehicles]] for combat use, often using [[Improvised vehicle armour|improvised armor]] and scrounged weapons.\n\n=== Scout cars ===\n{{main|Scout car}}\n\nIn the 1930s, a new sub-class of armored car emerged in the [[United States]], known as the ''scout car''.

The ZSU-23 is the canonical modern SPAAG system.]]\n{{History of the tank|state-uncllopsed}}\nAn '''anti-aircraft vehicle''', also known as a '''self-propelled anti-aircraft gun''' ('''SPAAG''') or '''self-propelled air defense system''' ('''SPAD'''), is a mobile vehicle with a dedicated [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft capability]]. The [[Russian language|Russian]] equivalent of ''SPAAG'' is ''ZSU'', for ''zenitnaya samokhodnaya ustanovka'', (\"anti-aircraft self-propelled mount\").\n\nSpecific weapon systems used include [[machine gun]]s, [[autocannon]]s, larger guns, or [[missile]]s, and some mount both guns and longer-ranged missiles (e.g. the [[Pantsir-S1]]). Platforms used include both [[truck]]s and heavier [[combat vehicle]]s such as [[armoured personnel carrier|APCs]] and [[tank]]s, which add protection from aircraft, artillery, and small arms fire for front line deployment.\n\nAnti-aircraft guns are usually mounted in a quickly-traversing [[gun turret|turret]] with a high rate of elevation, for tracking fast-moving aircraft. They are often in dual or quadruple mounts, allowing a high rate of fire. In addition, most anti-aircraft guns can be used in a direct-fire role against surface targets to great effect. Today, [[missile]]s (generally mounted on similar turrets) have largely supplanted anti-aircraft guns.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:3inch20cwtAAgunPeerlessLorryWWI.jpg|thumb|right|A World War 1, British, truck\u2013mounted, QF 3 inch gun]]\n\n===World War I===\nAnti-aircraft machine guns have long been mounted on trucks, and these were quite common during [[World War I]]. A predecessor of the WWII German \"88\" anti-aircraft gun, the WWI German 77&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, was truck-mounted and used to great effect against British tanks.\n\nThe British [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt]] was mounted on trucks for use on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].\n\n===Inter-war period===\nBetween the two World Wars the United Kingdom developed the [[Birch gun]], a general purpose artillery piece on an armoured tracked chassis capable of maintaining formation with their current tanks over terrain. The gun could be elevated for anti-aircraft use.\n\nVickers Armstrong also developed a SPAAG based on the chassis of the Mk.E 6-ton light tank/Dragon Medium Mark IV tractor, mounting a Vickers QF-1 \"Pom-Pom\" gun of 40&nbsp;mm. About 26 were sold to [[Siam]] and saw action as infantry support guns and AA guns during the [[Franco-Thai war]] (1940-1941) along with 30 Vickers Mk.E Type B 6-ton tanks. This was probably the first tracked SPAAG manufactured in series. Later the British also developed a version of the [[Light Tank Mark VI|Mk.VI Light Tank]] armed with four machine guns that was known as Light Tank AA Mk.I. And also a twin 15&nbsp;mm version based on the Light Tank Mk.V was built.\n\nAmong early pre-war pioneers of self-propelled AA guns were the Germans. By the time of the war, they fielded the SdKfz 10/4 and 6/2, cargo halftracks mounting single 20&nbsp;mm or 37&nbsp;mm AA guns (respectively). Later in the war similar German halftracks mounted [[Flakvierling|quadruple 20&nbsp;mm weapons]].\n\n===World War II===\n[[Image:Wirbelwind CFB Borden 2.jpg|thumb|German ''Wirbelwind'' - a [[2 cm Flak 30/38/Flakvierling#2 cm Flakvierling 38|20 mm ''Flakvierling'']] quadmount on a [[Panzer IV]] chassis.]]\nLarger guns followed on larger trucks, but these mountings generally required off-truck setup in order to unlimber the stabilizing legs these guns needed. One exception to this rule was the Italian [[Cannone da 90/53]] which was highly effective when mounted on trucks, a fit known as the \"''autocannoni da 90/53''\". The 90/53 was a feared weapon, notably in the anti-tank role, but only a few hundred had been produced by the time of the armistice in 1943.\n\nOther nations tended to work on truck chassis. Starting in 1941, the British developed the \"en [[portee]]\" method of mounting an anti-tank gun (initially a [[2 pounder]]) on a truck. This was to prevent the weapon from being damaged by long-distance towing across rough, stony deserts, and it was intended only to be a carrying method, with the gun unloaded for firing. However, crews tended to fire their weapons from their vehicles for the mobility this method provided, with consequent casualties.<ref name=\"avalon\">''[[Advanced Squad Leader]]'', [[Avalon Hill]]</ref>  \nThis undoubtedly inspired their Morris C9/B (officially the \"Carrier, SP, 4x4, 40 mm AA\"), a Bofors 40&nbsp;mm AA gun mounted on a chassis derived from the [[Morris C8|Morris \"Quad\"]] Field Artillery Tractor truck.<ref name=\"avalon\" /> Similar types, based on 3-ton lorries, were produced in Britain, Canada and Australia, and together formed the most numerous self-propelled AA guns in British service.<ref name=\"avalon\" />\n\nThe U.S. Army brought truck-towed [[Bofors 40 mm]] AA guns along with truck-mounted units fitted with mechanized turrets when they sailed, first for Great Britain and then onto France. The turrets carried four .50&nbsp;inch (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns, which were designed to be adjusted to converge at the single point where enemy aircraft were expected to appear at low altitude in conduction of strafing runs directed at large infantry and field artillery units.\n\nInterest in mobile AA turned to heavier vehicles with the mass and stability needed to easily train weapons of all sizes. Probably the desire, particularly in German service, for anti-aircraft vehicles to be armoured for their own protection also assisted this trend.\n\nThe concept of an armored SPAAG was pioneered by [[Hungary]] during [[World War II]] by producing the [[40M Nimrod]] based on the [[Luftv\u00e4rnskanonvagn L-62 Anti II]] license acquired from Sweden. Germany followed later with their \"''Flakpanzer''\" series. German World War II SPAAGs include the [[M\u00f6belwagen]], [[Wirbelwind]], [[Ostwind]] and [[Kugelblitz]]. Other forces followed with designs of their own, notably the American M16 created by mounting [[M45 Quadmount|quadruple M2HB Browning machine guns]] on a [[M3 Half-track]].\n\nThe British developed their own SPAAGs throughout the war mounting multiple machine guns and light cannon on various tank and armoured car chassis and by 1943, the [[Crusader tank|Crusader AA tanks]], which mounted the [[Bofors 40 mm]] gun or two-three [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]]. Although used during the Normandy landings, by that point German aircraft were contained by the Allies own air forces and they were largely unneeded.\n\n===Cold War and later===\n[[File:Brno, \u0158e\u010dkovice, transport\u00e9r Praga V33 II.JPG|thumb|Czechoslovak self-propelled anti-aircraft gun [[M53/59 Praga]] developed in the late 1950s.]]\n[[File:Gepard 1a2 overview.jpg|thumb|[[Flakpanzer Gepard]], combining radars, fire control and two 35&nbsp;mm guns in a new turret mounted on a surplus Leopard chassis.]]\n[[File:2008 Moscow Victory Day Parade - 9K22 Tunguska.jpg|thumb|right|Typical of more modern designs, the [[Tunguska-M1]] mounts both missiles and cannons.]]The introduction of [[jet engine]]s and the subsequent rough doubling of aircraft speeds greatly reduced the effectiveness of the SPAAG against attack aircraft.{{dubious | date=July 2014}} A typical SPAAG round might have a muzzle velocity on the order of {{convert|1000|m/s|foot/s}} and might take as long as two to three seconds to reach a target at its maximum range. An aircraft flying at {{convert|1000|km/h|mph}} is moving at a rate of about {{convert|280|m/s|foot/s}}. This means the aircraft will have moved hundreds of meters during the flight time of the shells, greatly complicating the aiming problem to the point where close passes were essentially impossible to aim using manual gunsights. This speed also allowed the aircraft to rapidly fly out of range of the guns; even if the aircraft passes directly over the SPAAG, it would be within its firing radius for under 30 seconds.\n\nSPAAG development continued through the early 1950s with ever-larger guns, improving the range and allowing the engagement to take place at longer distances where the crossing angle was smaller and aiming was easier. Examples including the 40&nbsp;mm U.S. [[M42 Duster]] and the 57&nbsp;mm [[Soviet]] [[ZSU-57-2]]. However, both were essentially obsolete before they entered service, and found employment solely in the ground-support role. The M42 was introduced to the [[Vietnam War]] to counter an expected North Vietnamese air offensive, but when this failed to materialize it was used as an effective direct-fire weapon. The ZSU-57 found similar use in the [[Yugoslav Wars]], where its high-angle fire was useful in the mountainous terrain.\n\nBy the late 1950s the US Army had given up on the SPAAG concept, considering all gun-based weapons to be useless against modern aircraft. This belief was generally held by many forces, and the anti-aircraft role turned almost exclusively to missile systems. The Soviet Union remained an outlier, beginning development of a new SPAAG in 1957, which emerged as the [[ZSU-23-4]] in 1965. This system included search-and-track radars, fire control, and automatic gun-laying, greatly increasing its effectiveness against modern targets. The ZSU-23 proved very effective when used in concert with SAMs; the presence of SAMs forced aircraft to fly low to avoid their radars, placing them within range of the ZSUs.\n\nThe success of the ZSU-23 led to a resurgence of SPAAG development. This was also prompted by the introduction of [[attack helicopter]]s in the 1970s, which could hide behind terrain and then \"pop up\" for an attack lasting only a few tens of seconds; missiles were ineffective at low altitudes, while the helicopters would often be within range of the guns for a rapid counterattack. Notable among these later systems is the German [[Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer Gepard|Gepard]], the first western SPAAG to offer performance equal to or better than the ZSU. This system was widely copied in various [[NATO]] forces.\n\nSPAAG development continues, with many modern examples often combining both guns and short-range missiles. Examples include the Soviet/Russian [[Tunguska-M1]], which supplanted the ZSU-23 in service, newer versions of the Gepard, the Chinese [[Type 95 SPAAA]], and the British [[Marksman anti-aircraft system|Marksman turret]], which can be used on a wide variety of platforms. Some forces, like the [[United States Army|US Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] have mostly forgone self-propelled guns in favor of systems with short-range infrared-guided surface-to-air missiles in the [[AN/TWQ-1 Avenger]] and [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle#M6 Linebacker|M6 Linebacker]], which don't require radar to be accurate and are generally more reliable and cost-effective to field, though their ability to provide ground support is more limited. The U.S. army did use the [[M163 VADS]] and developed the prototype design of the [[M247 Sergeant York]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Man-portable air-defense system]]\n* [[Flakpanzer]], a collective term for German anti-aircraft tanks, particularly those used in World War II.\n* [[List of anti-aircraft guns]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Weapon}}\n[[Category:Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapons| ]]\n[[Category:Armoured fighting vehicles by type]]", "sha1": "65lgq1dgqrkezvoe7mluggjr6j1wrjx"}}, {"title": "AZ Alkmaar", "ns": "0", "id": "2289", "revision": {"id": "862515648", "parentid": "859364283", "timestamp": "2018-10-04T21:49:07Z", "contributor": {"ip": "109.76.25.76"}, "comment": "/* Current squad 2018/2019 */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the men's association football team|the women's team|AZ Alkmaar (women)}}\n{{more footnotes|date=August 2013}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}\n{{Infobox football club\n| clubname    = AZ\n| image       = AZ Alkmaar.svg\n| fullname    = ''Alkmaar Zaanstreek''\n| nickname    = ''Cheeseheads''\n| short name  = ''AZ''\n| founded     = {{Start date and age|1967|05|10|df=y}}\n| dissolved   =\n| ground      = [[AFAS Stadion]]\n| capacity    = 17,023\n| coordinates =\n| owntitle    = Executive director <br /> Technical director\n| owner       = [[Robert Eenhoorn]] <br /> [[Max Huiberts]]\n| chrtitle    =\n| chairman    = Ren\u00e9 Neelissen\n| manager     = [[John van den Brom]]\n| league      = [[Eredivisie]]\n| season      = [[2017\u201318 Eredivisie|2017\u201318]]\n| position    = Eredivisie, 3rd\n| current     = 2018\u201319 Eredivisie\n| website     = http://www.az.nl/\n| pattern_la1 = _az1819h\n| pattern_b1  = _az1819h\n| pattern_ra1 = _az1819h\n| pattern_sh1 = _az1819h\n| pattern_so1 = _az1819h\n| leftarm1    = FD1220\n| body1       = FD1220\n| rightarm1   = FD1220\n| shorts1     = FFFFFF\n| socks1      = FFFFFF\n| pattern_la2 = _az1718a\n| pattern_b2  = _az1718a\n| pattern_ra2 = _az1718a\n| pattern_sh2 = _az1718a\n| pattern_so2 = _az1718a\n| leftarm2    = 000000\n| body2       = 000000\n| rightarm2   = 000000\n| shorts2     = 000000\n| socks2      = 000000\n| pattern_la3 = _az1718t\n| pattern_b3  = _az1718t\n| pattern_ra3 = _az1718t\n| pattern_sh3 = _az1718t\n| pattern_so3 = _az1718t\n| leftarm3    = 06006D\n| body3       = 1144F8\n| rightarm3   = 1144F8\n| shorts3     = 1144F8\n| socks3      = 06006D\n}}\n\n'''Alkmaar Zaanstreek''' ({{IPA-nl|\u02c8\u0251lkma\u02d0r \u02c8za\u02d0nstre\u02d0k|}}), better known as '''AZ Alkmaar''' or simply '''AZ''' ({{IPA-nl|a\u02d0\u02c8z\u025bt}}), is a Dutch professional [[Association football|football]] club from [[Alkmaar]] and the [[Zaanstreek]]. The club plays in the [[Eredivisie]], the highest professional football league in the Netherlands, and hosts home matches at the [[AFAS Stadion]].\n\nAZ has won the Eredivisie twice, in [[1980\u201381 Eredivisie|1980\u201381]] and [[2008\u201309 Eredivisie|2008\u201309]]. In the same season as their first league title, they also reached the [[1981 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final]], which they lost to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. In addition, the team has won the [[KNVB Cup]] on four occasions.\n\n==History==\n\n===1954\u20131972: Foundation and first years===\nAZ was founded on 10 May 1967 as '''AZ '67''', the result of a merger of '''Alkmaar '54''' and '''FC Zaanstreek'''. FC Zaanstreek was formed in 1964, continuing the professional adventure of the [[Koog aan de Zaan|Kooger]] Football Club ('''[[:nl:KFC (voetbalclub)|KFC]]'''). KFC had been founded in 1910, had nearly become National Champion in 1934 through a narrow loss to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in the finals, and had been professional since 1955.\n\nIn 1964, the brothers Cees and Klaas Molenaar, former players for KFC and owners of a growing appliance store chain, sought to create a powerful football team in Zaanstreek by merging the two local professional teams: KFC and [[:nl:ZFC (voetbalclub)|Zaanlandsche Football Club]].\n\nAfter this merger failed, they successfully merged KFC (now \"FC Zaanstreek\") with Alkmaar '54; the team would be based in Alkmaar. Partially through the hiring of expensive foreign players, the new club soon acquired large debts.\n\n===1972\u20131985: The Molenaar years===\nIn 1972, the Molenaar brothers bailed it out and invested heavily in the club, to the point that AZ '67 were successful in the late 1970s and early '80s, regularly playing European football from 1977 to 1982 while also winning three [[KNVB Cup]]s over that period.\n\nAfter four close league campaigns, AZ finally became [[Eredivisie|Dutch champions]] in [[1980\u201381 Eredivisie|1981]], becoming the only team other than the \"big three\" of Ajax, [[Feyenoord]] and [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] to do so in a 44-year period spanning from 1965 to 2009 (when AZ once again won the league title). They won the title with overwhelming power, winning 27 of 34 matches and only losing once while scoring a club record 101 goals and conceding just 30. That same season, AZ reached the [[1981 UEFA Cup Final|final of the UEFA Cup]], losing 5\u20134 on aggregate to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. The next year, in the [[1981\u201382 European Cup|European Cup]], they lost in the second round 3\u20132 on aggregate to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].\n\n[[Georg Ke\u00dfler]] was AZ's manager over most of these years (1978\u201382), while star players included: [[Kees Kist]], the club's highest ever goalscorer with 212 goals and the first ever Dutchman to win the [[European Golden Shoe|European Golden Boot]] in 1979 when he scored 34 goals in a season; [[Jan Peters (footballer)|Jan Peters]], who played 120 matches for AZ during this period scoring 30 goals from midfield; and [[Hugo Hovenkamp]], who played 239 matches in defence for AZ from 1975\u201383, as well as receiving 31 caps for the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]] from 1977\u20131983 and playing each match in [[UEFA Euro 1980]] while an AZ player. Additional stars included [[John Metgod]], who spent six years at AZ playing 195 matches as a defender, scoring 26 goals including a goal against Ipswich Town in the final of the UEFA Cup. Like Hovenkamp, Metgod was also included in the Dutch squad for Euro 1980. Meanwhile, Danish forward [[Kristen Nygaard (footballer)|Kristen Nygaard]] spent ten years at AZ, scoring 104 goals in 363 matches between 1972 and 1982.\n\n===1985\u20131993: The interim years===\n{{expand section|date=July 2014}}\nCo-owner Cees Molenaar died in 1979. AZ Alkmaar deteriorated after his brother, Klaas Molenaar, left the club in 1985. AZ was relegated in 1988 from the [[Eredivisie]].\n\n===1993\u20132009: The Scheringa years===\nThe involvement of businessman Dirk Scheringa in the mid-1990s marked the revival of the club as AZ returned to the Eredivisie in 1998. In the summer of 2006, the club moved to a new 17,000 capacity stadium, [[AZ Stadion]].\n\nDespite playing strongly for the majority of the 2006\u201307 season, AZ's season ended in disappointment. First, entering the last matchday of the [[2006\u201307 Eredivisie]] season, AZ led PSV and Ajax on goal difference at the top of the league table, but ended up third after losing their last match against the eventually-relegated, bottom-of-the-table [[S.B.V. Excelsior|Excelsior]], who played with ten men for 80 minutes. Additionally, AZ then lost the [[2006\u201307 KNVB Cup#Final|KNVB Cup final]] to Ajax 8\u20137 after a penalty shoot-out, while also falling to Ajax over two play-off matches for participation in the [[2007\u201308 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. After the season, key players like [[Tim de Cler]], [[Danny Koevermans]] and [[Shota Arveladze]] left the team.\n\n[[File:AZ Larisa UEFA Cup0708.jpg|thumb|right|220px|AZ versus [[Larissa F.C.|Larissa]] in a [[2007\u201308 UEFA Cup]] match.]]\nA remarkable run ended in the 2007\u201308 season: after AZ lost a group stage match against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] (3\u20132) in the [[2007\u201308 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], the club's unbeaten run of 32 home matches in European competitions \u2013 lasting from 1977 to 2007 \u2013 ended. AZ had a poor season, suffering elimination in the first round of the KNVB Cup and the group stage of the UEFA Cup, as well as finishing the [[2007\u201308 Eredivisie]] in 11th place. Towards the latter stages of the season, in March 2008, AZ manager [[Louis van Gaal]] had initially tendered his resignation, but after protests the players and directors, he rescinded his resignation.\n\nThe [[2008\u201309 Eredivisie|2008\u201309 season]] had an unpromising start after two opening defeats against [[NAC Breda]] and [[ADO Den Haag]]. However, starting with a 1\u20130 victory over defending league champions PSV, AZ did not lose a match in its next 28 matches, including a run of 11-straight matches where AZ did not concede an opposition goal. Three weeks before the end of the season, AZ became Eredivisie champions, edging nearest title rivals [[FC Twente|Twente]] and Ajax comfortably.\n\nBeing league champions, AZ qualified for the [[2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] for the second time, but only took four points from six matches and finished bottom of their group.\n\n===2009\u2013present===\nFor the 2009\u201310 season, [[Ronald Koeman]] succeeded Louis van Gaal, who had departed to manage [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] after leading AZ to the championship. Koeman was officially hired on 17 May 2009, but on 5 December, AZ announced he was no longer in charge of the club after losing 7 of his first 16 matches. Former [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit Saint Petersburg]] manager [[Dick Advocaat]] took over for the remainder of the season. Under Advocaat, AZ achieved solid results and secured European football for the next season.\n\nFor the 2010\u201311 season, AZ appointed [[Gertjan Verbeek]] as its new manager. They finished the [[2010\u201311 Eredivisie]] in fourth place, thus securing [[2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League|Europa League football]] for the next season, while in the [[2010\u201311 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]], AZ reached the last eight, where they were beaten by rivals Ajax by a 1\u20130 scoreline. AZ also finished third in their [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] group, thus failing to qualifying for the competition's knockout round.\n\nIn the 2011\u201312 season, AZ finished fourth in the [[2011\u201312 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]], though performed significantly better in cup competitions, reaching the semi-finals in the [[2011\u201312 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]] (losing to [[Heracles Almelo|Heracles]] after extra time) and the quarter-finals in the Europa League. In the latter, the club ultimately lost to [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] after having defeated [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]], [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], [[Malm\u00f6 FF]], [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]], [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]], [[Aalesunds FK|Aalesund]] and [[FK Baumit Jablonec|Baumit Jablonec]] to reach that stage.\n\nOn 21 December 2011, during the quarter-finals of the [[2011\u201312 KNVB Cup]], a 19-year-old Ajax fan invaded the [[Amsterdam Arena]] pitch in the 36th minute with Ajax winning 1\u20130, attacking AZ goalkeeper [[Esteban Alvarado]]. The fan slipped and Alvarado kicked the fan twice, prompting the referee to issue the goalkeeper a red card. Following this, AZ manager Gertjan Verbeek ordered his players to leave the pitch for the dressing room in protest. The match was later played on 19 January 2012, with Alvarado's red card rescinded; AZ won 3\u20132.\n\nThe 2012\u201313 season started in the [[2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round|Europa League]] with a qualifying play-off round against [[Guus Hiddink]]'s [[FC Anzhi Makhachkala|Anzhi Makhachkala]]. AZ was hammered 6\u20130 on aggregate. Disappointingly, AZ finished tenth in the [[2012\u201313 Eredivisie]], although the club won the [[2012\u201313 KNVB Cup]] after defeating PSV 2\u20131 in the [[2012\u201313 KNVB Cup#Final|final]]. As cup winners, AZ automatically qualified for the [[2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League|2013\u201314 Europa League]].\n\nIn September 2013, just one day after emphatically beating PSV, at the time the [[2013\u201314 Eredivisie|league leaders]], Verbeek was dismissed as first team manager by the club due to \"a lack of chemistry\" between management and players.<ref>http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11912/8948012/eredivisie-az-alkmaar-announce-surprise-sacking-of-coach-gertjan-verbeek</ref> He was replaced by Dick Advocaat for the remainder of the season until a permanent replacement could be found. Advocaat took AZ to the semi-finals of the [[2013\u201314 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]], the quarter-finals of the [[2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] and eighth in the league, ultimately losing to [[FC Groningen|Groningen]] in the Europa League play-off final round (their 58th match of the season, a club record).\n\nThe [[2014\u201315 Eredivisie|2014\u201315 season]] began with a new manager, former [[SC Heerenveen|Heerenveen]] manager and Ajax great [[Marco van Basten]]. However, after just three matches into the season, Van Basten resigned as manager to become assistant manager under [[Alex Pastoor]], citing heavy stress as the main reason.<ref>https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2014/09/16/van-basten-doet-stap-terug-bij-az-alex-pastoor-nieuwe-trainer-a1422387</ref> Pastoor was the interim manager during two matches under Van Basten's absence and received the official title on 16 September, but contract negotiations failed and he left the club just two days later. A week later, [[John van den Brom]] was appointed manager. Under Van den Brom, AZ quickly rose up to the sub-top, eventually finished the season in third place, surpassing Feyenoord on the final season's matchday and qualifying for the [[2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League|2015\u201316 Europa League]].\n\nThe [[2015\u201316 Eredivisie]] started with AZ selling most of its first-team players from the previous season during the summer transfer period. As a response, AZ bought players from other Dutch clubs, notably [[Vincent Janssen]] from [[Almere City FC|Almere City]], [[Alireza Jahanbakhsh]] from [[N.E.C. (football club)|NEC]] and [[Ben Rienstra]] from [[PEC Zwolle]]. In December, it was announced free agent [[Ron Vlaar]] signed a contract until the end of the season after training with the club for a few weeks prior.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/07/ron-vlaar-az-alkmaar-aston-villa</ref> Vlaar quickly became team captain and helped lift AZ from tenth place to a fourth-place finish in the league. Along this rise, new signing Vincent Janssen scored 27 goals for the club, earning him the Eredivisie top goalscorer title. In the [[2015\u201316 KNVB Cup]], AZ made it to the semi-finals, losing 3\u20131 to Feyenoord. AZ won the first two qualification rounds to qualify for the 2015\u201316 Europa League group stage, but finished last in their group.\n\nAt the start of the [[2016\u201317 Eredivisie]], AZ sold last season's performer Vincent Janssen to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and long-time midfielder [[Markus Henriksen]] to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. In the [[2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League|2016\u201317 Europa League]], AZ finished second in Group D, surviving the group stage for the third time in five seasons.\n\n==Current squad 2018/2019==\n{{updated|12 September 2018|<ref>{{cite web|title=Spelers |url=https://www.az.nl/teams/a-selectie/teams/a-selectie/spelers |work=www.az.nl |publisher=AZ |accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>}}\n\n''For recent transfers, see [[List of Dutch football transfers winter 2017\u201318]]''\n\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= 1|nat=NED|pos=GK|name=[[Marco Bizot]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 2|nat=NOR|pos=DF|name=[[Jonas Svensson (footballer)|Jonas Svensson]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 3|nat=GER|pos=DF|name=[[Henri Weigelt]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 4|nat=NED|pos=DF|name=[[Ron Vlaar]]|other=<small>[[Captain (association football)|vice-captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 5|nat=NED|pos=DF|name=[[Thomas Ouwejan]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 6|nat=NOR|pos=MF|name=[[Fredrik Midtsj\u00f8]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 7|nat=NED|pos=FW|name=[[Calvin Stengs]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 8|nat=NED|pos=MF|name=[[Teun Koopmeiners]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 9|nat=NOR|pos=FW|name=[[Bj\u00f8rn Maars Johnsen]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=NED|pos=MF|name=[[Guus Til]]|other=<small>[[Captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=NED|pos=FW|name=[[Oussama Idrissi]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=GRE|pos=DF|name=[[Pantelis Hatzidiakos]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=ROM|pos=FW|name=[[Dorin Rotariu]]|other=<small>on loan from [[Club Brugge KV|Brugge]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat=NED|pos=DF|name=[[Owen Wijndal]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=NED|pos=GK|name=[[Rody de Boer]]}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=NED|pos=MF|name=[[Jeremy Helmer]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=NED|pos=MF|name=[[Marko Vejinovi\u0107]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat=NED|pos=MF|name=[[Mats Seuntjens]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat=NED|pos=FW|name=[[Myron Boadu]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=NED|pos=GK|name=[[Piet Velthuizen]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=23|nat=NED|pos=DF|name=[[L\u00e9on Bergsma]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=24|nat=NED|pos=MF|name=[[Tijjani Reijnders]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=25|nat=NED|pos=GK|name=[[Jasper Schendelaar]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=26|nat=NED|pos=MF|name=[[Adam Maher]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=27|nat=CZE|pos=FW|name=[[Ond\u0159ej Mih\u00e1lik|Ondrej Mih\u00e1lik]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=28|nat=ISL|name=[[Albert Gu\u00f0mundsson (footballer, born 1997)|Albert Gu\u00f0mundsson]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=29|nat=NED|pos=MF|name=[[Mees Hoedemakers]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=30|nat=BEL|pos=DF|name=[[Stijn Wuytens]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=34|nat=NED|pos=DF|name=[[Ricardo van Rhijn]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=57|nat=MAR|pos=MF|name=[[Iliass Bel Hassani]]}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n===Out on loan===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=NED|pos=GK|name=[[Nick Olij]]|other=on loan at [[FC Oss]] until 30 June 2019}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n===Jong AZ===\nFor the reserve squad of AZ see: [[Jong AZ]].\n\n==Stadium and sponsor==\n{{See also|AFAS Stadion}}\n\n[[File:DSB-Stadion.jpg|250px|right|thumb|AFAS Stadion, AZ's home venue in Alkmaar]]\n\nAZ play its home matches at the [[AFAS Stadion]], located in the southern part of the city of Alkmaar. The stadium, which is directly owned by the club, was opened in 2006 and replaced the old [[Alkmaarderhout]] venue as the [[DSB Bank|DSB Stadion]]. The stadium currently has a capacity of 17,023. During its design stages, the name Victorie Stadion was frequently used, referring to the [[Eighty Years' War|Dutch War of Independence]], the phrase ''\"[[Siege of Alkmaar|In Alkmaar begint de victorie]]\" (Victory begins in Alkmaar)'' in particular. Until now, this name has not been officially in use, the board instead opting for sponsorship deals because of financial motives. However, to this day, the name maintains a good share of support among the fans.\n\nIn order to further increase revenue, AZ's board of directors decided to expand the capacity of the new stadium to at least 30,000 somewhere in the future. The extension will be realised by constructing a second tier to three of the four stands. The main stand with all technical areas, VIP and sponsor and media facilities will remain in place. These plans, however, were put on hold after the DSB bankruptcy and there are no current plans to increase the capacity.\n\nIn October 2009, sponsor [[DSB Bank]] was declared bankrupt. The stadium name temporarily changed from DSB Stadion to AZ Stadion, as it was considered undesirable that the stadium was linked with a non-existent bank. In February 2010, a new main sponsor was found in construction works service provider BUKO, based in [[Beverwijk]].\n\nA year later, in the 2010\u201311 season, [[AFAS Erp Software]] took over as official shirt sponsor, also taking over duties as stadium sponsor. The current external name of the ground is the AFAS Stadion.\n\n==Honours==\n\n===Domestic===\n[[File:AZ Eredivisie Results 1976-2009.jpg|thumb|right|350px|AZ Eredivisie Results 1976 to 2009]]\n*; [[Eredivisie]]\n**''Winners (2): '' [[1980\u201381 Eredivisie|1980\u201381]], [[Eredivisie 2008\u201309|2008\u201309]]\n**''Runners-up (2): '' [[1979\u201380 Eredivisie|1979\u201380]], [[Eredivisie 2005\u201306|2005\u201306]]\n* '''[[Eerste Divisie]]'''\n**''Winners (3): '' [[Eerste Divisie 1959-60|1959\u201360]]<sup>1</sup>, [[Eerste Divisie 1995-96|1995\u201396]], [[Eerste Divisie 1997-98|1997\u201398]]\n**''Runners-up (3): '' [[Eerste Divisie 1956-57|1956\u201357]]<sup>1</sup>, [[Eerste Divisie 1967-68|1967\u201368]], [[Eerste Divisie 1971-72|1971\u201372]]\n* '''[[Tweede Divisie]]'''\n**''Runners-up (1): '' [[Tweede Divisie 1963\u201364|1963\u201364]]<sup>1</sup>\n* '''[[KNVB Cup]]'''\n**''Winners (4): '' [[1977\u201378 KNVB Cup|1977\u201378]], [[1980\u201381 KNVB Cup|1980\u201381]], [[1981\u201382 KNVB Cup|1981\u201382]], [[2012\u201313 KNVB Cup|2012\u201313]]\n**''Runners-up (3): '' [[2006\u201307 KNVB Cup|2006\u201307]], [[2016\u201317 KNVB Cup|2016\u201317]], [[2017\u201318 KNVB Cup|2017\u201318]]\n* '''[[Johan Cruyff Shield]]'''\n**''Winners (1):'' [[2009 Johan Cruyff Shield|2009]]\n**''Runners-up (1): '' [[2013 Johan Cruyff Shield|2013]]\n\n===International===\n* '''[[UEFA Cup]]'''\n**''Runners-up (1): '' [[1980\u201381 UEFA Cup|1980\u201381]]\n**''Semi-finalists (1): '' [[2004\u201305 UEFA Cup|2004\u201305]]\n**''Quarter-finalists (3): '' [[2006\u201307 UEFA Cup|2006\u201307]], [[2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League|2011\u201312]], [[2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League|2013\u201314]]\n{{refbegin}}<sup>1</sup> As Alkmaar '54{{refend}}\n\n==AZ in Europe==\nBelow is a table with AZ's international results in the past seasons.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n! colspan=5 | AZ in Europe\n|-\n! width=\"50\"|Year(s)\n! width=\"130\"|Tournament\n! width=\"110\"|Result\n!

Each gland has an outer [[adrenal cortex|cortex]] which produces [[steroid hormone]]s and an inner [[Adrenal medulla|medulla]]. The adrenal cortex itself is divided into three zones: the [[zona glomerulosa]], the [[zona fasciculata]] and the [[zona reticularis]].<ref name=ross />\n\nThe adrenal cortex produces three main types of [[steroid hormone]]s: [[mineralocorticoid]]s, [[glucocorticoid]]s, and [[androgen]]s.

The glucocorticoids [[cortisol]] and [[corticosterone]] are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of [[metabolism]] and [[immune system]] suppression. The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the [[gonad]]s and other target organs.<ref name=williams /> The production of steroid hormones is called [[Steroid#Steroidogenesis|steroidogenesis]], and involves a number of reactions and processes that take place in cortical cells.<ref name=\"miller auchus\" /> The medulla produces the [[catecholamine]]s [[adrenaline]] and [[noradrenaline]], which function to produce a [[Fight-or-flight response (in humans)|rapid response]] throughout the body in [[Stress (biology)|stress]] situations.<ref name=williams />\n\nA number of [[endocrine disease]]s involve dysfunctions of the adrenal gland.

In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by [[corticosterone]] instead. Glucocorticoids have many effects on [[metabolism]]. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of [[glucose]]. This is the result of an increase in the mobilization of [[amino acids]] from protein and the stimulation of [[Gluconeogenesis|synthesis of glucose]] from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of [[free fatty acids]], which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. Glucocorticoids also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including the suppression of the immune system and a potent [[anti-inflammatory]] effect. Cortisol reduces the capacity of [[osteoblast]]s to produce new bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]].<ref name=boron />\n\nThe adrenal gland secretes a basal level of cortisol but can also produce bursts of the hormone in response to [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) from the [[anterior pituitary]]. Cortisol is not evenly released during the day \u2013 its concentrations in the blood are highest in the early morning and lowest in the evening as a result of the [[circadian rhythm]] of ACTH secretion.<ref name=boron /> [[Cortisone]] is an inactive product of the action of the enzyme [[11-Beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase|11\u03b2-HSD]] on cortisol.

Therefore, the first step in [[Steroid#Steroidogenesis|steroidogenesis]] is cholesterol uptake or synthesis. Cells that produce steroid hormones can acquire cholesterol through two paths. The main source is through dietary cholesterol transported via the blood as [[cholesterol esters]] within [[low density lipoprotein]]s (LDL).

After the production of pregnenolone, specific enzymes of each cortical layer further modify it. Enzymes involved in this process include both mitochondrial and [[Microsome|microsomal]] P450s and [[hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]]s.

Glucocorticoid synthesis is stimulated by [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH), a hormone released into the bloodstream by the [[anterior pituitary]]. In turn, production of ACTH is stimulated by the presence of [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH), which is released by neurons of the [[hypothalamus]]. ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic P450 enzymes. The HPA axis is an example of a negative feedback system, in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis. The HPA axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the [[inflammatory response]].<ref name=\"williams\" />\n\nMineralocorticoid secretion is regulated mainly by the [[renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system]] (RAAS), the concentration of [[potassium]], and to a lesser extent the concentration of ACTH.<ref name=\"williams\" /> Sensors of blood pressure in the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]] of the kidneys release the enzyme [[renin]] into the blood, which starts a cascade of reactions that lead to formation of [[angiotensin II]].

These disorders affect the gland either directly (as with infections or autoimmune diseases) or as a result of the dysregulation of hormone production (as in some types of [[Cushing's syndrome]]) leading to an excess or insufficiency of adrenal hormones and the related symptoms.\n\n===Corticosteroid overproduction===\n====Cushing's syndrome====\n[[Cushing's syndrome]] is the manifestation of glucocorticoid excess. It can be the result of a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the [[HPA axis]] or the production of cortisol. Causes can be further classified into [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]]-dependent or ACTH-independent. The most common cause of [[endogeny|endogenous]] Cushing's syndrome is a [[pituitary adenoma]] which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair ([[hirsutism]]), [[osteoporosis]], depression, and most distinctively, [[striae|stretch marks]] in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.<ref name=williams /><ref name=\"harrison's\">{{cite book|last1=Longo|first1=D|last2=Fauci|first2=A|last3=Kasper|first3=D|last4=Hauser|first4=S|last5=Jameson|first5=J|last6=Loscalzo|first6=J|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0071748896|edition=18th}}</ref>\n\n====Primary aldosteronism====\nWhen the zona glomerulosa produces excess [[aldosterone]], the result is [[primary aldosteronism]]. Causes for this condition are bilateral [[hyperplasia]] (excessive tissue growth) of the glands, or aldosterone-producing [[adenoma]]s (a condition called [[Conn's syndrome]]). Primary aldosteronism produces hypertension and [[electrolyte]] imbalance, increasing [[potassium]] depletion and sodium retention.<ref name=\"harrison's\" />\n\n===Adrenal insufficiency===\nAdrenal insufficiency (the deficiency of [[glucocorticoid]]s) occurs in about 5 in 10,000 in the general population.<ref name=\"harrison's\" /> Diseases classified as ''primary adrenal insufficiency'' (including [[Addison's disease]] and genetic causes) directly affect the adrenal cortex. If a problem that affects the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] arises outside the gland, it is a ''secondary adrenal insufficiency''.\n\n====Addison's disease====\n[[File:T. Addison; On...supra-renal capsules Wellcome L0018484.jpg|thumb|right|Characteristic skin [[hyperpigmentation]] in [[Addison's disease]]]]\nAddison's disease refers to primary hypoadrenalism, which is a deficiency in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland. In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] condition, in which the body produces [[Antibody|antibodies]] against cells of the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from [[tuberculosis]]. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is [[hyperpigmentation]] of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.<ref name=williams />\n\nA complication seen in untreated Addison's disease and other types of primary adrenal insufficiency is the [[adrenal crisis]], a [[medical emergency]] in which low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels result in [[hypovolemic shock]] and symptoms such as vomiting and fever.

Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy, the most common cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) by the [[pituitary gland]].<ref name=\"harrison's\" /> This type of adrenal insufficiency usually does not affect the production of [[mineralocorticoid]]s, which are under regulation of the [[renin\u2013angiotensin system]] instead.<ref name=williams />\n\n====Congenital adrenal hyperplasia====\n[[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] is a [[congenital disease]] in which [[mutation]]s of enzymes that produce steroid hormones result in a glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the [[HPA axis]]. In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of [[corticotropin-releasing hormone|CRH]] and [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]], hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other adrenal steroids instead. The most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to [[21-hydroxylase]] deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not [[androgen]]s. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of [[adrenal androgen]]s, which can lead to the development of ambiguous [[genitalia]] and [[secondary sex characteristic]]s.<ref name=charmandari />\n\n===Adrenal tumors===\n{{Main|Adrenal tumor}}\nAdrenal tumors are commonly found as [[incidentaloma]]s, unexpected [[asymptomatic]] tumors [[incidental findings|found]] during [[medical imaging]].

During its approximately 3,100 years of written history,<ref>Beyer (1986: 11) suggests that written Aramaic probably dates from the 11th century BC, as it is established by the 10th century, to which he dates the oldest inscriptions of northern Syria. Heinrichs (1990: x) uses the less controversial date of the 9th century, for which there is clear and widespread attestation.</ref> Aramaic has served variously as a language of administration of empires and as a language of divine worship, religious study and as the spoken tongue of a number of [[Semitic people]]s from the [[Near East]].\n\nHistorically, Aramaic was the language of the [[Arameans]], a Semitic-speaking people of the region around between the northern [[Levant]] and the northern [[Euphrates]] valley. By around 1000 BC, the Arameans had a string of kingdoms in what is now part of western [[Syria]]. Aramaic rose to prominence under the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911\u2013605 BC), under whose influence Aramaic became a prestige language, and its use spread throughout most of [[Mesopotamia]] and the Levant. At its height, variants of Aramaic were spoken all over in what is today [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Kuwait]], [[Eastern Arabia]], Northern Arabia, and to a lesser extent parts of southeast and south central [[Turkey]], and parts of northwest [[Iran]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tsZdAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT253&dq |first=Hilary |last=Kilpatrick |chapter=Modernity in a Classical Arabic ''Adab'' Work, the ''Kit\u0101b al-Agh\u0101n\u012b'' |page=253 |isbn=9781136788123 |title=Tradition and Modernity in Arabic Language And Literature |editor-first=J.

Therefore, there is not one singular, static Aramaic language; each time and place rather has had its own variation. The more widely spoken [[Eastern Aramaic]] and [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] forms are today largely restricted to [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], northeastern Syria, northwestern Iran and southeastern Turkey, whilst the severely endangered [[Western Neo-Aramaic]] is spoken by small communities in northwestern Syria.\n\nCertain dialects of Aramaic are also retained as a [[sacred language]] by certain religious communities. One of those liturgical dialects is [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]], which besides being a living variant of Aramaic is also the liturgical language of [[Mandaeism]].

Aramaic also continues to be spoken by the Assyrians of Iraq, northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey and northwest Iran, with diaspora communities in [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and southern [[Russia]]. The [[Mandaeans]] also continue to use [[Mandaic language|Mandaic Aramaic]] as a liturgical language, although most now speak Arabic as their [[first language]]. There are still also a small number of first-language speakers of [[Western Aramaic languages|Western Aramaic varieties]] in isolated villages in western Syria.\n\nThe turbulence of the last two centuries (particularly the [[Assyrian genocide]]) has seen speakers of first-language and literary Aramaic dispersed throughout the world. However, there are a number of sizable Assyrian towns in northern Iraq such as [[Alqosh]], [[Bakhdida]], [[Bartella]], [[Tesqopa]], and [[Tel Keppe]], and numerous small villages, where Aramaic is still the main spoken language, and many large cities in this region also have Assyrian Aramaic-speaking communities, particularly [[Mosul]], [[Erbil]], [[Kirkuk]], [[Dohuk]], and [[al-Hasakah]].

Its long history, extensive literature, and use by different religious communities are all factors in the diversification of the language. Some Aramaic dialects are mutually intelligible, whereas others are not, not unlike the situation with modern [[varieties of Arabic]]. Some Aramaic languages are known under different names; for example, [[Syriac language|Syriac]] is particularly used to describe the [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic variety]] used in Christian ethnic communities in Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northeastern Syria, and northwestern Iran, and [[Saint Thomas Christians]] in India. Most dialects can be described as either \"Eastern\" or \"Western\", the dividing line being roughly the [[Euphrates]], or slightly west of it. It is also helpful to draw a distinction between those Aramaic languages that are modern living languages (often called \"Neo-Aramaic\"), those that are still in use as literary languages, and those that are extinct and are only of interest to scholars. Although there are some exceptions to this rule, this classification gives \"Modern\", \"Middle\", and \"Old\" periods, alongside \"Eastern\" and \"Western\" areas, to distinguish between the various languages and dialects that are Aramaic.\n\n==Writing system==\n{{Main|Aramaic alphabet}}\n[[File:Amen in East Syriac Aramaic language.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Amen in [[Syriac language|East Syriac Aramaic]]]]\n[[File:Syriac Sert\u00e2 book script.jpg|left|thumb|11th century book in [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac Serto]]]]\nThe earliest Aramaic alphabet was based on the [[Phoenician alphabet]]. In time, Aramaic developed its distinctive \"square\" style. The ancient Israelites and other peoples of [[Canaan]] adopted this alphabet for writing their own languages. Thus, it is better known as the [[Hebrew alphabet]] today. This is the writing system used in [[Biblical Aramaic]] and other Jewish writing in Aramaic. The other main writing system used for Aramaic was developed by Christian communities: a cursive form known as the [[Syriac alphabet]]. A highly modified form of the Aramaic alphabet, the [[Mandaic alphabet]], is used by the [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]].\n\nIn addition to these writing systems, certain derivatives of the Aramaic alphabet were used in ancient times by particular groups: the [[Nabataean alphabet]] in [[Petra]] and the [[Palmyrene alphabet]] in [[Palmyra]]. In modern times, [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] (see [[#Modern Eastern Aramaic|below]]) has sometimes been written in a [[Latin script]].\n\n==History==\n{| border=\"0\"  cellpadding=\"5\"  style=\"float:right; background:#ffffd9; margin-left:10px;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ffffd9;\"|<timeline>\nImageSize = width:320 height:700\nPlotArea = right:40 top:10 left:40 bottom:10\nDateFormat = yyyy\nTimeAxis = orientation:vertical order:reverse\nPeriod = from:-1200 till:2005\nAlignBars = early\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:200 start:-1200\nColors =\n id:canvas value:rgb(1,1,0.85)\nBackgroundColors = canvas:canvas\nPlotData =\n width:15 color:red\n bar:test from:-1200 till:200 # Old Aramaic\nPlotData =\n width:15 color:orange\n bar:test from:200 till:1200 # Middle Aramaic\nPlotData =\n width:15 color:yellow\n bar:test from:1200 till:2005 # Modern Aramaic\nPlotData =\n bar:test at:-1200 mark:(line,white)\n at:-1200 shift:(10,0) text:12th c.

As such, the term covers over thirteen centuries of the development of Aramaic. This vast time span includes all Aramaic that is now effectively extinct.\n\nThe central phase in the development of Old Aramaic was its official use by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (500\u2013330 BC). The period before this, dubbed \"Ancient Aramaic\", saw the development of the language from being spoken in Aramaean city-states to become a major means of communication in diplomacy and trade throughout [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]. After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, local vernaculars became increasingly prominent, fanning the divergence of an Aramaic [[dialect continuum]] and the development of differing written standards.\n\n===Ancient Aramaic===\n\"Ancient Aramaic\" refers to the earliest known period of the language, from its origin until it becomes the lingua franca of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. It was the language of the Aramean city-states of [[Damascus]], [[Hama]]th and [[Arpad, Syria|Arpad]].\n\n[[File:Bar-rakib.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ingot|Silver ingot]] of Bar-Rakib, son of Panammuwa II,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jtsa.edu/Documents/pagedocs/JANES/1986%2018/Younger18.pdf |title=Panammuwa and Bar-Rakib: Two Structural Analyses |first=K.

These inscriptions are mostly diplomatic documents between Aramaean city-states. The alphabet of Aramaic at this early period seems to be based on the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and there is a unity in the written language. It seems that, in time, a more refined alphabet, suited to the needs of the language, began to develop from this in the eastern regions of Aram. Due to increasing Aramean migration eastward, the Western periphery of Assyria became bilingual in Akkadian and Aramean at least as early as the mid-9th century BC. As the Neo-Assyrian Empire conquered Aramean lands west of the Euphrates, [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] made Aramaic the Empire's second official language, and it eventually supplanted Akkadian completely.\n\nFrom 700 BC, the language began to spread in all directions, but lost much of its unity. Different dialects emerged in Assyria, Babylonia, the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]. Around 600 BC, Adon, a [[Canaan]]ite king, used Aramaic to write to an Egyptian [[Pharaoh]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Klaus |last=Beyer |title=The Aramaic Language, Its Distribution and Subdivisions |publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht Gottingen |year=1986 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=gCFjAAAAMAAJ |translator-first=John F. |translator-last=Healey |isbn=9783525535738 |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n\"Chaldee\" or \"Chaldean Aramaic\" used to be common terms for the Aramaic of the Chaldean dynasty of [[Babylonia]].

Achaemenid Aramaic is sufficiently uniform that it is often difficult to know where any particular example of the language was written. Only careful examination reveals the occasional loan word from a local language.\n\nA group of thirty Aramaic documents from [[Bactria]] have been discovered, and an analysis was published in November 2006.

Aramaic that bears a relatively close resemblance to that of the 5th century BC can be found right up to the early 2nd century BC. The [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] imposed [[Greek language|Greek]] in the administration of [[Syria]] and [[Mesopotamia]] from the start of their rule. In the 3rd century BC, Greek overtook Aramaic as the common{{clarify|date=August 2016}}<!--Common in what sense? Administrative? But that began in the 5th century. Vernacular / generally used? But Coptic was the vernacular of the non-Greek majority in Egypt, and Aramaic was the vernacular of the non-Greek majority in Syria.--> language in Egypt and Syria. However, a post-Achaemenid Aramaic continued to flourish from [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]], Assyria, Mesopotamia, through the Syrian Desert and into northern [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]].\n\n[[Biblical Aramaic]] is the Aramaic found in four discrete sections of the [[Hebrew Bible]]:\n* [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 4:8\u20136:18 and 7:12\u201326 \u2013 documents from the Achaemenid period (5th century BC) concerning the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem.\n* [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 2:4b\u20137:28 \u2013 five subversive tales and an apocalyptic vision.\n* [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 10:11 \u2013 a single sentence in the middle of a Hebrew text denouncing idolatry.\n* [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 31:47 \u2013 translation of a Hebrew place-name.\nBiblical Aramaic is a somewhat hybrid dialect. It is theorized that some Biblical Aramaic material originated in both Babylonia and Judaea before the fall of the Achaemenid dynasty. According to [[historical criticism]], defiant Jewish propaganda shaped Aramaic [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] during [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] rule. These stories might have existed as oral traditions at their earliest stage. This might be one factor that led to differing collections of Daniel in the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Septuagint]] and the [[Masoretic Text]], which presents a lightly [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]-influenced Aramaic.\n\nUnder the category of post-Achaemenid is Hasmonaean Aramaic, the official language of [[Hasmonean|Hasmonaean]] Judaea (142\u201337 BC). It influenced the Biblical Aramaic of the [[Qumran]] texts, and was the main language of non-biblical theological texts of that community. The major [[Targum]]s, translations of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, were originally composed in Hasmonaean. Hasmonaean also appears in quotations in the [[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]], although smoothed into its later context. It is written quite differently from Achaemenid Aramaic; there is an emphasis on writing as words are pronounced rather than using etymological forms.\n\nBabylonian [[Targum]]ic is the later post-Achaemenid dialect found in the [[Targum Onkelos|Targum Onqelos]] and [[Targum Jonathan]], the \"official\" targums. The original, Hasmonaean targums had reached Babylon sometime in the 2nd or 3rd century AD. They were then reworked according to the contemporary dialect of Babylon to create the language of the standard targums. This combination formed the basis of Babylonian Jewish literature for centuries to follow.\n\nGalilean Targumic is similar to Babylonian Targumic. It is the mixing of literary Hasmonaean with the dialect of [[Galilee]]. The Hasmonaean targums reached Galilee in the 2nd century AD, and were reworked into this Galilean dialect for local use. The Galilean Targum was not considered an authoritative work by other communities, and documentary evidence shows that its text was amended. From the 11th century AD onwards, once the Babylonian Targum had become normative, the Galilean version became heavily influenced by it.\n\nBabylonian Documentary Aramaic is a dialect in use from the 3rd century AD onwards. It is the dialect of Babylonian private documents, and, from the 12th century, all Jewish private documents are in Aramaic. It is based on Hasmonaean with very few changes. This was perhaps because many of the documents in BDA are legal documents, the language in them had to be sensible throughout the Jewish community from the start, and Hasmonaean was the old standard.\n\n[[Nabataean Aramaic]] is the language of the Arameo-Arab kingdom of [[Petra]]. The kingdom (''c.'' 200 BC\u2013106 AD) covered the east bank of the [[Jordan River]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northern Arabia. Perhaps because of the importance of the caravan trade, the Nabataeans began to use Aramaic in preference to [[Ancient North Arabian|Old North Arabic]]. The dialect is based on Achaemenid with a little influence from Arabic: \"l\" is often turned into \"n\", and there are a few Arabic loanwords. Some Nabataean Aramaic inscriptions exist from the early days of the kingdom, but most are from the first four centuries AD The language is written in a [[cursive]] script that is the precursor to the modern [[Arabic alphabet]]. The number of Arabic loanwords increases through the centuries, until, in the 4th century, Nabataean merges seamlessly with [[Arabic]].\n\nPalmyrene Aramaic is the dialect that was in use in the [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]] city state of [[Palmyra]] in the Syrian Desert from 44 BC to 274 AD. It was written in a rounded script, which later gave way to cursive [[Syriac alphabet|Estrangela]]. Like Nabataean, Palmyrene was influenced by Arabic, but to a much lesser degree.\n\nThe use of ''written'' Aramaic in the Achaemenid bureaucracy also precipitated the adoption of Aramaic(-derived) scripts to render a number of [[Middle Iranian]] languages. Moreover, many common words, including even pronouns, particles, numerals, and auxiliaries, continued to written as Aramaic \"words\" even when writing Middle Iranian languages. In time, in Iranian usage, these Aramaic \"words\" became disassociated from the Aramaic language and came to be understood as ''signs'' (i.e. [[logograms]]), much like the symbol '&' is read as \"and\" in English and the original Latin ''et'' is now no longer obvious. Under the early 3rd-century BC [[Arsacid Empire|Parthians Arsacids]], whose government used Greek but whose native language was [[Parthian language|Parthian]], the Parthian language and its Aramaic-derived writing system both gained prestige. This in turn also led to the adoption of the name '[[Pahlavi scripts|pahlavi]]' (< ''parthawi'', \"of the Parthians\") for that writing system. The [[Sassanid empire|Persian Sassanids]], who succeeded the Parthian Arsacids in the mid-3rd century AD, subsequently inherited/adopted the Parthian-mediated Aramaic-derived writing system for their own Middle Iranian ethnolect as well.<ref>Beyer. p. 28 n. 27; {{cite book |title=Ancient Persia |pages=118\u2013120 |last1=Wieseh\u00f6fer |first1=Josef |translator-last=Azodi |translator-first=Azizeh |isbn=9781860646751 |publisher=I.B.

Following the conquest of the Sassanids by the Arabs in the 7th-century, the Aramaic-derived writing system was replaced by Arabic script in all but [[Middle Persian literature|Zoroastrian usage]], which continued to use the name 'pahlavi' for the Aramaic-derived writing system and went on to create the bulk of all Middle Iranian literature in that writing system.\n\n===Late Old Eastern Aramaic===\n{{Main|Eastern Aramaic languages}}\n[[File:Mandaic.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] [[Incantation bowl|magical \"demon trap\"]]]]\nThe dialects mentioned in the last section were all descended from Achaemenid Imperial Aramaic. However, the diverse regional dialects of Late Ancient Aramaic continued alongside these, often as simple, spoken languages. Early evidence for these spoken dialects is known only through their influence on words and names in a more standard dialect. However, these regional dialects became written languages in the 2nd century BC. These dialects reflect a stream of Aramaic that is not dependent on Imperial Aramaic, and shows a clear division between the regions of Mesopotamia, Babylon and the east, and Judah, Syria, and the west.\n\nIn the East, the dialects of Palmyrene and Arsacid Aramaic merged with the regional languages to create languages with a foot in Imperial and a foot in regional Aramaic. The written form of [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]], the language of the [[Mandaeism|Mandaean]] religion, was descended from the Arsacid chancery script.<ref>{{cite journal |last=H\u00e4berl |first=Charles G. |title=Iranian Scripts for Aramaic Languages: The Origin of the Mandaic Script |journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research |issue=341 |date=February 2006 |pages=53\u201362 |jstor=25066933 |doi=10.7282/T37D2SGZ}}</ref>\n\nIn the kingdom of [[Osroene]], centred on [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] and founded in 132 BC, the regional dialect became the official language: Old [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. On the upper reaches of the [[Tigris]], East Mesopotamian Aramaic flourished, with evidence from [[Hatra]], [[Assur]] and the [[Tur Abdin]]. [[Tatian]], the author of the gospel harmony the [[Diatessaron]] came from Assyria, and perhaps wrote his work (172 AD) in East Mesopotamian rather than Syriac or Greek. In Babylonia, the regional dialect was used by the Jewish community, Jewish Old Babylonian (from ''c.'' 70 AD). This everyday language increasingly came under the influence of Biblical Aramaic and Babylonian Targumic.\n\n===Late Old Western Aramaic===\n{{Main|Western Aramaic languages}}\nThe western regional dialects of Aramaic followed a similar course to those of the east. They are quite distinct from the eastern dialects and Imperial Aramaic. Aramaic came to coexist with Canaanite dialects, eventually completely displacing [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] in the first century BC and [[Hebrew language#Aramaic displaces Hebrew as a spoken language|Hebrew]] around the turn of the fourth century AD.\n\nThe form of Late Old Western Aramaic used by the Jewish community is best attested, and is usually referred to as Jewish Old Palestinian. Its oldest form is Old East Jordanian, which probably comes from the region of [[Caesarea Philippi]]. This is the dialect of the oldest manuscript of the [[Book of Enoch]] (''c.'' 170 BC). The next distinct phase of the language is called Old Judaean into the second century AD. Old Judean literature can be found in various inscriptions and personal letters, preserved quotations in the [[Talmud]] and receipts from [[Qumran]]. [[Josephus]]' first, non-extant edition of his ''[[The Jewish War]]'' was written in Old Judean.\n\nThe Old East Jordanian dialect continued to be used into the first century AD by pagan communities living to the east of the Jordan. Their dialect is often then called Pagan Old Palestinian, and it was written in a cursive script somewhat similar to that used for Old Syriac. A Christian Old Palestinian dialect may have arisen from the pagan one, and this dialect may be behind some of the Western Aramaic tendencies found in the otherwise eastern Old Syriac gospels (see [[Peshitta]]).\n\n====Languages during Jesus' lifetime====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n{{Further|Language of Jesus}}\nIt is generally believed by Christian scholars that in the first century, Jews in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] primarily spoke Aramaic with a decreasing number using [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as their first language, though many learned Hebrew as a liturgical language. Additionally, [[Koine Greek]] was the lingua franca of the Middle East in trade, among the Hellenized classes (much like French in the 18th,19th and 20th centuries in Europe), and in the Roman administration. [[Latin]], the language of the Roman army and higher levels of administration, had almost no impact on the linguistic landscape.\n\nIn addition to the formal, literary dialects of Aramaic based on [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean]] and Babylonian, there were a number of colloquial Aramaic dialects. Seven [[Western Aramaic languages|Western Aramaic varieties]] were spoken in the vicinity of Judea in [[Jesus]]' time. They were probably distinctive yet mutually intelligible. Old Judean was the prominent dialect of [[Jerusalem]] and Judaea. The region of [[Ein Gedi]] spoke the Southeast Judaean dialect. [[Samaria]] had its distinctive [[Samaritan Aramaic language|Samaritan Aramaic]], where the consonants \"[[he (letter)|he]]\", \"{{Transl|sem|[[heth]]}}\" and \"\u2018[[ayin]]\" all became pronounced as \"[[aleph]]\". Galilean Aramaic, the dialect of Jesus' home region, is only known from a few place names, the influences on Galilean Targumic, some rabbinic literature and a few private letters. It seems to have a number of distinctive features: [[diphthong]]s are never simplified into monophthongs. East of the Jordan, the various dialects of East Jordanian were spoken. In the region of [[Damascus]] and the [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains]], Damascene Aramaic was spoken (deduced mostly from Modern Western Aramaic). Finally, as far north as [[Aleppo]], the western dialect of Orontes Aramaic was spoken.\n\nThe three languages influenced one another, especially Hebrew and Aramaic. Hebrew words entered Jewish Aramaic (mostly technical religious words but also everyday words like \u05e2\u05e5 ''{{Transl|sem|\u02bf\u0113\u1e63}}'' \"wood\"). Conversely, Aramaic words entered Hebrew (not only Aramaic words like ''m\u0101mm\u00f4n'' \"wealth\" but Aramaic ways of using words like making Hebrew \u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05d9 ''r\u0101\u2019\u00fbi'', \"seen\" mean \"worthy\" in the sense of \"seemly\", which is a calque of Aramaic ''{{Transl|sem|\u1e25z\u00ee}}'' meaning \"seen\" and \"worthy\").\n\nThe Greek of the [[New Testament]] often preserves non-Greek semiticisms, including transliterations of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] words:\n* Some are Aramaic, like ''talitha'' (\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1), which represents the noun \u05d8\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea\u05d0 ''{{Transl|sem|\u1e6daly\u0115\u1e6f\u0101}}'' ({{Bibleref2|Mark 5:41}}).\n* Others can be either Hebrew or Aramaic like \u05e8\u05d1\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 ''Rabbounei'' (\u03a1\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9), which stands for \"my master/great one/teacher\" in both languages ({{Bibleref2|John 20:16}}).\n\nExamples:\n*\"Talitha kumi\" ({{Bibleref2|Mark 5:41}})\n*\"Ephphatha\" ({{Bibleref2|Mark 7:34}})\n*\"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?\" ({{Bibleref2|Mark 15:34}})\n\nThe 2004 film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' used Aramaic for much of its dialogue, specially reconstructed by a scholar, [[William Fulco]], S.J. Where the appropriate words (in first century Aramaic) were no longer known, he used the Aramaic of Daniel and fourth-century Syriac and Hebrew as the basis for his work.<ref>{{cite news |title=What's up with Aramaic? |date=25 February 2004 |url=http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/entertainment/special_packages/passion_of_christ/8038021.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 April 2004 |access-date=10 October 2018 |work=Miami Herald |last=Darling |first=Cary |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040403223353/http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/entertainment/special_packages/passion_of_christ/8038021.htm}}</ref>\n\n==Middle Aramaic==\nThe 3rd century AD is taken as the threshold between Old and Middle Aramaic. During that century, the nature of the various Aramaic languages and dialects began to change. The descendants of Imperial Aramaic ceased to be living languages, and the eastern and western regional languages began to develop vital new literatures. Unlike many of the dialects of Old Aramaic, much is known about the vocabulary and grammar of Middle Aramaic.\n\n===Eastern Middle Aramaic===\nOnly two of the Old Eastern Aramaic languages continued into this period. In the north of the region, Old Syriac transitioned into Middle Syriac. In the south, Jewish Old Babylonian became Jewish Middle Babylonian. The post-Achaemenid, Arsacid dialect became the background of the new [[Mandaic language]].\n\n====Syriac====\n{{Main|Syriac language}}\n[[File:Estrangela.jpg|thumb|9th century [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Syriac alphabet|Estrangela]] manuscript of [[John Chrysostom]]'s ''Homily on the [[Gospel of John]]'']]\n{{listen|filename=aboun.ogg|title=Abun dbashmayo|description=The [[Lord's Prayer]], ''Abun dbashmayo'', sung in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]}}\n\nSyriac (also \"Middle Syriac\") is the classical, literary, liturgical and often spoken language of [[Syriac Christianity]] to this day, particularly the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Ancient Church of the East]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and [[Saint Thomas Christians]]. It originated in fifth century BC [[Achaemenid Assyria]], but its golden age was the fourth to sixth centuries. This period began with the translation of the Bible into the language: the [[Peshitta]] and the masterful prose and poetry of [[Ephrem the Syrian]]. Middle Syriac became the language of those opposed to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] leadership of the [[Church of the East]]. Missionary activity by Assyrian and [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christians]] led to the spread of Syriac from Mesopotamia and [[Iran|Persia]], into [[Central Asia]], [[Indian subcontinent|India]] and [[China]].\n\n==== Jewish Middle Babylonian Aramaic ====\n<!-- This section is linked, this language was taken from the Aramaic language of the Byzantines from [[Halakha]] -->\n{{Main|Jewish Babylonian Aramaic}}\nJewish Middle Babylonian is the language employed by Jewish writers in Babylonia between the fourth and the eleventh century. It is most commonly identified with the language of the Babylonian [[Talmud]] (which was completed in the seventh century) and of post-Talmudic [[Geonim|Geonic]] literature, which are the most important cultural products of Babylonian Judaism. The most important epigraphic sources for the dialect are the hundreds of [[incantation bowl]]s written in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic.\n\n====Mandaic====\n{{Main|Mandaic language}}\nThe [[Mandaic language]], spoken by the [[Mandaeans]] of [[Iraq]], is a sister dialect to Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, though it is both linguistically and culturally distinct. Classical Mandaic is the language in which the Mandaeans' [[gnosticism|gnostic]] religious literature was composed. It is characterized by a highly phonetic orthography.\n\n===Western Middle Aramaic===\nThe dialects of Old Western Aramaic continued with Jewish Middle Palestinian (in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew \"square script\"]]), [[Samaritan Aramaic]] (in the [[Phoenician alphabet|old Hebrew script]]) and Christian Palestinian (in cursive [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac script]]). Of these three, only Jewish Middle Palestinian continued as a written language.{{Clarify|date=March 2010}}<!--So how do we know the other two if they weren't written? Also, at least Samaritan Aramaic certainly was written and lots of texts survive.-->\n\n====Jewish Middle Palestinian Aramaic====\n[[File:Kennicott Bible fol 42v.jpg|thumb|right|Hebrew (left) and Aramaic (right) in parallel in a 1299 Hebrew Bible held by the [[Bodleian Library]]]]\n\n{{Main|Jewish Palestinian Aramaic}}\nIn 135, after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], many [[Jew]]ish leaders, expelled from [[Jerusalem]], moved to [[Galilee]]. The Galilean dialect thus rose from obscurity to become the standard among Jews in the west. This dialect was spoken not only in Galilee, but also in the surrounding parts. It is the linguistic setting for the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (completed in the 5th century), Palestinian [[targum]]im (Jewish Aramaic versions of scripture), and [[midrash]]im (biblical commentaries and teaching). The standard [[niqqud|vowel pointing]] for the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Tiberian system (7th century), was developed by speakers of the Galilean dialect of Jewish Middle Palestinian. Classical Hebrew vocalisation, therefore, in representing the Hebrew of this period, probably reflects the contemporary pronunciation of this Aramaic dialect.\n\n[[Middle Judaean Aramaic|Middle Judaean]], the descendant of [[Old Judaean Aramaic|Old Judaean]], was no longer the dominant dialect, and was used only in southern Judaea (the variant Engedi dialect continued throughout this period). Likewise, [[Middle East Jordanian Aramaic|Middle East Jordanian]] continued as a minor dialect from [[Old East Jordanian Aramaic|Old East Jordanian]]. The inscriptions in the synagogue at [[Dura-Europos]] are either in Middle East Jordanian or Middle Judaean.\n\n====Samaritan Aramaic====\n{{Main|Samaritan Aramaic language}}\nThe [[Samaritan Aramaic language|Samaritan Aramaic]] is earliest attested by the documentary tradition of the [[Samaritans]] that can be dated back to the fourth century. Its modern pronunciation is based on the form used in the tenth century.\n\n====Christian Palestinian Aramaic====\nSometimes referred to as \"Melkite Aramaic\", it is the language of Western-Aramaic-speaking Christians. It is evidenced from the 5th\u20136th century, but probably existed two centuries earlier. The language itself comes from Old Christian Palestinian Aramaic, but its writing conventions were based on early [[Middle Syriac]], and it was heavily influenced by [[Greek language|Greek]]. For example, the name Jesus, although \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2 ''Ye\u0161ua\u2019'' in Jewish Aramaic, and ''I\u0161o'' in Syriac, is written ''Yes\u00fbs'' (a transliteration of the Greek form) in Christian Palestinian.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Modern Aramaic==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\n{{Main|Neo-Aramaic languages}}\nAs the [[Western Aramaic]] languages of the Levant and Lebanon have become nearly extinct in non-liturgical usage, the most prolific speakers of Aramaic dialects today are predominantly ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Eastern Neo-Aramaic speakers, the most numerous being the [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]] speakers of Mesopotamia. This includes speakers of [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] (235,000 speakers), [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] (216,000 speakers), and [[Turoyo language|Turoyo (Surayt)]] (112,000 to 450,000 speakers).  Having largely lived in remote areas as insulated communities for over a millennium, the remaining modern Aramaic dialects, such as the Assyrians, and the [[Arameans]], escaped the linguistic pressures experienced by others during the large-scale [[language shift]]s that saw the proliferation of other tongues among those who previously did not speak them, most recently the [[Arabization]] of the Middle East and North Africa by [[Arabs]] beginning with the [[early Muslim conquests]] of the seventh century.<ref>Turoyo at Ethnologue (17th ed., 2013)</ref><ref>Khan 2008, pp. 6</ref>\n\nAnother Eastern Aramaic language, Neo-Mandaean, is spoken by the Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran. They number some 50,000\u201375,000 people, but it is believed the Mandaic language may now be spoken fluently by as few as 5,000 people, with other Mandaeans having varying degrees of knowledge.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/mid |work=Ethnologue |title=Mandaic: A language of Iran |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Modern Eastern Aramaic===\n{{main|Northeastern Neo-Aramaic|Neo-Mandaic}}\nModern Eastern Aramaic exists in a wide variety of dialects and languages. There is significant difference between the Aramaic spoken by Jews, Christians, and Mandaeans.\n\nThe Christian varieties are often called Modern Syriac (or Neo-Syriac, particularly when referring to their literature), being deeply influenced by the literary and liturgical language of Middle Syriac. However, they also have roots in numerous, previously unwritten, local Aramaic varieties, and are not purely the direct descendants of the language of [[Ephrem the Syrian]]. The varieties are not all mutually intelligible. The principal Christian varieties are [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]], both used by the ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of Iraq, southeast Turkey, Iran, and northeast Syria.\n\nThe [[Judeo-Aramaic languages]] are now mostly spoken in [[Israel]], and most are facing extinction. The Jewish varieties that have come from communities that once lived between [[Lake Urmia]] and [[Mosul]] are not all mutually intelligible. In some places, for example [[Urmia]], Assyrian Christians and Jews speak mutually unintelligible varieties of Modern Eastern Aramaic in the same place. In others, the [[Nineveh plains]] around Mosul for example, the varieties of these two ethnic communities are similar enough to allow conversation.\n\nModern [[Central Neo-Aramaic]], being in between Western Neo-Aramaic and Eastern Neo-Aramaic) is generally represented by Turoyo, the language of the Assyrians of [[Tur Abdin]]. A related language, [[Mlahs\u00f4 language|Mlahs\u00f4]], has recently become extinct.\n\nMandaeans living in the [[Khuzestan Province]] of Iran and scattered throughout Iraq, speak Modern Mandaic. It is quite distinct from any other Aramaic variety.\n\n===Modern Central Aramaic===\n{{main|Central Neo-Aramaic}}\nCentral Neo-Aramaic consists of [[Turoyo]] and the recently extinct [[Mlahs\u00f4]].\n\n===Modern Western Aramaic===\n{{Main|Western Neo-Aramaic}}\nVery little remains of Western Aramaic. It is still spoken in the villages of [[Maaloula]], [[al-Sarkha (Bakhah)]], and [[Jubb'adin]] on [[Syria]]'s side of the [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains]], as well as by some people who migrated from these villages, to [[Damascus]] and other larger towns of Syria. All these speakers of Modern Western Aramaic are fluent in Arabic as well. [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]] and [[Samaritan Aramaic]] are preserved in liturgical and literary usage.\n\n==Phonology==\nEach dialect of Aramaic has its own distinctive pronunciation, and it would not be feasible here to go into all these properties. Aramaic has a phonological palette of 25 to 40 distinct phonemes. Some modern Aramaic pronunciations lack the series of \"emphatic\" consonants, and some have borrowed from the inventories of surrounding languages, particularly [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!\n! Front\n! Back\n|-\n! Close\n| {{IPA link|i}}\n| {{IPA link|u}}\n|-\n! Close-mid\n| {{IPA link|e}}\n| {{IPA link|o}}\n|-\n! Open-mid\n| {{IPA link|\u025b}}\n| ({{IPA link|\u0254}})\n|-\n! Open\n| {{IPA link|a}}\n| ({{IPA link|\u0251}})\n|}\n\nAs with most Semitic languages, Aramaic can be thought of as having three basic sets of vowels:\n* Open ''a''-vowels\n* Close front ''i''-vowels\n* Close back ''u''-vowels\nThese vowel groups are relatively stable, but the exact articulation of any individual is most dependent on its consonantal setting.\n\nThe open vowel is an open near-front unrounded vowel (\"short\" ''a'', somewhat like the first vowel in the English \"batter\", {{IPAblink|a}}). It usually has a back counterpart (\"long\" ''a'', like the ''a'' in \"father\", {{IPAblink|\u0251}}, or even tending to the vowel in \"caught\", {{IPAblink|\u0254}}), and a front counterpart (\"short\" ''e'', like the vowel in \"head\", {{IPAblink|\u025b}}). There is much correspondence between these vowels between dialects. There is some evidence that Middle Babylonian dialects did not distinguish between the short ''a'' and short ''e''. In West Syriac dialects, and possibly Middle Galilean, the long ''a'' became the ''o'' sound. The open ''e'' and back ''a'' are often indicated in writing by the use of the letters \u05d0 \"alaph\" (a [[glottal stop]]) or \u05d4 \"he\" (like the English ''h'').\n\nThe close front vowel is the \"long\" ''i'' (like the vowel in \"need\", {{IPA|[i]}}). It has a slightly more open counterpart, the \"long\" ''e'', as in the final vowel of \"caf\u00e9\" ({{IPA|[e]}}). Both of these have shorter counterparts, which tend to be pronounced slightly more open. Thus, the short close ''e'' corresponds with the open ''e'' in some dialects. The close front vowels usually use the consonant \u05d9 ''y'' as a [[mater lectionis]].\n\nThe close back vowel is the \"long\" ''u'' (like the vowel in \"school\", {{IPA|[u]}}). It has a more open counterpart, the \"long\" ''o'', like the vowel in \"low\" ({{IPA|[o]}}). There are shorter, and thus more open, counterparts to each of these, with the short close ''o'' sometimes corresponding with the long open ''a''. The close back vowels often use the consonant \u05d5 ''w'' to indicate their quality.\n\nTwo basic [[diphthong]]s exist: an open vowel followed by \u05d9 ''y'' (''ay''), and an open vowel followed by \u05d5 ''w'' (''aw''). These were originally full diphthongs, but many dialects have converted them to ''e'' and ''o'' respectively.\n\nThe so-called \"emphatic\" consonants (see the next section) cause all vowels to become mid-centralised.\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Interdental consonant|Interdental]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Pharyngeal consonant|Pharyngeal]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! <small>plain</small>\n! <small>[[Emphatic consonant|emp.]]</small>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| {{IPA link|m}} || || {{IPA link|n}} || || || || || ||\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n! <small>[[Voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n| {{IPA link|p}} || || {{IPA link|t}} || {{IPA link|t\u02e4}} || || {{IPA link|k}} || {{IPA link|q}} || || {{IPA link|\u0294}}\n|-\n! <small>[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n| {{IPA link|b}} || || {{IPA link|d}} || || || {{IPA link|\u0261}} || || ||\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n! <small>[[Voicelessness|voiceless]]</small>\n| {{IPA link|f}} || {{IPA link|\u03b8}} || {{IPA link|s}} || {{IPA link|s\u02e4}} || {{IPA link|\u0283}} || {{IPA link|x}} || || {{IPA link|\u0127}} || {{IPA link|h}}\n|-\n! <small>[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]</small>\n| {{IPA link|v}} || {{IPA link|\u00f0}} || {{IPA link|z}} || || || {{IPA link|\u0263}} || || {{IPA link|\u0295}} ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| || || {{IPA link|l}} || || {{IPA link|j}} || {{IPA link|w}} || || ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n| || || {{IPA link|r}} || || || || || ||\n|}\n\nThe various alphabets used for writing Aramaic languages have twenty-two letters (all of which are consonants). Some of these letters, though, can stand for two or three different sounds (usually a [[stop consonant|stop]] and a [[fricative consonant|fricative]] at the same point of articulation). Aramaic classically uses a series of lightly contrasted plosives and fricatives:\n* Labial set: '''\u05e4\u05bc'''\\'''\u05e4''' ''p''/''f'' and '''\u05d1\u05bc'''\\'''\u05d1''' ''b''/''v'',\n* Dental set: '''\u05ea\u05bc'''\\'''\u05ea''' ''t''/''\u03b8'' and '''\u05d3\u05bc'''\\'''\u05d3''' ''d''/''\u00f0'',\n* Velar set: '''\u05db\u05bc'''\\'''\u05db''' ''k''/''x'' and '''\u05d2\u05bc'''\\'''\u05d2''' ''g''/''\u0263''.\nEach member of a certain pair is written with the same letter of the alphabet in most writing systems (that is, ''p'' and ''f'' are written with the same letter), and are near [[allophone]]s.\n\nA distinguishing feature of Aramaic phonology (and that of Semitic languages in general) is the presence of \"emphatic\" consonants. These are consonants that are pronounced with the root of the tongue retracted, with varying degrees of [[pharyngealization]] and [[Velar consonant|velarization]]. Using their alphabetic names, these emphatics are:\n* \u05d7 \u1e24\u00ea\u1e6f, a [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]], {{IPA|/\u0127/}},\n* \u05d8 \u1e6c\u00ea\u1e6f, a pharyngealized ''t'', {{IPA|/t\u02e4/}},\n* \u05e2 \u02bdAyin (or \u02bdE in some dialects), a pharyngealized [[glottal stop]] (sometimes considered to be a [[Voiced pharyngeal fricative|voiced pharyngeal approximant]]), {{IPA|[\u0295]}} or {{IPA|[\u0294\u02e4]}},\n* \u05e6 \u1e62\u0101\u1e0f\u00ea, a pharyngealized ''s'', {{IPA|/s\u02e4/}},\n* \u05e7 Q\u00f4p, a [[voiceless uvular stop]], {{IPA|/q/}}.\n{{listen|filename=Aramaic_emphatics.ogg|title=The emphatic consonants of Aramaic|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nAncient Aramaic may have had a larger series of emphatics, and some Neo-Aramaic languages definitely do. Not all dialects of Aramaic give these consonants their historic values.\n\nOverlapping with the set of emphatics are the \"guttural\" consonants. They include \u05d7 \u1e24\u00ea\u1e6f and \u05e2 \u02bdAyn from the emphatic set, and add \u05d0 \u02bc\u0100lap\u0304 (a [[glottal stop]]) and \u05d4 H\u00ea (as the English \"h\").\n\nAramaic classically has a set of four [[sibilant]]s (ancient Aramaic may have had six):\n* \u05e1, \u05e9\u05c2 {{IPA|/s/}} (as in English \"sea\"),\n* \u05d6 {{IPA|/z/}} (as in English \"zero\"),\n* \u05e9\u05c1 {{IPA|/\u0283/}} (as in English \"ship\"),\n* \u05e6 {{IPA|/s\u02e4/}} (the emphatic \u1e62\u0101\u1e0f\u00ea listed above).\n\nIn addition to these sets, Aramaic has the [[nasal consonant]]s \u05de ''m'' and \u05e0 ''n'', and the [[approximant consonant|approximants]] \u05e8 ''r'' (usually an [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar trills|alveolar trill]]), \u05dc ''l'', \u05d9 ''y'' and \u05d5 ''w''.\n\n===Historical sound changes===\nSix broad features of sound change can be seen as dialect differentials:\n* '''Vowel change''' occurs almost too frequently to document fully, but is a major distinctive feature of different dialects.\n* '''Plosive/fricative pair reduction'''.  Originally, Aramaic, like [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian Hebrew]], had fricatives as conditioned [[allophone]]s for each plosive. In the wake of vowel changes, the distinction eventually became phonemic; still later, it was often lost in certain dialects. For example, [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] has mostly lost {{IPA|/p/}}, using {{IPA|/f/}} instead, like Arabic; other dialects (for instance, standard [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]]) have lost {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} and {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} and replaced them with {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}, as with Modern Hebrew. In most dialects of Modern Syriac, {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} are realized as {{IPA|[w]}} after a vowel.\n* '''Loss of emphatics'''. Some dialects have replaced emphatic consonants with non-emphatic counterparts, while those spoken in the [[Caucasus]] often have [[Ejective consonant|glottalized]] rather than [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] emphatics.\n* '''Guttural assimilation''' is the main distinctive feature of Samaritan pronunciation, also found in [[Samaritan Hebrew]]: all the gutturals are reduced to a simple glottal stop. Some Modern Aramaic dialects do not pronounce ''h'' in all words (the third person masculine pronoun ''hu'' becomes ''ow'').\n* Proto-Semitic */\u03b8/ */\u00f0/ are reflected in Aramaic as */t/, */d/, whereas they became sibilants in Hebrew (the number three is \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05e9 ''\u0161\u0101l\u00f4\u0161'' in Hebrew but \u05ea\u05dc\u05ea ''tl\u0101\u1e6f'' in Aramaic). Dental/sibilant shifts are still happening in the modern dialects.\n* '''New phonetic inventory'''. Modern dialects have borrowed sounds from the dominant surrounding languages. The most frequent borrowings are {{IPA|[\u0292]}} (as the first consonant in \"azure\"), {{IPA|[d\u0361\u0292]}} (as in \"jam\") and {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0283]}} (as in \"church\"). The [[Syriac alphabet]] has been adapted for writing these new sounds.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{listen|filename=kthovo.ogg|title=Aramaic words based on the triliteral<br /> root ''k-t-b'' |description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nAs with other Semitic languages, Aramaic [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the way words are formed) is based on the consonantal [[Semitic root|root]]. The root generally consists of two or three consonants and has a basic meaning, for example, \u05db\u05ea\u05f4\u05d1 ''k-t-b'' has the meaning of 'writing'. This is then modified by the addition of vowels and other consonants to create different nuances of the basic meaning:\n* \u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05d4 ''k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07\u00e2'', handwriting, inscription, script, book.\n* \u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05d9 ''k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07\u00ea'', books, the Scriptures.\n* \u05db\u05ea\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 ''k\u0101\u1e6f\u00fb\u1e07\u00e2'', secretary, scribe.\n* \u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea ''ki\u1e6f\u1e07e\u1e6f'', I wrote.\n* \u05d0\u05db\u05ea\u05d1 '''e\u1e35t\u00fb\u1e07'', I shall write.\n\n===Nouns and adjectives===\nAramaic nouns and adjectives are inflected to show ''gender'', ''number'' and ''state''.\n\nAramaic has two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. The feminine absolute singular is often marked by the ending \u05d4- ''-\u00e2''.\n\nNouns can be either singular or plural, but an additional \"dual\" number exists for nouns that usually come in pairs. The dual number gradually disappeared from Aramaic over time and has little influence in Middle and Modern Aramaic.\n\nAramaic nouns and adjectives can exist in one of three states. To a certain extent, these states correspond to the role of articles and cases in the [[Indo-European languages]]:\n# The ''absolute'' state is the basic form of a noun. In early forms of Aramaic, the absolute state expresses indefiniteness, comparable to the English indefinite article a(n) (for example, \u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05d4 ''k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07\u00e2'', \"'''a''' handwriting\"), and can be used in most syntactic roles. However, by the Middle Aramaic period, its use for nouns (but not adjectives) had been widely replaced by the emphatic state.\n# The ''[[Status constructus|construct]]'' state is a form of the noun used to make possessive constructions (for example, '''\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea''' \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d0 '''''k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07at''' malk\u1e6f\u00e2'', \"the handwriting of the queen\"). In the masculine singular the form of the construct is often the same as the absolute, but it may undergo vowel reduction in longer words. The feminine construct and masculine construct plural are marked by suffixes. Unlike a [[genitive case]], which marks the possessor, the construct state is marked on the possessed. This is mainly due to Aramaic word order: '''possessed[const.] possessor[abs./emph.]''' are treated as a speech unit, with the first unit (possessed) employing the construct state to link it to the following word. In Middle Aramaic, the use of the construct state for all but stock phrases (like \u05d1\u05e8 \u05e0\u05e9\u05d0 ''bar n\u0101\u0161\u00e2'', \"son of man\") begins to disappear.\n# The ''emphatic'' or ''determined'' state is an extended form of the noun that functions similarly to the [[Article (grammar)|definite article]]. It is marked with a suffix (for example, \u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea'''\u05d0'''  ''k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07t\u00e2'', \"'''the''' handwriting\"). Although its original grammatical function seems to have been to mark definiteness, it is used already in Imperial Aramaic to mark all important nouns, even if they should be considered technically indefinite. This practice developed to the extent that the absolute state became extraordinarily rare in later varieties of Aramaic.\n\nWhereas other [[Northwest Semitic languages]], like Hebrew, have the absolute and construct states, the emphatic/determined state is a unique feature to Aramaic. [[Inflection|Case endings]], as in [[Ugaritic grammar#Case|Ugaritic]], probably existed in a very early stage of the language, and glimpses of them can be seen in a few compound proper names. However, as most of those cases were expressed by short final vowels, they were never written, and the few characteristic long vowels of the masculine plural accusative and genitive are not clearly evidenced in inscriptions. Often, the [[Object (grammar)|direct object]] is marked by a prefixed -\u05dc ''l-'' (the [[preposition and postposition|preposition]] \"to\") if it is definite.\n\nAdjectives agree with their nouns in number and gender but agree in state only if used attributively. Predicative adjectives are in the absolute state regardless of the state of their noun (a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] may or may not be written). Thus, an attributive adjective to an emphatic noun, as in the phrase \"the good king\", is written also in the emphatic state \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d0 \u05d8\u05d1\u05d0 ''malk\u00e2 \u1e6d\u0101\u1e07\u00e2''\u2014king[emph.] good[emph.]. In comparison, the predicative adjective, as in the phrase \"the king is good\", is written in the absolute state \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d0 \u05d8\u05d1 ''malk\u00e2 \u1e6d\u0101\u1e07''\u2014king[emph.] good[abs.].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \"good\"\n! masc. sg.\n! fem. sg.\n! masc. pl.\n! fem. pl.\n|-\n! abs.\n| rowspan=\"2\" | \u05d8\u05d1 \u1e6d\u0101\u1e07\n| \u05d8\u05d1\u05d4 \u1e6d\u0101\u1e07\u00e2\n| \u05d8\u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u1e6d\u0101\u1e07\u00een\n| \u05d8\u05d1\u05df \u1e6d\u0101\u1e07\u0101n\n|-\n! const.\n| \u05d8\u05d1\u05ea \u1e6d\u0101\u1e07a\u1e6f\n| \u05d8\u05d1\u05d9 \u1e6d\u0101\u1e07\u00ea\n| \u05d8\u05d1\u05ea \u1e6d\u0101\u1e07\u0101\u1e6f\n|-\n! det./emph.\n| \u05d8\u05d1\u05d0 \u1e6d\u0101\u1e07\u00e2\n| \u05d8\u05d1\u05ea\u05d0 \u1e6d\u0101\u1e07t\u00e2\n| \u05d8\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0 \u1e6d\u0101\u1e07ayy\u00e2\n| \u05d8\u05d1\u05ea\u05d0 \u1e6d\u0101\u1e07\u0101\u1e6f\u00e2\n|}\n\nThe final \u05d0- ''-\u00e2'' in a number of these suffixes is written with the letter [[aleph]]. However, some Jewish Aramaic texts employ the letter [[he (letter)|he]] for the feminine absolute singular. Likewise, some Jewish Aramaic texts employ the Hebrew masculine absolute singular suffix \u05d9\u05dd- ''-\u00eem'' instead of \u05d9\u05df- ''-\u00een''. The masculine determined plural suffix, \u05d9\u05d0- ''-ayy\u00e2'', has an alternative version, ''-\u00ea''. The alternative is sometimes called the \"gentilic plural\" for its prominent use in ethnonyms (\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05d0 ''y\u0259h\u00fb\u1e0f\u0101y\u00ea'', 'the Jews', for example). This alternative plural is written with the letter [[aleph]], and came to be the only plural for nouns and adjectives of this type in Syriac and some other varieties of Aramaic. The masculine construct plural, ''-\u00ea'', is written with [[yodh]]. In Syriac and some other variants this ending is [[diphthong]]ized to ''-ai''.\n\nPossessive phrases in Aramaic can either be made with the construct state or by linking two nouns with the relative particle -[\u05d3[\u05d9 ''d[\u00ee]-''. As the use of the construct state almost disappears from the Middle Aramaic period on, the latter method became the main way of making possessive phrases.\n\n{{listen|filename=kthovath malktho.ogg|title=Different variations of the possessive construction in Aramaic|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nFor example, the various forms of possessive phrases (for \"the handwriting of the queen\") are:\n# '''\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea \u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d0''' '''k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07a\u1e6f malk\u1e6f\u00e2''' \u2013 the oldest construction, also known as \u05e1\u05de\u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05ea s\u0259m\u00ee\u1e35\u00fb\u1e6f : the possessed object (\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05d4 k\u1e6f\u0101b\u00e2, \"handwriting\") is in the construct state (\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07a\u1e6f); the possessor (\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d4 malk\u00e2, \"queen\") is in the emphatic state (\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d0 malk\u1e6f\u00e2)\n# '''\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea\u05d0 \u05d3\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d0''' '''k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07t\u00e2 d(\u00ee)-malk\u1e6f\u00e2''' \u2013 both words are in the emphatic state and the relative particle -[\u05d3[\u05d9 ''d[\u00ee]-'' is used to mark the relationship\n# '''\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d3\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d0''' '''k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07t\u0101h d(\u00ee)-malk\u1e6f\u00e2''' \u2013 both words are in the emphatic state, and the relative particle is used, but the possessed is given an anticipatory, pronominal ending (\u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05ea\u05d4 k\u1e6f\u0101\u1e07t\u0101-h, \"handwriting-her\"; literally, \"her writing, that (of) the queen\").\nIn Modern Aramaic, the last form is by far the most common. In Biblical Aramaic, the last form is virtually absent.\n\n===Verbs===\nThe Aramaic verb has gradually evolved in time and place, varying between varieties of the language. Verb forms are marked for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second or third), [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural), [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine or feminine), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (perfect or imperfect), [[grammatical mood|mood]] (indicative, imperative, jussive or infinitive) and [[voice (grammar)|voice]] (active, reflexive or passive). Aramaic also employs a system of [[grammatical conjugation|conjugations]], or verbal stems, to mark intensive and extensive developments in the lexical meaning of verbs.\n\n====Aspectual tense====\nAramaic has two proper [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: [[perfective aspect|perfect]] and [[imperfective aspect|imperfect]]. These were originally [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]], but developed into something more like a [[preterite]] and [[future tense|future]]. The perfect is [[Markedness|unmarked]], while the imperfect uses various [[prefix|preformatives]] that vary according to person, number and gender. In both tenses the third-person singular masculine is the unmarked form from which others are derived by addition of [[Suffix|afformatives]] (and preformatives in the imperfect). In the chart below (on the root \u05db\u05ea\u05f4\u05d1 K-T-B, meaning \"to write\"), the first form given is the usual form in Imperial Aramaic, while the second is [[Syriac language|Classical Syriac]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Person & gender\n! colspan=\"2\" | Perfect\n! colspan=\"2\" | Imperfect\n|-\n!

The basic form of the verb is called the ''ground stem'', or ''G-stem''. Following the tradition of mediaeval Arabic grammarians, it is more often called the P\u0259\u2018al \u05e4\u05e2\u05dc (also written Pe\u2018al), using the form of the [[Semitic root]] \u05e4\u05e2\u05f4\u05dc P-\u2018-L, meaning \"to do\". This stem carries the basic lexical meaning of the verb.\n\nBy doubling of the second radical, or root letter, the D-stem or \u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Pa\u2018\u2018el is formed. This is often an intensive development of the basic lexical meaning. For example, ''q\u0259\u1e6dal'' means \"he killed\", whereas ''qa\u1e6d\u1e6del'' means \"he slew\". The precise relationship in meaning between the two stems differs for every verb.\n\nA [[preformative]], which can be -\u05d4 ''ha-'', -\u05d0 ''a-'' or -\u05e9 ''\u0161a-'', creates the C-stem or variously the Hap\u0304\u2018el, Ap\u0304\u2018el or \u0160ap\u0304\u2018el (also spelt \u05d4\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Haph\u2018el, \u05d0\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Aph\u2018el and \u05e9\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Shaph\u2018el). This is often an extensive or causative development of the basic lexical meaning. For example, \u05d8\u05e2\u05d4 ''\u1e6d\u0259\u2018\u00e2'' means \"he went astray\", whereas \u05d0\u05d8\u05e2\u05d9 ''a\u1e6d\u2018\u00ee'' means \"he deceived\". The \u0160ap\u0304\u2018el \u05e9\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc is the least common variant of the C-stem. Because this variant is standard in Akkadian, it is possible that its use in Aramaic represents loanwords from that language. The difference between the variants \u05d4\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Hap\u0304\u2018el and \u05d0\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Ap\u0304\u2018el appears to be the gradual dropping of the initial \u05d4 ''h'' sound in later Old Aramaic. This is noted by the respelling of the older [[he (letter)|he]] preformative with \u05d0 [[aleph]].\n\nThese three conjugations are supplemented with three further derived stems, produced by the preformative -\u05d4\u05ea ''hi\u1e6f-'' or -\u05d0\u05ea ''e\u1e6f-''. The loss of the initial \u05d4 ''h'' sound occurs similarly to that in the form above. These three derived stems are the Gt-stem, \u05d4\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Hi\u1e6fp\u0259\u2018el or \u05d0\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc E\u1e6fp\u0259\u2018el (also written Hithpe\u2018el or Ethpe\u2018el), the Dt-stem, \u05d4\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05bc\u05dc Hi\u1e6fpa\u2018\u2018al or \u05d0\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05bc\u05dc E\u1e6fpa\u2018\u2018al (also written Hithpa\u2018\u2018al or Ethpa\u2018\u2018al), and the Ct-stem, \u05d4\u05ea\u05d4\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Hi\u1e6fhap\u0304\u2018al, \u05d0\u05ea\u05bc\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Ettap\u0304\u2018al, \u05d4\u05e9\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc Hi\u0161tap\u0304\u2018al or \u05d0\u05e9\u05ea\u05e4\u05e2\u05dc E\u0161tap\u0304\u2018al (also written Hithhaph\u2018al, Ettaph\u2018al, Hishtaph\u2018al or Eshtaph\u2018al). Their meaning is usually [[reflexive verb|reflexive]], but later became [[passive voice|passive]]. However, as with other stems, actual meaning differs from verb to verb.\n\nNot all verbs use all of these conjugations, and, in some, the G-stem is not used. In the chart below (on the root \u05db\u05ea\u05f4\u05d1 K-T-B, meaning \"to write\"), the first form given is the usual form in Imperial Aramaic, while the second is [[Syriac language|Classical Syriac]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Perhaps under influence from other languages, Middle Aramaic developed a system of composite tenses (combinations of forms of the verb with pronouns or an [[auxiliary verb]]), allowing for narrative that is more vivid. The syntax of Aramaic (the way sentences are put together) usually follows the order verb\u2013subject\u2013object (VSO).  Imperial (Persian) Aramaic, however, tended to follow a S-O-V pattern (similar to Akkadian), which was the result of Persian syntactic influence.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Languages|Syriac Christianity|Assyrians}}\n* [[Arabic alphabet]]\n* [[Aramaic of Hatra]]\n* [[Ephrem the Syrian]]\n* [[Hebrew alphabet]]\n* [[Gospel of Matthew]]\n* [[Peshitta]]\n* [[List of loanwords in Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|List of loanwords in modern Aramaic]]\n* [[Syriac Latin alphabet]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book |last=Beyer |first=Klaus |year=1986 |title=The Aramaic language: its distribution and subdivisions |publisher=Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht |isbn=3-525-53573-2}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Casey |first=Maurice |year=1998 |title=Aramaic sources of Mark's Gospel |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-63314-1}}\n* {{Cite encyclopedia |title=Aramaic |encyclopedia=The Eerdmans Bible Dictionary |publisher=William B Eerdmans |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA |year=1975 |isbn=0-8028-2402-1}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Frank |first=Yitzchak |year=2003 |title=Grammar for Gemara & Targum Onkelos |edition=(expanded edition) |publisher=Feldheim Publishers / Ariel Institute |isbn=1-58330-606-4}}\n* {{Cite book |editor=Heinrichs, Wolfhart |editor-link=Wolfhart Heinrichs |year=1990 |title=Studies in Neo-Aramaic |location=Atlanta, Georgia |publisher=Scholars Press |isbn=1-55540-430-8}}\n* {{Cite book |author-link=Theodor N\u00f6ldeke |last=N\u00f6ldeke |first=Theodor |year=2001 |title=Compendious Syriac Grammar |location=Winona Lake |publisher=Eisenbrauns |isbn=1-57506-050-7}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Near Eastern Archaeology: A Reader |first1=Suzanne |last1=Richard |publisher=EISENBRAUNS |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-57506-083-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=khR0apPid8gC&pg=PA69&dq=aramaic+spread+North+Africa}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Rosenthal |first=Franz |authorlink=Franz Rosenthal |year=1995 |title=A Grammar of Biblical Aramaic |edition=6th, revised |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden |isbn=3-447-03590-0}}\n* {{cite book |title=A Jewish Neo-Aramaic Dictionary |last=Sabar |first=Yona |author-link=Yona Sabar |year=2002 |publisher=Harrassowitz |isbn=978-3-447-04557-5}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Sokoloff |first=Michael |year=2002 |title=A Dictionary of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic |isbn=965-226-260-9 |publisher=Bar-Ilan UP; Johns Hopkins UP |location=Ramat Gan}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Sokoloff |first=Michael |year=2002 |title=A Dictionary of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic |edition=2nd |publisher=Bar-Ilan UP; Johns Hopkins UP |isbn=965-226-101-7}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Stevenson |first=William B. |year=1962 |title=Grammar of Palestinian Jewish Aramaic |edition=2nd |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=0-19-815419-4}}\n* {{cite book |last=Waltisberg |first=Michael |year=2016 |title=Syntax des \u1e6curoyo |series=Semitica Viva |issue=55 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz |isbn=978-3-447-10731-0}}.\n\n==External links==\n{{InterWiki|code=arc|language=Syriac}}\n{{Incubator|code=aii|language=Assyrian Neo-Aramaic}}\n{{Incubator|code=tru|language=Turoyo}}\n{{Incubator|code=tmr|language=Jewish Babylonian Aramaic}}\n{{Commons category|Aramaic language}}\n*  [https://web.archive.org/web/20061013182203/http://www.v-a.com/bible/ancient_aramaic_audio_files.html Ancient Aramaic Audio Files]: Contains audio recordings of scripture.\n*  [http://aramaicdesigns.rogueleaf.com/ Aramaic Designs]: Website offering various designs based on historical Aramaic scripts.\n*  [http://lishana.org/academy/ Lishana Online Academy]: The first online academy on Spanish network to learn Aramaic in several dialects.

In the year 49, Titus accompanied Paul to the council held at Jerusalem, on the subject of the [[Moses|Mosaic]] rites. Although Paul had consented to the circumcision of [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], in order to render his ministry acceptable among the Jews, he would not allow the same in regard to Titus, so as not to seem in agreement with those who would require it for [[Gentile]] converts.<ref name=butler>[http://www.bartleby.com/210/1/041.html Butler, Alban. ''The Lives of the Saints'', Vol. I, (1866)]</ref>\n\nTowards the close of the year 56, Paul, as he himself departed from Asia, sent Titus from [[Ephesus]] to [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], with full commission to remedy the fallout precipitated by Timothy's delivery of 1 Corinthians<ref>{{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|16:10\u201311|NIV}}</ref> and Paul's \"Painful Visit\",<ref>{{Bibleverse|2 Corinthians|2:1|NIV}}</ref> particularly a significant personal offense and challenge to Paul's authority by one unnamed individual.<ref>{{Bibleverse|2 Corinthians|2:5\u201311|NIV}}</ref> During this journey, Titus served as the courier for what is commonly known as the \"Severe Letter\", a Pauline missive that has been lost but is referred to in 2 Corinthians.<ref>{{Bibleverse|2 Corinthians|7:8|NIV}}</ref>\n\nAfter success on this mission, Titus journeyed north and met Paul in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]. There the apostle, overjoyed by Titus' success,<ref>{{Bibleverse|2 Corinthians|7:6\u201315|NIV}}</ref> wrote 2 Corinthians. Titus then returned to Corinth with a larger entourage, carrying 2 Corinthians with him. Paul joined Titus in Corinth later. From Corinth, Paul then sent Titus to organize the collections of alms for the Christians at Jerusalem. Titus was therefore a troubleshooter, peacemaker, administrator, and missionary.\n\nEarly church tradition holds that Paul, after his release from his first imprisonment in Rome, stopped at the island of Crete to preach. Due to the needs of other churches, requiring his presence elsewhere, he ordained his disciple Titus as bishop of that island,<ref>{{Bibleverse|Titus|1:5|NIV}}</ref> and left him to finish the work he had started. Chrysostom says that this is an indication of the esteem St. Paul held for Titus.<ref name=butler/>\n\nPaul summoned Titus from Crete to join him at Nicopolis in Epirus.<ref>{{Bibleverse|Titus|3:12|NIV}}</ref> Later, Titus traveled to [[Early centers of Christianity#Salona|Dalmatia]].<ref name=losservatore>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/b16ChrstChrch26.HTM Pope Benedict XVI. \"Timothy and Titus\", ''L'Osservatore Romano'', p. 11, December 27, 2006]</ref> The [[New Testament]] does not record his death.\n\nIt has been argued that the name \"Titus\" in 2 Corinthians and Galatians is nothing more than an informal name used by Timothy, implied already by the fact that even though both are said to be long-term close companions of Paul, they never appear in common scenes.<ref>Fellows, Richard G. \"Was Titus Timothy?\" ''Journal for the Study of the New Testament'' '''81''' (2001):33\u201358.</ref> The theory proposes that a number of passages\u20141 Cor. 4:17, 16.10; 2 Cor. 2:13, 7:6, 13\u201314, 12:18; and Acts 19.22\u2014all refer to the same journey of a single individual, Titus-Timothy. [[2 Timothy]] seems to dispute this, by claiming that Titus has gone to Dalmatia ({{Bibleverse|2 Timothy|4:10|NIV}}). The fact that Paul made a point of circumcising Timothy ({{Bibleverse|Acts|16:3|NIV}}) but refused to circumcise Titus ({{Bibleverse||Galatians|2:3}}) would indicate that they are different men, although certain manuscripts of Galatians ({{Bibleverse||Galatians|2:4}}) have been taken (by [[Marius Victorinus]],<ref>Cooper, Stephen. ''Marius Victorinus' Commentary on Galatians''. Oxford University Press, 2005.</ref> for example) to indicate that Paul ''did'' circumcise Titus.\n\n==Veneration==\nThe feast day of Titus was not included in the [[Tridentine Calendar]]. When added in 1854, it was assigned to 6 February.<ref>''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 86</ref> In 1969, the [[Catholic Church]] assigned the feast to 26 January so as to celebrate the two disciples of Paul, Titus and Timothy, the day after the feast of the [[Conversion of St. Paul]].<ref>''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 116</ref> The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] celebrates these two, together with [[Silas]], on the same date.

Actinium is the more often omitted of the two, because its placement as a group 3 element is somewhat more common in texts and for semantic reasons: since \"actinide\" means \"like actinium\", it has been argued that actinium cannot logically be an actinide, even though IUPAC acknowledges its inclusion based on common usage.<ref name = \"Greenwood&Earnshaw\">{{Greenwood&Earnshaw|pages=1230\u20131242}}</ref>\n\nThe actinide series derives its name from the first element in the series, actinium. The informal chemical symbol '''An''' is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide. All but one of the actinides are [[f-block]] elements, with the exception being either actinium or lawrencium. The series mostly corresponds to the filling of the 5f [[electron shell]], although actinium and thorium lack any f-electrons, and curium and lawrencium have the same number as the preceding element. In comparison with the [[lanthanide]]s, also mostly [[f-block]] elements, the actinides show much more variable [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]. They all have very large [[atomic radius|atomic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] and exhibit an unusually large range of physical properties. While actinium and the late actinides (from americium onwards) behave similarly to the lanthanides, the elements thorium, protactinium, and uranium are much more similar to [[transition metal]]s in their chemistry, with neptunium and plutonium occupying an intermediate position.\n\nAll actinides are [[radioactive]] and release energy upon radioactive decay; naturally occurring [[uranium]] and [[thorium]], and synthetically produced [[plutonium]] are the most abundant actinides on Earth. These are used in [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. Uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses, and [[americium]] is used in the [[ionization chamber]]s of most modern [[smoke detector]]s.\n\nOf the actinides, [[Primordial nuclide|primordial]] [[thorium]] and [[uranium]] occur naturally in substantial quantities. The radioactive decay of uranium produces transient amounts of [[actinium]] and [[protactinium]], and atoms of [[neptunium]] and plutonium are occasionally produced from [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] reactions in [[uranium ore]]s.

Within the actinides, there are two overlapping groups: [[transuranium element]]s, which follow uranium in the [[periodic table]]\u2014and [[Transuranium element|transplutonium elements]], which follow plutonium. Compared to the lanthanides, which (except for [[promethium]]) are found in nature in appreciable quantities, most actinides are rare. The majority of them do not even occur in nature, and of those that do, only thorium and uranium do so in more than trace quantities. The most abundant or easily synthesized actinides are uranium and thorium, followed by plutonium, americium, actinium, protactinium, neptunium, and curium.<ref>Myasoedov, p.7</ref>\n\nThe existence of transuranium elements was suggested by [[Enrico Fermi]] based on his experiments in 1934.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Possible Production of Elements of Atomic Number Higher than 92|journal=Nature|author= E.

The prevailing view that dominated early research into transuranics was that they were regular elements in the 7th period, with thorium, protactinium and uranium corresponding to 6th-period [[hafnium]], [[tantalum]] and [[tungsten]], respectively. Synthesis of transuranics gradually undermined this point of view. By 1944 an observation that curium failed to exhibit oxidation states above 4 (whereas its supposed 6th period homolog, [[platinum]], can reach oxidation state of 6) prompted [[Glenn Seaborg]] to formulate a so-called \"actinide hypothesis\". Studies of known actinides and discoveries of further transuranic elements provided more data in support of this point of view, but the phrase \"actinide hypothesis\" (the implication being that a \"hypothesis\" is something that has not been decisively proven) remained in active use by scientists through the late 1950s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths|volume=18 \u2013 Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry|editor1=K.A.

The first method is most important for applications, as only neutron irradiation using nuclear reactors allows the production of sizeable amounts of synthetic actinides; however, it is limited to relatively light elements. The advantage of the second method is that elements heavier than plutonium, as well as neutron-deficient isotopes, can be obtained, which are not formed during neutron irradiation.<ref>Myasoedov, p. 9</ref>\n\nIn 1962\u20131966, there were attempts in the United States to produce transplutonium isotopes using a series of six [[Underground nuclear testing|underground nuclear explosions]]. Small samples of rock were extracted from the blast area immediately after the test to study the explosion products, but no isotopes with [[mass number]] greater than 257 could be detected, despite predictions that such isotopes would have relatively long [[half-life|half-lives]] of [[Alpha decay|\u03b1-decay]].

Most thorium minerals contain uranium and vice versa; and they all have significant fraction of lanthanides. Rich deposits of thorium minerals are located in the United States (440,000 tonnes), Australia and India (~300,000 tonnes each) and Canada (~100,000 tonnes).<ref>[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/thorium/mcs-2010-thori.pdf Thorium], USGS Mineral Commodities</ref>\n\nThe abundance of actinium in the Earth's crust is only about 5{{e|-15}}%.<ref name=\"Himiya protaktiniya\"/> Actinium is mostly present in uranium-containing, but also in other minerals, though in much smaller quantities. The content of actinium in most natural objects corresponds to the isotopic equilibrium of parent isotope <sup>235</sup>U, and it is not affected by the weak Ac migration.<ref name=\"Himiya aktiniya\" /> Protactinium is more abundant (10<sup>\u221212</sup>%) in the Earth's crust than actinium. It was discovered in the uranium ore in 1913 by Fajans and G\u00f6hring.<ref name=fajans/> As actinium, the distribution of protactinium follows that of <sup>235</sup>U.<ref name=\"Himiya protaktiniya\"/>\n\nThe half-life of the longest-lived isotope of neptunium, [[Neptunium-237|<sup>237</sup>Np]], is negligible compared to the age of the Earth. Thus neptunium is present in nature in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes.<ref name=\"Himiya neptuniya\"/> Traces of plutonium in uranium minerals were first found in 1942, and the more systematic results on <sup>239</sup>Pu are summarized in the table (no other plutonium isotopes could be detected in those samples). The upper limit of abundance of the longest-living isotope of plutonium, <sup>244</sup>Pu, is 3{{e|-20}}%. Plutonium could not be detected in samples of lunar soil. Owing to its scarcity in nature, most plutonium is produced synthetically.<ref name=\"katz\"/>\n\n==Extraction==\n[[File:MonaziteUSGOV.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Monazite]]: a major thorium mineral]]\n\nOwing to the low abundance of actinides, their extraction is a complex, multistep process. [[Fluoride]]s of actinides are usually used because they are insoluble in water and can be easily separated with [[redox]] reactions. Fluorides are reduced with [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] or [[barium]]:<ref name=g215>Golub, pp. 215\u2013217</ref>\n: <math chem>\\begin{array}{l}{}\\\\\n\\ce{2AmF3{} + 3Ba ->[\\ce{1150-1350^\\circ C}] 3BaF2{} + 2Am}\\\\\n\\ce{PuF4{} + 2Ba ->[\\ce{1200^\\circ C}] 2BaF2{} + Pu}\\\\\n\\ce{UF4{} + 2Mg ->[\\ce{> 500^\\circ C}] U{} + 2MgF2}\\\\{}\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nAmong the actinides, thorium and uranium are the easiest to isolate. Thorium is extracted mostly from [[monazite]]: thorium [[pyrophosphate]] (ThP<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) is reacted with [[nitric acid]], and the produced thorium nitrate treated with [[tributyl phosphate]]. [[Rare earth element|Rare-earth]] impurities are separated by increasing the [[pH]] in sulfate solution.<ref name = g215/>\n\nIn another extraction method, monazite is decomposed with a 45% aqueous solution of [[sodium hydroxide]] at 140&nbsp;\u00b0C. Mixed metal hydroxides are extracted first, filtered at 80&nbsp;\u00b0C, washed with water and dissolved with concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]]. Next, the acidic solution is neutralized with hydroxides to pH = 5.8 that results in precipitation of thorium hydroxide (Th(OH)<sub>4</sub>) contaminated with ~3% of rare-earth hydroxides; the rest of rare-earth hydroxides remains in solution. Thorium hydroxide is dissolved in an inorganic acid and then purified from the [[rare earth element]]s. An efficient method is the dissolution of thorium hydroxide in nitric acid, because the resulting solution can be purified by [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extraction]] with organic solvents:<ref name = g215/>\n\n[[File:Plutonium and uranium extraction from nuclear fuel-eng.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Separation of uranium and plutonium from nuclear fuel<ref>Greenwood, pp. 1255, 1261</ref>]]\n\n:Th(OH)<sub>4</sub> + 4 HNO<sub>3</sub> \u2192 Th(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub> + 4 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nMetallic thorium is separated from the anhydrous oxide, chloride or fluoride by reacting it with calcium in an inert atmosphere:<ref name=g1255/>\n\n:ThO<sub>2</sub> + 2 Ca \u2192 2 CaO + Th\n\nSometimes thorium is extracted by [[electrolysis]] of a fluoride in a mixture of sodium and potassium chloride at 700\u2013800&nbsp;\u00b0C in a [[graphite]] crucible.

In one method, the ore is burned and then reacted with nitric acid to convert uranium into a dissolved state. Treating the solution with a solution of tributyl phosphate (TBP) in kerosene transforms uranium into an organic form UO<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(TBP)<sub>2</sub>. The insoluble impurities are filtered and the uranium is extracted by reaction with hydroxides as (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> or with [[hydrogen peroxide]] as UO<sub>4</sub>\u00b72H<sub>2</sub>O.<ref name=g215/>\n\nWhen the uranium ore is rich in such minerals as [[dolomite]], [[magnesite]], etc., those minerals consume much acid. In this case, the carbonate method is used for uranium extraction. Its main component is an aqueous solution of [[sodium carbonate]], which converts uranium into a complex [UO<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>4\u2212</sup>, which is stable in aqueous solutions at low concentrations of hydroxide ions. The advantages of the sodium carbonate method are that the chemicals have low [[Corrosion|corrosivity]] (compared to nitrates) and that most non-uranium metals precipitate from the solution. The disadvantage is that tetravalent uranium compounds precipitate as well. Therefore, the uranium ore is treated with sodium carbonate at elevated temperature and under oxygen pressure:\n:2 UO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> + 6 {{chem|CO|3|2-}} \u2192 2 [UO<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>4\u2212</sup>\nThis equation suggests that the best solvent for the uranium carbonate processing is a mixture of carbonate with bicarbonate. At high pH, this results in precipitation of diuranate, which is treated with [[hydrogen]] in the presence of nickel yielding an insoluble uranium tetracarbonate.<ref name=g215/>\n\nAnother separation method uses polymeric resins as a [[polyelectrolyte]]. Ion exchange processes in the resins result in separation of uranium. Uranium from resins is washed with a solution of [[ammonium nitrate]] or nitric acid that yields [[uranyl]] nitrate, UO<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O. When heated, it turns into UO<sub>3</sub>, which is converted to UO<sub>2</sub> with hydrogen:\n: UO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 UO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O\nReacting uranium dioxide with [[hydrofluoric acid]] changes it to [[uranium tetrafluoride]], which yields uranium metal upon reaction with magnesium metal:<ref name=g1255/>\n: 4 HF + UO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 UF<sub>4</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nTo extract plutonium, neutron-irradiated uranium is dissolved in nitric acid, and a reducing agent ([[Iron(II) sulfate|FeSO<sub>4</sub>]], or [[hydrogen peroxide|H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]]) is added to the resulting solution. This addition changes the oxidation state of plutonium from +6 to +4, while uranium remains in the form of uranyl nitrate (UO<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>). The solution is treated with a reducing agent and neutralized with [[ammonium carbonate]] to pH = 8 that results in precipitation of Pu<sup>4+</sup> compounds.<ref name=g215/>\n\nIn another method, Pu<sup>4+</sup> and {{chem|UO|2|2+}} are first extracted with tributyl phosphate, then reacted with [[hydrazine]] washing out the recovered plutonium.<ref name=g215/>\n\nThe major difficulty in separation of actinium is the similarity of its properties with those of lanthanum. Thus actinium is either synthesized in nuclear reactions from isotopes of radium or separated using ion-exchange procedures.<ref name=\"Himiya aktiniya\" />\n\n==Properties==\nActinides have similar properties to lanthanides. The 6''[[d-block|d]]'' and 7''[[s-block|s]]'' electronic shells are filled in actinium and thorium, and the 5[[f-block|''f'' shell]] is being filled with further increase in atomic number; the 4''f'' shell is filled in the lanthanides. The first experimental evidence for the filling of the 5''f'' shell in actinides was obtained by McMillan and Abelson in 1940.<ref name=\"I. L. Knunyants\">{{cite book|author = I.L.

All of them are soft and have a silvery color (but tarnish in air),<ref name=g1264>Greenwood, p. 1264</ref> relatively high [[density]] and plasticity. Some of them can be cut with a knife. Their [[electrical resistivity]] varies between 15 and 150 \u00b5Ohm\u00b7cm.<ref name=\"g1263\"/> The hardness of thorium is similar to that of soft steel, so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either of them. All actinides are radioactive, [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]], and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. The [[crystal structure]]s of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3''d''-[[transition metal]]s.<ref name=\"Yu. D. Tretyakov\"/>\n\nAll actinides are [[Pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]], especially when finely divided, that is, they spontaneously ignite upon reaction with air.<ref name=g1264/> The [[melting point]] of actinides does not have a clear dependence on the number of ''f''-electrons. The unusually low melting point of neptunium and plutonium (~640&nbsp;\u00b0C) is explained by [[Hybridization (chemistry)|hybridization]] of 5''f'' and 6''d'' orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in these metals.<ref name=\"Yu.

Actinides, especially those with a small number of 5''f''-electrons, are prone to [[Hybridization (chemistry)|hybridization]]. This is explained by the similarity of the electron energies at the 5''f'', 7''s'' and 6''d'' shells. Most actinides exhibit a larger variety of valence states, and the most stable are +6 for uranium, +5 for protactinium and neptunium, +4 for thorium and plutonium and +3 for actinium and other actinides.<ref name=g222>Golub, pp. 222\u2013227</ref>\n\nChemically, actinium is similar to lanthanum, which is explained by their similar ionic radii and electronic structure. Like lanthanum, actinium has oxidation of +3, but it is less reactive and has more pronounced [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] properties. Among other trivalent actinides Ac<sup>3+</sup> is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions.<ref name = \"Himiya aktiniya\" /><ref name=\"Yu. D. Tretyakov\"/>\n\nThorium is rather active chemically. Owing to lack of [[electron]]s on 6''d'' and 5''f'' orbitals, the tetravalent thorium compounds are colorless. At pH < 3, the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by the cations [Th(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>8</sub>]<sup>4+</sup>. The Th<sup>4+</sup> ion is relatively large, and depending on the [[coordination number]] can have a radius between 0.95 and 1.14 \u00c5. As a result, thorium salts have a weak tendency to hydrolyse. The distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility, not only in water, but also in polar organic solvents.<ref name=\"Yu. D. Tretyakov\"/>\n\nProtactinium exhibits two valence states; the +5 is stable, and the +4 state easily oxidizes to protactinium(V). Thus tetravalent protactinium in solutions is obtained by the action of strong reducing agents in a hydrogen atmosphere. Tetravalent protactinium is chemically similar to uranium(IV) and thorium(IV). Fluorides, phosphates, hypophosphate, iodate and phenylarsonates of protactinium(IV) are insoluble in water and dilute acids. Protactinium forms soluble carbonates. The hydrolytic properties of pentavalent protactinium are close to those of [[tantalum]](V) and [[niobium]](V). The complex chemical behavior of protactinium is a consequence of the start of the filling of the 5''f'' shell in this element.<ref name=\"Himiya protaktiniya\" />\n\nUranium has a valence from 3 to 6, the last being most stable. In the hexavalent state, uranium is very similar to the [[group 6 element]]s. Many compounds of uranium(IV) and uranium(VI) are [[non-stoichiometric compound|non-stoichiometric]], i.e. have variable composition. For example, the actual chemical formula of uranium dioxide is UO<sub>2+x</sub>, where ''x'' varies between \u22120.4 and 0.32. Uranium(VI) compounds are weak [[Oxidizing agent|oxidants]]. Most of them contain the linear \"[[uranyl]]\" group, {{chem|UO|2|2+}}. Between 4 and 6 ligands can be accommodated in an equatorial plane perpendicular to the uranyl group. The uranyl group acts as a [[hard acid]] and forms stronger complexes with oxygen-donor ligands than with nitrogen-donor ligands. {{chem|NpO|2|2+}} and {{chem|PuO|2|2+}} are also the common form of Np and Pu in the +6 oxidation state. Uranium(IV) compounds exhibit reducing properties, e.g., they are easily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. Uranium(III) is a very strong reducing agent. Owing to the presence of d-shell, uranium (as well as many other actinides) forms [[organometallic compound]]s, such as U<sup>III</sup>(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and U<sup>IV</sup>(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=\"Yu. D. Tretyakov\"/><ref name=g1278>Greenwood, p. 1278</ref>\n\nNeptunium has valence states from 3 to 7, which can be simultaneously observed in solutions. The most stable state in solution is +5, but the valence +4 is preferred in solid neptunium compounds. Neptunium metal is very reactive. Ions of neptunium are prone to hydrolysis and formation of [[coordination compound]]s.<ref name=\"Himiya neptuniya\" />\n\nPlutonium also exhibits valence states between 3 and 7 inclusive, and thus is chemically similar to neptunium and uranium. It is highly reactive, and quickly forms an oxide film in air. Plutonium reacts with [[hydrogen]] even at temperatures as low as 25\u201350&nbsp;\u00b0C; it also easily forms [[halide]]s and [[intermetallic compound]]s. Hydrolysis reactions of plutonium ions of different oxidation states are quite diverse. Plutonium(V) can enter [[polymerization]] reactions.<ref name=\"Plutoniy\"/><ref name=\"Himiya plutoniya\">{{cite book|author = M. S. Milyukova|title = Analytical chemistry of plutonium| place =Moscow|publisher = Nauka|year = 1965|isbn = 0-250-39918-0}}</ref>\n\nThe largest chemical diversity among actinides is observed in americium, which can have valence between 2 and 6. Divalent americium is obtained only in dry compounds and non-aqueous solutions ([[acetonitrile]]). Oxidation states +3, +5 and +6 are typical for aqueous solutions, but also in the solid state. Tetravalent americium forms stable solid compounds (dioxide, fluoride and hydroxide) as well as complexes in aqueous solutions. It was reported that in alkaline solution americium can be oxidized to the heptavalent state, but these data proved erroneous. The most stable valence of americium is 3 in the aqueous solutions and 3 or 4 in solid compounds.<ref name=m25>Myasoedov, pp. 25\u201329</ref>\n\nValence 3 is dominant in all subsequent elements up to lawrencium (with the exception of nobelium). Curium can be tetravalent in solids (fluoride, dioxide). Berkelium, along with a valence of +3, also shows the valence of +4, more stable than that of curium; the valence 4 is observed in solid fluoride and dioxide. The stability of Bk<sup>4+</sup> in aqueous solution is close to that of [[Cerium|Ce]]<sup>4+</sup>. Only valence 3 was observed for californium, einsteinium and fermium. The divalent state is proven for mendelevium and nobelium, and in nobelium it is more stable than the trivalent state. Lawrencium shows valence 3 both in solutions and solids.<ref name=m25/>\n\nThe redox potential <chem>\\mathit E_\\frac{M^4+}{AnO2^2+}</chem> increases from \u22120.32 V in uranium, through 0.34 V (Np) and 1.04 V (Pu) to 1.34 V in americium revealing the increasing reduction ability of the An<sup>4+</sup> ion from americium to uranium. All actinides form AnH<sub>3</sub> hydrides of black color with salt-like properties.

So the first berkelium compound, BkCl<sub>3</sub>, was synthesized in 1962 with an amount of 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide [[chloride]]s, [[bromide]]s, and [[iodide]]s are water-soluble, and [[fluoride]]s are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimates]] at a temperature of 56.5&nbsp;\u00b0C; because of its volatility, it is used in the separation of uranium isotopes with [[gas centrifuge]] or [[gaseous diffusion]]. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to [[anhydride]]s. They are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=g1269>Greenwood, p.1269</ref> The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable.<ref name=g222/>\n\nAction of acids on actinides yields salts, and if the acids are non-oxidizing then the actinide in the salt is in low-valence state:\n: U + 2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> \u2192 U(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>\n: 2Pu + 6HCl \u2192 2PuCl<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>\nHowever, in these reactions the regenerating hydrogen can react with the metal, forming the corresponding hydride. Uranium reacts with acids and water much more easily than thorium.<ref name=g222/>\n\nActinide salts can also be obtained by dissolving the corresponding hydroxides in acids. Nitrates, chlorides, sulfates and perchlorates of actinides are water-soluble. When crystallizing from aqueous solutions, these salts forming a hydrates, such as Th(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>\u00b76H<sub>2</sub>O, Th(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u00b79H<sub>2</sub>O and Pu<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>\u00b77H<sub>2</sub>O. Salts of high-valence actinides easily hydrolyze. So, colorless sulfate, chloride, perchlorate and nitrate of thorium transform into basic salts with formulas Th(OH)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and Th(OH)<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>. The solubility and insolubility of trivalent and tetravalent actinides is like that of lanthanide salts. So [[phosphate]]s, [[fluoride]]s, [[oxalate]]s, [[iodate]]s and [[carbonate]]s of actinides are weakly soluble in water; they precipitate as hydrates, such as ThF<sub>4</sub>\u00b73H<sub>2</sub>O and Th(CrO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u00b73H<sub>2</sub>O.<ref name=g222/>\n\nActinides with oxidation state +6, except for the AnO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup>-type cations, form [AnO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2\u2212</sup>, [An<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>]<sup>2\u2212</sup> and other complex anions. For example, uranium, neptunium and plutonium form salts of the Na<sub>2</sub>UO<sub>4</sub> (uranate) and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (diuranate) types. In comparison with lanthanides, actinides more easily form [[coordination compound]]s, and this ability increases with the actinide valence. Trivalent actinides do not form fluoride coordination compounds, whereas tetravalent thorium forms K<sub>2</sub>ThF<sub>6</sub>, KThF<sub>5</sub>, and even K<sub>5</sub>ThF<sub>9</sub> complexes. Thorium also forms the corresponding [[sulfate]]s (for example Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>\u00b7Th(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u00b75H<sub>2</sub>O), [[nitrate]]s and thiocyanates. Salts with the general formula An<sub>2</sub>Th(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>\u00b7''n''H<sub>2</sub>O are of coordination nature, with the [[coordination number]] of thorium equal to 12. Even easier is to produce complex salts of pentavalent and hexavalent actinides. The most stable coordination compounds of actinides \u2013 tetravalent thorium and uranium \u2013 are obtained in reactions with diketones, e.g. [[acetylacetone]].<ref name=g222/>\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:InsideSmokeDetector.jpg|thumb|Interior of a [[smoke detector]] containing [[americium-241]].]]\nWhile actinides have some established daily-life applications, such as in smoke detectors (americium)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19960101/http://www.uic.com.au/nip35.htm Smoke Detectors and Americium], Nuclear Issues Briefing Paper 35, May 2002</ref><ref name=g1262>Greenwood, p. 1262</ref> and [[gas mantle]]s (thorium),<ref name=g1255>Greenwood, p. 1255</ref> they are mostly used in [[nuclear weapon]]s and use as a [[nuclear fuel|fuel]] in nuclear reactors.<ref name=g1255/> The last two areas exploit the property of actinides to release enormous energy in nuclear reactions, which under certain conditions may become self-sustaining [[Nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]].\n\n[[File:Cerenkov Effect.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Self-illumination of a nuclear reactor by [[Cherenkov radiation]].]]\nThe most important isotope for [[nuclear power]] applications is [[uranium-235]].

The rate of nuclear reaction is controlled by introducing additional rods made of [[boron]] or [[cadmium]] or a liquid absorbent, usually [[boric acid]]. Reactors for plutonium production are called [[breeder reactor]] or breeders; they have a different design and use fast neutrons.</small>\n|}\nEmission of neutrons during the fission of uranium is important not only for maintaining the nuclear chain reaction, but also for the synthesis of the heavier actinides. [[Uranium-239]] converts via [[Beta decay|\u03b2-decay]] into plutonium-239, which, like uranium-235, is capable of spontaneous fission. The world's first nuclear reactors were built not for energy, but for producing plutonium-239 for nuclear weapons.\n\nAbout half of the produced thorium is used as the light-emitting material of gas mantles.<ref name=g1255/> Thorium is also added into multicomponent [[alloy]]s of [[magnesium]] and [[zinc]]. So the Mg-Th alloys are light and strong, but also have high melting point and ductility and thus are widely used in the aviation industry and in the production of [[missile]]s. Thorium also has good [[electron emission]] properties, with long lifetime and low potential barrier for the emission.<ref name=g220/> The relative content of thorium and uranium isotopes is widely used to estimate the age of various objects, including stars (see [[:Category:Radiometric dating|radiometric dating]]).<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Sergey Popov |author2=Alexander Sergeev |title = Universal Alchemy|url = http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/vs/article/6214/|language = Russian|journal=Vokrug Sveta|year = 2008|volume = 2811|issue = 4}}</ref>\n\nThe major application of plutonium has been in [[nuclear weapon]]s, where the isotope plutonium-239 was a key component due to its ease of fission and availability.

Its application is limited by the high price (about 1000 USD/g). This isotope has been used in [[thermopile]]s and water [[distillation]] systems of some space satellites and stations. So [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] spacecraft (e.g. [[Apollo 14]]<ref>[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/A14_PressKit.pdf Apollo 14 Press Kit \u2013 01/11/71], NASA, pp. 38\u201339</ref>) had heaters powered by kilogram quantities of plutonium-238 oxide; this heat is also transformed into electricity with thermopiles. The decay of plutonium-238 produces relatively harmless alpha particles and is not accompanied by gamma-irradiation. Therefore, this isotope (~160&nbsp;mg) is used as the energy source in heart pacemakers where it lasts about 5 times longer than conventional batteries.<ref name=g1262/>\n\n[[Actinium-227]] is used as a neutron source. Its high specific energy (14.5 W/g) and the possibility of obtaining significant quantities of thermally stable compounds are attractive for use in long-lasting thermoelectric generators for remote use. <sup>228</sup>Ac is used as an indicator of [[radioactivity]] in chemical research, as it emits high-energy electrons (2.18 MeV) that can be easily detected.

Together with radium and transuranium elements, actinium is one of the most dangerous radioactive poisons with high specific [[Alpha radiation|\u03b1-activity]]. The most important feature of actinium is its ability to accumulate and remain in the surface layer of [[skeleton]]s. At the initial stage of poisoning, actinium accumulates in the [[liver]]. Another danger of actinium is that it undergoes radioactive decay faster than being excreted. [[Adsorption]] from the digestive tract is much smaller (~0.05%) for actinium than radium.<ref name=\"Himiya aktiniya\" />\n\nProtactinium in the body tends to accumulate in the kidneys and bones. The maximum safe dose of protactinium in the human body is 0.03 [[Curie (unit)|\u00b5Ci]] that corresponds to 0.5 micrograms of <sup>231</sup>Pa. This isotope, which might be present in the air as [[aerosol]], is 2.5{{e|8}} times more toxic than [[hydrocyanic acid]].<ref name = \"Himiya protaktiniya\"/>{{contradiction inline|date=April 2016}}\n\nPlutonium, when entering the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time of plutonium in the body is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing \u03b1-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The [[median lethal dose]] (LD<sub>50</sub>) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22&nbsp;mg for a person weighing 70&nbsp;kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than [[radium]], and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5&nbsp;\u00b5g or 0.3 \u00b5Ci. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0.65&nbsp;\u00b5g or 0.04 \u00b5Ci. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5\u201325% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds, plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the [[lymphatic system]], or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones. Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood, and the rest is excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100% of it.<ref name=\"Plutoniy\">{{cite book|editor1=B.A. Nadykto |editor2=L.F.

(ed.), \"The theater essays of Arthur Miller\", foreword by Arthur Miller. NY: Viking Press, 1978 {{ISBN|0-14-004903-7}}\n\n==Miller's styles, themes, and characters==\n\nMiller successfully synthesized diverse dramatic styles and movements in the belief that a play should embody a delicate balance between the individual and society, between the singular personality and the polity, and between the separate and collective elements of life. He thought himself a writer of social plays with a strong emphasis on moral problems in American society and often questioned psychological causes of behavior. He also built on the [[Realist theater|realist tradition]] of [[Henrik Ibsen]] in his exploration of the individual's conflict with society but also borrowed Symbolist and expressionist techniques from [[Bertolt Brecht]] and others. Some critics attempt to interpret his work from either an exclusively political or an exclusively psychological standpoint but fail to pierce the social veil that Miller creates in his work.<ref name=\"Rollyson, Carl 2003, p1-12\">Rollyson, Carl; Price, Victoria, Author Biography, Critical Survey of Drama, Second Revised Edition, April 2003, pp. 1\u20131</ref> Miller often stressed that society made his characters what they are and how it dictated all of their fears and choices.<ref>McCormack, Thomas, \"Arthur Millers Manifesto\", ''The American Scholar'', Vol. 74, No. 3(Summer 2005), p. 143</ref>\n\n===Themes===\n\n====All American family====\nWhile Miller comes under criticism for his reputation, most critics note him as a dramatist of the family. One of his greatest strengths is his penetrating insight into [[familial relationships]].<ref>Carson, Neil, Contemporary Literary Criticism. Ed. Jean C. Stine and Bridget Broderick. Vol. 26. Detroit: Gale, 1983. From Literature Resource Center</ref> Often, Miller's characters are living in service of their family. The conventions of the family play, such as patterns, setting, and style of representation were set canonically by [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Tennessee Williams]], and Miller. In these plays, white men are privileged with their family and social responsibility; typically, these men are lower class. Miller maintained that family relationships and families must be immersed in social context.<ref>Lenke N\u00e9meth,\n''Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies'' (''HJEAS''), \"Arthur Miller's \"The Ride Down Mount Morgan\" and the Family-Play Tradition\", Vol. 11, No. 2, Representations of the Family in Modern English-Language Drama In Memory of Arthur Miller (Fall, 2005), pp. 77\u201388</ref>\n\n====Social responsibility====\nMiller is known for the consciousness of the characters in his play. In his plays, he confronts a level of banality with the roller coaster of guilt and responsibility. Some strong examples of characters who portray this struggle between their conscious and their social responsibility are Joe Keller in ''[[All My Sons]]'' and John Proctor in ''[[The Crucible]]''.<ref>Popkin, Henry, Arthur Miller: The Strange Encounter, The Sewanee Review, Vol. 68, No. 1 (Winter, 1960), pp. 34-60</ref> Miller often creates consequences for characters who ignore or violate their social responsibilities.\n\n====Life, death and human purpose====\n\nMiller's determination to deal with the eternal themes of life, death and human purpose is one of his most prominent themes across his works. This theme spans from Willy Loman's dedication to providing for his family and his inherent belief that his death would leave a legacy, to John Proctor's willingness to die to preserve his name. Nearly all of Miller's protagonists struggle with the mark they leave on life and what it means to die.<ref>Broderick, Bridget and Stein, Jean, \u2033Contemporary Literary Criticism\u2033, eds. Vol. 26. Detroit: Gale, 1983. 617 pp.</ref>\n\n===Famous characters of his works===\n\n====Willy Loman====\nIn ''Death of a Salesman'' \u2013 originally entitled \u201cThe Inside of His Head\u201d \u2013 Miller brilliantly solves the problem of revealing his main character's inner discord, rendering Willy Loman as solid as the society in which he tries to sell himself. Indeed, many critics believe that Miller has never surpassed his achievement in this play, which stands as his breakthrough work, distinguished by an extremely long Broadway run, by many revivals, and by many theater awards, including the Pulitzer Prize in 1949.<ref name=\"Rollyson, Carl 2003, p1-12\" /><ref>Arthur Miller, The Pulitzer Prices, pulitzerprize.org</ref> ''Death of a Salesman'' seems destined to remain an American classic and a standard text in American classrooms.\n\nWilly Loman desperately wants to believe that he has succeeded, that he is \u201cwell liked\u201d as a great salesman, a fine father, and a devoted husband. That he has not really attracted the admiration and popularity at which he has aimed is evident, however, in the weariness that belabors him from the beginning of the play. Nearing retirement he suffers a drastic decrease in sales work, a dissatisfying marriage, and a turbulent relationship with his sons which inexorably leads to his suicide with the justification that the insurance will finally provide for his family.<ref name=\"Rollyson, Carl 2003, p1-12\" />\n\n====Eddie Carbone====\nEddie Carbone is the central character in ''[[A View from the Bridge]]'' and is not positioned as the protagonist or the antagonist. He is a longshoreman who lives with his wife, Beatrice, and his 17-year-old niece, Catherine. When his family from Italy, Rodolpho and Marco, migrate illegally and begin to live with him, the small world that he operates in is disrupted. Eddie becomes conflicted and ultimately self-destructive over his sexual attraction to his niece and her involvement with one of his Italian tenants. His character arc culminates as he becomes an informer to the immigration authorities which leads to a confrontation with one of his tenants. Marco labels him as an informer and Eddie perceives this as a permanent blemish on his good name. This confrontation ultimately leads to his death, leaving Eddie as one of Miller's examples of tragic figures.<ref>Epstein, Arthur, \"A Look at ''A View from The Bridge''\", Texas Studies in Literature and Language, Vol. 7, No. 1 (Spring 1965), pp. 109\u201322</ref><ref>Krase, Jerome, \"The American Italian Historical Society: ''A View from The Bridge''\", ''Polish American Studies'', Vol. 65, No. 1 (Spring, 2008), pp. 23\u201340</ref>\n\n====John Proctor====\nJohn Proctor is the protagonist of one of Miller's most controversial works, ''[[The Crucible]]''. He is a faithful farmer who lives by a strict moral code that he violates by succumbing to an affair with a young girl, Abigail, who serves in his home. After Proctor rejects her, Abigail spitefully accuses John's wife of witchcraft, involving him in a string of affairs that challenge his beliefs and convictions. In his attempts to save his wife, he is convicted of witchcraft as well, and will only be acquitted if he confesses to his crime and signs his name to a piece of paper.<ref>Popkin, Harry, \"Arthur Miller's The Crucible\", College English,\nVol. 26, No. 2 (Nov., 1964), pp. 139\u201314<!-- Not the correct page range --></ref> Proctor is a strong, vital man in the prime of his life both in his confession of witchcraft and the subsequent passion with which he defends his name at the cost of his life.<ref>McGill, William Jr. \"The Crucible of History: Miller's John Proctor\"The New England Quarterly, Vol. 54, No. 2 (Jun., 1981), pp. 258\u201364</ref>\n\n====Joe Keller====\nCritics have long admired the playwright's suspenseful handling of the Keller family's burden in the play ''[[All My Sons]]''. The critical character in this work is Joe Keller, who permitted defective parts to remain in warplanes that subsequently crash. Not only does Joe Keller fail to recognize his social responsibility, but also he allows his business partner to take the blame and serve the prison term for the crime. Gradually, events combine to strip Keller of his rationalizations. He argues that he never believed that the cracked engine heads would be installed and that he never admitted his mistake because it would have driven him out of business at the age of sixty-one, when he would not have another chance to \u201cmake something\u201d for his family, his highest priority. Joe's irresponsibility is exposed through his son's questioning of his very humanity.<ref name=\"Rollyson, Carl 2003, p1-12\" /> Joe's suicide results from the tremendous guilt and self-awareness that arises during the play.\n\n====Maggie====\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\nMaggie is a character that appears in Arthur Miller's partially autobiographical play, ''[[After the Fall (play)|After the Fall]]''. She is both one of his most criticised and controversial characters, and one of his most famous ones. She is a thinly veiled version of Marilyn Monroe, Miller's former wife, and thus her suicide attempts after her and Quentin's divorce, and her depression is from reality. This is one of the reasons that reviews upon its first release were generally negative, owing to the similarities between fact and fiction. However, academic scholars find her to be one of the best, if not the best, of Miller's creations, as the play presents readers with a superb portrait of a woman facing a mental crisis. It also shows Monroe in comparison to the reasons for her marriage to Miller- for example, the fact that Miller took her seriously, and was ready to treat her as more than just an object, like everybody else. Miller also highlights his own feelings after Monroe's death by showing Quentin's, and his regret that he had been unable to save her from herself.\n\n===Literary and public criticism===\n[[Christopher Bigsby]] wrote ''Arthur Miller: The Definitive Biography'' based on boxes of papers Miller made available to him before his death in 2005.<ref name=\"Times\">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3499774.ece|title=Unseen writings show anti-racist passions of young Arthur Miller|author=Alberge, Dalya |work=The Times |location=London |date=March 7, 2008|accessdate=March 7, 2008 }}</ref> The book was published in November 2008, and is reported to reveal unpublished works in which Miller \"bitterly attack[ed] the injustices of American racism long before it was taken up by the civil rights movement\".<ref name=\"Times\" />\n\nIn his book ''Trinity of Passion'', author [[Alan M.

by [[Josef Kriehuber]]]]\n\n'''Anton''' (or '''Antonio''') '''Diabelli''' (6 September 1781{{spaced ndash}}7 April 1858) was an [[Austria]]n [[music]] publisher, editor and [[composer]]. Best known in his time as a publisher, he is most familiar today as the composer of the [[waltz]] on which [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] wrote his set of thirty-three ''[[Diabelli Variations]]''.<ref name=\"AllMusic.com\">[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/anton-diabelli-q1666/biography AllMusic.com]</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nDiabelli was born in [[Mattsee]] near [[Salzburg]], then in the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]]. A musical child, he sang in the [[boys' choir]] at [[Salzburg Cathedral]] where he is believed to have taken music lessons with [[Michael Haydn]]. By the age of 19 Diabelli had already composed several important compositions including six masses.\n\nDiabelli was trained to enter the [[priest]]hood and in 1800 joined the monastery at Raitenhaslach, [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]].<ref name=\"AllMusic.com\"/> He remained there until 1803, when Bavaria closed all its monasteries.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1803 Diabelli moved to [[Vienna]] and began teaching [[piano]] and [[classical guitar|guitar]] and found work as a proofreader for a music publisher. During this period he learned the music publishing business while continuing to compose. In 1809 he composed his comic opera, ''Adam in der Klemme.'' In 1817 he started a music publishing business and in 1818 he formed a partnership with [[Pietro Cappi]] to create the music publishing firm of Cappi & Diabelli.\n\nCappi & Diabelli became well known by [[arrangement|arranging]] popular pieces so they could be played by amateurs at home. A master of promotion, Diabelli selected widely-accessible music such as famous opera tune arrangements, dance music and popular new comic theatre songs.\n\nThe firm soon established a reputation in more serious music circles by championing the works of [[Franz Schubert]]. Diabelli recognized the composer's potential and became the first to publish Schubert's work with \"[[Der Erlk\u00f6nig]]\" in 1821. Diabelli's firm continued to publish Schubert's work until 1823 when an argument between Cappi and Schubert terminated their business. The following year Diabelli and Cappi parted ways, Diabelli launching a new publishing house, Diabelli & Co., in 1824. Following Schubert's early death in 1828 Diabelli purchased a large portion of the composer's massive musical estate from Schubert's brother [[Ferdinand Schubert|Ferdinand]]. As Schubert had hundreds of unpublished works, Diabelli's firm was able to publish \"new\" Schubert works for more than 30 years after the composer's death.\n\nDiabelli's publishing house expanded throughout his life, before he retired in 1851, leaving it under the control of [[Carl Anton Spina]]. When Diabelli died in 1858 Spina continued to run the firm and published much music by [[Johann Strauss II]] and [[Josef Strauss]]. In 1872 the firm was taken over by [[Friedrich Schreiber]] and in 1876 it merged with the firm of [[August Cranz]] who bought the company in 1879 and ran it under his name.\n\nDiabelli died in Vienna at the age of 76.\n\n==Compositions==\n{{main article|List of compositions by Anton Diabelli}}\nDiabelli produced a number of well-known works as a composer, including an [[operetta]] called ''Adam in der Klemme'', several [[mass (music)|mass]]es, [[song]]s and numerous piano and classical guitar pieces. Numerically his guitar pieces form the largest part of his works. His pieces for [[piano four hands]] are popular.\n\nDiabelli's composition ''Pleasures of Youth: Six Sonatinas'' is a collection of six [[sonatina]]s depicting a struggle between unknown opposing forces. This is suggested by the sharp and frequent change in dynamics from ''[[Dynamics (music)|forte]]'' to ''[[Dynamics (music)|piano]]''. When ''forte'' is indicated the pianist is meant to evoke a sense of wickedness, thus depicting the antagonist. In contrast the markings of ''piano'' represent the protagonist.\n\n===Diabelli Variations===\n{{listen|filename=Beethoven - Diabelli Variations - 00.ogg|title=Diabelli's Theme|description=Performed by Neal O'Doan}}\nThe composition for which Diabelli is now best known was actually written as part of an adventuring story. In 1819, as a promotional idea, he decided to try to publish a volume of [[variation (music)|variation]]s on a \"patriotic\" waltz he had penned expressly for this purpose, with one variation by every important Austrian composer living at the time, as well as several significant non-Austrians. The combined contributions would be published in an anthology called ''[[Vaterl\u00e4ndischer K\u00fcnstlerverein]]''. Fifty-one composers responded with pieces, including Beethoven, Schubert, [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria (1788\u20131831)|Archduke Rudolph of Austria]], [[Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart]] (jun.), [[Moritz, Prince of Dietrichstein]], [[Eduard de Lannoy|Heinrich Eduard Josef Baron von Lannoy]], [[Ignaz von Mosel|Ignaz Franz Baron von Mosel]], [[Carl Czerny]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], [[Ignaz Moscheles]], [[Simon Sechter]], and the eight-year-old [[Franz Liszt]] (although it seems Liszt was not invited personally, but his teacher Czerny arranged for him to be involved). Czerny was also enlisted to write a [[coda (music)|coda]]. Beethoven, however, instead of providing just one variation, provided 33, and his formed Part I of ''Vaterl\u00e4ndischer K\u00fcnstlerverein''. They constitute what is generally regarded as one of the greatest of Beethoven's piano pieces and as the greatest set of variations of their time, and are generally known simply as the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', Op. 120. The other 50 variations were published as Part II of ''Vaterl\u00e4ndischer K\u00fcnstlerverein''.\n\n==Cultural references==\nA [[sonatina]] of Diabelli's, presumably Sonatina in F major, Op. 168, No. 1 (I: Moderato cantabile), provides the title and a motif for the French [[novella]] ''[[Moderato Cantabile]]'' by [[Marguerite Duras]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Romantic guitar]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Published music and further reading==\n*[http://ethesis.siba.fi/showrecord.php?language=en_EN&ID=122896 Anton Diabelli's guitar works - a thematic catalogue with an introduction]; Doctoral Thesis by Jukka Savijoki (Sibelius Academy; 1996)\n*[http://www.editionsorphee.com/books/diabelli.html Anton Diabelli's Guitar Works: A Thematic Catalogue] by Jukka Savijoki (Editions Orph\u00e9e)\n*[https://rex.kb.dk/F?func=find-c&ccl_term=(WRD=Diabelli%20AND%20WWW=http%20NOT%20WWW=sheetmusicnow%20NOT%20WWW=freehandmusic%20NOT%20WWW=hebeonline)&local_base=mus01&con_lng=ENG Rischel & Birket-Smith's Collection of guitar music] Det Kongelige Bibliotek, Denmark\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080310003646/http://www.muslib.se/ebibliotek/boije/Boije_d.htm Boije Collection] The Music Library of Sweden\n*[http://www.karadar.com/Dictionary/diabelli.html www.karadar.com/Dictionary/diabelli.html]\n* {{IMSLP|id=Diabelli, Anton|cname=Anton Diabelli}}\n* {{ChoralWiki}}\n*[http://www.mutopiaproject.org/cgibin/make-table.cgi?Composer=DiabelliA Free scores] at the [[Mutopia Project]]\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb name|id=0224421|name=Anton Diabelli}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diabelli, Anton}}\n[[Category:1781 births]]\n[[Category:1858 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century classical composers]]\n[[Category:Austrian classical composers]]\n[[Category:Austrian male classical composers]]\n[[Category:Austrian opera composers]]\n[[Category:Male opera composers]]\n[[Category:Austrian people of Italian descent]]\n[[Category:Austrian Romantic composers]]\n[[Category:Composers for piano]]\n[[Category:Composers for the classical guitar]]\n[[Category:Sheet music publishers (people)]]", "sha1": "17oexv9bii29mirozr23eseupp74yn4"}}, {"title": "Anita Hill", "ns": "0", "id": "2314", "revision": {"id": "866195401", "parentid": "864999013", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T21:58:58Z", "contributor": {"username": "Nikkimaria", "id": "372290"}, "comment": "ce", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{For|the Lutheran pastor|Anita C.

While senators and other authorities noted that polygraph results cannot be relied upon and are inadmissible in courts, Hill's results did support her statements.<ref name=\"polygraph\" /> Thomas did not take a polygraph test.

They were furthered by ''[[American Spectator]]'' writer [[David Brock]] in his 1993 book ''[[The Real Anita Hill]]'',<ref name=\"strange justice\" /> though he later recanted the claims he had made, described in his book as \"character assassination,\" and apologized to Hill.<ref name=\"author lied\" /><ref>By 2004, Brock had made a political about-face from conservative to liberal and founded the progressive media watchdog organization [[Media Matters for America]]</ref> After interviewing a number of women who alleged that Thomas had frequently subjected them to sexually explicit remarks, ''Wall Street Journal'' reporters [[Jane Mayer]] and [[Jill Abramson]] wrote a book which concluded that Thomas had lied during his confirmation process.<ref name=\"smearing\" /><ref name=\"the selling\" /> [[Richard Lacayo]] in his 1994 review of the book for ''Time'' magazine remarked, however, that \"Their book doesn't quite nail that conclusion.\"<ref name=\"strange justice\" /> In 2007, Kevin {{sic|hide=y|Merida}}, a coauthor of another book on Thomas, remarked that what happened between Thomas and Hill was \"ultimately unknowable\" by others, but that it was clear that \"one of them lied, period.\"<ref name=\"good morning\" /><ref name=\"supreme discomfort\" /> Writing in 2007, Neil Lewis of ''The New York Times'' remarked that, \"To this day, each side in the epic he-said, she-said dispute has its unmovable believers.\"<ref name=\"weighs in\" />\n\nIn 2007, Thomas published his autobiography, ''My Grandfather's Son'', in which he revisited the controversy, calling Hill his \"most traitorous adversary\" and saying that pro-choice liberals, who feared that he would vote to overturn ''[[Roe v.

The bit layout of the audio data (excluding metadata) is called the [[audio coding format]] and can be uncompressed, or [[audio compression (data)|compressed]] to reduce the file size, often using [[lossy compression]]. The data can be a raw [[bitstream]] in an audio coding format, but it is usually embedded in a [[container format (digital)|container format]] or an audio data format with defined storage layer.\n\n==Format types==\nIt is important to distinguish between the [[audio coding format]], the [[Container format (digital)|container]] containing the raw audio data, and an [[audio codec]]. A codec performs the encoding and decoding of the raw audio data while this encoded data is (usually) stored in a container file. Although most audio file formats support only one type of audio coding data (created with an [[audio codec|audio coder]]), a multimedia container format (as [[Matroska]] or [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]]) may support multiple types of audio and video data.\n\nThere are three major groups of audio file formats:\n\n* Uncompressed audio formats, such as [[WAV]], [[AIFF]], [[Au file format|AU]] or [[raw audio format|raw]] header-less [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]];\n* Formats with [[lossless compression]], such as [[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]], [[Monkey's Audio]] ([[filename extension]] <code>.ape</code>), [[WavPack]] ([[filename extension]] <code>.wv</code>), [[TTA (codec)|TTA]], [[ATRAC]] Advanced Lossless, [[Apple Lossless|ALAC]] ([[filename extension]] <code>.m4a</code>), [[MPEG-4 SLS]], [[MPEG-4 ALS]], [[MPEG-4 DST]], [[Windows Media Audio#Windows Media Audio Lossless|Windows Media Audio Lossless (WMA Lossless)]], and [[Shorten (file format)|Shorten]] (SHN).\n* Formats with [[lossy data compression|lossy]] compression, such as [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]], [[MP3]], [[Vorbis]], [[Musepack]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[ATRAC]] and [[Windows Media Audio#WIndows Media Audio Lossy|Windows Media Audio Lossy (WMA lossy)]].\n\n===Uncompressed audio format===\n{{See also|Uncompressed video}}\nOne major uncompressed audio format, [[Pulse-code modulation|LPCM]], is the same variety of PCM as used in [[Compact Disc Digital Audio]] and is the format most commonly accepted by low level audio [[API]]s and [[Digital-to-analog converter|D/A converter]] hardware. Although LPCM can be stored on a computer as a [[raw audio format]], it is usually stored in a <code>.wav</code> file on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] or in a <code>.aiff</code> file on [[macOS]]. The AIFF format is based on the [[Interchange File Format]] (IFF), and the WAV format is based on the similar [[RIFF (File format)|Resource Interchange File Format]] (RIFF). WAV and AIFF are designed to store a wide variety of audio formats, lossless and lossy; they just add a small, [[metadata]]-containing header before the audio data to declare the format of the audio data, such as LPCM with a particular [[sampling (signal processing)|sample rate]], [[audio bit depth|bit depth]], [[endianness]] and number of [[audio channel|channels]]. Since WAV and AIFF are widely supported and can store LPCM, they are suitable file formats for storing and archiving an original recording.\n\n[[Broadcast Wave Format|BWF]] (Broadcast Wave Format) is a standard audio format created by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] as a successor to WAV. Among other enhancements, BWF allows more robust [[metadata]] to be stored in the file. See ''[[Broadcast Wave Format|European Broadcasting Union: Specification of the Broadcast Wave Format]]'' (EBU Technical document 3285, July 1997). This is the primary recording format used in many professional audio workstations in the television and film industry. BWF files include a standardized [[timestamp]] reference which allows for easy synchronization with a separate picture element.

The original, uncompressed data can be recreated from the compressed version.\n\nUncompressed audio formats encode both sound and silence with the same number of bits per unit of time. Encoding an uncompressed minute of absolute silence produces a file of the same size as encoding an uncompressed minute of music. In a lossless compressed format, however, the music would occupy a smaller file than an uncompressed format and the silence would take up almost no space at all.\n\nLossless compression formats include the common<ref>[http://www.hydrogenaud.io/forums/index.php?showtopic=60145 2008 ripping/encoding general poll - Hydrogenaudio Forums<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2011}}</ref> [[FLAC]], [[WavPack]], [[Monkey's Audio]], [[Apple Lossless|ALAC]] (Apple Lossless). They provide a compression ratio of about 2:1 (i.e. their files take up half the space of PCM). Development in lossless compression formats aims to reduce processing time while maintaining a good compression ratio.\n\n===Lossy compressed audio format===\nLossy compression enables even greater reductions in file size by removing some of the audio information and simplifying the data. This of course results in a reduction in audio quality, but a variety of techniques are used, mainly by exploiting [[psychoacoustics]], to remove the parts of the sound that have the least effect on perceived quality, and to minimize the amount of audible noise added during the process. The popular [[MP3|MP3 format]] is probably the best-known example, but the [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC format]] found on the iTunes Music Store is also common. Most formats offer a range of degrees of compression, generally measured in [[bit rate]]. The lower the rate, the smaller the file and the more significant the quality loss.\n\n==List of formats==\n{{see also|Comparison of audio coding formats|List of codecs}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | File Extension\n! scope=\"col\" | Creation Company\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| <code>[[3gp|.3gp]]</code> ||  || Multimedia container format can contain proprietary formats as [[Adaptive Multi-Rate audio codec|AMR]], [[AMR-WB]] or [[AMR-WB+]], but also some open formats\n|-\n| <code>[[Audible.com#Quality|.aa]]</code> || [[Audible.com]] ([[Amazon.com]])  || A low-bitrate [[audiobook]] container format with [[Digital rights management|DRM]], containing audio encoded as either [[MP3]] or the [[ACELP]] speech codec.\n|-\n| <code>[[Advanced Audio Coding|.aac]]</code> ||   || The Advanced Audio Coding format is based on the [[MPEG-2]] and [[MPEG-4]] standards.

Note the intake cover on the drone, which was used on early flights.]]\n\nFollowing the loss of [[Gary Powers]]' [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] over the Soviet Union, there were several discussions about using the A-12 OXCART as an unpiloted drone aircraft. Although Kelly Johnson had come to support the idea of drone reconnaissance, he opposed the development of an A-12 drone, contending that the aircraft was too large and complex for such a conversion. However, the Air Force agreed to fund the study of a high-speed, high-altitude drone aircraft in October 1962. The Air Force interest seems to have moved the CIA to take action, the project designated \"Q-12\". By October 1963, the drone's design had been finalized. At the same time, the Q-12 underwent a name change. To separate it from the other A-12-based projects, it was renamed the \"D-21\". (The \"12\" was reversed to \"21\"). \"Tagboard\" was the project's code name.<ref name=\"Peebles\"/>\n\nThe first D-21 was completed in the spring of 1964 by Lockheed. After four more months of checkouts and static tests, the aircraft was shipped to Groom Lake and reassembled. It was to be carried by a two-seat derivative of the A-12, designated the \"M-21\". When the D-21/M-21 reached the launch point, the first step would be to blow off the D-21's inlet and exhaust covers. With the D-21/M-21 at the correct speed and altitude, the LCO would start the ramjet and the other systems of the D-21. \"With the D-21's systems activated and running, and the launch aircraft at the correct point, the M-21 would begin a slight pushover, the LCO would push a final button, and the D-21 would come off the pylon\".<ref name=\"Peebles\"/>\n\nDifficulties were addressed throughout 1964 and 1965 at Groom Lake with various technical issues. Captive flights showed unforeseen aerodynamic difficulties. By late January 1966, more than a year after the first captive flight, everything seemed ready. The first D-21 launch was made on 5 March 1966 with a successful flight, with the D-21 flying 120 miles with limited fuel. A second D-12 flight was successful in April 1966 with the drone flying 1,200 miles, reaching Mach 3.3 and 90,000 feet. An accident on 30 July 1966 with a fully fueled D-21, on a planned checkout flight suffered from a non-start of the drone after its separation, causing it to collide with the M-21 launch aircraft. The two crewmen ejected and landed in the ocean 150 miles offshore. One crew member was picked up by a helicopter, but the other, having survived the aircraft breakup and ejection, drowned when sea water entered his pressure suit. Kelly Johnson personally cancelled the entire program, having had serious doubts from the start of the feasibility. A number of D-21s had already been produced, and rather than scrapping the whole effort, Johnson again proposed to the Air Force that they be launched from a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H]] bomber.<ref name=\"Peebles\"/>\n\nBy late summer of 1967, the modification work to both the D-21 (now designated D-21B) and the B-52Hs were complete. The test program could now resume. The test missions were flown out of Groom Lake, with the actual launches over the Pacific. The first D-21B to be flown was Article 501, the prototype. The first attempt was made on 28 September 1967, and ended in complete failure. As the B-52 was flying toward the launch point, the D-21B fell off the pylon. The B-52H gave a sharp lurch as the drone fell free. The booster fired and was \"quite a sight from the ground\". The failure was traced to a stripped nut on the forward right attachment point on the pylon. Several more tests were made, none of which met with success. However, the fact is that the resumptions of D-21 tests took place against a changing reconnaissance background. The A-12 had finally been allowed to deploy, and the [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71]] was soon to replace it. At the same time, new developments in reconnaissance satellite technology were nearing operation. Up to this point, the limited number of satellites available restricted coverage to the Soviet Union. A new generation of reconnaissance satellites could soon cover targets anywhere in the world. The satellites' resolution would be comparable to that of aircraft, but without the slightest political risk. Time was running out for the Tagboard.<ref name=\"Peebles\"/>\n\nSeveral more test flights, including two over [[China]], were made from [[Beale AFB]], California, in 1969 and 1970, to varying degrees of success. On 15 July 1971, Kelly Johnson received a wire canceling the D-21B program. The remaining drones were transferred by a C-5A and placed in dead storage. The tooling used to build the D-21Bs was ordered destroyed. Like the A-12 Oxcart, the D-21B Tagboard drones remained a Black airplane, even in retirement. Their existence was not suspected until August 1976, when the first group was placed in storage at the [[Davis-Monthan AFB]] [[Military Storage and Disposition Center]]. A second group arrived in 1977. They were labeled \"GTD-21Bs\" (GT stood for ground training).<ref name=\"Peebles\"/>\n\nDavis-Monthan is an open base, with public tours of the storage area at the time, so the odd-looking drones were soon spotted and photos began appearing in magazines. Speculation about the D-21Bs circulated within aviation circles for years, and it was not until 1982 that details of the Tagboard program were released. However, it was not until 1993 that the B-52/D-21B program was made public. That same year, the surviving D-21Bs were released to museums.<ref name=\"Peebles\"/>\n\n===Foreign technology evaluation===\n{{Main|Tonopah Test Range Airport}}\n[[File:4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron MiG-17F in flight.jpg|thumb|HAVE FERRY, the second of two [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17F]] \"Fresco\"s loaned to the United States by [[Israel]] in 1969.]]\n[[File:4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron MiG-21 in flight.jpg|thumb|HAVE DOUGHNUT, (MiG-21F-13) flown by [[United States Navy]] and [[Air Force Systems Command]] during its 1968 exploitation.]]\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], one of the missions carried out by the United States was the test and evaluation of captured [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] fighter aircraft. Beginning in the late 1960s, and for several decades, Area 51 played host to an assortment of Soviet-built aircraft. Under the HAVE DOUGHNUT, [[HAVE DRILL]] and HAVE FERRY programs, the first MiGs flown in the United States were used to evaluate the aircraft in performance, technical, and operational capabilities, pitting the types against U.S. fighters.<ref name=\"Red Eagles\">Steve Davies: \"Red Eagles. America's Secret MiGs\", Osprey Publishing, 2008</ref>\n\nThis was not a new mission, as testing of foreign technology by the USAF began during World War II. After the war, testing of acquired foreign technology was performed by the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC, which became very influential during the Korean War), under the direct command of the Air Materiel Control Department. In 1961 ATIC became the Foreign Technology Division (FTD), and was reassigned to [[Air Force Systems Command]]. ATIC personnel were sent anywhere where foreign aircraft could be found.\n\nThe focus of [[Air Force Systems Command]] limited the use of the fighter as a tool with which to train the [[front line]] tactical fighter pilots.<ref name=\"Red Eagles\"/> Air Force Systems Command recruited its pilots from the [[Air Force Flight Test Center]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California, who were usually graduates from various test pilot schools. [[Tactical Air Command]] selected its pilots primarily from the ranks of the [[United States Air Force Weapons School|Weapons School]] graduates.<ref name=\"Red Eagles\"/>\n\nIn August 1966, [[Iraqi Air Force]] fighter pilot Captain [[Munir Redfa]] [[List of Cold War pilot defections#Iraq|defected]], flying his [[MiG-21]] to [[Israel]] after being ordered to attack Iraqi Kurd villages with napalm. His aircraft was transferred to Groom Lake within a month to study. In 1968 the US Air Force and Navy jointly formed a project known as [[HAVE DOUGHNUT]] in which Air Force Systems Command, Tactical Air Command, and the U.S. Navy's Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Four (VX-4) flew this acquired Soviet made aircraft in simulated air combat training.<ref name=\"Red Eagles\"/> Because U.S. possession of the Soviet MiG-21 was, itself, secret, it was tested at Groom Lake. A joint Air Force-Navy team was assembled for a series of dogfight tests.<ref name=\"Peebles\"/>\n\nComparisons between the F-4 and the MiG-21 indicated that, on the surface, they were evenly matched. But air combat was not just about technology. In the final analysis, it was the skill of the man in the cockpit. The HAVE DOUGHNUT tests showed this most strongly. When the Navy or Air Force pilots flew the MiG-21, the results were a draw; the F-4 would win some fights, the MiG-21 would win others. There were no clear advantages. The problem was not with the planes, but with the pilots flying them. The pilots would not fly either plane to its limits. One of the Navy pilots was Marland W. \"Doc\" Townsend, then commander of VF-121, the F-4 training squadron at NAS Miramar. He was an engineer and a Korean War veteran and had flown almost every navy aircraft. When he flew against the MiG-21, he would outmaneuver it every time. The Air Force pilots would not go vertical in the MiG-21. The HAVE DOUGHNUT project officer was Tom Cassidy, a pilot with VX-4, the Navy's Air Development Squadron at Point Mugu. He had been watching as Townsend \"waxed\" the air force MiG-21 pilots. Cassidy climbed into the MiG-21 and went up against Townsend's F-4. This time the result was far different. Cassidy was willing to fight in the vertical, flying the plane to the point where it was buffeting, just above the stall. Cassidy was able to get on the F-4's tail. After the flight, they realized the MiG-21 turned better than the F-4 at lower speeds. The key was for the F-4 to keep its speed up. What had happened in the sky above Groom Lake was remarkable. An F-4 had defeated the MiG-21; the weakness of the Soviet plane had been found. Further test flights confirmed what was learned. It was also clear that the MiG-21 was a formidable enemy. United States pilots would have to fly much better than they had been to beat it. This would require a special school to teach advanced air combat techniques.<ref name=\"Peebles\"/>\n\nOn 12 August 1968, two Syrian air force lieutenants, Walid Adham and Radfan Rifai, took off in a pair of [[MiG-17]]Fs on a training mission. They lost their way and, believing they were over Lebanon, landed at the [[Betzet]] Landing Field in northern Israel. (One version has it that they were led astray by an Arabic-speaking Israeli).<ref name=\"Peebles\"/> Prior to the end of 1968 these MiG-17s were transferred from Israeli stocks and added to the Area 51 test fleet. The aircraft were given USAF designations and fake serial numbers so that they could be identified in DOD standard flight logs. As in the earlier program, a small group of Air Force and Navy pilots conducted mock dogfights with the MiG-17s. Selected instructors from the Navy's Top Gun school at [[NAS Miramar]], California, were chosen to fly against the MiGs for familiarization purposes. Very soon, the MiG-17's shortcomings became clear. It had an extremely simple, even crude, control system which lacked the power-boosted controls of American aircraft. The F-4's twin engines were so powerful it could accelerate out of range of the MiG-17's guns in thirty seconds. It was important for the F-4 to keep its distance from the MiG-17. As long as the F-4 was one and a half miles from the MiG-17, it was outside the reach of the Soviet fighter's guns, but the MiG was within reach of the F-4's missiles.<ref name=\"Peebles\"/>\n\nThe data from the HAVE DOUGHNUT and HAVE DRILL tests were provided to the newly formed [[United States Navy Fighter Weapons School|Top Gun]] school at [[NAS Miramar]]. By 1970, the HAVE DRILL program was expanded; a few selected fleet F-4 crews were given the chance to fight the MiGs. The most important result of Project HAVE DRILL is that no Navy pilot who flew in the project defeated the MiG-17 Fresco in the first engagement. The HAVE DRILL dogfights were by invitation only. The other pilots based at Nellis Air Force Base were not to know about the U.S.-operated MiGs. To prevent any sightings, the airspace above the Groom Lake range was closed. On aeronautical maps, the exercise area was marked in red ink. The forbidden zone became known as \"Red Square\".<ref name=\"Peebles\"/>\n\nDuring the remainder of the Vietnam War, the Navy kill ratio climbed to 8.33 to 1. In contrast, the Air Force rate improved only slightly to 2.83 to 1. The reason for this difference was Top Gun. The Navy had revitalized its air combat training, while the Air Force had stayed stagnant. Most of the Navy MiG kills were by Top Gun graduates.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nIn May 1973, Project HAVE IDEA was formed which took over from the older HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE FERRY and HAVE DRILL projects and the project was transferred to the [[Tonopah Test Range Airport]]. At Tonopah testing of foreign technology aircraft continued and expanded throughout the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=\"Red Eagles\"/>\n\nArea 51 also hosted another foreign materiel evaluation program called HAVE GLIB. This involved testing Soviet tracking and missile control radar systems. A complex of actual and replica Soviet-type threat systems began to grow around \"Slater Lake\", a mile northwest of the main base, along with an acquired Soviet \"Barlock\" search radar placed at [[Tonopah Air Force Station]]. They were arranged to simulate a Soviet-style air defense complex.\n\nThe Air Force began funding improvements to Area 51 in 1977 under project SCORE EVENT. In 1979, the CIA transferred jurisdiction of the Area 51 site to the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, California. Mr. Sam Mitchell, the last CIA commander of Area 51, relinquished command to USAF Lt. Col. Larry D. McClain.\n\n===Have Blue/F-117 program===\n{{Main|Lockheed Have Blue|Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|Tonopah Test Range Airport}}\n[[File:Have Blue bottom view.jpg|thumb|right|Underside view of ''Have Blue'']]\n[[File:F-117 Nighthawk Front.jpg|thumb|right|F-117 flying over mountains]]\nThe [[Lockheed Have Blue]] prototype stealth fighter (a smaller proof-of-concept model of the [[F-117 Nighthawk]]) first flew at Groom in December 1977.<ref name=\"rich_haveblue\">Rich, pp. 56\u201360</ref>\n\nIn 1978, the Air Force awarded a full-scale development contract for the F-117 to Lockheed Corporation's Advanced Development Projects. On 17 January 1981 the Lockheed test team at Area 51 accepted delivery of the first full Scale Development (FSD) prototype ''79\u2013780'', designated YF-117A. At 6:05&nbsp;am on 18 June 1981 Lockheed Skunk Works test pilot Hal Farley lifted the nose of YF-117A ''79\u2013780''' off the runway of Area 51.<ref name=\"F117hist\">http://www.usafpatches.com/pubs/stealth.pdf</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC) decided to set up a group-level organization to guide the F-117A to an initial operating capability. That organization became the 4450th Tactical Group (Initially designated \"A Unit\"), which officially activated on 15 October 1979 at [[Nellis AFB]], Nevada, although the group was physically located at Area 51. The 4450th TG also operated the A-7D Corsair II as a surrogate trainer for the F-117A, and these operations continued until 15 October 1982 under the guise of an avionics test mission.<ref name=\"F117hist\"/>\n\nFlying squadrons of the 4450th TG were the 4450th Tactical Squadron (Initially designated \"I Unit\") activated on 11 June 1981, and 4451st Tactical Squadron (Initially designated \"P Unit\") on 15 January 1983. The 4450th TS, stationed at Area 51, was the first F-117A squadron, while the 4451st TS was stationed at Nellis AFB and was equipped with [[A-7D Corsair II]]s painted in a dark motif, tail coded \"LV\". Lockheed test pilots put the YF-117 through its early paces. A-7Ds was used for pilot training before any F-117A's had been delivered by Lockheed to Area 51, later the A-7D's were used for F-117A chase testing and other weapon tests at the Nellis Range.\n\n15 October 1982 is important to the program because on that date Major Alton C. Whitley, Jr. became the first USAF 4450th TG pilot to fly the F-117A.<ref name=\"F117hist\"/>\n\nAlthough ideal for testing, Area 51 was not a suitable location for an operational group, so a new covert base had to be established for F-117 operations.<ref name=\"F117Area51\">{{cite web|url=http://www.f-117a.com/Area51.html|title=Area 51 Test Site|publisher=F-117A|date=14 July 2003|accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref>\n[[Tonopah Test Range Airport]] was selected for operations of the first USAF F-117 unit, the [[4450th Tactical Group]] (TG).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f-117a.com/4450th.html|title=4450th TG|publisher=F-117A|date=1 April 2002|accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref> From October 1979, the Tonopah Airport base was reconstructed and expanded. The 6,000&nbsp;ft runway was lengthened to 10,000&nbsp;ft. Taxiways, a concrete apron, a large maintenance hangar, and a propane storage tank were added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f-117a.com/Tonopah.html|title=Tonopah Test Range (TTR)|publisher=F-117A|date=14 July 2003|accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy early 1982, four more YF-117As were operating at the southern end of the base, known as the \"Southend\" or \"Baja Groom Lake\". After finding a large scorpion in their offices, the testing team (Designated \"R Unit\") adopted it as their mascot and dubbed themselves the \"Baja Scorpions\". Testing of a series of ultra-secret prototypes continued at Area 51 until mid-1981, when testing transitioned to the initial production of F-117 stealth fighters. The F-117s were moved to and from Area 51 by C-5 during darkness to maintain security. The aircraft were defueled, disassembled, cradled, and then loaded aboard the C-5 at night, flown to Lockheed, and unloaded at night before reassembly and flight testing. Groom performed radar profiling, F-117 weapons testing, and training of the first group of frontline USAF F-117 pilots.\n\nWhile the \"Baja Scorpions\" were working on the F-117, there was also another group at work in secrecy, known as \"the Whalers\" working on Tacit Blue.  A [[fly-by-wire]] technology demonstration aircraft with curved surfaces and composite material, to evade radar, it was a prototype, and never went into production.  Nevertheless, this strange-looking aircraft was responsible for many of the [[stealth technology]] advances that were used on several other aircraft designs, and had a direct influence on the B-2; with first flight of [[Tacit Blue]] being performed on 5 February 1982, by [[Northrop Grumman Corporation|Northrop Grumman]] test pilot, [[Richard G. Thomas]].\n\nProduction FSD airframes from Lockheed were shipped to Area 51 for acceptance testing. As the Baja Scorpions tested the aircraft with functional check flights and L.O. verification, the operational airplanes were then transferred to the 4450th TG.<ref name=\"BScorpions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.f-117a.com/Baja.html|title=JTF \"Baja Scorpions\" of Groom Lake|publisher=F-117A|date=14 July 2003|accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 May 1982, the move of the 4450th TG from Groom Lake to Tonopah was initiated, with the final components of the move completed in early 1983. Production FSD airframes from Lockheed were shipped to Area 51 for acceptance testing. As the Baja Scorpions tested the aircraft with functional check flights and L.O. verification, the operational airplanes were then transferred to the 4450th TG at Tonopah.\n<ref name=\"BScorpions\"/>\n\nThe R-Unit was inactivated on 30 May 1989. Upon inactivation, the unit was reformed as Detachment 1, [[57th Fighter Weapons Wing]] (FWW). In 1990 the last F-117A (''843'') was delivered from Lockheed. After completion of acceptance flights at Area 51 of this last new F-117A aircraft, the flight test squadron continued flight test duties of refurbished aircraft after modifications by Lockheed. In February/March 1992 the test unit moved from Area 51 to the USAF Palmdale [[Plant 42]] and was integrated with the [[Air Force Systems Command]] [[6510th Test Squadron]]. Some testing, especially RCS verification and other classified activity was still conducted at Area 51 throughout the operational lifetime of the F-117. The recently inactivated (2008) [[410th Flight Test Squadron]] traces its roots, if not its formal lineage to the 4450th TG R-unit.\n<ref name=\"BScorpions\"/>\n\n===Later operations===\n[[File:F22 Area51.jpg|thumb|F-22 during a [[Red Flag exercise]] with Groom Lake in the background (March 2013)]]\nSince the F-117 became operational in 1983, operations at Groom Lake have continued.

Their suit, in which they were represented by [[George Washington University]] law professor [[Jonathan Turley]], alleged they had been present when large quantities of unknown chemicals had been burned in open pits and trenches at Groom. [[biopsy|Biopsies]] taken from the complainants were analyzed by [[Rutgers University]] [[biochemistry|biochemists]], who found high levels of [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]], [[dibenzofuran]], and [[trichloroethylene]] in their body fat. The complainants alleged they had sustained skin, liver, and respiratory injuries due to their work at Groom, and that this had contributed to the deaths of Frost and Kasza. The suit sought compensation for the injuries they had sustained, claiming the USAF had illegally handled toxic materials, and that the EPA had failed in its duty to enforce the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (which governs handling of dangerous materials). They also sought detailed information about the chemicals to which they were allegedly exposed, hoping this would facilitate the medical treatment of survivors. Congressman [[Lee H.

Once the U-2 began flying at above 60,000 feet, an unexpected side effect was an increasing number of UFO sighting reports. Sightings occurred most often during early evenings hours, when airline pilots flying west saw the U-2's silver wings reflect the setting sun, giving the aircraft a \"fiery\" appearance. Many sighting reports came to the Air Force's [[Project Blue Book]], which investigated UFO sightings, through air-traffic controllers and letters to the government. The project checked U-2 and later OXCART flight records to eliminate the majority of UFO reports it received during the late 1950s and 1960s, although it could not reveal to the letter writers the truth behind what they saw.<ref name=\"cia1992\" />{{rp|72\u201373}} Similarly, veterans of experimental projects such as OXCART and [[NERVA]] at Area 51 agree that their work (including 2,850 OXCART test flights alone) inadvertently prompted many of the UFO sightings and other rumors:<ref name=\"jacobsen\"/>\n{{quote|The shape of OXCART was unprecedented, with its wide, disk-like fuselage designed to carry vast quantities of fuel.

As audio signals may be represented in either [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital]] or [[analog signal|analog]] format, processing may occur in either domain.  Analog processors operate directly on the electrical signal, while digital processors operate mathematically on the digital representation of that signal.\n\n== History ==\nAudio signals are electronic representations of [[sound wave]]s\u2014[[longitudinal wave]]s which travel through air, consisting of compressions and rarefactions. The energy contained in audio signals is typically measured in [[decibel]]s. Audio processing was necessary for early [[radio broadcasting]], as there were many problems with studio to transmitter links.<ref>{{cite book|last=Atti|first=Andreas Spanias, Ted Painter, Venkatraman|title=Audio signal processing and coding|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=0-471-79147-4|pages=464|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_z-OQbadPIC|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}</ref>\n\n== Analog signals ==\n\n{{Main|Analog signal processing}}\n''Analog'' indicates something that is mathematically represented by a [[continuous function]]. Thus, an analog signal is one represented by a continuous stream of data, in this case along an electrical circuit in the form of voltage or current. Analog signal processing then involves physically altering the continuous signal by changing the voltage or current or charge via various electrical means.\n\nHistorically, before the advent of widespread [[digital technology]], analog was the only method by which to manipulate a signal. Since that time, as computers and software have become more capable and affordable and digital signal processing has become the method of choice.\n\n== Digital signals ==\n\n{{Main|Digital signal processing}}\nA digital representation expresses the audio waveform as a sequence of symbols, usually [[Binary numeral system|binary numbers]].  This permits signal processing using [[digital circuits]] such as [[digital signal processor]]s, [[microprocessor]]s and general-purpose [[computer]]s.  Most modern audio systems use a digital approach as the techniques of digital signal processing are much more powerful and efficient than analog domain signal processing.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Digital Audio Signal Processing |first=Udo |last=Z\u00f6lzer |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=1997 |ISBN=0-471-97226-6}}</ref>\n\n== Application areas ==\n\nProcessing methods and application areas include [[audio storage|storage]], [[audio data compression|data compression]], [[music information retrieval]], [[speech processing]], [[acoustic location|localization]], [[detection theory|acoustic detection]], [[transmission (telecom)|transmission]], [[noise cancellation]], [[acoustic fingerprint|acoustic fingerprinting]], [[sound recognition]], [[synthesizer|synthesis]], and enhancement (e.g. [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]], [[audio filter|filtering]], [[audio level compression|level compression]], [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] and [[reverb]] removal or addition, etc.).\n\n=== Audio broadcasting ===\n\nArguably the most important audio processing in audio broadcasting takes place just before the transmitter. The audio processor here must\n* prevent or minimize [[overmodulation]],\n* compensate for non-linear transmitters (a potential issue with [[medium wave]] and [[shortwave]] broadcasting) and\n* adjust overall [[loudness]] to desired level.\n\n=== Active noise control ===\n\n[[Active noise control]] is a technique designed to reduce unwanted sound. By creating a signal that is identical to the unwanted noise but with the opposite polarity, the two signals cancel out due to [[destructive interference]].\n\n=== Audio synthesis ===\n{{see also|Synthesizer}}\n\nAudio synthesis is the electronic generation of audio signals. A musical instrument that accomplishes this is called a synthesizer. Synthesizers can either [[Physical modelling synthesis|imitate sounds]] or generate new ones. Audio synthesis is also used to generate human [[speech]] using [[speech synthesis]].<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n=== Audio effects ===\n\nAudio effects are systems designed to alter how an audio signal sounds. Unprocessed audio is metaphorically referred to as \"dry\", while processed audio is referred to as \"wet\".<ref>Hodgson, Jay (2010). ''Understanding Records'', p.95. {{ISBN|978-1-4411-5607-5}}.</ref>\n\n* ''[[echo (phenomenon)|echo]]'' - to simulate the effect of reverberation in a large hall or cavern, one or several delayed signals are added to the original signal. To be perceived as echo, the delay has to be of order 35 milliseconds or above.  Short of actually playing a sound in the desired environment, the effect of echo can be implemented using either [[Digital data|digital]] or [[analog (signal)|analog]] methods.  Analog echo effects are implemented using [[Delay (audio effect)|tape delay]]s and/or [[spring reverb]]s.  When large numbers of delayed signals are mixed over several seconds, the resulting sound has the effect of being presented in a large room, and it is more commonly called [[reverberation]] or [[reverberation|reverb]] for short.\n* ''[[flanging|flanger]]'' - to create an unusual sound, a delayed signal is added to the original signal with a continuously variable delay (usually smaller than 10 ms).  This effect is now done electronically using [[digital signal processing|DSP]], but originally the effect was created by playing the same recording on two synchronized tape players, and then mixing the signals together.  As long as the machines were synchronized, the mix would sound more-or-less normal, but if the operator placed his finger on the flange of one of the players (hence \"flanger\"), that machine would slow down and its signal would fall out-of-phase with its partner, producing a phasing effect.  Once the operator took his finger off, the player would speed up until its [[tachometer]] was back in phase with the master, and as this happened, the phasing effect would appear to slide up the frequency spectrum.  This phasing up-and-down the register can be performed rhythmically.\n* ''[[phaser (effect)|phaser]]'' - another way of creating an unusual sound; the signal is split, a portion is [[audio filter|filtered]] with an [[all-pass filter]] to produce a phase-shift, and then the unfiltered and filtered signals are mixed. The phaser effect was originally a simpler implementation of the flanger effect since delays were difficult to implement with analog equipment.  Phasers are often used to give a \"synthesized\" or electronic effect to natural sounds, such as human speech.  The voice of [[C-3PO]] from ''[[Star Wars]]'' was created by taking the actor's voice and treating it with a phaser.\n* ''[[chorus effect|chorus]]'' - a delayed signal is added to the original signal with a constant delay. The delay has to be short in order not to be perceived as echo, but above 5 ms to be audible.  If the delay is too short, it will destructively interfere with the un-delayed signal and create a [[flanging]] effect.  Often, the delayed signals will be slightly pitch shifted to more realistically convey the effect of multiple voices.\n* ''[[equalization (audio)|equalization]]'' - different frequency bands are [[Attenuation|attenuated]] or boosted to produce desired spectral characteristics. Moderate use of equalization (often abbreviated as \"EQ\") can be used to \"fine-tune\" the tone quality of a recording; extreme use of equalization, such as heavily cutting a certain frequency can create more unusual effects.\n* ''[[audio filter|filtering]]'' - Equalization is a form of filtering.  In the general sense, frequency ranges can be emphasized or attenuated using [[Low-pass filter|low-pass]], [[High-pass filter|high-pass]], [[Band-pass filter|band-pass]] or [[Band-stop filter|band-stop]] filters.  Band-pass filtering of voice can simulate the effect of a telephone because telephones use band-pass filters.\n* ''[[overdriven|overdrive]]'' effects such as the use of a [[Distortion (music)|fuzz box]] can be used to produce distorted sounds, such as for imitating robotic voices or to simulate distorted radiotelephone traffic (e.g., the radio chatter between starfighter pilots in the science fiction film ''[[Star Wars]]'') {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}.  The most basic overdrive effect involves ''clipping'' the signal when its [[absolute value]] exceeds a certain threshold.\n* ''[[audio timescale-pitch modification|pitch shift]]'' - this effect shifts a signal up or down in pitch. For example, a signal may be shifted an octave up or down.  This is usually applied to the entire signal, and not to each note separately. Blending the original signal with shifted duplicate(s) can create harmonies from one voice.  Another application of pitch shifting is [[pitch correction]].  Here a musical signal is tuned to the correct pitch using digital signal processing techniques.  This effect is ubiquitous in karaoke machines and is often used to assist pop singers who sing out of tune.  It is also used intentionally for aesthetic effect in such pop songs as [[Cher]]'s ''[[Believe (Cher song)|Believe]]'' and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s ''[[Die Another Day (song)|Die Another Day]]''.\n* ''[[audio timescale-pitch modification|time stretching]]'' - the complement of pitch shift, that is, the process of changing the speed of an audio signal without affecting its pitch.\n* ''[[resonators]]'' - emphasize harmonic frequency content on specified frequencies. These may be created from parametric EQs or from delay-based comb-filters.\n* ''[[robotic voice effects]]'' are used to make an actor's voice sound like a synthesized human voice.\n* ''[[modulation]]'' - to change the frequency or amplitude of a carrier signal in relation to a predefined signal. [[ring modulator|Ring modulation]], also known as amplitude modulation, is an effect made famous by [[Doctor Who]]'s [[Dalek]]s and commonly used throughout sci-fi.\n* ''[[Audio level compression|compression]]'' - the reduction of the dynamic range of a sound to avoid unintentional fluctuation in the dynamics.  Level compression is not to be confused with [[audio data compression]], where the amount of data is reduced without affecting the amplitude of the sound it represents.\n* ''[[3D audio effect]]s'' - place sounds outside the stereo basis\n* ''[[reverse echo]]'' - a swelling effect created by reversing an audio signal and recording echo and/or delay while the signal runs in reverse. When played back forward the last echos are heard before the effected sound creating a rush like swell preceding and during playback. [[Jimmy Page]] of [[Led Zeppelin]] used this effect in the bridge of \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=308 |title=WHOLE LOTTA LOVE by LED ZEPPELIN |access-date=5 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.led-zeppelin.org/assorted-info/53-pages-studio-tricks-iii-backwards-echo |title=Page's Studio Tricks III (Backwards echo) |last=O'Neil |first=Bill |access-date=5 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://audioschoolonline.blogspot.in/2012/11/the-history-of-reverse-reverb.html |title=The History of Reverse Reverb |last=Audrey |access-date=5 January 2018}}</ref>\n* ''[[wave field synthesis]]'' - a spatial audio rendering technique for the creation of virtual acoustic environments\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sound card]]\n* [[Sound effect]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{Cite book | last = Rocchesso | first = Davide | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Introduction to Sound Processing | publisher = | date = March 20, 2003| pages = | url = http://dsp-book.narod.ru/spv.pdf | doi = | isbn = }}\n{{Audio broadcasting}}\n{{Music production}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Audio Signal Processing}}\n[[Category:Audio electronics]]\n[[Category:Signal processing]]", "sha1": "biji4fpna3ayq7olp866gpnkmzc8auu"}}, {"title": "Amdahl's law", "ns": "0", "id": "2323", "revision": {"id": "862766351", "parentid": "862708079", "timestamp": "2018-10-06T15:21:03Z", "contributor": {"username": "Haseleyi", "id": "34829719"}, "minor": "", "comment": "The variable \"p\" referred to in the introductory graph's caption was misleading (it implicitly meant \"number of processors\" but is defined differently under Definition)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{more footnotes|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:AmdahlsLaw.svg|thumb|400px|Evolution according to Amdahl's law of the theoretical speedup in latency of the execution of a program in function of the number of processors executing it. The speedup is limited by the serial part of the program. For example, if 95% of the program can be parallelized, the theoretical maximum speedup using parallel computing would be 20 times.]]\n\nIn [[computer architecture]], '''Amdahl's law''' (or '''Amdahl's argument'''<ref>{{harv|Rodgers|1985|p=226}}</ref>) is a formula which gives the theoretical [[speedup]] in [[latency (engineering)|latency]] of the execution of a task at fixed [[workload]] that can be expected of a system whose resources are improved. It is named after computer scientist [[Gene Amdahl]], and was presented at the [[American Federation of Information Processing Societies|AFIPS]] Spring Joint Computer Conference in 1967.\n\nAmdahl's law is often used in [[parallel computing]] to predict the theoretical speedup when using multiple processors. For example, if a program needs 20 hours using a single processor core, and a particular part of the program which takes one hour to execute cannot be parallelized, while the remaining 19 hours ({{nowrap|1=''p'' = 0.95}}) of execution time can be parallelized, then regardless of how many processors are devoted to a parallelized execution of this program, the minimum execution time cannot be less than that critical one hour. Hence, the theoretical speedup is limited to at most 20 times ({{nowrap|1=1/(1 \u2212 ''p'') = 20}}). For this reason, parallel computing with many processors is useful only for highly parallelizable programs.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nAmdahl's law can be formulated in the following way:\n: <math>S_\\text{latency}(s) = \\frac 1 {(1 - p) + \\frac p s}</math>\nwhere\n* ''S''<sub>latency</sub> is the theoretical speedup of the execution of the whole task;\n* ''s'' is the speedup of the part of the task that benefits from improved system resources;\n* ''p'' is the proportion of execution time that the part benefiting from improved resources originally occupied.\n\nFurthermore,\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{cases}\nS_\\text{latency}(s) \\leq \\dfrac 1 {1 - p} \\\\[8pt]\n\\lim\\limits_{s \\to \\infty} S_\\text{latency}(s) = \\dfrac 1 {1 - p}.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nshows that the theoretical speedup of the execution of the whole task increases with the improvement of the resources of the system and that regardless of the magnitude of the improvement, the theoretical speedup is always limited by the part of the task that cannot benefit from the improvement.\n\nAmdahl's law applies only to the cases where the problem size is fixed. In practice, as more computing resources become available, they tend to get used on larger problems (larger datasets), and the time spent in the parallelizable part often grows much faster than the inherently serial work. In this case, [[Gustafson's law]] gives a less pessimistic and more realistic assessment of the parallel performance.<ref>{{cite book\n| author1=Michael McCool\n| author2=James Reinders\n| author3=Arch Robison\n| title=Structured Parallel Programming: Patterns for Efficient Computation\n| publisher=Elsevier\n| year=2013\n| pages=61}}</ref>\n\n== Derivation ==\n\nA task executed by a system whose resources are improved compared to an initial similar system can be split up into two parts:\n\n* a part that does not benefit from the improvement of the resources of the system;\n* a part that benefits from the improvement of the resources of the system.\n\nAn example is a computer program that processes files from disk. A part of that program may scan the directory of the disk and create a list of files internally in memory. After that, another part of the program passes each file to a separate [[Thread (computing)|thread]] for processing. The part that scans the directory and creates the file list cannot be sped up on a parallel computer, but the part that processes the files can.\n\nThe execution time of the whole task before the improvement of the resources of the system is denoted as <math> T </math>. It includes the execution time of the part that would not benefit from the improvement of the resources and the execution time of the one that would benefit from it. The fraction of the execution time of the task that would benefit from the improvement of the resources is denoted by <math> p </math>. The one concerning the part that would not benefit from it is therefore {{nowrap |<math> 1 - p </math>}}. Then:\n\n: <math>T = (1 - p)T + pT.</math>\n\nIt is the execution of the part that benefits from the improvement of the resources that is accelerated by the factor <math> s </math> after the improvement of the resources. Consequently, the execution time of the part that does not benefit from it remains the same, while the part that benefits from it becomes:\n\n: <math>\\frac{p}{s}T.</math>\n\nThe theoretical execution time <math> T (s) </math> of the whole task after the improvement of the resources is then:\n\n: <math>T(s) = (1 - p)T + \\frac p s T.</math>\n\nAmdahl's law gives the theoretical [[speedup]] in [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] of the execution of the whole task ''at fixed workload <math> W </math>'', which yields\n: <math>S_\\text{latency}(s) = \\frac{TW}{T(s)W} = \\frac{T}{T(s)} = \\frac 1 {1 - p + \\frac p s}.</math>\n\n=== Parallel programs ===\n\nIf 30% of the execution time may be the subject of a speedup, ''p'' will be 0.3; if the improvement makes the affected part twice as fast, ''s'' will be&nbsp;2. Amdahl's law states that the overall speedup of applying the improvement will be:\n\n: <math>S_\\text{latency} = \\frac{1}{1 - p + \\frac{p}{s}} = \\frac 1 {1 - 0.3 + \\frac {0.3} 2} = 1.18.</math>\n\nFor example, assume that we are given a serial task which is split into four consecutive parts, whose percentages of execution time are {{nowrap|1=''p''1 = 0.11}}, {{nowrap|1=''p''2 = 0.18}}, {{nowrap|1=''p''3 = 0.23}}, and {{nowrap|1=''p''4 = 0.48}} respectively. Then we are told that the 1st part is not sped up, so {{nowrap|1=''s''1 = 1}}, while the 2nd part is sped up 5 times, so {{nowrap|1=''s''2 = 5}}, the 3rd part is sped up 20 times, so {{nowrap|1=''s''3 = 20}}, and the 4th part is sped up 1.6 times, so {{nowrap|1=''s''4 = 1.6}}. By using Amdahl's law, the overall speedup is\n: <math>S_\\text{latency} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{p1}{s1} + \\frac{p2}{s2} + \\frac{p3}{s3} + \\frac{p4}{s4}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.11}{1} + \\frac{0.18}{5} + \\frac{0.23}{20} + \\frac{0.48}{1.6}} = 2.19.</math>\nNotice how the 20 times and 5 times speedup on the 2nd and 3rd parts respectively don't have much effect on the overall speedup when the 4th part (48% of the execution time) is accelerated by only 1.6 times.\n\n=== Serial programs ===\n[[File:Optimizing-different-parts.svg|thumb|400px|Assume that a task has two independent parts, ''A'' and ''B''. Part ''B'' takes roughly 25% of the time of the whole computation. By working very hard, one may be able to make this part 5 times faster, but this reduces the time of the whole computation only slightly. In contrast, one may need to perform less work to make part ''A'' perform twice as fast. This will make the computation much faster than by optimizing part ''B'', even though part ''B'''s speedup is greater in terms of the ratio, (5 times versus 2 times).]]\n\nFor example, with a serial program in two parts ''A'' and ''B'' for which {{nowrap|1=''T''<sub>''A''</sub> = 3 s}} and {{nowrap|1=''T''<sub>''B''</sub> = 1 s}},\n* if part ''B'' is made to run 5 times faster, that is {{nowrap|1=''s'' = 5}} and {{nowrap|1=''p'' = ''T''<sub>''B''</sub>/(''T''<sub>''A''</sub> + ''T''<sub>''B''</sub>) = 0.25}}, then\n: <math>S_\\text{latency} = \\frac 1 {1 - 0.25 + \\frac{0.25}{5}} = 1.25;</math>\n*if part ''A'' is made to run 2 times faster, that is {{nowrap|1=''s'' = 2}} and {{nowrap|1=''p'' = ''T''<sub>''A''</sub>/(''T''<sub>''A''</sub> + ''T''<sub>''B''</sub>) = 0.75}}, then\n: <math>S_\\text{latency} = \\frac 1 {1 - 0.75 + \\frac{0.75}{2}} = 1.60.</math>\n\nTherefore, making part ''A'' to run 2 times faster is better than making part ''B'' to run 5 times faster. The percentage improvement in speed can be calculated as\n: <math>\\text{percentage improvement} = 100 \\left(1 - \\frac 1 {S_\\text{latency}}\\right).</math>\n\n* Improving part ''A'' by a factor of 2 will increase overall program speed by a factor of 1.60, which makes it 37.5% faster than the original computation.\n* However, improving part ''B'' by a factor of 5, which presumably requires more effort, will achieve an overall speedup factor of 1.25 only, which makes it 20% faster.\n\n=== Optimizing the sequential part of parallel programs ===\n\nIf the non-parallelizable part is optimized by a factor of {{nowrap |<math> O </math>}}, then\n\n: <math>T(O,s) =  (1 - p)\\frac{T}{O} + \\frac{p}{s} T.</math>\n\nIt follows from Amdahl's law that the speedup due to parallelism is given by\n: <math>S_\\text{latency}(O,s) = \\frac{T(O)}{T(O,s)} = \\frac {(1 - p)\\frac{1}{O} + {p} } {\\frac{1 - p}{O} + \\frac p s}.</math>\n\nWhen <math>s=1</math>, we have <math>S_\\text{latency}(O,s)=1</math>, meaning that the speedup is\nmeasured with respect to the execution time after the non-parallelizable part is optimized.\n\nWhen  <math>s=\\infty</math>, \n: <math>S_\\text{latency}(O,\\infty) = \\frac{T(O)}{T(O,s)} = \\frac {(1 - p)\\frac{1}{O} + {p} } {\\frac{1 - p}{O} + \\frac p s}= 1 + \\frac{p}{1-p}O.</math>\n\nIf  <math>1-p=0.4</math>, <math>O=2</math> and <math>s=5</math>, then:\n\n: <math>S_\\text{latency}(O,s) = \\frac{T(O)}{T(O,s)} = \\frac{ {0.4} \\frac{1}{2} + 0.6} {\\frac{0.4}{2} + \\frac{0.6}{5} }   = 2.5.</math>\n\n=== Transforming sequential parts of parallel programs into parallelizable ===\n\nNext, we consider the case wherein the non-parallelizable part is reduced by a factor of {{nowrap |<math> O' </math>}}, and the parallelizable part is correspondingly increased. Then\n\n: <math>T'(O',s) =  (1 - p)\\frac{T}{O'} + \\left(1-\\frac{1-p}{O'}\\right) \\frac{T}{s}.</math>\n\nIt follows from Amdhal's law that the speedup due to parallelism is given by\n: <math>S'_\\text{latency}(O',s) = \\frac{T'(O')}{T'(O',s)} = \\frac { 1  } {  (1 - p)\\frac{1}{O'} + \\left(1-\\frac{1-p}{O'}\\right) \\frac{1}{s}}.</math>\n\nThe derivation above is in agreement with Jakob Jenkov's analysis of the execution time vs. speedup tradeoff.<ref>http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/amdahls-law.html</ref>\n\n== Relation to the law of diminishing returns ==\n\nAmdahl's law is often conflated with the [[law of diminishing returns]], whereas only a special case of applying Amdahl's law demonstrates law of diminishing returns. If one picks optimally (in terms of the achieved speedup) what to improve, then one will see monotonically decreasing improvements as one improves. If, however, one picks non-optimally, after improving a sub-optimal component and moving on to improve a more optimal component, one can see an increase in the return. Note that it is often rational to improve a system in an order that is \"non-optimal\" in this sense, given that some improvements are more difficult or require larger development time than others.\n\nAmdahl's law does represent the law of diminishing returns if on considering what sort of return one gets by adding more processors to a machine, if one is running a fixed-size computation that will use all available processors to their capacity. Each new processor added to the system will add less usable power than the previous one. Each time one doubles the number of processors the speedup ratio will diminish, as the total throughput heads toward the limit of 1/(1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p'').\n\nThis analysis neglects other potential bottlenecks such as [[memory bandwidth]] and I/O bandwidth. If these resources do not scale with the number of processors, then merely adding processors provides even lower returns.\n\nAn implication of Amdahl's law is that to speedup real applications which have both serial and parallel portions, [[heterogeneous computing]] techniques are required.<ref>\"Amdahl's Law in the Multicore Era\", Computer, 41 (7), 33\u201338, 2008 </ref> For example, a CPU-GPU heterogeneous processor may provide higher performance and energy efficiency than a CPU-only or GPU-only processor.<ref>\"[https://www.academia.edu/12355899/A_Survey_of_CPU-GPU_Heterogeneous_Computing_Techniques A Survey of CPU-GPU Heterogeneous Computing Techniques]\", ACM Computing Surveys, 47(4),  69:1\u201369:35, 2015 </ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Gustafson's law]]\n* [[Critical path method]]\n* [[Moore's law]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{cite journal\n| first = Gene M.\n| last = Amdahl\n| url = http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~n252/paper/Amdahl.pdf\n| doi=10.1145/1465482.1465560\n| title = Validity of the Single Processor Approach to Achieving Large-Scale Computing Capabilities\n| journal = AFIPS Conference Proceedings\n| issue = 30\n| pages = 483\u2013485\n| year = 1967\n| ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite journal\n| last = Rodgers\n| first = David P.\n| date = June 1985\n| url = https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=327215\n| title = Improvements in multiprocessor system design\n| journal = ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News\n| volume = 13\n| issue = 3\n| pages = 225\u2013231\n| issn = 0163-5964\n| publisher = [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]\n| location = New York, NY, USA\n| doi = 10.1145/327070.327215\n| ref=harv\n| isbn=0-8186-0634-7}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commonscat}}\n\n* {{Webarchive\n| url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508130755/http://www.futurechips.org/thoughts-for-researchers/parallel-programming-gene-amdahl-said.html\n| title=Parallel Programming: When Amdahl\u2019s law is inapplicable?\n| date=2017-05-08}}\n\n* [https://hdl.handle.net/11299/104341 Oral history interview with Gene M.

Beat writer [[William S. Burroughs]] read a paper by [[Richard Evans Schultes]] on the subject and while traveling through South America in the early 1950s sought out ayahuasca in the hopes that it could relieve or cure [[opiate]] [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] (see ''[[The Yage Letters]]''). Ayahuasca became more widely known when the McKenna brothers published their experience in the Amazon in ''True Hallucinations''.  [[Dennis McKenna]] later studied pharmacology, [[botany]], and [[chemistry]] of ayahuasca and [[oo-koo-he]], which became the subject of his master's thesis.\n\n[[Richard Evans Schultes]] allowed for [[Claudio Naranjo]] to make a special journey by canoe up the Amazon River to study ayahuasca with the South American Indians. He brought back samples of the beverage and published the first scientific description of the effects of its active alkaloids.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naranjo|first1=Claudio|title=The Healing Journey|publisher=Pantheon Books|isbn=9780394488264|pages=X}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Brazil]], a number of modern religious movements based on the use of ayahuasca have emerged, the most famous of them being [[Santo Daime]] and the [[Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal]] (or UDV), usually in an [[Spiritism|animistic]] context that may be shamanistic or, more often (as with Santo Daime and the UDV), integrated with [[Christianity]]. Both Santo Daime and Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal now have members and churches throughout the world.

When used for its medicinal purposes, ayahuasca affects the human consciousness for less than six hours, beginning half an hour after consumption and peaking after two hours.

A legal case was filed against two of the Church's leaders, [[Hans Bogers]] (one of the original founders of the Dutch Santo Daime community) and [[Geraldine Fijneman]] (the head of the [[Amsterdam]] Santo Daime community). Bogers and Fijneman were charged with distributing a [[controlled substance]] (DMT); however, the prosecution was unable to prove that the use of ayahuasca by members of the Santo Daime constituted a sufficient threat to public health and order such that it warranted denying their rights to [[religious freedom]] under [[ECHR#Article 9 - conscience and religion|ECHR Article 9]]. The 2001 verdict of the Amsterdam district court is an important precedent. Since then groups that are not affiliated to the Santo Daime have used ayahuasca, and a number of different \"styles\" have been developed, including non-religious approaches.\n\n=== Ayahuasca analogues ===\n[[File:Syrian Rue Seeds.jpg|thumb|right|[[Syrian rue]] seeds can be used to provide a MAOI]]\nIn modern Europe and North America, ayahuasca analogs are often prepared using non-traditional plants which contain the same alkaloids. For example, seeds of the Syrian rue plant can be used as a substitute for the ayahuasca vine, and the DMT-rich ''[[Mimosa hostilis]]'' is used in place of ''[[chacruna]]''. Australia has several indigenous plants which are popular among modern ayahuasqueros there, such as various DMT-rich species of ''[[Acacia]]''.\n\nThe name \"ayahuasca\" specifically refers to a botanical decoction that contains ''Banisteriopsis caapi''. A synthetic version, known as [[pharmahuasca]], is a combination of an appropriate MAOI and typically DMT. In this usage, the DMT is generally considered the main psychoactive active ingredient, while the MAOI merely preserves the psychoactivity of orally ingested DMT, which would otherwise be destroyed in the gut before it could be absorbed in the body. In contrast, traditionally among Amazonian tribes, the ''B. Caapi'' vine is considered to be the \"spirit\" of ayahuasca, the gatekeeper, and guide to the otherworldly realms.<ref>{{citation |url=http://ayahuasca-recipe.com/ayahuasca-espana-dmt-molecula-dio-espiritual/ |title=Ayahuasca DMT La Molecula Dios |publisher=Ayahuasca-Recipe.com |date=2017-07-29 |accessdate=2017-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=July 31, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731120620/http://ayahuasca-recipe.com/ayahuasca-espana-dmt-molecula-dio-espiritual/ |df= }}</ref>\n\nBrews similar to ayahuasca may be prepared using several plants not traditionally used in South America:\n\nDMT admixtures:\n* ''[[Acacia maidenii]]'' (Maiden's wattle) \u2013 bark *not all plants are \"active strains\",  meaning some plants will have very little DMT and others larger amounts\n* ''[[Acacia phlebophylla]]'', and other [[Acacia]]s, most commonly employed in [[Australia]] \u2013 bark\n* ''[[Acacia obtusifolia]]'' Has a similar range to ''Acacia maidenii'' \u2013 bark\n* ''[[Anadenanthera peregrina]]'', ''A. colubrina, A. excelsa, A. macrocarpa''\n\nMAOI admixtures:\n* [[Harmal]] (''Peganum harmala'', Syrian rue) \u2013 seeds\n* [[Passion flower]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/calming-effects-of-passionflower|title=The Calming Effects of Passionflower|work=Healthline|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} \n* [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#List of MAOIs|synthetic MAOIs]], especially [[Reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A|RIMAs]]\n\n== Chemistry and pharmacology ==\n[[File:Harmine structure.svg|right|thumb|Molecular structure of [[harmine]]]]\n[[File:Harmaline structure.svg|right|thumb|Molecular structure of [[harmaline]]]]\n[[File:Tetrahydroharmine structure.svg|right|thumb|Molecular structure of [[tetrahydroharmine]]]]\n[[Harmala alkaloid]]s are MAO-inhibiting [[beta-Carboline|''beta''-carboline]]s. The three most studied harmala alkaloids in the ''B. caapi'' vine are [[harmine]], [[harmaline]] and [[tetrahydroharmine]]. Harmine and harmaline are [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#Selectivity|selective]] and [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#Reversibility|reversible]] inhibitors of [[monoamine oxidase A]] (MAO-A), while tetrahydroharmine is a weak [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SRI).<ref name=\"Pharmacokinetics\"/>\n\nThis inhibition of MAO-A allows [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] to diffuse unmetabolized past the membranes in the stomach and small intestine, and eventually cross the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]] (which, by itself, requires no MAO-A inhibition) to activate receptor sites in the brain. Without [[Reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A|RIMA]]s or the non-selective, nonreversible monoamine oxidase inhibition by drugs like [[phenelzine]] and [[tranylcypromine]], DMT would be oxidized (and thus rendered biologically inactive) by monoamine oxidase enzymes in the digestive tract.<ref name=\"RIBA, J 2003\">RIBA, J.

For example, the higher dispersion [[flint glass]]es have ''V''&nbsp;<&nbsp;55 whereas the lower dispersion [[crown glass (optics)|crown glass]]es have larger Abbe numbers.

For different wavelength regions, or for higher precision in characterizing a system's chromaticity (such as in the design of [[apochromat]]s), the full dispersion relation (refractive index as a function of wavelength) is used.\n\n== Abbe diagram ==\n[[Image:Abbe-diagram 2.svg|right|thumb|380px|An Abbe diagram, also known as 'the glass veil',  plots the Abbe number against refractive index for a range of different glasses (red dots).

Glasses can then be categorised and selected according to their positions on the diagram. This can be a letter-number code, as used in the [[Schott Glass]] catalogue, or a 6-digit [[glass code]].\n\nGlasses' Abbe numbers, along with their mean refractive indices, are used in the calculation of the required [[refractive power]]s of the elements of [[achromatic lenses]] in order to cancel [[chromatic aberration]] to first order. Note that these two parameters which enter into the equations for design of achromatic doublets are exactly what is plotted on an Abbe diagram.\n\nDue to the difficulty and inconvenience in producing sodium and hydrogen lines, alternate definitions of the Abbe number are often substituted ([[ISO]] 7944).<ref>{{cite web|last=Meister|first=Darryl|title=Understanding Reference Wavelengths|url=http://www.opticampus.com/files/memo_on_reference_wavelengths.pdf|publisher=Carl Zeiss Vision|accessdate=2013-03-13}}</ref> Rather than the standard definition, above, using the refractive index variation between the F and C [[Fraunhofer lines#Naming|hydrogen lines]], an alternative measure using the subscript \"e\"\n:<math> V_e = \\frac{n_e-1}{ n_{F'} - n_{C'}}</math>\ntakes the difference between the refractive indices of the blue and red cadmium lines at 480.0&nbsp;nm and 643.8&nbsp;nm (with ''n<sub>e</sub>'' referring to the wavelength of the  mercury e-line, 546.073&nbsp;nm).

The word \"ablative\" derives from the [[Latin]] ''ablatus'', the (irregular) perfect passive participle of ''auferre'' \"to carry away\".<ref name=\"latindict\">[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/101/ablative3.pdf The Ablative] , The Latin Library, accessed 06-01-14</ref> There is no ablative case in modern [[Germanic languages]] such as [[German language|German]], nor in ancient Greek.\n\n==Indo-European languages==\n\n===Latin===\n{{Main|Ablative (Latin)}}\n\nThe ablative case in [[Latin]] (''casus ablativus'') appears in various grammatical constructions, including following various prepositions, in an [[Latin grammar#Ablative absolute|ablative absolute]] clause, and adverbially. The Latin ablative case was derived<ref>https://org.uib.no/iecastp/IECASTP/CaseInDecline.pdf Case In Decline pg.1</ref> from three [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] cases: ablative (from), instrumental (with), and locative (in/at).\n\n===Greek===\nIn [[Ancient Greek]], there was no ablative case; some of its functions were taken by the [[genitive case|genitive]] and others by the dative; the genitive had functions belonging to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] genitive and ablative cases.<ref>[[Herbert Weir Smyth]]. ''Greek Grammar''. par. 1279: composite or mixed cases.</ref> The genitive case with the prepositions \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc ''ap\u00f3'' \"away from\" and \u1f10\u03ba/\u1f10\u03be ''ek/ex'' \"out of\" is an example.\n\n===German===\n[[German language|German]] does not have an ablative case (but exceptionally, Latin ablative case-forms were used from the 17th to the 19th century after some [[preposition and postposition|prepositions]], for example after ''von'' in ''von dem Nomine'': ablative of the Latin loanword ''Nomen''). Grammarians at that time, such as [[Justus Georg Schottel]], [[Kaspar von Stieler]] (\"der Spate\"), Johann Balthasar von Antesperg and [[Johann Christoph Gottsched]], listed an ablative case (as the sixth case after nominative, genitive, dative, accusative and vocative) for German words. They arbitrarily considered the dative case after some prepositions to be an ablative, as in ''von dem Mann[e]'' (\"from the man\" or \"of the man\") and ''mit dem Mann[e]'' (\"with the man\"), while they considered the dative case after other prepositions or without a preposition as ''dem Mann[e]'' to be a dative.\n\nThere is some confusion in German culture about the Latin ablative and the German dative.\n\n===Serbo-Croatian===\nAs in Ancient Greek, the functions of the ablative case in the Serbo-Croatian language are performed by the genitive case. Of the three forms of genitive in [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] (partitive, possessive and ablative), the noun in the ablative genitive marks the origin of something: departure or detachment from it.\n\n===Albanian===\nThe ablative case is found in [[Albanian language|Albanian]]; it is the fifth case, ''rasa rjedhore''.\n\n===Sanskrit===\nIn [[Sanskrit]], the ablative case is the fifth case (''pa\u00f1cam\u012b'') and has a similar function to that in Latin. It is bound up with a special semantic condition, ''ap\u0101d\u0101na'' (\u0905\u092a\u093e\u0926\u093e\u0928) in [[Sanskrit]]. In fact, the fifth case (ablative) is the typical morphological realization of ''ap\u0101d\u0101na'' ([[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] 2.3.28).\n\nSanskrit nouns in this case often refer to a subject \"out of\" which or \"from\" whom something (an action, an object) has arisen or occurred: ''patram '''v\u1e5bk\u1e63\u0101t''' patati'' \"the leaf falls '''from the tree'''\".\n\nIt is also used for nouns in several other senses, as for actions occurring \"because of\" or \"without\" a certain noun, indicating distance or direction. When it appears with a comparative adjective, (''\u015bre\u1e63\u1e6dhatamam,'' \"the best\"), the ablative is used to refer to what the adjective is comparing: \"better than X\".\n\n===Armenian===\nThe modern [[Armenian language|Armenian]] ablative has different markers for each main dialect, both originating from [[Classical Armenian]]. The [[Western Armenian]] affix -\u0567 ''-\u0113'' (definite -\u0567\u0576 ''-\u0113n'') derives from the classical singular; the [[Eastern Armenian]] affix -\u056b\u0581 ''-ic\u2019'' (both indefinite and definite) derives from the classical plural.

It is an outer locative case, used like the [[adessive]] and [[allative]] cases, to denote both being on top of something and \"being around the place\" (as opposed to the inner locative case, the [[elative case|elative]], which means \"from out of\" or \"from the inside of\"). With the locative, the receding object was near the other place or object, not inside it.\n\nThe Finnish ablative is also used in time expressions to indicate start times (''kymmenelt\u00e4'' \"at ten\") as well as with verbs expressing feelings or emotions.\n\nThe Finnish ablative has the ending ''-lta'' or ''-lt\u00e4'', depending on [[vowel harmony]].\n\n====Usage====\n\n; away from a place:\n\n*''katolta'': off the roof\n*''p\u00f6yd\u00e4lt\u00e4'': off the table\n*''rannalta'': from the beach\n*''maalta'': from the land\n*''merelt\u00e4'': from the sea\n\n; with the verb ''l\u00e4hte\u00e4'' (stop):\n\n*''l\u00e4hte\u00e4 tupakalta'': stop smoking (in the sense of putting out the cigarette one is smoking now, lit.

For example, one walking away from a friend who gave him a gift could say the following: \n\n:''a bar\u00e1tom'''t\u00f3l''' j\u00f6v\u00f6k''(I am coming (away) from my friend).\n:''a bar\u00e1tom'''t\u00f3l''' kaptam egy aj\u00e1nd\u00e9kot''(I got a gift from my friend).\n\nWhen used to describe movement away from a location, the case may only refer to movement from ''the general vicnity'' of the location and not from inside of it. Thus, ''a post\u00e1t\u00f3l j\u00f6v\u00f6k'' would mean one had been standing ''next to'' the post office before, not inside the building.\n\nWhen the case is used to refer to the origin of a possible act or event, the act/event may be implied while not explicitly stated, such as ''Meg foglak v\u00e9deni a rabl\u00f3'''t\u00f3l''''': I will defend you from the robber. \n\nThe application of [[vowel harmony]] gives two different suffixes: ''-t\u00f3l'' and ''-t\u0151l''. These are applied to back-vowel and front-vowel words, respectively.\n\n==Turkic languages==\n\n===Azerbaijani===\n\nThe ablative in [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] (''{{Lang|az|\u00e7\u0131x\u0131\u015fl\u0131q hal}}'') is expressed through the suffixes ''-dan'' or ''-d\u0259n'':\n\nEv \u2013 ev'''d\u0259n'''\n<br>''House \u2013 from/off the house''\n\nAparmaq \u2013 aparmaq'''dan'''\n<br>''To carry \u2013 from/off carrying''\n\n===Turkish===\nThe ablative in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (''-den hali'' or ''ayr\u0131lma hali'') is expressed through the suffixes ''-den'', ''-dan'', ''-ten'' or ''-tan'':\n\nEv \u2013 ev'''den'''\n<br>''House \u2013 from/off the house''\n\nAt \u2013 at'''tan'''\n<br>''Horse \u2013 from/off the horse''\n\nTa\u015f\u0131mak \u2013 ta\u015f\u0131mak'''tan'''\n<br>''To carry \u2013 from/off carrying''\n\nSes \u2013 ses'''ten'''\n<br>''Sound/volume \u2013 from/off sound/volume''\n\nIn some situations simple ablative can have a \"because of\" meaning, in these situations ablative can be optionally followed by \"dolay\u0131\" (because of) preposition.\n\nY\u00fcksek sesten (dolay\u0131) rahats\u0131z oldum. /  ''I was uneasy because of high volume.

By contrast, [[Kabbalism]] assumed an \"eternal Torah\" which was not identical to the Torah written in Hebrew. Thus, [[Abulafia]]{{which|date=July 2016}} in the 13th century assumed that the language spoken in Paradise had been different from Hebrew, and rejected the claim then current also among Christian authors, that a child left unexposed to linguistic stimulus would automatically begin to speak in Hebrew.<ref>Umberto Eco, ''The Search for the Perfect Language'' (1993), p. 32 f.</ref>\n\n[[Umberto Eco]] (1993) notes that Genesis is ambiguous on whether the language of Adam was preserved by Adam's descendants until the [[confusion of tongues]] (Genesis 11:1\u20139), or if it began to evolve naturally even before Babel (Genesis 10:5).<ref>Umberto Eco, ''The Search for the Perfect Language'' (1993), 7\u201310.</ref>\n\n[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] addresses the topic in his ''[[De Vulgari Eloquentia]]''.

Dante concludes (''Paradiso'' XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of Adam. In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, ''[[El (god)|El]]'', must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which Dante gives as ''[[Close front unrounded vowel|I]]''.<ref>''Paradiso'' 26.133f.; Mazzocco, p. 178f.</ref>\n\n== Early modern period ==\n=== Proponents ===\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2018}}\nElizabethan scholar [[John Dee]] makes references to an [[occult]] or angelic language recorded in his private journals and those of [[spirit medium]] [[Edward Kelley]]. Dee's journals did not describe the language as \"[[Enochian]]\", instead preferring \"Angelical\", the \"Celestial Speech\", the \"Language of Angels\", the \"First Language of God-Christ\", the \"Holy Language\", or \"Adamical\" because, according to Dee's Angels, it was used by Adam in Paradise to name all things. The language was later dubbed Enochian, due to Dee's assertion that the [[Biblical Patriarch]] [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] had been the last human (before Dee and Kelley) to know the language.\n\nDutch physician, linguist, and humanist [[Johannes Goropius Becanus]] (1519\u20131572) theorized in ''Origines Antwerpianae'' (1569) that [[Antwerp]]ian [[Brabantic]], spoken in the region between the [[Scheldt]] and [[Meuse]] Rivers, was the original language spoken in Paradise. Goropius believed that the most ancient language on Earth would be the simplest language, and that the simplest language would contain mostly short words.

It was first performed on 9 March [[1930 in music#Opera|1930]] at the {{Lang|de|[[Neues Theater (Leipzig)|Neues Theater]]|italic=no}} in Leipzig.\n\n==Composition history==\nThe libretto was mainly written in early 1927 and the music was finished in the spring of 1929, although both text and music were partly revised by the authors later. An early by-product, however, was the ''[[Mahagonny-Songspiel]]'', sometimes known as ''Das kleine Mahagonny'', a concert work for voices and small orchestra commissioned by the Deutsche Kammermusik Festival in [[Baden-Baden]] and premiered there on 18 July 1927. The ten numbers, which include the \"Alabama Song\" and \"Benares Song\", were duly incorporated into the full opera. The opera had its premiere in Leipzig in March 1930 and played in Berlin in December of the following year. The opera was banned by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in 1933 and did not have a significant production until the 1960s.\n\nWeill's score uses a number of styles, including [[ragtime|rag-time]], [[jazz]] and formal [[counterpoint]], notably in the \"[[Alabama Song]]\" (covered by multiple artists, notably [[Ute Lemper]], [[The Doors]] and [[David Bowie]]).\n\n==Language==\nThe lyrics for the \"Alabama Song\" and another song, the \"Benares Song\" are in English (albeit specifically [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] English) and are performed in that language even when the opera is performed in its original ([[German language|German]]) language. The name of the city itself is a mix between the English and German word for [[mahogany]], \"Mahagoni\".\n\n==Performance history==\nIt has played in opera houses around the world. Never achieving the popularity of Weill and Brecht's ''[[The Threepenny Opera]],'' ''Mahagonny'' is still considered a work of stature with a haunting score. Herbert Lindenberger in his book ''Opera in History'', for example, views ''Mahagonny'' alongside Schoenberg's ''[[Moses und Aron]]'' as indicative of the two poles of modernist opera.\n\nFollowing the Leipzig premiere, the opera was presented in Berlin in December 1931 at the [[Theater am Schiffbauerdamm]] conducted by [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]] with [[Lotte Lenya]] as Jenny, Trude Hesterberg as Begbick, and Harald Paulsen as Jimmy. Another production was presented in January 1934 in Copenhagen at the Det ny Teater. Other productions within Europe waited until the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], some notable ones being in January 1963 in London at [[Sadler's Wells Opera]] conducted by [[Colin Davis]] and in Berlin in September 1977 by the [[Komische Oper Berlin|Komische Oper]].\n\nIt was not presented in the United States until 1970, when a short-lived April production at the Phyllis Anderson Theatre off Broadway starred [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as Jenny, [[Frank Porretta]] as Jimmy, and [[Estelle Parsons]] as Begbick.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2sZLVpH_jwC&pg=PA129|title=Off-Broadway Musicals since 1919: From Greenwich Village Follies to The Toxic Avenger|author=Thomas S.

[[Kurt Kasznar]] played Moses. The libretto was performed in an original translation by Michael Feingold; the production was directed by Alvin Epstein. In October 1978, Yale presented a \"chamber version\" adapted and directed by Keith Hack, with [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]] as Jimmy and [[June Gable]] as Begbick. [[Mark Lynn-Baker]] played Fatty; [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]] was Trinity Moses. In November 1979, ''Mahagonny'' debuted at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in a [[John Dexter]] production conducted by [[James Levine]]. The cast included [[Teresa Stratas]] as Jenny, [[Astrid Varnay]] as Begbick, [[Richard Cassilly]] as Jimmy, [[Cornell MacNeil]] as Moses, [[Ragnar Ulfung]] as Fatty and [[Paul Plishka]] as Joe. The production was televised in 1979 and was released on DVD in 2010.\n\nThe [[Los Angeles Opera]] presented the opera in September 1989 under conductor [[Kent Nagano]] and with a [[Jonathan Miller]] production. Other notable productions in Europe from the 1980s included the March 1986 presentation by the [[Scottish Opera]] in Glasgow; a June 1990 production in Florence by the [[Maggio Musicale Fiorentino]]. In October 1995 and 1997, the [[Paris Opera]] staged by [[Graham Vick]], under the baton of [[Jeffrey Tate]] starring [[Marie McLaughlin]] as Jenny, [[Felicity Palmer]] (1995) and Kathryn Harries (1997) as Begbick, and Kim Begley (1995)/Peter Straka (1997) as Jimmy. \n\nThe July 1998 [[Salzburg Festival]] production featured [[Catherine Malfitano]] as Jenny, [[Gwyneth Jones (soprano)|Gwyneth Jones]] as Begbick, and [[Jerry Hadley]] as Jimmy. The [[Vienna State Opera]] added it to its repertoire in January 2012 in a production by [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Deschamps]] conducted by [[Ingo Metzmacher]] starring [[Christopher Ventris]] as Jimmy and [[Angelika Kirchschlager]] as Jenny, notably casting young mezzo-soprano [[Elisabeth Kulman]] as Begbick, breaking the tradition of having a veteran soprano (like Varnay or Jones) or musical theater singer (like [[Patti LuPone]]) perform the role.\n\nProductions within the US have included those in November 1998 by the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] directed by [[David Alden]]. Catherine Malfitano repeated her role as Jenny, while [[Felicity Palmer]] sang Begbick, and Kim Begley sang the role of Jimmy. The Los Angeles Opera's February 2007 production directed by [[John Doyle (director)|John Doyle]] and conducted by [[James Conlon]] included [[Audra McDonald]] as Jenny, [[Patti LuPone]] as Begbick, and [[Anthony Dean Griffey]] as Jimmy.

Three fugitives from justice get out and find themselves in the city of Mahagonny: Fatty the Bookkeeper, Trinity Moses, and Leocadia Begbick. Because the federal agents pursuing them will not search this far north, and they are in a good location to attract ships coming south from the Alaskan gold fields, Begbick decides that they can profit by staying where they are and founding a pleasure city, where men can have fun, because there is nothing else in the world to rely on.\n\n{{listen|type=music|filename=Mahagonny Alabama Song.ogg|title=Alabama Song|description=Excerpt from the \"[[Alabama Song]]\" as sung in act 1, scene 2}}\n''Scene 2''\n\nThe news of Mahagonny spreads quickly, and sharks from all over flock to the bait, including the whore Jenny Smith, who is seen, with six other girls, singing the \"[[Alabama Song]]\", in which she waves goodbye to her home and sets out in pursuit of whiskey, dollars and pretty boys.\n\n''Scene 3''\n\nIn the big cities, where men lead boring, purposeless lives, Fatty and Moses spread the gospel of Mahagonny, city of gold, among the disillusioned.\n\n''Scene 4''\n\nFour Alaskan Lumberjacks who have shared hard times together in the timberlands and made their fortunes set off together for Mahagonny. Jimmy Mahoney and his three friends&nbsp;\u2013 Jacob Schmidt, Bank Account Billy, and Alaska Wolf Joe&nbsp;\u2013 sing of the pleasures awaiting them in \"Off to Mahagonny\", and look forward to the peace and pleasure they will find there.\n\n''Scene 5''\n\nThe four friends arrive in Mahagonny, only to find other disappointed travelers already leaving. Begbick, well-informed about their personal tastes, marks down her prices, but for the penurious Billy they still seem too high. Jimmy impatiently calls for the girls of Mahagonny to show themselves, so he can make a choice. Begbick suggests Jenny as the right girl for Jack, who finds her rates too high. She pleads with Jack to reconsider (\"Havana Song\"), which arouses Jim's interest, and he chooses her. Jenny and the girls sing a tribute to \"the Jimmys from Alaska.\"\n\n''Scene 6''\n\nJimmy and Jenny get to know one another as she asks him to define the terms of their contact: Does he wish her to wear her hair up or down, to wear fancy underwear or none at all? \"What is your wish?\" asks Jim, but Jenny evades answering.\n\n''Scene 7''\n\nBegbick, Fatty and Moses meet to discuss the pleasure city's financial crisis: People are leaving in droves, and the price of whiskey is sinking rapidly. Begbick suggests going back to civilization, but Fatty reminds her that the federal agents have been inquiring for her in nearby Pensacola. Money would solve everything, declares Begbick, and she decides to soak the four new arrivals for all they've got.\n\n''Scene 8''\n\nJimmy, restless, attempts to leave Mahagonny, because he misses the wife he left in Alaska.\n\n''Scene 9''\n\nIn front of the Rich Man's Hotel, Jimmy and the others sit lazily as a pianist plays [[Tekla B\u0105darzewska-Baranowska|Tekla B\u0105darzewska]]'s \"A Maiden's Prayer\". With growing anger, Jimmy sings of how his hard work and suffering in Alaska have led only to this. Drawing a knife, he shouts for Begbick, while his friends try to disarm him and the other men call to have him thrown out. Calm again, he tells Begbick that Mahagonny can never make people happy: it has too much peace and quiet.\n\n''Scene 10''\n\nAs if in answer to Jimmy's complaint, the city is threatened by a typhoon. Everyone sings in horror of the destruction awaiting them.\n\n''Scene 11''\n\nTensely, people watch for the hurricane's arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition not to be afraid. Jim meditatively compares Nature's savagery to the far greater destructiveness of Man. Why do we build, he asks, if not for the pleasure of destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no sense. For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick\u2019s enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts take it as a sign that Jimmy is right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks over someone else, then it's me, and if someone gets walked on, then it's you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.\n\n===Act 2===\n''Scene 12''\n\nMagically, the hurricane bypasses Mahagonny, and the people sing in awe of their miraculous rescue. This confirms Begbick's belief in the philosophy of \"Do what you want,\" and she proceeds to put it into effect.\n\n{{listen|type=music|filename=Mahagonny Act2scene13.ogg|title=Jacob Schmidt's departure|description=Jacob Schmidt is gorging himself on food and is about to die in act 2, scene 13}}\n''Scene 13 At the renovated \"Do It\" tavern.''\n\nThe men sing of the four pleasures of life: Eating, Lovemaking, Fighting and Drinking. First comes eating: To kitschy cafe music, Jimmy's friend Jacob gorges until he keels over and dies. The men sing a chorale over his body, saluting \"a man without fear\".\n\n''Scene 14: Loving.''\n\nWhile Begbick collects money and issues tips on behavior, Moses placates the impatient men queuing to make love to Jenny and the other whores. The men sing the \"Mandalay Song\", warning that love does not last forever, and urging those ahead of them to make it snappy.\n\n''Scene 15: Fighting.''\n\nThe men flock to see a boxing match between Trinity Moses and Jim's friend Alaska Wolf Joe. While most of the men, including the ever-cautious Billy, bet on the burly Moses, Jim, out of friendship, bets heavily on Joe. The match is manifestly unfair; Moses not only wins but kills Joe in knocking him out.\n\n''Scene 16: Drinking.''\n\nIn an effort to shake off the gloom of Joe's death, Jimmy invites everyone to have a drink on him. The men sing \"Life in Mahagonny\", describing how one could live in the city for only five dollars a day, but those who wanted to have fun always needed more. Jim, increasingly drunk, dreams of sailing back to Alaska. He takes down a curtain rod for a mast and climbs on the pool table, pretending it is a ship; Jenny and Billy play along. Jimmy is abruptly sobered up when Begbick demands payment for the whiskey as well as for the damage to her property. Totally broke, he turns in a panic to Jenny, who explains her refusal to help him out in the song \"Make your own bed\"&nbsp;\u2013 an adaptation of the ideas he proclaimed at the end of act 1. Jim is led off in chains as the chorus, singing another stanza of \"Life in Mahagonny\", returns to its pastimes. Trinity Moses assures the crowd that Jimmy will pay for his crimes with his life.\n\n''Scene 17''\n\nAt night, Jim alone and chained to a lamppost, sings a plea for the sun not to rise on the day of his impending trial.\n\n===Act 3===\n\n''Scene 18: In the courtroom''\n\nMoses, like a carnival barker, sells tickets to the trials. He serves as prosecutor, Fatty as defense attorney, Begbick as judge. First comes the case of Toby Higgins, accused of premeditated murder for the purpose of testing an old revolver. Fatty invites the injured party to rise, but no one does so, since the dead do not speak. Toby bribes all three, and as a result, Begbick dismisses the case. Next Jimmy's case is called. Chained, he is led in by Billy, from whom he tries to borrow money; Billy of course refuses, despite Jim's plea to remember their time together in Alaska. In virtually the same speech he used to attack Higgins, Moses excoriates him for not paying his bills, for seducing Jenny (who presents herself as a plaintiff) to commit a \"carnal act\" with him for money, and for inciting the crowd with \"an illegal joyous song\" on the night of the typhoon. Billy, with the chorus's support, counters that, in committing the latter act, Jimmy discovered the laws by which Mahagonny lives. Moses argues that Jim hastened his friend Joe's death in a prizefight by betting on him, and Billy counters by asking who actually killed Joe. Moses does not reply. But there is no answer for the main count against him. Jim gets short sentences for his lesser crimes, but for having no money, he is sentenced to death. Begbick, Fatty and Moses, rising to identify themselves as the injured parties, proclaim \"in the whole human race / there is no greater criminal / than a man without money\". As Jim is led off to await execution, everyone sings the \"Benares Song\", in which they long for that exotic city \"where the sun is shining.\" But Benares has been destroyed by an earthquake. \"Where shall we go?\" they ask.\n\n''Scene 19: At the gallows''\n\nJim says a tender goodbye to Jenny, who, dressed in white, declares herself his widow. He surrenders her to Billy, his last remaining companion from Alaska. When he tries to delay the execution by reminding the people of Mahagonny that God exists, they play out for him, under Moses' direction, the story of \"God in Mahagonny\", in which the Almighty condemns the town and is overthrown by its citizens, who declare that they can not be sent to Hell because they are already in Hell. Jim, chastened, asks only for a glass of water, but is refused even this as Moses gives the signal for the trap to be sprung.\n\n''Scene 20''\n\nA caption advises that, after Jim's death, increasing hostility among the city's various factions has caused the destruction of Mahagonny. To a potpourri of themes from earlier in the opera, groups of protesters are seen on the march, in conflict with one another, while the city burns in the background. Jenny and the whores carry Jim's clothing and accessories like sacred relics; Billy and several men carry his coffin. In a new theme, they and the others declare, \"Nothing you can do will help a dead man\". Begbick, Fatty and Moses appear with placards of their own, joining the entire company in its march and declaring \"Nothing will help him or us or you now,\" as the opera ends in chaos.\n\n==Musical numbers==\n\n===Act 1===\n* Scene 1: ''Gesucht werden Leokadja Begbick'' (\"The Desired Progress of Leocadia Begbick\")\n* Scene 1: ''Sie soll sein wie ein Netz'' (\"It Should Be Made Like a Net\")\n* Scene 2: ''Rasch wuchs'' (\"Growing Up Quickly\" ) / [[Moon of Alabama]] (\"Oh, Show Us The Way...\")\n* Scene 3: ''Die Nachricht'' (\"The News\")\n* Scene 4: ''In den n\u00e4chsten Tagen'' (\"In the Next Few Days\")\n* Scene 5: ''Damals kam unter Anderen'' (\"Among the Crowd There Came\")\n* Scene 5: ''Heraus, ihr Sch\u00f6nen von Mahagonny'' (\"Come Out, You Beauties of Mahagonny\")\n* Scene 5: ''Ach, bedenken Sie'' (\"Oh Worries\")\n* Scene 6: ''Ich habe gelernt'' (\"I Have Learned\")\n* Scene 7: ''Alle gro\u00dfen Unternehmungen'' (\"All Great Things\")\n* Scene 7: ''Auch ich bin einmal'' (\"Also I Was Once\")\n* Scene 8: ''Alle wahrhaft Suchenden'' (\"All Seekers of the Truth\")\n* Scene 8: ''Aber etwas fehlt'' (\"But Something is Missing\")\n* Scene 9: ''Das ist die ewige Kunst'' (\"That is the Eternal Art\")\n* Scene 9: ''Sieben Jahre'' (\"Seven Years!\")\n* Scene 10: ''Ein Taifun!''

The most notable of these is the threat of a hurricane approaching the city during the first act. Von Trier's earlier movie ''[[Dogville]]'', to which Manderlay is a sequel, was for a large part based on a song from Brecht's ''[[Threepenny Opera]]'' (\"[[Pirate Jenny]]\"). In the brothel scene in act 2 of ''Mahagonny'', the choir sings a \"Song von Mandelay\". The play ''[[Happy End (musical)|Happy End]]'' (1929) by [[Elisabeth Hauptmann]], Brecht and Weill, also contains a song called \"Der Song von Mandelay\", which uses the same refrain as in the brothel scene of ''Mahagonny''. Brecht's use of the name Mandelay/Mandalay was inspired by [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem \"[[Mandalay (poem)|Mandalay]]\".\n\n==Recordings==\n*''Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny''.

He had four plays running simultaneously on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1920.\n\n==Early life==\nHopwood was born to James and Jule Hopwood on May 28, 1882, in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sharrar|1998|pp=8\u20139}}</ref> He graduated from Cleveland's [[West High School (Cleveland)|West High School]] in 1900.<ref>{{harvnb|Sharrar|1998|p=1}}</ref> In 1901, he began attending the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor]]. However, his family experienced financial difficulties, so for his sophomore year he transferred to [[Adelbert College]]. He returned to the University of Michigan in the fall of 1903, and graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1905.<ref>{{harvnb|Sharrar|1998|pp=12\u201317}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHopwood started out as a journalist for a Cleveland newspaper as its New York correspondent, but within a year had a play, ''Clothes'' (1906), produced on Broadway. He became known as \"The Playboy Playwright\"<ref name=imdbbio>Jim Beaver [http://imdb.com/name/nm0394479/bio Biography for Avery Hopwood] at [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> and specialized in comedies and farces, some of them with material considered risqu\u00e9  at the time.  One play, ''[[The Demi-Virgin]]'' in 1921, prompted a court case because of its suggestive subject matter, including a risque game of cards, \"Stripping Cupid\", where a bevy of showgirls teased the audience in their lingerie.  The case was dismissed.\n\nHis many plays included ''Nobody's Widow'' (1910), starring Blanche Bates; ''[[Fair and Warmer]]'' (1915), starring Madge Kennedy (filmed in 1919); ''[[The Gold Diggers (play)|The Gold Diggers]]'' (1919), starring Ina Claire (filmed in 1923 as ''[[The Gold Diggers (1923 film)|The Gold Diggers]]'', in 1928 as ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'' and also as ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]''); ''[[Ladies' Night (play)|Ladies' Night]]'', 1920, starring [[Charlie Ruggles]] (filmed in 1928); the famous mystery play ''[[The Bat (play)|The Bat]]'' (with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]), 1920 (filmed in 1926 as ''[[The Bat (1926 film)|The Bat]]'', in 1930 as ''[[The Bat Whispers]],'' and in 1959 as ''[[The Bat (1959 film)|The Bat]]''); ''[[Getting Gertie's Garter (play)|Getting Gertie's Garter]]'' (with [[Wilson Collison]]), 1921, starring [[Hazel Dawn]] (filmed in 1927 and 1945); ''[[The Demi-Virgin]]'', 1921, also starring Dawn; ''The Alarm Clock'', 1923; ''The Best People'' (with David Gray), 1924 (filmed in [[The Best People|1925]] and as ''[[Fast and Loose (1930 film)|Fast and Loose]]'' in 1930), the song-farce ''Naughty Cinderella'', 1925, starring [[Irene Bordoni]] and ''The Garden of Eden'' in 1927 (filmed in 1928 as ''[[The Garden of Eden (1928 film)|The Garden of Eden]]'').\n\nHopwood was asked to write the third act of Mary Roberts Rinehart's play ''The Bat''.<ref name=\"University of Pittsburgh press\">{{cite book|last1=Cohn|first1=Jan|title=Improbable Fiction: The Life of Mary Roberts Rinehart|date=1980|publisher=University of Pittsburgh press|page=138}}</ref> Hopwood collaborated with Rinehart to then work on the last act of the play in Sewickley and sometimes in New York.<ref name=\"University of Pittsburgh press\"/>\n\nThe early sound film ''The Bat Whispers'' played an influence on Bob Kane's [[Batman]] because the inspiration for Batman's costume came from the \"mysterious Bat\" character portrayed in the movie from 1930.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kane|first1=Bob|title=Batman and Me|publisher=Eclipse Books|location=Forestville, CA|page=38}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Avery Hopwood & Rose Rolanda.jpg|thumb|upright|Avery Hopwood with dancer [[Rosa Rolanda]], 1924]]\nIn 1906, Hopwood was introduced to writer and photographer [[Carl Van Vechten]]. The two became close friends and were sometimes sexual partners.<ref>{{harvnb|White|2014|pp=71\u201373}}</ref> In the 1920s Hopwood had a tumultuous and abusive romantic relationship with fellow Cleveland-born playwright John Floyd.<ref>{{harvnb|Sharrar|2005|p=201}}</ref> Although Hopwood announced to the press in 1924 that he was engaged to vaudeville dancer and choreographer [[Rosa Rolanda]], Van Vechten confirmed in later years that it was a publicity stunt. Rolanda would later marry caricaturist [[Miguel Covarrubias]].\n\nOn July 1, 1928, while swimming at [[Juan-les-Pins]] on the French Riviera, Hopwood had a heart attack and died.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He was buried in Riverside Cemetery, Cleveland.<ref>Wilson, Scott.

The bequest stipulated: \"It is especially desired that students competing for prizes shall be allowed the widest possible latitude, and that the new, the unusual, and the radical shall be especially encouraged.\" Famous Hopwood award winners include [[Robert Hayden]], [[Marge Piercy]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Betty Smith]], [[Lawrence Kasdan]], [[John Ciardi]], [[Mary Gaitskill]], [[Edmund White]], [[Nancy Willard]], [[Frank O'Hara]], and [[Steve Hamilton (author)|Steve Hamilton]].\n\n===''The Great Bordello''===\nThroughout his life, Hopwood worked on a novel that he hoped would \"expose\" the strictures the commercial theater machine imposed on playwrights, but the manuscript was never published. Jack Sharrar recovered the manuscript for this novel in 1982 during his research for ''Avery Hopwood, His Life and Plays''. The novel was published in July 2011 by Mondial Books (New York) as ''The Great Bordello''.\n\n==Works==\n[[File:\"Why men leave home\" by Avery Hopwood LCCN98516874.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] poster for Hopwood's 1922 play ''Why Men Leave Home'']]\n[[File:Hopwood.jpeg|thumb|upright|WPA poster for Hopwood's 1923 play ''The Alarm Clock'']]\n* ''Clothes'' (1906) with [[Channing Pollock (writer)|Channing Pollock]]\n* ''This Woman and This Man'' (1909)\n* ''[[Seven Days (play)|Seven Days]]'' (1909) with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]\n* ''Judy Forgot'' (1910)\n* ''Nobody's Widow'' (1910)\n* ''Somewhere Else'' (1913)\n* ''[[Fair and Warmer]]'' (1915)\n* ''Sadie Love'' (1915)\n* ''Our Little Wife'' (1916)\n* ''Double Exposure'' (1918)\n* ''Tumble In'' (1919, musical version of ''Seven Days'')\n* ''[[The Gold Diggers (play)|The Gold Diggers]]'' (1919)\n* ''[[The Girl in the Limousine (play)|The Girl in the Limousine]]'' (1919) with [[Wilson Collison]]\n* ''[[Ladies' Night (play)|Ladies' Night]]'' (1920) with Charlton Andrews\n* ''[[Spanish Love]]'' (1920, Adaptation of ''Mar\u00eda del Carmen'' by [[Josep Feliu i Codina]]) with Mary Roberts Rinehart\n* ''[[The Bat (play)|The Bat]]'' (1920) with Mary Roberts Rinehart\n* ''[[Getting Gertie's Garter (play)|Getting Gertie's Garter]]'' (1921) with Wilson Collison\n* ''[[The Demi-Virgin]]'' (1921)\n* ''Why Men Leave Home'' (1922)\n* ''Little Miss Bluebeard'' (1923, Adaptation of ''Kisasszony f\u00e9rje'' by G\u00e1bor Dr\u00e9gely)\n* ''The Alarm Clock'' (1923, Adaptation of ''La Sonnette d'alarme'' by [[Maurice Hennequin]] and [[Romain Coolus]])\n* ''The Best People'' (1924) with David Gray\n* ''The Harem'' (1924) with [[Ernest Vajda]]\n* ''Naughty Cinderella'' (1925, Adaptation of ''Pouche'' by Ren\u00e9 Peter and {{Interlanguage link multi|Henri Falk|fr}})\n* ''The Garden of Eden'' (1927, Adaptation of ''Der Garten Eden'' by [[Rudolf Bernauer]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Rudolf \u00d6sterreicher|de}})\n\n==Filmography==\n* ''Clothes'' (1914, based on ''Clothes'') <!--March 10, 1914-->\n* ''Judy Forgot'' (1915, based on ''Judy Forgot'') <!--August 9, 1915-->\n* ''Our Little Wife'' (1918, based on ''Our Little Wife'') <!--February 10, 1918-->\n* ''[[Sadie Love]]'' (1919, based on ''Sadie Love'') <!--October 19, 1919-->\n* ''[[Fair and Warmer (film)|Fair and Warmer]]'' (1919, based on ''Fair and Warmer'') <!--November 1, 1919-->\n* ''[[Guilty of Love (film)|Guilty of Love]]'' (1920, based on ''This Woman and This Man'') <!--August 22, 1920-->\n* ''[[Clothes (1920 film)|Clothes]]'' (1920, based on ''Clothes'') <!--September 19, 1920-->\n* ''The Little Clown'' (1921, based on ''The Little Clown'') <!--March 1921-->\n* ''[[The Gold Diggers (1923 film)|The Gold Diggers]]'' (1923, based on ''The Gold Diggers'') <!--September 22, 1923-->\n* ''[[Why Men Leave Home]]'' (1924, based on ''Why Men Leave Home'') <!--March 3, 1924-->\n* ''[[The Girl in the Limousine]]'' (1924, based on ''The Girl in the Limousine'') <!--July 20, 1924-->\n* ''[[Miss Bluebeard]]'' (1925, based on ''Little Miss Bluebeard'') <!--January 26, 1925-->\n* ''[[The Best People]]'' (1925, based on ''The Best People'') <!--December 28, 1925-->\n* ''[[The Bat (1926 film)|The Bat]]'' (1926, based on ''The Bat'') <!--March 14, 1926-->\n* ''[[Good and Naughty (film)|Good and Naughty]]'' (1926, based on ''Naughty Cinderella'') <!--June 7, 1926-->\n* ''Nobody's Widow'' (1927, based on ''Nobody's Widow'') <!--January 12, 1927-->\n* ''Getting Gertie's Garter'' (1927, based on ''Getting Gertie's Garter'') <!--February 28, 1927-->\n* ''[[The Garden of Eden (1928 film)|The Garden of Eden]]'' (1928, based on ''The Garden of Eden'') <!--February 4, 1928-->\n* ''[[Ladies' Night in a Turkish Bath]]'' (1928, based on ''Ladies' Night'') <!--April 1, 1928-->\n* ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'' (1929, based on ''The Gold Diggers'') <!--August 29, 1929 (NYC) -

The Emperor planned to have Felix and Liberius rule jointly, but when Liberius returned Felix was forced to retire to Porto, near Rome, where, after making an unsuccessful attempt to establish himself again in Rome, he died on 22 November 365 AD.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/203964/Felix-II Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: ''Felix (II)'']</ref><ref>[http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/avellana-1-english The Papal Schism between Liberius and Felix], 1\u20134</ref>\n\nThis Felix was later confused with a Roman martyr named Felix, with the result that he was included in lists of the Popes as Felix II and that the succeeding Popes of the same name ([[Pope Felix III]] and [[Pope Felix IV]]) were given wrong numerals, as was [[Antipope Felix V]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio'' 2012 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2012 {{ISBN|978-88-209-8722-0}}), p. 9*</ref>\n\nThe [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] (1909) called this confusion a \"distortion of the true facts\" and suggested that it arose because the \"Liber Pontificalis\", which at this point may be registering a reliable tradition, says that this Felix built a church on the [[Via Aurelia]], which is where the Roman martyr of an earlier date was buried.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06030a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: ''Felix II'']</ref> However, a more recent source says that of the martyr Felix nothing is known except his name, that he was a martyr, and that he was buried in the cemetery on the [[Via Portuensis]] that bears his name.<ref>''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 132</ref>\n\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia remarked that \"the real story of the antipope was lost and he obtained in local Roman history the status of a saint and a confessor. As such he appears in the Roman Martyrology on 29 July.\" At that time (1909) the Roman Martyrology had the following text: {{quote|At Rome, on the Aurelian Way, St. Felix II, pope and martyr. Being expelled from his See by the Arian emperor Constantius for defending the Catholic faith, and being put to the sword privately at Cera in Tuscany, he died gloriously. His body was taken away from that place by clerics, and buried on the Aurelian Way. It was afterwards brought to the Church of the Saints Cosmas and Damian, where, under the Sovereign Pontiff [[Gregory XIII]], it was found beneath the altar with the relics of the holy martyrs [[Mark and Marcellian|Mark, Marcellian, and Tranquillinus]], and with the latter was put back in the same place on 31 July. In the same altar were also found the bodies of the holy martyrs Abundius, a priest, and Abundantius, a deacon, which were shortly after solemnly transferred to the church of the Society of Jesus, on the eve of their feast.}} This entry was based on what the Catholic Encyclopedia called later legends that confound the relative positions of Felix and Liberius. More recent editions of the Roman Martyrology<ref name=Martyrology>''Martyrologium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001 {{ISBN|88-209-7210-7}})</ref> have instead: {{quote|At Rome, at the third milestone on the Via Portuensis, in the cemetery dedicated to his name, Saint Felix, martyr.}}\n\nThe [[feast day]] of the Roman martyr Felix is 29 July.<ref name=Martyrology/> The antipope Felix died, as stated above, on a 22 November, and his death was not a martyr's,<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Felix (Popes) |display=Felix |volume=10 |page=239}}</ref> occurring when the [[Peace of the Church|Peace of Constantine]] had been in force for half a century.\n\nAs well as the Roman Martyrology, the [[Roman Missal]] identified the Saint Felix of 29 July with the antipope.

This classification is now considered obsolete.<ref name=\"XimE: alkaloidy\"/><ref>[[#Orekhov|Orekhov]], p. 6</ref>\n\nMore recent classifications are based on similarity of the carbon skeleton (''e.g.'', [[indole]]-, [[isoquinoline]]-, and [[pyridine]]-like) or biochemical precursor ([[ornithine]], [[lysine]], [[tyrosine]], [[tryptophan]], etc.).<ref name=\"XimE: alkaloidy\"/> However, they require compromises in borderline cases;<ref name=\"ref15\" /> for example, [[nicotine]] contains a pyridine fragment from [[nicotinamide]] and a [[pyrrolidine]] part from ornithine<ref>[[#Aniszewski|Aniszewski]], p. 109</ref> and therefore can be assigned to both classes.<ref name=\"ref19\">[[#Dewick|Dewick]], p. 307</ref>\n\nAlkaloids are often divided into the following major groups:<ref>[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 12</ref>\n\n# \"True alkaloids\" contain [[nitrogen]] in the [[heterocycle]] and originate from [[amino acid]]s.<ref  \nname=\"ref21\">[[#Plemenkov|Plemenkov]], p. 223</ref> Their characteristic examples are [[atropine]], [[nicotine]], and [[morphine]]. This group also includes some alkaloids that besides the nitrogen heterocycle contain [[terpene]] (''e.g.'', [[evonine]]<ref>[[#Aniszewski|Aniszewski]], p. 108</ref>) or peptide fragments (''e.g.'' [[ergotamine]]<ref name=\"ref23\">[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 84</ref>). The piperidine alkaloids [[coniine]] and [[coniceine]] may be regarded as true alkaloids (rather than pseudoalkaloids: see below)<ref name=\"ref24\">[[#Hesse|Hesse]], p. 31</ref> although they do not originate from amino acids.<ref name=\"ref25\">[[#Dewick|Dewick]], p. 381</ref>\n# \"Protoalkaloids\", which contain [[nitrogen]] (but not the nitrogen heterocycle) and also originate from amino acids.<ref name=\"ref21\" /> Examples include [[mescaline]], [[adrenaline]] and [[ephedrine]].\n# Polyamine alkaloids \u2013 derivatives of [[putrescine]], [[spermidine]], and [[spermine]].\n# Peptide and cyclopeptide alkaloids.<ref name=\"ref27\">{{cite journal|author1=Dimitris C.

Alkaloid production in plants appeared to have evolved in response to feeding by herbivorous animals; however, some animals have evolved the ability to detoxify alkaloids.<ref>[[#Fattorusso|Fattorusso]], p. 53</ref>  Some alkaloids can produce developmental defects in the offspring of animals that consume but cannot detoxify the alkaloids.  One example is the alkaloid [[cyclopamine]], produced in the leaves of [[Veratrum californicum|corn lily]]. During the 1950s, up to 25% of lambs born by sheep that had grazed on corn lily had serious facial deformations. These ranged from deformed jaws to [[cyclopia]] (see picture). After decades of research, in the 1980s, the compound responsible for these deformities was identified as the alkaloid 11-deoxyjervine, later renamed to cyclopamine.<ref>{{cite book|page=362|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nixyqfGIGHcC&pg=PA362|title=Poisonous plants and related toxins, Volume 2001|author1=Thomas Acamovic |author2=Colin S.

Depending on the type of plants, the maximum concentration is observed in the leaves ([[black henbane]]), [[fruit]]s or [[seed]]s ([[Strychnine tree]]), root (''[[Rauwolfia serpentina]]'') or bark ([[cinchona]]).<ref>[[#Grinkevich|Grinkevich]], pp. 122\u2013123</ref> Furthermore, different tissues of the same plants may contain different alkaloids.<ref>[[#Orekhov|Orekhov]], p. 12</ref>\n\nBeside plants, alkaloids are found in certain types of [[fungi]], such as [[psilocybin]] in the fungus of the genus ''[[Psilocybe]]'', and in animals, such as [[bufotenin]] in the skin of some toads.<ref name=\"Hesse 5\" /> Many marine organisms also contain alkaloids.<ref>[[#Fattorusso|Fattorusso]], p.

Then, the impurities are dissolved by weak acids; this converts alkaloid bases into salts that are washed away with water. If necessary, an aqueous solution of alkaloid salts is again made alkaline and treated with an organic solvent. The process is repeated until the desired purity is achieved.\n\nIn the acidic extraction, the raw plant material is processed by a weak acidic solution (''e.g.'', [[acetic acid]] in water, ethanol, or methanol). A base is then added to convert alkaloids to basic forms that are extracted with organic solvent (if the extraction was performed with alcohol, it is removed first, and the remainder is dissolved in water).

For example, [[aporphine]] alkaloid [[liriodenine]] produced by the [[Liriodendron tulipifera|tulip tree]] protects it from parasitic mushrooms. In addition, the presence of alkaloids in the plant prevents insects and [[chordate]] animals from eating it. However, some animals are adapted to alkaloids and even use them in their own metabolism.<ref>[[#Hesse|Hesse]], pp. 283\u2013291</ref> Such alkaloid-related substances as [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]] and [[histamine]] are important [[neurotransmitter]]s in animals.

[[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]] started the Adventist movement in the 1830s. His followers became known as [[Millerism|Millerites]]. After the [[Great Disappointment]], the Millerite movement split up and was continued by a number of groups that held different views from one another. These groups, stemming from a common Millerite ancestor, became known collectively as the Adventist movement.\n\nAlthough the Adventist churches hold much in common, their [[Christian theology|theologies]] differ on whether the [[intermediate state]] of the dead is [[Soul sleep|unconscious sleep]] or consciousness, whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is [[annihilationism|annihilation]] or eternal torment, the nature of immortality, whether the wicked are resurrected after the millennium, and whether the sanctuary of Daniel 8 refers to the one in [[heavenly sanctuary|heaven]] or one on earth.<ref name=\"Handbook\"/> The movement has encouraged the examination of the whole [[Bible]], leading Seventh-day Adventists and some smaller Adventist groups to observe the [[Sabbath in Seventh-day Adventism|Sabbath]]. The [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists]] has compiled that church's core beliefs in [[the 28 Fundamental Beliefs]] (1980 and 2005), which use Biblical references as justification.\n\nIn 2010, Adventism claimed some 22 million believers scattered in various independent churches.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2011/12/Christianity-fullreport-web.pdf |title=Christianity report |access-date=2014-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805020311/http://www.pewforum.org/files/2011/12/Christianity-fullreport-web.pdf |archive-date=2013-08-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> The largest church within the movement\u2014the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]\u2014had more than 19 million baptized members in 2015.<ref>https://www.adventist.org/en/information/statistics/</ref><ref>Zylstra, Sarah Eekhoff. \"[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2015/januaryfebruary/season-of-adventists-can-ben-carson-church-stay-separatist.html The Season of Adventists: Can Ben Carson's Church Stay Separatist amid Booming Growth?]\" ''Christianity Today''. 2015-01-22. Retrieved 2015-10-13.</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Millerites|Great Disappointment}}\n\nAdventism began as an inter-denominational movement. Its most vocal leader was William Miller. Between 50,000 and 100,000 people in the United States supported Miller's predictions of Christ's return. After the \"[[Great Disappointment]]\" of October 22, 1844, many people in the movement gave up on Adventism. Of those remaining Adventist, the majority gave up believing in any prophetic (biblical) significance for the October 22 date, yet they remained expectant of the near Advent ([[second coming]] of Jesus).<ref name=\"Handbook\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">George Knight, ''A Brief History of Seventh-day Adventists''</ref>\n\nOf those who retained the October 22 date, many maintained that Jesus had come not literally but \"spiritually\", and consequently were known as \"spiritualizers\". A small minority held that something concrete had indeed happened on October 22, but this event had been misinterpreted. This viewpoint later emerged and crystallized with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the largest remaining body today.<ref name=\"Handbook\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><!-- did any continue setting dates? A small minority only? -->\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n[[File:Adventism-en.svg|750px|thumb|center|The development of branches of Adventism in the 19th century.]]\n\n===Albany Conference (1845)===\nThe Albany Conference in 1845, attended by 61 delegates, was called to attempt to determine the future course and meaning of the Millerite movement. Following this meeting, the \"Millerites\" then became known as \"Adventists\" or \"Second Adventists\". However, the delegates disagreed on several theological points.  Four groups emerged from the conference: The Evangelical Adventists, The Life and Advent Union, the [[Advent Christian Church]], and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].\n\nThe largest group was organized as the American Millennial Association, a portion of which was later known as the Evangelical Adventist Church.<ref name=\"Handbook\"/> Unique among the Adventists, they believed in an eternal hell and consciousness in death. They declined in numbers, and by 1916 their name did not appear in the United States Census of Religious Bodies. It has diminished to almost non-existence today. Their main publication was the ''Advent Herald'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adventistarchives.org/documents.asp?CatID=146&SortBy=1&ShowDateOrder=True |title=partial archives |publisher=Adventistarchives.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref> of which [[Sylvester Bliss]] was the editor until his death in 1863. It was later called the ''Messiah's Herald''.\n\nThe Life and Advent Union was founded by [[George Storrs]] in 1863. He had established ''The Bible Examiner'' in 1842. It merged with the Adventist Christian Church in 1964.\n\nThe [[Advent Christian Church]] officially formed in 1861 grew rapidly at first. It declined a little during the 20th century. The Advent Christians publish the four magazines ''The Advent Christian Witness'', ''Advent Christian News'', ''Advent Christian Missions'' and ''Maranatha''. They also operate a liberal arts college at Aurora, Illinois; and a one-year Bible College in Lenox, Massachusetts, called Berkshire Institute for Christian Studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.berkshireinstitute.org/|title=Berkshire Institute for Christian Studies}}</ref> The Primitive Advent Christian Church later separated from a few congregations in West Virginia.\n\nThe [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] officially formed in 1863. It believes in the sanctity of the seventh-day Sabbath as a holy day for worship.  It published the ''Adventist Review, Kids Review, and Sabbath Herald''. It has grown to a large worldwide denomination and has a significant network of medical and educational institutions.\n\nMiller did not join any of the movements, and he spent the last few years of his life working for unity, before dying in 1849.\n\n==Denominations==\nThe ''Handbook of Denominations in the United States'', 12th ed., describes the following churches as \"Adventist and Sabbatarian (Hebraic) Churches\":\n\n===Christadelphians===\n{{Main|Christadelphians}}\nThe Christadelphians were founded in 1844 by John Thomas and had an estimated 25,000 members in 170 ecclesias, or churches, in 2000 in America.\n\n===Advent Christian Church===\n{{Main|Advent Christian Church}}\nThe '''Advent Christian Church''' was founded in 1860 and had 25,277 members in 302 churches in 2002 in America.

During the [[English Reformation]], the Church of England broke away from the authority of the [[Catholic Church]]. [[Thomas Cranmer]] became the first Protestant holder of the office in 1533, while [[Reginald Pole]] was the last Catholic in the position, serving from 1556 to 1558 during the [[Counter-Reformation]]. In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other [[bishop]]s. At various times the choice was made by the [[canons of Canterbury Cathedral]], the Pope, or the [[King of England]]. Since the English Reformation, the Church of England has been more explicitly a [[state church]] and the choice is legally that of [[the Crown]]; today it is made by the Queen on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], who receives a shortlist of two names from an ''ad hoc'' committee called the [[Appointment of Church of England bishops|Crown Nominations Commission]].\n\n==Present roles and status==\nToday the archbishop fills four main roles:<ref>[http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/104 Archbishop's Roles and Responsibilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214105116/http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/104 |date=14 February 2008 }}, Archbishop of Canterbury website.

Founded in 597, it is the oldest [[episcopal see|see]] in the English church.\n# He is the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan archbishop]] of the [[Province of Canterbury]], which covers the southern two-thirds of England.\n# He is the senior [[primate (bishop)|primate]] and chief religious figure of the Church of England (the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British sovereign]] is the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|supreme governor]] of the church). Along with his colleague the [[Archbishop of York]] he chairs the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]] and sits on or chairs many of the church's important boards and committees; power in the church is not highly centralised, however, so the two archbishops can often lead only through persuasion. The Archbishop of Canterbury plays a central part in national ceremonies such as [[coronation of the British monarch|coronations]]; due to his high public profile, his opinions are often in demand by the [[news media]].\n# As spiritual leader of the [[Anglican Communion]], the archbishop, although without legal authority outside England, is recognised by convention as ''[[primus inter pares]]'' (\"first among equals\") of all Anglican [[primate (bishop)|primates]] worldwide. Since 1867 he has convened more or less decennial meetings of worldwide Anglican bishops, the [[Lambeth Conferences]].\n\nIn the last two of these functions, he has an important [[ecumenical]] and [[interfaith]] role, speaking on behalf of Anglicans in England and worldwide.\n\nThe archbishop's main residence is [[Lambeth Palace]] in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]]. He also has lodgings in the Old Palace, [[Canterbury]], located beside [[Canterbury Cathedral]], where the [[Chair of St Augustine]] sits.\n\nAs holder of one of the \"five great sees\" (the others being [[Archbishop of York|York]], [[Bishop of London|London]], [[Bishop of Durham|Durham]] and [[Bishop of Winchester|Winchester]]), the Archbishop of Canterbury is ''ex officio'' one of the [[Lords Spiritual]] of the [[House of Lords]]. He is one of the highest-ranking men in England and the highest ranking non-royal in the [[United Kingdom order of precedence|United Kingdom's order of precedence]].\n\nSince [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke with [[Catholic Church|Rome]], the Archbishops of Canterbury have been selected by the English (British since the Act of Union in 1707) monarch.  Since the 20th century, the appointment of Archbishops of Canterbury conventionally alternates between [[Anglo-Catholics]] and [[Evangelicals]].<ref>[http://www.archbishopofyork.org/154?q=archbishops The Archbishop of Canterbury], website of the Archbishop of York.

As archbishop he signs himself as ''+ Justin Cantuar''. His predecessor, Rowan Williams, 104th Archbishop of Canterbury, was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 27 February 2003. Immediately prior to his appointment to Canterbury, Williams was the [[Bishop of Monmouth]] and [[Archbishop of Wales]].

Of the kingdoms they created, [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] arguably had the closest links with European politics, trade and culture, because it was conveniently situated for communication with [[continental Europe]]. In the late 6th century, King [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent]] married a Christian [[Franks|Frankish]] princess named [[Bertha of Kent|Bertha]], possibly before becoming king, and certainly a number of years before the arrival of the first Christian mission to England.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02519a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Bertha<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref> He permitted the preaching of Christianity.<ref>[[Bede]], ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History]]'', i, 25.</ref>\n\nThe first Archbishop of Canterbury was [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] (not to be confused with [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine of Hippo]]), who arrived in Kent in 597 AD, having been sent by [[Pope Gregory I]] on a mission to the English. He was accepted by King \u00c6thelbert, on his conversion to Christianity, about the year 598. It seems that Pope Gregory, ignorant of recent developments in the former Roman province, including the spread of the [[Pelagianism|Pelagian heresy]], had intended the new archiepiscopal sees for England to be established in London and York.<ref>Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History'', i, 29.</ref> In the event, Canterbury was chosen instead of London, owing to political circumstances.<ref>Brooks, N., ''The Early History of the Church of Canterbury'', Leicester University Press, 1984, pp. 3\u201314.</ref> Since then the Archbishops of Canterbury have been referred to as occupying the [[Chair of St. Augustine]].\n\nA Gospel Book believed to be directly associated with St Augustine's mission survives in the [[Parker Library, Corpus Christi College]], [[Cambridge University]], England. Catalogued as Cambridge ''Manuscript 286'', it has been positively dated to 6th century Italy and this bound book, the [[St Augustine Gospels]], is still used during the swearing-in ceremony of new archbishops of Canterbury.\n\nBefore the break with papal authority in the 16th century, the Church of England was an integral part of the Western European church. Since the break the Church of England, an established national church, still considers itself part of the broader Western Catholic tradition (although this is not accepted by the Roman Catholic Church which regards Anglicanism as schismatic{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} and does not accept Anglican holy orders as valid) as well as being the \"mother church\" of the worldwide Anglican Communion.\n\n==Province and Diocese of Canterbury==\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury exercises metropolitical (or supervisory) jurisdiction over the [[Province of Canterbury]], which encompasses thirty of the forty-two dioceses of the Church of England, with the rest falling within the [[Province of York]]. The four dioceses of Wales were formerly also under the Province of Canterbury until 1920 when they were transferred from the [[established church|established Church]] of England to the [[Disestablishment of the Church in Wales|disestablished]] [[Church in Wales]].\n\n[[File:CanterburyCathedral.png|thumb|left|View of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] from the north west {{circa|1890\u20131900}}]]\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury has a ceremonial provincial ''curia'', or court, consisting of some of the senior bishops of his province.<ref>[http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/events/EnthronementofRW2003.pdf Order of Service from the Enthronement of the 104th Archbishop in 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202170108/http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/events/EnthronementofRW2003.pdf |date=2 February 2007 }}</ref> The [[Bishop of London]]\u2014the most senior cleric of the church with the exception of the two archbishops\u2014serves as Canterbury's provincial [[Dean (Church)|dean]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]] as [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|chancellor]], the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] as vice-chancellor, the [[Bishop of Salisbury]] as [[precentor]], the [[Bishop of Worcester]] as [[chaplain]] and the [[Bishop of Rochester]] as [[crucifer|cross-bearer]].\n\nAlong with [[Primacy of Canterbury|primacy over the Archbishop of York]], the Archbishop of Canterbury also has a precedence of honour over the other bishops of the Anglican Communion. He is recognised as ''primus inter pares'', or first amongst equals. He does not, however, exercise any direct authority in the provinces outside England, except in certain minor roles dictated by Canon in those provinces (for example, he is the judge in the event of an ecclesiastical prosecution against the Archbishop of Wales). He does hold [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitical]] authority over several [[extra-provincial Anglican churches]], and he serves as ''ex officio'' [[Bishop of the Falkland Islands]].\n\nAt present the archbishop has three [[suffragan]] bishops:\n{{clear}}\n* The [[Bishop of Dover]] is given the additional title of \"Bishop in Canterbury\" and empowered to act almost as if he were the [[diocesan bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Canterbury]], since the archbishop is so frequently away fulfilling national and international duties.\n* Two further suffragans, the [[Bishop of Ebbsfleet]] and the [[Bishop of Richborough]], are [[provincial episcopal visitor]]s for the whole [[Province of Canterbury]], licensed by the archbishop as \"flying bishops\" to provide oversight throughout the province to parishes who hold to the Church Catholic's teaching on the Sacrament of Ordination. \n\nThe [[Bishop of Maidstone]] was previously a second ''actual'' suffragan bishop working in the diocese, until it was decided at the diocesan synod of November 2010 that a new bishop will not be appointed.<ref>[http://www.canterburydiocese.org/diocesansynodnews/index.htm Canterbury Diocese \u2014 Synod News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615003605/http://www.canterburydiocese.org/diocesansynodnews/index.htm |date=15 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Styles and privileges==\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York are both styled as \"The Most Reverend\"; retired archbishops are styled as \"The Right Reverend\". Archbishops are, by convention, appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and may, therefore, also use the style of \"[[The Right Honourable]]\" for life (unless they are later removed from the council). In formal documents, the Archbishop of Canterbury is referred to as \"The Most Reverend <!--Father in God, is now omitted-->[[Given name|Forenames]], by Divine Providence Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England and Metropolitan\". In debates in the House of Lords, the archbishop is referred to as \"The Most Reverend Primate, the Archbishop of Canterbury\". \"The Right Honourable\" is not used in either instance. He may also be formally addressed as \"Your Grace\"\u2014or, more often these days, simply as \"Archbishop\", or \"Father\".\n\nThe surname of the Archbishop of Canterbury is not always used in formal documents; often only the first name and see are mentioned. The archbishop is legally entitled to sign his name as \"Cantuar\" (from the [[Latin]] for Canterbury).

From the time that the earliest English-speaking settlers arrived, the area has also been known as ''The Forks'', because it is situated at the confluence of the north and south branches of the [[Kalamazoo River]]. The ''Festival of the Forks'' has been held annually since 1967 to celebrate Albion's ethnic heritage.\n\nThe presence of several major manufacturers since the 19th century has given Albion the reputation of a factory town. This has changed with the closure of several manufacturers, and Albion's culture is changing to that of a college town with a strong interest in technology and sustainability issues.  [[Albion College]] is a private liberal arts college with a student population of about 1,250. Albion is a [[sister city]] with [[Noisy-le-Roi]], France.\n\n==History==\nThe first European-American settler, Tenney Peabody, arrived in 1833 along with his brother-in-law Charles Blanchard, and a young man named Clark Dowling. Peabody's family followed soon after. In 1835, the Albion Company, a land development company formed by [[Jesse Crowell]], [[plat]]ted a village and Peabody's wife was asked to name the settlement. She considered the name \"Peabodyville\", but \"Albion\" was selected instead, after the former residence of Jesse Crowell. Crowell became the first postmaster in 1838. Albion incorporated as a village in 1855 and as a city in 1885.<ref>[http://www.albionmich.com/history/histor_notebook/000910.shtml#TOP \"Festival of the Forks\"], Frank Passic, ''Morning Star'', September 10, 2000, pg. 9</ref><ref>[http://www.albionmich.com/history/histor_notebook/960909.shtml \"The Passing Scene\"], Frank Passic, ''Morning Star'', September 9, 2001, pg. 3</ref>\n\nIn 1835, [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist Episcopal]] settlers established [[Albion College]], which was known by a few other names before 1861 when the college was fully authorized to confer four-year degrees on both men and women. The first classes were held in Albion in 1843.\n\nThe forks of the Kalamazoo River provided power for [[Watermill|mills]], and Albion quickly became a mill town as well as an agricultural market. A railroad line arrived in 1852, fostering the development of other industries.\n\nIn 1973 Albion was named an [[All-America City Award|All-America City]] by the [[National Civic League]]. It celebrated winning the award on May 15, 1974, when the Governor of Michigan, [[William Milliken]], and many dignitaries came to town. However, in 1975 the closure of a major factory cut the celebration short and new challenges were created overnight.\n\nSince that time citizens have mobilized, with support from the Albion Community Foundation founded in 1968, and the Albion Volunteer Service Organization, founded in the 1980s with support from Albion College, to address the challenge of diminishing economic opportunity.\n\n[[Image:Superior Street Commercial Historic District.jpg|thumb| Albion's historic brick main street\u2014first laid in 1903 and\nreconstructed with hand-laid, kiln-fired clay bricks in 1993.]]\n\n[[Freedom of the City|Key to the City Honor]] Bestowed:\n\n*1964: [[Aunt Jemima]] visited Albion on January 25.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.albionmich.com/history/histor_notebook/070107.shtml |title=The Key To The City |publisher=Albionmich.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}</ref>\n*1960s: [[Ann Landers]] was presented with a key upon her visit to Starr Commonwealth for Boys.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n== Law and government ==\nAlbion has a [[Council-manager government|Council-Manager]] form of government.

Other Christians too, in particular [[Anglican]]s, Lutherans and some [[Protestant]] and other Christian communities use a rite of anointing the sick, without necessarily classifying it as a sacrament.\n\nIn the Churches mentioned here by name, the oil used (called \"oil of the sick\" in both West and East)<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/easternorthodox_4.shtml Sacred Mysteries (sacraments)]</ref> is blessed specifically for this purpose.\n\n=== Roman Catholic Church ===\n{{main|Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)}}\nAn extensive account of the teaching of the Catholic Church on Anointing of the Sick is given in [http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2sect2chpt2art5.shtml ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1499&ndash;1532.]\n\nAnointing of the Sick is one of the seven [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|Sacraments]] recognized by the Catholic Church, and is associated with not only bodily healing but also forgiveness of sins.

As the sacrament of Marriage gives grace for the married state, the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick gives grace for the state into which people enter through sickness. Through the sacrament a gift of the Holy Spirit is given, that renews confidence and faith in God and strengthens against temptations to discouragement, despair and anguish at the thought of death and the struggle of death; it prevents from losing Christian hope in God's justice, truth and salvation.\n\nThe special grace of the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick has as its effects:\n*the uniting of the sick person to the passion of Christ, for his own good and that of the whole Church;\n*the strengthening, peace, and courage to endure, in a Christian manner, the sufferings of illness or old age;\n*the forgiveness of sins, if the sick person was not able to obtain it through the sacrament of penance;\n*the restoration of health, if it is conducive to the salvation of his soul;\n*the preparation for passing over to eternal life.\"<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4N.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1532]</ref>\n\n====Sacramental oil====\nThe duly blessed oil used in the sacrament is, as laid down in the Apostolic Constitution [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-vi_apc_19721130_sacram-unctionem_en.html Sacram unctionem infirmorum], pressed from olives or from other plants.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4K.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1513]</ref> It is blessed by the bishop of the diocese at the [[Chrism]] Mass he celebrates on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]] or on a day close to it.

The form used in the Roman Rite included anointing of seven parts of the body while saying (in Latin): \"Through this holy unction and His own most tender mercy may the Lord pardon thee whatever sins or faults thou hast committed [quidquid deliquisti] by sight [by hearing, smell, taste, touch, walking, carnal delectation]\", the last phrase corresponding to the part of the body that was touched; however, in the words of the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia, \"the unction of the loins is generally, if not universally, omitted in English-speaking countries, and it is of course everywhere forbidden in case of women\".<ref name=CE/> Use of this form is still permitted under the conditions mentioned in article 9 of the 2007 [[motu proprio]] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''.<ref>[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/summorum-pontificum.html Summorum Pontificum, art. 9]</ref>\n\nLiturgical rites of the Catholic Church, both Western and Eastern, other than the Roman, have a variety of other forms for celebrating the sacrament.\n\n===Eastern Orthodox Church===\n[[File:2017-04-12--Service of the Sacrament of Holy Unction, on Holy Wednesday.jpg|right|thumb|Service of the Sacrament of Holy Unction served on Great and [[Holy Wednesday]].]] \nThe teaching of the Eastern Orthodox Church on the Holy Mystery (sacrament) of Unction is similar to that of the Roman Catholic Church. However, the reception of the Mystery is not limited to those who are enduring physical illness. The Mystery is given for healing (both physical and spiritual) and for the forgiveness of sin. For this reason, it is normally required that one go to confession before receiving Unction. Because it is a Sacred Mystery of the Church, only Orthodox Christians may receive it.\n\nThe solemn form of Eastern Christian anointing requires the ministry of seven priests. A table is prepared, upon which is set a vessel containing [[wheat]]. Into the wheat has been placed an empty shrine-lamp, seven candles, and seven anointing brushes. Candles are distributed for all to hold during the service. The rite begins with reading [[Psalm 51|Psalm 50]] (the great penitential psalm), followed by the chanting of a special [[Canon (hymnography)|canon]]. After this, the senior priest (or bishop) pours pure olive oil and a small amount of wine into the shrine lamp, and says the \"Prayer of the Oil\", which calls upon God to \"...sanctify this Oil, that it may be effectual for those who shall be anointed therewith, unto healing, and unto relief from every passion, every malady of the flesh and of the spirit, and every ill...\" Then follow seven series of [[epistle]]s, [[gospel]]s, long prayers, [[Ektenia]]s (litanies) and anointings. Each series is served by one of the seven priests in turn. The afflicted one is anointed with the [[sign of the cross]] on seven places: the forehead, the nostrils, the cheeks, the lips, the breast, the palms of both hands, and the back of the hands. After the last anointing, the [[Gospel Book]] is opened and placed with the writing down upon the head of the one who was anointed, and the senior priest reads the \"Prayer of the Gospel\". At the end, the anointed kisses the Gospel, the Cross and the right hands of the priests, receiving their blessing.\n\nAnointing is considered to be a public rather than a private sacrament, and so as many of the faithful who are able are encouraged to attend. It should be celebrated in the church when possible, but if this is impossible, it may be served in the home or hospital room of the afflicted.\n\nUnction in the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and Churches of Hellenic custom ([[Antiochian Eastern-Orthodox]], [[Melkite]], etc.) is usually given with a minimum of ceremony.\n\nAnointing may also be given during [[Clean Monday|Forgiveness Vespers]] and [[Holy Week|Great Week]], on [[Holy Wednesday|Great and Holy Wednesday]], to all who are prepared. Those who receive Unction on Holy Wednesday should go to [[Holy Communion]] on Great Thursday. The significance of receiving Unction on Holy Wednesday is shored up by the hymns in the [[Triodion]] for that day, which speak of the sinful woman who anointed the feet of Christ.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|26:6-16|KJV}}</ref> Just as her sins were forgiven because of her penitence, so the faithful are exhorted to repent of their sins. In the same narrative, Jesus says, \"in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial\" (Id., v. 12), linking the unction with Christ's death and resurrection.\n\nIn some [[diocese]]s of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] it is customary for the bishop to visit each parish or region of the diocese some time during [[Great Lent]] and give Anointing for the faithful, together with the local clergy.\n\n===Anglican churches===\nThe 1552 and later editions of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] omitted the form of anointing given in the original (1549) version in its Order for the Visitation of the Sick, but most twentieth-century Anglican prayer books do have anointing of the sick.<ref name=ODCC/>\n\nSome Anglicans accept that anointing of the sick has a sacramental character and is therefore a channel of God's grace, seeing it as an \"outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace\" which is the definition of a sacrament. The Catechism of the Episcopal Church of the United States of America includes Unction of the Sick as among the \"other sacramental rites\" and it states that unction can be done with oil or simply with laying on of hands.<ref>Episcopal Church, 1979 Book of Common Prayer, p.860</ref> The rite of anointing is included in the Episcopal Church's \"Ministration to the Sick\" <ref>Episcopal Church, 1979 Book of Common Prayer, p.456</ref>\n\nArticle 25 of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], which are one of the historical formularies of the Church of England (and as such, the Anglican Communion), speaking of the sacraments, says: \"Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and extreme Unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the corrupt following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in the Scriptures; but yet have not like nature of Sacraments with Baptism, and the Lord's Supper, for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God.\"<ref>[http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/articles/articles.html#25 Thirty-Nine Articles]</ref>\n\n===Lutheran churches===\nAnointing of the sick has been retained in some [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches since the Reformation.<ref>Fink, Peter E., S.J., ed. ''Anointing of the Sick. Alternative Futures for Worship, vol. 7''. Collegeville: Liturgical Press, 1987</ref> Although it is not considered a [[Lutheran sacraments|sacrament]] like [[Baptism#Reformation|baptism]] and the [[Eucharist in the Lutheran Church|Eucharist]], it is known as a [[ritual]] in the same respect as [[Confession in the Lutheran Church|confession]], [[Confirmation (Lutheran Church)|confirmation]], [[Holy Orders|holy orders]], and [[Christian views of marriage#Protestants|matrimony]].\n\n====Liturgy====\nAfter the penitent has received [[absolution]] following confession, the presiding minister recites James 5:14-16. He goes on to recite the following:<ref name=\"pcc\">{{cite book|title=Lutheran Service Book: Pastoral Care Companion|url=http://www.cph.org/pdf/031178.pdf|year=2007|publisher=Concordia Publishing House|isbn=0-7586-1225-7}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n[Name], you have confessed your sins and received Holy Absolution. In remembrance of the grace of God given by the Holy Spirit in the waters of Holy Baptism, I will anoint you with oil. Confident in our Lord and in love for you, we also pray for you that you will not lose faith. Knowing that in Godly patience the Church endures with you and supports you during this affliction. We firmly believe that this illness is for the glory of God and that the Lord will both hear our prayer and work according to His good and gracious will.\n</blockquote>\nHe anoints the person on the forehead and says this blessing:\n<blockquote>\nAlmighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has given you the new birth of water and the Spirit and has forgiven you all your sins, strengthen you with His grace to life everlasting. Amen.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Other Protestant communities===\nAmong Protestants, anointing is provided in a wide variety of formats but, for the most part, however, it has fallen into disuse.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}  Protestant communities generally vary widely on the sacramental character of anointing. Most Mainline Protestants recognize only two sacraments, the Eucharist and baptism, deeming Anointing only a humanly-instituted rite. Non-traditional Protestant communities generally use the term \"[[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinance]]\" rather than \"Sacrament\".\n\n====Mainline beliefs====\n[[Liturgical]] or [[Mainline Protestant]] communities (e.g. [[Presbyterian]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]]/[[United Church of Christ]], [[Methodist]], etc.) all have official yet often optional liturgical rites for the anointing of the sick partly on the model of Western pre-Reformation rites. Anointing need not be associated with grave illness or imminent danger of death.\n\n====Charismatic and Pentecostal beliefs====\nIn [[Charismatic (Christians)|Charismatic]] and [[Pentecostal]] communities, anointing of the sick is a frequent practice and has been an important ritual in these communities since the respective movements were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These communities use extemporaneous forms of administration at the discretion of the minister, who need not be a pastor. There is minimal ceremony attached to its administration. Usually, several people physically touch (laying on of hands) the recipient during the anointing. It may be part of a worship service with the full assembly of the congregation present, but may also be done in more private settings, such as homes or hospital rooms. Some Pentecostals believe that physical healing is within the anointing and so there is often great expectation or at least great hope that a miraculous cure or improvement will occur when someone is being prayed over for healing.\n\n==== Evangelical and fundamentalist beliefs ====\nIn [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Fundamentalism|Fundamentalist]] communities, anointing of the sick is performed with varying degrees of frequency, although laying on of hands may be more common than anointing. The rite would be similar to that of Pentecostals in its simplicity, but would usually not have the same emotionalism attached to it. Unlike some Pentecostals, Evangelicals and Fundamentalists generally do not believe that physical healing is within the anointing. Therefore, God may or may not grant physical healing to the sick. The healing conferred by anointing is thus a spiritual event that may not result in physical recovery.\n\nThe Church of the Brethren practices Anointing with Oil as an ordinance along with Baptism, Communion, Laying on of Hands, and the Love Feast.\n\nEvangelical Protestants who use anointing differ about whether the person doing the anointing must be an ordained member of the [[clergy]], whether the oil must necessarily be olive oil and have been previously specially consecrated, and about other details. Several Evangelical groups reject the practice so as not to be identified with [[Charismatic movement|charismatic]] and Pentecostal groups, which practice it widely.\n\n====Use of Catholic rite among Protestants====\nSome Protestant US military chaplains carry the Roman Rite version of the Anointing of the Sick with them for use if called upon to assist wounded or dying soldiers who are Catholics. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider invalid ''as a sacrament'' the administration of Anointing of the Sick by such chaplains, who in the eyes of those Churches are not validly ordained priests. The rite performed by them is thus seen as having the same, but by no means negligible, value of any other form of prayer offered for the sick or dying.\n\n===Latter Day Saint movement===\n\n====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====\n{{Main|Priesthood blessing}}\n[[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter-day Saints]], who consider themselves [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationists]], also practice ritual anointing of the sick, as well as other forms of anointing.

The priesthood holder anoints the recipient's head with a drop of oil, then [[Laying on of hands|lays hands upon that head]] and declare their act of anointing.

This contrasts with [[data structure]]s, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user.\n\nFormally, an ADT may be defined as a \"class of objects whose logical behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations\";{{sfn|Dale|Walker|1996|p=3}} this is analogous to an [[algebraic structure]] in mathematics. What is meant by \"behavior\" varies by author, with the two main types of formal specifications for behavior being ''axiomatic (algebraic) specification'' and an ''abstract model;''{{sfn|Dale|Walker|1996|p=4}} these correspond to [[axiomatic semantics]] and [[operational semantics]] of an [[abstract machine]], respectively. Some authors also include the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] (\"cost\"), both in terms of time (for computing operations) and space (for representing values). In practice many common data types are not ADTs, as the abstraction is not perfect, and users must be aware of issues like [[arithmetic overflow]] that are due to the representation. For example, integers are often stored as fixed width values (32-bit or 64-bit binary numbers), and thus experience [[integer overflow]] if the maximum value is exceeded.\n\nADTs are a theoretical concept in computer science, used in the design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, and software systems, and do not correspond to specific features of [[computer language]]s\u2014mainstream computer languages do not directly support formally specified ADTs. However, various language features correspond to certain aspects of ADTs, and are easily confused with ADTs proper; these include [[abstract type]]s, [[opaque data type]]s, [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocols]], and [[design by contract]]. ADTs were first proposed by [[Barbara Liskov]] and Stephen N. Zilles in 1974, as part of the development of the [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]] language.{{sfn|Liskov|Zilles|1974}}\n\n==Examples==\nFor example, [[integer]]s are an ADT, defined as the values \u2026, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, \u2026, and by the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, together with greater than, less than, etc., which behave according to familiar mathematics (with care for [[integer division]]), independently of how the integers are represented by the computer.{{efn|Compare to the characterization of integers in abstract algebra.}} Explicitly, \"behavior\" includes obeying various axioms (associativity and commutativity of addition etc.), and preconditions on operations (cannot divide by zero). Typically integers are represented in a data structure as [[binary number]]s, most often as [[two's complement]], but might be [[binary-coded decimal]] or in [[ones' complement]], but the user is abstracted from the concrete choice of representation, and can simply use the data as data types.\n\nAn ADT consists not only of operations, but also of values of the underlying data and of constraints on the operations. An \"interface\" typically refers only to the operations, and perhaps some of the constraints on the operations, notably pre-conditions and post-conditions, but not other constraints, such as relations between the operations.\n\nFor example, an abstract [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]], which is a last-in-first-out structure, could be defined by three operations: <kbd>push</kbd>, that inserts a data item onto the stack; <kbd>pop</kbd>, that removes a data item from it; and <kbd>peek</kbd> or <kbd>top</kbd>, that accesses a data item on top of the stack without removal. An abstract [[Queue (abstract data type)|queue]], which is a first-in-first-out structure, would also have three operations: <kbd>enqueue</kbd>, that inserts a data item into the queue; <kbd>dequeue</kbd>, that removes the first data item from it; and <kbd>front</kbd>, that accesses and serves the first data item in the queue. There would be no way of differentiating these two data types, unless a mathematical constraint is introduced that for a stack specifies that each pop always returns the most recently pushed item that has not been popped yet. When [[analysis of algorithms|analyzing the efficiency]] of algorithms that use stacks, one may also specify that all operations take the same time no matter how many data items have been pushed into the stack, and that the stack uses a constant amount of storage for each element.\n\n==Introduction==\nAbstract data types are purely theoretical entities, used (among other things) to simplify the description of abstract algorithms, to classify and evaluate data structures, and to formally describe the [[type system]]s of programming languages. However, an ADT may be [[implementation|implemented]] by specific [[data type]]s or [[data structure]]s, in many ways and in many programming languages; or described in a [[formal specification language]]. ADTs are often implemented as [[modular programming|modules]]: the module's [[interface (computer science)|interface]] declares procedures that correspond to the ADT operations, sometimes with [[comment (computer programming)|comments]] that describe the constraints. This [[information hiding]] strategy allows the implementation of the module to be changed without disturbing the [[client (computing)|client]] programs.\n\nThe term abstract data type can also be regarded as a generalized approach of a number of algebraic structures, such as lattices, groups, and rings.<ref>{{cite book | author=Rudolf Lidl | title=Abstract Algebra| publisher=Springer | year=2004 | isbn=81-8128-149-7}}, Chapter 7,section 40.</ref> The notion of abstract data types is related to the concept of [[data abstraction]], important in [[object-oriented programming language|object-oriented programming]] and [[design by contract]] methodologies for [[software engineering|software development]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/object-oriented-programming/|title=What Is Object-Oriented Programming?|date=2015-05-05|newspaper=Hiring {{!}} Upwork|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n\n==Defining an abstract data type==\nAn abstract data type is defined as a mathematical model of the data objects that make up a data type as well as the functions that operate on these objects.\nThere are no standard conventions for defining them. A broad division may be drawn between \"imperative\" and \"functional\" definition styles.\n\n===Imperative-style definition===\nIn the philosophy of [[imperative programming]] languages, an abstract data structure is conceived as an entity that is ''mutable''\u2014meaning that it may be in different ''states'' at different times. Some operations may change the state of the ADT; therefore, the order in which operations are evaluated is important, and the same operation on the same entities may have different effects if executed at different times\u2014just like the instructions of a computer, or the commands and procedures of an imperative language. To underscore this view, it is customary to say that the operations are ''executed'' or ''applied'', rather than ''evaluated''. The imperative style is often used when describing abstract algorithms. (See [[The Art of Computer Programming]] by [[Donald Knuth]] for more details)\n\n====Abstract variable====\nImperative-style definitions of ADT often depend on the concept of an ''abstract variable'', which may be regarded as the simplest non-trivial ADT. An abstract variable ''V'' is a mutable entity that admits two operations:\n* <kbd>store</kbd>(''V'', ''x'') where ''x'' is a ''value'' of unspecified nature;\n* <kbd>fetch</kbd>(''V''), that yields a value,\nwith the constraint that\n* <kbd>fetch</kbd>(''V'') always returns the value ''x'' used in the most recent <kbd>store</kbd>(''V'', ''x'') operation on the same variable ''V''.\n\nAs in so many programming languages, the operation <kbd>store</kbd>(''V'', ''x'') is often written ''V'' \u2190 ''x'' (or some similar notation), and <kbd>fetch</kbd>(''V'') is implied whenever a variable ''V'' is used in a context where a value is required. Thus, for example, ''V'' \u2190 ''V'' + 1 is commonly understood to be a shorthand for <kbd>store</kbd>(''V'',<kbd>fetch</kbd>(''V'') + 1).\n\nIn this definition, it is implicitly assumed that storing a value into a variable ''U'' has no effect on the state of a distinct variable ''V''. To make this assumption explicit, one could add the constraint that\n* if ''U'' and ''V'' are distinct variables, the sequence { <kbd>store</kbd>(''U'', ''x''); <kbd>store</kbd>(''V'', ''y'') } is equivalent to { <kbd>store</kbd>(''V'', ''y''); <kbd>store</kbd>(''U'', ''x'') }.\n\nMore generally, ADT definitions often assume that any operation that changes the state of one ADT instance has no effect on the state of any other instance (including other instances of the same ADT) \u2014 unless the ADT axioms imply that the two instances are connected ([[Aliasing (computing)|aliased]]) in that sense. For example, when extending the definition of abstract variable to include abstract [[record (computer science)|records]], the operation that selects a field from a record variable ''R'' must yield a variable ''V'' that is aliased to that part of ''R''.\n\nThe definition of an abstract variable ''V'' may also restrict the stored values ''x'' to members of a specific set ''X'', called the ''range'' or ''type'' of ''V''. As in programming languages, such restrictions may simplify the description and [[analysis of algorithms]], and improve their readability.\n\nNote that this definition does not imply anything about the result of evaluating <kbd>fetch</kbd>(''V'') when ''V'' is ''un-initialized'', that is, before performing any <kbd>store</kbd> operation on ''V''. An algorithm that does so is usually considered invalid, because its effect is not defined. (However, there are some important algorithms whose efficiency strongly depends on the assumption that such a <kbd>fetch</kbd> is legal, and returns some arbitrary value in the variable's range.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}})\n\n====Instance creation====\nSome algorithms need to create new instances of some ADT (such as new variables, or new stacks). To describe such algorithms, one usually includes in the ADT definition a <kbd>create</kbd>() operation that yields an instance of the ADT, usually with axioms equivalent to\n* the result of <kbd>create</kbd>() is distinct from any instance in use by the algorithm.\nThis axiom may be strengthened to exclude also partial aliasing with other instances. On the other hand, this axiom still allows implementations of <kbd>create</kbd>() to yield a previously created instance that has become inaccessible to the program.\n\n====Example: abstract stack (imperative)====\nAs another example, an imperative-style definition of an abstract stack could specify that the state of a stack ''S'' can be modified only by the operations\n* <kbd>push</kbd>(''S'', ''x''), where ''x'' is some ''value'' of unspecified nature;\n* <kbd>pop</kbd>(''S''), that yields a value as a result,\nwith the constraint that\n* For any value ''x'' and any abstract variable ''V'', the sequence of operations { <kbd>push</kbd>(''S'', ''x''); ''V'' \u2190 <kbd>pop</kbd>(''S'') } is equivalent to ''V'' \u2190 ''x''.\n\nSince the assignment ''V'' \u2190 ''x'', by definition, cannot change the state of ''S'', this condition implies that ''V'' \u2190 <kbd>pop</kbd>(''S'') restores ''S'' to the state it had before the <kbd>push</kbd>(''S'', ''x''). From this condition and from the properties of abstract variables, it follows, for example, that the sequence\n: { <kbd>push</kbd>(''S'', ''x''); <kbd>push</kbd>(''S'', ''y''); ''U'' \u2190 <kbd>pop</kbd>(''S''); <kbd>push</kbd>(''S'', ''z''); ''V'' \u2190 <kbd>pop</kbd>(''S''); ''W'' \u2190 <kbd>pop</kbd>(''S'') }\nwhere ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are any values, and ''U'', ''V'', ''W'' are pairwise distinct variables, is equivalent to\n: { ''U'' \u2190 ''y''; ''V'' \u2190 ''z''; ''W'' \u2190 ''x'' }\n\nHere it is implicitly assumed that operations on a stack instance do not modify the state of any other ADT instance, including other stacks; that is,\n* For any values ''x'', ''y'', and any distinct stacks ''S'' and ''T'', the sequence { <kbd>push</kbd>(''S'', ''x''); <kbd>push</kbd>(''T'', ''y'') } is equivalent to { <kbd>push</kbd>(''T'', ''y''); <kbd>push</kbd>(''S'', ''x'') }.\n\nAn abstract stack definition usually includes also a [[Boolean value|Boolean]]-valued function <kbd>empty</kbd>(''S'') and a <kbd>create</kbd>() operation that returns a stack instance, with axioms equivalent to\n* <kbd>create</kbd>() \u2260 ''S'' for any stack ''S'' (a newly created stack is distinct from all previous stacks);\n* <kbd>empty</kbd>(<kbd>create</kbd>()) (a newly created stack is empty);\n* <kbd>not</kbd> <kbd>empty</kbd>(<kbd>push</kbd>(''S'', ''x'')) (pushing something into a stack makes it non-empty).\n\n====Single-instance style====\nSometimes an ADT is defined as if only one instance of it existed during the execution of the algorithm, and all operations were applied to that instance, which is not explicitly notated. For example, the abstract stack above could have been defined with operations <kbd>push</kbd>(''x'') and <kbd>pop</kbd>(), that operate on ''the'' only existing stack. ADT definitions in this style can be easily rewritten to admit multiple coexisting instances of the ADT, by adding an explicit instance parameter (like ''S'' in the previous example) to every operation that uses or modifies the implicit instance.\n\nOn the other hand, some ADTs cannot be meaningfully defined without assuming multiple instances. This is the case when a single operation takes two distinct instances of the ADT as parameters. For an example, consider augmenting the definition of the abstract stack with an operation <kbd>compare</kbd>(''S'', ''T'') that checks whether the stacks ''S'' and ''T'' contain the same items in the same order.\n\n===Functional-style definition===\nAnother way to define an ADT, closer to the spirit of [[functional programming]], is to consider each state of the structure as a separate entity. In this view, any operation that modifies the ADT is modeled as a [[function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] that takes the old state as an argument, and returns the new state as part of the result. Unlike the imperative operations, these functions have no [[side effect (computer science)|side effect]]s. Therefore, the order in which they are evaluated is immaterial, and the same operation applied to the same arguments (including the same input states) will always return the same results (and output states).\n\nIn the functional view, in particular, there is no way (or need) to define an \"abstract variable\" with the semantics of imperative variables (namely, with <kbd>fetch</kbd> and <kbd>store</kbd> operations). Instead of storing values into variables, one passes them as arguments to functions.\n\n====Example: abstract stack (functional)====\nFor example, a complete functional-style definition of an abstract stack could use the three operations:\n* <kbd>push</kbd>: takes a stack state and an arbitrary value, returns a stack state;\n* <kbd>top</kbd>: takes a stack state, returns a value;\n* <kbd>pop</kbd>: takes a stack state, returns a stack state.\n\nIn a functional-style definition there is no need for a <kbd>create</kbd> operation. Indeed, there is no notion of \"stack instance\". The stack states can be thought of as being potential states of a single stack structure, and two stack states that contain the same values in the same order are considered to be identical states. This view actually mirrors the behavior of some concrete implementations, such as [[linked list]]s with [[hash cons]].\n\nInstead of <kbd>create</kbd>(), a functional-style definition of an abstract stack may assume the existence of a special stack state, the ''empty stack'', designated by a special symbol like \u039b or \"()\"; or define a <kbd>bottom</kbd>() operation that takes no arguments and returns this special stack state. Note that the axioms imply that\n* <kbd>push</kbd>(\u039b, ''x'') \u2260 \u039b.\nIn a functional-style definition of a stack one does not need an <kbd>empty</kbd> predicate: instead, one can test whether a stack is empty by testing whether it is equal to \u039b.\n\nNote that these axioms do not define the effect of <kbd>top</kbd>(''s'') or <kbd>pop</kbd>(''s''), unless ''s'' is a stack state returned by a <kbd>push</kbd>. Since <kbd>push</kbd> leaves the stack non-empty, those two operations are undefined (hence invalid) when ''s'' = \u039b. On the other hand, the axioms (and the lack of side effects) imply that <kbd>push</kbd>(''s'', ''x'') = <kbd>push</kbd>(''t'', ''y'') [[if and only if]] ''x'' = ''y'' and ''s'' = ''t''.\n\nAs in some other branches of mathematics, it is customary to assume also that the stack states are only those whose existence can be proved from the axioms in a finite number of steps. In the abstract stack example above, this rule means that every stack is a ''finite'' sequence of values, that becomes the empty stack (\u039b) after a finite number of <kbd>pop</kbd>s. By themselves, the axioms above do not exclude the existence of infinite stacks (that can be <kbd>pop</kbd>ed forever, each time yielding a different state) or circular stacks (that return to the same state after a finite number of <kbd>pop</kbd>s). In particular, they do not exclude states ''s'' such that <kbd>pop</kbd>(''s'') = ''s'' or <kbd>push</kbd>(''s'', ''x'') = ''s'' for some ''x''. However, since one cannot obtain such stack states with the given operations, they are assumed \"not to exist\".\n\n===Whether to include complexity===\nAside from the behavior in terms of axioms, it is also possible to include, in the definition of an ADT operation, their [[Analysis of algorithms|algorithmic complexity]]. [[Alexander Stepanov]], designer of the C++ [[Standard Template Library]], included complexity guarantees in the STL specification, arguing:\n\n{{quote|The reason for introducing the notion of abstract data types was to allow interchangeable software modules. You cannot have interchangeable modules unless these modules share similar complexity behavior. If I replace one module with another module with the same functional behavior but with different complexity tradeoffs, the user of this code will be unpleasantly surprised. I could tell him anything I like about data abstraction, and he still would not want to use the code. Complexity assertions have to be part of the interface.|Alexander Stepanov<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Al |last=Stevens |title=Al Stevens Interviews Alex Stepanov |date=March 1995 |journal=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]] |url=http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/drdobbs-interview.html |accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref>}}\n\n==Advantages of abstract data typing==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2011}}\n\n===Encapsulation===\n[[Abstraction (computer science)|Abstraction]] provides a promise that any implementation of the ADT has certain properties and abilities; knowing these is all that is required to make use of an ADT object. The user does not need any technical knowledge of how the implementation works to use the ADT. In this way, the implementation may be complex but will be encapsulated in a simple interface when it is actually used.\n\n===Localization of change===\nCode that uses an ADT object will not need to be edited if the implementation of the ADT is changed. Since any changes to the implementation must still comply with the interface, and since code using an ADT object may only refer to properties and abilities specified in the interface, changes may be made to the implementation without requiring any changes in code where the ADT is used.\n\n===Flexibility===\nDifferent implementations of the ADT, having all the same properties and abilities, are equivalent and may be used somewhat interchangeably in code that uses the ADT. This gives a great deal of flexibility when using ADT objects in different situations. For example, different implementations of the ADT may be more efficient in different situations; it is possible to use each in the situation where they are preferable, thus increasing overall efficiency.\n\n==Typical operations==\nSome operations that are often specified for ADTs (possibly under other names) are\n* <kbd>compare</kbd>(''s'', ''t''), that tests whether two instances' states are equivalent in some sense;\n* <kbd>hash</kbd>(''s''), that computes some standard [[hash function]] from the instance's state;\n* <kbd>print</kbd>(''s'') or <kbd>show</kbd>(''s''), that produces a human-readable representation of the instance's state.\n\nIn imperative-style ADT definitions, one often finds also\n* <kbd>create</kbd>(), that yields a new instance of the ADT;\n* <kbd>initialize</kbd>(''s''), that prepares a newly created instance ''s'' for further operations, or resets it to some \"initial state\";\n* <kbd>copy</kbd>(''s'', ''t''), that puts instance ''s'' in a state equivalent to that of ''t'';\n* <kbd>clone</kbd>(''t''), that performs ''s'' \u2190 <kbd>create</kbd>(), <kbd>copy</kbd>(''s'', ''t''), and returns ''s'';\n* <kbd>free</kbd>(''s'') or <kbd>destroy</kbd>(''s''), that reclaims the memory and other resources used by ''s''.\n\nThe <kbd>free</kbd> operation is not normally relevant or meaningful, since ADTs are theoretical entities that do not \"use memory\". However, it may be necessary when one needs to analyze the storage used by an algorithm that uses the ADT. In that case one needs additional axioms that specify how much memory each ADT instance uses, as a function of its state, and how much of it is returned to the pool by <kbd>free</kbd>.\n\n==Examples==\nSome common ADTs, which have proved useful in a great variety of applications, are\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Container (abstract data type)|Container]]\n* [[List (abstract data type)|List]]\n* [[Set (abstract data type)|Set]]\n* [[Set (abstract data type)#Multiset|Multiset]]\n* [[Associative array|Map]]\n* [[Multimap]]\n* [[Graph (abstract data type)|Graph]]\n* [[Tree (data structure)|Tree]]\n* [[Stack (abstract data type)|Stack]]\n* [[Queue (abstract data type)|Queue]]\n* [[Priority queue]]\n* [[Double-ended queue]]\n* [[Double-ended priority queue]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nEach of these ADTs may be defined in many ways and variants, not necessarily equivalent. For example, an abstract stack may or may not have a <kbd>count</kbd> operation that tells how many items have been pushed and not yet popped. This choice makes a difference not only for its clients but also for the implementation.\n\n; Abstract graphical data type\nAn extension of ADT for computer graphics was proposed in 1979:<ref>{{Cite conference | author= D. Thalmann, N. Magnenat Thalmann |title= Design and Implementation of Abstract Graphical Data Types |date=1979 |conference=IEEE|url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=762551&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F6188%2F16515%2F00762551.pdf%3Farnumber%3D762551}}, Proc. 3rd International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC'79), IEEE, Chicago, USA, pp.519-524</ref> an [[abstract graphical data type]] (AGDT). It was introduced by [[Nadia Magnenat Thalmann]], and [[Daniel Thalmann]]. AGDTs provide the advantages of ADTs with facilities to build graphical objects in a structured way.\n\n==Implementation==\n{{further|Opaque data type}}\nImplementing an ADT means providing one [[subroutine|procedure or function]] for each abstract operation. The ADT instances are represented by some concrete [[data structure]] that is manipulated by those procedures, according to the ADT's specifications.\n\nUsually there are many ways to implement the same ADT, using several different concrete data structures. Thus, for example, an abstract stack can be implemented by a [[linked list]] or by an [[Array data structure|array]].\n\nIn order to prevent clients from depending on the implementation, an ADT is often packaged as an ''[[opaque data type]]'' in one or more [[module (programming)|modules]], whose interface contains only the signature (number and types of the parameters and results) of the operations. The implementation of the module\u2014namely, the bodies of the procedures and the concrete data structure used\u2014can then be hidden from most clients of the module. This makes it possible to change the implementation without affecting the clients. If the implementation is exposed, it is known instead as a ''transparent data type.''\n\nWhen implementing an ADT, each instance (in imperative-style definitions) or each state (in functional-style definitions) is usually represented by a [[handle (computing)|handle]] of some sort.<ref>{{cite book | author=Robert Sedgewick | title=Algorithms in C | publisher=Addison/Wesley | year=1998 | isbn=0-201-31452-5}}, definition 4.4.</ref>\n\nModern object-oriented languages, such as [[C++]] and [[Java programming language|Java]], support a form of abstract data types. When a class is used as a type, it is an abstract type that refers to a hidden representation. In this model an ADT is typically implemented as a [[class (computer science)|class]], and each instance of the ADT is usually an [[object (computer science)|object]] of that class. The module's interface typically declares the constructors as ordinary procedures, and most of the other ADT operations as [[method (computer programming)|methods]] of that class. However, such an approach does not easily encapsulate multiple representational variants found in an ADT. It also can undermine the extensibility of object-oriented programs.\nIn a pure object-oriented program that uses interfaces as types, types refer to behaviors not representations.\n\n===Example: implementation of the abstract stack===\n<!-- This section should be moved to [[stack data structure]] or a new [[abstract stack]] article. -->\nAs an example, here is an implementation of the abstract stack above in the [[C programming language]].\n<!-- Replace <pre> by <source \"lang=c\"> after the color scheme has been fixed.

This complaint should be moved to the technical village pump or some such. -->\n\n====Imperative-style interface====\nAn imperative-style interface might be:\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\ntypedef struct stack_Rep stack_Rep;       // type: stack instance representation (opaque record)\ntypedef stack_Rep* stack_T;               // type: handle to a stack instance (opaque pointer)\ntypedef void* stack_Item;                 // type: value stored in stack instance (arbitrary address)\n\nstack_T stack_create(void);               // creates a new empty stack instance\nvoid stack_push(stack_T s, stack_Item x); // adds an item at the top of the stack\nstack_Item stack_pop(stack_T s);          // removes the top item from the stack and returns it\nbool stack_empty(stack_T s);              // checks whether stack is empty\n</source>\n\nThis interface could be used in the following manner:\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\n#include <stack.h>          // includes the stack interface\n\nstack_T s = stack_create(); // creates a new empty stack instance\nint x = 17;\nstack_push(s, &x);          // adds the address of x at the top of the stack\nvoid* y = stack_pop(s);     // removes the address of x from the stack and returns it\nif(stack_empty(s)) { }      // does something if stack is empty\n</source>\n\nThis interface can be implemented in many ways. The implementation may be arbitrarily inefficient, since the formal definition of the ADT, above, does not specify how much space the stack may use, nor how long each operation should take. It also does not specify whether the stack state ''s'' continues to exist after a call ''x'' \u2190 <kbd>pop</kbd>(''s'').\n\nIn practice the formal definition should specify that the space is proportional to the number of items pushed and not yet popped; and that every one of the operations above must finish in a constant amount of time, independently of that number. To comply with these additional specifications, the implementation could use a linked list, or an array (with dynamic resizing) together with two integers (an item count and the array size).\n\n====Functional-style interface====\nFunctional-style ADT definitions are more appropriate for functional programming languages, and vice versa. However, one can provide a functional-style interface even in an imperative language like C. For example:\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\ntypedef struct stack_Rep stack_Rep;          // type: stack state representation (opaque record)\ntypedef stack_Rep* stack_T;                  // type: handle to a stack state (opaque pointer)\ntypedef void* stack_Item;                    // type: value of a stack state (arbitrary address)\n\nstack_T stack_empty(void);                   // returns the empty stack state\nstack_T stack_push(stack_T s, stack_Item x); // adds an item at the top of the stack state and returns the resulting stack state\nstack_T stack_pop(stack_T s);                // removes the top item from the stack state and returns the resulting stack state\nstack_Item stack_top(stack_T s);             // returns the top item of the stack state\n</source>\n\n===ADT libraries===\nMany modern programming languages, such as C++ and Java, come with standard libraries that implement several common ADTs, such as those listed above.\n\n===Built-in abstract data types===\nThe specification of some programming languages is intentionally vague about the representation of certain built-in data types, defining only the operations that can be done on them. Therefore, those types can be viewed as \"built-in ADTs\". Examples are the arrays in many scripting languages, such as [[Awk]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], and [[Perl]], which can be regarded as an implementation of the abstract list.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Concept (generic programming)]]\n* [[Formal methods]]\n* [[Functional specification]]\n* [[Generalized algebraic data type]]\n* [[Initial algebra]]\n* [[Liskov substitution principle]]\n* [[Type theory]]\n* [[Walls and Mirrors]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite conference\n| doi = 10.1145/800233.807045\n| chapter = Programming with abstract data types\n| title = Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Very High Level Languages\n| series = SIGPLAN Notices\n| volume = 9\n| issue = 4\n| pages = 50\u201359\n| year = 1974\n| last1 = Liskov | first1 = Barbara | authorlink1 = Barbara Liskov\n| last2 = Zilles | first2 = Stephen\n| ref = harv\n| citeseerx = 10.1.1.136.3043\n}}\n* {{Cite book | isbn = 978-0-66940000-7 | title = Abstract Data Types: Specifications, Implementations, and Applications | last1 = Dale | first1 = Nell | year = 1996 | publisher = Jones & Bartlett Learning | last2 = Walker | first2 = Henry M. | ref = harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal|first1=John C.|last1=Mitchell|authorlink1=John C.

The upstart AFL operated in direct competition with the more established NFL throughout its existence. It was more successful than earlier rivals to the NFL with the same name, the [[American Football League (1926)]], [[American Football League (1936)]], [[American Football League (1940)]], and the later [[All-America Football Conference]] [(1944&ndash;1950), played 1946&ndash;1949].\n\nThis fourth version of the AFL was the most successful, created by a number of owners who had been refused NFL expansion franchises or had minor shares of NFL franchises. The AFL's original lineup consisted of an Eastern division of the [[New York Jets|New York Titans]], [[New England Patriots|Boston Patriots]], [[Buffalo Bills]], and the [[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston Oilers]], and a Western division of the [[Los Angeles Chargers]], [[Denver Broncos]], [[Oakland Raiders]], and [[Dallas Texans (AFL)|Dallas Texans]]. The league first gained attention by signing 75% of the [[1960 NFL Draft|NFL's first-round draft choices in 1960]], including Houston's successful signing of college star and [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Billy Cannon]].\n\nWhile the first years of the AFL saw uneven competition and low attendance, the league was buttressed by a generous television contract with the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) (followed by a contract with the competing [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC) for games starting with the 1965 season) that broadcast the more offense-oriented football league nationwide. Continuing to attract top talent from colleges and the NFL by the mid-1960s, as well as successful franchise shifts of the Chargers from L.A. south to [[San Diego]] and the Texans north to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (becoming the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]), the AFL established a dedicated following. The transformation of the struggling Titans into the [[New York Jets]] under new ownership further solidified the league's reputation among the major media.\n\nAs fierce competition made player salaries skyrocket in both leagues, especially after a series of \"raids\", the leagues agreed to a [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger in 1966]]. Among the conditions were a common draft and a championship game played between the two league champions first played in early 1967, which would eventually become known as the [[Super Bowl]].\n\nThe AFL and NFL operated as separate leagues until 1970, with separate regular season and playoff schedules except for the championship game. [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Pete Rozelle]] also became chief executive of the AFL from July 26, 1966, through the completion of the merger.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/07/26/139971422.pdf|title=New Pact to Last at Least 3 Years: Woodard's Position Unsure After 1970 Merger|last=Milligan|first=Lloyd|date=26 July 1966|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref> During this time the AFL expanded, adding the [[Miami Dolphins]] and [[Cincinnati Bengals]]. After losses by Kansas City and Oakland in the first two AFL-NFL National Championship Games to the [[Green Bay Packers]] (1967/1968), the [[New York Jets]] and [[Kansas City Chiefs]] won [[Super Bowl III|Super Bowls III]] and [[Super Bowl IV|IV]] (1969/1970)  respectively, cementing the league's claim to being an equal to the NFL.\n\nIn 1970, the AFL was absorbed into the NFL and the league reorganized with the ten AFL franchises along with the previous NFL teams [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]], [[Cleveland Browns]], and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] becoming part of the newly-formed [[American Football Conference]].\n\n==League history==\nDuring the 1950s, the [[National Football League]] had grown to rival [[Major League Baseball]] as one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the United States. One franchise that did not share in this newfound success of the league was the [[Chicago Cardinals (NFL, 1920\u201359)|Chicago Cardinals]] \u2014 owned by the Bidwill family \u2014 who had become overshadowed by the more popular [[Chicago Bears]]. The Bidwills hoped to relocate their franchise, preferably to [[St. Louis]], but could not come to terms with the league on a relocation fee. Needing cash, the Bidwills began entertaining offers from would-be investors, and one of the men who approached the Bidwills was [[Lamar Hunt]], son and heir of millionaire oilman [[H. L. Hunt]].<ref>Gruver, ''The American Football League'', p. 9.</ref> Hunt offered to buy the Cardinals and move them to [[Dallas]], where he had grown up. However, these negotiations came to nothing, since the Bidwills insisted on retaining a controlling interest in the franchise and were unwilling to move their team to a city where a [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|previous NFL franchise]] had failed in [[1952 NFL season|1952]]. While Hunt negotiated with the Bidwills, similar offers were made by [[Bud Adams]], [[Bob Howsam]], and [[Max Winter]].<ref>Gruver, ''The American Football League'', p. 13.</ref>\n\nWhen Hunt, Adams, and Howsam were unable to secure a controlling interest in the Cardinals, they approached NFL commissioner [[Bert Bell]] and proposed the addition of [[expansion team]]s. Bell, wary of expanding the 12-team league and risking its newfound success, rejected the offer.<ref>Gruver, ''The American Football League'', pp. 13\u201314.</ref> On his return flight to Dallas, Hunt conceived the idea of an entirely new league and decided to contact the others who had shown interest in purchasing the Cardinals. He contacted Adams, Howsam, and Winter (as well as Winter's business partner, Bill Boyer) to gauge their interest in starting a new league. Hunt's first meeting with Adams was held in March 1959.<ref>Gruver, ''The American Football League'', p. 14.</ref> Hunt, who felt a regional rivalry would be critical for the success of the new league, convinced Adams to join and found his team in [[Houston]]. Hunt next secured an agreement from Howsam to bring a team to [[Denver]].<ref>Gruver, ''The American Football League'', pp. 15\u201316.</ref>\n\nAfter Winter and Boyer agreed to start a team in [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], the new league had its first four teams. Hunt then approached Willard Rhodes, who hoped to bring pro football to [[Seattle]]. However, the [[University of Washington]] was unwilling to let the fledgling league use [[Husky Stadium]], probably due to the excessive wear and tear that would have been caused to the facility's grass surface (the stadium now has an artificial surface, and Seattle would gain entry into the NFL in 1976 with the [[Seattle Seahawks]]). With no place for his team to play, Rhodes' effort came to nothing.<ref>Miller, ''Going Long'', pp. 3\u20134.</ref> Hunt also sought franchises in Los Angeles, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and New York City. During the summer of 1959, he sought the blessings of the NFL for his nascent league, as he did not seek a potentially costly rivalry. Within weeks of the July 1959 announcement of the league's formation, Hunt received commitments from [[Barron Hilton]] and [[Harry Wismer]] to bring teams to Los Angeles and New York, respectively.<ref name=\"chiefsafl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/ |title=Kansas City Chiefs History \u2013 AFL Origins |accessdate=2007-02-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205213037/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/ |archivedate=2007-02-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> His initial efforts for Buffalo, however, were rebuffed, when Hunt's first choice of owner, [[Pat McGroder]], declined to take part; McGroder had hoped that the threat of the AFL would be enough to prompt the NFL to expand to Buffalo.<ref>Warren, Matt.

On August 22 the league officially was named the American Football League at a meeting in Dallas. The NFL's initial reaction was not as openly hostile as it had been with the earlier [[All-America Football Conference]] (Bell had even given his public approval), yet individual NFL owners soon began a campaign to undermine the new league. AFL owners were approached with promises of new NFL franchises or ownership stakes in existing ones. Only the party from Minneapolis-Saint Paul accepted, and the Minnesota group joined the NFL the next year in 1961; the Minneapolis-Saint Paul group were joined by [[Ole Haugsrud]] and [[Bernie Ridder]] in the new NFL team's ownership group, which was named the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. The older league also announced on August 29 that it had conveniently reversed its position against expansion, and planned to bring NFL expansion teams to Houston and Dallas, to start play in 1961.<ref>Gruver, ''The American Football League'', pp. 22\u201323.</ref> (The NFL did not expand to Houston at that time, the promised Dallas team \u2013 the [[Dallas Cowboys]] \u2013 actually started play in 1960, and the Vikings began play in 1961.) Finally, the NFL quickly came to terms with the Bidwills and allowed them to relocate the struggling Cardinals to St. Louis, eliminating that city as a potential AFL market.\n\n[[Ralph Wilson]], who owned a minority interest in the NFL's [[Detroit Lions]] at the time, initially announced he was placing a team in [[Miami]], but like the Seattle situation, was also rebuffed by local ownership; given five other choices, Wilson negotiated with McGroder and brought the team that would become the [[Buffalo Bills|Bills]] to Buffalo. Buffalo was officially awarded its franchise on October 28. During a league meeting on November 22, a 10-man ownership group from [[Boston]] (led by [[Billy Sullivan (American football)|Billy Sullivan]]) was awarded the AFL's eighth team.<ref>Maiorana, ''Relentless'', p. 65.</ref> On November 30, 1959, [[Joe Foss]], a World War II [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[fighter ace]] and former governor of [[South Dakota]], was named the AFL's first commissioner. Foss commissioned a friend of Harry Wismer's to develop the AFL's eagle-on-football logo. Hunt was elected President of the AFL on January 26, 1960.\n\n===The AFL draft===\n{{further|American Football League draft}}\n\nThe AFL's first [[American Football League Draft|draft]] took place the same day Boston was awarded its franchise, and lasted 33 rounds. The league held a second draft on December 2, which lasted for 20 rounds.

In 1961, his team began play in the NFL as the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. [[Los Angeles Chargers]] owner Barron Hilton demanded that a replacement for Minnesota be placed in California, to reduce his team's operating costs and to create a rivalry. After a brief search, [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] was chosen and an ownership group led by [[F. Wayne Valley]] and local real estate developer [[Chet Soda]] was formed. After initially being called the Oakland ''\"Se\u00f1ores\"'', the [[Oakland Raiders]] officially joined the AFL on January 30, 1960.\n\nThe AFL's first major success came when the [[Houston Oilers]] signed [[Billy Cannon]], the All-American and 1959 [[Heisman Trophy]] winner from [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]]. Cannon signed a $100,000 contract to play for the Oilers, despite having already signed a $50,000 contract with the NFL's [[Los Angeles Rams]]. The Oilers filed suit and claimed that Rams general manager [[Pete Rozelle]] had unduly manipulated Cannon. The court upheld the Houston contract, and with Cannon the Oilers appeared in the AFL's first three championship games (winning two).<ref name=\"loup\">{{cite news |first=Rich |last=Loup |title=The AFL: A Football Legacy (Part One) |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_1/ |publisher=CNNSI.com |date=2001-01-22 |accessdate=2007-02-08 }}</ref><ref name=\"cannon\">{{cite news |first=Al |last=Carter |title=Oilers leave rich legacy of low-budget absurdity |url=http://texnews.com/texsports97/oilers063097.html |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |date=1997-06-30 |accessdate=2007-02-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106015329/http://texnews.com/texsports97/oilers063097.html |archivedate=6 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nOn June 9, 1960, the league signed a five-year television contract with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], which brought in revenues of approximately US$2,125,000 per year for the entire league.

Attendance for the 1960 season was respectable for a new league, but not nearly that of the NFL. In 1960, the NFL averaged attendance of more than 40,000 fans per game and more popular NFL teams in 1960 regularly saw attendance figures in excess of 50,000 per game,<ref>[http://www.profootballresearchers.org/archives/Website_Files/Coffin_Corner/13-04-430.pdf]</ref> while CFL attendances averaged approximately 20,000 per game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stats.cfldb.ca/league/cfl/attendance/1960|title=Canadian Football League 1960 Attendance on CFLdb Statistics|publisher=}}</ref> By comparison, AFL attendance averaged about 16,500 per game and generally hovered between 10,000-20,000 per game. Professional football was still primarily a gate-driven business in 1960, so low attendance meant financial losses. The Raiders, with a league-worst average attendance of just 9,612, lost $500,000 in their first year and only survived after receiving a $400,000 loan from Bills owner Ralph Wilson.<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite video |people=[[Steve Sabol]] (Executive Producer) |date=2004 |title=Raiders \u2013 The Complete History |medium=DVD |publisher=NFL Productions LLC}}</ref> In an early sign of stability, however, the AFL did not lose any teams after its first year of operation.

On January 29, 1964, the AFL signed a lucrative $36 million television contract with [[NBC]] (beginning in the 1965 season), which gave the league money it needed to compete with the NFL for players. Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney was quoted as saying to NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle that \"They don't have to call us 'Mister' anymore\".  A single-game attendance record was set on November 8, 1964, when 61,929 fans packed [[Shea Stadium]] to watch the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills.\n\nThe bidding war for players between the AFL and NFL escalated in 1965. The Chiefs drafted [[Kansas Jayhawks football|University of Kansas]] star [[Gale Sayers]] in the first round of the 1965 AFL draft (held November 28, 1964), while the Chicago Bears did the same in the NFL draft. Sayers eventually signed with the Bears.<ref name=\"kcsixties\" /> A similar situation occurred when the New York Jets and the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals both drafted University of Alabama quarterback [[Joe Namath]]. In what was viewed as a key victory for the AFL, Namath signed a $427,000 contract with the Jets on January 2, 1965 (the deal included a new car). It was the highest amount of money ever paid to a collegiate football player, and is cited as the strongest contributing factor to the eventual merger between the two leagues.<ref name=\"silverman\">{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Silverman |title=The 'Other' League |url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/media/misc/11_the_other_league.pdf |work=Pro Football Weekly |date=1994-11-07 |accessdate=2007-02-08 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605071617/http://www.kcchiefs.com/media/misc/11_the_other_league.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1963 season, the [[Orlando Panthers|Newark Bears]] of the [[Atlantic Coast Football League]] expressed interest in joining the AFL;<ref>{{cite news|title=Bears Seek Data on AFL|work=Asbury Park Press|agency=Associated Press|date=January 12, 1964}}</ref> concerns over having to split the New York metro area with the still-uncertain Jets were a factor in the Bears bid being rejected.

On May 6, after Atlanta's exit, Robbie secured an agreement with Miami mayor Robert King High to bring a team to Miami. League expansion was approved at a meeting held on June 7, and on August 16 the AFL's ninth franchise was officially awarded to Robbie and television star [[Danny Thomas]].

On April 7, Joe Foss resigned as AFL commissioner. His successor was Oakland Raiders head coach and general manager [[Al Davis]], who had been instrumental in turning around the fortunes of that franchise. No longer content with trying to outbid the NFL for college talent, the AFL under Davis started to recruit players already on NFL squads. Davis's strategy focused on quarterbacks in particular, and in two months he persuaded seven NFL quarterbacks to sign with the AFL.<ref>Dickey, pp. 38\u201339.</ref> Although Davis's intention was to help the AFL win the bidding war, some AFL and NFL owners saw the escalation as detrimental to both leagues. Alarmed with the rate of spending in the league, [[Hilton Hotels]] forced Barron Hilton to relinquish his stake in the Chargers as a condition of maintaining his leadership role with the hotel chain.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/30/sports/la-sp-dwyre30-2009nov30|title=Barron Hilton's Chargers turned short stay into long-term success|first=Bill|last=Dwyre|date=30 November 2009|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref>\n\nThe same month Davis was named commissioner, several NFL owners, along with Dallas Cowboys general manager Tex Schramm, secretly approached Lamar Hunt and other AFL owners and asked the AFL to merge. They held a series of secret meetings in Dallas to discuss their concerns over rapidly increasing player salaries, as well as the practice of player poaching. Hunt and Schramm completed the basic groundwork for a merger of the two leagues by the end of May, and on June 8, 1966, the merger was officially announced. Under the terms of the agreement, the two leagues would hold a common player draft. The agreement also called for a title game to be played between the champions of the respective leagues. The two leagues would be fully merged by 1970, NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] would remain as commissioner of the merged league, which would be named the NFL. Additional expansion teams would eventually be awarded by 1970 or soon thereafter to bring it to a 28-team league. The AFL also agreed to pay indemnities of $18 million to the NFL over 20 years. In protest, Davis resigned as AFL commissioner on July 25 rather than remain until the completion of the merger, and [[Milt Woodard]] was named [[president (corporate title)|president]] of the AFL,<ref name=\"silverman\" /><ref name=widoiafl>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KHhQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VBEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4057%2C4872186 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=UPI |title=Woodard in, Davis out in AFL |date=July 26, 1966 |page=2, part 2 }}</ref><ref name=\"cross\">{{cite news |first=B.

The perception of AFL inferiority forever changed on January 12, 1969, when the AFL Champion New York Jets shocked the heavily favored NFL Champion [[Baltimore Colts]] in [[Super Bowl III]]. The Colts, who entered the contest favored by as many as 18 points, had completed the [[1968 NFL season]] with a 13\u20131 record, and won the NFL title with a convincing 34\u20130 win over the Cleveland Browns.

When the two leagues merged in 1970, all ten AFL franchises and their statistics became part of the new NFL. Every other professional league that had competed against the NFL before the AFL\u2013NFL merger had folded completely: the three previous leagues named \"American Football League\" and the [[All-America Football Conference]]. From an earlier AFL (1936\u20131937), only the Cleveland Rams (now the [[Los Angeles Rams]]) joined the NFL and are currently operating, as are the [[Cleveland Browns]] and the [[San Francisco 49ers]] from the AAFC.  A third AAFC team, the [[Baltimore Colts (1947\u20131950)|Baltimore Colts]] (not related to the 1953\u20131983 Baltimore Colts or to the current Indianapolis Colts franchise), played only one year in the NFL, disbanding at the end of the 1950 season.<ref name=\"cross\" /> The league resulting from the merger was a 26-team juggernaut (since expanded to 32) with television rights covering all of the [[Big Three television networks]] and teams in close proximity to almost all of the top 40 metropolitan areas, a fact that has precluded any other competing league from gaining traction since the merger; failed attempts to mimic the AFL's success included the [[World Football League]] (1974\u201375), [[United States Football League]] (1983\u201385), [[XFL]] (2001) and [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]] (2009\u20132012).\n\nThe AFL was also the most successful of numerous upstart leagues of the 1960s and 1970s that attempted to challenge a major professional league's dominance. All nine teams that were in the AFL at the time the merger was agreed upon were accepted into the league intact (as was the tenth team added between the time of the merger's agreement and finalization), and none of the AFL's teams have ever folded. For comparison, the [[World Hockey Association]] (1972\u201379) managed to have four of its six remaining teams merged into the [[National Hockey League]], which actually caused the older league to contract a franchise, but WHA teams were forced to disperse the majority of their rosters and restart as expansion teams.  The merged WHA teams were also not financially sound (in large part from the hefty expansion fees the NHL imposed on them), and three of the four were forced to relocate within 20 years. The [[American Basketball Association]] (1967\u201376) managed to have only four of its teams merged into the National Basketball Association, and the rest of the league was forced to fold. Both the WHA and ABA lost several teams to financial insolvency over the course of their existences. The [[Continental League]], a proposed third league for [[Major League Baseball]] that was to begin play in 1961, never played a single game, largely because MLB responded to the proposal by expanding to four of that league's proposed cities. Historically, the only other professional sports league in the United States to exhibit a comparable level of franchise stability from its inception was the [[American League]] of [[Major League Baseball]].\n\n===Rule changes===\nThe NFL adopted some of the innovations introduced by the AFL immediately and a few others in the years following the merger. One was including the names on player jerseys. The older league also adopted the practice of using the stadium scoreboard clocks to keep track of the official game time, instead of just having a [[stopwatch]] used by the referee. The AFL played a 14-game schedule for its entire existence, starting in 1960. The NFL, which had played a 12-game schedule since 1947, changed to a 14-game schedule in 1961, a year after the American Football League instituted it. The AFL also introduced the [[two-point conversion]] to professional football thirty-four years before the NFL instituted it in 1994 (college football had adopted the two-point conversion in the late 1950s). All of these innovations pioneered by the AFL, including its more exciting style of play and colorful uniforms, have essentially made today's professional football more like the ''AFL'' than like the old-line NFL. The AFL's challenge to the NFL also laid the groundwork for the [[Super Bowl]], which has become the standard for championship contests in the United States of America.\n\n===Television===\nThe NFL also adapted how the AFL used the growing power of televised football games, which were bolstered with the help of major network contracts (first with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and later with [[NBC]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/our-history#decade_4|title==NBC gains broadcast rights to American Football League|last= |first= |date= |website=NBC Sports History Page|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>). With that first contract with ABC, the AFL adopted the first-ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds were divided equally among member clubs. It featured many outstanding games, such as the classic 1962 double-overtime American Football League championship game between the [[Dallas Texans (AFL)|Dallas Texans]] and the defending champion [[Houston Oilers]]. At the time it was the longest [[Professional American football championship games|professional football championship game]] ever played. The AFL also appealed to fans by offering a flashier style of play (just like the ABA in basketball), compared to the more conservative game of the NFL. Long passes (\"bombs\") were commonplace in AFL offenses, led by such talented quarterbacks as [[John Hadl]], [[Daryle Lamonica]] and [[Len Dawson]].\n\nDespite having a national television contract, the AFL often found itself trying to gain a foothold, only to come up against roadblocks. For example, CBS-TV, which broadcast NFL games, ignored and did not report scores from the innovative AFL, on orders from the NFL. It was only after the merger agreement was announced that CBS began to give AFL scores.\n\n===Expanding and reintroducing the sport to more cities===\nThe AFL took advantage of the burgeoning popularity of football by locating teams in major cities that lacked NFL franchises. Hunt's vision not only brought a new professional football league to [[California]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], but introduced the sport to [[Colorado]], restored it to [[Texas]] and later to fast-growing [[Florida]], as well as bringing it to [[New England]] for the first time in 12 years. Buffalo, having lost its [[Buffalo (NFL)|original NFL franchise]] in 1929 and turned down by the NFL at least twice (1940 and [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|1950]]) for a replacement, returned to the NFL with the merger. The return of football to Kansas City was the first time that city had seen professional football since the NFL's [[Kansas City Blues/Cowboys]] of the 1920s; the arrival of the Chiefs, and the contemporary arrival of the [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Football Cardinals]], brought professional football back to Missouri for the first time since the temporary [[St. Louis Gunners]] of 1934.\n\nIf not for the AFL, at least 17 of today's NFL teams would probably never have existed: the ten teams from the AFL, and seven clubs that were instigated by the AFL's presence to some degree. Three NFL franchises were awarded as a direct result of the AFL's competition with the older league: the Minnesota Vikings, who were awarded to Max Winter in exchange for dropping his bid to join the AFL; the Atlanta Falcons, whose franchise went to Rankin Smith to dissuade him from purchasing the AFL's [[Miami Dolphins]]; and the New Orleans Saints, because of successful anti-trust legislation which let the two leagues merge, and was supported by several Louisiana politicians.\n\nIn the case of the Dallas Cowboys, the NFL had long sought to return to the Dallas area after the [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]] folded in 1952, but was originally met with strong opposition by [[Washington Redskins]] owner [[George Preston Marshall]], who had enjoyed a monopoly as the only NFL team to represent the American South. Marshall later changed his position after future-Cowboys owner [[Clint Murchison]] bought the rights to Washington's fight song \"[[Hail to the Redskins]]\" and threatened to prevent Marshall from playing it at games. By then, the NFL wanted to quickly award the new Dallas franchise to Murchison so the team could immediately begin play and complete with the AFL's Texans. As a result, the Cowboys played its inaugural season in 1960 without the benefit of the [[1960 NFL Draft|NFL draft]].\n\nAs part of the merger agreement, additional expansion teams would be awarded by 1970 or soon thereafter to bring the league to 28 franchises; this requirement was fulfilled when the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] began play in 1976. In addition, had it not been for the existence of the Oilers from 1960 to 1996, the [[Houston Texans]] also would likely not exist today; the 2002 expansion team restored professional football in Houston after the original charter AFL member Oilers relocated to become the [[Tennessee Titans]].\n\nKevin Sherrington of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' has argued that the presence of AFL and the subsequent merger radically altered the fortunes of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], saving the team \"from stinking\".<ref name=\"DallasNews20110201\"/> Before the merger, the Steelers had long been one of the NFL's worst teams. Constantly lacking the money to build a quality team, the Steelers had only posted eight winning seasons, and just one playoff appearance, since their first year of existence in 1933 until the end of the 1969 season. They also finished with [[1969 NFL season|a 1-13 record in 1969]], tied with the [[Chicago Bears]] for the worst record in the NFL. The $3 million indemnity that the Steelers received for joining the AFC with the rest of the former AFL teams after the merger helped them rebuild into a contender, drafting eventual-[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]rs like [[Terry Bradshaw]] and [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]], and ultimately winning four Super Bowls in the 1970s.<ref name=\"DallasNews20110201\">{{cite web | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/super-bowl/the-game/20110201-sherrington-dallas-meeting-in-66-saved-steelers-from-stinking.ece | title=Dallas meeting in '66 saved Steelers from stinking | first=Kevin | last=Sherrington | work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] | date=2011-02-01 | accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> Since the 1970 merger, the Steelers have the NFL's highest winning percentage, the most total victories, the most trips to either conference championship game, are tied for the second most trips to the [[Super Bowl]] (with the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Denver Broncos]], trailing only the [[New England Patriots]]), and have won an NFL-record six Super Bowl championships.\n\n===Effects on players===\nPerhaps the greatest social legacy of the AFL was the [[domino effect]] of its policy of being more liberal than the entrenched NFL in offering opportunity for [[Black players in American professional football|black players]]. While the NFL was still emerging from thirty years of segregation influenced by Washington Redskins' owner [[George Preston Marshall]], the AFL actively recruited from small and predominantly black colleges. The AFL's color-blindness led not only to the explosion of black talent on the field, but to the eventual entry of blacks into scouting, coordinating, and ultimately head coaching positions, long after the league ceased to exist.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[James \"Jim\" Acho|Jim Acho]] | title=The \"Foolish Club\" | publisher=Gridiron Press | year=1997 | oclc=38596883 }} Foreword by [[Miller Farr]].</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Charles K. Ross | title=Outside the Lines: African Americans and the Integration of the National Football League | publisher=New York University Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-8147-7495-4 }}</ref>\n\nThe AFL's free agents came from several sources. Some were players who could not find success playing in the NFL, while another source was the [[Canadian Football League]]. In the late 1950s, many players released by the NFL, or un-drafted and unsigned out of college by the NFL, went North to try their luck with the CFL, and later returned to the states to play in the AFL.\n\nIn the league's first years, players such as Oilers' [[George Blanda]], Chargers/Bills' [[Jack Kemp]], Texans' [[Len Dawson]], the NY Titans' [[Don Maynard]], Raiders/Patriots/Jets' [[Babe Parilli]], Pats' [[Bob Dee]] proved to be AFL standouts. Other players such as the Broncos' [[Frank Tripucka]], the Pats' [[Gino Cappelletti]], the Bills' [[Cookie Gilchrist]] and the Chargers' [[Tobin Rote]], [[Sam DeLuca]] and [[Dave Kocourek]] also made their mark to give the fledgling league badly needed credibility. Rounding out this mix of potential talent were the true \"free agents\", the walk-ons and the \"wanna-be's\", who tried out in droves for the chance to play professional American football.\n\nAfter the AFL\u2013NFL merger agreement in 1966, and after the AFL's [[New York Jets|Jets]] defeated the \"best team in the history of the NFL\", the Colts, a popular misconception fostered by the NFL and spread by media reports was that the AFL defeated the NFL because of the [[Common Draft]] instituted in 1967. This apparently was meant to assert that the AFL could not achieve parity as long as it had to compete with the NFL in the draft. But the 1968 Jets had less than a handful of \"common draftees\". Their stars were honed in the AFL, many of them since the Titans days. As noted below, the AFL got its share of stars long before the \"common draft\".\n\nPlayers who chose the AFL to develop their talent included [[Lance Alworth]] and [[Ron Mix]] of the [[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]], who had also been drafted by the NFL's [[San Francisco 49ers]] and [[Baltimore Colts]] respectively. Both eventually were elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] after earning recognition during their careers as being among the best at their positions. Among specific teams, the 1964 [[Buffalo Bills]] stood out by holding their opponents to a pro football record 913 yards rushing on 300 attempts, while also recording fifty quarterback sacks in a 14-game schedule.\n\nAnother example is cited by the [[University of Kansas]] website, which describes the 1961 [[Bluebonnet Bowl]], won by KU, and goes on to say ''\"Two Kansas players, quarterback [[John Hadl]] and fullback [[Curtis McClinton]], signed professional contracts on the field immediately after the conclusion of the game. Hadl inked a deal with the ''[AFL]'' [[San Diego Chargers]], and McClinton went to the ''[AFL]'' [[Dallas Texans (AFL)|Dallas Texans]].\"'' Between them, in their careers Hadl and McClinton combined for an [[American Football League Rookies of the Year|American Football League Rookie of the Year]] award, seven [[American Football League All-Star games|AFL All-Star]] selections, two Pro Bowl selections, a team MVP award, two [[American Football League All-Star games|AFL All-Star Game]] MVP awards, two [[American Football League playoffs#1962 Championship|AFL championships]], and a [[Professional American football championship games|World Championship]]. And these were players selected by the AFL long ''before'' the \"Common Draft\".\n\nIn 2009, a five-part series, ''[[Full Color Football: The History of the American Football League]]'', on the ''[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] Network'', refuted many of the long-held misconceptions about the AFL. In it, [[Abner Haynes]] tells of how his father forbade him to accept being drafted by the NFL, after drunken scouts from that league had visited the Haynes home; the NFL Cowboys' Tex Schramm is quoted as saying that if his team had ever agreed to play the AFL's [[Dallas Texans (AFL)|Dallas Texans]], they would very likely have lost; [[George Blanda]] makes a case for more AFL players being inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame by pointing out that Hall of Famer [[Willie Brown (American football)|Willie Brown]] was cut by the [[Houston Oilers]] because he couldn't cover Oilers flanker [[Charlie Hennigan]] in practice. Later, when Brown was with the Broncos, Hennigan needed nine catches in one game against the Broncos to break [[Lionel Taylor]]'s Professional Football record of 100 catches in one season. Hennigan caught the nine passes and broke the record, even though he was covered by Brown, Blanda's point being that if Hennigan could do so well against a Hall of Fame DB, he deserves induction, as well.\n\n===Influence on professional football coaching===\nThe AFL also spawned coaches whose style and techniques have profoundly affected the play of professional football to this day. In addition to AFL greats like [[Hank Stram]], [[Lou Saban]], [[Sid Gillman]] and [[Al Davis]] were eventual hall of fame coaches such as [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]], a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Davis with the AFL [[Oakland Raiders]] for one season; and [[Chuck Noll]], who worked for Gillman and the AFL [[San Diego Chargers|LA/San Diego Chargers]] from 1960 through 1965. Others include [[Buddy Ryan]] (AFL's [[New York Jets]]), [[Chuck Knox]] (Jets), [[Walt Michaels]] (Jets), and [[John Madden]] (AFL's [[Oakland Raiders]]). Additionally, many prominent coaches began their pro football careers as players in the AFL, including [[Sam Wyche]] ([[Cincinnati Bengals]]), [[Marty Schottenheimer]] ([[Buffalo Bills]]), [[Wayne Fontes]] (Jets), and two-time Super Bowl winner [[Tom Flores]] ([[Oakland Raiders]]). Flores also has a Super Bowl ring as a player ([[1969 AFL season|1969]] [[Kansas City Chiefs]]).\n\n==AFL 50th Anniversary Celebration==\n[[File:AFL 50th logo.jpg|thumb|185px|right|AFL 50th Anniversary Logo]]\n{{main|2009 NFL season}}\nAs the influence of the AFL continues through the present, the 50th anniversary of its launch was celebrated during [[2009 NFL season|2009]]. The season-long celebration began in August with the 2009 [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]] in [[Canton, Ohio]] between two AFC teams (as opposed to the AFC-vs-NFC format the game first adopted in 1971). The opponents were two of the original AFL franchises, the [[Buffalo Bills]] and [[Tennessee Titans]] (the former [[Houston Oilers]]). Bills' owner [[Ralph C. Wilson Jr.]] (a 2009 Hall of Fame inductee) and Titans' owner [[Bud Adams]] were the only surviving members of the [[Foolish Club]] at the time (both are now deceased), the eight original owners of AFL franchises.\n\nThe Hall of Fame Game was the first of several \"Legacy Weekends\", during which each of the \"original eight\" AFL teams sported uniforms from their AFL era. Each of the 8 teams took part in at least two such \"legacy\" games. [[List of American Football League officials|On-field officials]] also wore red-and-white-striped AFL uniforms during these games.\n\nIn the fall of 2009, the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] pay-cable network premiered ''[[Full Color Football: The History of the American Football League]]'', a 5-part documentary series produced by [[NFL Films]] that features vintage game film and interviews as well as more recent interviews with those associated with the AFL.\n\nThe NFL sanctioned a variety of ''\"Legacy\"'' gear to celebrate the AFL anniversary, such as \"throwback\" jerseys, T-shirts, signs, pennants and banners, including items with the logos and colors of the [[Dallas Texans (AFL)|Dallas Texans]], [[Houston Oilers]], and [[New York Titans (football)|New York Titans]], the three of the [[Foolish Club|Original Eight]] AFL teams which have changed names or venues. A December 5, 2009 story by Ken Belson in ''[[The New York Times]]'' quotes league officials as stating that AFL ''\"Legacy\"'' gear made up twenty to thirty percent of the league's annual $3 billion merchandise income. Fan favorites were the [[Denver Broncos]]' vertically striped socks, which could not be re-stocked quickly enough.\n\n==AFL franchises==\n{{Location map+ |United States |width=600 |float=center |caption=Locations of AFL teams. |places=\n\t{{Location map~ |United States |lat=29.762778 |long=-95.383056 |label=[[Houston Oilers|Houston]]|position=bottom |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n\t{{Location map~ |United States |lat=42.3601 |long=-71.0589 |label=[[New England Patriots|Boston]]|position=right |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n\t{{Location map~ |United States |lat=32.7767 |long=-96.7970 |label=[[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas]]|position=left |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n        {{Location map~ |United States |lat=42.8864 |long=-78.8784 |label=[[Buffalo Bills|Buffalo]]|position=bottom |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n\t{{Location map~ |United States |lat=39.7392 |long=-104.9903 |label=[[Denver Broncos|Denver]]|position=bottom |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n\t{{Location map~ |United States |lat=37.8044 |long=-122.2711 |label=[[Oakland Raiders|Oakland]]|position=right |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n\t{{Location map~ |United States |lat=32.7157 |long=-117.1611 |label=[[San Diego Chargers|San Diego]]|position=left |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n\t{{Location map~ |United States |lat=39.0997 |long=-94.5786 |label=[[Kansas City Chiefs|Kansas City]]|position=bottom |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n        {{Location map~ |United States |lat=40.7128 |long=-74.0060 |label=[[New York Jets|New York]]|position=right |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n        {{Location map~ |United States |lat=34.05 |long=-118.35|label=[[Los Angeles Chargers|Los Angeles]]|position=top |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n        {{Location map~ |United States |lat=25.7617 |long=-80.1918 |label=[[Miami Dolphins|Miami]]|position=top |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n        {{Location map~ |United States |lat=39.1031 |long=-84.5120 |label=[[Cincinnati Bengals|Cincinnati]]|position=top |mark=Blue pog.svg}}\n}}\n\n{|class=\"navbox wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Division\n!Team\n!First Season\n!Home Stadium\n!AFL Record (W-L-T)<ref>Includes postseason games.</ref>\n!AFL Titles\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Destiny after the merger\n|-\n|rowspan=5|Eastern\n|[[Boston Patriots]]\n|align=\"center\" |1960\n|[[Nickerson Field]] ([[1960 American Football League season|1960]]\u2013[[1962 American Football League season|1962]]), [[Fenway Park]] ([[1963 American Football League season|1963]]\u2013[[1968 American Football League season|1968]]), [[Alumni Stadium]] ([[1969 American Football League season|1969]])\n|align=\"center\" |64\u201369\u20139\n|align=\"center\" |0\n|Still active in the [[Greater Boston]] area.

Additionally, the Bengals now play in the [[AFC North]] and the [[Tennessee Titans]] (formerly the Oilers) play in the [[AFC South]].\n\nAs of the [[2017 NFL season]], the [[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum]] and the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] are the last remaining active NFL stadiums that had been used by the AFL, with the remaining stadiums either being used for other uses (the former San Diego Stadium, [[Fenway Park]], [[Nickerson Field]], [[Alumni Stadium]], [[Nippert Stadium]], the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]], [[Balboa Stadium]] and [[Kezar Stadium]]), still standing but currently vacant ([[Houston Astrodome]]), or demolished. By the [[2020 NFL season]], both stadiums will be retired as the Raiders will move into a [[Las Vegas Stadium|newly-built stadium]] in [[Las Vegas]] while the [[Los Angeles Rams]] will move into the all-new [[Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park]].\n\n==AFL playoffs==\n{{Details|American Football League playoffs}}\nFrom 1960 to 1968, the AFL determined its champion via a single-elimination playoff game between the winners of its two divisions. The home teams alternated each year by division, so in 1968 the Jets hosted the Raiders, even though Oakland had a better record (this was changed in 1969). In 1963, the Buffalo Bills and Boston Patriots finished tied with identical records of 7\u20136\u20131 in the AFL East Division. There was no tie-breaker protocol in place, so a one-game playoff was held in War Memorial Stadium in December. The visiting Patriots defeated the host Bills 26\u20138. The Patriots traveled to San Diego as the Chargers completed a three-game season sweep over the weary Patriots with a 51\u201310 victory. A similar situation occurred in the 1968 season, when the Oakland Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs finished the regular season tied with identical records of 12\u20132 in the AFL West Division. The Raiders beat the Chiefs 41\u20136 in a division playoff to qualify for the AFL Championship Game. In 1969, the final year of the independent AFL, Professional Football's first \"[[Wild card (sports)|wild card]]\" playoffs were conducted. A four-team playoff was held, with the second-place teams in each division playing the winner of the other division. The Chiefs upset the Raiders in Oakland 17\u20137 in the league's Championship, the final AFL game played. The Kansas City Chiefs were the first Super Bowl champion to win two road playoff games and the first wildcard team to win the Super Bowl, although the term \"wildcard\" was coined by the media, and not used officially until several years later.\n\n==AFL Championship Games==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\"\n|bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"|'''Eastern Division'''\n|bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|'''Western Division'''\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\" class=\"sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n<!--! class=\"unsortable\" | Shield-->\n!width=5%|Season\n!width=14%|Date\n!width=12%|Winning Team\n!width=7%|Score\n!width=14%|Losing Team\n!width=10%|MVP\n!width=20%|Venue\n!width=5%|Attendance\n|-\n|align=center|[[1960 American Football League Championship Game|1960]]\n|January 1, 1961\n|bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"|[[1960 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]]\n|24\u201316\n|bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|[[1960 Los Angeles Chargers season|Los Angeles Chargers]]\n|[[Billy Cannon]]\n|[[Jeppesen Stadium]]\n|align=center|32,183\n|-\n|align=center|[[1961 American Football League Championship Game|1961]]\n|December 24, 1961\n|bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"|[[1961 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] (2)\n|10\u20133\n|bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|[[1961 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]]\n|Billy Cannon\n|[[Balboa Stadium]]\n|align=center|29,556\n|-\n|align=center|[[1962 American Football League Championship Game|1962]]\n|December 23, 1962\n|bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|[[1962 Dallas Texans season|Dallas Texans]]\n|20\u201317 (2OT)\n|bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"|[[1962 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]]\n|[[Jack Spikes]]\n|Jeppesen Stadium (2)\n|align=center|37,981\n|-\n|align=center|[[1963 American Football League playoffs|1963]]\n|January 5, 1964\n|bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|[[1963 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]]\n|51\u201310\n|bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"|[[1963 Boston Patriots season|Boston Patriots]]\n|[[Keith Lincoln]]\n|Balboa Stadium (2)\n|align=center|30,127\n|-\n|align=center|[[1964 American Football League Championship Game|1964]]\n|December 26, 1964\n|bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"|[[1964 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]]\n|20\u20137\n|bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|[[1964 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]]\n|[[Jack Kemp]]\n|[[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]]\n|align=center|40,242\n|-\n|align=center|[[1965 American Football League Championship Game|1965]]\n| December 26, 1965\n|bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"|[[1965 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] (2)\n|23\u20130\n|bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|[[1965 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]]\n|Jack Kemp\n|Balboa Stadium (3)\n|align=center|30,361\n|-\n|align=center|[[1966 American Football League Championship Game|1966]]\n|January 1, 1967\n|bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|''[[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]]'' (2)\n|31\u20137\n|bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"|[[1966 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]]\n|[[Len Dawson]]\n|War Memorial Stadium (2)\n|align=center|42,080\n|-\n|align=center|[[1967 American Football League Championship Game|1967]]\n|December 31, 1967\n|bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|''[[1967 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]''\n|40\u20137\n|bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"|[[1967 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]]\n|[[Daryle Lamonica]]\n|[[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum]]\n|align=center|53,330\n|-\n|align=center|[[1968 American Football League Championship Game|1968]]\n| December 29, 1968\n|bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"|'''''[[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]]'''''\n|27\u201323\n|bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|[[1968 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]\n|[[Joe Namath]]\n|[[Shea Stadium]]\n|align=center|62,627\n|-\n|align=center|[[1969 American Football League Championship Game|1969]]\n|January 4, 1970\n|bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|'''''[[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]]''''' (3)\n|17\u20137\n|bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|[[1969 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]\n|[[Otis Taylor (American football)|Otis Taylor]]\n|Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum (2)\n|align=center|53,561\n|-\n|}\n\n''Italics'' \u2013 Super Bowl Appearance, '''Bold''' \u2013 Super Bowl Victory\n\n==AFL All-Star games==\n{{Details|American Football League All-Star game}}\n\nThe AFL did not play an All-Star game after its first season in 1960, but did stage All-Star games for the 1961 through 1969 seasons. All-Star teams from the Eastern and Western divisions played each other after every season except 1965.

Founded by a merger in 1927, Roma have participated in the top-tier of Italian football for all of their existence except for [[1951\u201352 Serie B|1951\u201352]].\n\nRoma have won [[Serie A]] three times, in [[1941\u201342 Serie A|1941\u201342]], [[1982\u201383 Serie A|1982\u201383]] and [[2000\u201301 Serie A|2000\u201301]], as well as winning nine [[Coppa Italia]] titles and two [[Supercoppa Italiana]] titles. In European competitions, Roma won the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] in [[1960\u201361 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1960\u201361]] and were runners-up in the [[1983\u201384 European Cup]] and the [[1990\u201391 UEFA Cup]]. \n\nFifteen players have won the [[FIFA World Cup]] while playing at Roma: Ferraris, Guaita and Masetti (1934); Donati, Monzeglio and Serantoni (1938); [[Bruno Conti]] (1982); [[Rudi Voller]] and Berthold (1990); Aldair (1994); Candela (1998); [[Cafu]] (2002); [[Daniele De Rossi]], [[Simone Perrotta]] and [[Francesco Totti]] (2006).\n\nSince 1953, Roma have played their home matches at the [[Stadio Olimpico]], a venue they share with city rivals [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]]. With a capacity of over 72,000, it is the [[List of football stadiums in Italy|second-largest]] of its kind in Italy, with only the [[San Siro]] able to seat more. The club plan to move to a [[Stadio della Roma|new stadium]], though this is yet to start construction.\n\nThe club's home colours are [[Tyrian purple]] and gold, which gives Roma their nickname \"''I Giallorossi''\" (\"The Yellow and Reds\").

This rounded out a highly successful decade in Roma's history, following somewhat mediocre results of the 1990s. During the 2000s, Roma had finally recaptured the ''Scudetto'', two Coppa Italia trophies, and their first two Supercoppa Italiana titles. Other notable contributions to the club's history have included a return to the Champions League quarter-finals (in the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League|2006\u201307]] and [[2007\u201308 UEFA Champions League|2007\u201308]] editions) since 1984, six runners up positions in the league, four Coppa Italia finals and three Supercoppa finals \u2013 marking Roma's greatest ever decade.\n\n====The \"AS Roma SPV LLC\" era====\nIn the summer of 2010, the Sensi family agreed to relinquish their control of Roma as part of a debt-settlement agreement. This brought an end to the presidential reign of the Sensi family, who had presided over the club since 1993. Until a new owner was appointed, Rosella Sensi would continue her directorial role of the club. The [[2010\u201311 A.S. Roma season|2010\u201311 season]] had once again seen Roma start off with mixed fortunes on both a domestic and European level. These included losses against [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]], [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]] and a 2\u20130 defeat against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in the group stages of the Champions League, a match which saw manager [[Claudio Ranieri]] openly criticised by his players. However, these were accompanied by victories against Inter and a sensational victory against Bayern Munich in the return fixture, which saw Roma fight back from 0\u20132 down at half-time to emerge as 3\u20132 winners. Following a series of poor results which saw Roma engage in a winless-streak of five consecutive matches, Ranieri resigned as head coach in February 2011, and former striker [[Vincenzo Montella]] was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. It was also during this season that Roma icon Francesco Totti scored his 200th Serie A goal against [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] in March 2011, becoming only the sixth ever player to achieve such a feat.\n[[File:Francesco Totti Chelsea vs AS-Roma 10AUG2013.jpg|thumb|left|[[Francesco Totti]], the [[List of A.S.

UniCredit later disinvested NEEP Roma Holding to sell to \"AS Roma SPV, LLC\" and Pallotta.\n\nThe new ownership immediately went into effect by making significant changes in the club, hiring [[Walter Sabatini]] as director of football and former [[Spain national football team|Spanish international]] and [[FC Barcelona B|Barcelona B]] coach [[Luis Enrique (footballer)|Luis Enrique]] as manager.

After the formal takeover on 18 August, Roma bought forward [[Dani Osvaldo]], midfielders [[Miralem Pjani\u0107]] and [[Fernando Gago]] and defender [[Simon Kj\u00e6r]], as well as youngster [[Fabio Borini]], which cost the club more than \u20ac40&nbsp;million. In 2012, Pallotta became the new president.\n\nThe 2012\u201313 pre-season started with the June hiring of former manager [[Zden\u011bk Zeman]]. Zeman replaced Luis Enrique who resigned at the end of the 2011\u201312 season. Luis Enrique's lone season reign had seen the disappointing loss to [[\u0160K Slovan Bratislava|Slovan Bratislava]] in the [[2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]], as well as the inability to qualify for international competitions for the 2012\u201313 season.

Zeman brought back his high-scoring 4\u20133\u20133 formation and his hard working ethic which successfully guided former team [[Delfino Pescara 1936|Pescara]] to the Serie A. However, he was sacked on 2 February 2013. He was replaced by caretaker manager [[Aurelio Andreazzoli]], whose reign saw the continuation of a disappointing season, with the team ending up in sixth place in Serie A, while also losing 1\u20130 to rivals Lazio in the [[2012\u201313 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] final.

NEEP, itself a joint venture, was held by DiBenedetto AS Roma LLC (later renamed to AS Roma SPV, LLC) and [[Unicredit]] in 60\u201340 ratio from 2011 to 2013, which the former had four real person shareholders in equal ratio, led by future Roma president [[Thomas R.

Abu Nidal then moved to [[Ba'athist Iraq]] where he set up the ANO, which soon began a vicious string of terrorist attacks.\n\nIt hasn't clearly defined its ideological position, but was clearly opposed to any form of compromise or negotiation with Israel. It is known as one of the most uncompromisingly militant Palestinian groups ever. It had an estimated membership of several hundred, but its strength today is not known.\n\n==ANO attacks==\n{{main|List of attacks attributed to Abu Nidal|Abu Nidal internal executions}}\nThe ANO carried out attacks in 20 countries, killing or injuring almost 1,650 persons. Targets include the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Israel, moderate [[Palestinian diaspora|Palestinians]], the [[PLO]], and various [[Arab world|Arab]] and European countries. The group has not attacked Western targets since the late 1980s.\n\nMajor attacks included the [[Rome and Vienna Airport Attacks]] in December 1985, the [[Neve Shalom synagogue]] in [[Istanbul]] and the [[Pan Am Flight 73]] hijacking in [[Karachi]] in September 1986, and the ''[[City of Poros (ship)|City of Poros]]'' day-excursion ship attack in Greece in July 1988.\n\nThe ANO has been especially noted for its uncompromising stance on negotiation with Israel, treating anything less than all-out military struggle against Israel as treachery. This led the group to perform numerous attacks against the PLO, which had made clear it accepted a negotiated solution to the conflict. Fatah-RC is believed to have assassinated PLO deputy chief [[Abu Iyad]] and PLO security chief Abu Hul in [[Tunis]] in January 1991. It assassinated a [[Jordan]]ian diplomat in [[Lebanon]] in January 1994 and has been linked to the killing of the PLO representative there. Noted PLO moderate [[Issam Sartawi]] was killed by the Fatah-RC in 1983. In the late 1970s, the group also made failed assassination attempt on the present Palestinian [[President of the Palestinian National Authority|president]] and PLO chairman, [[Mahmoud Abbas]]. These attacks, and numerous others, led to the PLO issuing a death sentence ''in absentia'' against Abu Nidal. In the early 1990s, it made an attempt to gain control of a refugee camp in [[Lebanon]], but this was thwarted by PLO organizations.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Abu Nidal]]\n*[[Arab People's Movement]]\n*[[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2203099.stm Abu Nidal: Ruthless maverick]\n\n[[Category:Abu Nidal]]\n[[Category:Arab nationalist militant groups]]\n[[Category:Nationalist terrorism in Europe]]\n[[Category:Organisations designated as terrorist by the European Union]]\n[[Category:Organizations designated as terrorist in Asia]]\n[[Category:Organisations designated as terrorist by the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by the United States]]\n[[Category:Organizations designated as terrorist]]\n[[Category:Palestinian militant groups]]\n[[Category:Organisations designated as terrorist by Japan]]", "sha1": "r6px0k301o83js7w82ds29bqlel6vl8"}}, {"title": "Antibody", "ns": "0", "id": "2362", "revision": {"id": "866116629", "parentid": "865519230", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T10:30:01Z", "contributor": {"username": "Lichessacc2", "id": "33639015"}, "comment": "/* {{anchor|CDRs, Fv, Fab and Fc Regions}}CDRs, Fv, Fab and Fc regions */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the class of proteins}}\n[[File:Antibody.svg|thumb|255px|Each antibody binds to a specific [[antigen]]; an interaction similar to a lock and key.]]\n\nAn '''antibody''' ('''Ab'''), also known as an '''immunoglobulin''' ('''Ig'''),<ref name=Rhoades>{{cite book |vauthors=Rhoades RA, Pflanzer RG | title = Human Physiology | edition = 4th | publisher = Thomson Learning | year = 2002 |page=584 | isbn = 978-0-534-42174-8}}</ref> is a large, Y-shaped [[protein]] produced mainly by [[plasma cell]]s that is used by the [[immune system]] to neutralize [[pathogen]]s such as [[pathogenic bacteria]] and [[Viral disease|viruses]].

Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds.

Each paratope locus is also polymorphic, such that during antibody production, one allele of V, one of D, and one of J is chosen. These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope. The regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hyper variable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis.\n\nAntibody genes also re-organize in a process called [[Immunoglobulin class switching|class switching]] that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region.

An antigen usually contains different epitopes along its surface arranged discontinuously, and dominant epitopes on a given antigen are called determinants.\n\nAntibody and antigen interact by spatial complementarity (lock and key). The molecular forces involved in the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific \u2013 for example [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic forces]], [[hydrogen bond]]s, [[hydrophobic interactions]], and [[van der Waals force]]s. This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also means it is possible for an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.\n\nOften, once an antibody and antigen bind, they become an [[immune complex]], which functions as a unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies.

Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine their class effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This infers different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).\n\n== Function ==\n{{further|Immune system}}\n\nThe main categories of antibody action include the following:\n\n[[File:Antibody Opsonization.svg|thumb|1) Antibodies (A) and pathogens (B) free roam in the blood. 2) The antibodies bind to pathogens, and can do so in different formations such as: opsonization (2a), neutralisation (2b), and agglutination (2c). 3) A phagocyte (C) approaches the pathogen, and the Fc region (D) of the antibody binds to one of the Fc receptors (E) of the phagocyte. 4) Phagocytosis occurs as the pathogen is ingested.]]\n\n* [[Neutralisation (immunology)|Neutralisation]], in which [[neutralizing antibody|neutralizing antibodies]] block parts of the surface of a bacterial cell or virion to render its attack ineffective\n* [[Agglutination (biology)|Agglutination]], in which antibodies \"glue together\" foreign cells into clumps that are attractive targets for [[phagocytosis]]\n* [[Precipitation (chemistry)|Precipitation]], in which antibodies \"glue together\" [[blood serum|serum]]-soluble antigens, forcing them to precipitate out of solution in clumps that are attractive targets for [[phagocytosis]]\n* [[Complement system#Overview|Complement activation]] (fixation), in which antibodies that are latched onto a foreign cell encourage complement to attack it with a [[membrane attack complex]], which leads to the following:\n** [[Lysis]] of the foreign cell \n** Encouragement of [[inflammation]] by [[chemotaxis|chemotactically]] attracting inflammatory cells\n\nActivated B cells [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into either antibody-producing cells called [[plasma cell]]s that secrete soluble antibody or [[memory B cell|memory cells]] that survive in the body for years afterward in order to allow the immune system to remember an antigen and respond faster upon future exposures.<ref name=\"pmid17337763\"/>\n\nAt the [[prenatal]] and neonatal stages of life, the presence of antibodies is provided by [[passive immunization]] from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within the first years of life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said to be part of the [[humoral immune system]]. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one [[antigen]] (an example is a [[virus]] [[capsid|capsid protein]] fragment). Antibodies contribute to [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by [[macrophages]] and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other [[immune response]]s such as the [[complement system|complement pathway]].<ref name=Ravetch>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ravetch JV, Bolland S | title = IgG Fc receptors | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 275\u201390 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11244038 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.immunol.19.1.275 }}</ref> Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).\n\n[[File:IgM white background.png|thumb|left|The secreted mammalian [[IgM]] has five Ig units.

By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate effector functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region.<ref name=Pier/>\n\nThose cells that recognize coated pathogens have Fc receptors, which, as the name suggests, interact with the [[Fc region]] of IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies. The engagement of a particular antibody with the Fc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell; phagocytes will [[phagocytosis|phagocytose]], [[mast cell]]s and [[neutrophil]]s will [[degranulation|degranulate]], [[natural killer cell]]s will release [[cytokine]]s and [[cytotoxic]] molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading microbe.

Initially, naive B cells express only cell-surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions. Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function; therefore, after activation, an antibody with an IgG, IgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen. Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged.

This information is used for [[protein engineering]], modifying the antigen binding affinity, and identifying an epitope, of a given antibody. [[X-ray crystallography]] is one commonly used method for determining antibody structures. However, crystallizing an antibody is often laborious and time-consuming. Computational approaches provide a cheaper and faster alternative to crystallography, but their results are more equivocal, since they do not produce empirical structures.

They are usually artificial peptides or proteins with a molar mass of about 3 to 20 kDa. Nucleic acids and small molecules are sometimes considered antibody mimetics, but not artificial antibodies, antibody fragments and fusion proteins are composed from these. Common advantages over antibodies are better solubility, tissue penetration, stability towards heat and enzymes, and comparatively low production costs. Antibody mimetics such as the [[Affimer]] and the [[DARPin]] have being developed and commercialised as research, diagnostic and therapeutic agents.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gebauer M, Skerra A | title = Engineered protein scaffolds as next-generation antibody therapeutics | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 245\u201355 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19501012 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.04.627 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Affimer]]\n* [[Antibody mimetic]]\n* [[Anti-mitochondrial antibodies]]\n* [[Anti-nuclear antibodies]]\n* [[Aptamer]]\n* [[Colostrum]]\n* [[ELISA]]\n* [[Humoral immunity]]\n* [[Immunology]]\n* [[Immunosuppressive drug]]\n* [[Intravenous immunoglobulin]] (IVIg)\n* [[Magnetic immunoassay]]\n* [[Microantibody]]\n* [[Monoclonal antibody]]\n* [[Neutralizing antibody]]\n* [[Secondary antibodies]]\n* [[Single-domain antibody]]\n* [[Slope spectroscopy]]\n* [[Western blot normalization]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|32em|refs=\n<ref name=\"immune_glycan\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Maverakis E, Kim K, Shimoda M, Gershwin ME, Patel F, Wilken R, Raychaudhuri S, Ruhaak LR, Lebrilla CB | title = Glycans in the immune system and The Altered Glycan Theory of Autoimmunity: a critical review | journal = Journal of Autoimmunity | volume = 57 | issue = 6 | pages = 1\u201313 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25578468 | pmc = 4340844 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaut.2014.12.002 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Antibodies}}\n<!--===========================({{No more links}})===============================-->\n<!--| DO ''not'' ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

He is considered the founder of the [[Neapolitan school]] of opera. He was the father of two other composers, [[Domenico Scarlatti]] and [[Pietro Filippo Scarlatti]].<ref name=\"britannica\"/>\n\n==Life==\nScarlatti was born in [[Palermo]] (or in [[Trapani]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13515a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Alessandro Scarlatti|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=5 February 2018}}</ref><ref> [https://books.google.it/books?id=Hr7nxaZ5cCEC&pg=PP11&lpg=PP11&dq=alessandro+scarlatti+trapani+1659&source=bl&ots=raENxxw0Sa&sig=kyBbP25CbpKpvj8MrLTbXiyvzBs&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjknur3o9jRAhXCNxQKHRIoAoYQ6AEILzAD#v=onepage&q=alessandro%20scarlatti%20trapani%201659&f=false Alfred Music, ''Anthology of Italian Songs'' (17th & 18th Century), Volume I: Vocal Collection]\n</ref>), then part of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. He is generally said to have been a pupil of [[Giacomo Carissimi]] in [[Rome]], and some theorize that he had some connection with northern Italy because his early works seem to show the influence of [[Alessandro Stradella|Stradella]] and [[Giovanni Legrenzi|Legrenzi]]. The production at Rome of his opera ''Gli equivoci nel sembiante'' (1679) gained him the support of Queen [[Christina of Sweden]] (who at the time was living in Rome), and he became her ''maestro di cappella''. In February 1684 he became ''maestro di cappella'' to the [[viceroy]] of [[Naples]], perhaps through the influence of his sister, an opera singer, who might have been the mistress of an influential Neapolitan noble. Here he produced a long series of operas, remarkable chiefly for their fluency and expressiveness, as well as other music for state occasions.\n\nIn 1702 Scarlatti left Naples and did not return until the Spanish domination had been superseded by that of the Austrians. In the interval he enjoyed the patronage of [[Ferdinando (III) de' Medici|Ferdinando de' Medici]], for whose private theatre near [[Florence]] he composed operas, and of [[Cardinal Ottoboni]], who made him his ''maestro di cappella'', and procured him a similar post at the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome in 1703.\n\nAfter visiting [[Venice]] and [[Urbino]] in 1707, Scarlatti took up his duties in Naples again in 1708, and remained there until 1717. By this time Naples seems to have become tired of his music; the Romans, however, appreciated it better, and it was at the [[Teatro Capranica]] in Rome that he produced some of his finest operas (''[[Telemaco (Scarlatti)|Telemaco]]'', 1718; ''Marco Attilio Regol\u00f2'', 1719; ''[[Griselda (A. Scarlatti)|La Griselda]]'', 1721), as well as some noble specimens of church music, including a [[mass (music)|mass]] for chorus and orchestra, composed in honor of [[Saint Cecilia]] for [[Cardinal Acquaviva]] in 1721. His last work on a large scale appears to have been the unfinished ''[[serenata]]'' for the marriage of the prince of [[Stigliano]] in 1723. He died in Naples in 1725 and is entombed there at the church of [[Santa Maria di Montesanto, Naples|Santa Maria di Montesanto]].\n\n==Scarlatti's music==\n[[File:Alessandro Scarlatti 2.jpg|thumb|Scarlatti as a young man.]]\n\nScarlatti's music forms an important link between the early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] Italian vocal styles of the 17th century, with their centers in Florence, Venice and [[Rome]], and the classical school of the 18th century. Scarlatti's style, however, is more than a transitional element in Western music; like most of his Naples colleagues he shows an almost modern understanding of the psychology of modulation and also frequently makes use of the ever-changing phrase lengths so typical of the Napoli school.\n\nHis early operas\u2014''Gli equivoci nel sembiante'' 1679; ''[[L'honest\u00e0 negli amori]]'' 1680, containing the famous aria \"Gi\u00e0 il sole dal Gange\"; ''[[Il Pompeo]]'' 1683, containing the well-known airs \"O cessate di piagarmi\" and \"Toglietemi la vita ancor,\" and others down to about 1685\u2014retain the older cadences in their [[recitatives]], and a considerable variety of neatly constructed forms in their charming little arias, accompanied sometimes by the string quartet, treated with careful elaboration, sometimes with the continuo alone. By 1686, he had definitely established the \"Italian overture\" form (second edition of ''Dal male il bene''), and had abandoned the [[ostinato|ground bass]] and the [[binary form]] air in two stanzas in favour of the [[ternary form]] or [[da capo]] type of air. His best operas of this period are ''La Rosaura'' (1690, printed by the [[Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Musikforschung]]), and ''Pirro e Demetrio'' (1694), in which occur the arias \"Le Violette\", and \"Ben ti sta, traditor\".\n\nFrom about 1697 onwards (''La caduta del Decemviri''), influenced partly perhaps by the style of [[Giovanni Bononcini]] and probably more by the taste of the viceregal court, his opera arias become more conventional and commonplace in rhythm, while his scoring is hasty and crude, yet not without brilliance (''L'Eraclea'', 1700), the [[oboe]]s and [[trumpet]]s being frequently used, and the [[violin]]s often playing in unison. The operas composed for Ferdinando de' Medici are lost; they might have given a more favourable idea of his style as his correspondence with the prince shows that they were composed with a very sincere sense of inspiration.\n\n[[File:Alessandro Scarlatti - Griselda. (BL Add MS 14168 f. 5r) crop.jpg|thumb|left|An autograph manuscript of Scarlatti's ''[[Griselda (Scarlatti)|Griselda]]'']]\n\n''[[Mitridate Eupatore]]'', accounted his masterpiece, composed for Venice in 1707, contains music far in advance of anything that Scarlatti had written for Naples, both in technique and in intellectual power. The later Neapolitan operas (''L'amor volubile e tiranno'' 1709; ''La principessa fedele'' 1710; ''Tigrane'', 1714, &c.) are showy and effective rather than profoundly emotional; the instrumentation marks a great advance on previous work, since the main duty of accompanying the voice is thrown upon the string quartet, the harpsichord being reserved exclusively for the noisy instrumental [[ritornello|''ritornelli'']]. In his opera ''Teodora'' (1697) he originated the use of the orchestral ''ritornello''.\n\nHis last group of operas, composed for Rome, exhibit a deeper poetic feeling, a broad and dignified style of melody, a strong dramatic sense, especially in accompanied recitatives, a device which he himself had been the first to use as early as 1686 (''Olimpia vendicata'') and a much more modern style of orchestration, the horns appearing for the first time, and being treated with striking effect.\n\n{{listen|filename=Scarlatti - Toccata 3.ogg|title=Toccata 3|description=Performed by Sylvia Kind on a harpsichord of the type made in the early 20th century|format=[[ogg]]}}\n\nBesides the operas, [[oratorio]]s (''Agar et Ismaele esiliati'', 1684; ''La Maddalena'', 1685; ''La Giuditta'', 1693; ''Christmas Oratorio'', c. 1705; ''S. Filippo Neri'', 1714; and others) and serenatas, which all exhibit a similar style, Scarlatti composed upwards of five hundred chamber-cantatas for solo voice. These represent the most intellectual type of chamber-music of their period, and it is to be regretted that they have remained almost entirely in manuscript, since a careful study of them is indispensable to anyone who wishes to form an adequate idea of Scarlatti's development.\n\nHis few remaining Masses (the story of his having composed two hundred is hardly credible) and church music in general are comparatively unimportant, except the great ''[[St Cecilia]] [[Mass (music)|Mass]]'' (1721), which is one of the first attempts at the style which reached its height in the great Masses of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. His instrumental music, though not without interest, is curiously antiquated as compared with his vocal works.\n\n==Operas==\n{{main|List of operas by Alessandro Scarlatti}}\n\n==Recordings==\n*Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, [[Nicholas McGegan]].

Bamford left in 1920 and Bamford & Martin was revitalised with funding from [[Count Louis Zborowski]]. In 1922, Bamford & Martin produced cars to compete in the [[French Grand Prix]], which went on to set world speed and endurance records at [[Brooklands]]. Three works Team Cars with 16-valve [[:File:Bla 5mr.jpg|twin cam engines]] were built for racing and record breaking: chassis number 1914, later developed as the Green Pea; chassis number 1915, the [[Razor Blade]] record car; and chassis number 1916, later developed as the [[Halford Special]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nApproximately 55 cars were built for sale in two configurations; [[:File:Side valve.jpg|long chassis]] and short chassis. Bamford & Martin went bankrupt in 1924 and was bought by [[Godfrey Benson, 1st Baron Charnwood#Family|Dorothea, Lady Charnwood]] who put her son John Benson on the board. Bamford & Martin went under again in 1925 and the factory closed in 1926, with Lionel Martin leaving.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nLater that year, Bill Renwick, [[A C Bertelli|Augustus (Bert) Bertelli]] and investors including Lady Charnwood took control of the business. They renamed it Aston Martin Motors and moved it to the former [[General Aircraft Limited#History|Whitehead Aircraft Limited]] [[Hanworth]] works in [[Feltham]]. Renwick and Bertelli had been in partnership some years and had developed an overhead-cam four-cylinder engine using Renwick's patented combustion chamber design, which they had tested in an [[Enfield-Allday]] chassis. The only \"Renwick and Bertelli\" motor car made, it was known as \"Buzzbox\" and still survives.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe pair had planned to sell their engine to motor manufacturers, but having heard that Aston Martin was no longer in production realised they could capitalise on its reputation to jump start the production of a completely new car.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nBetween 1926 and 1937 Bertelli was both technical director and designer of all new Aston Martins, since known as \"Bertelli cars\". They included the 1\u00bd-litre \"T-type\", \"International\", \"Le Mans\", \"MKII\" and its racing derivative, the \"Ulster\", and the 2-litre 15/98 and its racing derivative, the \"Speed Model\". Most were open two-seater sports cars bodied by Bert Bertelli's brother [[commons:Category:Bertelli coachwork|Enrico (Harry)]], with a small number of long-chassis four-seater tourers, dropheads and saloons also produced.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nBertelli was a competent driver keen to race his cars, one of few owner/manufacturer/drivers. The \"LM\" team cars were very successful in national and international motor racing including at Le Mans and the [[Mille Miglia]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nFinancial problems reappeared in 1932. Aston Martin was rescued for a year by [[Aston Martin Owners Club|Lance Prideaux Brune]] before passing it on to [[Arthur Sutherland|Sir Arthur Sutherland]]. In 1936, Aston Martin decided to concentrate on road cars, producing just 700 until [[World War II]] halted work.

Aston stayed true to its [[Grand tourer|grand touring]] style with the [[Aston Martin DB6|DB6]] (1965\u201370), and [[Aston Martin DBS|DBS]] (1967\u20131972).\n\nThe six-cylinder engines of these cars from 1954 up to 1965 were designed by [[Tadek Marek]].<ref>''Classic Cars: The World's Greatest Marques'' {{ISBN|978-0-785-81694-2}} p. 29</ref>\n\n=== Willson ===\n[[File:1986 Aston Martin V580 engine from the rear.jpg|thumb|The Tadek Marek-designed V8 engine was a mainstay of the Aston Martin lineup for decades, and was built from 1969 until 2000.]] \n\nAston Martin was often financially troubled. In 1972, David Brown paid off all its debts, said to be \u00a35 million or more, and handed it for \u00a3101 to Company Developments, a [[Birmingham]]-based investment bank consortium chaired by accountant [[William Willson (businessman)|William Willson]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=News and Comment: Aston Martin changes hands |volume=136 |journal=Autocar |issue=3960 |page=2 |date=9 March 1972}}</ref> More detail on this period may be read at [[William Willson (businessman)|Willson's biography]].

Tickford's name had been long associated with expensive high quality carriages and cars and their folding roofs. New products included a Tickford [[Austin Metro]], a Tickford [[Ford Capri]] and even Tickford train interiors, particularly on the [[Jaguar XJS]].<ref name=VGOBIT/> Pace continued sponsoring racing events, and now sponsored all Aston Martin Owners Club events, taking a Tickford-engined Nimrod Group C car owned by AMOC President [[Viscount Downe]], which came third in the Manufacturers Championship in both 1982 and 1983. It also finished seventh in the [[1982 24 Hours of Le Mans]] race. However, sales of production cars were now at an all-time low of 30 cars produced in 1982.<ref name=VGOBIT/>\n\nAs trading became tighter in the petroleum market, and Aston Martin was requiring more time and money, Gauntlett agreed to sell Hays/Pace to the Kuwait Investment Office in September 1983. As Aston Martin required greater investment, he also agreed to sell his share holding to American importer and Greek shipping tycoon [[Peter Livanos]], who invested via his [[joint venture]] with Nick and John Papanicolaou, ALL Inc. Gauntlett remained chairman of AML 55% owned by ALL, with Tickford a 50/50 venture between ALL and CHI. The uneasy relationship was ended when ALL exercised options to buy a larger share in AML; CHI's residual shares were exchanged for CHI's complete ownership of Tickford, which retained development of existing Aston Martin projects. In 1984  Papanicolaou's Titan shipping business was in trouble so Livanos's father George bought out the Papanicolaou's shares in ALL, while Gauntlett again became a shareholder with a 25% holding in AML. The deal valued Aston Martin/AML at \u00a32&nbsp;million, the year it built its 10,000th car.<ref name=VGOBIT/>\n\nAlthough as a result Aston Martin had to make 60 members of the workforce redundant, Gauntlett bought a stake in Italian styling house [[Zagato]], and resurrected its collaboration with Aston Martin.\n[[File:Aston Martin Volante.jpg|right|thumb|Aston Martin V8 Vantage from ''[[The Living Daylights]]'']]\nIn 1986, Gauntlett negotiated the return of fictional British secret agent [[James Bond]] to Aston Martin. [[Cubby Broccoli]] had chosen to recast the character using actor [[Timothy Dalton]], in an attempt to re-root the Bond-brand back to a more [[Sean Connery]]-like feel. Gauntlett supplied his personal pre-production [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (1977)|Vantage]] for use in the filming of ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', and sold a Volante to Broccoli for use at his home in America. Gauntlett turned down the role of a [[KGB]] colonel in the film, however: \"I would have loved to have done it but really could not afford the time.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thegoldengun.co.uk/tld/tldpress.html |title=TLD \u2013 Press (Allies/MI6) |publisher=thegoldengun.co.uk |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080513082305/http://www.thegoldengun.co.uk/tld/tldpress.html |archivedate=13 May 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAston Martin needed funds to survive in the long term. In May 1987, Gauntlett and [[Prince Michael of Kent]] were staying at the home of Contessa Maggi, the wife of the founder of the original [[Mille Miglia]], while watching the revival event. Another house guest was [[Walter Hayes]], vice-president of [[Ford of Europe]].

In 1994, Ford opened a new factory at Banbury Road in [[Bloxham]]. In 1995, Aston Martin produced a record 700 vehicles. Until the Ford era, cars had been produced by hand coachbuilding craft methods, such as the [[English wheel]]. In 1998, the 2,000th DB7 was built, and in 2002, the 6,000th, exceeding production of all previous DB models. The DB7 range was boosted by the addition of [[Aston Martin DB7|V12 Vantage]] models in 1999, and in 2001, Aston Martin introduced the V12-engined [[Aston Martin Vanquish]].\n\nAt the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan in 2003, Aston Martin introduced the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2005)|AMV8 Vantage]] concept car. Expected to have few changes before its introduction in 2005, the Vantage brought back the classic V8 engine to allow Aston Martin to compete in a larger market. 2003 also saw the opening of the [[Gaydon]] factory, the first purpose-built factory in Aston Martin's history. Also introduced in 2003 was the [[Aston Martin DB9|DB9]] coup\u00e9, which replaced the ten-year-old [[Aston Martin DB7|DB7]]. A [[Roadster (automobile)|convertible]] version of the DB9, the [[DB9 Volante]], was introduced at the 2004 [[Detroit auto show|Detroit Auto Show]].\n\nIn October 2004, Aston Martin set up the dedicated {{convert|12500|m2}} [[Aston Martin Engine Plant|AMEP]] engine production plant within the [[Ford Germany]] [[Niehl, Cologne]] plant. With capacity to produce up to 5,000 engines a year by 100 specially trained personnel, like traditional Aston Martin engine production from Newport Pagnell, assembly of each unit is entrusted to a single technician from a pool of 30, with V8 and V12 variants assembled in under 20 hours.

The DBR9 competes in the GT class in [[sports car racing|sports car races]], including the world-famous [[24 Hours of Le Mans]].\n\nIn 2006, an internal audit led Ford to consider divesting itself of parts of its [[Premier Automotive Group]].

In August 1825, he passed entrance exams at [[Harvard University]], though when the college requested payment of tuition fees for the first two years, he chose not to attend. He began a program of self-education, later becoming a schoolteacher in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]], [[Bedford, Massachusetts|North Bedford]], [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts|Fairhaven]] and Newburyport.<ref>Hubbell, Jay B.

After this he joined a trapping expedition to the [[Llano Estacado]] in New Mexico and Texas. Trapping was minimal and, after traveling about 1,300 miles (650 on foot), he finally arrived at [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]].<ref name=Cutrer>[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpi18 Cutrer, Thomas W., \"Pike, Albert\", ''The Handbook of Texas'', Texas State Historical Association]</ref>\n\n==Journalist and lawyer==\n[[File:Albert Pike CDV.jpg|thumb|left|Signed ''Carte de visite'']]\nSettling in Arkansas in 1833, Pike taught in a school and wrote a series of articles for the [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] ''Arkansas Advocate'' under the pen name of \"Casca.\"<ref name=moneyhon/> The articles were popular enough that he was asked to join the newspaper's staff. Under Pike's administration the ''Advocate'' promoted the viewpoint of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in a politically volatile and divided Arkansas in December 1832.<ref name=moneyhon/> After marrying Mary Ann Hamilton in 1834, he purchased the newspaper.<ref name=ipw>[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=PI006 Westmoreland, Ingrid P., \"Pike, Albert\", Oklahoma Historical Society]</ref> \n\nHe was the first reporter for the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]].

Pike began to study law and was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]] in 1837, selling the ''Advocate'' the same year. \n\nHe also made several contacts among the Native American tribes in the area. He specialized in claims on behalf of Native Americans against the federal government.<ref name=smithassoc/> In 1852 he represented [[Muscogee|Creek Nation]] before the Supreme Court in a claim regarding ceded tribal land. In 1854 he advocated for the [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]], although compensation later awarded to the tribes in 1856 and 1857 was insufficient.<ref name=ipw/> These relationships were to influence the course of his Civil War service.\n\nAdditionally, Pike wrote on several legal subjects. He also continued writing poetry, a hobby he had begun in his youth in Massachusetts. His poems were highly regarded in his day, but are now mostly forgotten. Several volumes of his works were privately published posthumously by his daughter.  In 1859, he received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Harvard.<ref>\"The Phoenix,\" Manly P.

With his regiment, he fought in the [[Battle of Buena Vista]]. Pike was discharged in June 1847.  He and his commander, Colonel [[John Selden Roane]], had several differences of opinion. This situation led finally to an \"inconclusive\" [[duel]] between Pike and Roane on July 29, 1847, near Fort Smith, Arkansas.<ref name=\"Eicher429\">Eicher, John H., aer (2001) ''Civil War High Commands''.

At 23, he published his first poem, \"Hymns to the Gods.\" Later work was printed in literary journals such as Blackwood's ''Edinburgh Magazine'' and local newspapers. His first collection of poetry, ''Prose Sketches and Poems Written in the Western Country'', was published in 1834.<ref name=Cutrer /> He later gathered many of his poems and republished them in ''Hymns to the Gods and Other Poems'' (1872).

It was originally designed as a successor to [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]]-type connections for video cards. Since 2004, AGP has been progressively phased out in favor of [[PCI Express]] (PCIe); by mid-2008, PCI Express cards dominated the market and only a few AGP models were available,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/AGP-Almost-at-the-End-of-the-Road-87316.shtml |title=AGP almost at the end, Softpedia |date=5 June 2008 |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> with GPU manufacturers and add-in board partners eventually dropping support for the interface in favour of PCI Express.\n\n== {{Anchor|APERTURE}}Advantages over PCI ==\nAs computers increasingly became graphically oriented, successive generations of graphics adapters began to push the limits of [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]], a [[computer bus|bus]] with shared bandwidth. This led to the development of AGP, a \"bus\" dedicated to graphics adapters.\n\nAGP is heavily based on PCI, and in fact the AGP bus is a superset of the [[conventional PCI]] bus, and AGP cards must act as PCI cards.\n\nThe primary advantage of AGP over PCI is that it provides a dedicated pathway between the slot and the processor rather than sharing the PCI bus. In addition to a lack of contention for the bus, the direct connection allows for higher clock speeds.\n\nThe second major change is that AGP uses split transactions,<!--Anyone know a wikilink?  [[Split transaction]] is currently about bookkeeping--> where the address and data phases of a PCI transaction are separated.  The card may send many address phases, and the host processes them in order.  This avoids long delays, with the bus idle, during read operations.\n\nThird, PCI bus handshaking is simplified.  Unlike PCI bus transactions whose length is negotiated on a cycle-by-cycle basis using the FRAME# and STOP# signals, AGP transfers are always a multiple of 8 bytes long, and the total length is included in the request.  Further, rather than using the IRDY# and TRDY# signals for each word, data is transferred in blocks of four clock cycles (32 words at AGP 8&times; speed), and pauses are allowed only between blocks.\n\nFinally, AGP allows (optional in AGP 1.0 and 2.0, mandatory in AGP 3.0) ''sideband addressing'', meaning that the [[address bus|address]] and [[Bus (computing)|data buses]] are separated so the address phase does not use the main address/data (AD) lines at all.  This is done by adding an extra 8-bit \"SideBand Address\" [[computer bus|bus]] over which the graphics controller can issue new AGP requests while other AGP data is flowing over the main 32 address/data (AD) lines. This results in improved overall AGP data throughput.\n\nThis great improvement in memory read performance makes it practical for an AGP card to read [[Texture mapping|textures]] directly from system RAM, while a PCI graphics card must copy it from system RAM to the card's [[video memory]].  System memory is made available using the [[graphics address remapping table]] (GART), which apportions main memory as needed for texture storage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sysopt.com/features/mboard/article.php/3549951 |title=What is AGP? |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509222057/http://www.sysopt.com/features/mboard/article.php/3549951 |archivedate=9 May 2012 }}</ref> The maximum amount of system memory available to AGP is defined as the ''AGP [[Aperture (computer memory)|aperture]]''.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:AGP-Video-Card.jpg|thumb|An AGP card]]\n\nThe AGP slot first appeared on [[x86]]-compatible system boards based on [[Socket 7]] Intel [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium]] and [[Slot 1]] [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]] [[Pentium II]] processors. Intel introduced AGP support with the i[[440LX]] Slot 1 chipset on August 26, 1997, and a flood of products followed from all the major system board vendors.<ref name=Intel440LXdata>{{cite web |url=http://www.intel.com/design/chipsets/datashts/290564.htm |title=Intel 440LX AGPset |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first Socket 7 chipsets to support AGP were the [[VIA Technologies|VIA]] [[Apollo VP3]], [[Silicon Integrated Systems|SiS]] 5591/5592, and the [[Acer Laboratories Incorporated|ALI]] Aladdin V. Intel never released an AGP-equipped Socket 7 chipset. [[First International Computer|FIC]] demonstrated the first Socket 7 AGP system board in November 1997 as the ''FIC PA-2012'' based on the VIA Apollo VP3 chipset, followed very quickly by the ''EPoX P55-VP3'' also based on the VIA VP3 chipset which was first to market.<ref>{{cite web |author=Lal Shimpi, Anand |url=http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=155&p=1 |title=Chipset Guide |publisher=AnandTech |date=August 1, 1997 |accessdate=2015-03-03}}</ref>\n\nEarly video chipsets featuring AGP support included the [[Rendition (company)|Rendition]] V\u00e9rit\u00e9 V2200, [[3dfx]] [[3dfx#Voodoo Banshee|Voodoo Banshee]], [[Nvidia]] [[RIVA 128]], [[3Dlabs]] PERMEDIA 2, [[Intel740|Intel i740]], [[ATI Rage|ATI Rage series]], [[Matrox]] Millennium II, and [[S3 ViRGE|S3 ViRGE GX/2]]. Some early AGP boards used graphics processors built around PCI and were simply bridged to AGP. This resulted in the cards benefiting little from the new bus, with the only improvement used being the 66&nbsp;MHz bus clock, with its resulting doubled bandwidth over PCI, and bus exclusivity. Examples of such cards were the Voodoo Banshee, V\u00e9rit\u00e9 V2200, Millennium II, and S3 ViRGE GX/2. Intel's i740 was explicitly designed to exploit the new AGP feature set; in fact it was designed to texture only from AGP memory, making PCI versions of the board difficult to implement (local board RAM had to emulate AGP memory.)\n\nMicrosoft first introduced AGP support into ''[[Windows 95]] OEM Service Release 2'' (OSR2 version 1111 or 950B) via the ''USB SUPPLEMENT to OSR2'' patch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000145.htm |title=Which version of Windows 95 supports AGP? |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> After applying the patch the Windows 95 system became ''Windows 95 version 4.00.950 B''. The first Windows NT-based operating system to receive AGP support was [[Windows NT 4.0]] with [[Service Pack]] 3, introduced in 1997. [[Linux]] support for AGP enhanced fast data transfers was first added in 1999 with the implementation of the [[AGPgart]] kernel module.\n\n==Versions==\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: left; margin-left: 1.5em;\"\n|+ AGP and [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]]: [[32-bit]] buses operating at 66 and 33 [[Megahertz|MHz]] respectively\n|-\n!Specification || Voltage || Clock || Speed || Transfers/clock || Rate (MB/s)\n|-\n|PCI || 3.3/5&nbsp;V || 33&nbsp;MHz || &mdash; || 1 || 133\n|-\n|PCI 2.1 || 3.3/5&nbsp;V || 33/66&nbsp;MHz || &mdash; || 1 || 133/266\n|-\n|AGP 1.0 || 3.3&nbsp;V || 66&nbsp;MHz || 1\u00d7 || 1 || 266\n|-\n|AGP 1.0 || 3.3&nbsp;V || 66&nbsp;MHz || 2\u00d7 || 2 || 533\n|-\n|AGP 2.0 || 1.5&nbsp;V || 66&nbsp;MHz || 4\u00d7 || 4 || 1066\n|-\n|AGP 3.0 || 0.8&nbsp;V || 66&nbsp;MHz || 8\u00d7 || 8 || 2133\n|-\n|AGP 3.5<sup>*</sup> || 0.8&nbsp;V || 66&nbsp;MHz || 8\u00d7 || 8 || 2133\n|}\n\nIntel released \"AGP specification 1.0\" in 1997.<ref name=agp10/> It specified 3.3&nbsp;V signals and 1\u00d7 and 2\u00d7 speeds.<ref name=Intel440LXdata /> Specification 2.0 documented 1.5&nbsp;V signaling, which could be used at 1\u00d7, 2\u00d7 and the additional 4\u00d7 speed<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/g0801/35x01/04g01.asp |title=AGP 4\u00d7: Faster Data Transfer & Better-Quality Images |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=agp20 /> and 3.0 added 0.8&nbsp;V signaling, which could be operated at 4\u00d7 and 8\u00d7 speeds.<ref name=agp30/> (1\u00d7 and 2\u00d7 speeds are physically possible, but were not specified.)\n\nAvailable versions are listed in the adjacent table.\n\nAGP version 3.5 is only publicly mentioned by Microsoft under ''Universal Accelerated Graphics Port (UAGP)'', which specifies mandatory supports of extra registers once marked optional under AGP 3.0.

There are also unkeyed \"Universal\" slots that will accept either type of card. When an AGP Universal card is plugged-into an AGP Universal slot, only the 1.5 V portion of the card is used. Some cards, like Nvidia's [[GeForce 6]] series (except the 6200) or ATI's [[Radeon X800]] series, only have keys for 1.5 V to prevent them from being installed in older mainboards without 1.5 V support. Some of the last modern cards with 3.3 V support were the Nvidia [[GeForce FX]] series (FX 5200, FX 5500, FX 5700, some FX 5800, FX 5900 and some FX 5950), Geforce 6 Series (6200, 6600/6600 LE/6600 GT only) and the ATI [[Radeon R300|Radeon 9500/9700/9800(R350)]] (but not 9600/9800(R360)). Some Geforce 6200 and Geforce 6600 cards will function with AGP 1.0 (3.3v) slots.\n\nAGP Pro cards will not fit into standard slots, but standard AGP cards will work in a Pro slot. Motherboards equipped with a Universal AGP Pro slot will accept a 1.5 V or 3.3 V card in either the AGP Pro or standard AGP configuration, a Universal AGP card, or a Universal AGP Pro card.\n\nSome cards incorrectly have dual notches, and some motherboards incorrectly have fully open slots, allowing a card to be plugged into a slot that does not support the correct signaling voltage, which may damage card or motherboard. Some incorrectly designed older 3.3 V cards have the 1.5 V key.\n\nThere are some proprietary systems incompatible with standard AGP; for example, [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[Power Macintosh]] computers with the [[Apple Display Connector]] (ADC) have an extra connector which delivers power to the attached display. Some cards designed to work with a specific [[CPU design|CPU architecture]] (e.g., PC, Apple) may not work with others due to [[firmware]] issues.\n\nMark Allen of Playtools.com made the following comments regarding Practical AGP Compatibility for AGP 3.0 and AGP 2.0:<ref>{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Mark|title=AGP compatibility for sticklers|work=Video card information|url=http://www.playtool.com/pages/agpcompat/agp.html|publisher=PlayTool.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160622083724/http://www.playtool.com/pages/agpcompat/agp.html|archivedate=22 June 2016|year=2006}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"...nobody makes AGP 3.0 cards, and nobody makes AGP 3.0 motherboards.

And every motherboard which claimed to be an AGP 3.0 motherboard turned out to be a universal 1.5V AGP 3.0 motherboard. It makes sense, if you think about it, because if anyone actually shipped a consumer-oriented product which supported only 0.8 volts, they would end up with lots of confused customers and a support nightmare.

Many AGP cards had additional power connectors to supply them with more power than the slot could provide.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Legacy use==\nBy 2010 few new motherboards had AGP slots. No new motherboard chipsets were equipped with AGP support, but motherboards continued to be produced with older chipsets with support for AGP.\n\nGraphics processors of this period use PCI-Express, a general-purpose (not restricted to graphics) standard that supports higher data transfer rates and [[Duplex (telecommunications)|full-duplex]]. To create AGP-compatible graphics cards, those chips require an additional PCIe-to-AGP bridge-chip to convert PCIe signals to and from AGP signals. This incurs additional board costs due to the need for the additional bridge chip and for a separate AGP-designed circuit board.\n\nVarious manufacturers of graphics cards continued to produce AGP cards for the shrinking AGP user-base. The first bridged cards were the GeForce 6600 and ATI Radeon X800 XL boards, released during 2004-5.<ref>Gasior, Geoff.

There were many problems with the AMD Catalyst 11.2 - 11.6 AGP hotfix drivers under Windows 7 with the HD 4000 series AGP video cards;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forums.amd.com/game/messageview.cfm?catid=279&threadid=152471&highlight_key=y&keyword1=agp |title=AMD community forums |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> use of 10.12 or 11.1 AGP hotfix drivers is the recommended{{by whom|date=October 2011}} workaround. Several of the vendors listed above make available past versions of the AGP drivers.\n\n==Protocol==\nAn AGP bus is a superset of a 66&nbsp;MHz [[conventional PCI]] bus and, immediately after reset, follows the same protocol.  The card must act as a PCI target, and optionally may act as a PCI master.  (AGP 2.0 added a \"fast writes\" extension which allows PCI writes from the motherboard to the card to transfer data at higher speed.)\n\nAfter the card is initialized using PCI transactions, AGP transactions are permitted.  For these, the card is always the AGP master and the motherboard is always the AGP target.  The card queues multiple requests which correspond to the PCI address phase, and the motherboard schedules the corresponding data phases later.  An important part of initialization is telling the card the maximum number of outstanding AGP requests which may be queued at a given time.\n\nAGP requests are similar to PCI memory read and write requests, but use a different encoding on command lines C/BE[3:0] and are always 8-byte [[Data structure alignment|aligned]]; their starting address and length are always multiples of 8 bytes (64 bits).  The three low-order bits of the address are used instead to communicate the length of the request.\n\nWhenever the PCI GNT# signal is asserted, granting the bus to the card, three additional status bits ST[2:0] indicate the type of transfer to be performed next.  If the bits are <code>0xx</code>, a previously queued AGP transaction's data is to be transferred; if the three bits are <code>111</code>, the card may begin a PCI transaction or (if sideband addressing is not in use) queue a request in-band using PIPE#.\n\n===AGP command codes===\nLike PCI, each AGP transaction begins with an address phase, communicating an address and 4-bit command code.  The possible commands are different from PCI, however:\n\n; 000p&#58; Read\n: Read 8\u00d7(AD[2:0]+1) = 8, 16, 24, ..., 64 bytes.  The least significant bit p is 0 for low-priority, 1 for high.\n; 001x&#58; (reserved):\n; 010p&#58; Write\n: Write 8\u00d7(AD[2:0]+1) = 8&ndash;64 bytes.\n; 011x&#58; (reserved):\n; 100p&#58; Long read\n: Read 32\u00d7(AD[2:0]+1) = 32, 64, 96, ..., 256 bytes.  This is the same as a read request, but the length is multiplied by four.\n; 1010&#58; Flush\n: Force previously written data to memory, for synchronization.  This acts as a low-priority read, taking a queue slot and returning 8 bytes of random data to indicate completion.  The address and length supplied with this command are ignored.\n; 1011&#58; (reserved):\n; 1100&#58; Fence\n: This acts as a [[memory fence]], requiring that all earlier AGP requests complete before any following requests.  Ordinarily, for increased performance, AGP uses a very weak [[consistency model]], and allows a later write to pass an earlier read.  (E.g. after sending \"write 1, write 2, read, write 3, write 4\" requests, all to the same address, the read may return any value from 2 to 4.  Only returning 1 is forbidden, as writes must complete before following reads.)  This operation does not require any queue slots.\n; 1101&#58; Dual address cycle\n: When making a request to an address above 2<sup>32</sup>, this is used to indicate that a second address cycle will follow with additional address bits.  This operates like a regular PCI dual address cycle; it is accompanied by the low-order 32 bits of the address (and the length), and the following cycle includes the high 32 address bits and the desired command.  The two cycles make one request, and take only one slot in the request queue.  This request code is not used with side-band addressing.\n; 111x&#58; (reserved):\n\nAGP 3.0 dropped high-priority requests and the long read commands, as they were little used.  It also mandated side-band addressing, thus dropping the dual address cycle, leaving only four request types: low-priority read (0000), low-priority write (0100), flush (1010) and fence (1100).\n\n===In-band AGP requests using PIPE#===\nTo queue a request in-band, the card must request the bus using the standard PCI REQ# signal, and receive GNT# plus bus status ST[2:0] equal to <code>111</code>.  Then, instead of asserting FRAME# to begin a PCI transaction, the card asserts the PIPE# signal while driving the AGP command, address, and length on the C/BE[3:0], AD[31:3] and AD[2:0] lines, respectively.  (If the address is 64 bits, a dual address cycle similar to PCI is used.)  For every cycle that PIPE# is asserted, the card sends another request without waiting for acknowledgement from the motherboard, up to the configured maximum queue depth.  The last cycle is marked by deasserting REQ#, and PIPE# is deasserted on the following idle cycle.\n\n===Side-band AGP requests using SBA[7:0]===\nIf side-band addressing is supported and configured, the PIPE# signal is not used.  (And the signal is re-used for another purpose in the AGP 3.0 protocol, which requires side-band addressing.)  Instead, requests are broken into 16-bit pieces which are sent as two bytes across the SBA bus.  There is no need for the card to ask permission from the motherboard; a new request may be sent at any time as long as the number of outstanding requests is within the configured maximum queue depth.  The possible values are:\n\n; <code>0aaa aaaa aaaa alll</code>\n: Queue a request with the given low-order address bits A[14:3] and length 8\u00d7(L[2:0]+1).  The command and high-order bits are as previously specified.  Any number of requests may be queued by sending only this pattern, as long as the command and higher address bits remain the same.\n; <code>10cc ccra aaaa aaaa</code>\n: Use command C[3:0] and address bits A[23:15] for future requests.  (Bit R is reserved.)  This does not queue a request, but sets values that will be used in all future queued requests.\n; <code>110r aaaa aaaa aaaa</code>\n: Use address bits A[35:24] for future requests.\n; <code>1110 aaaa aaaa aaaa</code>\n: Use address bits A[47:36] for future requests.\n; <code>1111 0xxx</code>, <code>1111 10xx</code>, <code>1111 110x</code>\n: ''Reserved, do not use.''\n; <code>1111 1110</code>\n: Synchronization pattern used when starting the SBA bus after an idle period.{{r|agp10|agp20|p1=68|p2=163}}\n; <code>1111 1111</code>\n: [[No operation]]; no request.  At AGP 1\u00d7 speed, this may be sent as a single byte and a following 16-bit side-band request started one cycle later.  At AGP 2\u00d7 and higher speeds, all side-band requests, including this NOP, are 16 bits long.\n\nSideband address bytes are sent at the same rate as data transfers, up to 8\u00d7 the 66&nbsp;MHz basic bus clock.  Sideband addressing has the advantage that it mostly eliminates the need for turnaround cycles on the AD bus between transfers, in the usual case when read operations greatly outnumber writes.\n\n===AGP responses===\nWhile asserting GNT#, the motherboard may instead indicate via the ST bits that a data phase for a queued request will be performed next.  There are four queues: two priorities (low- and high-priority) for each of reads and writes, and each is processed in order.  Obviously, the motherboard will attempt to complete high-priority requests first, but there is no limit on the number of low-priority responses which may be delivered while the high-priority request is processed.\n\nFor each cycle when the GNT# is asserted and the status bits have the value <code>00p</code>, a read response of the indicated priority is scheduled to be returned.  At the next available opportunity (typically the next clock cycle), the motherboard will assert TRDY# (target ready) and begin transferring the response to the oldest request in the indicated read queue.  (Other PCI bus signals like FRAME#, DEVSEL# and IRDY# remain deasserted.)  Up to four clock cycles worth of data (16 bytes at AGP 1\u00d7 or 128 bytes at AGP 8\u00d7) are transferred without waiting for acknowledgement from the card.  If the response is longer than that, both the card and motherboard must indicate their ability to continue on the third cycle by asserting IRDY# (initiator ready) and TRDY#, respectively.  If either one does not, [[wait state]]s will be inserted until two cycles after they both do.  (The value of IRDY# and TRDY# at other times is irrelevant and they are usually deasserted.)\n\nThe C/BE# byte enable lines may be ignored during read responses, but are held asserted (all bytes valid) by the motherboard.\n\nThe card may also assert the RBF# (read buffer full) signal to indicate that it is temporarily unable to receive more low-priority read responses.  The motherboard will refrain from scheduling any more low-priority read responses.  The card must still be able to receive the end of the current response, and the first four-cycle block of the following one if scheduled, plus any high-priority responses it has requested.\n\nFor each cycle when GNT# is asserted and the status bits have the value <code>01p</code>, write data is scheduled to be sent across the bus.  At the next available opportunity (typically the next clock cycle), the card will assert IRDY# (initiator ready) and begin transferring the data portion of the oldest request in the indicated write queue.  If the data is longer than four clock cycles, the motherboard will indicate its ability to continue by asserting TRDY# on the third cycle.  Unlike reads, there is no provision for the card to delay the write; if it didn't have the data ready to send, it shouldn't have queued the request.\n\nThe C/BE# lines ''are'' used with write data, and may be used by the card to select which bytes should be written to memory.\n\nThe multiplier in AGP 2\u00d7, 4\u00d7 and 8\u00d7 indicates the number of data transfers across the bus during each 66&nbsp;MHz clock cycle.  Such transfers use [[source synchronous]] clocking with a \"strobe\" signal (AD_STB[0], AD_STB[1], and SB_STB) generated by the data source.  AGP 4\u00d7 adds complementary strobe signals.\n\nBecause AGP transactions may be as short as two transfers, at AGP 4\u00d7 and 8\u00d7 speeds it is possible for a request to complete in the middle of a clock cycle.  In such a case, the cycle is padded with dummy data transfers (with the C/BE# byte enable lines held deasserted).\n\n==Connector pinout==\nThe AGP connector contains almost all PCI signals, plus several additions. The connector has 66 contacts on each side, although 4 are removed for each keying notch. Pin&nbsp;1 is closest to the I/O bracket, and the B and A sides are as in the table, looking down at the motherboard connector.\n\nContacts are spaced at 1&nbsp;mm intervals, however they are arranged in two staggered vertical rows so that there is 2&nbsp;mm space between pins in each row. Odd-numbered A-side contacts, and even-numbered B-side contacts are in the lower row (1.0 to 3.5&nbsp;mm from the card edge). The others are in the upper row (3.7 to 6.0&nbsp;mm from the card edge).\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Accelerated Graphics Port connector pinout<ref name=agp10>{{Citation |url=http://www.playtool.com/pages/agpcompat/agp10.pdf |title=Accelerated Graphics Port Interface Specification Revision 1.0 |author=Intel |date=July 31, 1996 |accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref>{{rp|95}}<ref name=agp20>{{Citation |url=http://www.motherboards.org/files/techspecs/agp20.pdf |title=Accelerated Graphics Port Interface Specification Revision 2.0 |author=Intel |date=May 4, 1998 |accessdate=2014-09-15}}</ref>{{rp|231\u20133}}<ref name=agp30>{{Citation |url=http://download.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/agp30.pdf |title=AGP V3.0 Interface Specification |author=Intel |date=September 2002 |accessdate=2011-10-09}}</ref>{{rp|50}}\n|-\n!

It is the seat of the [[Ostalbkreis]] district and is its largest town. It is also the largest town in the [[Ostw\u00fcrttemberg]] region. Since 1956, Aalen has had the status of [[Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt]] (major district town). It is noted for its many [[half-timbered]] houses constructed from the 16th century through the 18th century.<ref name=munro/>\n\nWith an area of 146.63&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, Aalen is ranked 7th in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and 2nd within the [[Stuttgart (region)|Government Region of Stuttgart]], after Stuttgart.

On the other hills of the city, [[sand]]s ''(Goldsh\u00f6fer Sande)'', [[gravel]] and residual [[rubble]] prevail.\nThe historic centre of Aalen and the other areas in the Kocher valley are founded completely on [[Holocene|holocenic]] [[floodplain]] [[loam]] ''(Auelehm)'' and riverbed gravel that have filled in the valley.\n\nMost parts of Dewangen and Fachsenfeld are founded on formations of ''Jurensismergel'' (Jurensis [[Marl]]), ''Posidonienschiefer'' (cf. [[Posidonia Shale]]), ''Amaltheenton'' (Amalthean Clay), ''Numismalismergel'' (Numismalis Marl) and ''Obtususton'' (Obtusus Clay, named after [[Asteroceras obtusum]] ammonites) moving from south to north, all belonging to the Jurassic and being rich in fossils. They are at last followed by the ''Trossingen Formation'' already belonging to the [[Late Triassic]].\n\nUntil 1939 iron ore was mined on the ''Braunenberg'' hill. (see [[#Tiefer Stollen|Tiefer Stollen]] section).\n\n=== Extent of the borough ===\nThe maximum extent of the town's territory amounts to {{convert|18|km|mi}} in a north-south dimension and {{convert|25|km|mi}} in an east-west dimension.

Tools made of [[flint]] and traces of [[Mesolithic]] human settlement dated between the 8th and 5th millennium BC were found on several sites on the margins of the Kocher and Jagst valleys. On the ''Schlo\u00dfbaufeld'' plateau (appr. {{convert|650|by|350|m|ft}}), situated behind ''Kocherburg'' castle near Unterkochen, a hill-top settlement was found, with the core being dated to the [[Bronze Age]]. In the ''Appenwang'' forest near Wasseralfingen, in Goldsh\u00f6fe, and in Ebnat, [[Tumulus|tumuli]] of the [[Hallstatt culture]] were found. In Aalen and Wasseralfingen, gold and silver coins left by the [[Celts]] were found. The Celts were responsible for the fortifications in the Schlo\u00dfbaufeld settlement consisting of sectional embankments and a stone wall. Also, Near Heisenberg (Wasseralfingen), a Celtic [[nemeton]] has been identified; however it is no longer readily apparent.<ref name=\"bauer25\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1983|p=25}}</ref>\n\n==== Roman era ====\n[[File:Limesmuseum Aalen principia.jpg|thumb|The Roman fort's excavated foundation walls]]\nAfter abandoning the [[Alb Limes]] (a ''[[limes]]'' generally following the ridgeline of the Swabian Jura) around 150 [[Anno Domini|AD]], Aalen's territory became part of the [[Roman Empire]], in direct vicinity of the then newly erected [[Rhaetian Limes]]. The Romans erected a [[castrum]] to house the [[cavalry]] unit ''[[Ala (Roman military)|Ala]] II Flavia milliaria''; its remains are known today as ''Kastell Aalen'' (\"Aalen Roman fort\"). The site is west of today's town centre at the bottom of the ''Schillerh\u00f6he'' hill. With about 1,000 horsemen and nearly as many [[groom (horse)|groom]]s, it was the greatest fort of [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]] along the Rhaetian Limes. There were Civilian settlements adjacent along the south and the east. Around 260 AD, the Romans gave up the fort as they withdrew their presence in unoccupied [[Germania]] back to the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers, and the [[Alamanni]] took over the region.<ref name=\"ostalbkreis_315\">{{harvnb|Winter|1992|pp=315\u2013320}}</ref><ref name=\"aalen-antike\">{{harvnb|City of Aalen|2013k}}</ref> Based on 3rd- and 4th-century coins found, the civilian settlement continued to exist for the time being. However, there is no evidence of continued civilization between the Roman era and the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"bauer25\"/>\n\n==== Foundation ====\nBased on discovery of alamannic graves, archaeologists have established the 7th century as the origination of Aalen. In the northern and western walls of St. John's church, which is located directly adjacent to the eastern gate of the Roman fort, Roman stones were incorporated. The building that exists today probably dates to the 9th century.\n\nThe first mention of Aalen was in 839, when emperor [[Louis the Pious]] reportedly permitted the [[Fulda monastery]] to exchange land with the Hammerstadt village, then known as ''Hamarstat''.<ref name=\"ostalbkreis_123\">{{harvnb|Winter|1992|p=123}}</ref>\nAalen itself was first mentioned in an inventory list of [[Ellwangen Abbey]], dated ca. 1136, as the village ''Alon'', along with a lower nobleman named Conrad of Aalen. This nobleman probably had his ancestral castle at a site south of today's town centre and was subject first to Ellwangen abbey, later to the [[House of Hohenstaufen]], and eventually to the [[House of Oettingen]]. 1426 was the last time a member of that house was mentioned in connection with Aalen.\nDocuments, from the Middle Ages, indicate that the town of Aalen was founded by the Hohenstaufen some time between 1241 and 1246, but at a different location than the earlier village, which was supposedly destroyed in 1388 during the war between the Alliance of Swabian Cities and the Dukes of Bavaria.\nLater, it is documented that the counts of Oettingen ruled the town in 1340. They are reported to have pawned the town to Count [[Eberhard II, Count of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard II]] and subsequently to the [[House of W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1358 or 1359 in exchange for an amount of money.<ref name=\"bauer82\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1983|p=82}}</ref>\n\n==== Imperial City ====\n{{Infobox former country\n|native_name     = ''Reichsstadt Aalen''\n|conventional_long_name = Imperial City of Aalen\n|common_name     = Aalen\n|continent       = Europe\n|region          = Central Europe\n|country         = Germany\n|era             = Early modern period\n|status          = [[Imperial State|Imperial Estate]]\n|empire          = Holy Roman Empire\n|government_type = Republic\n|year_start      = 1360\n|year_end        = 1803\n|event_pre       = Town founded\n|date_pre        = 13th century\n|event_start     = Gained [[Imperial immediacy]]\n|date_start      =\n|event1          = [[Protestant Reformation]]\n|date_event1     = 1575\n|event2          = [[Counter-Reformation]]\n|date_event2     = 1628\u201332\n|event3          = Devastated by fire\n|date_event3     = 1634\n|event_end       = [[German Mediatisation|Mediatised]] to [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n|date_end        =\n|p1              = County of Oettingen\n|flag_p1         = 0193 Oettingen evetezett alapon pajzs \u00e9s har\u00e1ntkereszt.svg\n|border_p1       = no\n|p2              = County of W\u00fcrttemberg\n|flag_p2         = Wuerttemberg Arms.svg\n|border_p2       = no\n|s1              = Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg\n|flag_s1         = Wappen Herzogtum W\u00fcrttemberg.svg\n|border_s1       = no\n|capital         = Aalen\n|footnotes       = Before 1360, the town belonged to the [[County of Oettingen|Counts of Oettingen]] who pawned them into the [[County of W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1358 or 1359.\n}}\n\n===== Designation as Imperial City =====\nDuring the war against W\u00fcrttemberg, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] took the town without a fight after a siege. On 3 December 1360, he declared Aalen an [[Free imperial city|Imperial City]], that is, a city or town responsible only to the emperor, a status that made it a quasi-sovereign city-state and that it kept until 1803.<ref>{{harvnb|Canby|1984|p=1}}</ref> In 1377, Aalen joined the Alliance of Swabian Cities, and in 1385, the term ''civitas'' appears in the town's seal for the first time. In 1398, Aalen was granted the right to hold markets, and in 1401 Aalen obtained proper jurisdiction.\n\n[[File:Aalen 1528.jpg|thumb|Town view of 1528]]\nThe oldest artistic representation of Aalen was made in 1528. It was made as the basis of a lawsuit between the town and the Counts of Oettingen at the [[Reichskammergericht]] in Speyer. It shows Aalen surrounded by walls, towers, and double moats. The layout of the moats, which had an embankment built between them, is recognizable by the present streets named ''N\u00f6rdlicher, \u00d6stlicher, S\u00fcdlicher'' and ''Westlicher Stadtgraben'' (Northern, Eastern, Southern and Western Moat respectively). The wall was about {{convert|6|m|ft}} tall, 1518 [[Pace (unit)|single paces]] ({{convert|990|m|ft}}) long and enclosed an area of {{convert|5.3|ha|acre}}. During its early years, the town had two [[town gate]]s: The ''Upper'' or ''[[Ellwangen]] Gate'' in the east, and St. Martin's gate in the south; however due to frequent floods, St. Martin's gate was bricked up in the 14th century and replaced by the ''Lower'' or ''[[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd|Gm\u00fcnd]] Gate'' built in the west before 1400. Later, several minor side gates were added. The central street market took place on the ''Wettegasse'' (today called ''Marktplatz'', \"market square\") and the ''Reichsst\u00e4dter Stra\u00dfe''. So the market district stretched from one gate to the other, however in Aalen it was not straight, but with a 90-degree curve between southern (St. Martin's) gate and eastern (Ellwangen) gate.\n\nAround 1500, the civic graveyard was relocated from the town church to St. John's Church,<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> and in 1514, the ''Vierundzwanziger'' (\"Group of 24\") was the first assembly constituted by the citizens.\n\n===== Reformation =====\nDelegated by W\u00fcrttemberg's Duke [[Louis III, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Louis III]], on 28 June 1575, nearly 30 years after [[Martin Luther]]'s death, [[Jakob Andreae]], professor and chancellor of the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]], arrived in Aalen. The sermon he gave the following day convinced the mayor, the council, and the citizens to adopt the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the town. Andreae stayed in Aalen for four weeks to help with the change.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> This brought along enormous changes, as the council forbade the Roman Catholic priests to celebrate masses and give sermons. However, after victories of the imperial armies at the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Prince-Provost]]ry of Ellwangen, which still held the [[Jus patronatus|right of patronage]] in Aalen, were able to temporarily bring Catholicism back to Aalen; however after the military successes of the [[Protestant Union]], Protestant church practices were instituted again.\n\n===== Fire of 1634 =====\nOn the night of 5 September 1634,<ref name = GA>{{harvnb|Geschichtsverein Aalen (Historical Society of Aalen)|2013}}</ref> two ensigns of the army of [[Bernard of Saxe-Weimar]] who were fighting with the Swedes and retreating after the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen]] set fire to two powder carriages, to prevent the war material to fall into Croatian hands and to prevent their advance. The result was a conflagration, that some say destroyed portions of the town. There are differing stories regarding this fire. According to 17th-century accounts, the church and all the buildings, except of the ''Schw\u00f6rturm'' tower, were casualties of the fire, and only nine families survived. 19th century research by Hermann Bauer, Lutheran pastor and local historian, discovered that the 17th-century account is exaggerated, but he does agree that the town church and buildings in a \"rather large\" semicircle around it were destroyed. The fire also destroyed the town archive housed in an addition to the church, with all of its documents.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> After the fire, soldiers of both armies went through the town looting.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2013a}}</ref> It took nearly 100 years for the town to reach its population of 2,000.\n\n[[File:Free Imperial City of Aalen.JPG|thumb|Territory of the Imperial City of Aalen]]\n\nFrench troops marched through Aalen in 1688 during the [[Nine Years' War]]; however, unlike other places, they left without leaving severe damages. The French came through again in 1702 during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and in 1741 during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]],<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> the latter also caused imperial troops to move through in 1743.<ref>{{harvnb|Bauer|2012|p=135}}</ref>\n\nThe town church's tower collapsed in 1765, presumably because proper building techniques were not utilized during the reconstruction after the fire of 1634. The collapsing tower struck two children of the tower watchman who died of their injuries, and destroyed the nave, leaving only the altar cross intact. The remaining walls had to be knocked down due to the damage. Reconstruction began the same year, creating the building that exists today.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/>\n\nOn 22 November 1749, the so-called ''Aalen protocol'' regulating the cohabitation of Lutherans and Roman Catholics in the jointly ruled territory of Oberkochen was signed in Aalen by the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg and the Prince-Provostry of Ellwangen. Aalen had been chosen because of its neutral status as a Free Imperial City.\n\n===== Napoleonic era and end of the Imperial City of Aalen =====\n[[File:Angriff auf Aalen 1796.jpg|thumb|French attack on Aalen of 1796]]\nDuring the [[War of the First Coalition]] (1796), Aalen was looted.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> The War of the Second Coalition concluded in 1801 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]], which led to the [[German Mediatisation]] of 1803 that assigned most Imperial Cities to the neighbouring principalities. Aalen was assigned to the [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of W\u00fcrttemberg, which later became the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg, and became seat of the District (\"Oberamt\") of Aalen. During the [[War of the Third Coalition]], on 6 October 1805, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] arrived in Aalen, with an army of 40,000. This event, along with Bavarian and Austrian troops moving in some days later, caused miseries that according to the town clerk \"no feather could describe\".<ref name=\"bauer145\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1983|p=145}}</ref>\n\nIn 1811, the municipality of Unterrombach was formed out of some villages previously belonging to Aalen, some to the Barons of W\u00f6llwarth, and the eastern villages were assigned to the municipality of Unterkochen.\n\nIn the age of the Napoleonic wars, the [[town wall]]s were no longer of use, and in the 18th century, with the maintenance of walls, gates and towers becoming more neglected Finally, due to the fact that the funds were lacking, starting in 1800, most towers were demolished, the other buildings followed soon.<ref name=\"bauer145\"/>\n\n==== Industrial revolution ====\n[[File:Aalen nach 1861.jpg|thumb|Railway station and town after 1861]]\nBefore the [[industrial revolution]], Aalen's economy was shaped by its rural setting. Many citizens were pursuing farming besides their craft, such as [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]]. In the mid 19th century, there were twelve tanneries in Aalen, due to the proximity of [[Ulm]], an important sales market. Other crafts that added to the economy were [[Weaving|weaving mills]], which produced linen and woolen goods, and baking of sweet pastry and gingerbread.<ref name=\"bauer122\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1983|p=122}}</ref><ref name=\"eb1911\">{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=2}}</ref>\n\nIn Aalen, industrialisation was a slow process. The first major increase was in the 1840s, when three factories for [[Nail (fastener)|nails]] and some other factories emerged.<ref name=\"bauer122\"/> It was the link with the railway network, by the opening of the [[Rems Railway]] from [[Cannstatt]] to Wasseralfingen in 1861, that brought more industry to Aalen, along with the royal [[steel mill]] (later ''Schw\u00e4bische H\u00fcttenwerke'') in Wasseralfingen. The Rems Railway's extension to N\u00f6rdlingen in 1863, the opening of the [[Brenz Railway]] in 1864 and of the [[Upper Jagst Railway]] in 1866 turned Aalen into a [[railway hub]]. Furthermore, between 1901 and its shutdown in 1972, the [[H\u00e4rtsfeld Railway]] connected Aalen with [[Dillingen an der Donau]] via [[Neresheim]]. Part of becoming a rail hub entailed more jobs based on the rail industry. These included, a maintenance facility, a [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]], an administrative office, two track maintenance shops, and a freight station with an industrial [[branch line]]. This helped shape Aalen into what today's historians call a \"railwayman's town\".<ref name=\"Hafner Stadtf\u00fchrer\">{{harvnb|Hafner|1989|p=5}}</ref> Starting in 1866, the utilities in town all began to be upgraded. Starting with the Aalen [[gasworks]] which were opened and [[gas lighting]] was introduced. Then in 1870, a modern [[water supply]] system was started and in 1912 the [[mains electricity]]. Finally, in 1935, the first electrically powered [[street light]]s were installed.<ref name=\"bauer122\"/>\n\n[[File:Aalen-um-1900.jpg|thumb|left|Aalen by 1900]]\nTo fight housing shortage during and immediately after [[World War I]], the town set up barracks settlement areas at the ''Schlauch'' and ''Alter Turnplatz'' grounds. In spite of the industry being crippled by the [[Great Depression]] of 1929, the public baths at the Hirschbach creek where modernized, extended and re-opened in 1931.<ref name=\"Hafner Stadtf\u00fchrer\" />\n\n==== Nazi era ====\nIn the [[German federal election, November 1932|federal election of 1932]], the [[Nazi Party]] performed below average in Aalen with 25.8% of votes compared to 33.1% on the national level, thus finishing second to the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] which had 26.6% (11.9% nationwide) of the votes, and ahead of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] with 19.8% (20.4%). However, the [[German federal election, March 1933|March 1933 federal elections]] showed that the sentiment had changed as the Nazi Party received 34.1% (still below German average 43.9% nationwide), but by far the leading vote-getter in Aalen, followed by the Centre party at 26.6% (11.3% nationwide) and the Social Democrats 18.6% (18.3% nationwide).<ref>{{harvnb|Bauer|1984|p=273}}</ref>\n\nThe democratically elected mayor Friedrich Schwarz remained in office until the Nazis removed him from office, in 1934, and replaced him by chairman of the Nazi Party town council head and brewery owner Karl Barth. Karl Barth was a provisional mayor until the more permanent solution of Karl Sch\u00fcbel. In August 1934, the Nazi consumer fair [[Braune Messe]] (\"brown fair\") was held in Aalen.<ref name=\"Braune Messe\">{{harvnb|Anon|1934}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule in Germany]], there were many military offices constructed in Aalen, starting with, in 1936, a [[military district (Germany)|military district]] riding and driving school. The Nazis also built an army replenishment office ''(Heeresverpflegungsamt)'', a branch arsenal office ''(Heeresnebenzeugamt)'' and a branch army ammunitions institute ''(Heeresnebenmunitionsanstalt)''.\n\nStarting in 1935, [[Merger (politics)|mergers]] of neighbouring towns began. In 1938, the Oberamt was transformed into the [[Districts of Germany|Landkreis]] of Aalen and the municipality of Unterrombach was disbanded. Its territory was mostly added to Aalen, with the exception of Hammerstadt, which was added to the municipality of Dewangen. Forst, Rauental and Vogelsang were added to Essingen (in 1952 the entire former municipality of Unterrombach was merged into Aalen, with the exception of Forst, which is part of Essingen until present).\n\nIn September 1944, the ''Wiesendorf'' [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]], a [[List of subcamps of Natzweiler-Struthof|subcamp]] of [[Natzweiler-Struthof]], was constructed nearby. It was designated for between 200 and 300 prisoners who were utilized for [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labor in industrial businesses]] nearby. Until the camp's dissolution in February 1945, 60 prisoners died.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4tzle\">{{harvnb|Sch\u00e4tzle|1980|p=66}}</ref> Between 1946 and 1957, the camp buildings were torn down; however, its foundations are still in place in house ''Moltkestra\u00dfe 44/46''. Also, there were several other labour camps which existed where prisoners of war along with women and men from occupied countries occupied by Germany were pooled. The prisoners at these other camps had to work for the arms industry in major businesses like ''Schw\u00e4bische H\u00fcttenwerke'' and the ''Alfing Ke\u00dfler'' machine factory.<ref name=\"gedenkstaetten\">{{harvnb|Puvogel|Stankowski|Graf|1995|p=20}}</ref>\n\nIn the civic hospital, the [[deaconess]]es on duty were gradually replaced by [[National Socialist People's Welfare]] nurses. [[Nazi eugenics]] led to [[compulsory sterilization]] of some 200 persons there.<ref name=\"Einhorn 140\">{{harvnb|Nu\u00dfbaumer|2008|p=297}}</ref>\n\nFortunately, Aalen avoided most of the combat activity during [[World War II]]. It was only during the last weeks of the war that Aalen became a target of [[Air warfare of World War II|air warfare]], which led to the destruction and severe damage of parts of the town, the train station, and other railway installations. A series of air attacks lasting for more than three weeks reached its peak on 17 April 1945, when [[United States Army Air Forces]] planes bombed the branch arsenal office and the train station. During this raid, 59 people were killed, more than half of them buried by debris, and more than 500 lost their homes.<ref name=\"Aalen Luftangriffe\">{{harvnb|City of Aalen|2013l}}</ref> Also, 33&nbsp;residential buildings, 12&nbsp;other buildings and 2&nbsp;bridges were destroyed, and 163&nbsp;buildings, including 2&nbsp;churches, were damaged.<ref name=\"bauer145\"/> Five days later, the Nazi rulers of Aalen were unseated by the US forces.\n\n==== Post-war era ====\nAalen became part of the State of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], upon its creation in 1952. Then, with the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg territorial reform of 1973, the District of Aalen was merged into the [[Ostalbkreis]] district. Subsequently, Aalen became seat of that district, and in 1975, the town's borough attained its present size ([[#Mergings|see below]]).\n\nThe population of Aalen exceeded the limit of 20,000, which was the requirement for to gain the status of [[Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt]] (\"major district town\") in 1946. On 1 August 1947, Aalen was declared ''Unmittelbare Kreisstadt'' (\"immediate district town\"), and with the creation of the [[Gemeindeordnung]] (municipal code) of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg on 1 April 1956, it was declared ''Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt''.\n\n=== Religions ===\nOn 31 December 2008, 51.1&nbsp;percent of Aalen were members of the [[Catholic Church]], 23.9&nbsp;percent were members of the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg|Evangelical-Lutheran Church]]. About 25&nbsp;percent belong to other or no religious community or gave no information.<ref>{{harvnb|City of Aalen|2010}}</ref> The district of Waldhausen was the district with the highest percentage of Roman Catholic inhabitants at 75.6&nbsp;percent, and the central district was the one with the highest percentage of Evangelical-Lutheran inhabitants at 25.6&nbsp;percent, as well as those claiming no religious preference at 32.5&nbsp;percent.<ref name=\"stat. Jahrbuch\"/>\n\n==== Protestantism ====\nAalen's population originally was subject to the [[jus patronatus]] of Ellwangen Abbey, and thus subject to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Augsburg]].\n\nWith the assistance of the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1575, the [[reformation]] was implemented in Aalen. Subsequently, Aalen has been a predominantly Protestant town for centuries, with the exception of the years from 1628 until 1632 (see [[#Reformation|reformation]] section). Being an Imperial City, Aalen could govern its clerical matters on its own, so Clerics, organists and choir masters were direct subjects to the council, which thus exerted bishop-like power. There was even a proper hymn book for Aalen.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> After the transition to W\u00fcrttemberg, in 1803, Aalen became seat of a [[deanery]], with the dean church being the Town Church (with the building constructed from 1765 to 1767 and existing until present). Another popular church is [[John the Baptist|St. John's]] Church, located on the cemetery and refurbished in 1561.\n\nAs Aalen's population grew in the 20th century, more parishes were founded: [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark's]] parish with its church building of 1967 and [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin's]] parish with its church of 1974. In the borough of Unterrombach, Aalen had implemented the [[reformation]] as well, but the community remained a [[chapel of ease|chapel-of-ease]] of Aalen. A proper church, the Christ Church, was erected in 1912 and a proper parish was established in 1947. In Fachsenfeld, the ruling family of Woellwarth resp. of Leinroden implemented the reformation. A parish church was built in 1591, however with an influx of Catholics in the 18th century, a Catholic majority was established. The other districts of present-day Aalen remained mostly catholic after the reformation, however Wasseralfingen established a Lutheran parish in 1891 and a church, St. Magdalene's Church, in 1893. In Unterkochen, after World War II, a parish was established and a church was built in 1960. All four parishes belong to the deanery of Aalen within the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W\u00fcrttemberg]]. Furthermore, in Aalen there are [[Pietism|Old Pietistic]] communities.\n\n==== Catholicism ====\n[[File:Salvatorkirche aalen.jpg|thumb|upright|Salvator's Church]]\nThe few Catholics of today's central district were covered by the parish of Unterkochen until the 19th century, a situation which continued for some years even after completion of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|St. Mary's]] Church in 1868, which was constructed by [[Georg Morlok]].<ref name=\"bauer145\"/> However, in 1872 Aalen got its proper parish again, and in 1913, a second Catholic church, Salvator's Church, was completed, and in 1969 the Holy Cross Church was also finished. In 1963, a second parish was set up, and in 1972 it got a new Church, the new St. Mary's Church, which has been erected in place of the old St. Mary's church, which had been torn down in 1968. Another church of the second parish was St. Augustine's Church, which was completed in 1970. Finally, in 1976 and 1988, St. Elizabeth's Church and St. Thomas' Church were completed. Furthermore, in 1963, the St. Michael pastoral care office was built.\n\nHofherrnweiler has its own Catholic church, [[Saint Boniface|St. Boniface's]], since 1904. The villages of Dewangen, Ebnat, Hofen, Waldhausen and Wasseralfingen had remained Catholic after reformation, so old parishes and churches persist there. The ''Assumption of Mary'' Church in Dewangen has an [[Gothic art|early Gothic]] tower and a newly built nave (1875). [[Immaculate Conception|Mary's Immaculate Conception]] Church in Ebnat was constructed in 1723; however the church was first mentioned in 1298.\n\n[[File:Marienwallfahrtskirche Unterkochen.jpg|thumb|upright|St. Mary, Unterkochen]]\nHofen's [[Saint George]]'s Church is a [[fortified church]], whose current nave was built between 1762 and 1775.<ref>{{harvnb|Simla|2005}}</ref> Alongside the church, the Late Gothic [[Odile of Alsace|St. Odile's]] Chapel is standing, whose entrance has the year 1462 engraved upon it. Foundations of prior buildings have been dated to the 11th and 13th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Simla|2005a}}</ref>\n\nSt. Mary's Church of Unterkochen was first mentioned in 1248, and has served the Catholics of Aalen for a long time. Waldhausen's parish church of [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]] was built between 1699 and 1716. Wasseralfingen at first was a [[chapel of ease]] for Hofen, but has since had its own chapel, [[Saint Stephen|St. Stephen]], built. It was presumably built in 1353 and remodeled in 1832. In 1834, a proper parish was established, which built a new St. Stephen's Church. This new building utilized the [[Romanesque Revival architecture]] style and was built between 1881 and 1883, and has since remained the parish's landmark. Also, Fachsenfeld received its own church, named [[Sacred Heart]] in 1895. All Catholic parishes within Aalen are today incorporated into four pastoral care units within the ''Ostalb'' Deanery of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart|Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart]]; however these units also comprise some parishes outside of Aalen. Pastoral Care Unit two comprises the parishes of Essingen, Dewangen and Fachsenfeld, unit four comprises Hofen and Wasseralfingen, unit five comprises both parishes of Aalen's centre and Hofherrnweiler, unit five comprises Waldhausen, Ebnat, Oberkochen and Unterkochen.{{clarify|date=April 2013}}\n\n==== Other christian communities ====\nIn addition to the two major religions within Aalen, there are also [[free church]]es and other communities, including the [[United Methodist Church]], the [[Baptists]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and the [[New Apostolic Church]].\n\n==== Other religions ====\nUntil the late 19th century, no [[Jew]]s were documented within Aalen. In 1886 there were four Jews were living in Aalen, a number that rose to ten in 1900, fell to seven in 1905, and remained so until 1925. Upon the Nazis' rise to power in 1933, seven Jews, including two children, lived in Aalen.<ref name=\"Juden 1984\">{{harvnb|Bauer|1984|pp=302\u2013344}}</ref> During the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, the vitrines of the three Jewish shops in the town were smashed and their proprietors imprisoned for several weeks. After their release, most Aalen Jews emigrated. The last Jews of Aalen, Fanny Kahn, was forcibly resettled to [[Oberdorf am Ipf]], which had a large Jewish community. Today, a street of Aalen is named after her. The Jew Max Pfeffer returned from Brussels to Aalen in 1948 to continue his shop, but emigrated to Italy in 1967.<ref name=\"Juden 1984\"/>\n\nIn Aalen, there is an Islamic [[Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs|Ditib]] community, which maintains the ''D.I.T.I.B. Mosque of Aalen (Central Mosque)'' located at Ulmer Stra\u00dfe.<ref name=\"Moscheesuche Ditib\">{{harvnb|Anon|2013b}}</ref> The mosque's construction started on 30 August 2008. The [[Mill\u00ee G\u00f6r\u00fc\u015f]] organisation maintains the [[Mehmed II|Fatih]] Mosque, as well at Ulmer Stra\u00dfe.<ref name=\"Moscheesuche IGMG\">{{harvnb|Anon|2013c}}</ref>\n\n==== Mergings ====\nThe present-day make up of Aalen was created on 21 June 1975 by the unification of the cities of Aalen and Wasseralfingen,<ref name=munro>{{harvnb|Munro|1995|p=1}}</ref> with the initial name of ''Aalen-Wasseralfingen''. This annexation made Aalen's territory one third larger than its prior size. On 1 July 1975, the name ''Aalen'' was revived. Prior to this merger, the town of Aalen had already annexed the following municipalities:\n* 1938: Unterrombach\n* 1 January 1970: Waldhausen\n* 1 July 1972: Ebnat\n* 1 January 1973: Dewangen, Fachsenfeld (including the village of Hangendenbach, which was transferred from Abtsgm\u00fcnd in 1954) and Unterkochen. The merging of Dewangen nearly doubled the territory of Aalen.\n\n=== Population\u2019s progression and structure ===\n[[File:Population development Aalen.png|thumb|upright=2|Progression of Aalen's population]]\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[early modern period]], Aalen was just a small town with a few hundred inhabitants. The population grew slowly due to numerous wars, famines and epidemics. It was the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century where Aalen's growth accelerated. Whereas in 1803, only 1,932 people inhabited the town, in 1905 it had already increased to 10,442. The number continued to rise and reached 15,890 in 1939.\n\nThe influx of refugees and [[Heimatvertriebene|ethnic Germans]] from Germany's former eastern territories after [[World War II]] pushed the population to 31,814 in 1961. The merger with Wasseralfingen on 21 June 1975 added 14,597 persons and resulted in a total population of 65,165 people. On 30 June 2005, the population, which was officially determined by the [[List of statistical offices in Germany|Statistical Office of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], was 67,125.\n\nThe following overview shows how the population figures of the borough were ascertained. Until 1823, the figures are mostly estimates, thereafter census results or official updates by the state statistical office. Starting in 1871, the figures were determined by non-uniform method of tabulation using extrapolation.\n\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n!

In the 16th century, the town had two, sometimes three mayors, and in 1552, the council had 13 members. Later, the head of the administration was reorganized several times. In the W\u00fcrttemberg era, the mayor's title was initially called ''B\u00fcrgermeister'', then from 1819 it was [[Schulthei\u00df]], and since 1947 it is ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister''. The mayor is elected for a term of eight years, and he is chairman and a voting member of the council. He has one deputy with the official title of ''Erster B\u00fcrgermeister'' (\"first mayor\") and one with the official title of ''B\u00fcrgermeister'' (\"mayor\").\n[[File:Aalen Flag.svg|thumb|upright|Flag of Aalen]]\n'''Heads of town in Aalen since 1802'''\n* 1802\u2013{{0|0000}}: Theodor Betzler\n* 1812\u20131819: Ludwig H\u00f6lder\n* 1819\u20131829: Theodor Betzler\n* 1829:{{0|\u20130000}} Palm\n* 1829\u20131848: Philipp Ehmann\n* 1848\u20131873: Gustav Oesterlein\n* 1873\u20131900: Julius Bausch\n* 1900\u20131902: Paul Maier\n* 1903\u20131934: Friedrich Schwarz\n* 1935\u20131945: [[Karl Sch\u00fcbel]]\n* 1945\u20131950: [[Otto Balluff]]\n* 1950\u20131975: Karl Sch\u00fcbel\n* 1976\u20132005: [[Ulrich Pfeifle]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]])\n* 2005\u20132013: [[Martin Gerlach]] (independent)\n* 2013-{{0|0000}}: [[Thilo Rentschler]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]])\n\n=== Coat of arms and flag ===\n[[File:Stadtwappen Aalen 1766.JPG|thumb|100px|left|Coat of arms of 1766 with eagle and eel]]\nAalen's [[coat of arms]] depicts a black eagle with a red tongue on golden background, having a red shield on its breast with a bent silver [[eel]] on it. Eagle and eel were first acknowledged as Aalen's heraldic animals in the seal of 1385, with the eagle representing the town's [[imperial immediacy]].<ref name=\"bauer9\"/> After the territorial reform, it was bestowed again by the [[Stuttgart (region)|Administrative District of Stuttgart]] on 16 November 1976.\n\nThe coat of arms' [[blazon]] reads: \u201cIn gold, the black imperial eagle, with a red breast shield applied to it, therein a bent silver eel\u201d ''(In Gold der schwarze Reichsadler, belegt mit einem roten Brustschild, darin ein gekr\u00fcmmter silberner Aal)''.\n\nAalen\u2019s flag is striped in red and white and contains the coat of arms.\n\nThe origin of the town\u2019s name is uncertain. [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]] (1593\u20131650) presumed the name to originate from its location at the Kocher river, where \"frequently eels are caught\", while ''Aal'' is German for \"eel\". Other explanations point to Aalen as the garrison of an [[Ala (Roman allied military unit)|ala]] during the Roman empire, respectively to an abridgement of the Roman name  \"Aquileia\" as a potential name of the Roman fort, a name that nearby [[Heidenheim an der Brenz]] bore as well. Another interpretation points to a Celtic word '''aa''' meaning \"water\".<ref name=\"bauer9\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Twinned cities ===\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}\nThe \"Twin Cities Society of Aalen\" ''(St\u00e4dtepartnerschaftsverein Aalen e.&nbsp;V.)'' promotes \"friendly relations\" between Aalen and its [[Twin towns and sister cities|twin cities]],<ref>{{harvnb|City of Aalen|2013m}}</ref> which comprises mutual exchanges of sports and cultural clubs, schools and other civic institutions.

It opened in 1964.<ref name=EB>{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=2}}</ref> The museum exhibits numerous objects from the Roman era. The ruins of the cavalry fort located beside the museum is open to museum visitors. Every other year, a Roman festival is held in the area of the museum ([[#Roman Festival|see below]]).\n\nIn the Geological-Paleontological Museum located in the historic town hall, there are more than 1500 fossils from the Swabian Jura, including [[ammonite]]s, [[ichthyosaur]]s and [[coral]]s, displayed.\n\nIn the Waldhausen district the ''Heimatst\u00fcble'' museum of local history has an exhibition on agriculture and rural living.\n\nIn the Wasseralfingen district, there are two more museums: The ''Museum Wasseralfingen'' comprises a local history exhibition and an art gallery including works of [[Hermann Plock]], [[Helmut Schuster]] and [[Sieger K\u00f6der]]. Also, the [[stove]] plate collection of the ''Schw\u00e4bische H\u00fcttenwerke'' steel mill is exhibited, with artists, modellers and the production sequence of a cast plate from design to final product being presented.\n\n==== Memorial sites ====\n[[File:Gedenkstein Schillerlinde Wasseralfingen.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial stone at ''Schillerlinde'']]\nThere is memorial stone at the ''Schillerlinde'' tree above Wasseralfingen's ore pit dedicated to four prisoners of the subcamp of Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp killed there.

The tower was planned by [[Emil Leo]], the bell was endowed by Carl Schneider. The tower is open on request. Every evening at 18:45 (before 2003: at 19:45), the memorial's bell rings.<ref>{{harvnb|City of Aalen|2004}}</ref>\n\n=== Buildings ===\n==== Churches ====\n[[File:Johanneskirche Aalen.jpg|thumb|St. John's Church]]\n[[File:St. Stephanus, Wasseralfingen.jpg|thumb|upright|St. Stephen's Church, Wasseralfingen]]\nThe town centre is dominated by the Evangelical-Lutheran [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas']] Church in the heart of the pedestrian area. The church, in its present shape being built between 1765 and 1767, is the only major [[Late Baroque]] building in Aalen and is the main church of the Evangelical-Lutheran parish of Aalen.\n\n''St. John's Church'' is located inside of St. John's cemetery in the western centre. The building presumably is from the 9th century and thus is one of W\u00fcrttemberg's oldest existing churches. The interior features [[fresco]]s from the early 13th century.\n\nFor other churches in Aalen, see the [[#Religions|Religions]] section.\n\n==== Historic Town Hall with \"Spy\" ====\n[[File:Spionturm Aalen.jpg|thumb|upright|\"Spy's Tower\"]]\nThe Historic Town Hall was originally built in the 14th century. After the fire of 1634, it was re-constructed in 1636. This building received a clock from Lauterburg,<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> and the Imperial City of [[Nuremberg]] donated a [[Carillon]]. It features a figurine of the \"Spy of Aalen\" and historically displayed other figurines, however the latter ones were lost by a fire in 1884. Since then, the Spy resides inside the reconstructed tower and has become a symbol of the town. The building was used as the town hall until 1907. Since 1977, the Geological-Paleontological Museum resides in the Historic Town Hall.<ref name=\"Citybummel\">{{harvnb|City of Aalen|2013r}}</ref>\n\nAccording to legend, the citizens of Aalen owe the \"Spy of Aalen\" ''(Spion von Aalen)''  their town having been spared from destruction by the emperor's army:\n\n<blockquote>The Imperial City of Aalen once was were in quarrel with the emperor, and his army was shortly before the gates to take the town. The people of Aalen got scared and thus dispatched their \u201cmost cunning\u201d one out into the enemy\u2019s camp to spy out the strength of their troops. Without any digression, he went straight into the middle of the enemy camp, which inescapably led to him being seized and presented to the emperor. When the emperor asked him what he had lost here, he answered in [[Swabian German]]: \"Don't frighten, high lords, I just want to peek how many cannons and other war things you've got, since I am the spy of Aalen\". The emperor laughed upon such a blatancy and ''acted'' na\u00efvety, steered him all through the camp and then sent him back home. Soon the emperor withdrew with his army as he thought a town such ''wise guys'' reside in deserved being spared.<ref>{{harvnb|Meier|2013|p=368}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Old Town Hall ====\nThe earliest record of the Old Town Hall was in 1575. Its outside wall features the oldest known coat of arms, which is of 1664. Until 1851, the building also housed the ''Krone-Post'' hotel, which coincided with being a station of the [[Thurn-und-Taxis-Post|Thurn und Taxis postal company]]. It has housed many notable persons. Thus the so-called \"Napoleon Window\" with its \"N\" painted on reminds of the stay of French emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1805. According to legend, he rammed his head so hard it bled on this window, when he was startled by the noise of his soldiers ridiculing the \"Spy of Aalen\".<ref name=\"bauer145\"/> The building was used as Aalen's town hall from 1907 until 1975. Today it houses a cabaret caf\u00e9 and the stage of the Theatre of the Town of Aalen. The town has adopted the ''Wischau Linguistic Enclave Society'' due to their godparenthood and stores their traditional constumes in the building.\n\n==== B\u00fcrgerspital ====\nThe ''B\u00fcrgerspital'' (\"Civic Asylum\") is a [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] house erected on ''Spritzenhausplatz'' (\"Fire Engine House Square\") in 1702. Until 1873, it was used as civic hospital, then, later as a retirement home. After a comprehensive renovation in 1980 it was turned into a senior citizen's community centre.<ref name=\"Citybummel\"/>\n\n==== Limes-Thermen ====\nOn a slope of the ''Langert'' mountain, south of the town, the ''Limes-Thermen'' (\"Limes [[Thermae]]\") [[hot spring]]s are located. They were built in ancient Roman style and opened in 1985. The health spa is supplied with water about {{convert|34|to|36|C|F}}.\n\n==== Market square ====\nThe market square is the historic hub of Aalen and runs along about {{convert|150|m|ft}} from the town hall in the south to the Historic Town Hall and the Old Town Hall in the north, where it empties into ''Radgasse'' alley. Since 1809, it is site of the weekly market on Wednesday and Saturday. About {{convert|10|m|ft}} in front of the ''Reichsst\u00e4dter Brunnen'' fountain at the town hall, the coats of arms of Aalen, its twinned cities and of the Wischau linguistic enclave are paved into the street as mosaic.\n\n===== Market fountain =====\n[[File:Marktbrunnen Aalen.jpg|thumb|Statue depicting [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph&nbsp;I]] at the market fountain]]\nIn 1705, for the water supply of Aalen a well casing was erected at the northern point of the market square, in front of the Historic Town Hall. It was a present of duke [[Eberhard Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard Louis]]. The fountain bore a statue of emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph&nbsp;I.]], who was enthroned in 1705 and in 1707 renewed Aalen's Imperial City privileges.<ref name=\"bauer82\"/> The fountain was supplied via a wooden pipe. Excessive water was dissipated through ditches branched from Kocher river. When in the early 1870s Aalen's water network was constructed, the fountain was replaced by a smaller fountain about {{convert|100|m|ft}} distant. In 1975, the old market fountain was re-erected in baroque style. It bears a replica of the emperor's statue, with the original statue exhibited in the new town hall's lobby. The [[cast iron]] casing plates depict the 1718 coat of arms of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg and the coats of arms of Aalen and of the merged municipalities.\n\n===== Reichsst\u00e4dter Brunnen =====\nThe ''Reichsst\u00e4dter Brunnen'' fountain (\"Imperial Civic Fountain\") is located in front of the town hall at the southern point of the market square. It was created by sculptor [[Fritz Nuss]] in 1977 to commemorate Aalen's time as an Imperial City (1360\u20131803). On its circumference is a [[frieze]] showing bronze figurines illustrating the town's history.<ref name=\"Citybummel\"/>\n\n==== Radgasse ====\nThe ''Radgasse'' (\"Wheel Alley\") features Aalen's oldest fa\u00e7ade. Originally a small pond was on its side. The buildings were erected between 1659 and 1662 for peasants with citizenry privileges and renovated in the mid-1980s. The namesake for the alley was the \"Wheel\" tavern, which was to be found at the site of today's address ''Radgasse 15''.<ref name=\"Citybummel\"/>\n\n==== Tiefer Stollen ====\n[[File:Eingang Besucherbergwerk Tiefer Stollen heute.JPG|thumb|''Tiefer Stollen'' tourist mine]]\nThe former iron ore pit ''Wilhelm'' at Braunenberg hill was converted into the ''Tiefer Stollen'' tourist mine in order to remind of the old-day miners' efforts and to maintain it as a memorial of early industrialisation in the Aalen area. It has a mining museum open for visitors, and a [[mine railway]] takes visitors deep into the mountain. The Town of Aalen, a sponsorship association, and many citizens volunteered several thousand hours of labour to put the mine into its current state. As far as possible, things were left in the original state. In 1989, a sanitary gallery was established where respiratory diseases are treated within rest cures.{{clarify|date=April 2013}} Thus the Aalen village of R\u00f6thard, where the gallery is located, was awarded the title of \"Place with sanitary gallery service\" in 2004.<ref>{{harvnb|Pfeifle|2004}}</ref>\n\n==== Observatory ====\nThe Aalen Observatory was built in 1969 as school observatory for the Schubart [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]. In 2001, it was converted to a public observatory. Since then, it has been managed by the ''Astronomische Arbeitsgemeinschaft Aalen'' (\"Aalen Astronomical Society\"). It is located on Schillerh\u00f6he hill and features two [[refractive telescope]]s. They were manufactured by [[Carl Zeiss AG]] which has its headquarters in nearby Oberkochen and operates a manufacturing works in Aalen ([[#Economy and infrastructure|see below]]). In the observatory, guided tours and lectures are held regularly.\n\n==== Windpark Waldhausen ====\n[[File:Windrad Waldhausen 02.JPG|thumb|Wind turbine at Windpark Waldhausen]]\nThe ''Windpark Waldhausen'' [[wind farm]] began operations in early 2007. It consists of seven [[REpower]] MM92 wind turbines with a [[nameplate capacity]] of 2 MW each.<ref name=\"windpark_waldhausen\">{{harvnb|Windpark Waldhausen|2013}}</ref> The hub height of each wind turbine is {{convert|100|m|ft}}, with a rotor diameter of {{convert|92|m|ft}}.\n\n==== Aalb\u00e4umle observation tower ====\n[[File:Aalb\u00e4umle.jpg|thumb|upright|''Aalb\u00e4umle'' observation tower]]\nThe {{convert|26|m|ft}} tall ''Aalb\u00e4umle'' observation tower is built atop ''Langert'' mountain. This popular hiking destination was built in 1898 and was remodelled in 1992. It features a good view over Aalen and the Welland region, up to the Rosenstein mountain and Ellwangen. Beneath the tower, an adventure playground and a cabin is located. A flag on the tower signals whether the cabin's restaurant is open.\n\n=== Natural monuments ===\nThe Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Institute for Environment, Measurements and Natural Conservation has laid out six protected landscapes in Aalen (the ''Swabian Jura escarpment between Lautern and Aalen with adjacent territories'', the ''Swabian Jura escarpment between Unterkochen and Baiershofen'', the ''Hilllands around Hofen'', the ''Kugeltal and Ebnater Tal valleys with parts of Heiligental valley and adjacent territories'', ''Laubachtal valley'' and ''Lower Lein Valley with side valleys''), two sanctuary forests (''Glash\u00fctte'' and ''[[Kocher]] Origin''), 65 extensive [[natural monument]]s, 30 individual natural monuments and the following two [[protected areas]]:<ref>{{harvnb|State Institute for Environment, Measurements, and Nature Conservation Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|2013a}}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|24.1|ha|acre}} large ''Dellenh\u00e4ule'' protected area between Aalen's Waldhausen district and Neresheim's Elchingen district, created in 1969, is a sheep pasture with [[juniper]] and [[wood pasture]] of old willow oaks.<ref>{{harvnb|State Institute for Environment, Measurements, and Nature Conservation Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|2013b}}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|46.5|ha|acre}} large ''Goldsh\u00f6fer Sande'' protected area was established in 2000 and is situated between Aalen's Hofen district and H\u00fcttlingen.

[[:de:Emil Sioli|Emil Sioli]], a noted psychiatrist, was the dean of the asylum. Another neurologist, [[Franz Nissl]], began to work in the same asylum with Alzheimer.

Kraepelin became a mentor to Alzheimer, and the two worked very closely for the next several years. When Kraepelin moved to Munich to work at the Royal Psychiatric Hospital in 1903, he invited Alzheimer to join him.<ref name=\":0\"/> \n\nAt the time, Kraepelin was doing clinical research on psychosis in senile patients; Alzheimer, on the other hand, was more interested in the lab work of senile illnesses.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|title = Researching Dementia in Imperial Germany: Alois Alzheimer and the Economies of Psychiatric Practice|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11013-007-9060-4|journal=Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry|accessdate=14 July 2017|issn=0165-005X|pages=405\u201313|volume=31|issue=3|doi=10.1007/s11013-007-9060-4|first=Eric J.|last=Engstrom}}</ref> The two men would face many challenges involving the politics of the psychiatric community.

The 51-year-old patient had strange behavioral symptoms, including a loss of short-term memory; she became his obsession over the coming years. Auguste Deter was a victim of the politics of the time in the psychiatric community; the Frankfurt asylum was too expensive for her husband. Herr Deter made several requests to have his wife moved to a less expensive facility, but Alzheimer intervened in these requests. Ms. Deter remained at the Frankfurt asylum, where Alzheimer had made a deal to receive her records and brain upon her death.<ref name=\":1\"/> \n\nOn 8 April 1906, Frau Deter died, and Alzheimer had her medical records and brain brought to Munich where he was working in Kraepelin's laboratory.

Based in [[Rome#Monarchy.2C republic.2C empire|Rome]], the aediles were responsible for maintenance of public buildings (''aed\u0113s'') and regulation of public [[festival]]s. They also had powers to enforce public order.\n\nThere were two pairs of aediles: the first were the \"plebeian aediles\" (Latin ''aediles plebis'') and possession of this office was limited to plebeians; the other two were \"curule aediles\" (Latin ''aediles curules''), open to both plebeians and patricians, in alternating years. An ''aedilis curulis'' was classified as a ''magister curulis''.\n\nThe office of the aedilis was generally held by young men intending to follow the [[cursus honorum]] to high political office, traditionally after their [[quaestor]]ship but before their [[praetor]]ship. It was not a compulsory part of the cursus, and hence a former quaestor could be elected to the praetorship without having held the position of aedile. However, it was an advantageous position to hold because it demonstrated the aspiring politician's commitment to public service, as well as giving him the opportunity to hold public festivals and games, an excellent way to increase his name recognition and popularity.\n\n==History of the office==\n===Plebeian aediles===\nThe plebeian aediles were created in the same year as the [[Tribune|Tribunes of the People]] (494 BC). Originally intended as assistants to the tribunes, they guarded the rights of the plebs with respect to their headquarters, the Temple of Ceres.  Subsequently, they assumed responsibility for maintenance of the city's buildings as a whole.<ref>McCullough, 938</ref>  Their duties at first were simply ministerial. They were the assistants to the tribunes in whatever matters that the tribunes might entrust to them, although most matters with which they were entrusted were of minimal importance. Around 446 BC, they were given the authority to care for the decrees of the senate (''senatus consulta''). When a ''senatus consultum'' was passed, it would be transcribed into a document, and deposited in the public treasury, the ''[[Aerarium]]''. They were given this power because the [[Roman consul|Roman Consuls]], who had held this power before, arbitrarily suppressed and altered the documents.<ref name=\"Liv. III.55\">Liv. III.55</ref> They also maintained the acts of the [[Plebeian Council]] (popular assembly), the \"plebiscites\". Plebiscites, once passed, were also transcribed into a physical document for storage. While their powers grew over time, it is not always easy to distinguish the difference between their powers, and those of the [[Roman censor|Roman Censors]]. Occasionally, if a Censor was unable to carry out one of his tasks, an Aedile would perform the task instead.\n\n===Curule aediles===\nAccording to [[Livy]] (vi. 42), after the passing of the [[Lex Licinia Sextia|Licinian rogations]] in 367 BC, an extra day was added to the Roman games; the plebeian aediles refused to bear the additional expense, whereupon the patricians offered to undertake it, on condition that they were admitted to the aedileship. The plebeians accepted the offer, and accordingly two ''curule'' aediles were appointed\u2014at first from the patricians alone, then from patricians and plebeians in turn, lastly, from either\u2014at the [[Tribal Assembly]] under the presidency of the consul.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Curule Aediles, as formal magistrates, held certain honors that Plebeian Aediles (who were not technically magistrates), did not hold. Besides having the right to sit on a [[Curule Chair]] (''sella curulis'') and to wear a [[toga|toga praetexta]], the Curule Aediles also held the power to issue edicts (''jus edicendi''). These edicts often pertained to matters such as the regulation of the public markets, or what we might call \"economic regulation\".<ref>Cic. Verr. V.14</ref> [[Livy]] suggests, perhaps incorrectly, that both Curule as well as Plebeian Aediles were sacrosanct.<ref name=\"Liv. III.55\"/> Although the curule aediles always ranked higher than the plebeian, their functions gradually approximated and became practically identical.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Within five days after the beginning of their terms, the four Aediles (two Plebeian, two Curule) were required to determine, by lot or by agreement among themselves, what parts of the city each should hold jurisdiction over.<ref>''[[Tabula Heracleensis]]'', ed. Alessio Simmacho Mazzocchi</ref>\n\n===Differences between the two===\nThere was a distinction between the two sets of Aediles when it came to public festivals. Some festivals were Plebeian in nature, and thus were under the superintendence of Plebeian Aediles.<ref>Liv. XXXI.56</ref> Other festivals were supervised exclusively by the Curule Aediles,<ref>Liv. XXXI.50</ref> and it was often with these festivals that the Aediles would spend lavishly. This was often done so as to secure the support of voters in future elections. Because Aediles were not reimbursed for any of their public expenditures, most individuals who sought the office were independently wealthy. Since this office was a stepping stone to higher office and the Senate, it helped to ensure that only wealthy individuals (mostly landowners) would win election to high office. These extravagant expenditures began shortly after the end of [[Second Punic War]], and increased as the spoils returned from Rome's new eastern conquests. Even the decadence of the emperors rarely surpassed that of the Aediles under the Republic, as could have been seen during [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] Aedileship.<ref>Plut. Caesar, 5</ref>\n\n==Election to the office==\nPlebeian aediles were elected by the [[Plebeian Council]], usually while under the presidency of a [[Plebeian Tribune]]. Curule aediles were elected by the [[Tribal Assembly]], usually while under the presidency of a [[Roman Consul|consul]]. Since the plebeian aediles were elected by the [[plebeians]], rather than by all of the [[SPQR|People of Rome]] (plebeians as well as members of the [[Patrician (Ancient Rome)|Patrician]] aristocracy), they were not technically [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]]. Before the passage of the ''[[Lex Villia Annalis|lex annalis]]'', individuals could run for the aedileship by the time they turned twenty-seven. After the passage of this law in 180 BC, a higher age was set, probably thirty-five.<ref>Livy, XL.44</ref> By the 1st century BC, aediles were elected in July, and took office on the first day in January.\n\n==Powers of the office==\n[[Cicero]] ([[de Legibus|Legg.]] iii. 3, 7) divides these functions under three heads:\n\n(1) Care of the city:\nthe repair and preservation of temples, sewers and aqueducts; street cleansing and paving; regulations regarding traffic, dangerous animals and dilapidated buildings; precautions against fire; superintendence of baths and taverns; enforcement of [[sumptuary]] laws; punishment of gamblers and usurers; the care of public morals generally, including the prevention of foreign superstitions and the registration of [[meretrix|meretrices]].  They also punished those who had too large a share of the [[ager publicus]], or kept too many cattle on the state pastures.\n\n(2) Care of provisions:\ninvestigation of the quality of the articles supplied and the correctness of weights and measures; the purchase of grain for disposal at a low price in case of necessity.\n\n(3) Care of the games: \nsuperintendence and organization of the public games, as well as of those given by themselves and private individuals (e.g. at funerals) at their own expense. \nAmbitious persons often spent enormous sums in this manner to win the popular favor with a view to official advancement.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Under the Empire==\nIn 44 BC [[Julius Caesar]] added two plebeian aediles, called ''Cereales'', whose special duty was the care of the cereal (grain) supply.  Under [[Augustus]] the office lost much of its importance, its judicial functions and the care of the games being transferred to the praetor, while its city responsibilities were limited by the appointment of a [[praefectus urbi]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Augustus took for himself its powers over various religious duties. By stripping it of its powers over temples, Augustus effectively destroyed the office, by taking from it its original function. After this point, few people were willing to hold such a powerless office, and Augustus was even known to compel individuals into holding the office. Augustus accomplished this by randomly selecting former tribunes and quaestors for the office.<ref>Dio Cassius LV.24</ref> Future emperors would continue to dilute the power of the office by transferring its powers to newly created offices. However, the office did retain some powers over licentiousness and disorder, in particular over the baths and brothels, as well as the registration of prostitutes.<ref>Tacitus ''Annales'', II.85</ref> In the 3rd century, it disappeared altogether.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nUnder the Empire, Roman colonies and cities often had officials with powers similar to those of the republican aediles, although their powers widely varied. It seems as though they were usually chosen annually.<ref>De Aedil. Col, &c. Otto. Lips. 1732</ref> Today in [[Portugal]] the county mayor can still be referred to as ''edil'' (e.g. 'O edil de Coimbra', meaning 'the mayor of [[Coimbra]]'), a way of reference used also in Romania for any mayors (ex. 'Edil al Bucure\u0219tiului', meaning 'mayor of Bucharest'). In Spain (and Latin America) the members of municipal councils are called ''concejales'' or ''ediles''.\n\n== Shakespeare ==\nIn his play ''[[Coriolanus]]'', [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] references the aediles. However, they are minor characters, and their chief role is to serve as policemen.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last=Shakespeare\n|first=William\n|title=The Tragedies of William Shakespeare\n|publisher=Random House, Inc.\n|isbn=0-679-60129-5\n|pages=1266\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aetheling]]\n* [[Agoranomi]]\n* [[Constitution of the Roman Republic]]\n* [[Ethel]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Aedile |volume=1 |page=244}} This cites:\n* Schubert, ''De Romanorum Aedilibus'' (1828)\n* Hoffmann, ''De Aedilibus Romanis'' (1842)\n* G\u00f6ll, ''De Aedilibus sub Caesarum Imperio'' (1860)\n* Labatut, ''Les \u00c9diles et les moeurs'' (1868)\n* [[Joachim Marquardt|Marquardt]]-[[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], ''Handbuch der r\u00f6mischen Altert\u00fcmer'', ii.

The former was first created in Missouri in 1921, with both being merged in 1929 into holding company [[The Aviation Corporation]].  This in turn, was made in 1930 into an operating company and rebranded as American Airways.  In 1934, when new laws and attrition of mail contracts forced many airlines to reorganize, the corporation redid its routes into a connected system, and was renamed American Airlines.  Between 1970 and 2000, the company grew into being an international carrier, purchasing [[Trans World Airlines]] in 2001.\n\nIn 2011, due to a downturn in the airline industry, American Airlines' parent company [[AMR Corporation]] filed for bankruptcy protection.

(a) illustrates sequentially the steps involved in Auger deexcitation. An incident electron (or photon) creates a core hole in the 1s level. An electron from the 2s level fills in the 1s hole and the transition energy is imparted to a 2p electron which is emitted. The final atomic state thus has two holes, one in the 2s orbital and the other in the 2p orbital. (b) illustrates the same process using [[spectroscopic notation]], KL<sub alt=\"KL_1L_{2,3}\">1</sub>L<sub>2,3</sub>.]]\nThe '''Auger effect''' is a physical phenomenon in which the filling of an [[Inner-shell electrons|inner-shell]] vacancy of an [[atom]] is accompanied by the emission of an [[electron]] from the same atom.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=Auger effect|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00520.html}}</ref> When a [[core electron]] is removed, leaving a vacancy, an electron from a higher energy level may fall into the vacancy, resulting in a release of [[energy]]. Although most often this energy is released in the form of an emitted [[photon]], the energy can also be transferred to another electron, which is ejected from the atom; this second ejected electron is called an '''Auger electron'''.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=Auger electron|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00521.html}}</ref> The effect was first discovered by [[Lise Meitner]] in 1922; [[Pierre Victor Auger]] independently discovered the effect shortly after and is credited with the discovery in most of the scientific community,<ref name=\"grant2003\">{{cite book |last=Grant |first= John T.|year=2003 |title=Surface Analysis by Auger and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy |location=Chichester |publisher=IM Publications |isbn=1-901019-04-7 |author2=David Briggs}}</ref> in accordance with [[Stigler's law of eponymy]].\n\nUpon ejection, the [[kinetic energy]] of the Auger electron corresponds to the difference between the energy of the initial [[electronic transition]] into the vacancy and the [[ionization energy]] for the [[electron shell]] from which the Auger electron was ejected. These energy levels depend on the type of atom and the chemical environment in which the atom was located.\n\n[[Auger electron spectroscopy]] involves the emission of Auger electrons by bombarding a sample with either [[X-ray]]s or energetic electrons and measures the intensity of Auger electrons that result as a function of the Auger electron energy. The resulting spectra can be used to determine the identity of the emitting atoms and some information about their environment.\n\n[[Carrier generation and recombination#Auger recombination|Auger recombination]] is a similar Auger effect which occurs in [[semiconductor]]s. An electron and [[electron hole]] (electron-hole pair) can recombine giving up their energy to an electron in the conduction band, increasing its energy. The reverse effect is known as [[impact ionization]].\n\nThe Auger effect can impact biological molecules such as DNA. Following the K-shell ionization of the component atoms of DNA, auger electrons are ejected leading to damage of its sugar-phosphate backbone.<ref>Akinari Yokoya & Takashi Ito (2017) Photon-induced Auger effect in biological systems: a review,International Journal of Radiation Biology, 93:8, 743-756, DOI: 10.1080/09553002.2017.1312670</ref>\n\n==Discovery==\nThe Auger emission process was observed and published in 1922 by [[Lise Meitner]],<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01326962|author=L.

Morita's family was involved in [[sake]], [[miso]] and [[soy sauce]] production in the village of Kosugaya (currently a part of [[Tokoname, Aichi|Tokoname City]]) on the western coast of [[Chita Peninsula]] in [[Aichi Prefecture]] since 1665. He was the oldest of four siblings and his father Kyuzaemon trained him as a child to take over the family business. Akio, however, found his true calling in mathematics and physics, and in 1944 he graduated from [[Osaka University|Osaka Imperial University]] with a degree in physics. He was later commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], and served in [[World War II]]. During his service, Morita met his future business partner Masaru Ibuka in the Navy's Wartime Research Committee.\n\n==Sony==\nOn May 7, 1946, Ibuka founded<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/199801/ibuka-e.html|title=Sony Global - Press Release - Masaru Ibuka 1908-1997|website=www.sony.net}}</ref> ''Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha'' (Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, the forerunner of Sony Corporation) with about 20 employees and initial capital of \u00a5190,000. Ibuka was 38 years old. Morita, 25 years old joined ''Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha'' shortly after its inception, with Morita's family investing in Sony during the early period and being the largest shareholder.\n\nIn 1949, the company developed magnetic recording tape and in 1950, sold the first [[tape recorder]] in Japan. In 1957, it produced a pocket-sized radio (the first to be fully [[transistor]]ized), and in 1958, Morita and Ibuka decided to rename their company Sony (derived from \"sonus\"\u2014\u2013[[Latin]] for \"sound\"\u2014\u2013and ''Sonny-boys'' the most common American expression).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Akio_Morita |title=Akio Morita |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> Morita was an advocate for all the products made by [[Sony]]. However, since the radio was slightly too big to fit in a shirt pocket, Morita made his employees wear shirts with slightly larger pockets to give the radio a \"pocket sized\" appearance. In 1960, it produced the first [[transistor]] television in the world. In 1973, Sony received an [[Emmy Award]] for its [[Trinitron]] television-set technology. In 1975, it released the first [[Betamax]] home video recorder, a year before [[VHS]] format came out. In 1979, the [[Walkman]] was introduced, making it one of the world's first portable music players. In 1984, Sony launched the [[Discman]] series which extended their Walkman brand to portable CD products.\n\nIn 1960, the Sony Corporation of America (SONAM, currently abbreviated as SCA) was established in the United States. In 1961, Sony Corporation was the first Japanese company to be listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], in the form of [[American depositary receipt]]s (ADRs), which are traded over-the-counter. Sony bought CBS Records Group<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-19/business/fi-22750_1_cbs-records | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Paul | last1=Richter | first2=WILLIAM K. | last2=KNOEDELSEDER Jr | title=Sony Buys CBS Record Division for $2 Billion After Months of Talks | date=November 19, 1987}}</ref> which consisted of [[Columbia Records]], [[Epic Records]] and other CBS labels in 1988 and Columbia Pictures Entertainment ([[Columbia Pictures]], [[TriStar Pictures]] and others) in 1989.\n\nOn November 25, 1994, Morita stepped down as Sony chairman after suffering a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] while playing tennis. He was succeeded by [[Norio Ohga]], who had joined the company in the 1950s after sending Morita a letter denouncing the poor quality of the company's tape recorders.\n\n==Other affiliations==\nMorita was vice chairman of the [[Japan Business Federation]] ([[Japan Federation of Economic Organizations]]), and was a member of the Japan-U.S. Economic Relations Group, also known as the \"Wise Men's Group\". He was also the third Japanese chairman of the [[Trilateral Commission]]. His amateur radio call sign is JP1DPJ.\n\n==Publications==\nIn 1966, Morita wrote a book called ''Gakureki Muy\u014d Ron'' (\u5b66\u6b74\u7121\u7528\u8ad6, Never Mind School Records), where he stresses that school records are not important to success or one's business skills. In 1986, Morita wrote an autobiography titled ''[[Made in Japan (biography)|Made in Japan]]''. He co-authored the 1991 book ''[[The Japan That Can Say No]]'' with politician [[Shintaro Ishihara]], where they criticized American business practices and encouraged Japanese to take a more independent role in business and foreign affairs. (Actually, Morita had no intention to criticize American practices at that time.) The book was translated into English and caused controversy in the United States, and Morita later had his chapters removed from the English version and distanced himself from the book.<ref>City Mayors [http://www.citymayors.com/mayors/tokyo_mayor.html Shintaro Ishihara Governor of Tokyo 7 September 2012] Retrieved on September 22, 2012</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nMorita was awarded the [[Albert Medal (Royal Society of Arts)|Albert Medal]] by the United Kingdom's [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 1982, the first Japanese to receive the honor. Two years later, he received the prestigious [[Legion of Honour]], and in 1991, was awarded the First Class [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]] from the [[Akihito|Emperor of Japan]]. In 1993, he was awarded an honorary [[Order of the British Empire|British knighthood (KBE)]]. Morita received the International Distinguished Entrepreneur Award from the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1987. He was posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] in 1999.\n\n==Death==\nMorita suffered a stroke in 1993, during a game of tennis.

This contrasts with a [[cathode]], an electrode through which conventional current leaves an electrical device.  A common [[mnemonic]] is ACID for \"anode current into device\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Denker |first=John |date=2004 |url=http://www.av8n.com/physics/anode-cathode.htm#sec-def |title=How to Define Anode and Cathode |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060328234449/http://www.av8n.com/physics/anode-cathode.htm |archive-date=28 March 2006 |website=av8n.com}}</ref> The direction of conventional current (the flow of positive charges) in a circuit is opposite to the direction of [[electron]] flow, so (negatively charged) electrons flow out the anode into the outside circuit. In a [[galvanic cell]], the anode is the [[electrode]] at which the [[oxidation reaction]] occurs.\n\nAn '''anode''' is also the wire or plate having excess positive charge.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Chemistry |last=Pauling |first=Linus |date=1975 |publisher=W. H. Freeman |last2=Pauling |first2=Peter |isbn=0716701766 |location=San Francisco |oclc=1307272}}</ref> Consequently, anions will tend to move towards the anode.\n\n==Charge flow==\nThe terms anode and [[cathode]] are not defined by the voltage polarity of electrodes but the direction of current through the electrode.  An anode is an electrode through which [[conventional current]] (positive charge) flows into the device from the external circuit, while a cathode is an electrode through which conventional current flows out of the device.  If the current through the electrodes reverses direction, as occurs for example in a [[rechargeable battery]] when it is being charged, the naming of the electrodes as anode and cathode is reversed.\n\nConventional current depends not only on the direction the [[charge carrier]]s move, but also the carriers' [[electric charge]]. The currents outside the device are usually carried by [[electron]]s in a metal conductor. Since electrons have a negative charge, the direction of electron flow is opposite to the direction of conventional current.  Consequently, electrons leave the device through the anode and enter the device through the cathode.\n\nThe definition of anode and cathode is slightly different for electrical devices such as [[diode]]s and [[vacuum tube]]s where the electrode naming is fixed and does not depend on the actual charge flow (current).  These devices usually allow substantial current flow in one direction but negligible current in the other direction.  Therefore the electrodes are named based on the direction of this \"forward\" current.  In a diode the anode is the terminal through which current enters and the cathode is the terminal through which current leaves, when the diode is [[forward bias]]ed.  The names of the electrodes do not change in cases where reverse current flows through the device.   Similarly, in a vacuum tube only one electrode can emit electrons into the evacuated tube due to being heated by a filament, so electrons can only enter the device from the external circuit through the heated electrode.  Therefore this electrode is permanently named the cathode, and the electrode through which the electrons exit the tube is named the anode.\n\n==Examples==\nThe polarity of voltage on an anode with respect to an associated [[cathode]] varies depending on the device type and on its operating mode. In the following examples, the anode is negative in a device that provides power, and positive in a device that consumes power:\n\nIn a discharging battery or [[galvanic cell]] (diagram at right), the anode is the negative terminal because it is where conventional current flows into \"the device\" (i.e. the battery cell). This inward current is carried externally by electrons moving outwards, negative charge flowing in one direction being electrically equivalent to positive charge flowing in the opposite direction.\n\nIn a recharging battery, or an [[electrolytic cell]], the anode is the positive terminal, which receives current from an external generator. The current through a recharging battery is opposite to the direction of current during discharge; in other words, the electrode which was the cathode during battery discharge becomes the anode while the battery is recharging.\n\nIn a [[diode]], the anode is the positive terminal at the tail of the arrow symbol (flat side of the triangle), where current flows into the device. Note electrode naming for diodes is always based on the direction of the forward current (that of the arrow, in which the current flows \"most easily\"), even for types such as [[Zener diode]]s or solar cells where the current of interest is the reverse current.\n\nIn a [[cathode ray tube]], the anode is the positive terminal where electrons flow out of the device, i.e., where positive electric current flows in.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word was coined in 1834 from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u1f04\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 (''anodos''), 'ascent', by [[William Whewell]], who had been consulted<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ross, S|title=Faraday Consults the Scholars: The Origins of the Terms of Electrochemistry|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume= 16|issue= 2|year= 1961|pages= 187\u2013220|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1961.0038}}</ref> by [[Michael Faraday]] over some new names needed to complete a paper on the recently discovered process of [[electrolysis]]. In that paper Faraday explained that when an electrolytic cell is oriented so that electric current traverses the \"decomposing body\" (electrolyte) in a direction \"from East to West, or, which will strengthen this help to the memory, that in which the sun appears to move\", the anode is where the current enters the electrolyte, on the East side: \"''ano'' upwards, ''odos'' a way; the way which the sun rises\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Faraday, Michael|title=Experimental Researches in Electricity.

Previously, as related in the first reference cited above, Faraday had used the more straightforward term \"eisode\" (the doorway where the current enters). His motivation for changing it to something meaning 'the East electrode' (other candidates had been \"eastode\", \"oriode\" and \"anatolode\") was to make it immune to a possible later change in the direction convention for [[electric current|current]], whose exact nature was not known at the time. The reference he used to this effect was the Earth's magnetic field direction, which at that time was believed to be invariant. He fundamentally defined his arbitrary orientation for the cell as being that in which the internal current would run parallel to and in the same direction as a hypothetical [[solenoid|magnetizing current loop]] around the local line of latitude which would induce a magnetic [[dipole]] field oriented like the Earth's. This made the internal current East to West as previously mentioned, but in the event of a later convention change it would have become West to East, so that the East electrode would not have been the 'way in' any more. Therefore, \"eisode\" would have become inappropriate, whereas \"anode\" meaning 'East electrode' would have remained correct with respect to the unchanged direction of the actual phenomenon underlying the current, then unknown but, he thought, unambiguously defined by the magnetic reference. In retrospect the name change was unfortunate, not only because the Greek roots alone do not reveal the anode's function any more, but more importantly because as we now know, the Earth's magnetic field direction on which the \"anode\" term is based is subject to [[Geomagnetic reversal|reversals]] whereas the [[electric current|current]] direction convention on which the \"eisode\" term was based has no reason to change in the future.\n\nSince the later discovery of the [[electron]], an easier to remember and more durably correct technically although historically false, etymology has been suggested: anode, from the Greek ''anodos'', 'way up', 'the way (up) out of the cell (or other device) for electrons'.\n\n==Electrolytic anode==\nIn [[electrochemistry]], the ''anode'' is where [[oxidation]] occurs and is the positive polarity contact in an [[electrolytic cell]].<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications |title=IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology |edition=2nd |last1=McNaught |first1=A. D. |last2=Wilkinson |first2=A. |place=Oxford |year=1997 |isbn=0-9678550-9-8 |doi=10.1351/goldbook.A00370}}</ref> At the anode, [[anion]]s (negative ions) are forced by the electrical potential to react chemically and give off electrons (oxidation) which then flow up and into the driving circuit. [[List of chemistry mnemonics#Electrodes|Mnemonics]]: LEO Red Cat (Loss of Electrons is Oxidation, Reduction occurs at the Cathode), or AnOx Red Cat (Anode Oxidation, Reduction Cathode), or OIL RIG (Oxidation is Loss, Reduction is Gain of electrons), or Roman Catholic and Orthodox (Reduction \u2013 Cathode, anode \u2013 Oxidation), or LEO the lion says GER (Losing electrons is Oxidation, Gaining electrons is Reduction).\n\nThis process is widely used in metals refining.  For example, in copper refining, copper anodes, an intermediate product from the furnaces, are electrolysed in an appropriate solution (such as [[sulfuric acid]]) to yield high purity (99.99%) cathodes. Copper cathodes produced using this method are also described as [[electrolytic copper.]]\n\n==Battery or galvanic cell anode==\n[[File:Galvanic cell with no cation flow.png|thumb|right|Galvanic cell]]\nIn a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[galvanic cell]], the anode is the negative electrode from which electrons flow out towards the external part of the circuit. Internally the positively charged cations are flowing away from the anode (even though it is negative and therefore would be expected to attract them, this is due to [[electrode potential]] relative to the electrolyte solution being different for the anode and cathode metal/electrolyte systems); but, external to the cell in the circuit, electrons are being pushed out through the negative contact and thus through the circuit by the voltage potential as would be expected. Note: in a galvanic cell, contrary to what occurs in an electrolytic cell, no anions flow to the anode, the internal current being entirely accounted for by the cations flowing away from it (cf drawing).\n\nIn the United States, many battery manufacturers regard the positive electrode as the anode, particularly in their technical literature.  Though technically incorrect, it does resolve the problem of which electrode is the anode in a secondary (or rechargeable) cell.  Using the traditional definition, the anode switches ends between charge and discharge cycles.\n\n==Vacuum tube anode==\n[[File:Triode-english-text.svg|thumb|upright|Cutaway diagram of a triode vacuum tube, showing the plate (anode)]]\n\nIn electronic vacuum devices such as a [[cathode ray tube]], the [[Plate electrode|anode]] is the positively charged electron collector.  In a tube, the anode is a charged positive plate that collects the electrons emitted by the cathode through electric attraction.  It also accelerates the flow of these electrons.\n\n==Diode anode==\nIn a [[semiconductor]] [[diode]], the anode is the P-doped layer which initially supplies ''[[electron hole|holes]]'' to the junction.  In the junction region, the holes supplied by the anode combine with electrons supplied from the N-doped region, creating a depleted zone.  As the P-doped layer supplies holes to the depleted region, negative dopant ions are left behind in the P-doped layer ('P' for positive charge-carrier ions).  This creates a base negative charge on the anode.  When a positive voltage is applied to anode of the diode from the circuit, more ''[[electron hole|holes]]'' are able to be transferred to the depleted region, and this causes the diode to become conductive, allowing current to flow through the circuit.  The terms anode and cathode should not be applied to a [[Zener diode]], since it allows flow in either direction, depending on the polarity of the applied potential (i.e. voltage).\n[[File:Diode symbol.svg|Diode symbol]]\n\n==Sacrificial anode==\n[[File:Anodes-on-jacket.jpg|thumb|right|Sacrificial anodes mounted \"on the fly\" for corrosion protection of a metal structure]]\nIn [[cathodic protection]], a metal anode that is more reactive to the corrosive environment of the system to be protected is electrically linked to the protected system, and partially [[corrosion|corrodes]] or dissolves, which protects the metal of the system it is connected to.  As an example, an [[iron]] or [[steel]] [[hull (watercraft)|ship's hull]] may be protected by a zinc [[sacrificial anode]], which will dissolve into the seawater and prevent the hull from being corroded.  Sacrificial anodes are particularly needed for systems where a [[electrostatics|static charge]] is generated by the action of flowing liquids, such as pipelines and watercraft. Sacrificial anodes are also generally used in tank-type water heaters.\n\nIn 1824 to reduce the impact of this destructive electrolytic action on ships hulls, their fastenings and underwater equipment, the scientist-engineer Sir [[Humphry Davy]], developed the first and still most widely used marine electrolysis protection system. Davy installed sacrificial anodes made from a more electrically reactive (less noble) metal attached to the vessel hull and electrically connected to form a cathodic protection circuit.\n\nA less obvious example of this type of protection is the process of [[galvanise|galvanising]] iron.  This process coats iron structures (such as fencing) with a coating of [[zinc]] metal.  As long as the zinc remains intact, the iron is protected from the effects of corrosion.  Inevitably, the zinc coating becomes breached, either by cracking or physical damage.  Once this occurs, corrosive elements act as an electrolyte and the zinc/iron combination as electrodes.  The resultant current ensures that the zinc coating is sacrificed but that the base iron does not corrode.  Such a coating can protect an iron structure for a few decades, but once the protecting coating is consumed, the iron rapidly corrodes.\n\nIf, conversely, tin is used to coat steel, when a breach of the coating occurs it actually accelerates oxidation of the iron.\n\n==Related antonym==\nThe opposite of an anode is a [[cathode]].  When the current through the device is reversed, the [[electrode]]s switch functions, so anode becomes cathode, while cathode becomes anode, as long as the reversed current is applied, with the exception of diodes where electrode naming is always based on the forward current direction.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Anodizing]]\n*[[Battery (electricity)|Battery]]\n*[[Diode]]\n*[[Cathodic protection]]\n*[[Electrolysis]]\n*[[Galvanic anode]]\n*[[Gas-filled tube]]\n*[[Redox]] (oxidation-reduction)\n*[[Primary cell]]\n*[[Vacuum tube]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.crtsite.com The Cathode Ray Tube site]\n*[http://www.av8n.com/physics/anode-cathode.htm How to define anode and cathode]\n*[http://www.valence.com/technology/battery_overview.html Valence Technologies Inc. battery education page]\n*[http://www.cathodicprotectionpapers.com Cathodic Protection Technical Library]\n\n{{Galvanic cells}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Electrodes]]", "sha1": "m6tbw77tbnpbgl1nyvdkp0m4gpvt3hr"}}, {"title": "Analog television", "ns": "0", "id": "2393", "revision": {"id": "864731321", "parentid": "864386642", "timestamp": "2018-10-19T02:53:55Z", "contributor": {"ip": "89.107.5.192"}, "comment": "/* Color video signal extraction */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n{{technical|date=September 2014}}\n}}\n[[File:OTVbelweder-front.jpg|thumb|right|Early Monochrome analog receiver with large dials for volume control and channel selection, and smaller ones for fine-tuning, brightness, contrast, and horizontal and vertical hold adjustments]]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2012}}\n'''Analog television''' or '''analogue television''' is the original [[television]] technology that uses [[analog signal]]s to transmit video and audio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/guidance/tech-guidance/tv_tech_platform_code.pdf|title=Television Technical Performance Code|date=December 2006|publisher=Ofcom&nbsp;\u2013 office of Communications|accessdate=24 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704163159/http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/guidance/tech-guidance/tv_tech_platform_code.pdf|archivedate=4 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In an analog television broadcast, the brightness, colors and sound are represented by rapid variations of either the [[amplitude]], [[frequency]] or phase of the signal.\n\n[[Analog signal]]s vary over a continuous range of possible values which means that electronic noise and interference becomes reproduced by the receiver.  Thus with analog, a moderately weak signal becomes snowy and subject to interference. In contrast, a moderately weak digital signal and a very strong digital signal transmit equal picture quality. Analog television may be [[wireless]] or can be distributed over a cable network using [[cable converter]]s.\n\nAll [[broadcast television system]]s used analog signals before the arrival of [[digital television]] (DTV). Motivated by the lower bandwidth requirements of compressed digital signals, since the 2000s a [[digital television transition]] is proceeding in most countries of the world, with different deadlines for cessation of analog broadcasts.\n\n==Development==\n{{main article|History of television}}\n\nThe earliest systems of analog television were [[mechanical television]] systems, which used spinning disks with patterns of holes punched into the disc to scan an image. A similar disk reconstructed the image at the receiver. Synchronization of the receiver disc rotation was handled through sync pulses broadcast with the image information. However these mechanical systems were slow, the images were dim and flickered severely, and the image resolution very low. Camera systems used similar spinning discs and required intensely bright illumination of the subject for the light detector to work.\n\nAnalog television did not really begin as an industry until the development of the [[cathode-ray tube]] (CRT), which uses a focused electron beam to trace lines across a [[phosphor]] coated surface. The electron beam could be swept across the screen much faster than any mechanical disc system, allowing for more closely spaced scan lines and much higher image resolution. Also far less maintenance was required of an all-electronic system compared to a spinning disc system. All-electronic systems became popular with households after the [[World War II|Second World War]].\n\n===Standards===\n{{Further information|Broadcast television system}}\n\nBroadcasters of analog television encode their signal using different systems.  The official systems of transmission are named: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, K1, L, M and N.  These systems determine the number of scan lines, frame rate, channel width, video bandwidth, video-audio separation, and so on.\n\nThe colors in those systems are encoded with one of three color coding schemes: [[NTSC]], [[PAL]], or [[SECAM]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkbox.tv/server/show/conGlossary.252|title=TV Technology PAL|work=Publication date unknown|publisher=Thinkbox|accessdate=24 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101205214352/http://thinkbox.tv/server/show/conGlossary.252| archivedate= 5 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and then use [[RF modulation]] to modulate this signal onto a [[very high frequency]] (VHF) or [[ultra high frequency]] (UHF) carrier. Each frame of a television image is composed of lines drawn on the screen. The lines are of varying brightness; the whole set of lines is drawn quickly enough that the human eye perceives it as one image. The next sequential frame is displayed, allowing the depiction of motion. The analog television signal contains timing and synchronization information, so that the receiver can reconstruct a two-dimensional moving image from a one-dimensional time-varying signal.\n\nThe first [[commercial television]] systems were [[black-and-white]]; the beginning of [[color television]] was in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blcolortelevision.htm|title=Color Television History|work=Publication date unknown|publisher=About.com|accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nA practical television system needs to take [[luma (video)|luminance]], [[chrominance]] (in a color system), synchronization (horizontal and vertical), and [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] signals, and broadcast them over a radio transmission. The transmission system must include a means of [[television channel]] selection.\n\nAnalog [[broadcast television systems]] come in a variety of frame rates and resolutions. Further differences exist in the frequency and modulation of the audio carrier. The monochrome combinations still existing in the 1950s are standardized by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) as capital letters A through N. When color television was introduced, the hue and saturation information was added to the monochrome signals in a way that black and white televisions ignore. In this way backwards compatibility was achieved. That concept is true for all analog television standards.\n\nThere were three standards for the way the additional color information can be encoded and transmitted. The first was the American NTSC (National Television Systems Committee) color television system. The European/Australian PAL (Phase Alternation Line rate) and the French-former Soviet Union SECAM (S\u00e9quentiel Couleur Avec M\u00e9moire) standard were developed later and attempt to cure certain defects of the NTSC system. PAL's color encoding is similar to the NTSC systems. SECAM, though, uses a different modulation approach than PAL or NTSC.\n\nIn principle, all three color encoding systems can be combined with any scan line/frame rate combination. Therefore, in order to describe a given signal completely, it's necessary to quote the color system and the broadcast standard as a capital letter. For example, the United States, Canada, Mexico and South Korea use NTSC-M (many of these transitioned or transitioning to digital), Japan uses NTSC-J (discontinued in 2012, when Japan transitioned to digital (ISDB)), the UK uses PAL-I (discontinued in 2012, when UK transitioned to digital (DVB-T)), France uses SECAM-L (discontinued in 2011, when France transitioned to digital (DVB-T)), much of Western Europe and Australia use PAL-B/G  (Many of these transitioned or transitioning to DVB-T as digital television standards), most of Eastern Europe uses SECAM-D/K or PAL-D/K and so on.\n\nHowever, not all of these possible combinations actually exist. NTSC is currently only used with system M, even though there were experiments with NTSC-A (405 line) in the UK and NTSC-N (625 line) in part of South America. PAL is used with a variety of 625-line standards (B,G,D,K,I,N) but also with the North American 525-line standard, accordingly named [[PAL-M]]. Likewise, SECAM is used with a variety of 625-line standards.\n\nFor this reason many people refer to any 625/25 type signal as \"PAL\" and to any 525/30 signal as \"NTSC\", even when referring to digital signals; for example, on [[DVD-Video]], which does not contain any analog color encoding, and thus no PAL or NTSC signals at all. Even though this usage is common, it is misleading, as that is not the original meaning of the terms PAL/SECAM/NTSC.\n\nAlthough a number of different broadcast television systems were in use worldwide, the same principles of operation apply.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.paradiso-design.net/TVsystems_worldwide.html|title=Color subcarrier frequency and TV Standards/TV Systems|work=Publication dates 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 last updated 2005/12/15|publisher=Paradiso Design|accessdate=24 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn many countries, over-the-air [[broadcast television]] of [[analog audio]] and [[analog video]] signals has been discontinued, to allow the re-use of the television broadcast [[radio spectrum]] for other services such as [[datacasting]] and [[subchannel]]s.\n\n===Displaying an image===\nA [[cathode-ray tube]] (CRT) television displays an image by scanning a beam of [[electrons]] across the screen in a pattern of horizontal lines known as a [[raster scan|raster]]. At the end of each line the beam returns to the start of the next line; the end of the last line is a link that returns to the top of the screen. As it passes each point the intensity of the beam is varied, varying the [[luminance]] of that point. A [[color television]] system is identical except that an additional signal known as [[chrominance]] controls the color of the spot.\n\nRaster scanning is shown in a slightly simplified form below.\n\n[[File:Raster-scan.svg|center]]\n\nWhen analog television was developed, no affordable technology for storing any video signals existed; the luminance signal has to be generated and transmitted at the same time at which it is displayed on the CRT. It is therefore essential to keep the raster scanning in the camera (or other device for producing the signal) in exact [[synchronization]] with the scanning in the television.\n\nThe physics of the CRT require that a finite time interval be allowed for the spot to move back to the start of the next line (''horizontal retrace'') or the start of the screen (''vertical retrace''). The timing of the luminance signal must allow for this.\n\n[[File:TV screen close-up.jpg|thumb|right|Close up image of analog color screen]]\n\nThe human eye has a characteristic called [[Phi phenomenon]]. Quickly displaying successive scan images will allow the apparent [[illusion]] of smooth motion. Flickering of the image can be partially solved using a long persistence phosphor coating on the CRT, so that successive images fade slowly. However, slow phosphor has the negative side-effect of causing image smearing and blurring when there is a large amount of rapid on-screen motion occurring.\n\nThe maximum [[frame rate]] depends on the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the electronics and the transmission system, and the number of horizontal scan lines in the image. A frame rate of 25 or 30 [[hertz]] is a satisfactory compromise, while the process of [[interlacing]] two [[video field]]s of the picture per [[film frame|frame]] is used to build the image. This process doubles the apparent number of video frames per second and further reduces flicker and other defects in transmission.\n\n===Other types of display screens===\n[[Plasma display|Plasma screens]] and [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] screens have been used in analog [[television set]]s. These types of display screens use lower voltages than older CRT displays. Many dual system [[television receiver]]s, equipped to receive both [[analog transmission]]s and [[digital transmission]]s have analog [[tuner (television)|tuner]] receiving capability and must use a [[television antenna]].\n\n==Receiving signals==\nThe television system for each country will specify a number of television channels within the UHF or VHF frequency ranges. A channel actually consists of two signals: the picture information is transmitted using [[amplitude modulation]] on one frequency, and the sound is transmitted with [[frequency modulation]] at a frequency at a fixed offset (typically 4.5 to 6&nbsp;MHz) from the picture signal.\n\nThe channel frequencies chosen represent a compromise between allowing enough [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] for video (and hence satisfactory picture resolution), and allowing enough channels to be packed into the available frequency band. In practice a technique called [[vestigial sideband]] is used to reduce the channel spacing, which would be nearly twice the video bandwidth if pure AM was used.\n\nSignal reception is invariably done via a [[superheterodyne receiver]]: the first stage is a ''tuner'' which selects a television channel and frequency-shifts it to a fixed [[intermediate frequency]] (IF). The signal [[amplifier]] performs amplification to the IF stages from the microvolt range to fractions of a volt.\n\n===Extracting the sound===\nAt this point the IF signal consists of a video [[carrier signal]] at one frequency and the sound carrier at a fixed offset. A [[demodulator]] recovers the video signal. Also at the output of the same demodulator is a new frequency modulated sound carrier at the offset frequency. In some sets made before 1948, this was filtered out, and the sound IF of about 22&nbsp;MHz was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. In newer sets, this new carrier at the offset frequency was allowed to remain as ''intercarrier sound'', and it was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. One particular advantage of intercarrier sound is that when the front panel fine tuning knob is adjusted, the sound [[carrier frequency]] does not change with the tuning, but stays at the above-mentioned offset frequency. Consequently, it is easier to tune the picture without losing the sound.\n\nSo the FM sound carrier is then demodulated, amplified, and used to drive a loudspeaker. Until the advent of the [[NICAM]] and [[Multichannel television sound|MTS]] systems, television sound transmissions were invariably monophonic.\n\n===Structure of a video signal===\nThe video carrier is demodulated to give a [[composite video]] signal; this contains luminance, chrominance and synchronization signals;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tek.com/Measurement/App_Notes/25_7075/eng/25W_7075_3.pdf?wt=480&wtwi=2217&wtla=EN&wtty=TI&wtsty=Primer&wtpt=DETAILS&wtlit=25W-7075-3&wtcat=signal+generators&wtti=PAL+Video+Measurements|title=Pal systems&nbsp;\u2013 Television measurements|work=Publication date September 1999|publisher=Tektronics Incorporated|accessdate=25 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718081158/http://www.tek.com/Measurement/App_Notes/25_7075/eng/25W_7075_3.pdf?wt=480&wtwi=2217&wtla=EN&wtty=TI&wtsty=Primer&wtpt=DETAILS&wtlit=25W-7075-3&wtcat=signal+generators&wtti=PAL+Video+Measurements|archivedate=18 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> this is identical to the video signal format used by analog video devices such as [[VCRs]] or [[closed-circuit television|CCTV cameras]]. Note that the RF signal modulation is inverted compared to the conventional AM: the minimum video signal level corresponds to maximum carrier amplitude, and vice versa. To ensure good linearity (fidelity), consistent with affordable manufacturing costs of transmitters and receivers, the video carrier is never shut off altogether. When intercarrier sound was invented later in 1948, not completely shutting off the carrier had the side effect of allowing intercarrier sound to be economically implemented.\n\n[[File:Video-line.svg|center|alt=Diagram showing video signal amplitude against time.]]\n\nEach line of the displayed image is transmitted using a signal as shown above. The same basic format (with minor differences mainly related to timing and the encoding of color) is used for PAL, [[NTSC]] and SECAM television systems. A monochrome signal is identical to a color one, with the exception that the elements shown in color in the diagram (the color burst, and the chrominance signal) are not present.\n\n[[File:Videosignal porch.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Portion of a PAL video signal. From left to right: end of a video [[scan line]], front porch, horizontal [[sync pulse]], [[back porch]] with [[color burst]], and beginning of next line]]\nThe ''front porch'' is a brief (about 1.5 [[microsecond]]) period inserted between the end of each transmitted line of picture and the leading edge of the next line [[sync pulse]]. Its purpose was to allow [[voltage]] levels to stabilise in older televisions, preventing interference between picture lines. The ''front porch'' is the first component of the [[horizontal blanking interval]] which also contains the horizontal sync pulse and the ''back porch''.<ref name=\"tveng\" /><ref name=\"analogtv\" />\n\nThe ''back porch'' is the portion of each scan line between the end (rising edge) of the horizontal sync pulse and the start of active video. It is used to restore the black level (300 mV) reference in analog video. In signal processing terms, it compensates for the [[fall time]] and [[settling time]] following the sync pulse.<ref name=\"tveng\" /><ref name=\"analogtv\" />\n\nIn color television systems such as PAL and NTSC, this period also includes the [[colorburst]] signal. In the SECAM system it contains the reference subcarrier for each consecutive color difference signal in order to set the zero-color reference.\n\nIn some professional systems, particularly [[satellite link]]s between locations, the audio is embedded within the back porch of the video signal, to save the cost of renting a second channel.\n\n===Monochrome video signal extraction===\nThe luminance component of a composite video signal varies between 0&nbsp;V and approximately 0.7&nbsp;V above the \"black\" level. In the NTSC system, there is a ''blanking'' signal level used during the front porch and back porch, and a ''black'' signal level 75&nbsp;mV above it; in PAL and SECAM these are identical.\n\nIn a monochrome receiver the luminance signal is amplified to drive the [[control grid]] in the [[electron gun]] of the CRT. This changes the intensity of the electron beam and therefore the brightness of the spot being scanned. Brightness and contrast controls determine the DC shift and amplification, respectively.\n\n===Color video signal extraction===\n[[File:Burnt-in timecode.jpg|thumb|right|Color bar generator test signal]]\nA color signal conveys picture information for each of the red, green, and blue components of an image (see the article on [[color space]] for more information). However, these are not simply transmitted as three separate signals, because: such a signal would not be compatible with monochrome receivers (an important consideration when color broadcasting was first introduced). It would also occupy three times the bandwidth of existing television, requiring a decrease in the number of television channels available. Furthermore, typical problems with signal transmission (such as differing received signal levels between different colors) would produce unpleasant side effects.\n\nInstead, the RGB signals are converted into [[YUV]] form, where the Y signal represents the lightness and darkness (luminance) of the colors in the image. Because the rendering of colors in this way is the goal of both black and white (monochrome) film and black and white (monochrome) television systems, the Y signal is ideal for transmission as the luminance signal. This ensures a monochrome receiver will display a correct picture in black and white, where a given color is reproduced by a shade of gray that correctly reflects how light or dark the original color is.\n\nThe U and V signals are \"color difference\" signals. The U signal is the difference between the B signal and the Y signal, also known as B minus Y (B-Y), and the V signal is the difference between the R signal and the Y signal, also known as R minus Y (R-Y). The U signal then represents how \"purplish-blue\" or its complementary color \"yellowish-green\" the color is, and the V signal how \"purplish-red\" or its complementary \"greenish-cyan\" it is. The advantage of this scheme is that the U and V signals are zero when the picture has no color content. Since the human eye is more sensitive to errors in luminance than in color, the U and V signals can be transmitted in a relatively [[lossy compression|lossy]] (specifically: bandwidth-limited) way with acceptable results.\n\nIn the receiver, a single demodulator can extract an additive combination of U plus V. An example is the X demodulator used in the X/Z demodulation system. In that same system, a second demodulator, the Z demodulator, also extracts an additive combination of U plus V, but in a different ratio. The X and Z color difference signals are further matrixed into three color difference signals, (R-Y), (B-Y), and (G-Y). The combinations of usually two, but sometimes three demodulators were:\n\n{{ordered list\n| list-style-type=lower-alpha\n| (I) / (Q), (as used in the 1954 RCA CTC-2 and the 1985 RCA \"Colortrak\" series, and the 1954 Arvin, and some professional color monitors in the 1990s),\n| (R-Y) / (Q), as used in the 1955 RCA 21 inch color receiver,\n| (R-Y) / (B-Y), used in the first color receiver on the market (Westinghouse, not RCA),\n| (R-Y) / (G-Y), (as used in the RCA Victor CTC-4 chassis),\n| (R-Y) / (B-Y) / (G-Y),\n| (X) / (Z), as used in many receivers of the late '50s and throughout the '60s.\n}}\n\nIn the end, further matrixing of the above color-difference signals c through f yielded the three color-difference signals, (R-Y), (B-Y), and (G-Y).\n\nThe R,G,B signals in the receiver needed for the display device (CRT, Plasma display or LCD display) are electronically derived by matrixing as follows: R is the additive combination of (R-Y) with Y, G is the additive combination of (G-Y) with Y, and B is the additive combination of (B-Y) with Y. All of this is accomplished electronically. It can be seen that in the combining process, the low resolution portion of the Y signals cancel out, leaving R,G, and B signals able to render a low-resolution image in full color. However, the higher resolution portions of the Y signals do not cancel out, and so are equally present in R, G, and B, producing the higher definition (higher resolution) image detail in monochrome, although it appears to the human eye as a full-color and full resolution picture.\n\n[[File:Waveform monitor.jpg|thumb|left|Color signals mixed with video signal (two horizontal lines in sequence)]]\n\nIn the NTSC and PAL color systems, U and V are transmitted by using [[quadrature amplitude modulation]] of a subcarrier. This kind of modulation applies two independent signals to one subcarrier, with the idea that both signals will be recovered independently at the receive end. Before transmission, the subcarrier itself, is removed from the active (visible) portion of the video, and moved, in the form of a burst, to the horizontal blanking portion, which is not directly visible on screen. (More about the burst below.)\n\nFor NTSC, the subcarrier is a 3.58&nbsp;MHz sine wave. For the PAL system it is a 4.43&nbsp;MHz sine wave. After the above-mentioned quadrature amplitude modulation of the subcarrier, subcarrier sidebands are produced, and the subcarrier itself is filtered out of the visible portion of the video, since it is the subcarrier sidebands that carry all of the U and V information, and the subcarrier itself carries no information.\n\nThe resulting subcarrier sidebands is also known as \"chroma\" or \"chrominance\". Physically, this chrominance signal is a 3.58&nbsp;MHz(NTSC) or 4.43&nbsp;MHz(PAL) sine wave which, in response to changing U and V values, changes phase as compared to the subcarrier, and also changes amplitude.\n\nAs it turns out, the chroma amplitude (when considered together with the Y signal) represents the approximate saturation of a color, and the chroma phase against the subcarrier as reference, approximately represents the hue of the color. For particular test colors found in the test color bar pattern, exact amplitudes and phases are sometimes defined for test and trouble shooting purposes only.\n\nAlthough, in response to changing U and V values, the chroma sinewave changes phase with respect to the subcarrier, it's not correct to say that the subcarrier is simply \"phase modulated\". That is because a single sine wave U test signal with QAM produces only one pair of sidebands, whereas real phase modulation under the same test conditions would produce multiple sets of sidebands occupying more frequency spectrum.\n\nIn NTSC, the chrominance sine wave has the same average frequency as the subcarrier frequency. But a spectrum analyzer instrument shows that, for transmitted chrominance, the frequency component at the subcarrier frequency is actually zero energy, verifying that the subcarrier was indeed removed before transmission.\n\nThese sideband frequencies are within the luminance signal band, which is why they are called \"subcarrier\" sidebands instead of simply \"carrier\" sidebands. Their exact frequencies were chosen such that (for NTSC), they are midway between two harmonics of the frame repetition rate, thus ensuring that the majority of the power of the luminance signal does not overlap with the power of the chrominance signal.\n\nIn the British PAL (D) system, the actual chrominance center frequency, with equal lower and upper sidebands, is 4.43361875&nbsp;MHz, a direct multiple of the scan rate frequency. This frequency was chosen to minimize the chrominance beat interference pattern that would be visible in areas of high color saturation in the transmitted picture.\n\nAt certain times, the chrominance signal represents only the U signal, and 70 nanoseconds (NTSC) later, the chrominance signal represents only the V signal. (This is the nature of the quadrature amplitude modulation process that created the chrominance signal.) About 70 nanoseconds later still, -U, and another 70 nanoseconds, -V.\n\nSo to extract U, a synchronous demodulator is utilized, which uses the subcarrier to briefly gate (sample) the chroma every 280 nanoseconds, so that the output is only a train of discrete pulses, each having an amplitude that is the same as the original U signal at the corresponding time. In effect, these pulses are discrete-time analog samples of the U signal. The pulses are then low-pass filtered so that the original analog continuous-time U signal is recovered. For V, a 90 degree shifted subcarrier briefly gates the chroma signal every 280 nanoseconds, and the rest of the process is identical to that used for the U signal.\n\nGating at any other time than those times mentioned above will yield an additive mixture of any two of U, V, -U, or -V. One of these \"off-axis\" (that is, off the U and V axis) gating methods is called I/Q demodulation. Another much more popular \"off-axis\" scheme was the X/Z demodulation system. Further matrixing recovered the original U and V signals. This scheme was actually the most popular demodulator scheme throughout the 60's.\n\nThe above process uses the subcarrier. But as previously mentioned, it was deleted before transmission, and only the chroma is transmitted. Therefore, the receiver must reconstitute the subcarrier. For this purpose, a short burst of subcarrier, known as the color burst, is transmitted during the back porch (re-trace blanking period) of each scan line. A subcarrier oscillator in the receiver locks onto this signal (see phase-locked loop) to achieve a phase reference, resulting in the oscillator producing the reconstituted subcarrier.\n\n(A second use of the burst in more expensive or newer receiver models is a reference to an AGC system to compensate for chroma gain imperfections in reception.)\n[[File:Hanoverbars without PAL delay.png|thumb|right|[[Test card]] showing \"[[Hanover bars]]\" (color banding phase effect) in Pal S (simple) signal mode of transmission.]]\n\nNTSC uses this process unmodified. Unfortunately, this often results in poor color reproduction due to phase errors in the received signal, caused sometimes by multipath, but mostly by poor implementation at the studio end. With the advent of solid state receivers, cable TV, and digital studio equipment for conversion to an over-the-air analog signal, these NTSC problems have been largely fixed, leaving operator error at the studio end as the sole color rendition weakness of the NTSC system. In any case, the PAL D (delay) system mostly corrects these kind of errors by reversing the phase of the signal on each successive line, and the averaging the results over pairs of lines. This process is achieved by the use of a 1H (where H = horizontal scan frequency) duration delay line. (A typical circuit used with this device converts the low frequency color signal to [[ultrasound]] and back again). Phase shift errors between successive lines are therefore cancelled out and the wanted signal amplitude is increased when the two in-phase ([[coincident]]) signals are re-combined.\n\nNTSC is more spectrum efficient than PAL, giving more picture detail for a given bandwidth. This is because sophisticated comb filters in receivers are more effective with NTSC's 4 field color phase cadence compared to PAL's 8 field cadence. However, in the end, the larger channel width of most PAL systems in Europe still give their PAL systems the edge in transmitting more picture detail.\n\nIn the [[SECAM]] television system, U and V are transmitted on ''alternate'' lines, using simple [[frequency modulation]] of two different color subcarriers.\n\nIn some analog color CRT displays, starting in 1956, the brightness control signal ([[luminance]]) is fed to the [[cathode]] connections of the electron guns, and the color difference signals ([[chrominance]] signals) are fed to the control grids connections. This simple CRT matrix mixing technique was replaced in later [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] designs of signal processing with the original matrixing method used in the 1954 and 1955 color TV receivers.\n\n==Synchronization==\nSynchronizing pulses added to the video signal at the end of every [[scan line]] and video frame ensure that the sweep oscillators in the receiver remain locked in step with the transmitted signal, so that the image can be reconstructed on the receiver screen.<ref name=\"tveng\">\n {{cite book\n | last = Gupta\n | first = R.

(see section below&nbsp;\u2013 Other technical information, for extra detail.)\n\n===Horizontal synchronization===\nThe horizontal synchronization pulse (''horizontal sync'', or ''HSync''), separates the [[scan line]]s. The horizontal sync signal is a single short pulse which indicates the start of every line. The rest of the scan line follows, with the signal ranging from 0.3&nbsp;V (black) to 1&nbsp;V (white), until the next horizontal or [[#Vertical_synchronization|vertical synchronization pulse]].\n\nThe format of the horizontal sync pulse varies. In the 525-line [[NTSC]] system it is a 4.85&nbsp;[[microsecond|\u00b5s]]-long pulse at 0&nbsp;[[volt|V]]. In the 625-line [[PAL]] system the pulse is 4.7&nbsp;\u00b5s synchronization pulse at 0&nbsp;[[volt|V]] . This is lower than the amplitude of any video signal (''blacker than black'') so it can be detected by the level-sensitive \"sync stripper\" circuit of the receiver.\n\n===Vertical synchronization===\n{{For|the graphic option provided by video games|Frame rate|Refresh rate}}\nVertical synchronization (also called vertical sync or VSync) separates the video fields. In PAL and NTSC, the vertical sync pulse occurs within the [[vertical blanking interval]]. The vertical sync pulses are made by prolonging the length of HSYNC pulses through almost the entire length of the scan line.\n\nThe ''vertical sync'' signal is a series of much longer pulses, indicating the start of a new field. The sync pulses occupy the whole of line interval of a number of lines at the beginning and end of a scan; no picture information is transmitted during vertical retrace. The pulse sequence is designed to allow horizontal sync to continue during vertical retrace; it also indicates whether each field represents even or odd lines in interlaced systems (depending on whether it begins at the start of a horizontal line, or midway through).\n\nThe format of such a signal in 525-line [[NTSC]] is:\n* pre-equalizing pulses (6 to start scanning odd lines, 5 to start scanning even lines)\n* long-sync pulses (5 pulses)\n* post-equalizing pulses (5 to start scanning odd lines, 4 to start scanning even lines)\n\nEach pre- or post- equalizing pulse consists in half a [[scan line]] of black signal: 2&nbsp;\u00b5s at 0&nbsp;V, followed by 30&nbsp;\u00b5s at 0.3&nbsp;V.\n\nEach long sync pulse consists in an equalizing pulse with timings inverted: 30&nbsp;\u00b5s at 0&nbsp;V, followed by 2&nbsp;\u00b5s at 0.3&nbsp;V.\n\nIn video production and computer graphics, changes to the image are often kept in step with the vertical synchronization pulse to avoid visible discontinuity of the image. Since the [[frame buffer]] of a [[computer graphics]] display imitates the dynamics of a cathode-ray display, if it is updated with a new image while the image is being transmitted to the display, the display shows a mishmash of both frames, producing a [[page tearing]] [[digital artifact|artifact]] partway down the image.\n\nVertical synchronization eliminates this by timing frame buffer fills to coincide with the [[vertical blanking interval]], thus ensuring that only whole frames are seen on-screen. Software such as video games and [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) packages often allow vertical synchronization as an option, because it delays the image update until the vertical blanking interval. This produces a small penalty in latency, because the program has to wait until the video controller has finished transmitting the image to the display before continuing. [[Triple buffering]] reduces this latency significantly.\n\nTwo timing intervals are defined&nbsp;\u2013 the ''front porch'' between the end of displayed video and the start of the sync pulse, and the ''back porch'' after the sync pulse and before displayed video. These and the sync pulse itself are called the ''horizontal blanking'' (or ''retrace'') ''interval'' and represent the time that the electron beam in the CRT is returning to the start of the next display line.\n\n===Horizontal hold and vertical hold===\nThe lack of precision timing components in early television receivers meant that the timebase circuits occasionally needed manual adjustment.\nIf their free-run frequencies were too far from the actual line and field rates, the circuits would not be able to follow the incoming sync signals.\nLoss of horizontal synchronization usually resulted in an unwatchable picture; loss of vertical synchronization would produce an image rolling up or down the screen.\n\nThe adjustment took the form of ''horizontal hold'' and ''vertical hold'' controls, usually on the front panel along with other common controls. These adjusted the free-run frequencies of the corresponding timebase oscillators.\n\nBy the early 1980s the efficacy of the synchronization circuits, plus the inherent stability of the sets' oscillators, had been improved to the point where these controls were no longer necessary.\n\n==Other technical information==\n{{Further information|Broadcast engineering}}\n{{Further information|Electronic engineering}}\n\n===Components of a television system===\nA typical analog monochrome [[television receiver]] is based around the block diagram shown below:\n\n[[File:TV-block-diagram.svg|center|alt=block diagram of a television receiver showing tuner, intermediate frequency amplifier. A demodulator separates sound from video. Video is directed to the CRT and to the synchronizing circuits.]]\n\n===Sync separator===\n\n[[File:Videosignal porch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Portion of a [[PAL]] videosignal.

The ''horizontal sync'' signal is a single short pulse which indicates the start of every line. Two timing intervals are defined&nbsp;\u2013 the ''front porch'' between the end of displayed video and the start of the sync pulse, and the ''back porch'' after the sync pulse and before displayed video. These and the sync pulse itself are called the ''horizontal blanking'' (or ''retrace'') ''interval'' and represent the time that the electron beam in the CRT is returning to the start of the next display line.\n\nThe ''vertical sync'' signal is a series of much longer pulses, indicating the start of a new field. The sync pulses occupy the whole of line interval of a number of lines at the beginning and end of a scan; no picture information is transmitted during vertical retrace. The pulse sequence is designed to allow horizontal sync to continue during vertical retrace; it also indicates whether each field represents even or odd lines in interlaced systems (depending on whether it begins at the start of a horizontal line, or midway through).\n\nIn the television receiver, a ''sync separator'' circuit detects the sync voltage levels and sorts the pulses into horizontal and vertical sync.\n\nLoss of horizontal synchronization usually resulted in an unwatchable picture; loss of vertical synchronization would produce an image rolling up or down the screen.\n\nCounting sync pulses, a [[video line selector]] picks a selected line from a TV signal, used for [[teletext]], [[on-screen display]]s, [[station identification]] logos as well as in the industry when cameras were used as a sensor.\n\n===Timebase circuits===\n{{Further information|Oscilloscope}}\nIn an analog receiver with a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] display sync pulses are fed to horizontal and vertical ''timebase'' circuits (commonly called \"sweep circuits\" in the United States), each consisting of an oscillator and an amplifier. These generate modified [[sawtooth wave|sawtooth]] and [[parabola]] current waveforms to scan the electron beam in a [[linear]] way. The waveform shapes are necessary to make up for the distance variations from the electron beam source and the screen surface. The oscillators are designed to free-run at frequencies very close to the field and line rates, but the sync pulses cause them to reset at the beginning of each scan line or field, resulting in the necessary synchronization of the beam sweep with the originating signal. The output waveforms from the timebase amplifiers are fed to the horizontal and vertical ''deflection coils'' wrapped around the CRT tube. These coils produce [[magnetic field]]s proportional to the changing current, and these deflect the electron beam across the screen.\n\nIn the 1950s, the power for these circuits was derived directly from the mains supply.\nA simple circuit consisted of a [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] voltage dropper [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and a [[rectifier]] [[valve]] ([[Vacuum tube|tube]]) or [[semiconductor]] [[diode]]. This avoided the cost of a large high voltage mains supply (50 or 60&nbsp;Hz) [[transformer]]. This type of circuit was used for thermionic valve ([[vacuum tube]]) technology. It was inefficient and produced a lot of heat which led to premature failures in the circuitry.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[semiconductor]] technology was introduced into timebase circuits.

However, the [[anode]] connection for a [[cathode-ray tube]] requires a very high voltage (typically 10\u201330&nbsp;kV) for correct operation.\n\nThis voltage is not directly produced by the main [[power supply]] circuitry; instead the receiver makes use of the circuitry used for horizontal scanning. [[Direct current]] (DC), is switched though the line output transformer, and [[alternating current]] (AC) is induced into the scan coils. At the end of each horizontal scan line the [[magnetic field]], which has built up in both transformer and scan coils by the current, is a source of latent electromagnetic energy. This stored collapsing magnetic field energy can be captured. The reverse flow, short duration, (about 10% of the line scan time) current from both the line output transformer and the horizontal scan coil is discharged again into the [[transformer|primary winding]] of the [[flyback transformer]] by the use of a rectifier which blocks this negative reverse [[electromotive force|emf]]. A small value [[capacitor]] is connected across the scan switching device. This tunes the circuit [[inductance]]s to [[resonate]] at a much higher [[frequency]]. This slows down (lengthens) the flyback time from the extremely rapid decay rate that would result if they were electrically isolated during this short period. One of the secondary windings on the flyback transformer then feeds this brief high voltage pulse to a [[Cockcroft\u2013Walton generator]] design [[voltage multiplier]]. This produces the required [[extra high tension|EHT]] supply. A [[flyback converter]] is a power supply circuit operating on similar principles.\n\nA typical modern design incorporates the flyback transformer and rectifier circuitry into a single unit with a captive output lead, (known as a diode split line output transformer or an Integrated High Voltage Transformer (IHVT)),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miniwatt.info/mullard_tn77.pdf|title=Technical note 77&nbsp;\u2013 Diode Split for E.H.T. generation|work=Publication date&nbsp;\u2013 1976|publisher=Mullard|accessdate=24 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721224854/http://www.miniwatt.info/mullard_tn77.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> so that all high-voltage parts are enclosed. Earlier designs used a separate line output transformer and a well insulated high voltage multiplier unit. The high frequency (15&nbsp;kHz or so) of the horizontal scanning allows reasonably small components to be used.\n\n==Transition to digital==\n{{main article|Digital television transition|Digital television}}\n\nThe first country to make a wholesale [[digital television transition|switch]] to digital over-the-air (terrestrial television) broadcasting was Luxembourg in 2006, followed later in 2006 by the Netherlands; in 2007 by Finland, Andorra, Sweden and Switzerland; in 2008 by Belgium (Flanders) and Germany; in 2009 by the United States (high power stations), southern Canada, the Isle of Man, Norway, and Denmark. In 2010, Belgium (Wallonia), Spain, Wales, Latvia, Estonia, the Channel Islands, San Marino, Croatia and Slovenia; in 2011 Israel, Austria, Monaco, Cyprus, Japan (excluding [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]], [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]], and [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]] prefectures), Malta and France; in 2012 the Czech Republic, Arab World, Taiwan, Portugal, Japan (including Miyagi, Iwate, and Fukushima prefectures), Serbia, Italy, Canada, Mauritius, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Lithuania, Slovakia, Gibraltar, and South Korea; in 2013, the Republic of Macedonia, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Australia, and New Zealand, completed the transition. The United Kingdom made the transition to digital television between 2008 and 2012, with the exception of [[Barrow-in-Furness]], which made the switch over in 2007. The first digital TV-only area in the United Kingdom was Ferryside in [[Carmarthenshire]].\n\nThe [[Digital television transition in the United States]] for high-powered transmission was completed on 12 June 2009, the date that the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) set.  Almost two million households could no longer watch television because they had not prepared for the transition.  The switchover had been delayed by the [[DTV Delay Act]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Stephanie Condon\n |title=Senate OKs delay of digital television transition\n |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10150551-38.html\n |date=26 January 2009 |publisher=[[CNET News]]\n |accessdate=14 June 2009 |deadurl=no\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025003610/http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10150551-38.html |archivedate=25 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  While the majority of the viewers of over-the-air broadcast television in the U.S. watch full-power stations (which number about 1800), there are three other categories of television stations in the U.S.: [[low-power broadcasting]] stations, [[Class A television service|class A stations]], and [[broadcast relay station|television translator stations]]. Class A low-power stations were required to convert to digital by 21 September 2015 and all others were required to convert to digital before 13 July 2021. In broadcasting, whatever happens in the United States also influences southern Canada and northern Mexico because those areas are covered by television stations in the U.S.\n\nIn Japan, the switch to digital began in northeastern [[Ishikawa Prefecture]] on 24 July 2010 and ended in 43 of the country's 47 prefectures (including the rest of Ishikawa) on 24 July 2011, but in [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]], [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]], and [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]] prefectures, the conversion was delayed to 31 March 2012, due to complications from the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]] and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|its related nuclear accidents]]. \n\nIn Canada, most of the larger cities turned off analog broadcasts on 31 August 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/info_sht/bdt14.htm\n |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=no\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411170737/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/ENG/INFO_SHT/BDT14.HTM\n |archivedate=11 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> \n\nChina is scheduled to end analog broadcasting between 2015 and 2018, due to the large size of the country.\n\nBrazil switched to digital television on 2 December 2007 in its major cities. It is now estimated that Brazil will end analog broadcasting in 2023.\n\nIn Malaysia, the Malaysian Communications & Multimedia Commission (MCMC) advertised for tender bids to be submitted in the third quarter of 2009 for the 470 through 742&nbsp;MHz [[UHF]] allocation, to enable Malaysia's broadcast system to move into DTV. The new [[broadcast band]] allocation would result in Malaysia's having to build an infrastructure for all broadcasters, using a single [[Digital terrestrial television|digital terrestrial transmission]]/television broadcast (DTTB) channel.{{fact|date=November 2017}} Large portions of Malaysia are covered by television broadcasts from Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, and Indonesia (from Borneo and Batam).\n\nIn Singapore, digital television under DVB-T2 began on 16 December 2013. The switchover has been delayed many times until 31 December 2018.\n\nIn the Philippines, the [[National Telecommunications Commission]] required all broadcasting companies to end analog broadcasting on December 31, 2015 at 11:59&nbsp;p.m. Due to delay of the release of the implementing rules and regulations for digital television broadcast, the target date was moved to 2020. Full digital broadcast is expected in 2021.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Television}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Amateur television]]\n* [[Color burst]]\n* [[Narrow-bandwidth television]]\n* [[Overscan]]\n* [[Slow-scan television]]\n* [[Terrestrial television]]\n* [[Television transmitter]]\n* [[Vertical blanking interval]]\n* [[Field (video)]]\n* [[Video frame]]\n* [[Glossary of video terms]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|analog}}\n*[http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/tut/p/id/4750 Video signal measurement and generation]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100326081108/http://freespace.virgin.net/ljmayes.mal/var/tvsync.htm Television synchronisation]\n*[http://www.hometechanswers.com/video/standards.html Video broadcast standard frequencies and country listings]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060716111817/http://www.edn.com/article/CA6335297.html EDN magazine describing design of a 1958 transistorised television receiver]\n*[https://archive.is/20140923181048/http://www.productstat.com/engineering/18-6-story-color-television Designing the color television signal in the early 1950s as described by two engineers working directly with the NTSC]\n\n{{Wireless video}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Analog Television}}\n[[Category:Film and video technology]]\n[[Category:History of television]]\n[[Category:Television technology]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]", "sha1": "0ilijrhn1i8he2q1noycbupfl2xg46a"}}, {"title": "April 11", "ns": "0", "id": "2395", "revision": {"id": "866222815", "parentid": "861761900", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T01:54:54Z", "contributor": {"ip": "180.191.159.74"}, "comment": "/* Births */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{pp-pc1}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{calendar}}\n{{This date in recent years}}\n{{Day}}\n\n==Events==\n* [[491]] &ndash; Flavius Anastasius becomes [[Byzantine emperor]], with the name of [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]].\n*[[1034]] &ndash; Emperor [[Romanos III Argyros]] is drowned in his bath on Empress [[Zo\u00eb Porphyrogenita|Zo\u00eb]] orders.\n*[[1079]] &ndash; [[Bishop]] [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w|Stanislaus of Krak\u00f3w]] is executed by order of [[Boles\u0142aw II the Generous|Boles\u0142aw II of Poland]].\n*[[1241]] &ndash; [[Batu Khan]] defeats [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]] at the [[Battle of Mohi]].\n*[[1512]] &ndash; [[War of the League of Cambrai]]: French forces led by [[Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours|Gaston de Foix]] win the [[Battle of Ravenna (1512)|Battle of Ravenna]].\n*[[1544]] &ndash; [[Italian War of 1542\u201346]]: A French army defeats [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] forces at the [[Battle of Ceresole]], but fails to exploit its victory.\n*[[1689]] &ndash; [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] are crowned as joint sovereigns of Great Britain.\n*[[1713]] &ndash; [[War of the Spanish Succession]] ([[Queen Anne's War]]): [[Treaty of Utrecht]].\n*[[1727]] &ndash; Premiere of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s [[St Matthew Passion]] BWV 244b at the [[St. Thomas Church, Leipzig]]\n*[[1809]] &ndash; An incomplete British victory over the French fleet at the [[Battle of the Basque Roads]] results in the [[court-martial of James, Lord Gambier]].\n*[[1814]] &ndash; The [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] ends the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] against [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], and forces him to abdicate unconditionally for the first time.\n*[[1856]] &ndash; [[Second Battle of Rivas]]: [[Juan Santamar\u00eda]] burns down the hostel where [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]'s [[filibuster (military)|filibusters]] are holed up.\n*[[1868]] &ndash; Former ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] surrenders [[Edo Castle]] to Imperial forces, marking the end of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].\n*[[1876]] &ndash; The [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]] is organized.\n*[[1881]] &ndash; [[Spelman College]] is founded in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] as the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary, an institute of higher education for African-American women.\n*[[1908]] &ndash; {{SMS|Bl\u00fccher}}, the last [[armored cruiser]] to be built by the [[Imperial German Navy]], launches.\n*[[1909]] &ndash; The city of [[Tel Aviv]] is founded.\n*[[1921]] &ndash; [[Emir]] [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]] establishes the first centralised government in the newly created [[British protectorate]] of [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]].\n*[[1945]] &ndash; [[World War II]]: American forces liberate the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]].\n*[[1951]] &ndash; [[Korean War]]: President [[Harry Truman]] [[President Truman's relief of General Douglas MacArthur|relieves]] [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] of overall command in Korea.\n* 1951  &ndash; The [[Stone of Scone]], the stone upon which Scottish monarchs were traditionally crowned, is found on the site of the altar of [[Arbroath Abbey]].

These are then organized into reactive and non-reactive adhesives, which refers to whether the adhesive [[chemical reaction|chemically reacts]] in order to harden. Alternatively they can be organized by whether the raw stock is of natural, or synthetic origin, or by their starting [[phase (matter)|physical phase]].\n\n=== By reactiveness ===\n\n====Non-reactive====\n\n=====Drying=====\nThere are two types of adhesives that harden by drying: ''solvent-based adhesives'' and ''polymer dispersion adhesives'', also known as ''emulsion adhesives''. \nSolvent-based adhesives are a mixture of ingredients (typically [[polymer]]s) dissolved in a [[solvent]]. White glue, contact adhesives and [[rubber cement]]s are members of the ''drying adhesive'' family. As the solvent evaporates, the adhesive hardens. Depending on the chemical composition of the adhesive, they will adhere to different materials to greater or lesser degrees.\n\nPolymer dispersion adhesives are milky-white dispersions often based on [[polyvinyl acetate]] (PVAc). They are used extensively in the woodworking and packaging industries. They are also used with fabrics and fabric-based components, and in engineered products such as loudspeaker cones.\n\n=====Pressure-sensitive=====\n{{Main|Pressure-sensitive adhesive}}\n''Pressure-sensitive adhesives'' (PSA) form a bond by the application of light pressure to marry the adhesive with the adherend.  They are designed to have a balance between flow and resistance to flow.  The bond forms because the adhesive is soft enough to flow (i.e., \"wet\") to the adherend.  The bond has strength because the adhesive is hard enough to resist flow when stress is applied to the bond.  Once the adhesive and the adherend are in close proximity, molecular interactions, such as [[van der Waals force]]s, become involved in the bond, contributing significantly to its ultimate strength.\n\nPSAs are designed for either permanent or removable applications.  Examples of permanent applications include safety labels for power equipment, foil tape for [[HVAC]] duct work, automotive interior trim assembly, and sound/vibration damping films. Some high performance permanent PSAs exhibit high adhesion values and can support kilograms of weight per square centimeter of contact area, even at elevated temperatures. Permanent PSAs may initially be removable (for example to recover mislabeled goods) and build adhesion to a permanent bond after several hours or days.\n\nRemovable adhesives are designed to form a temporary bond, and ideally can be removed after months or years without leaving residue on the adherend.  Removable adhesives are used in applications such as surface protection films, [[Masking_tape|masking tapes]], bookmark and note papers, barcodes labels, price marking labels, promotional graphics materials, and for skin contact (wound care dressings, EKG electrodes, athletic tape, analgesic and transdermal drug patches, etc.).  Some removable adhesives are designed to repeatedly stick and unstick.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Barcode|first1=Barry|title=Rubber Acrylic Adhesive Labels|url=http://www.midcomdata.com/rubber-acrylic-adhesive-labels/|website=Midcomdata|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> They have low adhesion, and generally cannot support much weight. [[Pressure-sensitive adhesive]] is used in [[Post-it note]]s.\n\nPressure-sensitive adhesives are manufactured with either a liquid carrier or in 100% solid form.  Articles are made from liquid PSAs by coating the adhesive and drying off the solvent or water carrier.  They may be further heated to initiate a [[cross-link]]ing reaction and increase [[molecular mass|molecular weight]].  100% solid PSAs may be low viscosity polymers that are coated and then reacted with radiation to increase molecular weight and form the adhesive, or they may be high viscosity materials that are heated to reduce viscosity enough to allow coating, and then cooled to their final form. Major raw material for PSA's are [[acrylate]]-based polymers.\n\n=====Contact {{anchor|Contact adhesives}}=====\n''Contact adhesives'' are used in strong bonds with high shear-resistance like [[laminate]]s, such as bonding [[Formica (plastic)|Formica]] to a wooden counter, and in [[footwear]], as in attaching outsoles to uppers.  [[Natural rubber]] and [[polychloroprene]] (Neoprene) are commonly used contact adhesives.  Both of these elastomers undergo [[strain crystallization]].\n\nContact adhesives must be applied to both surfaces and allowed some time to dry before the two surfaces are pushed together. Some contact adhesives require as long as 24 hours to dry before the surfaces are to be held together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thistothat.com/glue/contact.shtml|title=Contact Adhesives|website=www.thistothat.com}}</ref> Once the surfaces are pushed together, the bond forms very quickly.<ref>[http://composite.about.com/library/glossary/c/bldef-c1257.htm Definition of ''contact adhesive'' on About.com]</ref> It is usually not necessary to apply pressure for a long time, so there is less need for [[Clamp (tool)|clamps]].\n\n=====Hot=====\n[[File:Stanley-Hot-Glue-Gun-GR35K.jpg|right|thumbnail|A glue gun, an example of a hot adhesive]]\n{{Main|Hot-melt adhesive}}\n\n''Hot adhesives'', also known as ''hot melt adhesives'', are [[thermoplastic]]s applied in molten form (in the 65\u2013180&nbsp;\u00b0C range) which solidify on cooling to form strong bonds between a wide range of materials. [[Ethylene-vinyl acetate]]-based hot-melts are particularly popular for crafts because of their ease of use and the wide range of common materials they can join. A glue gun (shown at right) is one method of applying hot adhesives. The glue gun melts the solid adhesive, then allows the liquid to pass through its barrel onto the material, where it solidifies.\n\nThermoplastic glue may have been invented around 1940 by [[Procter & Gamble]] as a solution to the problem that water-based adhesives, commonly used in packaging at that time, failed in humid climates, causing packages to open.\n\n====Reactive====\n=====Anaerobic=====\nAnaerobic adhesives cure when in contact with metal, in the absence of oxygen.<ref>{{cite web |title=About anaerobic adhesives |publisher=ThreeBond Holdings Co. |url=https://www.threebond.co.jp/en/technical/seminar/adhesion2.html |accessdate=September 15, 2018}}</ref>  They work well in a close-fitting space, as when used as a [[Thread-locking fluid]].\n\n=====Multi-part=====\n''Multi-component adhesives'' harden by mixing two or more components which chemically react. This reaction causes polymers to cross-link<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Y2ykcUBWZsC&pg=PA83&dq=Multi-component+adhesives+harden+by+mixing+two+or+more+components+which+chemically+react&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0oo2pztTUAhVF1mMKHeMBAzAQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=Multi-component%20adhesives%20harden%20by%20mixing%20two%20or%20more%20components%20which%20chemically%20react&f=false|title=Plastics: in Architecture and Construction|last=Engelsmann|first=Stephan|last2=Spalding|first2=Valerie|last3=Peters|first3=Stefan|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783034611947|language=en}}</ref> into acrylics, urethanes, and epoxies - See [[thermosetting polymers]].\n\nThere are several commercial combinations of multi-component adhesives in use in industry. Some of these combinations are:\n* Polyester resin \u2013 polyurethane resin\n* Polyols \u2013 polyurethane resin\n* Acrylic polymers \u2013 polyurethane resins\n\nThe individual components of a multi-component adhesive are not adhesive by nature. The individual components react with each other after being mixed and show full adhesion only on curing. The multi-component resins can be either solvent-based or solvent-less. The solvents present in the adhesives are a medium for the polyester or the polyurethane resin. The solvent is dried during the curing process.\n\n=====Pre-mixed and frozen adhesives=====\n''Pre-mixed and frozen adhesives'' (PMFs) are adhesives that are mixed, deaerated, packaged, and frozen.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Polymeric_Thermosetting_Compounds.html?id=XiRdDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=snippet&q=frozen&f=false|title=Polymeric Thermosetting Compounds|publisher=Apple Academic Press|author=Ralph D.

Light curing adhesives can cure in as little as one second and many formulations can bond dissimilar substrates (materials) and withstand harsh temperatures. These qualities make [[UV curing]] adhesives essential to the manufacturing of items in many industrial markets such as electronics, telecommunications, medical, aerospace, glass, and optical. Unlike traditional adhesives, UV light curing adhesives not only bond materials together but they can also be used to seal and coat products.  They are generally acrylic-based.\n\n''Heat curing adhesives'' consist of a pre-made mixture of two or more components.  When heat is applied the components react and cross-link. This type of adhesive includes [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]] [[epoxy|epoxies]], [[polyurethane|urethanes]], and [[polyimide]]s.\n\n''Moisture curing adhesives'' cure when they react with moisture present on the substrate surface or in the air. This type of adhesive includes [[cyanoacrylates]] and [[polyurethane|urethanes]].\n{{See also|List of polyurethane applications#Adhesives}}\n\n===By origin===\n\n====Natural====\nNatural adhesives are made from organic sources such as vegetable [[starch]] ([[dextrin]]), natural resins, or animals (e.g. the milk protein [[casein]]<ref name=\"cornell\">[http://www.ccmr.cornell.edu/education/ask/index.html?quid=160 CCMR \u2013 Ask A Scientist!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928023201/http://www.ccmr.cornell.edu/education/ask/index.html?quid=160 |date=2011-09-28 }}</ref> and hide-based [[animal glue]]s). These are often referred to as [[bioadhesives]].\n\nOne example is a simple paste made by cooking flour in water. Starch-based adhesives are used in [[corrugated board]] and [[paper bag|paper sack]] production, paper tube winding, and [[wallpaper adhesive]]s. Casein glue is mainly used to adhere glass bottle labels. Animal glues have traditionally been used in bookbinding, wood joining, and many other areas but now are largely replaced by synthetic glues except in specialist applications like the production and repair of stringed instruments. [[Albumen]] made from the protein component of blood has been used in the [[plywood]] industry. [[Masonite]], a wood hardboard, was originally bonded using natural wood [[lignin]], an [[organic polymer]], though most modern particle boards such as [[Medium-density fiberboard|MDF]] use synthetic thermosetting resins.\n\n====Synthetic====\nSynthetic adhesives are based on [[elastomer]]s, [[thermoplastics]], [[emulsion]]s, and [[Thermosetting plastic|thermosets]]. Examples of thermosetting adhesives are: [[epoxy]], [[polyurethane]], [[cyanoacrylate]] and [[Acrylic resin|acrylic]] polymers. The first commercially produced synthetic adhesive was [[Karlsons Klister]] in the 1920s.<ref>[http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/innovation/article3208149.ece Ny Teknik: Sverige fastnade tack vare \u00e5snan]</ref>\n\n==Application==\nApplicators of different adhesives are designed according to the adhesive being used and the size of the area to which the adhesive will be applied. The adhesive is applied to either one or both of the materials being bonded.  The pieces are aligned and pressure is added to aid in adhesion and rid the bond of air bubbles.\n\nCommon ways of applying an adhesive include brushes, rollers, using films or pellets, spray guns and applicator guns (''e.g.'', [[caulk gun]]). All of these can be used manually or automated as part of a machine.\n\n==Mechanisms of adhesion==\n{{Main|Adhesion}}\n\nFor an adhesive to be effective it must have three main properties.  It must be able to wet the substrate. It must increase in strength after application, and finally it must be able to transmit load between the two surfaces/substrates being adhered.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=J. E.|title=The New Science of Strong materials (or why you don't fall through the floor)|date=1991|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0140135979|page=155|edition=2nd rev.}}</ref>\n\nAdhesion, the attachment between adhesive and substrate may occur either by mechanical means, in which the adhesive works its way into small pores of the substrate, or by one of several chemical mechanisms. The strength of adhesion depends on many factors, including the means by which it occurs.\n\nIn some cases, an actual [[chemical bond]] occurs between adhesive and substrate. In others, electrostatic forces, as in static electricity, hold the substances together. A third mechanism involves the [[van der Waals forces]] that develop between molecules. A fourth means involves the moisture-aided diffusion of the glue into the substrate, followed by hardening.\n\n== Methods to improve adhesion ==\nThe quality of adhesive bonding depends strongly on the ability of the adhesive to efficiency cover (wet) the substrate area. This happens when the [[surface energy]] of the substrate is greater than the surface energy of the adhesive. However, high strength adhesives have high surface energy. Thus, their application is problematic for low energy materials such as [[polymer]]s. To solve this problem, surface treatment can be used to increase the surface energy as a preparation step before adhesive bonding. Importantly, surface preparation provides a reproducible surface allowing consistent bonding results. The commonly used surface activation techniques include [[plasma activation]], [[flame treatment]] and wet chemistry priming.<ref name=\"Pocius\">A.V. Pocius, \"Adhesion and adhesives technology\", Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich (2002)</ref>\n\n==Failure==\n[[File:AdhesiveFractures.svg|thumbnail|550px|Failure of the adhesive joint can occur in different locations]]\n\nThere are several factors that could contribute to the failure of two adhered surfaces. Sunlight and heat may weaken the adhesive. Solvents can deteriorate or dissolve adhesive. Physical stresses may also cause the separation of surfaces. When subjected to loading, debonding may occur at different locations in the adhesive joint. The major fracture types are the following:\n\n===Cohesive fracture===\n''Cohesive fracture'' is obtained if a crack propagates in the bulk polymer which constitutes the adhesive. In this case the surfaces of both adherends after debonding will be covered by fractured adhesive. The crack may propagate in the center of the layer or near an interface. For this last case, the cohesive fracture can be said to be \"cohesive near the interface\".\n\n===Adhesive fracture===\n''Adhesive fracture'' (sometimes referred to as ''interfacial fracture'') is when debonding occurs between the adhesive and the adherend. In most cases, the occurrence of adhesive fracture for a given adhesive goes along with smaller fracture toughness.\n\n===Other types of fracture===\nOther types of fracture include:\n\n* The ''mixed'' type, which occurs if the crack propagates at some spots in a cohesive and in others in an interfacial manner. Mixed fracture surfaces can be characterised by a certain percentage of adhesive and cohesive areas.\n* The ''alternating crack path'' type which occurs if the cracks jump from one interface to the other. This type of fracture appears in the presence of tensile pre-stresses in the adhesive layer.\n* Fracture can also occur in the adherend if the adhesive is tougher than the adherend. In this case, the adhesive remains intact and is still bonded to one substrate and remnants of the other. For example, when one removes a price label, the adhesive usually remains on the label and the surface. This is cohesive failure. If, however, a layer of paper remains stuck to the surface, the adhesive has not failed. Another example is when someone tries to pull apart [[Oreo]] cookies and all the filling remains on one side; this is an adhesive failure, rather than a cohesive failure.\n\n==Design of adhesive joints==\n[[Image:fracture modes v2.svg|thumbnail|350px|Modes of failure]]\n\nAs a general design rule, the material properties of the object need to be greater than the forces anticipated during its use.  (i.e. geometry, loads, etc.). The engineering work will consist of having a good model to evaluate the function. For most adhesive joints, this can be achieved using [[fracture mechanics]]. Concepts such as the [[stress concentration]] factor and the [[strain energy release rate]] can be used to predict failure. In such models, the behavior of the adhesive layer itself is neglected and only the adherents are considered.\n\nFailure will also very much depend on the opening ''mode'' of the joint.\n* ''Mode I'' is an opening or tensile mode where the loadings are normal to the crack.\n* ''Mode II'' is a sliding or in-plane shear mode where the crack surfaces slide over one another in direction perpendicular to the leading edge of the crack. This is typically the mode for which the adhesive exhibits the highest resistance to fracture.\n* ''Mode III'' is a tearing or antiplane shear mode.\n\nAs the loads are usually fixed, an acceptable design will result from combination of a material selection procedure and geometry modifications, if possible. In adhesively bonded structures, the global geometry and loads are fixed by structural considerations and the design procedure focuses on the material properties of the adhesive and on local changes on the geometry.\n\nIncreasing the joint resistance is usually obtained by designing its geometry so that:\n* The bonded zone is large\n* It is mainly loaded in mode II\n* Stable crack propagation will follow the appearance of a local failure.\n\n==Shelf life==\nSome glues and adhesives have a limited [[shelf life]].  Exposure to heat, oxygen, water vapor, etc. can degrade the adhesive over time, preventing it from functioning properly.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Adhesive surface forces]]\n* [[Adhesive tape]]\n* [[Blu-Tack]]\n* [[Glue stick]]\n* [[Mucilage]]\n* [[Sealant]]\n* [[Wood glue]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Ebnesajjad, Sina (2010). \"History of Adhesives\".

He indicated in interviews that once he has committed to a project, he will go over his lines as many times as is needed (sometimes upwards of 200) until the lines sound natural to him, so that he can \"do it without thinking\". This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand. While it can allow for some careful improvisation, it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script, or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes. Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene, he simply discards the lines, not remembering them later on. This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film, even years later.<ref>\"Anthony Hopkins: Lecter and Me\"&nbsp;\u2014 ''Red Dragon'' DVD interview</ref>\n\n[[Richard Attenborough]], who directed Hopkins on five occasions, found himself going to great lengths during the filming of ''[[Shadowlands (1993 film)|Shadowlands]]'' (1993) to accommodate the differing approaches of his two stars (Hopkins and [[Debra Winger]]), who shared many scenes. Whereas Hopkins, preferring the spontaneity of a fresh take, liked to keep rehearsals to a minimum, Winger rehearsed continuously. To allow for this, Attenborough stood in for Hopkins during Winger's rehearsals, only bringing him in for the last one before a take. The director praised Hopkins for \"this extraordinary ability to make you believe when you hear him that it is the very first time he has ever said that line. It's an incredible gift.\"<ref name=\"falk\" />\n\nRenowned for his ability to remember lines, Hopkins keeps his memory supple by learning things by heart such as poetry and Shakespeare. In Steven Spielberg's ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', Hopkins astounded the crew with his memorisation of a seven-page courtroom speech, delivering it in one go. An overawed Spielberg couldn't bring himself to call him Tony, and insisted on addressing him as Sir Anthony throughout the shoot.<ref name=\"RADA\">[https://www.theguardian.com/film/1998/dec/05/features A dark and stormy knight] ''[[The Guardian]]''.

He played [[Father Dougal McGuire]] in ''[[Father Ted]]'', George Sunday/Thermoman in ''[[My Hero (UK TV series)|My Hero]]'', and DI Jack Mooney in ''[[Death in Paradise (TV series)|Death in Paradise]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nArdal O'Hanlon was born on 8 October 1965 in [[Carrickmacross]], [[County Monaghan]], the son of politician and doctor [[Rory O'Hanlon]] and Teresa Ward. He has five siblings. The episode of ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (Irish TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'' which aired on 6 October 2008 revealed that O'Hanlon's paternal grandfather, Michael O'Hanlon, was a [[University College Dublin|UCD]] medicine student who had joined the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|IRA]] during the [[Irish War of Independence]] and was a member of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]' squad which assassinated British secret service agents on the morning of [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]]. Details of his grandfather's activities survive in UCD Archives, as well as [[Blackrock College]]. It also transpired that, on his mother's side, he is a close relative of [[Peter Fenelon Collier]].\n\nO'Hanlon was schooled in [[Blackrock College]] in Dublin and graduated, in 1987, from the [[National Institute for Higher Education]], [[Dublin]] (now [[Dublin City University]]) with a degree in Communications Studies.\n\n==Career==\nTogether with Kevin Gildea and Barry Murphy, O'Hanlon founded the International Comedy Cellar, upstairs in the International Bar on Dublin's South Wicklow Street. Dublin had no comedy scene at the time. As a stand up, O'Hanlon won the [[Hackney Empire New Act of the Year]] competition in 1994. For a time he was the presenter of ''The Stand Up Show''.\n\nHe was spotted by [[Graham Linehan]], who was to cast him as Father Dougal McGuire in ''[[Father Ted]]'' (1995\u201398). In 1995 he received the Top TV Comedy Newcomer at the British Comedy Awards for this role. In 1995, he appeared (as Father Dougal) in a [[Channel 4]] [[Television ident|ident]] (\"Hello, you're watching.... television\"), and during [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] on BBC1. This was followed by the award-winning short comedy film ''[[Flying Saucer Rock'n'Roll]]''.\n\nO'Hanlon moved into straight acting alongside [[Emma Fielding]] and [[Beth Goddard]] in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] comedy-drama ''Big Bad World'', which aired for two series in summer 1999 and winter 2001. He also played a minor role in ''[[The Butcher Boy (1997 film)|The Butcher Boy]]'' as Joe's (Francie's best friend) father, and appeared in an episode of the original ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line is it Anyway?]]''.\n\nIn 2000, O'Hanlon starred in the comedy series ''[[My Hero (UK TV series)|My Hero]]'', in which he played a very naive superhero from the planet Ultron. His character juggled world-saving heroics with life in suburbia. He stayed in the role until the first episode of series 6 in July 2006 where he was replaced by [[James Dreyfus]] during the same episode.\n\nHe also provided the voice of the lead character in the three Christmas television cartoon specials of ''[[Robbie the Reindeer]]''. He appeared in the 2005 [[BBC One]] sitcom ''[[Blessed (television)|Blessed]]'', written by [[Ben Elton]]; at the 2005 British Comedy Awards, it was publicly slated by [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]], albeit in jest.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Towards the end of 2005, he played an eccentric Scottish character, Coconut Tam, in the family-based film, ''[[The Adventures of Greyfriars Bobby]]''. Although more commonly on television, he has appeared on radio  \u2013 on 18 July 2011, he appeared on ''[[Quote... Unquote]]''. Appropriately, one of his questions concerned a quotation from ''Father Ted''.\n\nIn 2006, O'Hanlon wrote and presented an [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] television series called ''Leagues Apart'', which saw him investigate the biggest and most passionate football rivalries in a number of European countries. Included were Roma vs Lazio in Italy, Barcelona vs Real Madrid in Spain, and Galatasaray vs Fenerbahce in [[Turkey]]. He followed this with another RT\u00c9 show, ''So You Want To Be Taoiseach?'' in 2007. It was a political series where O'Hanlon gave tongue-in-cheek advice on how to go about becoming [[Taoiseach]] of Ireland. Both programmes went some way towards freeing O'Hanlon from his association with the character of Dougal in the minds of Irish audiences.\n\nHe appeared in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\", broadcast on 14 April 2007, in which he played a cat-like creature named Thomas Kincade Brannigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6478495.stm|title=Fans mad for Doctor's new companion|date=22 March 2007|accessdate=3 April 2007|publisher=BBC News|author=Masters, Tim| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070328182935/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6478495.stm| archivedate= 28 March 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> O'Hanlon appears in Series 3 of the TV show ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'', playing Naomi Campbell ([[Lily Loveless]])'s Politics teacher named Kieran, who attempted to kiss her. He then went on to form a relationship with Naomi's mother ([[Olivia Colman]]). O'Hanlon plays the lead role in Irish comedy television programme ''[[Val Falvey, TD]]'' on [[RT\u00c9 One]]. He has recently{{When|date=March 2012}} performed in the [[Edinburgh Fringe]].\n\nIn February 2011, O'Hanlon returned to the [[Gate Theatre]], Dublin starring in the Irish premiere of Christopher Hampton's translation of Yasmina Reza's ''[[God of Carnage]]'', alongside [[Maura Tierney]].\n\nIn 2011, he appeared in the comedy panel show ''[[Argumental]]''.\n\nO'Hanlon has written a novel, ''[[The Talk of the Town (novel)|The Talk of the Town]]'' (known in the United States as ''Knick Knack Paddy Whack''), which was published in 1998. The novel is about a teenage boy, Patrick Scully, and his friends.\n\nIn February 2015 he officially launched the 2015 Sky [[Cat Laughs]] Comedy Festival which takes place in Kilkenny from 28 May\u20131 June.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.evoke.ie/events/ardal-ohanlan-launches-this-years-cats-laughs-as-the-festival-comes-of-age/|work=evoke.ie | title= Ardal O\u2019Hanlan launches this year\u2019s Cats Laughs as the festival comes of age| date= 26 February 2015}}</ref> In 2015 he played the role of Peter the Milkman in the [[Sky 1]] sitcom ''[[After Hours (UK TV series)|After Hours]]''.\n\nOn 2 February 2017, it was announced he would play the lead role in the BBC crime drama ''[[Death in Paradise (TV series)|Death in Paradise]]'' taking the role of DI Jack Mooney following [[Kris Marshall]]'s departure the same day.\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Although the K6 was based on [[Socket 7]], variants such as K6-3/450 were faster than Intel's [[Pentium II]] (sixth-generation processor).\n\nThe K7 was AMD's seventh-generation x86 processor, making its debut on June 23, 1999, under the brand name [[Athlon]]. Unlike previous AMD processors, it could not be used on the same motherboards as Intel's, due to licensing issues surrounding Intel's [[Slot 1]] connector, and instead used a [[Slot A]] connector, referenced to the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] processor bus.  The [[Duron]] was a lower-cost and limited version of the Athlon (64KB instead of 256KB L2 cache) in a 462-pin socketed PGA (socket A) or soldered directly onto the motherboard. [[Sempron]] was released as a lower-cost Athlon XP, replacing Duron in the [[socket A]] PGA era.

The Phenom II also enhanced its predecessor's memory controller, allowing it to use [[DDR3]] in a new native socket [[AM3]], while maintaining backwards compatibility with [[AM2+]], the socket used for the Phenom, and allowing the use of the [[DDR2 SDRAM|DDR2]] memory that was used with the platform.\n\nIn April 2010, AMD released a new Phenom II hexa-core (6-core) processor codenamed \"[[Phenom II#Thuban|Thuban]]\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Walrath|first1=Josh|title=AMD Phenom II X6 1090T 6-core Thuban Processor Review|url=https://www.pcper.com/reviews/Processors/AMD-Phenom-II-X6-1090T-6-core-Thuban-Processor-Review|accessdate=11 July 2017|publisher=PC Perspective|date=27 April 2010}}</ref> This was a totally new die based on the hexa-core \u201cIstanbul\u201d [[Opteron]] processor.

This will use a new G34 socket for dual and quad socket processors and thus will be marketed as Opteron 61xx series processors.

The initiative intended to move some of the processing originally done on the CPU (e.g. [[floating-point unit]] operations) to the GPU, which is better optimized for some calculations. The Fusion was later renamed to the [[AMD APU]] (Accelerated Processing Unit).<ref name=\"APU\">{{cite web| url=https://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/02/amd-reveals-fusion-cpugpu-to-challege-intel-in-laptops.ars| title=AMD reveals Fusion CPU+GPU, to challenge Intel in laptops| first=Jon| last=Stokes| publisher=Ars Technica| date=February 8, 2010| accessdate=February 9, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210011231/http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/02/amd-reveals-fusion-cpugpu-to-challege-intel-in-laptops.ars| archivedate= February 10, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nLlano was AMD's first APU built for [[laptop]]s.

The chipsets include the AMD-640, AMD-751 and the AMD-761 chipsets. The situation changed in 2003 with the release of [[Athlon 64]] processors, and AMD chose not to further design its own chipsets for its desktop processors while opening the desktop platform to allow other firms to design chipsets. This was the \u201c[[Open Platform Management Architecture]]\u201d with [[ATI Technologies|ATI]], [[VIA Technologies|VIA]] and [[Silicon Integrated Systems|SiS]] developing their own chipset for [[Athlon 64]] processors and later [[Athlon 64 X2]] and [[Athlon 64 FX]] processors, including the [[AMD Quad FX platform|Quad FX platform]] chipset from Nvidia.\n\nThe initiative went further with the release of [[Opteron]] server processors as AMD stopped the design of server chipsets in 2004 after releasing the AMD-8111 chipset, and again opened the server platform for firms to develop chipsets for Opteron processors. As of today, [[Nvidia]] and [[Broadcom]] are the sole designing firms of server chipsets for Opteron processors.\n\nAs the company completed the acquisition of ATI Technologies in 2006, the firm gained the ATI design team for chipsets which previously designed the [[Xpress 200|Radeon Xpress 200]] and the [[Xpress 3200|Radeon Xpress 3200]] chipsets. AMD then renamed the chipsets for AMD processors under AMD branding (for instance, the CrossFire Xpress 3200 chipset was renamed as [[AMD 580 chipset series|AMD 580X CrossFire chipset]]). In February 2007, AMD announced the first AMD-branded chipset since 2004 with the release of the AMD [[AMD 690 chipset series|690G]] chipset (previously under the development codename ''RS690''), targeted at mainstream [[Integrated Graphics Processor|IGP]] computing. It was the industry's first to implement a [[HDMI]] 1.2 port on motherboards, shipping for more than a million units. While ATI had aimed at releasing an Intel IGP chipset, the plan was scrapped and the inventories of [[AMD 690 chipset series#Radeon Xpress 1250|Radeon Xpress 1250]] (codenamed ''RS600'', sold under ATI brand) was sold to two OEMs, Abit and ASRock. Although AMD stated the firm would still produce Intel chipsets, Intel had not granted the license of {{nowrap|1333 MHz}} FSB to ATI.\n\nOn November 15, 2007, AMD announced a new chipset series portfolio, the [[AMD 700 chipset series|AMD 7-Series chipsets]], covering from enthusiast multi-graphics segment to value IGP segment, to replace the [[AMD 580 chipset series|AMD 480/570/580 chipsets]] and [[AMD 690 chipset series|AMD 690 series chipsets]], marking AMD's first enthusiast multi-graphics chipset.  Discrete graphics chipsets were launched on November 15, 2007, as part of the codenamed ''Spider'' desktop platform, and IGP chipsets were launched at a later time in spring 2008 as part of the codenamed ''Cartwheel'' platform.\n\nAMD returned to the server chipsets market with the [[AMD 800 chipset series|AMD 800S series server chipsets]]. It includes support for up to six [[Serial ATA#SATA Revision 3.0 (SATA 6Gb/s)|SATA 6.0 Gbit/s]] ports, the C6 power state, which is featured in [[AMD Fusion|Fusion]] processors and [[Advanced Host Controller Interface|AHCI]] 1.2 with SATA [[port multiplier#FIS(Frame Information Structure)\u2013based switching|FIS\u2013based switching]] support. This is a chipset family supporting [[Phenom (processor)|Phenom]] processors and [[AMD Quad FX platform|Quad FX enthusiast platform]] (890FX), [[Integrated Graphics Processor|IGP]](890GX).\n\nWith the advent of AMD's APUs in 2011, traditional north bridge features such as the connection to graphics and the PCI Express controller were incorporated into the APU die. Accordingly, APUs were connected to as single chip chipset, renamed the Fusion Controller Hub (FCH), which primarily provided southbridge functionality.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wasson|first1=Scott|title=AMD's A8-3500M Fusion APU|url=https://techreport.com/review/21099/amd-a8-3500m-fusion-apu|accessdate=10 July 2017|publisher=Tech Report|date=22 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nAMD released new chipsets in 2017 to support the release of their new [[Ryzen]] products.

Intel disputed this, and the case ended up in the [[Supreme Court of California]]. In 1994, that court upheld the arbitrator's decision and awarded damages for breach of contract.\n* In 1990, Intel brought a copyright infringement action alleging illegal use of its 287 microcode. The case ended in 1994 with a jury finding for AMD and its right to use Intel's microcode in its microprocessors through the 486 generation.\n* In 1997, Intel filed suit against AMD and [[Cyrix]] Corp. for misuse of the term [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]]. AMD and Intel settled, with AMD acknowledging MMX as a trademark owned by Intel, and with Intel granting AMD rights to market the AMD K6 MMX processor.\n* In 2005, following an investigation, the Japan Federal Trade Commission found Intel guilty on a number of violations. On June 27, 2005, AMD won an [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] suit against Intel in Japan, and on the same day, AMD filed a broad antitrust complaint against Intel in the U.S. Federal District Court in [[Delaware]]. The complaint alleges systematic use of secret rebates, special discounts, threats, and other means used by Intel to lock AMD processors out of the global market. Since the start of this action, the court has issued [[subpoena]]s to major computer manufacturers including [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Dell]], [[Lenovo]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and [[Toshiba]].\n* In November 2009, Intel agreed to pay AMD $1.25bn and renew a five-year patent cross-licensing agreement as part of a deal to settle all outstanding legal disputes between them.<ref name=\"amd suit\">\"[http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/technology/amd-intel-settle-legal-disputes/ Intel, AMD Settle Legal Disputes]\" {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n===Guinness World Record achievement===\n* On August 31, 2011, in Austin, Texas, AMD achieved a [[Guinness World Record]] for the \"Highest frequency of a computer processor\": 8.429&nbsp;GHz.<ref name=Record>Peter Clarke, EE Times. \"[http://eetimes.com/electronics-news/4226949/AMD-clocks-FX-processor AMD 'clocks' FX processor at 8.429-GHz]\".

Born in [[Free Imperial City of Nuremberg|Nuremberg]], D\u00fcrer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties due to his high-quality [[List of woodcuts by D\u00fcrer|woodcut prints]].\nHe was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and from 1512 he was patronized by Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]. D\u00fcrer is commemorated by both the Lutheran and Episcopal Churches.\n\n[[File:'The Expulsion From Paradise'.jpg|thumb|''The Expulsion From Paradise'']]\n\nD\u00fcrer's vast body of work includes [[List of engravings by D\u00fcrer|engraving]]s, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, [[watercolour]]s and books. The woodcuts, such as the ''[[Apocalypse (D\u00fcrer)|Apocalypse]]'' series (1498), are more [[Gothic art|Gothic]] than the rest of his work. \nHis well-known engravings include the ''[[Knight, Death, and the Devil]]'' (1513), ''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (D\u00fcrer)|Saint Jerome in his Study]]'' (1514) and ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European [[landscape art]]ists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium.\n\nD\u00fcrer's introduction of [[Roman mythology|classical motifs]] into Northern art, through his knowledge of [[Italian Renaissance|Italian artists]] and [[Humanism in Germany|German humanists]], has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the [[Northern Renaissance]]. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, [[linear perspective|perspective]], and [[body proportions|ideal proportions]].\n\n==Early life (1471\u20131490)==\n[[File:Self-portrait at 13 by Albrecht D\u00fcrer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Self-portrait]] [[silverpoint]] drawing by the thirteen-year-old D\u00fcrer, 1484]]\n\nD\u00fcrer was born on 21 May 1471, third child and second son of his parents, who had at least fourteen and possibly as many as eighteen children.  His father, [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer the Elder]] (originally Albrecht Ajt\u00f3si), was a successful [[goldsmith]] who in 1455 had moved to Nuremberg from {{ill|Ajt\u00f3s|hu|Ajt\u00f3s|fr|Ajt\u00f3s}}, near [[Gyula (town)|Gyula]] in [[Hungary]].<ref name=\"heaton\">{{Cite journal|title=The Life of Albrecht D\u00fcrer of N\u00fcrnberg: With a Translation of His Letters and Journal and an Account of His Works|first=Mrs. Charles|last=Heaton|authorlink=Mary Margaret Heaton|publisher=Seeley, Jackson and Halliday|year=1881|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=netZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA29}}.</ref> One of Albrecht's brothers, [[Hans D\u00fcrer]], was also a painter and trained under him.

A door is featured in the [[coat-of-arms]] the family acquired. Albrecht D\u00fcrer the Younger later changed \"T\u00fcrer\", his father's diction of the family's surname, to \"D\u00fcrer\", to adapt to the local Nuremberg dialect. D\u00fcrer the Elder married Barbara Holper, daughter of his master when he himself qualified as a master in 1467.<ref>Bartrum, 93, note 1</ref>\n\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Coat of Arms of the House of D\u00fcrer - WGA07258.jpg|thumb|upright|Woodcut by D\u00fcrer of his [[coat of arms]], which featured a door as a pun on his name, as well as the winged bust of a [[Moors|Moor]]]]\n\nD\u00fcrer's godfather was [[Anton Koberger]], who left goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher in the year of D\u00fcrer's birth, and became the most successful publisher in Germany, eventually owning twenty-four [[printing-press]]es and built a number of offices in Germany and abroad. Koberger's most famous publication was the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'', published in 1493 in German and Latin editions. It contained an unprecedented 1,809 [[woodcut]] illustrations (albeit with many repeated uses of the same block) by the [[Wolgemut]] workshop. D\u00fcrer may have worked on some of these, as the work on the project began while he was with Wolgemut.<ref name=\"Bartrum\">Giulia Bartrum, \"Albrecht D\u00fcrer and his Legacy\", British Museum Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7141-2633-0}}</ref>\n\nBecause D\u00fcrer left autobiographical writings and became very famous by his mid-twenties, his life is well documented by several sources. After a few years of school, D\u00fcrer started to learn the basics of goldsmithing and drawing from his father. Though his father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith, he showed such a precocious talent in drawing that he started as an apprentice to [[Michael Wolgemut]] at the age of fifteen in 1486. A self-portrait, a drawing in [[silverpoint]], is dated 1484 ([[Albertina, Vienna]]) \"when I was a child\", as his later inscription says. Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time, with a large workshop producing a variety of works of art, in particular woodcuts for books. Nuremberg was then an important and prosperous city, a centre for publishing and many luxury trades. It had strong links with Italy, especially [[Venice]], a relatively short distance across the [[Alps]].<ref name=\"Bartrum\"/>\n\n==''Wanderjahre'' and marriage (1490\u20131494)==\n[[File:Albrecht-self.jpg|thumb|left|The earliest painted ''[[Portrait of the Artist Holding a Thistle (Albrecht D\u00fcrer)|Self-Portrait]]'' (1493) by Albrecht D\u00fcrer, oil, originally on [[vellum]] ([[Louvre]], [[Paris]])]]\n\nAfter completing his apprenticeship, D\u00fcrer followed the common German custom of taking ''[[Wanderjahre]]''\u2014in effect [[gap year]]s\u2014in which the apprentice learned skills from artists in other areas; D\u00fcrer was to spend about four years away.  He left in 1490, possibly to work under [[Martin Schongauer]], the leading engraver of Northern Europe, but who died shortly before D\u00fcrer's arrival at [[Colmar]] in 1492. It is unclear where D\u00fcrer travelled in the intervening period, though it is likely that he went to [[Frankfurt]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In Colmar, D\u00fcrer was welcomed by Schongauer's brothers, the goldsmiths Caspar and Paul and the painter Ludwig. In 1493 D\u00fcrer went to [[Strasbourg]], where he would have experienced the sculpture of [[Nikolaus Gerhaert]]. D\u00fcrer's first painted self-portrait (now in the [[Louvre]]) was painted at this time, probably to be sent back to his fianc\u00e9e in Nuremberg.<ref name=\"Bartrum\"/>\n\nIn early 1492 D\u00fcrer travelled to [[Basel]] to stay with another brother of Martin Schongauer, the goldsmith Georg.<ref>Here he produced a woodcut of [[St Jerome]] as a frontispiece for Nicholaus Kessler's 'Epistolare beati Hieronymi'. [[Erwin Panofsky]] argues that this print combined the '[[Ulm]]ian style' of Koberger's 'Lives of the Saints' (1488) and that of Wolgemut's workshop. Panofsky, 21</ref>  Very soon after his return to Nuremberg, on 7 July 1494, at the age of 23, D\u00fcrer was married to [[Agnes Frey]] following an arrangement made during his absence. Agnes was the daughter of a prominent brass worker (and amateur harpist) in the city. However, no children resulted from the marriage, and with Albrecht the D\u00fcrer name died out. The marriage between Agnes and Albrecht was not a generally happy one, as indicated by the letters of D\u00fcrer in which he quipped to [[Willibald Pirckheimer]] in an extremely rough tone about his wife. He called her an \"old crow\" and made other vulgar remarks. Pirckheimer also made no secret of his antipathy towards Agnes, describing her as a miserly shrew with a bitter tongue, who helped cause D\u00fcrer's death at a young age.<ref name=\"Wilmot-BuxtonPoynter1881\">{{cite book|author1=Harry John Wilmot-Buxton|author2=Edward John Poynter|title=German, Flemish and Dutch Painting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aLgnAAAAYAAJ|year=1881|publisher=Scribner and Welford|page=24}}</ref> It is speculated by many scholars Albrecht was bisexual, if not homosexual, due to several of his works containing themes of homosexual desire, as well as the intimate nature of his correspondence with certain very close male friends.<ref name=\"Haggerty2013\">{{cite book|author=George Haggerty|title=Encyclopedia of Gay Histories and Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pez9AQAAQBAJ|date=5 November 2013|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-135-58513-6|page=262}}</ref>\n\n==First journey to Italy (1494\u20131495)==\n[[File:Agnes Duerer 1494.jpg|thumb|upright|D\u00fcrer's sketch of his wife Agnes Frey 1494]]\n\nWithin three months of his marriage, D\u00fcrer left for Italy, alone, perhaps stimulated by an outbreak of [[Black Death|plague]] in Nuremberg. He made watercolour sketches as he traveled over the Alps. Some have survived and others may be deduced from accurate landscapes of real places in his later work, for example his engraving ''Nemesis''.\n\nIn Italy, he went to Venice to study its more advanced artistic world.<ref name=Lee>Lee, Raymond L. & Alistair B.

He wrote that [[Giovanni Bellini]] was the oldest and still the best of the artists in Venice. His drawings and engravings show the influence of others, notably [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]], with his interest in the proportions of the body; [[Lorenzo di Credi]]; and [[Andrea Mantegna]], whose work he produced copies of while training.<ref>Campbell, Angela and Raftery, Andrew. \"Remaking D\u00fcrer: Investigating the Master Engravings by Masterful Engraving,\" [http://artinprint.org/article/remaking-durer-investigating-the-master-engravings/ ''Art in Print'' Vol. 2 No. 4] (November\u2013December 2012).</ref> D\u00fcrer probably also visited [[Padua, Italy|Padua]] and [[Mantua]] on this trip.<ref>The evidence for this trip is not conclusive; the suggestion it happened is supported by Panofsky (in his Albrecht D\u00fcrer, 1943) and others, but it has been disputed by other scholars, including Katherine Crawford Luber (in her Albrecht D\u00fcrer and the Venetian Renaissance, 2005).</ref>\n\n==Return to Nuremberg (1495\u20131505)==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Melencolia I - Google Art Project (427760).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Melencolia I]]'' (1514), engraving]]\n\nOn his return to [[Nuremberg]] in 1495, D\u00fcrer opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this). Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. D\u00fcrer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1514. Arguably his best works in the first years of the workshop were his [[woodcut]] prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as ''The Men's Bath House'' (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition.\n\nIt is now thought unlikely that D\u00fcrer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. D\u00fcrer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.\n\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Oswolt Krel - WGA6934.jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of Oswolt Krel'', a merchant from [[Lindau]] ([[Lake Constance]]), participating in the South German medieval trade corporation Gro\u00dfe [[Ravensburg]]er Handelsgesellschaft, 1499.]]\n\nHis famous series of sixteen great designs for the ''Apocalypse<ref>[http://www.payer.de/christentum/apokalypse.htm Johannesapokalypse in klassischen Comics]</ref>'' is dated 1498, as is his engraving of'' [[St. Michael Fighting the Dragon-Albrecht Durer|St. Michael Fighting the Dragon]]''. He made the first seven scenes of the ''Great Passion'' in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the [[Holy Family]] and saints. The ''[[Polyptych of the Seven Sorrows|Seven Sorrows Polyptych]]'', commissioned by [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III of Saxony]] in 1496, was executed by D\u00fcrer and his assistants c. 1500. Around 1503\u20131505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'', which he did not finish for some years. Neither these, nor the ''Great Passion,'' were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers.<ref name=\"Bartrum\"/>\n\nDuring the same period D\u00fcrer trained himself in the difficult art of using the [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] to make engravings. It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father, as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith. In 1496 he executed the ''Prodigal Son'', which the Italian Renaissance art historian [[Giorgio Vasari]] singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality. He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably ''Nemesis'' (1502), ''The Sea Monster'' (1498), and ''Saint Eustace'' (c. 1501), with a highly detailed landscape background and animals. His landscapes of this period, such as ''Pond in the Woods'' and ''Willow Mill'', are quite different from his earlier watercolours. There is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere, rather than depicting topography. He made a number of [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]s, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures. Prints are highly portable and these works made D\u00fcrer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years.<ref name=\"Bartrum\"/>\n\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer Betende H\u00e4nde.jpg|upright|thumb|''[[Praying Hands (D\u00fcrer)|Praying Hands]]'', pen-and-ink drawing (c. 1508)]]\n\nThe Venetian artist [[Jacopo de' Barbari]], whom D\u00fcrer had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and D\u00fcrer said that he learned much about the new developments in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], [[anatomy]], and [[Body proportions|proportion]] from him.  De' Barbari was unwilling to explain everything he knew, so D\u00fcrer began his own studies, which would become a lifelong preoccupation. A series of extant drawings show D\u00fcrer's experiments in human proportion, leading to the famous engraving of ''[[Adam and Eve (D\u00fcrer)|Adam and Eve]]'' (1504), which shows his subtlety while using the burin in the texturing of flesh surfaces.<ref name=\"Bartrum\"/>  This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name.\n\nD\u00fcrer created large numbers of preparatory drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the ''[[Betende H\u00e4nde]]'' (''Praying Hands'') from circa 1508, a study for an apostle in the Heller altarpiece. He continued to make images in watercolour and [[bodycolour]] (usually combined), including a number of still lifes of meadow sections or animals, including his ''[[Young Hare]]'' (1502) and the ''[[Great Piece of Turf]]'' (1503).\n\n==Second journey to Italy (1505\u20131507)==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Jesus among the Doctors - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Christ among the Doctors (D\u00fcrer)|Christ among the Doctors]]'' (1506), [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]]]]\n\nIn Italy, he returned to painting, at first producing a series of works executed in [[tempera]] on [[linen]]. These include portraits and altarpieces, notably, the [[Paumgartner altarpiece]] and the ''[[Adoration of the Magi (D\u00fcrer)|Adoration of the Magi]]''. In early 1506, he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507.<ref name=Mueller /> By this time D\u00fcrer's engravings had attained great popularity and were being copied. In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of [[San Bartolomeo, Venice|San Bartolomeo]]. This was the altar-piece known as the ''[[Feast of the Rosary|Adoration of the Virgin]]'' or the ''Feast of Rose Garlands''. It includes portraits of members of Venice's German community, but shows a strong Italian influence. It was subsequently acquired by the Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] and taken to Prague. Other paintings D\u00fcrer produced in Venice include ''The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch'', ''[[Christ among the Doctors (D\u00fcrer)|Christ among the Doctors]]'' (supposedly produced in a mere five days), and a number of smaller works.\n\n==Nuremberg and the masterworks (1507\u20131520)==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Adam and Eve, 1504, Engraving.jpg|thumb|''Adam and Eve'', 1504]]\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Adam and Eve (Prado) 2.jpg|thumb|''[[Adam and Eve (D\u00fcrer)|Adam and Eve]]'', 1507, [[Museo del Prado]]]]\n\nDespite the regard in which he was held by the Venetians, D\u00fcrer returned to Nuremberg by mid-1507, remaining in Germany until 1520. His reputation had spread throughout Europe and he was on friendly terms and in communication with most of the major artists including [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]] and\u2014mainly through [[Lorenzo di Credi]]\u2014[[Leonardo da Vinci]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nBetween 1507 and 1511 D\u00fcrer worked on some of his most celebrated paintings: ''[[Adam and Eve (D\u00fcrer)|Adam and Eve]]'' (1507), ''[[The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand (D\u00fcrer)|The Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand]]'' (1508, for Frederick of Saxony), ''Virgin with the Iris'' (1508), the altarpiece ''Assumption of the Virgin'' (1509, for Jacob Heller of Frankfurt), and ''[[Adoration of the Trinity]]'' (1511, for Matthaeus Landauer). During this period he also completed two woodcut series, the Great Passion and the Life of the Virgin, both published in 1511 together with a second edition of the Apocalypse series. The post-Venetian woodcuts show D\u00fcrer's development of [[chiaroscuro]] modelling effects,<ref>Panofsky, 135</ref> creating a mid-tone throughout the print to which the highlights and shadows can be contrasted.\n\nOther works from this period include the thirty-seven woodcut subjects of the Little Passion, published first in 1511, and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512. Indeed, complaining that painting did not make enough money to justify the time spent when compared to his prints, he produced no paintings from 1513 to 1516. However, in 1513 and 1514 D\u00fcrer created his three most famous [[engraving]]s: ''[[Knight, Death, and the Devil]]'' (1513, probably based on [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]'s treatise ''[[Enchiridion militis Christiani]]''), ''[[St. Jerome in His Study (D\u00fcrer)|St. Jerome in his Study]]'', and the much-debated ''[[Melencolia I]]'' (both 1514). Further outstanding pen and ink drawings of D\u00fcrer\u00b4s period of art work of 1513 were drafts for his friend Willibald Prickheimer. These drafts were later used to design the famous chandeliers [[lusterweibchen]].\n\nIn 1515, he created his ''[[D\u00fcrer's Rhinoceros|woodcut of a Rhinoceros]]'' which had arrived in [[Lisbon]] from a written description and sketch by another artist, without ever seeing the animal himself. An image of the [[Indian rhinoceros]], the image has such force that it remains one of his best-known and was still used in some German school science text-books as late as last century.<ref name=\"Bartrum\"/> In the years leading to 1520 he produced a wide range of works, including the woodblocks for the first western printed star charts in 1515<ref>[http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/durer.htm D\u00fcrer's hemispheres of 1515\u2014the first European printed star charts]</ref> and portraits in [[tempera]] on [[linen]] in 1516. His only experiments with [[etching]] came in this period, producing five 1515-1516 and a sixth 1518; a technique he may have abandoned as unsuited to his aesthetic of methodical, classical form.<ref>Cohen, Brian D.

His commissions included ''[[The Triumphal Arch]]'', a vast work printed from 192 separate blocks, the symbolism of which is partly informed by Pirckheimer's translation of [[Horapollo]]'s ''Hieroglyphica''. The design program and explanations were devised by [[Johannes Stabius]], the architectural design by the master builder and court-painter J\u00f6rg K\u00f6lderer and the woodcutting itself by Hieronymous Andreae, with D\u00fcrer as designer-in-chief. ''The Arch'' was followed by ''[[The Triumphal Procession]]'', the program of which was worked out in 1512 by [[:de:Marx Treitzsaurwein|Marx Treitz-Saurwein]] and includes woodcuts by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] and [[Hans Springinklee]], as well as D\u00fcrer.\n\nD\u00fcrer worked with pen on the marginal images for an edition of the Emperor's printed Prayer-Book; these were quite unknown until facsimiles were published in 1808 as part of the first book published in [[lithography]]. D\u00fcrer's work on the book was halted for an unknown reason, and the decoration was continued by artists including [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and [[Hans Baldung]]. D\u00fcrer also made several portraits of the Emperor, including one shortly before Maximilian's death in 1519.\n\n==Journey to the Netherlands (1520\u20131521)==\n[[File:Bezoek van Albrecht D\u00fcrer in Antwerpen in 1520, Henri Leys, 1855, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten Antwerpen, 2198.jpg|thumb|400px|Visit of Albrecht D\u00fcrer in Antwerp in 1520, Henri Leys, 1855, [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp]], 2198]]\nMaximilian's death came at a time when D\u00fcrer was concerned he was losing \"my sight and freedom of hand\" (perhaps caused by [[arthritis]]) and increasingly affected by the writings of [[Martin Luther]].<ref>Bartrum, 204. Quotation from a letter to the secretary of the Elector of Saxony</ref> In July 1520 D\u00fcrer made his fourth and last major journey, to renew the Imperial pension Maximilian had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who was to be crowned at [[Aachen]]. D\u00fcrer journeyed with his wife and her maid via the [[Rhine]] to [[Cologne]] and then to [[Antwerp]], where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in [[silverpoint]], chalk and charcoal. In addition to going to the coronation, he made excursions to Cologne (where he admired the painting of [[Stefan Lochner]]), [[Nijmegen]], [['s-Hertogenbosch]], [[Bruges]] (where he saw [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Madonna of Bruges]]), [[Ghent]] (where he admired [[Jan van Eyck|van Eyck]]'s altarpiece), and [[Zeeland]].\n\nD\u00fcrer took a large stock of prints with him and wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged or sold them, and for how much. This provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time. Unlike paintings, their sale was very rarely documented.<ref>Landau & Parshall:350-54 and ''passim''</ref> While providing valuable documentary evidence, D\u00fcrer's Netherlandish diary also reveals that the trip was not a profitable one. For example, D\u00fcrer offered his last portrait of Maximilian to his daughter, [[Margaret of Habsburg (1480\u20131530)|Margaret of Austria]], but eventually traded the picture for some white cloth after Margaret disliked the portrait and declined to accept it. During this trip he also met [[Bernard van Orley]], [[Jan Provoost]], [[Gerard Horenbout]], [[Jean Mone]], [[Joachim Patinir]] and [[Tommaso Vincidor]], though he did not, it seems, meet [[Quentin Matsys]].<ref>Panofsky, 209</ref>\n\nAt the request of [[Christian II of Denmark]], D\u00fcrer went to Brussels to paint the King's portrait. There he saw \"the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land\"\u2014the [[Aztec]] treasure that [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of Mexico. D\u00fcrer wrote that this treasure \"was much more beautiful to me than miracles. These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]]s\".<ref name=\"Bartrum\"/>  D\u00fcrer also appears to have been collecting for his own [[cabinet of curiosities]], and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of [[coral]], some large fish fins, and a wooden weapon from the [[East Indies]].\n\nHaving secured his pension, D\u00fcrer finally returned home in July 1521, having caught an undetermined illness\u2014perhaps [[malaria]]<ref>Panofsky</ref>\u2014which afflicted him for the rest of his life, and greatly reduced his rate of work.<ref name=\"Bartrum\"/>\n\n==Final years in Nuremberg (1521\u20131528)==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer 100.jpg|thumb|''Salvator Mundi'', an unfinished oil painting on wood, full painting]]\n\nOn his return to Nuremberg, D\u00fcrer worked on a number of grand projects with religious themes, including a crucifixion scene and a [[Sacra conversazione|Sacra Conversazione]], though neither was completed.<ref>Panofsky, 223</ref> This may have been due in part to his declining health, but perhaps also because of the time he gave to the preparation of his theoretical works on geometry and perspective, the [[body proportions|proportions]] of men and horses, and [[fortification]].\n\nHowever, one consequence of this shift in emphasis was that during the last years of his life, D\u00fcrer produced comparatively little as an artist. In painting, there was only a portrait of [[commons:File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer 078.jpg|Hieronymus Holtzschuher]], a [[commons:File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer 061.jpg|''Madonna and Child'' (1526)]], [[commons:File:Albrecht d\u00fcrer salvator mundi.JPG|''Salvator Mundi '' (1526)]], and two panels showing [[John the Apostle|St. John]] with [[St. Peter]] in [[commons:File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer 026.jpg|background]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] with [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]] in the [[commons:File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer 027.jpg|background]]. This last great work, [[the Four Apostles]], was given by D\u00fcrer to the City of Nuremberg\u2014although he was given 100 guilders in return.<ref name=\"Panofsky\"/>\n\n[[File:D\u00fcrer Salvator Mundi detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A close up reveals D\u00fcrer's highly detailed preparatory drawing]]\n\nAs for engravings, D\u00fcrer's work was restricted to portraits and illustrations for his treatise. The portraits include Cardinal-Elector [[Albert of Mainz]]; [[Frederick the Wise]], elector of Saxony; the [[Humanism|humanist]] scholar [[Willibald Pirckheimer]]; [[Philipp Melanchthon]], and [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]]. For those of [[Albert of Mainz|the Cardinal]], Melanchthon, and D\u00fcrer's final major work, a drawn portrait of the Nuremberg patrician Ulrich Starck, D\u00fcrer depicted the sitters in profile, perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach.\n\nDespite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education, D\u00fcrer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boyhood friend [[Willibald Pirckheimer]], whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images.<ref>[[Corine Schleif]] (2010), \"Albrecht D\u00fcrer between Agnes Frey and Willibald Pirckheimer\", ''The Essential D\u00fcrer'', ed. Larry Silver and [[Jeffrey Chipps Smith]], Philadelphia, 85\u2013205</ref> He also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with Erasmus and other scholars. D\u00fcrer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime. \"The Four Books on Measurement\" were published at Nuremberg in 1525 and was the first book for adults on [[mathematics]] in German,<ref name=\"Bartrum\"/> as well as being cited later by [[Galileo]] and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. The other, a work on city fortifications, was published in 1527. \"The Four Books on Human Proportion\" were published posthumously, shortly after his death in 1528.<ref name=Mueller />\n\nD\u00fcrer died in Nuremberg at the age of 56, leaving an estate valued at 6,874 florins \u2014 a considerable sum.  He is buried in the ''Johannisfriedhof'' cemetery.  [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer's House|His large house]] (purchased in 1509 from the heirs of the astronomer [[Bernhard Walther]]), where his workshop was located and where his widow lived until her death in 1539, remains a prominent Nuremberg landmark.<ref name=\"Bartrum\"/>  It is now a museum.\n\n===D\u00fcrer and the Reformation===\n[[File:Durerhaus-nbg.jpg|thumb|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer's House]] in [[Nuremberg]]]]\n\nD\u00fcrer's writings suggest that he may have been sympathetic to [[Martin Luther]]'s ideas, though it is unclear if he ever left the Catholic Church. D\u00fcrer wrote of his desire to draw Luther in his diary in 1520: \"And God help me that I may go to Dr. Martin Luther; thus I intend to make a portrait of him with great care and engrave him on a copper plate to create a lasting memorial of the Christian man who helped me overcome so many difficulties.\"<ref>Price (2003), 225</ref>  In a letter to [[Nicholas Kratzer]] in 1524, D\u00fcrer wrote \"because of our Christian faith we have to stand in scorn and danger, for we are reviled and called heretics\". Most tellingly, [[Willibald Pirckheimer|Pirckheimer]] wrote in a letter to Johann Tscherte in 1530: \"I confess that in the beginning I believed in Luther, like our Albert of blessed memory ... but as anyone can see, the situation has become worse.\" D\u00fcrer may even have contributed to the Nuremberg City Council's mandating Lutheran sermons and services in March 1525. Notably, D\u00fcrer had contacts with various reformers, such as [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Andreas Karlstadt]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]], [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] and Cornelius Grapheus from whom D\u00fcrer received Luther's ''[[On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church|Babylonian Captivity]]'' in 1520.<ref>Price:225\u2013248</ref>\n\n[[File:N\u00fcrnberger Feldschlange.JPG|thumb|right|''The Cannon'', D\u00fcrer's largest etching, 1518]]\n\nD\u00fcrer's later works have also been claimed to show [[Protestant]] sympathies. For example, his woodcut of ''[[The Last Supper]]'' of 1523 has often been understood to have an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] theme, focussing as it does on Christ espousing the [[Gospel]], as well the inclusion of the [[Eucharist]]ic cup, an expression of Protestant [[Utraquist|utraquism]],<ref>Strauss, 1981</ref> although this interpretation has been questioned.<ref>Price:254</ref> The delaying of the engraving of [[Philip the Apostle|St Philip]], completed in 1523 but not distributed until 1526, may have been due to D\u00fcrer's uneasiness with images of Saints; even if D\u00fcrer was not an [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]], in his last years he evaluated and questioned the role of art in religion.<ref>Harbison</ref>\n\n==Legacy and influence==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Adoration of the Trinity (Landauer Altar) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Adoration of the Trinity'' (Landauer Altar)]]\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Feast of Rose Garlands - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Feast of the Rosary]]'' (1506)]]\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Adorazione dei Magi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Adoration of the Magi'' (1504), oil on wood [[Galleria degli Uffizi]], [[Florence]]]]\n\nD\u00fcrer exerted a huge influence on the artists of succeeding generations, especially in printmaking, the medium through which his contemporaries mostly experienced his art, as his paintings were predominantly in private collections located in only a few cities. His success in spreading his reputation across Europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as [[Raphael]], [[Titian]], and [[Parmigianino]], all of whom collaborated with printmakers in order to promote and distribute their work.\n\nHis work in [[engraving]] seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his German successors, the \"[[Little Masters]]\" who attempted few large engravings but continued D\u00fcrer's themes in small, rather cramped compositions. [[Lucas van Leyden]] was the only Northern European engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century. The generation of Italian engravers who trained in the shadow of D\u00fcrer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds ([[Giulio Campagnola]], [[Giovanni Battista Palumba]], [[Benedetto Montagna]] and [[Cristofano Robetta]]), or whole prints ([[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and [[Agostino Veneziano]]). However, D\u00fcrer's influence became less dominant after 1515, when Marcantonio perfected his new engraving style, which in turn travelled over the Alps to dominate Northern engraving also.\n\nIn painting, D\u00fcrer had relatively little influence in Italy, where probably only his altarpiece in Venice was seen, and his German successors were less effective in blending German and Italian styles. His intense and self-dramatizing self-portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present, especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style. D\u00fcrer has never fallen from critical favour, and there have been significant revivals of interest in his works in Germany in the ''D\u00fcrer Renaissance'' of about 1570 to 1630, in the early nineteenth century, and in German [[nationalism]] from 1870 to 1945.<ref name=\"Bartrum\"/>\n\nD\u00fcrer's study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by [[D'Arcy Thompson]] in his book ''On Growth and Form''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thompson, D'Arcy|year=1917|title=On Growth and Form|place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=290\u2013292}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lutheran Church]] remembers D\u00fcrer as a great Christian annually on 6 April,<ref>''Lutheranism 101'' edited by Scot A. Kinnaman, CPH, 2010</ref> along with [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and [[Hans Burgkmair]]. The [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (United States)]] remembers him, Cranach and [[Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald]] on 5 August.\n\n==Theoretical works==\n\nIn all his theoretical works, in order to communicate his theories in the [[German language]] rather than in [[Latin]], D\u00fcrer used graphic expressions based on a [[vernacular]], craftsmen's language. For example, \"Schneckenlinie\" (\"snail-line\") was his term for a spiral form. Thus, D\u00fcrer contributed to the expansion in German prose which [[Martin Luther]] had begun with his translation of the [[Luther Bible|Bible]].<ref name=\"Panofsky\">Erwin Panofsky, ''The Life and Art of Albrecht D\u00fcrer'', Princeton, 1945, {{ISBN|0-691-00303-3}}</ref>\n\n===''Four Books on Measurement''===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\nD\u00fcrer's work on [[geometry]] is called the ''Four Books on Measurement'' (''Underweysung der Messung mit dem Zirckel und Richtscheyt'' or ''Instructions for Measuring with [[Compass (drawing tool)|Compass]] and Ruler'').<ref>A. Koyre, \"The Exact Sciences\", in ''The Beginnings of Modern Science'', edited by Rene Taton, translated by A. J. Pomerans</ref> The first book focuses on linear geometry. D\u00fcrer's geometric constructions include [[helices]], [[Conchoid (mathematics)|conchoids]] and [[epicycloid]]s. He also draws on [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]], and [[Johannes Werner]]'s 'Libellus super viginti duobus elementis conicis' of 1522.\n\nThe second book moves onto two dimensional geometry, i.e. the construction of regular [[polygon]]s. Here D\u00fcrer favours the methods of [[Ptolemy]] over [[Euclid]]. The third book applies these principles of geometry to [[architecture]], [[engineering]] and [[typography]].\n\nIn architecture D\u00fcrer cites [[Vitruvius]] but elaborates his own classical designs and [[classical orders|columns]]. In [[typography]], D\u00fcrer depicts the geometric construction of the [[Latin alphabet]], relying on [[History of western typography#Classical revival|Italian precedent]]. However, his construction of the [[Gothic alphabet]] is based upon an entirely different [[modular]] system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]]. Here D\u00fcrer discusses the five [[Platonic solid]]s, as well as seven [[Archimedean solid|Archimedean]] semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention.\n\nIn all these, D\u00fcrer shows the objects as [[Net (polyhedron)|nets]]. Finally, D\u00fcrer discusses the [[Doubling the cube|Delian Problem]]  and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through [[linear perspective]]. It was in [[Bologna]] that D\u00fcrer was taught (possibly by [[Luca Pacioli]] or [[Bramante]]) the principles of [[linear perspective]], and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of [[Piero della Francesca]]. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Although D\u00fcrer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, D\u00fcrer discusses in this last book of ''Underweysung der Messung'' an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.\n\n===''Four Books on Human Proportion''===\n[[File:D\u00fcrer - Vier B\u00fccher von menschlicher Proportion ita., 1594 - 168613 Illustrazione 3v.jpg|thumb|Illustration from the ''Four Books on Human Proportion'']]\n\nD\u00fcrer's work on [[body proportions|human proportions]] is called the ''Four Books on Human Proportion'' (''Vier B\u00fccher von Menschlicher Proportion'') of 1528.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/hierinnsindbegri00dure|title=Hierinn sind begriffen vier Bucher von menschlicher Proportion durch Albrechten Durer von Nurerberg|last=Durer|first=Albrecht|date=1528|publisher=Hieronymus Andreae Formschneider|access-date=6 August 2018}}</ref> The first book was mainly composed by 1512/13 and completed by 1523, showing five differently constructed types of both male and female figures, all parts of the body expressed in fractions of the total height. D\u00fcrer based these constructions on both [[Vitruvius]] and empirical observations of, \"two to three hundred living persons\",<ref name=\"Panofsky\"/>  in his own words. The second book includes eight further types, broken down not into fractions but an [[Leone Battista Alberti|Albertian]] system, which D\u00fcrer probably learned from [[Francesco di Giorgio]]'s 'De harmonica mundi totius' of 1525. In the third book, D\u00fcrer gives principles by which the proportions of the figures can be modified, including the mathematical simulation of [[convex mirror|convex]] and [[concave mirror]]s; here D\u00fcrer also deals with human [[physiognomy]]. The fourth book is devoted to the theory of movement.\n\nAppended to the last book, however, is a self-contained essay on aesthetics, which D\u00fcrer worked on between 1512 and 1528, and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning 'ideal beauty'. D\u00fcrer rejected Alberti's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety. Nonetheless, D\u00fcrer still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code. In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), na\u00efve approval ('Wohlgefallen') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass'). However, unlike Alberti and Leonardo, D\u00fcrer was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images. Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528, D\u00fcrer's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or [[artistic inspiration|inspired]] to a concept of 'selective inward synthesis'.<ref name=\"Panofsky\"/> In other words, that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things. D\u00fcrer's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that \"one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day, or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron, and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year\".<ref>Panofsky, 283</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:AlbrechtD\u00fcrer01.jpg|Title page of ''Vier B\u00fccher von menschlicher Proportion'' showing the monogram signature of artist\nFile:Durer foot.jpg|D\u00fcrer often used [[multiview orthographic projection]]s\nFile:Durer face transforms.jpg|D\u00fcrer's study of human proportions\n</gallery>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"168\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"4\" caption=\"Paintings\">\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Ritratto del padre - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[Portrait Diptych of D\u00fcrer's Parents|Albrecht D\u00fcrer the Elder with a Rosary]]'', 1490, [[Uffizi|Galleria degli Uffizi]], [[Florence]]\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer 012.jpg|''St Jerome in the Wilderness'', 1495, oil on panel, [[National Gallery]], London\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Selbstbildnis mit 26 Jahren (Prado, Madrid).jpg|''[[Self-portrait at 26|Self-portrait]]'', 1498, [[Museo del Prado]], oil on wood panel\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - 1500 self-portrait (High resolution and detail).jpg|Albrecht D\u00fcrer - 1500 self-portrait\nFile:Madonna Haller.jpg|Detail, ''[[Haller Madonna]]'', 1505, [[National Gallery]]\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Virgin and child with a pear - Google Art Project.jpg|''Madonna of the Pear'', 1512, oil on panel, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Bernhard von Reesen - Google Art Project.jpg|''Portrait of Bernhard von Reesen'', 1521, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie]]\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer Saint Jerome 1521.jpg|''Saint Jerome'', 1521, [[Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga]], [[Lisbon]]\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer 078.jpg|''Portrait of Hieronymus Holzschuher'', 1526\n</gallery>\n\n<gallery widths=\"168px\" heights=\"168px\" perrow=\"4\" caption=\"Watercolours\">\nFile:Innsbruck castle courtyard.jpg|''Innsbruck Castle Courtyard'', 1494, Gouache and watercolour on paper\nFile:Chateau-fort-Durer.jpg|Castle Segonzano, 1502, gouache and watercolour on paper\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Hare, 1502 - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[Young Hare]]'', (1502), Watercolour and bodycolour ([[Albertina, Vienna]])\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - The Large Piece of Turf, 1503 - Google Art Project.jpg|''The Large Piece of Turf'', 1503\n</gallery>\n\n<gallery widths=\"168\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"4\" caption=\"Drawings and engravings\">\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Man of Sorrows - Google Art Project.jpg|''Man of Sorrows''\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Head of an Old Man, 1521 - Google Art Project.jpg|''Head of an Old Man'', 1521\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Bearing of the Cross - Google Art Project.jpg|''Bearing of the Cross''\nFile:St. Cristopher-D\u00fcrer.jpg|St. Christopher, [[engraving]], 1521\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - The Small Horse - Google Art Project.jpg|''The Small Horse''\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Nemesis - Google Art Project.jpg|''Nemesis''\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Bearded Saint in a Forest, c. 1516 - Google Art Project.jpg|''Bearded Saint in a Forest'', c. 1516\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - The Rhinoceros (NGA 1964.8.697).jpg|''Rhinoceros,'' 1515, [[National Gallery of Art]]\n</gallery>\n\n==List of works==\nFor lists of Albrecht D\u00fcrer's works, see:\n* [[List of paintings by Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]\n* [[List of engravings by D\u00fcrer]]\n* [[List of woodcuts by D\u00fcrer]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Bartrum, Giulia.

Points are scored by kicking the [[Football (ball)#Australian rules football|oval-shaped ball]] between the goal posts (worth six points) or behind posts (worth one point). If scores are level at the end of finals matches (including the [[grand final]]), [[extra time]] is required to determine the winner.\n\nDuring general play, players may position themselves anywhere on the field and use any part of their bodies to move the ball. The primary methods are [[kick (football)|kicking]], [[handball (Australian rules football)|handballing]] and running with the ball. There are rules on how the ball can be handled: for example, players running with the ball must intermittently [[running bounce|bounce or touch it on the ground]]. Throwing the ball is not allowed and players must not get caught [[holding the ball]]. A distinctive feature of the game is the [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]], where players anywhere on the field who catch the ball from a kick (with specific conditions) are awarded possession.<ref>[http://afl.com.au/Portals/0/2012/AM_6967_0112_AFL_laws.pdf 2012 Laws of the game] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522111034/http://afl.com.au/Portals/0/2012/AM_6967_0112_AFL_laws.pdf |date=22 May 2012 }} Section 14, page 45</ref> Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a [[Free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]] or mark is paid.

Dangerous physical contact (such as [[push in the back|pushing an opponent in the back]]), interference when marking and deliberately slowing the play are discouraged with free kicks, [[50-metre penalty|distance penalties]] or [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]] for a certain number of matches, depending on the seriousness of the infringement. The game features frequent physical contests, [[spectacular mark]]ing, fast movement of both players and the ball and high scoring.\n\nThe [[Origins of Australian football|sport's origins]] can be traced to football matches played in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1858, inspired by [[English public school football games]].

Retrieved 18 June 2013.</ref>]]\nThere is evidence of football being played sporadically in the Australian colonies in the first half of the 19th century. Compared to [[cricket]] and [[horse racing]], football was viewed as a minor \"amusement\" at the time, and while little is known about these early one-off games, it is clear they share no causal link with Australian football.{{sfn|Hess|2008|pp=1\u20133}} In 1858, in a move that would help to shape Australian football in its formative years, public schools in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] began organising football games inspired by [[English public school football games|precedents at English public schools]].{{sfn|Pennings|2012|p=8}} The earliest such match, held in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] on 15 June, was between [[Melbourne Grammar School|Melbourne Grammar]] and St Kilda Grammar.{{sfn|Pennings|2010|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nOn 10 July 1858, the Melbourne-based ''[[Bell's Life in Victoria and Sporting Chronicle]]'' published a letter by [[Tom Wills]], captain of the [[Victoria cricket team]], calling for the formation of a \"foot-ball club\" with a \"code of laws\" to keep cricketers fit during winter.{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=86\u201387}} Born in Australia, Wills played a nascent form of [[rugby football]] whilst a pupil at [[Rugby School]] in England, and returned to his homeland a star athlete and cricketer. His letter is regarded by many historians as giving impetus for the development of a new code of football today known as Australian football.{{sfn|Blainey|2010|pp=19\u201322}} Two weeks later, Wills' friend, cricketer [[James Bryant (Australian cricketer)|Jerry Bryant]], posted an advertisement for a [[scratch match]] at the [[Richmond Paddock]] adjoining the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG).{{sfn|Pennings|2012|p=14}} This was the first of several \"kickabouts\" held that year involving members of the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]], including Wills, Bryant, [[William Hammersley|W. J. Hammersley]] and [[J. B. Thompson]]. Trees were used as goalposts and play typically lasted an entire afternoon. Without an agreed upon code of laws, some players were guided by rules they had learned in the British Isles, \"others by no rules at all\".{{sfn|Blainey|2010|pp=23\u201326}}\n\nAnother significant milestone in 1858 was a match played under experimental rules between Melbourne Grammar and [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]], held at the Richmond Paddock. This 40-a-side contest, umpired by Wills and Scotch College teacher [[John Macadam]], began on 7 August and continued over two subsequent Saturdays, ending in a draw with each side kicking one goal.<ref name=\"piesse\">{{Cite book| author=[[Ken Piesse]]| title=The Complete Guide to Australian Football | publisher=Pan Macmillan Australia | year=1995 | isbn=0-330-35712-3 }} p303.</ref> It is commemorated with a statue outside the MCG, and the two schools have competed annually ever since in the [[Cordner-Eggleston Cup]], the world's [[oldest football competitions|oldest continuous football competition]].<ref>{{cite news |date=4 June 2012 |title=The oldest of school rivals |work=The Weekly Review Stonnington |url=http://www.theweeklyreviewstonnington.com.au/story/286185/the-oldest-of-school-rivals/ |accessdate=19 June 2013 |first=Daniel |last=Paproth |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013042/http://www.theweeklyreviewstonnington.com.au/story/286185/the-oldest-of-school-rivals/ |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSince the early 20th century, it has been suggested that Australian football was derived from the Irish sport of [[Gaelic football]], which was not codified until 1885.<ref>{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Tony |editor-first=Stephen |editor-last=Wagg |title=Myths and Milestones in the History of Sport |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2011 |page=14 |chapter=Chapter 1: National Myths, Imperial Pasts and the Origins of Australian Rules Football |isbn=0-230-24125-5}}</ref> There is no archival evidence in favour of a Gaelic influence, and the style of play shared between the two modern codes was evident in Australia long before the Irish game evolved in a similar direction.{{sfn|Blainey|2010|pp=187\u2013196}}{{sfn|Hibbins|Ruddell|2009|p=8}} Another theory, first proposed in 1983, posits that Wills, having grown up amongst [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] in Victoria, may have seen or played the Aboriginal game of [[Marn Grook]], and incorporated some of its features into early Australian football. The evidence for this is only circumstantial, and according to biographer Greg de Moore's research, Wills was \"almost solely influenced by his experience at Rugby School\".{{sfn|de Moore|2011|pp=322\u2013323}}\n\n===First rules===\n{{further information|Laws of Australian rules football#Melbourne Rules of 1859}}\nA loosely organised Melbourne side, captained by Wills, played against other football enthusiasts in the winter and spring of 1858.{{sfn|Pennings|2011|p=15}} The following year, on 14 May, the [[Melbourne Football Club]] officially came into being, making it one of the world's [[oldest football clubs]]. Three days later, Wills, Hammersley, Thompson and teacher [[Thomas H. Smith]] met near the MCG at the Parade Hotel, owned by Bryant, and drafted ten rules: [[Melbourne rules#Melbourne Rules of 1859|\"The Rules of the Melbourne Football Club\"]]. These are the laws from which Australian football evolved.{{sfn|Pennings|2012|p=11}} The club's stated aim was to create a simple code that was suited to the hard playing surfaces around Melbourne, and to eliminate the roughest aspects of English school games\u2014such as \"hacking\" (shin-kicking) in Rugby School football\u2014to lessen the chance of injuries to working men.{{sfn|Hibbins|Ruddell|pp=14\u201315}} In another significant departure from English public school football, the Melbourne rules omitted any [[offside (sport)|offside law]].{{sfn|Coventry|2015|p=2}} \"The new code was as much a reaction against the school games as influenced by them\", writes Mark Pennings.{{sfn|Pennings|2011|p=9}}\n\nThe rules were distributed throughout the colony; Thompson in particular did much to promote the new code in his capacity as a journalist.{{sfn|Hibbins|Ruddell|2009|p=7}} Australian football's date of codification predates that of any other major football code, including [[association football|soccer]] (codified in 1863) and [[rugby union]] (codified in 1871).\n\n===Early competition in Victoria===\n{{See also|List of Australian rules football clubs by date of establishment}}\n[[File:Australianfootball1866.jpg|thumb|Engraving of a football match at the [[Yarra Park|Richmond Paddock]], 1866. The MCG and its first pavilion are visible in the background, as are kick-off posts, the forerunner of today's behind posts.{{sfn|Hibbins|Ruddell|2009|p=17}}]]\n\nFollowing Melbourne's lead, [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[Melbourne University Football Club|Melbourne University]] also formed football clubs in 1859.{{sfn|Hibbins|Ruddell|2009|pp=10\u201312}} While many early Victorian teams participated in one-off matches, most had not yet formed clubs for regular competition. A [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]] side devised its own rules.{{sfn|Hibbins|Ruddell|2009|p=11}} To ensure the supremacy of the Melbourne rules, the first-club level competition in Australia, the Caledonian Society's [[Challenge Cup (Australia)|Challenge Cup]] (1861\u201364), stipulated that only the Melbourne rules were to be used.{{sfn|Penings|2012|p=25}} This law was reinforced by the Athletic Sports Committee (ASC), which ran a variation of the Challenge Cup in 1865\u201366.{{sfn|Hibbins|Ruddell|2009|p=20}} With input from other clubs, the rules underwent several minor revisions, establishing a uniform code known as \"Victorian rules\".{{sfn|Hibbins|Ruddell|2009|pp=18\u201320}} In 1866, the \"first distinctively Victorian rule\", the [[running bounce]], was formalised at a meeting of club delegates chaired by [[H. C. A.

In Queensland, the state league went into recess for the duration of the war. VFL club University left the league and went into recess due to severe casualties. The WAFL lost two clubs and the SANFL was suspended for one year in 1916 due to heavy club losses. [[The ANZAC Day clash]], the annual game between Essendon and Collingwood on ANZAC Day, is one example of how the war continues to be remembered in the football community.\n\n===Interstate football and the ANFC===\n{{Further information|Interstate matches in Australian rules football}}\n[[File:SCG Aussie Rules 1933.jpg|thumb|left|New South Wales vs. Queensland in the [[1933 Sydney Carnival|1933 Australian Football Carnival]] at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].]]\nThe role of the [[Australian National Football Council]] (ANFC) was primarily to govern the game at a national level and to facilitate interstate representative and club competition. The ANFC ran the [[Championship of Australia]], the first national club competition, which commenced in 1888 and saw clubs from different states compete on an even playing field. Although clubs from other states were at times invited, the final was almost always between the premiers from the two strongest state competitions of the time\u2014South Australia and Victoria\u2014and the majority of matches were played in Adelaide at the request of the [[South Australian National Football League|SAFA/SAFL]]. The last match was played in 1976, with [[North Adelaide Football Club|North Adelaide]] being the last non-Victorian winner in 1972. Between 1976 and 1987, the ANFC, and later the Australian Football Championships (AFC) ran a [[Australian Football Championships Night Series|night series]], which invited clubs and representative sides from around the country to participate in a knock-out tournament parallel to the premiership seasons, which Victorian sides still dominated.\n\nWith the lack of international competition, state representative matches were regarded with great importance. The Australian Football Council co-ordinated regular interstate carnivals, including the [[1908 Melbourne Carnival|Australasian Football Jubilee]], held in Melbourne in 1908 to celebrate the game's semicentenary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianfootball.com/articles/view/A%2Bfalse%2Bdawn%2B-%2B1908%2BMelbourne%2BCarnival%253A%2BNew%2BZealand%2Bv%2BNew%2BSouth%2BWales/57|title=A False Dawn |publisher=AustralianFootball.com |date=20 August 1908 |accessdate=19 February 2010 }}</ref> Due in part to the VFL poaching talent from other states, Victoria dominated interstate matches for three quarters of a century. [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football#State of origin|State of Origin]] rules, introduced in 1977, stipulated that rather than representing the state of their adopted club, players would return to play for the state they were first recruited in. This instantly broke Victoria's stranglehold over state titles and Western Australia and South Australia began to win more of their games against Victoria. Both New South Wales and Tasmania scored surprise victories at home against Victoria in 1990.\n\n===Towards a national competition===\n[[File:The teams line up for the national anthem, 2005 AFL Grand Final.jpg|thumb|The [[West Coast Eagles]] and [[Sydney Swans]] line up for the [[Advance Australia Fair|national anthem]] at the [[2005 AFL Grand Final]].

In the late 1980s, due to the poor financial standing of many of the Victorian clubs, and a similar situation existing in Western Australia in the sport, the VFL pursued a more national competition. Two more non-Victorian clubs, [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]] and [[Brisbane Bears Football Club|Brisbane]], joined the league in 1987.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=342}} In their early years, the Sydney and Brisbane clubs struggled both on and off-field because the substantial TV revenues they generated by playing on a Sunday went to the VFL. To protect these revenues the VFL granted significant draft concessions and financial aid to keep the expansion clubs competitive. Each club was required to pay a licence fee which allowed the Victorian-based clubs to survive.\n\nThe VFL changed its name to the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) for the [[1990 AFL season|1990 season]], and over the next decade, three non-Victorian clubs gained entry: [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]] (1991), [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] (1995) and the SANFL's [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] (1997), the only pre-existing club outside Victoria to join the league.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=342}} In 2011 and 2012 respectively, two new non-Victorian clubs were added to the competition: [[Gold Coast Football Club|Gold Coast]] and [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|Greater Western Sydney]].{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=341}} The AFL, currently with 18 member clubs, is the sport's elite competition and most powerful body. Following the emergence of the AFL, state leagues were quickly relegated to a second-tier status. The VFA merged with the former VFL reserves competition in 1998, adopting the VFL name. State of Origin also declined in importance, especially after an increasing number of player withdrawals. The AFL turned its focus to the annual [[International Rules Series]] against Ireland in 1998 before abolishing State of Origin the following year. State and territorial leagues still contest interstate matches, as do AFL Women players.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2017-07-25/big-names-locked-in-for-aflw-state-of-origin Big names locked in for AFLW state of origin].

The field, like the ball, is oval-shaped, and in Australia, [[cricket ground]]s are often used. No more than 18 players of each team are permitted to be on the field at any time.\n\nUp to four [[Interchange (Australian rules football)|interchange]] (reserve) players may be swapped for those on the field at any time during the game. In [[Glossary of Australian rules football|Australian rules terminology]], these players wait for substitution \"on the bench\"\u2014an area with a row of seats on the sideline. Players must interchange through a designated interchange \"gate\" with strict penalties for too many players from one team on the field. In addition, some leagues have each team designate one player as a substitute who can be used to make a single permanent exchange of players during a game.\n\nThere is no [[offside (sport)|offside rule]] nor are there set positions in the rules; unlike many other forms of football, players from both teams may disperse across the whole field before the start of play. However, a typical on-field structure consists of six [[Australian rules football positions#Full forward|forwards]], six [[Fullback (Australian rules football)|defenders]] or \"backmen\" and six [[Midfielder (Australian Rules)|midfielders]], usually two [[Centre line (football)|wingmen]], one [[Centre line (football)|centre]] and three [[Follower (Australian rules football)|followers]], including a [[Ruckman (Australian rules football position)|ruckman]], [[Follower (Australian rules football)|ruck-rover]] and [[Follower (Australian rules football)|rover]]. Only four players from each team are allowed within the centre square ({{convert|50|m|yd}}) at every centre bounce, which occurs at the commencement of each quarter, and to restart the game after a goal is scored. There are also other rules pertaining to allowed player positions during set plays (that is, after a mark or free kick) and during kick-ins following the scoring of a behind.\n\n===Match duration===\nA game consists of four quarters and a timekeeper officiates their duration.  At the professional level, each quarter consists of 20 minutes of play, with the clock being stopped for instances such as scores, the ball going out of bounds or at the umpire's discretion, e.g. for serious injury. Lower grades of competition might employ shorter quarters of play. The umpire signals ''time-off'' to stop the clock for various reasons, such as the player in possession being tackled into stagnant play. Time resumes when the umpire signals ''time-on'' or when the ball is brought into play. Stoppages cause quarters to extend approximately 5\u201310 minutes beyond the 20 minutes of play.  6 minutes of rest is allowed before the second and fourth quarters, and 20 minutes of rest is allowed at ''half-time''.\n\nThe official game clock is available only to the timekeeper(s), and is not displayed to the players, umpires or spectators. The only public knowledge of game time is when the timekeeper sounds a siren at the start and end of each quarter. Coaching staff may monitor the game time themselves and convey information to players via on-field trainers or substitute players. Broadcasters usually display an approximation of the official game time for television audiences, although some will now show the exact time remaining in a quarter.\n\n===General play===\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=300\n| image1 = Neville Jetta 2017.4.jpg  |width1=157|height1=\n| image2 = John Coleman mark 1950.jpg  |width2=143|height2=\n| image3 = Aussie rules kicking.jpg  |width3=177|height3=\n| image4 = Houli tackling Blar (cropped).jpg|width4=123|height4=\n| footer = Some of the important skills of Australian football.

Before the game, the winner of a [[coin toss]] determines which directions the teams will play to begin. Australian football begins after the first [[siren (alarm)|siren]], when the umpire [[Ball-up|bounces the ball on the ground]] (or throws it into the air if the condition of the ground is poor), and the two [[Ruckman (Australian rules football position)|ruckmen]] (typically the tallest players from each team) battle for the ball in the air on its way back down. This is known as the ''ball-up''. Certain disputes during play may also be settled with a ''ball-up'' from the point of contention. If the ball is kicked or hit from a ball-up or boundary throw-in over the boundary line or into a behind post without the ball bouncing, a free kick is paid for [[Out of bounds#Australian rules football|out of bounds on the full]]. A free kick is also paid if the ball is deemed by the umpire to have been [[Deliberate out of bounds|deliberately carried or directed out of bounds]]. If the ball travels out of bounds in any other circumstances (for example, contested play results in the ball being knocked out of bounds) a boundary umpire will stand with his back to the infield and return the ball into play with a ''throw-in'', a high backwards toss back into the field of play.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.aflcommunityclub.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Coach_AFL/2017_Laws_of_Australian_Football.pdf |title=Laws of Australian Football 2017 |publisher=Australian Football League |year=2017 |page=51 |chapter=15.7 Free Kicks \u2013 Relating to Out of Bounds |access-date=22 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ball can be propelled in any direction by way of a foot, clenched fist (called a [[handball (Australian rules football)|handball]] or ''handpass'') or open-hand tap but it cannot be thrown under any circumstances. Once a player takes possession of the ball he must dispose of it by either kicking or handballing it. Any other method of disposal is illegal and will result in a [[Free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]] to the opposing team. This is usually called \"incorrect disposal\", \"dropping the ball\" or \"throwing\". If the ball is not in the possession of one player it can be moved on with any part of the body.\n\nA player may run with the ball, but it must be [[Running bounce|bounced or touched on the ground]] at least once every 15&nbsp;metres. Opposition players may [[Shepherding (Australian rules football)|bump]] or [[tackle (football move)|tackle]] the player to obtain the ball and, when tackled, the player must dispose of the ball cleanly or risk being penalised for [[holding the ball]]. The ball carrier may only be tackled between the shoulders and knees. If the opposition player forcefully contacts a player in the back while performing a tackle, the opposition player will be penalised for a [[push in the back]]. If the opposition tackles the player with possession below the knees (a ''low tackle'' or a ''trip'') or above the shoulders (a ''high tackle''), the team with possession of the football gets a free kick.\n\nIf a player takes possession of the ball that has travelled more than {{convert|15|m|yd}} from another player's kick, by way of a catch, it is claimed as a ''[[mark (Australian football)|mark]]'' (meaning that the game stops while he prepares to kick from the point at which he marked). Alternatively, he may choose to \"play on\" forfeiting the set shot in the hope of pressing an advantage for his team (rather than allowing the opposition to reposition while he prepares for the free kick). Once a player has chosen to play on, normal play resumes and the player who took the mark is again able to be tackled.\n\nThere are different [[kick (football)|styles of kicking]] depending on how the ball is held in the hand. The most common style of kicking seen in today's game, principally because of its superior accuracy, is the [[drop punt]], where the ball is dropped from the hands down, almost to the ground, to be kicked so that the ball rotates in a reverse end over end motion as it travels through the air. Other commonly used kicks are the [[torpedo punt]] (also known as the spiral, barrel, or screw punt), where the ball is held flatter at an angle across the body, which makes the ball spin around its long axis in the air, resulting in extra distance (similar to the traditional motion of an [[Punt (gridiron football)|American football punt]]), and the [[checkside punt]] or \"banana\", kicked across the ball with the outside of the foot used to curve the ball (towards the right if kicked off the right foot) towards targets that are on an angle. There is also the \"snap\", which is almost the same as a checkside punt except that it is kicked off the inside of the foot and curves in the opposite direction. It is also possible to kick the ball so that it bounces along the ground. This is known as a \"grubber\". Grubbers can bounce in a straight line, or curve to the left or right.\n\nApart from free kicks, marks or when the ball is in the possession of an umpire for a ''ball up'' or ''throw in'', the ball is always in dispute and any player from either side can take possession of the ball.\n\n===Scoring===\n[[File:Sherrin Kangaroo Brand.jpg|thumb|A [[Sherrin]] Kangaroo Brand [[Football (ball)#Australian rules football|football]]. Sherrin is the official game ball of the Australian Football League.]]\n[[File:AFL-Goalposts.jpg|thumb|The two tall central posts are the goal posts, and the two shorter outer posts are the behind posts.]]\nA ''goal'', worth 6 points, is scored when the football is propelled through the goal posts at any height (including above the height of the posts) by way of a kick from the attacking team. It may fly through \"on the full\" (without touching the ground) or bounce through, but must not have been touched, on the way, by any player from either team or a goalpost. A goal cannot be scored from the foot of an opposition (defending) player.\n\nA ''behind'', worth 1 point, is scored when the ball passes between a goal post and a behind post at any height, or if the ball hits a goal post, or if any player sends the ball between the goal posts by touching it with any part of the body other than a foot. A behind is also awarded to the attacking team if the ball touches any part of an opposition player, including a foot, before passing between the goal posts. When an opposition player deliberately scores a behind for the attacking team (generally as a last resort to ensure that a goal is not scored) this is termed a [[rushed behind]]. As of the [[2009 AFL season]], a free kick is awarded against any player who deliberately rushes a behind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/breaking-news/afl-rules-on-deliberate-rushed-behinds/story-e6frf33c-1111118325150|title=AFL rules on deliberate rushed behinds|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/all-clear-for-rushed-behind-rule/story-e6frf9jf-1225700531493|title=All clear for rushed behind rule - Herald Sun<!-- Bot generated title -->|author=|date=|website=heraldsun.com.au}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Umpire (Australian rules football)|goal umpire]] signals a goal with two hands pointed forward at elbow height, or a behind with one hand. The goal umpire then waves flags above their heads to communicate this information to the goal umpire at the opposite end of the ground.\n\nThe team that has scored the most points at the end of play wins the game. If the scores are level on points at the end of play, then the game is a draw; extra time applies only during finals matches in some competitions.\n\nAs an example of a score report, consider a match between {{AFL Ess}} and {{AFL Mel}} with the former as the home team. Essendon's score of 11 goals and 14 behinds equates to 80 points. Melbourne's score of 10 goals and 7 behinds equates to a 67-point tally. Essendon wins the match by a margin of 13 points.

The premiership is always decided by a ''finals series''. The teams that occupy the highest positions on the ''ladder'' after the ''home-and-away'' season play off in a \"semi-knockout\" finals series, culminating in a single [[Grand Final]] match to determine the premiers. Typically between four and eight teams contest the finals series. The team which finishes first on the ladder after the home-and-away season is referred to as a \"[[minor premier]]\", but this usually holds little stand-alone significance, other than receiving a better draw in the finals.\n\nMany suburban and amateur leagues have a sufficient number of teams to be played across several tiered divisions, with [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] of the lower division premiers and [[promotion and relegation|relegation]] of the upper division's last placed team at the end of each year.

Irishmen in the AFL have since become not just starters for their clubs but also Brownlow Medalists ([[Jim Stynes]]) and premiership players ([[Tadhg Kennelly]]).

Clement Stone]]'s mother bought a small Detroit insurance agency, and in 1918 brought her son into the business. Mr. Stone sold low-cost, low-benefit accident insurance, underwriting and issuing policies on-site. The next year he founded his own agency, the '''Combined Registry Co.'''\n\nAs the [[Great Depression]] began, Stone reduced his workforce and improved training. Forced by his son's respiratory illness to winter in the South, Stone moved to Arkansas and Texas. In 1939 he bought [[American Casualty Insurance Co.]] of Dallas, Texas. It was consolidated with other purchases as the [[Combined Insurance|Combined Insurance Co. of America]] in 1947. The company continued through the 1950s and 1960s, continuing to sell health and accident policies. In the 1970s, Combined expanded overseas despite being hit hard by the recession.\n\nIn 1982, after 10 years of stagnation under Clement Stone Jr., the elder Stone, then 79, resumed control until the completion of a [[merger]] with '''Ryan Insurance Co.''' allowed him to transfer control to [[Pat Ryan (executive)|Patrick Ryan]]. Ryan, the son of a Ford dealer in Wisconsin, had started his company as an auto credit insurer in 1964. In 1976, the company bought the insurance brokerage units of the [[Esmark]] conglomerate. Ryan focused on insurance brokering and added more upscale insurance products. He also trimmed staff and took other cost-cutting measures, and in 1987 he changed Combined's name to '''Aon'''. In 1992, he bought Dutch insurance broker '''Hudig-Langeveldt'''. In 1995, the company sold its remaining direct life insurance holdings to [[Genworth Financial|General Electric]] to focus on consulting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/27/business/ge-capital-to-acquire-an-insurer.html|title=GE Capital To Acquire An Insurer|date=27 December 1995|work=The New York Times|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102220859/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/27/business/ge-capital-to-acquire-an-insurer.html|archivedate=2 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The following year, it began offering hostile takeover insurance policies to small and mid-sized companies.\n\nAon built a global presence through purchases. In 1997, it bought The Minet Group, as well as insurance brokerage Alexander & Alexander Services, Inc. in a deal that made Aon (temporarily) the largest insurance broker worldwide. The firm made no US buys in 1998, but doubled its employee base with purchases including Spain's largest retail insurance broker, Gil y Carvajal, and the formation of Aon Korea, the first non-Korean firm of its kind{{clarify|date=June 2010}} to be licensed there.\n\nResponding to industry demands, Aon announced its new fee disclosure policy in 1999, and the company reorganised to focus on buying personal line insurance firms and to integrate its acquisitions. That year it bought Nikols Sedgwick Group, an Italian insurance firm, and formed RiskAttack (with [[Zurich Financial Services|Zurich US]]), a risk analysis and financial management concern aimed at technology companies. The cost of integrating its numerous purchases, however, hammered profits in 1999.\n\nDespite its troubles, in 2000 Aon bought Reliance Group's accident and health insurance business, as well as Actuarial Sciences Associates, a compensation and employee benefits consulting company. Later in that year, however, the company decided to cut 6% of its workforce as part of a restructuring effort. In 2003, the company saw revenues increase primarily because of rate hikes in the insurance industry. Also that year, Endurance Specialty, a Bermuda-based underwriting operation that Aon helped to establish in November 2001 along with other investors, went public. The next year Aon sold most of its holdings in Endurance.\n\nIn late 2007, Aon announced the divestiture of its underwriting business. With this move, the firm sold off its two major underwriting subsidiaries: Combined Insurance Company of America (acquired by ACE Limited for $2.4 billion) and Sterling Life Insurance Company (purchased by Munich Re Group for $352 million).

At issue was the practice of insurance companies' payments to brokers (known as contingent commissions). The payments were thought to bring a conflict of interest, swaying broker decisions on behalf of carriers, rather than customers.

The Authority did not find that any money had actually made its way to illegal organisations. Aon qualified for a 30% discount on the fine as a result of its co-operation with the investigation. Aon said its conduct was not deliberate, adding it had since \"significantly strengthened and enhanced its controls around the usage of third parties\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ifaonline.co.uk/ifaonline/news/1348483/aon-hit-record-fsa-fine?page=ifa2006_articleimport&tempPageName=833667 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725195637/http://www.ifaonline.co.uk/ifaonline/news/1348483/aon-hit-record-fsa-fine?page=ifa2006_articleimport&tempPageName=833667 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 July 2011 |title=Aon hit with record FSA fine |publisher=Ifaonline.co.uk |author=Scott Sinclair |date=8 January 2009 |accessdate=23 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations===\nIn December 2011, Aon Corporation paid a $16.26 million penalty to the [[US Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and the [[US Department of Justice]] (DOJ) for violations of the US [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA).<ref>{{cite press release| url=http://www.fbi.gov/washingtondc/press-releases/2011/aon-corporation-agrees-to-pay-a-1.76-million-criminal-penalty-to-resolve-violations-of-the-foreign-corrupt-practices-act| title=Aon Pays $1.76 Million Criminal Penalty| author=The FBI| publisher=The FBI| date=20 December 2011| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510003229/http://www.fbi.gov/washingtondc/press-releases/2011/aon-corporation-agrees-to-pay-a-1.76-million-criminal-penalty-to-resolve-violations-of-the-foreign-corrupt-practices-act| archivedate=10 May 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nAccording to the SEC, Aon's subsidiaries made improper payments of over $3.6 million to government officials and third-party facilitators in [[Costa Rica]], [[Egypt]], [[Vietnam]], [[Indonesia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Myanmar]] and [[Bangladesh]], between 1983 and 2007, to obtain and retain insurance contracts.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22203.htm\n |title       = SEC Files Settled FCPA Charges Against AON Corporation\n |author      = US Securities and Exchange Commission\n |publisher   = US Securities and Exchange Commission\n |date        = 20 December 2011\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170531054322/https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22203.htm\n |archivedate = 31 May 2017\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n===Major acquisitions===\nOn 22 August 2008, Aon announced that it had acquired London-based [[Benfield Group]].

With Marie Scheuchl, a maid fifteen years his senior in the Berg family household, he fathered a daughter, Albine, born December 4, 1902.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19739582|title=The Berg Companion|last=Jarman|first=Douglas|date=1990|publisher=Northeastern University Press|others=|year=|isbn=1555530680|location=Boston|pages=190|oclc=19739582}}</ref>[[File:Alban Berg (1885\u20131935) 1909 (Detail) \u00a9 Madame d\u2019Ora (1881\u20131963) Albertina FotoGLV2000-7689.png|left|thumb|Portrait of Alban Berg, 1909]]\n\nBerg had little formal music education before he became a student of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] in October 1904. With Schoenberg, he studied [[counterpoint]], [[music theory]], and [[harmony]].<ref>Schoenberg, Arnold. Trans.

His student compositions included five drafts for [[piano sonata]]s. He also wrote songs, including his ''[[Seven Early Songs (Berg)|Seven Early Songs]]'' (''Sieben Fr\u00fche Lieder''), three of which were Berg's first publicly performed work in a concert that featured the music of Schoenberg's pupils in Vienna that year.{{cn|date=February 2018}} \n\nThe early sonata sketches eventually culminated in Berg's [[Piano Sonata (Berg)|Piano Sonata]], [[opus number|Op]]. 1 (1907\u20131908); it is one of the most formidable \"first\" works ever written.<ref>Lauder (1986)</ref> Berg studied with Schoenberg for six years until 1911. Among Schoenberg's teaching was the idea that the unity of a musical composition depends upon all its aspects being derived from a single basic idea; this idea was later known as ''developing variation''. Berg passed this on to his students, one of whom, [[Theodor W. Adorno]], stated: \"The main principle he conveyed was that of variation: everything was supposed to [[Musical development|develop]] out of something else and yet be intrinsically different\".<ref>Adorno, p. 33</ref> The Piano Sonata is an example\u2014the whole composition is derived from the work's opening [[quartal and quintal harmony|quartal]] gesture and its opening phrase.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mariinsky-theatre.com/company/other/composer/Alban_Berg/|title=Alban Berg - Composer -  MariinskyKirov.com|website=www.mariinsky-theatre.com|access-date=2018-10-02}}</ref>\n\n===Innovation===\nBerg was a part of Vienna's cultural elite during the heady ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' period. His circle included the musicians [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]] and [[Franz Schreker]], the painter [[Gustav Klimt]], the writer and satirist [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], the architect [[Adolf Loos]], and the poet [[Peter Altenberg]]. \n\nIn 1906, Berg met the singer Helene Nahowski, daughter of a wealthy family (said by some to be in fact the illegitimate daughter of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] from his liaison with [[Anna Nahowski]]);<ref>Georg Markus, ''Der Kaiser Franz Joseph I.: Bilder und Dokumente''; Anna Nahowski and Friedrich Saathen, ''Anna Nahowski und Kaiser Franz Joseph : Aufzeichnungen/erstmalig herausgegeben und kommentiert von Friedrich Saathen'', B\u00f6hlau, 1986.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> despite the outward hostility of her family, the two were married on May 3, 1911.\n[[File:Watschenkonzert Karikatur in Die Zeit vom 6. April 1913.jpg|thumb|''Watschenkonzert'', caricature in ''Die Zeit'', April 6, 1913]]\nIn 1913, two of Berg's ''[[Altenberg Lieder]]'' (1912) were premi\u00e8red in Vienna, [[conducting|conducted]] by Schoenberg in the infamous ''[[Skandalkonzert]]''. Settings of aphoristic poetic utterances, the songs are accompanied by a very large orchestra. The performance caused a riot, and had to be halted. He effectively withdrew the work, and it was not performed in full until 1952. The full score remained unpublished until 1966.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/261177783|title=Music in the Early Twentieth Century|last=Taruskin|first=Richard|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=0195384849|location=New York|pages=196|oclc=261177783}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1915\u201318, Berg served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] and during a period of leave in 1917, he accelerated work on his first [[opera]], ''[[Wozzeck]]''. After the end of [[World War I]], he settled again in Vienna, where he taught private pupils. He also helped Schoenberg run his [[Society for Private Musical Performances]], which sought to create the ideal environment for the exploration and appreciation of unfamiliar new music by means of open rehearsals, repeat performances, and the exclusion of professional critics.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\nBerg had a particular interest in the number 23, using it to structure several works.  Various suggestions have been made as to the reason for this interest: that he took it from the [[biorhythms]] theory of [[Wilhelm Fliess]], in which a 23-day cycle is considered significant,<ref>Jarman, D. (1983). [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/962034?uid=3738032&uid=373072751&uid=2&uid=3&uid=60&sid=21102523353593 Alban Berg, Wilhelm Fliess and the Secret Programme of the Violin Concerto].

Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 228\u201330.</ref>\n\n===Success of ''Wozzeck'' and inception of ''Lulu'' (1924\u201329)===\nIn 1924, three excerpts from ''Wozzeck'' were performed, which brought Berg his first public success. The opera, which Berg completed in 1922, was first performed on December 14, 1925, when [[Erich Kleiber]] conducted the first performance in [[Berlin]]. Today, ''Wozzeck'' is seen as one of the century's most important works. Berg made a start on his second opera, the three-act ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', in 1928 but interrupted the work in 1929 for the concert aria ''Der Wein'' which he completed that summer. ''Der Wein'' presaged ''Lulu'' in a number of ways, including vocal style, orchestration, design and text.{{sfn|Elliott|2014|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qrkTAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA55 p. 55]}}\n\nOther well-known Berg compositions include the ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'' (1926), which was later shown to employ elaborate cyphers to document a secret love affair; the post-Mahlerian ''Three Pieces for Orchestra'' (completed in 1915 but not performed until after ''Wozzeck''); and the [[Kammerkonzert (Berg)|Chamber Concerto]] (''Kammerkonzert'', 1923\u201325) for violin, piano, and 13 wind instruments: this latter is written so conscientiously that Pierre Boulez has called it \"Berg's strictest composition\" and it, too, is permeated by cyphers and posthumously disclosed hidden programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musopen.org/fr/education/instrument/piano/great-composers/20th-century-composers/alban-berg/|title=Alban Berg|website=musopen.org|language=fr|access-date=2018-08-23}}</ref>\n\n===Final years (1930\u201335)===\nLife for the musical world was becoming increasingly difficult in the 1930s both in Vienna and Germany due to the rising tide of [[antisemitism]] and the [[Nazi]] cultural ideology that denounced [[modernity]]. Even to have an association with someone who was Jewish could lead to denunciation, and Berg's \"crime\" was to have studied with the Jewish composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. Berg found that opportunities for his work to be performed in Germany were becoming rare, and eventually his music was [[proscribed]] and placed on the list of [[degenerate music]].{{sfn|Notley|2010}} \n\nIn 1932, Berg and his wife acquired an isolated lodge, the ''Waldhaus'' on the southern shore of the [[W\u00f6rthersee]], near [[Schiefling am See]] in [[Carinthia]], where he was able to work in seclusion, mainly on ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' and the [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]].{{sfn|Hailey|2010a}} At the end of 1934, Berg became involved in the political intrigues around finding a replacement for [[Clemens Krauss]] as director of the [[Vienna State Opera]]. \n\nAs more of the performances of his work in Germany were cancelled by the [[Nazis]], who had come to power in early 1933, he needed to ensure the new director would be an advocate for modernist music. Originally, the premiere of ''Lulu'' had been planned for the [[Berlin State Opera]], where [[Erich Kleiber]] continued to champion his music and had conducted the premiere of ''Wozzeck'' in 1925, but now this was looking increasingly uncertain, and ''Lulu'' was rejected by the Berlin authorities in the spring of 1934. Kleiber's production of the ''Lulu'' symphonic suite on 30 November 1934 in Berlin was also the occasion of his resignation in protest at the extent of conflation of culture with politics. Even in Vienna, the opportunities for the Vienna School of musicians was dwindling.{{sfn|Notley|2010}}\n\nBerg had interrupted the orchestration of ''Lulu'' because of an unexpected (and financially much-needed) commission from the Russian-American violinist [[Louis Krasner]] for a [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] (1935). This profoundly elegiac work, composed at unaccustomed speed and posthumously premi\u00e8red, has become Berg's best-known and most-beloved composition.{{cn|date=February 2018}} Like much of his mature work, it employs an idiosyncratic adaptation of Schoenberg's \"dodecaphonic\" or [[twelve-tone technique]], that enables the composer to produce passages openly evoking tonality, including quotations from historical tonal music, such as a [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] chorale and a [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthian]] folk song. The Violin Concerto was dedicated \"to the memory of an Angel\", [[Manon Gropius]], the deceased daughter of architect [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Alma Mahler]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22314162|title=Berg: Violin Concerto|last=Pople|first=Anthony|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=0521399769|location=Cambridge|pages=28|oclc=22314162}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nBerg died aged 50 in Vienna, on Christmas Eve 1935, from [[blood poisoning]] apparently caused by a [[carbuncle]] on his back induced by an insect sting that occurred in November.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Alban Berg|url=http://www.musicacademyonline.com/composer/biographies.php?bid=24|website=musicacademyonline.com|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nBefore he died, Berg had completed the orchestration of only the first two of the three acts of ''Lulu''. These completed acts were successfully premi\u00e8red in Z\u00fcrich in 1937, but for personal reasons Helene Berg subsequently imposed a ban on any attempt to \"complete\" the final act, which Berg had in fact completed in [[short score]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21226688|title=Alban Berg: Lulu|last=Jarman|first=Douglas|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=0521284805|location=Cambridge [England]|pages=46|oclc=21226688}}</ref> An orchestration was therefore commissioned in secret from [[Friedrich Cerha]] and premi\u00e8red in Paris (under [[Pierre Boulez]]) only in 1979, soon after Helene Berg's own death. The complete opera has rapidly entered the repertoire as one of the landmarks of contemporary music and, like ''Wozzeck'', remains a consistent audience draw.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Alban Berg Bueste Schiefling 01.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Alban Berg at Schiefling on the lake, [[Klagenfurt-Land District]], Carinthia, Austria]]\nBerg is remembered as one of the most important composers of the 20th century and the most widely performed opera composer among the Second Viennese School.<ref name=\"Jarman, Grove\">Jarman, Grove</ref>  He is said to have brought more \"human values\" to the [[Twelve-Tone System|twelve-tone system]], his works seen as more \"emotional\" than Schoenberg's.<ref>The Complete Book of 20th Century Music, p. 20, by David Ewen, Prentice-Hall Inc. 1963.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref> Critically, he is seen as having preserved the Viennese tradition in his music.<ref>The Grove Encyclopedia of Music and Musicians, p. 638, St. Martin's Press, Inc. 1961</ref>{{Verify source|date=September 2011}}<!--OCLC WorldCat fails to discover this title.

Then qualitative and quantitative analysis can be performed, often with the same instrument and may use [[spectroscopy|light interaction]],  [[thermodynamics|heat interaction]], [[electrochemistry|electric fields]] or [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|magnetic fields]]. Often the same instrument can separate, identify and quantify an analyte.\n\nAnalytical chemistry is also focused on improvements in [[experimental design]], [[chemometrics]], and the creation of new measurement tools.

During this period significant contributions to analytical chemistry include the development of systematic [[elemental analysis]] by [[Justus von Liebig]] and systematized organic analysis based on the specific reactions of functional groups.\n\nThe first instrumental analysis was flame emissive spectrometry developed by [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] who discovered [[rubidium]] (Rb) and [[caesium]] (Cs) in 1860.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Arikawa|first=Yoshiko|title=Basic Education in Analytical Chemistry|journal=Analytical Sciences|year=2001|volume=17|issue=Supplement|pages=i571\u2013i573|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/analscisp/17icas/0/17icas_0_i571/_pdf|accessdate=10 January 2014|publisher=The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry|format=pdf}}</ref>\n\nMost of the major developments in analytical chemistry take place after 1900. During this period instrumental analysis becomes progressively dominant in the field. In particular many of the basic spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques were discovered in the early 20th century and refined in the late 20th century.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0039-9140(99)00358-6 |title=Review of analytical measurements facilitated by drop formation technology |year=2000 |last1=Miller |first1=K |journal=Talanta |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=921\u201333 |pmid=18967924 |last2=Synovec |first2=RE}}</ref>\n\nThe [[separation processes|separation sciences]] follow a similar time line of development and also become increasingly transformed into high performance instruments.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0165-9936(02)00806-3 |title=History of gas chromatography |year=2002 |last1=Bartle |first1=Keith D. |last2=Myers |first2=Peter |journal=TrAC Trends in Analytical Chemistry |volume=21 |issue=9\u201310 |pages=547}}</ref> In the 1970s many of these techniques began to be used together as hybrid techniques to achieve a complete characterization of samples.\n\nStarting in approximately the 1970s into the present day analytical chemistry has progressively become more inclusive of biological questions (bioanalytical chemistry), whereas it had previously been largely focused on inorganic or [[Small molecule|small organic molecules]]. Lasers have been increasingly used in chemistry as probes and even to initiate and influence a wide variety of reactions. The late 20th century also saw an expansion of the application of analytical chemistry from somewhat academic chemical questions to [[Forensic chemistry|forensic]], [[Environmental chemistry|environmental]], [[Chemical industry|industrial]] and [[clinical chemistry|medical]] questions, such as in [[histology]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0039-9140(89)80077-3 |title=History of analytical chemistry in the U.S.A |year=1989 |last1=Laitinen |first1=H.A. |journal=Talanta |volume=36 |pages=1\u20139 |pmid=18964671 |issue=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nModern analytical chemistry is dominated by instrumental analysis. Many analytical chemists focus on a single type of instrument. Academics tend to either focus on new applications and discoveries or on new methods of analysis. The discovery of a chemical present in blood that increases the risk of cancer would be a discovery that an analytical chemist might be involved in. An effort to develop a new method might involve the use of a [[tunable laser]] to increase the specificity and sensitivity of a spectrometric method. Many methods, once developed, are kept purposely static so that data can be compared over long periods of time. This is particularly true in industrial [[Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] (QA), forensic and environmental applications. Analytical chemistry plays an increasingly important role in the pharmaceutical industry where, aside from QA, it is used in discovery of new drug candidates and in clinical applications where understanding the interactions between the drug and the patient are critical.\n\n==Classical methods==\n[[File:Flame test.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The presence of [[copper]] in this qualitative analysis is indicated by the bluish-green color of the flame]]\nAlthough modern analytical chemistry is dominated by sophisticated instrumentation, the roots of analytical chemistry and some of the principles used in modern instruments are from traditional techniques, many of which are still used today. These techniques also tend to form the backbone of most undergraduate analytical chemistry educational labs.\n\n===Qualitative analysis===\nA qualitative analysis determines the presence or absence of a particular compound, but not the mass or concentration. By definition, qualitative analyses do not measure quantity.\n\n====Chemical tests====\n{{details|Chemical test}}\nThere are numerous qualitative chemical tests, for example, the [[acid test (gold)|acid test]] for [[gold]] and the [[Kastle-Meyer test]] for the presence of [[blood]].\n\n====Flame test====\n{{details|Flame test}}\nInorganic qualitative analysis generally refers to a systematic scheme to confirm the presence of certain, usually aqueous, ions or elements by performing a series of reactions that eliminate ranges of possibilities and then confirms suspected ions with a confirming test. Sometimes small carbon containing ions are included in such schemes. With modern instrumentation these tests are rarely used but can be useful for educational purposes and in field work or other situations where access to state-of-the-art instruments are not available or expedient.\n\n===Quantitative analysis===\n{{details|Quantitative analysis (chemistry)}}\nQuantitative analysis is the measurement of the quantities of particular chemical constituents present in a substance.\n\n====Gravimetric analysis====\n{{details|Gravimetric analysis}}\nGravimetric analysis involves determining the amount of material present by weighing the sample before and/or after some transformation. A common example used in undergraduate education is the determination of the amount of water in a hydrate by heating the sample to remove the water such that the difference in weight is due to the loss of water.\n\n====Volumetric analysis====\n{{details|Titration}}\nTitration involves the addition of a reactant to a solution being analyzed until some equivalence point is reached. Often the amount of material in the solution being analyzed may be determined. Most familiar to those who have taken chemistry during secondary education is the acid-base titration involving a color changing indicator. There are many other types of titrations, for example potentiometric titrations.\nThese titrations may use different types of indicators to reach some equivalence point.\n\n==Instrumental methods==\n{{Main|Instrumental analysis}}\n[[File:Analytical instrument.png|thumb|right|300 px|Block diagram of an analytical instrument showing the stimulus and measurement of response]]\n\n===Spectroscopy===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2016}}\n{{details|Spectroscopy}}\nSpectroscopy measures the interaction of the molecules with [[electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic radiation]].

Also, mass spectrometry is categorized by approaches of mass analyzers: [[magnetic-sector]], [[quadrupole mass analyzer]], [[quadrupole ion trap]], [[time-of-flight mass spectrometry|time-of-flight]], [[Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance]], and so on.\n\n===Electrochemical analysis===\n{{details|Electroanalytical method}}\nElectroanalytical methods measure the [[electric potential|potential]] ([[volts]]) and/or [[electric current|current]] ([[Ampere|amps]]) in an [[electrochemical cell]] containing the analyte.<ref>Bard, A.J.; Faulkner, L.R.

Also, hybridization with other traditional analytical tools is revolutionizing analytical science.  [[Microscopy]] can be categorized into three different fields: [[optical microscopy]], [[electron microscopy]], and [[scanning probe microscopy]].  Recently, this field is rapidly progressing because of the rapid development of the computer and camera industries.\n\n===Lab-on-a-chip===\n\n{{further|Microfluidics|Lab-on-a-chip}}\nDevices that integrate (multiple) laboratory functions on a single chip of only millimeters to a few square centimeters in size and that are capable of handling extremely small fluid volumes down to less than picoliters.\n\n==Errors==\n{{Main|Approximation error}}\nError can be defined as numerical difference between observed value and true value.<ref>G.L. David - ''Analytical Chemistry''</ref>\n\nIn error the true value and observed value in chemical analysis can be related with each other by the equation\n:<math> \\varepsilon_{\\rm a} = |x - \\bar{x}| </math>\nwhere \n* <math>\\varepsilon_{\\rm a}</math> is the absolute error.\n* <math>x</math> is the true value.\n* <math>\\bar{x}</math> is the observed value.\nError of a measurement is an inverse measure of accurate measurement i.e. smaller the error greater the accuracy of the measurement. \n\nErrors can be expressed relatively. Given the relative error(<math>\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}</math>):\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon_{\\rm r} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\rm a}}{|x|} = \\left | \\frac{x - \\bar{x}}{x} \\right |</math>\n\nThe percent error can also be calculated:\n:<math>\\varepsilon_{\\rm r} \\times 100\\% </math>\n\nIf we want to use these values in a function, we may also want to calculate the error of the function. Let <math>f</math> be a function with <math>N</math> variables.

This allows for determination of the amount of a chemical in a material by comparing the results of unknown sample to those of a series of known standards. If the concentration of element or compound in a sample is too high for the detection range of the technique, it can simply be diluted in a pure solvent. If the amount in the sample is below an instrument's range of measurement, the method of addition can be used. In this method a known quantity of the element or compound under study is added, and the difference between the concentration added, and the concentration observed is the amount actually in the sample.\n\n===Internal standards===\nSometimes an [[internal standard]] is added at a known concentration directly to an analytical sample to aid in quantitation. The amount of analyte present is then determined relative to the internal standard as a calibrant. An ideal internal standard is isotopically-enriched analyte which gives rise to the method of [[isotope dilution]].\n\n===Standard addition===\nThe method of [[standard addition]] is used in instrumental analysis to determine concentration of a substance ([[analyte]]) in an unknown sample by comparison to a set of samples of known concentration, similar to using a [[calibration curve]]. Standard addition can be applied to most analytical techniques and is used instead of a [[calibration curve]] to solve the [[matrix effect]] problem.\n\n==Signals and noise==\nOne of the most important components of analytical chemistry is maximizing the desired signal while minimizing the associated [[Noise (electronics)|noise]].<ref name=\"isbn0-495-01201-7\">{{cite book |author1=Crouch, Stanley |author2=Skoog, Douglas A. |title=Principles of instrumental analysis |publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |location=Australia |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-495-01201-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}</ref> The analytical figure of merit is known as the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (S/N or SNR).\n\nNoise can arise from environmental factors as well as from fundamental physical processes.\n\n===Thermal noise===\n{{Main|Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise}}\nThermal noise results from the motion of charge carriers (usually electrons) in an electrical circuit generated by their thermal motion. Thermal noise is [[white noise]] meaning that the power [[spectral density]] is constant throughout the [[frequency spectrum]].\n\nThe [[root mean square]] value of the thermal noise in a resistor is given by<ref name=\"isbn0-495-01201-7\" />\n\n:<math>v_{\\rm RMS} = \\sqrt { 4 k_{\\rm B} T R \\Delta f },</math>\n\nwhere ''k''<sub>B</sub> is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T'' is the [[temperature]], ''R'' is the resistance, and <math>\\Delta f</math> is the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the frequency <math> f</math>.\n\n===Shot noise===\n{{Main|Shot noise}}\nShot noise is a type of [[electronic noise]] that occurs when the finite number of particles (such as [[electron]]s in an electronic circuit or [[photon]]s in an optical device) is small enough to give rise to statistical fluctuations in a signal.\n\nShot noise is a [[Poisson process]] and the charge carriers that make up the current follow a [[Poisson distribution]].  The root mean square current fluctuation is given by<ref name=\"isbn0-495-01201-7\" />\n\n:<math>i_{\\rm RMS} = \\sqrt{2 e I\\Delta f}</math>\n\nwhere ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]] and ''I'' is the average current. Shot noise is white noise.\n\n===Flicker noise===\n{{Main|flicker noise}}\nFlicker noise is electronic noise with a 1/''\u0192'' frequency spectrum; as ''f'' increases, the noise decreases. Flicker noise arises from a variety of sources, such as impurities in a conductive channel, generation and [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]] noise in a [[transistor]] due to base current, and so on. This noise can be avoided by [[modulation]] of the signal at a higher frequency, for example through the use of a [[lock-in amplifier]].\n\n===Environmental noise===\n[[File:Analyse thermo gravimetrique bruit.png|thumb|right|200 px|Noise in a [[thermogravimetric analysis]]; lower noise in the middle of the plot results from less human activity (and environmental noise) at night]]\n[[Environmental noise]] arises from the surroundings of the analytical instrument.

Advances in design of diode lasers and optical parametric oscillators promote developments in fluorescence and ionization spectrometry and also in absorption techniques where uses of optical cavities for increased effective absorption pathlength are expected to expand. The use of  plasma- and laser-based methods is increasing. An interest towards absolute (standardless) analysis has revived, particularly in   emission spectrometry.{{citation needed |date=March 2013}}\n\nGreat effort is being put in shrinking the analysis techniques to [[Integrated circuit|chip]] size.  Although there are few examples of such systems competitive with traditional analysis techniques, potential advantages include size/portability, speed, and cost. (micro [[total analysis system]] (\u00b5TAS) or [[lab-on-a-chip]]). [[Microscale chemistry]] reduces the amounts of chemicals used.\n\nMany developments  improve the analysis of  biological systems.  Examples of rapidly expanding fields in this area are [[genomics]], [[DNA sequencing]] and related research in [[genetic fingerprinting]] and [[DNA microarray]]; [[proteomics]], the analysis of protein concentrations and modifications, especially in response to various stressors, at various developmental stages, or in various parts of the body, [[metabolomics]], which deals with metabolites; [[transcriptomics]], including mRNA and associated fields; [[lipidomics]] - lipids and its associated fields; [[peptidomics]] - peptides and its associated fields; and [[metalomics]], dealing with metal concentrations and especially with their binding to proteins and other molecules.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAnalytical chemistry has played critical roles in the understanding of basic science to a variety of practical applications, such as biomedical applications, environmental monitoring, quality control of industrial manufacturing, forensic science and so on.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/college-to-career/areas-of-chemistry/analytical-chemistry.html|title=Analytical Chemistry - American Chemical Society|website=American Chemical Society|language=en|access-date=2017-05-26}}</ref>\n\nThe recent developments of computer automation and information technologies have extended analytical chemistry into a number of new biological fields. For example, automated DNA sequencing machines were the basis to complete human genome projects leading to the birth of [[genomics]]. Protein identification and peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry opened a new field of [[proteomics]].\n\nAnalytical chemistry has been an indispensable area in the development of [[nanotechnology]]. Surface characterization instruments, [[electron microscopes]] and scanning probe microscopes enables scientists to visualize atomic structures with chemical characterizations.\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal inline|size=tiny|Analytical chemistry}}\n* [[List of chemical analysis methods]]\n* [[List of materials analysis methods]]\n* [[List of important publications in chemistry#Analytical chemistry|Important publications in analytical chemistry]]\n* [[Sensory analysis]] - in the field of [[Food science]]\n* [[Virtual instrumentation]]\n* [[Working range]]\n* [[Metrology]]\n* [[Measurement uncertainty]]\n* [[Microanalysis]]\n* [[Quality of analytical results]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Skoog, D.A.; West, D.M.; Holler, F.J.

It contrasts with [[cantata]], which is usually accompanied singing. The term \"a cappella\" was originally intended to differentiate between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] [[polyphony]] and [[Baroque (music)|Baroque]] [[concertato]] style. In the 19th century a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music.<ref name=Holmes/> The term is also used, albeit rarely, as a synonym for [[alla breve]].<ref>{{harvnb|Arnold|1998|p=314}}</ref>\n\n==Religious origins==\nA cappella music was originally used in religious music, especially [[church music]] as well as [[anasheed]] and [[zemirot]]. [[Gregorian chant]] is an example of a cappella singing, as is the majority of secular vocal music from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]]. The [[Madrigal (music)|madrigal]], up until its development in the early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] into an instrumentally-accompanied form, is also usually in a cappella form. Jewish and Christian music were originally a cappella,{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; many Old Testament passages make reference to multiple instruments being used. [By definition, Christianity began with the New Testament.]|date=November 2013}} and this practice has continued in both of these religions as well as in Islam.\n\n===Christian===\nThe [[polyphony]] of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century AD, with compositions by [[Josquin des Prez]].<ref name=EB>{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}</ref> The early a cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument, although this instrument<!--Which instrument? A single melody instrument or a polyphonic instrument like a pipe organ?--> would merely double the singers' parts and was not independent. By the 16th century, a cappella [[polyphony]] had further developed, but gradually, the [[cantata]] began to take the place of a cappella forms.<ref name=EB/> 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ \"doubling\" some or all of the voices.<ref name=EB/> Such is seen in the life of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] becoming a major influence on [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], most notably in the ''[[Mass in B Minor]]''.\n\nOther composers that utilized the a cappella style, if only for the occasional piece, were [[Claudio Monteverdi]] and his masterpiece, ''Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata'' (A lover's tears at his beloved's grave), which was composed in 1610,<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005a|p=6}}</ref> and [[Andrea Gabrieli]] when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces, one of which was in the unaccompanied style.<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005|p=780}}</ref> Learning from the preceding two composeres, [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] utilized the a cappella style in numerous pieces, chief among these were the pieces in the [[oratorio]] style, which were traditionally performed during the Easter week and dealt with the religious subject matter of that week, such as Christ's suffering and [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]]. Five of Schutz's ''Historien'' were Easter pieces, and of these the latter three, which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints, those of [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] and [[John the Evangelist|John]], were all done a cappella style. This was a near requirement for this type of piece, and the parts of the crowd were sung while the solo parts which were the quoted parts from either Christ or the authors were performed in a [[plainchant]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005a|p=73}}</ref>\n\n====Byzantine Rite====\nIn the Byzantine Rite of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the music performed in the liturgies is exclusively sung without instrumental accompaniment. Bishop Kallistos Ware says, \"The service is sung, even though there may be no choir... In the Orthodox Church today, as in the early Church, singing is unaccompanied and instrumental music is not found.\"<ref name=Ware>{{harvnb|Ware|1997|p=268}}</ref> This ''a cappella'' behavior arises from strict interpretation of Psalms 150, which states, ''Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.''<ref>{{bibleverse||Psalms|150:6}}</ref> In keeping with this philosophy, early Russian ''musika'' which started appearing in the late 17th century, in what was known as ''khorov\u00efye kontsert\u00ef'' (choral concertos) made a cappella adaptations of Venetian-styled pieces, such as the treatise, ''Grammatika musikiyskaya'' (1675), by [[Nikolai Diletsky]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taruskin|2005b|p=234}}</ref> Divine Liturgies and Western Rite masses composed by famous composers such as [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Tchaikovsky)|Peter Tchaikovsky]], [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Rachmaninoff)|Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Alexander Arkhangelsky (composer)|Alexander Arkhangelsky]], and [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Leontovych)|Mykola Leontovych]] are fine examples of this.\n\n====Opposition to instruments in worship====\nPresent-day Christian religious bodies known for conducting their worship services without musical accompaniment include some [[Presbyterian]] churches devoted to the [[regulative principle of worship]], [[Old Regular Baptist]]s, [[Primitive Baptist]]s, [[Plymouth Brethren]], [[Churches of Christ]], Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma), the [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], [[Doukhobor]]s the [[Byzantine Rite]] and the [[Amish]], [[Old Order Mennonites]] and [[Conservative Mennonites]]. Certain [[high church]] services and other musical events in liturgical churches (such as the Roman Catholic [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]]) may be a cappella, a practice remaining from apostolic times. Many [[Mennonite]]s also conduct some or all of their services without instruments. [[Sacred Harp]], a type of [[folk music]], is an a cappella style of religious singing with [[shape notes]], usually sung at singing conventions.\n\nOpponents of [[musical instruments in the Christian worship]] believe that such opposition is supported by the Christian scriptures and Church history. The scriptures typically referenced are [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026:30;%20Acts%2016:25;%20Romans%2015:9;%201%20Corinthians%2014:15;%20Ephesians%205:19;%20Colossians%203:16;%20Hebrews%202:12,%2013:15;%20James%205:13;&version=49; Matthew 26:30; Acts 16:25; Romans 15:9; 1 Corinthians 14:15; Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16; Hebrews 2:12, 13:15; James 5:13], which show examples and exhortations for Christians to sing.<ref name=kurfees>{{harvnb|Kurfees|1911}}</ref>\n\nThere is no reference to instrumental music in early church worship in the New Testament, or in the worship of churches for the first six centuries.<ref name=McKinnon>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1965|pp=263, 265}}</ref><ref name=Bales>{{harvnb|Bales|1973|p=351}}</ref> Several reasons have been posited throughout church history for the absence of instrumental music in church worship.{{refn|group=\"nb\"|The absence of instrumental music is rooted in various hermeneutic principles (ways of interpreting the Bible) which determine what is appropriate for worship. Among such principles are the [[regulative principle of worship]] (Ulrich Zwingli), [[Sola scriptura]] (Martin Luther and Ulrich Zwingli), and the history of [[hymn]] in \"Christianity\". Dispensationalism emphasizes the differences between the old (Law of Moses) and the new (Jesus and the Apostles) covenants, emphasizing that the majority of the practices from the Law of Moses were replaced by the teachings of Jesus and the Apostles. The absence of instrumental music in early church worship is significant given the abundance of Hebrew Bible references and commands to worship God with harp, lyre and cymbal. After several hundred years of Tabernacle worship without references to instrumental music, King David (ca 1500 BC) introduced musical instruments into Temple worship reportedly because of a commandment from God, complete with who was to sing, who was to play, and what instruments were to be used.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25-29}}</ref>}}\n\nChristians who believe in a cappella music today believe that in the Israelite worship assembly during Temple worship only the Priests of Levi sang, played, and offered animal sacrifices, whereas in the church era, all Christians are commanded to sing praises to God. They believe that if God wanted instrumental music in New Testament worship, He would have commanded not just singing, but singing and playing like he did in the Hebrew scriptures.\n\nThe first recorded example of a musical instrument in Roman Catholic worship was a [[pipe organ]] introduced by [[Pope Vitalian]] into a cathedral in Rome around 670.<ref>American Encyclopedia, Volume 12, p. 688{{title missing}}</ref>{{refn|group=\"nb\"|McKinnon maintained that the organ was the first instrument to be introduced into worship and the next was the trumpet. He noted accounts of an organ being sent from Byzantium to Pippin in 757, and another to Charlemagne in 812.<ref>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1965|p=265}}</ref>}}\n\nInstruments have divided Christendom since their introduction into worship. They were considered a Catholic innovation, not widely practiced until the 18th century, and were opposed vigorously in worship by a number of [[Protestant Reformers]], including [[Martin Luther]] (1483\u20131546),<ref name=M&S>{{harvnb|M'Clintock|Strong|1894|p=762}}</ref> [[Ulrich Zwingli]], [[John Calvin]] (1509\u20131564)<ref name=Calvin>{{harvnb|Calvin|2009}}</ref> and [[John Wesley]] (1703\u20131791).<ref name=Clarke>{{harvnb|Clarke|1844|p=684}}</ref> Alexander Campbell referred to the use of an instrument in worship as \"a cow bell in a concert\".<ref name=ferg>{{harvnb|Ferguson|2004|p=414}}</ref> In [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'', the heroine, [[Jeanie Deans]], a Scottish Presbyterian, writes to her father about the church situation she has found in England (bold added):\n:The folk here are civil, and, like the barbarians unto the holy apostle, have shown me much kindness; and there are a sort of chosen people in the land, for they have some '''[[kirk]]s without organs that are like ours''', and are called meeting-houses, where the minister preaches without a gown.<ref name=Scott>{{harvnb|Scott|1818}}</ref>\n\n====Acceptance of instruments in worship====\nThose who do not adhere to the [[regulative principle]] of interpreting Christian scripture, believe that limiting praise to the unaccompanied chant of the early church is not commanded in scripture, and that churches in any age are free to offer their songs with or without musical instruments.\n\nThose who subscribe to this interpretation believe that since the Christian scriptures never counter instrumental language with any negative judgment on instruments, opposition to instruments instead comes from an interpretation of history. There is no written opposition to musical instruments in any setting in the first century and a half of Christian churches (AD 33 to 180).<ref name=McKinnon2>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1989|p=2}}</ref> The use of instruments for Christian worship during this period is also undocumented. Toward the end of the 2nd century, Christians began condemning the instruments themselves.<ref name=McKinnon3>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1998|p=72}}</ref> Those who oppose instruments today believe these Church Fathers had a better understanding of God's desire for the church,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} but there are significant differences between the teachings of these Church Fathers and Christian opposition to instruments today.\n*Modern Christians typically believe it is acceptable to play instruments or to attend weddings, funerals, banquets, etc., where instruments are heard playing religious music. The Church Fathers made no exceptions.<ref name=McKinnon3/> Since the New Testament never condemns instruments themselves, much less in any of these settings, it is believed that \"the church Fathers go beyond the New Testament in pronouncing a negative judgment on musical instruments.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|p=74}}</ref>\n*Written opposition to instruments in worship began near the turn of the 5th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|pp=52, 53}}</ref> Modern opponents of instruments typically do not make the same assessment of instruments as these writers,{{refn|group=\"nb\"|Rather than calling the use of instruments \"evil\", modern opposition typically uses terms like \"unspiritual\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|p=88}}</ref> or an Old Testament \"shadow\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|Lewis|West|1984|p=109}}</ref>}} who argued that God had allowed David the \"evil\" of using musical instruments in praise.<ref>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1989|p=7}}</ref> While the Old Testament teaches that God specifically asked for musical instruments,<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25}}</ref> modern concern is for worship based on the New Testament.\n\nSince \"a cappella\" singing brought a new polyphony (more than one note at a time) with instrumental accompaniment, it is not surprising that Protestant reformers who opposed the instruments (such as Calvin and Zwingli) also opposed the polyphony.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss|Taruskin|1984|p=107}}</ref> While Zwingli was destroying organs in Switzerland&nbsp;\u2013 Luther called him a fanatic&nbsp;\u2013 the Church of England was burning books of polyphony.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss|Taruskin|1984|p=109}}</ref>\n\nSome [[Holiness Churches]] such as the [[Free Methodist Church]] opposed the use of musical instruments in church worship until the mid-20th century. The Free Methodist Church allowed for local church decision on the use of either an organ or piano in the 1943 Conference before lifting the ban entirely in 1955.\n\n===Jewish===\nWhile worship in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] included musical instruments ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25\u201329:27}}), traditional Jewish religious services in the Synagogue, both before and after the last destruction of the Temple, did not include musical instruments<ref>{{harvnb|Price|2005|p=68}}</ref> given the practice of scriptural [[cantillation]].<ref>{{harvnb|McKinnon|1998|p=85}}</ref> The use of musical instruments is traditionally forbidden on the Sabbath out of concern that players would be tempted to repair (or tune) their instruments, which is forbidden on those days. (This prohibition has been relaxed in many Reform and some Conservative congregations.) Similarly, when Jewish families and larger groups sing traditional Sabbath songs known as [[zemirot]] outside the context of formal religious services, they usually do so a cappella, and Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations on the Sabbath sometimes feature entertainment by a cappella ensembles. During [[the Three Weeks]] musical instruments are prohibited. Many Jews consider a portion of the 49-day period of the [[Counting of the Omer|counting of the omer]] between Passover and Shavuot to be a time of semi-mourning and instrumental music is not allowed during that time.<ref>{{harvnb|Melamed|2013}}</ref> This has led to a tradition of a cappella singing sometimes known as ''sefirah'' music.<ref name=\"Shircago\">{{harvnb|Shircago|2013}}</ref>\n\nThe popularization of the Jewish chant may be found in the writings of the Jewish philosopher [[Philo]], born 20 BC. Weaving together Jewish and Greek thought, Philo promoted praise without instruments, and taught that \"silent singing\" (without even vocal chords) was better still.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1972|pp=39\u201341}}</ref> This view parted with the Jewish scriptures, where Israel offered praise with instruments by God's own command ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:25}}). The [[shofar]] is the only temple instrument still being used today in the synagogue,<ref>{{harvnb|Olson|1967|p=562}}</ref> and it is only used from [[Rosh Chodesh]] [[Elul]] through the end of [[Yom Kippur]].

The success of the ensemble was emulated by other regional conductors, and a tradition of a cappella choral music was born in the region at colleges like [[Concordia College, Moorhead|Concordia College]] (Moorhead, Minnesota), [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College]] (Rock Island, Illinois), [[Wartburg College]] (Waverly, Iowa), [[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]] (Decorah, Iowa), [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] (St. Peter, Minnesota), [[Augustana College (South Dakota)|Augustana College]] (Sioux Falls, South Dakota), and [[Augsburg University]] (Minneapolis, Minnesota). The choirs typically range from 40 to 80 singers and are recognized for their efforts to perfect blend, intonation, phrasing and pitch in a large choral setting.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nMovements in modern a cappella over the past century include [[Barbershop music|barbershop]] and [[doo wop]]. The [[Barbershop Harmony Society]], [[Sweet Adelines International]], and Harmony Inc. host educational events including Harmony University, Directors University, and the International Educational Symposium, and international contests and conventions, recognizing international champion [[List of chorus champions by year|choruses]] and [[List of quartet champions by year|quartets]].\n\nMany a cappella groups can be found in high schools and colleges. There are amateur Barbershop Harmony Society and professional groups that sing a cappella exclusively. Although a cappella is technically defined as singing without instrumental accompaniment, some groups use their voices to emulate instruments; others are more traditional and focus on harmonizing. A cappella styles range from gospel music to contemporary to barbershop quartets and choruses.\n\nThe [[Contemporary A Cappella Society]] (CASA) is a membership option for former students, whose funds support hosted competitions and events.\n\nA cappella music was popularized between the late 2000s and the early to mid-2010s with media hits such as the 2009\u20132014 TV show ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' and the musical comedy film series ''[[Pitch Perfect]]''.\n\n===Recording artists===\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}\nIn [[Number-one hits of 1943 (United States)|July 1943]], as a result of the [[American Federation of Musicians]] boycott of US recording studios, the a cappella vocal group ''The Song Spinners'' had a best-seller with \"Comin' In On A Wing And A Prayer\". In the 1950s, several recording groups, notably [[The Hi-Los]] and the [[Four Freshmen]], introduced complex jazz harmonies to a cappella performances. The [[King's Singers]] are credited with promoting interest in small-group a cappella performances in the 1960s.

A cappella music attained renewed prominence from the late 1980s onward, spurred by the success of Top 40 recordings by artists such as [[The Manhattan Transfer]], [[Bobby McFerrin]], [[Huey Lewis and the News]], [[All-4-One]], [[The Nylons]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Boyz II Men]], and [[*NSYNC]].{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nContemporary a cappella includes many vocal groups and bands who add [[vocal percussion]] or [[beatboxing]] to create a pop/rock/gospel sound, in some cases very similar to bands with instruments. Examples of such professional groups include [[Straight No Chaser (group)|Straight No Chaser]], [[Pentatonix]], [[The House Jacks]], [[Rockapella]], [[Mosaic (vocal band)|Mosaic]], [[Home Free (group)|Home Free]] and [[M-pact]]. There also remains a strong a cappella presence within Christian music, as some denominations purposefully do not use instruments during worship. Examples of such groups are [[Take 6]], [[Glad (band)|Glad]] and [[Acappella (group)|Acappella]]. Arrangements of popular music for small a cappella ensembles typically include one voice singing the lead melody, one singing a rhythmic bass line, and the remaining voices contributing chordal or [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] accompaniment.\n\nA cappella can also describe the isolated vocal track(s) from a [[multitrack recording]] that originally included instrumentation.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} These vocal tracks may be [[remix]]ed or put onto vinyl records for DJs, or released to the public so that fans can remix them.

The earliest reports of this style of a cappella music involved African Americans. The earliest documented quartets all began in [[barber]] shops. In 1938, the first formal men's barbershop organization was formed, known as the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America (S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A), and in 2004 rebranded itself and officially changed its public name to the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]] (BHS).

In 1953, Sweet Adelines became an international organization, although it didn't change its name to [[Sweet Adelines International]] until 1991. The membership of nearly 25,000 women, all singing in English, includes choruses in most of the fifty United States as well as in Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the organization encompasses more than 1,200 registered quartets and 600 choruses.\n\nIn 1959, a second women's barbershop organization started as a break off from Sweet Adelines due to ideological differences. Based on democratic principles which continue to this day, [http://www.harmonyinc.org Harmony, Inc.] is smaller than its counterpart, but has an atmosphere of friendship and competition. With about 2,500 members in the United States and Canada, Harmony, Inc. uses the same rules in contest that the Barbershop Harmony Society uses. Harmony, Inc. is registered in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n===Amateur and high school===\nThe popularity of a cappella among high schools and amateurs was revived by television shows and movies such as ''Glee'' and ''Pitch Perfect''. High school groups have conductors or student leaders who keep the tempo for the group.\n\n==In other countries==\n{{expand section|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Pakistan===\nThe musical show ''Strepsils Stereo'' is credited for introducing the art of a cappella in [[Pakistan]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1178175|title=Strepsils Stereo brings A Capella to Pakistan for the first time|work=Dawn|date=11 August 2017|accessdate=9 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nComposer [[Dinesh Subasinghe]] became the first [[Sri Lanka]]n to write a cappella pieces for [[SATB]] choirs.

Some notable historical groups formed along the way include [[Colgate University]]'s [[The Colgate Thirteen|The Colgate 13]] (1942), [[Dartmouth College]]'s Aires (1946), [[Cornell University]]'s Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the [[University of Maine]] Maine Steiners (1958), the [[Columbia University]] Kingsmen (1949), the [http://www.jabberwocks.com Jabberwocks] of [[Brown University]] (1949), and the [[University of Rochester]] YellowJackets (1956).\n\nAll-women a cappella groups followed shortly, frequently as a [[parody]] of the men's groups: the [[Smiffenpoofs]] of [[Smith College]] (1936), The Shwiffs of Connecticut College (The She-Whiffenpoofs, 1944), and [[The Chattertocks of Brown University]] (1951). A cappella groups exploded in popularity beginning in the 1990s, fueled in part by a change in style popularized by the [[Beelzebubs|Tufts University Beelzebubs]] and the [[Dear Abbeys|Boston University Dear Abbeys]]. The new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments, including [[vocal percussion]]/\"[[beatboxing]]\". Some larger universities now have multiple groups. Groups often join one another in on-campus concerts, such as [[the Georgetown Chimes]]' Cherry Tree Massacre, a 3-weekend a cappella festival held each February since 1975, where over a hundred collegiate groups have appeared, as well as [[List of quartet champions by year|International Quartet Champions]] [[Boston Common (quartet)|The Boston Common]] and the contemporary commercial a cappella group [[Rockapella]]. Co-ed groups have produced many up-and-coming and major artists, including [[John Legend]], an alumnus of the Counterparts at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Sara Bareilles]], an alumna of Awaken A Cappella at [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. [[Mira Sorvino]] is an alumna of [[the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones]] of [[Harvard College]], where she had the solo on [[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]] by [[Yazoo (band)|Yaz]].\n\nA cappella is gaining popularity among South Asians with the emergence of primarily Hindi-English College groups. The first South Asian a cappella group was [[Penn Masala]], founded in 1996 at the University of Pennsylvania. Co-ed South Asian a cappella groups are also gaining in popularity. The first co-ed south Asian a cappella was Anokha, from the [[University of Maryland]], formed in 2001. Also, Dil se, another co-ed a cappella from UC Berkeley, hosts the \"Anahat\" competition at the University of California, Berkeley annually. Maize Mirchi, the co-ed a cappella group from the [[University of Michigan]] hosts \"Sa Re Ga Ma Pella\", an annual South Asian a cappella invitational with various groups from the Midwest. Another South Asian group from the Midwest is Chai Town who is based in the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign.\n\nJewish-interest groups such as [[Queens College]]'s Tizmoret, [[Tufts University]]'s [[Shir Appeal]], [[University of Chicago]]'s Rhythm and Jews, [[Binghamton University]]'s Kaskeset, [[Ohio State University]]'s Meshuganotes, [[Rutgers University]]'s Kol Halayla, [[New York University]]'s Ani V'Ata and [[Yale University]]'s Magevet are also gaining popularity across the U.S.<ref>{{harvnb|Ginsberg|2015}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Altshuler|2013}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Shapiro|2011}}</ref>\n\nIncreased interest in modern a cappella (particularly collegiate a cappella) can be seen in the growth of awards such as the Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards (overseen by the [[Contemporary A Cappella Society]]) and competitions such as the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella]] for college groups and the [[Harmony Sweepstakes]] for all groups. In December 2009, a new television competition series called ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' aired on [[NBC]]. The show featured eight a cappella groups from the United States and Puerto Rico vying for the prize of $100,000 and a recording contract with [[Epic Records]]/[[Sony Music]]. The show was judged by [[Ben Folds]], [[Shawn Stockman]], and [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and was won by an all-male group from Puerto Rico called [[Nota (group)|Nota]]. The show returned for a second, third and fourth season, won by [[Committed (group)|Committed]], [[Pentatonix]] and [[Home Free (group)|Home Free]] respectively.\n\nEach year, hundreds of Collegiate a cappella groups submit their strongest songs in a competition to be on The Best of College A Cappella (BOCA), an album compilation of tracks from the best college a cappella groups around the world. The album is produced by Varsity Vocals&nbsp;\u2013 which also produces the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella&nbsp;\u2013 and [[Deke Sharon]]. ). According to ethnomusicologist Joshua S. Dunchan, \"BOCA carries considerable cache and respect within the field despite the appearance of other compilations in part, perhaps, because of its longevity and the prestige of the individuals behind it.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dunchan|first=Joshua|date=2012|title=Recordings, Technology, and Discourse in Collegiate A Cappella|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/490098|journal=Journal of American Folklore|volume=125|issue=498|pages=488\u2013502|via=Project MUSE}}</ref>\n\nCollegiate a cappella groups may also submit their tracks to Voices Only, a two-disc series released at the beginning of each school year. A Voices Only album has been released every year since 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, all women's a cappella groups can send their strongest song tracks to the Women's A Cappella Association (WACA) for its annual best of women's a cappella album. WACA offers another medium for women's voices to receive recognition and has released an album every year since 2014, featuring women's groups from across the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Women's A Cappella Association |url=http://www.womensacappella.org/#!recordings/cfpt |website=Women's A Cappella Association |access-date=February 4, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Emulating instruments==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nIn addition to singing words, some a cappella singers also emulate instrumentation by reproducing instrumental sounds with their [[vocal cords]] and mouth, often pitched using specialised pitch pipes. One of the earliest 20th century practitioners of this method were [[The Mills Brothers]] whose early recordings of the 1930s clearly stated on the label that all instrumentation was done vocally. More recently, \"[[Twilight Zone (dance song)|Twilight Zone]]\" by [[2 Unlimited]] was sung a cappella to the instrumentation on the comedy television series ''Tompkins Square''. Another famous example of emulating instrumentation instead of singing the words is the theme song for ''[[The New Addams Family]]'' series on [[Fox Family Channel]] (now [[ABC Family]]). Groups such as [[Vocal Sampling]] and Undivided emulate Latin rhythms a cappella. In the 1960s, the Swingle Singers used their voices to emulate musical instruments to Baroque and Classical music. Vocal artist [[Bobby McFerrin]] is famous for his instrumental emulation. A cappella group [[Naturally Seven]] recreates entire songs using vocal tones for every instrument.\n\nThe [[Swingle Singers]] used nonsense words to sound like instruments, but have been known to produce non-verbal versions of musical instruments. [[Beatboxing]], more accurately known as vocal percussion, is a technique used in a cappella music popularized by the [[hip-hop]] community, where [[Rapping|rap]] is often performed a cappella also. The advent of vocal percussion added new dimensions to the a cappella genre and has become very prevalent in modern arrangements.<ref>{{harvnb|Pauley|2012}}</ref> Jazz vocalist [[Petra Haden]] used a four-track recorder to produce an a cappella version of ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' including the instruments and fake advertisements on her album ''[[Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out]]'' in 2005. Haden has also released a cappella versions of [[Journey (band)|Journey]]'s \"[[Don't Stop Believin']]\", [[The Beach Boys]]' \"[[God Only Knows]]\" and [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]\".\n\nChristian rock group [[Relient K]] recorded the song \"Plead the Fifth\" a cappella on its album ''[[Five Score and Seven Years Ago]]''.
