The demand for higher speed led to the development of new systems specifically for computer use. In the 1980s were [[daisy wheel printing|daisy wheel]] systems similar to typewriters, [[line printer]]s that produced similar output but at much higher speed, and [[Dot matrix printing|dot matrix]] systems that could mix text and graphics but produced relatively low-quality output. The [[plotter]] was used for those requiring high quality line art like [[blueprint]]s.\n\nThe introduction of the low-cost laser printer in 1984 with the first [[HP LaserJet]], and the addition of [[PostScript]] in next year's [[LaserWriter|Apple LaserWriter]], set off a revolution in printing known as [[desktop publishing]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Soren|date=1999|title=Discontinuous innovation and the growth paradox|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/eb054631|journal=Strategy and Leadership|volume=27(2)|issue=2|pages=16\u201321|via=|doi=10.1108/eb054631}}</ref>. Laser printers using PostScript mixed text and graphics, like dot-matrix printers, but at quality levels formerly available only from commercial [[typesetting]] systems. By 1990, most simple printing tasks like fliers and brochures were now created on [[personal computer]]s and then laser printed; expensive [[offset printing]] systems were being dumped as scrap. The [[HP Deskjet]] of 1988 offered the same advantages as laser printer in terms of flexibility, but produced somewhat lower quality output (depending on the paper) from much less expensive mechanisms. Inkjet systems rapidly displaced dot matrix and daisy wheel printers from the market. By the 2000s high-quality printers of this sort had fallen under the $100 price point and became commonplace.\n\nThe rapid update of [[internet]] [[email]] through the 1990s and into the 2000s has largely displaced the need for printing as a means of moving documents, and a wide variety of reliable storage systems means that a \"physical backup\" is of little benefit today. Even the desire for printed output for \"offline reading\" while on mass transit or aircraft has been displaced by [[E-reader|e-book readers]] and [[tablet computer]]s. Today, traditional printers are being used more for special purposes, like printing photographs or artwork, and are no longer a must-have peripheral.\n\nStarting around 2010, [[3D printing]] became an area of intense interest, allowing the creation of physical objects with the same sort of effort as an early laser printer required to produce a brochure. These devices are in their earliest stages of development and have not yet become commonplace.\n\n== Types of printers ==\n''Personal'' printers are primarily designed to support individual users, and may be connected to only a single computer. These printers are designed for low-volume, short-turnaround [[print job]]s, requiring minimal setup time to produce a hard copy of a given document. However, they are generally slow devices ranging from 6 to around 25 pages per minute (ppm), and the cost per page is relatively high. However, this is offset by the on-demand convenience. Some printers can print documents stored on [[memory card]]s or from [[digital camera]]s and [[image scanner|scanner]]s.\n\n''Networked'' or ''shared'' printers are \"designed for high-volume, high-speed printing\".  They are usually shared by many users on a [[Computer network|network]] and can print at speeds of 45 to around 100 ppm.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morley|first1=Deborah|title=Understanding Computers: Today & Tomorrow, Comprehensive 2007 Update Edition|date=April 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781305172425|page=164|url=https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Computers-Tomorrow-Comprehensive-Update-ebook/dp/B00H7HUHXY/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1402428267&sr=1-1&keywords=9781305172425}}</ref> The [[Xerox 9700]] could achieve 120 ppm.\n\nA ''[[virtual printer]]'' is a piece of computer software whose user interface and [[Application programming interface|API]] resembles that of a printer driver, but which is not connected with a physical computer printer. A virtual printer can be used to create a file which is an image of the data which would be printed, for archival purposes or as input to another program, for example to create a [[PDF]] or to transmit to another system or user.\n\nA ''[[3D printing|3D printer]]'' is a device for making a three-dimensional object from a 3D model or other electronic data source through additive processes in which successive layers of material (including plastics, metals, food, cement, wood, and other materials) are laid down under computer control.  It is called a printer by analogy with an inkjet printer which produces a two-dimensional document by a similar process of depositing a layer of ink on paper.\n\n== Technology ==\nThe choice of print technology has a great effect on the cost of the printer and cost of operation, speed, quality and permanence of documents, and noise. Some printer technologies do not work with certain types of physical media, such as [[carbon paper]] or [[transparency (projection)|transparencies]].\n\nA second aspect of printer technology that is often forgotten is resistance to alteration: liquid [[ink]], such as from an inkjet head or fabric ribbon, becomes absorbed by the paper fibers, so documents printed with liquid ink are more difficult to alter than documents printed with toner or solid inks, which do not penetrate below the paper surface.\n\nCheques can be printed with liquid ink or on special cheque paper with toner anchorage so that alterations may be detected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abagnale.com/pdf/protection_b.pdf|format=PDF|title=Protection Against Cheque Fraud|publisher=abagnale.com|author=Abagnale, Frank|authorlink=Frank Abagnale|year=2007|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> The machine-readable lower portion of a cheque must be printed using [[magnetic ink character recognition|MICR]] toner or ink. Banks and other clearing houses employ automation equipment that relies on the [[magnetic flux]] from these specially printed characters to function properly.\n\n=== Modern print technology ===\n\nThe following [[printing]] technologies are routinely found in modern printers:\n\n==== Toner-based printers ====\n{{main article|Laser printer}}\n\nA [[Laser printing|laser printer]] rapidly produces high quality text and graphics. As with digital [[photocopier]]s and multifunction printers (MFPs), laser printers employ a [[xerography|xerographic]] printing process but differ from analog photocopiers in that the image is produced by the direct scanning of a [[laser]] beam across the printer's [[photodetector|photoreceptor]].\n\nAnother toner-based printer is the [[LED printer]] which uses an array of [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]] instead of a [[laser]] to cause toner [[adhesion]] to the print drum.\n\n==== Liquid inkjet printers ====\n\n[[File:Ink-jet-cartridge.jpg|thumb|Liquid ink cartridge from Hewlett-Packard HP 845C inkjet printer]]\n[[Inkjet printer]]s operate by propelling variably sized droplets of liquid ink onto almost any sized page. They are the most common type of computer printer used by consumers.\n\n==== Solid ink printers ====\n{{main article|Solid ink}}\n\n[[Solid ink]] printers, also known as phase-change printers, are a type of [[thermal transfer printer]]. They use solid sticks of [[CMYK color model|CMYK]]-coloured ink, similar in consistency to candle wax, which are melted and fed into a piezo crystal operated print-head. The printhead sprays the ink on a rotating, oil coated drum. The paper then passes over the print drum, at which time the image is immediately transferred, or transfixed, to the page. Solid ink printers are most commonly used as colour office printers, and are excellent at printing on transparencies and other non-porous media. Solid ink printers can produce excellent results. Acquisition and operating costs are similar to [[Laser printing|laser printers]]. Drawbacks of the technology include high [[energy conservation|energy consumption]] and long warm-up times from a cold state. Also, some users complain that the resulting prints are difficult to write on, as the wax tends to repel inks from [[pen]]s, and are difficult to feed through [[automatic document feeder]]s, but these traits have been significantly reduced in later models. In addition, this type of printer is only available from one manufacturer, [[Xerox]], manufactured as part of their [[Xerox Phaser]] office printer line. Previously, [[solid ink]] printers were manufactured by [[Tektronix]], but Tek sold the printing business to Xerox in 2001.\n\n==== Dye-sublimation printers ====\n{{main article|Dye-sublimation printer}}\n\n[[File:RGB dye sublimation panels.jpg|thumb|300px|A disassembled dye sublimation cartridge]]\nA dye-sublimation printer (or dye-sub printer) is a printer which employs a printing process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a plastic card, paper or [[canvas print|canvas]]. The process is usually to lay one colour at a time using a ribbon that has colour panels. Dye-sub printers are intended primarily for high-quality colour applications, including colour photography; and are less well-suited for text. While once the province of high-end print shops, dye-sublimation printers are now increasingly used as dedicated consumer photo printers.\n\n====Thermal printers====\n\n[[File:Twitter receipt printer.jpg|thumb|Receipt printer printing a Twitter timeline]]\n[[Thermal printing|Thermal printers]] work by selectively heating regions of special heat-sensitive paper. Monochrome thermal printers are used in cash registers, [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]], [[Fuel dispenser|gasoline dispensers]] and some older inexpensive fax machines. Colours can be achieved with special papers and different temperatures and heating rates for different colours; these coloured sheets are not required in black-and-white output. One example is [[Zink (technology)|Zink]] (a portmanteau of \"zero ink\").<ref>{{cite web |url=https://zink.com/technology/ |title=Zink Technology |publisher=ZINK |date= |accessdate=2017-08-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Obsolete and special-purpose printing technologies ===\n[[File:Epson MX-80.jpg|thumb|[[Epson]] MX-80, a popular model of dot-matrix printer in use for many years]]\n\nThe following technologies are either obsolete, or limited to special applications though most were, at one time, in widespread use.\n\n==== Impact printers ====\n{{anchor|Impact_printers}}'''Impact printers''' rely on a forcible impact to transfer ink to the media. The impact printer uses a print head that either hits the surface of the ink ribbon, pressing the ink ribbon against the paper (similar to the action of a [[typewriter]]), or, less commonly, hits the back of the paper, pressing the paper against the ink ribbon (the [[IBM 1403]] for example).  All but the [[dot matrix printer]] rely on the use of ''fully formed characters'', [[letterform]]s that represent each of the characters that the printer was capable of printing. In addition, most of these printers were limited to monochrome, or sometimes two-color, printing in a single typeface at one time, although [[emphasis (typography)|bolding]] and [[underlining]] of text could be done by \"overstriking\", that is, printing two or more impressions either in the same character position or slightly offset. Impact printers varieties include typewriter-derived printers, teletypewriter-derived printers, daisywheel printers, dot matrix printers and line printers. Dot matrix printers remain in common use in businesses where multi-part forms are printed. ''An overview of impact printing''<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/416/zable.pdf| format=PDF-2031 KB | title=An overview of impact printing| publisher=[[IBM]] | work=Journal of Research and Development| author1=J.

The [[Friden Flexowriter]] and [[IBM Selectric typewriter|IBM Selectric-based]] printers were the most-common examples. The Flexowriter printed with a conventional typebar mechanism while the Selectric used IBM's well-known \"golf ball\" printing mechanism. In either case, the letter form then struck a ribbon which was pressed against the paper, printing one character at a time. The maximum speed of the Selectric printer (the faster of the two) was 15.5 characters per second.\n\n===== Teletypewriter-derived printers =====\n{{main article|Teleprinter}}\n\nThe common [[teleprinter]] could easily be interfaced to the computer and became very popular except for those computers manufactured by [[IBM]]. Some models used a \"typebox\" that was positioned, in the X- and Y-axes, by a mechanism and the selected letter form was struck by a hammer. Others used a type cylinder in a similar way as the Selectric typewriters used their type ball. In either case, the letter form then struck a ribbon to print the letterform. Most teleprinters operated at ten characters per second although a few achieved 15 CPS.\n\n===== Daisy wheel printers =====\n[[File:Daisywheel 1.jpg|thumb|left|\"daisy wheel\" print element]]\n{{main article|Daisy wheel printer}}\nDaisy wheel printers operate in much the same fashion as a [[typewriter]]. A hammer strikes a wheel with petals, the \"daisy wheel\", each petal containing a letter form at its tip. The letter form strikes a ribbon of [[ink]], depositing the ink on the page and thus printing a character. By rotating the daisy wheel, different characters are selected for printing. These printers were also referred to as ''letter-quality printers'' because they could produce text which was as clear and crisp as a typewriter. The fastest letter-quality printers printed at 30 characters per second.\n\n===== Dot-matrix printers =====\n{{main article|Dot matrix printer}}\n\n[[File:Dot matrix example text.png|thumb|right|Sample output from  9-pin dot matrix printer (one character expanded to show detail)]]\nThe term [[dot matrix printer]] is used for impact printers that use a matrix of small [[pin]]s to transfer ink to the page.<ref>{{cite book|author1=David W. Beskeen|author2=Carol Cram|author3=Jennifer Duffy|author4=Lisa Friedrichsen|author5=Elizabeth Eisner Reding|title=Microsoft Office 2007 illustrated: Introductory|date=2008|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=1418860476|edition=Windows XP}}</ref> The advantage of dot matrix over other impact printers is that they can produce [[graphic design|graphical]] images in addition to text; however the text is generally of poorer quality than impact printers that use letterforms (''type'').\n\nDot-matrix printers can be broadly divided into two major classes:\n* Ballistic wire printers\n* [[Stored energy printer]]s\n\nDot matrix printers can either be [[character (computing)|character]]-based or line-based (that is, a single horizontal series of pixels across the page), referring to the configuration of the print head.\n\nIn the 1970s & 80s, dot matrix printers were one of the more common types of printers used for general use, such as for home and small office use. Such printers normally had either 9 or 24 pins on the print head (early 7 pin printers also existed, which did not print [[descender]]s). There was a period during the early home computer era when a range of printers were manufactured under many brands such as the [[Commodore International|Commodore]] VIC-1525 using the [[Seikosha]] '''Uni-Hammer''' system.  This used a single solenoid with an oblique striker that would be actuated 7 times for each column of 7 vertical pixels while the head was moving at a constant speed. The angle of the striker would align the dots vertically even though the head had moved one dot spacing in the time.  The vertical dot position was controlled by a synchronised longitudinally ribbed platen behind the paper that rotated rapidly with a rib moving vertically seven dot spacings in the time it took to print one pixel column.<ref>{{cite web|title=MPS-801 printer|url=http://sleepingelephant.com/denial/wiki/index.php?title=MPS-801_printer|publisher=DenialWIKI|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=VIC-1525 Graphics Printer User Manual|url=http://www.classiccmp.org/cini/pdf/Commodore/VIC-1525%20Printer%20User%27s%20Manual.pdf|publisher=Commodore Computer|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref> 24-pin print heads were able to print at a higher quality and started to offer additional type styles and were marketed as [[Dot matrix printing#Near Letter Quality .28NLQ.29|Near Letter Quality]] by some vendors. Once the price of inkjet printers dropped to the point where they were competitive with dot matrix printers, dot matrix printers began to fall out of favour for general use.\n\nSome dot matrix printers, such as the NEC P6300, can be upgraded to print in colour. This is achieved through the use of a four-colour ribbon mounted on a mechanism (provided in an upgrade kit that replaces the standard black ribbon mechanism after installation) that raises and lowers the ribbons as needed. Colour graphics are generally printed in four passes at standard resolution, thus slowing down printing considerably. As a result, colour graphics can take up to four times longer to print than standard monochrome graphics, or up to 8-16 times as long at high resolution mode.\n\nDot matrix printers are still commonly used in low-cost, low-quality applications such as [[cash register]]s, or in demanding, very high volume applications like [[invoice]] printing. Impact printing, unlike laser printing, allows the pressure of the print head to be applied to a stack of two or more forms to print [[Multipart stationery|multi-part documents]] such as sales invoices and [[credit card]] receipts using [[continuous stationery]] with [[carbonless copy paper]]. Dot-matrix printers were being superseded even as receipt printers after the end of the twentieth century.\n\n===== Line printers =====\n{{main article|Line printer}}\n\nLine printers print an entire line of text at a time. Four principal designs exist.\n[[File:Drum-printer.jpg|thumb|left|Print drum from drum printer]]\n*''Drum printers'', where a horizontally mounted rotating drum carries the entire character set of the printer repeated in each printable character position.  The [[IBM 1132]] printer is an example of a drum printer. Drum printers are also found in adding machines and other numeric printers (POS), the dimensions are compact as only a dozen characters need to be supported.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wolff|first1=John|title=The Olivetti Logos 240 Electronic Calculator - Technical Description|url=http://www.johnwolff.id.au/calculators/Tech/Logos240/Logos240.htm|publisher=John Wolff's Web Museum|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref>\n[[File:PrinterIBM1403 090325.jpg|thumb|IBM 1403 line printer]]\n*''Chain or train printers'', where the character set is arranged multiple times around a linked chain or a set of character slugs in a track traveling horizontally past the print line.  The [[IBM 1403]] is perhaps the most popular, and comes in both chain and train varieties.  The ''band printer'' is a later variant where the characters are embossed on a flexible steel band.  The LP27 from Digital Equipment Corporation is a band printer.\n*''Bar printers'', where the character set is attached to a solid bar that moves horizontally along the print line, such as the [[IBM 1443]].<ref>{{cite book|last=IBM Corporation|title=IBM 1443 PRINTER for 1620/1710 Systems|url=http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/ibm/1620/A26-5730-2_1443_printer_for_1620.pdf}}</ref>\n*A fourth design, used mainly on very early printers such as the IBM 402, features independent type bars, one for each printable position. Each bar contains the character set to be printed.  The bars moves vertically to position the character to be printed in front of the print hammer.<ref>{{cite book|last=IBM Corporation|title=IBM 402, 403 and 419 Accounting Machines Manual of Operation|year=1963|url=http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/ibm/punchedCard/AccountingMachine/224-1614-13_402-403-419.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn each case, to print a line, precisely timed hammers strike against the back of the paper at the exact moment that the correct character to be printed is passing in front of the paper. The paper presses forward against a ribbon which then presses against the character form and the impression of the character form is printed onto the paper.  Each system could have slight timing issues, which could cause minor misalignment of the resulting printed characters.  For drum or typebar printers, this appeared as vertical misalignment, with characters being printed slightly above or below the rest of the line.  In chain or bar printers, the misalignment was horizontal, with printed characters being crowded closer together or farther apart.  This was much less noticeable to human vision than vertical misalignment, where characters seemed to bounce up and down in the line, so they were considered as higher quality print.  \n\n*''Comb printers'', also called ''[[line matrix printer]]s'', represent the fifth major design. These printers are a hybrid of [[dot matrix printing]] and line printing. In these printers, a comb of hammers prints a portion of a row of pixels at one time, such as every eighth pixel. By shifting the comb back and forth slightly, the entire pixel row can be printed, continuing the example, in just eight cycles. The paper then advances and the next pixel row is printed. Because far less motion is involved than in a conventional dot matrix printer, these printers are very fast compared to dot matrix printers and are competitive in speed with formed-character line printers while also being able to print dot matrix graphics.  The [[Printronix]] P7000  series of line matrix printers are still manufactured as of 2013.\n\nLine printers are the fastest of all impact printers and are used for bulk printing in large computer centres. A line printer can print at 1100 lines per minute or faster, frequently printing pages more rapidly than many current laser printers.  On the other hand, the mechanical components of line printers operate with tight tolerances and require regular [[preventive maintenance]] (PM) to produce top quality print. They are virtually never used with [[personal computer]]s and have now been replaced by high-speed [[Laser printing|laser printer]]s.  The legacy of line printers lives on in many computer [[operating system]]s, which use the abbreviations \"lp\", \"lpr\", or \"LPT\" to refer to printers.\n\n==== Liquid ink electrostatic printers ====\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2012}}\n\nLiquid ink electrostatic printers use a chemical coated paper, which is charged by the print head according to the image of the document.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/138/c/CK1366.pdf |publisher=[[Raytheon|Raytheon Company]]  |title= ''CK1366 CK1367 Printer-type cathode ray tube'' data sheet |date=1 November 1960 |format=PDF |accessdate=29 July 2017}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/138/c/CK1368.pdf |publisher=[[Raytheon|Raytheon Company]]  |title= ''CK1368 CK1369 Printer-type cathode ray tube'' data sheet |date=1 November 1960 |format=PDF |accessdate=29 July 2017}}</ref> The paper is passed near a pool of liquid ink with the opposite charge. The charged areas of the paper attract the ink and thus form the image. This process was developed from the process of [[electrofax|electrostatic copying]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cms.ironk12.org/TeacherWebsites/RyanDurfee/USHistory/HistoryStudentsWebsites/MadisonAlgerHISTORYWEBSITE/electrostaticprinter.html |title=Madison's website on Renn Zaphiropoulos |publisher=Cms.ironk12.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201153330/http://cms.ironk12.org/TeacherWebsites/RyanDurfee/USHistory/HistoryStudentsWebsites/MadisonAlgerHISTORYWEBSITE/electrostaticprinter.html |archivedate=2012-12-01 |df= }}</ref> Color reproduction is very accurate, and because there is no heating the scale distortion is less than  \u00b10.1%.

Liquid ink electrostatic printers were mostly available in {{convert|36|to|54|in}} width and also 6 color printing. These were also used to print large billboards. It was first introduced by Versatec, which was later bought by [[Xerox]]. [[3M]] also used to make these printers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wide-format-printers.org/3M_Scotchprint_Printer_2000/3M_Scotchprint_2000_signs.htm |title=Introduction to the 3M Scotchprint 2000 electrostatic printer |publisher=Wide-format-printers.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref>\n\n==== Plotters ====\n{{main article|Plotter}}\n[[File:Calcomp 565 drum plotter.jpg|thumb|right|A Calcomp 565 drum plotter]]\nPen-based '''[[plotter]]s''' were an alternate printing technology once common in engineering and architectural firms. Pen-based plotters rely on contact with the paper (but not impact, per se) and special purpose pens that are mechanically run over the paper to create text and images. Since the pens output continuous lines, they were able to produce technical drawings of higher resolution than was achievable with dot-matrix technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpmuseum.net/exhibit.php?class=4&cat=24|title=HP Computer Museum}}</ref>  Some plotters used roll-fed paper, and therefore had minimal restriction on the size of the output in one dimension. These plotters were capable of producing quite sizable drawings.\n\n=== Other printers ===\n\nA number of other sorts of printers are important for historical reasons, or for special purpose uses\n\n* [[Minilab|Digital minilab]] ([[photographic paper]])\n* [[VT52|Electrolytic printers]]\n* [[Spark printer]]\n* Barcode printer multiple technologies, including: [[thermal printing]], [[inkjet printing]], and [[laser printing]] [[barcode]]s\n* Billboard / sign paint spray printers\n* Laser etching (product packaging) industrial printers\n* Microsphere (special paper)\n\n== Attributes ==\n\n=== Printer control languages ===\nMost printers other than line printers accept [[control character]]s or unique character sequences to control various printer functions.  These may range from shifting from lower to upper case or from black to red ribbon on typewriter printers to switching fonts and changing character sizes and colors on raster printers. Early printer controls were not standardized, with each manufacturer's equipment having its own set.  The IBM [[Personal Printer Data Stream]] (PPDS) became a commonly used command set for dot-matrix printers.\n\nToday, most printers accept one or more [[page description language]]s (PDLs). Laser printers with greater processing power frequently offer support for variants of Hewlett-Packard's [[Printer Command Language]] (PCL), [[PostScript]] or [[XML Paper Specification]]. Most inkjet devices support manufacturer proprietary PDLs such as [[ESC/P]]. The diversity in mobile platforms have led to various standardization efforts around device PDLs such as the [[Printer Working Group]] (PWG's) [[PWG Raster]].\n\n=== Printing speed ===\n\nThe speed of early printers was measured in units of ''characters per minute'' (cpm) for character printers, or ''lines per minute'' (lpm) for line printers. Modern printers are measured in ''pages per minute'' (ppm). These measures are used primarily as a marketing tool, and are not as well standardised as [[ISO/IEC 19752|toner yields]]. Usually pages per minute refers to sparse monochrome office documents, rather than dense pictures which usually print much more slowly, especially colour images. Speeds in ppm usually apply to [[ISO 216|A4 paper]] in Europe and [[letter (paper size)|letter]] paper, about 6% shorter, in the United States.\n\n=== Printing mode ===\n\nThe data received by a printer may be:\n\n* [[plain text|A string of characters]]\n* [[raster graphics|A bitmapped image]]\n* [[vector graphics|A vector image]]\n* A [[computer program]] written in a [[page description language]], such as [[page description language|PCL]] or [[PostScript]]\n\nSome printers can process all four types of data, others not.\n\n* Character printers, such as [[daisy wheel printer]]s, can handle only plain text data or rather simple point plots.\n* Pen [[plotter]]s typically process [[vector image]]s. Inkjet based plotters can adequately reproduce all four.\n* Modern printing technology, such as [[Laser printing|laser printer]]s and [[inkjet printer]]s, can adequately reproduce all four. This is especially true of printers equipped with support for PCL or PostScript, which includes the vast majority of printers produced today.\n\nToday it is possible to print everything (even plain text) by sending ready bitmapped images to the printer. This allows better control over formatting, especially among machines from different vendors. Many [[printer driver]]s do not use the text mode at all, even if the printer is capable of it.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n=== Monochrome, colour and photo printers ===\n\nA [[monochrome]] printer can only produce an [[image]] consisting of one [[colour]], usually black. A monochrome printer may also be able to produce various tones of that color, such as a [[grayscale|grey-scale]]. A colour printer can produce images of multiple colours. A photo printer is a colour printer that can produce images that mimic the [[gamut|colour range]] (gamut) and [[image resolution|resolution]] of prints made from [[photographic film]]. Many can be used on a standalone basis without a computer, using a [[memory card]] or [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] connector.\n\n=== Page yield ===\n\nThe page yield is number of pages that can be printed from a [[toner cartridge]] or [[ink cartridge]]\u2014before the cartridge needs to be refilled or replaced.\nThe actual number of pages yielded by a specific cartridge depends on a number of factors.<ref>\n[http://static.highspeedbackbone.net/html/printeryieldguide.html \"The Science Behind Page Counts, Cartridge Yields and The 5% Rule\"].\n</ref>\n\nFor a fair comparison, many laser printer manufacturers use the [[ISO/IEC 19752]] process to measure the toner cartridge yield.<ref name=\"measuring_yield\">\n[http://www8.hp.com/h71041/learn-about-supplies/us/en/overview.php \"Printer & Page Yield Overview\"].\nHewlett-Packard.\n</ref><ref>\n[https://www.lexmark.com/en_us/products/supplies-and-accessories/iso-page-yields.html \"ISO Page Yields\"].\nquote: \"Many original equipment manufacturers of printers and multifunction products (MFPs), including Lexmark, utilize the international industry standards for page yields (ISO/IEC 19752, 19798, and 24711).\"\n</ref>\n\n=== Cost per page ===\n\nIn order to fairly compare operating expenses of printers with a relatively small [[ink cartridge]] to printers with a larger, more expensive [[toner cartridge]] that typically holds more toner and so prints more pages before the cartridge needs to be replaced, many people prefer to estimate operating expenses in terms of [[cost per page]] (CPP).<ref name=\"measuring_yield\" /><ref name=\"officeworks\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.officeworks.com.au/information/cost-per-page\n|title=Cost per page\n|website=www.officeworks.com.au\n}}</ref>\n<ref>\n[http://www.ganson.com/TCO-For-Color.html \"Color laser vs inkjet printer\".]\nGanson Engineering.\n</ref><ref>\nVincent Verhaeghe.\n[http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/color-laser-printers-2,1534-2.html \"Color Laser Printers: Fast and Affordable\"].\n2007.\n</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|author=Rebecca Scudder\n|url=http://www.brighthub.com/multimedia/publishing/articles/112064.aspx\n|title=Unit Cost of Printing: Laser v.

That is, a company may sell a printer at cost, and make profits on the [[ink cartridge]], paper, or some other [[spare part|replacement part]]. This has caused legal disputes regarding the right of companies other than the printer manufacturer to sell [[computer compatibility|compatible]] ink cartridges. To protect their business model, several manufacturers invest heavily in developing new cartridge technology and patenting it.\n\nOther manufacturers, in reaction to the challenges from using this business model, choose to make more money on printers and less on the ink, promoting the latter through their advertising campaigns. Finally, this generates two clearly different proposals: \"cheap printer&nbsp;\u2013 expensive ink\" or \"expensive printer&nbsp;\u2013 cheap ink\". Ultimately, the consumer decision depends on their reference [[interest rate]] or their [[time preference]]. From an [[economics]] viewpoint, there is a clear [[trade-off]] between cost per copy and cost of the printer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officenet.com.ar/impresoras/|title=Librer\u00eda comercial online - Staples|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Printer steganography ===\n[[File:Printer Steganography Illustration.png|thumb|An illustration showing small yellow tracking dots on white paper, generated by a color laser printer]]\n{{Main article|Printer steganography}}\n\nPrinter steganography is a type of [[steganography]] \u2013 \"hiding data within data\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Artz|first=D|title=Digital steganography: hiding data within data|journal=IEEE Xplore|date=May\u2013Jun 2001|volume=5|issue=3|pages=75, 80|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=935180&isnumber=20242|accessdate=April 11, 2013}}</ref> \u2013 produced by color printers, including [[Brother Industries|Brother]], [[Canon (company)|Canon]], Dell, [[Seiko Epson|Epson]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], IBM, [[Konica Minolta]], [[Kyocera]], Lanier, [[Lexmark]], [[Ricoh]], [[Toshiba]] and [[Xerox]]<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Printers Which Do or Do Not Display Tracking Dots|url=https://www.eff.org/pages/list-printers-which-do-or-do-not-display-tracking-dots|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]}} Retrieved 11 March 2011.</ref> brand color laser printers, where tiny yellow dots are added to each page.

As a legal concept, its origins in Britain were from a reaction to printers' monopolies at the beginning of the 18th&nbsp;century. The English [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] was concerned about the unregulated [[copying]] of books and passed the [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]],<ref>''Copyright in Historical Perspective'', p. 136-137, Patterson, 1968, Vanderbilt Univ. Press</ref> which established a register of licensed books and required a copy to be deposited with the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]], essentially continuing the licensing of material that had long been in effect.\n\nCopyright laws allow products of creative human activities, such as literary and artistic production, to be preferentially exploited and thus incentivized. Different cultural attitudes, social organizations, economic models and legal frameworks are seen to account for why copyright emerged in [[Europe]] and not, for example, in Asia. In the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, there was generally a lack of any concept of literary property due to the general relations of production, the specific organization of literary production and the role of culture in society. The latter refers to the tendency of oral societies, such as that of Europe in the medieval period, to view knowledge as the product and expression of the collective, rather than to see it as individual property. However, with copyright laws, intellectual production comes to be seen as a product of an individual, with attendant rights. The most significant point is that patent and copyright laws support the expansion of the range of creative human activities that can be commodified. This parallels the ways in which [[capitalism]] led to the [[commodification]] of many aspects of social life that earlier had no monetary or economic value per&nbsp;se.<ref>Bettig, Ronald V. (1996). ''Copyrighting Culture: The Political Economy of Intellectual Property.

Article 2, Section 2 of the Berne Convention states: \"It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to prescribe that works in general or any specified categories of works shall not be protected unless they have been fixed in some material form.\" Some countries do not require that a work be produced in a particular form to obtain copyright protection. For instance, Spain, France, and Australia do not require fixation for copyright protection. The United States and Canada, on the other hand, require that most works must be \"fixed in a tangible medium of expression\" to obtain copyright protection.<ref name=\"cyber.law.harvard.edu\">See Harvard Law School, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/copyrightforlibrarians/Module_3:_The_Scope_of_Copyright_Law#Fixation ''Module 3: The Scope of Copyright Law''].

The legislative history of the 1976 Copyright Act says this difference was intended to address transitory works such as ballets, pantomimes, improvised performances, dumb shows, mime performances, and dancing.</ref> U.S. law requires that the fixation be stable and permanent enough to be \"perceived, reproduced or communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.\" Similarly, Canadian courts consider fixation to require that the work be \"expressed to some extent at least in some material form, capable of identification and having a more or less permanent endurance.\"<ref name=\"cyber.law.harvard.edu\"/>\n\n===Copyright notice===\n{{main|Copyright notice}}\n[[File:Copyright.svg|thumb|upright|A copyright symbol used in copyright notice]]\nBefore 1989, United States law required the use of a copyright notice, consisting of the [[copyright symbol]] (\u00a9, the letter '''C''' inside a circle), the abbreviation \"Copr.\", or the word \"Copyright\", followed by the year of the first publication of the work and the name of the copyright holder.<ref>Copyright Act of 1976, {{USPL|94|553}}, 90 Stat. 2541, \u00a7 401(a) (19 October 1976)</ref><ref>The Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 (BCIA), {{USPL|100|568}}, 102 Stat. 2853, 2857. One of the changes introduced by the BCIA was to section&nbsp;401, which governs copyright notices on published copies, specifying that notices \"may be placed on\" such copies; prior to the BCIA, the statute read that notices \"shall be placed on all\" such copies. An analogous change was made in section&nbsp;402, dealing with copyright notices on phonorecords.</ref> Several years may be noted if the work has gone through substantial revisions. The proper copyright notice for sound recordings of musical or other audio works is a [[sound recording copyright symbol]] (\u2117, the letter&nbsp;'''P''' inside a circle), which indicates a sound recording copyright, with the letter&nbsp;'''P''' indicating a \"phonorecord\". In addition, the phrase ''[[All rights reserved]]'' was once required to assert copyright, but that phrase is now legally obsolete. Almost everything on the Internet has some sort of copyright attached to it. Whether these things are watermarked, signed, or have any other sort of indication of the copyright is a different story however.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The People's Platform:Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age.|last=Taylor|first=Astra|publisher=Picador|year=2014|isbn=978-1-250-06259-8|location=New York City, New York, USA|pages=144\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989 the United States enacted the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] Implementation Act, amending the 1976&nbsp;Copyright Act to conform to most of the provisions of the Berne Convention.

While [[copyright registry|central registries]] are kept in some countries which aid in proving claims of ownership, registering does not necessarily prove ownership, nor does the fact of copying (even without permission) necessarily [[legal proof|prove]] that copyright was infringed. Criminal sanctions are generally aimed at serious counterfeiting activity, but are now becoming more commonplace as copyright collectives such as the [[RIAA]] are increasingly targeting the [[file sharing]] home Internet user. Thus far, however, most such cases against file sharers have been settled out of court. (See: [[Legal aspects of file sharing]])\n\nIn most jurisdictions the copyright holder must bear the cost of enforcing copyright. This will usually involve engaging legal representation, administrative or court costs. In light of this, many copyright disputes are settled by a direct approach to the infringing party in order to settle the dispute out of court.\n\n\"...by 1978, the scope was expanded to apply to any 'expression' that has been 'fixed' in any medium, this protection granted automatically whether the maker wants it or not, no registration required.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Astra|title=The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age|date=2014|publisher=Picador|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-1-250-06259-8|page=148}}</ref>\n\n===Copyright infringement===\n{{main|Copyright infringement}}\nFor a work to be considered to infringe upon copyright, its use must have occurred in a nation that has domestic copyright laws or adheres to a bilateral treaty or established international convention such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] or [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Copyright Treaty]].

This includes the right to decide to distribute the work for free. This part of copyright is often overseen. The phrase \"exclusive right\" means that only the copyright holder is free to exercise those rights, and others are prohibited from using the work without the holder's permission. Copyright is sometimes called a \"negative right\", as it serves to prohibit certain people (e.g., readers, viewers, or listeners, and primarily publishers and would be publishers) from doing something they would otherwise be able to do, rather than permitting people (e.g., authors) to do something they would otherwise be unable to do. In this way it is similar to the [[unregistered design right]] in [[English law]] and [[European law]]. The rights of the copyright holder also permit him/her to not use or exploit their copyright, for some or all of the term. There is, however, a critique which rejects this assertion as being based on a [[Philosophy of copyright|philosophical interpretation of copyright law]] that is not universally shared. There is also debate on whether copyright should be considered a [[property right]] or a [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral right]].<ref>Tom G.

The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. musical composition, novel), whether the work has been [[Publication|published]], and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. Under most countries' laws (for example, the United States<ref>{{usc|17|305}}</ref> and the United Kingdom<ref>The Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performances Regulations 1995, [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19953297_en_3.htm part II], Amendments of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988</ref>), copyrights expire at the end of the calendar year in question.\n\nThe length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation, and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries, which can make determining the duration of a given copyright somewhat difficult. For example, the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force, and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage. In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately 6 years in Italy and up to about 14 in France. Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms (sometimes retroactively).

Hirtle, \"Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States 1 January 2015\" [https://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm online at footnote 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226112433/http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm |date=26 February 2015 }}</ref>  Books originally published outside the US by non-Americans are exempt from this renewal requirement, if they are still under copyright in their home country.\n\nBut if the intended exploitation of the work includes publication (or distribution of derivative work, such as a film based on a book protected by copyright) outside the U.S., the terms of copyright around the world must be considered. If the author has been dead more than 70 years, the work is in the public domain in most, but not all, countries.\n\nIn 1998, the length of a copyright in the United States was increased by 20 years under the Copyright Term Extension Act. This legislation was strongly promoted by corporations which had valuable copyrights which otherwise would have expired, and has been the subject of substantial criticism on this point.<ref>Lawrence Lessig, ''Copyright's First Amendment'', 48 UCLA L. Rev. 1057, 1065 (2001)</ref>\n\n==Limitations and exceptions==\n{{main|Limitations and exceptions to copyright}}\n\nIn many jurisdictions, copyright law makes exceptions to these restrictions when the work is copied for the purpose of commentary or other related uses. US copyright does NOT cover names, title, short phrases or Listings (such as ingredients, recipes, labels, or formulas).<ref>[http://copyright.gov/circs/circ34.pdf (2012) ''Copyright Protection Not Available for Names, Titles, or Short Phrases'' U.S. Copyright Office]</ref> However, there are protections available for those areas copyright does not cover \u2013 such as [[trademark]]s and [[patent]]s.\n\nThere are some exceptions to what copyright will protect. Copyright will not protect:\n* Names of products\n* Names of businesses, organizations, or groups\n* Pseudonyms of individuals\n* Titles of works\n* Catchwords, catchphrases, mottoes, slogans, or short advertising expressions\n* Listings of ingredients in recipes, labels, and formulas, though the directions can be copyrighted\n\n===Idea\u2013expression dichotomy and the merger doctrine===\n{{main|Idea\u2013expression divide}}\n\nThe idea\u2013expression divide differentiates between ideas and expression, and states that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the ideas themselves. This principle, first clarified in the 1879 case of [[Baker v. Selden]], has since been codified by the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b).\n\n===The first-sale doctrine and exhaustion of rights===\n\n{{main|First-sale doctrine|Exhaustion of rights}}\nCopyright law does not restrict the owner of a copy from reselling legitimately obtained copies of copyrighted works, provided that those copies were originally produced by or with the permission of the copyright holder. It is therefore legal, for example, to resell a copyrighted book or [[compact disc|CD]]. In the United States this is known as the [[first-sale doctrine]], and was established by the [[court]]s to clarify the legality of reselling books in second-hand [[bookstore]]s.\n\nSome countries may have [[parallel importation]] restrictions that allow the copyright holder to control the [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]]. This may mean for example that a copy of a book that does not infringe copyright in the country where it was printed does infringe copyright in a country into which it is imported for retailing. The first-sale doctrine is known as [[exhaustion of rights]] in other countries and is a principle which also applies, though somewhat differently, to [[patent]] and [[trademark]] rights. It is important to note that the first-sale doctrine permits the transfer of the particular legitimate copy involved. It does not permit making or distributing additional copies.\n\nIn ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.]]'',<ref>{{cite web |title=John Wiley & Sons Inc. v. Kirtsaeng |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702033641/https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf |archivedate=2 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> in 2013, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held in a 6-3 decision that the first-sale doctrine applies to goods manufactured abroad with the copyright owner's permission and then imported into the US without such permission.  The case involved a plaintiff who imported Asian editions of textbooks that had been manufactured abroad with the publisher-plaintiff's permission. The defendant, without permission from the publisher, imported the textbooks and resold on eBay. The Supreme Court's holding severely limits the ability of copyright holders to prevent such importation.\n\nIn addition, copyright, in most cases, does not prohibit one from acts such as modifying, defacing, or destroying his or her own legitimately obtained copy of a copyrighted work, so long as duplication is not involved. However, in countries that implement [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]], a copyright holder can in some cases successfully prevent the mutilation or destruction of a work that is publicly visible.\n\n===Fair use and fair dealing===\n{{main|Fair use|Fair dealing}}\nCopyright does not prohibit all copying or replication. In the United States, the [[Fair use|fair use doctrine]], codified by the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]] as 17 U.S.C. Section 107, permits some copying and distribution without permission of the copyright holder or payment to same. The statute does not clearly define fair use, but instead gives four non-exclusive factors to consider in a fair use analysis. Those factors are:\n# the purpose and character of one's use\n# the nature of the copyrighted work\n# what amount and proportion of the whole work was taken, and\n# the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html |title=US CODE: Title 17,107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use |publisher=.law.cornell.edu |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=16 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] and many other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, a similar notion of fair dealing was established by the [[court]]s or through [[legislation]]. The concept is sometimes not well defined; however in [[Canada]], private copying for personal use has been expressly permitted by statute since 1999. In ''[[Alberta (Education) v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright)]]'', 2012 SCC 37, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] concluded that limited copying for educational purposes could also be justified under the fair dealing exemption. In Australia, the fair dealing exceptions under the ''Copyright Act 1968'' (Cth) are a limited set of circumstances under which copyrighted material can be legally copied or adapted without the copyright holder's consent. Fair dealing uses are research and study; review and critique; news reportage and the giving of professional advice (i.e. [[legal advice]]). Under current [[Law of Australia|Australian law]], although it is still a breach of copyright to copy, reproduce or adapt copyright material for personal or private use without permission from the copyright owner, owners of a legitimate copy are permitted to \u201cformat shift\u201d that work from one medium to another for personal, private use, or to \u201ctime shift\u201d a broadcast work for later, once and only once, viewing or listening. Other technical exemptions from infringement may also apply, such as the temporary reproduction of a work in machine readable form for a computer.\n\nIn the United States the AHRA ([[Audio Home Recording Act]] Codified in Section 10, 1992) prohibits action against consumers making noncommercial recordings of music, in return for royalties on both media and devices plus mandatory copy-control mechanisms on recorders.\n\n:''Section 1008. Prohibition on certain infringement actions''\n\n:''No action may be brought under this title alleging infringement of copyright based on the manufacture, importation, or distribution of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or an analog recording medium, or based on the noncommercial use by a consumer of such a device or medium for making digital musical recordings or analog musical recordings.''\n\nLater acts amended US Copyright law so that for certain purposes making 10 copies or more is construed to be commercial, but there is no general rule permitting such copying. Indeed, making one complete copy of a work, or in many cases using a portion of it, for commercial purposes will not be considered fair use. The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] prohibits the manufacture, importation, or distribution of devices whose intended use, or only significant commercial use, is to bypass an access or copy control put in place by a copyright owner.<ref name=\"Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights\"/> An appellate court has held that fair use is not a defense to engaging in such distribution.\n\nThe [[copyright directive]] allows EU member states to implement a set of exceptions to copyright. Examples of those exceptions are:\n*photographic reproductions on paper or any similar medium of works (excluding sheet music) provided that the rightholders receives fair compensation,\n*reproduction made by libraries, educational establishments, museums or archives, which are non-commercial\n*archival reproductions of broadcasts,\n*uses for the benefit of people with a disability,\n*for demonstration or repair of equipment,\n*for non-commercial research or private study\n*when used in [[parody]]\n\n===Accessible copies===\nIt is legal in several countries including the United Kingdom and the United States to produce alternative versions (for example, in large print or braille) of a copyrighted work to provide improved access to a work for blind and visually impaired persons without permission from the copyright holder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#121|title=Chapter 1 - Circular 92 - U.S. Copyright Office|website=www.copyright.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsite/public_cvipsact2002.hcsp|title=Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2002 comes into force|publisher=Royal National Institute of Blind People|date=1 January 2011|accessdate=11 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Transfer and licensing, and assignment}} Transfer, assignment and licensing==\n{{see also|Collective rights management|Extended collective licensing|Compulsory license|Copyright transfer agreement}}\n[[File:All rights reserved.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|DVD: [[All Rights Reserved]].]]\nA copyright, or aspects of it (e.g. reproduction alone, all but moral rights), may be assigned or transferred from one party to another.<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights\">{{cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&as_brr=3|isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|page=15}}</ref> For example, a musician who records an album will often sign an agreement with a record company in which the musician agrees to transfer all copyright in the recordings in exchange for royalties and other considerations. The creator (and original copyright holder) benefits, or expects to, from production and marketing capabilities far beyond those of the author. In the digital age of music, music may be copied and distributed at minimal cost through the [[Internet]]; however, the [[record industry]] attempts to provide promotion and marketing for the artist and his or her work so it can reach a much larger audience. A copyright holder need not transfer all rights completely, though many publishers will insist. Some of the rights may be transferred, or else the copyright holder may grant another party a non-exclusive license to copy or distribute the work in a particular region or for a specified period of time.\n\nA transfer or licence may have to meet particular formal requirements in order to be effective,<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(2)\">{{cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&as_brr=3|page=8 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}</ref> for example under the Australian [[Copyright law of Australia#Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act 1968]] the copyright itself must be expressly transferred in writing. Under the U.S. Copyright Act, a transfer of ownership in copyright must be memorialized in a writing signed by the transferor. For that purpose, ownership in copyright includes exclusive licenses of rights. Thus exclusive licenses, to be effective, must be granted in a written instrument signed by the grantor. No special form of transfer or grant is required. A simple document that identifies the work involved and the rights being granted is sufficient. Non-exclusive grants (often called non-exclusive licenses) need not be in writing under [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]]. They can be oral or even implied by the behavior of the parties. Transfers of copyright ownership, including exclusive licenses, may and should be recorded in the U.S. Copyright Office. (Information on recording transfers is available on the Office's web site.) While recording is not required to make the grant effective, it offers important benefits, much like those obtained by recording a deed in a [[real estate]] transaction.\n\nCopyright may also be [[license]]d.<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights\"/> Some jurisdictions may provide that certain classes of copyrighted works be made available under a prescribed [[statutory license]] (e.g. musical works in the United States used for radio broadcast or performance). This is also called a [[compulsory license]], because under this scheme, anyone who wishes to copy a covered work does not need the permission of the copyright holder, but instead merely files the proper notice and pays a set fee established by statute (or by an agency decision under statutory guidance) for every copy made.<ref name=\"WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights(3)\">{{cite book |title=WIPO Guide on the Licensing of Copyright and Related Rights|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LvRRvXBIi8MC&as_brr=3|page=16 |isbn=978-92-805-1271-7 |year=2004 |publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization}}</ref> Failure to follow the proper procedures would place the copier at risk of an infringement suit. Because of the difficulty of following every individual work, [[copyright collective]]s or [[collecting societies]] and [[performance rights organisation|performing rights organizations]] (such as [[ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], and [[SESAC]]) have been formed to collect royalties for hundreds (thousands and more) works at once. Though this market solution bypasses the statutory license, the availability of the statutory fee still helps dictate the price per work collective rights organizations charge, driving it down to what avoidance of procedural hassle would justify.\n\n===Free licenses===\nCopyright licenses known as ''open'' or [[free license]]s seek to grant several rights to licensees, either for a fee or not, to an effect inspired by the [[public domain]]. ''Free'' in this context is not as much of a reference to price as it is to freedom. What constitutes free licensing has been characterised in a number of similar definitions, including by order of longevity the [[Free Software Definition]], the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]], the [[Open Source Definition]] and the [[Definition of Free Cultural Works]]. Further refinements to these licenses have resulted in categories such as [[copyleft]] and [[permissive license|permissive]]. Common examples of free licences are the [[GNU General Public License]], [[BSD license]]s and some [[Creative Commons licenses]].\n\nFounded in 2001 by [[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], [[Lawrence Lessig]], and [[Hal Abelson]], the [[Creative Commons]] (CC) is a non-profit organization<ref name=\"CC\">{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/ |title=Creative Commons Website|website=creativecommons.org|accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref> which aims to facilitate the legal sharing of creative works. To this end, the organization provides a number of generic copyright license options to the public, [[gratis versus libre|gratis]]. These licenses allow copyright holders to define conditions under which others may use a work and to specify what types of use are acceptable.<ref name=\"CC\" />\n\nTerms of use have traditionally been negotiated on an individual basis between copyright holder and potential licensee. Therefore, a general CC license outlining which rights the copyright holder is willing to waive enables the general public to use such works more freely. Six general types of CC licenses are available (although some of them are not properly free per the above definitions and per Creative Commons' own advice). These are based upon copyright-holder stipulations such as whether he or she is willing to allow modifications to the work, whether he or she permits the creation of derivative works and whether he or she is willing to permit commercial use of the work.<ref name=\"Rubin\">Rubin, R. E. (2010) 'Foundations of Library and Information Science: Third Edition', Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc., New York, p. 341</ref> {{As of|2009}} approximately 130 million individuals had received such licenses.<ref name=\"Rubin\" />\n\n==Criticism==\n{{Main|Opposition to copyright}}\nSome sources are critical of particular aspects of the copyright system. This is known as a debate over [[copynorms]]. Particularly to the background of uploading content to internet platforms and the digital exchange of original work, there is discussion about the [[copyright aspects of downloading and streaming]], the [[copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing]].\n\nThe interests of big internet platform service providers like Google, Amazon, Facebook or Microsoft, partly depending on users uploading content for free to their servers, collide with those of original content creators and right holders, both big, like Sony, Getty Images, Warner Bros, Elsevier, Springer and small, like local bands, national newspapers and TV-channels. In Germany the national public organisation GEMA, that collects copyright fees for componists, copywriters and music-publishers, won a juridical fight with Google over payment for songs published on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/kultur/gema-gewinnt-gegen-youtube-2782939.html|title=Gema gewinnt gegen YouTube |publisher=Saechsische Zeitung |accessdate= 24 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nConcerns are often couched in the language of [[Digital rights|digital rights, digital freedom]], [[database right]]s, [[open data]] or [[censorship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edri.org/press-release-meps-ignore-expert-advice-and-vote-for-mass-internet-censorship/ |title=MEPs ignore expert advice and vote for mass internet censorship|publisher=European Digital Rights |accessdate=24 June 2018}}</ref> Discussions include ''[[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]]'', a 2004 book by [[Lawrence Lessig]]. Lessig coined the term [[permission culture]] to describe a worst-case system. ''[[Good Copy Bad Copy]]'' (documentary) and [[RiP!: A Remix Manifesto]], discuss copyright. Some suggest an [[alternative compensation system]]. In Europe consumers are acting up against the raising costs of music, film and books, a political party has been grown out of it, ''The Pirates''. Some groups reject copyright altogether, taking an [[anti-copyright]] stance. The perceived inability to enforce copyright online leads some to advocate [[Crypto-anarchism|ignoring legal statutes when on the web]].\n\n==Public domain==\n{{main|Public domain}}\nCopyright, like other [[intellectual property rights]], is subject to a statutorily determined term. Once the term of a copyright has expired, the formerly copyrighted work enters the public domain and may be freely used or exploited by anyone. Courts in common law countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have rejected the doctrine of a [[common law copyright]]. Public domain works should not be confused with works that are publicly available. Works posted in the [[internet]], for example, are publicly available, but are not generally in the public domain. Copying such works may therefore violate the author's copyright.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Social and political philosophy|Law}}\n{{colbegin|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Adelphi Charter]]\n* [[Artificial scarcity]]\n* [[Conflict of laws]]\n* [[Copyleft]]\n* [[Copyright Alliance]]\n* [[Copyright in architecture in the United States]]\n* [[Copyright on the content of patents and in the context of patent prosecution]]\n* [[Copyright for Creativity]]\n* [[Copyright infringement of software]]\n* [[Copyright on religious works]]\n* [[Creative Barcode]]\n* [[Digital rights management]]\n* [[Digital watermarking]]\n* [[Entertainment law]]\n* [[Freedom of panorama]]\n* [[Intellectual property education]]\n* [[Intellectual property protection of typefaces]]\n* [[List of Copyright Acts]]\n* [[List of copyright case law]]\n* [[Model release]]\n* [[Opposition to copyright]]\n* [[Paracopyright]]\n* [[Photography and the law]]\n* [[Pirate Party]]\n* [[Private copying levy]]\n* [[Production music]]\n* [[Rent-seeking]]\n* [[Reproduction fees]]\n* [[Samizdat]]\n* [[Software copyright]]\n* [[Threshold pledge system]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |author=Dowd, Raymond J.\n  |title=Copyright Litigation Handbook\n  |publisher=Thomson West |edition=1st |year=2006\n  |isbn=0-314-96279-4\n  |ref=Dowd, Litigation handbook\n}}\n* Ellis, Sara R.

Dialects vary in regards to rhotics in the coda with Western Catalan generally featuring {{IPAblink|\u027e}} and Central Catalan dialects featuring a weakly trilled {{IPAblink|r}} unless it precedes a vowel-initial word in the same [[prosodic unit]], in which case {{IPAblink|\u027e}} appears.{{sfn|Padgett|2003|p=2}}\n* In careful speech, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/l/}} may be [[gemination|geminated]].

Nevertheless, the standards of the Valencian Community and the Balearics admit alternative forms, mostly traditional ones, which are not current in eastern Catalonia.{{sfn|Wheeler|2003|p=170}}\n\nThe most notable difference between both standards is some tonic {{angle bracket|e}} accentuation, for instance: {{lang|ca|franc\u00e8s, angl\u00e8s}} (IEC) \u2013 {{lang|ca-valencia|franc\u00e9s, angl\u00e9s}} (AVL). Nevertheless, AVL's standard keeps the grave accent {{angle bracket|\u00e8}}, while pronouncing it as {{IPA|/e/}} rather than {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, in some words like: {{lang|ca-valencia|qu\u00e8}} ('what'), or {{lang|ca-valencia|Val\u00e8ncia}}. Other divergences include the use of {{angle bracket|tl}} (AVL) in some words instead of {{angle bracket|tll}} like in {{lang|ca-valencia|ametla}}/{{lang|ca|ametlla}} ('almond'), {{lang|ca-valencia|espatla}}/{{lang|ca|espatlla}} ('back'), the use of elided demonstratives ({{lang|ca|este}} 'this', {{lang|ca|eixe}} 'that') in the same level as reinforced ones ({{lang|ca|aquest, aqueix}}) or the use of many verbal forms common in Valencian, and some of these common in the rest of Western Catalan too, like subjunctive mood or inchoative conjugation in {{lang|ca|-ix-}} at the same level as {{lang|ca|-eix-}} or the priority use of {{lang|ca|-e}} morpheme in 1st person singular in present indicative ({{lang|ca|-ar}} verbs): {{lang|ca|jo compre}} instead of {{lang|ca|jo compro}} ('I buy').\n\nIn the Balearic Islands, IEC's standard is used but adapted for the Balearic dialect by the [[University of the Balearic Islands]]'s philological section. In this way, for instance, IEC says it is correct writing {{lang|ca|cantam}} as much as {{lang|ca|cantem}} ('we sing') but the University says that the priority form in the Balearic Islands must be {{lang|ca|cantam}} in all fields. Another feature of the Balearic standard is the non-ending in the 1st person singular present indicative: {{lang|ca|jo compr}} ('I buy'), {{lang|ca|jo tem}} ('I fear'), {{lang|ca|jo dorm}} ('I sleep').\n\nIn Alghero, the IEC has adapted its standard to the [[Alguerese]] dialect. In this standard one can find, among other features: the definite article {{lang|ca|lo}} instead of {{lang|ca|el}}, special possessive pronouns and determinants {{lang|ca|la mia}} ('mine'), {{lang|ca|lo sou/la sua}} ('his/her'), {{lang|ca|lo tou/la tua}} ('yours'), and so on, the use of {{lang|ca|-v-}} {{IPA|/v/}} in the imperfect tense in all conjugations: {{lang|ca|cantava}}, {{lang|ca|creixiva}}, {{lang|ca|llegiva}}; the use of many archaic words, usual words in Alguerese: {{lang|ca|manco}} instead of {{lang|ca|menys}} ('less'), {{lang|ca|calqui u}} instead of {{lang|ca|alg\u00fa}} ('someone'), {{lang|ca|qual/quala}} instead of {{lang|ca|quin/quina}} ('which'), and so on; and the adaptation of [[weak pronouns in Catalan|weak pronouns]].\n\nIn 2011,<ref>Decreto 89/2011, de 5 de abril, del Gobierno de Arag\u00f3n, por el que se aprueban los\nEstatutos de la Academia Aragonesa del Catal\u00e1n.

Also, usually [[Central Catalan]] acts as an innovative element.{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=632}}\n\nLiterary Catalan allows the use of words from different dialects, except those of very restricted use.{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=632}} However, from the 19th century onwards, there has been a tendency towards favoring words of Northern dialects to the detriment of others, {{clarify span|even though nowadays there is a greater freedom of choice.|date=July 2016}}{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=632}}\n\n===Latin and Greek loanwords===\nLike other languages, Catalan has a large list of loanwords from Greek and Latin. This process started very early, and one can find such examples in [[Ramon Llull]]'s work.{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=632}} In the 14th and 15th centuries Catalan had a far greater number of Greco-Latin loanwords than other Romance languages, as is attested for example in [[Ro\u00eds de Corella]]'s writings.{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=632}} The incorporation of learned, or \"bookish\" words from its own ancestor language, [[Latin language|Latin]], into Catalan is arguably another form of lexical borrowing through the influence of [[Classical Latin|written language]] and the liturgical language of the Church. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period, most literate Catalan speakers were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing\u2014and eventually speech\u2014in Catalan.\n\n===Word formation===\nThe process of [[morphological derivation]] in Catalan follows the same principles as the other [[Romance languages]],{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=631}} where [[agglutination]] is common. Many times, several affixes are appended to a preexisting lexeme, and some sound alternations can occur, for example {{lang|ca|el\u00e8ctri'''c'''}} {{IPA|[\u0259\u02c8l\u025bktri'''k''']}} (\"electrical\") vs. {{lang|ca|electri'''c'''itat}} {{IPA|[\u0259l\u0259ktri'''s'''i\u02c8tat]}}. [[Prefixes]] are usually appended to verbs, as in {{lang|ca|'''pre'''veure}} (\"foresee\").{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=631}}\n\nThere is greater regularity in the process of [[word-compounding]], where one can find compounded words formed much like those in English.{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=631}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Common types of word compounds in Catalan{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=631}}\n|-\n!

Thus, the alternance of {{lang|ca|-o}}/{{lang|ca|-a}}, has been replaced by ''\u00f8''/{{lang|ca|-a}}.{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=630}} There are only a few exceptions, like {{lang|ca|minso}}/{{lang|ca|minsa}} (\"scarce\").{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=630}} Many not completely predictable morphological alternations may occur, such as:{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=630}}\n* Affrication: {{lang|ca|bo'''ig'''}}/{{lang|ca|bo'''j'''<u>a</u>}} (\"insane\") vs. {{lang|ca|lle'''ig'''}}/{{lang|ca|lle'''tj'''<u>a</u>}} (\"ugly\")\n* Loss of {{lang|ca|n}}: {{lang|ca|pla}}/{{lang|ca|pla'''n'''<u>a</u>}} (\"flat\") vs. {{lang|ca|sego'''n'''}}/{{lang|ca|sego'''n'''<u>a</u>}} (\"second\")\n* [[Final obstruent devoicing]]: {{lang|ca|senti'''t'''}}/{{lang|ca|senti'''d'''<u>a</u>}} (\"felt\") vs. {{lang|ca|di'''t'''}}/{{lang|ca|di'''t'''<u>a</u>}} (\"said\")\n\nCatalan has few [[suppletion|suppletive]] couplets, like Italian and Spanish, and unlike French. Thus, Catalan has {{lang|ca|noi}}/{{lang|ca|noia}} (\"boy\"/\"girl\") and {{lang|ca|gall}}/{{lang|ca|gallina}} (\"cock\"/\"hen\"), whereas French has {{lang|ca|gar\u00e7on}}/{{lang|ca|fille}} and {{lang|ca|coq}}/{{lang|ca|poule}}.{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=630}}\n\nThere is a tendency to abandon traditionally gender-invariable adjectives in favour of marked ones, something prevalent in [[Occitan]] and French. Thus, one can find {{lang|ca|bullent}}/{{lang|ca|bullenta}} (\"boiling\") in contrast with traditional {{lang|ca|bullent}}/{{lang|ca|bullent}}.{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=630}}\n\nAs in the other Western Romance languages, the main plural expression is the suffix {{lang|ca|-s}}, which may create morphological alternations similar to the ones found in gender inflection, albeit more rarely.{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=630}}\nThe most important one is the addition of {{lang|ca|-o-}} before certain consonant groups, a [[phonetic]] phenomenon that does not affect feminine forms: {{lang|ca|el pols}}/{{lang|ca|els polsos}} (\"the pulse\"/\"the pulses\") vs. {{lang|ca|la pols}}/{{lang|ca|les pols}} (\"the dust\"/\"the dusts\").{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=630\u2013631}}\n\n===Determiners===\n[[File:Begur - Pla\u00e7a de la Vila - Catalunya.jpg|thumb|Sign in the town square of [[Begur, Spain|Begur]], Catalonia, Spain.

This feature implies the use of a different set of second person pronouns for formality.\n\nThis flexibility allows Catalan to use [[extraposition]] extensively, much more than French or Spanish. Thus, Catalan can have {{lang|ca|m'hi recomanaren}} (\"they recommended me to him\"), whereas in French one must say {{lang|fr|ils m'ont recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 lui}}, and Spanish {{lang|es|me recomendaron a \u00e9l}}.{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=631}} This allows the placement of almost any nominal term as a sentence [[Topic\u2013comment|topic]], without having to use so often the [[passive voice]] (as in French or [[English language|English]]), or identifying the [[direct object]] with a [[preposition]] (as in Spanish).{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=631}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Verbs===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em\"\n|+ Simple forms of a regular verb of the first conjugation: {{lang|ca|portar}} (\"to bring\"){{sfn|Fabra|1926|pp=70\u201371}}\n! style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|Non-finite || colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|Form\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| Infinitive || colspan=\"6\" | {{lang|ca|portar}}\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| Gerund || colspan=\"6\" | {{lang|ca|portant}}\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| Past participle || colspan=\"6\" | {{lang|ca|portat}} ({{lang|ca|portat}}, {{lang|ca|portada}}, {{lang|ca|portats}}, {{lang|ca|portades}})\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|Indicative || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|jo}} || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|tu}} || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|ell / ella}}<br />[{{lang|ca|vost\u00e8}}] || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|nosaltres}} || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|vosaltres}}<br />[{{lang|ca|v\u00f3s}}] || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|ells / elles}}<br />[{{lang|ca|vost\u00e8s}}]\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| Present || {{lang|ca|porto}} || {{lang|ca|portes}} || {{lang|ca|porta}} || {{lang|ca|portem}} || {{lang|ca|porteu}} || {{lang|ca|porten}}\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| Imperfect || {{lang|ca|portava}} || {{lang|ca|portaves}} || {{lang|ca|portava}} || {{lang|ca|port\u00e0vem}} || {{lang|ca|port\u00e0veu}} || {{lang|ca|portaven}}\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| Preterite (archaic) || {{lang|ca|port\u00ed}} || {{lang|ca|portares}} || {{lang|ca|port\u00e0}} || {{lang|ca|port\u00e0rem}} || {{lang|ca|port\u00e0reu}} || {{lang|ca|portaren}}\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| Future || {{lang|ca|portar\u00e9}} || {{lang|ca|portar\u00e0s}} || {{lang|ca|portar\u00e0}} || {{lang|ca|portarem}} || {{lang|ca|portareu}} || {{lang|ca|portaran}}\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| Conditional || {{lang|ca|portaria}} || {{lang|ca|portaries}} || {{lang|ca|portaria}} || {{lang|ca|portar\u00edem}} || {{lang|ca|portar\u00edeu}} || {{lang|ca|portarien}}\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|Subjunctive || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|jo}} || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|tu}} || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|ell / ella}}<br />[{{lang|ca|vost\u00e8}}] || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|nosaltres}} || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|vosaltres}}<br />[{{lang|ca|v\u00f3s}}] || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|ells / elles}}<br />[{{lang|ca|vost\u00e8s}}]\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| Present || {{lang|ca|porti}} || {{lang|ca|portis}} || {{lang|ca|porti}} || {{lang|ca|portem}} || {{lang|ca|porteu}} || {{lang|ca|portin}}\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| Imperfect || {{lang|ca|port\u00e9s}} || {{lang|ca|port\u00e9ssis}} || {{lang|ca|port\u00e9s}} || {{lang|ca|port\u00e9ssim}} || {{lang|ca|port\u00e9ssiu}} || {{lang|ca|portessin}}\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|Imperative || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|jo}} || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|tu}} || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|ell / ella}}<br />[{{lang|ca|vost\u00e8}}] || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|nosaltres}} || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|vosaltres}}<br />[{{lang|ca|v\u00f3s}}] || style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"|{{lang|ca|ells / elles}}<br />[{{lang|ca|vost\u00e8s}}]\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || {{lang|ca|porta}} || {{lang|ca|porti}} || {{lang|ca|portem}} || {{lang|ca|porteu}} || {{lang|ca|portin}}\n|}\nLike all the Romance languages, Catalan verbal inflection is more complex than the nominal. [[Suffixation]] is omnipresent, whereas morphological alternations play a secondary role.{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=631}} Vowel alternances are active, as well as infixation and suppletion. However, these are not as productive as in Spanish, and are mostly restricted to irregular verbs.{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=631}}\n\nThe Catalan verbal system is basically common to all Western Romance, except that most dialects have replaced the synthetic indicative perfect with a periphrastic form of {{lang|ca|anar}} (\"to go\") + infinitive.{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=631}}\n\nCatalan verbs are traditionally divided into three conjugations, with vowel themes {{lang|ca|-a-}}, {{lang|ca|-e-}}, {{lang|ca|-i-}}, the last two being split into two subtypes. However, this division is mostly theoretical.{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=631}} Only the first conjugation is nowadays productive (with about 3500 common verbs), whereas the third (the subtype of {{lang|ca|servir}}, with about 700 common verbs) is semiproductive. The verbs of the second conjugation are fewer than 100, and it is not possible to create new ones, except by compounding.{{sfn|Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana|p=631}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Syntax===\n{{Main|Catalan syntax}}\nThe grammar of Catalan follows the general pattern of Western Romance languages. The primary [[word order]] is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]].<ref>[http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_ctl The World Atlas of Language Structures]. wals.info.</ref>  However, word order is very flexible.  Commonly, verb-subject constructions are used to achieve a semantic effect. The sentence \"The train has arrived\" could be translated as {{lang|ca|Ha arribat el tren}} or {{lang|ca|El tren ha arribat}}.  Both sentences mean \"the train has arrived\", but the former puts a focus on the train, while the latter puts a focus on the arrival.  This subtle distinction is described as \"what you might say while waiting in the station\" versus \"what you might say on the train.\"{{sfn|Wheeler|Yates|Dols|1999}}\n\n==Catalan names==\n{{main|Catalan names}}\n\nIn [[Spain]], every person officially has two surnames, one of which is the father's first surname and the other is the mother's first surname.{{sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=8}} The law contemplates the possibility of joining both surnames with the Catalan conjunction ''i'' (\"and\").{{sfn|Wheeler|2005|p=8}}<ref>article 19.1 of Law 1/1998 stipulates that \"the citizens of Catalonia have the right to use the proper regulation of their Catalan names and surnames and to introduce the conjunction between surnames\"</ref>\n\n==Sample text==\nSelected text{{sfn|Swan|2001|p=112}} from [[Manuel de Pedrolo]]'s 1970 novel {{lang|ca|Un amor fora ciutat}} (\"A love affair outside the city\").\n{| border=\"0\"  style=\"width:100%; text-align:left;\"\n!

Approximately 8 minutes into the flight, one of the same temperature sensors in the right engine failed, and the remaining right-engine temperature sensor displayed readings near the redline for engine shutdown.

Classical music has a lighter, clearer texture than Baroque music and is less complex. It is mainly [[homophonic]], using a clear [[melody]] line over a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]],<ref name=Blume>[[Friedrich Blume|Blume, Friedrich]]. ''Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey''. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1970</ref> but [[counterpoint]] was by no means forgotten, especially later in the period. It also makes use of ''[[Galant music|style galant]]'' which emphasized light elegance in place of the Baroque's dignified seriousness and impressive grandeur. Variety and contrast within a piece became more pronounced than before and the [[orchestra]] increased in size, range, and power.\n\nThe [[harpsichord]] was replaced as the main keyboard instrument by the [[piano]] (or [[fortepiano]]). Unlike the harpsichord, which plucked strings with quills, pianos strike the strings with leather-covered hammers when the keys are pressed, which enables the performer to play louder or softer and play with more expression; in contrast, the force with which a performer plays the harpsichord keys does not change the sound. Instrumental music was considered important by Classical period composers. The main kinds of instrumental music were the [[sonata]], trio, [[string quartet]], [[symphony]] (performed by an orchestra) and the solo [[concerto]], which featured a virtuoso solo performer playing a solo work for violin, piano, flute, or another instrument, accompanied by an orchestra. Vocal music, such as [[art song|songs for a singer and piano]] (notably the work of Schubert), [[Choir|choral works]], and [[opera]] (a staged dramatic work for singers and orchestra) were also important during this period.\n\nThe best-known composers from this period are [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], and [[Franz Schubert]]; other notable names include [[Luigi Boccherini]], [[Muzio Clementi]], [[Antonio Salieri]], [[Leopold Mozart]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] is regarded either as a Romantic composer or a Classical period composer who was part of the transition to the Romantic era. [[Franz Schubert]] is also a transitional figure, as were [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], [[Luigi Cherubini]], [[Gaspare Spontini]], [[Gioachino Rossini]], and [[Carl Maria von Weber]]. The period is sometimes referred to as the era of ''Viennese Classic'' or ''Classicism'' ({{lang-de|Wiener Klassik|link=no}}), since Gluck, Mozart, Haydn, Salieri, Schubert, and Beethoven all worked in [[Vienna]].\n\n== Classicism ==\n{{Classicism}}\nIn the middle of the 18th century, Europe began to move toward a new style in [[architecture]], literature, and the arts, generally known as [[Classicism]]. This style sought to emulate the ideals of [[Classical antiquity]], especially those of [[Classical Greece]].<ref name=\"Kamien\">[[Roger Kamien|Kamien, Roger]]. Music: An Appreciation. 6th. New York, NY: McGraw Hill, 2008. Print.</ref> Classical music used formality and emphasis on order and hierarchy, and a \"clearer\", \"cleaner\" style that used clearer divisions between parts (notably a clear, single melody accompanied by chords), brighter contrasts and \"tone colors\" (achieved by the use of dynamic changes and [[modulation (music)|modulations]] to more keys). In contrast with the richly layered music of the Baroque era, Classical music moved towards simplicity rather than complexity. In addition, the typical size of orchestras began to increase,<ref name=\"Kamien\"/> giving orchestras a more powerful sound.\n\nThe remarkable development of ideas in \"[[natural philosophy]]\" had already established itself in the public consciousness. In particular, [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[physics]] was taken as a paradigm: structures should be well-founded in [[axiom]]s and be both well-articulated and orderly. This taste for structural clarity began to affect music, which moved away from the layered [[polyphony]] of the Baroque period toward a style known as [[homophony]], in which the [[melody]] is played over a subordinate [[harmony]].<ref name=\"Kamien\"/> This move meant that [[Chord (music)|chords]] became a much more prevalent feature of music, even if they interrupted the melodic smoothness of a single part. As a result, the [[tonality|tonal]] structure of a piece of music became [[counterpoint|more audible]].\n\nThe new style was also encouraged by changes in the economic order and social structure. As the 18th century progressed, the nobility became the primary patrons of instrumental music, while public taste increasingly preferred lighter, funny [[comic opera]]s. This led to changes in the way music was performed, the most crucial of which was the move to standard instrumental groups and the reduction in the importance of the ''[[basso continuo|continuo]]''\u2014the rhythmic and harmonic groundwork of a piece of music, typically played by a keyboard ([[harpsichord]] or [[organ (music)|organ]]) and usually accompanied by a varied group of bass instruments, including [[cello]], [[double bass]], [[bass viol]], and [[theorbo]]. One way to trace the decline of the continuo and its [[figured bass|figured]] chords is to examine the disappearance of the term ''[[obbligato]]'', meaning a mandatory instrumental part in a work of [[chamber music]]. In Baroque compositions, additional instruments could be added to the continuo group according to the group or leader's preference; in Classical compositions, all parts were specifically noted, though not always ''notated'', so the term \"obbligato\" became redundant. By 1800, basso continuo was practically extinct, except for the occasional use of a [[pipe organ]] continuo part in a religious [[Mass (music)|Mass]] in the early 1800s.\n\nEconomic changes also had the effect of altering the balance of availability and quality of musicians. While in the late Baroque, a major composer would have the entire musical resources of a town to draw on, the musical forces available at an aristocratic hunting lodge or small court were smaller and more fixed in their level of ability. This was a spur to having simpler parts for ensemble musicians to play, and in the case of a resident virtuoso group, a spur to writing spectacular, idiomatic parts for certain instruments, as in the case of the [[Mannheim orchestra]], or virtuoso solo parts for particularly skilled violinists or flautists. In addition, the appetite by audiences for a continual supply of new music carried over from the Baroque. This meant that works had to be performable with, at best, one or two rehearsals. Even after 1790 Mozart writes about \"the rehearsal\", with the implication that his concerts would have only one rehearsal.\n\nSince there was a greater emphasis on a single melodic line, there was greater emphasis on notating that line for [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and phrasing. This contrasts with the Baroque era, when melodies were typically written with no dynamics, phrasing marks or ornaments, as it was assumed that the performer would improvise these elements on the spot. In the Classical era, it became more common for composers to indicate where they wanted performers to play ornaments such as trills or turns. The simplification of texture made such instrumental detail more important, and also made the use of characteristic rhythms, such as attention-getting opening fanfares, the funeral march rhythm, or the minuet genre, more important in establishing and unifying the tone of a single movement.\n\nThe Classical period also saw the gradual development of [[sonata form]], a set of structural principles for music that reconciled the Classical preference for melodic material with harmonic development, which could be applied across musical genres. The [[sonata]] itself continued to be the principal form for solo and chamber music, while later in the Classical period the [[string quartet]] became a prominent genre. The [[symphony]] form for orchestra was created in this period (this is popularly attributed to [[Joseph Haydn]]). The ''concerto grosso'' (a concerto for more than one musician), a very popular form in the Baroque era, began to be replaced by the ''solo concerto'', featuring only one soloist. Composers began to place more importance on the particular soloist's ability to show off virtuoso skills, with challenging, fast scale and arpeggio runs. Nonetheless, some ''concerti grossi'' remained, the most famous of which being Mozart's [[Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra (Mozart)|Sinfonia Concertante for Violin and Viola in E flat Major]].\n\n[[File:Tokyo String Quartet.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A modern string quartet. In the 2000s, [[string quartet]]s from the Classical era are the core of the chamber music literature. From left to right: violin 1, violin 2, cello, viola]]\n\n== Main characteristics ==\nIn the classical period, the [[subject (music)|theme]] is made up of [[phrase (music theory)|phrase]]s with contrasting melodic figures and [[rhythm]]s. These phrases are relatively brief, typically four bars in length, and can occasionally seem sparse or terse.  The texture is mainly [[homophonic]],<ref name=Blume /> with a clear melody above a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]], for instance an [[Alberti bass]]. This contrasts with the practice in [[Baroque music]], where a piece or movement would typically have only one musical subject, which would then be worked out in a number of voices according to the principles of [[counterpoint]], while maintaining a consistent rhythm or metre throughout.  As a result, Classical music tends to have a lighter, clearer texture than the Baroque. The classical style draws on the ''[[Galant music|style galant]]'', a musical style which emphasised light elegance in place of the Baroque's dignified seriousness and impressive grandeur.\n\nStructurally, Classical music generally has a clear [[musical form]], with a well-defined contrast between [[tonic (music)|tonic]] and [[dominant (music)|dominant]], introduced by clear [[Cadence (music)|cadences]]. [[dynamics (music)|Dynamics]] are used to highlight the structural characteristics of the piece. In particular, [[sonata form]] and its variants were developed during the early classical period and was frequently used.  The Classical approach to structure again contrasts with the Baroque, where a composition would normally move between tonic and dominant and back again, but through a continual progress of chord changes and without a sense of \"arrival\" at the new key. While counterpoint was less emphasised in the classical period, it was by no means forgotten, especially later in the period, and composers still used counterpoint in \"serious\" works such as symphonies and string quartets, as well as religious pieces, such as Masses.\n\nThe classical musical style was supported by technical developments in instruments. The widespread adoption of [[equal temperament]] made classical musical structure possible, by ensuring that cadences in all keys sounded similar. The [[fortepiano]] and then the [[pianoforte]] replaced the [[harpsichord]], enabling more dynamic contrast and more sustained melodies.  Over the Classical period, keyboard instruments became richer, more sonorous and more powerful.\n\nThe orchestra increased in size and range, and became more standardised. The [[harpsichord]] or [[pipe organ]] [[basso continuo]] role in orchestra  fell out of use between 1750 and 1775, leaving the string section [[woodwind]]s became a self-contained section, consisting of [[clarinet]]s, [[oboe]]s, [[flute]]s and [[bassoon]]s.\n\nWhile vocal music such as [[comic opera]] was popular, great importance was given to instrumental music. The main kinds of instrumental music were the  [[sonata]], trio, [[string quartet]], [[symphony]], [[concerto]] (usually for a virtuoso solo instrument accompanied by orchestra), and light pieces such as [[serenade]]s and [[divertimento]]s. [[Sonata form]] developed and became the most important form. It was used to build up the first movement of most large-scale works in [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[string quartet]]s. Sonata form was also used in other movements and in single, standalone pieces such as [[overture]]s.\n\n== History ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}\n\n=== Baroque/Classical transition c. 1730\u20131760 ===\n{{See also|History of sonata form}}\n[[File:Joseph Siffred Duplessis - Christoph Willibald Gluck - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Gluck, detail of a portrait by [[Joseph Duplessis]], dated 1775 ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna)]]\nAt first the new style took over Baroque forms\u2014the ternary ''[[da capo aria]]'' and the ''[[sinfonia]]'' and ''[[concerto]]''\u2014but composed with simpler parts, more notated ornamentation, rather than the improvised ornaments that were common in the Baroque era, and more emphatic division of pieces into sections. However, over time, the new aesthetic caused radical changes in how pieces were put together, and the basic formal layouts changed. Composers from this period sought dramatic effects, striking melodies, and clearer textures. One of the big textural changes was a shift away from the complex, dense [[polyphony|polyphonic]] style of the Baroque, in which multiple interweaving melodic lines were played simultaneously, and towards [[homophony]], a lighter texture which uses a clear single melody line accompanied by chords.\n\nThe [[Italy|Italian]] composer [[Domenico Scarlatti]] was an important figure in the transition from Baroque to Classical style. His unique compositional style is strongly related to that of the early Classical period. He is best known for composing more than five hundred one-movement keyboard sonatas. In [[Spain]], [[Antonio Soler]] also produced valuable keyboard sonatas, more varied in form than those of Scarlatti, with some pieces in three or four movements.\n\nBaroque music generally uses many harmonic fantasies and polyphonic sections that focus less on the structure of the musical piece, and there was less emphasis on clear musical phrases. In the classical period, the harmonies became simpler. However, the structure of the piece, the phrases and small melodic or rhythmic motives, became much more important than in the Baroque period.\n[[File:Muzio Clementi - sonata in g minor no.3, op 50, 'didone abbandonata' - ii. adagio dolente.ogg|thumb|left|200px|[[Muzio Clementi]]'s Sonata in G minor, No.&nbsp;3, Op.&nbsp;50, \"Didone abbandonata\", adagio movement]]\nAnother important break with the past was the radical overhaul of [[opera]] by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], who cut away a great deal of the layering and improvisational ornaments and focused on the points of [[Modulation (music)|modulation]] and transition. By making these moments where the harmony changes more of a focus, he enabled powerful dramatic shifts in the emotional color of the music. To highlight these transitions, he used changes in instrumentation ([[orchestration]]), melody, and [[Musical mode|mode]]. Among the most successful composers of his time, Gluck spawned many emulators, one of whom was [[Antonio Salieri]]. Their emphasis on accessibility brought huge successes in opera, and in other vocal music such as songs, oratorios, and choruses. These were considered the most important kinds of music for performance and hence enjoyed greatest public success.\n\nThe phase between the Baroque and the rise of the Classical, with its broad mixture of competing ideas and attempts to unify the different demands of taste, economics and \"worldview\", goes by many names. It is sometimes called ''[[Galant]]'', ''[[Rococo]]'', or ''pre-Classical'', or at other times ''early Classical''{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. It is a period where some composers still working in the Baroque style flourish, though sometimes thought of as being more of the past than the present\u2014Bach, Handel, and Telemann all composed well beyond the point at which the homophonic style is clearly in the ascendant. Musical culture was caught at a crossroads: the masters of the older style had the technique, but the public hungered for the new. This is one of the reasons [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C. P. E. Bach]] was held in such high regard: he understood the older forms quite well and knew how to present them in new garb, with an enhanced variety of form.\n\n=== 1750\u20131775 ===\n{{See also|Symphony}}\n[[File:Haydn portrait by Thomas Hardy (small).jpg|thumb|left|Haydn portrait by [[Thomas Hardy (English painter)|Thomas Hardy]], 1792]]\n\nBy the late 1750s there were flourishing centers of the new style in Italy, Vienna, Mannheim, and Paris; dozens of symphonies were composed and there were bands of players associated with musical theatres. Opera or other vocal music accompanied by orchestra was the feature of most musical events, with concertos and symphonies (arising from the [[overture]]) serving as instrumental interludes and introductions for operas and church services. Over the course of the Classical period, symphonies and concertos developed and were presented independently of vocal music.\n[[File:Divertimento in E-flat major - KV 113 - 2nd movement.oga|thumb|right|200px|Mozart wrote a number of divertimentos, light instrumental pieces designed for entertainment. This is the 2nd movement of his Divertimento in E-flat major, K. 113.]]\nThe \"normal\" orchestra ensemble\u2014a body of [[String section|strings]] supplemented by winds\u2014and movements of particular rhythmic character were established by the late 1750s in Vienna. However, the length and weight of pieces was still set with some Baroque characteristics: individual movements still focused on one \"affect\" (musical mood) or had only one sharply contrasting middle section, and their length was not significantly greater than Baroque movements. There was not yet a clearly enunciated theory of how to compose in the new style. It was a moment ripe for a breakthrough.\n\nMany consider this breakthrough to have been made by C. P. E. Bach, Gluck, and several others. Indeed, C. P. E. Bach and Gluck are often considered founders of the Classical style. The first great master of the style was the composer [[Joseph Haydn]]. In the late 1750s he began composing symphonies, and by 1761 he had composed a triptych (''Morning'', ''Noon'', and ''Evening'') solidly in the contemporary mode. As a vice-[[Kapellmeister]] and later Kapellmeister, his output expanded: he composed over forty symphonies in the 1760s alone. And while his fame grew, as his orchestra was expanded and his compositions were copied and disseminated, his voice was only one among many.\n\nWhile some scholars suggest that Haydn was overshadowed by Mozart and Beethoven, it would be difficult to overstate Haydn's centrality to the new style, and therefore to the future of Western art music as a whole. At the time, before the pre-eminence of Mozart or Beethoven, and with Johann Sebastian Bach known primarily to connoisseurs of keyboard music, Haydn reached a place in music that set him above all other composers except perhaps the Baroque era's [[George Frideric Handel]]. Haydn took existing ideas, and radically altered how they functioned\u2014earning him the titles \"father of the [[symphony]]\" and \"father of the [[string quartet]]\".\n\nOne of the forces that worked as an impetus for his pressing forward was the first stirring of what would later be called [[Romanticism]]\u2014the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'', or \"storm and stress\" phase in the arts, a short period where obvious and dramatic emotionalism was a stylistic preference. Haydn accordingly wanted more dramatic contrast and more emotionally appealing melodies, with sharpened character and individuality in his pieces. This period faded away in music and literature: however, it influenced what came afterward and would eventually be a component of aesthetic taste in later decades.\n\nThe ''[[Symphony No. 45 (Haydn)|Farewell Symphony]]'', No. 45 in F{{music|sharp}} Minor, exemplifies Haydn's integration of the differing demands of the new style, with surprising sharp turns and a long slow adagio to end the work. In 1772, Haydn completed his Opus 20 set of six string quartets, in which he deployed the polyphonic techniques he had gathered from the previous Baroque era to provide structural coherence capable of holding together his melodic ideas. For some, this marks the beginning of the \"mature\" Classical style, in which the period of reaction against late Baroque complexity yielded to a period of integration Baroque and Classical elements.\n\n=== 1775\u20131790 ===\n{{See also|Musical development}}\n[[File:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|upright|thumb|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, posthumous painting by Barbara Krafft in 1819]]\n\nHaydn, having worked for over a decade as the music director for a prince, had far more resources and scope for composing than most other composers. His position also gave him the ability to shape the forces that would play his music, as he could select skilled musicians. This opportunity was not wasted, as Haydn, beginning quite early on his career, sought to press forward the technique of building and developing ideas in his music. His next important breakthrough was in the [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)|Opus 33 string quartets]] (1781), in which the melodic and the harmonic roles segue among the instruments: it is often momentarily unclear what is melody and what is harmony. This changes the way the ensemble works its way between dramatic moments of transition and climactic sections: the music flows smoothly and without obvious interruption. He then took this integrated style and began applying it to orchestral and vocal music.\n[[File:Don Giovanni Commendatore.png|thumb|left|400px|The opening bars of the Commendatore's aria in Mozart's opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. The orchestra starts with a dissonant [[diminished seventh]] chord (G# dim7 with a B in the bass) moving to a [[dominant seventh chord]] (A7 with a C# in the bass) before resolving to the [[tonic chord]] (D minor) at the singer's entrance.]]\nHaydn's gift to music was a way of composing, a way of structuring works, which was at the same time in accord with the governing aesthetic of the new style. However, a younger contemporary, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], brought his genius to Haydn's ideas and applied them to two of the major genres of the day: opera, and the virtuoso concerto. Whereas Haydn spent much of his working life as a court composer, Mozart wanted public success in the concert life of cities, playing for the general public. This meant he needed to write operas and write and perform virtuoso pieces. Haydn was not a virtuoso at the international touring level; nor was he seeking to create operatic works that could play for many nights in front of a large audience. Mozart wanted to achieve both. Moreover, Mozart also had a taste for more chromatic chords (and greater contrasts in harmonic language generally), a greater love for creating a welter of melodies in a single work, and a more Italianate sensibility in music as a whole. He found, in Haydn's music and later in his study of the polyphony of [[J.S. Bach]], the means to discipline and enrich his artistic gifts.\n[[File:Wolfgang01.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Mozart family c. 1780. The portrait on the wall is of Mozart's mother.]]\nMozart rapidly came to the attention of Haydn, who hailed the new composer, studied his works, and considered the younger man his only true peer in music. In Mozart, Haydn found a greater range of instrumentation, dramatic effect and melodic resource. The learning relationship moved in both directions. Mozart also had a great respect for the older, more experienced composer, and sought to learn from him.\n\nMozart's arrival in Vienna in 1780 brought an acceleration in the development of the Classical style. There, Mozart absorbed the fusion of Italianate brilliance and Germanic cohesiveness that had been brewing for the previous 20 years. His own taste for flashy brilliances, rhythmically complex melodies and figures, long cantilena melodies, and virtuoso flourishes was merged with an appreciation for formal coherence and internal connectedness. It is at this point that war and economic inflation halted a trend to larger orchestras and forced the disbanding or reduction of many theater orchestras. This pressed the Classical style inwards: toward seeking greater ensemble and technical challenges\u2014for example, scattering the melody across woodwinds, or using a melody harmonized in thirds. This process placed a premium on small ensemble music, called chamber music. It also led to a trend for more public performance, giving a further boost to the string quartet and other small ensemble groupings.\n\nIt was during this decade that public taste began, increasingly, to recognize that Haydn and Mozart had reached a high standard of composition. By the time Mozart arrived at age 25, in 1781, the dominant styles of Vienna were recognizably connected to the emergence in the 1750s of the early Classical style. By the end of the 1780s, changes in [[performance practice]], the relative standing of instrumental and vocal music, technical demands on musicians, and stylistic unity had become established in the composers who imitated Mozart and Haydn. During this decade Mozart composed his most famous operas, his six late symphonies that helped to redefine the genre, and a string of piano concerti that still stand at the pinnacle of these forms.\n\nOne composer who was influential in spreading the more serious style that Mozart and Haydn had formed is [[Muzio Clementi]], a gifted virtuoso pianist who tied with Mozart in a musical \"duel\" before the emperor in which they each improvised on the piano and performed their compositions. Clementi's sonatas for the piano circulated widely, and he became the most successful composer in [[London]] during the 1780s. Also in London at this time was [[Jan Ladislav Dussek]], who, like Clementi, encouraged piano makers to extend the range and other features of their instruments, and then fully exploited the newly opened up possibilities. The importance of London in the Classical period is often overlooked, but it served as the home to the [[Broadwood and Sons|Broadwood's]] factory for piano manufacturing and as the base for composers who, while less notable than the \"Vienna School\", had a decisive influence on what came later. They were composers of many fine works, notable in their own right. London's taste for virtuosity may well have encouraged the complex passage work and extended statements on tonic and dominant.\n\n=== Circa 1790\u20131820 ===\nWhen Haydn and Mozart began composing, symphonies were played as single movements\u2014before, between, or as interludes within other works\u2014and many of them lasted only ten or twelve minutes; instrumental groups had varying standards of playing, and the continuo was a central part of music-making.\n\nIn the intervening years, the social world of music had seen dramatic changes. International publication and touring had grown explosively, and concert societies formed. Notation became more specific, more descriptive\u2014and schematics for works had been simplified (yet became more varied in their exact working out). In 1790, just before Mozart's death, with his reputation spreading rapidly, Haydn was poised for a series of successes, notably his late oratorios and \"London\" symphonies.<!-- Mozart's reputation or Haydn's?--> Composers in [[Paris]], [[Rome]], and all over Germany turned to Haydn and Mozart for their ideas on form.\n[[File:Beethoven.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Beethoven by [[Joseph Karl Stieler]], 1820]]\n\nThe time was again ripe for a dramatic shift. In the 1790s, a new generation of composers, born around 1770, emerged. While they had grown up with the earlier styles, they heard in the recent works of Haydn and Mozart a vehicle for greater expression. In 1788 [[Luigi Cherubini]] settled in Paris and in 1791 composed ''Lodoiska'', an opera that raised him to fame. Its style is clearly reflective of the mature Haydn and Mozart, and its instrumentation gave it a weight that had not yet been felt in the [[grand opera]]. His contemporary [[\u00c9tienne M\u00e9hul]] extended instrumental effects with his 1790 opera ''Euphrosine et Coradin'', from which followed a series of successes. The final push towards change came from [[Gaspare Spontini]], who was deeply admired by future romantic composers such as Weber, Berlioz and Wagner. The innovative harmonic language of his operas, their refined instrumentation and their \"enchained\" closed numbers (a structural pattern which was later adopted by Weber in Euryanthe and from him handed down, through Marschner, to Wagner), formed the basis from which French and German romantic opera had its beginnings. \n[[File:Johann-nepomuk-hummel.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hummel in 1814]]\nThe most fateful of the new generation was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], who launched his numbered works in 1794 with a set of three piano trios, which remain in the repertoire. Somewhat younger than the others, though equally accomplished because of his youthful study under Mozart and his native virtuosity, was [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]]. Hummel studied under Haydn as well; he was a friend to Beethoven and [[Franz Schubert]]. He concentrated more on the piano than any other instrument, and his time in London in 1791 and 1792 generated the composition and publication in 1793 of three piano sonatas, opus 2, which idiomatically used Mozart's techniques of avoiding the expected cadence, and Clementi's sometimes modally uncertain virtuoso figuration. Taken together, these composers can be seen as the vanguard of a broad change in style and the center of music. They studied one another's works, copied one another's gestures in music, and on occasion behaved like quarrelsome rivals.\n\nThe crucial differences with the previous wave can be seen in the downward shift in melodies, increasing durations of movements, the acceptance of Mozart and Haydn as paradigmatic, the greater use of keyboard resources, the shift from \"vocal\" writing to \"pianistic\" writing, the growing pull of the minor and of modal ambiguity, and the increasing importance of varying accompanying figures to bring \"texture\" forward as an element in music. In short, the late Classical was seeking a music that was internally more complex. The growth of concert societies and amateur orchestras, marking the importance of music as part of middle-class life, contributed to a booming market for pianos, piano music, and virtuosi to serve as examplars. Hummel, Beethoven, and Clementi were all renowned for their improvising.\n\n<!-- provide reference...One explanation for the shift in style has been advanced by [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] and others:{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} the increasing centrality of the idea of [[theme and variations]] in compositional thinking. Schoenberg argues that the Classical style was one of \"continuing variation\", where a development was, in effect, a theme and variations with greater continuity. In any event, theme and variations replaced the [[fugue]] as the standard vehicle for improvising, and was often included, directly or indirectly, as a movement in longer instrumental works. -->\nDirect influence of the Baroque continued to fade: the [[figured bass]] grew less prominent as a means of holding performance together, the performance practices of the mid-18th century continued to die out. However, at the same time, complete editions of Baroque masters began to become available, and the influence of Baroque style continued to grow, particularly in the ever more expansive use of brass. Another feature of the period is the growing number of performances where the composer was not present. This led to increased detail and specificity in notation; for example, there were fewer \"optional\" parts that stood separately from the main score.\n\nThe force of these shifts became apparent with Beethoven's 3rd Symphony, given the name ''Eroica'', which is Italian for \"heroic\", by the composer. As with Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', it may not have been the first in all of its innovations, but its aggressive use of every part of the Classical style set it apart from its contemporary works: in length, ambition, and harmonic resources as well.\n\n==First Viennese School==\n[[File:Canaletto (I) 058.jpg|thumb|300px|View of Vienna in 1758, by [[Bernardo Bellotto]]]]\nThe [[First Viennese School]] is a name mostly used to refer to three composers of the Classical period in late-18th-century [[Vienna]]: Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. [[Franz Schubert]] is occasionally added to the list.\n\nIn German-speaking countries, the term ''Wiener Klassik'' (lit. ''Viennese classical era/art'') is used. That term is often more broadly applied to the Classical era in music as a whole, as a means to distinguish it from other periods that are colloquially referred to as ''classical'', namely [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Romantic music]].\n\nThe term \"Viennese School\" was first used by Austrian musicologist Raphael Georg Kiesewetter in 1834, although he only counted Haydn and Mozart as members of the school. Other writers followed suit, and eventually Beethoven was added to the list.<ref>{{GroveOnline|title=Classical|author=Heartz, Daniel|author2=Bruce Alan Brown|author2-link=Bruce Alan Brown|last-author-amp=yes|access-date=27 December 2006}}</ref> The designation \"first\" is added today to avoid confusion with the [[Second Viennese School]].\n\nWhilst, Schubert apart, these composers certainly knew each other (with Haydn and Mozart even being occasional chamber-music partners), there is no sense in which they were engaged in a collaborative effort in the sense that one would associate with 20th-century schools such as the Second Viennese School, or [[Les Six]]. Nor is there any significant sense in which one composer was \"schooled\" by another (in the way that Berg and Webern were taught by Schoenberg), though it is true that Beethoven for a time received lessons from Haydn.\n\nAttempts to extend the First Viennese School to include such later figures as [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] are merely journalistic, and never encountered in academic musicology.\n\n== Classical influence on later composers ==\n{{See also|Tonality}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}\n[[File:Franz Schubert by Wilhelm August Rieder 1875.jpg|upright|thumb|left|1875 oil painting of Franz Schubert by [[Wilhelm August Rieder]], after his own 1825 watercolor portrait]]\nMusical eras and their prevalent styles, forms and instruments seldom disappear at once; instead, features are replaced over time, until the old approach is simply felt as \"old-fashioned\". The Classical style did not \"die\" suddenly; rather, it gradually got phased out under the weight of changes. To give just one example, while it is generally stated that the Classical era stopped using the [[harpsichord]] in orchestras, this did not happen all of a sudden at the start of the Classical era in 1750. Rather, orchestras slowly stopped using the harpsichord to play [[basso continuo]] until the practice was discontinued by the end of the 1700s.\n[[File:Mendelssohn Bartholdy.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Felix Mendelssohn|Portrait of Mendelssohn by the English [[miniaturist]] James Warren Childe (1778\u20131862), 1839]]\nOne crucial change was the shift towards harmonies centering on \"flatward\" keys: shifts in the [[subdominant]] direction {{clarify|date=October 2015}}. In the Classical style, major key was far more common than minor, chromaticism being moderated through the use of [[sharpward modulation|\"sharpward\" modulation]] (e.g., a piece in C major modulating to G major, D major, or A major, all of which are keys with more sharps). As well, sections in the minor mode were often used for contrast. Beginning with Mozart and Clementi, there began a creeping colonization of the subdominant region (the ii or IV chord, which in the key of C major would be the keys of d minor or F major). With Schubert, subdominant modulations flourished after being introduced in contexts in which earlier composers would have confined themselves to dominant shifts (modulations to the [[dominant chord]], e.g., in the key of C major, modulating to G major). This introduced darker colors to music, strengthened the minor mode, and made structure harder to maintain. Beethoven contributed to this by his increasing use of the [[Interval (music)|fourth]] as a consonance, and modal ambiguity\u2014for example, the opening of the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9 in D minor]].\n\n[[Franz Schubert]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], and [[John Field (composer)|John Field]] are among the most prominent in this generation of \"Proto-Romantics\", along with the young [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. Their sense of form was strongly influenced by the Classical style. While they were not yet \"learned\" composers (imitating rules which were codified by others), they directly responded to works by Beethoven, Mozart, Clementi, and others, as they encountered them. The instrumental forces at their disposal in orchestras were also quite \"Classical\" in number and variety, permitting similarity with Classical works.\n\nHowever, the forces destined to end the hold of the Classical style gathered strength in the works of many of the above composers, particularly Beethoven. The most commonly cited one is harmonic innovation. Also important is the increasing focus on having a continuous and rhythmically uniform accompanying figuration: [[Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata]] was the model for hundreds of later pieces\u2014where the shifting movement of a rhythmic figure provides much of the drama and interest of the work, while a melody drifts above it. Greater knowledge of works, greater instrumental expertise, increasing variety of instruments, the growth of concert societies, and the unstoppable domination of the increasingly more powerful piano (which was given a bolder, louder tone by technological developments such as the use of steel strings, heavy cast-iron frames and sympathetically vibrating strings) all created a huge audience for sophisticated music. All of these trends contributed to the shift to the \"Romantic\" style.\n\nDrawing the line between these two styles is very difficult: some sections of Mozart's later works, taken alone, are indistinguishable in harmony and orchestration from music written 80 years later\u2014and some composers continued to write in normative Classical styles into the early 20th century. Even before Beethoven's death, composers such as [[Louis Spohr]] were self-described Romantics, incorporating, for example, more extravagant [[chromaticism]] in their works (e.g., using chromatic harmonies in a piece's [[chord progression]]). Conversely, works such as [[Symphony No. 5 (Schubert)|Schubert's Symphony No. 5]], written during the chronological dawn of the [[Romantic period (music)|Romantic]] era, exhibit a deliberately anachronistic artistic paradigm, harking back to the compositional style of several decades before.\n\nHowever, Vienna's fall as the most important musical center for orchestral composition during the late 1820s, precipitated by the deaths of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], marked the Classical style's final eclipse\u2014and the end of its continuous organic development of one composer learning in close proximity to others. [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] visited Vienna when they were young, but they then moved on to other cities. Composers such as [[Carl Czerny]], while deeply influenced by Beethoven, also searched for new ideas and new forms to contain the larger world of musical expression and performance in which they lived.\n\nRenewed interest in the formal balance and restraint of 18th century classical music led in the early 20th century to the development of so-called [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassical]] style, which numbered [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]] among its proponents, at least at certain times in their careers.\n\n==Classical period instruments==\n[[File:FortepianoByMcNultyAfterWalter1805.jpg|thumb|upright|Fortepiano by Paul McNulty after Walter & Sohn, c. 1805]]\n{{See also|List of period instruments}}\n\n===Guitar===\nThe Baroque guitar, with four or five sets of double strings or \"courses\" and elaborately decorated soundhole, was a very different instrument from the early [[classical guitar]] which more closely resembles the modern instrument with the standard six strings.

An Annotated Bibliography of Guitar Methods, 1760\u20131860 (Hillsdale, NY: Pendragon Press, 2010), xi.</ref>\n\n===Strings===\nIn the Baroque era, there was more variety in the bowed stringed instruments used in ensembles, with instruments such as the [[viola d'amore]] and a range of fretted [[viol]]s being used, ranging from small viols to large bass viols. In the Classical period, the [[string section]] of the orchestra was standardized as just four instruments:\n\n* [[Violin]] (in orchestras and chamber music, typically there are first violins and second violins, with the former playing the melody and/or a higher line and the latter playing either a countermelody, a harmony part, a part below the first violin line in pitch, or an accompaniment line)\n* [[Viola]] (the alto voice of the orchestral string section and string quartet; it often performs \"inner voices\", which are accompaniment lines which fill in the [[harmony]] of the piece)\n* [[Cello]] (the cello plays two roles in Classical era music; at times it is used to play the [[bassline]] of the piece, typically doubled by the [[double bass]]es [Note: When cellos and double basses read the same bassline, the basses play an octave below the cellos, because the bass is a transposing instrument]; and at other times it performs melodies and solos in the lower register)\n* [[Double bass]] (the bass typically performs the lowest pitches in the string section in order to provide the bassline for the piece)\n\nIn the Baroque era, the double bass players were not usually given a separate part; instead, they typically played the same [[basso continuo]] [[bassline]] that the cellos and other low-pitched instruments (e.g., [[theorbo]], [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]] wind instrument, [[viol]]s), albeit an octave below the cellos, because the double bass is a transposing instrument that sounds one octave lower than it is written. In the Classical era, some composers continued to write only one bass part for their symphony, labeled \"bassi\"; this bass part was played by cellists and double bassists. During the Classical era, some composers began to give the double basses their own part.\n\n===Woodwinds===\n* [[Basset clarinet]]\n* [[Basset horn]]\n* [[Clarinette d'amour]]\n* Classical [[clarinet]]\n* [[Chalumeau]]\n* Flute\n* Oboe\n* Bassoon\n\n===Percussion===\n* [[Timpani]]\n* \"[[Turkish music (style)|Turkish music]]\":\n**[[Bass drum]]\n**[[Cymbal]]s\n**[[Triangle (musical instrument)|Triangle]]\n\n===Keyboards===\n* [[Clavichord]]\n* [[Fortepiano]] (the forerunner to the modern piano)\n* [[Piano]]\n* [[Harpsichord]], the standard Baroque era [[basso continuo]] keyboard instrument, was used until the 1750s, after which time it was gradually phased out, and replaced with the [[fortepiano]] and then the [[piano]].

The low cost of digital representation of data in modern computer systems allows more elaborate character codes (such as [[Unicode]]) which represent most of the characters used in many written languages. Character encoding using internationally accepted standards permits worldwide interchange of text in electronic form.\n\n==History==\nEarly binary repertoires include [[Bacon's cipher]], [[Braille]], [[International maritime signal flags]], and the 4-digit encoding of Chinese characters for a [[Chinese telegraph code]] ([[Hans Schjellerup]], 1869). Common examples of character encoding systems include [[Morse code]], the [[Baudot code]], the American Standard Code for Information Interchange ([[ASCII]]) and [[Unicode]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blog.smartbear.com/development/ancient-computer-character-code-tables-and-why-theyre-still-relevant/ | title=Ancient Computer Character Code Tables \u2013 and Why They're Still Relevant | publisher=Smartbear | date=17 April 2014 | accessdate=29 April 2014 | author=Tom Henderson}}</ref>\n\n[[Morse code]] was introduced in the 1840s and is used to encode each letter of the [[Latin alphabet]], each [[Arabic numeral]], and some other characters via a series of long and short presses of a [[telegraph key]]. Representations of characters encoded using Morse code varied in length.\n\nThe [[Baudot code]], a five-bit encoding, was created by [[\u00c9mile Baudot]] in 1870, patented in 1874, modified by Donald Murray in 1901, and standardized by CCITT as International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2) in 1930.\n\n[[Fieldata]], a six-or seven-bit code, was introduced by the U.S. Army Signal Corps in the late 1950s.\n\n[[IBM]]'s [[Binary-coded decimal#IBM and BCD|Binary Coded Decimal]] ([[BCD (character encoding)|BCD]]) was a six-bit encoding scheme used by IBM in as early as 1959 in its [[IBM 1401|1401]] and [[IBM 1620|1620]] computers, and in its [[IBM 700/7000 series|7000 Series]] (for example, 704, 7040, 709 and 7090 computers), as well as in associated peripherals. BCD extended existing simple four-bit numeric encoding to include alphabetic and special characters, mapping it easily to punch-card encoding which was already in widespread use. It was the precursor to EBCDIC.\n\n[[ASCII]] was introduced in 1963 and is a seven-bit encoding scheme used to encode letters, numerals, symbols, and device [[control code]]s as fixed-length codes using [[integer]]s.\n\n[[IBM]]'s [[EBCDIC|Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code]] (usually abbreviated as EBCDIC) is an eight-bit encoding scheme developed in 1963.\n\nThe limitations of such sets soon became apparent,{{to whom|date=September 2018}} and a number of ''ad hoc'' methods were developed to extend them. The need to support more [[writing system]]s for different languages, including the [[CJK characters|CJK]] family of [[East Asian scripts]], required support for a far larger number of characters and demanded a systematic approach to character encoding rather than the previous ''ad hoc'' approaches.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} \n\nIn trying to develop universally interchangeable character encodings, researchers in the 1980s faced the dilemma that on the one hand, it seemed necessary to add more bits to accommodate additional characters, but on the other hand, for the users of the relatively small character set of the Latin alphabet (who still constituted the majority of computer users), those additional bits were a colossal waste of then-scarce and expensive computing resources (as they would always be zeroed out for such users).\n\nThe compromise solution that was eventually found and developed into Unicode was to break the assumption (dating back to telegraph codes) that each character should always directly correspond to a particular sequence of bits. Instead, characters would first be mapped to a universal intermediate representation in the form of abstract numbers called [[code point]]s. Code points would then be represented in a variety of ways and with various default numbers of bits per character (code units) depending on context. To encode code points higher than the length of the code unit, such as above 256 for 8-bit units, the solution was to implement [[variable-width encoding]]s where an escape sequence would signal that subsequent bits should be parsed as a higher code point.\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:KB Dubeolsik for Old Hangul (NG3).svg|thumb|365x365px]]\nTerminology related to code unit:\n* A ''character'' is a minimal unit of text that has semantic value.\n* A ''character set'' is a collection of characters that might be used by multiple languages. \n''Example:'' The Latin character set is used by English and most European languages, though the Greek character set is used only by the Greek language.\n* A ''coded character set'' is a character set in which each character corresponds to a unique number.\n* A ''code point'' of a coded character set is any allowed value in the character set.\n* A ''code unit'' is a bit sequence used to encode each character of a repertoire within a given encoding form.\n\n; Character repertoire (the abstract set of characters):\n\nThe character repertoire is an abstract set of more than one million characters found in a wide variety of scripts including ''Latin, Cyrillic, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Hebrew, and Aramaic''.\n\nOther symbols such as musical notation are also included in the character repertoire. Both the Unicode and [[GB18030]] standards have a character repertoire. As new characters are added to one standard, the other standard also adds those characters, to maintain parity.\n\nThe code unit size is equivalent to the bit measurement for the particular encoding:\n* A code unit in [[US-ASCII]] consists of 7 bits;\n* A code unit in [[UTF-8]], [[EBCDIC]] and GB18030 consists of 8 bits;\n* A code unit in [[UTF-16]] consists of 16 bits;\n* A code unit in [[UTF-32]] consists of 32 bits.\n\n''Example of a code unit:'' Consider a ''[[String (computer science)|string]]'' of the letters \"abc\" followed by {{unichar|10400|DESERET CAPITAL LETTER LONG I}} (represented with 1 char32_t, 2 char16_t or 4 char8_t). That string contains:\n* four characters;\n* four code points\n* either:\n*: four code units in UTF-32 (00000061, 00000062, 00000063, 00010400)\n*: five code units in UTF-16 (0061, 0062, 0063, d801, dc00), or\n*: seven code units in UTF-8  (61, 62, 63, f0, 90, 90, 80).\n\nTo express a character in Unicode, the hexadecimal value is prefixed with the string 'U+'. The range of valid code points for the Unicode standard is U+0000 to U+10FFFF, inclusive, divided in 17 [[Plane (Unicode)|planes]], identified by the numbers 0 to 16. Characters in the range U+0000 to U+FFFF are in the plane 0, called the ''[[Plane (Unicode)#Basic Multilingual Plane|Basic Multilingual Plane]]'' (BMP). This plane contains most commonly-used characters. Characters in the range U+10000 to U+10FFFF in the other planes are called ''[[supplementary characters]]''.\n\nThe following table shows examples of code point values:\n{| class=\"wikitable MsoNormalTable\"\n! Character\n! Unicode code point\n! Glyph\n|-\n| Latin A\n| U+0041\n|\u0391\n|-\n| Latin sharp S\n| U+00DF\n| \u00df\n|-\n| Han for East\n| U+6771\n|\u6771\n|-\n| Ampersand\n| U+0026\n| &\n|-\n|Inverted exclamation mark\n|U+00A1\n|\u00a1\n|-\n|Section sign\n|U+00A7\n|\u00a7\n|}\n\nA code point is represented by a sequence of code units. The mapping is defined by the encoding. Thus, the number of code units required to represent a code point depends on the encoding:\n* ''UTF-8:'' code points map to a sequence of one, two, three or four code units.\n* ''UTF-16:'' code units are twice as long as 8-bit code units. Therefore, any code point with a scalar value less than U+10000 are encoded with a single code unit. Code points with a value U+10000 or higher require two code units each. These pairs of code units have a unique term in UTF-16: [[UTF-16#cite note-Unicode7Ch3s8-5|\"Unicode surrogate pairs\".]]\n* ''UTF-32:'' the 32-bit code unit is large enough that every code point is represented as a single code unit.\n* ''GB18030:'' multiple code units per code point are common, because of the small code units. Code points are mapped to one, two, or four code units.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/text/terminology.html | title=The Java Tutorials - Terminology | publisher=Oracle | accessdate=25 March 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|CCS}}Unicode encoding model==\n[[Unicode]] and its parallel standard, the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]], together constitute a modern, unified character encoding. Rather than mapping characters directly to octets ([[byte]]s), they separately define what characters are available, corresponding natural numbers ([[code point]]s), how those numbers are encoded as a series of fixed-size natural numbers (code units), and finally how those units are encoded as a stream of octets. The purpose of this decomposition is to establish a universal set of characters that can be encoded in a variety of ways.<ref name=utr17>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr17/ |title=Unicode Technical Report #17: Unicode Character Encoding Model |date=11 November 2008 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}</ref> To describe this model correctly requires more precise terms than \"character set\" and \"character encoding.\" The terms used in the modern model follow:<ref name=utr17/>\n\nA '''character repertoire''' is the full set of abstract characters that a system supports. The repertoire may be closed, i.e. no additions are allowed without creating a new standard (as is the case with ASCII and most of the ISO-8859 series), or it may be open, allowing additions (as is the case with Unicode and to a limited extent the [[Windows code page]]s). The characters in a given repertoire reflect decisions that have been made about how to divide writing systems into basic information units. The basic variants of the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Cyrillic]] alphabets can be broken down into letters, digits, punctuation, and a few ''special characters'' such as the space, which can all be arranged in simple linear sequences that are displayed in the same order they are read. But even with these alphabets, [[diacritic]]s pose a complication: they can be regarded either as part of a single character containing a letter and diacritic (known as a precomposed character), or as separate characters. The former allows a far simpler text handling system but the latter allows any letter/diacritic combination to be used in text. [[Typographic ligature|Ligatures]] pose similar problems. Other writing systems, such as Arabic and Hebrew, are represented with more complex character repertoires due to the need to accommodate things like bidirectional text and [[glyph]]s that are joined together in different ways for different situations.\n\nA '''coded character set''' (CCS) is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that maps characters to ''[[code point]]s'' (each code point represents one character). For example, in a given repertoire, the capital letter \"A\" in the Latin alphabet might be represented by the code point 65, the character \"B\" to 66, and so on. Multiple coded character sets may share the same repertoire; for example [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]] and IBM code pages 037 and 500 all cover the same repertoire but map them to different code points.\n\nA '''character encoding form''' (CEF) is the mapping of code points to ''code units'' to facilitate storage in a system that represents numbers as bit sequences of fixed length (i.e. practically any computer system). For example, a system that stores numeric information in 16-bit units can only directly represent code points 0 to 65,535 in each unit, but larger code points (say, 65,536 to 1.4&nbsp;million) could be represented by using multiple 16-bit units. This correspondence is defined by a CEF.\n\nNext, a '''character encoding scheme''' (CES) is the mapping of code units to a sequence of octets to facilitate storage on an octet-based file system or transmission over an octet-based network. Simple character encoding schemes include [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16BE]], [[UTF-32BE]], [[UTF-16LE]] or [[UTF-32LE]]; compound character encoding schemes, such as [[UTF-16]], [[UTF-32]] and [[ISO/IEC 2022]], switch between several simple schemes by using [[byte order mark]]s or [[escape sequence]]s; compressing schemes try to minimise the number of bytes used per code unit (such as [[Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode|SCSU]], [[Binary Ordered Compression for Unicode|BOCU]], and [[Punycode]]).\n\nAlthough [[UTF-32BE]] is a simpler CES, most systems working with Unicode use either [[UTF-8]], which is [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with fixed-width ASCII and maps Unicode code points to variable-width sequences of octets, or [[UTF-16BE]], which is [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with fixed-width UCS-2BE and maps Unicode code points to variable-width sequences of 16-bit words. See [[comparison of Unicode encodings]] for a detailed discussion.\n\nFinally, there may be a '''higher level protocol''' which supplies additional information to select the particular variant of a [[Unicode]] character, particularly where there are regional variants that have been 'unified' in Unicode as the same character. An example is the [[XML]] attribute xml:lang.\n\nThe Unicode model uses the term '''character map''' for historical systems which directly assign a sequence of characters to a sequence of bytes, covering all of CCS, CEF and CES layers.<ref name=\"utr17\" />\n\n== Character sets, character maps and code pages ==\nHistorically, the terms \"character encoding\", \"character map\", \"character set\" and \"[[code page]]\" were synonymous in [[computer science]], as the same standard would specify a repertoire of characters and how they were to be encoded into a stream of code units \u2013 usually with a single character per code unit. But now the terms have related but distinct meanings,<ref name=\"SteeleMSDN\">{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/shawnste/2005/03/15/whats-the-difference-between-an-encoding-code-page-character-set-and-unicode/|author=Shawn Steele|title=What's the difference between an Encoding, Code Page, Character Set and Unicode?|date=15 March 2005|website=MSDN}}</ref> due to efforts by standards bodies to use precise terminology when writing about and unifying many different encoding systems.<ref name=utr17/> Regardless, the terms are still used interchangeably, with ''character set'' being nearly ubiquitous.\n\nA \"'''code page'''\" usually means a [[byte oriented|byte-oriented]] encoding, but with regard to some suite of encodings (covering different scripts), where many characters share the same [[code point|codes]] in most or all those code pages. Well-known code page suites are \"Windows\" (based on Windows-1252) and \"IBM\"/\"DOS\" (based on [[code page 437]]), see [[Windows code page]] for details. Most, but not all, encodings referred to as code pages are single-byte encodings (but see [[Octet (computing)|octet]] on byte size.)\n\nIBM's Character Data Representation Architecture (CDRA) designates with coded character set identifiers ([[CCSID]]s) and each of which is variously called a \"charset\", \"character set\", \"code page\", or \"CHARMAP\".<ref name=utr17/>\n\nThe term \"code page\" does not occur in Unix or Linux where \"charmap\" is preferred, usually in the larger context of locales.\n\nContrasted to [[#CCS|CCS above]], a \"character encoding\" is a map from abstract characters to [[code word]]s. A \"character set\" in [[HTTP]] (and [[MIME]]) parlance is the same as a character encoding (but not the same as CCS).\n\n\"[[legacy system|Legacy]] encoding\" is a term sometimes used to characterize old character encodings, but with an ambiguity of sense. Most of its use is in the context of [[Unicode|Unicodification]], where it refers to encodings that fail to cover all Unicode code points, or, more generally, using a somewhat different character repertoire: several code points representing one Unicode character,<ref>[http://www.basistech.co.jp/knowledge-center/database/uc-trillium-2.ppt \"Processing database information using Unicode, a case study\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617193918/http://www.basistech.co.jp/knowledge-center/database/uc-trillium-2.ppt |date=17 June 2006 }}</ref> or versa (see e.g. [[code page 437]]). Some sources refer to an encoding as ''legacy'' only because it preceded Unicode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=IWS-Chapter03#79e846db|publisher=[[SIL International]]|title=Character set encoding basics|work=Implementing Writing Systems: An introduction|first=Peter|last=Constable|date=13 June 2001|accessdate=19 March 2010}}</ref> All Windows code pages are usually referred to as legacy, both because they antedate Unicode and because they are unable to represent all 2<sup>21</sup> possible Unicode code points.\n\n== Character encoding translation ==\nAs a result of having many character encoding methods in use (and the need for backward compatibility with archived data), many computer programs have been developed to translate data between encoding schemes as a form of data [[transcoding]].

applications|Non-printing character in word processors}}\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2007}}\nIn [[computing]] and [[telecommunication]], a '''control [[Character (computing)|character]]''' or '''non-printing character''' is a [[code point]] (a [[number]]) in a [[character encoding|character set]], that does not represent a written symbol. They are used as [[in-band signaling]] to cause effects other than the addition of a symbol to the text. All other characters are mainly '''printing''', '''printable''', or '''[[graphic character]]s''', except perhaps for the \"space\" character (see [[ASCII printable characters]]).\n\nAll entries in the [[ASCII]] table below code 32 (technically the [[C0 and C1 control codes|C0]] control code set) are of this kind, including [[newline|CR and LF]] used to separate lines of text. The code 127 ([[Delete character|DEL]]) is also a control character. [[Extended ASCII]] sets defined by [[ISO 8859]] added the codes 128 through 159 as control characters, this was primarily done so that if the high bit was stripped it would not change a printing character to a C0 control code, but there have been some assignments here, in particular [[newline|NEL]]. This second set is called the [[C0 and C1 control codes|C1]] set.\n\nThese 65 control codes were carried over to [[Unicode]]. Unicode added more characters that could be considered controls, but it makes a distinction between these \"Formatting characters\" (such as the [[Zero-width non-joiner]]), and the 65 Control characters.\n\nThe [[Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code]] (EBCDIC) character set contains 65 control codes, including all of the ASCII control codes as well as additional codes which are mostly used to control IBM peripherals.\n{| class=\"infobox\"  \n|-\n! <ref>MS-DOS QBasic v1.1 Documentation.

Used as the end of line marker in most [[Unix|UNIX systems]] and variants. \n* 11 ([[Tab key|vertical tab]], <code>VT</code>, <code>[[\\v]]</code>, <code>[[^K]]</code>), vertical tabulation.\n* 12 ([[Page break|form feed]], <code>FF</code>, <code>[[\\f]]</code>, <code>[[^L]]</code>), to cause a printer to eject paper to the top of the next page, or a video terminal to clear the screen.\n* 13 ([[carriage return]], <code>CR</code>, <code>[[\\r]]</code>, <code>[[^M]]</code>), moves the printing position to the start of the line, allowing overprinting. Used as the end of line marker in [[Classic Mac OS]], [[OS-9]], [[FLEX (operating system)|FLEX]] (and variants). A <code>CR+LF</code> pair is used by [[CP/M]]-80 and its derivatives including [[DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and by [[Application Layer]] [[communications protocol|protocols]] such as [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]], and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]].\n* 26 ([[Control-Z]], <code>SUB</code>, <code>EOF</code>, <code>[[^Z]]</code>). Acts as an end-of-file for the Windows text-mode file i/o.\n* 27 ([[escape character|escape]], <code>ESC</code>, <code>[[\\e]]</code> ([[GCC (software)|GCC]] only), <code>^[</code>). Introduces an [[escape sequence]].\n\nYou may often see control characters described as doing something when the user inputs them, such as code 3 ([[End-of-Text character]], ETX, <code>[[^C]]</code>) to interrupt the running process, or code 4 ([[End of transmission]], EOT, <code>[[^D]]</code>), used to end text input or to exit a [[Unix shell]]. These uses usually have little to do with their use when they are in text being output, and on modern systems usually do not involve the transmission of the code number at all (instead the program gets the fact that the user is holding down the Ctrl key and pushing the key marked with a 'C').\n\nThere were quite a few control characters defined (33 in ASCII, and the ECMA-48 standard adds 32 more). This was because early terminals had very primitive mechanical or electrical controls that made any kind of state-remembering api quite expensive to implement, thus a different code for each and every function looked like a requirement. It quickly became possible and inexpensive to interpret sequences of codes to perform a function, and device makers found a way to send hundreds of device instructions. Specifically, they used ASCII code 27 (escape), followed by a series of characters called a \"control sequence\" or \"escape sequence\". The mechanism was invented by [[Bob Bemer]], the father of ASCII. For example, the sequence of code 27, followed by the printable characters <nowiki>\"[2;10H\"</nowiki>, would cause a [[VT100|DEC VT-102]] terminal to move its [[cursor (computers)|cursor]] to the 10th cell of the 2nd line of the screen. Several standards exist for these sequences, notably [[ANSI X3.64]]. But the number of non-standard variations in use is large, especially among printers, where technology has advanced far faster than any standards body can possibly keep up with.\n\n==In Unicode==\n{{main|Unicode control characters}}\nIn Unicode, \"Control-characters\" are U+0000&mdash;U+001F (C0 controls), U+007F (delete), and U+0080&mdash;U+009F (C1 controls). Their [[Unicode Character Properties#General Category|General Category]] is \"Cc\". Formatting codes are distinct, in General Category \"Cf\". The Cc control characters have no Name in Unicode, but are given labels such as \"<control-001A>\" instead.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/ch04.pdf |title=The Unicode\u00ae Standard Version 11.0 \u2013 Core Specification |section=4.8 Name |publisher=Unicode, Inc. |mode=cs1}}</ref>\n\n==Display==\nThere are a number of techniques to display non-printing characters, which may be illustrated with the [[bell character]] in [[ASCII]] encoding:\n* [[Code point]]: decimal 7, hexadecimal 0x07\n* An abbreviation, often three capital letters: BEL\n* A special character condensing the abbreviation: Unicode U+2407 (\u2407), \"symbol for bell\"\n* An [[ISO 2047]] graphical representation: Unicode U+237E (\u237e), \"graphic for bell\"\n* [[Caret notation]] in ASCII, where code point 00xxxxx is represented as a caret followed by the capital letter at code point 10xxxxx: ^G\n* An [[escape sequence]], as in [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] character string codes: <tt>\\a</tt>, <tt>\\007</tt>, <tt>\\x07</tt>, etc.\n\n==How control characters map to keyboards==\nASCII-based [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] have a key labelled \"[[control key|Control]]\", \"Ctrl\", or (rarely) \"Cntl\" which is used much like a shift key, being pressed in combination with another letter or symbol key. In one implementation, the control key generates the code 64 places below the code for the (generally) uppercase letter it is pressed in combination with (i.e., subtract 64 from ASCII code value in decimal of the (generally) uppercase letter).  The other implementation is to take the ASCII code produced by the key and [[bitwise operation|bitwise AND]] it with 31, forcing bits 6 and 7 to zero.  For example, pressing \"control\" and the letter \"g\" or \"G\" (code 107 in [[octal]] or 71 in [[decimal|base 10]], which is 01000111 in [[Binary numeral system|binary]], produces the code 7 (Bell, 7 in base 10, or 00000111 in binary).  The NULL character (code 0) is represented by Ctrl-@, \"@\" being the code immediately before \"A\" in the ASCII character set.  For convenience, a lot of terminals accept Ctrl-Space as an alias for Ctrl-@.  In either case, this produces one of the 32 ASCII control codes between 0 and 31.  This approach is not able to represent the DEL character because of its value (code 127), but Ctrl-? is often used for this character, as subtracting 64 from a '?' gives \u22121, which if masked to 7 bits is 127.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/dtmcbride/tech/charsets/ascii.html |title=ASCII Characters |accessdate=2010-10-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028135111/http://geocities.com/dtmcbride/tech/charsets/ascii.html |archivedate=October 28, 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n\nWhen the control key is held down, letter keys produce the same control characters regardless of the state of the [[shift key|shift]] or [[caps lock]] keys.  In other words, it does not matter whether the key would have produced an upper-case or a lower-case letter.  The interpretation of the control key with the space, graphics character, and digit keys (ASCII codes 32 to 63) vary between systems.  Some will produce the same character code as if the control key were not held down.  Other systems translate these keys into control characters when the control key is held down.  The interpretation of the control key with non-ASCII (\"foreign\") keys also varies between systems.\n\nControl characters are often rendered into a printable form known as [[caret notation]] by printing a caret (^) and then the ASCII character that has a value of the control character plus 64.  Control characters generated using letter keys are thus displayed with the upper-case form of the letter.  For example, ^G represents code 7, which is generated by pressing the G key when the control key is held down.\n\nKeyboards also typically have a few single keys which produce control character codes. For example, the key labelled \"Backspace\" typically produces code 8, \"Tab\" code 9, \"Enter\" or \"Return\" code 13 (though some keyboards might produce code 10 for \"Enter\").\n\nMany keyboards include keys that do not correspond to any ASCII printable or control character, for example cursor control arrows and [[word processing]] functions.  The associated keypresses are communicated to computer programs by one of four methods: appropriating otherwise unused control characters; using some encoding other than ASCII; using multi-character control sequences; or using an additional mechanism outside of generating characters. \"Dumb\" [[computer terminal]]s typically use control sequences.  Keyboards attached to stand-alone [[personal computer]]s made in the 1980s typically use one (or both) of the first two methods.  Modern computer keyboards generate [[scancode]]s that identify the specific physical keys that are pressed; computer software then determines how to handle the keys that are pressed, including any of the four methods described above.\n\n==The design purpose==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe control characters were designed to fall into a few groups: printing and display control, data structuring, transmission control, and miscellaneous.\n\n===Printing and display control===\nPrinting control characters were first used to control the physical mechanism of printers, the earliest output device.  An early implementation of this idea was the [[Out-of-band data|out-of-band]] [[ASA carriage control characters]].  Later, control characters were integrated into the stream of data to be printed.\nThe carriage return character (CR), when sent to such a device, causes it to put the character at the edge of the paper at which writing begins (it may, or may not, also move the printing position to the next line).\nThe line feed character (LF/NL) causes the device to put the printing position on the next line. It may (or may not), depending on the device and its configuration, also move the printing position to the start of the next line (which would be the leftmost position for [[left-to-right]] scripts, such as the alphabets used for Western languages, and the rightmost position for [[right-to-left]] scripts such as the Hebrew and Arabic alphabets). \nThe vertical and horizontal tab characters (VT and HT/TAB) cause the output device to move the printing position to the next tab stop in the direction of reading. \nThe form feed character (FF/NP) starts a new sheet of paper, and may or may not move to the start of the first line. \nThe backspace character (BS) moves the printing position one character space  backwards. On printers, this is most often used so the printer can overprint characters to make other, not normally available, characters. On terminals and other electronic output devices, there are often software (or hardware) configuration choices which will allow a destruct backspace (i.e., a BS, SP, BS sequence) which erases, or a non-destructive one which does not. \nThe shift in and shift out characters (SO and SI) selected alternate character sets, fonts, underlining or other printing modes. Escape sequences were often used to do the same thing.\n\nWith the advent of [[computer terminal]]s that did not physically print on paper and so offered more flexibility regarding screen placement, erasure, and so forth, printing control codes were adapted. Form feeds, for example, usually cleared the screen, there being no new paper page to move to. More complex escape sequences were developed to take advantage of the flexibility of the new terminals, and indeed of newer printers. The concept of a control character had always been somewhat limiting, and was extremely so when used with new, much more flexible, hardware. Control sequences (sometimes implemented as escape sequences) could match the new flexibility and power and became the standard method. However, there were, and remain, a large variety of standard sequences to choose from.\n\n===Data structuring===\nThe separators (File, Group, Record, and Unit: FS, GS, RS and US) were made to structure data, usually on a tape, in order to simulate [[punched card]]s.\nEnd of medium (EM) warns that the tape (or other recording medium) is ending.\nWhile many systems use CR/LF and TAB for structuring data, it is possible to encounter the separator control characters in data that needs to be structured.  The separator control characters are not overloaded; there is no general use of them except to separate data into structured groupings.  Their numeric values are contiguous with the space character, which can be considered a member of the group, as a word separator.\n\n===Transmission control===\nThe transmission control characters were intended to structure a data stream, and to manage re-transmission or graceful failure, as needed, in the face of transmission errors.\n\nThe start of heading (SOH) character was to mark a non-data section of a data stream\u2014the part of a stream containing addresses and other housekeeping data. The start of text character (STX) marked the end of the header, and the start of the textual part of a stream. The end of text character (ETX) marked the end of the data of a message. A widely used convention is to make the two characters preceding ETX a checksum or [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] for error-detection purposes. The end of transmission block character (ETB) was used to indicate the end of a block of data, where data was divided into such blocks for transmission purposes.\n\nThe escape character ([[escape character|ESC]]) was intended to \"quote\" the next character, if it was another control character it would print it instead of performing the control function. It is almost never used for this purpose today.\n\nThe substitute character ([[substitute character|SUB]]) was intended to request a translation of the next character from a printable character to another value, usually by setting bit 5 to zero. This is handy because some media (such as sheets of paper produced by typewriters) can transmit only printable characters. However, on MS-DOS systems with files opened in text mode, \"end of text\" or \"end of file\" is marked by this [[Control-Z|Ctrl-Z]] character, instead of the [[Control-C|Ctrl-C]] or [[End-of-transmission character|Ctrl-D]], which are common on other operating systems.\n\nThe cancel character ([[cancel character|CAN]]) signalled that the previous element should be discarded. The negative acknowledge character ([[negative-acknowledge character|NAK]]) is a definite flag for, usually, noting that reception was a problem, and, often, that the current element should be sent again.  The acknowledge character ([[acknowledge character|ACK]]) is normally used as a flag to indicate no problem detected with current element.\n\nWhen a transmission medium is half duplex (that is, it can transmit in only one direction at a time), there is usually a master station that can transmit at any time, and one or more slave stations that transmit when they have permission. The enquire character ([[Enquiry character|ENQ]]) is generally used by a master station to ask a slave station to send its next message. A slave station indicates that it has completed its transmission by sending the end of transmission character ([[end-of-transmission character|EOT]]).\n\nThe device control codes (DC1 to DC4) were originally generic, to be implemented as necessary by each device. However, a universal need in data transmission is to request the sender to stop transmitting when a receiver is temporarily unable to accept any more data. [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] invented a convention which used 19 (the device control 3 character ([[Software flow control|DC3]]), also known as control-S, or [[Software flow control|XOFF]]) to \"S\"top transmission, and 17 (the device control 1 character ([[Software flow control|DC1]]), a.k.a. control-Q, or [[Software flow control|XON]]) to start transmission. It has become so widely used that most don't realize it is not part of official ASCII. This technique, however implemented, avoids additional wires in the data cable devoted only to transmission management, which saves money. A sensible protocol for the use of such transmission flow control signals must be used, to avoid potential deadlock conditions, however.\n\nThe data link escape character ([[C0 and C1 control codes|DLE]]) was intended to be a signal to the other end of a data link that the following character is a control character such as STX or ETX.  For example a packet may be structured in the following way ([[C0 and C1 control codes|DLE]]) <STX> <PAYLOAD> ([[C0 and C1 control codes|DLE]]) <ETX>.\n\n===Miscellaneous codes===\nCode 7 ([[bell character|BEL]]) is intended to cause an audible signal in the receiving terminal.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc20 |title=RFC20 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}An old RFC, which explains the structure and meaning of the control characters in chapters 4.1 and 5.2</ref>\n\nMany of the ASCII control characters were designed for devices of the time that are not often seen today. For example, code 22, \"synchronous idle\" ([[C0 and C1 control codes|SYN]]), was originally sent by synchronous modems (which have to send data constantly) when there was no actual data to send. (Modern systems typically use a start bit to announce the beginning of a transmitted word&mdash; this is a feature of ''asynchronous'' communication.  ''Synchronous'' communication links were more often seen with mainframes, where they were typically run over corporate leased lines to connect a mainframe to another mainframe or perhaps a minicomputer.)\n\nCode 0 (ASCII code name [[null character|NUL]]) is a special case. In paper tape, it is the case when there are no holes.  It is convenient to treat this as a ''fill'' character with no meaning otherwise.  Since the position of a NUL character has no holes punched, it can be replaced with any other character at a later time, so it was typically used to reserve space, either for correcting errors or for inserting information that would be available at a later time or in another place. In computing it is often used for padding in fixed length records and more commonly, to mark the end of a string.\n\nCode 127 ([[Delete character|DEL]], a.k.a. \"rubout\") is likewise a special case. Its 7-bit code is ''all-bits-on'' in binary, which essentially erased a character cell on a [[punched tape|paper tape]] when overpunched. Paper tape was a common storage medium when ASCII was developed, with a computing history dating back to WWII code breaking equipment at [[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w]]. Paper tape became obsolete in the 1970s, so this clever aspect of ASCII rarely saw any use after that. Some systems (such as the original Apples) converted it to a backspace.  But because its code is in the range occupied by other printable characters, and because it had no official assigned glyph, many computer equipment vendors used it as an additional printable character (often an all-black \"box\" character useful for erasing text by overprinting with ink).\n\nNon-erasable [[Programmable read-only memory|Programmable ROM]]s are typically implemented as arrays of fusible elements, each representing a [[bit]], which can only be switched one way, usually from one to zero. In such PROMs, the DEL and NUL characters can be used in the same way that they were used on punched tape: one to reserve meaningless fill bytes that can be written later, and the other to convert written bytes to meaningless fill bytes. For PROMs that switch one to zero, the roles of NUL and DEL are reversed; also, DEL will only work with 7-bit characters, which are rarely used today; for 8-bit content, the character code 255, commonly defined as a nonbreaking space character, can be used instead of DEL.\n\nMany [[file system]]s do not allow control characters in the [[filename]]s, as they may have reserved functions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[C0 and C1 control codes]]\n* [[Escape sequence]]\n* [[In-band signaling]]\n* [[Whitespace character]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|Appendix:Control characters|}}\n{{Wiktionary|Control character|Control code}}\n* [https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/001.pdf ISO IR 1] C0 Set of ISO 646 (PDF)\n\n{{Character encoding}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Control Character}}\n[[Category:Control characters| ]]", "sha1": "itked4wg2a16ghudfwo5u811sii776u"}}, {"title": "Carbon", "ns": "0", "id": "5299", "revision": {"id": "866501134", "parentid": "865476910", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T18:37:28Z", "contributor": {"username": "Matthew1877", "id": "27693108"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the chemical element}}\n{{redirect|Element 6|the company|Element Six}}\n{{pp-semi-indef}}\n{{short description|Chemical element with atomic number 6}}\n{{good article}}\n{{Infobox carbon}}\n\n'''Carbon''' (from {{lang-la|carbo}} \"coal\") is a [[chemical element]] with [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] '''C''' and [[atomic number]] 6.

For example, graphite is [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and black while diamond is highly [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]]. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the [[Greeks|Greek]] verb \"\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good [[electrical conductor]] while diamond has a low [[electrical conductivity]]. Under normal conditions, diamond, [[carbon nanotube]]s, and [[graphene]] have the highest [[thermal conductivity|thermal conductivities]] of [[List of thermal conductivities|all known materials]]. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|thermodynamically stable]] form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.\n\nThe most common [[oxidation state]] of carbon in [[inorganic compound]]s is +4, while +2 is found in [[carbon monoxide]] and [[transition metal]] [[Metal carbonyl|carbonyl]] complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are [[limestone]]s, [[dolomite]]s and [[carbon dioxide]], but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of [[coal]], [[peat]], [[petroleum|oil]], and [[methane clathrate]]s.

For example, graphite can be oxidised by hot concentrated [[nitric acid]] at standard conditions to [[mellitic acid]], C<sub>6</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub>H)<sub>6</sub>, which preserves the hexagonal units of graphite while breaking up the larger structure.<ref name=Greenwood289>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 289\u2013292.</ref>\n\nCarbon sublimes in a carbon arc, which has a temperature of about 5800 K (5,530&nbsp;\u00b0C or 9,980&nbsp;\u00b0F). Thus, irrespective of its allotropic form, carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than the highest-melting-point metals such as [[tungsten]] or [[rhenium]]. Although thermodynamically prone to [[Redox|oxidation]], carbon resists oxidation more effectively than elements such as [[iron]] and [[copper]], which are weaker reducing agents at room temperature.\n\nCarbon is the sixth element, with a ground-state [[electron configuration]] of 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>2</sup>, of which the four outer electrons are [[valence electron]]s. Its first four ionisation energies, 1086.5, 2352.6, 4620.5 and 6222.7&nbsp;kJ/mol, are much higher than those of the heavier group-14 elements. The electronegativity of carbon is 2.5, significantly higher than the heavier group-14 elements (1.8\u20131.9), but close to most of the nearby nonmetals, as well as some of the second- and third-row [[transition metal]]s. Carbon's [[covalent radius|covalent radii]] are normally taken as 77.2&nbsp;pm (C\u2212C), 66.7&nbsp;pm (C=C) and 60.3&nbsp;pm (C\u2261C), although these may vary depending on coordination number and what the carbon is bonded to. In general, covalent radius decreases with lower coordination number and higher bond order.<ref name=Greenwood276>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 276\u20138.</ref>\n\nCarbon compounds form the basis of all known life on [[Earth]], and the [[CNO cycle|carbon\u2013nitrogen cycle]] provides some of the energy produced by the [[Sun]] and other [[star]]s. Although it forms an extraordinary variety of compounds, most forms of carbon are comparatively unreactive under normal conditions. At standard temperature and pressure, it resists all but the strongest oxidizers. It does not react with [[sulfuric acid]], [[hydrochloric acid]], [[chlorine]] or any [[Alkali metals|alkalis]]. At elevated temperatures, carbon reacts with [[oxygen]] to form [[Oxocarbon|carbon oxides]] and will rob oxygen from metal oxides to leave the elemental metal. This [[exothermic reaction]] is used in the iron and steel industry to [[Smelting|smelt]] iron and to control the carbon content of [[steel]]:\n\n:{{chem|Fe|3|O|4}} + 4 C{{sub|(s)}} \u2192 3 Fe{{sub|(s)}} + 4 CO{{sub|(g)}}\n\nCarbon monoxide can be recycled to smelt even more iron:\n\n:{{chem|Fe|3|O|4}} + 4 CO{{sub|(g)}} \u2192 3 Fe{{sub|(s)}} + 4 {{chem|C|O|2}}{{sub|(g)}}\n\nwith [[sulfur]] to form [[carbon disulfide]] and with steam in the coal-gas reaction:\n:C{{sub|(s)}} + H{{sub|2}}O{{sub|(g)}} \u2192 CO{{sub|(g)}} + H{{sub|2(g)}}.\nCarbon combines with some metals at high temperatures to form metallic carbides, such as the iron carbide [[cementite]] in steel and [[tungsten carbide]], widely used as an [[abrasive]] and for making hard tips for cutting tools.\n\nThe system of carbon allotropes spans a range of extremes:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|Graphite is one of the softest materials known.\n|style=\"width: 50%;\"|Synthetic [[Aggregated diamond nanorod|nanocrystalline diamond]] is the hardest material known.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Irifune |first1=Tetsuo |last2=Kurio |first2=Ayako |last3=Sakamoto |first3=Shizue |last4=Inoue |first4=Toru |last5=Sumiya |first5=Hitoshi |title=Materials: Ultrahard polycrystalline diamond from graphite |journal=Nature |volume=421 |pages=599\u2013600 |date=2003 |doi=10.1038/421599b |pmid=12571587 |issue=6923 |bibcode = 2003Natur.421..599I }}</ref>\n|-\n|Graphite is a very good [[lubricant]], displaying [[superlubricity]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Superlubricity of Graphite |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.126101 |pmid=15089689 |url=http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/sections/cm/ip/group/PDF/Phys.rev.lett/2004/92(2004)12601.pdf |date=2004 |last1=Dienwiebel |first1=Martin |last2=Verhoeven |first2=Gertjan |last3=Pradeep |first3=Namboodiri |last4=Frenken |first4=Joost |last5=Heimberg |first5=Jennifer |last6=Zandbergen |first6=Henny |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=92 |issue=12 |pages=126101 |bibcode=2004PhRvL..92l6101D |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917120623/http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/sections/cm/ip/group/PDF/Phys.rev.lett/2004/92(2004)12601.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-17|df=}}</ref>\n|Diamond is the ultimate [[abrasive]].\n|-\n|Graphite is a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] of electricity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Deprez |first1=N. |last2=McLachan |first2=D.

Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide.

A hydrocarbon backbone can be substituted by other atoms, known as heteroatoms.  Common heteroatoms that appear in organic compounds include oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and the nonradioactive halogens, as well as the metals lithium and magnesium.  Organic compounds containing bonds to metal are known as organometallic compounds (''see below'').  Certain groupings of atoms, often including heteroatoms, recur in large numbers of organic compounds.  These collections, known as [[Functional group|''functional groups'']], confer common reactivity patterns and allow for the systematic study and categorization of organic compounds.  Chain length, shape and functional groups all affect the properties of organic molecules.\n\nIn most stable compounds of carbon (and nearly all stable ''organic'' compounds), carbon obeys the [[octet rule]] and is ''tetravalent'', meaning that a carbon atom forms a total of four covalent bonds (which may include double and triple bonds).  Exceptions include a small number of stabilized ''carbocations'' (three bonds, positive charge), ''radicals'' (three bonds, neutral), ''carbanions'' (three bonds, negative charge) and ''carbenes'' (two bonds, neutral), although these species are much more likely to be encountered as unstable, reactive intermediates.    \n\nCarbon occurs in all known [[organic material|organic]] life and is the basis of [[organic chemistry]]. When united with [[hydrogen]], it forms various hydrocarbons that are important to industry as [[refrigerant]]s, [[lubricant]]s, [[solvent]]s, as chemical feedstock for the manufacture of [[plastic]]s and [[petrochemical]]s, and as [[fossil fuel]]s.\n\nWhen combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including [[sugar]]s, [[lignan]]s, [[chitin]]s, [[alcohol]]s, [[fat]]s, and aromatic [[ester]]s, [[carotenoid]]s and [[terpene]]s. With [[nitrogen]] it forms [[alkaloid]]s, and with the addition of sulfur also it forms [[antibiotic]]s, [[amino acid]]s, and [[rubber]] products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], the chemical-code carriers of life, and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells.\n\n===Inorganic compounds===\nCommonly carbon-containing compounds which are associated with minerals or which do not contain bonds to the other carbon atoms, halogens, or hydrogen, are treated separately from classical [[organic compounds]]; the definition is not rigid, and the classification of some compounds can vary from author to author (see reference articles above).

A wide range of such compounds exist; major classes include simple alkyl-metal compounds (for example, [[tetraethyllead]]), \u03b7{{sup|2}}-alkene compounds (for example, [[Zeise's salt]]), and \u03b7{{sup|3}}-allyl compounds (for example, [[allylpalladium chloride dimer]]); [[metallocene]]s containing cyclopentadienyl ligands (for example, [[ferrocene]]); and [[transition metal carbene complex]]es. Many [[metal carbonyl]]s and [[Cyanometalate|metal cyanides]] exist (for example, [[tetracarbonylnickel]] and [[potassium ferricyanide]]); some workers consider metal carbonyl and cyanide complexes without other carbon ligands to be purely inorganic, and not organometallic.  However, most organometallic chemists consider metal complexes with any carbon ligand, even 'inorganic carbon' (e.g., carbonyls, cyanides, and certain types of carbides and acetylides) to be organometallic in nature.  Metal complexes containing organic ligands without a carbon-metal covalent bond (e.g., metal carboxylates) are termed ''metalorganic'' compounds.\n\nWhile carbon is understood to strongly prefer formation of four covalent bonds, other exotic bonding schemes are also known.  An interesting compound containing an octahedral hexacoordinated carbon atom has been reported. The cation of the compound is [(Ph{{sub|3}}PAu){{sub|6}}C]{{sup|2+}}.

Graphite deposits are of [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] origin, found in association with [[quartz]], [[mica]] and [[feldspar]]s in schists, [[gneiss]]es and metamorphosed [[sandstone]]s and [[limestone]] as [[lens (geology)|lenses]] or [[vein (geology)|veins]], sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in [[Borrowdale]], [[Cumberland]], [[England]] were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, [[pencil]]s were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller deposits of graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water.<ref name=USGS>[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/graphite USGS Minerals Yearbook: Graphite, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916114706/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/graphite/ |date=2008-09-16 }} and Graphite: Mineral Commodity Summaries 2011</ref>\n\nThere are three types of natural graphite\u2014amorphous, flake or crystalline flake, and vein or lump. Amorphous graphite is the lowest quality and most abundant. Contrary to science, in industry \"amorphous\" refers to very small crystal size rather than complete lack of crystal structure. Amorphous is used for lower value graphite products and is the lowest priced graphite. Large amorphous graphite deposits are found in China, Europe, Mexico and the United States. Flake graphite is less common and of higher quality than amorphous; it occurs as separate plates that crystallized in metamorphic rock. Flake graphite can be four times the price of amorphous. Good quality flakes can be processed into expandable graphite for many uses, such as [[flame retardant]]s. The foremost deposits are found in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany and Madagascar. Vein or lump graphite is the rarest, most valuable, and highest quality type of natural graphite. It occurs in veins along intrusive contacts in solid lumps, and it is only commercially mined in Sri Lanka.<ref name=USGS/>\n\nAccording to the [[USGS]], world production of natural graphite was 1.1&nbsp;million tonnes in 2010, to which China contributed 800,000&nbsp;t, India 130,000 t, Brazil 76,000&nbsp;t, North Korea 30,000&nbsp;t and Canada 25,000 t. No natural graphite was reported mined in the United States, but 118,000 t of synthetic graphite with an estimated value of $998&nbsp;million was produced in 2009.<ref name=USGS/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Diamond===\n{{main|Diamond}}\n[[File:Global Diamond Output in 2005.png|thumb|upright=2.0|Diamond output in 2005]]\n\nThe diamond supply chain is controlled by a limited number of powerful businesses, and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around the world (see figure).\n\nOnly a very small fraction of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care has to be taken in order to prevent larger diamonds from being destroyed in this process and subsequently the particles are sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of [[X-ray fluorescence]], after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of [[X-ray]]s became commonplace, the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore.<ref>{{cite book|page=223|title=The nature of diamonds|author=Harlow, G.

The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the [[fossil fuel]] [[methane]] gas and [[crude oil]] (petroleum). [[Petroleum|Crude oil]] is [[distillation|distilled]] in [[Oil refinery|refineries]] by the [[petrochemical industry]] to produce [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], and other products. [[Cellulose]] is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of [[wood]], [[cotton]], [[linen]], and [[hemp]]. [[Cellulose]] is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include [[wool]], [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]] and [[silk]]. [[Plastics]] are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.\n\nThe uses of carbon and its compounds are extremely varied. It can form [[alloys]] with [[iron]], of which the most common is [[carbon steel]]. [[Graphite]] is combined with [[clay]]s to form the 'lead' used in [[pencil]]s used for [[writing]] and [[drawing]]. It is also used as a [[lubricant]] and a [[pigment]], as a molding material in [[glass]] manufacture, in [[electrodes]] for dry [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and in [[electroplating]] and [[electroforming]], in [[brush (electric)|brushes]] for [[electric motors]] and as a [[neutron moderator]] in [[nuclear reactors]].\n\n[[Charcoal]] is used as a drawing material in [[art]]work, barbecue [[grilling]], [[iron smelting]], and in many other applications. Wood, coal and oil are used as [[fuel]] for production of energy and [[heating]]. Gem quality [[diamond]] is used in jewelry, and [[industrial diamond]]s are used in drilling, cutting and polishing tools for machining metals and stone. Plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons, and [[carbon fiber]], made by [[pyrolysis]] of synthetic [[polyester]] [[fiber]]s is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced, lightweight [[composite materials]].\n\n[[Carbon fiber]] is made by pyrolysis of extruded and stretched filaments of [[polyacrylonitrile]] (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend on the type of starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher [[specific strength|specific tensile strength]] than steel.<ref name=\"cantwell\">{{cite journal|first1=W.

[[Activated charcoal]] is used as an [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] and [[adsorbent]] in [[Filter (chemistry)|filter]] material in applications as diverse as [[gas masks]], [[water purification]], and [[kitchen]] [[extractor hood]]s, and in medicine to [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorb]] toxins, poisons, or gases from the [[Human digestive system|digestive system]]. Carbon is used in [[Redox|chemical reduction]] at high temperatures. [[Coke (fuel)|Coke]] is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). [[Case hardening]] of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. [[Carbide]]s of [[silicon carbide|silicon]], [[tungsten carbide|tungsten]], [[boron carbide|boron]] and [[titanium carbide|titanium]], are among the hardest known materials, and are used as [[abrasives]] in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make up most of the materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic [[textiles]] and [[leather]], and almost all of the interior surfaces in the [[built environment]] other than glass, stone and metal.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Diamonds===\nThe [[diamond]] industry falls into two categories: one dealing with gem-grade diamonds and the other, with industrial-grade diamonds. While a large trade in both types of diamonds exists, the two markets act in dramatically different ways.\n\nUnlike [[precious metal]]s such as [[gold]] or [[platinum]], gem diamonds do not trade as a [[commodity]]: there is a substantial mark-up in the sale of diamonds, and there is not a very active market for resale of diamonds.\n\nIndustrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, with the gemological qualities of clarity and color being mostly irrelevant. About 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20&nbsp;tonnes annually) are unsuitable for use as gemstones are relegated for industrial use (known as ''[[bort]])''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Turning And Mechanical Manipulation|first=Ch.|last=Holtzapffel|publisher=Charles Holtzapffel|date=1856|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=omwPAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428063201/https://books.google.com/books?id=omwPAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover|archivedate=2016-04-28|df=}} [https://archive.org/details/turningmechanica02holtuoft Internet Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326085110/https://archive.org/details/turningmechanica02holtuoft |date=2016-03-26 }}</ref> [[synthetic diamond]]s, invented in the 1950s, found almost immediate industrial applications; 3&nbsp;billion carats (600&nbsp;[[tonne]]s) of synthetic diamond is produced annually.<ref name=\"usgs\">{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/diamond/|accessdate=2009-05-05|title=Industrial Diamonds Statistics and Information|publisher=United States Geological Survey|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506221551/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/diamond/|archivedate=2009-05-06|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe dominant industrial use of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing.

It is a core function and fundamental component of computers.<ref name=\"Patterson\">{{Cite book |title=Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface |last=Patterson |first=David A. |last2=Hennessy |first2=John L. |date=2005 |publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann Publishers]] |isbn=1-55860-604-1 |edition=3rd |location=[[Amsterdam]] |oclc=56213091}}</ref>{{rp|15\u201316}}\n\nThe [[central processing unit]] (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates data by performing computations.  In practice, almost all computers use a [[memory hierarchy|storage hierarchy]],<ref name=\"Patterson\" />{{rp|468\u2013473}} which puts fast but expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and slower but larger and cheaper options farther away. Generally the fast volatile technologies (which lose data when off power) are referred to as \"memory\", while slower persistent technologies are referred to as \"storage\".\n\nIn the [[Von Neumann architecture]], the CPU consists of two main parts: The [[control unit]] and the [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU). The former controls the flow of data between the CPU and memory, while the latter performs arithmetic and [[Bitwise operations|logical operations]] on data.\n\n== Functionality ==\nWithout a significant amount of memory, a computer would merely be able to perform fixed operations and immediately output the result. It would have to be reconfigured to change its behavior. This is acceptable for devices such as desk [[calculator]]s, [[digital signal processing|digital signal processors]], and other specialized devices. [[von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] machines differ in having a memory in which they store their operating [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]]s and data.<ref name=\"Patterson\" />{{rp|20}} Such computers are more versatile in that they do not need to have their hardware reconfigured for each new program, but can simply be [[computer programming|reprogrammed]] with new in-memory instructions; they also tend to be simpler to design, in that a relatively simple processor may keep [[program state|state]] between successive computations to build up complex procedural results. Most modern computers are von Neumann machines.\n\n== Data organization and representation ==\nA modern [[Computer|digital computer]] represents [[data]] using the [[binary numeral system]]. Text, numbers, pictures, audio, and nearly any other form of information can be converted into a string of [[bit]]s, or binary digits, each of which has a value of 1 or 0. The most common unit of storage is the [[byte]], equal to 8 bits. A piece of information can be handled by any computer or device whose storage space is large enough to accommodate ''the binary representation of the piece of information'', or simply [[data (computing)|data]]. For example, the [[complete works of Shakespeare]], about 1250 pages in print, can be stored in about five [[megabyte]]s (40 million bits) with one byte per character.\n\nData are [[Encoding|encoded]] by assigning a bit pattern to each [[Character (computing)|character]], [[Numerical digit|digit]], or [[multimedia]] object. Many standards exist for encoding (e.g., [[character encoding]]s like [[ASCII]], image encodings like [[JPEG]], video encodings like [[MPEG-4]]).\n\nBy adding bits to each encoded unit, redundancy allows the computer to both detect errors in coded data and correct them based on mathematical algorithms. Errors generally occur in low probabilities due to [[random]] bit value flipping, or \"physical bit fatigue\", loss of the physical bit in storage of its ability to maintain a distinguishable value (0 or 1), or due to errors in inter or intra-computer communication. A random [[RAM parity|bit flip]] (e.g., due to random [[radiation]]) is typically corrected upon detection. A bit, or a group of malfunctioning physical bits (not always the specific defective bit is known; group definition depends on specific storage device) is typically automatically fenced-out, taken out of use by the device, and replaced with another functioning equivalent group in the device, where the corrected bit values are restored (if possible). The [[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC) method is typically used in communications and storage for [[error detection and correction|error detection]].  A detected error is then retried.\n\n[[Data compression]] methods allow in many cases (such as a database) to represent a string of bits by a shorter bit string (\"compress\") and reconstruct the original string (\"decompress\") when needed. This utilizes substantially less storage (tens of percents) for many types of data at the cost of more computation (compress and decompress when needed). Analysis of trade-off between storage cost saving and costs of related computations and possible delays in data availability is done before deciding whether to keep certain data compressed or not.\n\nFor [[data security|security reasons]] certain types of data (e.g., credit-card information) may be kept [[encryption|encrypted]] in storage to prevent the possibility of unauthorized information reconstruction from chunks of storage snapshots.\n\n== Hierarchy of storage ==\n{{Main article|Memory hierarchy}}\n{{Contradicts other|date=March 2013|1=Memory hierarchy}}\n[[File:Computer storage types.svg|thumb|right|350px|Various forms of storage, divided according to their distance from the [[central processing unit]]. The fundamental components of a general-purpose computer are [[arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic and logic unit]], [[control unit|control circuitry]], storage space, and [[input/output]] devices. Technology and capacity as in common [[home computer]]s around 2005.]]\n\nGenerally, the lower a storage is in the hierarchy, the lesser its [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and the greater its access [[latency (engineering)|latency]] is from the CPU. This traditional division of storage to primary, secondary, tertiary and off-line storage is also guided by cost per bit.\n\nIn contemporary usage, \"memory\" is usually [[semiconductor]] storage read-write [[random-access memory]], typically [[DRAM]] (dynamic RAM) or other forms of fast but temporary storage. \"Storage\" consists of storage devices and their media not directly accessible by the [[CPU]] ([[Secondary storage|secondary]] or [[tertiary storage]]), typically [[hard disk drive]]s, [[optical disc]] drives, and other devices slower than RAM but [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] (retaining contents when powered down).<ref>''Storage'' as defined in Microsoft Computing Dictionary, 4th Ed. (c)1999 or in The Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standard Terms, 7th Ed., (c) 2000.</ref>\n\nHistorically, ''memory'' has been called ''core memory'', ''main memory'', ''real storage'' or ''internal memory''. Meanwhile, non-volatile storage devices have been referred to as ''secondary storage'', ''external memory'' or ''auxiliary/peripheral storage''.\n\n=== Primary storage ===\n<!-- Additional DIRECT links point to this section by its name. -->\n{{Main article|Computer memory}}\n\n''Primary storage'' (also known as ''main memory'' or ''internal memory''), often referred to simply as ''memory'', is the only one directly accessible to the CPU. The CPU continuously reads instructions stored there and executes them as required. Any data actively operated on is also stored there in uniform manner.\n\nHistorically, [[History of computing hardware|early computers]] used [[delay line memory|delay lines]], [[Williams tube]]s, or rotating [[drum memory|magnetic drums]] as primary storage. By 1954, those unreliable methods were mostly replaced by [[magnetic core memory]]. Core memory remained dominant until the 1970s, when advances in [[integrated circuit]] technology allowed [[semiconductor memory]] to become economically competitive.<!-- Please DO NOT EXPAND above text! Change but no expand any further. Anyone desiring to know more types, let it be [[twister memory]] or [[bubble memory]] etc, will click the History link. Do not confuse other readers. -->\n\nThis led to modern [[random-access memory]] (RAM). It is small-sized, light, but quite expensive at the same time. (The particular types of RAM used for primary storage are also [[volatile memory|volatile]], i.e. they lose the information when not powered).\n\nAs shown in the diagram, traditionally there are two more sub-layers of the primary storage, besides main large-capacity RAM:\n\n* [[Processor register]]s are located inside the processor. Each register typically holds a [[Word (computer architecture)|word]] of data (often 32 or 64 bits). CPU instructions instruct the [[arithmetic logic unit]] to perform various calculations or other operations on this data (or with the help of it). Registers are the fastest of all forms of computer data storage.\n* [[CPU cache|Processor cache]] is an intermediate stage between ultra-fast registers and much slower main memory. It was introduced solely to improve the performance of computers. Most actively used information in the main memory is just duplicated in the cache memory, which is faster, but of much lesser capacity. On the other hand, main memory is much slower, but has a much greater storage capacity than processor registers. Multi-level [[Memory hierarchy|hierarchical cache]] setup is also commonly used\u2014''primary cache'' being smallest, fastest and located inside the processor; ''secondary cache'' being somewhat larger and slower. <!-- Please DO NOT EXPAND above text, especially with L1/L2/etc variants - reader can always click the link. -->\n\nMain memory is directly or indirectly connected to the central processing unit via a ''memory bus''. It is actually two buses (not on the diagram): an [[address bus]] and a [[Bus (computing)|data bus]]. The CPU firstly sends a number through an address bus, a number called [[memory address]], that indicates the desired location of data. Then it reads or writes the data in the [[Memory cell (computing)|memory cell]]s  using the data bus. Additionally, a [[memory management unit]] (MMU) is a small device between CPU and RAM recalculating the actual memory address, for example to provide an abstraction of [[virtual memory]] or other tasks.\n\nAs the RAM types used for primary storage are volatile (uninitialized at start up), a computer containing only such storage would not have a source to read instructions from, in order to start the computer. Hence, [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile primary storage]] containing a small startup program ([[BIOS]]) is used to [[Bootstrapping (computing)|bootstrap]] the computer, that is, to read a larger program from non-volatile ''secondary'' storage to RAM and start to execute it. A non-volatile technology used for this purpose is called ROM, for [[read-only memory]] (the terminology may be somewhat confusing as most ROM types are also capable of ''[[random access]]'').\n\nMany types of \"ROM\" are not literally ''read only'', as updates to them are possible; however it is slow and memory must be erased in large portions before it can be re-written. Some [[embedded system]]s run programs directly from ROM (or similar), because such programs are rarely changed. Standard computers do not store non-rudimentary programs in ROM, and rather, use large capacities of secondary storage, which is non-volatile as well, and not as costly.\n\nRecently, ''primary storage'' and ''secondary storage'' in some uses refer to what was historically called, respectively, ''secondary storage'' and ''tertiary storage''.<ref>[http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/topics/0,295493,sid5_tax298620,00.html \"Primary Storage or Storage Hardware\" (shows usage of term \"primary storage\" meaning \"hard disk storage\")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910151628/http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/topics/0,295493,sid5_tax298620,00.html |date=10 September 2008 }}.

The computer usually uses its [[input/output]] channels to access secondary storage and transfers the desired data using [[Data buffer|intermediate area]] in primary storage. Secondary storage does not lose the data when the device is powered down\u2014it is non-volatile. Per unit, it is typically also two orders of magnitude less expensive than primary storage. Modern computer systems typically have two orders of magnitude more secondary storage than primary storage and data are kept for a longer time there.\n\nIn modern computers, [[hard disk drive]]s are usually used as secondary storage. The time taken to access a given byte of information stored on a hard disk is typically a few thousandths of a second, or milliseconds. By contrast, the time taken to access a given byte of information stored in random-access memory is measured in billionths of a second, or nanoseconds. This illustrates the  significant access-time difference which distinguishes solid-state memory from rotating magnetic storage devices: hard disks are typically about a million times slower than memory. Rotating [[Optical disc drive|optical storage]] devices, such as [[Compact Disc|CD]] and [[DVD]] drives, have even longer access times. With disk drives, once the disk read/write head reaches the proper placement and the data of interest rotates under it, subsequent data on the track are very fast to access. To reduce the seek time and rotational latency, data are transferred to and from disks in large contiguous blocks.\n\nWhen data reside on disk, accessing them in large blocks to hide latency offers an opportunity to design efficient [[external memory algorithms]]. Sequential or block access on disks is orders of magnitude faster than random access, and many sophisticated paradigms have been developed to design efficient algorithms based upon sequential and block access. Another way to reduce the I/O bottleneck is to use multiple disks in parallel in order to increase the bandwidth between primary and secondary memory.<ref>[[J. S. Vitter]], ''[http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~jsv/Papers/Vit.IO_book.pdf Algorithms and Data Structures for External Memory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104233254/http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~jsv/Papers/Vit.IO_book.pdf |date=4 January 2011 }}'', Series on Foundations and Trends in Theoretical Computer Science, now Publishers, Hanover, MA, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-60198-106-6}}.</ref>\n\nSome other examples of secondary storage technologies are [[flash memory]] (e.g. [[USB flash drive]]s or keys), [[floppy disk]]s, [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]], [[Punched tape|paper tape]], [[punched card]]s, standalone [[RAM disk]]s, and [[Iomega Zip drive]]s.\n\nThe secondary storage is often formatted according to a [[file system]] format, which provides the abstraction necessary to organize data into [[Computer file|files]] and [[Directory (computing)|directories]], providing also additional information (called [[metadata]]) describing the owner of a certain file, the access time, the access permissions, and other information.\n\nMost computer [[operating system]]s use the concept of [[virtual memory]], allowing utilization of more primary storage capacity than is physically available in the system. As the primary memory fills up, the system moves the least-used chunks (''[[page (computing)|pages]]'') to secondary storage devices (to a [[Paging|swap file]] or [[paging|page file]]), retrieving them later when they are needed. As more of these retrievals from slower secondary storage are necessary, the more the overall system performance is degraded.\n\n=== Tertiary storage ===\n<!-- Note that additional DIRECT links point to this section by its name. -->\n{{See also|Nearline storage|Cloud storage}}\n[[File:StorageTek Powderhorn tape library.jpg|thumb|A large [[tape library]], with tape cartridges placed on shelves in the front, and a robotic arm moving in the back.

Typically, it involves a robotic mechanism which will ''mount'' (insert) and ''dismount'' removable mass storage media into a storage device according to the system's demands; such data are often copied to secondary storage before use. It is primarily used for archiving rarely accessed information since it is much slower than secondary storage (e.g. 5\u201360 seconds vs. 1\u201310 milliseconds). This is primarily useful for extraordinarily large data stores, accessed without human operators. Typical examples include [[tape library|tape libraries]] and [[optical jukebox]]es.\n\nWhen a computer needs to read information from the tertiary storage, it will first consult a catalog [[database]] to determine which tape or disc contains the information. Next, the computer will instruct a [[industrial robot|robotic arm]] to fetch the medium and place it in a drive. When the computer has finished reading the information, the robotic arm will return the medium to its place in the library.\n\nTertiary storage is also known as ''[[nearline storage]]'' because it is \"near to online\". The formal distinction between online, nearline, and offline storage is:<ref name=\"pearson2010\">{{cite web |last=Pearson |first=Tony |year=2010 |url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/InsideSystemStorage/entry/the_correct_use_of_the_term_nearline2 |title=Correct use of the term Nearline. |work=IBM Developerworks, Inside System Storage |accessdate=2015-08-16}}</ref>\n\n* Online storage is immediately available for I/O.\n* Nearline storage is not immediately available, but can be made online quickly without human intervention.\n* Offline storage is not immediately available, and requires some human intervention to become online.\n\nFor example, always-on spinning hard disk drives are online storage, while spinning drives that spin down automatically, such as in massive arrays of idle disks ([[MAID]]), are nearline storage. Removable media such as tape cartridges that can be automatically loaded, as in [[Tape library|tape libraries]], are nearline storage, while tape cartridges that must be manually loaded are offline storage.\n\n=== Off-line storage ===\n<!-- Additional DIRECT links point to this section by name. -->\n''Off-line storage'' is a computer data storage on a medium or a device that is not under the control of a [[central processing unit|processing unit]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n |last        = National Communications System\n |author-link = National Communications System\n |title       = Federal Standard 1037C \u2013 Telecommunications: Glossary of Telecommunication Terms\n |publisher   = General Services Administration\n |year        = 1996\n |id          = FS-1037C\n |url         = http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/fs-1037c.htm\n |accessdate  = 2007-10-08\n |postscript  = <!--None-->\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/62gTIhztA?url=http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/fs-1037c.htm\n |archivedate = 24 October 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} See also article [[Federal Standard 1037C]].</ref> The medium is recorded, usually in a secondary or tertiary storage device, and then physically removed or disconnected. It must be inserted or connected by a human operator before a computer can access it again. Unlike tertiary storage, it cannot be accessed without human interaction.\n\n[[Online and offline|Off-line]] storage is used to [[Data transmission|transfer information]], since the detached medium can be easily physically transported. Additionally, in case a disaster, for example a fire, destroys the original data, a medium in a remote location will probably be unaffected, enabling [[disaster recovery]]. Off-line storage increases general [[information security]], since it is physically inaccessible from a computer, and data confidentiality or integrity cannot be affected by computer-based attack techniques. Also, if the information stored for archival purposes is rarely accessed, off-line storage is less expensive than tertiary storage.\n\nIn modern personal computers, most secondary and tertiary storage media are also used for off-line storage. Optical discs and flash memory devices are most popular, and to much lesser extent removable hard disk drives. In enterprise uses, magnetic tape is predominant. Older examples are floppy disks, Zip disks, or punched cards.\n\n== Characteristics of storage ==\n[[File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1&nbsp;GB module of [[SO-DIMM|laptop]] [[DDR2 SDRAM|DDR2]] [[Random-access memory|RAM]].]]\n\nStorage technologies at all levels of the storage hierarchy can be differentiated by evaluating certain core characteristics as well as measuring characteristics specific to a particular implementation. These core characteristics are volatility, mutability, accessibility, and addressability. For any particular implementation of any storage technology, the characteristics worth measuring are capacity and performance.\n\n=== Volatility ===\n[[Non-volatile memory]] retains the stored information even if not constantly supplied with electric power.<ref name=\"flashnvmWork\">\"[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277637285_A_Survey_of_Software_Techniques_for_Using_Non-Volatile_Memories_for_Storage_and_Main_Memory_Systems A Survey of Software Techniques for Using Non-Volatile Memories for Storage and Main Memory Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225040943/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277637285_A_Survey_of_Software_Techniques_for_Using_Non-Volatile_Memories_for_Storage_and_Main_Memory_Systems |date=25 December 2015 }}\", IEEE TPDS, 2015</ref> It is suitable for long-term storage of information. [[Volatile memory]] requires constant power to maintain the stored information. The fastest memory technologies are volatile ones, although that is not a universal rule. Since the primary storage is required to be very fast, it predominantly uses volatile memory.\n\n[[Dynamic random-access memory]] is a form of volatile memory that also requires the stored information to be periodically reread and rewritten, or [[memory refresh|refreshed]], otherwise it would vanish. [[Static random-access memory]] is a form of volatile memory similar to DRAM with the exception that it never needs to be refreshed as long as power is applied; it loses its content when the power supply is lost.\n\nAn [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) can be used to give a computer a brief window of time to move information from primary volatile storage into non-volatile storage before the batteries are exhausted.  Some systems, for example [[EMC Symmetrix]], have integrated batteries that maintain volatile storage for several minutes.\n\n=== Mutability ===\n; Read/write storage or mutable storage : Allows information to be overwritten at any time. A computer without some amount of read/write storage for primary storage purposes would be useless for many tasks. Modern computers typically use read/write storage also for secondary storage.\n; Read only storage : Retains the information stored at the time of manufacture, and ''write once storage'' ([[write once read many]]) allows the information to be written only once at some point after manufacture. These are called ''immutable storage''. Immutable storage is used for tertiary and off-line storage. Examples include [[CD-ROM]] and [[CD-R]].\n; Slow write, fast read storage : Read/write storage which allows information to be overwritten multiple times, but with the write operation being much slower than the read operation. Examples include [[CD-RW]] and [[swayne memory]]\n\n=== Accessibility ===\n; [[Random access]]: Any location in storage can be accessed at any moment in approximately the same amount of time. Such characteristic is well suited for primary and secondary storage. Most semiconductor memories and disk drives provide random access.\n; [[Sequential access]]: The accessing of pieces of information will be in a serial order, one after the other; therefore the time to access a particular piece of information depends upon which piece of information was last accessed. Such characteristic is typical of off-line storage.\n\n=== Addressability ===\n; Location-addressable : Each individually accessible unit of information in storage is selected with its numerical [[memory address]]. In modern computers, location-addressable storage usually limits to primary storage, accessed internally by computer programs, since location-addressability is very efficient, but burdensome for humans.\n; [[file system|File addressable]]: Information is divided into ''[[computer file|files]]'' of variable length, and a particular file is selected with [[human-readable]] directory and file names. The underlying device is still location-addressable, but the [[operating system]] of a computer provides the file system [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] to make the operation more understandable. In modern computers, secondary, tertiary and off-line storage use file systems.\n; [[content-addressable memory|Content-addressable]]: Each individually accessible unit of information is selected based on the basis of (part of) the contents stored there. Content-addressable storage can be implemented using [[software]] (computer program) or [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]] (computer device), with hardware being faster but more expensive option. Hardware content addressable memory is often used in a computer's [[CPU cache]].\n\n=== Capacity ===\n; Raw capacity : The total amount of stored information that a storage device or medium can hold. It is expressed as a quantity of [[bit]]s or [[byte]]s (e.g. 10.4 [[megabyte]]s).\n; [[Memory storage density]]: The compactness of stored information. It is the storage capacity of a medium divided with a unit of length, area or volume (e.g. 1.2 megabytes per square inch).\n\n=== Performance ===\n; [[Latency (engineering)|Latency]]: The time it takes to access a particular location in storage. The relevant [[units of measurement|unit of measurement]] is typically [[1 E-9 s|nanosecond]] for primary storage, [[millisecond]] for secondary storage, and [[second]] for tertiary storage. It may make sense to separate read latency and write latency (especially for non-volatile memory<ref name=\"flashnvmWork\"/>) and in case of sequential access storage, minimum, maximum and average latency.\n; [[Throughput]]: The rate at which information can be read from or written to the storage. In computer data storage, throughput is usually expressed in terms of megabytes per second (MB/s), though [[bit rate]] may also be used. As with latency, read rate and write rate may need to be differentiated. Also accessing media sequentially, as opposed to randomly, typically yields maximum throughput.\n; Granularity: The size of the largest \"chunk\" of data that can be efficiently accessed as a single unit, e.g. without introducing additional latency.\n;Reliability: The probability of spontaneous bit value change under various conditions, or overall [[failure rate]].\nUtilities such as [[hdparm]] and [[sar (Unix)|sar]] can be used to measure IO performance in Linux.\n\n=== Energy use ===\n* Storage devices that reduce fan usage, automatically shut-down during inactivity, and low power hard drives can reduce energy consumption by 90 percent.<ref>[http://www.springlightcfl.com/consumer/energy_savings_calculator.aspx Energy Savings Calculator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221131054/http://springlightcfl.com/consumer/energy_savings_calculator.aspx |date=21 December 2008 }} and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080805092907/http://www.simpletech.com/content/eco-friendly-redrive Fabric website]</ref>\n* 2.5-inch hard disk drives often consume less power than larger ones.<ref>{{cite web|title=IS the Silent PC Future 2.5-inches wide?|url=http://www.silentpcreview.com/article145-page1.html|accessdate=2008-08-02|author=Mike Chin|date=8 March 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720000101/http://www.silentpcreview.com/article145-page1.html|archivedate=20 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silentpcreview.com/article29-page2.html|title=Recommended Hard Drives|accessdate=2008-08-02|author=Mike Chin|date=2002-09-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905085853/http://www.silentpcreview.com/article29-page2.html|archivedate=5 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Low capacity [[solid-state drive]]s have no moving parts and consume less power than hard disks.<ref>[http://techreport.com/articles.x/10334/13 Super Talent's 2.5\" IDE Flash hard drive \u2013 The Tech Report \u2013 Page 13] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126045422/http://techreport.com/articles.x/10334/13 |date=26 January 2012 }}.

A semiconductor memory chip may contain millions of tiny [[transistor]]s or [[capacitor]]s. Both ''volatile'' and ''non-volatile'' forms of semiconductor memory exist. In modern computers, primary storage almost exclusively consists of dynamic volatile semiconductor memory or [[dynamic random-access memory]]. Since the turn of the century, a type of non-volatile semiconductor memory known as [[flash memory]] has steadily gained share as off-line storage for home computers. Non-volatile semiconductor memory is also used for secondary storage in various advanced electronic devices and specialized computers that are designed for them.\n\nAs early as 2006, [[Laptop|notebook]] and [[desktop computer]] manufacturers started using flash-based [[solid-state drive]]s (SSDs) as default configuration options for the secondary storage either in addition to or instead of the more traditional HDD.<ref>[http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1966644,00.asp New Samsung Notebook Replaces Hard Drive With Flash] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230081543/http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1966644,00.asp |date=30 December 2010 }}.

Magnetic storage is ''non-volatile''. The information is accessed using one or more read/write heads which may contain one or more recording transducers. A read/write head only covers a part of the surface so that the head or medium or both must be moved relative to another in order to access data. In modern computers, magnetic storage will take these forms:\n\n* [[Disk storage|Magnetic disk]]\n** [[Floppy disk]], used for off-line storage\n** [[Hard disk drive]], used for secondary storage\n* [[Magnetic tape data storage|Magnetic tape]], used for tertiary and off-line storage\n* [[Carousel memory]] (magnetic rolls)\n\nIn early computers, magnetic storage was also used as:\n\n* Primary storage in a form of [[Drum memory|magnetic memory]], or [[Magnetic core memory|core memory]], [[core rope memory]], [[thin-film memory]] and/or [[twistor memory]].\n* Tertiary (e.g. [[NCR CRAM]]) or off line storage in the form of magnetic cards.\n* Magnetic tape was then often used for secondary storage.\n\n=== Optical ===\n{{Optical storage media}}\n\n[[Optical storage]], the typical [[optical disc]], stores information in deformities on the surface of a circular disc and reads this information by illuminating the surface with a [[laser diode]] and observing the reflection. Optical disc storage is ''non-volatile''. The deformities may be permanent (read only media), formed once (write once media) or reversible (recordable or read/write media). The following forms are currently in common use:<ref>The [http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html DVD FAQ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822172353/http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html |date=22 August 2009 }} is a comprehensive reference of DVD technologies.</ref>\n\n* [[Compact Disc|CD]], [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc|BD-ROM]]: Read only storage, used for mass distribution of digital information (music, video, computer programs)\n* [[CD-R]], [[DVD-R]], [[DVD+R]], [[Blu-ray Disc recordable|BD-R]]: Write once storage, used for tertiary and off-line storage\n* [[CD-RW]], [[DVD-RW]], [[DVD+RW]], [[DVD-RAM]], [[Blu-ray Disc recordable|BD-RE]]: Slow write, fast read storage, used for tertiary and off-line storage\n* [[Ultra Density Optical]] or UDO is similar in capacity to [[Blu-ray Disc recordable|BD-R or BD-RE]] and is slow write, fast read storage used for tertiary and off-line storage.\n\n[[Magneto-optical drive|Magneto-optical disc storage]] is optical disc storage where the magnetic state on a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] surface stores information. The information is read optically and written by combining magnetic and optical methods. Magneto-optical disc storage is ''non-volatile'', ''sequential access'', slow write, fast read storage used for tertiary and off-line storage.\n\n[[3D optical data storage]] has also been proposed.\n\nLight induced magnetization melting in magnetic photoconductors has also been proposed for high-speed low-energy consumption magneto-optical storage.<ref name=\"N\u00e1fr\u00e1di 2016\">{{cite journal|last1=N\u00e1fr\u00e1di|first1=B\u00e1lint|title=Optically switched magnetism in photovoltaic perovskite CH3NH3(Mn:Pb)I3|journal=Nature Communications|date=24 November 2016|volume=7|page=13406|doi=10.1038/ncomms13406|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13406|pmc=5123013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128101114/http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13406|archivedate=28 November 2016|df=dmy-all|pmid=27882917}}</ref>\n\n=== Paper ===\n{{Paper data storage media}}\n\n[[Paper data storage]], typically in the form of [[punched tape|paper tape]] or [[punched card]]s, has long been used to store information for automatic processing, particularly before general-purpose computers existed. Information was recorded by punching holes into the paper or cardboard medium and was read mechanically (or later optically) to determine whether a particular location on the medium was solid or contained a hole.\nA few technologies allow people to make marks on paper that are easily read by machine\u2014these are widely used for tabulating votes and grading standardized tests. [[Barcode]]s made it possible for any object that was to be sold or transported to have some computer readable information securely attached to it.\n\n=== Other storage media or substrates ===\n; Vacuum tube memory: A [[Williams tube]] used a [[cathode ray tube]], and a [[Selectron tube]] used a large [[vacuum tube]] to store information. These primary storage devices were short-lived in the market, since the Williams tube was unreliable and the Selectron tube was expensive.\n\n; Electro-acoustic memory: [[Delay line memory]] used [[Longitudinal wave|sound wave]]s in a substance such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]] to store information. Delay line memory was dynamic volatile, cycle sequential read/write storage, and was used for primary storage.\n\n; [[Optical tape]]: is a medium for optical storage generally consisting of a long and narrow strip of plastic onto which patterns can be written and from which the patterns can be read back. It shares some technologies with cinema film stock and optical discs, but is compatible with neither. The motivation behind developing this technology was the possibility of far greater storage capacities than either magnetic tape or optical discs.\n\n; [[Phase-change memory]]: uses different mechanical phases of [[phase-change material]] to store information in an X-Y addressable matrix, and reads the information by observing the varying [[electrical resistance]] of the material. Phase-change memory would be non-volatile, random-access read/write storage, and might be used for primary, secondary and off-line storage. Most rewritable and many write once optical disks already use phase change material to store information.\n\n; [[Holographic data storage]]: stores information optically inside [[crystal]]s or [[photopolymer]]s. Holographic storage can utilize the whole volume of the storage medium, unlike optical disc storage which is limited to a small number of surface layers. Holographic storage would be non-volatile, sequential access, and either write once or read/write storage. It might be used for secondary and off-line storage. See [[Holographic Versatile Disc]] (HVD).\n\n; [[Molecular memory]]: stores information in [[polymer]] that can store electric charge. Molecular memory might be especially suited for primary storage. The theoretical storage capacity of molecular memory is 10 terabits per square inch.<ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090219141438.htm New Method Of Self-assembling Nanoscale Elements Could Transform Data Storage Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301235710/https://www.sciencedaily.com//releases//2009//02//090219141438.htm |date=1 March 2009 }}.

The following solutions are commonly used and valid for most storage devices:\n\n* '''Device [[Disk mirroring|mirroring]] (replication)''' \u2013 A common solution to the problem is constantly maintaining an identical copy of device content on another device (typically of a same type). The downside is that this doubles the storage, and both devices (copies) need to be updated simultaneously with some overhead and possibly some delays. The upside is possible concurrent read of a same data group by two independent processes, which increases performance. When one of the replicated devices is detected to be defective, the other copy is still operational, and is being utilized to generate a new copy on another device (usually available operational in a pool of stand-by devices for this purpose).\n* '''Redundant array of independent disks''' ('''[[RAID]]''') \u2013 This method generalizes the device mirroring above by allowing one device in a group of N devices to fail and be replaced with the content restored (Device mirroring is RAID with N=2). RAID groups of N=5 or N=6 are common. N>2 saves storage, when comparing with N=2, at the cost of more processing during both regular operation (with often reduced performance) and defective device replacement.\n\nDevice mirroring and typical RAID are designed to handle a single device failure in the RAID group of devices. However, if a second failure occurs before the RAID group is completely repaired from the first failure, then data can be lost. The probability of a single failure is typically small. Thus the probability of two failures in a same RAID group in time proximity is much smaller (approximately the probability squared, i.e., multiplied by itself). If a database cannot tolerate even such smaller probability of data loss, then the RAID group itself is replicated (mirrored). In many cases such mirroring is done geographically remotely, in a different storage array, to handle also recovery from disasters (see disaster recovery above).\n\n=== Network connectivity ===\nA secondary or tertiary storage may connect to a computer utilizing [[computer network]]s. This concept does not pertain to the primary storage, which is shared between multiple processors to a lesser degree.\n\n* [[Direct-attached storage]] (DAS) is a traditional mass storage, that does not use any network. This is still a most popular approach. This [[retronym]] was coined recently, together with NAS and SAN.\n* [[Network-attached storage]] (NAS) is mass storage attached to a computer which another computer can access at file level over a [[local area network]], a private [[wide area network]], or in the case of [[File hosting service|online file storage]], over the [[Internet]]. NAS is commonly associated with the [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] and [[Server Message Block|CIFS/SMB]] protocols.\n* [[Storage area network]] (SAN) is a specialized network, that provides other computers with storage capacity. The crucial difference between NAS and SAN, is that NAS presents and manages file systems to client computers, while SAN provides access at block-addressing (raw) level, leaving it to attaching systems to manage data or file systems within the provided capacity. SAN is commonly associated with [[Fibre Channel]] networks.\n\n=== Robotic storage ===\nLarge quantities of individual magnetic tapes, and optical or magneto-optical discs may be stored in robotic tertiary storage devices. In tape storage field they are known as [[tape library|tape libraries]], and in optical storage field [[optical jukebox]]es, or optical disk libraries per analogy. Smallest forms of either technology containing just one drive device are referred to as [[autoloader (data storage device)|autoloaders]] or [[autochanger]]s.\n\nRobotic-access storage devices may have a number of slots, each holding individual media, and usually one or more picking robots that traverse the slots and load media to built-in drives. The arrangement of the slots and picking devices affects performance. Important characteristics of such storage are possible expansion options: adding slots, modules, drives, robots. Tape libraries may have from 10 to more than 100,000 slots, and provide [[terabyte]]s or [[petabyte]]s of near-line information. Optical jukeboxes are somewhat smaller solutions, up to 1,000 slots.\n\nRobotic storage is used for [[backup]]s, and for high-capacity archives in imaging, medical, and video industries. [[Hierarchical storage management]] is a most known archiving strategy of automatically ''migrating'' long-unused files from fast hard disk storage to libraries or jukeboxes. If the files are needed, they are ''retrieved'' back to disk.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Computer memory}}\n{{Wikiversity | Computer data storage}}\n\n=== Primary storage topics ===\n*

He realized that this was a product of the reverse of the usual reaction Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + CaCl<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2NaCl + CaCO<sub>3</sub>\u2193 and therefore that the final state of a reaction was a state of equilibrium between two opposing processes.  From p. 405: ''\" \u2026 la d\u00e9composition du muriate de soude continue donc jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il se soit form\u00e9 assez de muriate de chaux, parce que l'acide muriatique devant se partager entre les deux bases en raison de leur action, il arrive un terme o\u00f9 leurs forces se balancent.\"'' ( \u2026 the decomposition of the sodium chloride thus continues until enough calcium chloride is formed, because the hydrochloric acid must be shared between the two bases in the ratio of their action [i.e., capacity to react]; it reaches an end [point] at which their forces are balanced.)</ref> For any reaction mixture to exist at equilibrium, the [[reaction rate|rates]] of the forward and backward (reverse) reactions are equal. In the following [[chemical equation]] with arrows pointing both ways to indicate equilibrium,<ref>The notation {{eqm}} was proposed in 1884 by the Dutch chemist [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]]. See: {{cite book|last1=van 't Hoff|first1=J.H.|title=\u00c9tudes de Dynamique Chemique|trans-title=Studies of chemical dynamics|date=1884|publisher=Frederik Muller & Co.|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands|pages=4\u20135|url=https://archive.org/stream/etudesdedynamiqu00hoff#page/4/mode/2up|language=French}} Van 't Hoff called reactions that didn't proceed to completion \"limited reactions\".  From pp. 4\u20135:  ''\"Or M. Pfaundler a reli\u00e9 ces deux ph\u00e9nom\u00eanes \u2026 s'accomplit en m\u00eame temps dans deux sens oppos\u00e9s.\"'' (Now Mr. Pfaundler has joined these two phenomena in a single concept by considering the observed limit as the result of two opposing reactions, driving the one in the example cited to the formation of sea salt [i.e., NaCl] and nitric acid, [and] the other to hydrochloric acid and sodium nitrate.  This consideration, which experiment validates, justifies the expression \"chemical equilibrium\", which is used to characterize the final state of limited reactions.  I would propose to translate this expression by the following symbol:  \n:HCl + NO<sub>3</sub> Na {{eqm}} NO<sub>3</sub> H + Cl Na . \nI thus replace, in this case, the = sign in the chemical equation by the sign {{eqm}}, which in reality doesn't express just equality but shows also the direction of the reaction.  This clearly expresses that a chemical action occurs simultaneously in two opposing directions.)</ref> A and B are [[reactant]] chemical species, S and T are product species, and [[Alpha (letter)|''\u03b1'']], [[Beta (letter)|''\u03b2'']], [[sigma|''\u03c3'']], and [[Tau|''\u03c4'']] are the [[stoichiometric coefficient]]s of the respective reactants and products:\n:''\u03b1''&nbsp;A + ''\u03b2''&nbsp;B {{eqm}} ''\u03c3''&nbsp;S + ''\u03c4''&nbsp;T\n\nThe equilibrium concentration position of a reaction is said to lie \"far to the right\" if, at equilibrium, nearly all the reactants are consumed. Conversely the equilibrium position is said to be \"far to the left\" if hardly any product is formed from the reactants.\n\n[[Cato Maximilian Guldberg|Guldberg]] and [[Peter Waage|Waage]] (1865), building on Berthollet\u2019s ideas, proposed the [[law of mass action]]:\n\n:<math chem>\\begin{align}\n\\text{forward reaction rate} &= k_{+} \\ce{A}^\\alpha\\ce{B}^\\beta \\\\\n\\text{backward reaction rate} &= k_{-} \\ce{S}^\\sigma\\ce{T}^\\tau\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere A, B, S and T are [[activity (chemistry)|active masses]] and ''k''<sub>+</sub> and ''k''<sub>\u2212</sub> are [[rate constant]]s. Since at equilibrium forward and backward rates are equal:\n\n:<math chem> k_+ \\left\\{ \\ce A \\right\\}^\\alpha \\left\\{\\ce B \\right\\}^\\beta = k_{-} \\left\\{\\ce S \\right\\}^\\sigma\\left\\{\\ce T \\right\\}^\\tau</math>\n\nand the ratio of the rate constants is also a constant, now known as an [[equilibrium constant]].\n:<math chem>K_c=\\frac{k_+}{k_-}=\\frac{\\{\\ce S\\}^\\sigma \\{\\ce T\\}^\\tau } {\\{\\ce A\\}^\\alpha \\{\\ce B\\}^\\beta}</math>\n\nBy convention the products form the [[numerator]].\nHowever, the [[law of mass action]] is valid only for concerted one-step reactions that proceed through a single [[transition state]] and is '''not valid in general''' because [[reaction rate#Rate equation|rate equations]] do not, in general, follow the [[stoichiometry]] of the reaction as Guldberg and Waage had proposed (see, for example, [[nucleophilic aliphatic substitution]] by S<sub>N</sub>1 or reaction of [[hydrogen]] and [[bromine]] to form [[hydrogen bromide]]). Equality of forward and backward reaction rates, however, is a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary condition]] for chemical equilibrium, though it is not [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|sufficient]] to explain why equilibrium occurs.\n\nDespite the failure of this derivation, the equilibrium constant for a reaction is indeed a constant, independent of the activities of the various species involved, though it does depend on temperature as observed by the [[van 't Hoff equation]]. Adding a [[catalyst]] will affect both the forward reaction and the reverse reaction in the same way and will not have an effect on the equilibrium constant. The catalyst will speed up both reactions thereby increasing the speed at which equilibrium is reached.<ref name=aj>{{cite book|last1=Atkins |first1=Peter W. |last2=Jones |first2=Loretta  |title=Chemical Principles: The Quest for Insight |edition=2nd |ISBN=0-7167-9903-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Chemistry: Matter and Its Changes |first=James E. |last=Brady |publisher=Fred Senese |edition=4th |ISBN=0-471-21517-1}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[macroscopic]] equilibrium concentrations are constant in time, reactions do occur at the molecular level. For example, in the case of [[acetic acid]] dissolved in water and forming [[acetate]] and [[hydronium]] ions,\n:CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H + H<sub>2</sub>O \u21cc {{chem|CH|3|CO|2|\u2212}} + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>\na proton may hop from one molecule of acetic acid on to a water molecule and then on to an acetate anion to form another molecule of acetic acid and leaving the number of acetic acid molecules unchanged. This is an example of [[dynamic equilibrium]]. Equilibria, like the rest of thermodynamics, are statistical phenomena, averages of microscopic behavior.\n\n'''[[Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle]]''' (1884) predicts the behavior of an equilibrium system when changes to its reaction conditions occur. ''If a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium moves to partially reverse the change''. For example, adding more S from the outside will cause an excess of products, and the system will try to counteract this by increasing the reverse reaction and pushing the equilibrium point backward (though the equilibrium constant will stay the same).\n\nIf [[mineral acid]] is added to the acetic acid mixture, increasing the concentration of hydronium ion, the amount of dissociation must decrease as the reaction is driven to the left in accordance with this principle. This can also be deduced from the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction:\n:<math chem>K=\\frac {\\{\\ce{CH3CO2-}\\}\\{\\ce{H3O+}\\}} \\ce{\\{CH3CO2H\\}}</math>\nIf {H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>} increases {CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H} must increase and {{chem|CH|3|CO|2|\u2212}} must decrease. The H<sub>2</sub>O is left out, as it is the solvent and its concentration remains high and nearly constant.\n\nA quantitative version is given by the [[reaction quotient]].\n\n[[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. W. Gibbs]] suggested in 1873 that equilibrium is attained when the [[chemical potential|Gibbs free energy]] of the system is at its minimum value (assuming the reaction is carried out at constant temperature and pressure). What this means is that the derivative of the Gibbs energy with respect to [[reaction coordinate]] (a measure of the [[extent of reaction]] that has occurred, ranging from zero for all reactants to a maximum for all products) vanishes, signalling a [[stationary point]]. This derivative is called the reaction Gibbs energy (or energy change) and corresponds to the difference between the [[chemical potential]]s of reactants and products at the composition of the reaction mixture.<ref name=Atkins/> This criterion is both necessary and sufficient. If a mixture is not at equilibrium, the liberation of the excess Gibbs energy (or [[Helmholtz energy]] at constant volume reactions) is the \"driving force\" for the composition of the mixture to change until equilibrium is reached. The equilibrium constant can be related to the standard [[Gibbs energy|Gibbs free energy]] change for the reaction by the equation\n\n:<math>\\Delta_rG^\\ominus = -RT \\ln K_\\mathrm{eq}</math>\n\nwhere R is the [[universal gas constant]] and T the [[temperature]].\n\nWhen the reactants are [[solution|dissolved]] in a medium of high [[ionic strength]] the quotient of [[activity coefficient]]s may be taken to be constant. In that case the '''concentration quotient''', ''K''<sub>c</sub>,\n:<math chem>K_\\ce{c}=\\frac{[\\ce S]^\\sigma [\\ce T]^\\tau } {[\\ce A]^\\alpha [\\ce B]^\\beta}</math>\nwhere [A] is the [[concentration]] of A, etc., is independent of the [[analytical concentration]] of the reactants. For this reason, equilibrium constants for [[solution]]s are usually [[Determination of equilibrium constants|determined]] in media of high ionic strength. ''K<sub>c</sub>'' varies with [[ionic strength]], temperature and pressure (or volume). Likewise ''K<sub>p</sub>'' for gases depends on [[partial pressure]]. These constants are easier to measure and encountered in high-school chemistry courses.\n\n==Thermodynamics==\n\nAt constant temperature and pressure, one must consider the [[Gibbs free energy]], ''G'', while at constant temperature and volume, one must consider the [[Helmholtz free energy]]: ''A'', for the reaction; and at constant internal energy and volume, one must consider the entropy for the reaction: ''S''.\n\nThe constant volume case is important in [[geochemistry]] and [[atmospheric chemistry]] where pressure variations are significant. Note that, if reactants and products were in [[standard state]] (completely pure), then there would be no reversibility and no equilibrium. Indeed, they would necessarily occupy disjoint volumes of space. The mixing of the products and reactants contributes a large entropy (known as [[entropy of mixing]]) to states containing equal mixture of products and reactants. The standard Gibbs energy change, together with the Gibbs energy of mixing, determine the equilibrium state.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schultz|first1=Mary Jane|title=Why Equilibrium?

The relation between the Gibbs free energy and the equilibrium constant can be found by considering [[chemical potential]]s.<ref name = Atkins/>\n\nAt constant temperature and pressure, the [[Gibbs free energy]], ''G'', for the reaction depends only on the [[extent of reaction]]: ''\u03be'' (Greek letter [[Xi (letter)|xi]]), and can only decrease according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. It means that the derivative of ''G'' with ''\u03be'' must be negative if the reaction happens; at the equilibrium the derivative being equal to zero.\n:<math>\\left(\\frac {dG}{d\\xi}\\right)_{T,p} = 0~</math>:{{spaces|5}}equilibrium\n\nIn order to meet the thermodynamic condition for equilibrium, the Gibbs energy must be stationary, meaning that the derivative of ''G'' with respect to the [[extent of reaction]]: ''\u03be'', must be zero. It can be shown that in this case, the sum of [[chemical potential]]s of the products is equal to the sum of those corresponding to the reactants.

For solutions, equations such as the [[Debye\u2013H\u00fcckel equation]] or extensions such as [[Davies equation]]<ref>{{cite book|first=C. W. |last=Davies |title=Ion Association |publisher=Butterworths |date=1962}}</ref> [[Specific ion interaction theory]] or [[Pitzer equations]]<ref name=\"davies\">{{cite web|first1=I. |last1=Grenthe |first2=H. |last2=Wanner |url=http://www.nea.fr/html/dbtdb/guidelines/tdb2.pdf |title=Guidelines for the extrapolation to zero ionic strength}}</ref> may be used.<sup>[[#Software for chemical equilibria|Software (below)]]</sup> However this is not always possible. It is common practice to assume that ''\u0393'' is a constant, and to use the concentration quotient in place of the thermodynamic equilibrium constant. It is also general practice to use the term ''equilibrium constant'' instead of the more accurate ''concentration quotient''. This practice will be followed here.\n\nFor reactions in the gas phase [[partial pressure]] is used in place of concentration and [[fugacity coefficient]] in place of activity coefficient. In the real world, for example, when making [[Haber process|ammonia]] in industry, fugacity coefficients must be taken into account. Fugacity, ''f'', is the product of partial pressure and fugacity coefficient. The chemical potential of a species in the gas phase is given by\n:<math>\\mu = \\mu^{\\ominus} + RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{f}{\\mathrm{bar}} \\right) = \\mu^{\\ominus} + RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{p}{\\mathrm{bar}} \\right) + RT \\ln \\gamma </math>\nso the general expression defining an equilibrium constant is valid for both solution and gas phases.\n\n===Concentration quotients===\n\nIn aqueous solution, equilibrium constants are usually determined in the presence of an \"inert\" electrolyte such as [[sodium nitrate]] NaNO<sub>3</sub> or [[potassium perchlorate]] KClO<sub>4</sub>. The [[ionic strength]] of a solution is given by\n:<math> I = \\frac12\\sum_{i=1}^N c_i z_i^2 </math>\nwhere ''c<sub>i</sub>'' and ''z<sub>i</sub>'' stand for the concentration and ionic charge of ion type ''i'', and the sum is taken over all the ''N'' types of charged species in solution. When the concentration of dissolved salt is much higher than the analytical concentrations of the reagents, the ions originating from the dissolved salt determine the ionic strength, and the ionic strength is effectively constant. Since activity coefficients depend on ionic strength the activity coefficients of the species are effectively independent of concentration. Thus, the assumption that [[Gamma|''\u0393'']] is constant is justified. The concentration quotient is a simple multiple of the equilibrium constant.<ref>{{cite book|first=F. J. C. |last=Rossotti |first2=H. |last2=Rossotti |title=The Determination of Stability Constants |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=1961}}</ref>\n:<math> K_\\mathrm{c} = \\frac{K}{\\Gamma} </math>\nHowever, ''K''<sub>c</sub> will vary with ionic strength. If it is measured at a series of different ionic strengths the value can be extrapolated to zero ionic strength.<ref name=\"davies\"/> The concentration quotient obtained in this manner is known, paradoxically, as a thermodynamic equilibrium constant.\n\nTo use a published value of an equilibrium constant in conditions of ionic strength different from the conditions used in its determination, the value should be adjusted<sup>[[#Software for chemical equilibria|Software (below)]]</sup>.\n\n===Metastable mixtures===\n\nA mixture may appear to have no tendency to change, though it is not at equilibrium. For example, a mixture of [[Sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]] and [[oxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]] is [[Metastability|metastable]] as there is a [[Activation energy|kinetic barrier]] to formation of the product, [[Sulfur trioxide|SO<sub>3</sub>]].\n:2&nbsp;SO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> {{eqm}} 2&nbsp;SO<sub>3</sub>\n\nThe barrier can be overcome when a [[Catalysis|catalyst]] is also present in the mixture as in the [[contact process]], but the catalyst does not affect the equilibrium concentrations.\n\nLikewise, the formation of [[bicarbonate]] from [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] is very slow under normal conditions\n:CO<sub>2</sub> + 2&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} {{chem|HCO|3|\u2212}} + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>\nbut almost instantaneous in the presence of the catalytic [[enzyme]] [[carbonic anhydrase]].\n\n==Pure substances==\n\nWhen pure substances (liquids or solids) are involved in equilibria their activities do not appear in the equilibrium constant<ref name=CEM>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Concise Encyclopedia Chemistry |date=1994 |ISBN=0-89925-457-8}}</ref> because their numerical values are considered one.\n\nApplying the general formula for an equilibrium constant to the specific case of a dilute solution of acetic acid in water one obtains\n:CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H + H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>\n\n:<math>K_\\mathrm{c}=\\frac \\mathrm{[{CH_3CO_2}^-][{H_3O}^+]} \\mathrm{[{CH_3CO_2H}][{H_2O}]}</math>\n\nFor all but very concentrated solutions, the water can be considered a \"pure\" liquid, and therefore it has an activity of one. The equilibrium constant expression is therefore usually written as\n:<math>K=\\frac \\mathrm{[{CH_3CO_2}^-][{H_3O}^+]} \\mathrm{[{CH_3CO_2H}]} = K_\\mathrm{c}</math>.\n\nA particular case is the [[self-ionization of water]] itself\n\n:2&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nBecause water is the solvent, and has an activity of one, the self-ionization constant of water is defined as\n\n:<math>K_\\mathrm{w} = \\mathrm{[H^+][OH^-]}</math>\n\nIt is perfectly legitimate to write [H<sup>+</sup>] for the [[hydronium ion]] concentration, since the state of [[solvation]] of the proton is constant (in dilute solutions) and so does not affect the equilibrium concentrations. ''K''<sub>w</sub> varies with variation in ionic strength and/or temperature.\n\nThe concentrations of H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>\u2212</sup> are not independent quantities. Most commonly [OH<sup>\u2212</sup>] is replaced by ''K''<sub>w</sub>[H<sup>+</sup>]<sup>\u22121</sup> in equilibrium constant expressions which would otherwise include  [[hydroxide ion]].\n\nSolids also do not appear in the equilibrium constant expression, if they are considered to be pure and thus their activities taken to be one. An example is the [[Boudouard reaction]]:<ref name=CEM/>\n\n:2&nbsp;CO {{eqm}} CO<sub>2</sub> + C\n\nfor which the equation (without solid carbon) is written as:\n\n:<math>K_\\mathrm{c}=\\frac \\mathrm{[CO_2]} \\mathrm{[CO]^2}</math>\n\n==Multiple equilibria==\n\nConsider the case of a dibasic acid H<sub>2</sub>A.

The equations of mass balance are simply statements that demonstrate that the total concentration of each reactant must be constant by the law of [[conservation of mass]].\n\n===Mass-balance equations===\n\nIn general, the calculations are rather complicated or complex. For instance, in the case of a dibasic acid, H<sub>2</sub>A dissolved in water the two reactants can be specified as the [[conjugate base]], A<sup>2\u2212</sup>, and the [[hydronium|proton]], H<sup>+</sup>. The following equations of mass-balance could apply equally well to a base such as [[Ethylenediamine|1,2-diaminoethane]], in which case the base itself is designated as the reactant A:\n:<math>T_\\mathrm{A} = \\mathrm{[A] + [HA] +[H_2A]} \\,</math>\n:<math>T_\\mathrm{H} = \\mathrm{[H] + [HA] + 2[H_2A] - [OH]} \\,</math>\n\nWith T<sub>A</sub> the total concentration of species A. Note that it is customary to omit the ionic charges when writing and using these equations.\n\nWhen the equilibrium constants are known and the total concentrations are specified there are two equations in two unknown \"free concentrations\" [A] and [H]. This follows from the fact that [HA]&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03b2''<sub>1</sub>[A][H], [H<sub>2</sub>A]&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03b2''<sub>2</sub>[A][H]<sup>2</sup> and [OH]&nbsp;=&nbsp;''K''<sub>w</sub>[H]<sup>\u22121</sup>\n\n:<math> T_\\mathrm{A} = \\mathrm{[A]} + \\beta_1\\mathrm{[A][H]} + \\beta_2\\mathrm{[A][H]}^2 \\,</math>\n:<math> T_\\mathrm{H} = \\mathrm{[H]} + \\beta_1\\mathrm{[A][H]} + 2\\beta_2\\mathrm{[A][H]}^2 - K_w[\\mathrm H]^{-1} \\,</math>\n\nso the concentrations of the \"complexes\" are calculated from the free concentrations and the equilibrium constants.\nGeneral expressions applicable to all systems with two reagents, A and B would be\n:<math>T_\\mathrm{A}=[\\mathrm A]+\\sum_i p_i \\beta_i[\\mathrm A]^{p_i}[\\mathrm B]^{q_i}</math>\n:<math>T_\\mathrm{B}=[\\mathrm B]+\\sum_i q_i \\beta_i[\\mathrm A]^{p_i}[\\mathrm B]^{q_i}</math>\n\nIt is easy to see how this can be extended to three or more reagents.\n\n====Polybasic acids====\n[[File:Al hydrolysis.svg|thumb|right|Species concentrations during [[hydrolysis]] of the [[aluminium]].]]\nThe composition of solutions containing reactants A and H is easy to calculate as a function of [[pH|p[H]]]. When [H] is known, the free concentration [A] is calculated from the mass-balance equation in A.\n\nThe diagram alongside, shows an example of the hydrolysis of the [[aluminium]] [[Lewis acid]] Al<sup>3+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub><ref>The diagram was created with the program [http://www.hyperquad.co.uk/hyss.htm HySS]</ref> shows the species concentrations for a 5&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>\u22126</sup>&nbsp;M solution of an aluminium salt as a function of pH. Each concentration is shown as a percentage of the total aluminium.\n\n====Solution and precipitation====\n\nThe diagram above illustrates the point that a [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] that is not one of the main species in the solution equilibrium may be formed. At pH just below 5.5 the main species present in a 5&nbsp;\u03bcM solution of Al<sup>3+</sup> are [[aluminium hydroxide]]s Al(OH)<sup>2+</sup>, {{chem|Al|OH|2|+}} and {{chem|Al|13|(OH)|32|7+}}, but on raising the pH [[aluminium hydroxide|Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>]] precipitates from the solution. This occurs because Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> has a very large [[lattice energy]]. As the pH rises more and more Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> comes out of solution. This is an example of [[Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle]] in action: Increasing the concentration of the hydroxide ion causes more aluminium hydroxide to precipitate, which removes hydroxide from the solution. When the hydroxide concentration becomes sufficiently high the soluble aluminate, {{chem|Al(OH)|4|\u2212}}, is formed.\n\nAnother common instance where precipitation occurs is when a metal cation interacts with an anionic ligand to form an electrically neutral complex. If the complex is [[hydrophobic]], it will precipitate out of water. This occurs with the [[nickel]] ion Ni<sup>2+</sup> and [[dimethylglyoxime]], (dmgH<sub>2</sub>): in this case the lattice energy of the solid is not particularly large, but it greatly exceeds the energy of [[solvation]] of the molecule Ni(dmgH)<sub>2</sub>.\n\n===Minimization of Gibbs energy===\n\nAt equilibrium, at a specified temperature and pressure, the Gibbs energy ''G'' is at a minimum:\n\n:<math>dG= \\sum_{j=1}^m \\mu_j\\,dN_j = 0</math>\n\nFor a closed system, no particles may enter or leave, although they may combine in various ways. The total number of atoms of each element will remain constant. This means that the minimization above must be subjected to the constraints:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{j=1}^m a_{ij}N_j=b_i^0</math>\n\nwhere ''a<sub>ij</sub>'' is the number of atoms of element ''i'' in molecule ''j'' and ''b''{{su|b=''i''|p=0}} is the total number of atoms of element ''i'', which is a constant, since the system is closed. If there are a total of ''k'' types of atoms in the system, then there will be ''k'' such equations. If ions are involved, an additional row is added to the a<sub>ij</sub> matrix specifying the respective charge on each molecule which will sum to zero.\n\nThis is a standard problem in [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation]], known as [[constrained minimisation]]. The most common method of solving it is using the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], also known as [[undetermined multipliers]] (though other methods may be used).\n\nDefine:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{G}= G + \\sum_{i=1}^k\\lambda_i\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^m a_{ij}N_j-b_i^0\\right)=0</math>\n\nwhere the ''\u03bb<sub>i</sub>'' are the Lagrange multipliers, one for each element. This allows each of the ''N<sub>j</sub>'' and ''&lambda;<sub>j</sub>'' to be treated independently, and it can be shown using the tools of [[multivariate calculus]] that the equilibrium condition is given by\n\n:<math>0 = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{G}}{\\partial N_j} = \\mu_j + \\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i a_{ij} </math>\n:<math>0 = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{G}}{\\partial \\lambda_i} = \\sum_{j=1}^m a_{ij}N_j-b_i^0</math>\n\n(For proof see [[Lagrange multipliers]].) This is a set of (''m''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''k'') equations in (''m''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''k'') unknowns (the ''N<sub>j</sub>'' and the ''\u03bb<sub>i</sub>'') and may, therefore, be solved for the equilibrium concentrations ''N<sub>j</sub>'' as long as the chemical potentials are known as functions of the concentrations at the given temperature and pressure. (See [[Thermodynamic databases for pure substances]].) Note that the second equation is just the initial constraints for minimization.\n\nThis method of calculating equilibrium chemical concentrations is useful for systems with a large number of different molecules.

For example, given three fruits, say an apple, an orange and a pear, there are three combinations of two that can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or a pear and an orange.\nMore formally, a ''k''-'''combination''' of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is a subset of ''k'' distinct elements of ''S''. If the set has ''n'' elements, the number of ''k''-combinations is equal to the [[binomial coefficient]]\n\n:<math> \\binom nk = \\frac{n(n-1)\\dotsb(n-k+1)}{k(k-1)\\dotsb1},</math>\n\nwhich can be written using [[factorial]]s as <math>\\textstyle\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}</math> whenever <math>k\\leq n</math>, and which is zero when <math>k>n</math>. The set of all ''k''-combinations of a set ''S'' is often denoted by <math>\\textstyle\\binom Sk</math>.\n\nCombinations refer to the combination of ''n'' things taken ''k'' at a time without repetition. To refer to combinations in which repetition is allowed, the terms ''k''-selection,<ref>{{harvnb|Ryser|1963|loc=p. 7}} also referred to as an ''unordered selection''.</ref> ''k''-multiset,<ref>{{harvnb|Mazur|2010|loc=p. 10}}</ref> or ''k''-combination with repetition are often used.<ref>When the term ''combination'' is used to refer to either situation (as in {{harv|Brualdi|2010}}) care must be taken to clarify whether sets or multisets are being discussed.</ref> If, in the above example, it were possible to have two of any one kind of fruit there would be 3 more 2-selections: one with two apples, one with two oranges, and one with two pears.\n\nAlthough the set of three fruits was small enough to write a complete list of combinations, with large sets this becomes impractical. For example, a [[Hand (poker)|poker hand]] can be described as a 5-combination (''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5) of cards from a 52 card deck (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52). The 5 cards of the hand are all distinct, and the order of cards in the hand does not matter. There are 2,598,960 such combinations, and the chance of drawing any one hand at random is&nbsp;1&nbsp;/&nbsp;2,598,960.\n\n== Number of ''k''-combinations ==\n{{main|Binomial coefficient}}\n[[File:Combinations without repetition; 5 choose 3.svg|thumb|3-element subsets of a 5-element set]]\nThe [[Permutations and combinations#case in|number of ''k''-combinations]] from a given set ''S'' of ''n'' elements is often denoted in elementary combinatorics texts by <math>C(n,k)</math>, or by a variation such as <math>C^n_k</math>,  <math>{}_nC_k</math>, <math>{}^nC_k</math>, <math>C_{n,k}</math> or even <math>C_n^k</math> (the latter form was standard in French, Romanian, Russian, Chinese<ref>{{cite book |title = High School Textbook for full-time student (Required) Mathematics Book II B| edition=2nd | location = China|language = Chinese |date=June 2006| publisher = People's Education Press| pages = 107\u2013116 | isbn = 978-7-107-19616-4 }}</ref> and Polish texts{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}).  The same number however occurs in many other mathematical contexts, where it is denoted by <math>\\tbinom nk</math> (often read as \"''n'' choose ''k''\"); notably it occurs as a coefficient in the [[binomial formula]], hence its name '''binomial coefficient'''. One can define <math>\\tbinom nk</math> for all natural numbers ''k'' at once by the relation\n\n:<math>(1 + X)^n = \\sum_{k\\geq0}\\binom{n}{k} X^k,</math>\n\nfrom which it is clear that\n\n:<math>\\binom{n}{0} = \\binom{n}{n} = 1,</math>\n\nand further, \n\n:<math>\\binom{n}{k} = 0</math> for ''k''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''n''.\n\nTo see that these coefficients count ''k''-combinations from ''S'', one can first consider a collection of ''n'' distinct variables ''X''<sub>''s''</sub> labeled by the elements ''s'' of ''S'', and expand the [[Multiplication|product]] over all elements of&nbsp;''S'':\n\n:<math>\\prod_{s\\in S}(1+X_s);</math>\n\nit has 2<sup>''n''</sup> distinct terms corresponding to all the subsets of ''S'', each subset giving the product of the corresponding variables ''X''<sub>''s''</sub>. Now setting all of the ''X''<sub>''s''</sub> equal to the unlabeled variable ''X'', so that the product becomes {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')<sup>''n''</sup>}}, the term for each ''k''-combination from ''S'' becomes ''X''<sup>''k''</sup>, so that the coefficient of that power in the result equals the number of such ''k''-combinations.\n\nBinomial coefficients can be computed explicitly in various ways. To get all of them for the expansions up to {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')<sup>''n''</sup>}}, one can use (in addition to the basic cases already given) the recursion relation\n\n:<math>\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1} + \\binom{n - 1}{k},</math>\n\nfor 0 < ''k'' < ''n'', which follows from {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')<sup>''n''</sup> }}={{nowrap| (1 + ''X'')<sup>''n'' \u2212 1</sup>(1 + ''X'')}}; this leads to the construction of [[Pascal's triangle]].\n\nFor determining an individual binomial coefficient, it is more practical to use the formula\n\n:<math>\\binom nk = \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!}</math>.\n\nThe [[numerator]] gives the number of [[Permutations and combinations#case i|''k''-permutations]] of ''n'', i.e., of sequences of ''k'' distinct elements of ''S'', while the [[denominator]] gives the number of such ''k''-permutations that give the same ''k''-combination when the order is ignored.\n\nWhen ''k'' exceeds ''n''/2, the above formula contains factors common to the numerator and the denominator, and canceling them out gives the relation\n\n:<math> \\binom nk = \\binom n{n-k},</math>\n\nfor 0 \u2264 ''k'' \u2264 ''n''. This expresses a symmetry that is evident from the binomial formula, and can also be understood in terms of ''k''-combinations by taking the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of such a combination, which is an {{nowrap|(''n'' \u2212 ''k'')}}-combination.\n\nFinally there is a formula which exhibits this symmetry directly, and has the merit of being easy to remember:\n\n:<math> \\binom nk = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!},</math>\n\nwhere ''n''<nowiki>!</nowiki> denotes the [[factorial]] of ''n''. It is obtained from the previous formula by multiplying denominator and numerator by {{nowrap|(''n'' \u2212 ''k'')}}!, so it is certainly inferior as a method of computation to that formula.\n\nThe last formula can be understood directly, by considering the ''n''<nowiki>!</nowiki> permutations of all the elements of ''S''. Each such permutation gives a ''k''-combination by selecting its first ''k'' elements. There are many duplicate selections: any combined permutation of the first ''k'' elements among each other, and of the final (''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k'') elements among each other produces the same combination; this explains the division in the formula.\n\nFrom the above formulas follow relations between adjacent numbers in Pascal's triangle in all three directions:\n\n:<math>\n\\binom nk =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\binom n{k-1} \\frac {n-k+1}k &\\quad \\text{if } k > 0 \\\\\n\\binom {n-1}k \\frac n{n-k} &\\quad \\text{if } k < n \\\\\n\\binom {n-1}{k-1} \\frac nk &\\quad \\text{if } n, k > 0\n\\end{cases}\n</math>.\n\nTogether with the basic cases <math>\\tbinom n0=1=\\tbinom nn</math>, these allow successive computation of respectively all numbers of combinations from the same set (a row in Pascal's triangle), of ''k''-combinations of sets of growing sizes, and of combinations with a complement of fixed size {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 ''k''}}.\n\n=== Example of counting combinations ===\nAs a specific example, one can compute the number of five-card hands possible from a standard fifty-two card deck as:<ref>{{harvnb|Mazur|2010|loc=p. 21}}</ref>\n\n:<math> {52 \\choose 5} = \\frac{52\\times51\\times50\\times49\\times48}{5\\times4\\times3\\times2\\times1} = \\frac{311{,}875{,}200}{120} = \n2{,}598{,}960.</math>\n\nAlternatively one may use the formula in terms of factorials and cancel the factors in the numerator against parts of the factors in the denominator, after which only multiplication of the remaining factors is required:\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{2}\n  {52 \\choose 5}\n    &= \\frac{52!}{5!47!} \\\\[5pt]\n    &= \\frac{52\\times51\\times50\\times49\\times48\\times\\cancel{47!}}{5\\times4\\times3\\times2\\times\\cancel{1}\\times\\cancel{47!}} \\\\[5pt]\n    &= \\frac{52\\times51\\times50\\times49\\times48}{5\\times4\\times3\\times2} \\\\[5pt]\n    &= \\frac{(26\\times\\cancel{2})\\times(17\\times\\cancel{3})\\times(10\\times\\cancel{5})\\times49\\times(12\\times\\cancel{4})}{\\cancel{5}\\times\\cancel{4}\\times\\cancel{3}\\times\\cancel{2}} \\\\[5pt]\n    &= {26\\times17\\times10\\times49\\times12} \\\\[5pt]\n    &= 2{,}598{,}960.\n\\end{alignat}</math>\n\nAnother alternative computation, equivalent to the first, is based on writing\n\n:<math> {n \\choose k} = \\frac { ( n - 0 ) }1 \\times \\frac { ( n - 1 ) }2 \\times \\frac { ( n - 2 ) }3 \\times \\cdots \\times \\frac { ( n - (k - 1) ) }k,</math>\n\nwhich gives\n\n:<math> {52 \\choose 5} = \\frac{52}1 \\times \\frac{51}2 \\times \\frac{50}3 \\times \\frac{49}4 \\times \\frac{48}5 = 2{,}598{,}960</math>.\nWhen evaluated in the following order, {{math|52 \u00f7 1 \u00d7 51 \u00f7 2 \u00d7 50 \u00f7 3 \u00d7 49 \u00f7 4 \u00d7 48 \u00f7 5}}, this can be computed using only integer arithmetic. The reason is that when each division occurs, the intermediate result that is produced is itself a binomial coefficient, so no remainders ever occur.\n\nUsing the symmetric formula in terms of factorials without performing simplifications gives a rather extensive calculation:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n {52 \\choose 5} &= \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!} = \\frac{52!}{5!47!} \\\\[6pt]\n&= \\tfrac{80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000}{120\\times258,623,241,511,168,180,642,964,355,153,611,979,969,197,632,389,120,000,000,000} \\\\[6pt]\n&= 2{,}598{,}960.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n=== Enumerating ''k''-combinations ===\n\nOne can [[enumeration|enumerate]] all ''k''-combinations of a given set ''S'' of ''n'' elements in some fixed order, which establishes a [[bijection]] from an interval of <math>\\tbinom nk</math> integers with the set of those ''k''-combinations. Assuming ''S'' is itself ordered, for instance ''S'' = { 1, 2, \u2026, ''n'' }, there are two natural possibilities for ordering its ''k''-combinations: by comparing their smallest elements first (as in the illustrations above) or by comparing their largest elements first. The latter option has the advantage that adding a new largest element to ''S'' will not change the initial part of the enumeration, but just add the new ''k''-combinations of the larger set after the previous ones. Repeating this process, the enumeration can be extended indefinitely with ''k''-combinations of ever larger sets. If moreover the intervals of the integers are taken to start at&nbsp;0, then the ''k''-combination at a given place ''i'' in the enumeration can be computed easily from ''i'', and the bijection so obtained is known as the [[combinatorial number system]]. It is also known as \"rank\"/\"ranking\" and \"unranking\" in computational mathematics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~lucia/courses/5165-09/GenCombObj.pdf |format=PDF |title=Generating Elementary Combinatorial Objects |author=Lucia Moura |website=Site.uottawa.ca |accessdate=2017-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/combinat/subset.html |format=PDF |title=SAGE : Subsets |website=Sagemath.org |accessdate=2017-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThere are many ways to enumerate ''k'' combinations. One way is to visit all the binary numbers less than 2<sup>''n''</sup>. Choose those numbers having ''k'' nonzero bits, although this is very inefficient even for small ''n'' (e.g. ''n'' = 20 would require visiting about one million numbers while the maximum number of allowed ''k'' combinations is about 186 thousand for ''k'' = 10). The positions of these 1 bits in such a number is a specific ''k''-combination of the set { 1, \u2026, ''n'' }.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Combinations|title=Combinations - Rosetta Code|publisher=}}{{ugc|date=April 2017}}</ref> Another simple, faster way is to track ''k'' index numbers of the elements selected, starting with {0 .. ''k''\u22121} (zero-based) or {1 .. ''k''} (one-based) as the first allowed ''k''-combination and then repeatedly moving to the next allowed ''k''-combination by incrementing the last index number if it is lower than ''n''-1 (zero-based) or ''n'' (one-based) or the last index number ''x'' that is less than the index number following it minus one if such an index exists and resetting the index numbers after ''x'' to {''x''+1, ''x''+2, \u2026}.\n\n== Number of combinations with repetition ==\n{{See also|Multiset coefficient}}\n\nA ''k''-'''combination with repetitions''', or ''k''-'''multicombination''', or '''[[multiset|multisubset]]''' of size ''k'' from a set ''S'' is given by a sequence of ''k'' not necessarily distinct elements of ''S'', where order is not taken into account: two sequences define the same multiset if one can be obtained from the other by permuting the terms. In other words, the number of ways to sample ''k'' elements from a set of ''n'' elements allowing for duplicates (i.e., with replacement) but disregarding different orderings (e.g. {2,1,2} = {1,2,2}). Associate an index to each element of ''S'' and think of the elements of ''S'' as ''types'' of objects, then we can let <math>x_i</math> denote the number of elements of type ''i'' in a multisubset. The number of multisubsets of size ''k'' is then the number of nonnegative integer solutions of the [[Diophantine equation]]:<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=p. 52}}</ref>\n:<math>x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_n = k.</math>\nIf ''S'' has ''n'' elements, the number of such ''k''-multisubsets is denoted by,\n\n::<math>\\left(\\!\\!\\binom{n}{k}\\!\\!\\right),</math>\na notation that is analogous to the [[binomial coefficient]] which counts ''k''-subsets. This expression, ''n'' multichoose ''k'',<ref>{{harvnb|Benjamin|Quinn|2003|loc=p. 70}}</ref> can also be given in terms of binomial coefficients:\n\n:<math>\\left(\\!\\!\\binom{n}{k}\\!\\!\\right)=\\binom{n+k-1}{k}.</math>\n\nThis relationship can be easily proved using a representation known as [[Stars and bars (combinatorics)|stars and bars]].<ref>In the article [[Stars and bars (combinatorics)]] the roles of {{mvar|n}} and {{mvar|k}} are reversed.</ref> \n{{Hidden begin |showhide=left|title=Proof|titlestyle = background:lightgray;}}\nA solution of the above Diophantine equation can be represented by <math>x_1</math> ''stars'', a separator (a ''bar''), then <math>x_2</math> more stars, another separator, and so on. The total number of stars in this representation is ''k'' and the number of bars is ''n'' - 1 (since no separator is needed at the very end). Thus, a string of ''k'' + ''n'' - 1 symbols (stars and bars) corresponds to a solution if there are ''k'' stars in the string. Any solution can be represented by choosing ''k'' out of {{nobreak|''k'' + ''n'' - 1}} positions to place stars and filling the remaining positions with bars. For example, the solution <math>x_1 = 3, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 0, x_4 = 5</math> of the equation <math> x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 10</math> can be represented by\n<center><math>\\bigstar \\bigstar \\bigstar | \\bigstar \\bigstar | | \\bigstar \\bigstar \\bigstar \\bigstar \\bigstar</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Benjamin|Quinn|2003|loc=pp. 71 &ndash;72}}</ref></center>\nThe number of such strings is the number of ways to place 10 stars in 13 positions, <math>\\binom{13}{10} = \\binom{13}{3} = 286,</math> which is the number of 10-multisubsets of a set with 4 elements.\n{{Hidden end}}\n[[File:Combinations with repetition; 5 multichoose 3.svg|thumb|370px|[[Bijection]] between 3-subsets of a 7-set (left) and 3-multisets with elements from a 5-set (right).<br>This illustrates that <math>\\textstyle {7 \\choose 3} = \\left(\\!\\!{5 \\choose 3}\\!\\!\\right)</math>.]]\n\nAs with binomial coefficients, there are several relationships between these multichoose expressions.

Label the elements of ''S'' with numbers 0, 1, ..., {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}}, and choose a ''k''-combination from the set of numbers { 1, 2, ..., {{nowrap|''n'' + ''k'' \u2212 1}} } (so that there are {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} ''unchosen'' numbers). Now change this ''k''-combination into a ''k''-multicombination of ''S'' by replacing every (chosen) number ''x'' in the ''k''-combination by the element of ''S'' labeled by the ''number of unchosen numbers'' less than ''x''. This is always a number in the range of the labels, and it is easy to see that every ''k''-multicombination of ''S'' is obtained for one choice of a ''k''-combination.\n\nA concrete example may be helpful. Suppose there are 4 types of fruits (apple, orange, pear, banana) at a grocery store, and you want to buy 12 pieces of fruit. So ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 and ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;12. Use label 0 for apples, 1 for oranges, 2 for pears, and 3 for bananas. A selection of 12 fruits can be translated into a selection of 12 distinct numbers in the range 1,...,15 by selecting as many consecutive numbers starting from 1 as there are apples in the selection, then skip a number, continue choosing as many consecutive numbers as there are oranges selected, again skip a number, then again for pears, skip one again, and finally choose the remaining numbers (as many as there are bananas selected). For instance for 2 apples, 7 oranges, 0 pears and 3 bananas, the numbers chosen will be 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15. To recover the fruits, the numbers 1, 2 (not preceded by any unchosen numbers) are replaced by apples, the numbers 4,&nbsp;5,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;10 (preceded by one unchosen number: 3) by oranges, and the numbers 13, 14, 15 (preceded by three unchosen numbers: 3, 11, and 12) by bananas; there are no chosen numbers preceded by exactly 2 unchosen numbers, and therefore no pears in the selection. The total number of possible selections is\n\n<math>\\binom{4+12-1}{12} = \\left(\\!\\!\\!\\binom{4}{12}\\!\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{15}{12} = \\left(\\!\\!\\!\\binom{13}{3}\\!\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{15}{3} = \\frac{13\\times14\\times15}{1\\times2\\times3} = 455. </math>\n-->\n\n== Number of ''k''-combinations for all ''k'' ==\n{{See also|Binomial coefficient#Sum of coefficients row}}\n\nThe number of ''k''-combinations for all ''k'' is the number of subsets of a set of ''n'' elements. There are several ways to see that this number is 2<sup>''n''</sup>. In terms of combinations, <math>\\sum_{0\\leq{k}\\leq{n}}\\binom nk = 2^n</math>, which is the sum of the ''n''th row (counting from 0) of the [[Binomial coefficient#Sum of coefficients row|binomial coefficients]] in [[Pascal's triangle]]. These combinations (subsets) are enumerated by the 1 digits of the set of [[base 2]] numbers counting from 0 to 2<sup>''n''</sup> &nbsp;\u2212&nbsp; 1, where each digit position is an item from the set of ''n''.\n\nGiven 3 cards numbered 1 to 3, there are 8 distinct combinations ([[subsets]]), including the [[empty set]]:\n\n:<math>| \\{ \\{\\}  ;  \\{1\\}  ;  \\{2\\}  ;  \\{1, 2\\} ; \\{3\\}  ;  \\{1, 3\\}  ;  \\{2, 3\\}  ;  \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\}| = 2^3 = 8</math>\n\nRepresenting these subsets (in the same order) as base 2 numerals:\n::0 \u2013 000\n::1 \u2013 001\n::2 \u2013 010\n::3 \u2013 011\n::4 \u2013 100\n::5 \u2013 101\n::6 \u2013 110\n::7 \u2013 111\n\n== Probability: sampling a random combination ==\n\nThere are various [[algorithms]] to pick out a random combination from a given set or list. [[Rejection sampling]] is extremely slow for large sample sizes. One way to select a ''k''-combination efficiently from a population of size ''n'' is to iterate across each element of the population, and at each step pick that element with a dynamically changing probability of <math>\\frac{k-\\#\\text{samples chosen}}{n- \\#\\text{samples visited}}</math>.

The arrows indicate information flow.]]\n\n'''Computer software''', or simply '''software''', is a collection of [[data (computing)|data]] or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work. This is in contrast to [[Computer hardware|physical hardware]], from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], computer software is all [[information]] processed by [[computer system]]s, [[Computer program|program]]s and [[data]]. Computer software includes [[computer program]]s, [[Library (computing)|libraries]] and related non-executable [[Data (computing)|data]], such as [[Software documentation|online documentation]] or [[digital media]]. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.\n\nAt the lowest level,{{Clarify|reason=What 'level' means can be unclear to non-technical readers|date=August 2018}} [[executable code]] consists of [[Machine code|machine language]] instructions supported by an individual [[Microprocessor|processor]]\u2014typically a [[central processing unit]] (CPU) or a [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU). A machine language consists of groups of [[Binary numbers|binary values]] signifying [[Instruction (computing)|processor instructions]] that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer\u2014an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction [[System call|may also invoke]] one of many [[Input/output|input or output operations]], for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the [[User (computing)|user]]. The processor [[Instruction cycle|executes]] the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to [[branch instruction|\"jump\" to a different instruction]], or is [[Interrupt|interrupted]] by the operating system. {{As of|2015}}, most [[Personal computer|personal computers]], [[smartphone]] devices and [[Server (computing)|servers]] have [[Multi-core processor|processors with multiple execution units]] or [[Multiprocessing|multiple processors performing computation]] together, and computing has become a much more [[Concurrent computing|concurrent]] activity than in the past.\n\nThe majority of software is written in [[high-level programming language]]s. They are easier and more efficient for programmers to use because they are closer than machine languages to [[natural language]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Compiler construction|url=http://www.cs.uu.nl/education/vak.php?vak=INFOMCCO|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102143144/http://www.cs.uu.nl/education/vak.php?vak=INFOMCCO|archivedate=2 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> High-level languages are translated into machine language using a [[compiler]] or an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] or a combination of the two. Software may also be written in a low-level [[assembly language]], which has strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an [[Assembly language|assembler]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of software}}\nAn outline ([[algorithm]]) for what would have been the first piece of software was written by [[Ada Lovelace]] in the 19th century, for the planned [[Analytical Engine]]. However, neither the Analytical Engine nor any software for it were ever created.\n\nThe first theory about software\u2014prior to creation of computers as we know them today\u2014was proposed by Alan Turing in his 1935 essay ''On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem'' (decision problem).\n\nThis eventually led to the creation of the academic fields of [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]]; Both fields study software and its creation. Computer science is the theoretical study of computer and software (Turing's essay is an example of computer science), where as software engineering is the application of engineering and development of software.\n\nHowever, prior to 1946, software was not yet the programs stored in the memory of stored-program digital computers, as we now understand it. The first electronic computing devices were instead rewired in order to \"reprogram\" them.\n\n==Types==\n{{See also|List of software categories}}\n\nOn virtually all computer platforms, software can be grouped into a few broad categories.\n\n===Purpose, or domain of use===\n{{Ecommerce}}\nBased on the goal, computer software can be divided into:\n\n* '''[[Application software]]''' <br> which is software that uses the computer system to perform special functions or provide [[video game|entertainment functions]] beyond the basic operation of the computer itself. There are many different types of application software, because the range of tasks that can be performed with a modern computer is so large\u2014see [[list of software]].\n* '''[[System software]]''' <br> which is software that directly operates the '''[[computer hardware]]''', to provide basic functionality needed by users and other software, and to provide a platform for running application software.<ref>{{cite web|title=System Software|url=http://home.olemiss.edu/~misbook/sfsysfm.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010530092843/http://home.olemiss.edu/~misbook/sfsysfm.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 May 2001|publisher=The University of Mississippi|df=dmy-all}}</ref> System software includes:\n** '''[[Operating system]]s''' <br> which are essential collections of software that manage resources and provides common services for other software that runs \"on top\" of them. [[Supervisory program]]s, [[boot loader]]s, [[shell (computing)|shells]] and [[window system]]s are core parts of operating systems. In practice, an operating system comes bundled with additional software (including application software) so that a user can potentially do some work with a computer that only has one operating system.\n** '''[[Device driver]]s''' <br> which operate or control a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. Each device needs at least one corresponding device driver; because a computer typically has at minimum at least one input device and at least one output device, a computer typically needs more than one device driver.\n** '''[[Software utility|Utilities]]''' <br> which are computer [[Programs and Features|programs]] designed to assist users in the maintenance and care of their computers.\n* '''[[Malicious software]]''' or '''malware''' <br> which is software that is developed to harm and disrupt computers. As such, malware is undesirable. Malware is closely associated with computer-related crimes, though some malicious programs may have been designed as [[practical joke]]s.\n\n===Nature or domain of execution===\n* [[Desktop applications]] such as [[web browser]]s and [[Microsoft Office]], as well as [[smartphone]] and [[Tablet computer|tablet]] applications (called \"[[mobile app|apps]]\"). (There is a push in some parts of the software industry to merge desktop applications with mobile apps, to some extent. [[Windows 8]], and later [[Ubuntu Touch]], tried to allow the same style of application user interface to be used on desktops, laptops and mobiles.)\n* [[JavaScript]] scripts are pieces of software traditionally embedded in [[web pages]] that are run directly inside the [[web browser]] when a web page is loaded without the need for a web browser plugin. Software written in other programming languages can also be run within the web browser if the software is either translated into JavaScript, or if a web browser plugin that supports that language is installed; the most common example of the latter is [[ActionScript]] scripts, which are supported by the [[Adobe Flash]] plugin.\n* [[Server software]], including:\n** [[Web application]]s, which usually run on the [[web server]] and output dynamically generated web pages to web browsers, using e.g. [[PHP]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[ASP.NET]], or even [[Node.js|JavaScript that runs on the server]]. In modern times these commonly include some JavaScript to be run in the web browser as well, in which case they typically run partly on the server, partly in the web browser.\n* [[Plug-in (computing)|Plugins]] and extensions are software that extends or modifies the functionality of another piece of software, and require that software be used in order to function;\n* [[Embedded software]] resides as [[firmware]] within [[embedded system]]s, devices dedicated to a single use or a few uses such as [[car]]s and [[television]]s (although some embedded devices such as wireless chipsets can ''themselves'' be part of an ordinary, non-embedded computer system such as a PC or smartphone).<ref>{{cite web|title=Embedded Software\u2014Technologies and Trends|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2009/03/mso2009030014.html|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|date=May\u2013June 2009|accessdate=6 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028045823/http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2009/03/mso2009030014.html|archivedate=28 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the embedded system context there is sometimes no clear distinction between the system software and the application software. However, some embedded systems run [[embedded operating system]]s, and these systems do retain the distinction between system software and application software (although typically there will only be one, fixed, application which is always run).\n* [[Microcode]] is a special, relatively obscure type of embedded software which tells the processor ''itself'' how to execute machine code, so it is actually a lower level than machine code. It is typically proprietary to the processor manufacturer, and any necessary correctional microcode software updates are supplied by them to users (which is much cheaper than shipping replacement processor hardware). Thus an ordinary programmer would not expect to ever have to deal with it.\n\n===Programming tools===\n{{Main article|Programming tool}}\nProgramming tools are also software in the form of programs or applications that [[software developer]]s (also known as\n''programmers, coders, hackers'' or ''software engineers'') use to create, [[Debugging|debug]], [[Software maintenance|maintain]] (i.e. improve or fix), or otherwise [[Technical support|support]] software. \n\nSoftware is written in one or more programming languages; there are many programming languages in existence, and each has at least one implementation, each of which consists of its own set of programming tools. These tools may be relatively self-contained programs such as [[compiler]]s, [[debugger]]s, [[interpreter (computing)|interpreters]], [[linker (computing)|linkers]], and [[text editor]]s, that can be combined together to accomplish a task; or they may form an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE), which combines much or all of the functionality of such self-contained tools. IDEs may do this by either invoking the relevant individual tools or by re-implementing their functionality in a new way. An IDE can make it easier to do specific tasks, such as searching in files in a particular project. Many programming language implementations provide the option of using both individual tools or an IDE.\n\n==Topics==\n===Architecture===\n{{See also|Software architecture}}\nUsers often see things differently from programmers. People who use modern general purpose computers (as opposed to [[embedded system]]s, [[analog computer]]s and [[supercomputer]]s) usually see three layers of software performing a variety of tasks: platform, application, and user software.\n\n* '''Platform software''' <br> The [[Platform (computing)|Platform]] includes the [[firmware]], [[device driver]]s, an [[operating system]], and typically a [[graphical user interface]] which, in total, allow a user to interact with the computer and its [[peripheral]]s (associated equipment). Platform software often comes bundled with the computer. On a [[Personal computer|PC]] one will usually have the ability to change the platform software.\n* '''Application software''' <br> [[Application software]] or Applications are what most people think of when they think of software. Typical examples include office suites and video games. [[Application software]] is often purchased separately from computer hardware. Sometimes applications are bundled with the computer, but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications. Applications are usually independent programs from the operating system, though they are often tailored for specific platforms. Most users think of compilers, databases, and other \"system software\" as applications.\n* '''User-written software''' <br> [[End-user development]] tailors systems to meet users' specific needs. User software include spreadsheet templates and [[word processor]] templates. Even email filters are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is. Depending on how competently the user-written software has been integrated into default application packages, many users may not be aware of the distinction between the original packages, and what has been added by co-workers.\n\n===Execution===\n{{Main article|Execution (computing)}}\nComputer software has to be \"loaded\" into the [[computer storage|computer's storage]] (such as the [[hard drive]] or [[Computer memory|memory]]). Once the software has loaded, the computer is able to ''execute'' the software. This involves passing [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] from the [[application software]], through the system software, to the hardware which ultimately receives the instruction as [[machine language|machine code]]. Each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation\u2014moving [[data (computing)|data]], carrying out a [[computation]], or altering the [[control flow]] of instructions.\n\nData movement is typically from one place in memory to another. Sometimes it involves moving data between memory and registers which enable high-speed data access in the CPU. Moving data, especially large amounts of it, can be costly. So, this is sometimes avoided by using \"pointers\" to data instead. Computations include simple operations such as incrementing the value of a variable data element. More complex computations may involve many operations and data elements together.<!-- This section is simply to long for this article and needs to be compressed into the intro above, or moved to the article itself.\n\nInstructions may be performed sequentially, conditionally, or iteratively. Sequential instructions are those operations that are performed one after another. Conditional instructions are performed such that different sets of instructions execute depending on the value(s) of some data. In some languages this is known as an \"if\" statement. Iterative instructions are performed repetitively and may depend on some data value. This is sometimes called a \"loop.\" Often, one instruction may \"call\" another set of instructions that are defined in some other program or [[module (programming)|module]]. When more than one computer processor is used, instructions may be executed simultaneously.\n\nA simple example of the way software operates is what happens when a user selects an entry such as \"Copy\" from a menu. In this case, a conditional instruction is executed to copy text from data in a 'document' area residing in memory, perhaps to an intermediate storage area known as a 'clipboard' data area. If a different menu entry such as \"Paste\" is chosen, the software may execute the instructions to copy the text from the clipboard data area to a specific location in the same or another document in memory.\n\nDepending on the application, even the example above could become complicated. The field of software engineering endeavors to manage the complexity of how software operates. This is especially true for software that operates in the context of a large or powerful [[computer system]].\n\nCurrently, almost the only limitations on the use of computer software in applications is the ingenuity of the designer/programmer. Consequently, large areas of activities (such as playing grand master level chess) formerly assumed to be incapable of software simulation are now routinely programmed. The only area that has so far proved reasonably secure from software simulation is the realm of human art\u2014 especially, pleasing music and literature.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nKinds of software by operation: [[computer program]] as [[executable]], [[source code]] or [[script (computer programming)|script]], [[computer configuration|configuration]].-->\n\n===Quality and reliability===\n{{Main article|Software quality|Software testing|Software reliability}}\nSoftware quality is very important, especially for [[commercial software|commercial]] and system software like [[Microsoft Office]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]]. If software is faulty (buggy), it can delete a person's work, crash the computer and do other unexpected things. Faults and errors are called \"[[Software bug|bugs]]\" which are often discovered during alpha and beta testing. Software is often also a victim to what is known as [[software aging]], the progressive performance degradation resulting from a combination of unseen bugs.\n\nMany bugs are discovered and eliminated (debugged) through [[software testing]]. However, software testing rarely\u2014if ever\u2014eliminates every bug; some programmers say that \"every program has at least one more bug\" (Lubarsky's Law).<ref name=\"github\">{{cite web | url=https://github.com/mark-watson/scripting-intelligence-book-examples/blob/master/part1/wikipedia_text/software.txt | title=scripting intelligence book examples | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106154317/https://github.com/mark-watson/scripting-intelligence-book-examples/blob/master/part1/wikipedia_text/software.txt | archivedate=6 November 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the [[Waterfall model|waterfall]] method of software development, separate testing teams are typically employed, but in newer approaches, collectively termed [[agile software development]], developers often do all their own testing, and demonstrate the software to users/clients regularly to obtain feedback. Software can be tested through [[unit testing]], [[regression testing]] and other methods, which are done manually, or most commonly, automatically, since the amount of code to be tested can be quite large. For instance, [[NASA]] has extremely rigorous software testing procedures for many operating systems and communication functions. Many NASA-based operations interact and identify each other through command programs. This enables many people who work at NASA to check and evaluate functional systems overall. Programs containing command software enable hardware engineering and system operations to function much easier together.\n\n===License===\n{{Main article|Software license}}\nThe software's license gives the user the right to use the software in the licensed environment, and in the case of [[free software license]]s, also grants other rights such as the right to make copies.\n\n[[Proprietary software]] can be divided into two types:\n\n* [[freeware]], which includes the category of \"free trial\" software or \"[[freemium]]\" software (in the past, the term [[shareware]] was often used for free trial/freemium software). As the name suggests, freeware can be used free, although in the case of free trials or freemium software, this is sometimes only true for a limited period of time or with limited functionality.\n* software available for a fee, often inaccurately termed \"[[commercial software]]\", which can only be legally used on purchase of a license.\n\n[[Open source software]], on the other hand, comes with a [[free software license]], granting the recipient the rights to modify and redistribute the software.\n\n===Patents===\n{{Main article|Software patent|Software patent debate}}\nSoftware patents, like other types of patents, are theoretically supposed to give an inventor an exclusive, time-limited license for a ''detailed idea (e.g. an algorithm) on how to implement'' a piece of software, or a component of a piece of software. Ideas for useful things that software could ''do'', and user ''requirements'', are not supposed to be patentable, and concrete implementations (i.e. the actual software packages implementing the patent) are not supposed to be patentable either\u2014the latter are already covered by copyright, generally automatically. So software patents are supposed to cover the middle area, between requirements and concrete implementation. In some countries, a requirement for the claimed invention to have an effect on the physical world may also be part of the requirements for a software patent to be held valid\u2014although since ''all'' useful software has effects on the physical world, this requirement may be open to debate. Meanwhile, American copyright law was applied to various aspects of the writing of the software code.<ref> Gerardo Con D\u00edaz, \"The Text in the Machine: American Copyright Law and the Many Natures of Software, 1974\u20131978,\u201d ''Technology and Culture'' 57 (October 2016), 753\u201379.  </ref>\n\nSoftware patents are controversial in the software industry with many people holding different views about them. One of the sources of controversy is that the aforementioned split between initial ideas and patent does not seem to be honored in practice by patent lawyers\u2014for example the patent for [[Aspect-Oriented Programming]] (AOP), which purported to claim rights over ''any'' programming tool implementing the idea of AOP, howsoever implemented. Another source of controversy is the effect on innovation, with many distinguished experts and companies arguing that software is such a fast-moving field that software patents merely create vast additional litigation costs and risks, and actually retard innovation. In the case of debates about software patents outside the United States, the argument has been made that large American corporations and patent lawyers are likely to be the primary beneficiaries of allowing or continue to allow software patents.\n\n==Design and implementation==\n{{Main article|Software development|Computer programming|Software engineering}}\nDesign and implementation of software varies depending on the complexity of the software. For instance, the design and creation of [[Microsoft Word]] took much more time than designing and developing [[Microsoft Notepad]] because the latter has much more basic functionality.\n\nSoftware is usually designed and created (aka coded/written/programmed) in [[integrated development environment]]s (IDE) like [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], [[IntelliJ IDEA|IntelliJ]] and [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] that can simplify the process and [[compiler|compile]] the software (if applicable). As noted in a different section, software is usually created on top of existing software and the [[application programming interface]] (API) that the underlying software provides like [[GTK+]], JavaBeans or [[Swing (Java)|Swing]]. Libraries (APIs) can be categorized by their purpose. For instance, the [[Spring framework|Spring Framework]] is used for implementing [[enterprise application]]s, the [[Windows Forms]] library is used for designing graphical user interface (GUI) applications like [[Microsoft Word]], and [[Windows Communication Foundation]] is used for designing [[web service]]s. When a program is designed, it relies upon the API. For instance, if a user is designing a Microsoft Windows desktop application, he or she might use the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] Windows Forms library to design the desktop application and call its API's functions like ''Form1.Close()'' and ''Form1.Show()''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/default.aspx |title=MSDN Library |accessdate=2010-06-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611204810/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/default.aspx |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> to close or open the application, and write the additional operations him/herself that it needs to have. Without these APIs, the programmer needs to write these functionalities entirely themselves. Companies like [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and [[Microsoft]] provide their own APIs so that many applications are written using their [[Library (computing)|software libraries]] that usually have numerous APIs in them.\n\n[[Data structure]]s such as [[hash table]]s, [[array data type|arrays]], and [[binary tree]]s, and [[algorithm]]s such as [[quicksort]], can be useful for creating software.\n\nComputer software has special economic characteristics that make its design, creation, and distribution different from most other economic goods.{{Specify|Which characteristics?|date=May 2012}}<ref>{{cite journal |author=v.

More informal terms for programmer also exist such as \"coder\" and \"'''hacker'''\"{{Spaced ndash}}although use of the latter word may cause confusion, because it is more often used to mean [[Hacker (computer security)|someone who illegally breaks into computer systems]].\n\n==Industry and organizations==\n{{Main article|Software industry}}\nA great variety of software companies and programmers in the world comprise a software industry. Software can be quite a profitable industry: [[Bill Gates]], the co-founder of [[Microsoft]] was the richest person in the world in 2009, largely due to his ownership of a significant number of shares in Microsoft, the company responsible for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Microsoft Office]] software products - both market leaders in their respective product categories.\n\nNon-profit software organizations include the [[Free Software Foundation]], [[GNU Project]] and [[Mozilla Foundation]]. Software standard organizations like the [[W3C]], [[IETF]] develop recommended software standards such as [[XML]], [[HTTP]] and [[HTML]], so that software can interoperate through these standards.\n\nOther well-known large software companies include [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Novell]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Symantec]], [[Adobe Systems]], [[Sidetrade]] and [[Corel]], while small companies often provide innovation.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Software release life cycle]]\n* [[Independent software vendor]]\n* [[List of software]]\n* [[Software asset management]]\n* [[Open-source software]]\n{{portal bar|Software|Free software|Information technology}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links | wikt=software | commons=Special:Search/Software | b= | n= | s= | v=Computer Software | voy= |q=no}}\n* {{dmoz|Computers/Software}}<!--ref name=\"github\"/-->\n\n{{Software digital distribution platforms|state=collapsed}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[Category:Computing]]\n[[Category:Computer science]]\n[[Category:Software| ]]\n[[Category:Mathematical and quantitative methods (economics)]]", "sha1": "bisfegte0ec6ktz2v91i7rl8g46zega"}}, {"title": "Personal computer hardware", "ns": "0", "id": "5310", "redirect": {"title": "Computer hardware"}, "revision": {"id": "584893385", "parentid": "584323551", "timestamp": "2013-12-06T19:53:38Z", "contributor": {"username": "Jamesx12345", "id": "17300358"}, "comment": "going to migrate to [[Computer hardware]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#Redirect [[Computer hardware]]", "sha1": "3duca63fn8c24adr52ah6736dbbqgy9"}}, {"title": "Computer programming", "ns": "0", "id": "5311", "revision": {"id": "865099885", "parentid": "865099877", "timestamp": "2018-10-21T18:38:24Z", "contributor": {"username": "ClueBot NG", "id": "13286072"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverting possible vandalism by [[Special:Contribs/99.126.219.53|99.126.219.53]] to version by Favonian.

Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating [[algorithm]]s, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen [[programming language]] (commonly referred to as '''coding'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yearofcodes.tumblr.com/what-is-coding|title=What is coding|author=Shaun Bebbington|year=2014|accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://yearofcodes.tumblr.com/what-is-programming|title=What is programming|author=Shaun Bebbington|year=2014|accessdate=2014-03-03}}</ref>). The [[source code]] of a program is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the [[Domain (software engineering)|application domain]], specialized algorithms, and formal [[logic]].\n\nRelated tasks include [[Software testing|testing]], [[debugging]], maintaining a program's [[source code]], implementation of [[Build automation|build systems]], and management of derived artifacts such as [[machine code]] of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term ''[[software development]]'' is used for this larger process with the term ''programming'', ''implementation'', or ''coding'' reserved for the actual writing of source code. [[Software engineering]] combines [[engineering]] techniques with software development practices.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of programming languages}}\n[[File:Ada lovelace.jpg|thumb|[[Ada Lovelace]], whose notes added to the end of [[Luigi Menabrea]]'s paper included the first [[algorithm]] designed for processing by an [[Analytical Engine]].

However, with the concept of the [[stored-program computer]]s introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in [[computer memory]].\n\n[[Machine code]] was the language of early programs, written in the [[instruction set]] of the particular machine, often in [[binary numeral system|binary]] notation. [[Assembly language]]s were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a text format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine language, any two machines with [[Comparison of instruction set architectures|different instruction sets]] also have different assembly languages.\n\n[[File:IBM402plugboard.Shrigley.wireside.jpg|thumb|Wired control panel for an [[IBM 402 Accounting Machine]].]]\n[[High-level language]]s allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are syntactically richer, and more capable of [[abstraction (computer science)|abstracting]] the code, making it targetable to varying machine instruction sets via compilation declarations and heuristics. They harness the power of computers to make programming easier<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17704662/|title=Fortran creator John Backus dies|work=msnbc.com|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> by allowing programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula using [[infix notation]] (e.g., {{nowrap|Y &#0061; X*2 + 5*X + 9}}) for example. [[FORTRAN]], the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation which permitted the abstraction of reusable blocks of code, came out in 1957<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17704662/ |title=Fortran creator John Backus dies - Tech and gadgets- msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> and many other languages were soon developed - in particular, [[COBOL]] aimed at commercial data processing, and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] for computer research.\n\nPrograms were mostly still entered using punched cards or [[paper tape]]. See [[computer programming in the punch card era]]. By the late 1960s, [[data storage device]]s and [[computer terminal]]s became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into the computers. [[Text editor]]s were developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punched cards.\n\n==Modern programming==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2010}}\n\n===Quality requirements===\nWhatever the approach to development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties. The following properties are among the most important:\n*[[Reliability engineering#Software reliability|Reliability]]: how often the results of a program are correct. This depends on conceptual correctness of algorithms, and minimization of programming mistakes, such as mistakes in resource management (e.g., [[buffer overflow]]s and [[race condition]]s) and logic errors (such as division by zero or [[off-by-one error]]s).\n*[[Robustness (computer science)|Robustness]]: how well a program anticipates problems due to errors (not bugs). This includes situations such as incorrect, inappropriate or corrupt data, unavailability of needed resources such as memory, operating system services and network connections, user error, and unexpected power outages.\n*[[Usability]]: the [[ergonomics]] of a program: the ease with which a person can use the program for its intended purpose or in some cases even unanticipated purposes. Such issues can make or break its success even regardless of other issues. This involves a wide range of textual, graphical and sometimes hardware elements that improve the clarity, intuitiveness, cohesiveness and completeness of a program's user interface.\n*[[Software portability|Portability]]: the range of [[computer hardware]] and [[operating system]] platforms on which the source code of a program can be [[compiled]]/[[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] and run. This depends on differences in the programming facilities provided by the different platforms, including hardware and operating system resources, expected behavior of the hardware and operating system, and availability of platform specific compilers (and sometimes libraries) for the language of the source code.\n*[[Maintainability]]: the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers in order to make improvements or customizations, fix [[Software bug|bugs]] and [[Vulnerability (computing)|security holes]], or adapt it to new environments. Good practices<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wisdomgeek.com/programming/tips-become-good-programmer/|title=Programming 101: Tips to become a good programmer - Wisdom Geek|date=2016-05-19|website=Wisdom Geek|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref> during initial development make the difference in this regard. This quality may not be directly apparent to the end user but it can significantly affect the fate of a program over the long term.\n*[[Algorithmic efficiency|Efficiency]]/[[performance engineering|performance]]: Measure of system resources a program consumes (processor time, memory space, slow devices such as disks, network bandwidth and to some extent even user interaction): the less, the better. This also includes careful management of resources, for example cleaning up [[temporary file]]s and eliminating [[memory leak]]s.\n\n===Readability of source code===\nIn computer programming, [[readability]] refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose, [[control flow]], and operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including portability, usability and most importantly maintainability.\n\nReadability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading, trying to understand and modifying existing source code, rather than writing new source code. Unreadable code often leads to bugs, inefficiencies, and [[Code duplication|duplicated code]]. A study<ref>James L. Elshoff, Michael Marcotty, [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/358589.358596 Improving computer program readability to aid modification], Communications of the ACM, v.25 n.8, p.512-521, Aug 1982.</ref> found that a few simple readability transformations made code shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it.\n\nFollowing a consistent [[programming style]] often helps readability. However, readability is more than just programming style. Many factors, having little or nothing to do with the ability of the computer to efficiently compile and execute the code, contribute to readability.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Readability | title=Readability | author=Multiple (wiki) | work=Docforge | accessdate=2010-01-30 }}</ref> Some of these factors include:\n*Different [[indent style]]s (whitespace)\n*[[Comment (computer programming)|Comments]]\n*[[decomposition (computer science)|Decomposition]]\n*[[Naming conventions (programming)|Naming conventions]] for objects (such as variables, classes, procedures, etc.)\n\nThe [[separation of presentation and content|presentation]] aspects of this (such as indents, line breaks, color highlighting, and so on) are often handled by the [[source code editor]], but the content aspects reflect the programmer's talent and skills.\n\nVarious [[visual programming language]]s have also been developed with the intent to resolve readability concerns by adopting non-traditional approaches to code structure and display. [[Integrated development environment]]s (IDEs) aim to integrate all such help. Techniques like [[Code refactoring]] can enhance readability.\n\n===Algorithmic complexity===\nThe academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problem. For this purpose, algorithms are classified into ''orders'' using so-called [[Big O notation]], which expresses resource use, such as execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with a variety of well-established algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances.\n\n===Methodologies===\nThe first step in most formal software development processes is requirements analysis, followed by testing to determine value modeling, implementation, and failure elimination (debugging). There exist a lot of differing approaches for each of those tasks. One approach popular for [[requirements analysis]] is [[Use Case]] analysis. Many programmers use forms of [[Agile software development]] where the various stages of formal software development are more integrated together into short cycles that take a few weeks rather than years. There are many approaches to the Software development process.\n\nPopular modeling techniques include Object-Oriented Analysis and Design ([[OOAD]]) and Model-Driven Architecture ([[Model-Driven Architecture|MDA]]). The Unified Modeling Language ([[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]) is a notation used for both the OOAD and MDA.\n\nA similar technique used for database design is Entity-Relationship Modeling ([[Entity-Relationship Model|ER Modeling]]).\n\nImplementation techniques include imperative languages ([[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] or [[procedural programming|procedural]]), [[functional programming|functional languages]], and [[logic programming|logic languages]].\n\n===Measuring language usage===\n{{Main|Measuring programming language popularity}}\nIt is very difficult to determine what are the most popular of modern programming languages. Methods of measuring programming language popularity include: counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language,<ref>[http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2007/09/11/226631/sslcomputer-weekly-it-salary-survey-finance-boom-drives-it-job.htm Survey of Job advertisements mentioning a given language]</ref> the number of books sold and courses teaching the language (this overestimates the importance of newer languages), and estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language (this underestimates the number of users of business languages such as COBOL).\n\nSome languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications, while some languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications. For example, [[COBOL]] is still strong in corporate data centers<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Robert|title=The Cobol Brain Drain|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2504568/data-center/the-cobol-brain-drain.html|publisher=Computer World|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> often on large [[mainframe computer]]s, [[Fortran]] in engineering applications, [[scripting language]]s in [[World Wide Web|Web]] development, and [[C (programming language)|C]] in [[embedded software]]. Many applications use a mix of several languages in their construction and use.  New languages are generally designed around the syntax of a prior language with new functionality added, (for example [[C++]] adds object-orientation to C, and Java adds memory management and [[bytecode]] to C++, but as a result, loses efficiency and the ability for low-level manipulation).\n\n===Debugging===\n[[File:H96566k.jpg|thumb|The [[Software bug|bug]] from 1947 which is at the origin of a popular (but incorrect) etymology for the common term for a software defect.]]\n{{main|Debugging}}\nDebugging is a very important task in the software development process since having defects in a program can have significant consequences for its users. Some languages are more prone to some kinds of faults because their specification does not require compilers to perform as much checking as other languages. Use of a [[static code analysis]] tool can help detect some possible problems. Normally the first step in debugging is to attempt to reproduce the problem. This can be a non-trivial task, for example as with parallel processes or some unusual software bugs. Also, specific user environment and usage history can make it difficult to reproduce the problem.\n\nAfter the bug is reproduced, the input of the program may need to be simplified to make it easier to debug. For example, a bug in a compiler can make it crash when parsing some large source file. However, after simplification of the test case, only few lines from the original source file can be sufficient to reproduce the same crash. Such simplification can be done manually, using a divide-and-conquer approach. The programmer will try to remove some parts of original test case and check if the problem still exists. When debugging the problem in a GUI, the programmer can try to skip some user interaction from the original problem description and check if remaining actions are sufficient for bugs to appear.\n\nDebugging is often done with [[Integrated development environment|IDE]]s like [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], [[Visual Studio]], [[Xcode]], [[Kdevelop]], [[NetBeans]] and [[Code::Blocks]]. Standalone debuggers like [[GDB]] are also used, and these often provide less of a visual environment, usually using a [[command line]]. Some text editors such as [[Emacs]] allow GDB to be invoked through them, to provide a visual environment.\n\n==Programming languages==\n{{Main|Programming language|List of programming languages}}\n\nDifferent programming languages support different styles of programming (called ''[[programming paradigm]]s''). The choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task, availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best suited for the task at hand will be selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who know the language to build a team, the availability of compilers for that language, and the efficiency with which programs written in a given language execute. Languages form an approximate spectrum from \"low-level\" to \"high-level\"; \"low-level\" languages are typically more machine-oriented and faster to execute, whereas \"high-level\" languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly. It is usually easier to code in \"high-level\" languages than in \"low-level\" ones.\n\n[[Allen Downey]], in his book ''How To Think Like A Computer Scientist'', writes:\n\n:The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language:\n:*Input: Gather data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.\n:*Output: Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.\n:*Arithmetic: Perform basic arithmetical operations like addition and multiplication.\n:*Conditional Execution: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.\n:*Repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.\n\nMany computer languages provide a mechanism to call functions provided by [[shared library|shared libraries]]. Provided the functions in a library follow the appropriate run-time conventions (e.g., method of passing [[argument (computer science)|arguments]]), then these functions may be written in any other language.\n\n==Programmers==\n{{Main|Programmer}}\n{{See also|Software developer|Software engineer}}\n\nComputer programmers are those who write computer software.

This experience inspired the text, which reflects on how evil can exist in a world governed by God (the problem of [[theodicy]]), and how happiness is still attainable amidst fickle fortune, while also considering the nature of happiness and God. It has been described as \"by far the most interesting example of [[prison literature]] the world has ever seen.\"<ref>Catholic Encyclopedia, [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02610b.htm ''Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius'']. The quote is commonly seen in a number of sources, but without attribution; the Catholic Encyclopedia article (by William Turner, 1907) is the oldest \u201cknown\u201d citation found. In fact the phrase is originally from [https://archive.org/details/boethiusanessay00stewuoft ''Boethius, an essay''] (1891), by [[H. F. Stewart]], [https://archive.org/stream/boethiusanessay00stewuoft#page/107/mode/1up page 107] (past paragraph).</ref>\n\nA link to Christianity is often assumed, yet there is no reference made to Jesus Christ or Christianity or any other specific religion other than a few oblique references to Pauline scripture, such as the symmetry between the opening lines of Book 4 Chapter 3 and 1 Corinthians 9:24. God is however represented not only as an eternal and all-knowing being, but as the source of all Good.\n\nBoethius writes the book as a conversation between himself and Lady Philosophy. Lady Philosophy consoles Boethius by discussing the transitory nature of fame and wealth (\"no man can ever truly be secure until he has been forsaken by Fortune\"), and the ultimate superiority of things of the mind, which she calls the \"one true good\". She contends that happiness comes from within, and that virtue is all that one truly has, because it is not imperilled by the vicissitudes of fortune.\n\nBoethius engages questions such as the nature of [[predestination]] and [[free will]], why [[Problem of evil|evil men often prosper and good men fall into ruin]], [[human nature]], [[virtue]], and [[justice]]. He speaks about the nature of free will and [[determinism]] when he asks if God knows and sees all, or does man have free will. On human nature, Boethius says that humans are essentially good and only when they give in to \u201cwickedness\u201d do they \u201csink to the level of being an animal.\u201d On justice, he says criminals are not to be abused, rather treated with sympathy and respect, using the analogy of doctor and patient to illustrate the ideal relationship between prosecutor and criminal.\n\nIn the ''Consolation'', Boethius answered religious questions without reference to Christianity, relying solely on natural philosophy and the Classical [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] tradition. He believed in the correspondence between faith and reason. The truths found in Christianity would be no different from the truths found in philosophy.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Chadwick |first=Henry |editor=Edward Craig |encyclopedia=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=Boethius, Anicius Manlius Severinus (c.480-525/6) |year=1998 |publisher=Routledge |quote=The ''Opuscula sacra'' regard faith and reason as independent but parallel and compatible ways of attaining to higher metaphysical truths, and the independent validity of logical reasoning is also an underlying presupposition throughout ''De consolatione''.}}</ref> In the words of Henry Chadwick, \"If the ''Consolation'' contains nothing distinctively Christian, it is also relevant that it contains nothing specifically pagan either...[it] is a work written by a Platonist who is also a Christian.\"<ref>Henry Chadwick, ''Boethius: The Consolations of Music, Logic, Theology and Philosophy'', 1990, {{ISBN|0-19-826549-2}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n{{quote|To acquire a taste for it is almost to become naturalised in the Middle Ages \u2014 <small>[[C.

It is through Boethius that much of the thought of the Classical period was made available to the Western Medieval world. It has often been said Boethius was the \u201c[[last of the Romans]] and the first of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]\u201d.<ref name=\"Dante Divine\" />\n\n[[Image:Consolation of philosophy 1385 boethius images.jpg|thumb|200px|From a 1385 Italian manuscript of the ''Consolation'': Miniatures of Boethius teaching and in prison]]\n\nThe philosophical message of the book fits well with the religious piety of the Middle Ages. Readers were encouraged not to seek worldly goods such as money and power, but to seek internalized virtues. Evil had a purpose, to provide a lesson to help change for good; while suffering from evil was seen as virtuous. Because God ruled the universe through Love, prayer to God and the application of Love would lead to true happiness.<ref name=\"Beck\">Sanderson Beck (1996).</ref> The Middle Ages, with their vivid sense of an overruling fate, found in Boethius an interpretation of life closely akin to the spirit of Christianity. ''The Consolation of Philosophy'' stands, by its note of fatalism and its affinities with the Christian doctrine of humility, midway between the pagan philosophy of [[Seneca the Younger]] and the later Christian philosophy of consolation represented by [[Thomas \u00e1 Kempis]].<ref name=Cambridge>''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]'', [http://www.bartleby.com/211/0605.html Volume I Ch.6.5: ''De Consolatione Philosophiae''], 1907\u20131921.</ref>\n\nThe book is heavily influenced by [[Plato]] and his [[Socratic Dialogue|dialogues]] (as was Boethius himself).<ref name=Cambridge/> Its popularity can in part be explained by its [[Neoplatonic]] and Christian ethical messages, although current scholarly research is still far from clear exactly why and how the work became so vastly popular in the Middle Ages.\n\n[[Image:ForutuneWheel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Lady Fortune]] with [[Rota Fortunae|the Wheel of Fortune]] in a medieval manuscript of a work by [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]; ''The Consolation of Philosophy'' was responsible for the popularity of the goddess of Fortune and the wheel of fortune in the Middle Ages]]\n\nTranslations into the [[vernacular]] were done by famous notables, including [[King Alfred]] ([[Old English language|Old English]]), [[Jean de Meun]] ([[Old French]]), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] ([[Middle English]]), [[Queen Elizabeth I]] ([[Early Modern English]]), and [[Notker Labeo]] ([[Old High German]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nFound within the ''Consolation'' are themes that have echoed throughout the Western canon: the female figure of wisdom that informs Dante, the ascent through the layered universe that is shared with Milton, the reconciliation of opposing forces that find their way into Chaucer in The Knight's Tale, and the Wheel of Fortune so popular throughout the Middle Ages.\n\nCitations from it occur frequently in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divina Commedia]]''. Of Boethius, Dante remarked ''\u201cThe blessed soul who exposes the deceptive world to anyone who gives ear to him.\u201d<ref>''Dante ''The Divine Comedy''. \u201cblessed souls\u201d inhabit Dante's Paradise, and appear as flames. (see note above).</ref>\n\nBoethian influence can be found nearly everywhere in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s poetry, e.g. in ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', ''[[The Knight's Tale]]'', ''[[The Clerk's Tale]]'', ''[[The Franklin's Tale]]'', ''[[The Parson's Tale]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Melibee]]'', in the character of Lady Nature in ''[[The Parliament of Fowls]]'' and some of the shorter poems, such as ''Truth'', ''The Former Age'' and ''Lak of Stedfastnesse''. Chaucer translated the work in his ''[[Boece (Chaucer)|Boece]]''.\n\nThe [[Italians|Italian]] composer [[Luigi Dallapiccola]] used some of the text in his choral work ''[[Canti di prigionia]]'' (1938).  The [[Australia]]n composer [[Peter Sculthorpe]] quoted parts of it in his opera or music theatre work ''[[Rites of Passage (Sculthorpe)|Rites of Passage]]'' (1972\u201373), which was commissioned for the opening of the [[Sydney Opera House]] but was not ready in time.\n\n[[Tom Shippey]] in ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'' says how \u201cBoethian\u201d much of the treatment of evil is in [[Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Shippey says that Tolkien knew well the translation of Boethius that was made by King Alfred and he quotes some \u201cBoethian\u201d remarks from [[Frodo]], [[Treebeard]] and [[Elrond]].<ref>Tom Shippey, ''The Road to Middle-earth'', pg. 140, {{ISBN|0-395-33973-1}}, (1983).</ref>\n\nBoethius and ''Consolatio Philosophiae'' are cited frequently by the main character Ignatius J. Reilly in the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]'' (1980).\n\nIt is a [[prosimetrum|prosimetrical]] text, meaning that it is written in alternating sections of [[prose]] and metered [[Meter (poetry)|verse]]. In the course of the text, Boethius displays a virtuosic command of the forms of [[Latin poetry]]. It is classified as a [[Menippean satire]], a fusion of [[allegory|allegorical]] tale, [[platonic dialogue]], and lyrical poetry.\n\nIn the 20th century there were close to four hundred manuscripts still surviving, a testament to its popularity.{{citation needed| date= March 2017}}\n\n==Reconstruction==\n\nIn 2016, researchers from the [[University of Cambridge]] reconstructed the original melodies to which The Consolation of Philosophy was performed 1,000 years ago.<ref>University of Cambridge, [http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/first-performance-in-1000-years-lost-songs-from-the-middle-ages-are-brought-back-to-life-0 ''First performance in 1000 years: lost songs are brought back to life by Cambridge researchers'']</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Allegory in the Middle Ages]]\n*[[Stoicism]]\n*[[Rota Fortunae|The Wheel of Fortune]]\n*[[Consolatio]]\n*''[[Metres of Boethius]]''\n*[[Girdle Book]]\n*[[Prosimetrum]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Boethius, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0te1I5u6hFEC ''The Consolation of Philosophy''].\n** Trans.

Li Mu Bai ([[Chow Yun-fat]]) is an accomplished [[Wudang Sect|Wudang]] swordsman and Yu Shu Lien ([[Michelle Yeoh]]) heads a private security company. Yu Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai have feelings for each other, but because Shu Lien had been engaged to Mu Bai's closest friend, Meng Sizhao,<ref name=\"YenMovieRol\">{{cite web|url=http://moviehole.net/201362831yen-confirms-crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon-rumours|title=Yen confirms Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon rumours|author=Caffeinated Clint|publisher=Moviehole|date=March 18, 2013|accessdate=2013-04-14}}</ref> before his death, Shu Lien and Mu Bai feel bound by loyalty to Meng Sizhao and have not acted on their feelings for one another. Mu Bai, after choosing to retire, asks Shu Lien to give his sword \"Green Destiny\" to their benefactor Sir Te ([[Sihung Lung]]) in [[Beijing]]. Long ago, Mu Bai's master was murdered by Jade Fox ([[Cheng Pei-pei]]), a woman who sought to learn Wudang skills. While at Sir Te's place, Shu Lien makes the acquaintance of Jen Yu ([[Zhang Ziyi]]), who is the daughter of a rich and powerful Governor Yu and is about to get married.\n\nOne evening, a masked thief sneaks into Sir Te's estate and steals the Green Destiny. Mu Bai and Shu Lien trace the theft to Governor Yu's compound, where Jade Fox had been posing as Jen's governess for many years. Mu Bai makes the acquaintance of Inspector Tsai (Wang Deming), a police investigator from the provinces, and his daughter May (Li Li), who have come to Peking in pursuit of Fox. Fox challenges the pair and Sir Te's servant Master Bo (Gao Xi'an) to a showdown that night. Following a protracted battle, the group is on the verge of defeat when Mu Bai arrives and outmaneuvers Fox. Before Mu Bai can kill Fox, the masked thief reappears and helps Fox. Fox kills Tsai before fleeing with the thief (who is revealed to be Jen). After seeing Jen fight Mu Bai, Fox realizes Jen had been secretly studying the Wudang manual and may have surpassed her in combat skills.\n\nAt night, a desert bandit named Lo ([[Chang Chen]]) breaks into Jen's bedroom and asks her to leave with him. A [[flashback (continuity)|flashback]] reveals that in the past, when Governor Yu and his family were traveling in the western deserts, Lo and his bandits had raided Jen's caravan and Lo had stolen her comb. She pursued him to his desert cave to get her comb back. However, the pair soon fell passionately in love. Lo eventually convinced Jen to return to her family, though not before telling her a legend of a man who jumped off a cliff to make his wishes come true. Because the man's heart was pure, he did not die. Lo came to Beijing to persuade Jen not to go through with her arranged marriage.  However, Jen refuses to leave with him. Later, Lo interrupts Jen's wedding procession, begging her to leave with him. Nearby, Shu Lien and Mu Bai convince Lo to wait for Jen at [[Wudang Mountains|Mount Wudang]], where he will be safe from Jen's family, who are furious with him. Jen runs away from her husband on their wedding night before the marriage could be consummated. Disguised in male clothing, she is accosted at an inn by a large group of warriors; armed with the Green Destiny and her own superior combat skills, she emerges victorious.\n\nJen visits Shu Lien, who tells her that Lo is waiting for her at Mount Wudang. After an angry exchange, the two women engage in a duel. Shu Lien is the superior fighter, but Jen wields the Green Destiny: the sword destroys each weapon that Shu Lien wields, until Shu Lien finally manages to defeat Jen with a broken sword.  When Shu Lien shows mercy, Jen cuts Shu Lien's arm.  Mu Bai arrives and pursues Jen into a bamboo forest. Mu Bai confronts Jen and offers to take her as his student. She arrogantly promises to accept him as her teacher if he can take Green Destiny from her in three moves.  Mu Bai is able to take the sword in only one move, but Jen goes back on her word and flees. Mu Bai decides to throw the sword over a waterfall. Jen dives into an adjoining river to retrieve the sword and is then rescued by Fox. Fox puts Jen into a drugged sleep and places her in a cavern; Mu Bai and Shu Lien discover her there. Fox suddenly reappears and attacks the others with poisoned darts. Mu Bai blocks the needles with his sword and avenges his master's death by mortally wounding Fox, only to realize that one of the darts hit him in the neck. Fox dies, confessing that her goal had been to kill Jen because Jen had hidden the secrets of Wudang's best fighting techniques from her.\n\nAs Jen leaves to prepare an antidote for the poisoned dart, Mu Bai prepares to die. With his last breaths, he finally confesses his love for Shu Lien. He dies in her arms as Jen returns, too late to save him. The Green Destiny is returned to Sir Te. Jen later goes to Mount Wudang and spends one last night with Lo. The next morning, Lo finds Jen standing on a bridge overlooking the edge of the mountain. In an echo of the legend that they spoke about in the desert, she asks him to make a wish. He wishes for them to be together again, back in the desert. The movie ends with Jen jumping off the bridge and Lo looks at her with despair.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Chow Yun Fat for wiki.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Actor Chow Yun-Fat who portrayed Li Mu Bai]]\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Chow Yun-fat]] as Li Mu Bai (C: \u674e\u6155\u767d, P: ''L\u01d0 M\u00f9b\u00e1i'')\n* [[Michelle Yeoh]] as Yu Shu Lien (T: \u4fde\u79c0\u84ee, S: \u4fde\u79c0\u83b2, P: ''Y\u00fa Xi\u00f9li\u00e1n'')\n* [[Zhang Ziyi]] as Jen Yu (English subtitled version) / Yu Jiaolong (English dubbed version) (T: \u7389\u5b0c\u9f8d, S: \u7389\u5a07\u9f99, P: ''Y\u00f9 Ji\u0101ol\u00f3ng'')\n* [[Chang Chen]] as Lo \"Dark Cloud\" (English subtitled version) / Luo Xiaohu (English dubbed version) (T: \u7f85\u5c0f\u864e, S: \u7f57\u5c0f\u864e, P: ''Lu\u00f3 Xi\u01ceoh\u01d4'')\n* [[Cheng Pei-pei]] as Jade Fox (C: \u78a7\u773c\u72d0\u72f8, P: ''B\u00ecy\u01cen H\u00fali'')\n* [[Sihung Lung]] as Sir Te (T: \u8c9d\u52d2\u723a, C: \u8d1d\u52d2\u7237, P: ''B\u00e8i-l\u00e8y\u00e9'')\n* Li Fazeng as Governor Yu\n* Gao Xi'an as Bo\n* Hai Yan as Madam Yu\n* Wang Deming as Police inspector Tsai / Prefect Cai Qiu\n* Li Li as May, Tsai's daughter\n* Huang Suying as Aunt Wu\n* Yang Rui as Maid\n* Li Kai as Gou Jun Pei\n* Feng Jianhua as Gou Jun Sinung\n* Ma Zhongxuan as Mi Biao\n* Li Baocheng as Fung Machete Chang\n* Yang Yongde as Monk Jing\n* Zhang Shaocheng as Nightman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Themes and interpretations==\n\n===Title===\nThe name \"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\" is a literal translation of the [[Chengyu|Chinese idiom]] \"\u81e5\u864e\u85cf\u9f8d\" which describes a place or situation that is full of unnoticed masters. It is from a poem of the ancient Chinese poet [[Yu Xin]]'s (513\u2013581) that reads \"\u6697\u77f3\u7591\u85cf\u864e\uff0c\u76e4\u6839\u4f3c\u81e5\u9f8d\", which means \"behind the rock in the dark probably hides a tiger, and the coiling giant root resembles a crouching dragon.\"<ref name=\"title\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zdic.net/c/7/172/385491.htm|title=Chinese Dictionary \u2013 Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref> The last character in Xiaohu and Jiaolong's names mean \"Tiger\" and \"Dragon\", respectively.\n\n=== Gender roles ===\n\nSome prominent martial arts styles traditionally were held to have been originated by women, e.g. ''[[History of Wing Chun]]'' credits a Buddhist nun Ng Mui teaching Yim Wing-Chun the style.  The film's title reference to masters one does not notice necessarily includes mostly women, and suggests the advantage of a female bodyguard.  Traditional weapons taught in [[Wing Chun]] are exactly those easily concealed (butterfly knives) or similar to those taught in Japanese [[Aikido]] primarily to women (long pole).<ref>https://www.thoughtco.com/history-and-style-guide-wing-chun-2308285</ref>  The style emphasizes centerline blows to vital areas, as opposed to maiming strikes against limbs, thus seems intended for death blows, knockouts, and tactics generally used by physically weaker opponents seeking to win in a single strike rather than engage in an extended confrontation.  Again, the title suggests powerful creatures that strike by surprise.\n\n===Teacher-student relationship===\nA teacher's desire to have a worthy student, the obligations between a student and a master, and tensions in these relationships are central to the characters' motives, conflicts between the characters, and the unfolding of the film's plot. Li Mu Bai is burdened with the responsibility for avenging his master's death, and turns his back on retirement to live up to this obligation. His fascination with the prospect of having Jen as a disciple also motivates his behavior, and that of Jade Fox.\n\nRegarding conflicts in the student-teacher relationship, the potential for exploitation created by the subordinate position of the student and the tensions that exist when a student surpasses or resists a teacher are explored.  Jen hides her mastery of martial arts from her teacher, Jade Fox, which leads both to their parting of ways and to Jade Fox's attempt on Jen's life. At the same time, Jade Fox's own unorthodox relationship with a Wudang master (whom she claims would not teach her, but did take sexual advantage of her) brought her to a life of crime.\n\n===Poison===\nPoison is also a significant theme in the film. In the world of martial arts, poison is considered the act of one who is too cowardly and dishonorable to fight; and indeed, the only character who explicitly fits these characteristics is Jade Fox. The poison is a weapon of her bitterness,<ref>Fairlamb, Horace L. \"Romancing the Tao: How Ang Lee Globalized Ancient Chinese Wisdom,\" ''symploke'' vol. 15, No. 1-2 (2007), p.196.</ref> and quest for vengeance: she poisons the master of Wudang, attempts to poison Jen, and succeeds in killing Mu Bai using a poisoned needle.\n\nHowever, the poison is not only of the physical sort: Jade Fox's tutelage of Jen has left Jen spiritually poisoned, which can be seen in the lying, stealing, and betrayal Jen commits. However, Jen is never seen to use poison herself, even though she was trained by Jade Fox. This indicates that she may yet be reformed and integrated into society. In further play on this theme by the director, Jade Fox, as she dies, refers to the poison from a young child, \"the deceit of an eight-year-old girl,\" obviously referring to what she considers her own spiritual poisoning by her young apprentice Jen. Li Mu Bai himself warns that without guidance, Jen could become a \"poison dragon\".\n\n==Production==\nThe film was originally written as a novel series by [[Wang Dulu]] starting in the late 1930s. The film is loosely adapted from the storyline of the fourth book in the series, ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (novel)|Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]''.\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Mount cangyan 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Cangyan]], including the bridge pictured above, was one of many filming locations for the film.]]\nAlthough its [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] was presented to Taiwan, ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' was in fact an international [[Co-production (film)|co-production]] between companies in four regions: the Chinese company [[China Film Co-Production Corporation]]; the American companies [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia]],<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017-04-05|title=Barbara Robinson (Producer)|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbara_Robinson_(Producer)&oldid=773934875|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}</ref> [[Sony Pictures Classics]] and [[Good Machine]]; the Hong Kong company EDKO Film; and the Taiwanese Zoom Hunt International Productions Company, Ltd; as well as the unspecified United China Vision, and Asia Union Film and Entertainment Ltd., created solely for this film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/442944/Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon/original-print-info.html|title=CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (2000): Original Print Information|author=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon/cast/134505|title=Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Cast & Details| work=[[TV Guide]]|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nThe film was made in Beijing, with location shooting in the [[Anhui]], [[Hebei]], [[Jiangsu]], and [[Xinjiang]] provinces of China.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon/production-details.html|title=Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) -- Production Details|publisher=[[Yahoo Movies]]}}</ref> The first phase of shooting was in the [[Gobi Desert]] where it consistently rained.

Ang Lee, who was educated in the West, personally edited the subtitles to ensure they were satisfactory for Western audiences.\n\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Main|Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (soundtrack)}}\nThe score was composed by [[Tan Dun]], originally performed by [[Shanghai Symphony Orchestra]], Shanghai National Orchestra, and Shanghai Percussion Ensemble. It also features many solo passages for cello played by [[Yo-Yo Ma]]. The \"last track\" (\"A Love Before Time\") features [[Coco Lee]], who later performed it at the Academy Awards.

Carloman resigned office in 746, preferring to enter the church as a monk. Pepin brought the question of the kingship before [[Pope Zachary]], asking whether it was logical for a king to have no royal power. The pope handed down his decision in 749, decreeing that it was better for Pepin to be called king, as he had the powers of high office as Mayor, so as not to confuse the hierarchy. He, therefore, ordered him to become the ''true king''.<ref name=\"France/Pippin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/40284/Pippin-III |title=France :: Pippin III \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=24 April 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 750, Pepin was elected by an assembly of the Franks, anointed by the archbishop, and then raised to the office of king. The Pope branded Childeric III as \"the false king\" and ordered him into a monastery. The Merovingian dynasty was thereby replaced by the [[Carolingian]] dynasty, named after Charles Martel. In 753, [[Pope Stephen II]] fled from Italy to Francia, appealing to Pepin for assistance for the rights of St. Peter. He was supported in this appeal by Carloman, Charles' brother<!---should this be Pepin's brother?- Apparently not; Pepin's brother only left the monastery (Monte Cassino), to plead that Pepin NOT provide aid to Stephen II, and was then imprisoned.

He did this by again anointing and confirming Pepin, this time adding his young sons Carolus (Charlemagne) and Carloman to the royal patrimony. They thereby became heirs to the realm that already covered most of western Europe.

Plan of This Work}}}}\n\n===Ambiguous high office===\n{{further|Mayor of the Palace}}\n\nThe most powerful officers of the Frankish people, the Mayor of the Palace (''Maior Domus'') and one or more kings (''rex'', ''reges''), were appointed by the election of the people. Elections were not periodic, but were held as required to elect officers ''ad quos summa imperii pertinebat'', \"to whom the highest matters of state pertained\". Evidently, interim decisions could be made by the Pope, which ultimately needed to be ratified using an assembly of the people that met annually.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=1. The Merovingian Family}}\n\nBefore he was elected king in 750, Pepin was initially a mayor, a high office he held \"as though hereditary\" (''velut hereditario fungebatur''). Einhard explains that \"the honour\" was usually \"given by the people\" to the distinguished, but Pepin the Great and his brother Carloman the Wise received it as though hereditary, as had their father, [[Charles Martel]]. There was, however, a certain ambiguity about quasi-inheritance. The office was treated as joint property: one Mayorship held by two brothers jointly.<ref>The ''Annales'' uses maiores domus, a plural followed by a singular: one house, two chief officers. {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 742}}</ref> Each, however, had his own geographic jurisdiction. When Carloman decided to resign, becoming ultimately a Benedictine at [[Monte Cassino]],{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745, 746}} the question of the disposition of his quasi-share was settled by the pope. He converted the mayorship into a kingship and awarded the joint property to Pepin, who gained the right to pass it on by inheritance.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}}\n\nThis decision was not accepted by all family members. Carloman had consented to the temporary tenancy of his own share, which he intended to pass on to his son, Drogo, when the inheritance should be settled at someone's death. By the Pope's decision, in which Pepin had a hand, Drogo was to be disqualified as an heir in favour of his cousin Charles. He took up arms in opposition to the decision and was joined by [[Grifo]], a half-brother of Pepin and Carloman, who had been given a share by Charles Martel, but was stripped of it and held under loose arrest by his half-brothers after an attempt to seize their shares by military action. Grifo perished in combat in the Battle of [[Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne]] while Drogo was hunted down and taken into custody.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nOn the death of Pepin, 24 September 768, the kingship passed jointly to his sons, \"with divine assent\" (''divino nutu'').{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=3. Charlemagne's Accession}} According to the ''Life'', Pepin died in Paris. The Franks \"in general assembly\" (''generali conventu'') gave them both the rank of a king (''reges'') but \"partitioned the whole body of the kingdom equally\" (''totum regni corpus ex aequo partirentur''). The ''annals''{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 768}} tell a slightly different version, with the king dying at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St-Denis]], near Paris. The two \"lords\" (''domni'') were \"elevated to kingship\" (''elevati sunt in regnum''), Charles on 9 October in [[Noyon]], Carloman on an unspecified date in [[Soissons]]. If born in 742, Charles was 26 years old, but he had been campaigning at his father's right hand for several years, which may help to account for his military skill. [[Carloman I|Carloman]] was 17.\n\nThe language, in either case, suggests that there were not two inheritances, which would have created distinct kings ruling over distinct kingdoms, but a single joint inheritance and a joint kingship tenanted by two equal kings, Charles and his brother Carloman. As before, distinct jurisdictions were awarded. Charles received Pepin's original share as Mayor: the outer parts of the kingdom bordering on the sea, namely [[Neustria]], western [[Aquitaine]], and the northern parts of [[Austrasia]]; while Carloman was awarded his uncle's former share, the inner parts: southern Austrasia, [[Septimania]], eastern Aquitaine, [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Provence, and [[Swabia]], lands bordering [[Italy]]. The question of whether these jurisdictions were joint shares reverting to the other brother if one brother died or were inherited property passed on to the descendants of the brother who died was never definitely settled. It came up repeatedly over the succeeding decades until the grandsons of Charlemagne created distinct sovereign kingdoms.\n\n===Aquitainian rebellion===\n====Formation of a new Aquitaine====\n{{main|Aquitaine}}\n\nAquitaine under Rome had been in southern [[Gaul]], Romanised and speaking a [[Romance language]]. Similarly, [[Hispania]] had been populated by peoples who spoke various languages, including [[Celtic language|Celtic]], but the area was now populated primarily by Romance language speakers. Between Aquitaine and Hispania were the [[Basques|Euskaldunak]], Latinised to [[Vascones]], or [[Basques]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=32}} living in Basque country, Vasconia, which extended, according to the distributions of place names attributable to the Basques, most densely in the western [[Pyrenees]] but also as far south as the upper [[Ebro River]] in Spain and as far north as the [[Garonne River]] in France.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=105}} The French name, [[Gascony]], derives from [[Vasconia]]. The Romans were never able to entirely subject Vasconia. The parts they did, in which they placed the region's first cities, were sources of legions in the Roman army valued for their fighting abilities. The border with Aquitaine was [[Toulouse]].\n\nAt about 660, the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] united with the [[Duke of Aquitaine|Duchy of Aquitaine]] to form a single realm under [[Felix of Aquitaine]], governing from Toulouse. This was a joint kingship with a Basque Duke, [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus I]]. ''Lupus'' is the Latin translation of Basque Otsoa, \"wolf\".{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|pp=36\u201337}} At Felix's death in 670 the joint property of the kingship reverted entirely to Lupus. As the Basques had no law of joint inheritance but practised [[primogeniture]], Lupus in effect founded a hereditary dynasty of Basque rulers of an expanded Aquitaine.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=100}}\n\n====Acquisition of Aquitaine by the Carolingians====\n{{further|Umayyad conquest of Hispania}}\n[[File:Al-Andalus732.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Moorish Hispania in 732]]\n\nThe Latin chronicles of the end of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] omit many details, such as identification of characters, filling in the gaps and reconciliation of numerous contradictions.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2004|pp=130\u2013131}}, \"The sequence of events...has not been assisted by the tendency of the historians to take all the information...from all the available sources and combine it to produce a single synthetic account...As a rule of thumb, reliability, and also brevity of narrative, are usually in direct proportion to chronological proximity.\"</ref> Muslim sources, however, present a more coherent view, such as in the ''Ta'rikh iftitah al-Andalus'' (\"History of the Conquest of al-Andalus\") by [[Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya]] (\"the son of the Gothic woman\", referring to the granddaughter of [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania, who married a Moor). Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya, who had another, much longer name, must have been relying to some degree on family oral tradition.\n\nAccording to Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya{{sfn|James|2009|p=49}} [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania died before his three sons, Almund, Romulo, and Ardabast reached maturity. Their mother was regent at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], but [[Roderic]], army chief of staff, staged a rebellion, capturing [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He chose to impose a joint rule over distinct jurisdictions on the true heirs. Evidence of a division of some sort can be found in the distribution of coins imprinted with the name of each king and in the king lists.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=131\u2013132}} Wittiza was succeeded by Roderic, who reigned for seven and a half years, followed by Achila (Aquila), who reigned three and a half years. If the reigns of both terminated with the incursion of the [[Saracens]], then Roderic appears to have reigned a few years before the majority of Achila. The latter's kingdom is securely placed to the northeast, while Roderic seems to have taken the rest, notably modern [[Portugal]].\n\nThe Saracens crossed the mountains to claim Ardo's [[Septimania]], only to encounter the Basque dynasty of Aquitaine, always the allies of the Goths. [[Odo the Great]] of [[Aquitaine]] was at first victorious at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] in 721.{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|p=40}} Saracen troops gradually massed in Septimania and in 732 an army under Emir [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]] advanced into Vasconia, and Odo was defeated at the [[Battle of the River Garonne]]. They took [[Bordeaux]] and were advancing towards [[Tours]] when Odo, powerless to stop them, appealed to his arch-enemy, [[Charles Martel]], mayor of the Franks. In one of the first of the lightning marches for which the Carolingian kings became famous, Charles and his army appeared in the path of the Saracens between Tours and [[Poitiers]], and in the [[Battle of Tours]] decisively defeated and killed al-Ghafiqi. The Moors returned twice more, each time suffering defeat at Charles' hands\u2014at the River Berre near Narbonne in 737{{sfn|Einhard|2007|p=24}} and in the Dauphine in 740.<ref name=\"Lewis2009\">{{cite book|first=David Levering |last=Lewis|title=God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570\u20131215|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=NwA7mQEACAAJ|page=177}}|date=12 January 2009|publisher=W.

However, Odo had ambiguously left the kingdom jointly to his two sons, Hunald and Hatto. The latter, loyal to Francia, now went to war with his brother over full possession. Victorious, Hunald blinded and imprisoned his brother, only to be so stricken by conscience that he resigned and entered the church as a monk to do penance.

Waifer decided to honour it, repeating his father's decision, which he justified by arguing that any agreements with Charles Martel became invalid on Martel's death. Since [[Aquitaine]] was now Pepin's inheritance because of the earlier assistance that was given by Charles Martel, according to some the latter and his son, the young Charles, hunted down Waifer, who could only conduct a guerrilla war, and executed him.{{sfn|Russell|1930|p=88}}\n\nAmong the contingents of the Frankish army were [[Bavaria]]ns under [[Tassilo&nbsp;III, Duke of Bavaria]], an [[Agilofing]], the hereditary Bavarian ducal family. [[Grifo]] had installed himself as Duke of Bavaria, but Pepin replaced him with a member of the ducal family yet a child, Tassilo, whose protector he had become after the death of his father. The loyalty of the Agilolfings was perpetually in question, but Pepin exacted numerous oaths of loyalty from Tassilo. However, the latter had married [[Liutperga]], a daughter of [[Desiderius]], king of [[Lombardy]]. At a critical point in the campaign, Tassilo left the field with all his Bavarians. Out of reach of Pepin, he repudiated all loyalty to Francia.{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|pp=118\u2013125}} Pepin had no chance to respond as he grew ill and died within a few weeks after Waifer's execution.\n\nThe first event of the brothers' reign was the uprising of the Aquitainians and [[Gascony|Gascons]], in 769, in that territory split between the two kings. One year earlier, Pepin had finally defeated [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], after waging a destructive, ten-year war against Aquitaine. Now, [[Hunald II]] led the Aquitainians as far north as [[Angoul\u00eame]]. Charles met Carloman, but Carloman refused to participate and returned to Burgundy. Charles went to war, leading an army to [[Bordeaux]], where he set up a fort at Fronsac. Hunald was forced to flee to the court of Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupus&nbsp;II of Gascony]]. Lupus, fearing Charles, turned Hunald over in exchange for peace, and was put in a monastery. Gascon lords also surrendered, and Aquitaine and [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]] were finally fully subdued by the Franks.\n\n===Perforce union===\nThe brothers maintained lukewarm relations with the assistance of their mother Bertrada, but in 770 Charles signed a treaty with Duke [[Tassilo III of Bavaria]] and married a Lombard Princess (commonly known today as [[Desiderata, wife of Charlemagne|Desiderata]]), the daughter of King [[Desiderius]], to surround Carloman with his own allies. Though [[Pope Stephen III]] first opposed the marriage with the Lombard princess, he found little to fear from a Frankish-Lombard alliance.\n\nLess than a year after his marriage, Charlemagne repudiated Desiderata and married a 13-year-old Swabian named [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]]. The repudiated Desiderata returned to her father's court at [[Pavia]]. Her father's wrath was now aroused, and he would have gladly allied with Carloman to defeat Charles. Before any open hostilities could be declared, however, Carloman died on 5 December 771, apparently of natural causes.

There he confirmed his father's grants of land,<ref name=Campaigns>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106546/Charlemagne/256620/Military-campaigns Charlemagne], Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref> with some later chronicles falsely claiming that he also expanded them, granting [[Tuscany]], [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], Venice and [[Corsica]]. The pope granted him the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]''. He then returned to Pavia, where the Lombards were on the verge of surrendering. In return for their lives, the Lombards surrendered and opened the gates in early summer. Desiderius was sent to the [[abbey]] of [[Corbie]], and his son Adelchis died in [[Constantinople]], a patrician. Charles, unusually, had himself crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] and made the magnates of Lombardy pay homage to him at Pavia. Only Duke [[Arechis II of Benevento]] refused to submit and proclaimed independence. Charlemagne was then master of Italy as king of the Lombards. He left Italy with a garrison in Pavia and a few Frankish counts in place the same year.\n\nInstability continued in Italy. In 776, Dukes [[Hrodgaud of Friuli]] and [[Hildeprand of Spoleto]] rebelled. Charlemagne rushed back from [[Saxony]] and defeated the Duke of Friuli in battle; the Duke was slain.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}} The Duke of Spoleto signed a treaty. Their co-conspirator, Arechis, was not subdued, and Adelchis, their candidate in [[Byzantium]], never left that city. Northern Italy was now faithfully his.\n\n===Southern Italy===\nIn 787, Charlemagne directed his attention towards the [[Duchy of Benevento]],{{sfn|Hodgkin|1889}} where [[Arechis II of Benevento|Arechis II]] was reigning independently with the self-given title of [[Princeps]]. Charlemagne's siege of [[Salerno]] forced Arechis into submission. However, after Arecchis II's death in 787, his son [[Grimoald III of Benevento|Grimoald III]] proclaimed the Duchy of Benevento newly independent. Grimoald was attacked many times by Charles' or his sons' armies, without achieving a definitive victory.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1889|pp=85\u20136}} Charlemagne lost interest and never again returned to [[Southern Italy]] where Grimoald was able to keep the Duchy free from Frankish [[suzerainty]].\n\n==Children==\n[[File:Karl der Grosse - Pippin der Bucklige.jpg|thumb|Charlemagne (left) and his eldest son, [[Pepin the Hunchback]]. Tenth-century copy of a lost original from about 830.]]\n\nDuring the first peace of any substantial length (780\u2013782), Charles began to appoint his sons to positions of authority. In 781, he made his two youngest sons kings, crowned by the Pope. The elder of these two, [[Pippin of Italy|Carloman]], was made the [[King of Italy]], taking the Iron Crown that his father had first worn in 774, and in the same ceremony was renamed \"Pepin\".{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}}<ref name=Campaigns /> The younger of the two, [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], became [[king of Aquitaine]]. Charlemagne ordered Pepin and Louis to be raised in the customs of their kingdoms, and he gave their regents some control of their subkingdoms, but kept the real power, though he intended his sons to inherit their realms. He did not tolerate insubordination in his sons: in 792, he banished his eldest, though possibly illegitimate, son, [[Pippin the Hunchback]], to the monastery of Pr\u00fcm, because the young man had joined a rebellion against him.\n\nCharles was determined to have his children educated, including his daughters, as his parents had instilled the importance of learning in him at an early age.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hbnY8GTet_kC}}|title=Charlemagne |last=Gelfand|first=Dale Evva|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438117850|language=en}}</ref> His children were also taught skills in accord with their aristocratic status, which included training in riding and weaponry for his sons, and embroidery, spinning and weaving for his daughters.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=bQlJP9O9hKkC}}|title=Daily Life in the Age of Charlemagne|last=Butt|first=John J.|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313316685|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Charlemagne et Louis le Pieux.jpg|left|thumb|Charlemagne instructing his son [[Louis the Pious]]]]\n\nThe sons fought many wars on behalf of their father. [[Charles the Younger|Charles]] was mostly preoccupied with the Bretons, whose border he shared and who insurrected on at least two occasions and were easily put down. He also fought the Saxons on multiple occasions. In 805 and 806, he was sent into the B\u00f6hmerwald (modern [[Bohemia]]) to deal with the Slavs living there (Bohemian tribes, ancestors of the modern [[Czech people|Czechs]]). He subjected them to Frankish authority and devastated the valley of the Elbe, forcing tribute from them. Pippin had to hold the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] and Beneventan borders and fought the [[Slavs]] to his north. He was uniquely poised to fight the [[Byzantine Empire]] when that conflict arose after Charlemagne's imperial coronation and a [[Venetia (region)|Venetian]] rebellion. Finally, Louis was in charge of the [[Spanish March]] and fought the Duke of Benevento in southern Italy on at least one occasion. He took [[Barcelona]] in a great siege in 797.\n\nCharlemagne's attitude towards his daughters has been the subject of much discussion. He kept them at home with him and refused to allow them to contract [[marriage#Marriage and religion|sacramental marriages]] (though he originally condoned an engagement between his eldest daughter Rotrude and [[Constantine VI]] of Byzantium, this engagement was annulled when Rotrude was 11).<ref>Runciman, Steven. \"The Empress Irene the Athenian.\" Medieval Women. Ed. Derek Baker. Oxford: Ecclesiastical History Society, 1978.</ref> Charlemagne's opposition to his daughters' marriages may possibly have intended to prevent the creation of [[cadet branch]]es of the family to challenge the main line, as had been the case with [[Tassilo III of Bavaria|Tassilo of Bavaria]]. However, he tolerated their extramarital relationships, even rewarding their common-law husbands and treasuring the illegitimate grandchildren they produced for him. He also, apparently, refused to believe stories of their wild behaviour. After his death the surviving daughters were banished from the court by their brother, the pious Louis, to take up residence in the convents they had been bequeathed by their father. At least one of them, Bertha, had a recognised relationship, if not a marriage, with [[Angilbert]], a member of Charlemagne's court circle.{{sfn|Becher|2005|p=122}}{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|p=91}}\n\n==Carolingian expansion to the south==\n{{See also|Abbasid\u2013Carolingian alliance}}\n===Vasconia and the Pyrenees===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}\nThe destructive war led by Pepin in Aquitaine, although brought to a satisfactory conclusion for the Franks, proved the Frankish power structure south of the [[Loire]] was feeble and unreliable. After the defeat and death of [[Waiofar]] in 768, while Aquitaine submitted again to the Carolingian dynasty, a new rebellion broke out in 769 led by Hunald II, a possible son of Waifer. He took refuge with the ally Duke [[Lupus II of Gascony]], but probably out of fear of Charlemagne's reprisal, Lupus handed him over to the new King of the Franks to whom he pledged loyalty, which seemed to confirm the peace in [[Duchy of Vasconia|the Basque area]] south of the [[Garonne]].<ref name=Lewis>Lewis, Archibald Ross. ''The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society 718-1050'', University of Texas Press, 1965</ref>\n\nWary of new Basque uprisings, Charlemagne seems to have tried to contain Duke Lupus's power by appointing [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin]] as the Count of Bordeaux (778) and other counts of Frankish background in bordering areas ([[History of Toulouse#768\u2013877: Carolingian Franks and the Kingdom of Aquitaine|Toulouse]], [[County of F\u00e9zensac]]). The [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basque]] Duke, in turn, seems to have contributed decisively or schemed the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (referred to as \"Basque treachery\"). The defeat of Charlemagne's army in Roncevaux (778) confirmed his determination to rule directly by establishing the Kingdom of Aquitaine (ruled by [[Louis the Pious]]) based on a power base of Frankish officials, distributing lands among colonisers and allocating lands to the Church, which he took as an ally. A Christianisation programme was put in place across the high [[Pyrenees]] (778).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\nThe new political arrangement for Vasconia did not sit well with local lords. As of 788 [[Adalric of Gascony|Adalric]] was fighting and capturing [[Torson of Toulouse|Chorson]], Carolingian Count of Toulouse. He was eventually released, but Charlemagne, enraged at the compromise, decided to depose him and appointed his trustee [[William of Gellone]]. William, in turn, fought the Basques and defeated them after banishing Adalric (790).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\nFrom 781 ([[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[County of Ribagorza|Ribagor\u00e7a]]) to 806 ([[Pamplona#Early Middle Ages|Pamplona]] under Frankish influence), taking the County of Toulouse for a power base, Charlemagne asserted Frankish authority over the Pyrenees by subduing the south-western marches of Toulouse (790) and establishing vassal counties on the southern Pyrenees that were to make up the [[Marca Hispanica]].{{sfn|Lewis, Archibald Ross (1965), p. 40}} As of 794, a Frankish vassal, the Basque lord Belasko (''al-Galashki'', 'the Gaul') ruled [[\u00c1lava]], but Pamplona remained under Cordovan and local control up to 806. Belasko and the counties in the Marca Hisp\u00e1nica provided the necessary base to attack the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] (an expedition led by [[William of Gellone|William Count of Toulouse]] and Louis the Pious to capture Barcelona in 801). Events in the Duchy of Vasconia (rebellion in Pamplona, [[Aznar Gal\u00edndez I|count overthrown in Aragon]], Duke Seguin of Bordeaux deposed, uprising of the Basque lords, etc.) were to prove it ephemeral upon Charlemagne's death.\n\n===Roncesvalles campaign===\nAccording to the Muslim historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], the Diet of Paderborn had received the representatives of the Muslim rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Huesca]]. Their masters had been cornered in the [[Iberian peninsula]] by [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], the [[Umayyad]] [[emir of C\u00f3rdoba|emir of Cordova]]. These \"Saracen\" ([[Moorish]] and [[Muladi]]) rulers offered their homage to the king of the Franks in return for military support. Seeing an opportunity to extend [[Christendom]] and his own power and believing the Saxons to be a fully conquered nation, Charlemagne agreed to go to Spain.\n\nIn 778, he led the Neustrian army across the Western [[Pyrenees]], while the Austrasians, Lombards, and Burgundians passed over the Eastern Pyrenees. The armies met at Saragossa and Charlemagne received the homage of the Muslim rulers, Sulayman al-Arabi and Kasmin ibn Yusuf, but the city did not fall for him. Indeed, Charlemagne faced the toughest battle of his career. The Muslims forced him to retreat. He decided to go home since he could not trust the [[Basques]], whom he had subdued by conquering [[Pamplona]]. He turned to leave Iberia, but as he was passing through the Pass of [[Roncesvalles]] one of the most famous events of his reign occurred. The Basques attacked and destroyed his rearguard and baggage train. The [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]], though less a battle than a skirmish, left many famous dead, including the [[seneschal]] Eggihard, the count of the palace Anselm, and the [[wikt:warden|warden]] of the [[Breton March]], [[Roland]], inspiring the subsequent creation of the [[Song of Roland]] (''La Chanson de Roland'').\n\n===Contact with the Saracens===\n[[File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Harun al-Rashid]] receiving a delegation of Charlemagne in [[Baghdad]], by [[Julius K\u00f6ckert]] (1864)]]\n\nThe conquest of Italy brought Charlemagne in contact with the [[Saracen]]s who, at the time, controlled the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Charlemagne's eldest son, [[Pepin the Hunchback]], was much occupied with Saracens in Italy. Charlemagne conquered [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] at an unknown date and in 799 the [[Balearic Islands]]. The islands were often attacked by Saracen pirates, but the counts of [[Genoa]] and Tuscany ([[Boniface I of Tuscany|Boniface]]) controlled them with large fleets until the end of Charlemagne's reign. Charlemagne even had contact with the [[caliph]]al court in [[Baghdad]]. In 797 (or possibly 801), the caliph of Baghdad, [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented Charlemagne with an [[Asian elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] and a [[clock]].<ref name=\"Heck2007\">{{cite book|first=Gene W. |last=Heck|title=When Worlds Collide: Exploring the Ideological and Political Foundations of the Clash of Civilizations|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=dtAyMXqaozwC|page=172}}|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-5856-4|pages=172\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Wars with the Moors===\n\nIn [[Hispania]], the struggle against the Moors continued unabated throughout the latter half of his reign. Louis was in charge of the Spanish border. In 785, his men captured Girona permanently and extended Frankish control into the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] littoral for the duration of Charlemagne's reign (the area remained nominally Frankish until the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]] in 1258). The Muslim chiefs in the northeast of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] were constantly rebelling against Cordovan authority, and they often turned to the Franks for help. The Frankish border was slowly extended until 795, when Girona, [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], [[Ausona]] and [[County of Urgell|Urgell]] were united into the new [[Spanish March]], within the old duchy of [[Septimania]].\n\nIn 797, [[Barcelona]], the greatest city of the region, fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against Cordova and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis of Aquitaine marched the entire army of his kingdom over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. The Franks continued to press forward against the [[emir]]. They took [[Tarragona]] in 809 and [[Tortosa]] in 811. The last conquest brought them to the mouth of the [[Ebro]] and gave them raiding access to [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], prompting the Emir [[al-Hakam I]] to recognise their conquests in 813.\n\n==Eastern campaigns==\n\n===Saxon Wars===\n{{Further|Saxon Wars}}\n[[File:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|A map showing Charlemagne's additions (in light green) to the Frankish Kingdom]]\n\nCharlemagne was engaged in almost constant warfare throughout his reign,<ref>France, John, \"The Composition and Raising of the Armies of Charlemagne\", in Journal of Medieval Military History, ed. B. Bachrach (2002), pp. 63\u20135</ref> often at the head of his elite ''[[scara]]'' bodyguard squadrons. In the [[Saxon Wars]], spanning thirty years and eighteen battles, he conquered [[Old Saxony|Saxonia]] and proceeded to convert it to Christianity.\n\nThe [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Saxons]] were divided into four subgroups in four regions. Nearest to [[Austrasia]] was [[Westphalia]] and furthest away was [[Eastphalia]]. Between them was [[Engria]] and north of these three, at the base of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, was [[Nordalbingia]].\n\nIn his first campaign, in 773, Charlemagne forced the Engrians to submit and cut down an [[Irminsul]] pillar near [[Paderborn]].<ref>Revised annals of the kingdom of the Franks, ed. and trans. King, Sources, p. 110</ref> The campaign was cut short by his first expedition to Italy. He returned in 775, marching through Westphalia and conquering the Saxon fort at [[Sigiburg]]. He then crossed Engria, where he defeated the Saxons again. Finally, in Eastphalia, he defeated a Saxon force, and its leader [[Hessi]] converted to Christianity. Charlemagne returned through Westphalia, leaving encampments at Sigiburg and [[Eresburg]], which had been important Saxon bastions. He then controlled Saxony with the exception of Nordalbingia, but Saxon resistance had not ended.\n\nFollowing his subjugation of the Dukes of Friuli and Spoleto, Charlemagne returned rapidly to Saxony in 776, where a rebellion had destroyed his fortress at Eresburg. The Saxons were once again defeated, but their main leader, [[Widukind]], escaped to Denmark, his wife's home. Charlemagne built a new camp at [[Karlstadt am Main|Karlstadt]]. In 777, he called a national diet at Paderborn to integrate Saxony fully into the Frankish kingdom. Many Saxons were baptised as Christians.\n\nIn the summer of 779, he again invaded Saxony and reconquered Eastphalia, Engria and Westphalia. At a diet near [[Lippe]], he divided the land into missionary districts and himself assisted in several mass baptisms (780). He then returned to Italy and, for the first time, the Saxons did not immediately revolt. Saxony was peaceful from 780 to 782.\n\n[[File:Ary Scheffer, Charlemagne re\u00e7oit la soumission de Widukind \u00e0 Paderborn, (1840).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Charlemagne (742\u2013814) receiving the submission of [[Widukind]] at [[Paderborn]] in 785, by [[Ary Scheffer]] (1795\u20131858), [[Palace of Versailles]]]]\n\nHe returned to Saxony in 782 and instituted a code of law and appointed counts, both Saxon and Frank. The laws were [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] on religious issues; for example, the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'' prescribed death to Saxon pagans who refused to convert to Christianity. This led to renewed conflict. That year, in autumn, Widukind returned and led a new revolt. In response, at [[Verden, Germany|Verden]] in Lower Saxony, Charlemagne is recorded as having ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners, known as the [[Massacre of Verden]] (\"Verdener Blutgericht\"). The killings triggered three years of renewed bloody warfare (783\u2013785). During this war, the [[Frisians]] were finally subdued and a large part of their fleet was burned. The war ended with [[Widukind]] accepting baptism.\n\nThereafter, the Saxons maintained the peace for seven years, but in 792 Westphalia again rebelled. The Eastphalians and Nordalbingians joined them in 793, but the insurrection was unpopular and was put down by 794. An Engrian rebellion followed in 796, but the presence of Charlemagne, Christian Saxons and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] quickly crushed it. The last insurrection occurred in 804, more than thirty years after Charlemagne's first campaign against them, but also failed. According to Einhard:\n<blockquote>\nThe war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to the terms offered by the King; which were renunciation of their national religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one people.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Submission of Bavaria===\n[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|Statue of Charlemagne by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Vatican, Italy]]\n\nBy 774, Charlemagne had invaded the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Kingdom of Lombardy]], and he later annexed the Lombardian territories and assumed its crown, placing the [[Papal States]] under Frankish protection.<ref name=\"autogenerated30\">Historical Atlas of Knights and Castles, Cartographica, Dr Ian Barnes, 2007 pp.30&31</ref> The [[Duchy of Spoleto]] south of Rome was acquired in 774, while in the central western parts of Europe, the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was absorbed and the Bavarian policy continued of establishing tributary [[marches]], (borders protected in return for tribute or taxes) among the [[Slavs|Slavic]] Serbs and Czechs. The remaining power confronting the Franks in the east were the [[Avar people (Caucasus)|Avars]]. However, Charlemagne acquired other Slavic areas, including [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Austria]] and [[Croatia]].<ref name=\"autogenerated30\"/>\n\nIn 789, Charlemagne turned to [[Bavaria]].

Charlemagne was preoccupied with other matters until 790 when he marched down the [[Danube]] and ravaged Avar territory to the [[Gy\u0151r]]. A Lombard army under Pippin then marched into the [[Drava]] valley and ravaged [[Pannonia]]. The campaigns ended when the Saxons revolted again in 792.\n\nFor the next two years, Charlemagne was occupied, along with the Slavs, against the Saxons. Pippin and Duke [[Eric of Friuli]] continued, however, to assault the Avars' ring-shaped strongholds. The great Ring of the Avars, their capital fortress, was taken twice. The booty was sent to Charlemagne at his capital, [[Aachen]], and redistributed to his followers and to foreign rulers, including King [[Offa of Mercia]]. Soon the Avar [[tudun]]s had lost the will to fight and travelled to Aachen to become vassals to Charlemagne and to become Christians. Charlemagne accepted their surrender and sent one native chief, baptised Abraham, back to Avaria with the ancient title of [[khagan]]. Abraham kept his people in line, but in 800, the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] under [[Krum|Khan Krum]] attacked the remains of the Avar state.\n\nIn 803, Charlemagne sent a Bavarian army into [[Pannonia]], defeating and bringing an end to the [[Avar Khaganate|Avar confederation]].<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite book|first1=Bernard S. |last1=Bachrach|author2=Clifford J.

The Slavs ultimately submitted, led by their leader Witzin. Charlemagne then accepted the surrender of the [[Veleti]] under Dragovit and demanded many hostages. He also demanded permission to send missionaries into this pagan region unmolested. The army marched to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] before turning around and marching to the Rhine, winning much booty with no harassment. The tributary Slavs became loyal allies. In 795, when the Saxons broke the peace, the Abotrites and Veleti rebelled with their new ruler against the Saxons. Witzin died in battle and Charlemagne avenged him by harrying the Eastphalians on the Elbe. Thrasuco, his successor, led his men to conquest over the Nordalbingians and handed their leaders over to Charlemagne, who honoured him. The Abotrites remained loyal until Charles' death and fought later against the Danes.\n\n===Southeast Slav expeditions===\n[[File:Europe around 800.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|Europe around 800]]\n\nWhen Charlemagne incorporated much of Central Europe, he brought the Frankish state face to face with the Avars and Slavs in the southeast.<ref name=\"Bruce Ross\">{{cite book | last=Bruce Ross | first=James | pages=212\u2013235 | jstor=2854596 | title=Two Neglected Paladins of Charlemagne: Erich of Friuli and Gerold of Bavaria Speculum, Vol. 20, No. 2 | publisher=Medieval Academy of America |date = April 1945| isbn=}}</ref> The most southeast Frankish neighbours were [[Croats]], who settled in [[Duchy of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]] and [[Dalmatian Croatia]].

At [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], on Christmas Day (25 December), when Charlemagne knelt at the altar to pray, the Pope [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] him ''Imperator Romanorum'' (\"Emperor of the Romans\") in [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]]. In so doing, the Pope effectively nullified the legitimacy of [[Empress Irene]] of [[Constantinople]]:<blockquote>When [[Odoacer]] compelled the abdication of [[Romulus Augustulus]], he did not abolish the Western Empire as a separate power, but cause it to be reunited with or sink into the Eastern, so that from that time there was a single undivided Roman Empire&nbsp;... [Pope Leo III and Charlemagne], like their predecessors, held the Roman Empire to be one and indivisible, and proposed by the coronation of [Charlemagne] not to proclaim a severance of the East and West&nbsp;... they were not revolting against a reigning sovereign, but legitimately filling up the place of the deposed [[Constantine VI]]&nbsp;...

For centuries to come, the Emperors of both West and East would make competing claims of sovereignty over the whole.\n\nEinhard says that Charlemagne was ignorant of the Pope's intent and did not want any such coronation:\n<blockquote>[H]e at first had such an aversion that he declared that he would not have set foot in the Church the day that they [the imperial titles] were conferred, although it was a great feast-day, if he could have foreseen the design of the Pope.<ref>Einhard ''Life of Charlemagne'' 28.</ref></blockquote>\n\nA number of modern scholars, however,<ref>Tierney, Brian. ''The Crisis of the Church and State 1050\u20131300''.

Einhard, ''Vita Karoli Magni'',&nbsp;28.</ref> but that debate obscured the more significant question of ''why'' the Pope granted the title and why Charlemagne accepted it.\n\n[[Roger Collins|Collins]] points out \"[t]hat the motivation behind the acceptance of the imperial title was a romantic and antiquarian interest in reviving the Roman empire is highly unlikely.\"{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=147}} For one thing, such romance would not have appealed either to Franks or Roman Catholics at the turn of the ninth century, both of whom viewed the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] heritage of the Roman Empire with distrust. The Franks took pride in having \"fought against and thrown from their shoulders the heavy yoke of the Romans\" and \"from the knowledge gained in baptism, clothed in gold and precious stones the bodies of the holy martyrs whom the Romans had killed by fire, by the sword and by wild animals\", as [[Pepin the Short|Pippin&nbsp;III]] described it in a law of 763 or 764.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}}\n\nFurthermore, the new title\u2014carrying with it the risk that the new emperor would \"make drastic changes to the traditional styles and procedures of government\" or \"concentrate his attentions on Italy or on Mediterranean concerns more generally\"\u2014risked alienating the Frankish leadership.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=149}}\n\nFor both the Pope and Charlemagne, the Roman Empire remained a significant power in European politics at this time. The [[Byzantine Empire]], based in [[Constantinople]], continued to hold a substantial portion of Italy, with borders not far south of Rome. Charles' sitting in judgment of the Pope could be seen as usurping the prerogatives of the Emperor in Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|By whom, however, could he [the Pope] be tried? Who, in other words, was qualified to pass judgement on the Vicar of Christ? In normal circumstances the only conceivable answer to that question would have been the Emperor at Constantinople; but the imperial throne was at this moment occupied by [[Irene of Athens|Irene]]. That the Empress was notorious for having blinded and murdered her own son was, in the minds of both Leo and Charles, almost immaterial: it was enough that she was a woman. The female sex was known to be incapable of governing, and by the old Salic tradition was debarred from doing so. As far as Western Europe was concerned, the Throne of the Emperors was vacant: Irene's claim to it was merely an additional proof, if any were needed, of the degradation into which the so-called Roman Empire had fallen.|[[John Julius Norwich]]{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=378}}|}}\n\nFor the Pope, then, there was \"no living Emperor at that time\"{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=379}} though [[Henri Pirenne]]{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=234n}} disputes this saying that the coronation \"was not in any sense explained by the fact that at this moment a woman was reigning in Constantinople\". Nonetheless, the Pope took the extraordinary step of creating one. The papacy had since 727 been in conflict with Irene's predecessors in Constantinople over a number of issues, chiefly the continued Byzantine adherence to the doctrine of [[iconoclasm]], the destruction of Christian images; while from 750, the secular power of the Byzantine Empire in central Italy had been nullified.\n\n[[File:Couronnement d'un prince - Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve Lat1141 f2v.jpg|thumb|left|Coronation of an idealised king, depicted in the Sacramentary of [[Charles the Bald]] (about 870)]]\n\nBy bestowing the Imperial crown upon Charlemagne, the Pope arrogated to himself \"the right to appoint&nbsp;... the Emperor of the Romans,&nbsp;... establishing the imperial crown as his own personal gift but simultaneously granting himself implicit superiority over the Emperor whom he had created.\" And \"because the Byzantines had proved so unsatisfactory from every point of view\u2014political, military and doctrinal\u2014he would select a westerner: the one man who by his wisdom and statesmanship and the vastness of his dominions&nbsp;... stood out head and shoulders above his contemporaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Popes: A History|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=978-0701182908|location=|pages=55}}</ref>\n\nWith Charlemagne's coronation, therefore, \"the Roman Empire remained, so far as either of them [Charlemagne and Leo] were concerned, one and indivisible, with Charles as its Emperor\", though there can have been \"little doubt that the coronation, with all that it implied, would be furiously contested in Constantinople\".{{sfn|Norwich|1992a|p=3}}\n\n[[Alcuin]] writes hopefully in his letters of an ''Imperium Christianum'' (\"Christian Empire\"), wherein, \"just as the inhabitants of the [Roman Empire] had been united by a common Roman citizenship\", presumably this new empire would be united by a common Christian faith.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}} This writes the view of Pirenne when he says \"Charles was the Emperor of the ''ecclesia'' as the Pope conceived it, of the Roman Church, regarded as the universal Church\".{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=233}} The ''Imperium Christianum'' was further supported at a number of [[synod]]s all across Europe by Paulinus of Aquileia.<ref name=\"Butler1995\">{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XIEAD2MC1YkC|page=74}} |title=Butler's Lives of the Saints: New Full Edition |first=Alban |last=Butler |first2=David |last2=Hugh Farmer |chapter=St Paulinus of Aquileia, Bishop (c. 726\u2013804) |pages=74\u201375 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-86012-250-0}}</ref>\n\nWhat is known, from the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p= 153}} is that Charlemagne's reaction to his coronation was to take the initial steps towards securing the Constantinopolitan throne by sending envoys of marriage to Irene, and that Irene reacted somewhat favourably to them.\n\n[[File:Raphael Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''[[The Coronation of Charlemagne]]'', by assistants of [[Raphael]], circa 1516\u20131517]]\nIt is important to distinguish between the universalist and localist conceptions of the empire, which remain controversial among historians. According to the former, the empire was a universal monarchy, a \"commonwealth of the whole world, whose sublime unity transcended every minor distinction\"; and the emperor \"was entitled to the obedience of Christendom\". According to the latter, the emperor had no ambition for universal dominion; his realm was limited in the same way as that of every other ruler, and when he made more far-reaching claims his object was normally to ward off the attacks either of the Pope or of the Byzantine emperor. According to this view, also, the origin of the empire is to be explained by specific local circumstances rather than by overarching theories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269851/Holy-Roman-Empire |title=Holy Roman Empire |publisher=Britannica.com |date=14 January 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ohnsorge, for a long time, it had been the custom of Byzantium to designate the German princes as spiritual \"sons\" of the Romans. What might have been acceptable in the fifth century had become provoking and insulting to the Franks in the eighth century. Charles came to believe that the Roman emperor, who claimed to head the world hierarchy of states, was, in reality, no greater than Charles himself, a king as other kings, since beginning in 629 he had entitled himself \"Basileus\" (translated literally as \"king\"). Ohnsorge finds it significant that the chief wax seal of Charles, which bore only the inscription: \"Christe, protege Carolum regem Francorum [Christ, protect Charles, king of the Franks], was used from 772 to 813, even during the imperial period and was not replaced by a special imperial seal; indicating that Charles felt himself to be just the king of the Franks. Finally, Ohnsorge points out that in the spring of 813 at Aachen Charles crowned his only surviving son, Louis, as the emperor without recourse to Rome with only the acclamation of his Franks. The form in which this acclamation was offered was Frankish-Christian rather than Roman. This implies both independence from Rome and a Frankish (non-Roman) understanding of empire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clc-library-org-docs.angelfire.com/charlemagne.html |title=Ohnsorge, Werner, ''Das Zweikaiserproblem im fr\u00fcheren Mittelalter.

''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', Diplomata Karolinorum I, 77ff.; title used from 801 onward.</ref> (\"Charles, most serene Augustus crowned by God, the great, peaceful emperor ruling the Roman empire\") to the more direct ''Imperator Romanorum'' (\"Emperor of the Romans\").\n\nThe title of Emperor remained in the Carolingian family for years to come, but divisions of territory and in-fighting over supremacy of the Frankish state weakened its significance.{{sfn|Cantor|2015|pp=194\u20135, 212}} The papacy itself never forgot the title nor abandoned the right to bestow it. When the family of Charles ceased to produce worthy heirs, the Pope gladly crowned whichever Italian magnate could best protect him from his local enemies. The empire would remain in continuous existence for nearly a millennium, as the Holy Roman Empire, a true imperial successor to Charles.{{sfn|Davies1996|pp=316\u2013317}}\n\n===Imperial diplomacy===\n[[File:Europe in 814, Charlemagne, Krum, Nicephorus I.png|right|thumb|upright=1.35|Europe around 814]]\n\nThe [[iconoclasm (Byzantine)|iconoclasm of the Byzantine]] [[Leo III the Isaurian|Isaurian Dynasty]] was endorsed by the Franks.<ref name=Becher2011>{{cite journal|title=Die Au\u00dfenpolitik Karls des Gro\u00dfen.

The council was not recognised by Charlemagne since no Frankish emissaries had been invited, even though Charlemagne ruled more than three provinces of the classical Roman empire and was considered equal in rank to the Byzantine emperor. And while the Pope supported the reintroduction of the iconic veneration, he politically digressed from Byzantium.<ref name=Becher2011/> He certainly desired to increase the influence of the papacy, to honour his saviour Charlemagne, and to solve the constitutional issues then most troubling to European jurists in an era when Rome was not in the hands of an emperor. Thus, Charlemagne's assumption of the imperial title was not a usurpation in the eyes of the Franks or Italians. It was, however, seen as such in Byzantium, where it was protested by Irene and her successor [[Nikephoros&nbsp;I]]\u2014neither of whom had any great effect in enforcing their protests.\n\nThe East Romans, however, still held several territories in Italy: Venice (what was left of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]), [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] (in [[Calabria]]), [[Brindisi]] (in [[Apulia]]), and [[Naples]] (the ''[[Ducatus Neapolitanus]]''). These regions remained outside of Frankish hands until 804, when the Venetians, torn by infighting, transferred their allegiance to the Iron Crown of Pippin, Charles' son. The ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'' ended. Nicephorus ravaged the coasts with a fleet, initiating the only instance of war between the Byzantines and the Franks. The conflict lasted until 810 when the pro-Byzantine party in Venice gave their city back to the Byzantine Emperor, and the two emperors of Europe made peace: Charlemagne received the [[Istria]]n peninsula and in 812 the emperor [[Michael I Rangabe]] recognised his status as Emperor,<ref>''eum imperatorem et basileum appellantes'', cf.

This defence, last employed in the Danish-Prussian War of 1864, was at its beginning a {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} long earthenwork rampart. The Danevirke protected Danish land and gave Godfred the opportunity to harass [[Frisia]] and [[Flanders]] with pirate raids. He also subdued the Frank-allied Veleti and fought the Abotrites.\n\nGodfred invaded Frisia, joked of visiting Aachen, but was murdered before he could do any more, either by a Frankish assassin or by one of his own men. Godfred was succeeded by his nephew [[King Hemming|Hemming]], who concluded the [[Treaty of Heiligen]] with Charlemagne in late 811.\n\n===Death===\n{{See also|Testament of Charlemagne}}\n[[File:Shroud of Charlemagne manufactured in Constantinople 814.jpg|thumb|A portion of the 814 death [[shroud]] of Charlemagne.

Pursuing his father's reforms, Charlemagne abolished the monetary system based on the gold {{lang|fr|[[solidus (coin)|sou]]}}. Instead, he and the [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon King]] [[Offa of Mercia]] took up Pippin's system for pragmatic reasons, notably a shortage of the metal.\n\nThe gold shortage was a direct consequence of the conclusion of peace with Byzantium, which resulted in ceding Venice and Sicily to the East and losing their trade routes to Africa. The resulting standardisation economically harmonised and unified the complex array of currencies that had been in use at the commencement of his reign, thus simplifying trade and commerce.\n\nCharlemagne established a new standard, the {{lang|fr|[[French livre|livre carolinienne]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|libra]]}}, the modern [[pound (currency)|pound]]), which was based upon a pound of silver\u2014a unit of both money and weight\u2014worth 20 sous (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]}} [which was primarily an accounting device and never actually minted], the modern [[shilling]]) or 240 {{lang|fr|[[denier (coin)|deniers]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[denarius]]}}, the modern [[penny]]). During this period, the {{lang|fr|livre}} and the {{lang|fr|sou}} were counting units; only the {{lang|fr|denier}} was a coin of the realm.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne denier Tours 793 to 812.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Denier from the era of Charlemagne, [[Tours]], 793\u2013812]]\n\nCharlemagne instituted principles for [[accountancy|accounting practice]] by means of the [[Capitulare de villis]] of 802, which laid down strict rules for the way in which incomes and expenses were to be recorded.\n\nCharlemagne applied this system to much of the European continent, and Offa's standard was voluntarily adopted by much of England. After Charlemagne's death, continental coinage degraded, and most of Europe resorted to using the continued high-quality English coin until about 1100.\n\n===Jews in Charlemagne's realm===\nEarly in Charlemagne's rule he tacitly allowed Jews to monopolise money lending. Then lending of money for interest was proscribed in 814 because it violated Church law. Charlemagne introduced the ''[[Capitulary for the Jews]]'', a prohibition on Jews engaging in money-lending due to the religious convictions of the majority of his constituents, in essence banning it across the board, a reversal of his earlier recorded general policy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldology.com/Europe/early_dark_ages_3.htm |title=Charlemagne created a peaceful environment for Jews in his kingdom.

His reign is often referred to as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] because of the flowering of scholarship, literature, art and architecture that characterise it. Charlemagne came into contact with the culture and learning of other countries (especially Moorish Spain, Anglo-Saxon England,<ref>''Charlemagne and Anglo-Saxon England'', Joanna Story, ''Charlemagne: Empire and Society'', ed. Joanna Story, (Manchester University Press, 2005), 195.</ref> and Lombard Italy) due to his vast conquests. He greatly increased the provision of monastic schools and scriptoria (centres for book-copying) in Francia.\n\nMost of the surviving works of classical Latin were copied and preserved by Carolingian scholars. Indeed, the earliest manuscripts available for many ancient texts are Carolingian. It is almost certain that a text which survived to the Carolingian age survives still.\n[[File:Privilegio di carlo magno alla chiesa di modena, 782 (facsimile).JPG|thumb|left|The privileges of Charlemagne at the [[Modena Cathedral]] (containing the [[monogram]] of Charlemagne), dated 782]]\n\nThe pan-European nature of Charlemagne's influence is indicated by the origins of many of the men who worked for him: [[Alcuin]], an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] from [[York]]; [[Theodulf]], a [[Visigoths|Visigoth]], probably from [[Septimania]]; [[Paul the Deacon]], Lombard; [[Italians]] [[Peter of Pisa]] and [[Saint Paulinus II|Paulinus of Aquileia]]; and Franks [[Angilbert]], Angilram, [[Einhard]] and [[Waldo of Reichenau]].\n\nCharlemagne promoted the [[liberal arts]] at court, ordering that his children and grandchildren be well-educated, and even studying himself (in a time when even leaders who promoted education did not take time to learn themselves) under the tutelage of Peter of Pisa, from whom he learned grammar; Alcuin, with whom he studied rhetoric, dialectic (logic), and astronomy (he was particularly interested in the movements of the stars); and Einhard, who tutored him in arithmetic.{{sfn|Dutton|2016}}\n\nHis great scholarly failure, as Einhard relates, was his inability to write: when in his old age he attempted to learn\u2014practising the formation of letters in his bed during his free time on books and wax tablets he hid under his pillow\u2014\"his effort came too late in life and achieved little success\", and his ability to read\u2014which Einhard is silent about, and which no contemporary source supports\u2014has also been called into question.{{sfn|Dutton|2016}}\n\nIn 800, Charlemagne enlarged the hostel at the [[Muristan]] in [[Jerusalem]] and added a library to it.

The deepening of the spiritual life was later to be seen as central to public policy and royal governance. His reform focused on strengthening the church's power structure, improving clergy's skill and moral quality, standardising liturgical practices, improvements on the basic tenets of the faith and the rooting out of paganism. His authority extended over church and state. He could discipline clerics, control ecclesiastical property and define orthodox doctrine. Despite the harsh legislation and sudden change, he had developed support from clergy who approved his desire to deepen the piety and morals of his subjects.<ref name=britannica>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106546/Charlemagne |title=Charlemagne |publisher=Britannica.com |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 809\u2013810, Charlemagne called a church council in [[Aachen]], which confirmed the unanimous belief in the West that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (''ex Patre [[Filioque]]'') and sanctioned inclusion in the [[Nicene Creed]] of the phrase ''Filioque'' (and the Son). For this Charlemagne sought the approval of [[Pope Leo III]]. The Pope, while affirming the doctrine and approving its use in teaching, opposed its inclusion in the text of the Creed as adopted in the 381 [[First Council of Constantinople]]. This spoke of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father, without adding phrases such as \"and the Son\", \"through the Son\", or \"alone\". Stressing his opposition, the Pope had the original text inscribed in Greek and Latin on two heavy shields that were displayed in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/dialogue-with-others/ecumenical/orthodox/filioque-church-dividing-issue-english.cfm |title=The Filioque: A Church-Dividing Issue?: An Agreed Statement of the North American Orthodox-Catholic Consultation |publisher=Usccb.org |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma5.ii.ii.i.vi.iv.html |title=Adolf Harnack, ''History of Dogma'', The Controversy regarding the Filioque and Pictures |publisher=Ccel.org |date=1 June 2005 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.tyndalehouse.com/TynBul/Library/TynBull_1983_34_04_Bray_FilioqueInHistory.pdf Gerald Bray, ''The ''Filioque'' Clause in History and Theology'' The Tyndale Historical Lecture 1982] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716095849/http://www.tyndalehouse.com/TynBul/Library/TynBull_1983_34_04_Bray_FilioqueInHistory.pdf |date=16 July 2011 }}, p.&nbsp;121</ref>\n\n===Writing reforms===\n[[File:Codexaureus 04.jpg|thumb|upright|Page from the [[Lorsch Gospels]] of Charlemagne's reign]]\n\nDuring Charles' reign, the [[uncial|Roman half uncial]] script and its cursive version, which had given rise to various continental [[Minuscule cursive|minuscule]] scripts, were combined with features from the [[insular script]]s in use in Irish and English monasteries. [[Carolingian minuscule]] was created partly under the patronage of Charlemagne. [[Alcuin]], who ran the palace school and [[scriptorium]] at Aachen, was probably a chief influence.\n\nThe revolutionary character of the Carolingian reform, however, can be over-emphasised; efforts at taming Merovingian and Germanic influence had been underway before Alcuin arrived at Aachen. The new minuscule was disseminated first from Aachen and later from the influential scriptorium at [[Tours]], where Alcuin retired as an abbot.\n\n===Political reforms===\nCharlemagne engaged in many reforms of Frankish governance while continuing many traditional practices, such as the division of the kingdom among sons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The rise of the medieval world, 500\u20131300: a biographical dictionary|last=Schulman|first=Jana K.|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2002|isbn=9780313011085|location=Westport, Conn.|page=xx}}</ref>\n\n====Divisio regnorum====\nIn 806, Charlemagne first made provision for the traditional division of the empire on his death. For Charles the Younger he designated Austrasia and Neustria, Saxony, Burgundy and [[Thuringia]]. To Pippin, he gave Italy, Bavaria, and [[Swabia]]. Louis received Aquitaine, the Spanish March and [[Provence]]. The imperial title was not mentioned, which led to the suggestion that, at that particular time, Charlemagne regarded the title as an honorary achievement that held no hereditary significance.\n\nPepin died in 810 and Charles in 811. Charlemagne then reconsidered the matter, and in 813, crowned his youngest son, Louis, co-emperor and co-King of the Franks, granting him a half-share of the empire and the rest upon Charlemagne's own death. The only part of the Empire that Louis was not promised was Italy, which Charlemagne specifically bestowed upon Pippin's illegitimate son [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Personality==\n\n===Manner===\nEinhard tells in his twenty-fourth chapter: <blockquote>Charles was temperate in eating, and particularly so in drinking, for he abominated drunkenness in anybody, much more in himself and those of his household; but he could not easily abstain from food, and often complained that fasts injured his health. He very rarely gave entertainments, only on great feast-days, and then to large numbers of people. His meals ordinarily consisted of four courses, not counting the roast, which his huntsmen used to bring in on the spit; he was more fond of this than of any other dish. While at table, he listened to reading or music. The subjects of the readings were the stories and deeds of olden time: he was fond, too, of St. Augustine's books, and especially of the one entitled \"The City of God\".{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=24.

When he was not working, he loved Christian books, horseback riding, swimming, bathing in natural hot springs with his friends and family, and hunting.<ref name=\"Bhote\"/> Franks were well known for horsemanship and hunting skills.<ref name=\"Bhote\"/> Charles was a light sleeper and would stay in his bed chambers for entire days at a time due to restless nights. During these days, he would not get out of bed when a quarrel occurred in his kingdom, instead summoning all members of the situation into his bedroom to be given orders. Einhard tells again in the twenty-fourth chapter: \"In summer after the midday meal, he would eat some fruit, drain a single cup, put off his clothes and shoes, just as he did for the night, and rest for two or three hours. He was in the habit of awaking and rising from bed four or five times during the night.\"<ref name=\"Bhote\">{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=BgDrUuug9c0C}}|title=Charlemagne: The Life and Times of an Early Medieval Emperor|last=Bhote|first=Tehmina|date=1 January 2005|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=9781404201613|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Theodiscus}}\n\nBy Charlemagne's time, the French vernacular had already diverged significantly from Latin.

Marriages and heirs\n! Concubinages and illegitimate children\n|-\n| c.768\n| His first relationship was with [[Himiltrude]]. The nature of this relationship is variously described as [[concubine|concubinage]], a legal marriage, or a [[Friedelehe]].<ref>Charlemagne's biographer [[Einhard]] (Vita Karoli Magni, ch. 20) calls her a \"concubine\" and [[Paulus Diaconus]] speaks of Pippin's birth \"before legal marriage\", whereas a letter by [[Pope Stephen III]] refers to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and [[Gerberga, wife of Carloman I|Gerberga]]), and advises them not to dismiss their wives. Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as [[Pierre Rich\u00e9]] (''The Carolingians'', p.86.), follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine. Others, for example Dieter H\u00e4gemann (''Karl der Gro\u00dfe. Herrscher des Abendlands'', p. 82f.), consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense. Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was \"something more than concubinage, less than marriage\" and describe it as a [[Friedelehe]], a form of marriage unrecognised by the Church and easily dissolvable. Russell Chamberlin (''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p. 61.), for instance, compared it with the English system of common-law marriage. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.</ref> (Charlemagne put her aside when he married Desiderata.)

One of the great medieval [[literary cycle]]s, the Charlemagne cycle or the ''[[Matter of France]]'', centres on his deeds\u2014the Emperor with the Flowing Beard of ''[[Song of Roland|Roland]]'' fame\u2014and his historical commander of the border with [[Brittany]], [[Roland]], and the 12 [[paladin]]s.

It should. It seems to be based, in large part, on the historical adventures of Charlemagne, the Frankish King of the Ninth Century, who eventually became Emperor. Looking at Charlemagne's life and personality, it becomes clear that he and Geoffrey's Arthur are practically twins.\"</ref> During the [[Hundred Years War]] in the 14th century, there was considerable cultural conflict in England, where the [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] rulers were aware of their French roots and identified with Charlemagne, Anglo-Saxon natives felt more affinity for Arthur, whose own legends were relatively primitive. Therefore, storytellers in England adapted legends of Charlemagne and his 12 Peers to the Arthurian tales.<ref>[http://www.mementomedievalia.com/charlemagne-king-arthur-and-contested-national-identity-in-english-romances/ Charlemagne, King Arthur and Contested National Identity in English Romances]<br /> Modelling his narrative on earlier Middle English texts, the English AMA-poet, appropriates aspects of the historical reality of Charlemagne and refashions them to fit Arthur, creating a hero that the English can claim as their own.</ref>\n\n[[File:D\u00fcrer karl der grosse.jpg|thumb|''Emperor Charlemagne'', by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1511\u20131513, [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]]]]\nIn the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', the spirit of Charlemagne appears to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] in the [[Paradiso (Dante)#Fifth Sphere (Mars: The Warriors of the Faith)|Heaven of Mars]], among the other \"warriors of the faith\".<ref name=\"DLS17\">[[Dorothy L.

When an HTML document includes special characters outside the range of seven-bit [[ASCII]] two goals are worth considering: the information's [[integrity]], and universal [[Web browser|browser]] display.\n\n==Specifying the document's character encoding==\nThere are several ways to specify which character encoding is used in the document. First, the [[web server]] can include the character encoding or \"<code>charset</code>\" in the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) <code>Content-Type</code> header, which would typically look like this:<ref>{{citation |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.5|chapter=Content-Type |title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content|publisher=[[IETF]] |date=June 2014 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}</ref>\n Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-4\nThis method gives the HTTP server a convenient way to alter document's encoding according to [[content negotiation]]; certain HTTP server software can do it, for example Apache with the [[List of Apache modules|module]] <code>mod_charset_lite</code>.<ref>[http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/en/mod/mod_charset_lite.html Apache Module mod_charset_lite]</ref>\n\nFor HTML it is possible to include this information inside the <code>head</code> element near the top of the document:<ref name=html5charset/>\n<!-- Please don't add a closing \"/\": that is incorrect here. -->\n<source lang=html4strict>\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\">\n</source>\n\n[[HTML5]] also allows the following syntax to mean exactly the same:<ref name=html5charset>{{citation |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#specifying-the-documents-character-encoding |chapter=Specifying the document's character encoding |title=HTML5 |publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] |date=14 December 2017 |accessdate=2018-05-28}}</ref>\n<!-- Please don't add a closing \"/\": that is unnecessary here. -->\n<source lang=html4strict>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n</source>\n\n[[XHTML]] documents have a third option: to express the character encoding via [[XML]] declaration, as follows:<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-prolog-dtd |chapter=Prolog and Document Type Declaration |title=XML |first1=T. |last1=Bray |authorlink1=Tim Bray |first2=J. |last2=Paoli |first3=C. |last3=Sperberg-McQueen |authorlink3=Michael Sperberg-McQueen |first4=E. |last4=Maler |first5=F. |last5=Yergeau |publisher=[[W3C]] |date=26 November 2008 |accessdate=8 March 2010}}</ref>\n<source lang=xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n</source>\n\nNote that as the character encoding cannot be known until this declaration is parsed, there can be a problem knowing which encoding is used for the declaration itself. The main principle is that the declaration shall be encoded in pure ASCII, and therefore (if the declaration is inside the file) the encoding needs to be an [[ASCII extension]]. In order to allow encodings not backwards compatible with ASCII, browsers must be able to parse declarations in such encodings. Examples of such encodings are [[UTF-16BE]] and [[UTF-16LE]].\n\nAs of HTML5 the recommended charset is [[UTF-8]].<ref name=html5charset/> An \"encoding sniffing algorithm\" is defined in the specification to determine the character encoding of the document based on multiple sources of input, including:\n# Explicit user instruction\n# An explicit meta tag within the first 1024 bytes of the document\n# A [[Byte order mark]] within the first three bytes of the document\n# The HTTP Content-Type or other transport layer information\n# Analysis of the document bytes looking for specific sequences or ranges of byte values,<ref>[http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#prescan-a-byte-stream-to-determine-its-encoding HTML5 prescan a byte stream to determine its encoding]</ref> and other tentative detection mechanisms.\n\nFor ASCII-compatible character encodings the consequence of choosing incorrectly is that characters outside the printable ASCII range (32 to 126) usually appear incorrectly. This presents few problems for [[English language|English]]-speaking users, but other languages regularly\u2014in some cases, always\u2014require characters outside that range. In [[CJK]] environments where there are several different multi-byte encodings in use, auto-detection is also often employed. Finally, browsers usually permit the user to override ''incorrect'' charset label manually as well.\n\nIt is increasingly common for multilingual websites and websites in non-Western languages to use [[UTF-8]], which allows use of the same encoding for all languages. [[UTF-16]] or [[UTF-32]], which can be used for all languages as well, are less widely used because they can be harder to handle in programming languages that assume a [[byte-oriented]] ASCII superset encoding, and they are less efficient for text with a high frequency of ASCII characters, which is usually the case for HTML documents.\n\nSuccessful viewing of a page is not necessarily an indication that its encoding is specified correctly. If the page's creator and reader are both assuming some platform-specific character encoding, and the server does not send any identifying information, then the reader will nonetheless see the page as the creator intended, but other readers on different platforms or with different native languages will not see the page as intended.\n\n==Character references==\n{{Main|Character entity reference|Numeric character reference}}\n\nIn addition to native character encodings, characters can also be encoded as ''character references'', which can be ''numeric character references'' ([[decimal]] or [[hexadecimal]]) or ''character entity references''. Character entity references are also sometimes referred to as ''named entities'', or ''HTML entities'' for HTML. HTML's usage of character references derives from [[SGML]].\n\n===HTML character references===\n<!--Linked from [[Template:Auxiliary template common notice]]-->\nA ''numeric character reference'' in HTML refers to a character by its [[Universal Character Set]]/[[Unicode]] ''code point'', and uses the format\n\n:<code>&#''nnnn'';</code>\nor\n:<code>&#x''hhhh'';</code>\n\nwhere ''nnnn'' is the code point in [[decimal]] form, and ''hhhh'' is the code point in [[hexadecimal]] form. The ''x'' must be lowercase in XML documents. The ''nnnn'' or ''hhhh'' may be any number of digits and may include leading zeros. The ''hhhh'' may mix uppercase and lowercase, though uppercase is the usual style.\n\nNot all [[web browser]]s or [[email client]]s used by receivers of HTML documents, or [[text editor]]s used by authors of HTML documents, will be able to render all HTML characters. Most modern software is able to display most or all of the characters for the user's language, and will draw a box or other clear indicator for characters they cannot render.\n\nFor codes from 0 to 127, the original 7-bit [[ASCII]] standard set, most of these characters can be used without a character reference. Codes from 160 to 255 can all be created using [[List of XML and HTML character entity references|character entity names]]. Only a few higher-numbered codes can be created using entity names, but all can be created by decimal number character reference.\n\nCharacter entity references can also have the format <code>&amp;''name'';</code> where ''name'' is a case-sensitive alphanumeric string. For example, \"\u03bb\" can also be encoded as <code>&amp;lambda;</code> in an HTML document. The character entity references <code>&amp;lt;</code>, <code>&amp;gt;</code>, <code>&amp;quot;</code> and <code>&amp;amp;</code> are predefined in HTML and SGML, because <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>\"</code>  and <code>&amp;</code> are already used to delimit markup. This notably does not include XML's <code>&amp;apos;</code> (') entity. For a list of all named HTML character entity references (about 250), see [[List of XML and HTML character entity references]].\n\nUnnecessary use of HTML character references may significantly reduce HTML readability. If the character encoding for a web page is chosen appropriately, then HTML character references are usually only required for markup delimiting characters as mentioned above, and for a few special characters (or none at all if a native [[Unicode]] encoding like [[UTF-8]] is used). Incorrect HTML entity escaping may also open up security vulnerabilities for injection attacks such as [[cross-site scripting]]. If HTML attributes are left unquoted, certain characters, most importantly [[whitespace character|whitespace]], such as space and tab, must be escaped using entities. Other languages related to HTML have their own methods of escaping characters.\n\n===XML character references===\nUnlike traditional HTML with its large range of character entity references, in [[XML]] there are only five predefined character entity references. These are used to escape characters that are markup sensitive in certain contexts:<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-references |chapter=Character and Entity References |title=XML |first1=T. |last1=Bray |authorlink1=Tim Bray |first2=J. |last2=Paoli |first3=C. |last3=Sperberg-McQueen |authorlink3=Michael Sperberg-McQueen |first4=E. |last4=Maler |first5=F. |last5=Yergeau |publisher=[[W3C]] |date=26 November 2008 |accessdate=8 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n*<code>&amp;amp;</code>  \u2192 & ([[ampersand]], U+0026)\n*<code>&amp;lt;</code>   \u2192 < (less-than sign, U+003C)\n*<code>&amp;gt;</code>   \u2192 > (greater-than sign, U+003E)\n*<code>&amp;quot;</code> \u2192 \" (quotation mark, U+0022)\n*<code>&amp;apos;</code> \u2192 ' (apostrophe, U+0027)\n\nAll other character entity references have to be defined before they can be used. For example, use of <code>&amp;eacute;</code> (which gives \u00e9, Latin lower-case E with acute accent, U+00E9 in Unicode) in an XML document will generate an error unless the entity has already been defined. XML also requires that the <code>x</code> in hexadecimal numeric references be in lowercase: for example <code>&amp;#xA1b</code> rather than <code>&amp;#XA1b</code>. [[XHTML]], which is an XML application, supports the HTML entity set, along with XML's predefined entities.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Charset sniffing]] \u2013 used by many browsers when character encoding metadata is not available\n* [[Unicode and HTML]]\n* [[Language code]]\n* [[List of XML and HTML character entity references]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/entities.html Character entity references in HTML4]\n* [http://www.sitepoint.com/article/guide-web-character-encoding/ The Definitive Guide to Web Character Encoding]\n* [http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part1#HTML_entity_encoding HTML Entity Encoding chapter of Browser Security Handbook - more information about current browsers and their entity handling]\n* [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet The Open Web Application Security Project's wiki article on cross-site scripting (XSS)]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Character Encodings In Html}}\n[[Category:HTML]]\n[[Category:World Wide Web Consortium standards]]", "sha1": "g4y4mhnnaw5bqk28i52ts6f4vxkzag5"}}, {"title": "Computer/Time-sharing", "ns": "0", "id": "5318", "redirect": {"title": "Time-sharing"}, "revision": {"id": "93160589", "parentid": "15903531", "timestamp": "2006-12-09T15:51:26Z", "contributor": {"username": "R'n'B", "id": "2300502"}, "minor": "", "comment": "remove text following redirect  using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Time-sharing]]", "sha1": "hfkxg4tq2faad5394qpu2bdqa0lzo4i"}}, {"title": "Computer/Multitasking", "ns": "0", "id": "5319", "redirect": {"title": "Computer multitasking"}, "revision": {"id": "93160565", "parentid": "15903532", "timestamp": "2006-12-09T15:51:18Z", "contributor": {"username": "R'n'B", "id": "2300502"}, "minor": "", "comment": "remove text following redirect  using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Computer multitasking]]", "sha1": "rmzu8f77sxho3sjsqic90hqbldy5erk"}}, {"title": "Carbon nanotube", "ns": "0", "id": "5320", "revision": {"id": "864355425", "parentid": "863146291", "timestamp": "2018-10-16T17:35:25Z", "contributor": {"username": "Swpb", "id": "1921264"}, "comment": "/* Junctions and crosslinking */clean up - [[WP:ACCIM]] rule #6", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Distinguish|Carbon fibers}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2016}}\n{{Nanomat}}\n[[Image:Kohlenstoffnanoroehre Animation.gif|right|frame|Rotating single-walled zigzag carbon nanotube]]\n\n'''Carbon nanotubes''' ('''CNTs''') are [[allotropes of carbon]] with a [[cylindrical]] [[nanostructure]].

Their name is derived from their long, hollow structure with the walls formed by one-atom-thick sheets of carbon, called [[graphene]]. These sheets are rolled at specific and discrete (\"[[chirality|chiral]]\") angles, and the combination of the rolling angle and radius decides the nanotube properties; for example, whether the individual nanotube shell is a [[metal]] or [[semiconductor]]. Nanotubes are categorized as [[#Single-walled|single-walled nanotubes]] (SWNTs) and [[#Multi-walled|multi-walled nanotubes]] (MWNTs). Individual nanotubes naturally align themselves into \"ropes\" held together by [[van der Waals force]]s, more specifically, [[pi-stacking]].\n\nApplied [[quantum chemistry]], specifically, [[orbital hybridization]] best describes chemical bonding in nanotubes. The [[chemical bonding]] of nanotubes involves entirely [[Sp2 bond|''sp''<sup>2</sup>]]-hybrid carbon atoms. These bonds, which are similar to those of [[graphite]] and stronger than those found in [[alkane]]s and [[diamond]] (which employ [[Sp3 bond|''sp''<sup>3</sup>]]-hybrid carbon atoms), provide nanotubes with their unique strength.\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n== Types of carbon nanotubes and related structures ==\nThere is no consensus on some terms describing carbon nanotubes in scientific literature: both \"-wall\" and \"-walled\" are being used in combination with \"single\", \"double\", \"triple\" or \"multi\", and the letter C is often omitted in the abbreviation; for example, multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT).\n\n=== Single-walled ===\n<gallery perrow=\"4\" widths=\"160px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:Carbon nanotube armchair povray.PNG|Armchair (''n'',''n'') i.e.: m=n\nFile:Carbon nanorim armchair povray.PNG|The translation vector is bent, while the chiral vector stays straight\nFile:Carbon nanoribbon povray.PNG|Graphene nanoribbon\nFile:Carbon nanorim zigzag povray.PNG|The chiral vector is bent, while the translation vector stays straight\nFile:Carbon nanotube zigzag povray.PNG|Zigzag (''n'',0)\nFile:Carbon nanotube chiral povray.PNG|Chiral (''n'',''m'')\nFile:Carbon nanorim chiral povray.PNG|''n'' and ''m'' can be counted at the end of the tube\nFile:Carbon nanoribbon chiral povray.PNG|Graphene nanoribbon\n</gallery>\n\n[[Image:CNTnames.svg|thumb|300px|left|The (''n'',''m'') nanotube naming scheme can be thought of as a vector ('''C'''<sub>h</sub>) in an infinite graphene sheet that describes how to \"roll up\" the graphene sheet to make the nanotube.

In particular, their [[band gap]] can vary from zero to about 2 eV and their electrical conductivity can show metallic or semiconducting behavior. Single-walled nanotubes are likely candidates for miniaturizing electronics. The most basic building block of these systems is the electric wire, and SWNTs with diameters of an order of a nanometer can be excellent conductors.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Mintmire |first1=J.W.\n |last2=Dunlap |first2=B.I.\n |last3=White |first3=C.T.\n |year=1992\n |title=Are Fullerene Tubules Metallic?\n |journal=Phys.

There are two models that can be used to describe the structures of multi-walled nanotubes. In the ''[[Matryoshka doll|Russian Doll]]'' model, sheets of graphite are arranged in concentric cylinders, e.g., a (0,8) single-walled nanotube (SWNT) within a larger (0,17) single-walled nanotube. In the ''[[Scroll (parchment)|Parchment]]'' model, a single sheet of graphite is rolled in around itself, resembling a scroll of parchment or a rolled newspaper. The interlayer distance in multi-walled nanotubes is close to the distance between graphene layers in graphite, approximately 3.4 \u00c5. The Russian Doll structure is observed more commonly. Its individual shells can be described as SWNTs, which can be metallic or semiconducting. Because of statistical probability and restrictions on the relative diameters of the individual tubes, one of the shells, and thus the whole MWNT, is usually a zero-gap metal.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nDouble-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) form a special class of nanotubes because their [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and properties are similar to those of SWNTs but they are more resistant to chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} This is especially important when it is necessary to graft chemical functions to the surface of the nanotubes ([[Surface functionalization|functionalization]]) to add properties to the CNT.

Spectroscopic methods offer the possibility of quick and non-destructive characterization of relatively large amounts of carbon nanotubes. There is a strong demand for such characterization from the industrial point of view: numerous parameters of the [[Carbon nanotube#Synthesis|nanotube synthesis]] can be changed, intentionally or unintentionally, to alter the nanotube quality. As shown below, optical absorption, photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopies allow quick and reliable characterization of this \"nanotube quality\" in terms of non-tubular carbon content, structure (chirality) of the produced nanotubes, and structural defects. Those features determine nearly any other properties such as optical, mechanical, and electrical properties.\n\n[[Carbon nanotubes]] are unique \"one-dimensional systems\" which can be envisioned as rolled single sheets of [[graphite]] (or more precisely [[graphene]]). This rolling can be done at different angles and curvatures resulting in different nanotube properties.

A substrate (quartz, silicon, stainless steel, etc.) is coated with a catalytic metal (Fe, Co, Ni) layer.  Typically that layer is iron, and is deposited via sputtering to a thickness of 1\u20135&nbsp;nm.  A 10\u201350&nbsp;nm underlayer of alumina is often also put down on the substrate first. This imparts controllable wetting and good interfacial properties.\nWhen the substrate is heated to the growth temperature (~700&nbsp;\u00b0C), the continuous iron film breaks up into small islands\u2026 each island then nucleates a carbon nanotube.  The sputtered thickness controls the island size, and this in turn determines the nanotube diameter. Thinner iron layers drive down the diameter of the islands, and they drive down the diameter of the nanotubes grown.  The amount of time that the metal island can sit at the growth temperature is limited, as they are mobile, and can merge into larger (but fewer) islands.  Annealing at the growth temperature reduces the site density (number of CNT/mm<sup>2</sup>) while increasing the catalyst diameter.\n\nThe as-prepared carbon nanotubes always have impurities such as other forms of carbon (amorphous carbon, fullerene, etc.) and non-carbonaceous impurities (metal pes used for catalyst).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Itkis|first=M.

The etymology of the word ''\u010cech'' can be traced back to the [[Proto-Slavic]] root ''*\u010del-'', meaning \"member of the people; kinsman\", thus making it [[cognate (linguistics)|cognate]] to the Czech word ''[[:wiktionary:\u010dlov\u011bk|\u010dlov\u011bk]]'' (a person).<ref>{{cite web|last=Spal|first=Jarom\u00edr|title=P\u016fvod jm\u00e9na \u010cech|url=http://nase-rec.ujc.cas.cz/archiv.php?art=4320|publisher=Na\u0161e \u0159e\u010d|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe country has been traditionally divided into three lands, namely [[Bohemia]] (''\u010cechy'') in the west, [[Moravia]] (''Morava'') in the east, and [[Czech Silesia]] (''Slezsko''; the smaller, south-eastern part of [[Silesia|historical Silesia]], most of which is located within modern Poland) in the northeast. Known as the ''lands of the Bohemian Crown'' since the 14th century, a number of other names for the country have been used, including ''Czech/Bohemian lands'', ''Bohemian Crown'', ''Czechia'' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/letter/from-bohemia-to-czechia|title=From Bohemia to Czechia - Radio Prague|publisher=}}</ref> and the ''lands of the Crown of [[Saint Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Saint Wenceslas]]''. When the country regained its independence after the dissolution of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]] in 1918, the new name of ''Czechoslovakia'' was coined to reflect the union of the Czech and Slovak nations within the one country.\n\nAfter Czechoslovakia dissolved in 1992, the Czech part lacked a common English short name. The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended the English name ''Czechia'' in 1993, and the Czech government [[Name of the Czech Republic#Adoption of Czechia|approved ''Czechia'']] as the official short name in 2016.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Czech lands}}\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | total_width = 320\n | direction = horizontal\n | width1 = 1020  | height1 = 1992\n | image1 = Vestonicka venuse edit.jpg\n | alt1 = Stone sculpture\n | width2 = 450 | height2 = 314\n | image2 = Celtic expansion in Europe.png\n | alt2 = Map\n| footer = Left: ''[[Venus of Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice]]'' is the oldest ceramic article in the world, dated to 29,000\u201325,000 [[Common Era|BCE]]<br />Right: Distribution of [[Celts|Celtic]] peoples, showing expansion of the core territory in the [[Czech lands]], which were inhabited by the [[Gauls|Gallic]] tribe of [[Boii]]\n{{legend|#ffff43|The core [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] territory before 500 BCE}}\n{{legend|#97ffb6|Maximum Celtic expansion by the 270s BCE}}\n{{legend|#27c600|Areas that remain Celtic-speaking today}}\n}}\nArchaeologists have found evidence of prehistoric human settlements in the area, dating back to the [[Paleolithic]] era.

Their king [[Maroboduus]] is the first documented ruler of Bohemia. During the [[Migration Period]] around the 5th century, many Germanic tribes moved westwards and southwards out of Central Europe.\n\n[[Slavic people]] from the [[Black Sea]]\u2013[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] region settled in the area (a movement that was also stimulated by the onslaught of peoples from [[Siberia]] and Eastern Europe: [[Huns]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyars]]). In the sixth century, they moved westwards into Bohemia, Moravia and some of present-day Austria and Germany.\n\nDuring the 7th century, the Frankish merchant [[Samo]], supporting the Slavs fighting against nearby settled [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], became the ruler of the first known Slav state in Central Europe, the [[Samo's Empire]]. The principality [[Great Moravia]], controlled by [[House of Mojmir|Moymir dynasty]], arose in the 8th century and reached its zenith in the 9th (during the reign of [[Svatopluk I of Moravia]]) when it held off the influence of the Franks. Great Moravia was Christianized, with a crucial role being played by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] mission of [[Cyril and Methodius]]. They created the artificial language [[Old Church Slavonic]], the first literary and liturgic language of the [[Slavs]], and the [[Glagolitic alphabet]].\n\n=== Bohemia ===\n{{Main|Bohemia}}\n[[File:Duchy of Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire in 11th century.svg|thumb|The [[Duchy of Bohemia]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 11th century]]\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] emerged in the late 9th century, when it was unified by the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]]. In 10th century [[Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia]] conquered [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]] and expanded farther to the east. The Duchy of Bohemia, raised to the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] in 1198, was from 1002 until 1806 an [[Imperial State]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] alongside the [[Kingdom of Germany]], the [[Kingdom of Arles|Kingdom of Burgundy]], the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] and numerous other territories such as the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] and various [[Papal States]]. The kingdom was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|P\u0159emysl Ottokar I]] (bearing the title \"king\" from 1198) extracted the [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor, confirming Ottokar and his descendants' royal status; the [[Duchy]] of Bohemia was raised to a [[Realm|Kingdom]]. The bull declared that the King of Bohemia would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in imperial councils. German immigrants settled in the Bohemian periphery in the 13th century. Germans populated towns and mining districts and, in some cases, formed German colonies in the interior of Bohemia. In 1235, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] launched an [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of Europe]].

The Communist [[People's Militias (Czechoslovakia)|People's Militias]] secured control of key locations in Prague, and a single party government was formed.\n\n[[File:10 Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|thumb|The [[Prague Spring]] political liberalization of the communist regime was stopped by the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet-led invasion]].]]\nFor the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948\u20131989)|next 41 years]], Czechoslovakia was a Communist state within the [[Eastern Bloc]]. This period is characterized by lagging behind the West in almost every aspect of social and economic development. The country's GDP per capita fell from the level of neighboring Austria below that of Greece or Portugal in the 1980s. The Communist government completely [[Nationalization|nationalized]] the [[means of production]] and established a [[Planned economy|command economy]]. The economy grew rapidly during the 1950s but slowed down in the 1960s and 1970s and stagnated in the 1980s.\n\nThe political climate was highly repressive during the 1950s, including numerous [[show trial]]s (the most famous victims: [[Milada Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1]] and [[Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd]]) and hundreds of thousands of political prisoners, but became more open and tolerant in the late 1960s, culminating in [[Alexander Dub\u010dek]]'s leadership in the 1968 [[Prague Spring]], which tried to create \"[[socialism with a human face]]\" and perhaps even introduce political [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]]. This was forcibly ended by [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion]] by all [[Warsaw Pact]] member countries with the exception of [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] and [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] on 21 August 1968. Student [[Jan Palach]] became a symbol of resistance to the occupation, when he committed [[self-immolation]] as a political protest.\n\nThe invasion was followed by a harsh program of \"[[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|Normalization]]\" in the late 1960s and the 1970s. Until 1989, the political establishment relied on censorship of the opposition. Dissidents published [[Charter 77]] in 1977, and the first of a new wave of protests were seen in 1988. Between 1948 and 1989 about 250,000 Czechs and Slovaks were sent to prison for political reasons, and over 400,000 emigrated.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4388764.stm|title=Czech schools revisit communism|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Velvet Revolution and the European Union ===\n{{Main|Velvet Revolution|Dissolution of Czechoslovakia}}\n[[File:Vaclav Havel cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[V\u00e1clav Havel]], first [[President of the Czech Republic]]]]\n\nIn November 1989, Czechoslovakia returned to a liberal democracy through the peaceful \"[[Velvet Revolution]]\" (led by [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] and his [[Civic Forum]]). However, Slovak national aspirations strengthened (see [[Hyphen War]]) and on 1 January 1993, the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|country peacefully split]] into the independent Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]]. Both countries went through economic reforms and [[privatisation]]s, with the intention of creating a [[market economy]]. This process was largely successful; in 2006 the Czech Republic was recognised by the World Bank as a \"developed country\",<ref name=\"worldbank06\" /> and in 2009 the [[Human Development Index]] ranked it as a nation of \"Very High Human Development\".<ref name=\"hdi09\">{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2009_EN_Complete.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2009|work=UNDP.org |format=PDF |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1991, the Czech Republic, originally as part of Czechoslovakia and since 1993 in its own right, has been a member of the [[Visegr\u00e1d Group]] and from 1995, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]. The Czech Republic joined [[NATO]] on 12 March 1999 and the [[European Union]] on 1 May 2004. On 21 December 2007 the Czech Republic joined the [[Schengen Area]]. Until 2017, either the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] (under [[Milo\u0161 Zeman]], [[Vladim\u00edr \u0160pidla]], [[Stanislav Gross]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Paroubek]] and [[Bohuslav Sobotka]]), or [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|liberal-conservatives]] (under [[V\u00e1clav Klaus]], [[Mirek Topol\u00e1nek]] and [[Petr Ne\u010das]]) led the government of the Czech Republic.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Main|Geography of the Czech Republic}}\n[[File:CzechRepublic-geographic map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map]]\n\nThe Czech Republic lies mostly between latitudes [[48th parallel north|48\u00b0]] and [[51st parallel north|51\u00b0 N]] (a small area lies north of 51\u00b0), and longitudes [[12th meridian east|12\u00b0]] and [[19th meridian east|19\u00b0 E]].\n\nThe Czech landscape is exceedingly varied. [[Bohemia]], to the west, consists of a basin drained by the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] rivers, surrounded by mostly low mountains, such as the [[Krkono\u0161e]] range of the [[Sudetes]]. The highest point in the country, [[Sn\u011b\u017eka]] at {{convert|1603|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located here. Moravia, the eastern part of the country, is also quite hilly. It is drained mainly by the [[Morava (river)|Morava River]], but it also contains the source of the [[Oder]] River ({{lang-cs|Odra}}).\n\nWater from the landlocked Czech Republic flows to three different seas: the [[North Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]]. The Czech Republic also leases the [[Moldauhafen]], a {{convert|30000|m2|acre|adj=on}} [[lot (real estate)|lot]] in the middle of the [[Hamburg]] Docks, which was awarded to Czechoslovakia by Article 363 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported down river could be transferred to seagoing ships. The territory reverts to Germany in 2028.\n\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the Czech Republic belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]], within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the territory of the Czech Republic can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Western European broadleaf forests]], Central European mixed forests, Pannonian mixed forests, and Carpathian montane conifer forests.\n\nThere are four [[national park]]s in the Czech Republic. The oldest is [[Krkono\u0161e National Park]] ([[Man and the Biosphere Programme|Biosphere Reserve]]), and the others are [[\u0160umava National Park]] (Biosphere Reserve), [[Podyj\u00ed National Park]], [[Bohemian Switzerland]].\n\nThe three historical lands of the Czech Republic (formerly the core countries of the Bohemian Crown) correspond almost perfectly with the river basins of the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] basin for Bohemia, the Morava one for Moravia, and the Oder river basin for Czech Silesia (in terms of the Czech territory).\n\n{{multiple image\n | align  = center\n | total_width = 1000\n | width1 = 1300\n | height1 = 867\n | image1 = K\u0159ivokl\u00e1tsko - Podzimn\u00ed bu\u010dina.JPG\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = [[Temperate deciduous forest]] in [[K\u0159ivokl\u00e1tsko Protected Landscape Area]]\n | width2 = 1600\n | height2 = 1022\n | image2 = Kralicky-Sneznik-03.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = Rolling hills of [[Kr\u00e1lick\u00fd Sn\u011b\u017en\u00edk]] in northern Czech Republic\n | width3 = 3010\n | height3 = 2000\n | image3 = Podzim na Ka\u0161perku.jpg\n | alt3 = \n | caption3 = [[Bohemian Forest]] foothills and [[Ka\u0161perk]] castle, southern Bohemia\n | width4 = 5184\n | height4 = 3888\n | image4 = Berounka, z Kra\u0161ova k v\u00fdchodu.jpg\n | caption4 = [[Berounka]] river valley in western Bohemia\n | width5 = 1280\n | height5 = 960\n | image5 = \u010celadenka (CZE) - the river.jpg\n | caption5 = [[Moravian-Silesian Beskids|Beskids]] mountains in eastern Moravia\n}}\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Czech Republic K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] types of the Czech Republic\n{{legend|#3dc6fa|[[Humid continental climate]]}}\n{{legend|#63fd32|[[Oceanic climate]]}}\n{{legend|#007e7e|[[Subarctic climate]]}}\n]]\n\nThe Czech Republic mostly has a temperate [[oceanic climate]], with warm summers and cold, cloudy and snowy winters. The temperature difference between summer and winter is relatively high, due to the landlocked geographical position.<ref>R. Tolasz, ''Climate Atlas of the Czech Republic'', Czech Hydrometeorological Institute, Prague, 2007. {{ISBN|80-244-1626-3}}, graphs 1.5 and 1.6</ref>\n\nWithin the Czech Republic, temperatures vary greatly, depending on the elevation. In general, at higher altitudes, the temperatures decrease and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] increases. The wettest area in the Czech Republic is found around [[B\u00edl\u00fd Potok (Liberec District)|B\u00edl\u00fd Potok]] in [[Jizera Mountains]] and the driest region is the [[Louny District]] to the northwest of [[Prague]]. Another important factor is the distribution of the mountains; therefore, the climate is quite varied.\n\nAt the highest peak of [[Sn\u011b\u017eka]] ({{convert|1603|m|ft|abbr=on|0|disp=or}}), the average temperature is only {{convert|-0.4|C|F|0}}, whereas in the lowlands of the [[South Moravian Region]], the average temperature is as high as {{convert|10|C|F}}. The country's capital, [[Prague]], has a similar average temperature, although this is influenced by urban factors.\n\nThe coldest month is usually January, followed by February and December. During these months, there is usually snow in the mountains and sometimes in the major cities and lowlands. During March, April and May, the temperature usually increases rapidly, especially during April, when the temperature and weather tends to vary widely during the day. Spring is also characterized by high water levels in the rivers, due to melting snow with occasional flooding.\n\nThe warmest month of the year is July, followed by August and June. On average, summer temperatures are about {{convert|20|C-change|F-change}} \u2013 {{convert|30|C-change|F-change}} higher than during winter. Summer is also characterized by rain and storms.\n\n[[File:Beskid \u015al\u0105sko-Morawski - panorama 2-edit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|[[Moravian-Silesian Beskids]]]]\n\nAutumn generally begins in September, which is still relatively warm and dry. During October, temperatures usually fall below {{convert|15|C|F}} or {{convert|10|C|F}} and [[deciduous]] trees begin to shed their leaves. By the end of November, temperatures usually range around the freezing point.\n\nThe coldest temperature ever measured was in Litv\u00ednovice near [[\u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice]] in 1929, at {{convert|-42.2|C|F}} and the hottest measured, was at {{convert|40.4|C|F}} in [[Dob\u0159ichovice]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Czech absolute record temperature registered near Prague|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-absolute-record-temperature-registered-near-prague/830626|work=\u010cesk\u00e9 noviny|publisher=\u010cTK|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nMost rain falls during the summer. Sporadic rainfall is relatively constant throughout the year (in Prague, the average number of days per month experiencing at least 0.1&nbsp;mm of rain varies from 12 in September and October to 16 in November) but concentrated heavy rainfall (days with more than 10&nbsp;mm per day) are more frequent in the months of May to August (average around two such days per month).<ref>R.

[[Nuclear power]] presently provides about 30 percent of the total power needs, its share is projected to increase to 40 percent. In 2005, 65.4 percent of electricity was produced by steam and combustion power plants (mostly coal); 30 percent by [[nuclear power|nuclear plants]]; and 4.6 percent from renewable sources, including hydropower. The largest Czech power resource is [[Temel\u00edn Nuclear Power Station]], another [[nuclear power plant]] is in [[Dukovany Nuclear Power Station|Dukovany]].\n\nThe Czech Republic is reducing its dependence on highly polluting low-grade [[Lignite|brown coal]] as a source of energy. Natural gas is procured from Russian [[Gazprom]], roughly three-fourths of domestic consumption and from Norwegian companies, which make up most of the remaining one-fourth. Russian gas is imported via Ukraine ([[Druzhba pipeline]]), Norwegian gas is transported through Germany. Gas consumption (approx. 100 TWh in 2003\u20132005) is almost double electricity consumption.

The research based on cooperation between [[List of universities in the Czech Republic|universities]], [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic|Academy of Sciences]] and specialised research centers brings new inventions and impulses in this area. Important inventions include the modern [[contact lens]], the separation of modern [[blood type]]s, and the production of [[Semtex]] [[plastic explosive]].\n\n==== Humanities ====\n[[File:Jan Hus 2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Jan Hus]] (1369 \u2013 1415) is a key figure of the [[Bohemian Reformation]] and inspired the pre-[[Protestant]] [[Hussite movement]].]]\n[[Cyril and Methodius]] laid the foundations of education and the Czech theological thinking in the 9th century. Original theological and philosophical stream \u2013 [[Hussitism]] \u2013 originated in the Middle Ages. It was represented by [[Jan Hus]], [[Jerome of Prague]] or [[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd]]. At the end of the Middle Ages, [[Jan Amos Comenius]] substantially contributed to the development of modern pedagogy. Jewish philosophy in the Czech lands was represented mainly by [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] (known for the legend of the [[Golem]] of Prague). [[Bernard Bolzano]] was the personality of German-speaking philosophy in the Czech lands. [[Bohuslav Balb\u00edn]] was a key Czech philosopher and historian of the Baroque era. He also started the struggle for rescuing the Czech language. This culminated in the [[Czech national revival]] in the first half of the 19th century. Linguistics ([[Josef Dobrovsk\u00fd]], [[Pavel Jozef \u0160afa\u0159\u00edk]], [[Josef Jungmann]]), etnography ([[Karel Jarom\u00edr Erben]], [[Franti\u0161ek Ladislav \u010celakovsk\u00fd]]) and history ([[Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd]]) played a big role in revival. Palack\u00fd was the eminent personality. He wrote the first synthetic history of the Czech nation. He was also the first Czech modern politician and geopolitician (see also [[Austro-Slavism]]). He is often called \"The Father of the Nation\". \n\nIn the second half of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century there was a huge development of social sciences. [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] laid the foundations of Czech sociology. [[Konstantin Jire\u010dek]] founded Byzantology (see also [[Jire\u010dek Line]]). [[Alois Musil]] was a prominent orientalist, [[Emil Holub]] ethnographer. [[Lubor Niederle]] was a founder of modern Czech archeology. [[Sigmund Freud]] established psychoanalysis. [[Edmund Husserl]] defined a new philosophical doctrine \u2013 phenomenology. [[Joseph Schumpeter]] brought genuine economic ideas of \"creative destruction\" of capitalism. [[Hans Kelsen]] was significant legal theorist. [[Karl Kautsky]] influenced the history of Marxism. On the contrary, economist [[Eugen B\u00f6hm von Bawerk]] led a campaign against Marxism. [[Max Wertheimer]] was one of the three founders of Gestalt psychology. Musicologists [[Eduard Hanslick]] and [[Guido Adler]] influenced debates on the development of classical music in Vienna. \n\nThe new Czechoslovak republic (1918\u20131938) wanted to develop sciences. Significant linguistic school was established in Prague \u2013 [[Prague Linguistic Circle]] ([[Vil\u00e9m Mathesius]], [[Jan Muka\u0159ovsk\u00fd]], [[Ren\u00e9 Wellek]]), moreover linguist [[Bed\u0159ich Hrozn\u00fd]] deciphered the ancient Hittite language and linguist [[Julius Pokorny]] deepened knowledge about Celtic languages. Philosopher [[Herbert Feigl]] was a member of the Vienna Circle. [[Ladislav Kl\u00edma]] has developed a special version of Nietzschean philosophy. In the second half of the 20th century can be mentioned philosopher [[Ernest Gellner]] who is considered one of the leading theoreticians on the issue of nationalism. Also Czech historian [[Miroslav Hroch]] analyzed modern nationalism. [[Vil\u00e9m Flusser]] developed the philosophy of technology and image. Marxist [[Karel Kos\u00edk]] was a major philosopher in the background of the Prague Spring 1968. [[Jan Pato\u010dka]] and [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] were the main ideologists of the Charter 77. [[Egon Bondy]] was a major philosophical spokesman of the Czech underground in the 1970s and 1980s. Czech Egyptology has scored some successes, its main representative is [[Miroslav Verner]]. Czech psychologist [[Stanislav Grof]] developed a method of \"Holotropic Breathwork\". Experimental archaeologist [[Pavel Pavel]] made several attempts, they had to answer the question how ancient civilizations transported heavy weights.\n\n==== Science and technology ====\n[[File:Heyrovsky J.jpg|thumb|upright|Nobel Prize laureate [[Jaroslav Heyrovsk\u00fd]] in the lab]]\n{{multiple image\n | footer = Brothers [[Josef \u010capek]] (left) and [[Karel \u010capek]] (right), invented and introduced the word [[robot]]\n | align  = right\n | width1 = 123\n | image1 = Josef Capek 1937.jpg\n | alt1 = Portrait\n | width2 = 123\n | image2 = Karel-capek.jpg\n | alt2 = Portrait\n}}\n[[File:Gregor Mendel portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gregor Mendel]], founder of [[genetics]]]]\n[[File:Jan Evangelista Purkyne 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jan Evangelista Purkyn\u011b]]]]\nFamous scientists who were born on the territory of the current Czech Republic:\n* [[Friedrich von Berchtold]] (1781\u20131876), botanist, an avid worker for Czech national revival.\n* [[Wenceslas Bojer]] (1795\u20131856), naturalist and botanist.\n* [[Ignaz von Born]] (1742\u20131791), mineralogist and metallurgist, one of founders of the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences.\n* [[Stanislav Brebera]] (1925\u20132012), inventor of the [[plastic explosive]] [[Semtex]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite web | title=Velik\u00e1ni \u010desk\u00e9 v\u011bdy | url=http://www.velikani-ceske-vedy.estranky.cz/clanky/biografie/stanislav-brebera |accessdate=1 November 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Josef \u010capek]] (1887\u20131945) and [[Karel \u010capek]] (1890\u20131938), brothers who originated the word [[robot]], for drama [[R.U.R.]]\n* [[Eduard \u010cech]] (1893\u20131960), mathematician with significant contributions in topology.\n* [[V\u00e1clav Prokop Divi\u0161]] (1698\u20131765), inventor of the first grounded [[lightning rod]].\n* [[Karel Domin]] (1882\u20131953), botanist, specialist in Australian taxonomy\n* [[Franti\u0161ek Josef Gerstner]] (1756\u20131832), physicist and engineer, built the first iron works and the first steam engine in Czech lands.\n* [[Gerty Cori|Gerty]] and [[Carl Cori]] \u2013 Nobel Prize laureates in Physiology or Medicine 1947.\n* [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] (1906\u20131978) logician and mathematician, who became famous for his two incompleteness theorems.\n* [[Peter Gr\u00fcnberg]] (* 1939) Nobel Prize laureate in Physics 2007.\n* [[Jaroslav Heyrovsk\u00fd]] (1890\u20131967), inventor of [[polarography]], [[Analytical chemistry|electroanalytical chemistry]] and recipient of the Nobel Prize.<ref name=\"science1\" />\n*[[Josef Hlavka]] (15 February 1831 \u2013 11 March 1908), was a Czech architect, builder, philanthropist and founder of the oldest Czech foundation for sciences and arts.\n* [[Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd]] (1936\u20132012), scientist and chemist, in 2009 was involved in creation of the most effective drug in the treatment of AIDS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eu2009.cz/en/czech-presidency/presidency-faces/faces-of-the-presidency-3642/ |title=Faces of the Presidency |accessdate=8 January 2009 |work= eu2009.cz|publisher=EU2009.cz |date=}}</ref>\n* [[Jakub Husn\u00edk]] (1837\u20131916), improved the process of [[photolithography]].\n* [[Jan Jansk\u00fd]] (1873\u20131921), serologist and neurologist, discovered the [[ABO blood groups]].\n* [[Georg Joseph Kamel]] (1661\u20131706), Czech Jesuit, pharmacist and naturalist known for producing first comprehensive accounts of the Philippine flora;  genus of flowering plants Camellia is named in his honour.\n* [[Karel Kl\u00ed\u010d]] (1841\u20131926), painter and photographer, inventor of the [[photogravure]].\n* [[Franti\u0161ek K\u0159i\u017e\u00edk]] (1847\u20131941), electrical engineer, inventor of the [[arc lamp]].\n* [[Julius Vincenz von Krombholz]] (1782\u20131843), biologist, founder of the great tradition of Czech mycology.* [[Johann Josef Loschmidt]] (1821\u20131895), chemist, performed ground-breaking work in crystal forms.\n* [[Ernst Mach]] (1838\u20131916) physicist and critic of Newton's theories of space and time, foreshadowing Einstein's theory of relativity.\n* [[Jan Marek Marci]] (1595\u20131667), mathematician, physicist and imperial physician, one of the founders of [[spectroscopy]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burns|first1=Thorburn|editor1-last=Burgess|editor1-first=C.|editor2-last=Mielenz|editor2-first=K.

After the [[Bohemian Reformation]], most Czechs became [[Hussites|followers]] of [[Jan Hus]], [[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd]] and other regional [[Protestant Reformers]]. [[Taborites]] and [[Utraquists]] were major [[Hussite]] groups. During the [[Hussite Wars]], Utraquists sided with the Catholic Church. Following the joint Utraquist\u2014Catholic victory, Utraquism was accepted as a distinct form of Christianity to be practiced in [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] by the [[Catholic Church]] while all remaining Hussite groups were prohibited. After the [[Reformation]], some Bohemians went with the [[Lutheranism|teachings of Martin Luther]], especially [[Sudeten Germans]]. In the wake of the Reformation, Utraquist Hussites took a renewed increasingly [[anti-Catholic]] stance, while some of the defeated Hussite factions (notably Taborites) were revived. After the [[Habsburgs]] regained control of Bohemia, the whole population was forcibly converted to Catholicism\u2014even the Utraquist Hussites. Going forward, Czechs have become more wary and pessimistic of religion as such. A long history of resistance to the Catholic Church followed. It suffered a schism with the neo-Hussite [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] in 1920, lost the bulk of its adherents during the Communist era and continues to lose in the modern, ongoing [[secularization]].

He is today the most famous Czech painter.{{cn|date=April 2018}} He is mainly known for [[Art Nouveau]] posters and his cycle of 20 large canvases named [[the Slav Epic]], which depicts the history of Czechs and other [[Slavs]]. \n\n{{As of|2012}}, [[the Slav Epic]] can be seen in the Veletr\u017en\u00ed Palace of the [[National Gallery in Prague]], which manages the largest collection of art in the Czech Republic.

In the Czech lands mainly expressionist and cubist: [[Josef \u010capek]], [[Emil Filla]], [[Bohumil Kubi\u0161ta]], [[Jan Zrzav\u00fd]]. Surrealism emerged particularly in the work of [[Toyen]], [[Josef \u0160\u00edma]] and [[Karel Teige]]. In the world, however, he pushed mainly [[Franti\u0161ek Kupka]], a pioneer of abstract painting. As illustrators and cartoonists in the first half of the 20th century gained fame [[Josef Lada]], [[Zden\u011bk Burian]] or [[Emil Orl\u00edk]].

Since the Middle Ages, the Czech lands have been using the same architectural styles as most of [[Western Europe|Western]] and Central Europe. The oldest still standing churches were built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] ([[St. George's Basilica, Prague|St. George's Basilica]], [[St. Procopius Basilica in T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d]]). During the 13th century it was replaced by the [[Czech Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] ([[Charles Bridge]], [[Bethlehem Chapel]], [[Old New Synagogue]], [[Sedlec Ossuary]], [[Old Town Hall (Prague)|Old Town Hall]] with [[Prague astronomical clock]], [[Church of Our Lady before T\u00fdn]]). In the 14th century Emperor Charles IV invited to his court in Prague talented architects from France and Germany, [[Matthias of Arras]] and [[Peter Parler]] ([[Karl\u0161tejn]], [[St. Vitus Cathedral]], [[St. Barbara's Church, Kutn\u00e1 Hora|St. Barbara's Church in Kutn\u00e1 Hora]]). During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by the king and aristocracy, as well as many monasteries ([[Strahov Monastery]], [[\u0160pilberk]], [[K\u0159ivokl\u00e1t Castle]], [[Vy\u0161\u0161\u00ed Brod Monastery]]). During the [[Hussite wars]], many of them were damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]] penetrated the Bohemian Crown in the late 15th century when the older Gothic style started to be slowly mixed with Renaissance elements (architects [[Mat\u011bj Rejsek]], [[Benedikt Rejt]] and their [[Powder Tower]]). An outstanding example of the pure Renaissance architecture in Bohemia is the [[Royal Summer Palace]], which was situated in a newly established garden of [[Prague Castle]]. Evidence of the general reception of the Renaissance in Bohemia, involving a massive influx of Italian architects, can be found in spacious ch\u00e2teaux with elegant arcade courtyards and geometrically arranged gardens ([[Litomy\u0161l Castle]], [[Hlubok\u00e1 Castle]]).<ref name=architecture>{{cite web|title=History of Czech Architecture|url=http://eu2009.cz/en/czech-republic/architecture-and-design/history/history-of-czech-architecture-2461/|website=eu2009.cz|publisher=Czech Presidency of the European Union|accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref> Emphasis was placed on comfort, and buildings that were built for entertainment purposes also appeared.<ref name=czecharchitecture>{{cite web|title=The History of Architecture|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/66608-the-history-of-architecture|website=www.czech.cz|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, the Baroque style spread throughout the Crown of Bohemia. Very outstanding are the architectural projects of the Czech nobleman and imperial generalissimo [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] from the 1620s ([[Wallenstein Palace]]). His architects Andrea Spezza and [[Giovanni de Galliano Pieroni|Giovanni Pieroni]] reflected the most recent Italian production and were very innovative at the same time. [[Czech Baroque architecture]] is considered to be a unique part of the European cultural heritage thanks to its extensiveness and extraordinariness ([[Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e Castle]], [[Holy Trinity Column in Olomouc]], [[St. Nicholas Church (Mal\u00e1 Strana)|St. Nicholas Church at Mal\u00e1 Strana]], [[Karlova Koruna Chateau]]). In the first third of the 18th century the Bohemian lands were one of the leading artistic centers of the Baroque style. In Bohemia there was completed the development of the Radical Baroque style created in Italy by [[Francesco Borromini]] and [[Guarino Guarini]] in a very original way.<ref name=kotalik>{{cite book|last=Kotal\u00edk|first=Ji\u0159\u00ed|title=Architektura barokn\u00ed|year=2002|publisher=Spr\u00e1va Pra\u017esk\u00e9ho hradu a DaDa|location=Praha|isbn=80-86161-38-2|page=13|edition=Deset stolet\u00ed architektury|language=Czech}}</ref> Leading architects of the Bohemian Baroque were [[Jean Baptiste Mathey|Jean-Baptiste Mathey]], [[Franti\u0161ek Maxmili\u00e1n Ka\u0148ka]], [[Christoph Dientzenhofer]], and his son [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]].\n\nIn the 18th century Bohemia produced an architectural peculiarity \u2013 the ''Baroque Gothic style'', a synthesis of the Gothic and Baroque styles. This was not a simple return to Gothic details, but rather an original Baroque transformation. The main representative and originator of this style was [[Jan Bla\u017eej Santini-Aichel]], who used this style in renovating medieval monastic buildings or in [[Pilgrimage Church of Saint John of Nepomuk]].<ref name=architecture />\n\nDuring the 19th century, the [[Revival architecture|revival architectural styles]] were very popular in the Bohemian monarchy. Many churches were restored to their presumed medieval appearance and there were constructed many new buildings in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]], [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] and [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] styles ([[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]], [[Lednice\u2013Valtice Cultural Landscape]], [[Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, Brno|Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in Brno]]). At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the new art style appeared in the Czech lands \u2013 [[Art Nouveau]]. The best-known representatives of Czech Art Nouveau architecture were [[Osvald Pol\u00edvka]], who designed the [[Municipal House]] in Prague, [[Josef Fanta]], the architect of the [[Praha hlavn\u00ed n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed|Prague Main Railway Station]], [[Jan Letzel]], [[Josef Hoffmann]] and [[Jan Kot\u011bra]].\n\nBohemia contributed an unusual style to the world's architectural heritage when Czech architects attempted to transpose the [[Cubism]] of painting and sculpture into architecture ([[House of the Black Madonna]]). During the first years of the independent Czechoslovakia (after 1918), a specifically Czech architectural style, called ''Rondo-Cubism'', came into existence. Together with the pre-war [[Cubism#Czech Cubist architecture|Czech Cubist architecture]] it is unparalleled elsewhere in the world. The first Czechoslovak president [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk|T. G. Masaryk]] invited the prominent [[Slovenia|Slovene]] architect [[Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik]] to Prague, where he modernized the [[Prague Castle|Castle]] and built some other buildings ([[Church of the Most Sacred Heart of Our Lord]]).\n\nBetween World Wars I and II, [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]], with its sober, progressive forms, took over as the main architectural style in the newly established Czechoslovak Republic. In the city of Brno, one of the most impressive functionalist works has been preserved \u2013 [[Villa Tugendhat]], designed by the architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].<ref name=architecture /> The most significant Czech architects of this era were [[Adolf Loos]], [[Pavel Jan\u00e1k]] and [[Josef Go\u010d\u00e1r]].\n\nAfter World War II and the Communist coup in 1948, art in Czechoslovakia became strongly Soviet influenced. [[Hotel International Prague|Hotel International]] in Prague is a brilliant example of the so-called [[Socialist realism]], the Stalinistic art style of the 1950s. The Czechoslovak avant-garde artistic movement known as the ''[[Brussels style]]'' (named after the Brussels World's Fair [[Expo 58]]) became popular in the time of political liberalization of Czechoslovakia in the 1960s. [[Brutalism]] dominated in the 70s and 80s ([[Kotva Department Store]]).\n\nEven today, the Czech Republic is not shying away from the most modern trends of international architecture. This fact is attested to by a number of projects by world-renowned architects ([[Frank Gehry]] and his [[Dancing House]], [[Jean Nouvel]], [[Ricardo Bofill]], and [[John Pawson]]). There are also contemporary Czech architects whose works can be found all over the world ([[Vlado Miluni\u0107]], [[Eva Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1]], [[Jan Kaplick\u00fd]]).<ref name=architecture />\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Main|Czech literature}}\n[[File:Kafka portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Kafka]]]]\n[[File:Jaroslav Seifert 1981 foto Hana Hamplov\u00e1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Jaroslav Seifert]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]]]\n\nIn a strict sense, [[Czech literature]] is the literature written in the [[Czech language]]. A more liberal definition incorporates all literary works written in the Czech lands regardless of language. The literature from the area of today's Czech Republic was mostly written in Czech, but also in [[Latin]] and German or even [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Thus [[Franz Kafka]], who\u2014while bilingual in Czech and German{{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 29}}{{sfn|Sayer|1996|pp = 164\u2013210}}\u2014wrote his works (''[[The Trial]]'', ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'') in German, during the era of Austrian rule, can represent the [[Czech literature|Czech]], German or [[Austrian literature]] depending on the point of view.\n\nInfluential Czech authors who wrote in Latin include [[Cosmas of Prague]] (\u2020 1125), [[Martin of Opava]] (\u2020 1278), [[Peter of Zittau]] (\u2020 1339), [[Jan Hus|John Hus]] (\u2020 1415), [[Bohuslav Hasi\u0161tejnsk\u00fd z Lobkovic]] (1461\u20131510), [[Jan Dubravius]] (1486\u20131553), [[Tade\u00e1\u0161 H\u00e1jek]] (1525\u20131600), [[Johannes Vodnianus Campanus]] (1572\u20131622), [[John Amos Comenius]] (1592\u20131670), and [[Bohuslav Balb\u00edn]] (1621\u20131688).\n\nIn the second half of the 13th century, the royal court in Prague became one of the centers of the German [[Minnesang]] and courtly literature ([[Reinmar von Zweter]], [[Heinrich von Freiberg]], Ulrich von Etzenbach, [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]]). The most famous Czech medieval German-language work is the ''Ploughman of Bohemia'' (''[[Der Ackermann aus B\u00f6hmen]]''), written around 1401 by [[Johannes von Tepl]]. The heyday of Czech German-language literature can be seen in the first half of the 20th century, which is represented by the well-known names of [[Franz Kafka]], [[Max Brod]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], [[Egon Kisch|Egon Erwin Kisch]], and others.\n\n[[Bible translations into Czech|Bible translations]] played an important role in the development of Czech literature and the standard Czech language. The oldest Czech translation of the [[Psalms]] originated in the late 13th century and the first complete Czech translation of the Bible was finished around 1360. The first complete printed Czech Bible was published in 1488 ([[Prague Bible]]). The first complete Czech Bible translation from the original languages was published between 1579 and 1593 and is known as the [[Bible of Kralice]]. The [[Codex Gigas]] from the 12th century is the largest extant medieval manuscript in the world.\n\nCzech-language literature can be divided into several periods: the Middle Ages ([[Chronicle of Dalimil]]); the Hussite period ([[Tom\u00e1\u0161 \u0160t\u00edtn\u00fd ze \u0160t\u00edtn\u00e9ho]], [[Jan Hus]], [[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd]]); the [[Renaissance humanism]] ([[Henry the Younger of Pod\u011bbrady]], [[Luke of Prague]], [[Wenceslaus Hajek]], [[Jan Blahoslav]], [[Daniel Adam z Veleslav\u00edna]]); the Baroque period ([[John Amos Comenius]], [[Adam V\u00e1clav Michna z Otradovic]], [[Bed\u0159ich Bridel]], [[Jan Franti\u0161ek Beckovsk\u00fd]]); the Enlightenment and Czech reawakening in the first half of the 19th century ([[V\u00e1clav Mat\u011bj Kramerius]], [[Karel Hynek M\u00e1cha]], [[Karel Jarom\u00edr Erben]], [[Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek Borovsk\u00fd]], [[Bo\u017eena N\u011bmcov\u00e1]], [[J\u00e1n Koll\u00e1r]], [[Josef Kajet\u00e1n Tyl]]), modern literature in second half of the 19th century ([[Jan Neruda]], [[Alois Jir\u00e1sek]], [[Viktor Dyk]], [[Jaroslav Vrchlick\u00fd]], [[Julius Zeyer]], [[Svatopluk \u010cech]]); the avant-garde of the interwar period ([[Karel \u010capek]], [[Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek]], [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval]], [[Jaroslav Seifert]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Wolker]], [[Vladim\u00edr Holan]]); the years under Communism and the Prague Spring ([[Josef \u0160kvoreck\u00fd]], [[Bohumil Hrabal]], [[Milan Kundera]], [[Arno\u0161t Lustig]], [[V\u00e1clav Havel]], [[Pavel Kohout]], [[Ivan Kl\u00edma]]); and the literature of the post-Communist Czech Republic ([[Ivan Martin Jirous]], [[Michal Viewegh]], [[J\u00e1chym Topol]], [[Patrik Ou\u0159edn\u00edk]], [[Kate\u0159ina Tu\u010dkov\u00e1]]).\n\nNoted journalists include [[Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk (journalist)|Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk]], [[Milena Jesensk\u00e1]], and [[Ferdinand Peroutka]].\n\n[[Jaroslav Seifert]] was the only Czech writer awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

On both of these occasions, in the early 19th century and then again in the 1960s, the Czechs used their cultural and literary effort to strive for political freedom, establishing a confident, politically aware nation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n=== Music ===\n[[File:Dvorak.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]]]\n[[File:Dvorak Bedrich Smetana and friends in 1865.jpg|thumb|[[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]] on the painting of [[Franti\u0161ek Dvo\u0159\u00e1k (painter)|Franti\u0161ek Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]]]\n{{Main|Music of the Czech Lands|Moravian traditional music}}\n\nThe musical tradition of the Czech lands arose from first church hymns, whose first evidence is suggested at the break of 10th and 11th century.

Original Czech cultural phenomenon came into being at the end of the 1950s.

Its economic status was formalized in membership of [[Comecon]] from 1949 and its defense status in the [[Warsaw Pact]] of May 1955. A period of political liberalization in 1968, known as the [[Prague Spring]], was forcibly ended when the Soviet Union, assisted by several other Warsaw Pact countries, [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invaded]]. In 1989, as [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] governments and [[communism]] were [[Revolutions of 1989|ending]] all over Europe, Czechoslovaks peacefully deposed their government in the [[Velvet Revolution]]; state price controls were removed after a period of preparation. In 1993, Czechoslovakia split into the two sovereign states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\n==Characteristics==\n;Form of state\n*1918\u20131938: A [[democratic republic]].\n*1938\u20131939: After annexation of [[Sudetenland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938, the region gradually turned into a state with loosened connections among the Czech, Slovak, and Ruthenian parts. A large strip of southern Slovakia and [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] was annexed by Hungary, and the [[Teschen conflict|Zaolzie region]] was annexed by Poland.\n*1939\u20131945: The region was split into the '''[[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]''' and the '''[[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak Republic]]'''. A [[Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile|government-in-exile]] continued to exist in London, supported by the United Kingdom, United States and its Allies; after the German invasion of Russia, it was also recognised by the [[Soviet Union]]. Czechoslovakia adhered to the [[Declaration by United Nations]] and was a founding member of the United Nations.\n*1946\u20131948: The country was governed by a coalition government with [[Communism|communist]] ministers, including the prime minister and the minister of interior. [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] was ceded to the Soviet Union.\n*1948\u20131989: The country became a [[socialist state]] under Soviet domination with a centrally [[planned economy]]. In 1960, the country officially became a socialist republic, the '''[[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]]'''. It was a satellite state of the [[Soviet Union]].\n*1989\u20131990: The [[Federation|federal]] republic consisted of the '''[[Czech Socialist Republic]]''' and the '''[[Slovak Socialist Republic]]'''.\n*1990\u20131992: Following the [[Velvet Revolution]], the state was renamed the '''[[Czech and Slovak Federal Republic]]''', consisting of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.\n\n;Neighbours\n*Austria 1918\u20131938, 1945\u20131992\n*Germany (Both predecessors, West Germany and East Germany, were neighbors between 1949 and 1990.)\n*[[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]]\n*[[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]]\n*[[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] 1918\u20131938\n*[[Soviet Union]] 1945\u20131991\n**Ukraine 1945\u20131992 (independent from 1991)\n\n;Topography\nThe country was of generally irregular terrain.

He was succeeded by his close ally, [[Edvard Bene\u0161]] (1884\u20131948).\n\nThe roots of Czech nationalism go back to the 19th century, when philologists and educators, influenced by [[Romanticism]], promoted the [[Czech language]] and pride in the [[Czech people]]. Nationalism became a mass movement in the second half of the 19th century. Taking advantage of the limited opportunities for participation in political life under Austrian rule, Czech leaders such as historian [[Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd]] (1798\u20131876) founded many patriotic, self-help organizations which provided a chance for many of their compatriots to participate in communal life prior to independence. Palack\u00fd supported [[Austro-Slavism]] and worked for a reorganized and federal Austrian Empire, which would protect the Slavic speaking peoples of Central Europe against Russian and German threats.\n\nAn advocate of democratic reform and Czech autonomy within Austria-Hungary, Masaryk was elected twice to the ''[[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]]'' (Austrian Parliament), first from 1891 to 1893 for the [[Young Czech Party]], and again from 1907 to 1914 for the [[Czech Realist Party]], which he had founded in 1889 with [[Karel Kram\u00e1\u0159]] and [[Josef Kaizl]].\n\nDuring World War I small numbers of Czechs, the [[Czechoslovak Legions]], fought with the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in France and Italy, while large numbers deserted to Russia in exchange for its support for the independence of Czechoslovakia from the Austrian Empire. With the outbreak of World War I, Masaryk began working for Czech independence in a union with Slovakia. With Edvard Bene\u0161 and [[Milan Rastislav \u0160tef\u00e1nik]], Masaryk visited several Western countries and won support from influential publicists.<ref>Z. A. B. Zeman, ''The Masaryks: The Making of Czechoslovakia'' (1976)</ref>\n\n[[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], under Austrian rule, were Czech-speaking industrial centres, while Slovakia, which was part of the [[Transleithania|Kingdom of Hungary]], was an undeveloped agrarian region. Conditions were much better for the development of a mass national movement in the Czech lands than in Slovakia. Nevertheless, the two regions united and created a new nation.\n\n===First Czechoslovak Republic===\n{{main|First Czechoslovak Republic}}\n\n====Formation====\n[[File:Czechoslovakia01.png|thumb|Czechoslovakia in 1928]]\nThe [[Bohemian Kingdom]] ceased to exist in 1918 when it was incorporated into Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia was founded in October 1918, as one of the successor states of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of [[World War I]] and as part of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. It consisted of the present day territories of [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], Slovakia and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]. Its territory included some of the most industrialized regions of the former Austria-Hungary.\n\n==== Ethnicity ====\n{{see also|Ethnic minorities in Czechoslovakia}}\n[[File:Czechoslovakia 1930 linguistic map - created 2008-10-30.svg|thumb|Linguistic map of Czechoslovakia in 1930]]\n\nThe new country was a multi-ethnic state.

Once a unified Czechoslovakia was restored after World War II (after the country had been divided during the war), the conflict between the [[Czechs]] and the [[Slovaks]] surfaced again. The governments of Czechoslovakia and other eastern European nations deported ethnic Germans to the West, reducing the presence of minorities in the nation.

Of all the new states established in central Europe after 1918, only Czechoslovakia preserved a democratic government until the war broke out. Thus, despite regional disparities, its level of development was much higher than that of neighboring states.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The population was generally literate, and contained fewer alienated groups. The influence of these conditions was augmented by the political values of Czechoslovakia's leaders and the policies they adopted. Under [[Tomas Masaryk]], Czech and Slovak politicians promoted progressive social and economic conditions that served to defuse discontent.\n\nForeign minister Bene\u0161 became the prime architect of the Czechoslovak-Romanian-Yugoslav alliance (the \"[[Little Entente]]\", 1921\u201338) directed against Hungarian attempts to reclaim lost areas. Bene\u0161 worked closely with France. Far more dangerous was the German element, which after 1933 became allied with the Nazis in Germany. The increasing feeling of inferiority among the Slovaks,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} who were hostile to the more numerous Czechs, weakened the country in the late 1930s. Many Slovaks supported an extreme nationalist movement and welcomed the puppet Slovak state set up under Hitler's control in 1939.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nAfter 1933, Czechoslovakia remained the only democracy in central and eastern Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook on Policing in Central and Eastern Europe|last=edited by Gorazd Mesko, Charles B.

On 29 September 1938, Britain and France ceded control in the [[Appeasement]] at the [[Munich Conference]]; France ignored the military alliance it had with Czechoslovakia. During October 1938, [[Nazi Germany]] occupied and annexed the Sudetenland border region, effectively crippling Czechoslovak defences.\n\nOn 15 March 1939, the remainder (\"rump\") of Czechoslovakia was invaded and divided into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the puppet [[Slovak State]].\n\nMuch of Slovakia and all of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] were annexed by Hungary. Poland [[Teschen conflict|occupied]] Zaolzie, an area whose population was majority Polish, in October 1938.\n\nThe eventual goal of the German state under Nazi leadership was to eradicate Czech nationality through assimilation, deportation, and extermination of the Czech intelligentsia; the intellectual elites and middle class made up a considerable number of the 200,000 people who passed through concentration camps and the 250,000 who died during German occupation.<ref>''Universities in the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries'' (1800\u20131945), Walter R\u00fcegg Cambridge University Press (28 October 2004), page 353</ref> Under [[Generalplan Ost]], it was assumed that around 50% Czechs would be fit for [[Germanization]]. The Czech intellectual elites were to be removed not only from Czech territories but from Europe completely.

On 4 June 1942 Heydrich died after being wounded by an assassin in [[Operation Anthropoid]]. Heydrich's successor, Colonel General [[Kurt Daluege]], ordered mass arrests and executions and the destruction of the villages of [[Lidice]] and [[Le\u017e\u00e1ky]]. In 1943 the German war effort was accelerated. Under the authority of [[Karl Hermann Frank]], German minister of state for Bohemia and Moravia, some 350,000 Czech laborers were dispatched to the Reich. Within the protectorate, all non-war-related industry was prohibited. Most of the Czech population obeyed quiescently up until the final months preceding the end of the war, while thousands were involved in the [[resistance movement]].\n\nFor the Czechs of the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia, [[Occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]] was a period of brutal oppression. Czech losses resulting from political persecution and deaths in concentration camps totaled between 36,000 and 55,000. The Jewish population of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] (118,000 according to the 1930 census) was virtually annihilated. Many Jews emigrated after 1939; more than 70,000 were killed; 8,000 survived at Terez\u00edn. Several thousand Jews managed to live in freedom or in hiding throughout the occupation.\n\nDespite the estimated 136,000 deaths at the hands of the Nazi regime, the population in the Reichsprotektorate saw a net increase during the war years of approximately 250,000 in line with an increased birth rate.<ref>\"Vaclav Havel \u2013 A Political Tragedy in 6 Acts\" by John Keane, published 2000, page 54</ref>\n\nOn 3 May 1945, the third US Army of General Patton entered Pilsen from the south west.

The [[Bene\u0161 decrees]] were promulgated concerning ethnic Germans (see [[Potsdam Agreement]]) and ethnic Hungarians. Under the decrees, [[citizenship]] was abrogated for people of German and Hungarian [[ethnic origin]] who had accepted German or Hungarian citizenship during the occupations. In 1948, this provision was cancelled for the Hungarians, but only partially for the Germans. The government then confiscated the property of the Germans and [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled about 90% of the ethnic German population]], over 2 million people. Those who remained were [[Collective accountability|collectively accused]] of supporting the Nazis after the [[Munich Agreement]], as 97.32% of Sudeten Germans had voted for the [[NSDAP]] in the December 1938 elections. Almost every decree explicitly stated that the sanctions did not apply to antifascists. Some 250,000 Germans, many married to Czechs, some antifascists, and also those required for the post-war reconstruction of the country, remained in Czechoslovakia.

In the 1946 parliamentary election, the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] was the winner in the [[Czech lands]], and the [[Democratic Party (Slovakia)|Democratic Party]] won in Slovakia. In February 1948 the Communists seized power. Although they would maintain the fiction of political pluralism through the existence of the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]], except for a short period in the late 1960s (the [[Prague Spring]]) the country had no [[liberal democracy]]. Since citizens lacked significant electoral methods of registering protest against government policies, periodically there were street protests that became violent. For example, there were riots in the town of Plze\u0148 in 1953, reflecting economic discontent. Police and army units put down the rebellion, and hundreds were injured but no one was killed. While its economy remained more advanced than those of its neighbors in Eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia grew increasingly economically weak relative to Western Europe.\n\nThe currency reform of 1953 caused dissatisfaction among Czechoslovakian laborers.  Prior to World War II, the Czech purchasing power surpassed that of the Soviet Union by 115-144%.  This disparity was noted after Czechoslovakia came under the [[Soviet Bloc|Soviet bloc]]. To equalize the wage rate, Czechoslovakians had to turn in their old money for new at a decreased value. This lowered the real value of wages by about 11%.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Mares|first=Vaclav|date=June 1954|title=Czechoslovakia under Communism|url=|journal=Current History|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> The banks also confiscated savings and bank deposits to control the amount of money in circulation.  The economy continued to suffer as production achievements of bituminous coal was less than anticipated.  Bituminous coal powered 85% of Czechoslovakia\u2019s economy.  Because of low production, coal was utilized in industry only.  Pre-war years, consumers used both coal and lignite for fuel, however due to low production, coal was for industrial use only which meant the consumer was only able to utilize lignite.  In 1929, a typical family of four consumed approximately 2.34 tons of lignite but, by 1953, this same family unit was only allowed to use 1.6-1.8 tons per year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Czechoslovakia.png|thumb|Czechoslovakia after 1969]]\n\nIn 1968, when the reformer [[Alexander Dub\u010dek]] was appointed to the key post of First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, there was a brief period of liberalization known as the [[Prague Spring]].

Meanwhile, one plank of the reform program had been carried out: in 1968-69, Czechoslovakia was turned into a federation of the [[Czech Socialist Republic]] and [[Slovak Socialist Republic]]. The theory was that under the federation, social and economic inequities between the Czech and Slovak halves of the state would be largely eliminated. A number of ministries, such as education, now became two formally equal bodies in the two formally equal republics. However, the centralised political control by the Czechoslovak Communist Party severely limited the effects of federalization.\n\nThe 1970s saw the rise of the dissident movement in Czechoslovakia, represented among others by [[V\u00e1clav Havel]]. The movement sought greater political participation and expression in the face of official disapproval, manifested in limitations on work activities, which went as far as a ban on professional employment, the refusal of higher education for the dissidents' children, police harassment and prison.\n\n===After 1989===\n{{Main|History of Czechoslovakia (1989\u20131992)}}\n[[File:Foundation of the Visegr\u00e1d Group.tiff|thumb|The [[Visegr\u00e1d Group]] signing ceremony in February 1991]]\n\nIn 1989, the [[Velvet Revolution]] restored democracy.

The state was based on strong economy, manufacturing cars ([[\u0160koda Auto|\u0160koda]], [[Tatra (company)|Tatra]]), trams, aircraft ([[Aero Vodochody|Aero]], [[Avia]]), ships, ship engines ([[\u0160koda Works|\u0160koda]]), canons, shoes ([[Bata Shoes|Ba\u0165a]]), turbines, guns ([[Zbrojovka Brno]]). It was the industrial workshop for Austro-Hungarian empire. The Slovak lands were more in agriculture.\n\nAfter World War II, the economy was centrally planned, with command links controlled by the communist party, similarly to the [[Soviet Union]]. The large metallurgical industry was dependent on imports of iron and non-ferrous ores.\n*Industry: Extractive industry and manufacturing dominated the sector, including machinery, chemicals, food processing, metallurgy, and textiles. The sector was wasteful in its use of energy, materials, and labor and was slow to upgrade technology, but the country was a major supplier of high-quality machinery, instruments, electronics, aircraft, airplane engines and arms to other socialist countries.\n*Agriculture: Agriculture was a minor sector, but collectivized farms of large acreage and relatively efficient mode of production enabled the country to be relatively self-sufficient in food supply. The country depended on imports of grains (mainly for livestock feed) in years of adverse weather. Meat production was constrained by shortage of feed, but the country still recorded high per capita consumption of meat.\n*Foreign trade: Exports were estimated at US$17.8 billion in 1985. Exports were machinery (55%), fuel and materials (14%), and manufactured consumer goods (16%). Imports stood at estimated US$17.9 billion in 1985, including fuel and materials (41%), machinery (33%), and agricultural and forestry products (12%). In 1986, about 80% of foreign trade was with other socialist countries.\n*Exchange rate: Official, or commercial, rate was crowns (K\u010ds) 5.4 per US$1 in 1987. Tourist, or non-commercial, rate was K\u010ds 10.5 per US$1. Neither rate reflected purchasing power. The exchange rate on the [[black market]] was around K\u010ds 30 per US$1, which became the official rate once the currency became convertible in the early 1990s.\n*Fiscal year: Calendar year.\n*Fiscal policy: The state was the exclusive owner of means of production in most cases. Revenue from state enterprises was the primary source of revenues followed by [[turnover tax]]. The government spent heavily on social programs, subsidies, and investment. Budget was usually balanced or left small surplus.\n\n==Resource base==\n{{Main|Resource base of Communist Czechoslovakia}}\n\nAfter World War II, the country was short of energy, relying on imported [[crude oil]] and natural gas from Soviet Union, domestic [[Lignite|brown coal]], and [[nuclear power|nuclear]] and [[hydroelectric energy]]. Energy constraints were a major factor in the 1980s.\n\n==Transport and communications==\nSlightly after the foundation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, there was a lack of needful infrastructure in many areas \u2013 paved roads, railways, bridges etc. Massive improvement in the following years enabled Czechoslovakia to develop its industry. Prague's civil airport in Ruzyn\u011b became one of the most modern terminals in the world, when it was finished in 1937.

There was a highly developed system of apprenticeship training and vocational schools supplemented general secondary schools and institutions of higher education.\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Religion in Czechoslovakia}}\nIn 1991: [[Roman Catholics]] 46%, [[Lutheranism|Evangelical Lutheran]] 5.3%, [[Atheist]] 30%, n/a 17%, but there were huge differences in religious practices between the two constituent republics; see Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\n==Health, social welfare and housing==\n{{Main|Health and social welfare in Communist Czechoslovakia}}\n\nAfter World War II, [[Universal healthcare|free health care]] was available to all citizens. National health planning emphasised preventive medicine; factory and local health care centres supplemented hospitals and other inpatient institutions. There was substantial improvement in rural health care during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n==Mass media==\n{{Main|Mass media in Communist Czechoslovakia}}\n\nDuring the era between the World Wars, Czechoslovak democracy and liberalism facilitated conditions for free publication. The most significant daily newspapers in these times were Lidov\u00e9 noviny, N\u00e1rodn\u00ed listy, \u010cesk\u00fd den\u00edk and \u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 republika.\n\nDuring Communist rule, the mass media in Czechoslovakia were controlled by the Communist Party. Private ownership of any publication or agency of the mass media was generally forbidden, although churches and other organizations published small periodicals and newspapers. Even with this information monopoly in the hands of organizations under KS\u010c control, all publications were [[Censorship|reviewed]] by the government's Office for Press and Information.\n\n==Sports==\n{{see also|Czechoslovakia at the Olympics}}\nThe [[Czechoslovakia national football team]] was a consistent performer on the international scene, with eight appearances in the [[FIFA World Cup]] Finals, finishing in second place in [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]]. The team also won the [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Football Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 1976|1976]], came in third in [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980]] and won the [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic gold]] in [[Football at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]].\n\nWell-known football players such as [[Pavel Nedv\u011bd]], [[Anton\u00edn Panenka]], [[Milan Baro\u0161]], [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Rosick\u00fd]], [[Vladim\u00edr \u0160micer]] or [[Petr \u010cech]] were all born in Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe [[International Olympic Committee]] code for Czechoslovakia is TCH, which is still used in historical listings of results.\n\nThe [[Czechoslovak national ice hockey team]] won many medals from the world championships and Olympic Games.

Its aim is to understand the nature of '''computation''' and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies. All studies related to mathematical, logic and formal concepts and methods could be considered as theoretical computer science, provided that the motivation is clearly drawn from the field of '''computing'''.\n\n====Data structures and algorithms====\nData structures and algorithms is the study of commonly used computational methods and their computational efficiency.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; text-align:center; margin:auto;\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|-\n| {{math|''O''(''n''<sup>2</sup>)}}\n| [[File:Sorting quicksort anim.gif|96px]]\n| [[File:Singly linked list.png|96px]]\n| [[File:TSP Deutschland 3.png|96px]]\n| [[File:SimplexRangeSearching.svg|96px]]\n|-\n| [[Analysis of algorithms]]\n| [[Algorithm]]s\n| [[Data structures]]\n| [[Combinatorial optimization]]\n| [[Computational geometry]]\n|}\n\n====Theory of computation====\n{{main|Theory of computation}}\nAccording to [[Peter J.

In an effort to answer the first question, [[computability theory]] examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical [[models of computation]].

Codes are used for [[data compression]], [[cryptography]], [[error detection and correction]], and more recently also for [[Linear network coding|network coding]]. Codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable [[data transmission]] methods.\n\n====Programming language theory====\n{{main|Programming language theory}}\nProgramming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of [[programming language]]s and their individual [[Programming language#Elements|features]].

The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design. They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required. However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and [[life-critical system]]s, where safety or [[computer security|security]] is of utmost importance. Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of [[theoretical computer science]] fundamentals, in particular [[logic in computer science|logic]] calculi, [[formal language]]s, [[automata theory]], and [[program semantics]], but also [[type systems]] and [[algebraic data types]] to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.\n\n===Computer systems===\n\n====Computer architecture and computer engineering====\n{{main|Computer architecture|Computer engineering}}\nComputer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system.

A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including [[Petri net]]s, [[Process calculus|process calculi]] and the [[Parallel random-access machine|Parallel Random Access Machine]] model. A distributed system extends the idea of concurrency onto multiple computers connected through a network.

Cryptography is the practice and study of hiding (encryption) and therefore deciphering (decryption) information. Modern cryptography is largely related to computer science, for many encryption and decryption algorithms are based on their computational complexity.\n\n====Databases====\n{{main|Database}}\n{{Missing information|a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.|date=September 2018}}\nA database is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily.

AI is associated in the popular mind with [[Robotics|robotic development]], but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of [[software development]], which require computational understanding. The starting-point in the late 1940s was [[Alan Turing]]'s question \"Can computers think?\", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the [[Turing test]] is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; text-align:center; margin:auto;\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|-\n| [[File:Nicolas P.

Therefore, different programming paradigms exist. A few basic programming paradigms used throughout computer science are:\n\n* [[Object-oriented programming|Object-Oriented Programming]]: \"Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus Object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.\"\n* [[Imperative programming|Imperative Programming]]: \"In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.\"<ref>{{Citation|title=Imperative programming|date=2018-10-07|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Imperative_programming&oldid=862960283|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref>\n* [[Functional programming|Functional Programming]]: \"In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm\u2014a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs\u2014that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.\"<ref>{{Citation|title=Functional programming|date=2018-10-06|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Functional_programming&oldid=862736578|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref>\n* [[Procedural programming|Procedural Programming]]: \"Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.

Most young Earth creationists believe that the universe has a similar age as the Earth. A few assign a much older age to the universe than to Earth. [[Creationist cosmologies]] give the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other young Earth time frames. Other young Earth creationists believe that the Earth and the universe were created with the appearance of age, so that the world appears to be much older than it is, and that this appearance is what gives the geological findings and other methods of dating the Earth and the universe their much longer [[timeline]]s.\n\nThe Christian organizations [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) and the [[Creation Research Society]] (CRS) both promote young Earth creationism in the US. Another organization with similar views, [[Answers in Genesis]] (AiG)\u2014based in both the US and the [[United Kingdom]]\u2014has opened the [[Creation Museum]] in [[Petersburg, Boone County, Kentucky|Petersburg, Kentucky]], to promote young Earth creationism. [[Creation Ministries International]] promotes young Earth views in Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, the US, and the UK. Among [[Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], the [[List of Catholic creationist organisations|Kolbe Center]] for the Study of Creation promotes similar ideas. In 2007, Ken Ham founded the [[Creation Museum]] and [[Ark Encounter]] in northern [[Kentucky]].\n\n===Old Earth creationism===\n{{Main|Old Earth creationism}}\nOld Earth creationism holds that the physical universe was created by God, but that the creation event described in the Book of Genesis is to be taken figuratively. This group generally believes that the [[age of the universe]] and the age of the Earth are as described by [[astronomer]]s and [[geologist]]s, but that details of [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary theory]] are questionable.<ref name=\"Scott1999\" />\n\nOld Earth creationism itself comes in at least three types:<ref name=\"Scott1999\" />\n\n====Gap creationism====\n{{Main|Gap creationism}}\nGap creationism, also called \"restoration creationism,\" holds that life was recently created on a pre-existing old Earth. This version of creationism relies on a particular interpretation of {{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:1\u20132|KJV}}. It is considered that the words [[Tohu wa-bohu|''formless'' and ''void'']] in fact denote waste and ruin, taking into account the original Hebrew and other places these words are used in the [[Old Testament]]. Genesis 1:1\u20132 is consequently translated:\n\n: \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\" (Original act of creation.)\n: \"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\"\n\nThus, the six days of creation (verse 3 onwards) start sometime after the Earth was \"without form and void.\" This allows an indefinite \"gap\" of time to be inserted after the original creation of the universe, but prior to the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation according to Genesis]], (when present biological species and [[human]]ity were created). Gap theorists can therefore agree with the [[scientific consensus]] regarding the age of the Earth and universe, while maintaining a literal interpretation of the biblical text.\n\nSome{{which|date=November 2013}} gap creationists expand the basic version of creationism by proposing a \"primordial creation\" of biological life within the \"gap\" of time. This is thought to be \"the world that then was\" mentioned in [[2 Peter]] 3:3\u20137.<ref>{{Bibleverse|2 Peter|3|KJV}}</ref> Discoveries of fossils and archaeological ruins older than 10,000 years are generally ascribed to this \"world that then was,\" which may also be associated with [[Lucifer]]'s rebellion. These views became popular with publications of Hebrew Lexicons such as ''[[Strong's Concordance]]'', and Bible commentaries such as the ''[[Scofield Reference Bible]]'' and [[E. W. Bullinger|''The Companion Bible'']].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n====Day-age creationism====\n{{Main|Day-age creationism}}\nDay-age creationism states that the \"six days\" of the Book of Genesis are not ordinary 24-hour days, but rather much longer periods (for instance, each \"day\" could be the equivalent of millions, or billions of years of human time). The physicist [[Gerald Schroeder]] is one such proponent of this view. This version of creationism often states that the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word \"y\u00f4m,\" in the context of Genesis 1, can be properly interpreted as \"age.\"\n\nStrictly speaking, day-age creationism is not so much a version of creationism as a [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] option which may be combined with other versions of creationism such as progressive creationism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Progressive creationism====\n{{Main|Progressive creationism}}\nProgressive creationism holds that species have changed or evolved in a process continuously guided by God, with various ideas as to how the process operated\u2014though it is generally taken that God directly intervened in the natural order at key moments in Earth history. This view accepts most of modern physical science including the age of the Earth, but rejects much of modern [[evolutionary biology]] or looks to it for evidence that evolution by [[natural selection]] alone is incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Organizations such as [[Reasons To Believe]], founded by [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], promote this version of creationism.\n\nProgressive creationism can be held in conjunction with [[hermeneutic]] approaches to the Genesis creation narrative such as the [[day-age creationism]] or [[Framework interpretation (Genesis)|framework]]/metaphoric/poetic views.\n\n===Philosophic and scientific creationism===\n====Creation science====\n{{Main|Creation science}}\nCreation science, or initially scientific creationism, is a [[pseudoscience]]<ref>{{cite journal| pmc=2267227 | pmid=18059309 | doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7401131 | volume=8 | issue=12 | title=Taking on creationism.

Common features of Creation science argument include: creationist cosmologies which accommodate a universe on the order of thousands of years old, criticism of [[radiometric dating]] through a technical argument about [[radiohalo]]s, explanations for the [[Fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]] as a record of the [[Genesis flood narrative]] (see [[flood geology]]), and explanations for the present diversity as a result of pre-designed genetic variability and partially due to the rapid degradation of the perfect [[genome]]s God placed in \"created kinds\" or \"[[Baraminology|Baramin]]\" (see [[Creation science#Creationist biology|creationist biology]]) due to [[mutation]]s.\n\n====Neo-creationism====\n{{Main|Neo-creationism}}\nNeo-creationism is a [[pseudoscientific]] movement which aims to restate creationism in terms more likely to be well received by the public, by policy makers, by educators and by the [[scientific community]]. It aims to [[Framing (social sciences)|re-frame]] the debate over the [[Creation myth|origins of life]] in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture. This comes in response to the 1987 ruling by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Edwards v.

Johnson]]'s claim that he is speaking \"of a God who acted openly and left his fingerprints on all the evidence.\"). Murphy argues that this view of God is incompatible with the Christian understanding of God as \"the one revealed in the cross and resurrection of Christ.\" The basis of this theology is [[Isaiah]] 45:15, \"Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.\"\n\nMurphy observes that the execution of a Jewish carpenter by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities is in and of itself an ordinary event and did not require [[Miracle|divine action]]. On the contrary, for the crucifixion to occur, God had to limit or \"empty\" himself. It was for this reason that [[Paul the Apostle]] wrote, in [[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians]] 2:5-8:\n\n<blockquote>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</blockquote>\n\nMurphy concludes that,<blockquote>Just as the Son of God limited himself by taking human form and dying on a cross, God limits divine action in the world to be in accord with rational laws which God has chosen. This enables us to understand the world on its own terms, but it also means that natural processes hide God from scientific observation.</blockquote>For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a [[Naturalism (philosophy)#Methodological naturalism|''methodological'' naturalism]], meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a [[Metaphysical naturalism|''metaphysical'' naturalism]], which proposes that nature is all that there is.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Murphy |first=George L. |year=2002 |title=Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem |url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/nrcse/IDTHG.html |journal=Covalence: The Bulletin of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Alliance for Faith, Science and Technology |volume=IV |issue=2 |oclc=52753579 |accessdate=2014-03-31}} Reprinted with permission.</ref>\n\nThe Jesuit priest [[George Coyne]] has stated that is \"unfortunate that, especially here in America, creationism has come to mean...some literal interpretation of Genesis.\" He argues that \"...Judaic-Christian faith is radically creationist, but in a totally different sense.

In 1996 Michel Brunet had unearthed a hominid [[jaw]] which he named [[Australopithecus bahrelghazali]], and unofficially dubbed [[Abel (hominid)|Abel]]. It was dated using [[Beryllium]] based [[Radiometric dating]] as living circa. 3.6 million years ago.\n\nDuring the [[7th millennium BC]], the northern half of Chad was part of a broad expanse of land, stretching from the [[Indus River]] in the east to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the west, in which [[ecology|ecological]] conditions favored early human settlement. [[Rock art]] of the \"Round Head\" style, found in the [[Ennedi]] region, has been dated to before the 7th millennium BC and, because of the tools with which the rocks were carved and the scenes they depict, may represent the oldest evidence in the [[Sahara]] of [[Neolithic]] industries. Many of the [[pottery]]-making and Neolithic activities in Ennedi date back further than any of those of the [[Nile]] Valley to the east.<ref name=\"locchad\" />\n\nIn the [[prehistory|prehistoric]] period, Chad was much wetter than it is today, as evidenced by large game animals depicted in [[Cave painting|rock paintings]] in the [[Tibesti]] and Borkou regions.<ref name=\"locchad\" />\n\nRecent linguistic research suggests that all of [[Africa]]'s major language groupings south of the Sahara Desert (except [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]], which is not considered a valid genetic grouping anyway), i. e. the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]], [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] and [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger\u2013Congo]] [[Language family#Subdivision|phyla]], originated in prehistoric times in a narrow band between [[Lake Chad]] and the Nile Valley. The origins of Chad's peoples, however, remain unclear. Several of the proven archaeological sites have been only partially studied, and other sites of great potential have yet to be mapped.<ref name=\"locchad\" />\n\n==Era of Empires (AD 900&ndash;1900)==\nthe end of the 1st millennium AD, the formation of states began across central Chad in the [[sahel]]ian zone between the [[desert]] and the [[savanna]]. For almost the next 1,000 years, these states, their relations with each other, and their effects on the peoples who lived in stateless societies along their peripheries dominated Chad's political history. Recent research suggests that indigenous [[History of Africa|Africans]] founded of these states, not migrating [[Arabic language|Arabic-speaking]] groups, as was believed previously. Nonetheless, immigrants, [[Arab]]ic-speaking or otherwise, played a significant role, along with [[Islam]], in the formation and early evolution of these states.<ref name=\"locchad14\">Collier 1990 p.14</ref>\n\nMost states began as [[monarchy|kingdoms]], in which the [[monarch|king]] was considered divine and endowed with temporal and spiritual powers. All states were [[militarism|militaristic]] (or they did not survive long), but none was able to expand far into southern Chad, where forests and the [[tsetse fly]] complicated the use of [[cavalry]]. Control over the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region formed the economic basis of these kingdoms. Although many states rose and fell, the most important and durable of the empires were [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu]], [[Kingdom of Baguirmi|Baguirmi]], and [[Ouaddai Empire|Ouaddai]], according to most written sources (mainly [[Noble court|court]] [[chronicle]]s and writings of Arab [[merchant|traders]] and travelers).<ref name=\"locchad14\" />[http://countrystudies.us/chad/5.htm]\n\n===Kanem-Bornu===\n{{main|Kanem-Bornu Empire}}\nThe Kanem Empire originated in the 9th century AD to the northeast of [[Lake Chad]]. Historians agree that the leaders of the new state were ancestors of the [[Kanem Empire|Kanembu]] people. Toward the end of the 11th century the [[Sayfawa dynasty|Sayfawa]] king (or ''mai'', the title of the Sayfawa rulers) [[Hummay]], converted to Islam. In the following century the Sayfawa rulers expanded southward into [[Kanem (region)|Kanem]], where was to rise their first capital, [[Njimi]]. Kanem's expansion peaked during the long and energetic reign of Mai [[Dunama Dabbalemi]] (c. 1221&ndash;1259).<ref name=\"locchad15\">Collier 1990 p. 15</ref>\n[[Image:Group of Kanem-Bu warriors.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Group of Kanem-Bu warriors]]\n\nBy the end of the 14th century, internal struggles and external attacks had torn Kanem apart. Finally, around 1396 the [[Bulala]] invaders forced ''Mai'' [[Umar Idrismi]] to abandon Njimi and move the Kanembu people to [[Borno State|Bornu]] on the western edge of Lake Chad. Over time, the intermarriage of the Kanembu and Bornu peoples created a new people and language, the [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], and founded a new capital, [[Ngazargamu]].<ref name=\"locchad15\" />\n\nKanem-Bornu peaked during the reign of the outstanding statesman ''Mai'' [[Idris Aluma]] (c. 1571&ndash;1603). Aluma is remembered for his military skills, administrative reforms, and Islamic piety. The administrative reforms and military brilliance of Aluma sustained the empire until the mid-17th century, when its power began to fade. By the early 19th century, Kanem-Bornu was clearly an empire in decline, and in 1808 [[Fulani Empire|Fulani]] warriors conquered Ngazargamu. Bornu survived, but the Sayfawa dynasty ended in 1846 and the Empire itself fell in 1893.<ref name=\"locchad15\" />\n\n===Baguirmi and Ouaddai===\n{{main|Kingdom of Baguirmi|Ouaddai Kingdom}}\nIn addition to Kanem-Bornu, two other states in the region, [[Kingdom of Baguirmi|Baguirmi]] and [[Ouaddai Kingdom|Ouaddai]], achieved historical prominence. Baguirmi emerged to the southeast of Kanem-Bornu in the 16th century. [[Islam]] was adopted, and the state became a [[sultan]]ate. Absorbed into Kanem-Bornu, Baguirmi broke free later in the 17th century, only to be returned to [[tribute|tributary]] status in the mid-18th century. Early in the 19th century, Baguirmi fell into decay and was threatened militarily by the nearby kingdom of Ouaddai. Although Baguirmi resisted, it accepted tributary status in order to obtain help from Ouaddai in putting down internal dissension. When the capital was burned in 1893, the sultan sought and received [[protectorate]] status from the [[French colonial empires|French]].<ref name=\"locchad16\">Collier 1990 p. 16</ref>\n\nLocated in northeast of Baguirmi, Ouaddai was a non-Muslim kingdom that emerged in the 16th century as an offshoot of the state of [[Darfur]] (in present-day [[Sudan]]). Early in the 12th century, groups in the region rallied to [[Abd al-Karim Sabun]], who overthrew the ruling [[Tunjur]] group, transforming Ouaddai into an Islamic [[sultan]]ate. During much of the 18th century, Ouaddai resisted reincorporation into Darfur.<ref name=\"locchad16\" />\n\nIn about 1804, under the rule of Sabun, the sultanate began to expand its power. A new trade route north was discovered, and Sabun outfitted royal caravans to take advantage of it. He began minting his own coinage and imported [[chain mail]], [[firearm]]s, and military advisers from [[North Africa]]. Sabun's successors were less able than he, and Darfur took advantage of a disputed political succession in 1838 to put its own candidate in power. This tactic backfired when Darfur's choice, [[Muhammad Sharif of Ouaddai|Muhammad Sharif]], rejected Darfur and asserted his own authority. In doing so, he gained acceptance from Ouaddai's various factions and went on to become Ouaddai's ablest ruler. Sharif eventually established Ouaddai's hegemony over Baguirmi and kingdoms as far away as the [[Chari River]]. The Ouaddai opposed French domination until well into the 20th century.<ref name=\"locchad16\" />\n\n==Colonialism (1900&ndash;40)==\n{{main|Colonial Chad}}\n[[Image:Mort du Commandant Lamy.jpg|thumb|200px|Death of Commander Lamy of France, 1900]]The [[France|French]] first penetrated Chad in 1891, establishing their authority through military expeditions primarily against the Muslim kingdoms. The decisive colonial battle for Chad was fought on April 22, 1900 at [[Battle of Kouss\u00e9ri]] between forces of French [[Major]] [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Fran\u00e7ois Lamy]] and forces of the [[Sudan]]ese warlord [[Rabih az-Zubayr]]. Both leaders were killed in the battle.\n\nIn 1905, administrative responsibility for Chad was placed under a [[governor-general]] stationed at [[Brazzaville]], capital of [[French Equatorial Africa]] (AEF). Chad did not have a separate colonial status until 1920, when it was placed under a [[lieutenant-governor]] stationed in [[Fort-Lamy]] (today N'Djamena).<ref name=\"locchad17\">Collier 1990 p. 17</ref>\n\nTwo fundamental themes dominated Chad's colonial experience with the French: an absence of policies designed to unify the territory and an exceptionally slow pace of [[modernization]]. In the French scale of priorities, the [[colony]] of Chad ranked near the bottom, and the French came to perceive Chad primarily as a source of raw [[cotton]] and [[manual labour|untrained labour]] to be used in the more productive colonies to the south.<ref name=\"locchad17\" />\n\nThroughout the colonial period, large areas of Chad were never governed effectively: in the huge [[BET Prefecture]], the handful of French military administrators usually left the people alone, and in central Chad, French rule was only slightly more substantive. Truly speaking, France managed to govern effectively only the south.<ref name=\"locchad17\" />\n\n==Decolonization (1940&ndash;60)==\n{{main|Decolonization in Chad}}\n[[Image:Eboue wwII prop 03-0118a.jpg|thumb|200px|F\u00e9lix \u00c9bou\u00e9 in a contemporary World War II cartoon]]During [[World War II]], Chad was the first French [[colony]] to rejoin the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] (August 26, 1940), after the [[Battle of France|defeat of France by Germany]]. Under the administration of [[F\u00e9lix \u00c9bou\u00e9]], France's first black colonial governor, a military column, commanded by Colonel [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque]], and including two battalions of [[Sara people|Sara]] troops, moved north from [[N'Djamena]] (then Fort Lamy) to engage [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] forces in [[Libya]], where, in partnership with the British Army's [[Long Range Desert Group]], they captured [[Kufra]]. On 21 January 1942, N'Djamena was [[Sonderkommando Blaich|bombed]] by a German aircraft.\n\nAfter the war ended, local parties started to develop in Chad. The first to be born was the radical [[Chadian Progressive Party]] (PPT) in February 1947, initially headed by Panamanian born [[Gabriel Lisette]], but from 1959 headed by [[Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye]]. The more conservative [[Chadian Democratic Union]] (UDT) was founded in November 1947 and represented French commercial interests and a bloc of traditional leaders composed primarily of Muslim and [[Ouaddai Kingdom|Ouadda\u00efan]] nobility.  The confrontation between the PPT and UDT was more than simply ideological; it represented different regional identities, with the PPT representing the Christian and [[Animism|animist]] south and the UDT the Islamic north.\n\nThe PPT won the May 1957 pre-independence elections thanks to a greatly expanded franchise, and Lisette led the government of the Territorial Assembly until he lost a confidence vote on 11 February 1959. After a referendum on territorial autonomy on 28 September 1958, French Equatorial Africa was dissolved, and its four constituent states &ndash; [[Gabon]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo (Brazzaville)]], the [[Central African Republic]], and Chad became autonomous members of the [[French Community]] from 28 November 1958. Following Lisette's fall in February 1959 the opposition leaders [[Gontchome Sahoulba]] and [[Ahmed Koulamallah]] could not form a stable government, so the PPT was again asked to form an administration - which it did under the leadership of Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye on 26 March 1959. On 12 July 1960 France agreed to Chad becoming fully independent.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00D1FFA3D581A7A93C1A8178CD85F448685F9 | work=The New York Times | first=W. Granger | last=Blair | title=3 More Nations Gain Freedom Through Pacts Signed by France; Congo, Central African and Chad Republics Are Given Sovereignty in Paris | date=July 13, 1960}}</ref> On 11 August 1960, Chad became an independent country and Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye became its first president.\n\n==The Tombalbaye era (1960&ndash;75)==\n{{main|The Tombalbaye Regime}}\nOne of the most prominent aspects of Tombalbaye's rule to prove itself was his authoritarianism and distrust of democracy. Already in January 1962 he banned all political parties except his own PPT, and started immediately concentrating all power in his own hands. His treatment of opponents, real or imagined, was extremely harsh, filling the prisons with thousands of political prisoners.\n\nWhat was even worse was his constant discrimination against the central and northern regions of Chad, where the southern Chadian administrators came to be perceived as arrogant and incompetent. This resentment at last exploded in a tax revolt on November 1, 1965, in the [[Gu\u00e9ra Prefecture]], causing 500 deaths. The year after saw the birth in [[Sudan]] of the [[FROLINAT|National Liberation Front of Chad]] (FROLINAT), created to militarily oust Tombalbaye and the Southern dominance. It was the start of a bloody civil war.\n\nTombalbaye resorted to calling in French troops; while moderately successful, they were not fully able to quell the insurgency. Proving more fortunate was his choice to break with the French and seek friendly ties with [[Libya]]n president [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]], taking away the rebels' principal source of supplies.\n\nBut while he had reported some success against the rebels, Tombalbaye started behaving more and more irrationally and brutally, continuously eroding his consensus among the southern elites, which dominated all key positions in the army, the civil service and the ruling party. As a consequence on April 13, 1975, several units of N'Djamena's [[gendarmerie]] [[Chadian coup of 1975|killed Tombalbaye during a coup]].\n\n==Military rule (1975&ndash;78)==\n{{main|Malloum's military government}}\nThe [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] that terminated Tombalbaye's government received an enthusiastic response in [[N'Djamena]]. The southerner [[General]] [[F\u00e9lix Malloum]] emerged early as the chairman of the new ''[[Military dictatorship|junta]]''.\n\nThe new military leaders were unable to retain for long the popularity that they had gained through their overthrow of Tombalbaye. Malloum proved himself unable to cope with the [[FROLINAT]] and at the end decided his only chance was in coopting some of the rebels: in 1978 he allied himself with the insurgent leader [[Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9]], who entered the government as prime minister.\n\n==Civil war (1979-82)==\n{{main|Transitional Government of National Unity}}\nInternal dissent within the government led Prime Minister Habr\u00e9 to send his forces against Malloum's national army in the capital in February 1979. Malloum was ousted from the presidency, but the resulting civil war amongst the 11 emergent factions was so widespread that it rendered the central government largely irrelevant. At that point, other African governments decided to intervene.\n\nA series of four international conferences held first under Nigerian and then [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) sponsorship attempted to bring the Chadian factions together. At the fourth conference, held in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]], in August 1979, the Lagos Accord was signed. This accord established a transitional government pending national elections. In November 1979, the [[Transitional Government of National Unity]] (GUNT) was created with a mandate to govern for 18 months. [[Goukouni Oueddei]], a northerner, was named president; Colonel [[Wadel Abdelkader Kamougu\u00e9|Kamougu\u00e9]], a southerner, Vice President; and Habr\u00e9, Minister of Defense. This coalition proved fragile; in January 1980, fighting broke out again between Goukouni's and Habr\u00e9's forces. With assistance from [[Libya]], Goukouni regained control of the capital and other urban centers by year\u2019s end. However, Goukouni\u2019s January 1981 statement that Chad and [[Libya]] had agreed to work for the realization of complete unity between the two countries generated intense international pressure and Goukouni's subsequent call for the complete withdrawal of external forces.\n\n==The Habr\u00e9 era (1982&ndash;90)==\n:''see: [[Chadian-Libyan conflict]]''\nLibya's partial withdrawal to the [[Aozou Strip]] in northern Chad cleared the way for Habr\u00e9's forces to enter N\u2019Djamena in June. French troops and an OAU peacekeeping force of 3,500 Nigerian, [[Senegal]]ese, and [[Zaire|Zairian]] troops (partially funded by the [[United States]]) remained neutral during the conflict.\n[[File:Tschad GUNT.jpg|thumb|The [[Aozou Strip]] (dark green), claimed and occupied by Libya between 1976 and 1987, and territories held by Libyan-backed GUNT-forces (light green)]]\n\nHabr\u00e9 continued to face armed opposition on various fronts, and was brutal in his repression of suspected opponents, massacring and torturing many during his rule. In the summer of 1983, GUNT forces launched an offensive against government positions in northern and eastern Chad with heavy Libyan support. In response to Libya's direct intervention, French and Zairian forces intervened to defend Habr\u00e9, pushing Libyan and rebel forces north of the [[16th parallel north|16th parallel]]. In September 1984, the French and the Libyan governments announced an agreement for the mutual withdrawal of their forces from Chad. By the end of the year, all French and Zairian troops were withdrawn. Libya did not honor the withdrawal accord, and its forces continued to occupy the northern third of Chad.\n\nRebel commando groups ([[Codos]]) in southern Chad were broken up by government massacres in 1984. In 1985 Habr\u00e9 briefly reconciled with some of his opponents, including the [[Democratic Front of Chad]] (FDT) and the [[Coordinating Action Committee of the Democratic Revolutionary Council]]. Goukouni also began to rally toward Habr\u00e9, and with his support Habr\u00e9 successfully expelled Libyan forces from most of Chadian territory. A cease-fire between Chad and Libya held from 1987 to 1988, and negotiations over the next several years led to the 1994 International Court of Justice decision granting Chad sovereignty over the Aouzou strip, effectively ending Libyan occupation.\n\n==The D\u00e9by era==\n\n===Rise to power===\nHowever, rivalry between [[Hadjerai]], [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] and [[Gorane]] groups within the government grew in the late 1980s. In April 1989, [[Idriss D\u00e9by]], one of Habr\u00e9's leading generals and a Zaghawa, defected and fled to [[Darfur]] in Sudan, from which he mounted a Zaghawa-supported series of attacks on Habr\u00e9 (a Gorane). In December 1990, with Libyan assistance and no opposition from French troops stationed in Chad, D\u00e9by\u2019s forces successfully marched on N\u2019Djamena. After 3 months of provisional government, D\u00e9by\u2019s [[Patriotic Salvation Movement]] (MPS) approved a national charter on February 28, 1991, with D\u00e9by as president.\n\nDuring the next two years, D\u00e9by faced at least two coup attempts. Government forces clashed violently with rebel forces, including the Movement for Democracy and Development, MDD, National Revival Committee for Peace and Democracy (CSNPD), Chadian National Front (FNT) and the Western Armed Forces (FAO), near [[Lake Chad]] and in southern regions of the country. Earlier French demands for the country to hold a National Conference resulted in the gathering of 750 delegates representing political parties (which were legalized in 1992), the government, trade unions and the army to discuss the creation of a pluralist democratic regime.\n\nHowever, unrest continued, sparked in part by large-scale killings of civilians in southern Chad. The CSNPD, led by [[Kette Moise]] and other southern groups entered into a peace agreement with government forces in 1994, which later broke down. Two new groups, the [[Armed Forces for a Federal Republic]] (FARF) led by former Kette ally [[Laokein Barde]] and the Democratic Front for Renewal (FDR), and a reformulated MDD clashed with government forces from 1994 to 1995.\n\n===Multiparty elections===\n{{see also|Elections in Chad}}\nTalks with political opponents in early 1996 did not go well, but D\u00e9by announced his intent to hold presidential elections in June. D\u00e9by won the country\u2019s first multi-party presidential elections with support in the second round from opposition leader Kebzabo, defeating General Kamougue (leader of the 1975 coup against Tombalbaye). D\u00e9by\u2019s MPS party won 63 of 125 seats in the January 1997 legislative elections. International observers noted numerous serious irregularities in presidential and legislative election proceedings.\n\nBy mid-1997 the government signed peace deals with FARF and the MDD leadership and succeeded in cutting off the groups from their rear bases in the Central African Republic and Cameroon. Agreements also were struck with rebels from the National Front of Chad (FNT) and Movement for Social Justice and Democracy in October 1997. However, peace was short-lived, as FARF rebels clashed with government soldiers, finally surrendering to government forces in May 1998. Barde was killed in the fighting, as were hundreds of other southerners, most civilians.\n\nSince October 1998, Chadian Movement for Justice and Democracy (MDJT) rebels, led by [[Youssuf Togoimi]] until his death in September 2002, have skirmished with government troops in the Tibesti region, resulting in hundreds of civilian, government, and rebel casualties, but little ground won or lost. No active armed opposition has emerged in other parts of Chad, although Kette Moise, following senior postings at the Ministry of Interior, mounted a smallscale local operation near [[Moundou]] which was quickly and violently suppressed by government forces in late 2000.\n\nD\u00e9by, in the mid-1990s, gradually restored basic functions of government and entered into agreements with the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] to carry out substantial economic reforms. Oil exploitation in the southern Doba region began in June 2000, with World Bank Board approval to finance a small portion of a project, the [[Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development Project]], aimed at transport of Chadian crude through a 1000-km buried pipeline through Cameroon to the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. The project established unique mechanisms for World Bank, private sector, government, and civil society collaboration to guarantee that future oil revenues benefit local populations and result in poverty alleviation. Success of the project depended on [http://go.worldbank.org/5MGHQ1ZQ01 multiple monitoring efforts]<ref>International Advisory Group, External Compliance Monitoring Group, Coll\u00e8ge de Contr\u00f4le et de Surveillance des Revenues P\u00e9troliers (CCSRP),  World Bank Inspection Panel, Comit\u00e9 Technique National de Suivi et de Contr\u00f4le (CTNSC).</ref> to ensure that all parties keep their commitments.

Having accused the government of fraud, six opposition leaders were arrested (twice) and one opposition party activist was killed following the announcement of election results. However, despite claims of government corruption, favoritism of Zaghawas, and abuses by the security forces, opposition party and labor union calls for general strikes and more active demonstrations against the government have been unsuccessful. Despite movement toward democratic reform, power remains in the hands of a northern ethnic oligarchy.\n\nIn 2003, Chad began receiving refugees from the [[Darfur]] region of western Sudan. More than 200,000 refugees fled the fighting between two rebel groups and government-supported militias known as [[Janjaweed]]. A number of border incidents led to the [[Chadian-Sudanese War]].\n\n===War in the East===\n{{main|Chadian Civil War (2005\u20132010)}}\n[[Image:Civil war in Chad.png|thumb|200px|Hot spots in the present civil war.]]The war started on December 23, 2005, when the [[Politics of Chad|government of Chad]] declared a [[war|state of war]] with [[Sudan]] and called for the citizens of [[Chad]] to mobilize themselves against the \"common enemy,\"<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4556576.stm Chad in 'state of war' with Sudan] by Stephanie Hancock, [[BBC News]].</ref> which the Chadian government sees as the [[Rally for Democracy and Liberty]] (RDL) militants, Chadian rebels, backed by the [[Sudan|Sudanese]] government, and Sudanese militiamen. Militants have attacked villages and towns in eastern Chad, stealing cattle, murdering citizens, and burning houses. Over 200,000 refugees from the [[Darfur]] region of northwestern Sudan currently claim asylum in eastern Chad. Chadian president [[Idriss D\u00e9by]] accuses Sudanese President [[Omar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir]] of trying to \"destabilize our country, to drive our people into misery, to create disorder and export the war from Darfur to Chad.\"\n\nAn attack on the Chadian town of [[Adre, Chad|Adre]] near the Sudanese border led to the deaths of either one hundred rebels, as every news source other than [[CNN]] has reported, or three hundred rebels.

We technically deny involvement in Chadian internal affairs.\" This attack was the final straw that led to the declaration of war by Chad and the alleged deployment of the Chadian airforce into Sudanese airspace, which the Chadian government denies.<ref>Al Jazeera</ref>\n\nAn attack on N'Djamena was defeated on April 13, 2006 in the [[Battle of N'Djamena (2006)|Battle of N'Djamena]]. The President on national radio stated that the situation was under control, but residents, diplomats and journalists reportedly heard shots of weapons fire.\n\nOn November 25, 2006, rebels captured the eastern town of [[Abeche]], capital of the [[Ouadda\u00ef Region]] and center for humanitarian aid to the [[Darfur]] region in [[Sudan]]. On the same day, a separate rebel group [[Rally of Democratic Forces]] had captured [[Biltine, Chad|Biltine]]. On November 26, 2006, the Chadian government claimed to have recaptured both towns, although rebels still claimed control of [[Biltine, Chad|Biltine]]. Government buildings and humanitarian aid offices in Abeche were said to have been looted. The Chadian government denied a warning issued by the French Embassy in [[N'Djamena]] that a group of rebels was making its way through the [[Batha Prefecture]] in central Chad.

But Idris Deby with government troops fought back. French forces flew in ammunition for Chadian government troops but took no active part in the fighting. UN has said that up to 20,000 people left the region, taking refuge in nearby [[Cameroon]] and [[Nigeria]]. Hundreds of people were killed, mostly civilians. The rebels accuse Deby of corruption and embezzling millions in oil revenue.

Most of its ethnically and linguistically diverse population lives in the south, with densities ranging from 54 persons per square kilometer in the Logone River basin to 0.1 persons in the northern B.E.T. ([[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region|Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti]]) desert region, which itself is larger than France. The capital city of [[N'Djam\u00e9na]], situated at the confluence of the [[Chari River|Chari]] and [[Logone River]]s, is cosmopolitan in nature, with a current population in excess of 700,000 people. \n\nChad has four bioclimatic zones. The northernmost [[Sahara]]n zone averages less than {{convert|200|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall annually. The sparse human population is largely nomadic, with some livestock, mostly small ruminants and camels. The central Sahelian zone receives between {{convert|200|and|600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} rainfall and has vegetation ranging from grass/shrub [[steppe]] to thorny, open savanna. The southern zone, often referred to as the Sudan zone, receives between {{convert|600|and|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, with woodland [[savanna]] and deciduous forests for vegetation. Rainfall in the Guinea zone, located in Chad's southwestern tip, ranges between {{convert|1000|and|1200|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe country's topography is generally flat, with the elevation gradually rising as one moves north and east away from [[Lake Chad]]. The highest point in Chad is [[Emi Koussi]], a mountain that rises {{convert|3100|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the northern [[Tibesti Mountains]]. The [[Ennedi Plateau]] and the [[Ouadda\u00ef highlands]] in the east complete the image of a gradually sloping basin, which descends towards Lake Chad. There are also central highlands in the Guera region rising to {{convert|1500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[Lake Chad]] is the second largest lake in west Africa and is one of the most important wetlands on the continent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6261447.stm BBC News - Lake Chad fishermen pack up their nets]</ref> Home to 120 species of fish and at least that many species of birds, the lake has shrunk dramatically in the last four decades due to increased water usage from an [[Human overpopulation|expanding population]] and low rainfall. Bordered by Chad, [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Cameroon]], Lake Chad currently covers only 1350 square kilometers, down from 25,000 square kilometers in 1963. The Chari and Logone Rivers, both of which originate in the Central African Republic and flow northward, provide most of the surface water entering Lake Chad. Chad is also next to Niger. \n\n==Geographical placement==\n[[File:Chad sat.jpg|thumb|250px|A satellite image of Chad.]]\n[[File:Chad nasa satellite.png|thumb|250px|A satellite image of Chad.]]\n[[File:Chad Topography.png|thumb|250px|A topographic map of Chad.]]\nLocated in north-central Africa, Chad stretches for about 1,800 kilometers from its northernmost point to its southern boundary. Except in the far northwest and south, where its borders converge, Chad's average width is about 800 kilometers. Its area of 1,284,000 square kilometers is roughly equal to the combined areas of [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], and [[Arizona]]. Chad's neighbors include [[Libya]] to the north, [[Niger]] and [[Nigeria]] to the west, [[Sudan]] to the east, [[Central African Republic]] to the south, and [[Cameroon]] to the southwest.\n\nChad exhibits two striking geographical characteristics. First, the country is landlocked. [[N'Djamena]], the capital, is located more than 1,100 kilometers northeast of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; [[Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9]], a major city in the east, lies 2,650 kilometers from the [[Red Sea]]; and [[Faya-Largeau]], a much smaller but strategically important center in the north, is in the middle of the [[Sahara Desert]], 1,550 kilometers from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. These vast distances from the sea have had a profound impact on Chad's historical and contemporary development.\n\nThe second noteworthy characteristic is that the country borders on very different parts of the African continent: [[North Africa]], with its [[Islamic culture]] and economic orientation toward the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and [[West Africa]], with its diverse religions and cultures and its history of highly developed states and regional economies;\n\nChad also borders [[Horn of Africa|Northeast Africa]], oriented toward the [[Nile|Nile Valley]] and the Red Sea region - and Central or Equatorial Africa, some of whose people have retained classical African religions while others have adopted [[Christianity]], and whose economies were part of the great [[Congo River]] system. Although much of Chad's distinctiveness comes from this diversity of influences, since independence the diversity has also been an obstacle to the creation of a national identity.\n\n==Land==\nAlthough Chadian society is economically, socially, and culturally fragmented, the country's geography is unified by the [[Lake Chad Basin]]. Once a huge inland sea (the Pale-Chadian Sea) whose only remnant is shallow Lake Chad, this vast depression extends west into Nigeria and Niger. The larger, northern portion of the basin is bounded within Chad by the Tibesti Mountains in the northwest, the Ennedi Plateau in the northeast, the Ouadda\u00ef Highlands in the east along the border with Sudan, the Gu\u00e9ra Massif in central Chad, and the Mandara Mountains along Chad's southwestern border with Cameroon. The smaller, southern part of the basin falls almost exclusively in Chad. It is delimited in the north by the Gu\u00e9ra Massif, in the south by highlands 250 kilometers south of the border with Central African Republic, and in the southwest by the Mandara Mountains.\n\nLake Chad, located in the southwestern part of the basin at an altitude of 282 meters, surprisingly does not mark the basin's lowest point; instead, this is found in the [[Bodele]] and Djourab regions in the north-central and northeastern parts of the country, respectively. This oddity arises because the great stationary dunes (ergs) of the Kanem region create a dam, preventing lake waters from flowing to the basin's lowest point. At various times in the past, and as late as the 1870s, the Bahr el Ghazal Depression, which extends from the northeastern part of the lake to the Djourab, acted as an overflow canal; since independence, climatic conditions have made overflows impossible.\n\nNorth and northeast of Lake Chad, the basin extends for more than 800 kilometers, passing through regions characterized by great rolling dunes separated by very deep depressions. Although vegetation holds the dunes in place in the Kanem region, farther north they are bare and have a fluid, rippling character. From its low point in the Djourab, the basin then rises to the plateaus and peaks of the Tibesti Mountains in the north. The summit of this formation\u2014as well as the highest point in the Sahara Desert\u2014is Emi Koussi, a dormant volcano that reaches 3,414 meters above sea level.\n\nThe basin's northeastern limit is the [[Ennedi Plateau]], whose limestone bed rises in steps etched by erosion. East of the lake, the basin rises gradually to the Ouadda\u00ef Highlands, which mark Chad's eastern border and also divide the Chad and Nile watersheds. These highland areas are part of the [[East Saharan montane xeric woodlands]] [[ecoregion]].\n\nSoutheast of Lake Chad, the regular contours of the terrain are broken by the Gu\u00e9ra Massif, which divides the basin into its northern and southern parts. South of the lake lie the floodplains of the Chari and Logone rivers, much of which are inundated during the rainy season. Farther south, the basin floor slopes upward, forming a series of low sand and clay plateaus, called koros, which eventually climb to 615 meters above sea level. South of the Chadian border, the koros divide the Lake Chad Basin from the Ubangi-Zaire river system.\n\n==Water systems==\n{{Further|List of rivers of Chad|List of lakes of Chad}}\n\nPermanent streams do not exist in northern or central Chad. Following infrequent rains in the Ennedi Plateau and Ouadda\u00ef Highlands, water may flow through depressions called enneris and wadis. Often the result of flash floods, such streams usually dry out within a few days as the remaining puddles seep into the sandy clay soil. The most important of these streams is the Batha, which in the rainy season carries water west from the Ouadda\u00ef Highlands and the Gu\u00e9ra Massif to Lake Fitri.\n\n[[File:Chari River.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Chari River]]Chad's major rivers are the [[Chari River|Chari]] and the [[Logone River|Logone]] and their tributaries, which flow from the southeast into Lake Chad. Both river systems rise in the highlands of Central African Republic and Cameroon, regions that receive more than 1,250 millimeters of rainfall annually. Fed by rivers of Central African Republic, as well as by the Bahr Salamat, [[Bahr Aouk]], and Bahr Sara rivers of southeastern Chad, the Chari River is about 1,200 kilometers long. From its origins near the city of Sarh, the middle course of the Chari makes its way through swampy terrain; the lower Chari is joined by the Logone River near N'Djamena. The Chari's volume varies greatly, from 17 cubic meters per second during the dry season to 340 cubic meters per second during the wettest part of the year.\n\nThe Logone River is formed by tributaries flowing from Cameroon and Central African Republic. Both shorter and smaller in volume than the Chari, it flows northeast for 960 kilometers; its volume ranges from five to eighty-five cubic meters per second. At N'Djamena the Logone empties into the Chari, and the combined rivers flow together for thirty kilometers through a large delta and into Lake Chad. At the end of the rainy season in the fall, the river overflows its banks and creates a huge floodplain in the delta.\n\nThe seventh largest lake in the world (and the fourth largest in Africa), [[Lake Chad]] is located in the sahelian zone, a region just south of the Sahara Desert. The Chari River contributes 95 percent of Lake Chad's water, an average annual volume of 40 billion cubic meters, 95% of which is lost to evaporation. The size of the lake is determined by rains in the southern highlands bordering the basin and by temperatures in the Sahel. Fluctuations in both cause the lake to change dramatically in size, from 9,800 square kilometers in the dry season to 25,500 at the end of the rainy season.\n\nLake Chad also changes greatly in size from one year to another. In 1870 its maximum area was 28,000 square kilometers. The measurement dropped to 12,700 in 1908. In the 1940s and 1950s, the lake remained small, but it grew again to 26,000 square kilometers in 1963. The droughts of the late 1960s, early 1970s, and mid-1980s caused Lake Chad to shrink once again, however. The only other lakes of importance in Chad are Lake Fitri, in Batha Prefecture, and Lake Iro, in the marshy southeast.\n\n==Climate==\n{{See also|Chad#Climate|l1=Climate}}\n[[File:Chad map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Chad map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.]]\nThe Lake Chad Basin embraces a great range of tropical climates from north to south, although most of these climates tend to be dry. Apart from the far north, most regions are characterized by a cycle of alternating rainy and dry seasons. In any given year, the duration of each season is determined largely by the positions of two great air masses\u2014a maritime mass over the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest and a much drier continental mass.\n\nDuring the rainy season, winds from the southwest push the moister maritime system north over the African continent where it meets and slips under the continental mass along a front called the \"intertropical convergence zone\". At the height of the rainy season, the front may reach as far as Kanem Prefecture. By the middle of the dry season, the intertropical convergence zone moves south of Chad, taking the rain with it. This weather system contributes to the formation of three major regions of climate and vegetation.\n\n===Saharan region===\n[[File:Sand strom Chad.jpg|thumb|250px|A sandstorm at Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9 airport, Chad (2005).]]\nThe Saharan region covers roughly the northern half of the country, including Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture along with the northern parts of Kanem, Batha, and Biltine prefectures. Much of this area receives only traces of rain during the entire year; at Faya Largeau, for example, annual rainfall averages less than {{convert|30|mm|in|2|sp=us}}. Scattered small oases and occasional wells provide water for a few date palms or small plots of millet and garden crops.\n\nIn much of the north, the average daily maximum temperature is about {{convert|32|\u00b0C|1}} during January, the coolest month of the year, and about {{convert|45|\u00b0C}} during May, the hottest month. On occasion, strong winds from the northeast produce violent sandstorms. In northern Biltine Prefecture, a region called the Mortcha plays a major role in animal husbandry. Dry for nine months of the year, it receives {{convert|350|mm|in|1|sp=us}} or more of rain, mostly during July and August.\n\nA carpet of green springs from the desert during this brief wet season, attracting herders from throughout the region who come to pasture their cattle and camels. Because very few wells and springs have water throughout the year, the herders leave with the end of the rains, turning over the land to the antelopes, gazelles, and ostriches that can survive with little groundwater.  Northern Chad averages over 3500 hours of sunlight per year, the south somewhat less.\n\n===Sahelian region===\nThe semiarid sahelian zone, or Sahel, forms a belt about {{convert|500|km|mi|0|sp=us}} wide that runs from Lac and Chari-Baguirmi prefectures eastward through Gu\u00e9ra, Ouadda\u00ef, and northern Salamat prefectures to the Sudanese frontier. The climate in this transition zone between the desert and the southern soudanian zone is divided into a rainy season (from June to early September) and a dry period (from October to May).\n\nIn the northern Sahel, thorny shrubs and acacia trees grow wild, while date palms, cereals, and garden crops are raised in scattered oases. Outside these settlements, nomads tend their flocks during the rainy season, moving southward as forage and surface water disappear with the onset of the dry part of the year. The central Sahel is characterized by drought-resistant grasses and small woods. Rainfall is more abundant there than in the Saharan region. For example, N'Djamena records a maximum annual average rainfall of {{convert|580|mm|in|1|sp=us}}, while Ouadda\u00ef Prefecture receives just a bit less.\n\nDuring the hot season, in April and May, maximum temperatures frequently rise above {{convert|40|\u00b0C}}. In the southern part of the Sahel, rainfall is sufficient to permit crop production on unirrigated land, and millet and sorghum are grown. Agriculture is also common in the marshlands east of Lake Chad and near swamps or wells. Many farmers in the region combine subsistence agriculture with the raising of cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry.\n\n===Soudanian region===\nThe humid ''soudanian'' zone includes the southern prefectures of Mayo-Kebbi, Tandjil\u00e9, Logone Occidental, Logone Oriental, Moyen-Chari, and southern Salamat. Between April and October, the rainy season brings between {{convert|750|and|1250|mm|in|1|sp=us}} of precipitation. Temperatures are high throughout the year. Daytime readings in Moundou, the major city in the southwest, range from {{convert|27|\u00b0C|1}} in the middle of the cool season in January to about {{convert|40|\u00b0C}} in the hot months of March, April, and May.\n\nThe soudanian region is predominantly [[East Sudanian savanna]], or plains covered with a mixture of tropical or subtropical grasses and woodlands. The growth is lush during the rainy season but turns brown and dormant during the five-month dry season between November and March. Over a large part of the region, however, natural vegetation has yielded to agriculture.\n\n===2010 drought===\n{{Main|2010 Sahel drought}} \nOn 22 June, the temperature reached {{convert|47.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in Faya, breaking a record set in 1961 at the same location. Similar temperature rises were also reported in [[Niger]], which began to enter a famine situation.<ref name=\"MastersNOAA\">{{cite web|last=Masters|first=Jeff|title=NOAA: June 2010 the globe's 4th consecutive warmest month on record|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1544|work=Weather Underground|publisher=Jeff Masters' WunderBlog|accessdate=21 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719104107/http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1544|archivedate=19 July 2010|df=}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 July the heat reached near-record levels over [[Chad]] and [[Niger]].<ref name=\"wunderground.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1516 |title=Wunder Blog : Weather Underground |publisher=Wunderground.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627220406/http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1516 |archivedate=2010-06-27 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Area==\n'''Area:'''\n<br>''total:''\n1.284 million km\u00b2\n<br>''land:''\n1,259,200&nbsp;km\u00b2\n<br>''water:''\n24,800&nbsp;km\u00b2\n\n'''Area - comparative:'''\n<br>Canada: smaller than the [[Northwest Territories]]\n<br>US: slightly more than three times the size of [[California]]\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''Land boundaries:'''\n<br>''total:''\n6,406&nbsp;km\n<br>''border countries:''\n[[Cameroon]] 1,116&nbsp;km, [[Central African Republic]] 1,556&nbsp;km, Libya 1,050&nbsp;km, [[Niger]] 1,196&nbsp;km, [[Nigeria]] 85&nbsp;km, [[Sudan]] 1,403&nbsp;km\n\n'''Coastline:'''\n0&nbsp;km (landlocked)\n\n'''Maritime claims:'''\nnone (landlocked)\n\n'''Elevation extremes:'''\n<br>''lowest point:''\n[[Djourab Depression]] 160 m\n<br>''highest point:'\n[[Emi Koussi]] 3,415 m\n\n==Land use and resources==\n'''Natural resources:'''\n[[petroleum]], [[uranium]], [[natron]], [[kaolin]], [[fish]] ([[Chari River]], [[Logone River]]), [[gold]], [[limestone]], [[sand]] and [[gravel]], [[salt]]\n\n'''Land use:'''\n<br>''arable land:''\n3.89%\n<br>''permanent crops:''\n0.03%\n<br>''other:''\n96.08% (2012)\n\n'''Irrigated land:'''\n302.7&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2003)\n\n'''Total renewable water resources:'''\n43&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> (2011)\n\n'''Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):'''\n<br>''total:''\n0.88&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>/yr (12%/12%/76%)\n<br>''per capita:''\n84.81 m<sup>3</sup>/yr (2005)\n\n==Environmental issues==\n'''Natural hazards:'''\nhot, dry, dusty,  [[Harmattan]] winds occur in north; periodic droughts; [[locust]] plagues\n\n'''Environment - current issues:'''\ninadequate supplies of potable water; improper waste disposal in rural areas contributes to soil and [[water pollution]]; [[desertification]]\n\nAlso see- [[2010 Sahel drought]]\n\n== Extreme points ==\n\nThis is a list of the extreme points of [[Chad]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\n\n*Northernmost point - an unnamed location on the border with [[Libya]], [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region|Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti region]]\n*Easternmost point - the northern section of the Chad-Sudan [[border]], [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region|Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti region]] *\n*Southernmost point - unnamed location on the border with [[Central Africa Republic]] at a confluence in the [[L\u00e9b\u00e9 river]], [[Logone Oriental Region|Logone Oriental region]]\n*Westernmost point - unnamed location west of the town of [[Kanirom]] and immediately north of [[Lake Chad]], [[Lac Region]]\n\n''*Note: technically Chad does not have an easternmost point, the northern section of the border being formed by the 24\u00b0 of longitude''\n\n==References==\n*{{loc}}\n*{{CIA World Factbook}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{coord|15|N|19|E|display=inline,title}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/print_2011.html|title=FIELD LISTING :: GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> Geo-links for Geography of Chad\n*[http://www.izf.net/izf/documentation/cartes/Pays/supercartes/tchad.htm Detailed map of Chad from www.izf.net]\n\n{{Chad topics}}\n{{Geography of Africa}}\n{{Africa topic|Climate of}}\n\n[[Category:Geography of Chad| ]]", "sha1": "jmaszrvh7wwpl5rn82vo0tftd5lpm8g"}}, {"title": "Demographics of Chad", "ns": "0", "id": "5331", "revision": {"id": "858032541", "parentid": "858032396", "timestamp": "2018-09-04T16:57:55Z", "contributor": {"username": "Afus199620", "id": "30645640"}, "comment": "/* HIV/AIDS */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Refimprove|date=February 2008}}\n[[Image:Chad-demography.png|thumb|right|Demographics of Chad, Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]\nThe people of [[Chad]] speak more than 100 different languages and divide themselves into many ethnic groups. However, language and ethnicity are not the same. Moreover, neither element can be tied to a particular physical type.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/chad/demographics_profile.html|title=Chad Demographics Profile 2016|work=indexmundi.com|accessdate=18 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the possession of a common language shows that its speakers have lived together and have a common history, peoples also change languages. This is particularly so in Chad, where the openness of the terrain, marginal rainfall, frequent drought and famine, and low population densities have encouraged physical and linguistic mobility. Slave raids among{{specify}} non-Muslim peoples, internal slave trade, and exports of captives northward from the ninth to the twentieth centuries also have resulted in language changes.\n\nAnthropologists view ethnicity as being more than genetics. Like language, ethnicity implies a shared heritage, partly economic, where people of the same ethnic group may share a livelihood, and partly social, taking the form of shared ways of doing things and organizing relations among individuals and groups. Ethnicity also involves a cultural component made up of shared values and a common worldview. Like language, ethnicity is not immutable. Shared ways of doing things change over time and alter a group's perception of its own identity.\n\nNot only do the social aspects of ethnic identity change but the biological composition (or gene pool) also may change over time. Although most ethnic groups emphasize intermarriage, people are often proscribed from seeking partners among close relatives\u2014a prohibition that promotes biological variation. In all groups, the departure of some individuals or groups and the integration of others also changes the biological component.\n\nThe Chadian government has avoided official recognition of ethnicity. With the exception of a few surveys conducted shortly after independence, little data were available on this important aspect of Chadian society. Nonetheless, ethnic identity was a significant component of life in Chad.\n\nChad's languages fall into ten major groups, each of which belongs to either the\n[[Nilo-Saharan]], [[Afro-Asiatic]], or [[Niger\u2013Congo]] language family. These represent three of the four major language families in Africa; only the [[Khoisan]] languages of southern Africa are not represented. The presence of such different languages suggests that the [[Lake Chad Basin]] may have been an important point of dispersal in ancient times.\n\n==Population==\nAccording to {{UN_Population|source}} the total population was {{UN_Population|Chad}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to only 2 429 000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 45.4%, 51.7% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 2.9% was 65 years or older\n.<ref name=\"WPP 2010\">[http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|-\n!\n! width=\"80pt\"|Total population\n! width=\"80pt\"|Population aged 0\u201314 (%)\n! width=\"80pt\"|Population aged 15\u201364 (%)\n! width=\"80pt\"|Population aged 65+ (%)\n|-\n| 1950\n|2 429 000||37.8||57.8||4.4\n|-\n| 1955\n|2 671 000||39.1||56.8||4.1\n|-\n| 1960\n|2 954 000||40.3||55.9||3.8\n|-\n| 1965\n|3 289 000||41.5||54.7||3.8\n|-\n| 1970\n|3 656 000||42.0||54.2||3.8\n|-\n| 1975\n|4 114 000||42.8||53.4||3.8\n|-\n| 1980\n|4 554 000||44.0||52.3||3.7\n|-\n| 1985\n|5 151 000||45.2||51.2||3.6\n|-\n| 1990\n|6 011 000||45.8||50.7||3.5\n|-\n| 1995\n|6 998 000||45.9||50.8||3.3\n|-\n| 2000\n|8 222 000||45.9||51.0||3.1\n|-\n| 2005\n|9 786 000||45.8||51.2||3.0\n|-\n| 2010\n|11 227 000||45.4||51.7||2.9\n|}\n\n==Vital statistics==\nRegistration of vital events is in Chad not complete.

Three religious traditions coexist in Chad- [[Traditional African religion|classical African religions]], [[Islam in Chad|Islam]], and [[Christianity in Chad|Christianity]]. None is monolithic. The first tradition includes a variety of ancestor and/or place-oriented religions whose expression is highly specific. Islam, although characterized by an orthodox set of beliefs and observances, also is expressed in diverse ways. Christianity arrived in Chad much more recently with the arrival of Europeans. Its followers are divided into [[Roman Catholicism in Chad|Roman Catholics]] and Protestants (including several denominations); as with Chadian Islam, Chadian Christianity retains aspects of pre-Christian religious belief.\n\nThe number of followers of each tradition in Chad is unknown. Estimates made in 1962 suggested that 35 percent of Chadians practiced classical African religions, 55 percent were [[Islam|Muslims]], and 10 percent were [[Christianity|Christians]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, this distribution undoubtedly changed. Observers report that Islam has spread among the [[Hajerai]] and among other non-Muslim populations of the Saharan and sahelian zones. However, the proportion of Muslims may have fallen because the birthrate among the followers of traditional religions and Christians in southern Chad is thought to be higher than that among Muslims. In addition, the upheavals since the mid-1970s have resulted in the departure of some missionaries; whether or not Chadian Christians have been numerous enough and organized enough to have attracted more converts since that time is unknown.\n\n== CIA World Factbook demographic statistics ==\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the [[CIA World Factbook]], unless otherwise indicated.\n\n===Population===\n12,075,985 (2017 est.)\n\n===Median age=== \n:Total: 17.8 years\n:Male: 16.8 years\n:Female: 18.8 years (2017 est.)\n\n===Population growth rate===\n:1.86% (2017 est.)\n\n===Net migration rate===\n:-3.2 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2017 est.)\n\n===Urbanization===\n:''urban population:'' 23.1% of total population (2018)\n:''rate of [[urbanization]]:'' 3.88% annual rate of change (2015-20 est.)\n\n===Sex ratio===\n:At birth: 1.04 male(s)/female\n:Under 15 years: 1.01 male(s)/female\n:15\u201364 years: 0.92 male(s)/female\n:65 years and over: 0.66 male(s)/female\n:Total population: 0.96 male(s)/female (2006 est.)\n\n===Life expectancy at birth===\n:Total population: 50.6 years\n:Male: 49.4 years\n:Female: 51.9 years (2017 est.)\n\n===HIV/AIDS===\n:Adult prevalence rate: 1.3% (2017 est.)\n:People living with HIV/AIDS: 110,000(2017 est.)\n:Deaths: 3,100 (2017 est.)\n\n===Children under the age of 5 years underweight===\n:28.8% (2015)\n\n===Major infectious diseases===\n:Degree of risk: very high\n:Food or waterborne diseases: bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever\n:Vectorborne disease: malaria\n:Water contact disease: schistosomiasis\n:Respiratory disease: meningococcal meningitis (2005)\n\n===Nationality===\n:Noun: Chadian(s)\n:Adjective: Chadian\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n{{main article|Ethnic groups in Chad}}\n:200 distinct groups\n*In the north and center: [[Arab people|Arabs]], [[Toubou people|Tubu]] ([[Daza people|Daza]], [[Teda people|Teda]]), [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]], [[Kanembu people|Kanembu]], [[Wadai Empire|Wadai]], [[Baguirmi people|Baguirmi]], [[Hadjarai peoples|Hadjarai]], [[Fula people|Fulani]], [[Kotoko kingdom|Kotoko]], [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Bulala]], and [[Maba people|Maba]], most of whom are Muslim\n*In the south: [[Sara people|Sara]] (Ngambaye, Mbaye, Goulaye), [[Mundang]], [[Mussei]], [[Massa (African Ethnic Group)|Massa]], most of whom are Christian or animist\n\nAbout 5,000 [[French nationality law|French citizens]] live in Chad.\n\n===Religions===\n*[[Islam in Chad|Islam]] 51.8% \n*[[Roman Catholic]] 20.3%\n*[[Protestant]] 23.5%\n*[[Animism|Animist]] 0.6%\n*[[Nontrinitarianism|Other Christians]] 0.3%\n*Unknown 0.6%\n*None 2.9% <ref name=\"DHS 2014-15\">{{cite web|url=https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR90/FR90.pdf|title=Tchad: Enqu\u00eate D\u00e9mographique et de Sant\u00e9, 2014-2015|publisher=Institut National de la Statistique, des \u00c9tudes \u00c9conomiques et D\u00e9mographiques|language=French|format=PDF|page=34|accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Languages===\n{{main article|Languages of Chad}}\n:Arabic (official), French (official), [[Sara languages|Sara]] (in south), more than 120 different languages and dialects\n\n===Literacy===\n:Definition: age 15 and over can read and write French or Arabic\n:Total population: 22.3%\n:Male: 31.3%\n:Female: 14% (2015 est.)\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Demographics of Chad}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Works cited'''\n*{{cite web|title=\"U.S. Census Bureau.\" Census Bureau Home Page|url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/country.php|website=census.gov|date=29 January 2010}}\n\n{{CIA World Factbook|year=2006}}\n\n{{Ethnic groups in Chad}}\n{{Africa in topic|Demographics of}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Demographics Of Chad}}\n[[Category:Chadian society]]\n[[Category:Demographics by country|Chad]]\n[[Category:Demographics of Africa|Chad]]\n\n[[pt:Chade#Demografia]]", "sha1": "sj1118bp9xj2hvaiif9m8o712t4cj9x"}}, {"title": "Politics of Chad", "ns": "0", "id": "5332", "revision": {"id": "865452674", "parentid": "865452644", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T01:51:46Z", "contributor": {"username": "Shellwood", "id": "2366721"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/68.197.231.226|68.197.231.226]] ([[User talk:68.197.231.226|talk]]) ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Refimprove|date=May 2013}}\n{{Politics of Chad}}\n'''Politics of Chad''' takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Chad]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]].

Following his military overthrow of [[Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9]] in December 1990, D\u00e9by won presidential elections in 1996 and 2001. The constitutional basis for the government is the 1996 constitution, under which the president was limited to two terms of office until D\u00e9by had that provision repealed in 2005. The president has the power to appoint the prime minister and the Council of State (or cabinet), and exercises considerable influence over appointments of judges, generals, provincial officials and heads of Chad\u2019s parastatal firms. In cases of grave and immediate threat, the president, in consultation with the National Assembly President and Council of State, may declare a state of emergency. Most of the D\u00e9by's key advisors are members of the [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] clan, although some southern and opposition personalities are represented in his government.\n\n==Legislative branch==\nAccording to the 1996 constitution, the [[National Assembly of Chad|National Assembly]] deputies are elected by universal suffrage for 4-year terms. The Assembly holds regular sessions twice a year, starting in March and October, and can hold special sessions as necessary and called by the prime minister. Deputies elect a president of the National Assembly every 2 years. Assembly deputies or members of the executive branch may introduce legislation; once passed by the Assembly, the president must take action to either sign or reject the law within 15 days. The National Assembly must approve the prime minister\u2019s plan of government and may force the prime minister to resign through a majority vote of no-confidence. However, if the National Assembly rejects the executive branch\u2019s program twice in one year, the president may disband the Assembly and call for new legislative elections. In practice, the president exercises considerable influence over the National Assembly through the MPS party structure.\n\n==Judicial branch==\nDespite the constitution\u2019s guarantee of judicial independence from the executive branch, the president names most key judicial officials. The Supreme Court is made up of a chief justice, named by the president, and 15 councilors chosen by the president and National Assembly; appointments are for life. The Constitutional Council, with nine judges elected to 9-year terms, has the power to review all legislation, treaties and international agreements prior to their adoption. The constitution recognizes customary and traditional law in locales where it is recognized and to the extent it does not interfere with public order or constitutional guarantees of equality for all citizens.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{Elect|List of political parties in Chad|Elections in Chad}}\n{{Chadian presidential election, 2016}}\n{{Chadian presidential election, 2011}}\n{{Chadian parliamentary election, 2011}}\n\n==International organization participation==\n[[Agency for the French-Speaking Community|ACCT]], \n[[African, Caribbean, and Pacific Group of States|ACP]], \n[[African Development Bank|AfDB]], \n[[African Union|AU]], \n[[Central African States Development Bank|BDEAC]], \n[[Monetary and Economic Community of Central Africa|CEMAC]], \n[[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], \n[[Franc Zone|FZ]], \n[[Group of 77|G-77]], \n[[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]], \n[[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], \n[[International Criminal Court|ICCt]], \n[[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions|ICFTU]], \n[[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], \n[[International Development Association|IDA]], \n[[Islamic Development Bank|IDB]], \n[[International Fund for Agricultural Development|IFAD]], \n[[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], \n[[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|IFRCS]], \n[[International Labour Organization|ILO]], \n[[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], \n[[International Criminal Police Organization|Interpol]], \n[[International Olympic Committee|IOC]], \n[[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], \n[[Multilateral Investment Geographic Agency|MIGA]], \n[[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], \n[[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]], \n[[United Nations Operation in Burundi|ONUB]], \n[[Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons|OPCW]], \n[[United Nations|UN]], \n[[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]], \n[[United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]], \n[[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]], \n[[United Nations Operation in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire|UNOCI]], \n[[United Nations University|UPU]], \n[[World Confederation of Labour|WCL]], \n[[World Health Organization|WHO]], \n[[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], \n[[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]], \n[[World Tourism Organization|WToO]], \n[[World Trade Organization|WTrO]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Chad topics}}\n{{Africa in topic|Politics of}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Politics Of Chad}}\n[[Category:Politics of Chad| ]]\n\n[[pt:Chade#Pol\u00edtica]]", "sha1": "phjeiun4elc10vwv0o1ketkkgkldvoj"}}, {"title": "Economy of Chad", "ns": "0", "id": "5333", "revision": {"id": "859129681", "parentid": "857463868", "timestamp": "2018-09-11T22:24:44Z", "contributor": {"username": "GL19GL61", "id": "25608111"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{CIA}}\n{{Infobox economy\n|country         = Chad\n|image           = Tailor in Chad.jpg\n|width           = 270\n|caption         = A tailor in [[Chad]]\n|currency        = [[Central African CFA franc]] (XAF)\n|fixed exchange  =\n|year            = Calendar year\n|organs          = [[African Union|AU]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]\n|gdp             = $11.02 billion (2012 est.)\n|growth                = 2.8% (2015), -6.3% (2016), <br> -3.0% (2017e), 2.6% (2018f) <ref name=\" World Bank\">{{cite web|url= https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/29801/9781464812576.pdf|title= World Bank forecasts for Chad, June 2018   (p. 153) |publisher=[[World Bank]]|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n|per capita      = $885.11 (2012 est.)\n|sectors         = [[agriculture]]: 52.7%;

About 85% of the population depends on [[agriculture]], including the herding of [[livestock]]. Of Africa's Francophone countries, Chad benefited least from the 50% devaluation of their currencies in January 1994.

Currently the main task of the Chadian military is to combat the various rebel forces inside the country.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Chadian Eland Mk7.jpg|thumb|left|Chadian [[Eland Mk7]] armoured car.]]\n{{Main|History of the military of Chad}}\nFrom independence through the period of the presidency of F\u00e9lix Malloum (1975\u201379), the official national army was known as the [[Chadian Armed Forces]] (Forces Arm\u00e9es Tchadiennes\u2014FAT). Composed mainly of soldiers from southern Chad, FAT had its roots in the army recruited by France and had military traditions dating back to World War I. FAT lost its status as the legal state army when Malloum's civil and military administration disintegrated in 1979. Although it remained a distinct military body for several years, FAT was eventually reduced to the status of a regional army representing the south.\n\nAfter Habr\u00e9 consolidated his authority and assumed the presidency in 1982, his victorious army, the [[Armed Forces of the North]] (Forces Arm\u00e9es du Nord\u2014FAN), became the nucleus of a new national army. The force was officially constituted in January 1983, when the various pro-Habr\u00e9 contingents were merged and renamed the [[Chadian National Armed Forces]] (Forces Arm\u00e9es Nationales Tchadiennes\u2014FANT).\n\nThe Military of Chad was dominated by members of [[Toubou]], [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]], [[Kanembu people|Kanembou]], [[Hadjerai]], and [[Massa (African ethnic group)|Massa]] ethnic groups during the presidency of [[Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9]]. Current [[Chad]]ian president [[Idriss D\u00e9by]], revolted and fled to the [[Sudan]], taking with him many Zaghawa and Hadjerai soldiers in 1989.\n\nChad's armed forces numbered about 36,000 at the end of the Habr\u00e9 regime, but swelled to an estimated 50,000 in the early days of D\u00e9by's rule. With [[France|French]] support, a reorganization of the armed forces was initiated early in 1991 with the goal of reducing its numbers and making its ethnic composition reflective of the country as a whole. Neither of these goals was achieved, and the military is still dominated by the Zaghawa.\n\nIn 2004, the government discovered that many of the soldiers it was paying did not exist and that there were only about 19,000 soldiers in the army, as opposed to the 24,000 that had been previously believed. Government crackdowns against the practice are thought to have been a factor in a failed military mutiny in May 2004.\n\nThe current conflict, in which the Chadian military is involved, is the civil war against Sudanese-backed rebels. Chad successfully manages to repel the rebel movements, but recently, with some losses (see [[Battle of N'Djamena (2008)]]). The army uses its [[artillery]] systems and tanks, but well-equipped insurgents have probably managed to destroy over 20 of Chad's 60 [[t-55]] tanks, and probably shot down a [[Mi-24 Hind]] [[gunship]], which bombed enemy positions near the border with [[Sudan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnBAN032261.html|title=Reuters - Rebels down a Chadian gunship|publisher=}}</ref> In November 2006 [[Libya]] supplied Chad with four [[Aermacchi SF.260]]W light attack planes.

The court's judgement was implemented without delay, the two parties signing as early as April 4 an agreement concerning the practical modalities for the implementation of the judgement. Monitored by international observers, the withdrawal of Libyan troops from the Strip began on April 15 and was completed by May 10. The formal and final transfer of the Strip from Libya to Chad took place on May 30, when the sides signed a joint declaration stating that the Libyan withdrawal had been effected.<ref>G.

Nigeria expelled several hundred thousand foreign workers, mostly from its oil industry, which faced drastic cuts as a result of declining world oil prices. At least 30,000 of those expelled were Chadians. Despite these strains, however, Nigerians had assisted in the halting process of achieving stability in Chad, and both nations reaffirmed their intention to maintain close ties.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|South Africa}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Chad has an embassy in [[Pretoria]].\n* South Africa has an embassy in N'Djamena.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Sudan}}||<!--Date started-->|| See [[Chad-Sudan relations]]\nOn December 24, 2005, Chad declared itself as in a \"state of belligerance\" with neighboring Sudan.

Although the [[Government of Chad]] and the [[Government of Sudan]] signed the [[Tripoli Agreement]] on February 8, 2006, officially ending hostilities, fighting continues.

However, Chad has not recognised the State of [[Israel]] since former [[Chadian President]] [[Fran\u00e7ois (Ngarta) Tombalbaye]] broke off relations in September 1972. President Habr\u00e9 hoped to pursue closer relations with Arab states as a potential opportunity to break out of his Chad's post-imperial dependence on France, and to assert Chad's unwillingness to serve as an arena for superpower rivalries. In addition, as a northern Christian, Habr\u00e9 represented a constituency that favored co-operation and solidarity with Arabs, both African, and Asian. For these reasons, he was expected to seize opportunities during the 1990s to pursue closer ties with the Arab World. In 1988, Chad recognized the [[State of Palestine]], which maintains a mission in N'Djamena.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Arab opinion on the Chadian-Libyan conflict over the Aozou Strip was divided. Several Arab states supported Libyan territorial claims to the Strip, among the most outspoken of which was Algeria, which provided training for anti-Habr\u00e9 forces, although most recruits for its training programs were from Nigeria or Cameroon, recruited and flown to Algeria by Libya. Lebanon's Progressive Socialist Party also sent troops to support Qadhafi's efforts against Chad in 1987. In contrast, numerous other Arab states opposed the Libyan actions, and expressed their desire to see the dispute over the Aozou Strip settled peacefully.

At the end of the 1980s, economic ties were still strong, and France provided development assistance in the form of loans and grants. It was no longer Chad's leading customer for [[Agriculture in Chad|agricultural exports]], but it continued to provide substantial military support.\n\nChad remained a member of the [[African Financial Community]] (Communaut\u00e9 Financi\u00e8re Africaine\u2014CFA), which linked the value of its currency, the [[CFA franc]], to the [[French franc]]. French private and government investors owned a substantial portion of Chad's industrial and financial institutions, and the French treasury backed the [[Bank of Central African States]] (Banque des Etats de l'Afrique Centrale\u2014BEAC), which served as the central bank for Chad and six other member nations. Chad's dependence on France declined slightly during [[Habr\u00e9]]'s tenure as president, in part because other foreign donors and investors returned as the war subsided and also because increased rainfall since 1985 improved food production. French official attitudes toward Chad had changed from the 1970s policies under the leadership of [[Giscard d'Estaing]] to those of the [[Mitterrand]] era of the 1980s. Economic, political, and strategic goals, which had emphasized maintaining French influence in Africa, exploiting Chad's natural resources, and bolstering [[francophone Africa]]'s status as a bulwark against the spread of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence, had been replaced by nominally [[anticolonialist]] attitudes. The [[French legislative election, 1981|election]] in France of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] government in 1981 had coincided with [[History of Chad#The Habr.C3.A9 era .281982.E2.80.9390.29|conditions of near-anarchy in Chad]], leading France's Socialist Party to reaffirm its ideological stance against high-profile intervention in Africa. Hoping to avoid a confrontation with [[Libya]], another important client state in the region, President Mitterrand limited French military involvement to a defense of the region surrounding [[N'Djamena]] in 1983 and 1984. Then, gradually increasing its commitment to reinforce Habr\u00e9's presidency, France once again increased its military activity in Chad.\n* Chad has an embassy in [[Paris]].<ref>[http://ambatchad-paris.org Embassy of Chad in Paris (in French)]</ref>\n* France has an embassy in [[N'djamena]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ambafrance-td.org|title=Ambassade de France au Tchad|work=ambafrance-td.org}}</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Germany}}||<!--Date started-->||\n\n* Chad has an embassy in [[Berlin]].\n* Germany has an embassy in N'Djamena.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Romania}}||<!--Date started-->|| See [[Chad\u2013Romania relations]]\n\nChad\u2013Romania relations were established on 15 July 1969.

For example, if a colloid consists of a solid phase dispersed in a liquid, the solid particles will not [[Molecular diffusion|diffuse]] through a membrane, whereas with a true solution the dissolved ions or molecules will diffuse through a membrane. Because of the size exclusion, the colloidal particles are unable to pass through the pores of an ultrafiltration membrane with a size smaller than their own dimension. The smaller the size of the pore of the ultrafiltration membrane, the lower the concentration of the dispersed colloidal particles remaining in the ultrafiltered liquid. The measured value of the concentration of a truly dissolved species will thus depend on the experimental conditions applied to separate it from the colloidal particles also dispersed in the liquid. This is particularly important for [[solubility]] studies of readily [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] species such as Al, Eu, Am, Cm, or [[organic matter]] [[complexation|complexing]] these species.\nColloids can be classified as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | Medium/phase\n! colspan=\"3\" | Dispersed phase\n|-\n!

They are also called reversible sols. '''Hydrophobic colloids''': These are opposite in nature to hydrophilic colloids. The colloid particles are repelled by water. They are also called irreversible sols.\n\nIn some cases, a colloid suspension can be considered a homogeneous mixture.

The charge of both the continuous and the dispersed phase, as well as the mobility of the phases are factors affecting this interaction.\n*[[van der Waals force]]s: This is due to interaction between two dipoles that are either permanent or induced. Even if the particles do not have a permanent dipole, fluctuations of the electron density gives rise to a temporary dipole in a particle. This temporary dipole induces a dipole in particles nearby. The temporary dipole and the induced dipoles are then attracted to each other. This is known as van der Waals force, and is always present (unless the refractive indexes of the dispersed and continuous phases are matched), is short-range, and is attractive.\n*[[Entropic force]]s: According to the second law of thermodynamics, a system progresses to a state in which entropy is maximized. This can result in effective forces even between hard spheres{{how|date=February 2017}}.\n*[[Steric effects|Steric forces]] between polymer-covered surfaces or in solutions containing non-adsorbing polymer can modulate interparticle forces, producing an additional steric repulsive force (which is predominantly entropic in origin) or an attractive [[depletion force]] between them. Such an effect is specifically searched for with tailor-made [[superplasticizer]]s developed to increase the workability of concrete and to reduce its [[water reducer|water content]].\n\n==Preparation==\nThere are two principal ways of preparation of colloids:<ref>Kopeliovich, Dmitri.  [http://www.substech.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=preparation_of_colloids Preparation of colloids]. substech.com</ref>\n* Dispersion of large particles or droplets to the colloidal dimensions by milling, [[Aerosol spray|spraying]], or application of shear (e.g., shaking, mixing, or [[High-shear mixer|high shear mixing]]).\n* Condensation of small dissolved molecules into larger colloidal particles by precipitation, condensation, or redox reactions. Such processes are used in the preparation of colloidal [[St\u00f6ber process|silica]] or [[colloidal gold|gold]].\n\n==Stabilization (peptization)==\nThe stability of a colloidal system is defined by particles remaining suspended in solution at equilibrium.\n\nStability is hindered by aggregation and sedimentation phenomena, which are driven by the colloid's tendency to reduce surface energy. Reducing the interfacial tension will stabilize the colloidal system by reducing this driving force. \n[[File:ColloidalStability.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Examples of a stable and of an unstable colloidal dispersion.]]\n\nAggregation is due to the sum of the interaction forces between particles.<ref>{{cite book|last=Israelachvili|first=Jacob N.|title=Intermolecular and Surface Forces|year=1991|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-391927-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vgyBJbtNOcoC&pg=PA281&lpg=PA281&dq=Intermolecular+and+Surface+Forces+1991+ISBN#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Menachem Elimelech |author2=John Gregory |author3=Xiadong Jia |author4=Richard Williams |title=Particle deposition and aggregation: measurement, modelling and simulation|year=1998|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-7506-7024-1}}</ref> If attractive forces (such as van der Waals forces) prevail over the repulsive ones (such as the electrostatic ones) particles aggregate in clusters.\n\nElectrostatic stabilization and steric stabilization are the two main mechanisms for stabilization against aggregation.\n* Electrostatic stabilization is based on the mutual repulsion of like electrical charges. In general, different phases have different charge affinities, so that an electrical double layer forms at any interface. Small particle sizes lead to enormous surface areas, and this effect is greatly amplified in colloids. In a stable colloid, mass of a dispersed phase is so low that its buoyancy or kinetic energy is too weak to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between charged layers of the dispersing phase.\n* Steric stabilization consists in covering the particles in polymers which prevents the particle to get close in the range of attractive forces.\nA combination of the two mechanisms is also possible (electrosteric stabilization). All the above-mentioned mechanisms for minimizing [[particle aggregation]] rely on the enhancement of the repulsive interaction forces.\n\nElectrostatic and steric stabilization do not directly address the sedimentation/floating problem.\n\nParticle sedimentation (and also floating, although this phenomenon is less common) arises from a difference in the density of the dispersed and of the continuous phase. The higher the difference in densities, the faster the particle settling.\n* The gel network stabilization represents the principal way to produce colloids stable to both aggregation and sedimentation.<ref name=\"Comba 2009 3717\u20133726\">{{cite journal|last=Comba|first=Silvia|author2=Sethi|title=Stabilization of highly concentrated suspensions of iron nanoparticles using shear-thinning gels of xanthan gum|journal=Water Research|date=August 2009|volume=43|issue=15|pages=3717\u20133726|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2009.05.046|pmid=19577785}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Cantrell|first=K.J.|author2=Kaplan, D.I.|author3=Gilmore, T.J.|title=Injection of colloidal Fe-0 particles in sand with shear-thinning fluids|journal=Journal of Environmental Engineering-Asce|year=1997|volume=123|issue=8|pages=786\u2013791|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(1997)123:8(786)|url=http://ascelibrary.org/eeo/resource/1/joeedu/v123/i8/p786_s1?isAuthorized=no}}</ref>\nThe method consists in adding to the colloidal suspension a polymer able to form a gel network and characterized by shear thinning properties. Examples of such substances are xanthan and guar gum.\n\n[[File:ComparisonStericStab-ShearThinningFluids2.png|thumb|upright=1.7|Steric and gel network stabilization.]]\n\nParticle settling is hindered by the stiffness of the polymeric matrix where particles are trapped.<ref name=\"Comba 2009 3717\u20133726\"/> In addition, the long polymeric chains can provide a steric or electrosteric stabilization to dispersed particles.\n\nThe rheological shear thinning properties find beneficial in the preparation of the suspensions and in their use, as the reduced viscosity at high shear rates facilitates deagglomeration, mixing and in general the flow of the suspensions.\n\n==Destabilisation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\nUnstable colloidal dispersions can form [[flocculation|flocs]] as the particles aggregate due to interparticle attractions. In this way photonic glasses can be grown. This can be accomplished by a number of different methods:\n*Removal of the electrostatic barrier that prevents aggregation of the particles. This can be accomplished by the addition of salt to a suspension or changing the pH of a suspension to effectively neutralise or \"screen\" the surface charge of the particles in suspension. This removes the repulsive forces that keep colloidal particles separate and allows for coagulation due to van der Waals forces.\n*Addition of a charged polymer flocculant. Polymer flocculants can bridge individual colloidal particles by attractive electrostatic interactions. For example, negatively charged colloidal silica or clay particles can be flocculated by the addition of a positively charged polymer.\n*Addition of non-adsorbed polymers called depletants that cause aggregation due to entropic effects.\n*Physical deformation of the particle (e.g., stretching) may increase the van der Waals forces more than stabilisation forces (such as electrostatic), resulting coagulation of colloids at certain orientations.\n\nUnstable colloidal suspensions of low-volume fraction form clustered liquid suspensions, wherein individual clusters of particles fall to the bottom of the suspension (or float to the top if the particles are less dense than the suspending medium) once the clusters are of sufficient size for the [[Brownian motion|Brownian forces]] that work to keep the particles in suspension to be overcome by gravitational forces. However, colloidal suspensions of higher-volume fraction form colloidal gels with viscoelastic properties. Viscoelastic colloidal gels, such as [[bentonite]] and [[toothpaste]], flow like liquids under shear, but maintain their shape when shear is removed. It is for this reason that toothpaste can be squeezed from a toothpaste tube, but stays on the toothbrush after it is applied.\n\n===Monitoring stability===\n[[File:MLS scan.gif|thumb|Measurement principle of multiple light scattering coupled with vertical scanning]]\n\nMultiple light scattering coupled with vertical scanning is the most widely used technique to monitor the dispersion state of a product, hence identifying and quantifying destabilisation phenomena.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0378-5173(03)00364-8|title=Systematic characterisation of oil-in-water emulsions for formulation design|year=2003|last1=Roland|first1=I|journal=International Journal of Pharmaceutics|volume=263|pages=85\u201394|pmid=12954183|last2=Piel|first2=G|last3=Delattre|first3=L|last4=Evrard|first4=B|issue=1\u20132}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1025017502379|year=2003|last1=Lemarchand|first1=Caroline|last2=Couvreur|first2=Patrick|last3=Besnard|first3=Madeleine|last4=Costantini|first4=Dominique|last5=Gref|first5=Ruxandra|journal=Pharmaceutical Research|volume=20|pages=1284\u201392|pmid=12948027|title=Novel polyester-polysaccharide nanoparticles|issue=8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0927-7757(98)00680-3|title=Characterisation of instability of concentrated dispersions by a new optical analyser: the TURBISCAN MA 1000|year=1999|last1=Mengual|first1=O|journal=Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects|volume=152|pages=111\u2013123 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Bru, P. |title= Particle sizing and characterisation|editor1=T.

When light is sent through the sample, it is backscattered by the particles / droplets. The backscattering intensity is directly proportional to the size and volume fraction of the dispersed phase. Therefore, local changes in concentration (''e.g.''[[Creaming (chemistry)|Creaming]] and [[Sedimentation]]) and global changes in size (''e.g.'' [[flocculation]], [[coalescence (chemistry)|coalescence]]) are detected and monitored.\n\n===Accelerating methods for shelf life prediction===\nThe kinetic process of destabilisation can be rather long (up to several months or even years for some products) and it is often required for the formulator to use further accelerating methods in order to reach reasonable development time for new product design. Thermal methods are the most commonly used and consists in increasing temperature to accelerate destabilisation (below critical temperatures of phase inversion or chemical degradation). Temperature affects not only the viscosity, but also interfacial tension in the case of non-ionic surfactants or more generally interactions forces inside the system. Storing a dispersion at high temperatures enables to simulate real life conditions for a product (e.g. tube of sunscreen cream in a car in the summer), but also to accelerate destabilisation processes up to 200 times.\nMechanical acceleration including vibration, [[centrifugation]] and agitation are sometimes used. They subject the product to different forces that pushes the particles / droplets against one another, hence helping in the film drainage. However, some emulsions would never coalesce in normal gravity, while they do under artificial gravity.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hDOS5OfL_pQC&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89|page=89|author= Salager, J-L |title=Pharmaceutical emulsions and suspensions|editor1=Fran\u00e7oise Nielloud |editor2=Gilberte Marti-Mestres |year=2000|isbn=978-0-8247-0304-2|publisher=CRC press}}</ref> Moreover, segregation of different populations of particles have been highlighted when using centrifugation and vibration.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/la802459u|title=Size Segregation in a Fluid-like or Gel-like Suspension Settling under Gravity or in a Centrifuge|year=2008|last1=Snabre|first1=Patrick|last2=Pouligny|first2=Bernard|journal=Langmuir|volume=24|pages=13338\u201347|pmid=18986182|issue=23}}</ref>\n\n==As a model system for atoms==\nIn [[physics]], colloids are an interesting model system for [[atom]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Manoharan| first=Vinothan N. |title=Colloidal matter: Packing, geometry, and entropy| journal=Science| volume=349| issue=6251 | pages=1253751| date=2015| doi=10.1126/science.1253751| pmid=26315444| url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/30410808/Manoharan-Science-2015-postprint.pdf?sequence=1}}</ref> Micrometre-scale colloidal particles are large enough to be observed by optical techniques such as [[confocal microscopy]].

Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the [[Earth|world]], from grilling food over an open fire to using [[electric stove]]s, to baking in various types of [[oven]]s, reflecting unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions and trends. The ways or types of cooking also depend on the skill and type of training an individual cook has. Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments. Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence of heat, such as in [[ceviche]], a traditional [[South American]] dish where [[fish]] is cooked with the acids in [[lemon]] or lime juice.\n\n[[Pyrolysis#Cooking|Preparing food with heat or fire]] is an activity unique to humans. It may have started around 2 million years ago, though archaeological evidence for it reaches no more than 1 million years ago.\n\nThe expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade, and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients. New inventions and technologies, such as the invention of [[pottery]] for holding and boiling water, expanded cooking techniques. Some modern cooks apply advanced scientific techniques to food preparation to further enhance the flavor of the dish served.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-new-spin-on-cooking |title=A New Spin on Cooking |author1=W.

The 1916 \"Food For Young Children\" became the first USDA guide to give specific dietary guidelines. Updated in the 1920s, these guides gave shopping suggestions for different-sized families along with a Depression Era revision which included four cost levels. In 1943, the USDA created the \"Basic Seven\" chart to make sure that people got the recommended nutrients. It included the first-ever Recommended Daily Allowances from the National Academy of Sciences. In 1956, the \"Essentials of an Adequate Diet\" brought recommendations which cut the number of groups that American school children would learn about down to four. In 1979, a guide called \"Food\" addressed the link between too much of certain foods and chronic diseases, but added \"fats, oils, and sweets\" to the four basic food groups.\n\n==Ingredients==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nMost ingredients in cooking are derived from [[organism|living organisms]]. Vegetables, fruits, grains and nuts as well as herbs and spices come from plants, while meat, eggs, and dairy products come from animals. Mushrooms and the yeast used in baking are kinds of [[Fungus|fungi]]. Cooks also use [[water]] and [[mineral]]s such as [[salt]]. Cooks can also use [[wine]] or [[Distilled beverage|spirits]].\n\nNaturally occurring ingredients contain various amounts of molecules called ''[[Protein (nutrient)|proteins]]'', ''[[carbohydrate]]s'' and ''[[fat]]s''. They also contain water and minerals. Cooking involves a manipulation of the chemical properties of these molecules.\n\n===Carbohydrates===\n{{Main article|Carbohydrate}}\nCarbohydrates include the common sugar, [[sucrose]] (table sugar), a [[disaccharide]], and such simple sugars as [[glucose]] (made by enzymatic splitting of sucrose) and [[fructose]] (from fruit), and [[starch]]es from sources such as cereal flour, rice, [[arrowroot]] and potato.\n\nThe interaction of heat and carbohydrate is complex. [[Polysaccharide|Long-chain sugars]] such as [[starch]] tend to break down into [[Monosaccharide|simpler sugars]] when cooked, while simple sugars can form [[syrup]]s. If sugars are heated so that all water of [[crystallisation]] is driven off, then [[caramelization]] starts, with the sugar undergoing thermal decomposition with the formation of [[carbon]], and other breakdown products producing [[caramel]]. Similarly, the heating of sugars and proteins elicits the [[Maillard reaction]], a basic flavor-enhancing technique.\n\nAn [[emulsion]] of starch with fat or water can, when gently heated, provide thickening to the dish being cooked. In [[European cuisine|European]] cooking, a mixture of butter and flour called a [[roux]] is used to thicken liquids to make stews or sauces. In Asian cooking, a similar effect is obtained from a mixture of rice or [[corn starch]] and water. These techniques rely on the properties of starches to create simpler mucilaginous [[saccharide]]s during cooking, which causes the familiar thickening of [[sauce]]s. This thickening will break down, however, under additional heat.\n\n===Fats===\n{{Main article|Fat}}\n[[File:Frying doughnuts.jpg|thumb|[[Doughnut]]s frying in oil]]\nTypes of fat include [[vegetable oil]]s, animal products such as butter and [[lard]], as well as fats from grains, including [[corn]] and [[flax]] oils. Fats are used in a number of ways in cooking and baking. To prepare [[stir fry|stir fries]], [[grilled cheese]] or [[pancake]]s, the pan or griddle is often coated with fat or oil. Fats are also used as an ingredient in baked goods such as cookies, cakes and pies. Fats can reach temperatures higher than the boiling point of water, and are often used to conduct high heat to other ingredients, such as in frying, deep frying or saut\u00e9ing. Fats are used to add flavor to food (e.g., butter or bacon fat), prevent food from sticking to pans and create a desirable texture.\n\n===Proteins===\n{{Main article|Protein (nutrient)}}\nEdible animal material, including [[muscle]], [[offal]], milk, [[egg (food)|eggs]] and [[egg white]]s, contains substantial amounts of protein. Almost all vegetable matter (in particular [[legume]]s and [[seed]]s) also includes proteins, although generally in smaller amounts. Mushrooms have high protein content. Any of these may be sources of [[essential amino acid]]s. When [[protein]]s are heated they become denatured (unfolded) and change texture. In many cases, this causes the structure of the material to become softer or more [[friable]] \u2013 meat becomes ''cooked'' and is more friable and less flexible. In some cases, proteins can form more rigid structures, such as the coagulation of [[albumen]] in egg whites. The formation of a relatively rigid but flexible matrix from egg white provides an important component in baking cakes, and also underpins many desserts based on [[meringue]].\n\n[[File:Cuisson des pates.jpg|thumb|Water is often used to cook foods such as [[noodle]]s.]]\n\n===Water===\n{{Main article|Water}}\nCooking often involves water, frequently present in other liquids, which is both added in order to immerse the substances being cooked (typically water, [[stock (food)|stock]] or wine), and released from the foods themselves. A favorite method of adding flavor to dishes is to save the liquid for use in other recipes.  Liquids are so important to cooking that the name of the cooking method used is often based on how the liquid is combined with the food, as in [[steaming]], [[simmer]]ing, [[boiling]], [[braising]], and [[blanching (cooking)|blanching]]. Heating liquid in an open container results in rapidly increased [[evaporation]], which [[concentrate]]s the remaining [[flavor]] and ingredients \u2013 this is a critical component of both [[stewing]] and sauce making.\n\n===Vitamins and minerals===\n[[File:November 15, 2012, The Right Cut (8223639251).jpg|thumb|Vegetables contain important vitamins and minerals]]\n{{Main article|Vitamin|Mineral (nutrient)}}\nVitamins and minerals are  required for normal [[metabolism]] but which the body cannot manufacture itself and which must therefore come from external sources. Vitamins come from several sources including fresh fruit and vegetables ([[Vitamin C]]), carrots, [[liver (food)|liver]] ([[Vitamin A]]), cereal bran, bread, liver (B vitamins), fish liver oil ([[Vitamin D]]) and fresh green vegetables ([[Vitamin K]]). Many minerals are also essential in small quantities including iron, [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[sodium chloride]] and [[sulfur]]; and in very small quantities copper, [[zinc]] and [[selenium]].

These include baking, roasting, frying, grilling, barbecuing, smoking, boiling, steaming and braising. A more recent innovation is microwaving. Various methods use differing levels of heat and moisture and vary in cooking time. The method chosen greatly affects the end result because some foods are more appropriate to some methods than others. Some major hot cooking techniques include:\n\n[[File:Sautee onions and peppers.jpg|thumb|right|A cook sautees onions and [[bell pepper|green pepper]]s in a [[frying pan|skillet]].]]\n\n;Roasting\n:[[Roasting]] \u2013 [[Barbecuing]] \u2013 [[Grilling]]/[[Broiling]] \u2013 [[Rotisserie]] \u2013 [[Searing]]\n;Baking\n:[[Baking]] \u2013 [[Blind Baking|Baking Blind]] \u2013 [[Flashbaking]]\n;Boiling\n:[[Boiling in cooking|Boiling]] \u2013 [[Blanching (cooking)|Blanching]] \u2013 [[Braising]] \u2013 [[Coddling]] \u2013 [[Double steaming]] \u2013 [[Infusion]] \u2013 [[Poaching (cooking)|Poaching]] \u2013 [[Pressure cooking]] \u2013 [[Simmering]] \u2013 [[Smothering (food)|Smothering]] \u2013 [[Steaming]] \u2013 [[Steeping]] \u2013 [[Stewing]] \u2013 [[Vacuum flask cooking]]\n;Frying\n:[[Frying|Fry]] \u2013 [[Deep frying]] \u2013 [[Hot salt frying]] \u2013 [[Hot sand frying]] \u2013 [[Pan frying]] \u2013 [[Pressure frying]] \u2013 [[Saut\u00e9ing]] \u2013 [[Stir frying]]\n;Steaming\n:[[Steaming]] works by boiling water continuously, causing it to vaporise into steam; the steam then carries heat to the nearby food, thus cooking the food.  By many it is considered a healthy form of cooking, holding nutrients within the vegetable or meat being cooked.\n: [[En papillote]] \u2013 The food is put into a pouch and then baked, allowing its own moisture to steam the food.\n;Smoking\n:[[Smoking (cooking)|Smoking]] is the process of flavoring, cooking, or preserving food by exposing it to smoke from burning or smoldering material, most often wood.\n\n==Health and safety==\n\n===Food safety===\n{{Main article|Food safety}}\nCooking can prevent many [[foodborne illness]]es that would otherwise occur if the food is eaten raw. When heat is used in the preparation of food, it can kill or inactivate harmful organisms, such as bacteria and viruses, as well as various parasites such as [[tapeworm]]s and ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''. [[Food poisoning]] and other illness from uncooked or poorly prepared food may be caused by bacteria such as [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|pathogenic strains]] of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'' and ''[[Campylobacter]]'', viruses such as [[norovirus]]es, and [[protozoa]] such as ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]''. Bacteria, viruses and parasites may be introduced through salad, meat that is uncooked or done [[Doneness|rare]], and unboiled water.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/foodborne-illnesses|title= Foodborne Illnesses |work=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] effect of cooking depends on temperature, cooking time, and technique used. Some [[food spoilage]] bacteria such as ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'' or ''[[Bacillus cereus]]'' can form spores that survive boiling, which then germinate and regrow after the food has cooled. This makes it unsafe to reheat cooked food more than once.<ref>[http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/complete_safefood.pdf Safe Food Australia \u2013 A Guide to the Food Safety Standards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922234817/http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/complete_safefood.pdf |date=22 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\nCooking increases the digestibility of many foods which are inedible or poisonous when raw. For example, raw cereal grains are hard to digest, while [[kidney bean]]s are toxic when raw or improperly cooked due to the presence of [[phytohaemagglutinin]], which is inactivated by cooking for at least ten minutes at {{convert|100|C}}.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Noah ND, Bender AE, Reaidi GB, Gilbert RJ |title=News, Notes, And Epidemiology |journal=Br Med J |volume=281 |issue=6234 |pages=236\u2013237 |date=July 1980 |pmid=7407532 |doi=10.1136/bmj.281.6234.235 |pmc=1713670}}</ref>\n\nFood safety depends on the safe preparation, handling, and storage of food. Food spoilage bacteria proliferate in the \"[[Danger zone (food safety)|Danger zone]]\" temperature range from {{convert|40|to|140|F|C}}, food therefore should not be stored in this temperature range. Washing of hands and surfaces, especially when handling different meats, and keeping raw food separate from cooked food to avoid cross-contamination, are good practices in food preparation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Factsheets/Basics_for_Handling_Food_Safely/index.asp |title=Basics for Handling Food Safely |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=1 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040928210429/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/Basics_for_Handling_Food_Safely/index.asp |archivedate=28 September 2004 }}</ref> Foods prepared on plastic cutting boards may be less likely to harbor bacteria than wooden ones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/health/foodsafety/az1076.html|title=Cutting Boards (Plastic Versus Wood)|publisher=Cooperative Extension, College of Agriculture & Life Sciences, the University of Arizona|work=Food Safety, Preparation and Storage Tips|year=1998|accessdate=21 June 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613074257/http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/health/foodsafety/az1076.html |archivedate=13 June 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"ReluctantGourmet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/cutting_board.htm|title=Cutting Boards \u2013 wood or plastic?|work=ReluctantGourmet.com|accessdate=21 June 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702142255/http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/cutting_board.htm|archivedate=2 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Washing and [[Disinfection|disinfecting]] cutting boards, especially after use with raw meat, poultry, or seafood, reduces the risk of contamination.<ref name=\"ReluctantGourmet\"/>\n\n===Effects on nutritional content of food===\n{{See also|Raw foodism}}\n[[File:Rawtomatopasta1.jpg|thumb|A raw [[tomato sauce]] with [[olive]]s, [[celery]], [[spinach]] and [[walnut]]s on [[zucchini]] noodles.]]\nProponents of [[raw foodism]] argue that cooking food increases the risk of some of the detrimental effects on food or health. They point out that during cooking of vegetables and fruit containing [[vitamin C]], the vitamin elutes into the cooking water and becomes degraded through oxidation. Peeling vegetables can also substantially reduce the vitamin C content, especially in the case of potatoes where most vitamin C is in the skin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potato2008.org/en/potato/factsheets.html|title=Potato, nutrition and diet - International Year of the Potato 2008|publisher=}}</ref> However, research has shown that in the specific case of [[carotenoid]]s a greater proportion is absorbed from cooked vegetables than from raw vegetables.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nGerman research in 2003 showed significant benefits in reducing breast cancer risk when large amounts of raw vegetable matter are included in the diet.

Countless card games exist, including families of related games (such as [[poker]]). A small number of card games played with traditional decks have formally standardized rules, but most are folk games whose rules vary by region, culture, and person. Games using playing cards exploit the fact that cards are individually identifiable from one side only, so that each player knows only the cards he holds and not those held by anyone else. For this reason card games are often characterized as games of chance or \u201cimperfect information\u201d\u2014as distinct from games of strategy or \u201cperfect information,\u201d where the current position is fully visible to all players throughout the game. <ref>{{cite web|title=Card Game|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/card-game|author= David Parlett|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |date=Sep 30, 2013}}</ref> \n\nMany games that are not generally placed in the family of card games do in fact use cards for some aspect of their gameplay. Similarly, some games that are placed in the card game genre involve a board. The distinction is that the gameplay of a card game chiefly depends on the use of the cards by players (the board is simply a guide for scorekeeping or for card placement), while [[board game]]s (the principal non-card game genre to use cards) generally focus on the players' positions on the board, and use the cards for some secondary purpose.\n\n==Playing cards==\n{{main|Playing card}}\n[[Image:Ming Dynasty playing card, c. 1400.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.75|A [[Chinese playing card]] dated c. 1400 AD, [[Ming dynasty]]]]\n\nA card game is played with a ''deck'' or ''pack'' of [[playing card]]s which are identical in size and shape.

[[Tarot card games]] are still played with (subsets of) these decks in parts of Central Europe. A full tarot deck contains 14 cards in each suit; low cards labeled 1\u201310, and court cards {{lang|fr|valet}} (jack), {{lang|fr|chevalier}} (cavalier/knight), {{lang|fr|dame}} (queen), and {{lang|fr|roi}} (king), plus the fool or excuse card, and 21 trump cards. In the 18th century the card images of the traditional Italian tarot decks became popular in [[cartomancy]] and evolved into \"esoteric\" decks used primarily for the purpose; today most tarot decks sold in North America are the occult type, and are closely associated with fortune telling. In Europe, \"playing tarot\" decks remain popular for games, and have evolved since the 18th century to use regional suits (spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs in France; leaves, hearts, bells and acorns in Germany) as well as other familiar aspects of the Anglo-American deck such as corner card indices and \"stamped\" card symbols for non-court cards. Decks differ regionally based on the number of cards needed to play the games; the French tarot consists of the \"full\" 78 cards, while Germanic, Spanish and Italian Tarot variants remove certain values (usually low suited cards) from the deck, creating a deck with as few as 32 cards.\n\nThe French suits were introduced around 1480 and, in France, mostly replaced the earlier Latin suits of ''swords'', ''clubs'', ''cups'' and ''coins''.<ref name=parlett>*{{Citation |last=Parlett |first=David |title=The Oxford guide to card games: a historical survey |year=1990 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-214165-1}}</ref>{{rp|43}} (which are still common in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries as well as in some northern regions of Italy)<ref name=parlett/>{{rp|30f}} The suit symbols, being very simple and single-color, could be stamped onto the playing cards to create a deck, thus only requiring special full-color card art for the court cards. This drastically simplifies the production of a deck of cards versus the traditional Italian deck, which used unique full-color art for each card in the deck. The French suits became popular in English playing cards in the 16th century (despite historic animosity between France and England), and from there were introduced to British colonies including North America. The rise of Western culture has led to the near-universal popularity and availability of French-suited playing cards even in areas with their own regional card art.\n\nIn Japan, a distinct 48-card [[hanafuda]] deck is popular. It is derived from 16th-century Portuguese decks, after undergoing a long evolution driven by laws enacted by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] attempting to ban the use of playing cards\n\nThe best-known deck internationally is the 52-card Anglo-American deck used for such games as [[poker]] and [[contract bridge]]. It contains one card for each unique combination of thirteen ''ranks'' and the four French ''[[suit (cards)|suits]]'' ''spades'', ''hearts'', ''diamonds'', and ''clubs''. The ranks (from highest to lowest in bridge and poker) are ''ace'', ''king'', ''queen'', ''jack'' (or ''knave''), and the numbers from ''ten'' down to ''two'' (or ''deuce''). The trump cards and ''knight'' cards from the French playing tarot are not included.\n\nOriginally the term ''knave'' was more common than \"jack\"; the card had been called a jack as part of the terminology of [[All Fours (game)|All-Fours]] since the 17th century, but the word was considered vulgar. (Note the exclamation by Estella in [[Charles Dickens]]'s novel ''[[Great Expectations]]'': \"He calls the knaves, Jacks, this boy!\") However, because the card abbreviation for knave (\"Kn\") was so close to that of the king, it was very easy to confuse them, especially after suits and rankings were moved to the corners of the card in order to enable people to fan them in one hand and still see all the values. (The earliest known deck to place suits and rankings in the corner of the card is from 1693, but these cards did not become common until after 1864 when Hart reintroduced them along with the knave-to-jack change.) However, books of card games published in the third quarter of the 19th century evidently still referred to the \"knave\", and the term with this definition is still recognized in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nBased on the association of card games and gambling, [[Pope Benedict XIV]] banned card games on October 17, 1750.<ref name=\"Gazette\">Dublin Gazette (1750). ''The Dublin Gazette'' (Number 26). Dublin: Richard James and John Butler, 1750. Context: \"In the Edict lately published against all Games on the Cards, it is enacted, that the Penalty on Delinquents shall be a Fine of 500 Crowns ; but if any Persons of high Rank or Distinction are convicted of suffering or promoting Gaming of that Kind in their house, they shall incur the Pope's Indignation, and be liable to such arbitrary Punishment as to his'Holiness shall seem meet.\"</ref>\n\nSince the 19th century some decks have been specially printed for certain games.  Old Maid, Phase 10, Rook, and Uno are examples of games that can be played with one or more 52-card decks but are usually played with custom decks. Cards play an important role in board games like [[Risk (game)|Risk]] and [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]].\n\n==Typical structure of card games==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Number and association of players===\n[[Image:Paul C\u00e9zanne, 1892-95, Les joueurs de carte (The Card Players), 60 x 73 cm, oil on canvas, Courtauld Institute of Art, London.jpg|thumb|''The Card Players - a painting by [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], 1895.'']]\n[[File:Card game, circa 1930s.jpg|thumb|Historically, card games such as [[whist]] and [[contract bridge]] were opportunities for quiet socializing, as shown in this 1930s [[magic lantern]] slide photo taken in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]].]]\nAny specific card game imposes restrictions on the number of players. The most significant dividing lines run between one-player games and two-player games, and between two-player games and multi-player games. Card games for one player are known as ''solitaire'' or ''patience'' card games. (See [[list of solitaire card games]].) Generally speaking, they are in many ways special and atypical, although some of them have given rise to two- or multi-player games such as [[Spite and Malice]].\n\nIn card games for two players, usually not all cards are distributed to the players, as they would otherwise have perfect information about the game state. Two-player games have always been immensely popular and include some of the most significant card games such as [[piquet]], [[bezique]], [[sixty-six (card game)|sixty-six]], [[klaberjass]], [[gin rummy]] and [[cribbage]]. Many multi-player games started as two-player games that were adapted to a greater number of players. For such adaptations a number of non-obvious choices must be made beginning with the choice of a game orientation.\n\nOne way of extending a two-player game to more players is by building two teams of equal size. A common case is four players in two fixed partnerships, sitting crosswise as in [[whist]] and [[contract bridge]]. Partners sit opposite to each other and cannot see each other's hands. If communication between the partners is allowed at all, then it is usually restricted to a specific list of permitted signs and signals. 17th-century French partnership games such as [[\u00c9cart\u00e9|triomphe]] were special in that partners sat next to each other and were allowed to communicate freely so long as they did not exchange cards or play out of order.\n\nAnother way of extending a two-player game to more players is as a ''cut-throat'' game, in which all players fight on their own, and win or lose alone. Most cut-throat card games are ''round games'', i.e. they can be played by any number of players starting from two or three, so long as there are enough cards for all.\n\nFor some of the most interesting games such as [[ombre]], [[Tarot card games|tarot]] and [[skat (card game)|skat]], the associations between players change from hand to hand. Ultimately players all play on their own, but for each hand, some game mechanism divides the players into two teams. Most typically these are ''solo games'', i.e. games in which one player becomes the soloist and has to achieve some objective against the others, who form a team and win or lose all their points jointly. But in games for more than three players, there may also be a mechanism that selects two players who then have to play against the others.\n\n===Direction of play===\nThe players of a card game normally form a circle around a table or other space that can hold cards. The ''game orientation'' or ''direction of play'', which is only relevant for three or more players, can be either [[clockwise]] or anticlockwise. It is the direction in which various roles in the game proceed. Most regions have a traditional direction of play, such as:\n*Anticlockwise in most of Asia and in Latin America.\n*Clockwise in North America and Australia.\nEurope is roughly divided into a clockwise area in the north and a counterclockwise area in the south. The boundary runs between [[England]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]] (mostly), [[Slovakia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]] ([[clockwise]]) and [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Slovenia]], [[Balkans]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] (anticlockwise).\n\nGames that originate in a region with a strong preference are often initially played in the original direction, even in regions that prefer the opposite direction. For games that have official rules and are played in tournaments, the direction of play is often prescribed in those rules.\n\n===Determining who deals===\nMost games have some form of asymmetry between players. The roles of players are normally expressed in terms of the ''dealer'', i.e. the player whose task it is to shuffle the cards and distribute them to the players. Being the dealer can be a (minor or major) advantage or disadvantage, depending on the game. Therefore, after each played hand, the deal normally passes to the next player according to the game orientation.\n\nAs it can still be an advantage or disadvantage to be the first dealer, there are some standard methods for determining who is the first dealer. A common method is by cutting, which works as follows. One player shuffles the deck and places it on the table. Each player lifts a packet of cards from the top, reveals its bottom card, and returns it to the deck. The player who reveals the highest (or lowest) card becomes dealer. In case of a tie, the process is repeated by the tied players. For some games such as whist this process of cutting is part of the official rules, and the hierarchy of cards for the purpose of cutting (which need not be the same as that used otherwise in the game) is also specified. But in general any method can be used, such as tossing a coin in case of a two-player game, drawing cards until one player draws an ace, or rolling dice.\n\n===Hands, rounds and games===\n<!-- [[Elder hand]], [[Eldest hand]] and [[Hand (card games)]] redirect here. Please update these 3 redirects, if the title of this Section changes. -->\nA ''hand'' is a unit of the game that begins with the dealer shuffling and dealing the cards as described below, and ends with the players scoring and the next dealer being determined. The set of cards that each player receives and holds in his or her hands is also known as that player's hand.\n\nThe hand is over when the players have finished playing their hands. Most often this occurs when one player (or all) has no cards left. The player who sits after the dealer in the direction of play is known as [[eldest hand]] (or in two-player games as [[elder hand]]) or [[Forehand (card games)|forehand]]. A ''game round'' consists of as many hands as there are players. After each hand, the deal is passed on in the direction of play, i.e. the previous eldest hand becomes the new dealer. Normally players score points after each hand. A game may consist of a fixed number of rounds. Alternatively it can be played for a fixed number of points. In this case it is over with the hand in which a player reaches the target score.\n\n===Shuffling===\n{{main|Shuffling}}\nShuffling is the process of bringing the cards of a pack into a random order. There are a large number of techniques with various advantages and disadvantages. ''Riffle shuffling'' is a method in which the deck is divided into two roughly equal-sized halves that are bent and then released, so that the cards interlace. Repeating this process several times randomizes the deck well, but the method is harder to learn than some others and may damage the cards. The ''overhand shuffle'' and the ''Hindu shuffle'' are two techniques that work by taking batches of cards from the top of the deck and reassembling them in the opposite order. They are easier to learn but must be repeated more often. A method suitable for small children consists in spreading the cards on a large surface and moving them around before picking up the deck again. This is also the most common method for shuffling tiles such as dominoes.\n\nFor casino games that are played for large sums it is vital that the cards be properly randomised, but for many games this is less critical, and in fact player experience can suffer when the cards are shuffled too well. The official [[skat (card game)|skat]] rules stipulate that the cards are ''shuffled well'', but according to a decision of the German skat court, a one-handed player should ask another player to do the shuffling, rather than use a [[shuffling machine]], as it would shuffle the cards ''too'' well. French [[belote]] rules go so far as to prescribe that the deck never be shuffled between hands.\n\n===Deal===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Spit (card game)]] -->\n\nThe dealer takes all of the cards in the pack, arranges them so that they are in a uniform stack, and [[shuffle]]s them. In strict play, the dealer then offers the deck to the previous player (in the sense of the game direction) for ''[[cut (playing cards)|cutting]]''. If the deal is clockwise, this is the player to the dealer's right; if counterclockwise, it is the player to the dealer's left. The invitation to cut is made by placing the pack, face downward, on the table near the player who is to cut: who then lifts the upper portion of the pack clear of the lower portion and places it alongside. (Normally the two portions have about equal size. Strict rules often indicate that each portion must contain a certain minimum number of cards, such as three or five.) The formerly lower portion is then replaced on top of the formerly upper portion. Instead of cutting, one may also knock on the deck to indicate that one trusts the dealer to have shuffled fairly.\n\nThe actual ''deal'' (distribution of cards) is done in the direction of play, beginning with eldest hand. The dealer holds the pack, face down, in one hand, and removes cards from the top of it with his or her other hand to distribute to the players, placing them face down on the table in front of the players to whom they are dealt. The cards may be dealt one at a time, or in batches of more than one card; and either the entire pack or a determined number of cards are dealt out. The undealt cards, if any, are left face down in the middle of the table, forming the ''stock'' (also called the talon, widow, skat or kitty depending on the game and region).\n\nThroughout the shuffle, cut, and deal, the dealer should prevent the players from seeing the faces of any of the cards. The players should not try to see any of the faces. Should a player accidentally see a card, other than one's own, proper etiquette would be to admit this. It is also dishonest to try to see cards as they are dealt, or to take advantage of having seen a card. Should a card accidentally become exposed, (visible to all), any player can demand a redeal (all the cards are gathered up, and the shuffle, cut, and deal are repeated) or that the card be replaced randomly into the deck (\"burning\" it) and a replacement dealt from the top to the player who was to receive the revealed card.\n\nWhen the deal is complete, all players pick up their cards, or \"hand\", and hold them in such a way that the faces can be seen by the holder of the cards but not the other players, or vice versa depending on the game. It is helpful to fan one's cards out so that if they have corner indices all their values can be seen at once. In most games, it is also useful to sort one's hand, rearranging the cards in a way appropriate to the game. For example, in a [[trick-taking game]] it may be easier to have all one's cards of the same suit together, whereas in a [[rummy]] game one might sort them by rank or by potential combinations.\n\n==Rules==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n\nA new card game starts in a small way, either as someone's invention, or as a modification of an existing game. Those playing it may agree to change the rules as they wish. The rules that they agree on become the \"house rules\" under which they play the game. A set of house rules may be accepted as valid by a group of players wherever they play, as it may also be accepted as governing all play within a particular house, caf\u00e9, or club.\n\nWhen a game becomes sufficiently popular, so that people often play it with strangers, there is a need for a generally accepted set of rules. This need is often met when a particular set of house rules becomes generally recognized. For example, when [[Whist]] became popular in 18th-century [[England]], players in the [[Portland Club (London)|Portland Club]] agreed on a set of house rules for use on its premises. Players in some other clubs then agreed to follow the \"Portland Club\" rules, rather than go to the trouble of codifying and printing their own sets of rules. The Portland Club rules eventually became generally accepted throughout England and Western cultures.\n\nThere is nothing static or \"official\" about this process. For the majority of games, there is no one set of universal rules by which the game is played, and the most common ruleset is no more or less than that. Many widely played card games, such as [[Canasta]] and [[Pinochle]], have no official regulating body. The most common ruleset is often determined by the most popular distribution of rulebooks for card games. Perhaps the original compilation of popular playing card games was collected by [[Edmund Hoyle]], a self-made authority on many popular parlor games. The [[U.S. Playing Card Company]] now owns the eponymous Hoyle brand, and publishes a series of rulebooks for various families of card games that have largely standardized the games' rules in countries and languages where the rulebooks are widely distributed. However, players are free to, and often do, invent \"house rules\" to supplement or even largely replace the \"standard\" rules.\n\nIf there is a sense in which a card game can have an \"official\" set of rules, it is when that card game has an \"official\" governing body. For example, the rules of tournament [[contract bridge|bridge]] are governed by the World Bridge Federation, and by local bodies in various countries such as the [[American Contract Bridge League]] in the U.S., and the [[English Bridge Union]] in England. The rules of [[Skat (card game)|skat]] are governed by The [[International Skat Players Association]] and, in [[Germany]],  by the ''Deutscher Skatverband'' which publishes the ''Skatordnung''. The rules of [[French tarot]] are governed by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Tarot]]. The rules of [[Poker]]'s variants are largely traditional, but enforced by the [[World Series of Poker]] and the [[World Poker Tour]] organizations which sponsor tournament play. Even in these cases, the rules must only be followed exactly at games sanctioned by these governing bodies; players in less formal settings are free to implement agreed-upon supplemental or substitute rules at will.\n\n===Rule infractions===\nAn infraction is any action which is against the rules of the game, such as playing a card when it is not one's turn to play or the accidental exposure of a card, informally known as \"bleeding.\"\n\nIn many official sets of rules for card games, the rules specifying the penalties for various infractions occupy more pages than the rules specifying how to play correctly. This is tedious, but necessary for games that are played seriously. Players who intend to play a card game at a high level generally ensure before beginning that all agree on the penalties to be used. When playing privately, this will normally be a question of agreeing house rules. In a tournament there will probably be a tournament director who will enforce the rules when required and arbitrate in cases of doubt.\n\nIf a player breaks the rules of a game deliberately, this is cheating. Most card players would refuse to play cards with a known cheat. The rest of this section is therefore about accidental infractions, caused by ignorance, clumsiness, inattention, etc.\n\nAs the same game is played repeatedly among a group of players, precedents build up about how a particular infraction of the rules should be handled. For example, \"Sheila just led a card when it wasn't her turn. Last week when Jo did that, we agreed ... etc.\" Sets of such precedents tend to become established among groups of players, and to be regarded as part of the house rules. Sets of house rules become formalized, as described in the previous section. Therefore, for some games, there is a \"proper\" way of handling infractions of the rules. But for many games, without governing bodies, there is no standard way of handling infractions.\n\nIn many circumstances, there is no need for special rules dealing with what happens after an infraction. As a general principle, the person who broke a rule should not benefit by it, and the other players should not lose by it. An exception to this may be made in games with fixed partnerships, in which it may be felt that the partner(s) of the person who broke a rule should also not benefit. The penalty for an accidental infraction should be as mild as reasonable, consistent with there being no possible benefit to the person responsible.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Preferans (card game) in Croatia.2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Preferans]], a [[trick-taking game|trick-taking card game]] version popular in [[Croatia]]]]\n\n===Trick-taking games===\n{{See also|List of trick-taking games}}\nThe object of a [[trick-taking game]] is based on the play of multiple rounds, or tricks, in each of which each player plays a single card from their hand, and based on the values of played cards one player wins or \"takes\" the trick. The specific object varies with each game and can include taking as many tricks as possible, taking as many scoring cards within the tricks won as possible, taking as few tricks (or as few penalty cards) as possible, taking a particular trick in the hand, or taking an exact number of tricks. [[Contract bridge|Bridge]], [[Whist]], [[Euchre]], [[500 (card game)|500]], [[Spades]], and the various [[Tarot card games]] are popular examples.\n\n===Matching games===\n{{see also|Category:Matching card games}}\nThe object of [[Rummy]], and various other melding or matching games, is to acquire the required groups of matching cards before an opponent can do so. In [[Rummy]], this is done through drawing and discarding, and the groups are called melds. [[Mahjong]] is a very similar game played with tiles instead of cards. Non-Rummy examples of match-type games generally fall into the \"fishing\" genre and include the children's games [[Go Fish]] and [[Old Maid]].\n\n===Shedding games===\n{{see also|Category:Shedding-type card games}}\nIn a [[Shedding-type game|shedding game]], players start with a hand of cards, and the object of the game is to be the first player to discard all cards from one's hand. Common shedding games include [[Crazy Eights]] (commercialized by Mattel as [[Uno (card game)|Uno]]) and [[Daihinmin]]. Some matching-type games are also shedding-type games; some variants of Rummy such as [[Phase 10]], [[Rummikub]], the bluffing game [[I Doubt It]], and the children's game [[Old Maid]], fall into both categories.\n\n===Accumulating games===\n{{see also|Category:Accumulating-type card games}}\nThe object of an accumulating game is to acquire all cards in the deck. Examples include most [[War (card game)|War]] type games, and games involving slapping a discard pile such as [[Slapjack]]. [[Egyptian Ratscrew]] has both of these features.\n\n===Fishing games===\n{{see also|Category:Fishing card games}}\nIn fishing games, cards from the hand are played against cards in a layout on the table, capturing table cards if they match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pagat.com/fishing/ |title=Card Games: Fishing Games |publisher=Pagat.com |date=2011-03-06 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}</ref>  Fishing games are popular in many nations, including China, where there are many diverse fishing games.  [[Scopa]] is considered one of the national card games of Italy.  [[Cassino (card game)|Cassino]] is the only fishing game to be widely played in English-speaking countries. [[Zwickern|Zwicker]] has been described as a \"simpler and jollier version of Cassino\", played in Germany.<ref> Parlett, David. ''The Penguin Book of Card Games''. London: Penguin (2008), p. 405. {{ISBN|978-0-141-03787-5}}.</ref> [[Seep (card game)|Seep]] is a classic Indian fishing card game mainly popular in northern parts of India. [[Tablanet]] (tabli\u0107) is fishing-style game popular in [[Balkans]].\n\n===Comparing games===\n{{see also|Category:Comparing card games}}\nComparing card games are those where hand values are compared to determine the winner, also known as \"vying\" or \"showdown\" games. [[Poker]], [[blackjack]], and [[Baccarat (card game)|baccarat]] are examples of comparing card games. As seen, nearly all of these games are designed as gambling games.\n\n===Solitaire (Patience) games===\n{{See also|Solitaire|Category:Solitaire card games}}\nSolitaire games are designed to be played by one player. Most games begin with a specific layout of cards, called a tableau, and the object is then either to construct a more elaborate final layout, or to clear the tableau and/or the draw pile or ''stock'' by moving all cards to one or more \"discard\" or \"foundation\" piles.\n\n===Drinking card games===\n{{See also|Category:Drinking card games}}\nDrinking card games are [[drinking game]]s using cards, in which the object in playing the game is either to drink or to force others to drink. Many games are simply ordinary card games with the establishment of \"drinking rules\"; [[President (card game)|President]], for instance, is virtually identical to [[Daihinmin]] but with additional rules governing drinking. Poker can also be played using a number of drinks as the wager. Another game often played as a drinking game is [[Toepen]], quite popular in the [[Netherlands]]. Some card games are designed specifically to be played as drinking games.\n\n===Multi-genre games===\nMany card games borrow elements from more than one type. The most common combination is matching and shedding, as in some variants of Rummy, [[Old Maid]], and [[Go Fish]]. However, many multi-genre games involve different stages of play for each hand. The most common multi-stage combination is a \"trick-and-meld\" game, such as [[Pinochle]] or [[Belote]]. Other multi-stage, multi-genre games include [[Poke (game)|Poke]], [[Flaps (card game)|Flaps]], [[Skitgubbe]], and [[Tichu]].\n\n===Collectible card games (CCGs)===\n{{see also|Collectible card game|List of collectible card games|Category:Collectible card games}}\nCollectible card games (CCG) are proprietary playing card games. CCGs are games of strategy between two players though multiplayer exists too. Both have their own personally built deck constructed from a very large pool of individually unique cards in the commercial market. The cards have different effects, costs, and art. Obtaining the different cards makes the game a collectible and cards are sold or traded on the secondary market. ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' are well-known collectible card games.\n\n===Casino or gambling card games===\n{{See also|casino|gambling}}\nThese games revolve around wagers of money. Though virtually any game in which there are winning and losing outcomes can be wagered on, these games are specifically designed to make the betting process a strategic part of the game. Some of these games involve players betting against each other, such as poker, while in others, like [[blackjack]], players wager against the house.\n\n====Poker games====\n{{see also|List of poker variants|Category:Poker variants}}\n[[Poker]] is a family of gambling games in which players bet into a pool, called the pot, value of which changes as the game progresses that the value of the hand they carry will beat all others according to the [[list of poker hands|ranking system]]. Variants largely differ on how cards are dealt and the methods by which players can improve a hand. For many reasons, including its age and its popularity among Western militaries, it is one of the most universally known card games in existence.\n\n===Other card games===\n{{see also|Category:Dedicated deck card games}}\nMany other card games have been designed and published on a commercial or amateur basis. In some cases, the game uses the standard 52-card deck, but the object is unique. In [[Eleusis (game)|Eleusis]], for example, players play single cards, and are told whether the play was legal or illegal, in an attempt to discover the underlying rules made up by the dealer.\n\nMost of these games however typically use a specially made deck of cards designed specifically for the game (or variations of it). The decks are thus usually proprietary, but may be created by the game's players. [[Uno (card game)|Uno]], [[Phase 10]], [[Set (game)|Set]], and [[1000 Blank White Cards]] are popular dedicated-deck card games; 1000 Blank White Cards is unique in that the cards for the game are designed by the players of the game while playing it; there is no commercially available deck advertised as such.\n\n====Simulation card games====\nA deck of either customised dedicated cards or a standard deck of playing cards with assigned meanings is used to simulate the actions of another activity, for example [[card football]].\n\n===Fictional card games===\n{{see also|List of fictional games#Card games}}\nMany games, including card games, are fabricated by [[science fiction author]]s and screenwriters to distance a culture depicted in the story from present-day Western culture. They are commonly used as filler to depict background activities in an atmosphere like a bar or rec room, but sometimes the drama revolves around the play of the game. Some of these games become real card games as the holder of the intellectual property develops and markets a suitable deck and ruleset for the game, while others, such as \"Exploding Snap\" from the [[Harry Potter]] franchise, lack sufficient descriptions of rules, or depend on cards or other hardware that are infeasible or physically impossible.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Games}}\n* [[Game of chance]]\n* [[Game of skill]]\n* [[R.

This form of cross-stitch is also called '''counted cross-stitch''' in order to distinguish it from other forms of cross-stitch.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Amazing Stitching Handbook for Kids|last=Nicholas|first=Kristin|publisher=C&T Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-1-60705-973-8|location=Concord, CA|pages=33}}</ref> Sometimes cross-stitch is done on designs printed on the fabric ('''stamped cross-stitch'''); the stitcher simply stitches over the printed pattern.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fabric Paper Thread|last=Sutcliffe|first=Kristen|publisher=C&T Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1-60705-715-4|location=Concord, CA|pages=138}}</ref> Cross-stitch is also executed on easily countable fabric called [[aida cloth]] but the threads are not actually counted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Judith Baker Montano's Essential Stitch Guide|last=Baker Montano|first=Judith|publisher=C&T Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-1-61745-077-8|location=Concord, CA|pages=9}}</ref>\n\nFabrics used in cross-stitch include linen, aida, and mixed-content fabrics called 'evenweave' such as jobelan. All cross-stitch fabrics are technically \"evenweave\" as the term refers to the fact that the fabric is woven to make sure that there are the same number of threads in an inch both left to right and top to bottom (vertically and horizontally). Fabrics are categorized by threads per inch (referred to as 'count'), which can range from 11 to 40 count. Aida fabric has a lower count because it is made with two threads grouped together for ease of stitching. Cross-stitch projects are worked from a gridded pattern and can be used on any count fabric, the count of the fabric determines the size of the finished stitching if the stitchers counts and stitches over 2 threads. The finished stitching size is reduced by half if the stitcher counts and stitches over one fabric thread. These methods are commonly referred to as \"2 over 2\"\u2014i.e. 2 embroidery threads used to stitch over 2 fabric threads; and \"1 over 1\"\u2014i.e. 1 embroidery thread used to stitch over 1 fabric thread. There are different methods of stitching a pattern, including the cross-country method where one colour is stitched at a time, or the parking method where one block of fabric is stitched at a time and the end of the thread is \"parked\" at the next point the same colour occurs in the pattern.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Cross stitch detail.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Detail of floral border pattern in cotton. Tea cloth (small tablecloth), [[Hungary]], mid-twentieth century]]\n\nCross-stitch is the oldest form of embroidery and can be found all over the world.<ref>Gillow, John, and Bryan Sentance: ''World Textiles'', Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown, 1999, {{ISBN|0-8212-2621-5}}, p. 181</ref> Many folk museums show examples of clothing decorated with cross-stitch, especially from continental [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]].<ref>''Threads'' (magazine), Issue 11, June/July 1987</ref>\n\nThe cross-stitch [[sampler (needlework)|sampler]] is called that because it was generally stitched by a young girl to learn how to stitch and to record alphabet and other patterns to be used in her household sewing. These samples of her stitching could be referred back to over the years. Often, motifs and initials were stitched on household items to identify their owner, or simply to decorate the otherwise-plain cloth. The earliest known cross stitch sampler made in the United States is currently housed at [[Pilgrim Hall]] in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"pilgrimhall\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pilgrimhall.org/s_sampler.htm|publisher=pilgrimhall.org|title=Loara Standish Sampler|accessdate=2017-04-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218104915/http://www.pilgrimhall.org/s_sampler.htm|archivedate=2007-12-18|df=}}</ref> The sampler was created by Loara Standish, daughter of Captain [[Myles Standish]] and pioneer of the Leviathan stitch, circa 1653.\n\n[[File:Surif cross-stitch.jpg|thumb|Cross stitch from [[Surif]]. Top half of picture is the reverse side.]]\n\nTraditionally, cross-stitch was used to embellish items like household linens, tablecloths, dishcloths, and [[doilies]] (only a small portion of which would actually be embroidered, such as a border). Although there are many cross-stitchers who still employ it in this fashion, it is now increasingly popular to work the pattern on pieces of fabric and hang them on the wall for decoration. Cross-stitch is also often used to make greeting cards, pillowtops, or as inserts for box tops, coasters and trivets.\n\nMulticoloured, shaded, painting-like patterns as we know them today are a fairly modern development, deriving from similar shaded patterns of [[Berlin wool work]] of the mid-nineteenth century. Besides designs created expressly for cross-stitch, there are software programs that convert a photograph or a fine art image into a chart suitable for stitching. One example of this is in the cross-stitched reproduction of the [[Sistine Chapel]] charted and stitched by Joanna Lopianowski-Roberts.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gwen Magee (Gwendolyn) |authorlink=Gwendolyn Ann Magee |url=http://creativityjourney.blogspot.com/2010/08/sistine-chapel-in-cross-stitch.html |title=Textile Arts Resource Guide: The Sistine Chapel in Cross-Stitch |publisher=Creativityjourney.blogspot.com |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2013-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=25 Jun 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5634216/Cross-stitch-recreation-of-Sistine-Chapel-ceiling.html |title=Cross-stitch recreation of Sistine Chapel ceiling |publisher=Telegraph |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2013-12-29 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nThere are many cross-stitching \"[[guilds]]\" and groups across the United States and Europe which offer classes, collaborate on large projects, stitch for charity, and provide other ways for local cross-stitchers to get to know one another. Individually owned local needlework shops (LNS) often have stitching nights at their shops, or host weekend stitching retreats.\n\nToday, cotton floss is the most common embroidery thread. It is a thread made of [[mercerized cotton]], composed of six strands that are only loosely twisted together and easily separable. While there are other manufacturers, the two most-commonly used (and oldest) brands are [[DMC (Company)|DMC]] and Anchor [http://www.coatsandclark.com/Products/Hand+Embroidery/Threads/], both of which have been manufacturing embroidery floss since the 1800s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmc-usa.com/DMC-History.aspx |title=DMC History |publisher=Dmc-usa.com |date= |accessdate = |deadurl=yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170209024634/http://www.dmc-usa.com/DMC-History.aspx|archivedate = 9 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coatsandclark.com/About+Coats/History/Coats+History.htm |title=Coats History |publisher=Coatsandclark.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-29}}</ref>\n\nOther materials used are pearl (or perle) cotton, Danish flower thread, [[silk]] and [[Rayon]]. Different wool threads, metallic threads or other novelty threads are also used, sometimes for the whole work, but often for accents and embellishments. Hand-dyed cross-stitch floss is created just as the name implies\u2014it is dyed by hand. Because of this, there are variations in the amount of color throughout the thread. Some variations can be subtle, while some can be a huge contrast. Some also have more than one color per thread, which in the right project, creates amazing results.\n\nCross-stitch is widely used in traditional Palestinian dressmaking.\n\n==Related stitches and forms of embroidery==\n{{main|cross stitches}}\n[[Image:Ukrainian girls.jpg|thumb|right|Ukrainian girls in traditional-style embroidered costumes]]\n[[File:Cross stitching.jpg|left|thumb|A cross-stitching created with the use of different color fabrics.]]\n\nOther stitches are also often used in cross-stitch, among them \u00bc, \u00bd, and \u00be stitches and backstitches.\n\nCross-stitch is often used together with other stitches. A cross-stitch can come in a variety of prostational forms. It is sometimes used in [[crewel embroidery]], especially in its more modern derivatives. It is also often used in [[needlepoint]].\n\nA specialized historical form of embroidery using cross-stitch is [[Assisi embroidery]].\n\nThere are many stitches which are related to cross-stitch and were used in similar ways in earlier times. The best known are Italian cross-stitch, [[Celtic Cross Stitch]], [[Irish Cross Stitch]], long-armed cross-stitch, Ukrainian cross-stitch and [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] stitch. Italian cross-stitch and Montenegrin stitch are reversible, meaning the work looks the same on both sides. These styles have a slightly different look than ordinary cross-stitch. These more difficult stitches are rarely used in mainstream embroidery, but they are still used to recreate historical pieces of embroidery or by the creative and adventurous stitcher.\n\nThe double cross-stitch, also known as a Leviathan stitch or Smyrna cross-stitch, combines a cross-stitch with an upright cross-stitch.\n\n[[Berlin wool work]] and similar [[petit point]] stitchery resembles the heavily shaded, opulent styles of cross-stitch, and sometimes also used charted patterns on paper.\n\nCross-stitch is often combined with other popular forms of embroidery, such as [[Hardanger embroidery]] or [[blackwork embroidery]]. Cross-stitch may also be combined with other work, such as [[canvaswork]] or [[drawn thread work]]. [[Beadwork]] and other embellishments such as paillettes, charms, small buttons and specialty threads of various kinds may also be used.\n\n==Recent trends in the UK==\n[[File:Ballrina cross-stitching.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Cross-stitching sample]]\n\nCross-stitch has become increasingly popular with the younger generation of the [[United Kingdom]] in recent years.<ref name=\"crossstitchermagazine\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crossstitchermagazine.co.uk/page/crossstitch?entry=the_manbroidering_revolution|publisher=crossstitchermagazine.co.uk|title=Welcome to CrossStitcher &#124; Subscription Website |accessdate=2017-04-30}}</ref> The [[Great Recession]] has also seen renewal of interest in home crafts.

This waste canvas is a temporary gridded canvas similar to regular canvas used for embroidery that is held together by a water-soluble glue, which is removed after completion of stitch design. Other crafters have taken to cross-stitching on all manner of gridded objects as well including old kitchen strainers or chain-link fences.\n\n== Flosstube ==\nAn increasingly popular activity for cross-stitchers is to watch and make [[YouTube]] videos detailing their hobby.

In a casino game, the players [[gambling|gamble]] [[casino token|casino chips]] on various possible [[random]] outcomes or combinations of outcomes. Casino games are also available in [[online casino]]s, where permitted by law. Casino games can also be played outside casinos for entertainment purposes like in parties or in school competitions, some on machines that simulate gambling.\n\n==Categories==\nThere are three general categories of casino games: table games, [[slot machine|electronic gaming machines]], and random number ticket games such as [[keno]]. Gaming machines, such as [[slot machine]]s and [[pachinko]], are usually played by one player at a time and do not require the involvement of casino employees to play. [[Random number generation|Random number]] games are based upon the selection of random numbers, either from a computerized [[random number generator]] or from other gaming equipment. Random number games may be played at a table, such as [[roulette]], or through the purchase of paper tickets or cards, such as [[keno]] or [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]].\n\n==Table games==\n{{main|Table game}}\n\n==Common non-table games==\n\n===Gaming machines===\n* [[Pachinko]]\n* [[Slot machine]]\n* [[Video Lottery Terminal]]\n* [[Video poker]]\n\n===Random numbers===\n* [[Bingo (US)|Bingo]]\n* [[Keno]]\n\n==House advantage==\n{{anchor|House advantage}}\n<!-- \"Casino\", \"Aces and eights (blackjack)\", and \"Shoe (cards)\" link here -->\n\nCasino games generally provide a predictable long-term advantage to the casino, or \"house\", while offering the player the possibility of a large short-term payout. Some casino games have a skill element, where the player makes decisions; such games are called \"random with a tactical element\". While it is possible through skillful play to minimize the house advantage, it is extremely rare that a player has sufficient skill to completely eliminate his inherent long-term disadvantage (the ''house edge'' or [[vigorish]]) in a casino game. Such a skill set would involve years of training, an extraordinary memory and numeracy, and/or acute visual or even aural observation, as in the case of [[Eudaemons|wheel clocking]] in roulette or other examples of [[advantage play]].\n\nThe player's disadvantage is a result of the casino not paying winning wagers according to the game's \"true odds\", which are the payouts that would be expected considering the odds of a wager either winning or losing. For example, if a game is played by wagering on the number that would result from the roll of one die, true odds would be 5 times the amount wagered since there is a 1 in 6 chance of any single number appearing, assuming that the player gets the original amount wagered back. However, the casino may only pay 4 times the amount wagered for a winning wager.\n\nThe house edge or vigorish is defined as the casino profit expressed as the percentage of the player's original bet. (In games such as [[blackjack]] or [[Spanish 21]], the final bet may be several times the original bet, if the player double and splits.)\n\nIn American [[roulette]], there are two \"zeroes\" (0, 00) and 36 non-zero numbers (18 red and 18 black). This leads to a higher house edge compared to the European roulette. The chances of a player, who bets 1 unit on red, winning is 18/38 and his chances of losing 1 unit is 20/38. The player's [[expected value]] is EV = (18/38 x 1) + (20/38 x -1) = 18/38 - 20/38 = -2/38 = -5.26%. Therefore, the house edge is 5.26%. After 10 spins, betting 1 unit per spin, the average house profit will be 10 x 1 x 5.26% = 0.53 units. European roulette wheels have only one \"zero\" and therefore the house advantage (ignoring the [[en prison]] rule) is equal to 1/37 = 2.7%.\n\nThe house edge of casino games vary greatly with the game, with some games having as low as 0.3%. [[Keno]] can have house edges up to 25%, slot machines having up to 15%, while most [[Pontoon (card game)|Australian Pontoon]] games have house edges between 0.3% and 0.4%.\n\nThe calculation of the roulette house edge was a trivial exercise; for other games, this is not usually the case. Combinatorial analysis and/or computer simulation is necessary to complete the task.\n\nIn games which have a skill element, such as [[blackjack]] or [[Spanish 21]], the house edge is defined as the house advantage from optimal play (without the use of advanced techniques such as [[card counting]]), on the first hand of the shoe (the container that holds the cards). The set of the optimal plays for all possible hands is known as \"[[Blackjack#Basic strategy|basic strategy]]\" and is highly dependent on the specific rules and even the number of decks used. Good blackjack and Spanish 21 games have house edges below 0.5%.\n\nTraditionally, the majority of casinos have refused to reveal the house edge information for their slots games and due to the unknown number of symbols and weightings of the reels, in most cases this is much more difficult to calculate than for other casino games. However, due to some online properties revealing this information and some independent research conducted by [[Michael Shackleford]] in the offline sector, this pattern is slowly changing.<ref>{{cite news|title=Michael Shackleford is the wizard of odds|url=http://observer.com/2015/03/michael-shackleford-is-the-wizard-of-odds/|accessdate=13 October 2015|work=[[The Observer]]}}</ref>\n\n===Standard deviation===\n{{refimprove|date=October 2015}}\nThe luck factor in a casino game is quantified using [[standard deviation]]s (SD).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hagan|first1=general editor, Julian Harris, Harris|title=Gaming law : jurisdictional comparisons|date=2012|publisher=European Lawyer Reference Series/Thomson Reuters|location=London|isbn=0414024869|edition=1st}}</ref> The standard deviation of a simple game like roulette can be calculated using the [[binomial distribution]]. In the binomial distribution, SD = sqrt (''npq'' ), where ''n'' = number of rounds played, ''p'' = probability of winning, and ''q'' = probability of losing. The binomial distribution assumes a result of 1 unit for a win, and 0 units for a loss, rather than -1 units for a loss, which doubles the range of possible outcomes. Furthermore, if we flat bet at 10 units per round instead of 1 unit, the range of possible outcomes increases 10 fold.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gao|first1=J.Z.|last2=Fong|first2=D.|last3=Liu|first3=X.|title=Mathematical analyses of casino rebate systems for VIP gambling|journal=International Gambling Studies|date=April 2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=93\u2013106|doi=10.1080/14459795.2011.552575}}<!--|accessdate=13 October 2015--></ref>\n\nSD (Roulette, even-money bet) = 2''b'' sqrt(''npq'' ), where ''b'' = flat bet per round, ''n'' = number of rounds, ''p'' = 18/38, and ''q'' = 20/38.\n\nFor example, after 10 rounds at 1 unit per round, the standard deviation will be 2 x 1 x sqrt(10 x 18/38 x 20/38) = 3.16 units. After 10 rounds, the expected loss will be 10 x 1 x 5.26% = 0.53. As you can see, standard deviation is many times the magnitude of the expected loss.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Andrew|first1=Siegel|title=Practical Business Statistics|date=2011|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=0123877172|url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=cyc_TWqZDO4C|accessdate=13 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe standard deviation for [[pai gow poker]] is the lowest out of all common casinos. Many, particularly slots, have extremely high standard deviations. As the size of the potential payouts increase, so does the standard deviation.\n\nAs the number of rounds increases, eventually, the expected loss will exceed the standard deviation, many times over. From the formula, we can see the standard deviation is proportional to the square root of the number of rounds played, while the expected loss is proportional to the number of rounds played. As the number of rounds increases, the expected loss increases at a much faster rate. This is why it is impossible for a gambler to win in the long term. It is the high ratio of short-term standard deviation to expected loss that fools gamblers into thinking that they can win.\n\nIt is important for a casino to know both the house edge and variance for all of their games. The house edge tells them what kind of profit they will make as percentage of turnover, and the variance tells them how much they need in the way of cash reserves. The mathematicians and computer programmers that do this kind of work are called [[gaming mathematics|gaming mathematicians]] and gaming analysts. Casinos do not have in-house expertise in this field, so outsource their requirements to experts in the gaming analysis field.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gambler's fallacy]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Gambling}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Casino Game}}\n[[Category:Casinos]]", "sha1": "0s7dpu3qaa7fc987g3wl0ygieru12na"}}, {"title": "Video game", "ns": "0", "id": "5363", "revision": {"id": "866409543", "parentid": "865970251", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T04:08:46Z", "contributor": {"username": "Oshawott 12", "id": "32349500"}, "comment": "/* Development */  poorly made with no refs", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect|Video Games}}\n{{pp-semi|small=yes}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2012}}\n[[File:Pong (28684491143).jpg|thumb|right|People playing a large scale version of the iconic ''[[Pong]]'' video game at the [[National Videogame Museum]]]]\n{{Video Games}}\nA '''video game''' is an [[electronic game]] that involves interaction with a [[user interface]] to generate visual feedback on a [[video|video device]] such as a [[Display device|TV screen]] or [[computer monitor]].

Video games are developed and released for specific platforms; for example, a video game that is available to [[Steam (software)|Steam]] may not be available to [[Xbox One]]. Specialized video games such as [[arcade game]]s, in which the video game components are housed in a large, typically [[currency detector|coin-operated]] chassis, while common in the 1980s in [[amusement arcade|video arcades]], have gradually declined due to the widespread availability of affordable [[home video game console]]s (e.g., [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Nintendo Switch]]) and video games on [[Desktop computer|desktop]]/[[laptop]]s and [[smartphone]]s.\n\nThe [[input device]] used for games, the [[game controller]], varies across platforms. Common controllers include [[gamepad]]s, [[joystick]]s, [[mouse (computing)|mouse devices]], [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]], the [[touchscreen]]s of [[mobile device]]s, or even a person's body, using a [[Kinect]] sensor. Players view the game on a [[display device]] such as a [[television]] or [[computer monitor]] or sometimes on [[virtual reality]] [[head-mounted display]] goggles. There are often game [[sound effect]]s, music and voice actor lines which come from [[loudspeaker]]s or [[headphones]]. Some games in the 2000s include [[haptic technology|haptic]], vibration-creating effects, [[force feedback]] [[peripheral]]s and [[virtual reality]] headsets.\n\nIn the 2010s, the commercial importance of the [[video game industry]] is increasing. The emerging Asian markets and [[mobile game]]s on [[smartphone]]s in particular are driving the growth of the industry. As of 2015, video games generated sales of [[United States dollar|USD]] 74 billion annually worldwide, and were the third-largest segment in the U.S. entertainment market, behind broadcast and cable TV.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of video games}}\n{{See also|Early history of video games}}\n[[File:Tennis_For_Two_on_a_DuMont_Lab_Oscilloscope_Type_304-A.jpg|thumb|''Tennis for Two'', an early [[analog computer]] game that used an [[oscilloscope]] for a display]]\n[[File:Tennis for Two - Modern recreation.jpg|thumb|A modern recreation of a controller for ''Tennis for Two'']]\nEarly games used interactive electronic devices with various display formats.

Usually consoles only run games developed for it, or games from other platform made by the same company, but never games developed by its direct competitor, even if the same game is available on different platforms. It often comes with a specific [[game controller]]. Major console platforms include [[Xbox]], [[PlayStation]], and [[Nintendo]].\n\n====Handheld====\n[[File:Game-Boy-FL.jpg|link=File:Game-Boy-FL.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Game Boy|Nintendo Game Boy]] was the first successful handheld console, selling over 100 million systems.]]\nA \"[[Handheld game console|handheld]]\" gaming device is a small, self-contained electronic device that is portable and can be held in a user's hands. It features the console, a small screen, speakers and buttons, [[joystick]] or other [[game controller]]s in a single unit. Like consoles, handhelds are dedicated platforms, and share almost the same characteristics. Handheld hardware usually is less powerful than PC or console hardware. Some handheld games from the late 1970s and early 1980s could only play one game. In the 1990s and 2000s, a number of handheld games used cartridges, which enabled them to be used to play many different games.\n\n====Arcade====\n[[File:Light gun survival horror arcade game.jpg|thumb|right|A horror-themed arcade game in which players use a [[light gun]]]]\n\"[[Arcade game]]\" generally refers to a game played on an even more specialized type of electronic device that is typically designed to play only one game and is encased in a special, large coin-operated [[arcade cabinet|cabinet]] which has one built-in console, controllers (joystick, buttons, etc.), a [[CRT screen]], and audio amplifier and speakers. Arcade games often have brightly painted logos and images relating to the theme of the game. While most arcade games are housed in a vertical cabinet, which the user typically stands in front of to play, some arcade games use a tabletop approach, in which the display screen is housed in a table-style cabinet with a see-through table top. With table-top games, the users typically sit to play. In the 1990s and 2000s, some arcade games offered players a choice of multiple games. In the 1980s, [[video arcade]]s were businesses in which game players could use a number of arcade video games. In the 2010s, there are far fewer video arcades, but some movie theaters and family entertainment centers still have them.\n\n====Web browser====\nThe [[web browser]] has also established itself as platform in its own right in the 2000s, while providing a [[cross-platform]] environment for video games designed to be played on a wide spectrum of platforms. In turn, this has generated new terms to qualify classes of web browser-based games. These games may be identified based on the website that they appear, such as with \"[[Miniclip]]\" games. Others are named based on the programming platform used to develop them, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] games.\n\n====Mobile====\nWith the advent of standard operating systems for mobile devices such as [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and devices with greater hardware performance, [[mobile gaming]] has become a significant platform. These games may utilize unique features of mobile devices that are not necessary present on other platforms, such as [[GPS|global positing information]] and camera devices to support [[augmented reality]] gameplay. Mobile games also led into the development of [[microtransactions]] as a valid revenue model for casual games.\n\n====Virtual reality====\n[[Virtual reality]] (VR) games generally require players to use a special [[Head-mounted display|head-mounted unit]] that provides [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic screens]] and motion tracking to immerse a player within virtual environment that responds to their head movements. Some VR systems include control units for the player's hands as to provide a direct way to interact with the virtual world. VR systems generally require a separate computer, console, or other processing device that couples with the head-mounted unit.\n\n====Blockchain====\nA new platform of video games emerged in late 2017 in which users could take ownership of game assets ([[digital asset]]s) using [[Blockchain]] technologies.<ref name=\"bbc.com\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162|title=CryptoKitties craze slows down transactions on Ethereum|last=|first=|date=2017-05-12|df=dmy-all|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112143517/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162|archivedate=12 January 2018}}</ref> An example of this is [[Cryptokitties]].<ref name=\"bbc.com\"/>\n\n===Genres===\n{{Main|Video game genre}}\n\nA video game, like most other forms of media, may be categorized into [[genres]].

Ever advancing technology and production values related to video game development have fostered more lifelike and complex games which have in turn introduced or enhanced genre possibilities (e.g., virtual pets), pushed the boundaries of existing video gaming or in some cases add new possibilities in play (such as that seen with games specifically designed for devices like Sony's [[PlayStation Eye|EyeToy]]). Some genres represent combinations of others, such as [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, or, more commonly, MMORPGs. It is also common to see higher level genre terms that are collective in nature across all other genres such as with action, music/rhythm or horror-themed video games.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Classifications===\n\n====Casual games====\n{{Main|Casual game}}\n\nCasual games derive their name from their ease of accessibility, simple to understand gameplay and quick to grasp rule sets. Additionally, casual games frequently support the ability to jump in and out of play on demand. Casual games as a format existed long before the term was coined and include video games such as Solitaire or Minesweeper which can commonly be found pre-installed with many versions of the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system. Examples of [[Video game genre|genres]] within this category are [[match three]], [[hidden object]], [[Time Management (video game genre)|time management]], [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]] or many of the [[tower defense]] style games. Casual games are generally available through [[app store]]s and online retailers such as [[PopCap Games|PopCap]], [[Zylom]] and [[GameHouse]] or provided for free play through [[web portal]]s such as [[Newgrounds]]. While casual games are most commonly played on personal computers, phones or tablets, they can also be found on many of the on-line console system download services (e.g., the [[PlayStation Network]], [[WiiWare]] or [[Xbox Live]]).\n\n====Serious games====\n{{Main|Serious game}}\n\nSerious games are games that are designed primarily to convey information or a learning experience to the player. Some serious games may even fail to qualify as a video game in the traditional sense of the term. Educational software does not typically fall under this category (e.g., [[touch typing]] tutors, language learning programs, etc.) and the primary distinction would appear to be based on the game's primary goal as well as target age demographics. As with the other categories, this description is more of a guideline than a rule. Serious games are games generally made for reasons beyond simple entertainment and as with the core and casual games may include works from any given genre, although some such as [[exergaming|exercise games]], [[educational game]]s, or propaganda games may have a higher representation in this group due to their subject matter.

This form of media allows for a broader audience to be able to receive and gain access to certain information that otherwise may not have reached such people.

Some other games do not have any particular targeted audience in mind and intended to simply educate or inform whoever views or plays the game.\n\n===Controllers===\n{{Main|Game controller}}\n[[File:Nintendo-Super-NES-Controller.jpg|thumb|right|A North American [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] game controller from the early 1990s]]\nVideo game can use several types of input devices to translate human actions to a game, the most common game controllers are keyboard and mouse for \"[[personal computer game|PC games]], consoles usually come with specific [[gamepad]]s, handheld consoles have built in buttons. Other game controllers are commonly used for specific games like [[racing wheel]]s, [[light gun]]s or [[dance pad]]s. [[Digital camera]]s can also be used as game controllers capturing movements of the body of the player.\n\nAs technology continues to advance, more can be added onto the controller to give the player a more immersive experience when playing different games. There are some controllers that have presets so that the buttons are mapped a certain way to make playing certain games easier. Along with the presets, a player can sometimes custom map the buttons to better accommodate their play style. On keyboard and mouse, different actions in the game are already preset to keys on the keyboard. Most games allow the player to change that so that the actions are mapped to different keys that are more to their liking. The companies that design the controllers are trying to make the controller visually appealing and also feel comfortable in the hands of the consumer.\n\nAn example of a technology that was incorporated into the controller was the [[Tablet computer|touchscreen]]. It allows the player to be able to interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the players path. Another example is [[Motion controller|motion sensor]] where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. The reason for that is because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the player moves around in front of it, and the actions are repeated by a game character.\n\n==Development==\n{{Main|Game development}}\n{{See also|Video game industry practices}}\n[[File:Virtual-camera-system.png|thumb|Developers use various tools to create video games. Here an editor is fine-tuning the [[virtual camera system]].]]\n\nVideo game development and authorship, much like any other form of entertainment, is frequently a cross-disciplinary field. [[Video game developer]]s, as employees within this industry are commonly referred, primarily include [[game programmer|programmers]] and [[graphic design]]ers. Over the years this has expanded to include almost every type of skill that one might see prevalent in the creation of any movie or television program, including [[sound design]]ers, musicians, and other technicians; as well as skills that are specific to video games, such as the [[game designer]]. All of these are managed by [[game producer|producers]].\n\nIn the early days of the industry, it was more common for a single person to manage all of the roles needed to create a video game. As platforms have become more complex and powerful in the type of material they can present, larger teams have been needed to generate all of the art, programming, cinematography, and more. This is not to say that the age of the \"one-man shop\" is gone, as this is still sometimes found in the casual gaming and handheld markets,<ref name=\"numberofdevs\">{{cite web | title =The Edge of Reason? | publisher =eurogamer.net | url =http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-edge-of-reason | accessdate =2009-11-16 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091119022451/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-edge-of-reason | archivedate =19 November 2009 | df =dmy-all }}</ref> where smaller games are prevalent due to technical limitations such as limited [[RAM]] or lack of dedicated 3D graphics rendering capabilities on the target platform (e.g., some [[PDAs]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nWith the growth of the size of development teams in the industry, the problem of cost has increased. Development studios need to be able to pay their staff a competitive wage in order to attract and retain the best talent, while publishers are constantly looking to keep costs down in order to maintain profitability on their investment. Typically, a video game console development team can range in sizes of anywhere from 5 to 50 people, with some teams exceeding 100. In May 2009, one game project was reported to have a development staff of 450.<ref>[http://www.nowgamer.com/news/513/assassins-creed-ii-triples-size-of-dev-team \"Assassin's Creed II dev team triples in size\"], Christopher Reynolds, 18 May 2009, NOW Gamer. {{webarchive |url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515200937/http://www.nowgamer.com/news/513/assassins-creed-ii-triples-size-of-dev-team |date=15 May 2016 }}</ref> The growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines, rushed games and the release of unfinished products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kotaku.com/the-messy-true-story-behind-the-making-of-destiny-1737556731|title=The Messy, True Story Behind The Making Of Destiny|last=Schreier|first=Jason|newspaper=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115203558/http://kotaku.com/the-messy-true-story-behind-the-making-of-destiny-1737556731|archivedate=15 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n\n===Downloadable content===\n{{Main|Downloadable content}}\n\nA phenomenon of additional game content at a later date, often for additional funds, began with digital video game distribution known as downloadable content (DLC). Developers can use [[digital distribution]] to issue new storylines after the main game is released, such as [[Rockstar Games]] with ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' (''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned|The Lost and Damned]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony|The Ballad of Gay Tony]]''), or Bethesda with ''[[Fallout 3]]'' and [[Fallout 3 downloadable content|its expansions]].

Smaller packages of DLC are also common, ranging from better in-game weapons (''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'', ''[[Just Cause 2]]''), character outfits (''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'', ''[[Minecraft]]''), or new songs to perform (''[[SingStar]]'', ''[[Rock Band]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero]]'').\n\n====Expansion packs====\n{{Main|Expansion pack}}\nA variation of downloadable content is expansion packs. Unlike DLC, expansion packs add a whole section to the game that either already exists in the game's code or is developed after the game is released. Expansions add new maps, missions, weapons, and other things that weren't previously accessible in the original game. An example of an expansion is [[Bungie]]'s ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'', which had the ''[[Destiny: Rise of Iron|Rise of Iron]]'' expansion. The expansion added new weapons, new maps, and higher levels, and remade old missions.\n\nExpansions are added to the base game to help prolong the life of the game itself until the company is able to produce a sequel or a new game altogether. Developers may plan out their game's life and already have the code for the expansion in the game, but inaccessible by players, who later unlock these expansions, sometimes for free and sometimes at an extra cost. Some developers make games and add expansions later, so that they could see what additions the players would like to have. There are also expansions that are set apart from the original game and are considered a stand-alone game, such as [[Ubisoft]]'s expansion ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]] Freedom's Cry'', which features a different character than the original game.\n\n===Modifications===\n{{Main|Mod (computer gaming)}}\n\nMany games produced for the PC are designed such that technically oriented consumers can modify the game. These [[mod (computer gaming)|mods]] can add an extra dimension of replayability and interest. Developers such as [[id Software]], [[Valve Corporation]], [[Crytek]], [[Bethesda Softworks|Bethesda]], [[Epic Games]] and [[Blizzard Entertainment]] ship their games with some of the development tools used to make the game, along with documentation to assist mod developers. The Internet provides an inexpensive medium to promote and distribute mods, and they may be a factor in the commercial success of some games.<ref name=\"lombardi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000484956 |title=Hollywood Reporter interviewing Doug Lombardi, Quote: \"Mods absolutely helped us drive huge sales to 'Half-Life'\" |accessdate=10 August 2009 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506004712/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000484956 |archivedate=6 May 2008 }}.</ref> This allows for the kind of success seen by popular mods such as the ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' mod ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]''.\n\n===Cheating===\n{{Main|Cheating (video games)}}\n\nCheating in computer games may involve [[cheat codes]] and hidden spots implemented by the game developers,<ref name=\"WashPost\">{{cite news| title = In Game World, Cheaters Proudly Prosper| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/27/AR2006082701059.html| work = Washington Post| author = Vargas, Jose Antonio| date = 28 August 2006| accessdate = 2007-10-24| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110820080450/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/27/AR2006082701059.html| archivedate = 20 August 2011| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"KonamiCode\">{{cite web| url = http://www.1up.com/features/cracking-code-konami-code| title = Cracking the Code: The Konami Code| publisher = [[1UP.com]]| author = 1UP Staff| accessdate = 2007-10-24| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110522201923/http://www.1up.com/features/cracking-code-konami-code| archivedate = 22 May 2011| df = dmy-all}}</ref> modification of game code by third parties,<ref name=\"AboutCheatCodes\">{{cite web| title = Video Game Cheats and Codes \u2013 What Are Cheat Codes?| url = http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/faqglossary/a/WhatAreCheats.htm| publisher = [[About.com]]| author = Rybka, Jason| accessdate = 2007-10-24| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015083207/http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/faqglossary/a/WhatAreCheats.htm| archivedate = 15 October 2007| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Why Use Cheats and Codes for Console and PC Games?| url = http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/basicgamingtipstricks/a/whyusecheats.htm| publisher = About.com| author = Rybka, Jason| accessdate = 2007-10-24| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071017101254/http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/basicgamingtipstricks/a/whyusecheats.htm| archivedate = 17 October 2007| df = dmy-all}}</ref> or players exploiting a software glitch.

Retrieved January 25, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Theory==\n{{Main|Game studies}}\n\nAlthough departments of computer science have been studying the technical aspects of video games for years, theories that examine games as an artistic medium are a relatively recent development in the humanities. The two most visible schools in this emerging field are [[ludology]] and [[narratology]]. Narrativists approach video games in the context of what [[Janet Murray]] calls \"Cyberdrama\". That is to say, their major concern is with video games as a storytelling medium, one that arises out of [[interactive fiction]]. Murray puts video games in the context of the [[Holodeck]], a fictional piece of technology from ''[[Star Trek]]'', arguing for the video game as a medium in which the player is allowed to become another person, and to act out in another world.{{sfn|Murray|1998}} This image of video games received early widespread popular support, and forms the basis of films such as ''[[Tron]]'', ''[[eXistenZ]]'' and ''[[The Last Starfighter]]''.\n\nLudologists break sharply and radically from this idea. They argue that a video game is first and foremost a game, which must be understood in terms of its rules, interface, and the concept of play that it deploys. [[Espen J. Aarseth]] argues that, although games certainly have plots, characters, and aspects of traditional narratives, these aspects are incidental to gameplay. For example, Aarseth is critical of the widespread attention that narrativists have given to the heroine of the game ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', saying that \"the dimensions of [[Lara Croft]]'s body, already analyzed to death by [[film theory|film theorists]], are irrelevant to me as a player, because a different-looking body would not make me play differently... When I play, I don't even see her body, but see through it and past it.\"<ref>{{cite web| last = Aarseth| first = Espen J.| authorlink = Espen J.

The term \"emergent narrative\" has been used to describe how, in a simulated environment, storyline can be created simply by \"what happens to the player.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xbox.ign.com/articles/502/502409p1.html |title=IGN: GDC 2004: Warren Spector Talks Games Narrative |publisher=Xbox.ign.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411094042/http://xbox.ign.com/articles/502/502409p1.html |archivedate=11 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> However, emergent behavior is not limited to sophisticated games. In general, any place where event-driven instructions occur for [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] in a game, emergent behavior will exist. For instance, take a racing game in which cars are programmed to avoid crashing, and they encounter an obstacle in the track: the cars might then maneuver to avoid the obstacle causing the cars behind them to slow and/or maneuver to accommodate the cars in front of them and the obstacle. The programmer never wrote code to specifically create a traffic jam, yet one now exists in the game.\n\n==Emulation==\n{{Main|Video game console emulator}}\n[[File:StarFox64 Emulated with Project64.png|thumb|right|[[Project64]], a [[Nintendo 64]] emulator, running ''[[Star Fox 64]]''  on a [[Windows 8]] platform]]\n\nAn emulator is a program that replicates the behavior of a [[video game console]], allowing games to run on a different platform from the original hardware. Emulators exist for [[personal computer|PCs]], [[smartphone]]s and [[video game console|consoles]] other than the original. Emulators are generally used to play old games, [[ROM hacking|hack existing games]], [[Fan translation of video games|translate unreleased games in a specific region]], or add enhanced features to games like improved graphics, speed up or down, bypass regional lockouts, or online multiplayer support.\n\nSome manufacturers have released official emulators for their own consoles.

As computer and video games have increased in popularity over time, they have had a significant influence on popular culture. Video game culture has also evolved over time hand in hand with [[internet culture]] as well as the increasing popularity of [[mobile game]]s. Many people who play video games identify as [[gamer]]s, which can mean anything from someone who enjoys games to someone who is passionate about it. As video games become more social with [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] and [[Online game|online capability]], gamers find themselves in growing [[social network]]s. Gaming can both be entertainment as well as competition, as a new trend known as [[Esports|electronic sports]] is becoming more widely accepted. In the 2010s, video games and discussions of video game trends and topics can be seen in [[social media]], politics, television, film and music.\n\n===Multiplayer===\n{{Main|Multiplayer video game}}\n\n[[Multiplayer video games]] are those that can be played either competitively, sometimes in [[Electronic Sports]], or cooperatively by using either multiple input devices, or by [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseating]]. ''[[Tennis for Two]]'', arguably the first video game, was a two player game, as was its successor ''[[Pong]]''. The first commercially available game console, the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], had two controller inputs. Since then, most consoles have been shipped with two or four controller inputs. Some have had the ability to expand to four, eight or as many as 12 inputs with additional adapters, such as the [[Multitap]]. Multiplayer [[arcade game]]s typically feature play for two to four players, sometimes tilting the monitor on its back for a top-down viewing experience allowing players to sit opposite one another.\n\nMany early computer games for non-PC descendant based platforms featured multiplayer support. Personal computer systems from [[Atari]] and [[Commodore International|Commodore]] both regularly featured at least two game ports. PC-based computer games started with a lower availability of multiplayer options because of technical limitations. PCs typically had either one or no game ports at all. Network games for these early personal computers were generally limited to only text based adventures or [[MUD]]s that were played remotely on a dedicated server. This was due both to the slow speed of modems (300-1200-bit/s), and the prohibitive cost involved with putting a computer online in such a way where multiple visitors could make use of it. However, with the advent of widespread [[local area network]]ing technologies and Internet based online capabilities, the number of players in modern games can be 32 or higher, sometimes featuring integrated text and/or voice chat. [[Massively multiplayer online game]] (MMOs) can offer extremely high numbers of simultaneous players; ''[[Eve Online]]'' set a record with 65,303 players on a single server in 2013.<ref name=\"MassivelyEVEPCU\">{{cite web |url=http://massively.joystiq.com/2013/05/06/eve-online-smashes-pcu-record-during-anniversary-celebrations/ |title=EVE Online smashes PCU record during anniversary celebrations |publisher=massively.joystiq.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128020244/http://massively.joystiq.com/2013/05/06/eve-online-smashes-pcu-record-during-anniversary-celebrations/ |archivedate=28 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Behavioral effects==\n{{Main|Video game behavioral effects}}\n\nIt has been shown that action video game players have better [[hand\u2013eye coordination]] and [[Motor coordination|visuo-motor skills]], such as their resistance to [[distraction]], their sensitivity to information in the [[peripheral vision]] and their ability to count briefly presented objects, than nonplayers.<ref>\n{{cite journal| authorlink = Shawn Green (game designer)| title = Action video game modifies visual selective attention| journal = Nature| volume = 423| pages = 534\u2013537| year = 2003| id = Green & Bavelier| doi = 10.1038/nature01647| author = Green, C.

To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, as well as how to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and [[HUD (computer gaming)|HUDs]]. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/05/16/050516crbo_books |title=Brain Candy |work=The New Yorker |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509225914/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/05/16/050516crbo_books |archivedate=9 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.<ref>{{cite web | author = Daphne Bavelier| year = 2003 | url = http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/daphne/GreenandBavelier.pdf | title = Action video game modifies visual selective attention | publisher = Nature/University of Rochester | accessdate = 29 April 2006 |format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060329174957/http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/daphne/GreenandBavelier.pdf |archivedate = 29 March 2006|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nLearning principles found in video games have been identified as possible techniques with which to reform the U.S. education system.<ref>{{cite book| last = Gee | first = James Paul | title = What Video Games Have to Teach us About Literacy and Learning | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-4039-6169-7 }}</ref> It has been noticed that gamers adopt an attitude while playing that is of such high concentration, they do not realize they are learning, and that if the same attitude could be adopted at school, education would enjoy significant benefits.<ref>{{cite news | author = James Paul Gee | year = 2007 | url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/view.html | title = Wired 11.05: View | publisher = Codenet, Inc. | accessdate = 4 December 2007 | display-authors = etal | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517033243/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/view.html | archivedate = 17 May 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Students are found to be \"learning by doing\" while playing video games while fostering creative thinking.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Video games | journal = CQ Researcher | volume = 16 | pages = 937\u2013960 | year = 2006 | id = cqresrre2006111000 | author = Glazer, S.}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] has deployed machines such as the [[PackBot]] and [[UAV]] vehicles, which make use of a game-style [[Game controller|hand controller]] to make it more familiar for young people.<ref>{{cite web | year=2007 | url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/iRobot_Receives_New_Military_Orders_14_PackBot_Robots_999.html | title=iRobot Receives New Military Orders 14 PackBot Robots | accessdate=25 July 2007 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215315/http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/iRobot_Receives_New_Military_Orders_14_PackBot_Robots_999.html | archivedate=26 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> According to research discussed at the 2008 Convention of the American Psychological Association, certain types of video games can improve the gamers' [[dexterity]] as well as their ability to do problem solving.

Most video games present opportunities to use these skills with the ability to try multiple times even after failure. Many of these skills can be translated to reality and problem solving. This allows the player to learn from mistakes and fully understand how and why a solution to a problem may work. Some researchers believe that continual exposure to challenges may lead players to develop greater persistence over time after a study was shown that frequent players spent more time on puzzles in task that did not involve video games<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" />. Although players were shown to spend more time on puzzles, much of that could have been due to the positive effects of problem solving in games, which involve forming strategy and weighing option before testing a solution<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nIn a study that followed students through school, students that played video games showed higher levels of problem solving than students who did not<ref name=\":3\" />.

For example, a game might be rated \"T\" for \"Teen\" if the game contained obscene words or violence. If a game contains explicit violence or sexual themes, it is likely to receive an ''M'' for \"Mature\" rating, which means that no one under 17 should play it. The rating \"A/O\", for \"Adults Only\", indicates games with massive violence or nudity. There are no laws that prohibit children from purchasing \"M\" rated games in the United States.

It is forbidden for anyone, retailers, friends or parents alike, to allow a child access to a game for which he or she is underage.

There are certain games that are made for just competitive multiplayer purposes. With those type of games, players focus entirely one choosing the right character or obtaining the right equipment in the game to help them when facing other players. Tournaments are held so that people in the area or from different regions can play against other players of the same game and see who is the best. [[Major League Gaming]] (MLG) is a company that reports tournaments that are held across the country. The players that compete in these tournaments are given a rank depending on their skill level in the game that they choose to play in and face other players that play that game. The players that also compete are mostly called professional players for the fact that they have played the game they are competing in for many, long hours. Those players have been able to come up with different strategies for facing different characters. The professional players are able to pick a character to their liking and be able to master how to use that character very effectively.

Laws that define copyright, and the rights that are conveyed over a video game, vary from country to country. Usually a [[fair use]] copyright clause allows consumers some ancillary rights, such as for a player of the game to stream a game online. This is a vague area in copyright law, as these laws predate the advent of video games. This means that rightsholders often must define what they will allow a consumer to do with the video game.\n\n==Museums==\n[[File:Consoles-computerspielemuseum.jpg|thumb|Gaming consoles at the [[Computerspielemuseum Berlin|Computer Games Museum]] in Berlin]]\nThere are many video game museums around the world, including the [[National Videogame Museum]] in Frisco, Texas,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nvmusa.org |title=National Videogame Museum |publisher=nvmusa.org |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202165057/http://www.nvmusa.org/ |archivedate=2 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which serves as the largest museum wholly dedicated to the display and preservation of the industry's most important artifacts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fox4news.com/good-day/national-videogame-museum-opens-in-frisco |title=Fox 4 News |publisher=Fox4news.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107015007/http://www.fox4news.com/good-day/national-videogame-museum-opens-in-frisco |archivedate=7 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Europe hosts video game museums such as the [[Computerspielemuseum Berlin|Computer Games Museum]] in Berlin<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerspielemuseum.de/index.php?lg=en |title=Computerspielemuseum \u2013 Berlin |publisher=Computerspielemuseum.de |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501141756/http://www.computerspielemuseum.de/index.php?lg=en |archivedate=1 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the [[Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines]] in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.15kop.ru/en/ |title=Museum of Soviet arcade machines |publisher=15kop.ru |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128025438/http://15kop.ru/en/ |archivedate=28 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redpenguin.net/trans-siberian-part-7-the-museum-of-soviet-arcade-machines.php |title=Red Penguin: Review of the Museum of Soviet arcade machines |publisher=redpenguin.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921225512/http://www.redpenguin.net/trans-siberian-part-7-the-museum-of-soviet-arcade-machines.php |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all |access-date=1 June 2013 }}</ref> The [[Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment]] in [[Oakland, California]] is a dedicated video game museum focusing on playable exhibits of console and computer games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themade.org/content/what-are-we |title=About The MADE |publisher=themade.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530145047/http://www.themade.org/content/what-are-we |archivedate=30 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Video Game Museum of Rome]] is also dedicated to preserving video games and their history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vigamus.com/en/ |title=ViGaMus |publisher=vigamus.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213050653/http://www.vigamus.com/en/ |archivedate=13 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[International Center for the History of Electronic Games]] at [[The Strong]] in [[Rochester, New York]] contains one of the largest collections of electronic games and game-related historical materials in the world, including a {{convert|5000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} exhibit which allows guests to play their way through the history of video games.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=International Center for the History of Electronic Games (ICHEG) | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Video Games: The Culture, Technology, and Art of Gaming | editor=Wolf, Mark J.

The Cambrian is divided into four [[epoch (geology)|epochs]] ([[series (stratigraphy)|series]]) and ten [[age (geology)|ages]] ([[stage (stratigraphy)|stages]]). Currently only three series and six stages are named and have a [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|GSSP]] (an internationally agreed-upon stratigraphic reference point).\n\nBecause the international stratigraphic subdivision is not yet complete, many local subdivisions are still widely used. In some of these subdivisions the Cambrian is divided into three series (epochs) with locally differing names&nbsp;\u2013 the Early Cambrian (Caerfai or Waucoban, {{period span|early cambrian}} mya), [[Middle Cambrian]] (St Davids or Albertan, {{period span|middle cambrian}} mya) and [[Furongian]] ({{period span|late Cambrian}} mya; also known as Late Cambrian, Merioneth or Croixan). Rocks of these epochs are referred to as belonging to the Lower, Middle, or Upper Cambrian.\n\n[[Trilobite zone]]s allow biostratigraphic correlation in the Cambrian.\n\nEach of the local series is divided into several stages.

About 515 million years ago, the number of species going extinct exceeded the number of new species appearing. Five million years later, the number of genera had dropped from an earlier peak of about 600 to just 450. Also, the [[speciation]] rate in many groups was reduced to between a fifth and a third of previous levels. 500 million years ago, oxygen levels fell dramatically in the oceans, leading to [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]], while the level of poisonous [[hydrogen sulfide]] simultaneously increased, causing another extinction. The later half of Cambrian was surprisingly barren and show evidence of several rapid extinction events; the [[stromatolite]]s which had been replaced by reef building sponges known as [[Archaeocyatha]], returned once more as the archaeocyathids became extinct.

The [[Scholasticism|scholars]] of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries developed Aristotle's ideas, firstly, for example by [[Gilbert de la Porr\u00e9e|Gilbert of Poitiers]], dividing Aristotle's ten categories into two sets, primary and secondary, according to whether they inhere in the subject or not:\n*Primary categories: Substance, Relation, Quantity and Quality\n*Secondary categories: Place, Time, Situation, Condition, Action, Passion<ref>Reese W.L. ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion'' (Harvester Press, 1980)</ref>\nSecondly, following [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]\u2019s likening of the classificatory hierarchy to a [[Porphyrian tree|tree]], they concluded that the major classes could be subdivided to form subclasses, for example, [[Substance theory|Substance]] could be divided into [[Genus]] and Species, and [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]] could be subdivided into [[Property (philosophy)|Property]] and Accident, depending on whether the property was necessary or contingent.<ref>''Ibid''. cf Evangelou C. ''Aristotle\u2019s Categories and Porphyry'' (E.J. Brill, Leiden, 1988)</ref> An alternative line of development was taken by [[Plotinus]] in the second century who by a process of abstraction reduced Aristotle\u2019s list of ten categories to five: Substance, Relation, Quantity, Motion and Quality.<ref>Plotinus ''Enneads'' (tr. Mackenna S. & Page B.S., The Medici Society, London, 1930) VI.3.3</ref> Plotinus further suggested that the latter three categories of his list, namely Quantity, Motion and Quality correspond to three different kinds of relation and that these three categories could therefore be subsumed under the category of Relation.<ref>''Ibid''. VI.3.21</ref> This was to lead to the supposition that there were only two categories at the top of the hierarchical tree, namely Substance and Relation, and if relations only exist in the mind as many supposed, to the two highest categories, Mind and Matter, reflected most clearly in the dualism of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]].<ref>Descartes R. ''The Philosophical Works of Descartes'' (tr. Haldane E. & Ross G., Dover, New York, 1911) Vol.1</ref>\n\n==Modern development==\nAn alternative conclusion however began to be formulated in the eighteenth century by [[Immanuel Kant]] who realised that we can say nothing about [[Substance theory|Substance]] except through the relation of the subject to other things.<ref>''Op.cit.3'' p.87</ref> In the sentence \"This is a house\" the substantive subject \"house\" only gains meaning in relation to human use patterns or to other similar houses. The category of Substance disappears from [[Category (Kant)|Kant's tables]], and under the heading of Relation, Kant lists ''inter alia'' the three relationship types of Disjunction, Causality and Inherence.<ref>''Ibid.'' pp.107,113</ref> The three older concepts of Quantity, Motion and Quality, as [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] discovered, could be subsumed under these three broader headings in that [[Quantity]] relates to the subject through the relation of [[Logical disjunction|Disjunction]]; Motion relates to the subject through the relation of [[Causality]]; and [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]] relates to the subject through the relation of [[Inherence]].<ref>''Op.cit.5'' pp.148-179</ref> Sets of three continued to play an important part in the nineteenth century development of the categories, most notably in [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel's]] extensive tabulation of categories,<ref>Stace W.T. ''The Philosophy of Hegel'' (Macmillan & Co, London, 1924)</ref> and in [[Categories (Peirce)|C.S. Peirce's categories]] set out in his work on the logic of relations. One of Peirce's contributions was to call the three primary categories Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness<ref>''Op.cit.5'' pp.148-179</ref> which both emphasises their general nature, and avoids the confusion of having the same name for both the category itself and for a concept within that category.\n\nIn a separate development, and building on the notion of primary and secondary categories introduced by the Scholastics, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] introduced the idea that secondary or \"derivative\" categories could be derived from the primary categories through the combination of one primary category with another.<ref>''Op.cit.3'' p.116</ref> This would result in the formation of three secondary categories: the first, \"Community\" was an example that Kant gave of such a derivative category; the second, \"[[Linguistic modality|Modality]]\", introduced by Kant, was a term which Hegel, in developing Kant's dialectical method, showed could also be seen as a derivative category;<ref>Hegel G.W.F. ''Logic'' (tr. Wallace W., Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1975) pp.124ff</ref> and the third, \"Spirit\" or \"Will\" were terms that [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]<ref>''Op.cit.15''</ref> and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]<ref>Schopenhauer A. ''On the Four-Fold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason''  1813 (tr. Payne E., La Salle, Illinois, 1974)</ref> were developing separately for use in their own systems. [[Karl Jaspers]] in the twentieth century, in his development of existential categories, brought the three together, allowing for differences in terminology, as Substantiality, Communication and Will.<ref>Jaspers K. ''Philosophy'' 1932 (tr. Ashton E.B., University of Chicago Press, 1970) pp.117ff</ref> This pattern of three primary and three secondary categories was used most notably in the nineteenth century by [[Peter Mark Roget]] to form the six headings of his [[Roget's Thesaurus|Thesaurus]] of English Words and Phrases. The headings used were the three objective categories of Abstract Relation, Space (including Motion) and Matter and the three subjective categories of Intellect, Feeling and Volition, and he found that under these six headings all the words of the English language, and hence any possible predicate, could be assembled.<ref>Roget P.M. ''Roget\u2019s Thesaurus: The Everyman Edition'' 1952 (Pan Books, London, 1972)</ref>\n\n==Twentieth century development==\nIn the twentieth century the primacy of the division between the subjective and the objective, or between mind and matter, was disputed by, among others, [[Bertrand Russell]]<ref>Russell B. ''The Analysis of Mind'' (George Allen & Unwin, London, 1921) pp.10,23</ref> and [[Gilbert Ryle]].<ref>Ryle G. ''The Concept of Mind''  (Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1949) pp.17ff</ref> Philosophy began to move away from the metaphysics of categorisation towards the linguistic problem of trying to differentiate between, and define, the words being used. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]\u2019s conclusion was that there were no clear definitions which we can give to words and categories but only a \"halo\" or \"corona\"<ref>Wittgenstein L. ''Philosophical Investigations'' 1953 (tr. Anscombe G., Blackwell, Oxford, 1978) pp.14,181</ref> of related meanings radiating around each term. Gilbert Ryle thought the problem could be seen in terms of dealing with \"a galaxy of ideas\" rather than a single idea, and suggested that [[category mistake]]s are made when a concept (e.g. \"university\"), understood as falling under one category (e.g. abstract idea), is used as though it falls under another (e.g. physical object).<ref>Ryle G. ''Collected Papers'' (Hutchinson, London, 1971) Vol.II: ''Philosophical Arguments'' 1945, pp.201,202</ref> With regard to the visual analogies being used, [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] and [[Clarence Irving Lewis|Lewis]],<ref>''Op.cit.1'' pp.52,82,106</ref> just like [[Plotinus]] earlier,<ref>''Op.cit.9'' VI.5.5</ref> likened the terms of propositions to points, and the relations between the terms to lines. Peirce, taking this further, talked of univalent, bivalent and trivalent relations linking predicates to their subject and it is just the number and types of relation linking subject and predicate that determine the category into which a predicate might fall.<ref>''Op.cit.5'' Vol I pp.159,176</ref> Primary categories contain concepts where there is one dominant kind of relation to the subject. Secondary categories contain concepts where there are two dominant kinds of relation. Examples of the latter were given by [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] in his two propositions \"the house is on the creek\" where the two dominant relations are spatial location (Disjunction) and cultural association (Inherence), and \"the house is eighteenth century\" where the two relations are temporal location (Causality) and cultural quality (Inherence).<ref>''Op.cit.4'' pp.62,187</ref> A third example may be inferred from Kant in the proposition \"the house is impressive or [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]\" where the two relations are spatial or mathematical disposition (Disjunction) and dynamic or motive power (Causality).<ref>Kant I. ''Critique of Judgement'' 1790 (tr. Meredith J.C., Clarendon Press, Oxford 1952) p.94ff</ref> Both [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]<ref>''Op.cit.25'' pp.36,152</ref> introduced the analogy of [[colour theory]] in order to illustrate the shades of meanings of words. Primary categories, like primary colours, are analytical representing the furthest we can go in terms of analysis and abstraction and include Quantity, Motion and Quality. Secondary categories, like secondary colours, are synthetic and include concepts such as Substance, Community and Spirit.\n\n==Aristotle==\n{{Main|Categories (Aristotle)}}\nOne of [[Aristotle]]\u2019s early interests lay in the classification of the natural world, how for example the genus \"animal\" could be first divided into \"two-footed animal\" and then into \"wingless, two-footed animal\".<ref>Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' 1075a</ref> He realised that the distinctions were being made according to the qualities the animal possesses, the quantity of its parts and the kind of motion that it exhibits. To fully complete the proposition \"this animal is\u2026\" Aristotle stated in his work on the [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]] that there were ten kinds of predicate where...\n\n\"\u2026each signifies either substance or quantity or quality or relation or where or when or being-in-a-position or having or acting or being acted upon\".<ref>''Op.cit.2''</ref>\n\nHe realised that predicates could be simple or complex. The simple kinds consist of a subject and a predicate linked together by the \"categorical\" or inherent type of relation. For Aristotle the more complex kinds were limited to propositions where the predicate is compounded of two of the above categories for example \"this is a horse running\". More complex kinds of proposition were only discovered after Aristotle by the Stoic, [[Chrysippus]],<ref>Long A. & Sedley D. ''The Hellenistic Philosophers'' (Cambridge University Press, 1987) p.206</ref> who developed the \"hypothetical\" and \"disjunctive\" types of [[syllogism]] and these were terms which were to be developed through the [[Scholasticism|Middle Ages]]<ref>Peter of Spain (''alias'' John XXI) ''Summulae Logicales''</ref> and were to reappear in [[Category (Kant)|Kant's system of categories]].\n\n''Category'' came into use with [[Aristotle]]'s essay ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'', in which he discussed univocal and [[equivocal]] terms, predication, and ten categories:<ref>''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2412/2412-h/2412-h.htm Categories]'', translated by [[Ella Mary Edghill|E.

VI.2.17</ref> He concluded that such [[Transcendentals|transcendental categories]] and even the [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories of Aristotle]] were in some way posterior to the three [[Eleatics|Eleatic]] categories first recorded in Plato's dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'' and which comprised the following three coupled terms: \n*Unity/Plurality\n*Motion/Stability\n*Identity/Difference<ref>Plato ''Parmenides'' (tr. Jowett B., ''The Dialogues of Plato'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1875) p.162</ref>\n\n[[Plotinus]] called these \"the hearth of reality\"<ref>''Op.cit.9'' Op.cit.1.4</ref> deriving from them not only the three categories of Quantity, Motion and Quality but also what came to be known as \"the three moments of the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic world process]]\":\n*First, there existed the \"One\", and his view that \"the origin of things is a contemplation\"\n*The Second \"is certainly an activity\u2026 a secondary phase\u2026 life streaming from life\u2026 energy running through the universe\"\n*The Third is some kind of Intelligence concerning which he wrote \"Activity is prior to Intellection\u2026 and self knowledge\"<ref>''Ibid.'' III.8.5</ref>\n\nPlotinus likened the three to the centre, the radii and the circumference of a circle, and clearly thought that the principles underlying the categories were the first principles of creation. \"From a single root all being multiplies\". Similar ideas were to be introduced into Early Christian thought by, for example, [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] who summed it up saying \"Therefore Unity, having from all eternity arrived by motion at duality, came to rest in [[trinity]]\".<ref>Rawlinson A.E. (ed.) ''Essays on the Trinity and the Incarnation'' (Longmans, London, 1928) pp.241-244</ref>\n\n==Kant==\n\nIn the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781), [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that the [[Category (Kant)|categories]] are part of our own mental structure and consist of a set of ''a priori'' concepts through which we interpret the world around us.<ref>\t''Op.cit.3'' p.87</ref> These concepts correspond to twelve logical functions of the understanding which we use to make judgements and there are therefore two tables given in the ''Critique'', one of the Judgements and a corresponding one for the [[Category (Kant)|Categories]].<ref>''Ibid.'' pp.107,113</ref> To give an example, the logical function behind our reasoning from ground to consequence (based on the [[Hypothetical syllogism|Hypothetical relation]]) underlies our understanding of the world in terms of cause and effect (the [[Causality|Causal relation]]). In each table the number twelve arises from, firstly, an initial division into two: the Mathematical and the Dynamical; a second division of each of these headings into a further two: Quantity and Quality, and Relation and Modality respectively; and, thirdly, each of these then divides into a further three subheadings as follows.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\nTable of Judgements\n\nMathematical\n*Quantity\n**Universal\n**Particular\n**Singular\n*Quality\n**Affirmative\n**Negative\n**Infinite\nDynamical\n*Relation\n**Categorical\n**Hypothetical\n**Disjunctive\n*Modality\n**Problematic\n**Assertoric\n**Apodictic\n{{col-break}}\nTable of Categories\n\nMathematical\n*[[Quantity]]\n**Unity\n**Plurality\n**[[Absolute (philosophy)|Totality]]\n*[[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]]\n**[[Reality]]\n**[[Negation]]\n**Limitation\nDynamical\n*[[Relation of Ideas|Relation]]\n**[[Inherence]] and [[Subsistence]] ([[Substance theory|substance]] and [[accident]])\n**[[Causality]] and Dependence ([[cause]] and [[Result|effect]])\n**Community (reciprocity)\n*[[Modal logic|Modality]]\n**[[Logical possibility|Possibility]]\n**[[Existence]]\n**[[Need|Necessity]]\n{{col-end}}\n[[Critique of the Kantian philosophy|Criticism of Kant's system]] followed, firstly, by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who amongst other things was unhappy with the term \"Community\", and declared that the tables \"do open violence to truth, treating it as nature was treated by old-fashioned gardeners\",<ref>Schopenhauer A. ''The World as Will and Representation'' (tr. Payne A., Dover Publications, London, New York, 1966) p.430</ref> and secondly, by [[Walter Terence Stace|W.T.Stace]] who in his book ''The Philosophy of Hegel'' suggested that in order to make Kant's structure completely symmetrical a third category would need to be added to the Mathematical and the Dynamical.<ref>''Op.cit.15'' p.222</ref> This, he said, Hegel was to do with his category of Notion.\n\n==Hegel==\n[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel]] in his ''[[Science of Logic]]'' (1812) attempted to provide a more comprehensive system of categories than Kant and developed a structure that was almost entirely triadic.<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> So important were the categories to Hegel that he claimed \"the first principle of the world, the Absolute, is a system of categories\u2026 the categories must be the reason of which the world is a consequent\".<ref>''Ibid.'' pp.63,65</ref>\n\nUsing his own logical method of combination, later to be called the [[Dialectic|Hegelian dialectic]], of arguing from thesis through antithesis to synthesis, he arrived, as shown in W.T.Stace's work cited, at a hierarchy of some 270 categories. The three very highest categories were Logic, Nature and Spirit. The three highest categories of Logic, however, he called Being, Essence and Notion which he explained as follows:\n*[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Being]] was differentiated from Nothing by containing with it the concept of the \"Other\", an initial internal division that can be compared with Kant's category of Disjunction. Stace called the category of Being the sphere of common sense containing concepts such as consciousness, sensation, quantity, quality and measure.\n*[[Essence]]. The \"Other\" separates itself from the \"One\" by a kind of motion, reflected in Hegel's first synthesis of \"[[Becoming (philosophy)|Becoming]]\". For Stace this category represented the sphere of science containing within it firstly, the thing, its form and properties; secondly, cause, effect and reciprocity, and thirdly, the principles of classification, identity and difference. \n*[[Notion (philosophy)|Notion]]. Having passed over into the \"Other\" there is an almost [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic return]] into a higher unity that in embracing the \"One\" and the \"Other\" enables them to be considered together through their inherent qualities. This according to [[Walter Terence Stace|Stace]] is the sphere of philosophy proper where we find not only the three types of logical proposition: Disjunctive, Hypothetical and Categorical but also the three transcendental concepts of [[Transcendentals|Beauty, Goodness and Truth]].<ref>''Op.cit.18'' pp.124ff</ref>\n[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer's]] category that corresponded with Notion was that of Idea, which in his \"''Four-Fold Root of Sufficient Reason''\" he complemented with the category of the Will.<ref>''Op.cit.20''</ref> The title of his major work was \"[[The World as Will and Representation|The World as Will and Idea]]\". The two other complementary categories, reflecting one of Hegel's initial divisions, were those of Being and Becoming. At around the same time, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] was developing his colour theories in the ''[[Theory of Colours|Farbenlehre]]'' of 1810, and introduced similar principles of combination and complementation, symbolising, for Goethe, \"the primordial relations which belong both to nature and vision\".<ref>Goethe J.W. von, ''The Theory of Colours'' (tr. Eastlake C.L., MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1970) p.350</ref> [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] in his ''[[Science of Logic]]'' accordingly asks us to see his system not as a tree but as a circle.\n\n==Peirce==\n\n[[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who had read Kant and Hegel closely, and who also had some knowledge of Aristotle, proposed a system of merely three phenomenological categories: [[Categories (Peirce)|Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness]], which he repeatedly invoked in his subsequent writings. Like Hegel, C.S.Peirce attempted to develop a system of categories from a single indisputable principle, in Peirce's case the notion that in the first instance he could only be aware of his own ideas. \n\t\"It seems that the true categories of consciousness are first, feeling\u2026 second, a sense of resistance\u2026 and third, synthetic consciousness, or thought\".<ref>''Op.cit.5'' p.200, cf Locke</ref>\n\tElsewhere he called the three primary categories: [[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]], Reaction and [[Meaning (semiotics)|Meaning]], and even [[Categories (Peirce)|Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness]], saying, \"perhaps it is not right to call these categories conceptions, they are so intangible that they are rather tones or tints upon conceptions\":<ref>''Ibid.'' p.179</ref>     \n*Firstness ([[Quality (philosophy)|Quality]]): \"The first is predominant in feeling\u2026 we must think of a quality without parts, e.g. the colour of magenta\u2026 When I say it is a quality I do not mean that it \"inheres\" in a subject\u2026 The whole content of consciousness is made up of qualities of feeling, as truly as the whole of space is made up of points, or the whole of time by instants\".\n*Secondness (Reaction): \"This is present even in such a rudimentary fragment of experience as a simple feeling\u2026 an action and reaction between our soul and the stimulus\u2026 The idea of second is predominant in the ideas of causation and of statical force\u2026 the real is active; we acknowledge it by calling it the actual\".\n*Thirdness ([[Meaning (semiotics)|Meaning]]): \"Thirdness is essentially of a general nature\u2026 ideas in which thirdness predominate [include] the idea of a sign or representation\u2026 Every genuine triadic relation involves meaning\u2026 the idea of meaning is irreducible to those of quality and reaction\u2026 synthetical consciousness is the consciousness of a third or medium\".<ref>''Ibid.'' pp.148-179</ref>\n\nAlthough Peirce's three categories correspond to the three concepts of relation given in Kant's tables, the sequence is now reversed and follows that given by [[Science of Logic|Hegel]], and indeed before Hegel of the three moments of the world-process given by [[Neoplatonism|Plotinus]]. Later, Peirce gave a mathematical reason for there being three categories in that although monadic, dyadic and triadic nodes are irreducible, every node of a higher valency is reducible to a \"compound of triadic relations\".<ref>''Ibid.'' p.176</ref> [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who was developing \"semiology\" in France just as Peirce was developing \"semiotics\" in the US, likened each term of a proposition to \"the centre of a constellation, the point where other coordinate terms, the sum of which is indefinite, converge\".<ref>Saussure F. de,''Course in General Linguistics'' 1916 (tr. Harris R., Duckworth, London, 1983) p.124</ref>\n\n==Others==\n[[Edmund Husserl]] (1962, 2000) wrote extensively about categorial systems as part of his [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].\n\nFor [[Gilbert Ryle]] (1949), a category (in particular a \"[[category mistake]]\") is an important semantic concept, but one having only loose affinities to an ontological category.\n\nContemporary systems of categories have been proposed by [[John G.

In this way or by substitution for the cementitious and aggregate phases, the finished product can be tailored to its application.  Strength, density, as well as chemical and thermal resistance are variables.\n\n[[#Aggregates|Aggregate]] consists of large chunks of material in a concrete mix, generally a coarse [[gravel]] or crushed rocks such as [[limestone]], or [[granite]], along with finer materials such as [[sand]].\n\n[[#Cement|Cement]], most commonly [[Portland cement]], is associated with the general term \"concrete.\"  A range of other materials can be used as the cement in concrete too.  One of the most familiar of these alternative cements is [[asphalt concrete]]. Other cementitious materials, such as [[fly ash]] and [[slag cement]], are sometimes added as mineral admixtures (see below) \u2013 either pre-blended with the cement or directly as a concrete component \u2013 and become a part of the binder for the aggregate.\n\nTo produce concrete from most cements (excluding asphalt), [[water]] is mixed with the dry powder and aggregate, which produces a semi-liquid slurry that can be shaped, typically by pouring it into a form. The concrete solidifies and hardens through a [[Chemical reaction|chemical process]] called [[mineral hydration|hydration]]. The water reacts with the cement, which bonds the other components together, creating a robust stone-like material.\n\n[[#Chemical admixtures|Chemical admixtures]] are added to achieve varied properties. These ingredients may accelerate or slow down the rate at which the concrete hardens, and impart many other useful properties including increased tensile strength, entrainment of air and water resistance.\n\n[[#Reinforcement|Reinforcement]] is often included in concrete.  Concrete can be formulated with high [[compressive strength]], but always has lower [[tensile strength]].  For this reason it is usually reinforced with materials that are strong in tension, typically [[steel]] [[rebar]].\n\n[[#Mineral admixtures and blended cements|Mineral admixtures]] have become more popular over recent decades. The use of recycled materials as concrete ingredients has been gaining popularity because of increasingly stringent environmental legislation, and the discovery that such materials often have complementary and valuable properties. The most conspicuous of these are [[fly ash]], a by-product of [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired power plants]]; [[ground granulated blast furnace slag]], a byproduct of [[steelmaking]]; and [[silica fume]], a byproduct of industrial [[electric arc furnace]]s. The use of these materials in concrete reduces the amount of resources required, as the mineral admixtures act as a partial cement replacement. This displaces some cement production, an energetically expensive and environmentally problematic process, while reducing the amount of industrial waste that must be disposed of. Mineral admixtures can be pre-blended with the cement during its production for sale and use as a blended cement, or mixed directly with other components when the concrete is produced.\n\nThe ''[[types of concrete#Mix design|mix design]]'' depends on the type of structure being built, how the concrete is mixed and delivered, and how it is placed to form the structure.\n\n===Cement===\n{{main|Cement}}\n[[File:Stockage de ciments.JPG|thumb|Several tons of bagged cement, about two minutes of output from a 10,000 ton per day [[cement kiln]]]]\n\nPortland cement is the most common type of cement in general usage. It is a basic ingredient of concrete, [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and many [[plaster]]s. British masonry worker [[Joseph Aspdin]] patented Portland cement in 1824. It was named because of the similarity of its colour to [[Portland stone|Portland limestone]], quarried from the English [[Isle of Portland]] and used extensively in London architecture. It consists of a mixture of calcium silicates ([[alite]], [[belite]]), [[tricalcium aluminate|aluminates]] and [[calcium aluminoferrite|ferrites]] \u2013 compounds which combine calcium, silicon, aluminium and iron in forms which will react with water. Portland cement and similar materials are made by heating [[limestone]] (a source of calcium) with clay or shale (a source of silicon, aluminium and iron) and grinding this product (called ''[[clinker (cement)|clinker]]'') with a source of [[sulfate]] (most commonly [[gypsum]]).\n\nIn modern [[cement kiln]]s many advanced features are used to lower the fuel consumption per ton of clinker produced. Cement kilns are extremely large, complex, and inherently dusty industrial installations, and have emissions which must be controlled. Of the various ingredients used to produce a given quantity of concrete, the cement is the most energetically expensive. Even complex and efficient kilns require 3.3 to 3.6 gigajoules of energy to produce a ton of clinker and then [[Cement mill|grind it into cement]].

Concrete production is time-sensitive. Once the ingredients are mixed, workers must put the concrete in place before it hardens. In modern usage, most concrete production takes place in a large type of industrial facility called a [[concrete plant]], or often a batch plant.\n\nIn general usage, concrete plants come in two main types, ready mix plants and central mix plants.  A ready mix plant mixes all the ingredients except water, while a central mix plant mixes all the ingredients including water.  A central mix plant offers more accurate control of the concrete quality through better measurements of the amount of water added, but must be placed closer to the work site where the concrete will be used, since hydration begins at the plant.\n\nA concrete plant consists of large storage hoppers for various reactive ingredients like cement, storage for bulk ingredients like aggregate and water, mechanisms for the addition of various additives and amendments, machinery to accurately weigh, move, and mix some or all of those ingredients, and facilities to dispense the mixed concrete, often to a [[concrete mixer]] truck.\n\nModern concrete is usually prepared as a viscous fluid, so that it may be poured into forms, which are containers erected in the field to give the concrete its desired shape.  Concrete [[formwork]] can be prepared in several ways, such as [[Slip forming]] and [[Steel plate construction]].  Alternatively, concrete can be mixed into dryer, non-fluid forms and used in factory settings to manufacture [[Precast concrete]] products.\n\nA wide variety of equipment is used for processing concrete, from hand tools to heavy industrial machinery.  Whichever equipment builders use, however, the objective is to produce the desired building material; ingredients must be properly mixed, placed, shaped, and retained within time constraints. Any interruption in pouring the concrete can cause the initially placed material to begin to set before the next batch is added on top. This creates a horizontal plane of weakness called a ''cold joint'' between the two batches.<ref>[http://www.concrete.org.uk/fingertips-nuggets.asp?cmd=display&id=372 ''Cold Joints''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074543/http://www.concrete.org.uk/fingertips-nuggets.asp?cmd=display&id=372 |date=4 March 2016 }}, [[The Concrete Society]], accessed 2015-12-30</ref> Once the mix is where it should be, the curing process must be controlled to ensure that the concrete attains the desired attributes. During concrete preparation, various technical details may affect the quality and nature of the product.\n\nWhen initially mixed, Portland cement and water rapidly form a [[gel]] of tangled chains of interlocking crystals, and components of the gel continue to react over time. Initially the gel is fluid, which improves workability and aids in placement of the material, but as the concrete sets, the chains of crystals join into a rigid structure, counteracting the fluidity of the gel and fixing the particles of aggregate in place. During curing, the cement continues to react with the residual water in a process of [[hydration reaction|hydration]]. In properly formulated concrete, once this curing process has terminated the product has the desired physical and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]]. Among the qualities typically desired are [[Strength of materials|mechanical strength]], low moisture permeability, and chemical and volumetric stability.\n\n===Mixing===\n{{See also|Volumetric concrete mixer|Concrete mixer}}\nThorough mixing is essential for the production of uniform, high-quality concrete. For this reason equipment and methods should be capable of effectively mixing concrete materials containing the largest specified aggregate to produce ''uniform mixtures'' of the lowest slump practical for the work.\n\n''Separate paste mixing'' has shown that the mixing of cement and water into a paste before combining these materials with [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]] can increase the [[compressive strength]] of the resulting concrete.<ref>[http://www.concreteinternational.com/pages/featured_article.asp?ID=3491 Premixed cement paste] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928092034/http://www.concreteinternational.com/pages/featured_article.asp?ID=3491 |date=28 September 2007 }}.

Workability depends on water content, aggregate (shape and size distribution), cementitious content and age (level of [[hydration reaction|hydration]]) and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures, like superplasticizer. Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete workability. Excessive water leads to increased bleeding or [[Segregation in concrete|segregation of aggregates]] (when the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate blend with an undesirable gradation<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theconstructor.org/concrete/properties-of-fresh-concrete/6490/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116165251/http://theconstructor.org/concrete/properties-of-fresh-concrete/6490/ |archivedate=16 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump, which cannot readily be made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water. An undesirable gradation can mean using a large aggregate that is too large for the size of the formwork, or which has too few smaller aggregate grades to serve to fill the gaps between the larger grades, or using too little or too much sand for the same reason, or using too little water, or too much cement, or even using jagged crushed stone instead of smoother round aggregate such as pebbles.  Any combination of these factors and others may result in a mix which is too harsh, i.e., which does not flow or spread out smoothly, is difficult to get into the formwork, and which is difficult to surface finish.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.concretenetwork.com/aggregate/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202232307/https://www.concretenetwork.com/aggregate/ |archivedate=2 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nWorkability can be measured by the [[concrete slump test]], a simple measure of the plasticity of a fresh batch of concrete following the [[ASTM]] C 143 or EN 12350-2 test standards. Slump is normally measured by filling an \"[[Duff Abrams|Abrams cone]]\" with a sample from a fresh batch of concrete. The cone is placed with the wide end down onto a level, non-absorptive surface. It is then filled in three layers of equal volume, with each layer being tamped with a steel rod to consolidate the layer. When the cone is carefully lifted off, the enclosed material slumps a certain amount, owing to gravity. A relatively dry sample slumps very little, having a slump value of one or two inches (25 or 50&nbsp;mm) out of one foot (305&nbsp;mm). A relatively wet concrete sample may slump as much as eight inches. Workability can also be measured by the [[flow table test]].\n\nSlump can be increased by addition of chemical admixtures such as plasticizer or [[superplasticizer]] without changing the [[water-cement ratio]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ferrari|first1=L|last2=Kaufmann|first2=J|last3=Winnefeld|first3=F|last4=Plank|first4=J|title=Multi-method approach to study influence of superplasticizers on cement suspensions|journal=Cement and Concrete Research|volume=41|page=1058|date=2011|doi=10.1016/j.cemconres.2011.06.010|issue=10}}</ref> Some other admixtures, especially air-entraining admixture, can increase the slump of a mix.\n\nHigh-flow concrete, like [[self-consolidating concrete]], is tested by other flow-measuring methods. One of these methods includes placing the cone on the narrow end and observing how the mix flows through the cone while it is gradually lifted.\n\nAfter mixing, concrete is a fluid and can be pumped to the location where needed.\n\n===Curing===\n[[File:Curing-concrete.jpg|thumb|A concrete slab being kept hydrated during water curing by submersion (ponding)]]\n\nConcrete must be kept moist during curing in order to achieve optimal strength and durability.<ref>\"Curing Concrete\" Peter C.

This [[carbonation]] reaction, however, lowers the pH of the cement pore solution and can corrode the reinforcement bars.\n\nHydration and hardening of concrete during the first three days is critical. Abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased tensile stresses at a time when it has not yet gained sufficient strength, resulting in greater shrinkage cracking. The early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during the curing process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking. High-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster, often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking. The strength of concrete changes (increases) for up to three years. It depends on cross-section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation.<ref>Resulting strength distribution in vertical elements researched and presented at the article [http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf \"Concrete inhomogeneity of vertical cast-in-place elements in skeleton-type buildings\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403132318/http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf |date=3 April 2015 }}</ref> Addition of short-cut polymer fibers can improve (reduce) shrinkage-induced stresses during curing and increase early and ultimate compression strength.<ref>[http://www.minifibers.com/documents/ADMIXUS-Admixtures-for-Cementitious-Applications.pdf \"Admixtures for Cementitious Applications.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017073633/http://www.minifibers.com/documents/ADMIXUS-Admixtures-for-Cementitious-Applications.pdf |date=17 October 2016 }}</ref>\n\nProperly curing concrete leads to increased strength and lower permeability and avoids cracking where the surface dries out prematurely. Care must also be taken to avoid freezing or overheating due to the [[exothermic]] setting of cement. Improper curing can cause [[Spalling#Spalling in mechanical weathering|scaling]], reduced strength, poor [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] resistance and [[fracture|cracking]].\n\n====Techniques====\nDuring the curing period, concrete is ideally maintained at controlled temperature and humidity. To ensure full hydration during curing, concrete slabs are often sprayed with \"curing compounds\" that create a water-retaining film over the concrete.  Typical films are made of wax or related hydrophobic compounds.  After the concrete is sufficiently cured, the film is allowed to abrade from the concrete through normal use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daytonsuperior.com/docs/default-source/tech-data-sheets/section-05---curing-compounds.pdf?sfvrsn=3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208184425/http://www.daytonsuperior.com/docs/default-source/tech-data-sheets/section-05---curing-compounds.pdf?sfvrsn=3 |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nTraditional conditions for curing involve by spraying or ponding the concrete surface with water.  The adjacent picture shows one of many ways to achieve this, ponding&nbsp;\u2013 submerging setting concrete in water and wrapping in plastic to prevent dehydration. Additional common curing methods include wet burlap and plastic sheeting covering the fresh concrete.\n\nFor higher-strength applications, [[accelerated curing]] techniques may be applied to the concrete.  One common technique involves heating the poured concrete with steam, which serves to both keep it damp and raise the temperature, so that the hydration process proceeds more quickly and more thoroughly.\n\n==Specialty types==\n{{main|Types of concrete}}\n\n===Pervious===\n{{Main|Pervious concrete}}\nPervious concrete is a mix of specially graded coarse aggregate, cement, water and little-to-no fine aggregates. This concrete is also known as \"no-fines\" or porous concrete. Mixing the ingredients in a carefully controlled process creates a paste that coats and bonds the aggregate particles. The hardened concrete contains interconnected air voids totalling approximately 15 to 25 percent. Water runs through the voids in the pavement to the soil underneath. Air entrainment admixtures are often used in freeze\u2013thaw climates to minimize\nthe possibility of frost damage.\n\n===Nanoconcrete===\n[[File:Decorative cameo plate.jpg|thumbnail|Decorative plate made of Nano concrete with High-Energy Mixing (HEM)]]\n[[File:Nanoconcrete pavement, Blakeslee, PA.jpg|thumb|Two-layered pavers, pigmented top layer made of HEM nanoconcrete]]\n\nNanoconcrete is created by high-energy mixing (HEM) of cement, sand and water. To ensure the mixing is thorough enough to create nano-concrete, the mixer must apply a total mixing power to the mixture of 30\u2013600 [[watt]]s per kilogram of the mix.  This mixing must continue long enough to yield a net [[Energy density|specific energy]] expended upon the mix of at least 5000 [[joule]]s per kilogram of the mix.<ref>{{Citation | editor-last = Fridman  | editor-first = Vladen  | issue-date = August 22, 1995  | title = Method for producing Construction Mixture for concrete | country-code = US | series-number = 5443313}}</ref> A [[plasticizer]] or a [[superplasticizer]] is then added to the activated mixture which can later be mixed with aggregates in a conventional [[concrete mixer]]. In the HEM process, the intense mixing of cement and water with sand provides dissipation of energy and increases shear stresses on the surface of cement particles. This intense mixing serves to divide the cement particles into extremely fine nanometer scale sizes, which provides for extremely thorough mixing.  This results in the increased volume of water interacting with cement and acceleration of [[Calcium Silicate Hydrate]] (C-S-H) colloid creation.\n\nThe initial natural process of cement hydration with formation of colloidal globules about 5&nbsp;nm in diameter<ref>{{cite journal | last1 =Raki | first1 =Laila | first2 =James | last2 =Beaudoin | first3 =Rouhollah | last3 =Alizadeh | first4 =Jon | last4 =Makar | first5 =Taijiro | last5 =Sato | title =Cement and Concrete Nanoscience and Nanotechnology | journal =Materials | doi =10.3390/ma3020918 | volume =3 | issue =2 | pages =918\u2013942 | publisher =National Research Council Canada, Institute for Research in Construction | date =2010 | url =http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/3/2/918/pdf | issn =1996-1944 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150315015437/http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/3/2/918/pdf | archivedate =15 March 2015 | df =dmy-all }}</ref> spreads into the entire volume of cement \u2013 water matrix as the energy expended upon the mix approaches and exceeds 5000 joules per kilogram.\n\nThe liquid activated high-energy mixture can be used by itself for casting small architectural details and decorative items, or foamed ([[Expanded polystyrene concrete|expanded]]) for [[lightweight concrete]]. HEM Nanoconcrete hardens in low and subzero temperature conditions and possesses an increased volume of gel, which reduces [[capillarity]] in solid and porous materials.\n\n===Microbial===\nBacteria such as ''[[Bacillus pasteurii]]'', ''[[Bacillus pseudofirmus]]'', ''Bacillus cohnii'', ''Sporosarcina pasteuri'', and ''[[Arthrobacter crystallopoietes]]'' increase the compression strength of concrete through their biomass.

The cement is more costly than lime-based cements, but polymer concretes nevertheless have advantages, they have significant tensile strength even without reinforcement, and they are largely impervious to water. They are frequently used for repair and construction of other applications such as drains.\n\n==Safety==\nGrinding of concrete can produce [[hazardous dust]]. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] in the United States recommends attaching local exhaust ventilation shrouds to electric concrete grinders to control the spread of this dust.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/wp-solutions/2009-115/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - Control of Hazardous Dust When Grinding Concrete (2009-115)|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-07-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820025433/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/wp-solutions/2009-115/|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n{{Main|Properties of concrete}}\nConcrete has relatively high [[compressive strength]], but much lower [[tensile strength]].{{clarify|reason=no comparators specified - relatively to what? Lower than what?|date=June 2018}}  For this reason it is usually reinforced with materials that are strong in tension (often steel). The elasticity of concrete is relatively constant at low stress levels but starts decreasing at higher stress levels as matrix cracking develops. Concrete has a very low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] and shrinks as it matures. All concrete structures crack to some extent, due to shrinkage and tension. Concrete that is subjected to long-duration forces is prone to [[Creep (deformation)|creep]].\n\nTests can be performed to ensure that the properties of concrete correspond to specifications for the application.\n[[File:Concrete Compression Testing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Compression testing of a concrete cylinder]]\n\nDifferent mixes of concrete ingredients produce different strengths. Concrete strength values are usually specified as the lower-bound compressive strength of either a cylindrical or cubic specimen as determined by standard test procedures.\n\nDifferent strengths of concrete are used for different purposes.  Very low-strength \u2013 {{convert|14|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} or less \u2013  concrete may be used when the concrete must be lightweight.<ref name=lightweight>{{cite web|title=Structural lightweight concrete|url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Structural%20Lightweight%20Concrete_tcm45-345994.pdf|work=Concrete Construction|publisher=The Aberdeen Group|date=March 1981|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511221842/http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Structural%20Lightweight%20Concrete_tcm45-345994.pdf|archivedate=11 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Lightweight concrete is often achieved by adding air, foams, or lightweight aggregates, with the side effect that the strength is reduced.  For most routine uses, {{convert|20|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|32|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} concrete is often used.  {{convert|40|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} concrete is readily commercially available as a more durable, although more expensive, option.

An early example at Hoover Dam used a network of pipes between vertical concrete placements to circulate cooling water during the curing process to avoid damaging overheating.  Similar systems are still used; depending on volume of the pour, the concrete mix used, and ambient air temperature, the cooling process may last for many months after the concrete is placed. Various methods also are used to pre-cool the concrete mix in mass concrete structures.<ref name=\"BerkCE\"/>\n\nAnother approach to mass concrete structures that minimizes cement's thermal byproduct is the use of [[roller-compacted concrete]], which uses a dry mix which has a much lower cooling requirement than conventional wet placement. It is deposited in thick layers as a semi-dry material then roller [[compactor|compacted]] into a dense, strong mass.\n\n===Surface finishes===\n{{main|Decorative concrete}}\n[[File:Smpolishedconcrete2.jpg|thumb|Black basalt polished concrete floor]]\nRaw concrete surfaces tend to be porous, and have a relatively uninteresting appearance. Many different finishes can be applied to improve the appearance and preserve the surface against staining, water penetration, and freezing.\n\nExamples of improved appearance include [[stamped concrete]] where the wet concrete has a pattern impressed on the surface, to give a paved, cobbled or brick-like effect, and may be accompanied with coloration. Another popular effect for flooring and table tops is [[polished concrete]] where the concrete is polished optically flat with diamond abrasives and sealed with polymers or other sealants.\n\nOther finishes can be achieved with chiselling, or more conventional techniques such as painting or covering it with other materials.\n\nThe proper treatment of the surface of concrete, and therefore its characteristics, is an important stage in the construction and renovation of architectural structures.<ref>^ Sadowski, \u0141ukasz; Mathia, Thomas. \"Multi-scale Metrology of Concrete Surface Morphology: Fundamentals and specificity\".

This can greatly reduce the weight of beams or slabs, by\nbetter distributing the stresses in the structure to make optimal use of the reinforcement. For example, a horizontal beam tends to sag. Prestressed reinforcement along the bottom of the beam counteracts this.\nIn pre-tensioned concrete, the prestressing is achieved by using steel or polymer tendons or bars that are subjected to a tensile force prior to casting, or for post-tensioned concrete, after casting.\n\nMore than {{convert|55000|mi|km}} of highways in the United States are paved with this material. [[Reinforced concrete]], [[prestressed concrete]] and [[precast concrete]] are the most widely used [[types of concrete]] functional extensions in modern days. See [[Brutalism]].\n\n===Cold weather placement===\n[[Extreme weather]] conditions (extreme heat or cold; windy condition, and humidity variations) can significantly alter the quality of concrete. Many precautions are observed in cold weather placement.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.fprimec.com/cold-weather-concreting|title=Winter is Coming!

Preventing freezing is the most important precaution, as formation of ice crystals can cause damage to the crystalline structure of the hydrated cement paste. If the surface of the concrete pour is insulated from the outside temperatures, the heat of hydration will prevent freezing.\n\nThe [[American Concrete Institute]] (ACI) definition of cold weather placmement, '''ACI 306''',<ref>{{cite web|title=306R-16 Guide to Cold Weather Concreting|url=https://www.concrete.org/store/productdetail.aspx?ItemID=30616|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915204757/https://www.concrete.org/store/productdetail.aspx?ItemID=30616|archivedate=15 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> is:\n* A period when for more than three successive days the average daily air temperature drops below 40 \u02daF (~ 4.5&nbsp;\u00b0C), and\n* Temperature stays below 50 \u02daF (10&nbsp;\u00b0C) for more than one-half of any 24 hour period.\nIn Canada, where temperatures tend to be much lower during the cold season, the following criteria are used by [[Canadian Standards Agency|CSA]] A23.1:\n* When the air temperature is \u2264 5&nbsp;\u00b0C, and\n* When there is a probability that the temperature may fall below 5&nbsp;\u00b0C within 24 hours of placing the concrete.\n\nThe minimum strength before exposing concrete to extreme cold is 500 psi (3.5 MPa). CSA A 23.1 specified a compressive strength of 7.0 MPa to be considered safe for exposure to freezing.\n\n===Roads===\n[[Road surface#Concrete|Concrete roads]] are more fuel efficient to drive on,<ref>{{cite web|title=Mapping of Excess Fuel Consumption|url=https://cshub.mit.edu/news/lca-research-brief-mapping-excess-fuel-consumption|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102190351/https://cshub.mit.edu/news/lca-research-brief-mapping-excess-fuel-consumption|archivedate=2 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> more reflective and last significantly longer than other paving surfaces, yet have a much smaller market share than other paving solutions. Modern-paving methods and design practices have changed the economics of concrete paving, so that a well-designed and placed concrete pavement will be less expensive on initial costs and significantly less expensive over the life cycle. Another major benefit is that [[pervious concrete]] can be used, which eliminates the need to place [[storm drain]]s near the road, and reducing the need for slightly sloped roadway to help rainwater to run off. No longer requiring discarding rainwater through use of drains also means that less electricity is needed (more pumping is otherwise needed in the water-distribution system), and no rainwater gets polluted as it no longer mixes with polluted water. Rather, it is immediately absorbed by the ground.\n\n===Energy efficiency===\nEnergy requirements for transportation of concrete are low because it is produced locally from local resources, typically manufactured within 100 kilometers of the job site. Similarly, relatively little energy is used in producing and combining the raw materials (although large amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> are produced by the chemical reactions in [[Cement#CO2 emissions|cement manufacture]]).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rubenstein|first1=Madeleine|title=Emissions from the Cement Industry|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/05/09/emissions-from-the-cement-industry/|website=State of the Planet|publisher=Earth Institute, Columbia University|accessdate=13 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222053719/http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/05/09/emissions-from-the-cement-industry/|archivedate=22 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The overall [[embodied energy]] of concrete at roughly 1 to 1.5 megajoules per kilogram is therefore lower than for most structural and construction materials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://strineenvironments.com.au/factsheets/concrete-and-embodied-energy-can-using-concrete-be-carbon-neutral/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116174733/http://strineenvironments.com.au/factsheets/concrete-and-embodied-energy-can-using-concrete-be-carbon-neutral/ |archivedate=16 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOnce in place, concrete offers great energy efficiency over the lifetime of a building.<ref>John Gajda (2001) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110916080530/http://www.arxx.com/Assets/CMS/WYSIWYGBase/file/5825%20PCA%20CD026.pdf Energy Use of Single Family Houses with Various Exterior Walls], Construction Technology Laboratories Inc.</ref> Concrete walls leak air far less than those made of wood frames.<ref>{{cite book|title=Green Building with Concrete|publisher=Taylor & Francis Group|isbn=978-1-4987-0411-3}}</ref> Air leakage accounts for a large percentage of energy loss from a home.

Modern concrete wall systems use both external insulation and thermal mass to create an energy-efficient building. Insulating concrete forms (ICFs) are hollow blocks or panels made of either insulating foam or [[rastra]] that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.\n\n===Fire safety===\n[[File:1981 BostonCityHall byLebovich8 HABS MA1176.jpg|thumb|[[Boston City Hall]] (1968) is a [[Brutalist]] design constructed largely of precast and poured in place concrete. It was voted \"The World's Ugliest Building\" in 2008]]\n\nConcrete buildings are more resistant to fire than those constructed using steel frames, since concrete has lower heat conductivity than steel and can thus last longer under the same fire conditions. Concrete is sometimes used as a fire protection for steel frames, for the same effect as above. Concrete as a fire shield, for example [[Fondu fyre]], can also be used in extreme environments like a missile launch pad.\n\nOptions for non-combustible construction include floors, ceilings and roofs made of cast-in-place and hollow-core precast concrete. For walls, concrete masonry technology and [[Insulating concrete forms|Insulating Concrete Forms]] (ICFs) are additional options. ICFs are hollow blocks or panels made of fireproof insulating foam that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.\n\nConcrete also provides good resistance against externally applied forces such as high winds, hurricanes, and tornadoes owing to its lateral stiffness, which results in minimal horizontal movement. However this stiffness can work against certain types of concrete structures, particularly where a relatively higher flexing structure is required to resist more extreme forces.\n\n===Earthquake safety===\nAs discussed above, concrete is very strong in compression, but weak in tension. Larger earthquakes can generate very large shear loads on structures. These shear loads subject the structure to both tensile and compressional loads. Concrete structures without reinforcement, like other unreinforced masonry structures, can fail during severe earthquake shaking. Unreinforced masonry structures constitute one of the largest earthquake risks globally.<ref>[http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=4067 Unreinforced Masonry Buildings and Earthquakes: Developing Successful Risk Reduction Programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912163041/http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=4067 |date=12 September 2011 }}, FEMA P-774 / October 2009</ref> These risks can be reduced through seismic retrofitting of at-risk buildings, (e.g. school buildings in Istanbul, Turkey<ref>[http://www.curee.org/architecture/docs/S08-034.pdf Seismic Retrofit Design Of Historic Century-Old School Buildings In Istanbul, Turkey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111151034/http://www.curee.org/architecture/docs/S08-034.pdf |date=11 January 2012 }}, C.C.

Concrete debris was once routinely shipped to [[landfill]]s for disposal, but recycling is increasing due to improved environmental awareness, governmental laws and economic benefits.\n\nConcrete, which must be free of trash, wood, paper and other such materials, is collected from demolition sites and put through a [[crusher|crushing machine]], often along with [[asphalt]], bricks and rocks.\n\nReinforced concrete contains [[rebar]] and other metallic reinforcements, which are removed with [[magnet]]s and recycled elsewhere. The remaining aggregate chunks are sorted by size. Larger chunks may go through the crusher again. Smaller pieces of concrete are used as gravel for new construction projects. [[Aggregate base]] gravel is laid down as the lowest layer in a road, with fresh concrete or asphalt placed over it. Crushed recycled concrete can sometimes be used as the dry aggregate for brand new concrete if it is free of contaminants, though the use of recycled concrete limits strength and is not allowed in many jurisdictions.

The researchers found that 11 of the 27 men (41%) produced pre-ejaculatory samples that contained sperm, and 10 of these samples (37%) contained a \"fair amount\" of motile sperm (i.e. as few as 1 million to as many as 35 million).<ref name=\"Killick\"/>\nThis study therefore recommends, in order to minimise unintended pregnancy and disease transmission, the use of condom from the first moment of genital contact.\nAs a point of reference, a study showed that, of couples who conceived within a year of trying, only 2.5% included a male partner with a total sperm count (per ejaculate) of 23 million sperm or less.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=T.G. |author2=Noonan, E. |author3=von Eckaedstein, S. |author4=Auger, J. |author5=Baker, H.W.G. |author6=Behre, H.M. |title=World Health Organisation reference values for human semen characteristics|journal=Human Reproduction Update|year=2010|volume=16|pages=231\u2013245|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmp048|pmid=19934213|issue=3|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\nHowever, across a wide range of observed values, total sperm count (as with other identified semen and sperm characteristics) has weak power to predict which couples are at risk of pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Slama|first=R.|author2=Eustache, F.|title=Time to pregnancy and semen parameters:  a cross-sectional study among fertile couples from four European cities|journal=Human Reproduction|year=2002|volume=17|pages=513|issue=2|doi=10.1093/humrep/17.2.503|display-authors=etal|pmid=11821304}}</ref>\n\nIt is widely believed that urinating after an ejaculation will flush the urethra of remaining sperm.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Withdrawal Method | work = Planned Parenthood |date=March 2004 | url =http://www.plannedparenthood.com/health-topics/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method-4218.htm | accessdate = 2006-09-01 }}</ref> Therefore, some of the subjects in the March 2011 study who produced sperm in their pre-ejaculate did urinate (sometimes more than once) before producing their sample.<ref name=\"Killick\"/> Therefore, some males can release the pre-ejaculate fluid containing sperm without a previous ejaculation.\n\n== Advantages ==\nThe advantage of coitus interruptus is that it can be used by people who have objections to, or do not have access to, other forms of contraception.

It is important that some space be left in the tip of the condom so that semen has a place to collect; otherwise it may be forced out of the base of the device. Most condoms have a teat end for this purpose. After use, it is recommended the condom be wrapped in tissue or tied in a knot, then disposed of in a trash receptacle.<ref name=\"AliceDisposal\" /> Condoms are used to reduce the likelihood of pregnancy during intercourse and to reduce the likelihood of contracting sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). Condoms are also used during fellatio to reduce the likelihood of contracting STIs.\n\nSome couples find that putting on a condom interrupts sex, although others incorporate condom application as part of their foreplay. Some men and women find the physical barrier of a condom dulls sensation. Advantages of dulled sensation can include prolonged erection and delayed ejaculation; disadvantages might include a loss of some sexual excitement.<ref name=\"planned parenthood\" /> Advocates of condom use also cite their advantages of being inexpensive, easy to use, and having few side effects.<ref name=\"planned parenthood\" /><ref name=\"fwhc\">{{cite web|title=Male Condom |publisher=Feminist Women's Health Center |date=October 18, 2007 |url=http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/condom.htm |accessdate=2007-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121011004/http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/condom.htm |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Adult film industry ===\nIn 2012 proponents gathered 372,000 voter signatures through a citizens' initiative in Los Angeles County to put [[Measure B]] on the 2012 ballot.

These are most commonly obtained through [[masturbation]], but an alternative to masturbation is use of a special ''collection condom'' to collect semen during sexual intercourse.\n\nCollection condoms are made from silicone or polyurethane, as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm. Many men prefer collection condoms to masturbation, and some religions prohibit masturbation entirely. Also, compared with samples obtained from masturbation, semen samples from collection condoms have higher total sperm counts, sperm motility, and percentage of sperm with normal morphology. For this reason, they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis, and to improve the chances of pregnancy when used in procedures such as intracervical or intrauterine [[Artificial insemination|insemination]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Sofikitis NV, Miyagawa I |title=Endocrinological, biophysical, and biochemical parameters of semen collected via masturbation versus sexual intercourse |journal=J.

Private [[sperm donors]] may also use a collection condom to obtain samples through masturbation or by sexual intercourse with a partner and will transfer the ejaculate from the collection condom to a specially designed container. The sperm is transported in such containers, in the case of a donor, to a recipient woman to be used for insemination, and in the case of a woman's partner, to a fertility clinic for processing and use. However, transportation may reduce the fecundity of the sperm. Collection condoms may also be used where semen is produced at a sperm bank or fertility clinic.\n\n''Condom therapy'' is sometimes prescribed to infertile couples when the female has high levels of [[antisperm antibodies]]. The theory is that preventing exposure to her partner's semen will lower her level of antisperm antibodies, and thus increase her chances of pregnancy when condom therapy is discontinued. However, condom therapy has not been shown to increase subsequent pregnancy rates.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0272.1979.tb02229.x |vauthors=Franken D, Slabber C |title=Experimental findings with spermantibodies: condom therapy (a case report) | journal = Andrologia | volume = 11 | issue = 6 |pages=413\u20136 |year=1979 | pmid = 532982}}<br />\n{{cite journal |author=Greentree L |title=Antisperm antibodies in infertility: the role of condom therapy | journal = Fertil Steril | volume = 37 | issue = 3 |pages=451\u20132 |year=1982 | pmid = 7060795}}<br />\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Kremer J, Jager S, Kuiken J |title=Treatment of infertility caused by antisperm antibodies | journal = Int J Fertil | volume = 23 | issue = 4 |pages=270\u20136 |year=1978 | pmid = 33920}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\n<!--\n\nIMPORTANT: When adding a new listing, please include a reliable source that discusses the use.

This type of condom was the original \"capote\" (French for condom), perhaps because of its resemblance to a woman's bonnet worn at that time, also called a [[Bonnet (headgear)|capote]].\n\nFor many decades, rubber condoms were manufactured by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis-shaped molds, then dipping the wrapped molds in a chemical solution to cure the rubber.<ref name=\"collier\" />{{Rp|148}} In 1912, Polish inventor [[Julius Fromm]] developed a new, improved manufacturing technique for condoms: dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution.<ref name=\"billy\" /> Called ''cement dipping'', this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid.<ref name=\"collier\" />{{Rp|200}} [[Latex]], rubber suspended in water, was invented in 1920. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, which had to be smoothed by rubbing and trimming. The use of water to suspend the rubber instead of [[gasoline]] and [[benzene]] eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories. Latex condoms also performed better for the consumer: they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms, and had a shelf life of five years (compared to three months for rubber).<ref name=\"collier\" />{{Rp|199\u2013200}}\n\nUntil the twenties, all condoms were individually hand-dipped by semi-skilled workers. Throughout the decade of the 1920s, advances in the automation of the condom assembly line were made. The first fully automated line was patented in 1930. Major condom manufacturers bought or leased conveyor systems, and small manufacturers were driven out of business.<ref name=\"collier\" />{{Rp|201\u20133}} The skin condom, now significantly more expensive than the latex variety, became restricted to a niche high-end market.<ref name=\"collier\" />{{Rp|220}}\n\n=== 1930 to present ===\nIn 1930 the Anglican Church's [[Lambeth Conferences#Seventh: 1930|Lambeth Conference]] sanctioned the use of birth control by married couples.

Established couples on the other hand have few concerns about STDs, and can use other methods of birth control such as [[birth control pill|the pill]], which does not act as a barrier to intimate sexual contact. Note that the polar debate with regard to condom usage is attenuated by the target group the argument is directed. Notably the age category and stable partner question are factors, as well as the distinction between heterosexual and homosexuals, who have different kinds of sex and have different risk consequences and factors.\n\nAmong the prime objections to condom usage is the blocking of erotic sensation, or the intimacy that barrier-free sex provides. As the condom is held tightly to the skin of the penis, it diminishes the delivery of stimulation through rubbing and friction. Condom proponents claim this has the benefit of making sex last longer, by diminishing sensation and delaying male ejaculation. Those who promote condom-free heterosexual sex (slang: \"[[Bareback (sex)|bareback]]\") claim that the condom puts a prophylactic barrier between partners, diminishing what is normally a highly sensual, intimate, and spiritual connection between partners.\n\n=== Religious ===\n\n{{See also|Catholic teachings on sexual morality#Contraception|Catholic Church and HIV/AIDS}}\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] opposes all kinds of sexual acts outside of marriage, as well as any sexual act in which the chance of successful conception has been reduced by [[direct and intentional]] acts (for example, [[Human sterilization|surgery to prevent conception]]) or foreign objects (for example, condoms).<ref>{{cite web|title=Human\u00e6 Vit\u00e6 |author=[[Pope Paul VI]] |date=1968-07-25 |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xI2Wz6n5?url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |archivedate=2011-03-19 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe use of condoms to prevent [[Sexually Transmitted Infections|STI]] transmission is not specifically addressed by Catholic doctrine, and is currently a topic of debate among theologians and high-ranking Catholic authorities.

From the time of his original formulation until the end of the 1970s, cladistics competed as an analytical and philosophical approach to phylogenetic inference with [[phenetics]] and so-called [[evolutionary taxonomy]]. Phenetics was championed at this time by the [[Numerical taxonomy|numerical taxonomists]] [[Peter Sneath]] and [[Robert Sokal]] and the evolutionary taxonomist [[Ernst Mayr]].\n\nOriginally conceived, if only in essence, by Willi Hennig in a book published in 1950, cladistics did not flourish until its translation into English in 1966 (Lewin 1997). Today, cladistics is the most popular method for constructing phylogenies from morphological and molecular data. Unlike phenetics, cladistics is specifically aimed at reconstructing evolutionary histories.\n\nIn the 1990s, the development of effective [[polymerase chain reaction]] techniques allowed the application of cladistic methods to [[biochemical]] and [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] traits of organisms, as well as to anatomical ones, vastly expanding the amount of data available for phylogenetics. At the same time, cladistics rapidly became the dominant set of methods of phylogenetics in evolutionary biology, because [[computer]]s made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics.\n\nThe way for [[computational phylogenetics]] was paved by [[phenetics]],<ref>{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|p=221}}</ref> a set of methods commonly used from the 1950s to 1980s and to some degree later. Phenetics did not try to reconstruct phylogenetic trees; rather, it tried to build [[dendrograms]] from similarity data; its algorithms required less computer power than phylogenetic ones.\n\n== Methodology ==\n{{Main|Phylogenetics|Cladogram}}\n{{See also|Phylogenetic tree}}\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe cladistic method interprets each character state transformation implied by the distribution of shared character states among taxa (or other terminals) as a potential piece of evidence for grouping. The outcome of a cladistic analysis is a [[cladogram]] \u2013 a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]]-shaped diagram ([[dendrogram]])<ref>{{Harvnb|Weygoldt|1998}}</ref> that is interpreted to represent the best hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships. Although traditionally such cladograms were generated largely on the basis of morphological characters and originally calculated by hand, [[DNA sequencing|genetic sequencing]] data and [[computational phylogenetics]] are now commonly used in phylogenetic analyses, and the [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimony]] criterion has been abandoned by many phylogeneticists in favor of more \"sophisticated\" but less parsimonious evolutionary models of character state transformation. Cladists contend that these models are unjustified.{{Why|date=May 2013}}\n\nEvery cladogram is based on a particular dataset analyzed with a particular method. Datasets are tables consisting of [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular]], morphological, [[Ethology|ethological]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Jerison|2003|p=254}}</ref> and/or other characters and a list of [[operational taxonomic unit]]s (OTUs), which may be genes, individuals, populations, species, or larger taxa that are presumed to be monophyletic and therefore to form, all together, one large clade; phylogenetic analysis infers the branching pattern within that clade. Different datasets and different methods, not to mention violations of the mentioned assumptions, often result in different cladograms. Only scientific investigation can show which is more likely to be correct.\n\nUntil recently, for example, cladograms like the following have generally been accepted as accurate representations of the ancestral relations among turtles, lizards, crocodilians, and birds:<ref>{{Citation |title=Vertebrate Palaeontology |last=Benton |first=Michael J. |authorlink=Michael Benton |year=2005 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-0-632-05637-8 |pages=214, 233}}</ref>\n<center>\n{{clade\n  |label1=&nbsp;&nbsp;{{color|LimeGreen|\u25bc}}\n  |{{clade\n       |label1=[[Turtle|Testudines]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n       |1=[[turtle]]s\n       |label2=[[Diapsid]]a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{font|size=150%|color=OrangeRed|text=\u2666}}\n       |2={{clade\n            |label1=[[Lepidosauria]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n            |1=[[lizard]]s\n            |label2=[[Archosaur]]ia\n            |2={{clade\n                 |label1=[[Crocodylomorpha]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n                 |1=[[crocodilia]]ns\n                 |label2=[[Dinosaur]]ia\n                 |2=[[bird]]s\n               }}\n          }}\n     }}\n}}\n</center>\n\nIf this phylogenetic hypothesis is correct, then the last common ancestor of turtles and birds, at the branch near the {{color|LimeGreen|\u25bc}} lived earlier than the last common ancestor of lizards and birds, near the {{font|size=150%|color=OrangeRed|text=\u2666}}.

Since the cladograms provide competing accounts of real events, at most one of them is correct.\n\n[[File:Monophyly, paraphyly, polyphyly.png|thumb|400px|right|Cladogram of the [[primate]]s, showing a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] taxon (a [[clade]]: the simians or Anthropoidea, in yellow), a [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] taxon (the prosimians, in blue, including the red patch), and a [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] taxon (the nocturnal primates \u2013 the [[loris]]es and the [[tarsier]]s \u2013 in red)]]\n\nThe cladogram to the right represents the current universally accepted hypothesis that all [[primate]]s, including [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhines]] like the [[lemur]]s and [[loris]]es, had a common ancestor all of whose descendants were primates, and so form a clade; the name Primates is therefore recognized for this clade. Within the primates, all anthropoids (monkeys, apes and humans) are hypothesized to have had a common ancestor all of whose descendants were anthropoids, so they form the clade called Anthropoidea. The \"prosimians\", on the other hand, form a paraphyletic taxon. The name Prosimii is not used in [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], which names only clades; the \"prosimians\" are instead divided between the clades [[Strepsirrhini|Strepsirhini]] and [[Haplorhini]], where the latter contains Tarsiiformes and Anthropoidea.\n\n{{clear}}\n== Terminology for character states ==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}\nThe following terms, coined by Hennig, are used to identify shared or distinct character states among groups:<ref name=\"Patterson 1982\">{{harvnb|Patterson|1982|pp=21\u201374}}</ref><ref name=\"Patterson 1988\">{{Harvnb|Patterson|1988}}</ref><ref name=\"de Pinna 1991\">{{Harvnb|de Pinna|1991}}</ref>\n* {{anchor|plesiomorphy}} A '''[[plesiomorphy]]''' (\"close form\") or '''ancestral state''' is a character state that a taxon has retained from its ancestors. When two or more taxa that are not nested within each other share a plesiomorphy, it is a '''symplesiomorphy''' (from ''syn-'', \"together\"). Symplesiomorphies do not mean that the taxa that exhibit that character state are necessarily closely related. For example, Reptilia is traditionally characterized by (among other things) being [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] (i.e., not maintaining a constant high body temperature), whereas birds are [[Homeothermy|warm-blooded]]. Since cold-bloodedness is a plesiomorphy, inherited from the common ancestor of traditional reptiles and birds, and thus a symplesiomorphy of turtles, snakes and crocodiles (among others), it does not mean that turtles, snakes and crocodiles form a clade that excludes the birds.\n* {{anchor|apomorphy}}{{anchor|synapomorphy}} An '''[[apomorphy]]''' (\"separate form\") or '''derived state''' is an innovation. It can thus be used to diagnose a clade \u2013 or even to help define a clade name in [[phylogenetic nomenclature]]. Features that are derived in individual taxa (a single species or a group that is represented by a single terminal in a given phylogenetic analysis) are called '''autapomorphies''' (from ''auto-'', \"self\"). Autapomorphies express nothing about relationships among groups; clades are identified (or defined) by '''synapomorphies''' (from ''syn-'', \"together\"). For example, the possession of [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]] that are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] with those of ''Homo sapiens'' is a synapomorphy within the vertebrates. The [[tetrapod]]s can be singled out as consisting of the first vertebrate with such digits homologous to those of ''Homo sapiens'' together with all descendants of this vertebrate (an apomorphy-based [[Phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic definition]]).<ref name=\"LaurinAnderson2004\">{{Harvnb|Laurin|Anderson|2004}}</ref> Importantly, snakes and other tetrapods that do not have digits are nonetheless tetrapods: other characters, such as amniotic eggs and diapsid skulls, indicate that they descended from ancestors that possessed digits which are homologous with ours.\n* A character state is '''homoplastic''' or \"an instance of '''[[homoplasy]]'''\" if it is shared by two or more organisms but is absent from their common ancestor or from a later ancestor in the lineage leading to one of the organisms. It is therefore inferred to have evolved by convergence or reversal. Both mammals and birds are able to maintain a high constant body temperature (i.e., they are warm-blooded). However, the accepted cladogram explaining their significant features indicates that their common ancestor is in a group lacking this character state, so the state must have evolved independently in the two clades. Warm-bloodedness is separately a synapomorphy of mammals (or a larger clade) and of birds (or a larger clade), but it is not a synapomorphy of any group including both these clades. Hennig's Auxiliary Principle <ref name=\"Hennig 1966\">{{Harvnb|Hennig|1966}}</ref> states that shared character states should be considered evidence of grouping unless they are contradicted by the weight of other evidence; thus, homoplasy of some feature among members of a group may only be inferred after a phylogenetic hypothesis for that group has been established.\n\nThe terms plesiomorphy and apomorphy are relative; their application depends on the position of a group within a tree. For example, when trying to decide whether the tetrapods form a clade, an important question is whether having four limbs is a synapomorphy of the earliest taxa to be included within Tetrapoda: did all the earliest members of the Tetrapoda inherit four limbs from a common ancestor, whereas all other vertebrates did not, or at least not homologously? By contrast, for a group within the tetrapods, such as birds, having four limbs is a plesiomorphy. Using these two terms allows a greater precision in the discussion of homology, in particular allowing clear expression of the hierarchical relationships among different homologous features.\n\nIt can be difficult to decide whether a character state is in fact the same and thus can be classified as a synapomorphy, which may identify a monophyletic group, or whether it only appears to be the same and is thus a homoplasy, which cannot identify such a group. There is a danger of circular reasoning: assumptions about the shape of a phylogenetic tree are used to justify decisions about character states, which are then used as evidence for the shape of the tree.<ref>{{Harvnb|James|Pourtless IV|2009|p=25}}: \"Synapomorphies are invoked to defend the hypothesis; the hypothesis is invoked to defend the synapomorphies.\"</ref> [[Phylogenetics]] uses various forms of [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimony]] to decide such questions; the conclusions reached often depend on the dataset and the methods. Such is the nature of empirical science, and for this reason, most cladists refer to their cladograms as hypotheses of relationship. Cladograms that are supported by a large number and variety of different kinds of characters are viewed as more robust than those based on more limited evidence.\n\n== Terminology for taxa ==\nMono-, para- and polyphyletic taxa can be understood based on the shape of the tree (as done above), as well as based on their character states.<ref name=\"Patterson 1988\" /><ref name=\"de Pinna 1991\" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Patterson|1982}}</ref> These are compared in the table below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!

However, when diagrams are presented representing paraphyletic groups, these invariably show the missing groups as monophyletic. See e.g.{{Harvnb|Wiley|Siegel-Causey|Brooks|Funk|1991|p=4}}</ref> (Removing one clade produces a singly paraphyletic assemblage, removing two produces a doubly paraphylectic assemblage, and so on.)<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|2003}}</ref>\n| A paraphyletic assemblage is characterized by one or more '''plesiomorphies''': character states inherited from ancestors but not present in all of their descendants. As a consequence, a paraphyletic assemblage is truncated, in that it excludes one or more clades from an otherwise monophyletic taxon. An alternative name is ''[[evolutionary grade]]'', referring to an ancestral character state within the group. While paraphyletic assemblages are popular among paleontologists and evolutionary taxonomists, cladists do not recognize paraphyletic assemblages as having any formal information content \u2013 they are merely parts of clades.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[Polyphyly]]\n| A polyphyletic assemblage is one which is neither monophyletic nor paraphyletic.\n| A polyphyletic assemblage is characterized by one or more '''[[Homoplasy|homoplasies]]''': character states which have converged or reverted so as to be the same but which have not been inherited from a common ancestor. No systematist recognizes polyphyletic assemblages as taxonomically meaningful entities, although ecologists sometimes consider them meaningful labels for functional participants in ecological communities (e. g., primary producers, detritivores, etc.).\n|}\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nCladistics, either generally or in specific applications, has been criticized from its beginnings. Decisions as to whether particular character states are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]], a precondition of their being synapomorphies, have been challenged as involving [[circular reasoning]] and subjective judgements.<ref name=\"AdraEdgeLieb02\">{{Harvnb|Adrain|Edgecombe|Lieberman|2002|pp=56\u201357}}</ref> [[Transformed cladistics]] arose in the late 1970s in an attempt to resolve some of these problems by removing phylogeny from cladistic analysis, but it has remained unpopular.\n\nHowever, homology is usually determined from analysis of the results that are evaluated with homology measures, mainly the consistency index (CI) and retention index (RI), which, it has been claimed,{{by whom|date=October 2013}} makes the process objective. Also, homology can be equated to synapomorphy, which is what Patterson has done.<ref>Forey, Peter et al. 1992. Cladistics,1st ed., p. 9, Oxford U.

This is done by giving names to periods of [[time]], typically [[day]]s, [[week]]s, [[month]]s and [[year]]s. A [[calendar date|date]] is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system. A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a [[court calendar]] or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills.\n\nPeriods in a calendar (such as years and months) are usually, though not necessarily, synchronised with the cycle of the [[solar calendar|sun]] or the [[lunar calendar|moon]]. The most common type of pre-modern calendar was the [[lunisolar calendar]], a lunar calendar that occasionally adds one [[intercalary month]] to remain synchronised with the [[solar year]] over the long term.\n\nThe term ''calendar'' is taken from ''[[calends|calendae]]'', the term for the first day of the month in the Roman calendar, related to the verb ''calare'' \"to call out\", referring to the \"calling\" of the new moon when it was first seen.<ref>''New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''</ref>\nLatin ''calendarium'' meant \"account book, register\" (as accounts were settled and debts were collected on the calends of each month). The Latin term was adopted in [[Old French]] as ''calendier'' and from there in [[Middle English]] as ''calender'' by the 13th century (the spelling ''calendar'' is early modern).\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of calendars}}\n{{Further|Week|Calendar epoch|Month|Lunisolar calendar|Computus}}\n[[File:Equinozio da Pizzo Vento,tramonto fondachelli fantina, sicilia.JPG|thumb|[[Equinox]] seen from the astronomic calendar of Pizzo Vento at [[Fondachelli-Fantina|Fondachelli Fantina]], [[Sicily]]]]\n\nThe course of the sun and the moon are the most salient natural, regularly recurring events useful for [[timekeeping]], thus in pre-modern societies worldwide [[lunation]] and the [[year]] were most commonly used as time units. Nevertheless, the Roman calendar contained remnants of a very ancient pre-Etruscan 10-month solar year.<ref>\"Religion in the Etruscan period\" in [http://global.britannica.com/topic/Roman-religion Roman religion] in Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref> The first recorded physical calendars, dependent on the development of [[Bronze Age writing|writing]] in the [[Ancient Near East]], are the [[Bronze Age]] [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian]] and [[Sumerian calendar|Sumerian]] calendars.<ref>citation needed</ref>\n\nA large number of Ancient Near East calendar systems based on the [[Babylonian calendar]] date from the [[Iron Age]], among them the calendar system of the Persian Empire, which in turn gave rise to the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] and the [[Hebrew calendar]].<ref>citation needed</ref>\n\nA great number of [[Hellenic calendars]] developed in [[Classical Greece]], and in the [[Hellenistic period]] gave rise to both the  ancient [[Roman calendar]] and to various [[Hindu calendars]].<ref>citation needed</ref>\n\nCalendars in antiquity were [[lunisolar]], depending on the introduction of [[intercalary month]]s to align the solar and the lunar years. This was mostly based on observation, but there may have been early attempts to model the pattern of intercalation algorithmically, as evidenced in the fragmentary 2nd-century [[Coligny calendar]].\n\nThe [[Roman calendar]] was reformed by [[Julius Caesar]] in 45 BC. The Julian calendar was no longer dependent on the observation of the new moon but simply followed an algorithm of introducing a leap day every four years. This created a dissociation of the calendar [[month]] from the [[lunation]].\n\nThe [[Islamic calendar]] is based on the prohibition of intercalation (''[[nasi']]'') by [[Muhammad]], in Islamic tradition dated to a sermon held on  9 [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] AH 10 (Julian date: 6 March 632). This resulted in an observation-based lunar calendar that shifts relative to the seasons of the solar year.\n\n=== Modern reforms ===\n{{Main|Calendar reform}}\n\nThe first calendar reform of the early modern era was the [[Gregorian calendar]], introduced in 1582 based on the observation of a long-term shift between the Julian calendar and the solar year.\n\nThere have been a number of modern proposals for reform of the calendar, such as the [[World Calendar]], [[International Fixed Calendar]], [[Holocene calendar]], and, recently, the [[Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar]]. Such ideas are mooted from time to time but have failed to gain traction because of the loss of continuity, massive upheaval in implementation, and religious objections.\n\n== Calendar systems ==\nA full calendar system has a different calendar date for every day. Thus the week cycle is by itself not a full calendar system; neither is a system to name the days within a year without a system for identifying the years.\n\nThe simplest calendar system just counts time periods from a reference date. This applies for the [[Julian day]] or [[Unix Time]]. Virtually the only possible variation is using a different reference date, in particular, one less distant in the past to make the numbers smaller. Computations in these systems are just a matter of addition and subtraction.\n\nOther calendars have one (or multiple) larger units of time.\n\nCalendars that contain one level of cycles:\n* week and weekday&nbsp;\u2013 this system (without year, the week number keeps on increasing) is not very common\n* year and ordinal date within the year, e.g., the [[ISO 8601#Ordinal dates|ISO 8601 ordinal date system]]\n\nCalendars with two levels of cycles:\n* year, month, and day&nbsp;\u2013 most systems, including the [[Gregorian calendar]] (and its very similar predecessor, the [[Julian calendar]]), the [[Islamic calendar]], the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] and the [[Hebrew calendar]]\n*year, week, and weekday&nbsp;\u2013 e.g., the [[ISO week date]]\n\nCycles can be synchronized with periodic phenomena:\n[[File:Sun and Moon Nuremberg chronicle.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|[[Sun]] and [[Moon]], Schedel's Nuremberg Chronicle, 1493]]\n* [[Lunar calendar]]s are synchronized to the motion of the Moon ([[lunar phase]]s); an example is the Islamic calendar.\n* [[Solar calendar]]s are based on perceived [[seasonal year|seasonal]] changes synchronized to the apparent motion of the Sun; an example is the [[Persian calendar]].\n* [[Lunisolar calendar]]s are based on a combination of both solar and lunar reckonings; examples include the [[Chinese calendar|traditional calendar of China]], the [[Hindu calendar]] in India, and the Hebrew calendar.\n* The week cycle is an example of one that is not synchronized to any external phenomenon (although it may have been derived from lunar phases, beginning anew every month).\n\nVery commonly a calendar includes more than one type of cycle, or has both cyclic and non-cyclic elements.\n\nMost calendars incorporate more complex cycles.   For example, the vast majority of them track years, months, weeks and days.   The  seven-day week is practically universal, though its use varies. It has run uninterrupted for millennia.{{sfn|Zerubavel | 1985}}\n\n===Solar calendars===\n{{main|Solar calendar}}\n\nSolar calendars assign a ''date'' to each [[solar time|solar day]]. A day may consist of the period between [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]], with a following period of [[night]], or it may be a period between successive events such as two sunsets. The length of the interval between two such successive events may be allowed to vary slightly during the year, or it may be averaged into a [[solar time|mean solar day]]. Other types of calendar may also use a solar day.\n\n===Lunar calendars===\n{{Main|Lunar calendar}}\nNot all calendars use the solar year as a unit. A lunar calendar is one in which days are numbered within each [[lunar phase]] cycle.  Because the length of the [[lunar month]] is not an even fraction of the length of the [[tropical year]], a purely lunar calendar quickly drifts against the seasons, which do not vary much near the equator.  It does, however, stay constant with respect to other phenomena, notably [[tide]]s. An example is the [[Islamic calendar]].\nAlexander Marshack, in a controversial reading,<ref>James Elkins, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5Ku6YdWurMgC&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63 Our beautiful, dry, and distant texts]'' (1998) 63ff.</ref> believed that marks on a bone baton (c. 25,000 BC) represented a lunar calendar. Other marked bones may also represent lunar calendars. Similarly, Michael Rappenglueck believes that marks on a 15,000-year-old cave painting represent a lunar calendar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/975360.stm |title=Oldest lunar calendar identified |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-10-16 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref>\n\n===Lunisolar calendars===\nA [[lunisolar calendar]] is a lunar calendar that compensates by adding an extra month as needed to realign the months with the seasons. An example is the Hebrew calendar which uses a [[metonic cycle|19-year cycle]].\n\n==Calendar subdivisions==\n{{see also|Decade|Century|Millennium}}\n\nNearly all calendar systems group consecutive days into \"months\" and also into \"years\". In a ''solar calendar'' a ''year'' approximates Earth's tropical year (that is, the time it takes for a complete cycle of [[season]]s), traditionally used to facilitate the planning of [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities. In a ''lunar calendar'', the ''month'' approximates the cycle of the moon phase. Consecutive days may be grouped into other periods such as the week.\n\nBecause the number of days in the ''tropical year'' is not a whole number, a solar calendar must have a different number of days in different years. This may be handled, for example, by adding an extra day in [[leap year]]s. The same applies to months in a lunar calendar and also the number of months in a year in a lunisolar calendar. This is generally known as [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]]. Even if a calendar is solar, but not lunar, the year cannot be divided entirely into months that never vary in length.\n\nCultures may define other units of time, such as the week, for the purpose of scheduling regular activities that do not easily coincide with months or years. Many cultures use different baselines for their calendars' starting years. For example, the year in [[Japan]] is based on the reign of the current emperor: 2006 was Year 18 of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Akihito]].\n\n==Other calendar types==\n\n===Arithmetic and astronomical calendars===\n[[File:JudischerKalender-1831 ubt.jpeg|thumb|Calendar of the [[Qahal]], 5591 (1831)]]\n\nAn ''astronomical calendar'' is based on ongoing observation; examples are the religious Islamic calendar and the old religious Jewish calendar in the time of the [[Second Temple]]. Such a calendar is also referred to as an ''observation-based'' calendar. The advantage of such a calendar is that it is perfectly and perpetually accurate. The disadvantage is that working out when a particular date would occur is difficult.\n\nAn ''arithmetic calendar'' is one that is based on a strict set of rules; an example is the current Jewish calendar. Such a calendar is also referred to as a ''rule-based'' calendar. The advantage of such a calendar is the ease of calculating when a particular date occurs. The disadvantage is imperfect accuracy. Furthermore, even if the calendar is very accurate, its accuracy diminishes slowly over time, owing to changes in Earth's rotation. This limits the lifetime of an accurate arithmetic calendar to a few thousand years. After then, the rules would need to be modified from observations made since the invention of the calendar.\n\n===Complete and incomplete calendars===\n{{Disputed section|date=June 2017}}\nCalendars may be either complete or incomplete. Complete calendars provide a way of naming each consecutive day, while incomplete calendars do not. The early [[Roman calendar]], which had no way of designating the days of the winter months other than to lump them together as \"winter\", is an example of an incomplete calendar, while the Gregorian calendar is an example of a complete calendar.\n\n==Calendars in use==\n\nThe primary practical use of a calendar is to identify days: to be informed about or to agree on a future event and to record an event that has happened. Days may be significant for agricultural, civil, religious or social reasons. For example, a calendar provides a way to determine when to start planting or harvesting, which days are [[religious holiday|religious]] or [[civil holiday]]s, which days mark the beginning and end of business accounting periods, and which days have legal significance, such as the day taxes are due or a contract expires. Also a calendar may, by identifying a day, provide other useful information about the day such as its season.\n\nCalendars are also used to help people manage their personal schedules, time and activities, particularly when individuals have numerous work, school, and family commitments. People frequently use multiple systems, and may keep both a [[business]] and [[family]] calendar to help prevent them from overcommitting their time.\n\nCalendars are also used as part of a complete [[timekeeping]] system: date and time of day together specify a moment in [[time]].  In the modern world, timekeepers can show time, date and weekday. Some may also show lunar phase.\n\n===Gregorian calendar===\nThe [[Gregorian calendar]] is the ''[[de facto]]'' international standard, and is used almost everywhere in the world for civil purposes. It is a purely solar calendar, with a cycle of leap days in a 400-year cycle designed to keep the duration of the year aligned with the [[solar year]].\n\nEach Gregorian year has either 365 or 366 days (the leap day being inserted as 29 February), amounting to an average Gregorian year of  365.2425 days (compared to a solar year of 365.2422 days). It was introduced in 1582 as a refinement to the [[Julian calendar]] which had been in use throughout the European Middle Ages, amounting to a 0.002% correction in the length of the year.\n\nDuring the Early Modern period, however, [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar|its adoption was mostly limited]] to [[Roman Catholic]] nations, but by the 19th century, it became widely adopted worldwide for the sake of convenience in international trade. The last European country to adopt the reform was Greece, in 1923.\n\nThe [[calendar epoch]] used by the Gregorian calendar is inherited from the medieval convention established by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] and associated with the Julian calendar. The year number is variously given as AD (for ''[[Anno Domini]]'') or CE (for ''[[Common Era]]'' or, indeed, ''Christian Era'').\n\n===Religious calendars===\n\n[[File:Hindu calendar 1871-72.jpg|thumb|A Hindu [[almanac]] (''pancanga'') for the year 1871/2 from [[Rajasthan]] (Library of Congress, Asian Division)]]\nThe most important use of pre-modern calendars is keeping track of the [[liturgical year]] and the observation of religious feast days.\n\nWhile the Gregorian calendar is itself historically motivated in relation to the calculation of the [[Easter date]], it is now in worldwide secular use as the ''de facto'' standard. Alongside the use of the Gregorian calendar for secular matters, there remain a number of calendars in use for religious purposes.\n\n[[Eastern Christians]], including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], use the [[Julian calendar]].\n\nThe [[Islamic calendar]]  or Hijri calendar, is a [[lunar calendar]] consisting of 12 lunar months in a year of 354 or 355 days. It is used to date events in most of the Muslim countries (concurrently with the Gregorian calendar), and used by Muslims everywhere to determine the proper day on which to celebrate Islamic holy days and festivals. Its epoch is the [[Anno Hegirae|Hijra]] (corresponding to AD 622)\nWith an annual drift of 11 or 12 days, the seasonal relation is repeated approximately each 33 Islamic years.\n\nVarious [[Hindu calendar]]s remain in use in the Indian subcontinent, including the [[Nepali calendar]], [[Bengali calendar]], [[Malayalam calendar]], [[Tamil calendar]], [[Vikrama Samvat]] used in Northern India, and [[Shalivahana era|Shalivahana]] calendar in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] states.\n\nThe [[Buddhist calendar]] and the traditional lunisolar calendars of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Thailand]] are also based on an older version of the Hindu calendar.\n\nMost of the Hindu calendars are inherited from a system first enunciated in [[Vedanga Jyotisha]] of Lagadha,  standardized in the ''[[Surya Siddhanta|S\u016brya Siddh\u0101nta]]'' and subsequently reformed by astronomers such as [[Aryabhata|\u0100ryabha\u1e6da]] (AD 499), [[Varahamihira|Var\u0101hamihira]] (6th century) and [[Bh\u0101skara II]] (12th century).\n\nThe [[Hebrew calendar]] is used by [[Jews]] worldwide for religious and cultural affairs, also influences civil matters in Israel (such as [[public holiday|national holiday]]s) and can be used there for business dealings (such as for the dating of [[cheque]]s).\n\n[[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] worldwide use the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed calendar]].\n\n===National calendars===\nThe [[Chinese calendar|Chinese]], [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew]], [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]], and [[Julian calendar|Julian]] calendars are widely used for religious and social purposes.\n\nThe [[Iranian calendar|Iranian (Persian) calendar]] is used in [[Iran]] and some parts of [[Afghanistan]]. The [[Ethiopian calendar]] or Ethiopic calendar is the principal calendar used in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]], with the [[Oromo calendar]] also in use in some areas. In neighboring [[Somalia]], the [[Somali calendar]] co-exists alongside the Gregorian and Islamic calendars. In [[Thailand]], where the [[Thai solar calendar]] is used, the months and days have adopted the western standard, although the years are still based on the traditional [[Buddhist calendar]].\n\n===Fiscal calendars===\n{{Main|Fiscal calendar}}\n[[File:Pieter Brueghel the Younger (or workshop) The Payment of the Tithes Bonhams.jpg|thumb|''The Payment of the Tithes'' (The tax-collector), also known as ''Village Lawyer'', by [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]] or workshop]]\n\nA fiscal calendar generally means the accounting year of a government or a business. It is used for budgeting, keeping accounts and taxation. It is a set of 12 months that may start at any date in a year. The US government's fiscal year starts on 1 October and ends on 30 September. The government of India's fiscal year starts on 1 April and ends on 31 March. Small traditional businesses in India start the fiscal year on [[Diwali]] festival and end the day before the next year's Diwali festival.\n\nIn accounting (and particularly accounting software), a fiscal calendar (such as a [[4-4-5 Calendar|4/4/5 calendar]]) fixes each month at a specific number of weeks to facilitate comparisons from month to month and year to year. January always has exactly 4 weeks (Sunday through Saturday), February has 4 weeks, March has 5 weeks, etc. Note that this calendar will normally need to add a 53rd week to every 5th or 6th year, which might be added to December or might not be, depending on how the organization uses those dates. There exists an international standard way to do this (the [[ISO 8601|ISO week]]). The ISO week starts on a Monday, and ends on a Sunday. Week 1 is always the week that contains 4 January in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n==Formats==\n[[File:Petaluma and Santa Rosa Railroad Co. Calendar.jpg|thumb|A calendar from the Petaluma and Santa Rosa Railroad]]\n\nThe term ''calendar'' applies not only to a given scheme of timekeeping but also to a specific record or device displaying such a scheme, for example an [[appointment book]] in the form of a pocket calendar (or [[personal organizer]]), desktop calendar, a [[wall calendar]], etc.\n\nIn a paper calendar one or two sheets can show a single day, a week, a month, or a year. If a sheet is for a single day, it easily shows the date and the weekday. If a sheet is for multiple days it shows a conversion table to convert from weekday to date and back. With a special pointing device, or by crossing out past days, it may indicate the current date and weekday. This is the most common usage of the word.\n\nIn the USA Sunday is considered the first day of the week and so appears on the far left and Saturday the last day of the week appearing on the far right. In Britain the weekend may appear at the end of the week so the first day is Monday and the last day is Sunday. The US calendar display is also used in Britain.\n\nIt is common to display the Gregorian calendar in separate monthly grids of seven columns (from Monday to Sunday, or Sunday to Saturday depending on which day is considered to start the week&nbsp;\u2013 this varies according to country) and five to six rows (or rarely, four rows when the month of February contains 28 days beginning on the first day of the week), with the day of the month numbered in each cell, beginning with 1.   The sixth row is sometimes eliminated by marking 23/30 and 24/31 together as necessary.\n\nWhen working with weeks rather than months, a continuous format is sometimes more convenient, where no blank cells are inserted to ensure that the first day of a new month begins on a fresh row.\n\n===Calendaring software===\n{{Main|Calendaring software}}\n{{Further|:Category:Calendaring standards}}\n\nCalendaring software provides users with an electronic version of a calendar, and may additionally provide an appointment book, address book or contact list.\nCalendaring is a standard feature of many [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, [[Enterprise digital assistant|EDA]]s, and [[smartphones]].

One way is to compare the physical size of an object to its [[angular size]], but a physical size must be assumed to do this. Another method is to measure the [[brightness]] of an object and assume an intrinsic [[luminosity]], from which the distance may be determined using the [[inverse square law]]. Due to the difficulty of using these methods, they did not realize that the nebulae were actually galaxies outside our own [[Milky Way]], nor did they speculate about the cosmological implications. In 1927, the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]] independently derived the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker equations and proposed, on the basis of the recession of spiral nebulae, that the universe began with the \"explosion\" of a \"primeval [[atom]]\"<ref>{{citation | last1=Lema\u00eetre | first1=G. | title=Un Univers homog\u00e8ne de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des n\u00e9buleuses extra-galactiques | journal=Annales de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Scientifique de Bruxelles | volume=A47 | pages=49\u201359 | date=1927 | language=French | bibcode=1927ASSB...47...49L }}</ref>\u2014which was later called the [[Big Bang]].

Hubble showed that the spiral nebulae were galaxies by determining their distances using measurements of the brightness of [[Cepheid variable]] stars.

Two primary explanations were proposed for the expansion. One was Lema\u00eetre's Big Bang theory, advocated and developed by George Gamow.

Therefore, it remains controversial whether the total energy is conserved in an expanding universe. For instance, each [[photon]] that travels through intergalactic space loses energy due to the [[redshift]] effect. This energy is not obviously transferred to any other system, so seems to be permanently lost. On the other hand, some cosmologists insist that energy is conserved in some sense; this follows the law of [[conservation of energy]].<ref>e.g. {{cite book | author = Liddle, A. | title = An Introduction to Modern Cosmology | publisher = Wiley | isbn =978-0-470-84835-7 | date = 2003-05-26 }} This argues cogently \"Energy is always, always, always conserved.\"</ref>\n\n[[Thermodynamics of the universe]] is a field of study that explores which form of energy dominates the cosmos \u2013 [[relativistic particle]]s which are referred to as [[radiation]], or non-relativistic particles referred to as matter. Relativistic particles are particles whose [[rest mass]] is zero or negligible compared to their [[kinetic energy]], and so move at the speed of light or very close to it; non-relativistic particles have much higher rest mass than their energy and so move much slower than the speed of light.\n\nAs the universe expands, both matter and radiation in it become diluted. However, the [[energy density|energy densities]] of radiation and matter dilute at different rates. As a particular volume expands, mass energy density is changed only by the increase in volume, but the energy density of radiation is changed both by the increase in volume and by the increase in the [[wavelength]] of the [[photon]]s that make it up. Thus the energy of radiation becomes a smaller part of the universe's total energy than that of matter as it expands. The very early universe is said to have been 'radiation dominated' and radiation controlled the deceleration of expansion. Later, as the average energy per photon becomes roughly 10 [[electronvolt|eV]] and lower, matter dictates the rate of deceleration and the universe is said to be 'matter dominated'. The intermediate case is not treated well [[analytic solution|analytically]]. As the expansion of the universe continues, matter dilutes even further and the [[cosmological constant]] becomes dominant, leading to an acceleration in the universe's expansion.\n\n==History of the universe==\n{{see also|Timeline of the Big Bang}}\nThe history of the universe is a central issue in cosmology.

The very early universe, which is still poorly understood, was the split second in which the universe was so hot that [[subatomic particle|particles]] had energies higher than those currently accessible in [[particle accelerator]]s on Earth. Therefore, while the basic features of this epoch have been worked out in the Big Bang theory, the details are largely based on educated guesses.\nFollowing this, in the early universe, the evolution of the universe proceeded according to known [[high energy physics]]. This is when the first protons, electrons and neutrons formed, then nuclei and finally atoms. With the formation of neutral hydrogen, the [[cosmic microwave background]] was emitted. Finally, the epoch of structure formation began, when matter started to aggregate into the first [[star]]s and [[quasar]]s, and ultimately galaxies, [[clusters of galaxies]] and [[supercluster]]s formed. The future of the universe is not yet firmly known, but according to the [[&Lambda;CDM]] model it will continue expanding forever.\n\n==Areas of study==\nBelow, some of the most active areas of inquiry in cosmology are described, in roughly chronological order. This does not include all of the Big Bang cosmology, which is presented in ''[[Timeline of the Big Bang]].''\n\n===Very early universe===\nThe early, hot universe appears to be well explained by the Big Bang from roughly 10<sup>\u221233</sup> seconds onwards, but there are several [[Big Bang#Standard Problems|problems]]. One is that there is no compelling reason, using current particle physics, for the universe to be [[shape of the universe|flat]], homogeneous, and [[isotropic]] ''(see the [[cosmological principle]])''. Moreover, [[grand unified theory|grand unified theories]] of particle physics suggest that there should be [[magnetic monopole]]s in the universe, which have not been found. These problems are resolved by a brief period of [[cosmic inflation]], which drives the universe to [[Flatness (cosmology)|flatness]], smooths out anisotropies and inhomogeneities to the observed level, and exponentially dilutes the monopoles.<ref name=Guth1981>{{cite journal | title=Inflationary universe: A possible solution to the horizon and flatness problems | last1=Guth | first1=Alan H. | journal=Physical Review D | volume=23 | issue=2 | date=January 15, 1981 | pages=347\u2013356 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.23.347 | bibcode=1981PhRvD..23..347G }}</ref> The physical model behind cosmic inflation is extremely simple, but it has not yet been confirmed by particle physics, and there are difficult problems reconciling inflation and [[quantum field theory]].{{Vague|date=April 2018}} Some cosmologists think that [[string theory]] and [[brane cosmology]] will provide an alternative to inflation.<ref name=Pogosian2003>{{cite journal | title=Observational constraints on cosmic string production during brane inflation | last1=Pogosian | first1=Levon | last2=Tye | first2=S.-H.

Cosmologists can observationally deduce that the universe is not split into regions of matter and antimatter. If it were, there would be [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s produced as a result of [[annihilation]], but this is not observed. Therefore, some process in the early universe must have created a small excess of matter over antimatter, and this (currently not understood) process is called ''[[baryogenesis]]''. Three required conditions for baryogenesis were derived by [[Andrei Sakharov]] in 1967, and requires a violation of the particle physics [[Symmetry#In physics|symmetry]], called [[CP-symmetry]], between matter and antimatter.<ref name=Canetti2012>{{citation | title=Matter and antimatter in the universe | display-authors=1 | first1=Laurent | last1=Canetti | first2=Marco | last2=Drewes | first3=Mikhail | last3=Shaposhnikov | journal=New Journal of Physics | volume=14 | issue=9 | pages=095012 | date=September 2012 | doi=10.1088/1367-2630/14/9/095012 | bibcode=2012NJPh...14i5012C | arxiv=1204.4186 }}</ref> However, particle accelerators measure too small a violation of CP-symmetry to account for the baryon asymmetry.

It finished when the universe was about three minutes old and its [[temperature]] dropped below that at which [[nuclear fusion]] could occur. Big Bang nucleosynthesis had a brief period during which it could operate, so only the very lightest elements were produced. Starting from [[hydrogen]] [[ion]]s ([[proton]]s), it principally produced [[deuterium]], [[helium|helium-4]], and [[lithium]]. Other elements were produced in only trace abundances. The basic theory of nucleosynthesis was developed in 1948 by [[George Gamow]], [[Ralph Asher Alpher]], and [[Robert Herman]].<ref name=Peebles2014>{{cite journal | title=Discovery of the hot Big Bang: What happened in 1948 | last1=Peebles | first1=Phillip James Edwin | journal=The European Physical Journal H | volume=39 | issue=2 | pages=205\u2013223 | date=April 2014 | doi=10.1140/epjh/e2014-50002-y | bibcode=2014EPJH...39..205P | arxiv=1310.2146 }}</ref> It was used for many years as a probe of physics at the time of the Big Bang, as the theory of Big Bang nucleosynthesis connects the abundances of primordial light elements with the features of the early universe.<ref name=Burles2001>{{cite journal | title=Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Predictions for Precision Cosmology | last1=Burles | first1=Scott | last2=Nollett | first2=Kenneth M. | last3=Turner | first3=Michael S. | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=552 | issue=1 | pages=L1\u2013L5 | date=May 2001 | doi=10.1086/320251 | bibcode=2001ApJ...552L...1B | arxiv=astro-ph/0010171 }}</ref> Specifically, it can be used to test the [[equivalence principle]],<ref name=Boucher2004>{{citation | title=Cosmic microwave background constraints on the strong equivalence principle | last1=Boucher | first1=V. | last2=G\u00e9rard | first2=J.-M. | last3=Vandergheynst | first3=P. | last4=Wiaux | first4=Y. | journal=Physical Review D | volume=70 | issue=10 | page=103528 | date=November 2004 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.70.103528 | bibcode=2004PhRvD..70j3528B | arxiv=astro-ph/0407208 }}</ref> to probe [[dark matter]], and test [[neutrino]] physics.<ref name=Cyburt2016>{{citation | title=Big bang nucleosynthesis: Present status | last1=Cyburt | first1=Richard H. | last2=Fields | first2=Brian D. | last3=Olive | first3=Keith A. | last4=Yeh | first4=Tsung-Han | journal=Reviews of Modern Physics | volume=88 | issue=1 | page=015004 | date=January 2016 | doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.88.015004 | bibcode=2016RvMP...88a5004C | arxiv=1505.01076 }}</ref> Some cosmologists have proposed that Big Bang nucleosynthesis suggests there is a fourth \"sterile\" species of neutrino.<ref name=Lucente2018>{{cite arxiv| title=Leptogenesis, dark matter and neutrino masses | last1=Lucente | first1=Michele | last2=Abada | first2=Asmaa | last3=Arcadi | first3=Giorgio | last4=Domcke | first4=Valerie  | eprint=1803.10826 | date=March 2018| class=hep-ph }}</ref>\n\n====Standard model of Big Bang cosmology====\nThe '''\u039bCDM''' ('''Lambda cold dark matter''') or '''[[Lambda-CDM]]''' model is a [[parametrization]] of the [[Big Bang]] cosmological model in which the universe contains a [[cosmological constant]], denoted by [[Lambda]] ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]] '''\u039b'''), associated with [[dark energy]], and [[cold dark matter]] (abbreviated '''CDM''').

This was quickly interpreted as meaning galaxies were receding from earth. If earth is not in some special, privileged, central position in the universe, then it would mean all galaxies are moving apart, and the further away, the faster they are moving away. It is now understood that [[metric expansion of space|the universe is expanding]], carrying the galaxies with it, and causing this observation.  Many other observations agree, and also lead to the same conclusion. However, for many years it was not clear why or how the universe might be expanding, or what it might signify.\n\nBased on a huge amount of experimental observation and theoretical work, it is now believed that the reason for the observation is that ''space itself is expanding'', and that it expanded very rapidly within the first fraction of a second after the [[Big Bang]]. This kind of expansion is known as a ''\"metric\"'' expansion. In the terminology of mathematics and physics, a \"[[Metric (mathematics)|metric]]\" is a measure of distance that satisfies a specific list of properties, and the term implies that ''the sense of distance within the universe is itself changing'', although at this time it is far too small an effect to see on less than an intergalactic scale.\n\nThe modern explanation for the metric expansion of space was proposed by physicist [[Alan Guth]] in 1979, while investigating the problem of why no [[magnetic monopoles]] are seen today. He found that if the universe contained a [[field (physics)|field]] in a positive-energy [[false vacuum]] state, then according to [[general relativity]] it would generate an exponential expansion of space. It was very quickly realized that such an expansion would resolve many other long-standing problems. These problems arise from the observation that to look like it does ''today'', the Universe would have to have started from very [[fine tuned universe|finely tuned]], or \"special\" initial conditions at the Big Bang. Inflation theory largely resolves these problems as well, thus making a universe like ours much more likely in the context of Big Bang theory.\n\nNo [[field (physics)|physical field]] has yet been discovered that is responsible for this inflation. However such a field would be [[scalar field#definition|scalar]] and the first relativistic scalar field proven to exist was [[Higgs field|only discovered]] in 2012 - 2013 and is still being researched. So it is not seen as problematic that a field responsible for cosmic inflation and the metric expansion of space has not yet been discovered. The proposed field and its ''[[quantum|quanta]]'' (the [[subatomic particle]]s related to it) have been named the [[inflaton]]. If this field did not exist, scientists would have to propose a different explanation for all the observations that strongly suggest a metric expansion of space has occurred, and is still occurring (much more slowly) today.\n\n== Theory ==\n{{Main|Metric expansion of space}}\n\nAn expanding universe generally has a [[Cosmological horizon#Cosmological horizon|cosmological horizon]], which, by analogy with the more familiar [[horizon]] caused by the curvature of [[Earth]]'s surface, marks the boundary of the part of the Universe that an observer can see. Light (or other radiation) emitted by objects beyond the cosmological horizon in an [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|Accelerating universe]] never reaches the observer, because the space in between the observer and the object is expanding too rapidly.\n\n[[File:History of the Universe.svg |thumb |left |350px |History of the [[Universe]] - [[gravitational wave]]s are hypothesized to arise from cosmic inflation, a [[Faster-than-light#Universal expansion|faster-than-light]] expansion just after the [[Big Bang]] (17 March 2014).<ref name=\"BICEP2-2014\" /><ref name=\"NASA-20140317\" /><ref name=\"NYT-20140317\" />]]\n\nThe [[observable universe]] is one ''causal patch'' of a much larger unobservable universe; other parts of the Universe cannot communicate with Earth yet. These parts of the Universe are outside our current cosmological horizon. In the standard hot big bang model, without inflation, the cosmological horizon moves out, bringing new regions into view.{{citation needed |date=October 2014}} Yet as a local observer sees such a region for the first time, it looks no different from any other region of space the local observer has already seen: its background radiation is at nearly the same temperature as the background radiation of other regions, and its space-time curvature is evolving lock-step with the others. This presents a mystery: how did these new regions know what temperature and curvature they were supposed to have? They couldn't have learned it by getting signals, because they were not previously in communication with our past [[light cone]].<ref name=\"tiny\">[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102715275 Using Tiny Particles To Answer Giant Questions]. Science Friday, 3 April 2009.</ref><ref>See also [[Faster than light#Universal expansion]].</ref>\n\nInflation answers this question by postulating that all the regions come from an earlier era with a big vacuum energy, or [[cosmological constant]]. A space with a cosmological constant is qualitatively different: instead of moving outward, the cosmological horizon stays put. For any one observer, the distance to the [[Observable universe#Cosmological horizon|cosmological horizon]] is constant. With exponentially expanding space, two nearby observers are separated very quickly; so much so, that the distance between them quickly exceeds the limits of communications. The spatial slices are expanding very fast to cover huge volumes. Things are constantly moving beyond the cosmological horizon, which is a fixed distance away, and everything becomes homogeneous.\n\nAs the inflationary field slowly relaxes to the vacuum, the cosmological constant goes to zero and space begins to expand normally. The new regions that come into view during the normal expansion phase are exactly the same regions that were pushed out of the horizon during inflation, and so they are at nearly the same temperature and curvature, because they come from the same originally small patch of space.\n\nThe theory of inflation thus explains why the temperatures and curvatures of different regions are so nearly equal. It also predicts that the total curvature of a space-slice at constant global time is zero. This prediction implies that the total ordinary matter, [[dark matter]] and residual [[vacuum energy]] in the Universe have to add up to the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]], and the evidence supports this. More strikingly, inflation allows physicists to calculate the minute differences in temperature of different regions from quantum fluctuations during the inflationary era, and many of these quantitative predictions have been confirmed.<ref name=\"wmap2\">{{Cite journal |last=Spergel |first=D.N. |date=2006 |title=Three-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) observations: Implications for cosmology |url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/current/map_bibliography.cfm |quote=WMAP... confirms the basic tenets of the inflationary paradigm...}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/14699-universe-inflation-cosmic-expansion-theory.html |title=Our Baby Universe Likely Expanded Rapidly, Study Suggests |work=Space.com}}</ref>\n\n===Space expands===\nIn a space that expands exponentially (or nearly exponentially) with time, any pair of free-floating objects that are initially at rest will move apart from each other at an accelerating rate, at least as long as they are not bound together by any force.  From the point of view of one such object, the spacetime is something like an inside-out Schwarzschild black hole -- each object is surrounded by a spherical event horizon.  Once the other object has fallen through this horizon it can never return, and even light signals it sends will never reach the first object (at least so long as the space continues to expand exponentially).  \n\nIn the approximation that the expansion is exactly exponential, the horizon is static and remains a fixed physical distance away.  This patch of an inflating universe can be described by the following [[metric tensor|metric]]:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Melia |first1=Fulvio |year=2008 |title=The Cosmic Horizon |url= |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=382 |issue=4 |pages=1917\u20131921 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12499.x |bibcode=2007MNRAS.382.1917M |arxiv=0711.4181 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Melia |first1=Fulvio |date=2009 |title=The Cosmological Spacetime |url= |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |volume=18 |issue=12 |pages=1889\u20131901 |doi=10.1142/s0218271809015746 |displayauthors=etal |bibcode=2009IJMPD..18.1889M |arxiv=0907.5394 }}</ref>\n\n:<math>\nds^2=- (1- \\Lambda r^2) \\, dt^2 + {1\\over 1-\\Lambda r^2} \\, dr^2 + r^2 \\, d\\Omega^2.\n</math>\n\nThis exponentially expanding spacetime is called a [[de Sitter space]], and to sustain it there must be a [[cosmological constant]], a [[dark energy|vacuum energy]] density that is constant  in space and time and proportional to \u039b in the above metric. For the case of exactly exponential expansion, the vacuum energy has a negative pressure equal in magnitude to its energy density; the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] is {{nowrap begin}}''p=\u2212\u03c1''{{nowrap end}}.  \n\nInflation is typically not an exactly exponential expansion, but rather quasi- or near-exponential.  In such a universe the horizon will slowly grow with time as the vacuum energy density gradually decreases.\n\n===Few inhomogeneities remain===\nBecause the accelerating expansion of space stretches out any initial variations in density or temperature to very large length scales, an essential feature of inflation is that it smooths out [[homogeneity (physics)|inhomogeneities]], [[anisotropy|anisotropies]] and reduces the [[shape of the universe|curvature of space]]. This pushes the Universe into a very simple state in which it is completely dominated by the [[inflaton]] field and the only significant inhomogeneities are tiny [[quantum fluctuation]]s. Inflation also dilutes exotic heavy particles, such as the [[magnetic monopole]]s predicted by many extensions to the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]]. If the Universe was only hot enough to form such particles ''before'' a period of inflation, they would not be observed in nature, as they would be so rare that it is quite likely that there are none in the [[observable universe]]. Together, these effects are called the inflationary \"no-hair theorem\"<ref>Kolb and Turner (1988).</ref> by analogy with the [[no hair theorem]] for [[black hole]]s.\n\nThe \"no-hair\" theorem works essentially because the cosmological horizon is no different from a black-hole horizon, except for philosophical disagreements about what is on the other side. The interpretation of the no-hair theorem is that the Universe (observable and unobservable) expands by an enormous factor during inflation. In an expanding universe, [[energy density|energy densities]] generally fall, or get diluted, as the volume of the Universe increases. For example, the density of ordinary \"cold\" matter (dust) goes down as the inverse of the volume: when linear dimensions double, the energy density goes down by a factor of eight; the radiation energy density goes down even more rapidly as the Universe expands since the wavelength of each [[photon]] is stretched ([[redshift]]ed), in addition to the photons being dispersed by the expansion. When linear dimensions are doubled, the energy density in radiation falls by a factor of sixteen (see [[Equation of state (cosmology)#Ultra-relativistic matter|the solution of the energy density continuity equation for an ultra-relativistic fluid]]). During inflation, the energy density in the inflaton field is roughly constant. However, the energy density in everything else, including inhomogeneities, curvature, anisotropies, exotic particles, and standard-model particles is falling, and through sufficient inflation these all become negligible. This leaves the Universe flat and symmetric, and (apart from the homogeneous inflaton field) mostly empty, at the moment inflation ends and reheating begins.<ref name=\"Ryden2003\">{{cite book |author=Barbara Sue Ryden |title=Introduction to cosmology |date=2003 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=978-0-8053-8912-8 |quote=Not only is inflation very effective at driving down the number density of magnetic monopoles, it is also effective at driving down the number density of every other type of particle, including photons.}}{{rp |202\u2013207}}</ref>\n\n===Duration===\nA key requirement is that inflation must continue long enough to produce the present observable universe from a single, small inflationary [[Hubble volume]]. This is necessary to ensure that the Universe appears flat, homogeneous and isotropic at the largest observable scales. This requirement is generally thought to be satisfied if the Universe expanded by a factor of at least 10<sup>26</sup> during inflation.<ref>This is usually quoted as 60 ''e''-folds of expansion, where ''e''<sup>60</sup> \u2248 10<sup>26</sup>. It is equal to the amount of expansion since reheating, which is roughly ''E''<sub>inflation</sub>/''T''<sub>0</sub>, where ''T''<sub>0</sub>=2.7 [[Kelvin|K]] is the temperature of the cosmic microwave background today. See, ''e.g.'' Kolb and Turner (1998) or Liddle and Lyth (2000).</ref>\n\n===Reheating===\nInflation is a period of supercooled expansion, when the temperature drops by a factor of 100,000 or so. (The exact drop is model dependent, but in the first models it was typically from 10<sup>27</sup> K down to 10<sup>22</sup> K.<ref>Guth, ''Phase transitions in the very early universe'', in ''The Very Early Universe'', {{ISBN|0-521-31677-4}} eds Hawking, Gibbon & Siklos</ref>) This relatively low temperature is maintained during the inflationary phase. When inflation ends the temperature returns to the pre-inflationary temperature; this is called ''reheating'' or thermalization because the large potential energy of the inflaton field decays into particles and fills the Universe with [[Standard Model]] particles, including [[electromagnetic radiation]], starting the [[radiation-dominated era|radiation dominated phase]] of the Universe. Because the nature of the inflation is not known, this process is still poorly understood, although it is believed to take place through a [[parametric oscillator|parametric resonance]].<ref>See Kolb and Turner (1988) or Mukhanov (2005).</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Reheating after inflation |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/3/5/011 |first=Lev |last=Kofman |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=73 |issue=5 |date=1994 |pages=3195&ndash;3198 |arxiv=hep-th/9405187 |last2=Linde |first2=Andrei |last3=Starobinsky |first3=Alexei |bibcode=1986CQGra...3..811K }}</ref>\n\n==Motivations==\nInflation resolves [[Big Bang#Problems|several problems]] in [[Big Bang]] cosmology that were discovered in the 1970s.<ref>Much of the historical context is explained in chapters 15&ndash;17 of Peebles (1993).</ref> Inflation was first proposed by [[Alan Guth]] in 1979 while investigating the problem of why no [[magnetic monopoles]] are seen today; he found that a positive-energy [[false vacuum]] would, according to [[general relativity]], generate an exponential expansion of space.

Like a metastable phase in [[statistical mechanics]]&mdash;water below the freezing temperature or above the boiling point&mdash;a quantum field would need to nucleate a large enough bubble of the new vacuum, the new phase, in order to make a transition. Coleman found the most likely decay pathway for vacuum decay and calculated the inverse lifetime per unit volume. He eventually noted that gravitational effects would be significant, but he did not calculate these effects and did not apply the results to cosmology.\n\n====Starobinsky inflation====\n{{Main|Starobinsky inflation}}\nIn the Soviet Union, [[Alexei Starobinsky]] noted that quantum corrections to general relativity should be important for the early universe. These generically lead to curvature-squared corrections to the [[Einstein&ndash;Hilbert action]] and a form of [[f(R) gravity|''f''(''R'') modified gravity]]. The solution to Einstein's equations in the presence of curvature squared terms, when the curvatures are large, leads to an effective cosmological constant. Therefore, he proposed that the early universe went through an inflationary de Sitter era.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Starobinsky, A.

As the very early universe cooled it was trapped in a [[metastability|metastable]] state (it was supercooled), which it could only decay out of through the process of [[nucleation|bubble nucleation]] via [[quantum tunneling]]. Bubbles of [[vacuum state|true vacuum]] spontaneously form in the sea of false vacuum and rapidly begin expanding at the [[speed of light]].

Other models of inflation relied on the properties of Grand Unified Theories.<ref name=\"albrecht\" /> Since the simplest models of [[grand unification]] have failed, it is now thought by many physicists that inflation will be included in a [[supersymmetric]] theory such as [[string theory]] or a supersymmetric grand unified theory. At present, while inflation is understood principally by its detailed predictions of the [[boundary condition|initial conditions]] for the hot early universe, the particle physics is largely ''ad hoc'' modelling. As such, although predictions of inflation have been consistent with the results of observational tests, many open questions remain.\n\n===Fine-tuning problem===\nOne of the most severe challenges for inflation arises from the need for [[fine tuning]]. In new inflation, the ''slow-roll conditions'' must be satisfied for inflation to occur. The slow-roll conditions say that the inflaton [[scalar potential|potential]] must be flat (compared to the large [[vacuum energy]]) and that the inflaton particles must have a small mass.{{Clarify |reason=the inflaton particle has not been defined. From the note, it seems that the second condition should be that the inflaton potential should be large |date=June 2014}}<ref>Technically, these conditions are that the [[logarithmic derivative]] of the potential, <math>\\epsilon=(1/2)(V'/V)^2</math> and second derivative <math>\\eta=V''/V</math> are small, where <math>V</math> is the potential and the equations are written in [[reduced Planck units]]. See, ''e.g.'' Liddle and Lyth (2000), pg 42-43.</ref> New inflation requires the Universe to have a scalar field with an especially flat potential and special initial conditions. However, explanations for these fine-tunings have been proposed. For example, classically scale invariant field theories, where scale invariance is broken by quantum effects, provide an explanation of the flatness of inflationary potentials, as long as the theory can be studied through [[perturbation theory]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Salvio, Strumia |title=Agravity |journal= Journal of High Energy Physics|date=2014-03-17 |arxiv=1403.4226 |bibcode=2014JHEP...06..080S |doi=10.1007/JHEP06(2014)080 |volume=2014 |issue=6 |pages=80}}</ref>\n\n[[Andrei Linde|Linde]] proposed a theory known as ''[[Chaotic inflation theory|chaotic inflation]]'' in which he suggested that the conditions for inflation were actually satisfied quite generically.

In this situation, the predictions of [[effective field theory]] are thought to be invalid, as [[renormalization]] should cause large corrections that could prevent inflation.<ref>Technically, this is because the inflaton potential is expressed as a Taylor series in \u03c6/''m''<sub>Pl</sub>, where \u03c6 is the inflaton and ''m''<sub>Pl</sub> is the Planck mass. While for a single term, such as the mass term ''m''<sub>\u03c6</sub><sup>4</sup>(\u03c6/''m''<sub>Pl</sub>)<sup>2</sup>, the slow roll conditions can be satisfied for \u03c6 much greater than ''m''<sub>Pl</sub>, this is precisely the situation in effective field theory in which higher order terms would be expected to contribute and destroy the conditions for inflation. The absence of these higher order corrections can be seen as another sort of fine tuning.

The natural scale is na\u00efvely the Planck scale so this small value could be seen as another form of fine-tuning (called a [[hierarchy problem]]): the energy density given by the scalar potential is down by 10<sup>&minus;12</sup> compared to the [[Planck density]]. This is not usually considered to be a critical problem, however, because the scale of inflation corresponds naturally to the scale of gauge unification.\n\n===Eternal inflation===\n{{Main|Eternal inflation}}\n\nIn many models, the inflationary phase of the Universe's expansion lasts forever in at least some regions of the Universe. This occurs because inflating regions expand very rapidly, reproducing themselves. Unless the rate of decay to the non-inflating phase is sufficiently fast, new inflating regions are produced more rapidly than non-inflating regions. In such models, most of the volume of the Universe is continuously inflating at any given time.\n\nAll models of eternal inflation produce an infinite, hypothetical multiverse, typically a fractal. The multiverse theory has created significant dissension in the scientific community about the viability of the inflationary model.\n\n[[Paul Steinhardt]], one of the original architects of the inflationary model, introduced the first example of eternal inflation in 1983.<ref name=\"steinhardt\" >{{cite book |editor1-last=Gibbons |editor1-first= Gary W. |editor1-link= Gary Gibbons |editor2-first=Stephen W. |editor2-last=Hawking |editor3-last=Siklos |editor3-first= S.T.C. |title=\"Natural Inflation,\" in The Very Early Universe |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages= 251\u201366 |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-521-31677-4}}</ref> He showed that the inflation could proceed forever by producing bubbles of non-inflating space filled with hot matter and radiation surrounded by empty space that continues to inflate. The bubbles could not grow fast enough to keep up with the inflation. Later that same year, [[Alexander Vilenkin]] showed that eternal inflation is generic.<ref name=\"vilenkin\">{{cite journal |last1=Vilenkin |first1=Alexander |year=1983 |title=Birth of Inflationary Universes |journal=Physical Review D |volume=27 |issue=12 |pages=2848\u20132855 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.27.2848 |bibcode=1983PhRvD..27.2848V }}</ref>\n\nAlthough new inflation is classically rolling down the potential, quantum fluctuations can sometimes lift it to previous levels. These regions in which the inflaton fluctuates upwards expand much faster than regions in which the inflaton has a lower potential energy, and tend to dominate in terms of physical volume. It has been shown that any inflationary theory with an unbounded potential is eternal. There are well-known theorems that this steady state cannot continue forever into the past. Inflationary spacetime, which is similar to de Sitter space, is incomplete without a contracting region. However, unlike de Sitter space, fluctuations in a contracting inflationary space collapse to form a gravitational singularity, a point where densities become infinite. Therefore, it is necessary to have a theory for the Universe's initial conditions.\n\nIn eternal inflation, regions with inflation have an exponentially growing volume, while regions that are not inflating don't. This suggests that the volume of the inflating part of the Universe in the global picture is always unimaginably larger than the part that has stopped inflating, even though inflation eventually ends as seen by any single pre-inflationary observer. Scientists disagree about how to assign a probability distribution to this hypothetical anthropic landscape. If the probability of different regions is counted by volume, one should expect that inflation will never end or applying boundary conditions that a local observer exists to observe it, that inflation will end as late as possible.\n\nSome physicists believe this paradox can be resolved by weighting observers by their pre-inflationary volume.

The minimal coupling between torsion and [[Dirac spinor]]s generates a spin-spin interaction that is significant in fermionic matter at extremely high densities. Such an interaction averts the unphysical Big Bang singularity, replacing it with a cusp-like bounce at a finite minimum scale factor, before which the Universe was contracting. The rapid expansion immediately after the [[Big Bounce]] explains why the present Universe at largest scales appears spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic. As the density of the Universe decreases, the effects of torsion weaken and the Universe smoothly enters the radiation-dominated era.\n\n=== Ekpyrotic and cyclic models ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nThe [[ekpyrotic]] and [[cyclic model]]s are also considered adjuncts to inflation. These models solve the [[horizon problem]] through an expanding epoch well ''before'' the Big Bang, and then generate the required spectrum of primordial density perturbations during a contracting phase leading to a [[Big Crunch]]. The Universe passes through the Big Crunch and emerges in a hot [[Big Bang]] phase. In this sense they are reminiscent of [[Richard Chace Tolman]]'s [[oscillatory universe]]; in Tolman's model, however, the total age of the Universe is necessarily finite, while in these models this is not necessarily so. Whether the correct spectrum of density fluctuations can be produced, and whether the Universe can successfully navigate the Big Bang/Big Crunch transition, remains a topic of controversy and current research. Ekpyrotic models avoid the [[magnetic monopole]] problem as long as the temperature at the Big Crunch/Big Bang transition remains below the Grand Unified Scale, as this is the temperature required to produce magnetic monopoles in the first place. As things stand, there is no evidence of any 'slowing down' of the expansion, but this is not surprising as each cycle is expected to last on the order of a trillion years.\n\n=== Varying ''c'' ===\nAnother adjunct, the [[varying speed of light]] model was offered by [[Jean-Pierre Petit]] in 1988,<ref>{{cite journal |title= An interpretation of cosmological model with variable light velocity |author= J.P.

If emission in some directions is blocked by an opaque barrier, the emission would still be approximately one candela in the directions that are not obscured.\n\nThe word ''candela'' means ''candle'' in [[Latin language|Latin]].\n\n==Definition==\nLike most other SI base units, the candela has an [[operational definition]]\u2014it is defined by a description of a physical process that will produce one candela of luminous intensity. Since the 16th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]]&nbsp;(CGPM) in 1979, the candela has been defined as:<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Base unit definitions: Candela\n| work = The [[NIST]] Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty\n| url = http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/candela.html\n| accessdate =27 September 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency {{val|540|e=12|ul=hertz}} and that has a [[radiant intensity]] in that direction of {{sfrac|683}}&nbsp;[[watt]] per [[steradian]].\n</blockquote>\n\nThe definition describes how to produce a light source that (by definition) emits one candela, but does not specify the luminosity function for weighting radiation at other frequencies.  Such a source could then be used to calibrate instruments designed to measure luminous intensity with reference to a specified luminosity function.  An appendix to the SI Brochure<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/SIApp2_cd_en.pdf |title=''Mise en pratique'' for the definition of the candela and associated derived units for photometric and radiometric quantities in the International System of Units (SI) |work=SI Brochure Appendix 2 |date=July 2015 |publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |format=pdf |access-date=2017-12-07 }}</ref> makes it clear that the luminosity function is not uniquely specified, but must be selected to fully define the candela.\n\nThe candela is sometimes still called by the old name ''candle'',<ref>[http://m-w.com/dictionary/candela Merriam-Webster]</ref> such as in ''[[foot-candle]]'' and the modern definition of ''[[candlepower]]''.\n\n==Explanation==\nThe frequency chosen is in the [[visible light|visible spectrum]] near [[green]], corresponding to a wavelength of about 555&nbsp;nanometres. The [[human eye]], when [[Adaptation (eye)|adapted]] for bright conditions, is most sensitive near this frequency.  At other frequencies, more radiant intensity is required to achieve the same luminous intensity, according to the frequency response of the human eye. The luminous intensity for light of a particular wavelength ''\u03bb'' is given by\n:<math>I_\\mathrm{v}(\\lambda)= 683.002\\ \\mathrm{lm/W} \\cdot \\overline{y}(\\lambda) \\cdot I_\\mathrm{e}(\\lambda) ,</math>\nwhere ''I''<sub>v</sub>(''\u03bb'') is the [[luminous intensity]], ''I''<sub>e</sub>(''\u03bb'') is the [[radiant intensity]] and <math>\\textstyle \\overline{y}(\\lambda)</math> is the [[photopic]] luminosity function. If more than one wavelength is present (as is usually the case), one must integrate over the [[spectrum]] of wavelengths to get the total luminous intensity.\n\n===Examples===\n*A common candle emits light with roughly 1&nbsp;cd luminous intensity. \n*A 25&nbsp;W compact fluorescent light bulb puts out around 1700&nbsp;[[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s; if that light is radiated equally in all directions (i.e. over 4''\u03c0'' steradians), it will have an intensity of <math>I_\\text{V} = \\frac{1700\\ \\text{lm}}{4 \\pi\\ \\text{sr}} \\approx 135\\ \\text{lm/sr} = 135\\ \\text{cd}</math>.\n*Focused into a 20\u00b0&nbsp;beam, the same light bulb would have an intensity of around 18,000&nbsp;cd within the beam.\n*The luminous intensity of [[light-emitting diode]]s is measured in millicandelas (mcd), or thousandths of a candela. Indicator LEDs are typically in the 50&nbsp;mcd range; \"ultra-bright\" LEDs can reach {{nowrap|15,000&nbsp;mcd}} (15&nbsp;cd), or higher.\n\n==Origin==\nPrior to 1948, various standards for luminous intensity were in use in a number of countries. These were typically based on the brightness of the flame from a \"standard candle\" of defined composition, or the brightness of an incandescent filament of specific design. One of the best-known of these was the English standard of candlepower. One candlepower was the light produced by a pure [[spermaceti]] candle weighing one sixth of a pound and burning at a rate of 120&nbsp;[[Grain (unit)|grains]] per hour. Germany, Austria and Scandinavia used the [[Hefnerkerze]], a unit based on the output of a [[Hefner lamp]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sizes.com/units/hefner.htm |title=Hefner unit, or Hefner candle |work=Sizes.com |date=30 May 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nIt became clear that a better-defined unit was needed. [[Jules Violle]] had proposed a standard based on the light emitted by 1&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup> of [[platinum]] at its melting point (or freezing point), calling this the Violle. The light intensity was due to the [[Planck radiator]] (a [[black body]]) effect, and was thus independent of the construction of the device. This made it easy for anyone to measure the standard, as high-purity platinum was widely available and easily prepared.\n\nThe [[Commission Internationale de l'\u00c9clairage]] (International Commission on Illumination) and the CIPM proposed a \u201cnew candle\u201d based on this basic concept. However, the value of the new unit was chosen to make it similar to the earlier unit candlepower by dividing the Violle by 60. The decision was promulgated by the CIPM in 1946:\n<blockquote>The value of the '''new candle''' is such that the brightness of the full radiator at the temperature of solidification of platinum is 60&nbsp;new candles per [[square centimetre]].<ref>{{cite book | title = The Metric System: The International System of Units (SI) | author = Barry N.

In 1967 the 13th CGPM removed the term \"new candle\" and gave an amended version of the candela definition, specifying the atmospheric pressure applied to the freezing platinum:\n<blockquote>The candela is the luminous intensity, in the perpendicular direction, of a surface of {{nowrap|1&thinsp;/&thinsp;600&thinsp;000}} square&nbsp;metre of a black body at the temperature of freezing platinum under a pressure of {{nowrap|101&thinsp;325}}&nbsp;newtons per square&nbsp;metre.<ref>13th CGPM Resolution 5, CR, 104 (1967), and ''Metrologia'', '''4''', 43\u201344 (1968).</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1979, because of the difficulties in realizing a Planck radiator at high temperatures and the new possibilities offered by [[radiometry]], the 16th&nbsp;CGPM adopted the modern definition of the candela.<ref>16th CGPM Resolution 3, CR, 100 (1979), and ''Metrologia'', '''16''', 56 (1980).</ref> The arbitrary (1/683) term was chosen so that the new definition would precisely match the old definition. Although the candela is now defined in terms of the [[second]] (an SI base unit) and the watt (a derived SI unit), the candela remains a base unit of the SI system, by definition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/SIApp2_cd_en.pdf |title=The photometric base unit \u2013 the candela |work=SI Brochure |date=7 September 2007|publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |format=pdf}}</ref>\n\n==SI photometric light units==\n{{SI light units}}\n\n===Relationships between luminous intensity, luminous flux, and illuminance===\nIf a source emits a known luminous intensity ''I''<sub>v</sub> (in candelas) in a well-defined cone, the total [[luminous flux]] ''\u03a6''<sub>v</sub> in [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s is given by\n:''\u03a6''<sub>v</sub>&nbsp;= ''I''<sub>v</sub> 2\u03c0 [1&nbsp;\u2212 cos(''A''/2)],\n\nwhere ''A'' is the ''radiation angle'' of the lamp\u2014the full vertex angle of the emission cone. For example, a lamp that emits 590&nbsp;cd with a radiation angle of 40\u00b0 emits about 224&nbsp;lumens. See [[MR16]] for emission angles of some common lamps.<ref>[http://www.theledlight.com/lumens.html Theory]</ref><ref>[http://led.linear1.org/lumen.wiz Online converter]</ref>\n\nIf the source emits light uniformly in all directions, the flux can be found by multiplying the intensity by 4\u03c0: a uniform 1&nbsp;candela source emits 12.6&nbsp;lumens.\n\nFor the purpose of measuring illumination, the candela is not a practical unit, as it only applies to idealized point light sources, each approximated by a source small compared to the distance from which its luminous radiation is measured, also assuming that it is done so in the absence of other light sources. What gets directly measured by a [[light meter]] is incident light on a sensor of finite area, i.e. [[illuminance]] in lm/m<sup>2</sup> (lux). However, if designing illumination from many point light sources, like light bulbs, of known approximate omnidirectionally-uniform intensities, the contributions to illuminance from [[incoherent light]] being additive, it is mathematically estimated as follows.

The most familiar examples of condensed phases are solids and liquids, which arise from the electromagnetic forces between atoms. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using [[physical law]]s. In particular, they include the laws of [[quantum mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]] and [[statistical mechanics]].\n\nThe most familiar condensed phases are [[solid]]s and [[liquid]]s while more exotic condensed phases include the [[superconductivity|superconducting]] phase exhibited by certain materials at low [[temperature]], the [[ferromagnet]]ic and [[antiferromagnet]]ic phases of [[spin (physics)|spins]] on [[crystal lattice]]s of atoms, and the [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]] found in [[ultracold atom]]ic systems.

In [[quantum phase transition]]s,  the temperature is set to absolute zero, and the non-thermal control parameter, such as pressure or magnetic field,  causes the phase transitions when order is destroyed by quantum fluctuations originating from the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. Here, the different quantum phases of the system refer to distinct [[ground state]]s of the [[Hamiltonian matrix|Hamiltonian]].  Understanding the behavior of quantum phase transition is important in the difficult tasks of explaining the properties of rare-earth magnetic insulators, high-temperature superconductors, and other substances.<ref name=Vojta2003/>\n\nTwo classes of phase transitions occur: first-order transitions and continuous transitions.

Anthropologists have also pointed out that through culture people can adapt to their environment in non-genetic ways, so people living in different environments will often have different cultures. Much of anthropological theory has originated in an appreciation of and interest in the tension between the local (particular cultures) and the global (a universal human nature, or the web of connections between people in distinct places/circumstances).<ref name=\"Cunha 2014 217\u2013233\">{{Cite journal|last=Cunha|first=Manuela|date=2014|title=The Ethnography of Prisons and Penal Confinement|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=43|pages=217\u2013233|doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-102313-030349}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of cultural anthropology took place within the context of the late 19th century, when questions regarding which cultures were \"primitive\" and which were \"civilized\" occupied the minds of not only [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], but many others.

In addressing this question, [[Ethnology|ethnologists]] in the 19th century divided into two schools of thought. Some, like [[Grafton Elliot Smith]], argued that different groups must have learned from one another somehow, however indirectly; in other words, they argued that cultural traits spread from one place to another, or \"[[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffused]]\".\n[[File:Cultural evolution.PNG|thumb|left|300px|In the [[unilineal evolution]] model at left, all cultures progress through set stages, while in the [[multilineal evolution]] model at right, distinctive culture histories are emphasized.]]\n\nOther ethnologists argued that different groups had the capability of creating similar beliefs and practices independently. Some of those who advocated \"independent invention\", like [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], additionally supposed that similarities meant that different groups had passed through the same stages of [[cultural evolution]] (See also [[classical social evolutionism]]). Morgan, in particular, acknowledged that certain forms of society and culture could not possibly have arisen before others. For example, industrial farming could not have been invented before simple farming, and metallurgy could not have developed without previous non-smelting processes involving metals (such as simple ground collection or mining). Morgan, like other 19th century social evolutionists, believed there was a more or less orderly progression from the primitive to the civilized.\n\n20th-century anthropologists largely reject the notion that all human societies must pass through the same stages in the same order, on the grounds that such a notion does not fit the empirical facts. Some 20th-century ethnologists, like [[Julian Steward]], have instead argued that such similarities reflected similar adaptations to similar environments. Although 19th-century ethnologists saw \"diffusion\" and \"independent invention\" as mutually exclusive and competing theories, most [[Ethnography|ethnographers]] quickly reached a consensus that both processes occur, and that both can plausibly account for cross-cultural similarities. But these ethnographers also pointed out the superficiality of many such similarities. They noted that even traits that spread through diffusion often were given different meanings and function from one society to another. Analyses of large human concentrations in big cities, in multidisciplinary studies by [[Ronald Daus]], show how new methods may be applied to the understanding of man living in a global world and how it was caused by the action of extra-European nations,  so highlighting the role of [[Ethics]] in modern anthropology.\n\nAccordingly, most of these anthropologists showed less interest in comparing cultures, generalizing about human nature, or discovering universal laws of cultural development, than in understanding particular cultures in those cultures' own terms. Such ethnographers and their students promoted the idea of \"[[cultural relativism]]\", the view that one can only understand another person's beliefs and behaviors in the context of the culture in which he or she lived or lives.\n\nOthers, such as [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]] (who was influenced both by American cultural anthropology and by French [[\u00c9mile Durkheim|Durkheimian]] [[sociology]]), have argued that apparently similar patterns of development reflect fundamental similarities in the structure of human thought (see [[structuralism]]). By the mid-20th century, the number of examples of people skipping stages, such as going from hunter-gatherers to post-industrial service occupations in one generation, were so numerous that 19th-century evolutionism was effectively disproved.<ref>Diamond, Jared. Guns, Germs and Steel.</ref>\n\n===Cultural relativism===\n{{main|Cultural relativism}}\nCultural relativism is a principle that was established as [[axiom]]atic in [[anthropology|anthropological]] research by [[Franz Boas]] and later popularized by his students.  Boas first articulated the idea in 1887: \"...civilization is not something absolute, but ... is relative, and ... our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes.\"<ref name=\"Levitsky 2009 115\u2013133\">{{Cite journal|last=Levitsky|first=Steven|last2=Murillo|first2=Maria|date=2009|title=Variation in Institutional Strength|url=|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=12|pages=115\u2013133|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.091106.121756}}</ref> Although Boas did not coin the term, it became common among anthropologists after Boas' death in 1942, to express their synthesis of a number of ideas Boas had developed. Boas believed that the sweep of cultures, to be found in connection with any sub-species, is so vast and pervasive that there cannot be a relationship between culture and [[Race (classification of humans)|race]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utpa.edu/faculty/mglazer/theory/cultural_relativism.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613222929/http://www.utpa.edu/faculty/mglazer/Theory/cultural_relativism.htm |archivedate=2007-06-13 |df= }}</ref> Cultural relativism involves specific [[epistemology|epistemological]] and methodological claims.  Whether or not these claims require a specific [[ethics|ethical]] stance is a matter of debate. This principle should not be confused with [[moral relativism]].\n\nCultural relativism was in part a response to Western [[ethnocentrism]]. Ethnocentrism may take obvious forms, in which one consciously believes that one's people's arts are the most beautiful, values the most virtuous, and beliefs the most truthful. Boas, originally trained in [[physics]] and [[geography]], and heavily influenced by the thought of Kant, Herder, and von Humboldt, argued that one's culture may mediate and thus limit one's perceptions in less obvious ways. This understanding of culture confronts anthropologists with two problems: first, how to escape the unconscious bonds of one's own culture, which inevitably bias our perceptions of and reactions to the world, and second, how to make sense of an unfamiliar culture.  The principle of cultural relativism thus forced anthropologists to develop innovative methods and heuristic strategies.\n\nBoas and his students realized that if they were to conduct scientific research in other cultures, they would need to employ methods that would help them escape the limits of their own ethnocentrism.  One such method is that of [[ethnography]]: basically, they advocated living with people of another culture for an extended period of time, so that they could learn the local language and be enculturated, at least partially, into that culture. In this context, cultural relativism is of fundamental methodological importance, because it calls attention to the importance of the local context in understanding the meaning of particular human beliefs and activities.  Thus, in 1948 Virginia Heyer wrote, \"Cultural relativity, to phrase it in starkest abstraction, states the relativity of the part to the whole.  The part gains its cultural significance by its place in the whole, and cannot retain its integrity in a different situation.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heyer | first1 = Virginia | year = 1948 | title = In Reply to Elgin Williams | url = | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 50 | issue = 1| pages = 163\u2013166 | doi=10.1525/aa.1948.50.1.02a00290}}</ref>\n\n===Theoretical approaches===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-1-of-3}}\n* [[Actor\u2013network theory]]\n* [[Cultural materialism (anthropology)|Cultural materialism]]\n* [[Culture theory]]\n* [[Feminist anthropology|Feminism]]\n{{Col-2-of-3}}\n* [[Structural functionalism|Functionalism]]\n* [[Symbolic anthropology|Interpretive]]\n* [[Political Economy in anthropology|Political Economy]]\n* [[Pierre Bourdieu|Practice Theory]]\n{{Col-3-of-3}}\n* [[Structural anthropology|Structuralism]]\n* [[Post-structuralism]]\n* [[Systems theory in anthropology|Systems theory]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Foundational thinkers==\n\n===Lewis Henry Morgan===\n[[Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818\u20131881), a lawyer from [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]], became an advocate for and ethnological scholar of the [[Iroquois]]. His comparative analyses of religion, government, material culture, and especially kinship patterns proved to be influential contributions to the field of anthropology. Like other scholars of his day (such as [[Edward Tylor]]), Morgan argued that human societies could be classified into categories of cultural evolution on a scale of progression that ranged from ''savagery'', to ''barbarism'', to ''civilization''. Generally, Morgan used technology (such as bowmaking or pottery) as an indicator of position on this scale.\n\n=== Franz Boas, founder of the modern discipline ===\n{{main|Boasian anthropology}}\n [[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franz Boas]], one of the pioneers of modern anthropology, often called the \"Father of American Anthropology\"]]\n\n[[Franz Boas]] established academic anthropology in the United States in opposition to Morgan's evolutionary perspective. His approach was empirical, skeptical of overgeneralizations, and eschewed attempts to establish universal laws. For example, Boas studied immigrant children to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable, and that human conduct and behavior resulted from nurture, rather than nature.\n\nInfluenced by the German tradition, Boas argued that the world was full of distinct ''cultures,'' rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little \"civilization\" they had. He believed that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations, like those made in the [[natural science]]s, were not possible.\n\nIn doing so, he fought discrimination against immigrants, blacks, and indigenous peoples of the Americas.<ref>Stocking, George W. (1968) ''Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology''. London: The Free Press.</ref> Many American anthropologists adopted his agenda for social reform, and theories of race continue to be popular subjects for anthropologists today. The so-called \"Four Field Approach\" has its origins in Boasian Anthropology, dividing the discipline in the four crucial and interrelated fields of sociocultural, biological, linguistic, and archaic anthropology (e.g. archaeology). Anthropology in the United States continues to be deeply influenced by the Boasian tradition, especially its emphasis on culture.\n\n[[File:Margaret Mead (1901-1978).jpg|thumbnail|Margaret Mead (1901-1978)]]\n[[File:Ruth Benedict.jpg|thumb|[[Ruth Benedict]] in 1937]]\n\n===Kroeber, Mead and Benedict===\nBoas used his positions at [[Columbia University]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] to train and develop multiple generations of students. His first generation of students included [[Alfred Kroeber]], [[Robert Lowie]], [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], who each produced richly detailed studies of indigenous North American cultures. They provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Kroeber and Sapir's focus on Native American languages helped establish [[linguistics]] as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on [[Indo-European languages]].\n\nThe publication of [[Alfred Kroeber]]'s textbook, ''Anthropology,'' marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material, Boasians felt a growing urge to generalize. This was most obvious in the 'Culture and Personality' studies carried out by younger Boasians such as [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]. Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists including [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]], these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up.\n\nThough such works as ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' and ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' remain popular with the American public, Mead and Benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected. Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia's anthropology department, but she was sidelined by [[Ralph Linton]], and Mead was limited to her offices at the [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]].\n\n===Wolf, Sahlins, Mintz and political economy===\n{{main|Political Economy in anthropology|Eric Wolf|Marshall Sahlins|Sidney Mintz}}\nIn the 1950s and mid-1960s anthropology tended increasingly to model itself after the [[natural science]]s. Some anthropologists, such as [[Lloyd Fallers]] and [[Clifford Geertz]], focused on processes of modernization by which newly independent states could develop. Others, such as [[Julian Steward]] and [[Leslie White]], focused on how societies evolve and fit their ecological niche\u2014an approach popularized by [[Marvin Harris]].\n\n[[Economic anthropology]] as influenced by [[Karl Polanyi]] and practiced by [[Marshall Sahlins]] and George Dalton challenged standard [[neoclassical economics]] to take account of cultural and social factors, and employed Marxian analysis into anthropological study. In England, British Social Anthropology's paradigm began to fragment as [[Max Gluckman]] and [[Peter Worsley]] experimented with Marxism and authors such as [[Rodney Needham]] and [[Edmund Leach]] incorporated L\u00e9vi-Strauss's structuralism into their work. Structuralism also influenced a number of developments in 1960s and 1970s, including [[Psychological anthropology#Cognitive Anthropology|cognitive anthropology]] and componential analysis.\n\nIn keeping with the times, much of anthropology became politicized through the [[Algerian War of Independence]] and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]];<ref>Fanon, Frantz. (1963) The Wretched of the Earth, transl. Constance Farrington. New York, Grove Weidenfeld.</ref> [[Marxism]] became an increasingly popular theoretical approach in the discipline.<ref>Nugent, Stephen ''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/article?title=anthropology&title_type=tka&year_from=1998&year_to=2007&database=1&pageSize=20&index=4 Some reflections on anthropological structural Marxism]'' The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Volume 13, Number 2, June 2007, pp. 419-431(13)</ref> By the 1970s the authors of volumes such as ''Reinventing Anthropology'' worried about anthropology's relevance.\n\nSince the 1980s issues of power, such as those examined in [[Eric Wolf]]'s ''[[Europe and the People Without History]]'', have been central to the discipline. In the 1980s books like ''Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter'' pondered anthropology's ties to colonial inequality, while the immense popularity of theorists such as [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Michel Foucault]] moved issues of power and [[hegemony]] into the spotlight. Gender and sexuality became popular topics, as did the relationship between history and anthropology, influenced by [[Marshall Sahlins]] (again), who drew on [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss|L\u00e9vi-Strauss]] and [[Fernand Braudel]] to examine the relationship between symbolic meaning, sociocultural structure, and individual agency in the processes of historical transformation. [[Jean Comaroff|Jean]] and [[John Comaroff]] produced a whole generation of anthropologists at the University of Chicago that focused on these themes. Also influential in these issues were [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], the critical theory of the [[Frankfurt School]], [[Derrida]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]].<ref name=\"Lewis\">Lewis, Herbert S. (1998) ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/682051 The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and its Consequences]'' ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 100:\" 716-731</ref>\n\n===Geertz, Schneider and interpretive anthropology===\n{{main|Clifford Geertz|David M. Schneider}}\nMany anthropologists reacted against the renewed emphasis on materialism and scientific modelling derived from Marx by emphasizing the importance of the concept of culture. Authors such as [[David Schneider (anthropologist)|David Schneider]], [[Clifford Geertz]], and [[Marshall Sahlins]] developed a more fleshed-out concept of culture as a web of meaning or signification, which proved very popular within and beyond the discipline. Geertz was to state:\n\n{{Quotation| \"Believing, with Max Weber, that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun, I take culture to be those webs, and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning.\"|Clifford Geertz<ref>{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=The Interpretation of Cultures|year=1973|publisher=Basic Books|pages=5}}</ref>}}\n\nGeertz's interpretive method involved what he called \"[[thick description]].\" The cultural symbols of rituals, political and economic action, and of kinship, are \"read\" by the anthropologist as if they are a document in a foreign language. The interpretation of those symbols must be re-framed for their anthropological audience, i.e. transformed from the \"experience-near\" but foreign concepts of the other culture, into the \"experience-distant\" theoretical concepts of the anthropologist. These interpretations must then be reflected back to its originators, and its adequacy as a translation fine-tuned in a repeated way, a process called the [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic circle]]. Geertz applied his method in a number of areas, creating programs of study that were very productive. His analysis of \"religion as a cultural system\" was particularly influential outside of anthropology. David Schnieder's cultural analysis of American kinship has proven equally influential.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=\"Balinese Cockfights and the Seduction of Anthropology\" in Anthropologies and Histories: essays in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=17\u201328}}</ref>  Schneider demonstrated that the American folk-cultural emphasis on \"blood connections\" had an undue influence on anthropological kinship theories, and that kinship is not a biological characteristic but a cultural relationship established on very different terms in different societies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carsten|first=Janet|title=After Kinship|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=18\u201320}}</ref>\n\nProminent British symbolic anthropologists include [[Victor Turner]] and [[Mary Douglas]].\n\n===The post-modern turn===\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s authors such as [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] pondered ethnographic authority, in particular how and why anthropological knowledge was possible and authoritative.

It relies on the assumption that the best way to understand a group of people is to interact with them closely over a long period of time.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Social and Cultural Anthropology: A Very Short Introduction|last=Monaghan|first=John|last2=Just|first2=Peter|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-19-285346-5|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref> The method originated in the [[field work|field research]] of social anthropologists, especially Bronislaw Malinowski in Britain, the students of [[Franz Boas]] in the United States, and in the later urban research of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School of Sociology]]. Historically, the group of people being studied was a small, non-Western society. However, today it may be a specific corporation, a church group, a sports team, or a small town.<ref name=\":4\" /> There are no restrictions as to what the subject of participant observation can be, as long as the group of people is studied intimately by the observing anthropologist over a long period of time. This allows the anthropologist to develop trusting relationships with the subjects of study and receive an inside perspective on the culture, which helps him or her to give a richer description when writing about the culture later. Observable details (like daily time allotment) and more hidden details (like [[taboo]] behavior) are more easily observed and interpreted over a longer period of time, and researchers can discover discrepancies between what participants say\u2014and often believe\u2014should happen (the [[formal system]]) and what actually does happen, or between different aspects of the formal system; in contrast, a one-time survey of people's answers to a set of questions might be quite consistent, but is less likely to show conflicts between different aspects of the social system or between conscious representations and behavior.<ref name=\"DeWalt\">DeWalt, K.

To establish connections that will eventually lead to a better understanding of the cultural context of a situation, an anthropologist must be open to becoming part of the group, and willing to develop meaningful relationships with its members.<ref name=\":4\" /> One way to do this is to find a small area of common experience between an anthropologist and his or her subjects, and then to expand from this common ground into the larger area of difference.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Self in Social Inquiry|last=Swick Perry|first=Helen|publisher=Sage Publications|others=Kenwyn Smith|year=1988|isbn=|editor-last=Berg|editor-first=David|location=Newbury Park, CA|pages=|chapter=Using Participant Observation to Construct a Life History}}</ref> Once a single connection has been established, it becomes easier to integrate into the community, and more likely that accurate and complete information is being shared with the anthropologist.\n\nBefore participant observation can begin, an anthropologist must choose both a location and a focus of study.<ref name=\":4\" /> This focus may change once the anthropologist is actively observing the chosen group of people, but having an idea of what one wants to study before beginning fieldwork allows an anthropologist to spend time researching background information on their topic. It can also be helpful to know what previous research has been conducted in one's chosen location or on similar topics, and if the participant observation takes place in a location where the spoken language is not one the anthropologist is familiar with, he or she will usually also learn that language. This allows the anthropologist to become better established in the community. The lack of need for a translator makes communication more direct, and allows the anthropologist to give a richer, more contextualized representation of what they witness. In addition, participant observation often requires permits from governments and research institutions in the area of study, and always needs some form of funding.<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nThe majority of participant observation is based on conversation. This can take the form of casual, friendly dialogue, or can also be a series of more structured interviews. A combination of the two is often used, sometimes along with photography, mapping, artifact collection, and various other methods.<ref name=\":4\" /> In some cases, ethnographers also turn to structured observation, in which an anthropologist's observations are directed by a specific set of questions he or she is trying to answer.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Doing Cultural Anthropology: Projects for Ethnographic Data Collection|last=Price|first=Laurie J.|publisher=Waveland Press|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=Angrosino|editor-first=Michael|location=Prospect Heights, IL|pages=|chapter=Carrying Out a Structured Observation}}</ref> In the case of structured observation, an observer might be required to record the order of a series of events, or describe a certain part of the surrounding environment.<ref name=\":5\" /> While the anthropologist still makes an effort to become integrated into the group they are studying, and still participates in the events as they observe, structured observation is more directed and specific than participant observation in general. This helps to standardize the method of study when ethnographic data is being compared across several groups or is needed to fulfill a specific purpose, such as research for a governmental policy decision.\n\nOne common criticism of participant observation is its lack of objectivity.<ref name=\":4\" /> Because each anthropologist has his or her own background and set of experiences, each individual is likely to interpret the same culture in a different way. Who the ethnographer is has a lot to do with what he or she will eventually write about a culture, because each researcher is influenced by his or her own perspective.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Culture and Truth|last=Rosaldo|first=Renato|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=Boston, MA|pages=}}</ref> This is considered a problem especially when anthropologists write in the ethnographic present, a present tense which makes a culture seem stuck in time, and ignores the fact that it may have interacted with other cultures or gradually evolved since the anthropologist made observations.<ref name=\":4\" /> To avoid this, past ethnographers have advocated for strict training, or for anthropologists working in teams. However, these approaches have not generally been successful, and modern ethnographers often choose to include their personal experiences and possible biases in their writing instead.<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nParticipant observation has also raised ethical questions, since an anthropologist is in control of what he or she reports about a culture. In terms of representation, an anthropologist has greater power than his or her subjects of study, and this has drawn criticism of participant observation in general.<ref name=\":4\" /> Additionally, anthropologists have struggled with the effect their presence has on a culture. Simply by being present, a researcher causes changes in a culture, and anthropologists continue to question whether or not it is appropriate to influence the cultures they study, or possible to avoid having influence.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Ethnography===\n{{main|Ethnography}}\nIn the 20th century, most cultural and social anthropologists turned to the crafting of [[ethnography|ethnographies]]. An ethnography is a piece of writing about a people, at a particular place and time. Typically, the anthropologist lives among people in another society for a period of time, simultaneously [[participant observation|participating in and observing]] the social and cultural life of the group.\n\nNumerous other ethnographic techniques have resulted in ethnographic writing or details being preserved, as cultural anthropologists also curate materials, spend long hours in libraries, churches and schools poring over records, investigate graveyards, and decipher ancient scripts. A typical ethnography will also include information about physical geography, climate and habitat. It is meant to be a holistic piece of writing about the people in question, and today often includes the longest possible timeline of past events that the ethnographer can obtain through primary and secondary research.\n\n[[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]] developed the ethnographic method, and [[Franz Boas]] taught it in the [[United States]]. Boas' students such as [[Alfred L. Kroeber]], [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Margaret Mead]] drew on his conception of culture and [[cultural relativism]] to develop cultural anthropology in the United States. Simultaneously, Malinowski and [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown|A.R. Radcliffe Brown]]\u00b4s students were developing [[social anthropology]] in the United Kingdom. Whereas cultural anthropology focused on symbols and values, social anthropology focused on social groups and institutions. Today socio-cultural anthropologists attend to all these elements.\n\nIn the early 20th century, socio-cultural anthropology developed in different forms in [[Europe]] and in the United States. European \"[[social anthropologists]]\" focused on observed social behaviors and on \"social structure\", that is, on [[interpersonal relationship|relationships]] among social [[role]]s (for example, husband and wife, or parent and child) and social [[institution]]s (for example, [[anthropology of religion|religion]], [[economic anthropology|economy]], and [[political anthropology|politics]]).\n\nAmerican \"cultural anthropologists\" focused on the ways people expressed their view of themselves and their world, especially in [[symbol]]ic forms, such as [[art]] and [[Mythology|myths]]. These two approaches frequently converged and generally complemented one another. For example, [[kinship]] and [[leadership]] function both as symbolic systems and as social institutions. Today almost all socio-cultural anthropologists refer to the work of both sets of predecessors, and have an equal interest in what people do and in what people say.\n\n===Cross-cultural comparison===\nOne means by which anthropologists combat ethnocentrism is to engage in the process of cross-cultural comparison. It is important to test so-called \"human universals\" against the ethnographic record. Monogamy, for example, is frequently touted as a universal human trait, yet comparative study shows that it is not. \nThe [[Human Relations Area Files]], Inc. (HRAF) is a research agency based at [[Yale University]]. Since 1949, its mission has been to encourage and facilitate worldwide [[Cross-cultural studies|comparative studies]] of human culture, society, and behavior in the past and present. The name came from the Institute of Human Relations, an interdisciplinary program/building at Yale at the time. The Institute of Human Relations had sponsored HRAF's precursor, the ''Cross-Cultural Survey'' (see [[George Peter Murdock]]), as part of an effort to develop an integrated science of human behavior and culture. The two eHRAF databases on the Web are expanded and updated annually. ''eHRAF World Cultures'' includes materials on cultures, past and present, and covers nearly 400 cultures.  The second database, ''eHRAF Archaeology'', covers major archaeological traditions and many more sub-traditions and sites around the world.\n\nComparison across cultures includies the industrialized (or de-industrialized) West.

Nevertheless, many contemporary socio-cultural anthropologists have rejected earlier models of ethnography as treating local cultures as bounded and isolated. These anthropologists continue to concern themselves with the distinct ways people in different locales experience and understand their [[Human condition|lives]], but they often argue that one cannot understand these particular ways of life solely from a local perspective; they instead combine a focus on the local with an effort to grasp larger political, economic, and cultural frameworks that impact local lived realities. Notable proponents of this approach include [[Arjun Appadurai]], [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]], [[George E. Marcus|George Marcus]], [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Michael Taussig]], [[Eric Wolf]] and [[Ronald Daus]].\n\nA growing trend in anthropological research and analysis is the use of multi-sited ethnography, discussed in George Marcus' article, \"Ethnography In/Of the World System: the Emergence of Multi-Sited Ethnography\". Looking at culture as embedded in macro-constructions of a global social order, multi-sited ethnography uses traditional methodology in various locations both spatially and temporally. Through this methodology, greater insight can be gained when examining the impact of world-systems on local and global communities.\n\nAlso emerging in multi-sited ethnography are greater interdisciplinary approaches to fieldwork, bringing in methods from cultural studies, media studies, science and technology studies, and others. In multi-sited ethnography, research tracks a subject across spatial and temporal boundaries. For example, a multi-sited ethnography may follow a \"thing,\" such as a particular commodity, as it is transported through the networks of global capitalism.\n\nMulti-sited ethnography may also follow ethnic groups in [[diaspora]], stories or rumours that appear in multiple locations and in multiple time periods, metaphors that appear in multiple ethnographic locations, or the biographies of individual people or groups as they move through space and time. It may also follow conflicts that transcend boundaries. An example of multi-sited ethnography is [[Nancy Scheper-Hughes]]' work on the international black market for the trade of human organs. In this research, she follows organs as they are transferred through various legal and illegal networks of capitalism, as well as the rumours and urban legends that circulate in impoverished communities about child kidnapping and organ theft.\n\nSociocultural anthropologists have increasingly turned their investigative eye on to [[western culture|\"Western\" culture]]. For example, [[Philippe Bourgois]] won the [[Margaret Mead Award]] in 1997 for ''In Search of Respect'', a study of the entrepreneurs in a Harlem crack-den. Also growing more popular are ethnographies of professional communities, such as laboratory researchers, [[Wall Street]] investors, law firms, or [[information technology]] (IT) computer employees.<ref>[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/expand?pub=infobike://mcb/161/1995/00000008/00000003/art00003&unc=  Dissertation Abstract]</ref>\n\n{{Wikipedia books|Anthropology}}\n\n==Topics in cultural anthropology==\n\n===Kinship and family===\n{{main|Kinship}}\nKinship refers to the anthropological study of the ways in which humans form and maintain relationships with one another, and further, how those relationships operate within and define social organization.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Cultural Anthropology: A Toolkit for a Global Age|last=Guest|first=Kenneth J.|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=349\u2013391}}</ref> \n\nResearch in kinship studies often crosses over into different anthropological subfields including [[Medical anthropology|medical]], [[Feminist anthropology|feminist]], and [[public anthropology]]. This is likely due to its fundamental concepts, as articulated by linguistic anthropologist Patrick McConvell: <blockquote>Kinship is the bedrock of all human societies that we know. All humans recognize fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts, husbands and wives, grandparents, cousins, and often many more complex types of relationships in the terminologies that they use. That is the matrix into which human children are born in the great majority of cases, and their first words are often kinship terms.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McConvell|first=Patrick|date=2013|title=Introduction: kinship change in anthropology and linguistics|url=|journal=Kinship Systems: Change and Reconstruction|location=Salt Lake City, UT|publisher=University of Utah Press|volume=|pages=1\u201318}}</ref></blockquote>Throughout history, kinship studies have primarily focused on the topics of marriage, descent, and procreation.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Peletz|first=Michael G.|date=1995|title=Kinship Studies in Late Twentieth-Century Anthropology|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=24|pages=345\u2013356|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.24.1.343}}</ref> Anthropologists have written extensively on the variations within marriage across cultures and its legitimacy as a human institution. There are stark differences between communities in terms of marital practice and value, leaving much room for anthropological fieldwork. For instance, the [[Nuer people|Nuer]] of Sudan and the Brahmans of Nepal practice [[polygyny]], where one man has several marriages to two or more women. The Nyar of India and Nyimba of Tibet and Nepal practice [[polyandry]], where one woman is often married to two or more men. The marital practice found in most cultures, however, is [[monogamy]], where one woman is married to one man. Anthropologists also study different marital taboos across cultures, most commonly the incest taboo of marriage within sibling and parent-child relationships. It has been found that all cultures have an incest taboo to some degree, but the taboo shifts between cultures when the marriage extends beyond the nuclear family unit.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThere are similar foundational differences where the act of procreation is concerned. Although anthropologists have found that biology is acknowledged in every cultural relationship to procreation, there are differences in the ways in which cultures assess the constructs of parenthood. For example, in the [[Nuyoo Mixtec|Nuyoo]] municipality of [[Oaxaca]], [[Mexico]], it is believed that a child can have partible maternity and partible paternity. In this case, a child would have multiple biological mothers in the case that it is born of one woman and then breastfed by another. A child would have multiple biological fathers in the case that the mother had sex with multiple men, following the commonplace belief in Nuyoo culture that pregnancy must be preceded by sex with multiple men in order have the necessary accumulation of semen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social and Cultural Anthropology: A Very Short Introduction|last=Just|first=Peter|last2=Monaghan|first2=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Oxford, UK|pages=81\u201388}}</ref>\n\n====Late twentieth-century shifts in interest====\nIn the twenty-first century, Western ideas of kinship have evolved beyond the traditional assumptions of the nuclear family, raising anthropological questions of consanguinity, lineage, and normative marital expectation. The shift can be traced back to the 1960s, with the reassessment of kinship's basic principles offered by [[Edmund Leach]], [[Rodney Needham|Rodney Neeham]], [[David M. Schneider|David Schneider]], and others.<ref name=\":1\" /> Instead of relying on narrow ideas of Western normalcy, kinship studies increasingly catered to \"more ethnographic voices, human agency, intersecting power structures, and historical contex\".<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=New Directions in Anthropological Kinship|last=Stone|first=Linda|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|year=2001|isbn=|location=Lanham, MD|pages=1\u2013368}}</ref> The study of kinship evolved to accommodate for the fact that it cannot be separated from its institutional roots and must pay respect to the society in which it lives, including that society's contradictions, hierarchies, and individual experiences of those within it. This shift was progressed further by the emergence of second-wave feminism in the early 1970s, which introduced ideas of martial oppression, sexual autonomy, and domestic subordination. Other themes that emerged during this time included the frequent comparisons between Eastern and Western kinship systems and the increasing amount of attention paid to anthropologists' own societies, a swift turn from the focus that had traditionally been paid to largely \"foreign\", non-Western communities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nKinship studies began to gain mainstream recognition in the late 1990s with the surging popularity of feminist anthropology, particularly with its work related to biological anthropology and the intersectional critique of gender relations. At this time, there was the arrival of \"[[Postcolonial feminism|Third World feminism]]\", a movement that argued kinship studies could not examine the gender relations of developing countries in isolation, and must pay respect to racial and economic nuance as well. This critique became relevant, for instance, in the anthropological study of Jamaica: race and class were seen as the primary obstacles to Jamaican liberation from economic imperialism, and gender as an identity was largely ignored. Third World feminism aimed to combat this in the early twenty-first century by promoting these categories as coexisting factors. In Jamaica, marriage as an institution is often substituted for a series of partners, as poor women cannot rely on regular financial contributions in a climate of economic instability. In addition, there is a common practice of Jamaican women artificially lightening their skin tones in order to secure economic survival. These anthropological findings, according to Third World feminism, cannot see gender, racial, or class differences as separate entities, and instead must acknowledge that they interact together to produce unique individual experiences.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n====Rise of reproductive anthropology====\nKinship studies have also experienced a rise in the interest of reproductive anthropology with the advancement of [[Assisted reproductive technology|assisted reproductive technologies]] (ARTs), including [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF). These advancements have led to new dimensions of anthropological research, as they challenge the Western standard of biogenetically based kinship, relatedness, and parenthood. According to anthropologists [[Marcia C. Inhorn|Maria C. Inhorn]] and Daphna Birenbaum-Carmeli, \"ARTs have pluralized notions of relatedness and led to a more dynamic notion of \"kinning\" namely, kinship as a process, as something under construction, rather than a natural given\".<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Birenbaum-Carmeli|first=Daphna|last2=Inhorn|first2=Maria C.|date=2008|title=Assisted Reproductive Technologies and Culture Change|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=37|pages=182\u2013185|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085230}}</ref> With this technology, questions of kinship have emerged over the difference between biological and genetic relatedness, as gestational surrogates can provide a biological environment for the embryo while the genetic ties remain with a third party.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reproducing Reproduction: Kinship, Power, and Technological Innovation|last=Franklin|first=Sarah|last2=Ragon\u00e9|first2=Helena|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=129}}</ref> If genetic, surrogate, and adoptive maternities are involved, anthropologists have acknowledged that there can be the possibility for three \"biological\" mothers to a single child.<ref name=\":3\" /> With ARTs, there are also anthropological questions concerning the intersections between wealth and fertility: ARTs are generally only available to those in the highest income bracket, meaning the infertile poor are inherently devalued in the system. There have also been issues of reproductive tourism and bodily commodification, as individuals seek economic security through hormonal stimulation and egg harvesting, which are potentially harmful procedures. With IVF, specifically, there have been many questions of embryotic value and the status of life, particularly as it relates to the manufacturing of stem cells, testing, and research.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nCurrent issues in kinship studies, such as adoption, have revealed and challenged the Western cultural disposition towards the genetic, \"blood\" tie.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Logan|first=Janette|date=2013|title=Contemporary Adoptive Kinship|url=|journal=Child & Family Social Work|volume=18|issue=1|pages=35\u201345|doi=10.1111/cfs.12042}}</ref> Western biases against single parent homes have also been explored through similar anthropological research, uncovering that a household with a single parent experiences \"greater levels of scrutiny and [is] routinely seen as the 'other' of the nuclear, patriarchal family\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conceiving the New World Order: The Global Politics of Reproduction|last=Ginsburg|first=Faye G.|last2=Rapp|first2=Rayna|publisher=University of California Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA|pages=}}</ref> The power dynamics in reproduction, when explored through a comparative analysis of \"conventional\" and \"unconventional\" families, have been used to dissect the Western assumptions of child bearing and child rearing in contemporary kinship studies.\n\n==== Critiques of kinship studies ====\nKinship, as an anthropological field of inquiry, has been heavily criticized across the discipline. One critique is that, as its inception, the framework of kinship studies was far too structured and formulaic, relying on dense language and stringent rules.<ref name=\":2\" /> Another critique, explored at length by American anthropologist David Schneider, argues that kinship has been limited by its inherent Western [[ethnocentrism]]. Schneider proposes that kinship is not a field that can be applied cross-culturally, as the theory itself relies on European assumptions of normalcy. He states in the widely circulated 1984 book ''A critique of the study of kinship'' that \"[K]inship has been defined by European social scientists, and European social scientists use their own folk culture as the source of many, if not all of their ways of formulating and understanding the world about them\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=A critique of the study of kinship|last=Schneider|first=David M.|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=1984|isbn=|location=Ann Arbor, MI|pages=}}</ref> However, this critique has been challenged by the argument that it is linguistics, not cultural divergence, that has allowed for a European bias, and that the bias can be lifted by centering the methodology on fundamental human concepts. Polish anthropologist [[Anna Wierzbicka]] argues that \"mother\" and \"father\" are examples of such fundamental human concepts, and can only be Westernized when conflated with English concepts such as \"parent\" and \"sibling\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wierzbicka|first=Anna|date=2016|title=Back to 'Mother' and 'Father': Overcoming the Eurocentrism of Kinship Studies through Eight Lexical Universals|url=|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=57|issue=4|pages=408\u2013428|doi=10.1086/687360}}</ref>\n\nA more recent critique of kinship studies is its solipsistic focus on privileged, Western human relations and its promotion of normative ideals of human exceptionalism. In \"Critical Kinship Studies\", social psychologists Elizabeth Peel and Damien Riggs argue for a move beyond this human-centered framework, opting instead to explore kinship through a \"posthumanist\" vantage point where anthropologists focus on the intersecting relationships of human animals, non-human animals, technologies and practices.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Critical Kinship Studies|last=Peel|first=Elizabeth|last2=Riggs|first2=Damien W.|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2016|isbn=|location=Basingstoke, UK|pages=10\u201320}}</ref>\n\n===Institutional anthropology===\nThe role of anthropology in institutions has expanded significantly since the end of the 20th century.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Organizational Anthropology|last=Douglas|first=Caulkins|publisher=Wiley|year=2012|isbn=|location=Hoboken, N.J.|pages=}}</ref> Much of this development can be attributed to the rise in anthropologists working outside of academia and the increasing importance of globalization in both institutions and the field of anthropology.<ref name=\":02\" /> Anthropologists can be employed by institutions such as for-profit business, nonprofit organizations, and governments.<ref name=\":02\" /> For instance, cultural anthropologists are commonly employed by the United States federal government.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe two types of institutions defined in the field of anthropology are total institutions and social institutions.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0156.xml#firstMatch|title=Institutions|last=Hejtmanek|first=Katie Rose|date=28 November 2016|website=Oxford Bibliographies|access-date=}}</ref> Total institutions are places that comprehensively coordinate the actions of people within them, and examples of total institutions include prisons, convents, and hospitals.<ref name=\":12\" /> Social institutions, on the other hand, are constructs that regulate individuals' day-to-day lives, such as kinship, religion, and economics.<ref name=\":12\" /> Anthropology of institutions may analyze labor unions, businesses ranging from small enterprises to corporations, government, medical organizations,<ref name=\":02\" /> education,<ref name=\"Magolda 24\u201346\"/> prisons,<ref name=\"Cunha 2014 217\u2013233\"/><ref name=\"Rhodes 2001\"/> and financial institutions.<ref name=\"Ho 2009 739\u2013747\"/> Nongovernmental organizations have garnered particular interest in the field of institutional anthropology because of they are capable of fulfilling roles previously ignored by governments,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=William F.|date=|title=1997|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=26|pages=439\u2013464|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.439|year=1997}}</ref> or previously realized by families or local groups, in an attempt to mitigate social problems.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe types and methods of scholarship performed in the anthropology of institutions can take a number of forms.

This may be governed by regulation, [[contract]],  [[technical specifications]] or other published [[technical standard|standard]]s.  Engineering judgment may include such factors as:\n* The [[precision and accuracy]] of measurement and the associated [[uncertainty of measurement]].\n* The statistical [[confidence interval]] or [[tolerance interval]] of the initial measurement.\n* The number of [[significant figures]] of the measurement.\n* The intended use of the measurement including the [[engineering tolerance]]s.\n* Historical definitions of the units and their derivatives used in old measurements; e.g., [[international foot]] vs. US [[Foot (unit)#Survey foot|survey foot]].\n\nSome conversions from one system of units to another need to be exact, without increasing or decreasing the precision of the first measurement. This is sometimes called ''soft conversion''. It does not involve changing the physical configuration of the item being measured.\n\nBy contrast, a ''hard conversion'' or an ''adaptive conversion''  may not be exactly equivalent. It changes the measurement to convenient and workable numbers and units in the new system. It sometimes involves a slightly different configuration, or size substitution, of the item.{{clarifyme|date=December 2017}} [[Real versus nominal value|Nominal values]] are sometimes allowed and used.\n\n=== Conversion factors ===\nA conversion factor is used to change the units of a measured quantity without changing its value. The '''unity bracket method''' of unit conversion<ref name=\"Bod\u00f3Jones2013\">{{cite book|author1=B\u00e9la Bod\u00f3|author2=Colin Jones|title=Introduction to Soil Mechanics|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=P46291mjqAsC&pg=SA9-PA129&dq=conversi%C3%B3n+walshaw+methode&hl=ca&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiale_UhcfJAhXJzxQKHb6wDS0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=conversi%C3%B3n%20walshaw%20methode&f=false|date=26 June 2013|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-55388-6|pages=9\u2013}}</ref> consists of a fraction in which the denominator is equal to the numerator, but they are in different units.  Because of the identity property of multiplication, the value of a quantity will not change as long as it is multiplied by one.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Identity property of multiplication|url = http://www.basic-mathematics.com/identity-property-of-multiplication.html|accessdate = 2015-09-09}}</ref> Also, if the numerator and denominator of a fraction are equal to each other, then the fraction is equal to one. So as long as the numerator and denominator of the fraction are equivalent, they will not affect the value of the measured quantity.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how the unity bracket method is used to convert the rate 5 kilometers per second to meters per second. The symbols km, m, and s represent kilometer, meter, and second, respectively. \n\n<math>\\frac{5 \\cancel {\\text {km}}}{\\text {s}}\n\\cdot</math><math>\\frac{{1000 }\\text { m}}{{1}{\\cancel {\\text { km}}}}</math><math>=</math><math>\\frac{{5000 \\cdot {\\text {m}}}}{{\\text {s}\\cdot {1}}}\n=</math><math>\\frac {5000{\\text { m}}}{\\text {s}}</math>\n\nThus, it is found that 5 kilometers per second is equal to 5000 meters per second.\n\n=== Software tools ===\nThere are many conversion tools. They are found in the function libraries of applications such as spreadsheets databases, in calculators, and in macro packages and plugins for many other applications such as the mathematical, scientific and technical applications.\n\nThere are many standalone applications that offer the thousands of the various units with conversions.  For example, the [[free software movement]] offers a command line utility [https://www.gnu.org/software/units/ GNU units] for Linux and Windows.\n\n== Tables of conversion factors ==\n{{Refimprove|section|date=January 2011}}\nThis article gives lists of conversion factors for each of a number of physical quantities, which are listed in the index. For each physical quantity, a number of different units (some only of historical interest) are shown and expressed in terms of the corresponding SI unit. Conversions between units in the [[metric system]] are defined by their [[SI prefix|prefixes]] (for example, 1 kilogram = 1000&nbsp;grams, 1 milligram = 0.001&nbsp;grams) and are thus not listed in this article. Exceptions are made if the unit is commonly known by another name (for example, 1 micron = 10<sup>\u22126</sup> metre).

The effect of receiving a certain dose of radiation (given as Gy) is variable and depends on many factors, thus a new unit was needed to denote the biological effectiveness of that dose on the body; this is known as the equivalent dose and is shown in Sv. The general relationship between absorbed dose and equivalent dose can be represented as\n:''H = Q \u00b7 D''\nwhere ''H'' is the equivalent dose, ''D'' is the absorbed dose, and ''Q'' is a dimensionless quality factor. Thus, for any quantity of ''D'' measured in Gy, the numerical value for ''H'' measured in Sv may be different.<ref>{{citation | url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CIPM/db/2002/2/ | title=Comit\u00e9 international des poids et mesures, 2002, Recommendation 2 | accessdate=August 27, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Accuracy and precision]]\n*[[Conversion of units of temperature]]\n*[[English units]]\n*[[False precision]]\n*[[Imperial units]]\n*[[International System of Units]]\n*[[Mesures usuelles]]\n*[[Metric prefix]] (e.g. \"kilo-\" prefix)\n*[[Metric system]]\n*[[Natural units]]\n*[[Orders of Magnitude]]\n*[[Rounding]]\n*[[Significant figures]]\n*[[United States customary units]]\n*[[Unit of length]]\n*[[Units (software)]]\n*[[Units conversion by factor-label]]\n*[[Units of measurement]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|group=Converter}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikibooks|FHSST Physics Units:How to Change Units}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Metric and Imperial equivalents}}\n<!-- ATTENTION!

Moreover, within any area possessing a broadly uniform level of agricultural productivity, there is a rough but definite association between the density of the rural population and the average spacing of cities above any chosen minimum size.\"</ref> Thus, centrality within a productive region influences siting, as economic forces would in theory favor the creation of market places in optimal mutually reachable locations.<ref name=Latham2009p18 />\n\n=== Center ===\n{{Main|City centre}}\nThe vast majority of cities have a central area containing buildings with special economic, political, and religious significance. Archaeologists refer to this area by the Greek term [[temenos]] or if fortified as a [[citadel]].<ref>Kaplan et al. (2004), pp. 34\u201335. \"In the center of the city, an elite compound or temenos was situated. Study of the very earliest cities show this compound to be largely composed of a temple and supporting structures. The temple rose some 40 feet above the ground and would have presented a formidable profile to those far away. The temple contained the priestly class, scribes, and record keepers, as well as granaries, schools, crafts\u2014almost all non-agricultural aspects of society.</ref> These spaces historically reflect and amplify the city's centrality and importance to its wider [[city region|sphere of influence]].<ref name=Latham2009p18>Latham et al.

As cities grew in complexity, the major civic institutions, from seats of government to religious buildings, would also come to dominate these points of convergence. Large central squares or open spaces reflected the importance of collective gatherings in city life, such as Tiananmen Square in Beijing, the Z\u00f3calo in Mexico City, the Piazza Navona in Rome and Trafalgar Square in London.</ref> Today cities have a [[city center]] or [[downtown]], sometimes coincident with a [[central business district]].\n\n=== Public space ===\nCities typically have [[public space]]s where anyone can go.

[[Park]]s and other [[Incorporation of nature within a city|natural sites within cities]] provide residents with relief from the hardness and regularity of typical [[built environment]]s.\n\n=== Internal structure ===\n[[Urban structure]] generally follows one or more basic patterns: geomorphic, radial, concentric, rectilinear, and curvilinear. Physical environment generally constrains the form in which a city is built. If located on a mountainside, urban structure may rely on terraces and winding roads. It may be adapted to its means of subsistence (e.g. agriculture or fishing). And it may be set up for optimal defense given the surrounding landscape.<ref>Moholy-Nagy (1968), 21\u201333.</ref> Beyond these \"geomorphic\" features, cities can develop internal patterns, due to natural growth or to [[urban planning|city planning]].\n\nIn a radial structure, main roads converge on a central point. This form could evolve from successive growth over a long time, with concentric traces of [[town wall]]s and [[citadel]]s marking older city boundaries. In more recent history, such forms were supplemented by [[ring road]]s moving traffic around the outskirts of a town. Dutch cities such as [[Amsterdam]] and [[Haarlem]] are structured as a central square surrounded by concentric canals marking every expansion. In cities such as and also [[Moscow]], this pattern is still clearly visible.\n\nA system of rectilinear city streets and land plots, known as the [[grid plan]], has been used for millennia in Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

However, manufacturing employment was in relative decline. Barry Bluestone noted that manufacturing represented a decreasing proportion of the U.S. labour force, from 26.2 per cent in 1973 to 22.1 per cent in 1980. Studies in Canada have likewise shown that manufacturing employment was only in relative decline during these years. Yet mills and factories did close, and towns and cities lost their industries.

Planning tools, beyond the original design of the city itself, include [[public capital]] investment in infrastructure and [[Land-use planning|land-use controls]] such as [[zoning]].

While in the US and elsewhere poverty became associated with the [[inner city]], in France it has become associated with the ''[[banlieue]]s'', areas of urban development which surround the city proper. Meanwhile, across Europe and North America, the racially [[white people|white]] majority is empirically the most segregated group. [[Suburb]]s in the west, and, increasingly, [[gated communities]] and other forms of \"privatopia\" around the world, allow local elites to self-segregate into secure and exclusive [[neighborhood]]s.<ref>Latham et al.

The various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised, in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour, and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level.\"</ref> The global urban proletariat of today, however, generally lacks the status as factory workers which in the nineteenth century provided access to the [[means of production]].<ref name=Davis2004>Mike Davis, \"The Urbanization of Empire: Megacities and the Laws of Chaos\"; ''Social Text'' 22(4), Winter 2004. \"Although studies of the so-called urban informal economy have shown myriad secret liaisons with outsourced multinational production systems, the larger fact is that hundreds of millions of new urbanites must further subdivide the peripheral economic niches of personal service, casual labor, street vending, rag picking, begging, and crime. <br> This outcast proletariat\u2014perhaps 1.5 billion people today, 2.5 billion by 2030\u2014is the fastest-growing and most novel social class on the planet. By and large, the urban informal working class is not a labor reserve army in the nineteenth-century sense: a backlog of strikebreakers during booms; to be expelled during busts; then reabsorbed again in the next expansion. On the contrary, this is a mass of humanity structurally and biologically redundant to the global accumulation and the corporate matrix.<br> It is ontologically both similar and dissimilar to the historical agency described in the ''Communist Manifesto''. Like the traditional working classes, it has radical chains in the sense of having little vested interest in the reproduction of private property. But it is not a socialized collectivity of labor and it lacks significant power to disrupt or seize the means of production. It does possess, however, yet unmeasured powers of subverting urban order.\"</ref>\n\n=== Economics ===\n\nHistorically, cities rely on [[rural area]]s for [[intensive farming]] to [[crop yield|yield surplus crops]], in exchange for which they provide money, political administration, manufactured goods, and culture.<ref name=Kaplan2004p155 /><ref name=Marshall1989p15 /> [[Urban economics]] tends to analyze larger agglomerations, stretching beyond city limits, in order to reach a more complete understanding of the local [[labor market]].<ref>Marshall (1989), pp. 5\u20136.</ref>\n\n[[File:Market in Taipei - DSC01062.JPG|thumb|People shopping for [[food]] at a marketplace in [[Taipei City]].]]\n\nAs hubs of trade cities have long been home to [[retail]] commerce and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] through the interface of [[shopping]].

The bulbs are slender, conical, {{convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long and {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} broad, and grow in dense clusters from the [[root]]s. The scapes (or stems) are hollow and tubular, up to {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|\u2013|3|mm|abbr=on|frac=16}} across, with a soft texture, although, prior to the emergence of a flower, they may appear stiffer than usual. The grass-like,<ref name=\"Linford\"/> leaves, which are shorter than the scapes, are also hollow and tubular, or terete, (round in cross-section) which distinguishes it at a glance from [[Allium tuberosum|garlic chives]] (''Allium tuberosum''). The [[flower]]s are pale purple, and star-shaped with six [[petal]]s, {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide, and produced in a dense [[inflorescence]] of 10-30 together; before opening, the inflorescence is surrounded by a papery [[bract]]. The [[seed]]s are produced in a small, three-valved capsule, maturing in summer. The herb flowers from April to May in the southern parts of its habitat zones and in June in the northern parts.<ref>[http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/Plant.asp?code=J270 Allium schoenoprasum factsheet], from Kemper center for home gardening, retrieved on June 13, 2006, based on the position of the botanical Garden (Missouri)</ref><ref>[http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/mono/allia/alliu/allisch.html Gr\u00e4sl\u00f6k], from Den virtuella floran, retrieved on June 13, 2006, The facts mentioned on the site apply to Sweden, which is in the northern part of the habitat zone.</ref>\n\nChives are the only species of ''Allium'' native to both the [[New world|New]] and the [[Old World]]s.

For many, the [[apotheosis]] of Morris' career was a ''Brass Eye'' special, which dealt with the [[moral panic]] surrounding [[paedophilia]]. It quickly became one of the most complained about programmes in British television history, leading the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' to describe him as \"the most loathed man on TV\".<ref>''The Guardian'' (London) 21 February 2003 Review: CHRIS MORRIS: THE MOVIE: The last time he was in the news, it was for the 'paedophile special' of his TV series Brass Eye.

''Blue Jam'' was adapted into the TV series ''[[Jam (TV series)|Jam]]''. This was followed by ''[[Nathan Barley]]'', a sitcom written in collaboration with a then little-known [[Charlie Brooker]] that satirised [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]], which had low ratings but found success upon its DVD release. Morris followed this by joining the cast of the [[Graham Linehan]] sitcom ''[[The IT Crowd]]'', his first project in which he did not have writing or producing input.\n\nIn 2010, Morris directed his first feature-length film, ''[[Four Lions]]'', which satirised [[Islamic terrorism]] through a group of inept [[British Pakistani]]s. Reception of the film was largely positive, earning Morris his second BAFTA, for \"Outstanding Debut\".

Broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]], it saw him work alongside Iannucci, [[Steve Coogan]], [[Stewart Lee]], [[Richard Herring]] and [[Rebecca Front]]. In 1992, Morris hosted [[Danny Baker]]'s Radio 5 Morning Edition show for a week whilst Baker was on holiday. In 1994, Morris began a weekly evening show, the ''Chris Morris Music Show'', on [[BBC Radio 1]] alongside [[Peter Baynham]] and 'man with a mobile phone' [[Paul Garner (comedian)|Paul Garner]]. In the shows, Morris perfected the spoof interview style that would become a central component of his ''[[Brass Eye]]'' programme. In the same year, Morris teamed up with [[Peter Cook]] (as [[Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling]]), in a series of improvised conversations for [[BBC Radio 3]] entitled ''[[Why Bother? (radio show)|Why Bother?]]''.\n\n===Move into television and film===\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = If you make a joke in an area which is for some reason, normally random, out of bounds, then you might find something out, you might put your finger on something.\n |source = Chris Morris<ref>{{cite news | title=The Last Tempation of Chris | work=The Independent | date=20 April 2000 | author=Hanks, Robert}}</ref>\n |width  = 30%\n |align  = right\n}}\n\nIn 1994, a [[BBC Two|BBC 2]] television series based on ''On the Hour'' was broadcast under the name ''[[The Day Today]]''.

''Brass Eye'' became known for tricking celebrities and politicians into throwing support behind public awareness campaigns for made-up issues that were often absurd or surreal (such as a drug called ''cake'' and an elephant with its trunk stuck up its [[anus]]).\n\nFrom 1997 to 1999 Morris created ''[[Blue Jam]]'' for [[BBC Radio 1]], a surreal taboo-breaking radio show set to an ambient soundtrack.<ref name=\"screenonline\"/> In 2000 this was followed by ''[[Jam (TV series)|Jam]]'', a television reworking.<ref name=\"screenonline\"/> Morris released a 'remix' version of this, entitled ''Jaaaaam''.<ref name=\"screenonline\"/>\n\nIn 2001, a special episode of ''Brass Eye'' on the [[moral panic]] that surrounds [[pedophilia|paedophilia]] attracted a record-breaking number of complaints \u2013 the total remains the third highest on UK television after ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 2007 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 2007]]'' and ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]'' \u2013 as well as heated discussion in the press.

Channel 4 defended the show, insisting the target was the media and its hysterical treatment of paedophilia, and not victims of crime.\n\nIn 2002, Morris ventured into film, directing the [[short film|short]] ''[[My Wrongs 8245\u20138249 & 117|My Wrongs#8245\u20138249 & 117]]'', adapted from a ''Blue Jam'' monologue about a man led astray by a sinister talking dog. It was the first film project of [[Warp Films]], a branch of [[Warp Records]]. In 2002 this won the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] for best short film.<ref name=\"bafta_2002\"/> In 2005 Morris worked on a sitcom entitled ''[[Nathan Barley]]'', based on the character created by [[Charlie Brooker]] for his website [[TVGoHome]] (Morris had contributed to TVGoHome on occasion, under the pseudonym 'Sid Peach'<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brooker|first1=Charlie|title=FULL SESSION - The Alternative MacTaggart: Charlie Brooker|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK8i2mRxX3s|website=YouTube|publisher=Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref>). Co-written by Brooker and Morris, the series was broadcast on [[Channel 4]] in early 2005.\n\n===Post 2005: ''The IT Crowd'', ''Comedy Vehicle'', and ''Four Lions''===\nMorris was a cast member in ''[[The IT Crowd]]'', a [[Channel 4]] sitcom which focused on the information technology department of the fictional company Reynholm Industries. The series was written and directed by [[Graham Linehan]] (writer of ''[[Father Ted]]'' and ''[[Black Books]]'', with whom Morris collaborated on ''The Day Today'', ''Brass Eye'' and ''Jam'') and produced by [[Ash Atalla]] (''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''). Morris played Denholm Reynholm, the eccentric managing director of the company. This marked the first time Morris has acted in a substantial role in a project which he has not developed himself. Morris' character appeared to leave the series during episode two of the second series. His character made a brief return in the first episode of the third series.\n\nIn November 2007, Morris wrote an article for ''[[The Observer]]'' in response to [[Ronan Bennett]]'s article published six days earlier in ''[[The Guardian]]''. Bennett's article, \"Shame on us\", accused the novelist [[Martin Amis]] of racism. Morris' response, \"The absurd world of Martin Amis\", was also highly critical of Amis; although he did not accede to Bennett's accusation of racism, Morris likened Amis to the Muslim cleric [[Abu Hamza al-Masri|Abu Hamza]] (who was jailed for [[inciting racial hatred]] in 2006), suggesting that both men employ \"mock erudition, vitriol and decontextualised quotes from the Qu'ran\" to incite hatred.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Chris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/25/bookscomment.religion |title=The absurd world of Martin Amis |publisher=The Observer |date=25 November 2007 |accessdate=22 June 2008 |quote=Last week Amis was called a racist.

Corn, wheat, hay, soybeans, and oats are all typical crops. Most villages and towns in this region boast both a water tower and a [[grain elevator]]. Irrigation water is available from both surface and subterranean sources. Surface water sources include the South Platte, the Arkansas River, and a few other streams. Subterranean water is generally accessed through [[artesian well]]s. Heavy use of wells for irrigation caused underground water reserves to decline. Eastern Colorado hosts considerable livestock, such as cattle ranches and hog farms.\n\n===Front range===\n[[File:Condiv.JPG|thumb|[[Front Range]] Peaks west of Denver]]\n\nRoughly 70% of Colorado's population resides along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]] between [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. This region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the Pacific Ocean region by the high Rockies in the middle of Colorado. The \"Front Range\" includes Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins, Loveland, Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Greeley, and other townships and municipalities in between. On the other side of the Rockies, the significant population centers in Western Colorado (which is not considered the \"Front Range\") are the cities of [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]], and [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]].\n\n===Continental Divide===\n[[File:Continental-Divide Monarch-Pass 2012-10-28.JPG|thumb|left|[[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] at [[Monarch Pass]]]]\nThe [[Continental Divide of the Americas]] extends along the crest of the [[Rocky Mountains]].

West of the Continental Divide, water flows to the southwest via the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] and the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] into the [[Gulf of California]].\n\nWithin the interior of the Rocky Mountains are several large parks which are high broad basins. In the north, on the east side of the Continental Divide is the [[North Park (Colorado basin)|North Park of Colorado]]. The North Park is drained by the [[North Platte River]], which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska. Just to the south of North Park, but on the western side of the Continental Divide, is the [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park of Colorado]], which is drained by the Colorado River. The [[South Park (Park County, Colorado)|South Park of Colorado]] is the region of the [[headwater]]s of the South Platte River.\n\n===Southern region===\n[[File:Mt Herard sand.JPG|thumb|left|The tallest dunes in North America at [[Great Sand Dunes National Park]] in southern Colorado]]\nIn southmost Colorado is the large [[San Luis Valley]], where the headwaters of the [[Rio Grande]] are located. The valley sits between the [[Sangre De Cristo Mountains]] and [[San Juan Mountains]], and consists of large desert lands that eventually run into the mountains. The Rio Grande drains due south into New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas. Across the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]] to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the [[Wet Mountain Valley]]. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the [[Rio Grande Rift]], a major [[geological formation]] of the Rocky Mountains, and its branches.\n[[File:ChicoClosedBasin.jpg|thumb|right|The high desert lands that make up the San Luis Valley in Southern Colorado]]\n\n===Peaks===\n{{main|Mountain peaks of Colorado}}\nTo the west of the Great Plains of Colorado rises the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. Notable peaks of the Rocky Mountains include [[Longs Peak]], [[Mount Evans]], [[Pikes Peak]], and the [[Spanish Peaks]] near [[Walsenburg, Colorado|Walsenburg]], in southern Colorado. This area drains to the east and the southeast, ultimately either via the [[Mississippi River]] or the [[Rio Grande]] into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n[[File:SANJUANMTNS.JPG|thumb|Peaks of the [[San Juan Mountains]]]]\n\nThe Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain 53 peaks that are {{convert|14000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} or higher in elevation above sea level, known as [[Colorado fourteeners|fourteeners]].<ref>{{cite web|author=U.S. Forest Service|title=Rocky Mountain Region 14ers |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/recreation/14ers/ |accessdate=November 6, 2009}}</ref> These mountains are largely covered with trees such as [[conifer]]s and [[aspen]]s up to the [[tree line]], at an elevation of about {{convert|12000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in southern Colorado to about {{convert|10500|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in northern Colorado. Above this only alpine vegetation grows. Only small parts of the Colorado Rockies are snow-covered year round.\n\nMuch of the alpine snow melts by mid-August with the exception of a few snowcapped peaks and a few small glaciers. The [[Colorado Mineral Belt]], stretching from the [[San Juan Mountains]] in the southwest to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Central City, Colorado|Central City]] on the front range, contains most of the historic gold- and silver-mining districts of Colorado. [[Mount Elbert]] is the highest summit of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The 30 [[Highest mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains|highest major summits]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of North America all lie within the state.\n\n[[File:BlackCanyon.JPG|thumb|[[Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park]] near [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]]]]\n[[File:East rim arch.jpg|thumb|left|Rim Arch in the [[Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness]] in western Colorado]]\n[[File:Redcanyon.JPG|thumb|left|Sandstone cliffs along the Colorado River north of [[Wolcott, Colorado|Wolcott]]]]\n[[File:Lake CO.JPG|thumb|[[Hanging Lake]] near [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]]]]\n\n===Colorado Western Slope===\n[[File:Grand Valley, Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|The Grand Valley in Western Colorado, a large valley made up of high desert terrain. The city of Grand Junction is located in the heart of the valley]]\nThe Western Slope area of Colorado includes the western face of the Rocky Mountains and all of the state to the western border. This area includes several terrains and climates from alpine mountains to arid deserts. The Western Slope includes many ski resort towns in the Rocky Mountains and towns west of the mountains. It is less populous than the Front Range but includes a large number of national parks and monuments.\n\nFrom west to east, the land of Colorado consists of desert lands, desert plateaus, alpine mountains, National Forests, relatively flat grasslands, scattered forests, buttes, and canyons in the western edge of the [[Great Plains]]. The famous [[Pikes Peak]] is located just west of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. Its isolated peak is visible from nearly the Kansas border on clear days, and also far to the north and the south.<ref>{{cite peakbagger|pid=5689|name=Pikes Peak, Colorado|accessdate=October 10, 2009}}</ref> The northwestern corner of Colorado is a sparsely populated region, and it contains part of the noted [[Dinosaur National Monument]], which is not only a [[paleontology|paleontological]] area, but is also a scenic area of rocky hills, canyons, arid desert, and streambeds. Here, the Green River briefly crosses over into Colorado. Desert lands in Colorado are located in and around areas such as the [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[Canon City, Colorado|Canon City]], [[Florence, Colorado|Florence]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Canyon of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Hovenweep National Monument]], [[Ute Mountain]], [[Delta, Colorado|Delta]], [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Colorado National Monument]], and other areas surrounding the [[Uncompahgre Plateau]] and [[Uncompahgre National Forest]].\n\nThe Western Slope of Colorado is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries (primarily the [[Gunnison River]], [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], and the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]]), or by evaporation in its arid areas. The Colorado River flows through [[Glenwood Canyon]], and then through an arid valley made up of desert from [[Rifle, Colorado|Rifle]] to [[Parachute, Colorado|Parachute]], through the desert canyon of [[De Beque Canyon]], and into the arid desert of [[Grand Valley (Colorado-Utah)|Grand Valley]], where the city of Grand Junction is located. Also prominent in or near the southern portion of the Western Slope are the [[Grand Mesa]], which lies to the southeast of Grand Junction; the high San Juan Mountains, a rugged mountain range; and to the west of the San Juan Mountains, the [[Colorado Plateau]], a high arid region that borders Southern Utah.\n\n[[Grand Junction, Colorado]] is the largest city on the Western Slope. Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of [[television broadcasting]] west of the Continental Divide in Colorado, though most mountain resort communities publish daily newspapers. Grand Junction is located along [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70]], the only major highway in Western Colorado. Grand Junction is also along the major railroad of the Western Slope, the [[Union Pacific]]. This railroad also provides the tracks for [[Amtrak]]'s [[California Zephyr]] passenger train, which crosses the Rocky Mountains between Denver and Grand Junction via a route on which there are no continuous highways.\n\n[[File:Colorado National Monument (4939640266).jpg|thumb|right|The Colorado National Monument near Grand Junction. The monument is made up of high desert canyons and sandstone rock formations]]\n\nThe Western Slope includes multiple notable destinations in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, including [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]], with its resort hot springs, and the [[ski resort]]s of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Breckenridge, Colorado|Breckenridge]], [[Vail, Colorado|Vail]], [[Crested Butte, Colorado|Crested Butte]], [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]], and [[Telluride, Colorado|Telluride]].\n\nHigher education in and near the Western Slope can be found at [[Colorado Mesa University]] in Grand Junction, [[Western Colorado University]] in Gunnison, [[Fort Lewis College]] in Durango, and [[Colorado Mountain College]] in Glenwood Springs and Steamboat Springs.\n\n[[File:Four Corners Monument (1).jpg|thumb|The [[Four Corners Monument]], with [[Ute Mountain]] in the distance]]\nColorado is one of four states in the United States that share a common geographic point \u2013 the [[Four Corners]] together with Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. At this intersection, it is possible to stand in four states at once.\n\n{{See also|Colorado cities and towns|List of counties in Colorado|Colorado municipalities|Colorado rivers|Four Corners Monument}}\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Colorado K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] of Colorado]]\nThe [[climate]] of Colorado is more complex than states outside of the [[Mountain States]] region. Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado. Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands. Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate.\n\nAs a general rule, with an increase in elevation comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation. Northeast, east, and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains, while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills, and mountains. Northwest and west Colorado are predominantly mountainous, with some desert lands mixed in. Southwest and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas.\n\n===Eastern Plains===\nThe climate of the Eastern Plains is [[semi-arid climate|semiarid]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: [[Cold semi-arid climate|''BSk'']]) with low humidity and moderate precipitation, usually from {{convert|15|to|25|in|abbr=off|mm|sp=us}} annually. The area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool, clear nights, which give this area a great average [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal temperature range]]. The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable as warmth dissipates to space during clear nights, the heat radiation not being trapped by clouds. The Front Range urban corridor, where most of the population of Colorado resides, lies in a pronounced [[rain shadow|precipitation shadow]] as a result of being on the [[Leeward|lee]] side of the Rocky Mountains.<ref name=\"usgsFRUC1978\">{{cite report |last=Hansen |first=Wallace R. |last2=Chronic |first2=John |last3=Matelock |first3=John |date=1979|orig-year=first published 1978|title=Climatography of the Front Range Urban Corridor and vicinity, Colorado |work=Geological Survey Professional Paper 1019|publisher=USG Printing Office|place=Washington, DC |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1019/report.pdf |accessdate=March 21, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn summer, this area can have many days above 95&nbsp;\u00b0F (35&nbsp;\u00b0C) and often 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=\"Climate of Colorado\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/COLORADO.htm |title=Climate Of Colorado |website=Wrcc.dri.edu |date= |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}</ref> On the plains, the winter lows usually range from 25 to \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22124 to \u221223&nbsp;\u00b0C). About 75% of the precipitation falls within the growing season, from April to September, but this area is very prone to droughts. Most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and from major snowstorms that occur in the winter and early spring. Otherwise, winters tend to be mostly dry and cold.<ref name=\"Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America\">{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=096427&refer=&cityname=Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America|title=Denver, Colorado Travel Weather Averages|publisher=Weatherbase |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn much of the region, March is the snowiest month. April and May are normally the rainiest months, while April is the wettest month overall. The Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to [[Chinook wind]]s which warm the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C) or higher in the winter.<ref name=\"Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America\" /> The average July temperature is 55&nbsp;\u00b0F (13&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the morning and 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the afternoon. The average January temperature is 18&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22128&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the morning and 48&nbsp;\u00b0F (9&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the afternoon, although variation between consecutive days can be 40&nbsp;\u00b0F (20&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\n===Front range foothills===\nJust west of the plains and into the foothills, there are a wide variety of climate types. Locations merely a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography. Most valleys have a semi-arid climate not unlike the eastern plains, which transitions to an [[alpine climate]] at the highest elevations. Microclimates also exist in local areas that run nearly the entire spectrum of climates, including subtropical highland (''Cfb/Cwb''), humid subtropical (''Cfa''), humid continental (''Dfa/Dfb''), Mediterranean (''Csa/Csb'') and subarctic (''Dfc'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenhornchamber.org/relocation.html |title=Relocating to Greenhorn Valley |date= |accessdate=February 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Extreme weather===\n[[File:October Snow in Colorado.jpg|thumb|Snow highlights the rugged mountains, as well as the urban and agricultural landscapes of the Colorado plains.]]\n\nExtreme weather changes are common in Colorado, although the majority of extreme weather occurs in the least populated areas of the state. Thunderstorms are common east of the Continental Divide in the spring and summer, yet are usually brief. Hail is a common sight in the mountains east of the divide and in the northwest part of the state. The Eastern Plains have had some of the biggest hail storms in North America.<ref name=ccc/> Notable examples are the severe hailstorms that hit Denver on July 11, 1990<ref>{{cite web|url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2014/07/11/historic-denver-hailstorm-was-called-worst-in-american-history/|title=Historic Denver Hailstorm Was Called Worst In American History|date=July 11, 2014|publisher=}}</ref> and May 8, 2017, the latter being the costliest ever in the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2017/05/23/hailstorm-costliest-ever-metro-denver/|title=Hailstorm that hammered west metro Denver May 8 is costliest ever for Colorado|date=May 23, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Plains are part of the extreme western portion of [[Tornado Alley]]; some damaging tornadoes in the Eastern Plains include the 1990 [[Limon, Colorado|Limon]] [[Fujita scale|F3]] tornado and the 2008 [[Windsor, Colorado|Windsor]] [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF3]] tornado, which devastated the small town.<ref>{{cite web\n | last =Slater\n | first =Jane\n | title =Thursday's Tornado State's 4th Costliest Disaster\n | publisher =[[KMGH]]\n | date =May 28, 2008\n | url =http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/16408116/detail.html}}</ref>\nThe plains are also susceptible to occasional floods, which are caused both by thunderstorms and by the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather. Notable examples include the [[1965 Denver Flood]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/news/the-1965-flood-how-denvers-greatest-disaster-changed-the-city-6668119|title=The 1965 Flood: How Denver's Greatest Disaster Changed the City|first=Alan|last=Prendergast|date=April 29, 2015|publisher=}}</ref> the [[Big Thompson River]] flooding of 1976 and the [[2013 Colorado floods]]. Hot weather is common during summers in Denver. The city's record in 1901 for the number of consecutive days above 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) was broken during the summer of 2008. The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a week.<ref>{{cite web\n | title =Denver's Consecutive 90 Degree Streaks\n | publisher =[[National Weather Service]]\n | accessdate =October 10, 2009\n | url =http://www.crh.noaa.gov/bou/?n=consec90}}</ref>\n\nMuch of Colorado is a very dry state averaging only {{convert|17|in|mm|abbr=off|sp=us}} of precipitation per year statewide and rarely experiences a time when some portion of the state is not in some degree of drought.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccc.atmos.colostate.edu/pdfs/ahistoryofdrought.pdf|title=A History of Drought|format=PDF |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref> The lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of wildfires in the state, such as the [[Hayman Fire]] of 2002, one of the largest wildfires in American history, and the [[Fourmile Canyon#Fourmile Canyon Fire|Fourmile Canyon Fire]] of 2010, which until the [[Waldo Canyon Fire]] and [[High Park Fire]] of June 2012, and the [[Black Forest Fire]] of June 2013, was the most destructive wildfire in Colorado's recorded history.\n\nHowever, some of the mountainous regions of Colorado receive a huge amount of moisture from winter snowfalls. The spring melts of these snows often cause great waterflows in the [[Yampa River]], the [[Colorado River]], the Rio Grande, the Arkansas River, the North Platte River, and the South Platte River.\n[[File:Overlook of Yampa River.jpg|thumb|The Yampa River, from a high overlook]]\n\nWater flowing out of the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very significant source of water for the farms, towns, and cities of the southwest states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, as well as the Midwest, such as Nebraska and Kansas, and the southern states of Oklahoma and Texas. A significant amount of water is also diverted for use in California; occasionally (formerly naturally and consistently), the flow of water reaches northern Mexico.\n\n===Records===\nThe highest ambient air temperature ever recorded in Colorado was {{convert|118|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} on July 11, 1888, at [[Bennett, Colorado|Bennett]].

It is said to have been built by the Ancient Pueblo peoples.]]\n{{Main|History of Colorado|Timeline of Colorado history}}\nThe region that is today the state of Colorado has been inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for more than 13,000 years. The [[Lindenmeier Site]] in [[Larimer County, Colorado|Larimer County]] contains [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] dating from approximately 11200 BC to 3000 BC. The eastern edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was a [[Human migration|major migration route]] that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the Americas. The [[Ancient Pueblo peoples]] lived in the valleys and mesas of the [[Colorado Plateau]].<ref>\"[http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/genocide-native-americans-ethnic-cleansing.html Genocide Wiped Out Native American Population ]\", Discovery News, September 20, 2010.</ref> The [[Ute Nation]] inhabited the mountain valleys of the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Western Rocky Mountains]], even as far east as the Front Range of present day. The [[Apache]] and the [[Comanche]] also inhabited Eastern and Southeastern parts of the state. At times, the [[Arapaho Nation]] and the [[Cheyenne Nation]] moved west to hunt across the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]].\n\nThe Spanish Empire claimed Colorado as part of its New Mexico province prior to U.S. involvement in the region.  The U.S. acquired a territorial claim to the eastern Rocky Mountains with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France in 1803. This U.S. claim conflicted with the claim by Spain to the upper [[Arkansas River|Arkansas River Basin]] as the exclusive trading zone of its colony of [[Santa F\u00e9 de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]]. In 1806, [[Zebulon Pike]] led a [[Pike expedition|U.S. Army reconnaissance expedition]] into the disputed region. Colonel Pike and his men were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the [[San Luis Valley]] the following February, taken to [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], and expelled from Mexico the following July.\n\nThe U.S. relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the [[Arkansas River]] and south of [[42nd parallel north]] and west of the [[100th meridian west]] as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the [[Adams-On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819. The treaty took effect February 22, 1821. Having settled its border with Spain, the U.S. admitted the southeastern portion of the [[Missouri Territory|Territory of Missouri]] to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[Missouri|state of Missouri]] on August 10, 1821. The remainder of Missouri Territory, including what would become northeastern Colorado, became unorganized territory, and remained so for 33 years over the [[Slavery in the United States|question of slavery]]. After 11 years of war, Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] signed on August 24, 1821. Mexico eventually ratified the Adams-On\u00eds Treaty in 1831. The [[Texian Revolt]] of 1835\u201336 fomented a dispute between the U.S. and Mexico which eventually erupted into the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846. Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the U.S. with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] at the conclusion of the war in 1848.\n\n[[File:Mexican Cession in Mexican View.PNG|thumb|Map of the [[Mexican Cession]], with the white representing the territory the United States received from Mexico (plus land ceded to the [[Republic of Texas]]) after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Well over half of Colorado was received during this treaty.]]\n\nMost American [[settler]]s traveling overland west to the [[Oregon Country]], namely the new goldfields of California, or the new [[Mormon]] settlements of the [[State of Deseret]] in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], avoided the rugged [[Southern Rocky Mountains]], and instead followed the [[North Platte River]] and [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] to [[South Pass (Wyoming)]], the lowest crossing of the [[Continental Divide]] between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains. In 1849, the Mormons of the Salt Lake Valley organized the extralegal [[State of Deseret]], claiming the entire [[Great Basin]] and all lands drained by the rivers [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green]], [[Colorado River|Grand]], and [[Colorado River|Colorado]]. The federal government of the U.S. flatly refused to recognize the new Mormon government, because it was [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Brigham Young's early theocratic leadership|theocratic]] and sanctioned [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]]. Instead, the [[Compromise of 1850]] divided the [[Mexican Cession]] and the northwestern claims of Texas into a new state and two new territories, the [[state of California]], the [[Territory of New Mexico]], and the [[Territory of Utah]]. On April 9, 1851, [[Mexican American]] settlers from the area of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] settled the village of [[San Luis, Colorado|San Luis]], then in the [[New Mexico Territory]], later to become Colorado's first permanent [[European American|Euro-American]] [[settlement (migration)|settlement]].\n[[File:Anasazi Heritage Center.jpg|thumb|The Anasazi Heritage Center in [[Dolores, Colorado|Dolores]]]]\n\nIn 1854, Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] persuaded the [[U.S. Congress]] to divide the unorganized territory east of the [[Continental Divide]] into two new organized territories, the [[Territory of Kansas]] and the [[Territory of Nebraska]], and an unorganized southern region known as the [[Indian territory]]. Each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries, but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between [[free soil]] and [[Proslavery in the antebellum United States|pro-slavery]] factions.\n\nThe gold seekers organized the [[Jefferson Territory|Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson]] on August 24, 1859, but this new territory failed to secure approval from the [[Congress of the United States]] embroiled in the debate over slavery. The election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] for the President of the United States on November 6, 1860, led to the [[secession]] of nine southern [[slave states]] and the threat of [[American Civil War|civil war among the states]]. Seeking to augment the political power of the [[free state (United States)|Union states]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]-dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the [[Territory of Kansas]] into the [[United States|Union]] as the free [[Kansas|State of Kansas]] on January 29, 1861, leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory, and its gold-mining areas, as unorganized territory.\n\n===Territory act===\n[[File:1860 colorado territory map.png|thumb|left|The territories of [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], [[Utah Territory|Utah]], [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]], and [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]] before the creation of the [[Territory of Colorado]]]]\nThirty days later on February 28, 1861, outgoing U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] signed an Act of Congress organizing the [[Free state (United States)|free]] [[Territory of Colorado]].<ref name=ColoradoTerritory>{{cite web | url = http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/territory.pdf | title = An Act to provide a temporary Government for the Territory of Colorado | format = PDF | publisher = [[Thirty-sixth United States Congress]] | date = February 28, 1861 | accessdate =June 12, 2007}}</ref> The original boundaries of Colorado remain unchanged today. The name Colorado was chosen because it was commonly believed that the [[Colorado River]] originated in the territory.<ref name=Colorado_River>Early explorers identified the [[Gunnison River]] in Colorado as the [[headwaters]] of the Colorado River. The [[Colorado River|Grand River]] in Colorado was later tentatively identified as the primary headwaters of the river. Finally in 1916, [[E.C. LaRue]], the Chief Hydrologist of the [[United States Geological Survey]], identified the Green River in southwestern Wyoming as the proper headwaters of the actual, overall Colorado River.</ref> In 1776, Spanish priest [[Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante]] recorded that [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the area knew the river as ''[[:es:Rio Colorado|el Rio Colorado]]'' for the red-brown silt that the river carried from the mountains.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Multiple Property Documentation Form |title=National-Register-of-Historic |url=https://www.nps.gov/elca/learn/historyculture/upload/National-Register-of-Historic-Places-Multiple-Properties-508.pdf |website=www.nps.gov}}</ref> In 1859, a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Topography|topographic]] expedition led by Captain [[John Navarre Macomb, Jr.|John Macomb]] located the confluence of the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] with the [[Grand River (Colorado)|Grand River]] in what is now [[Canyonlands National Park]] in [[Utah]].<ref name=Macomb>Report of the exploring expedition from Santa F\u00e9, New Mexico, to the junction of the Grand and Green Rivers of the great Colorado of the West, in 1859: under the command of Capt.

While many gold seekers held sympathies for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause.\n\nIn 1862, a force of Texas cavalry invaded the [[Territory of New Mexico]] and captured [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on March 10. The object of this [[New Mexico Campaign|Western Campaign]] was to seize or disrupt the gold fields of Colorado and California and to seize ports on the Pacific Ocean for the Confederacy. A hastily organized force of Colorado volunteers force-marched from [[Denver City, Colorado Territory]], to [[Glorieta Pass]], New Mexico Territory, in an attempt to block the Texans. On March 28, the Coloradans and local New Mexico volunteers stopped the Texans at the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], destroyed their cannon and supply wagons, and dispersed 500 of their horses and mules. The Texans were forced to retreat to Santa Fe. Having lost the supplies for their campaign and finding little support in New Mexico, the Texans abandoned Santa Fe and returned to [[San Antonio]] in defeat. The Confederacy made no further attempts to seize the Southwestern United States.\n\nIn 1864, [[Governor of Colorado|Territorial Governor]] [[John Evans (governor)|John Evans]] appointed the Reverend [[John Chivington]] as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] warriors who were accused of stealing cattle. Colonel Chivington ordered his men to attack a band of Cheyenne and Arapaho encamped along Sand Creek. Chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors. The militia returned to Denver City in triumph, but several officers reported that the so-called battle was a blatant massacre of Indians at peace, that most of the dead were women and children, and that bodies of the dead had been hideously mutilated and desecrated. Three U.S. Army inquiries condemned the action, and incoming President [[Andrew Johnson]] asked Governor Evans for his resignation, but none of the perpetrators was ever punished. This event is now known as the [[Sand Creek massacre]].\n\n[[File:Mount of the Holy Cross.jpeg|thumb|[[Mount of the Holy Cross]] was photographed by [[William Henry Jackson]] in 1874]]\nIn the midst and aftermath of Civil War, many discouraged prospectors returned to their homes, but a few stayed and developed mines, mills, farms, ranches, roads, and towns in Colorado Territory. On September 14, 1864, James Huff discovered silver near [[Argentine Pass]], the first of many silver strikes. In 1867, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] laid its tracks west to Weir, now [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]], in the northeast corner of the Territory. The Union Pacific linked up with the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], on May 10, 1869, to form the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The [[Denver Pacific Railway]] reached Denver in June the following year, and the [[Kansas Pacific]] arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent. In 1872, rich veins of silver were discovered in the [[San Juan Mountains]] on the [[Ute tribe|Ute Indian]] reservation in southwestern Colorado. The Ute people were removed from the San Juans the following year.\n\n===Statehood===\n[[File:Georgetown loop 1899.jpg|thumb|The [[Georgetown Loop]] of the [[Colorado Central Railroad]] as photographed by [[William Henry Jackson]] in 1899]]\nThe [[United States Congress]] passed an enabling act on March 3, 1875, specifying the requirements for the [[Territory of Colorado]] to become a state.<ref name=Colorado_Enabling_Act>{{cite web|url=https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/PROCEEDINGS%20OF%20THE%20CONSTITUTIONAL%20CONVENTION_0.pdf|title=An Act to Enable the People of Colorado to Form a Constitution and State Government, and for the Admission of the Said State into the Union on an Equal Footing with the Original States |format=PDF |author=Forty-third United States Congress |author-link=Forty-third United States Congress |date=March 3, 1875}}</ref> On August 1, 1876 (28 days after the [[Centennial of the United States]]), U.S. President [[Ulysses S.

The [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] of 1890 invigorated silver mining, and Colorado's last, but greatest, gold strike at [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] a few months later lured a new generation of gold seekers. Colorado women were granted the right to vote beginning on November 7, 1893, making Colorado the second state to grant [[universal suffrage]] and the first one by a popular vote (of Colorado men). The repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 led to a staggering collapse of the mining and agricultural economy of Colorado, but the state slowly and steadily recovered. Between the 1880s and 1930s, Denver's floriculture industry developed into a major industry in Colorado.<ref>Shu Liu and Linda M.

By the [[United States Census, 1930|U.S. Census in 1930]], the population of Colorado first exceeded one million residents. Colorado suffered greatly through the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s, but a major wave of immigration following World War II boosted Colorado's fortune. Tourism became a mainstay of the state economy, and high technology became an important economic engine. The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimated that the population of Colorado exceeded five million in 2009.\n\nThree warships of the [[U.S. Navy]] have been named the USS ''[[USS Colorado|Colorado]]''.

The Colorado uranium industry has seen booms and busts, but continues to this day. Not counting byproduct uranium from phosphate, Colorado is considered to have the third-largest uranium reserves of any U.S. state, behind Wyoming and New Mexico.\n\nUranium price increases from 2001 to 2007 prompted a number of companies to revive uranium mining in Colorado. Price drops and financing problems in late 2008 forced these companies to cancel or scale back uranium-mining project. Currently, there are no uranium producing mines in Colorado.\n\nColorado's high Rocky Mountain ridges and eastern plains offer [[wind power]] potential, and geologic activity in the mountain areas provides potential for [[geothermal electricity|geothermal power]] development. Much of the state is sunny, and could produce [[solar power in Colorado|solar power]]. Major rivers flowing from the Rocky Mountains offer [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] resources. Corn grown in the flat eastern part of the state offers potential resources for [[ethanol]] production.\n\n==Transportation==\n{{main|Transportation in Colorado}}\n[[File:Colorado.JPG|thumb|left|A Colorado state welcome sign]]\n\nColorado's primary mode of transportation (in terms of passengers) is its highway system. [[Interstate 25 in Colorado|Interstate&nbsp;25]] (I-25) is the primary north\u2013south highway in the state, connecting Pueblo, Colorado Springs, Denver, and Fort Collins, and extending north to Wyoming and south to New Mexico. [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|I-70]] is the primary east\u2013west corridor. It connects Grand Junction and the mountain communities with Denver, and enters Utah and Kansas. The state is home to a network of US and Colorado highways that provide access to all principal areas of the state. Many smaller communities are only connected to this network via county roads.\n\n[[File:DIA.jpg|thumb|right|The main terminal of Denver International Airport evokes the peaks of the [[Front Range]]]]\n\n[[Denver International Airport]] (DIA) is the fifth-busiest domestic U.S. airport and [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|twentieth busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn%3Daci%26cp%3D1-5-212-218-222_666_2__ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219174500/http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&cp=1-5-212-218-222_666_2__ |archivedate=February 19, 2012 }}</ref> DIA handles by far the largest volume of commercial air traffic in Colorado, and is the busiest U.S. hub airport between Chicago and the Pacific coast, making Denver the most important airport for connecting passenger traffic in the western United States.\n\nExtensive public transportation bus services are offered both intra-city and inter-city\u2014including the Denver metro area's extensive RTD services. The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD) operates the popular [[RTD Bus & Rail]] transit system in the [[Denver Metropolitan Area]].

Colorado's contribution to world railroad history was forged principally by the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]] which began in 1870 and wrote the book on mountain railroading. In 1988 the \"Rio Grande\" acquired, but was merged into, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] by their joint owner [[Philip Anschutz]]. On September 11, 1996, Anschutz sold the combined company to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], creating the largest railroad network in the United States. The Anschutz sale was partly in response to the earlier merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe which formed the large Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), Union Pacific's principal competitor in western U.S. railroading. Both Union Pacific and BNSF have extensive freight operations in Colorado.\n\nColorado's freight railroad network consists of 2,688 miles of Class I trackage. It is integral to the U.S. economy, being a critical artery for the movement of energy, agriculture, mining, and industrial commodities as well as general freight and manufactured products between the East and Midwest and the Pacific coast states.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aar.org/keyissues/Pages/Railroads-And-States.aspx |title=Railroads and States |publisher=Aar.org |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606044205/https://www.aar.org/keyissues/Pages/Railroads-And-States.aspx |archivedate=June 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\nIn August 2014, Colorado began to issue driver licenses to [[Alien (law)|aliens]] [[Illegal immigration to the United States|not lawfully in the United States]] who lived in Colorado.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nicholson |first=Kieran |date=August 1, 2014 |title=Immigrants here illegally begin receiving Colorado driver licenses |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26257608/immigrants-here-illegally-begin-receiving-colorado-driver-licenses |newspaper=Denver Post |access-date=August 1, 2014}}</ref> In September 2014, [[KCNC]] reported that 524 non-citizens were issued Colorado driver licenses that are normally issued to U.S. citizens living in Colorado.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=524 Non-Citizens Received Regular Colorado Driver's Licenses, DMV Says |url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2014/09/12/524-non-citizens-received-regular-colorado-drivers-licenses-dmv-says/ |newspaper=KCNC |location=Denver |date=September 12, 2014 |access-date=February 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Government and politics==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em\"\n! colspan = 6 | Colorado registered voters as of April 1, 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/VoterRegNumbers/2016/March/VotersByPartyStatus.pdf|title=Total Registered Voters By Party Affiliation and Status As of Fri Apr 01 2016 03:07:45 GMT-0600 (MDT)|publisher=}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

These districts may provide schools, law enforcement, fire protection, water, sewage, drainage, irrigation, transportation, recreation, infrastructure, cultural facilities, business support, redevelopment, or other services.\n\nSome of these districts have authority to levy sales tax and well as property tax and use fees. This has led to a hodgepodge of sales tax and property tax rates in Colorado. There are some street intersections in Colorado with a different sales tax rate on each corner, sometimes substantially different.\n\nSome of the more notable Colorado districts are:\n* The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD), which affects the counties of Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, and portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, and Douglas Counties\n* The [[Scientific and Cultural Facilities District]] (SCFD), a special regional tax district with physical boundaries contiguous with county boundaries of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson Counties\n** It is a 0.1% retail sales and use tax (one penny on every $10).\n** According to the Colorado statute, the SCFD distributes the money to local organizations on an annual basis. These organizations must provide for the enlightenment and entertainment of the public through the production, presentation, exhibition, advancement or preservation of art, music, theater, dance, zoology, botany, natural history or cultural history.\n** As directed by statute, SCFD recipient organizations are currently divided into three \"tiers\" among which receipts are allocated by percentage.\n*** Tier I includes regional organizations: the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Denver Zoo, and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. It receives 65.5%.\n*** Tier II currently includes 26 regional organizations. Tier II receives 21%.\n*** Tier III has over 280 local organizations such as small theaters, orchestras, art centers, and natural history, cultural history, and community groups. Tier III organizations apply for funding to the county cultural councils via a grant process. This tier receives 13.5%.\n** An 11-member board of directors oversees the distributions in accordance with the Colorado Revised Statutes. Seven board members are appointed by county commissioners (in Denver, the Denver City Council) and four members are appointed by the Governor of Colorado.\n* The Football Stadium District (FD or FTBL), approved by the voters to pay for and help build the [[Denver Broncos]]' stadium [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]]\n* Local Improvement Districts (LID) within designated areas of southeast Jefferson and Boulder counties\n* The Metropolitan Major League Baseball Stadium District, approved by voters to pay for and help build the [[Colorado Rockies]]' stadium [[Coors Field]]\n* Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) taxes at varying rates in Basalt, Carbondale, Glenwood Springs, Gunnison County\n\n===Federal politics===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px\"\n|+ Presidential elections results\n|- style=\"background:lightgrey;\"\n!

Coloradans have elected 17 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 12 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] to the governorship in the last 100 years. In presidential politics, Colorado was considered a reliably Republican state during the post-World War II era, only voting for the Democratic candidate in 1948, 1964, and 1992. However, it became a competitive swing state by the turn of the century, and voted consecutively for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, as well as Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nColorado politics has the contrast of conservative cities such as Colorado Springs and liberal cities such as Boulder and Denver. Democrats are strongest in [[Denver Metropolitan Area|metropolitan Denver]], the college towns of [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] and [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], southern Colorado (including Pueblo), and a few western ski resort counties.

The Silesian is roughly contemporaneous with the late Mississippian Serpukhovian plus the Pennsylvanian.

The southern [[continent]]s remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America\u2013Europe ([[Laurussia]]) along the present line of eastern North America. This continental collision resulted in the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian orogeny]] in Europe, and the [[Alleghenian orogeny]] in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] southwestward as the [[Ouachita Mountains]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In the same time frame, much of present eastern [[Eurasian plate]] welded itself to Europe along the line of the [[Ural Mountains]]. Most of the [[Mesozoic]] supercontinent of Pangea was now assembled, although North China (which would collide in the Latest Carboniferous), and [[South China (continent)|South China]] continents were still separated from [[Laurasia]]. The Late Carboniferous Pangaea was shaped like an \"O.\"\n\nThere were two major oceans in the Carboniferous\u2014[[Panthalassa]] and [[Paleo-Tethys]], which was inside the \"O\" in the Carboniferous Pangaea. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed - [[Rheic Ocean]] (closed by the assembly of [[South America|South]] and [[North America]]), the small, shallow [[Ural Ocean]] (which was closed by the collision of [[Baltica]] and Siberia continents, creating the [[Ural Mountains]]) and [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]] (closed by [[North China (continent)|North China]] collision with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]]/[[Kazakhstania]]).\n\n==Climate==\nAverage global temperatures in the Early Carboniferous Period were high: approximately 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F). However, cooling during the Middle Carboniferous reduced average global temperatures to about 12&nbsp;\u00b0C (54&nbsp;\u00b0F). Lack of growth rings of fossilized trees suggest a lack of seasons of a tropical climate. Glaciations in [[Gondwana]], triggered by Gondwana's southward movement, continued into the [[Permian]] and because of the lack of clear markers and breaks, the deposits of this glacial period are often referred to as [[Permo-Carboniferous]] in age.\n\nThe cooling and drying of the climate led to the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] (CRC) during the late Carboniferous. Tropical rainforests fragmented and then were eventually devastated by climate change.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\"/>\n\n==Rocks and coal==\n[[File:MississippianMarbleUT.JPG|thumb|right|Lower Carboniferous marble in Big Cottonwood Canyon, [[Wasatch Mountains]], [[Utah]].]]\nCarboniferous rocks in Europe and eastern North America largely consist of a repeated sequence of [[limestone]], [[sandstone]], [[shale]] and [[coal]] beds.<ref>Stanley (1999), p 426</ref> In North America, the early Carboniferous is largely marine limestone, which accounts for the division of the Carboniferous into two periods in North American schemes. The Carboniferous coal beds provided much of the fuel for power generation during the [[Industrial Revolution]] and are still of great economic importance.\n\nThe large coal deposits of the Carboniferous may owe their existence primarily to two factors. The first of these is the appearance of [[wood]] tissue and [[bark (botany)|bark]]-bearing trees. The [[evolution]] of the wood fiber [[lignin]] and the bark-sealing, waxy substance [[suberin]] variously opposed decay organisms so effectively that dead materials accumulated long enough to fossilise on a large scale. The second factor was the lower sea levels that occurred during the Carboniferous as compared to the preceding [[Devonian]] period. This promoted the development of extensive lowland [[swamp]]s and [[forest]]s in North America and Europe. Based on a genetic analysis of mushroom fungi, it was proposed that large quantities of [[wood]] were buried during this period because animals and decomposing [[bacteria]] had not yet [[Evolution|evolved]] enzymes that could effectively digest the resistant phenolic lignin polymers and waxy suberin polymers. They suggest that fungi that could break those substances down effectively only became dominant towards the end of the period, making subsequent coal formation much rarer.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Floudas|first1=D.|last2=Binder|first2=M.|last3=Riley|first3=R.|last4=Barry|first4=K.|last5=Blanchette|first5=R.

They had bark to wood ratios of 8 to 1, and even as high as 20 to 1. This compares to modern values less than 1 to 4. This bark, which must have been used as support as well as protection, probably had 38% to 58% lignin. Lignin is insoluble, too large to pass through cell walls, too heterogeneous for specific enzymes, and toxic, so that few organisms other than [[Basidiomycetes]] fungi can degrade it. To oxidize it requires an atmosphere of greater than 5% oxygen, or compounds such as peroxides. It can linger in soil for thousands of years and its toxic breakdown products inhibit decay of other substances.<ref>Robinson, JM. 1990 Lignin, land plants, and fungi: Biological evolution affecting Phanerozoic oxygen balance.

More diverse geology existed elsewhere, of course. Marine life is especially rich in [[crinoids]] and other [[echinodermata|echinoderms]]. [[Brachiopoda|Brachiopods]] were abundant. [[Trilobite]]s became quite uncommon. On land, large and diverse [[plant]] populations existed. Land [[vertebrata|vertebrates]] included large amphibians.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Plants===\n[[File:Meyers b15 s0272b.jpg|thumb|250 px|Etching depicting some of the most significant plants of the Carboniferous.]]\n{{AmCyc Poster|Coal Plants}}\n[[Mississippian age|Early Carboniferous]] land plants, some of which were [[permineralisation|preserved]] in [[coal ball]]s, were very similar to those of the preceding Late [[Devonian]], but new groups also appeared at this time.\n[[File:Lycopsid joggins mcr1.JPG|thumb|left|Ancient ''in situ'' [[w:lycopsid|lycopsid]], probably ''[[w:Sigillaria|Sigillaria]]'', with attached [[w:stigmaria|stigmarian roots]].]]\n[[File:Lycopsid mcr2.jpg|thumb|left|Base of a [[w:lycopsid|lycopsid]] showing connection with bifurcating [[w:Stigmaria|stigmarian]] roots.]]\nThe main Early Carboniferous plants were the [[Equisetales]] (horse-tails), [[Sphenophyllales]] (scrambling plants), [[Lycopodiales]] (club mosses), [[Lepidodendrales]] (scale trees), [[Filicales]] (ferns), [[Medullosales]] (informally included in the \"[[Pteridospermatophyta|seed ferns]]\", an artificial assemblage of a number of early [[gymnosperm]] groups) and the [[Cordaitales]]. These continued to dominate throughout the period, but during [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|late Carboniferous]], several other groups, [[Cycadophyta]] (cycads), the [[Callistophytales]] (another group of \"seed ferns\"), and the [[Voltziales]] (related to and sometimes included under the [[conifers]]), appeared.\n\nThe Carboniferous lycophytes of the order Lepidodendrales, which are cousins (but not ancestors) of the tiny club-moss of today, were huge trees with trunks 30 meters high and up to 1.5 meters in diameter. These included ''[[Lepidodendron]]'' (with its cone called [[Lepidostrobus]]), ''[[Anabathra]]'', ''[[Lepidophloios]]'' and ''[[Sigillaria]]''. The roots of several of these forms are known as [[Stigmaria]]. Unlike present-day trees, their [[secondary growth]] took place in the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]], which also provided stability, instead of the [[xylem]].<ref>[http://www.uni-muenster.de/GeoPalaeontologie/Palaeo/Palbot/ewald1.htm A HISTORY OF PALAEOZOIC FORESTS - Part 2 The Carboniferous coal swamp forests] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920012606/http://www.uni-muenster.de/GeoPalaeontologie/Palaeo/Palbot/ewald1.htm |date=2012-09-20 }}</ref> The [[Cladoxylopsida|Cladoxylopsids]] were large trees, that were ancestors of ferns, first arising in the Carboniferous.<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2010.

Washington, DC</ref>\n\nThe fronds of some Carboniferous ferns are almost identical with those of living species. Probably many species were [[epiphytic]]. Fossil ferns and \"seed ferns\" include ''[[Pecopteris]]'', ''[[Cyclopteris]]'', ''[[Neuropteris]]'', ''[[Alethopteris]]'', and ''[[Sphenopteris]]''; ''[[Megaphyton]]'' and ''[[Caulopteris]]'' were tree ferns.\n\nThe Equisetales included the common giant form ''[[Calamites]]'', with a trunk diameter of 30 to {{convert|60|cm|0|abbr=on}} and a height of up to {{convert|20|m|0|abbr=on}}. ''[[Sphenophyllum]]'' was a slender climbing plant with whorls of leaves, which was probably related both to the calamites and the lycopods.\n\n''[[Cordaites]]'', a tall plant (6 to over 30 meters) with strap-like leaves, was related to the cycads and conifers; the [[catkin]]-like reproductive organs, which bore ovules/seeds, is called ''[[Cardiocarpus]]''. These plants were thought to live in swamps. True coniferous trees (''[[Walchia]]'', of the order Voltziales) appear later in the Carboniferous, and preferred higher drier ground.\n\n===Marine invertebrates===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nIn the oceans the most important [[marine invertebrate]] groups are the [[Foraminifera]], [[Anthozoa|corals]], [[Bryozoa]], [[Ostracoda]], [[brachiopod]]s, [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]], [[hederellid|hederelloids]], [[microconchids]] and [[echinoderm]]s (especially [[crinoid]]s). For the first time foraminifera take a prominent part in the marine faunas. The large spindle-shaped genus ''Fusulina'' and its relatives were abundant in what is now Russia, China, Japan, North America; other important genera include ''Valvulina'', ''Endothyra'', ''Archaediscus'', and ''Saccammina'' (the latter common in Britain and Belgium). Some Carboniferous genera are still [[Extant taxon|extant]].\n\nThe microscopic shells of [[radiolaria]]ns are found in [[chert]]s of this age in the [[Culm Measures|Culm]] of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], and in Russia, Germany and elsewhere. [[Porifera|Sponges]] are known from [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s and anchor ropes, and include various forms such as the Calcispongea ''Cotyliscus'' and ''Girtycoelia'', the [[demosponge]] ''Chaetetes'', and the genus of unusual colonial [[Hyalospongea|glass sponges]] ''[[Titusvillia]]''.\n\nBoth [[reef]]-building and solitary corals diversify and flourish; these include both [[Rugosa|rugose]] (for example, ''[[Caninia (genus)|Caninia]]'', ''Corwenia'', ''Neozaphrentis''), heterocorals, and [[Tabulata|tabulate]] (for example, ''Chladochonus'', ''Michelinia'') forms. [[Conularids]] were well represented by ''Conularia''\n\n[[Bryozoa]] are abundant in some regions; the fenestellids including ''Fenestella'', ''Polypora'', and ''[[Archimedes (bryozoan)|Archimedes]]'', so named because it is in the shape of an [[Archimedean screw]]. [[Brachiopod]]s are also abundant; they include [[Productida|productids]], some of which (for example, ''[[Gigantoproductus]]'') reached very large (for brachiopods) size and had very thick shells, while others like ''[[Chonetes]]'' were more conservative in form. [[Athyridida|Athyridids]], [[Spiriferida|spiriferids]], [[Rhynchonellida|rhynchonellids]], and [[Terebratulida|terebratulids]] are also very common. Inarticulate forms include ''[[Discina (brachiopod)|Discina]]'' and ''[[Crania (genus)|Crania]]''. Some species and genera had a very wide distribution with only minor variations.\n\n[[Annelid]]s such as ''Serpulites'' are common fossils in some horizons. Among the mollusca, the [[bivalve]]s continue to increase in numbers and importance. Typical genera include ''[[Aviculopecten]]'', ''[[Posidonomya]]'', ''[[Nucula]]'', ''[[Carbonicola]]'', ''Edmondia'', and ''Modiola'' [[Gastropod]]s are also numerous, including the genera ''Murchisonia'', ''[[Euomphalus]]'', ''Naticopsis''. [[Nautiloid]] [[cephalopod]]s are represented by tightly coiled [[Nautilida|nautilids]], with straight-shelled and curved-shelled forms becoming increasingly rare. [[Goniatite]] [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]] are common.\n\n[[Trilobite]]s are rarer than in previous periods, on a steady trend towards extinction, represented only by the proetid group. [[Ostracod]]a, a class of [[crustacean]]s, were abundant as representatives of the [[meiobenthos]]; genera included ''Amphissites'', ''Bairdia'', ''Beyrichiopsis'', ''Cavellina'', ''Coryellina'', ''Cribroconcha'', ''Hollinella'', ''Kirkbya'', ''Knoxiella'', and ''Libumella''.\n\nAmongst the [[echinoderm]]s, the [[crinoid]]s were the most numerous. Dense submarine thickets of long-stemmed crinoids appear to have flourished in shallow seas, and their remains were consolidated into thick beds of rock. Prominent genera include ''Cyathocrinus'', ''Woodocrinus'', and ''Actinocrinus''. Echinoids such as ''[[Archaeocidaris]]'' and ''Palaeechinus'' were also present. The [[blastoid]]s, which included the Pentreinitidae and Codasteridae and superficially resembled crinoids in the possession of long stalks attached to the seabed, attain their maximum development at this time.\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nImage:Aviculopecten subcardiformis01.JPG|''Aviculopecten subcardiformis''; a [[bivalve]] from the [[Logan Formation]] (Lower Carboniferous) of [[Wooster, Ohio]] (external mold).\nImage:LoganFauna011312.jpg|Bivalves (''Aviculopecten'') and brachiopods (''Syringothyris'') in the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) in Wooster, Ohio.\nImage:Syringothyris01.JPG|''Syringothyris'' sp.; a spiriferid [[brachiopod]] from the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) of Wooster, Ohio (internal mold).\nImage:Palaeophycus01.JPG|''Palaeophycus'' ichnosp.; a [[trace fossil]] from the Logan Formation (Lower Carboniferous) of Wooster, Ohio.\nImage:PlatyceratidMississippian.JPG|[[Crinoid]] calyx from the Lower Carboniferous of Ohio with a conical [[Platyceratidae|platyceratid]] gastropod (''Palaeocapulus acutirostre'') attached.\nImage:Conulariid03.jpg|Conulariid from the Lower Carboniferous of Indiana.\nImage:Syringoporid.jpg|Tabulate coral (a syringoporid); Boone Limestone (Lower Carboniferous) near Hiwasse, Arkansas.\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n===Freshwater and lagoonal invertebrates===\nFreshwater Carboniferous invertebrates include various [[bivalve]] [[mollusc]]s that lived in brackish or fresh water, such as ''[[Anthraconaia]]'', ''[[Naiadites]]'', and ''[[Carbonicola]]''; diverse [[crustacean]]s such as ''[[Candona]]'', ''[[Carbonita (genus)|Carbonita]]'', ''[[Darwinula]]'', ''[[Estheria (crustacean)|Estheria]]'', ''[[Acanthocaris]]'', ''[[Dithyrocaris]]'', and ''[[Anthrapalaemon]]''.\n\n[[File:Megarachne BW.jpg|thumb|The upper Carboniferous giant spider-like eurypterid ''[[Megarachne]]'' grew to legspans of {{convert|50|cm|0|abbr=on}}.]]\nThe [[Eurypterid]]s were also diverse, and are represented by such genera as   ''[[Anthraconectes]]'', ''[[Megarachne]]'' (originally misinterpreted as a giant spider, hence its name) and the specialised very large ''[[Hibbertopterus]]''. Many of these were amphibious.\n\nFrequently a temporary return of marine conditions resulted in marine or brackish water genera such as ''[[Lingula (genus)|Lingula]]'', [[Orbiculoidea]], and ''[[Productus]]'' being found in the thin beds known as marine bands.\n\n===Terrestrial invertebrates===\nFossil remains of air-breathing [[insect]]s,<ref name=\"Archi\">{{cite journal|title=X-ray micro-tomography of Carboniferous stem-Dictyoptera: New insights into early insects|first=Russell J.|last=Garwood|first2=Mark D.|last2=Sutton|year=2010|journal=Biology Letters|volume=6|pages=699\u2013702|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/5/699.abstract|accessdate=June 9, 2015|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2010.0199|pmid=20392720|pmc=2936155|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809000236/http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/5/699.abstract|archivedate=August 9, 2016|df=}}</ref> [[myriapod]]s and [[arachnid]]s<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Russell Garwood |author2=Jason A.

These included some, like ''[[Psammodus]]'', with crushing pavement-like teeth adapted for grinding the shells of brachiopods, crustaceans, and other marine organisms. Other sharks had piercing teeth, such as the [[Symmoriida]]; some, the [[petalodont]]s, had peculiar cycloid cutting teeth. Most of the sharks were marine, but the [[Xenacanthida]] invaded fresh waters of the coal swamps. Among the [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the [[Palaeonisciformes]] found in coastal waters also appear to have migrated to rivers.

These had long bodies, a head covered with bony plates and generally weak or undeveloped limbs. The largest were over 2 meters long. They were accompanied by an assemblage of smaller amphibians included under the [[Lepospondyli]], often only about {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} long. Some Carboniferous amphibians were aquatic and lived in rivers (''[[Loxomma]]'', ''[[Eogyrinus]]'', ''[[Proterogyrinus]]''); others may have been semi-aquatic (''[[Ophiderpeton]]'', ''[[Amphibamus]]'', ''[[Hyloplesion]]'') or terrestrial (''[[Dendrerpeton]]'', ''[[Tuditanus]]'', ''[[Anthracosaurus]]'').\n\nThe [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]] slowed the evolution of amphibians who could not survive as well in the cooler, drier conditions. Reptiles, however, prospered due to specific key adaptations.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\"/> One of the greatest evolutionary innovations of the Carboniferous was the [[amniote]] egg, which allowed the laying of eggs in a dry environment, allowing for the further exploitation of the land by certain [[tetrapod]]s. These included the earliest [[Sauropsida|sauropsid]] reptiles (''[[Hylonomus]]''), and the earliest known [[synapsid]] (''[[Archaeothyris]]''). These small lizard-like animals quickly gave rise to many descendants, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s.\n\nReptiles underwent a major evolutionary radiation in response to the drier climate that preceded the rainforest collapse.<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse\"/><ref name=Kazlev>M.

The islands are officially known by their Comorian language names, though international sources still use their French names (given in parentheses above). The capital and largest city, [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]], is located on Ngazidja. The archipelago is situated in the Indian Ocean, in the [[Mozambique Channel]], between the African coast (nearest to [[Mozambique]] and [[Tanzania]]) and [[Madagascar]], with no land borders.\n\nAt {{convert|2034|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, it is one of the smallest countries in the world. The Comoros also has claim to {{convert|320|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of territorial seas. The interiors of the islands vary from steep mountains to low hills.\n\nNgazidja is the largest of the Comoros Archipelago, approximately equal in area to the other islands combined. It is also the most recent island, and therefore has rocky soil. The island's two volcanoes, [[Mount Karthala|Karthala]] (active) and [[La Grille]] (dormant), and the lack of good harbours are distinctive characteristics of its terrain. Mwali, with its capital at [[Fomboni]], is the smallest of the four major islands. Nzwani, whose capital is [[Mutsamudu]], has a distinctive triangular shape caused by three mountain chains \u2013 [[Sima, Comoros|Sima]], [[Nioumak\u00e9l\u00e9]] and [[Jimilim\u00e9]] \u2013 emanating from a central peak, Mount [[N'Tingui]] ({{convert|1575|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}).\n\nThe islands of the Comoros Archipelago were formed by volcanic activity. Mount Karthala, an active [[shield volcano]] located on Ngazidja, is the country's highest point, at {{convert|2,361|m|abbr=off}}. It contains the Comoros' largest patch of disappearing rainforest. Karthala is currently one of the most active volcanoes in the world, with a minor eruption in May 2006, and prior eruptions as recently as April 2005 and 1991. In the 2005 eruption, which lasted from 17 to 19 April, 40,000 citizens were evacuated, and the [[crater lake]] in the volcano's {{convert|3|by|4|km|mi|abbr=off}} [[caldera]] was destroyed.\n\nThe Comoros also lays claim to the [[Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean|''\u00celes \u00c9parses'' or ''\u00celes \u00e9parses de l'oc\u00e9an indien'']] (Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean) \u2013 [[Glorioso Islands]], comprising [[Grande Glorieuse]], [[\u00cele du Lys]], [[Wreck Rock]], [[South Rock]], [[Verte Rocks]] (three islets) and three unnamed islets \u2013 one of France's overseas districts. The Glorioso Islands were administered by the colonial Comoros before 1975, and are therefore sometimes considered part of the Comoros Archipelago. [[Banc du Geyser]], a former island in the Comoros Archipelago, now submerged, is geographically located in the ''\u00celes \u00c9parses'', but was annexed by [[Madagascar]] in 1976 as an unclaimed territory. The Comoros and France each still view the Banc du Geyser as part of the Glorioso Islands and, thus, part of its particular exclusive economic zone.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Moroni, Comoros#Geography and climate}}\n\nThe climate is generally tropical and mild, and the two major seasons are distinguishable by their raininess. The temperature reaches an average of {{convert|29|-|30|C|F}} in March, the hottest month in the rainy season (called kashkazi/kaskazi [meaning north monsoon], which runs from December to April), and an average low of {{convert|19|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in the cool, dry season (kusi (meaning south monsoon), which proceeds from May to November).<ref>[[#Ottenheimer|Ottenheimer]], pp. 20, 72</ref> The islands are rarely subject to [[cyclone]]s.\n\n=== Ecology and environment ===\n{{See also|Moheli Marine Park}}\nThe Comoros constitute an [[ecoregion]] in their own right, [[Comoros forests]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n== Government ==\n{{Main|Politics of the Comoros}}\n[[File:Moroni Capital of the Comores Photo by Sascha Grabow.jpg|thumb|[[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]], capital of the Comoros, with Harbor Bay and Central Mosque]]\n\nPolitics of the Comoros takes place in a framework of a [[Federation|federal]] [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of the Comoros]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]].

These declines are explained by factors including declining investment, drops in consumption, rising inflation, and an increase in trade imbalance due in part to lowered cash crop prices, especially vanilla.<ref name=\"Office of the General Commissioner for Planning, Ministry of Planning and Regional Development\" />\n\nFiscal policy is constrained by erratic fiscal revenues, a bloated civil service wage bill, and an external debt that is far above the [[Heavily indebted poor countries|HIPC]] threshold.

It is a language related to [[Swahili language|Swahili]], with four different variants (Shingazidja, Shimwali, Shinzwani and Shimaore) being spoken on each of the four islands. [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Latin script|Latin]] scripts are both used, Arabic being the more widely used, and an [[Official script|official orthography]] has recently been developed for the Latin script.<ref name=chamanga>{{cite book|author= Mohamed Ahmed-Chamanga |title= Introduction \u00e0 la grammaire structurale du comorien|place= Moroni|publisher= Komedit|year=2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[French language|French]] are also official languages, along with Comorian.

Here, boys and girls are taught about the [[Qur'an]], and memorise it. Some parents specifically choose this early schooling to offset French schools children usually attend later. Since independence and the ejection of French teachers, the education system has been plagued by poor teacher training and poor results, though recent stability may allow for substantial improvements.<ref name=\"Bakar:181-191\" />{{Better source|reason=Source is a decades-old book, but this purports to describe the current situation.|date=September 2018}}\n\nPre-colonization education systems in Comoros focused on necessary skills such as agriculture, caring for livestock and completing household tasks. Religious education also taught children the virtues of Islam. The education system underwent a transformation during colonization in the early 1900s which brought secular education based on the French system. This was mainly for children of the elite. After Comoros gained independence in 1975, the education system changed again. Funding for teachers' salaries was lost, and many went on strike. Thus, the public education system was not functioning between 1997 and 2001. Since gaining independence, the education system has also undergone a democratization and options exist for those other than the elite. Enrollment has also grown.\n\nIn 2000, 44.2% of children ages 5 to 14 years were attending school. There is a general lack of facilities, equipment, qualified teachers, textbooks and other resources. [[Salaries]] for teachers are often so far in arrears that many refuse to work.<ref name=ilab>\"Comoros\".

The little marriage is a simple legal marriage. It is small, intimate, and inexpensive. The bride price is nominal. The little marriage, however, is just a placeholder until the couple can afford the ''ada'', or grand marriage. The hallmarks of the grand marriage are dazzling gold jewelry, two weeks of celebration and an enormous bride price. The groom must pay most of the expenses for this event, and the bride's family typically pays only a third of that of the groom's. The grand wedding can cost up to \u00a355,000.{{Dubious|date=June 2018}} Many men cannot afford this until their late 40's, if ever.\n\nThe grand marriage is a symbol of social status on the Comoros islands. The completion of an ''ada'' marriage also greatly increases a man's standing in the Comoran hierarchy. A Comoran man can only wear certain elements of the national dress or stand in the first line at the mosque if he has had a grand marriage. Also, one is not fully considered a man until he has had an ''ada'' marriage.\n\nThe continuation of the grand marriage tradition is criticized because of its great expense and Comoros's intense poverty.\n<ref name=\"Two Marriage Forms in the Comoro Islands: An Investigation\">[http://search.proquest.com/docview/1298706914] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Kinship and social structure ===\n[[File:JOUR DE L'A\u00cfDE DHUL HAJJ BANGOI-KOUNI.jpg|thumb|Comorians]]\nComorian society has a [[bilateral descent]] system. Lineage membership and inheritance of immovable goods (land, housing) is matrilineal, passed in the maternal line, similar to many [[Bantu peoples]] who are also matrilineal, while other goods and patronymics are passed in the male line.

The basic task of philosophers, according to this view, is not to establish and demonstrate theories about reality, but rather to subject all theories\u2014including those about philosophy itself\u2014to critical review, and measure their validity by how well they withstand criticism.\n\n\"Critical philosophy\" is also used as another name for Kant's philosophy itself. Kant said that philosophy's proper enquiry is not about what is out there in reality, but rather about the character and foundations of experience itself. We must first judge how human reason works, and within what limits, so that we can afterwards correctly apply it to [[empirical evidence|sense experience]] and determine whether it can be applied at all to metaphysical objects.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Critical idealism]]\n*[[Critical theory]]\n*[[Charles Bernard Renouvier]]\n*[[L\u00e9on Brunschvicg]]\n\n==References==\n* ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'': [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/ Immanuel Kant]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Critical Philosophy}}\n[[Category:Kantianism]]\n[[Category:Immanuel Kant]]\n\n\n{{philo-stub}}", "sha1": "evy8t6bfmi8zjxdduh5x9jgwij8lsh4"}}, {"title": "China", "ns": "0", "id": "5405", "revision": {"id": "866744829", "parentid": "866528745", "timestamp": "2018-11-01T08:26:23Z", "contributor": {"username": "Eliyili00", "id": "28833065"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* People's Republic of China (1949\u2013present) */ deleted redundant word", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the People's Republic of China|the Republic of China|Taiwan|other uses}}\n{{redirect|PRC||PRC (disambiguation)}}\n{{pp-semi-protected|small=yes}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{short description|State in East Asia}}\n{{good article}}\n{{Use American English|date=August 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox country\n| conventional_long_name = People's Republic of China\n| common_name = China\n| native_name = {{ubl|{{native name|zh|\u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd|italics=off}}|''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3'' {{small|([[Pinyin]])}}}}<!--Please do not add official regional/minority languages here;

Five metals among them, Pb, Cr, As, Cd, and Hg, are the key heavy metal pollutants in China. Heavy metal pollutants mainly come from mining, sewage irrigation, the manufacturing of metal-containing products, and other related production activities. High level of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities, including reading and learning disabilities, behavioral problems, hearing loss, attention problems, and disruption in the development of visual and motor function. According to the data of a national census of pollution, China has more than 1.5 million sites of heavy metals exposure.

The lightly populated and arid lower region of old Baja California remained as a part of [[Mexico]]. In 1846, the total settler population of the western part of the old Alta California had been estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans, down from about 300,000 before Hispanic settlement in 1769.<ref name=\"Osborne2012\">{{cite book|first=Thomas J. |last=Osborne|title=Pacific Eldorado: A History of Greater California|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=FvA3jL4CFCMC}}|date=November 29, 2012|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-29217-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1848, only one week before the official American annexation of the area, gold was discovered in California, this being an event which was to forever alter both the state's demographics and its finances.  Soon afterward, a massive influx of immigration into the area resulted, as prospectors and miners arrived by the thousands.  The population burgeoned with United States citizens, Europeans, Chinese and other immigrants during the great [[California Gold Rush]].

On September 9, 1850, as part of the [[Compromise of 1850]], California was officially admitted into the United States as an undivided [[Free state (USA)|free state]].  Its status as a 'free state' prevented the expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] to the Pacific Coast, which was a foremost concern for the pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] US Congress. Within the state of California, Sep 9 remains as an annually celebrated legal holiday known as [[California Admission Day]].\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), California was able to send gold shipments eastwards to Washington in support of the [[California in the American Civil War|Union cause]];<ref>[https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/10-facts-california-during-civil-war 10 Facts: California during the Civil War] Civil War Trust. Downloaded September 9, 2017.</ref> however, due to the existence of a large contingent of pro-South sympathizers within the state, the state was not able to muster any full military regiments to send eastwards to officially serve in the Union war effort.  Still, several smaller military units within the Union army were unofficially associated with the state of California, such as the [[2nd Regiment of Cavalry, Massachusetts Volunteers|\"California 100 Company\"]], due to a majority of their members being from California.\n\nAt the time of California's admission into the Union, travel between California and the rest of the continental United States had been a time consuming and dangerous feat.  Nineteen years afterwards, in 1869, shortly after the conclusion of the Civil War,   a more direct connection was developed with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. California was then easy to reach.\n\nMuch of the state was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general. Vast expanses of wheat, other cereal crops, vegetable crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state's prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere.\n\n==== Indigenous peoples under early American administration ====\n[[File:Yokayo-People-at-Ukiah-California-1916.JPG|thumb|right|Group of [[Indigenous peoples of California|California indigenous people]].]]\nUnder earlier Spanish and Mexican rule, California's original native population had precipitously declined, above all, from Eurasian diseases to which the indigenous people of California had not yet developed a natural immunity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=1617|title=Destruction of the California Indians|publisher=[[California Secretary of State]]|accessdate=April 15, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207115225/http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=1617|archivedate=December 7, 2011}}</ref> Under its new American administration, California's harsh governmental policies towards its own indigenous people did not improve.  As in other American states, many of the native inhabitants were soon forcibly removed from their lands by incoming American settlers such as miners, ranchers, and farmers.

The Central Valley is California's productive agricultural heartland.\n\nDivided in two by the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta]], the northern portion, the [[Sacramento Valley]] serves as the watershed of the [[Sacramento River]], while the southern portion, the [[San Joaquin Valley]] is the watershed for the [[San Joaquin River]]. Both valleys derive their names from the rivers that flow through them. With dredging, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained deep enough for several inland cities to be [[seaport]]s.\n\nThe Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a critical water supply hub for the state. Water is diverted from the delta and through an extensive network of [[pump (Water)|pumps]] and canals that traverse nearly the length of the state, to the Central Valley and the State Water Projects and other needs. Water from the Delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people, almost two-thirds of the state's population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley.\n\n[[Suisun Bay]] lies at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

Indeed, almost all of southeastern California is arid, hot desert, with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer. The southeastern border of California with Arizona is entirely formed by the [[Colorado River]], from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water.\n\nA majority of California's cities are located in either the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] or the [[Sacramento metropolitan area]] in [[Northern California]]; or the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Los Angeles area]], the [[Inland Empire|Riverside-San Bernardino-Inland Empire]], or the [[San Diego metropolitan area]] in [[Southern California]].

The cool [[California Current]] offshore often creates summer [[fog]] near the coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers. The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent. Even the [[San Diego]] shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees [[Climate of the Los Angeles Basin|warmer]] than at the coast. The same [[microclimate]] phenomenon is seen in the [[San Francisco Bay Area#Climate|climate]] of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas that are close to the ocean.\n\nNorthern parts of the state have more rain than the south. California's mountain ranges also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a [[temperate climate]], and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], have an [[alpine climate]] with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.\n\nCalifornia's mountains produce [[rain shadow]]s on the eastern side, creating extensive [[desert]]s. The higher elevation deserts of [[eastern California]] have hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters.

The state's coasts, rivers, and other bodies of water are regulated by the [[California Coastal Commission]].\n\nThe two most prominent rivers within California are the [[Sacramento River]] and the [[San Joaquin River]], which drain the Central Valley and the west slope of the Sierra Nevada and flow to the Pacific Ocean through [[San Francisco Bay]]. Several major tributaries feed into the Sacramento and the San Joaquin, including the [[Pit River]], the [[Tuolumne River]], and the [[Feather River]].\n\nThe [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]] and [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]] each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively, and the Eel River is the largest river in the state to remain in its natural un-dammed state. The [[Mojave River]] is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the [[Santa Ana River]] drains much of the [[Transverse Ranges]] as it bisects Southern California. Some other important rivers are the [[Klamath River]] and the [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity River]] in the far north coast, and the [[Colorado River]] on the southeast border with [[Arizona]].\n\n===Regions===\n{{further|List of regions of California|List of places in California}}\n{{Columns |width=300px\n|col1=\n* '''[[Coastal California]]'''\n** [[North Coast (California)|North Coast]]\n** [[San Francisco Bay Area|Greater Bay Area]]\n** [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast]]\n** [[South Coast (California)|South Coast]]\n*** [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Greater Los Angeles]]\n*** [[San Diego metropolitan area|Greater San Diego]]\n** [[Channel Islands (California)|Channel Islands]]\n* '''[[Northern California]]'''\n** [[Cascade Range]]\n** [[Klamath Mountains]]\n** [[North Coast (California)|North Coast]]\n** [[Sacramento metropolitan area|Greater Sacramento]]\n** [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta]]\n** [[Central California]]\n** [[San Francisco Bay Area|Greater Bay Area]]\n** [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Northern Sierra]]\n|col2=\n* '''[[Central Valley (California)|Central California]]'''\n** [[Sacramento metropolitan area|Greater Sacramento]]\n** [[San Joaquin Valley]]\n** [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta]]\n** [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast]]\n* '''[[Eastern California]]'''\n** [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Central Sierra]]\n** [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]]\n* '''[[Southern California]]'''\n** [[South Coast (California)|South Coast]]\n*** [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Greater Los Angeles]]\n** [[Channel Islands (California)|Channel Islands]]\n** [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]]\n** [[Southern Border Region (California)|Southern Border Region]]\n*** [[San Diego\u2013Tijuana|Greater San Diego\u2013Tijuana]]\n*** [[Imperial County, California|Greater El Centro]]\n}}\n\n==Demography==\n{{Main|Demography of California}}\n<!-- This section has a history of {{Disputed|date=December 2008}} and {{contradict-section}} tags.

Voters also passed [[California Proposition 71 (2004)|Proposition 71 in 2004]] to fund [[stem cell]] research, and [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|Proposition 14 in 2010]] to completely change the state's [[primary election]] process. California has also experienced [[California Water Wars|disputes over water rights]]; and a [[tax revolt]], culminating with the passage of [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13 in 1978]], limiting state [[property tax]]es.\n\nThe state's trend towards the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and away from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] can be seen in state elections. From 1899 to 1939, California had Republican governors. Since 1990, California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal, state and local offices, including current Governor [[Jerry Brown]]; however, the state has elected Republican Governors, though many of its Republican Governors, such as [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], tend to be considered moderate Republicans and more [[Centrism|centrist]] than the national party.\n\nThe Democrats also now hold a majority in both houses of the state legislature. There are 56 Democrats and 24 Republicans in the Assembly; and 26 Democrats and 12 Republicans in the Senate.\n\nThe trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections. From 1960 to 1988, California was a Republican stronghold, with the party carrying the state's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] in every election except for 1964. California Republicans [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] were elected as the 37th and the 40th U.S. Presidents, respectively. However, Democrats have won all of California's electoral votes since 1992.\n\nIn the United States House, the Democrats held a 34\u201319 edge in the CA delegation of the [[110th United States Congress]] in 2007. As the result of [[gerrymandering]], the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained 4 seats and held a 38\u201315 majority in the delegation.\n\n[[File:United States presidential election in California, 2016.svg|thumb|right|[[Treemap]] of the popular vote by county, 2016 presidential election.]]\nIn general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous [[Coastal California|coastal regions]] of the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] also remains mostly Republican.

It flows northwest and then south into the US state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of [[Oregon]] before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. The river is {{convert|1243|mi|km}} long, and its largest [[tributary]] is the [[Snake River]]. Its [[drainage basin]] is roughly the size of France and extends into seven US states and a Canadian province. The fourth-largest river in the United States by volume, the Columbia has the greatest [[River flow|flow]] of any North American river entering the Pacific.\n\nThe Columbia and its tributaries have been central to the region's culture and economy for thousands of years. They have been used for transportation since ancient times, linking the region's many cultural groups. The river system hosts many species of [[anadromous]] fish, which [[fish migration|migrate]] between [[freshwater]] habitats and the [[saline water|saline]] waters of the Pacific Ocean. These fish\u2014especially the [[salmon]] species\u2014provided the core subsistence for [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|native peoples]].\n\nIn the late 18th century, a private American ship became the first non-indigenous vessel to enter the river; it was followed by a British explorer, who navigated past the [[Oregon Coast Range]] into the [[Willamette Valley]]. In the following decades, [[fur trade|fur trading]] companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route. Overland explorers entered the Willamette Valley through the scenic but treacherous [[Columbia River Gorge]], and [[Oregon Country|pioneers]] began to settle the valley in increasing numbers. [[Steamship]]s along the river linked communities and facilitated trade; the [[History of rail transport in the United States#Expansion and consolidation (1878\u20131916)|arrival of railroads]] in the late 19th century, many running along the river, supplemented these links.\n\nSince the late 19th century, [[public sector|public]] and [[private sector]]s have heavily developed the river. To aid ship and barge navigation, [[lock (water transport)|locks]] have been built along the lower Columbia and its tributaries, and [[dredging]] has opened, maintained, and enlarged [[Nautical channel|shipping channels]]. Since the early 20th century, dams have been built across the river for power generation, navigation, [[irrigation]], and flood control. The [[list of dams in the Columbia River watershed|14 hydroelectric dams]] on the Columbia's [[main stem]] and many more on its tributaries produce more than 44&nbsp;percent of total US [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric generation]]. Production of [[nuclear power]] has taken place at two sites along the river. Plutonium for [[nuclear weapon]]s was produced for decades at the [[Hanford Site]], which is now the [[National Priorities List|most contaminated nuclear site]] in the US. These developments have greatly altered river environments in the watershed, mainly through industrial pollution and barriers to fish migration.\n\n== Course ==\nThe Columbia begins its {{convert|1243|mi|km|adj=on}} journey in the southern [[Rocky Mountain Trench]] in British Columbia (BC). [[Columbia Lake]]&nbsp;\u2013 {{convert|2690|ft|m|}} above [[sea level]]&nbsp;\u2013 and the adjoining [[Columbia Wetlands]] form the river's [[river source|headwaters]]. The trench is a broad, deep, and long [[glacial valley]] between the [[Canadian Rockies]] and the [[Columbia Mountains]] in BC. For its first {{convert|200|mi|km|}}, the Columbia flows northwest along the trench through [[Windermere Lake (British Columbia)|Windermere Lake]] and the town of [[Invermere, British Columbia|Invermere]], a region known in British Columbia as the [[Columbia Valley]], then northwest to [[Golden, British Columbia|Golden]] and into [[Kinbasket Lake]]. Rounding the northern end of the [[Selkirk Mountains]], the river turns sharply south through a region known as the [[Big Bend Country]], passing through [[Revelstoke Lake]] and the [[Arrow Lakes]]. Revelstoke, the Big Bend, and the Columbia Valley combined are referred to in BC parlance as the [[Columbia Country]]. Below the Arrow Lakes, the Columbia passes the cities of [[Castlegar, British Columbia|Castlegar]], located at the Columbia's [[confluence]] with the [[Kootenay River]], and [[Trail, British Columbia|Trail]], two major population centers of the [[West Kootenay]] region.

After crossing the [[Rocky Mountains]], Lewis and Clark built [[dugout canoe]]s and paddled down the Snake River, reaching the Columbia near the present-day Tri-Cities, Washington. They explored a few miles upriver, as far as [[Bateman Island]], before heading down the Columbia, concluding their journey at the river's mouth and establishing [[Fort Clatsop]], a short-lived establishment that was occupied for less than three months.{{sfn|Hayes|1999a|nopp=}}\n\nCanadian explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], of the [[North West Company]], spent the winter of 1807\u201308 at [[Kootanae House]] near the source of the Columbia at present-day Invermere, British Columbia.

By 1828, when the so-called \"joint occupation\" was renewed for an indefinite period, it seemed probable that the lower Columbia River would in time become the border. For years the Hudson's Bay Company successfully maintained control of the Columbia River and American attempts to gain a foothold were fended off. In the 1830s, American religious missions were established at several locations in the lower Columbia River region. In the 1840s a mass migration of American settlers undermined British control. The Hudson's Bay Company tried to maintain dominance by shifting from the fur trade, which was in sharp decline, to exporting other goods such as salmon and lumber. Colonization schemes were attempted, but failed to match the scale of American settlement. Americans generally settled south of the Columbia, mainly in the Willamette Valley. The Hudson's Bay Company tried to establish settlements north of the river, but nearly all the British colonists moved south to the Willamette Valley. The hope that the British colonists might dilute the American flavor of the valley failed in the face of the overwhelming number of American settlers. These developments rekindled the issue of \"joint occupation\" and the [[Oregon boundary dispute|boundary dispute]]. While some British interests, especially the Hudson's Bay Company, fought for a boundary along the Columbia River, the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846 set the boundary at the 49th&nbsp;parallel.

The four largest that empty directly into the Columbia (measured either by [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] or by size of watershed) are the Snake River (mostly in Idaho), the Willamette River (in northwest Oregon), the Kootenay River (mostly in British Columbia), and the Pend Oreille River (mostly in northern Washington and Idaho, also known as the lower part of the Clark Fork). Each of these four averages more than {{convert|20000|cuft/s|m3/s}} and drains an area of more than {{convert|20000|mi2|km2}}.\n\nThe Snake is by far the largest tributary. Its watershed of {{convert|108000|mi2|km2}} is larger than the state of Idaho. Its discharge is roughly a third of the Columbia's at the rivers' confluence but compared to the Columbia upstream of the confluence the Snake is longer (113%) and has a larger drainage basin (104%).\n\nThe Pend Oreille River system (including its main tributaries, the Clark Fork and Flathead rivers) is also similar in size to the Columbia at their confluence. Compared to the Columbia River above the two rivers' confluence, the Pend Oreille-Clark-Flathead is nearly as long (about 86%), its basin about three-fourths as large (76%), and its discharge over a

It comprises five families: [[Commelinaceae]], [[Haemodoraceae]], [[Hanguanaceae]], [[Philydraceae]], and [[Pontederiaceae]]. All the families combined contain over 885 species in about 70 [[Genus|genera]]; the majority of species are in the [[Commelinaceae]]. Plants in the order share a number of [[Synapomorphy|synapomorphies]] that tie them together, such as a lack of [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal associations]] and [[tapetum (botany)|tapetal]] [[raphides]]. Estimates differ as to when the Comminales evolved, but most suggest an origin and diversification sometime during the mid- to late [[Cretaceous]]. Depending on the methods used, studies suggest a range of origin between 123 and 73 million years, with diversification occurring within the group 110 to 66 million years ago. The order's closest relatives are in the [[Zingiberales]], which includes [[ginger]], [[banana]]s, [[cardamom]], and others.<ref>Stevens, P. F. (2001 onwards). Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. Version 9, November 2011.</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe older [[Cronquist system]] of 1981, which was based purely on morphological data, placed the order in subclass [[Commelinidae]] of class [[Liliopsida]] and included the families [[Commelinaceae]], [[Mayacaceae]], [[Rapateaceae]] and [[Xyridaceae]]. These families are now known to be only distantly related.<ref name=APGII2003/><ref name=APGIII2009/>\nIn the classification system of [[Rolf Dahlgren|Dahlgren]] the Commelinales were one of four orders in the [[superorder]] Commeliniflorae (also called Commelinanae), and contained five families, of which only Commelinaceae has been retained by the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] (APG).\n\nAccording to the most recent classification scheme, the [[APG IV system|APG IV]] of 2016, the order includes five families:<ref name=APGIV2016/>\n* [[Commelinaceae]]\n* [[Haemodoraceae]]\n* [[Hanguanaceae]]\n* [[Philydraceae]]\n* [[Pontederiaceae]]\n\nThis is unchanged from the [[APG III system|APG III]] of 2009 and the [[APG II system|APG II]] of 2003, but different from the older [[APG system]] of 1998, which did not include [[Hanguanaceae]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=APGII2003>The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. 2003 ''An update  of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG II.''

Although not known with certainty the total number of species in the order, conservative estimates indicate about 2600 species worldwide, distributed in 109 genera.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Compared to other flowering plant orders, the taxonomy is poorly understood due to their great diversity, difficulty in identification, and limited study.\n\nThe order Cucurbitales in the eurosid I clade comprises almost 2600 species in 109 or 110 genera in eight families, tropical and temperate, of very different sizes, morphology, and ecology.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> It is a case of [[divergent evolution]]. In contrast, there is [[convergent evolution]] with other groups not related due to ecological or physical drivers toward a similar solution,  including [[analogous structures]].\nSome species are trees that have similar foliage to the [[Lauraceae|true laurels]] due to convergent evolution.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nThe patterns of speciation in the Cucurbitales are diversified in a high number of species. They have a pantropical distribution with centers of diversity in Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. They most likely originated in West [[Gondwana]] 67\u2013107 million years ago, so the oldest split could relate to the break-up of Gondwana in the middle Eocene to late Oligocene, 45\u201324 million years ago. The group reached their current distribution by multiple intercontinental dispersal events. One factor was product of aridification, other groups responded to favorable climatic periods and expanded across the available habitat, occurring as opportunistic species across wide distribution; other groups diverged over long periods within isolated areas.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nThe Cucurbitales comprise the families: [[Apodanthaceae]], [[Anisophylleaceae]], [[Begoniaceae]], [[Coriariaceae]], [[Corynocarpaceae]], [[Cucurbitaceae]], [[Tetramelaceae]], and [[Datiscaceae]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sib.gov.ar/taxonomia/orden/cucurbitales |title=Taxonom\u00eda Cucurbitales |publisher=SIB |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> Some of the synapomorphies of the order are: leaves in spiral with secondary veins palmated, calyx or perianth valvate, and the elevated stomatal calyx/perianth bearing separate styles.

The genus ''[[Dendrosicyos]]'', with the only species being the cucumber tree, is adapted to the arid semidesert island of [[Socotra]]. Deciduous perennial Cucurbitales lose all of their [[leaves]] for part of the year depending on variations in rainfall. The leaf loss coincides with the [[dry season]] in tropical, subtropical and arid regions. In [[temperate]] or [[polar climate]]s, the dry season is due to the inability of the plant to absorb water available in the form of ice. [[Apodanthaceae]] are obligatory endoparasites that only emerge once a year in the form of small flowers that develop into small berries, however taxonomists have not agreed on the exact placement of this family within the Cucurbitales.\nOver half of the known members of this order belong to the greatly diverse begonia family Begoniaceae, with around 1500 species in two genera. Before modern DNA-molecular classifications, some Cucurbitales species were assigned to orders as diverse as [[Ranunculales]], [[Malpighiales]], [[Violales]], and [[Rafflesiales]]. Early molecular studies revealed several surprises, such as the nonmonophyly of the traditional [[Datiscaceae]], including ''[[Tetrameles]]'' and ''[[Octomeles]]'', but the exact relationships among the families remain unclear.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\nThe lack of knowledge about the order in general is due to many species being found in countries with limited economic means or unstable political environments, factors unsuitable for plant collection and detailed study. Thus the vast majority of species remain poorly determined, and a future increase in the number of species is expected.\n\n==Classification==\nUnder the [[Cronquist system]], the families [[Begoniaceae]], [[Cucurbitaceae]], and [[Datiscaceae]] were placed in the order [[Violales]], within the subclass Dilleniidae, with the Tetramelaceae subsumed into the Datiscaceae. [[Corynocarpaceae]] was placed in order [[Celastrales]], and [[Anisophylleaceae]] in order [[Rosales]], both under subclass Rosidae. [[Coriariaceae]] was placed in [[Ranunculaceae]], subclass Magnoliidae. [[Apodanthaceae]] was not recognised as a family, its genera being assigned to another parasitic plant family, the [[Rafflesiaceae]]. The present classification is due to [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group|APG III (2009)]].\n\n==Systematics==\nModern [[molecular phylogenetics]] suggest the following relationships:<ref name=\"Matthews\"/><ref name=autogenerated1/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Zhang L-B)), Simmons MP, Kocyan A, Renner SS | year = 2006 | title = Phylogeny of the Cucurbitales based on DNA sequences of nine loci from three genomes: Implications for morphological and sexual system evolution | journal = [[Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution]] | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 305\u2013322 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790305003209 | archive-url = http://www.umsl.edu/~renners/Zhang_Cucurbitales_MPE2006.pdf | archive-date = 27 February 2017 | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2005.10.002 | pmid = 16293423}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Soltis DE, Gitzendanner MA, Soltis PS | year = 2007 | title = A 567-taxon data set for angiosperms: The challenges posed by Bayesian analyses of large data sets | journal = International Journal of Plant Sciences | volume = 168 | issue = 2 | pages = 137\u2013157 | url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/509788 | doi = 10.1086/509788 | jstor = 509788}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schaefer H, Heibl C, Renner SS | year = 2009 | title = Gourds afloat: A dated phylogeny reveals an Asian origin of the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae) and numerous oversea dispersal events | journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society B|Proc Royal Soc B]] | volume = 276 | pages = 843\u2013851 | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1658/843 | archive-url = http://www.umsl.edu/~renners/Schaefer_CucBiogeo_PRSB2009.pdf | archive-date = 27 February 2017 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2008.1447| pmc = 2664369 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Filipowicz N, Renner SS | year = 2010 | title = The worldwide holoparasitic Apodanthaceae confidently placed in the Cucurbitales by nuclear and mitochondrial gene trees | journal = [[BMC Evolutionary Biology]] | volume = 10 | pages = 219 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/219 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-10-219}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bell CD, Soltis DE, Soltis PS | year = 2010 | title = The age and diversification of the angiosperms re-revisited | journal = [[American Journal of Botany|Am J Bot]] | volume = 97 | issue = 8 | pages = 1296\u20131303 | url = http://www.amjbot.org/content/97/8/1296.abstract | doi = 10.3732/ajb.0900346 | pmid = 21616882}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Renner SS, Schaefer H | year = 2016 | chapter = Phylogeny and evolution of the Cucurbitaceae | chapter-url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/7397_2016_14 | veditors = Grumet R, Katzir N, Garcia-Mas J | title = Genetics and Genomics of Cucurbitaceae | series = Plant Genetics and Genomics: Crops and Models | location = New York, NY | publisher = Springer International Publishing | pages = 1\u201311 | doi = 10.1007/7397_2016_14}}</ref>\n\n{{Clade| style=line-height:75%;\n|1={{clade\n  |1=[[Fagales]]&nbsp;([[Outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]])\n  |label2=Cucurbitales\n  |2={{clade\n    |1=[[Apodanthaceae]]\n    |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Anisophylleaceae]]\n      |2={{clade\n        |1={{clade\n          |1=[[Corynocarpaceae]]\n          |2=[[Coriariaceae]]\n           }}\n        |2=[[Cucurbitaceae]]\n        |3={{clade\n          |1=[[Tetramelaceae]]\n          |2={{clade\n            |1=[[Datiscaceae]]\n            |2=[[Begoniaceae]]\n             }}\n           }}\n         }}\n       }}\n     }}\n   }}\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Judd WS, Campbell CS, Kellogg EA, Stevens PF, Donoghue MJ | year = 2002 | title = Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach | edition = 2nd | pages = 380\u2013382 | chapter = Cucurbitales | publisher = Sinauer Associates | location = Sunderland, Massachusetts | isbn = 0-87893-403-0}}\n* {{cite book | author = du Mortier BCJ | author-link = Barth\u00e9lemy Charles Joseph du Mortier | year = 1829 | title = Analyse des Familles de Plantes: Avec l'indication des principaux genres qui s'y rattachent | pages = 28 | publisher = Imprimerie de J.

It has mixed origins from [[English country dance]], [[Scottish country dance]], and French dance styles in the 17th century.  Sometimes described as [[New England]] folk dance or [[Appalachia]]n folk dance, contra dances can be found around the world, but are most common in the [[United States]] (periodically held in nearly every state), [[Canada]], and other [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://map.cdss.org/#loc=43.445683,-80.075294,2z&types=contra|accessdate=16 Sep 2018|title=CDSS Dance Map}}</ref>\n\nContra dancing is a social dance that one can attend without a partner. The dancers form couples, and the couples form sets of two couples in long lines starting from the stage and going down the length of the dance hall.  Throughout the course of a dance, couples progress up and down these lines, dancing with each other couple in the line. The dance is led by a [[caller (dance)|caller]] who teaches the sequence of figures in the dance before the music starts.  Callers describe the series of steps called \"figures\", and in a single dance, a caller may include anywhere from 6\u201312 figures which are repeated as couples progress up and down the lines. Each time through the dance takes 64 beats, after which the pattern is repeated.\n\nAlmost all contra dances are danced to live music. The music played includes, but is not limited to, [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Scottish music|Scottish]], [[Old-time music|old-time]] and [[French-Canadian music|French-Canadian]] folk tunes.  The [[fiddle]] is considered the core instrument, though other stringed instruments can be used, such as the [[guitar]], [[banjo]], [[Double bass|bass]] and [[mandolin]], as well as the [[piano]], [[accordion]], [[flute]], [[clarinet]] and more. Some contra dances are even done to [[techno]] music. Music in a dance can consist of a single tune or a medley of tunes, and [[key change]]s during the course of a dance are common.\n\nMany callers and bands perform for local contra dances, and some are hired to play for dances around the U.S. and Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contradancelinks.com/newengland.html|title=Contra Dance / Contradance in New England|accessdate=29 Jun 2017}}</ref> Many dancers travel regionally (or even nationally) to contra dance weekends and week-long contra dance camps, where they can expect to find other dedicated dancers, great callers, and great bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contradancelinks.com/festivals.html|title=Contra Dance / Contradance Links for Festivals, Camps, and Weekends|accessdate=29 Jun 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAt the end of the 17th century, English [[country dance]]s were taken up by French dance masters.  The French called these dances ''contra-dances'' or ''contredanses'' (which roughly translated \"opposites dance\"), as indicated in a 1710 dance book called ''Recuil de Contredance''.{{sfn|Holenko|2010|p=4}}  As time progressed, these dances returned to England and were spread and reinterpreted in the United States, and eventually the French form of the name came to be associated with the American folk dances, where they were alternatively called \"country dances\" or in some parts of [[New England]] such as New Hampshire, \"contradances\".{{sfn|Laufman|2009|p=158}}<ref name=OED>{{cite encyclopedia| url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50048899?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=contra+dance&first=1&max_to_show=10| title = Contre-dance, -danse, contra-dance| encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed| publisher = Oxford University Press| year=  1989| accessdate = 2006-11-01}}\n: ''(as access to the'' OED ''online is not free, the relevant excerpt is provided)'' \"Littr\u00e9's theory, that there was already in 17th c. a French ''contre-danse'' with which the English word was confused and ran together, is not tenable; no trace of the name has been found in French before its appearance as an adaptation of the English. But new dances of this type were subsequently brought out in France, and introduced into England with the Frenchified form of the name, which led some Englishmen to the erroneous notion that the French was the original and correct form, and the English a corruption of it.\"</ref>\n\nContra dances were fashionable in the United States and were considered one of the most popular social dances across class lines in the late 18th century, though these events were usually referred to as \"country dances\" until the 1780s, when the term contra dance became more common to describe these events.{{sfn|Peterson|2000|pp=199\u2013200}}  In the mid-19th century, group dances started to decline in popularity in favor of [[quadrilles]], [[Les Lanciers|lancers]], and couple dances such as the [[waltz]] and [[polka]].{{sfn|Peterson|2000|pp=199\u2013200}}\n\n[[Henry Ford]], founder of the [[Ford Motor Company]], had a role in preserving contra and American folk dancing generally, in part as a response in opposition to modern jazz influences in the United States.{{sfn|Carlin|2005|p=192}}  In the 1920s, he asked friend and dance coordinator in Massachusetts, [[Benjamin Lovett]], to come to Michigan to begin a dance program.

A typical evening of contra dance is three hours long, including an intermission. The event consists of a number of individual ''contra dances'', divided by a scattering of other partner dances, perhaps one or more [[waltz]]es, [[schottische]]s, [[polka]]s, or Swedish [[hambo]]s.  In some places, [[square dance]]s are thrown into the mix. Music for the evening is typically performed by a live band, playing [[jig]]s and [[reel (dance)|reels]] from Ireland, Scotland, Canada, or the USA. The tunes are either [[traditional music|traditional]], and more than a century old, or modern compositions which follow the same form as the traditional pieces. Rarely, a rock tune will be woven in, to the delight of the dancers.<ref>Perpetual eMotion sing 'Eleanor Rigby' {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9veEzgGoO8Q|title=5/6/11, 2 of 9: Perpetual e-Motion at the Concord Scout House|accessdate=24 Oct 2014}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, a leader, known as a [[caller (dance)|caller]], will teach each individual dance just before the music for that dance begins. During this introductory walkthrough, participants learn the dance by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller's instructions. The caller gives the instructions orally, and sometimes augments them with demonstrations of steps by experienced dancers in the group.  The walkthrough usually proceeds in the order of the moves as they will be done with the music; in some dances, the caller may vary the order of moves during the dance, a fact that is usually explained as part of the caller's instructions.\n\nAfter the walkthrough, the music begins and the dancers repeat that sequence some number of times before that dance ends, often 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the length of the contra lines. Calls are normally given at least the first few times through, and often for the last. At the end of each dance, the dancers thank their partners. The contra dance tradition in North America is to change partners for every dance, while in the United Kingdom typically people dance with the same partner the entire evening. One who attends an evening of contra dances in North America does not need to bring his or her own partner. In the short break between individual dances, the dancers invite each other to dance. Booking ahead by asking partner or partners ahead of time for each individual dance is common at some venues, but has been discouraged by some.<ref>[http://www.bobarcher.org/dance/uk_us_comparison.html English / American dancing - a comparison]</ref><ref>[http://www.musaique.com/contradance/articles/kevra-letter.html Susan Kevra's Letter to the Greenfield Contra Dancers]</ref><ref>[http://www.gainesnet.com/booking.htm Dance Community Hospitality]</ref><ref>[http://ravitz.us/dance/call.php Notes on Calling Contra Dances]</ref>\n\nMost contra dances do not have a strict dress code.<ref name=\"contradance1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.contradance.org/html/new_dancer_info.php |title=CCD - What is Contra Dancing? |publisher=Contradance.org |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref>  No special outfits are worn, but comfortable and loose-fitting clothing that does not restrict movement is usually recommended.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sactocds.org/NewWebsite/index.php/contra-dance-what-to-wear/ |title=Contra Dance \u2013 What to Wear? &#124; Sacramento Country Dance Society |publisher=Sactocds.org |accessdate=2013-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207212329/http://www.sactocds.org/NewWebsite/index.php/contra-dance-what-to-wear/ |archivedate=2013-12-07 |df= }}</ref>  Lightweight skirts are often worn,<ref name=\"contradance1\"/> at some dances by men as well as women, as these have a very pretty effect when swinging or twirling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hatds.org/contra-faq.html |title=Contra Dance in Houston, TX - Contra Dance Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=HATDS |accessdate=2013-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013075435/http://www.hatds.org/contra-faq.html |archivedate=2013-10-13 |df= }}</ref> However, low, broken-in, soft-soled, non-marking shoes, such as dance shoes, sneakers, or sandals, are recommended and, in some places, required.<ref name=\"contradance1\"/>  As dancing can be aerobic, dancers are sometimes encouraged to bring a change of clothes.<ref name=CBDC>{{cite web|title=Your first contra dance|url=http://www.chicagobarndance.org/your-first-contra-dance/|work=Chicago Barn Dance Company|accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs in any social dance, cooperation is vital to contra dancing. Since over the course of any single dance, individuals interact with not just their partners but everyone else in the set, contra dancing might be considered a group activity. As will necessarily be the case when beginners are welcomed in by more practiced dancers, mistakes are made; most dancers are willing to help beginners in learning the steps. However, because the friendly, social nature of the dances can be misinterpreted or even abused, some groups have created anti-harassment policies.<ref name=CDSS-Social>{{cite web|title=Social and Community Dynamics|url=http://www.cdss.org/recruit-young-people.html#social|work=Country Dance and Song Society|accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=OFB>{{cite web|title=Dance Guidelines|url=http://www.oldfarmersball.com/newsletters/articles/guidelines.pdf|work=Old Farmer\u2019s Ball|accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Form==\n{{main|Contra dance form}}\n\n===Formations===\nContra dances are arranged in long lines of couples. A pair of lines is called a ''set''. Sets are generally arranged so they run the length of the hall, with the ''top'' of the set being the end closest to the band and caller. Correspondingly, the ''bottom'' of the set is the end farthest from the caller.<ref name=Pittman>{{cite book|last1=Pittman|first1=Anne M.|last2=Waller|first2=Marlys S.|last3=Dark|first3=Cathy L.|title=Dance a While: A Handbook for Folk, Square, Contra, and Social Dance, Tenth Edition|date=2015|publisher=Waveland Press|isbn=1478629517|page=197|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nCouples consist of two people, traditionally but not necessarily one male and one female, typically referred to as the gent, gentleman or man, and lady or woman. Couples interact primarily with an adjacent couple for each round of the dance. Each sub-group of two interacting couples is known to choreographers as a ''minor set'' and to dancers as a ''foursome'' or ''hands four''. Couples in the same minor set are ''neighbors''. Minor sets originate at the head of the set, starting with the topmost dancers as the 1s (the ''active couple'' or ''actives''); the other couple are ''2s'' (or ''inactives''). The 1s are said to be ''above'' their neighboring 2s; 2s are ''below''. If there is an uneven number of couples dancing, the bottom-most couple will ''wait out'' the first time through the dance.\n\nThere are four common ways of arranging couples in the minor sets: ''proper'', ''improper'', ''Becket'', and ''triple'' formations.<ref name=Pittman /> There are many additional forms a contra dance may take. Five of them are: ''triplet'', ''indecent'', ''four-face-four'', and ''whole-set''. (For diagrams and full descriptions, see [[Contra dance form|Contra Dance Form]] main article.)\n\n===Progression===\nA fundamental aspect of contra dancing is that, in a single dance, the same pattern is repeated over and over (one time through lasts roughly 30 seconds), but each time you dance with new neighbors. This change is effected by ''progressing'' the 1s ''down'' the set and progressing the 2s ''up'' (also ''up the hall'' and ''down the hall'', so that you usually dance with everybody in the line. (See the article on [[contra dance form]] for full characterizations of the progression in the eight dance forms mentioned above.)\n\nA single dance runs around ten minutes, long enough to progress 15-20 times. If the sets are short to medium length the caller will often try to run the dance until each couple has danced with every other couple both as a 1 and a 2 and returned to where they started. With longer sets (more than ~40 people) this would require long enough sets that the caller will usually only run the dance all the way around on (rare) non equal-turn dances.\n\n==Choreography==<!-- This section is linked from [[English Country Dance]] -->\n{{main|Contra dance choreography}}\nContra dance [[choreography]] specifies the dance formation, the ''figures'', and the sequence of those figures in a dance. Notably, contra dance figures (with a few exceptions) do not have defined footwork; within the limits of the music and the comfort of their fellow dancers, individuals move according to their own taste.\n\nMost contra dances consist of a sequence of about 6 to 12 individual figures, prompted by the [[Caller (dance)|caller]] in time to the [[music]] as the figures are danced. As the sequence repeats, the caller may cut down his or her prompting, and eventually drop out, leaving the dancers to each other and the music.\n\nA '''figure''' is a pattern of movement that typically takes eight ''counts'', although figures with four or 16 counts are also common. Each dance is a collection of figures assembled to allow the dancers to progress along the set (see \"Progression,\" above).\n\nA '''count''' (as used above) is one half of a [[bar (music)|musical measure]], such as one quarter note in {{music|time|2|4}} time or three eighth notes in {{music|time|6|8}} time. A count may also be called a ''step'', as contra dance is a walking form, and each count of a dance typically matches a single physical step in a figure.\n\nTypical contra dance choreography comprises four '''parts''', each 16 counts (8 measures) long. The parts are called A1, A2, B1 and B2. This nomenclature stems from the music: Most contra dance tunes (as written) have two parts (A and B), each 8 measures long, and each fitting one part of the dance.  The A and B parts are each played twice in a row, hence, A1, A2, B1, B2. While the same music is generally played in, for example, parts A1 and A2, distinct choreography is followed in those parts. Thus, a contra dance is typically 64 ''counts'', and goes with a 32 ''measure'' tune. Tunes of this form are called \"square\"; tunes that deviate from this form are called \"[[crooked tune|crooked]]\".\n\nSample contra dances:<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/contradance/index/by_title.html Michael Dyck's Country Dance Index]</ref>\n\n* Traditional - the actives do most of the movement\n:''Chorus Jig'' (Proper duple minor)\n::A1 (16) Actives down the outside and back.

[The inactives participate in half the turns]\n::B2 (16) Actives meet in the middle for a balance and swing, end swing facing up. [The inactives stand still]\n::'''Note:''' inactives will often clog in place or otherwise participate in the dance, even though the figures do not call for them to move.\n* Modern - the dance is symmetrical for actives and inactives\n:''Hay in the Barn'' by Chart Guthrie (Improper duple minor)\n::A1 (16) Neighbors balance and swing.\n::A2 (8) Ladies chain across, (8) Half hey, ladies pass right shoulders to start.\n::B1 (16) Partners balance and swing.\n::B2 (8) Ladies chain across, (8) Half hey, ladies pass right shoulders to start.\n\nMany modern contra dances have these characteristics:<ref>CONTRA DANCE CHOREOGRAPHY A Reflection of Social Change MARY McNAB DART 1995.</ref>\n* longways for as many as will\n* first couples improper, or Becket formation\n* flowing choreography\n* no-one stationary for more than 16 beats (e.g. First Couple Balance & Swing, finish facing down to make Lines of Four)\n* containing at least one swing and normally both a partner swing and a neighbour swing\n* the vast majority of the moves from a set of well-known moves that the dancers know already\n* composed mostly of moves that keep you connected to the other dancers\n* generally danced to 32 bar jigs or reels played at between 110 and 130 bpm\n* danced with a smooth walk with lots of spins and twirls\n\nAn event which consists primarily (or solely) of dances in this style is sometimes referred to as a Modern Urban Contra Dance.\n\n==Music==\nThe most common contra dance repertoire is rooted in the Anglo-Celtic tradition as it developed in North America. [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Scottish music|Scottish]], [[French-Canadian music|French Canadian]], and [[Old-time music|Old-time]] tunes are common, and [[Klezmer]] tunes have also been used. The old-time repertoire includes very few of the jigs common in the others.\n\nTunes used for a contra dance are nearly always \"square\" 64-beat tunes, in which one time through the tune is each of two 16-beat parts played twice (this is notated AABB). However, any 64-beat tune will do; for instance, three 8-beat parts could be played AABB AACC, or two 8-beat parts and one 16-beat part could be played AABB CC. Tunes not 64 beats long are called \"crooked\" and are almost never used for contra dancing, although a few crooked dances have been written as novelties. Contra tunes are played at a narrow range of [[tempo|tempos]], between 108 and 132 bpm.\n\nIn terms of instrumentation, fiddles are considered to be the primary melody instrument in contra dancing,{{sfn|Ledgin|2010|p=17}} though other stringed instruments can also be used, such as the [[mandolin]] or [[banjo]], in addition to a few wind instruments, for example, the [[accordion]]. The [[piano]], [[guitar]], and [[double bass]] are frequently found in the rhythm section of a contra dance band.{{sfn|Holenko|2010|p=6}}  Occasionally, percussion instruments are also used in contra dancing, such as the Irish [[bodhran]] or less frequently, the [[dumbek]] or [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]].{{sfn|Holenko|2010|p=5}} The last few years have seen some of the bands incorporate the Quebecois practice of [[Podorythmie|tapping feet]] on a board while playing an instrument (often the fiddle).<ref>{{cite web|title=Podorythmie / Quebecoise Podorythmie|url=http://slowplayers.org/hold/|accessdate=29 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nUntil the 1970s it was traditional to play a single tune for the duration of a contra dance (about 5 to 10 minutes). Since then, contra dance musicians have typically played tunes in sets of two or three related (and sometimes contrasting) tunes, though single-tune dances are again becoming popular with some northeastern bands. In the Celtic repertoires it is common to change keys with each tune. A set might start with a tune in G, switch to a tune in D, and end with a tune in Bm. Here, D is related to G as its dominant (5th), while D and Bm share a key signature of two sharps. In the old-time tradition the musicians will either play the same tune for the whole dance, or switch to tunes in the same key. This is because the tunings of the five-string banjo are key-specific. An old-time band might play a set of tunes in D, then use the time between dances to retune for a set of tunes in A. (Fiddlers also may take this opportunity to retune; tune- or key-specific fiddle tunings are uncommon in American Anglo-Celtic traditions other than old-time.)\n\nIn the Celtic repertoires it is most common for bands to play sets of reels and sets of jigs. However, since the underlying beat structure of jigs and reels is the same (two \"counts\" per bar) bands will occasionally mix jigs and reels in a set.\n\nIn recent years, younger contra dancers have begun establishing \"crossover contra\" or \"techno contra\" \u2014 contra dancing to techno, hip-hop, and other modern forms of music.<ref name=Forbes>{{cite news|last1=Forbes|first1=Jeff|title=Asheville and WNC folks helping grow \u2018Techno contra\u2019 dancing phenomenon|url=https://mountainx.com/arts/art-news/asheville_and_wnc_folks_helping_grow_techno_contra_dancing_phenomenon/|accessdate=15 June 2014|work=Mountain Xpress|date=17 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=Neff>{{cite news|last1=Neff|first1=Erin|title=Contra Dance, Then and Now|url=http://portlandcountrydance.org/download/footnotes_2010/Footnotes-July-Aug-10.pdf|accessdate=15 June 2014|work=Footnotes|issue=July\u2013August 2010|publisher=Portland Country Dance Community}}</ref>  While challenging for DJs and callers, the fusion of contra patterns with moves from hip-hop, tango, and other forms of dance has made this form of contra dance a rising trend since 2008.

During the [[Renaissance]], it became a [[fad]] among some members of the privileged classes, especially kings and queens. The Italian scholar and poet [[Petrarch]] is credited with being the pursuit's first and most famous aficionado.  Following his lead, many European kings, princes, and other nobility kept collections of ancient coins. Some notable collectors were [[Pope Boniface VIII]], [[Emperor Maximilian I]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Louis XIV]] of France, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], [[Henry IV of France]] and [[Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg|Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg]], who started the [[Berlin Coin Cabinet]] (German: ''M\u00fcnzkabinett Berlin''). Perhaps because only the very wealthy could afford the pursuit, in Renaissance times coin collecting became known as the \"Hobby of Kings.\"<ref name=\"The Coin Collection History\">{{cite web |title=The Coin Collection History |url=http://www.coincollectingalbum.com/coin-collecting-history.html |work=coincollectingalbum.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Brief History of Coin Collecting |url=http://www.2-clicks-coins.com/article/coin-collecting-history.html |work=2-clicks-coins.com|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Coin Collectors: Emperor Maximilian |url=http://www.zoomcoin.com/rare-coin-article/coin-collectors-emperor-maximilian/|work=zoomcoin.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries coin collecting remained a pursuit of the well-to-do. But rational, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking led to a more systematic approach to accumulation and study.  Numismatics as an academic discipline emerged in these centuries at the same time as coin collecting became a leisure pursuit of a growing [[middle class]], eager to prove their wealth and sophistication. During the 19th and 20th centuries, coin collecting increased further in popularity.  The market for coins expanded to include not only antique coins, but foreign or otherwise exotic currency. Coin shows, trade associations, and regulatory bodies emerged during these decades.<ref name=\"Coin Collecting\"/> The first international convention for coin collectors was held  15&ndash;18 August 1962, in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], and was sponsored by the [[American Numismatic Association]] and the [[Royal Canadian Numismatic Association]]. Attendance was estimated at 40,000.<ref name=\"The Coin Collection History\"/> As one of the oldest and most popular world pastimes, coin collecting is now often referred to as the \"King of Hobbies\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Coin Collecting|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A672013|work= bbc.co.uk|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Brief History of Coin Collecting |url=http://www.2-clicks-coins.com/article/coin-collecting-history.html |work=2-clicks-coins.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Motivations ==\n[[File:Two 20kr gold coins.png|thumb|Two 20 kr [[gold]] coins from the [[Scandinavian Monetary Union]].]]\n\nThe motivations for collecting vary from one person to another. Possibly the most common type of collectors are the hobbyists, who amass a collection purely for the pleasure of it with no real expectation of profit.\n\nAnother frequent reason for purchasing coins is as an investment. As with [[Philatelic investment|stamps]], [[precious metal]]s or other commodities, coin prices are periodical based on [[supply and demand]]. Prices drop for coins that are not in long-term demand, and increase along with a coin's perceived or intrinsic [[value (economics)|value]].  Investors buy with the expectation that the value of their purchase will increase over the long term. As with all types of investment, the principle of ''[[caveat emptor]]'' applies and study is recommended before buying. Likewise, as with most collectibles, a coin collection does not produce income until it is sold, and may even incur costs (for example, the cost of [[safe deposit box]] storage) in the interim.<ref name=\"Collecting And Investing In Coins\">{{cite web |title= Collecting And Investing In Coins|url= http://www.oldandsold.com/articles02/coincollecting15.shtml|work=oldandsold.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nCoin hoarders may be similar to investors in the sense that they accumulate coins for potential long-term profit. However, unlike investors, they typically do not take into account aesthetic considerations; rather they gather whatever quantity of coins they can and hold them. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}} This is most common with coins whose [[bullion|metal value]] exceeds their spending value.<ref name=\"Coin Hoards\">{{cite web |title= Coin Hoards | url=http://www.australian-threepence.com/blog/2009/07/coin-hoards.html |work=australian-threepence.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nSpeculators, be they amateurs or commercial buyers, generally purchase coins in bulk and often act with the expectation of short-term profit.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  They may wish to take advantage of a spike in demand for a particular coin (for example, during the annual release of [[Royal Canadian Mint Numismatic Coins (2000s)|Canadian numismatic collectibles]] from the [[Royal Canadian Mint]]).  The speculator might hope to buy the coin in large lots and sell at profit within weeks or months.<ref name=\"Collecting And Investing In Coins\"/> Speculators may also buy common circulation coins for their intrinsic metal value.  Coins without collectible value may be melted down or distributed as bullion for commercial purposes. Typically they purchase coins that are composed of rare or precious metals, or coins that have a high purity of a specific metal.<ref name=\"What is a Coin Collector\">{{cite web |title=What is a Coin Collector? |url=http://www.2-clicks-coins.com/article/what-is-a-coin-collector.html |work=2-clicks-coins.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nA final type of collector is the inheritor, an accidental collector who acquires coins from another person as part of an [[inheritance]]. The inheritor type may not necessarily have an interest in or know anything about [[numismatics]] at the time of the acquisition.<ref name=\"What is a Coin Collector\" />\n\n==Collector types==\nCasual coin collectors often begin the hobby by saving notable coins found by chance.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} These coins may be pocket change left from an international trip or an old coin found in circulation.\n\nUsually, if the enthusiasm of the novice increases over time, random coins found in circulation are not enough to satisfy their interest.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} The hobbyist may then trade coins in a coin club or buy coins from dealers or [[Mint (coin)|mint]]s. Their collection then takes on a more specific focus.\n\nSome enthusiasts become ''generalists'' and accumulate a few examples from a broad variety of historical or geographically significant coins.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Given enough resources, this can result in a vast collection. [[King Farouk]] of Egypt was a generalist with a collection famous for its scope and variety.<ref>{{cite web |title=\nNumismatic \"Gumshoe:\" On the Trail of King Farouk |url=http://www.goldrushgallery.com/news/gumshoe.html|first=Carl N. |last= Lester|work= goldrushgallery.com|accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nMost collectors decide to focus their financial resources on a narrower, ''specialist'' interest. Some collectors focus on coins of a certain nation or historic period.  Some collect coins by themes (or 'subjects') that are featured on the artwork displayed on the coin.<ref>{{citation |title=Coins arranged by list of Themes on coin collector catalog|date=18 September 2014|url=http://colnect.com/coins/themes|accessdate=18 September 2014}}</ref> Others will seek [[Mint-made errors|error coins]]. Still others might focus on [[exonumia]] such as [[medal]]s, [[Token coin|tokens]] or [[challenge coin]]s.\nSome collectors are ''completists'' and seek an example of every type of coin within a certain category. Perhaps the most famous of these is [[Louis Eliasberg]], the only collector thus far to assemble a complete set of known [[United States coinage|coins of the United States]].\n\nCoin collecting can become a ''[[competition|competitive]]'' activity, as prompted by the recent emergence of PCGS ([[Professional Coin Grading Service]]) and NGC ([[Numismatic Guarantee Corporation]]) [[Registry Sets]]. Registry Sets are private collections of coins verified for ownership and quality by [[Coin grading|numismatic grading]] services. The grading services assess collections, seal the coins in clear plastic holders, then register and publish the results. This can lead to very high prices as dedicated collectors compete for the very best specimens of, for example, each date and [[mint mark]] combination.<ref>{{cite web |title=PCGS Set Registry |url=http://www.pcgs.com/setregistry/|work=pcgs.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=NGC Collectors Society |url=http://coins.www.collectors-society.com/registry/coins/public_sets.aspx|work=ngccoin.com  |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Common themes==\n[[File:Lk-colonialcoins.jpg|thumb|Some coins of [[Ceylon]]]]\n[[File:Eagle coins.jpg|thumb|Coins featuring eagles]]\n\nA few common themes are often combined into a collection goal:\n\n*''Country collections'': Many enthusiasts focus their collection on only a single country\u2014often their own.  In contrast, some collectors attempt to obtain a sample from every country that has issued a coin.<ref>{{cite web |title=Coin Collecting Themes-One From Every Country |url= http://www.australian-threepence.com/blog/2009/01/coin-collecting-themes-one-from-every-country.html |work=australian-threepence.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref>\n*''Year collections'': Rather than being satisfied with a single specimen of a type, a great many collectors collect type by year; for example, one [[Penny (U.S. coin)|Memorial Lincoln Cent]] for every year from 1959 (the year it was first minted) to 2008 (the last year it was minted). This is perhaps one of the most practical ways to collect a national currency since probably the majority of coin reference books and coin albums catalogue in the same manner.<ref>{{cite web |title=7 Popular Coin Collecting Themes |url= http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art55473.asp  |first= Gary |last= Eggleston|work=bellaonline.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref>\n*''Mint mark collections'': Many collectors consider different [[mint mark]]s significant enough to justify representation in their collection.  When collecting coins by year, this multiplies the number of specimens needed to complete a collection. Some mint marks are more common than others.<ref name=\"Coin Collecting Themes\">{{cite web |title=Coin Collecting Themes |url=http://coinandstampcollecting.articlehq.net/Coin-Collecting-Themes.html  |work=coinandstampcollecting.articlehq.net |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref>\n*''Variety collections'': Because mints generally issue thousands or millions of any given coin, they use multiple sets of [[coin die]]s to produce the same coin. Occasionally these dies have slight differences. This was more common on older coins because the coin dies were hand carved.  But differences\u2014intentional or accidental\u2014still exist on coins today. Generally this is in a very small detail, such as the number of leaves on the ear of corn on the recent US Wisconsin [[50 State Quarters|state quarter]] [[:File:2004 WI Proof.png]].\n*''Type collections'': Often a collection consists of an examples of major design variants for a period of time in one country or region. For example,  [[United States coinage type set]], [[Euro coin]]s carry a \"common side\" that shows the denomination and a \"national side\" that varies in design from state to state within the [[Eurozone]].  Likewise, a type collection might focus on an unusual design feature such as coins with a hole in the middle, coins that are not circular in shape or coins with [[brockage]].<ref>{{cite web |title=7 Popular Coin Collecting Themes |url= http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art55473.asp  |first= Gary |last =Eggleston|work=bellaonline.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref>\n*''Composition collections'': For some, the [[metallurgical]] composition of the coin itself is of interest. For example, a collector might collect only [[bimetallic coins]]. Precious metals like gold, silver, copper and platinum are of frequent interest to collectors, but enthusiasts also pursue historically significant pieces like the [[1943 steel cent]] or the [[1974 aluminum cent]].<ref name=\"coincollecting101.com\">{{cite web |title= Coin Collecting: Common Coin Collecting Themes|url= http://www.coincollecting101.com/coin-collecting/coin-collecting-2/8 |work=coincollecting101.com|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref> (Note that because the latter example was a [[pattern coin]] (a proposed design that was never produced for circulation) the U.S. Government considers private ownership of the 1974 aluminum cent illegal.)\n*''Subject collections'': Collectors with an interest in a certain theme or subject (such as, ships or eagles) may collect only coins depicting that interest.<ref name=\"Coin Collecting Themes\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Coins by Themes, on Coin Collectors Catalog |url= http://colnect.com/coins/themes|accessdate=18 September 2014}}</ref>\n*''Period collections'': Collectors may restrict themselves to coins of the 18th or 19th century, while others collect ancient and medieval coins. Coins of [[Roman currency|Roman]], [[Byzantine currency|Byzantine]], [[Greek coins|Greek]] origin are amongst the more popular ancient coins collected.<ref name=\"Goldsborough 2008\">{{cite web |title=  Counterfeit Coin Detection|url=  http://rg.ancients.info/guide/counterfeits.html|year=2008 |work= |first= Reid |last= Goldsborough|accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref> Some collect coins minted during a particular ruler's reign or a representative coin from each ruler. Collectors may also take interest in money issued during the administration of a historically significant bureaucrat such as a [[central bank]] governor, [[treasurer]] or finance secretary. For example, [[Reserve Bank of India]] governor [[James Braid Taylor]] presided over the country's move from [[silver currency]] to [[fiat money]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Governors |url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/governors.aspx |work=Reserve Bank of India: India's Central Bank |publisher=rbi.org.in |accessdate=15 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916083919/http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/governors.aspx |archivedate=16 September 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> Coins reflect the events of the time in which they are produced, so coins issued during historically important periods are especially interesting to collectors.<ref name=\"coincollecting101.com\"/>\n*''Printed value collections'': A currency collection might be modeled around the theme of a specific printed value, for example, the number 1. This collection might include specimens of the US 1 [[Dollar coin (United States)|dollar coin]], the Canadian [[Loonie]], the [[1 euro coins|Euro]], 1 [[Indian rupee]] and 1 [[Singapore dollar]].\n*''Volume collections ([[Hoards]])'': Collectors may have an interest in acquiring large volumes of a particular coins (e.g., as many pennies as they can store). These usually are not high-value coins, but the interest is in collecting a large volume of them either for the sake of the challenge, as a store of value, or in the hope that the intrinsic metal value will increase.<ref name=\"Coin Hoards\"/>\n\n[[File:Italia 20 lire argento Mussolini.JPG|thumb|A false 20 [[Lira]] coin, 1927.

Examples include communist states such as the ([[China|PRC China]]) and the [[Soviet Union]] and satellite or constituent nations which shared similar iconography. Another common Geo-political coin collection may include coins from nations within the former and current [[British Empire]], such as [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Fiji]], [[Samoa]], [[Canada]], nations of the [[Caribbean]], [[South Africa]], [[Rhodesia]], and other nations from [[Africa]] and [[South America]], as well as Asia, such as [[Hong Kong]] and Europe, for example [[Northern Ireland]] a.k.a. \"the Provence\". Such collections can be broken down into geographical regions, such as British territories in Europe, from Africa, from Asia, the Americas, or from the Pacific, and even the smaller region of [[Oceania]]. Such coin collections can include a wide variety of coin shape and constituent materials, on the other hand they can also include periods where coins were very similar either in/or both composition and dimensions, with one face of the coin depicting local variance. There are many different Geo-political movements/ forces to choose from, including political movements such as [[Communism]] [[Fascism]] and [[Nationalism]], and Empires such as those of the great European expansionists including [[England]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. Collectors of coins from empires have a wide time-span to choose from as there have been various forms of empire for thousands of years, with different regions changing hands between them.\n*''Aesthetic collections'' : Some collections consist of coins which could fit into the other categories, and on coin grading may be graded poorly due to not conforming to their systems. These collections are made up of coins which are pleasing to the owner and to others not due to perfect condition, but rather due to the uniqueness of the coin based on several factors. These can include [[patina]]s which form from being exposed to acidic or basic environments (such as soil, when coins are excavated), and warping or wearing which come from use in circulation. Very interesting patinas and patterns can form on coins which have been naturally expose to environments which can affect the contents of the coin. Examples include naturally blackened Victorian pennies, which have only the most raised surface showing the underlying copper, meaning that the head is clearly presented.<ref>{{cite web |title=7 Popular Coin Collecting Themes |url= http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art55473.asp  |first= Gary |last =Eggleston|work=bellaonline.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 June 2014}}</ref> Many collectors often find discolored coins from the same year which are remarkably different, which makes for added categorization and enjoyment.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n:These sorts of collections are not enjoyed by mainstream collectors and traditional collectors, even though they themselves may have in the past or continue to have pieces which could be considered part of an aesthetic collection. One of the issues with this category is that the coins can be seen to have less perceived value to speculators and appraisers. Secondly the coins may be produced artificially, that is coins can be exposed to substances which can create effects similar to those sought for aesthetic collections. This means that coins which may be worth more to historians, numismatists and collectors for their purposes will be destroyed by the process.\n\n== Grade and value ==\n\nIn coin collecting, the condition of a coin (its grade) is paramount to its value; a high-quality example is often worth many times more than a poor example. Collectors have created [[coin grading|systems]] to describe the overall condition of coins.\n\nIn the early days of coin collecting\u2014before the development of a large international coin market\u2014extremely precise grades were not needed.  Coins were described using only three adjectives: \"good,\" \"fine\" or \"uncirculated\". By the mid 20th century, with the growing market for rare coins, the [[American Numismatic Association]] helps identify most coins in North America. It uses a 1&ndash;70 numbering scale, where 70 represents a perfect specimen and 1 represents a barely identifiable coin. Descriptions and numeric grades for coins (from highest to lowest) is as follows:<ref name=\"History of Grading\">\n{{cite web\n | title = History of Grading\n | work = slatercoins.com\n | publisher = Slater Numismatics, LLC\n | year = 2008\n | url = http://www.slatercoins.com/main/page_grading_history.html\n | accessdate = 26 August 2009\n}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n | first = Mitch\n | last = Hight\n | title = Grading U.S. Coins\n | work = coin-gallery.com\n | publisher =\n | url = http://www.coin-gallery.com/cggradingart.htm\n | accessdate = 26 August 2009\n}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n | title = Grading\n | publisher = ngccoin.com\n | work = NGC Grading\n | url = http://www.ngccoin.com/coingrading/grading2.asp\n | accessdate = 17 July 2008\n}}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:Deutsche Mark Anaglyph 1.jpg|thumb|This [[Deutsche Mark]] coin shows blemishes and rim dents that would detract from its grade in appraisal. {{3D glasses}}]]\n\n* Mint State (MS) 60\u201370: Uncirculated (UNC)\n* About/Almost Uncirculated (AU) 50, 53, 55, 58\n* Extremely Fine (XF or EF) 40, 45\n* Very Fine (VF) 20, 25, 30, 35\n* Fine (F) 12, 15\n* Very Good (VG) 8, 10\n* Good (G) 4, 6\n* About Good (AG) 3\n* Fair (F) 2\n* Poor (P) 1\n\nIn addition to the rating of coins by their wear, [[Proof coinage]] occurs as a separate category.  These are specimens struck from polished dies and are often packaged and sold by mints.  This is frequently done for [[Commemorative coin]]s, though annual proof sets of circulating coinage may be issued as well.  Unless mishandled, they will stay in Mint State.  Collectors often desire both the proof and regular (\"business strike\") issues of a coin, though the difference in price between the two may be significant. Additionally, proof coins follow the same 1-70 grading scale as business strike coins, though they use the PR or PF prefix.\n\nCoin experts in Europe and elsewhere often shun the numerical system, preferring to rate specimens on a purely descriptive, or [[Adjective|adjectival]], scale. Nevertheless, most grading systems use similar terminology and values and remain mutually intelligible.<ref>{{cite web |title=European Collectors Stick With Verbal Grading System  |url=http://www.pcgs.com/articles/article_view.chtml?artid=1470&universeid=105&type=1 |date=20 September 1999 |work=Professional Coin Grading Service|publisher=pcgs.com|first=Alan |last= Herbert |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=German Coin Grading |url=http://www.germancoins.com/grading.html  |year=2009 |work= germancoins.com|first= Ron |last= Guth|accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Grading Standards|url=http://www.fleur-de-coin.com/articles/grade_standards.html  |work=fleur-de-coin.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:pcgs-rattler-front.jpg|thumb|An early PCGS slab.]] -->\n\nWhen evaluating a coin, the following\u2014often subjective\u2014factors may be considered:\n#\"eye appeal\" or the aesthetic interest of the coin;\n#dents on the rim;\n#unsightly scratches or other blemishes on the surface of the coin;\n#[[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]];\n#[[Toning (coin)|toning]];\n#level of detail retained, where a coin with full details obviously is valued higher than one with worn details.

Certification services can sometimes be controversial because grading is subjective; coins may be graded differently by different services or even upon resubmission to the same service. The numeric grade alone does not represent all of a coin's characteristics, such as toning, strike, brightness, color, luster, and attractiveness. Due to potentially large differences in value over slight differences in a coin's condition, some submitters will repeatedly resubmit a coin to a grading service in the hope of receiving a higher grade. Because fees are charged for certification, submitters must funnel money away from purchasing additional coins.<ref name=\"ngccoin.com\"/><ref name=\"PCGS Coin Facts\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Travers|first1=Scott|title=THE 10 GREATEST MYTHS OF \u2018SLABBED\u2019 COINS|url=http://www.usgoldexpert.com/articles/the-10-greatest-myths-of-slabbed-coins/|website=usgoldexpert.com|publisher=usgoldexpert.com|accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A Companion to Rare Coin Collecting - Grading Services \n|url=http://www.mycoincollecting.com/rare-coins/companion-rare-coin-collecting-Part4.html  |work=mycoincollecting.com|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=PNG, ICTA Announce Results of 2006 Grading Services Survey|url=http://www.pngdealers.org/news-releases/item/59-png-icta-announce-results-of-2006-grading-services-survey|website=pngdealers.org|publisher=Professional Numismatists Guild|accessdate=2015-09-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921201009/http://www.pngdealers.org/news-releases/item/59-png-icta-announce-results-of-2006-grading-services-survey|archive-date=21 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Numismatics}}\n{{Commons category|Coins}}\n* [[Challenge coin]]\n* [[Coin]]\n* [[Coin catalog]]\n* [[Coin grading]]\n* [[Exonumia]]\n* [[Numismatics]]\n* [[Regular issue coinage]]\n* [[Seigniorage]]\n* [[List of most expensive coins]]\n\n===Examples===\n* [[Byron Reed Collection]]\n* [[Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences#Hakim Fazlur Rahman Museum on Arts.2C Culture and Orientalism|Collection at Ibn Sina Academy]]\n\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================-->\n<!--| DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

Players take turns shooting discs across the circular playing surface, trying to have their discs land in the higher-scoring regions of the board, while also attempting to knock away opposing discs.\n\n==Equipment==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\n[[File:Crokinole Board.png|thumb|A round tournament style crokinole board. Boards may also be octagonal, which is the more \"traditional\" shape.]]\nBoard dimensions vary with a playing surface typically of polished wood or laminate approximately {{convert|26|in|mm}} in diameter. The arrangement is 3 concentric rings worth 5, 10, and 15 points as you move in from the outside. There is a shallow 20-point hole at the center.<ref>http://www.crokinole.com/rules.asp</ref> The inner 15-point ring is guarded with 8 small bumpers or posts. The outer ring of the board is divided into four quadrants. The outer edge of the board is raised slightly to keep errant shots from flying out, with a gutter between the playing surface and the edge to collect discarded pieces. Crokinole boards are typically octagonal or round in shape. The discs are roughly [[Draughts|checker]]-sized, slightly smaller in diameter than the board's central hole, and may have concave faces to reduce [[Friction#Kinetic friction|sliding friction]]. Alternatively, the game may be played with ring-shaped pieces with a central hole.\n\n===Powder===\nThe use of any lubricating powder in crokinole is controversial, with some purists reviling the practice.\n\nPowder is used to ensure pieces slide smoothly on the surface. According to Carrom rules, the powder must be of high quality to keep the surface smooth and dry, and shall not be wet. Pouches and containers are used to spread the powder over the playing surface. There must be no impurity in the powder. [[Boric acid]] powder is mostly used for this purpose.\n\nIn the UK, many players use a version of [[anti-set-off spray powder]], from the printing industry, which has specific [[electrostatic]] properties, with particles of 50-micrometre diameter ({{convert|0.001|mm|in|disp=output only}}). The powder is made of pure food-grade plant/vegetable starch.\n\n==Gameplay==\nCrokinole is most commonly played by two players, or by four players in teams of two, with partners sitting across the board from each other. Players take turns flicking their discs from the outer edge of their quadrant of the board onto the playfield. Shooting is usually done by flicking the disc with a finger, though sometimes small [[cue stick]]s may be used. If there are any enemy discs on the board, a player must make contact, directly or indirectly, with an enemy disc during the shot. If unsuccessful, the shot disc is \"fouled\" and removed from the board, along with any of the player's other discs that were moved during the shot.\n\nWhen there are no enemy discs on the board, many (but not all) rules also state that a player must shoot for the centre of the board, and a shot disc must finish either completely inside the 15-point guarded ring line, or (depending on the specifics of the rules) be inside or touching this line. This is often called the \"no hiding\" rule, since it prevents players from placing their first shots where their opponent must traverse completely though the guarded centre ring to hit them and avoid fouling. When playing without this rule, a player may generally make any shot desired, and as long as a disc remains completely inside the outer line of the playfield, it remains on the board. During any shot, any disc that falls completely into the recessed central \"20\" hole (a.k.a. the \"Toad\" or \"Dukie\") is removed from play, and counts as twenty points for the owner of the disc at the end of the round, assuming the shot is valid.<ref name=\"Aubrey\">{{cite book |last=Aubrey |first=Irene Elizabeth |title=Sports and Games in Canadian Children's Books |publisher=National Library of Canada |date=1982 |isbn=0-662-51763-6}}</ref><ref name=\"Bell\">{{cite book |last=Bell |first=R. C. |author-link=Robert Charles Bell |title=Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations |date=1979 |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=0-486-23855-5}}</ref>\n\nScoring occurs after all pieces (generally 12 per player or team) have been played, and is differential: i.e., the player or team with higher score is awarded the difference between the higher and lower scores for the round, thus only one team or player each round gains points. Play continues until a predetermined winning score is reached.\n\n==History of the game==\nThe earliest known crokinole board was made by craftsman Eckhardt Wettlaufer in 1876 in [[Perth County, Ontario|Perth County]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It is said Wettlaufer crafted the board as a fifth birthday present for his son Adam, which is now part of the collection at the Joseph Schneider Haus, a national historic site in Kitchener, Ontario, with a focus on Germanic folk art.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.therecord.com/living-story/5783152-crokinole-city-flickers-revive-a-country-pastime/ |title= Crokinole: City flickers revive a country pastime |publisher=Waterloo Region Record |date=4 August 2015}}</ref>  Several other home-made boards dating from southwestern Ontario in the 1870s have been discovered since the 1990s.

The reason for this misconception may be due to its popularity in Mennonite and Amish groups.
