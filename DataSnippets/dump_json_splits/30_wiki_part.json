Chordates are [[deuterostome]]s, as during the embryo development stage the anus forms before the mouth. They are also [[bilateral symmetry|bilaterally symmetric]] [[coelom]]ates with [[Metameric|metameric segmentation]] and a [[circulatory system]]. In the case of [[vertebrate]] chordates, the notochord is usually replaced by a [[vertebral column]] during development.\n\nTaxonomically, the phylum includes the following subphyla: the [[vertebrate|Vertebrata]], which includes [[fish]], [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s; the [[Tunicate|Tunicata]], which includes [[salp]]s and [[sea squirt]]s; and the [[Cephalochordate|Cephalochordata]], which include the [[lancelet]]s. There are also additional extinct taxa such as the [[Vetulicolia]]. The Vertebrata are sometimes considered as a subgroup of the clade [[Craniate|Craniata]], consisting of chordates with a [[skull]]; the Craniata and Tunicata compose the clade Olfactores.\n\nOf the more than 65,000 living species of chordates, about half are bony fish of the superclass [[Osteichthyes]]. The world's largest and fastest animals, the [[blue whale]] and [[peregrine falcon]] respectively, are chordates, as are [[human]]s. Fossil chordates are known from at least as early as the [[Cambrian explosion]].\n\n[[Hemichordate|Hemichordata]], which includes the [[acorn worm]]s, has been presented as a fourth chordate subphylum, but it now is usually treated as a separate phylum. The Hemichordata, along with the [[Echinoderm]]ata (which includes [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[sea cucumber]]s, and [[crinoid]]s), form the [[Ambulacraria]], the [[Sister group|sister taxon]] of the Chordates. The Chordata and Ambulacraria form the superphylum Deuterostomia, composed of the [[deuterostome]]s.\n\n==Overview of affinities==\nAttempts to work out the evolutionary relationships of the chordates have produced several hypotheses. The current consensus is that chordates are [[monophyletic]], meaning that the Chordata include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, which is itself a chordate, and that [[craniate]]s' nearest relatives are tunicates.\n\nAll of the earliest chordate [[fossil]]s have been found in the Early [[Cambrian]] [[Chengjiang fauna]], and include two species that are regarded as [[fish]], which implies that they are vertebrates. Because the fossil record of early chordates is poor, only [[molecular phylogenetics]] offers a reasonable prospect of dating their emergence. However, the use of molecular phylogenetics for dating evolutionary transitions is controversial.\n\nIt has also proved difficult to produce a detailed classification within the living chordates. Attempts to produce evolutionary \"[[phylogenetic tree|family trees]]\" shows that many of the traditional [[class (biology)|classes]] are [[paraphyletic]].\n\nWhile this has been well known since the 19th century, an insistence on only monophyletic taxa has resulted in vertebrate classification being in a state of flux.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Holland|first=N.

The solitary [[enteropneust]]s, commonly known as \"acorn worms\", have long [[proboscis]]es and worm-like bodies with up to 200 branchial slits, are up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} long, and burrow though seafloor [[sediment]]s. [[Pterobranch]]s are [[colony (biology)|colonial]] animals, often less than {{convert|1|mm|in}} long individually, whose dwellings are interconnected. Each [[filter feeding|filter feeds]] by means of a pair of branched tentacles, and has a short, shield-shaped proboscis. The extinct [[graptolite]]s, colonial animals whose fossils look like tiny [[hacksaw]] blades, lived in tubes similar to those of pterobranchs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/chordata/hemichordata.html|accessdate=2008-09-22|title=Introduction to the Hemichordata|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology}}</ref>\n\n===Echinoderms===\n[[File:Red-knobbed.starfish.arp.jpg|thumb|203x203px|A red knob sea star, ''[[Protoreaster linckii]]'' is an example of [[Asterozoa]]n [[Echinoderm]].|left]]\n{{main|Echinoderm}}\n[[Echinoderm]]s differ from chordates and their other relatives in three conspicuous ways: they possess [[bilateral symmetry]] only as larvae - in adulthood they have [[radial symmetry]], meaning that their body pattern is shaped like a wheel; they have [[tube feet]]; and their bodies are supported by [[skeleton]]s made of [[calcite]], a material not used by chordates. Their hard, calcified shells keep their bodies well protected from the environment, and these skeletons enclose their bodies, but are also covered by thin skins. The feet are powered by another unique feature of echinoderms, a [[water vascular system]] of canals that also functions as a \"lung\" and surrounded by muscles that act as pumps. [[Crinoid]]s look rather like flowers, and use their feather-like arms to filter food particles out of the water; most live anchored to rocks, but a few can move very slowly. Other echinoderms are mobile and take a variety of body shapes, for example [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s and [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumbers]].<ref name=\"CowenHistLifeEd3P412\">{{cite book\n| author=Cowen, R. | title=History of Life | year=2000 | page=412\n| publisher=Blackwell Science | edition=3rd | isbn=978-0-632-04444-3\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Chordate genomics]]\n*[[List of chordate orders]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikispecies|Chordata}}\n{{Wikibooks|Dichotomous Key|Chordata}}\n* {{EOL}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110425151037/http://www.globaltwitcher.com/taxa_class.asp?phylaid=1 Chordate on GlobalTwitcher.com]\n* [http://tolweb.org/Chordata/2499 Chordate node at Tree Of Life]\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=7711 Chordate node at NCBI Taxonomy]\n\n{{Animalia}}\n{{Chordata}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q10915}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Chordates| ]]\n<!-- [[Category:Deuterostomes]] included in the above category -->\n<!-- [[Category:Animal phyla]] moved to \"Chordata\" redirect -->\n[[Category:Terreneuvian first appearances]]\n[[Category:Extant Cambrian first appearances]]", "sha1": "fr9zdwulqgots886g6kw0c7cqtgia4w"}}, {"title": "Charlize Theron", "ns": "0", "id": "5132", "revision": {"id": "866652082", "parentid": "866647355", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T17:38:13Z", "contributor": {"username": "Newslinger", "id": "33467233"}, "comment": "Undid revision 866647355 by [[Special:Contributions/TheNamelessDoll|TheNamelessDoll]] ([[User talk:TheNamelessDoll|talk]]) Not supported by article.

She is the recipient of [[List of accolades received by Charlize Theron|several accolades]], including an [[Academy Award]], a [[Golden Globe Award]], and the [[Silver Bear for Best Actress]].\n\nTheron came to international prominence in the 1990s by playing the leading lady in the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood films]] ''[[The Devil's Advocate (1997 film)|The Devil's Advocate]]'' (1997), ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1998 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' (1998), ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'' (1999). In 2003, she received critical acclaim for her portrayal of serial killer [[Aileen Wuornos]] in ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], becoming the first South African to win an Oscar in a major acting category. She received another Academy Award nomination for playing a sexually abused woman seeking justice in the drama ''[[North Country (film)|North Country]]'' (2005). Theron has since starred in several top-grossing action films, including ''[[Hancock (film)|Hancock]]'' (2008), ''[[Snow White and the Huntsman]]'' (2012), ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' (2012), ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'' (2015), ''[[The Fate of the Furious]]'' (2017), and ''[[Atomic Blonde]]'' (2017). She also received praise for playing troubled women in [[Jason Reitman]]'s comedy-dramas ''[[Young Adult (film)|Young Adult]]'' (2011) and ''[[Tully (2018 film)|Tully]]'' (2018).\n\nSince the early 2000s, Theron has ventured into film production with her company [[Denver and Delilah Productions]]. She has produced numerous films, many of which she had a starring role in, including ''[[The Burning Plain]]'' (2008) and ''[[Dark Places (2015 film)|Dark Places]]'' (2015). Theron became an American citizen in 2007, while retaining her South African citizenship.

a checkered gameboard with 64&nbsp;squares arranged in an 8\u00d78 grid.<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chess |volume=6 |pages=93\u2013106}}</ref> The game<!--It is one of the world's most popular games{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=April 2015}}--> is played by millions of people worldwide. Chess is believed to have originated in [[History of India|India]] sometime before the 7th&nbsp;century. The game was derived from the Indian game [[chaturanga]], which is also the likely ancestor of the Eastern strategy games [[xiangqi]], [[janggi]], and [[shogi]]. Chess reached Europe by the 9th&nbsp;century, due to the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]].  The pieces assumed their current powers in Spain in the late 15th&nbsp;century; the rules were standardized in the 19th&nbsp;century.\n\nPlay does not involve hidden information. Each player begins with 16 [[chess piece|pieces]]: one [[king (chess)|king]], one [[queen (chess)|queen]], two [[rook (chess)|rooks]], two [[knight (chess)|knights]], two [[bishop (chess)|bishops]], and eight [[pawn (chess)|pawns]]. Each of the six piece types [[#Movement|moves]] differently, with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn. The objective is to ''[[checkmate]]''{{refn|The word \"Checkmate\" is derived from the Persian ''Shah mat'' (\"the king is dead\"). {{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chess |volume=6 |page=101 |short=1}} |group=note}} the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. To this end, a player's pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, while supporting each other. During the game, play typically involves making {{chessgloss|trade|exchanges}} of one piece for an opponent's similar piece, but also finding and engineering opportunities to trade one piece for two, or to get a better position. In addition to checkmate, a player wins the game if the opponent {{chessgloss|resign|resigns}}, or (in a timed game) runs out of time.  There are also several ways that a game can end in a [[draw (chess)|draw]].\n\nThe first generally recognized [[World Chess Championship|World Chess Champion]], [[Wilhelm Steinitz]], claimed his title in 1886. Since 1948, the World Championship has been regulated by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs]] (FIDE), the game's international governing body. FIDE also awards life-time [[chess title|master titles]] to skilled players, the highest of which is [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]]. Many national chess organizations have a title system of their own. FIDE also organizes the [[Women's World Chess Championship|Women's World Championship]], the [[World Junior Chess Championship|World Junior Championship]], the [[World Senior Chess Championship|World Senior Championship]], the [[fast chess|Blitz and Rapid World Championships]], and the [[Chess Olympiad]], a popular competition among international teams. FIDE is a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]], which can be considered as a recognition of chess as a [[Olympic sports#Recognized sports|sport]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.olympic.org/world-chess-federation |title=Recognized Sports Federations: World Chess Federation |accessdate=22 October 2017 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023173859/https://www.olympic.org/world-chess-federation |archivedate=23 October 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Several national sporting bodies (for example the Spanish ''[[Consejo Superior de Deportes]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csd.gob.es/csd/asociaciones/1fedagclub/soapcli.2007-02-14.7388867167/ |title=Federaciones Espa\u00f1olas |accessdate=4 October 2015 |publisher=Consejo Superior de Deportes |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004082601/http://www.csd.gob.es/csd/asociaciones/1fedagclub/soapcli.2007-02-14.7388867167/ |archivedate=4 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>) also recognize chess as a sport. Chess was included in the 2006 and 2010 [[Asian Games]]. There is also a [[World Correspondence Chess Champion|Correspondence Chess World Championship]] and a [[World Computer Chess Championship]]. Online chess has opened amateur and professional competition to a wide and varied group of players.\n\nSince the second half of the 20th century, computers have been [[Chess engine|programmed to play chess]] with increasing success, to the point where the strongest personal computers play at a higher level than the best human players. Since the 1990s, computer analysis has contributed significantly to chess theory, particularly in the endgame. The IBM computer [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] was the first machine to overcome a reigning World Chess Champion in a match when it [[Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov|defeated]] [[Garry Kasparov]] in 1997. The rise of strong [[chess engine]]s runnable on hand-held devices has led to increasing concerns about [[Cheating in chess|cheating]] during tournaments.\n\nThere are many [[List of chess variants|variants of chess]] that utilize different rules, pieces, or boards. One of these, [[Chess960]] (originally named \"Fischerandom\"), incorporates regular chess rules but with one of 960 different possible start-up positions. Chess960 has gained widespread popularity as well as some FIDE recognition.\n\n==Rules==\n{{Main|Rules of chess}}\nThe rules of chess are published by [[FIDE]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs''), chess's international governing body, in its Handbook.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=207&view=article\n |title       = FIDE Laws of Chess taking effect from 1 July 2017\n |accessdate  = 1 June 2017\n |publisher   = FIDE\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170805002105/https://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=207&view=article\n |archivedate = 5 August 2017\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>  Rules published by national governing bodies, or by unaffiliated chess organizations, commercial publishers, etc., may differ.

The colors of the 64 squares alternate and are referred to as ''light'' and ''dark'' squares. The chessboard is placed with a light square at the right-hand end of the rank nearest to each player.\n\nBy convention, the [[chess piece|game pieces]] are divided into [[White and Black in chess|white and black sets]], and the players are referred to as ''White'' and ''Black'' respectively. Each player begins the game with 16 pieces of the specified color, which consist of one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The pieces are set out as shown in the [[Chess diagram|diagram]] and photo, with each queen on a square of its own color, the white queen on a light square and the black queen on a dark.\n\n===Movement===\nThe player with the white pieces always moves first. After the first move, players alternately move one piece per turn (except for [[castling]], when two pieces are moved). Pieces are moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from play. With the sole exception of ''[[en passant]]'', all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies. A player may not make any move that would put or leave the player's own king under attack. A player cannot \"pass\"; at each turn one must make a legal move (this is the basis for the finesse called [[zugzwang]]).\n\nIf the player to move has no legal move, the game is over; it is either a [[checkmate]] (a loss for the player with no legal moves) if the king is under attack, or a [[stalemate]] (a draw) if the king is not.\n\nEach [[chess piece]] has its own way of moving. In the diagrams, the dots mark the squares where the piece can move if there are no intervening piece(s) of either color.\n{{col-begin|width=auto; float:right; clear:right}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tright\n|Moves of the [[King (chess)|king]]\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|xo|xo|xo|__\n|__|__|__|__|xo|kl|xo|__\n|__|__|__|__|xo|xo|xo|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tright\n|Moves of a [[Rook (chess)|rook]]\n|__|__|__|xo|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|xo|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|xo|__|__|__|__\n|xo|xo|xo|rl|xo|xo|xo|xo\n|__|__|__|xo|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|xo|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|xo|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|xo|__|__|__|__}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tright\n|Moves of a [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]]\n|xo|__|__|__|__|__|xo|__\n|__|xo|__|__|__|xo|__|__\n|__|__|xo|__|xo|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|bl|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|xo|__|xo|__|__|__\n|__|xo|__|__|__|xo|__|__\n|xo|__|__|__|__|__|xo|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|xo}}\n{{col-end}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto; float:right; clear:right}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tright\n|Moves of the [[Queen (chess)|queen]]\n|__|__|__|xo|__|__|__|xo\n|xo|__|__|xo|__|__|xo|__\n|__|xo|__|xo|__|xo|__|__\n|__|__|xo|xo|xo|__|__|__\n|xo|xo|xo|ql|xo|xo|xo|xo\n|__|__|xo|xo|xo|__|__|__\n|__|xo|__|xo|__|xo|__|__\n|xo|__|__|xo|__|__|xo|__}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tright\n|Moves of a [[Knight (chess)|knight]]\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|xo|__|xo|__|__|__\n|__|xo|__|__|__|xo|__|__\n|__|__|__|nl|__|__|__|__\n|__|xo|__|__|__|xo|__|__\n|__|__|xo|__|xo|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tright\n|Moves of a [[Pawn (chess)|pawn]]\n|__|__|__|xx|xo|xx|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|pl|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|xx|xo|xx|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|pl|__|__|__|xo|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|xx|xo|xx|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|pl|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__}}\n{{col-end}}\n* The [[king (chess)|king]] moves one square in any direction.

Along with the king, a rook is involved during the king's castling move.\n* The [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot leap over other pieces.\n* The [[queen (chess)|queen]] combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.\n* The [[knight (chess)|knight]] moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal, thus the move forms an \"L\"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically. The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.\n* The [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied (black dots in the diagram); or the pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, by moving to that square (black \"x\"s). A pawn has two special moves: the ''en passant'' capture and [[promotion (chess)|promotion]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Castling===\n{{Main|Castling}}\n[[File:ChessCastlingMovie en.svg|thumb|upright=0.95|Examples of [[castling]] ([https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/ChessCastlingMovie_en.svg view animation])]]\nOnce in every game, each king is allowed to make a special move, known as ''[[castling]]''. Castling consists of moving the king two squares along the first rank toward a rook (which is on the player's first rank{{refn|Without this additional restriction, which was added to the FIDE rules in 1972, it would be possible to promote a pawn on the e-{{chessgloss|file}} to a rook and then castle vertically across the board (as long as the other conditions are met). This way of castling was \"discovered\" by Max Pam and used by [[Tim Krabb\u00e9]] in a [[Joke chess problem#Offbeat interpretations of the rules of chess|chess puzzle]] before the rules were amended to disallow it. See ''Chess Curiosities'' by Krabb\u00e9. See also [[:de:Pam-Krabb\u00e9-Rochade]] for the diagrams online.|group=note}}) and then placing the rook on the last square that the king has just crossed. Castling is permissible under the following conditions:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=207&view=article |title=FIDE Laws of Chess, article 3.8.2 |publisher=World Chess Federation |work=fide.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805002105/https://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=207&view=article |archivedate=5 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* Neither the king nor the rook have previously moved during the game.\n* There cannot be any pieces between the king and the rook.\n* The king cannot be in check, nor can the king pass through squares that are under attack by enemy pieces, or move to a square where it would result in a check. Note that castling ''is'' permissible if the rook is attacked, or if the rook crosses a square that is attacked.\n\n===''En passant''===\n{{anchor|en passant}}\n{{Main|En passant}}\n[[File:ChessPawnSpecialMoves.gif|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Examples of pawn moves: <br />(''left'') [[Promotion (chess)|promotion]]; (''right'') ''[[en passant]]'']]\nWhen a pawn advances two squares from its starting position and there is an opponent's pawn on an adjacent file next to its destination square, then the opponent's pawn can capture it ''en passant'' (in passing), and move to the square the pawn passed over. This can only be done on the very next move, otherwise the right to do so is forfeit. For example, in the animated diagram, the black pawn advances two squares from g7 to g5, and the white pawn on f5 can take it via ''en passant'' on g6 (but only on White's next move).\n\n===Promotion===\n{{Main|Promotion (chess)}}\nWhen a pawn advances to the eighth rank, as a part of the move it is ''promoted'' and must be exchanged for the player's choice of queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. Usually, the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen, but in some cases another piece is chosen; this is called [[underpromotion]]. In the [[#En passant|animated diagram]], the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted to an allowed piece. There is no restriction placed on the piece that is chosen on promotion, so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game (for example, two queens).\n\n===Check===\n{{Main|Check (chess)}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tright\n|\n| | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | |\n| | |kd| | | | |\n| | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | |\n| | |rl| | | | |\n| | | | |kl| | |\n|The black king is in [[Check (chess)|check]] by the rook.}}\nWhen a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in ''[[Check (chess)|check]]''. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave the player's own king in check.\n\nIn casual games it is common to announce \"check\" when putting the opponent's king in check, but this is not required by the rules of the game, and is not usually done in tournaments.\n\n===End of the game===\n\n====Win====\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tright\n|\n| | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | |\n| | | | |bd|bd| |kd\n| | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | |kl\n|White is in [[checkmate]], being unable to escape attack by the black bishops.}}\nGames can be won in the following ways:\n* ''[[Checkmate]]'': The player whose turn it is to move is in check and has no legal move to escape check.\n* ''{{chessgloss|resign|Resignation}}'': Either player may resign, conceding the game to the opponent.<ref>Burgess (2000), p. 481</ref> It is usually considered poor etiquette to play on in a truly hopeless position, and for this reason high-level games rarely end in checkmate.\n* ''Win on time'': In games with a [[time control]], a player wins if the opponent runs out of time, even if the opponent has a much superior position, as long as the player still has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent.\n* ''Forfeit'': A player who cheats, or violates the rules of the game, or violates the rules specified for the particular tournament can be forfeited. In high-level tournaments, players have been forfeited for such things as arriving late for the game (even by a matter of seconds), receiving a call or text on a cell phone, refusing to undergo a drug test, refusing to undergo a body search for electronic devices, and unsporting behavior (such as refusing to shake the opponent's hand).\n\n====Draw====\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tright\n|\n| | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | |\n| | |ql| | | | |\n|kd| | | | | | |\n| | |kl| | | | |\n| | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | |\n|Black is not in check and has no legal move. The result is [[stalemate]].\n}}\nThere are several ways games can end in a [[Draw (chess)|draw]]:\n* ''[[Draw by agreement]]'': Draws are most commonly reached by mutual agreement between the players. The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw, make a move, then start the opponent's clock. Traditionally, players have been allowed to agree to a draw at any point in the game, occasionally even without playing a move; in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws, for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty.\n* ''[[Stalemate]]'': The player whose turn it is to move has no legal move and is not in check.\n* ''[[Threefold repetition]] of position'': This most commonly occurs when neither side is able to avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage. In this situation, either player can claim a draw; this requires the players to keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged. The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid. FIDE rules make no mention of [[perpetual check]]; this is merely a specific type of draw by threefold repetition.\n* ''[[Fifty-move rule]]'': If during the previous 50 moves no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made, either player can claim a draw. There are several known endgames where it is possible to force a mate but it requires more than 50 moves before a pawn move or capture is made; examples include some endgames with [[two knights endgame|two knights against a pawn]] and some [[pawnless chess endgame|pawnless endgames]] such as queen against two bishops. Historically, FIDE has sometimes revised the 50-move rule to make exceptions for these endgames, but these have since been repealed.  Some [[correspondence chess]] organizations do not enforce the fifty-move rule.{{refn|The 50 move rule is not applied at FICGS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ficgs.com/membership.html#chess |title=50 moves rules |accessdate=1 December 2009 |publisher=FICGS |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209034210/http://www.ficgs.com/membership.html#chess |archivedate=9 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>|group=note}}\n* ''Fivefold repetition of position'': Similar to the threefold-repetition rule, but in this case neither player needs to claim the draw; thus a tournament director can intervene and declare the game to be drawn. This is a relatively recent (2014) addition to the FIDE rules.\n* ''Seventy-five-move rule'': Similar to the fifty-move rule; however, if the final move in the sequence resulted in checkmate, this takes precedence. As with the fivefold-repetition rule, this applies independently of claims by the players, and allows a tournament director to intervene. This rule likewise is a recent addition to the FIDE rules.\n* ''{{chessgloss|Insufficient material}}'': If neither player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent; for example, if a player has only the king and a knight left, and the opponent has only the king left, checkmate is impossible and the game is drawn by this rule. On the other hand, if both players have a king and a knight left, there is a highly unlikely yet theoretical possibility of checkmate, so this rule does not apply.\n* ''Draw on time:'' In games with a [[time control]], the game is drawn if a player is out of time and the opponent has no theoretical possibility to checkmate the player.\n\n===Time control===\n[[File:Modern Day Chess Clocks.jpg|thumb|Modern chess clocks]]\nChess games may also be played with a [[time control]]. If a player's time runs out before the game is completed, the game is automatically lost (provided the opponent has [[Rules of chess#Timing|enough pieces left]] to deliver checkmate). The duration of a game ranges from long (or \"classical\") games which can take up to seven hours (even longer if [[adjournment (chess)|adjournments]] are permitted) to [[bullet chess]] (under 3&nbsp;minutes per player for the entire game). Intermediate between these are [[rapid chess]] games, lasting between 20&nbsp;minutes and two hours per game, a popular time control in amateur weekend tournaments.\n\nTime is controlled using a [[chess clock]] that has two displays, one for each player's remaining time.

FIDE, which has controlled the title since then (except for one interruption), ran a tournament of elite players. The winner of the [[World Chess Championship 1948|1948 tournament]], Russian [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], started an era of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] dominance in the chess world. Until the end of the Soviet Union, there was only one non-Soviet champion, American [[Bobby Fischer]] (champion 1972\u20131975).<ref>Kasparov (2003b), pp. 7\u20138</ref> Botvinnik revolutionized opening theory. Previously Black strove for equality, to neutralize White's [[first-move advantage in chess|first-move advantage]]. As Black, Botvinnik strove for the initiative from the beginning.<ref>Kasparov (2003b), p. 7</ref> In the previous informal system of World Championships, the current champion decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match. FIDE set up a new system of qualifying tournaments and matches. The world's strongest players were seeded into [[Interzonal]] tournaments, where they were joined by players who had qualified from Zonal tournaments. The leading finishers in these Interzonals would go on the \"[[Candidates Tournament|Candidates]]\" stage, which was initially a tournament, and later a series of knockout matches. The winner of the Candidates would then play the reigning champion for the title. A champion defeated in a match had a right to play a rematch a year later. This system operated on a three-year cycle. Botvinnik participated in championship matches over a period of fifteen years. He won the world championship tournament in 1948 and retained the title in tied matches in 1951 and 1954. In 1957, he lost to [[Vasily Smyslov]], but regained the title in a rematch in 1958. In 1960, he lost the title to the 23-year-old Latvian prodigy [[Mikhail Tal]], an accomplished [[Chess tactics|tactician]] and attacking player. Botvinnik again regained the title in a rematch in 1961.\n\nFollowing the 1961 event, FIDE abolished the automatic right of a deposed champion to a rematch, and the next champion, Armenian [[Tigran Petrosian]], a player renowned for his defensive and positional skills, held the title for two cycles, 1963\u20131969. His successor, [[Boris Spassky]] from Russia (champion 1969\u20131972), won games in both positional and sharp tactical style.<ref>Kasparov (2004a), pp. 5\u20136; Kasparov (2003b), p. 8</ref> The next championship, the so-called [[World Chess Championship 1972|Match of the Century]], saw the first non-Soviet challenger since World War II, American [[Bobby Fischer]], who defeated his Candidates opponents by unheard-of margins and clearly won the world championship match. In 1975, however, Fischer refused to defend his title against Soviet [[Anatoly Karpov]] when FIDE did not meet his demands, and Karpov obtained the title by default.<ref>Kasparov (2004b), pp. 5\u20136</ref> Fischer modernized many aspects of chess, especially by extensively preparing openings.<ref>Kasparov (2003a), p. 8</ref>\n\nKarpov defended his title twice against [[Viktor Korchnoi]] and dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with a string of tournament successes.<ref>Kasparov (2004b), pp. 5\u20136; Kasparov (2006), pp. 5\u20136</ref> Karpov's reign finally ended in 1985 at the hands of [[Garry Kasparov]], another Soviet player from [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]].

The pieces are identified by their initials. In English, these are K (King), Q (Queen), R (Rook), B (Bishop), and N (Knight; N is used to avoid confusion with King). For example, '''Qg5''' means \"queen moves to the g-file and the 5th rank\" (that is, to the square g5). Chess literature published in other languages may use different initials to indicate the pieces, or [[Algebraic notation (chess)#Figurine algebraic notation|figurine algebraic notation (FAN)]] may be used to avoid language difficulties. To resolve ambiguities, one more letter or number is added to indicate the file or rank from which the piece moved, e.g. '''Ngf3''' means \"knight from the g-file moves to the square f3\", and '''R1e2''' means \"rook on the first rank moves to e2\". The letter ''P'' for a pawn is not used, so that '''e4''' means \"pawn moves to the square e4\".\n\nIf the piece makes a capture, \"x\" is inserted before the destination square. Thus '''Bxf3''' means \"bishop captures on f3\". When a pawn makes a capture, the file from which the pawn departed is used in place of a piece initial, and ranks may be omitted if unambiguous. For example, '''exd5''' (pawn on the e-file captures the piece on d5) or '''exd''' (pawn on the e-file captures a piece somewhere on the d-file). Particularly in Germany, some publications have used \":\" rather than \"x\" to indicate a capture, but this is now rare. Some publications omit the capture symbol altogether, so that exd5 would be rendered simply as \"ed\".\n\nIf a pawn moves to its last rank, achieving promotion, the piece chosen is indicated after the move, for example '''e1Q''' or '''e1=Q'''. Castling is indicated by the special notations '''0-0''' for {{chessgloss|kingside}} castling and '''0-0-0''' for {{chessgloss|queenside}} castling. An ''en passant'' capture is sometimes marked with the notation \"e.p.\" A move that places the opponent's king in check usually has the notation \"+\" added. (The notation \"++\" for a [[double check]] is considered obsolete.) Checkmate can be indicated by \"#\". At the end of the game, \"1\u20130\" means \"White won\", \"0\u20131\" means \"Black won\", and \"\u00bd\u2013\u00bd\" indicates a draw.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=125&view=article |title=FIDE Laws of Chess |accessdate=4 September 2010 |publisher=FIDE |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205225438/http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=125&view=article |archivedate=5 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nChess moves can be annotated with [[punctuation (chess)|punctuation marks and other symbols]]. For example, \"!\" indicates a good move, \"!!\" an excellent move, \"?\" a mistake, \"??\" a blunder, \"!?\" an interesting move that may not be best, or \"?!\" a dubious move not easily refuted.<ref name=\"Hooper & Whyld 1992, p. 92\">Hooper & Whyld (1992), p. 92</ref>\n\n[[File:Scholars mate animation.gif|frame|left|\"[[Scholar's mate]]\"]]\nFor example, one variation of a simple trap known as the [[Scholar's mate]] (see animated diagram) can be recorded:\n:{{pad}}'''1. e4 e5 2. Qh5{{chesspunc|?!}} Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6{{chesspunc|??}} 4. Qxf7{{chessAN|#}} {{chessAN|1\u20130}}'''\n\nThe text-based [[Portable Game Notation]] (PGN), which is understood by chess software, is based on short form English language algebraic notation.\n\nUntil about 1980, the majority of English language chess publications used a form of [[descriptive notation]]. In descriptive notation, files are named according to the piece which occupies the back rank at the start of the game, and each square has two different names depending on whether it is from White's or Black's point of view. For example, the square known as \"e3\" in algebraic notation is \"K3\" (King's 3rd) from White's point of view, and \"K6\" (King's 6th) from Black's point of view. When recording captures, the captured piece is named rather than the square on which it is captured (except to resolve ambiguities). Thus, Scholar's mate is rendered in descriptive notation:\n:{{pad}}'''1. P-K4 P-K4 2. Q-R5?! N-QB3 3. B-B4 N-B3?? 4. QxBP# 1\u20130'''\n\nA few players still prefer descriptive notation, but it is no longer recognized by FIDE.\n\nAnother system is [[ICCF numeric notation]], recognized by the [[International Correspondence Chess Federation]] though its use is in decline. Squares are identified by numeric coordinates, for example a1 is \"11\" and h8 is \"88\". Moves are described by the \"from\" and \"to\" squares, and captures are not indicated. For example, the opening move 1.e4 is rendered as 1.5254. Castling is described by the king's move only, for example 5171 for White castling kingside, 5838 for Black castling queenside.\n\n==Strategy and tactics==\nChess strategy consists of setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game&nbsp;\u2013 for example, where to place different pieces&nbsp;\u2013 while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These two parts of the chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play. A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; then middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.\n\n===Fundamentals of tactics===\n{{Main|Chess tactics}}\n{{Chess diagram\n|tright\n|Botvinnik vs. Yudovich, 1933<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1031833 |title=Botvinnik vs. Yudovich, USSR Championship 1933 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110164157/http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1031833 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] |archivedate=10 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n|rd|  |bd|  |  |rd|  |\n|  |pd|  |nd|qd|  |bd|\n|  |nd|pd|  |pd|  |kd|pd\n|pd|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |pl|nl|  |  |\n|  |pl|  |  |bl|  |  |\n|  |  |ql|  |bl|pl|pl|pl\n|  |  |rl|rl|  |  |kl|\n|{{Hidden|multiline=y|ta1=left|fw1=normal|After [[Sacrifice (chess)|sacrificing]] a piece to expose Black's king, [[Mikhail Botvinnik|Botvinnik]] played 23.Bh5+ and [[Mikhail Yudovich|Yudovich]] resigned, as mate is inevitable.|23.Bh5+ and now:\n* 23...Kxh5 24.Ng3+ Kh4 25.Qe4+ Rf4 26.Qxf4{{chessAN|#}}\n* 23...Kf5 24.g4#\n* 23...Kh7 24.Nf6+ ([[double check]]) Kh8 25.Qh7#}}}}\nIn chess, tactics in general concentrate on short-term actions \u2013 so short-term that they can be calculated in advance by a human player or by a computer. The possible depth of calculation depends on the player's ability. In quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides, a deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical, while in \"tactical\" positions with a limited number of forced variations, strong players can calculate long sequences of moves.\n\nSimple one-move or two-move tactical actions \u2013 threats, exchanges of {{chessgloss|material}}, and double attacks&nbsp;\u2013 can be combined into more complicated [[Combination (chess)|combinations]], sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players.<ref name=\"Harding 2003, p. 70ff\">Harding (2003), pp. 70ff</ref> Theoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers; for example, [[Pin (chess)|pins]], [[Fork (chess)|forks]], [[Skewer (chess)|skewers]], [[Battery (chess)|batteries]], [[discovered attack]]s (especially discovered checks), [[zwischenzug]]s, [[Deflection (chess)|deflections]], [[Decoy (chess)|decoys]], [[Sacrifice (chess)|sacrifices]], [[Undermining (chess)|underminings]], [[Overloading (chess)|overloadings]], and [[Interference (chess)|interferences]].<ref>Harding (2003), pp. 8ff</ref>\n\nA forced variation that involves a sacrifice and usually results in a tangible gain is called a [[Combination (chess)|combination]].<ref name=\"Harding 2003, p. 70ff\"/> Brilliant combinations&nbsp;\u2013 such as those in the [[Immortal Game]]&nbsp;\u2013 are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers. A common type of chess exercise, aimed at developing players' skills, is showing players a position where a decisive combination is available and challenging them to find it.<ref>Burgess, Nunn, & Emms (2004), pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\n===Fundamentals of strategy===\n{{Main|Chess strategy}}\nChess strategy is concerned with evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term plans for the future play. During the evaluation, players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board, control of the center and centralization, the [[pawn structure]], king safety, and the control of key squares or groups of squares (for example, diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares).\n\nThe most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the [[Chess piece relative value|total value of pieces]] of both sides.<ref>Harding (2003), pp. 1\u20137</ref> The point values used for this purpose are based on experience; usually pawns are considered worth one point, knights and bishops about three points each, rooks about five points (the value difference between a rook and a bishop or knight being known as [[The exchange (chess)|the exchange]]), and queens about nine points. The king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined, since its checkmate loses the game. But in practical terms, in the endgame the king as a fighting piece is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but less powerful than a rook.<ref>Lasker (1934), p. 73</ref> These basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece (e.g. advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares), coordination between pieces (e.g. a pair of bishops usually coordinate better than a bishop and a knight), or the type of position (e.g. knights are generally better in {{chessgloss|closed game|closed positions}} with many pawns while bishops are more powerful in {{chessgloss|open game|open positions}}).<ref>Watson (1998), p. 163ff</ref>\n\n{| style=\"float:right;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|+ Example of underlying pawn structure\n|\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|rd|  |bd|  |rd|  |kd|\n|pd|pd|  |nd|  |pd|bd|pd\n|  |  |pd|rl|  |nd|pd|\n|  |  |  |  |pd|  |  |\n|  |  |pl|  |pl|  |  |\n|  |  |nl|  |bl|nl|  |pl\n|pl|pl|  |  |  |pl|pl|\n|  |  |kl|  |  |bl|  |rl\n| After 12...Re8 in Tarrasch\u2013Euwe...<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1006866 |title=Siegbert Tarrasch vs. Max Euwe, Bad Pistyan it, CZE 1922 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110122502/http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1006866 |archivedate=10 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }} (Java needed)</ref>}}\n|\n{{Chess diagram small\n| tright\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|pd|pd|  |  |  |pd|  |pd\n|  |  |pd|  |  |  |pd|\n|  |  |  |  |pd|  |  |\n|  |  |pl|  |pl|  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |pl\n|pl|pl|  |  |  |pl|pl|\n|  |  |  |  |  |   | |\n| ...and its pawn \"Rauzer formation\"}}\n|}\nAnother important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure (sometimes known as the pawn skeleton), or the configuration of pawns on the chessboard.<ref>Harding (2003), pp. 138ff</ref> Since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces, the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in the pawn structure, such as [[Isolated pawn|isolated]], [[Doubled pawns|doubled]], or [[backward pawn]]s and {{chessgloss|holes}}, once created, are often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset (for example, by the possibility of developing an attack).<ref>Evans (1958), pp. 22\u201367</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Phases==\n===Opening===\n{{Main|Chess opening}}\nA chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game (the \"opening moves\"). Recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as ''openings'' and have been given names such as the [[Ruy Lopez]] or [[Sicilian Defense]]. They are catalogued in reference works such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]]''. There are dozens of different openings, varying widely in character from quiet {{chessgloss|positional play}} (for example, the [[R\u00e9ti Opening]]) to very aggressive (the [[Latvian Gambit]]). In some opening lines, the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than 30 moves.<ref>Tamburro (2010), p. 18</ref> Professional players spend years studying openings and continue doing so throughout their careers, as [[Chess opening theory|opening theory]] continues to evolve.\n\nThe fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar:<ref>Tarrasch (1987)</ref>\n* ''Development'': This is the technique of placing the pieces (particularly bishops and knights) on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the game.\n* ''Control of the center'': Control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily, and can also have a cramping effect on the opponent.\n* ''King safety'': It is critical to keep the king safe from dangerous possibilities. A correctly timed castling can often enhance this.\n* ''[[Pawn structure]]'': Players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns, and pawn islands&nbsp;\u2013 and to force such weaknesses in the opponent's position.\n\nMost players and [[Chess theory|theoreticians]] consider that White, by virtue of the first move, [[First-move advantage in chess|begins the game with a small advantage]]. This initially gives White the [[Initiative (chess)|initiative]].<ref>Evans (1958), p. 175</ref> Black usually strives to neutralize White's advantage and achieve {{chessgloss|equality}}, or to develop {{chessgloss|dynamism|dynamic}} {{chessgloss|counterplay}} in an unbalanced position.\n\n===Middlegame===\n{{Main|Chess middlegame}}\n\nThe middlegame is the part of the game which starts after the opening. There is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame, but typically the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed. (Similarly, there is no clear transition from the middlegame to the endgame; see [[Chess endgame#The start of the endgame|start of the endgame]].) Because the opening theory has ended, players have to form plans based on the features of the position, and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position.<ref>Harding (2003), p. 32\u2013151</ref> The middlegame is the phase in which most [[Combination (chess)|combinations]] occur. Combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain. Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent's king. Some typical patterns have their own names; for example, the [[Boden's Mate]] or the [[Lasker - Bauer, Amsterdam, 1889|Lasker\u2013Bauer]] combination.<ref>Hooper & Whyld (1992), p. 86</ref>\n\nSpecific plans or strategic themes will often arise from particular groups of openings which result in a specific type of pawn structure. An example is the {{chessgloss|minority attack}}, which is the attack of queenside pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside. The study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middlegames.<ref>Silman (1998), pp. 202\u201305</ref>\n\nAnother important strategic question in the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transition into an endgame (i.e. {{chessgloss|simplification|simplify}}). Minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame, and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending. Not every reduction of material is good for this purpose; for example, if one side keeps a light-squared bishop and the opponent has a dark-squared one, the transformation into a [[Chess endgame#Bishop and pawn endings|bishops and pawns]] ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only, because an endgame with [[opposite-colored bishops endgame|bishops on opposite colors]] is likely to be a draw, even with an advantage of a pawn, or sometimes even with a two-pawn advantage.<ref>Hooper & Whyld (1992), p. 373</ref>\n\n===Endgame===\n{{Main|Chess endgame}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tright\n|Example of [[zugzwang]]\n|__|__|kd|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|pl|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|kl|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__\n|The side having to move is at a disadvantage.}}\nThe endgame (also ''end game'' or ''ending'') is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board. There are three main strategic differences between earlier stages of the game and the endgame:<ref>Harding (2003), pp. 187ff</ref>\n# Pawns become more important. Endgames often revolve around endeavors to [[Promotion (chess)|promote]] a pawn by advancing it to the furthest {{chessgloss|rank}}.\n# The king, which required safeguarding from checkmate in the middlegame, emerges as a strong piece in the endgame. It is often brought to the center of the board where it can protect its own pawns, attack enemy pawns, and hinder moves of the opponent's king.\n# [[Zugzwang]], disadvantageous since it forces a player to move, is often a factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game. In the example diagram, either side having the move is in zugzwang: Black to move must play 1...Kb7 allowing White to promote the pawn after 2.Kd7; White to move must permit a draw, either by 1.Kc6 [[stalemate]] or by losing the pawn after any other legal move.\n\nEndgames can be classified according to the type of pieces remaining on the board. [[Checkmate#Basic checkmates|Basic checkmates]] are positions in which one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces and can checkmate the opposing king, with the pieces working together with their king. For example, [[king and pawn endgame]]s involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides, and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns. Other more complicated endings are classified according to pieces on the board other than kings, such as \"[[rook and pawn versus rook]]\" endgames.\n{{clear}}\n==Place in culture==\n{{Main|Chess in the arts}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Meister der Manessischen Liederhandschrift 004.jpg|Noble chess players, Germany, {{circa|1320}}\nFile:UigChessmen SelectionOfKings.jpg|Two kings and two queens from the [[Lewis chessmen]] ([[British Museum]])\nFile:Qing Dynasty Chess pawns.jpg|19th-century decorative chess pawns, China ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]])\nFile:Large chess set.JPG|Large chess set in Franklin Square, Tasmania\nFile:Chess party with live figures, 1924.jpg|A chess party with live figures (in [[Bitola]], 1924)\n</gallery>\n\n===Pre-modern===\nIn the [[Middle Ages]] and during the [[Renaissance]], chess was a part of [[nobility|noble]] culture; it was used to teach war strategy and was dubbed the \"[[Chess or the King's Game|King's Game]]\".<ref>Vale (2001), pp. 170\u201399</ref> Gentlemen are \"to be meanly seene in the play at Chestes\", says the overview at the beginning of [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' (1528, English 1561 by Sir Thomas Hoby), but chess should not be a gentleman's main passion.

[[Benjamin Franklin]], in his article \"[[The Morals of Chess]]\" (1750), wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement; several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired and strengthened by it, so as to become habits ready on all occasions; for life is a kind of Chess, in which we have often points to gain, and competitors or adversaries to contend with, and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events, that are, in some degree, the effect of prudence, or the want of it. By playing at Chess then, we may learn:\n\n'''I. Foresight''', which looks a little into futurity, and considers the consequences that may attend an action [...]\n\n'''II. Circumspection''', which surveys the whole Chess-board, or scene of action: \u2013 the relation of the several Pieces, and their situations [...]\n\n'''III. Caution''', not to make our moves too hastily [...]<ref>Franklin (1779)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWith these or similar views, chess is taught to children in schools around the world today. Many schools host chess clubs, and there are many scholastic tournaments specifically for children. Tournaments are held regularly in many countries, hosted by organizations such as the [[United States Chess Federation]] and the National Scholastic Chess Foundation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nscfchess.org/nscfmiss.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230140133/http://www.nscfchess.org/nscfmiss.html |archivedate=30 December 2009 |title=National Scholastic Chess Foundation |accessdate=30 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Red King sleeping.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'': the Red King is snoring.

The creator is known as a [[chess composer]].<ref>Howard (1961)</ref> There are many types of chess problems; the two most important are:\n* ''{{chessprobgloss|directmate|Directmates}}'': White to move first and checkmate Black within a specified number of moves, against any defense. These are often referred to as \"mate in ''n''\" \u2013 for example \"mate in three\" (a ''three-mover''); two- and three-move problems are the most common. These usually involve positions that would be highly unlikely to occur in an actual game, and are intended to illustrate a particular ''{{chessprobgloss|theme}}'', usually requiring a surprising or counter-intuitive ''{{chessprobgloss|key}}'' move.<ref>Hooper & Whyld (1992), p. 110</ref>\n* ''[[Endgame study|Studies]]'': orthodox problems where the stipulation is that White to play must win or draw. Almost all studies are [[Chess endgame|endgame]] positions.<ref>Hooper & Whyld (1992), pp. 400\u201301</ref>\n\nChess composition is a distinct branch of chess sport, and tournaments exist for both the composition and solving of chess problems.<ref>Weenink (1926)</ref>\n\n===Example===\n{{Main|R\u00e9ti endgame study}}\n{{Chess diagram small\n|tright\n|Richard R\u00e9ti <br />''[[Ostrava|Ostrauer]] Morgenzeitung'', 1921\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |kl\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|kd|  |pl|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |pd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|White to move and draw\n}}\nThis is one of the most famous chess studies; it was published by [[Richard R\u00e9ti]] 4 December 1921.

Apart from World Champion, Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain. Before FIDE will confer the title on a player, the player must have an [[Elo rating system|Elo chess rating]] (see below) of at least 2500 at one time and three favorable results (called norms) in tournaments involving other grandmasters, including some from countries other than the applicant's. There are other milestones a player can achieve to attain the title, such as winning the World Junior Championship.\n* ''[[International Master]]'' (shortened as IM). The conditions are similar to GM, but less demanding. The minimum rating for the IM title is 2400.\n* ''[[FIDE Master]]'' (shortened as FM). The usual way for a player to qualify for the FIDE Master title is by achieving a FIDE rating of 2300 or more.\n* ''[[Candidate Master]]'' (shortened as CM). Similar to FM, but with a FIDE rating of at least 2200.\n\nAll the titles are open to men and women. Separate women-only titles, such as Woman Grandmaster (WGM), are available.

National chess organizations may also award titles, usually to the advanced players still under the level needed for international titles; an example is the [[chess expert]] title used in the United States.\n\nIn order to rank players, FIDE, [[International Correspondence Chess Federation|ICCF]], and national chess organizations use the [[Elo rating system]] developed by [[Arpad Elo]]. Elo is a [[Statistical model|statistical system]] based on the assumption that the chess performance of each player in his or her games is a random variable. Arpad Elo thought of a player's true skill as the average of that player's performance random variable, and showed how to estimate the average from results of player's games. The [[US Chess Federation]] implemented Elo's suggestions in 1960, and the system quickly gained recognition as being both fairer and more accurate than older systems; it was adopted by FIDE in 1970.{{refn|For the official process see {{cite web\n|title=02.

Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona \"[[the Tramp]]\" and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the [[film industry]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cousins|1p=72|2a1=Kemp|2pp=8, 22|3a1=Gunning|3p=41|4a1=Sarris|4p=139|5a1=Hansmeyer|5p=3}} His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the [[Victorian era]] until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.\n\nChaplin's childhood in [[London]] was one of poverty and hardship. As his father was absent and his mother struggled financially, he was sent to a [[workhouse]] twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring [[music hall]]s and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was signed to the prestigious [[Fred Karno]] company, which took him to America. Chaplin was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for [[Keystone Studios]]. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the [[Essanay Studios|Essanay]], [[Mutual Film|Mutual]], and [[First National Pictures|First National]] corporations. By 1918, he was one of the best-known figures in the world.\n\nIn 1919, Chaplin co-founded the distribution company [[United Artists]], which gave him complete control over his films. His first [[Feature length|feature-length]] was ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'' (1921), followed by ''[[A Woman of Paris]]'' (1923), ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' (1925), and ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]'' (1928). He refused to move to [[sound film]]s in the 1930s, instead producing ''[[City Lights]]'' (1931) and ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' (1936) without dialogue. Chaplin became increasingly political, and his next film, ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940), satirised [[Adolf Hitler]]. The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of [[Communism|communist]] sympathies, while his involvement in a [[paternity suit]] and marriages to much younger women caused scandal. An [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation was opened, and Chaplin was forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland. He abandoned the Tramp in his later films, which include ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'' (1947), ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' (1952), ''[[A King in New York]]'' (1957), and ''[[A Countess from Hong Kong]]'' (1967).\n\nChaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films. He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture. His films are characterised by [[slapstick]] combined with [[pathos]], typified in the Tramp's struggles against adversity. Many contain social and political themes, as well as autobiographical elements. In 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for his work, Chaplin received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Academy Award]] for \"the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century\". He continues to be held in high regard, with ''The Gold Rush'', ''City Lights'', ''Modern Times'', and ''The Great Dictator'' often ranked on industry lists of the greatest films of all time.\n\n==Biography==\n===1889\u20131913: Early years===\n\n====Background and childhood hardship====\nCharles Spencer Chaplin was born on 16 April 1889 to [[Hannah Chaplin]] (born Hannah Harriet Pedlingham Hill) and [[Charles Chaplin Sr]].

Kuriyama has identified serious underlying themes in the early comedies, such as greed (''The Gold Rush'') and loss (''The Kid'').{{sfn|Kuriyama|p=31}} Chaplin also touched on controversial issues: immigration (''The Immigrant'', 1917); illegitimacy (''The Kid'', 1921); and drug use (''Easy Street'', 1917).{{sfn|Mast|pp=83\u201392}} He often explored these topics ironically, making comedy out of suffering.{{sfn|Louvish|pp=137, 145}}\n\nSocial commentary was a feature of Chaplin's films from early in his career, as he portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor.{{sfn|Robinson|p=599}} Later, as he developed a keen interest in economics and felt obliged to publicise his views,{{sfn|Robinson|p=456}} Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films.{{sfn|Maland|1989|p=159}} ''Modern Times'' (1936) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions, ''The Great Dictator'' (1940) parodied [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] and ended in a speech against nationalism, ''Monsieur Verdoux'' (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and ''A King in New York'' (1957) attacked [[McCarthyism]].{{sfn|Larcher|pp=62\u201389}}\n\nSeveral of Chaplin's films incorporate autobiographical elements, and the psychologist [[Sigmund Freud]] believed that Chaplin \"always plays only himself as he was in his dismal youth\".{{sfn|Weissman|1999|pp=439\u2013445}} ''The Kid'' is thought to reflect Chaplin's childhood trauma of being sent into an orphanage,{{sfn|Weissman|1999|pp=439\u2013445}} the main characters in ''Limelight'' (1952) contain elements from the lives of his parents,{{sfn|Bloom|p=107}} and ''A King in New York'' references Chaplin's experiences of being shunned by the United States.{{sfn|Robinson|pp=588\u2013589}} Many of his sets, especially in street scenes, bear a strong similarity to Kennington, where he grew up. [[Stephen M. Weissman]] has argued that Chaplin's problematic relationship with his mentally ill mother was often reflected in his female characters and the Tramp's desire to save them.{{sfn|Weissman|1999|pp=439\u2013445}}\n\nRegarding the structure of Chaplin's films, the scholar [[Gerald Mast]] sees them as consisting of sketches tied together by the same theme and setting, rather than having a tightly unified storyline.{{sfn|Mast|pp=123\u2013128}} Visually, his films are simple and economic,{{sfnm|1a1=Louvish|1p=298|2a1=Robinson|2p=592}} with scenes portrayed as if set on a stage.{{sfnm|1a1=Epstein|1pp=84\u201385|2a1=Mast|2pp=83\u201392|3a1=Louvish|3p=185}} His approach to filming was described by the art director [[Eug\u00e8ne Louri\u00e9]]: \"Chaplin did not think in 'artistic' images when he was shooting. He believed that action is the main thing. The camera is there to photograph the actors\".{{sfn|Robinson|p=565}} In his autobiography, Chaplin wrote, \"Simplicity is best&nbsp;... pompous effects slow up action, are boring and unpleasant&nbsp;... The camera should not intrude.\"{{sfn|Chaplin|p=250}}  This approach has prompted criticism, since the 1940s, for being \"old fashioned\",{{sfnm|1a1=Brownlow|1p=91|2a1=Louvish|2p=298|3a1=Kamin|3p=35}} while the film scholar Donald McCaffrey sees it as an indication that Chaplin never completely understood film as a medium.{{sfn|McCaffrey|pp=82\u201395}} Kamin, however, comments that Chaplin's comedic talent would not be enough to remain funny on screen if he did not have an \"ability to conceive and direct scenes specifically for the film medium\".{{sfn|Kamin|p=29}}\n\n===Composing===\n[[File:Charlie Chaplin playing the cello 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|Chaplin playing the cello in 1915]]\n\nChaplin developed a passion for music as a child and taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello.{{sfnm|1a1=Robinson|1p=411|2a1=Louvish|2pp=17\u201318}} He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important,{{sfn|Robinson|pp=382}} and from ''A Woman of Paris'' onwards he took an increasing interest in this area.{{sfn|Robinson|p=411}} With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack \u2013 composed by himself \u2013 for ''City Lights'' (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films.{{sfn|Vance|2000|p=xiii}}\n\nAs Chaplin was not a trained musician, he could not read sheet music and needed the help of professional composers, such as [[David Raksin]], [[Raymond Rasch]] and [[Eric James (arranger)|Eric James]], when creating his scores. Musical directors were employed to oversee the recording process, such as [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]] for ''City Lights''.{{sfn|Slowik|p=133}} Although some critics have claimed that credit for his film music should be given to the composers who worked with him, Raksin \u2013 who worked with Chaplin on ''Modern Times'' \u2013 stressed Chaplin's creative position and active participation in the composing process.{{sfn|Raksin and Berg|pp=47\u201350}} This process, which could take months, would start with Chaplin describing to the composer(s) exactly what he wanted and singing or playing tunes he had improvised on the piano.{{sfn|Raksin and Berg|pp=47\u201350}} These tunes were then developed further in a close collaboration among the composer(s) and Chaplin.{{sfn|Raksin and Berg|pp=47\u201350}} According to film historian [[Jeffrey Vance]], \"although he relied upon associates to arrange varied and complex instrumentation, the musical imperative is his, and not a note in a Chaplin musical score was placed there without his assent.\"<ref name=\"VarietyVance\">Vance, Jeffrey (4 August 2003). \"Chaplin the Composer: An Excerpt from Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema\".

A country may be an independent [[sovereign state]] or part of a larger state,<ref>Jones, J. (1964). ''What Makes a Country? Human Events'', '''24'''(31), 14.</ref> as a non-[[sovereignty|sovereign]] or formerly sovereign [[political division]], or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated [[nation|people]] with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the [[League of Nations]] in 1937 and reaffirmed by the [[United Nations]] in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise{{clarify|date=April 2017}} of legal jurisdiction.{{CN|date=March 2018}}\n\n''Countries'' can refer both to sovereign states and to other political entities,<ref>{{cite AustLII|FCA|912|1997|litigants=Tjhe Kwet Koe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs |date=8 September 1997 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> while other times it can refer only to [[State (polity)|states]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/cs/politicalgeog/a/statenation.htm| title=Geography: Country, State, and Nation |accessdate=2008-11-12 |last=Rosenberg |first=Matt}}</ref> For example, the ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'' uses the word in its \"Country name\" field to refer to \"a wide variety of dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, [[uninhabited islands]], and other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent states\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html#T |title=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA|accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref><sup id=Note_1>[[#Notes|[Note 1]]]</sup>\n\n==Etymology and usage==\n<!-- ''Basically a country has a particular boundary on the surface of the earth through which one country can be separated from the other.'' Removed this addition: \"Do not seek narrowly to define the word country without first considering the range of dictionary definitions such as OED and Chambers (British); Macquarie (Australian); Webster (American).\" -->\n\nThe word ''country'' comes from [[Old French]] ''contr\u00e9e'', which derives from [[Vulgar Latin]] (''terra'') ''contrata'' (\"(land) lying opposite\"; \"(land) spread before\"), derived from ''contra'' (\"against, opposite\"). It most likely entered the English language after the [[Norman invasion of England|Franco-Norman invasion]] during the 11th century.\n\nIn English the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions, so that one sense, associated with the [[indefinite article]] \u2013 \"a country\" \u2013 through misuse and subsequent conflation is now a [[synonym]] for state, or a former [[sovereign state]], in the sense of sovereign territory or \"district, native land\".<ref>[[OED]], Country</ref> Areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such as the [[West Country]] in England, the [[Black Country]] (a heavily industrialized part of England), \"[[Constable Country]]\" (a part of [[East Anglia]] painted by [[John Constable]]), the \"big country\" (used in various contexts of the [[American West]]), \"coal country\" (used of parts of the US and elsewhere) and many other terms.<ref name=\"oed\">{{cite encyclopedia| editor = John Simpson, Edmund Weiner | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary| edition = 1971 compact | publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford, England| isbn = 0198611862}}</ref>\n\nThe equivalent terms in French and other [[Romance language]]s (''[[Pays (France)|pays]]'' and variants) have not carried the process of being identified with political sovereign states as far as the English \"country\", instead derived from, [[pagus]], which designated the territory controlled by a medieval [[count]], a title originally granted by the Roman Church. In many European countries the words are used for sub-divisions of the national territory, as in the [[States of Germany|German Bundesl\u00e4nder]], as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state. France has very many \"pays\" that are officially recognised at some level, and are either [[natural region]]s, like the [[Pays de Bray]], or reflect old political or economic entities, like the [[Pays de la Loire]].\n\nA version of \"country\" can be found in the modern [[French language]] as ''contr\u00e9e'', based on the word ''cuntr\u00e9e'' in [[Old French]],<ref name=\"oed\" /> that is used similarly to the word \"pays\" to define non-state regions, but can also be used to describe a political state in some particular cases. The modern Italian ''contrada'' is a word with its meaning varying locally, but usually meaning a [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] or similar small division of a town, or a village or hamlet in the countryside.\n\n==Sovereignty status==\n{{See also|List of sovereign states}}\n\nThe term \"country\" can refer to a [[sovereign state]]. There is no universal agreement on the number of \"countries\" in the world since a number of states have [[List of states with limited recognition|disputed sovereignty status]]. There are [[List of sovereign states|206 sovereign states]], of which 193 states are members of the [[United Nations]], two states have observer status at the U.N. (the [[Holy See]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]), and 11 other states are neither a member or observer at the U.N. All are defined as states by [[declarative theory of statehood]] and [[constitutive theory of statehood]]. The latest proclaimed state is [[South Sudan]] in 2011.\n\nAlthough not sovereign states, [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are [[Countries of the United Kingdom|countries]] (depending on context), which collectively form the [[United Kingdom]]\u2014a sovereign state that is commonly, but erroneously referred to as a country. The United Kingdom is a Union of four separate countries brought about by a series of International treaties and legislated for by several Acts of Union, the first of which being the [[Acts of Union 1707]] in both the English and Scottish parliaments. While a political Union was created, Scotland and England retained a distinct church, legal system and education system, as a result, the issue of Sovereignty is different in the two countries, in Scotland Sovereignty lies with the people, whereas in England Sovereignty lies with Parliament and the Monarch. [[Lord President of the Court of Session|Lord President]] ([[Thomas Cooper, 1st Baron Cooper of Culross|Lord Cooper]] stated that \"the principle of the unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish Constitutional Law\", and that legislation contrary to the Act of Union would not necessarily be regarded as constitutionally valid. <ref>{{cite book|last1=Loveland|first1=Ian|title=Constitutional Law, Administrative Law, and Human Rights: A Critical Introduction|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=2015|isbn=9780198709039|pages=43\u201347|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=y7S6BwAAQBAJ&pg=PA43#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Doherty|first1=Michael|title=Public Law|date=2016|publisher=Rutledge|isbn=1317206657|pages=198\u2013201|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=065TDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA198#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Barnett|first1=Hilaire|title=Constitutional & Administrative Law|date=2014|publisher=Rutledge|isbn=1317446224|pages=119\u2013123|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tzScBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA119#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"Lib of Congress\">{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/uk.php|title=Legal Research Guide: United Kingdom|publisher=[[Law Library of Congress]]|date=2009-07-23|accessdate=2013-03-29|quote=The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the collective name of four countries, England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of [[Zealand]]; another small portion of the city is located on [[Amager]], and is separated from [[Malm\u00f6]], Sweden, by the strait of [[\u00d8resund]]. The [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] connects the two cities by rail and road.\n\nOriginally a [[Vikings|Viking]] fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now [[Gammel Strand]], Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. After suffering from the effects of [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague]] and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] and founding of such cultural institutions as the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]]. After further disasters in the early 19th century when [[Horatio Nelson]] attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the [[Danish Golden Age]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the [[Second World War]], the [[Finger Plan]] fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the [[Culture of Denmark|cultural]], [[Economy of Denmark|economic]] and [[Politics of Denmark|governmental]] centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the [[service sector]], especially through initiatives in [[information technology]], [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[clean technology]]. Since the completion of the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]], Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of [[Scania]] and its largest city, Malm\u00f6, forming the [[\u00d8resund Region]]. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as [[Tivoli Gardens]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue, the [[Amalienborg]] and [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] palaces, [[Rosenborg Castle Gardens]], [[Frederik's Church]], and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. The largest lake of Denmark, [[Arres\u00f8]], lies around 27 miles (43 kilometers) northwest of the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]].\n\nCopenhagen is home to the [[University of Copenhagen]], the [[Technical University of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen Business School]] and the [[IT University of Copenhagen]]. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC K\u00f8benhavn]] and [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] football clubs. The annual [[Copenhagen Marathon]] was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.\n\nThe [[Copenhagen Metro]] launched in 2002 serves central Copenhagen while the [[S-train (Copenhagen)|Copenhagen S-train]] and [[Lokaltog]] ([[:da:Privatbane|private railway]]) and the [[Coast Line (Denmark)|Coast Line]] network serves and connects central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. To relieve traffic congestion, which is partly the result of increased traffic because of the [[Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link]] road and rail construction is planned because the narrow 9-9.5 mile [[isthmus]] between [[Roskilde Fjord]] and [[K\u00f8ge Bugt]] (K\u00f8ge Bay) forms a [[traffic bottleneck]]. The [[Copenhagen-Ringsted Line]] will relieve traffic congestion in the corridor between Roskilde and Copenhagen.\n\nServing roughly two million passengers a month, [[Copenhagen Airport|Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup]], is the busiest airport in the [[Nordic countries]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nCopenhagen's name reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation in [[Old Norse]], from which Danish descends, was '''Kaupmannah\u01ebfn''' [\u02e1kaupman\u02d0ah\u0252fn] (cf. modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''Kaupmannah\u00f6fn'' [\u02e1k\u02b0\u0276\u0265pman\u02d0ah\u0153pn], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Keypmannahavn''), meaning \"merchants' harbour\". By the time [[Old Danish]] was spoken, the capital was called '''K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn''', with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular [[sound change]]. An exact English equivalent would be \"[[Chapmen|chapman]]'s [[Harbor|haven]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|first=Oluf|last=Nielsen|title=Kj\u00f8benhavn i Middelalderen|publisher=G.E.C.

Excavations in [[Pilestr\u00e6de]] have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where [[Str\u00f8get]] meets [[R\u00e5dhuspladsen]].\n\nThese finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century.

Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]], it was finally forced to capitulate to [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] supported by Dutch shipping. [[Christoffer Valkendorff]], a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development.<ref name=khdsd/> The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states.\n\nDuring the reign of [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had dramatic growth as a city. On his initiative at the beginning of the 17th century, two important buildings were completed on [[Slotsholmen]]: the [[T\u00f8jhus Museum|T\u00f8jhus Arsenal]] and [[B\u00f8rsen]], the stock exchange. To foster international trade, the [[Danish East India Company|East India Company]] was founded in 1616. To the east of the city, inspired by Dutch planning, the king developed the district of [[Christianshavn]] with canals and ramparts. It was initially intended to be a fortified trading centre but ultimately became part of Copenhagen.<ref name=kher>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie/K%c3%b8benhavn_(Historie_-_Efter_Reformationen)|title=K\u00f8benhavns historie efter Reformationen|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=14 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> Christian IV also sponsored an array of ambitious building projects including [[Rosenborg Slot]] and the [[Rundet\u00e5rn]].{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} In 1658\u201359, the city withstood a siege by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] under [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X]] and successfully repelled [[Assault on Copenhagen (1659)|a major assault]].<ref name=kher/>\n\nBy 1661, Copenhagen had asserted its position as capital of Denmark and Norway.

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historian]] [[Plutarch]] discusses an argument between [[Chrysippus]] (3rd century BCE) and [[Hipparchus]] (2nd century BCE) of a rather delicate enumerative problem, which was later shown to be related to [[Schr\u00f6der\u2013Hipparchus number]]s.<ref>[[Richard P.

Works of [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Jacob Bernoulli]] and [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] became foundational in the emerging field. In modern times, the works of [[James Joseph Sylvester|J. J. Sylvester]] (late 19th century) and [[Percy Alexander MacMahon|Percy MacMahon]] (early 20th century) helped lay the foundation for [[Enumerative combinatorics|enumerative]] and [[algebraic combinatorics]]. [[Graph theory]] also enjoyed an explosion of interest at the same time, especially in connection with the [[four color problem]].\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, combinatorics enjoyed a rapid growth, which led to establishment of dozens of new journals and conferences in the subject.<ref>See [http://www.math.iit.edu/~kaul/Journals.html#CGT Journals in Combinatorics and Graph Theory]</ref> In part, the growth was spurred by new connections and applications to other fields, ranging from algebra to probability, from [[functional analysis]] to [[number theory]], etc.  These connections shed the boundaries between combinatorics and parts of mathematics and theoretical computer science, but at the same time led to a partial fragmentation of the field.\n\n== Approaches and subfields of combinatorics ==\n\n===Enumerative combinatorics===\n[[Image:Catalan 4 leaves binary tree example.svg|320px|right|thumb|Five [[binary tree]]s on three [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]], an example of [[Catalan number]]s.]]\n\n{{main|Enumerative combinatorics}}\n\nEnumerative combinatorics is the most classical area of combinatorics and concentrates on counting the number of certain combinatorial objects.  Although counting the number of elements in a set is a rather broad [[mathematical problem]], many of the problems that arise in applications have a relatively simple combinatorial description. [[Fibonacci numbers]] is the basic example of a problem in enumerative combinatorics.  The [[twelvefold way]] provides a unified framework for counting [[permutations]], [[combinations]] and [[Partition of a set|partitions]].\n\n===Analytic combinatorics===\n{{Main|Analytic combinatorics}}\n[[Analytic combinatorics]] concerns the enumeration of combinatorial structures using tools from [[complex analysis]] and [[probability theory]].  In contrast with enumerative combinatorics, which uses explicit combinatorial formulae and [[generating functions]] to describe the results, analytic combinatorics aims at obtaining [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic formulae]].\n\n=== Partition theory ===\n[[Image:Partition3D.svg|150px|right|thumb|A [[plane partition]].]]\n\n{{main|Partition (number theory)|l1=Partition theory}}\n\nPartition theory studies various enumeration and asymptotic problems related to [[integer partition]]s, and is closely related to [[q-series]], [[special functions]] and [[orthogonal polynomials]].  Originally a part of [[number theory]] and [[analysis]], it is now considered a part of combinatorics or an independent field.  It incorporates the [[Bijective proof|bijective approach]] and various tools in analysis and [[analytic number theory]], and has connections with [[statistical mechanics]].\n\n===Graph theory===\n[[Image:Petersen1 tiny.svg|thumb|150px|[[Petersen graph]].]]\n{{main|Graph theory}}\n\nGraphs are basic objects in combinatorics.  The questions range from counting (e.g., the number of graphs on ''n'' vertices with ''k'' edges) to structural (e.g., which graphs contain Hamiltonian cycles) to algebraic questions (e.g., given a graph ''G'' and two numbers ''x'' and ''y'', does the [[Tutte polynomial]] ''T''<sub>''G''</sub>(''x'',''y'') have a combinatorial interpretation?).  Although there are very strong connections between graph theory and combinatorics, these two are sometimes thought of as separate subjects.<ref>Sanders, Daniel P.; [http://www.math.gatech.edu/~sanders/graphtheory/writings/2-digit.html ''2-Digit MSC Comparison''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231163112/http://www.math.gatech.edu/~sanders/graphtheory/writings/2-digit.html |date=2008-12-31 }}</ref>  This is due to the fact that while combinatorial methods apply to many graph theory problems, the two are generally used to seek solutions to different problems.\n\n===Design theory===\n{{main|Combinatorial design}}\n\nDesign theory is a study of [[combinatorial design]]s, which are collections of subsets with certain [[Set intersection|intersection]] properties. [[Block design]]s are combinatorial designs of a special type. This area is one of the oldest parts of combinatorics, such as in [[Kirkman's schoolgirl problem]] proposed in 1850. The solution of the problem is a special case of a [[Steiner system]], which systems play an important role in the [[classification of finite simple groups]]. The area has further connections to [[coding theory]] and geometric combinatorics.\n\n===Finite geometry===\n{{main|Finite geometry}}\n\nFinite geometry is the study of [[Geometry|geometric systems]] having only a finite number of points. Structures analogous to those found in continuous geometries ([[Euclidean plane]], [[real projective space]], etc.) but defined combinatorially are the main items studied. This area provides a rich source of examples for [[Combinatorial design|design theory]]. It should not be confused with discrete geometry ([[combinatorial geometry]]).\n\n=== Order theory ===\n[[Image:Hasse diagram of powerset of 3.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Hasse diagram]] of the [[Power set|powerset]] of {x,y,z} ordered by [[Inclusion map|inclusion]].]]\n\n{{main|Order theory}}\n\nOrder theory is the study of [[partially ordered sets]], both finite and infinite.  Various examples of partial orders appear in [[abstract algebra|algebra]], geometry, number theory and throughout combinatorics and graph theory.  Notable classes and examples of partial orders include [[Lattice (order)|lattices]] and [[Boolean algebras]].\n\n===Matroid theory===\n{{main|Matroid theory}}\nMatroid theory abstracts part of [[geometry]].   It studies the properties of sets (usually, finite sets) of vectors in a [[vector space]] that do not depend on the particular coefficients in a [[linear independence|linear dependence]] relation.  Not only the structure but also enumerative properties belong to matroid theory.  Matroid theory was introduced by [[Hassler Whitney]] and studied as a part of order theory.  It is now an independent field of study with a number of connections with other parts of combinatorics.\n\n===Extremal combinatorics===\n{{main|Extremal combinatorics}}\n\nExtremal combinatorics studies extremal questions on [[set system]]s. The types of questions addressed in this case are about the largest possible graph which satisfies certain properties.  For example, the largest [[triangle-free graph]] on ''2n'' vertices is a [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K<sub>n,n</sub>''. Often it is too hard even to find the extremal answer ''f''(''n'') exactly and one can only give an [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic estimate]].\n\n[[Ramsey theory]] is another part of extremal combinatorics.  It states that any [[sufficiently large]] configuration will contain some sort of order. It is an advanced generalization of the [[pigeonhole principle]].\n\n===Probabilistic combinatorics===\n[[Image:Self avoiding walk.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Self-avoiding walk]] in a [[Lattice graph|square grid graph]].]]\n\n{{main|Probabilistic method}}\n\nIn probabilistic combinatorics, the questions are of the following type: what is the probability of a certain property for a random discrete object, such as a [[random graph]]? For instance, what is the average number of triangles in a random graph? Probabilistic methods are also used to determine the existence of combinatorial objects with certain prescribed properties (for which explicit examples might be difficult to find), simply by observing that the probability of randomly selecting an object with those properties is greater than 0. This approach (often referred to as ''the'' [[probabilistic method]]) proved highly effective in applications to extremal combinatorics and graph theory. A closely related area is the study of finite [[Markov chains]], especially on combinatorial objects. Here again probabilistic tools are used to estimate the [[Markov chain mixing time|mixing time]].\n\nOften associated with [[Paul Erd\u0151s]], who did the pioneering work on the subject, probabilistic combinatorics was traditionally viewed as a set of tools to study problems in other parts of combinatorics. However, with the growth of applications to [[analysis of algorithms]] in [[computer science]], as well as classical probability, [[Additive number theory|additive]] and [[probabilistic number theory]], the area recently grew to become an independent field of combinatorics.\n\n===Algebraic combinatorics===\n[[Image:Young diagram for 541 partition.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Young diagram]] of a [[Partition (number theory)|partition]] (5,4,1).]]\n{{main|Algebraic combinatorics}}\n\nAlgebraic combinatorics is an area of [[mathematics]] that employs methods of [[abstract algebra]], notably [[group theory]] and [[representation theory]], in various combinatorial contexts and, conversely, applies combinatorial techniques to problems in [[abstract algebra|algebra]]. Algebraic combinatorics is continuously expanding its scope, in both topics and techniques, and can be seen as the area of mathematics where the interaction of combinatorial and algebraic methods is particularly strong and significant.\n\n===Combinatorics on words===\n[[Image:Morse-Thue sequence.gif|thumb|right|210px|Construction of a [[Thue\u2013Morse sequence|Thue\u2013Morse infinite word]].]]\n\n{{main|Combinatorics on words}}\n\nCombinatorics on words deals with [[formal language]]s.  It  arose independently within several branches of mathematics, including [[number theory]], [[group theory]] and [[probability]]. It has applications to enumerative combinatorics, [[fractal analysis]], [[theoretical computer science]], [[automata theory]] and [[linguistics]].  While many applications are new, the classical [[Chomsky\u2013Sch\u00fctzenberger hierarchy]] of classes of [[formal grammar]]s is perhaps the best-known result in the field.\n\n===Geometric combinatorics===\n[[Image:Icosahedron.svg|150px|thumb|right|An [[icosahedron]].]]\n\n{{main|Geometric combinatorics}}\n\nGeometric combinatorics is related to [[Convex geometry|convex]] and [[discrete geometry]], in particular [[polyhedral combinatorics]].  It asks, for example, how many faces of each dimension a [[convex polytope]] can have.  [[Metric geometry|Metric]] properties of polytopes play an important role as well, e.g. the   [[Cauchy's theorem (geometry)|Cauchy theorem]] on the rigidity of convex polytopes.  Special polytopes are also considered, such as [[permutohedron|permutohedra]], [[associahedron|associahedra]] and [[Birkhoff polytope]]s.  We should note that [[combinatorial geometry]] is an old fashioned name for discrete geometry.\n\n===Topological combinatorics===\n[[Image:Collier-de-perles-rouge-vert.svg|150px|thumb|right|[[Necklace splitting problem|Splitting a necklace]] with two cuts.]]\n{{main|Topological combinatorics}}\n\nCombinatorial analogs of concepts and methods in [[topology]] are used to study [[graph coloring]], [[fair division]], [[partition of a set|partitions]], [[partially ordered set]]s, [[decision tree]]s, [[necklace problem]]s and [[discrete Morse theory]].  It should not be confused with [[combinatorial topology]] which is an older name for [[algebraic topology]].\n\n===Arithmetic combinatorics===\n{{main|Arithmetic combinatorics}}\n\nArithmetic combinatorics arose out of the interplay between [[number theory]], combinatorics, [[ergodic theory]] and [[harmonic analysis]]. It is about combinatorial estimates associated with arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). [[Additive number theory]] (sometimes also called additive combinatorics) refers to the special case when only the operations of addition and subtraction are involved.  One important technique in arithmetic combinatorics is the [[ergodic theory]] of [[dynamical system]]s.\n\n===Infinitary combinatorics===\n{{main|Infinitary combinatorics}}\n\nInfinitary combinatorics, or combinatorial set theory, is an extension of ideas in combinatorics to infinite sets.  It is a part of [[set theory]], an area of [[mathematical logic]], but uses tools and ideas from both set theory and extremal combinatorics.\n\n[[Gian-Carlo Rota]] used the name ''continuous combinatorics''<ref>[http://faculty.uml.edu/dklain/cpc.pdf ''Continuous and profinite combinatorics'']</ref> to describe [[geometric probability]], since there are many analogies between ''counting'' and ''measure''.\n\n== Related fields ==\n[[Image:Kissing-3d.png|150px|right|thumb|[[kissing number|Kissing spheres]] are connected to both [[coding theory]] and [[discrete geometry]].]]\n\n=== Combinatorial optimization ===\n[[Combinatorial optimization]] is the study of optimization on discrete and combinatorial objects. It started as a part of combinatorics and graph theory, but is now viewed as a branch of applied mathematics and computer science, related to [[operations research]], [[Analysis of algorithms|algorithm theory]] and [[computational complexity theory]].\n\n=== Coding theory ===\n[[Coding theory]] started as a part of design theory with early combinatorial constructions of [[error-correcting code]]s. The main idea of the subject is to design efficient and reliable methods of data transmission. It is now a large field of study, part of [[information theory]].\n\n=== Discrete and computational geometry ===\n[[Discrete geometry]] (also called combinatorial geometry) also began as a part of combinatorics, with early results on [[convex polytope]]s and [[kissing number]]s.  With the emergence of applications of discrete geometry to [[computational geometry]], these two fields partially merged and became a separate field of study.  There remain many connections with geometric and topological combinatorics, which themselves can be viewed as outgrowths of the early discrete geometry.\n\n===Combinatorics and dynamical systems===\n[[Combinatorics and dynamical systems|Combinatorial aspects of dynamical systems]] is another emerging field.  Here dynamical systems can be defined on combinatorial objects.  See for example \n[[graph dynamical system]].\n\n===Combinatorics and physics===\nThere are increasing interactions between [[combinatorics and physics]], particularly [[statistical physics]]. Examples include an exact solution of the [[Ising model]], and a connection between the [[Potts model]] on one hand, and the [[chromatic polynomial|chromatic]] and [[Tutte polynomial]]s on the other hand.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Discrete mathematics}}\n* [[Combinatorial biology]]\n* [[Combinatorial chemistry]]\n* [[Combinatorial data analysis]]\n* [[Combinatorial game theory]]\n* [[Combinatorial group theory]]\n* [[List of combinatorics topics]]\n* [[Phylogenetics]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Bj\u00f6rner, Anders; and Stanley, Richard P.; (2010); [http://www-math.mit.edu/~rstan/papers/comb.pdf ''A Combinatorial Miscellany'']\n* B\u00f3na, Mikl\u00f3s; (2011); [http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/8027 ''A Walk Through Combinatorics (3rd Edition)'']. {{ISBN|978-981-4335-23-2}}, {{ISBN|978-981-4460-00-2}}(pbk)\n* Graham, Ronald L.; Groetschel, Martin; and Lov\u00e1sz, L\u00e1szl\u00f3; eds.

A course in calculus is a gateway to other, more advanced courses in mathematics devoted to the study of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] and limits, broadly called [[mathematical analysis]]. Calculus has historically been called \"the calculus of [[infinitesimal]]s\", or \"infinitesimal calculus\". The term ''calculus'' (plural ''calculi'') is also used for naming specific methods of calculation or notation as well as some theories, such as [[propositional calculus]], [[Ricci calculus]], [[calculus of variations]], [[lambda calculus]], and [[process calculus]].\n\n== History ==\n<!--\nAttention: leave dates as they are. We're not really that bothered, as the majority of Wikipedia dates state \"BC\".

Calculations of [[volume]] and [[area]], one goal of integral calculus, can be found in the [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptian]] [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus|Moscow papyrus]] ([[13th dynasty]], {{circa|1820}}&nbsp;BC), but the formulas are simple instructions, with no indication as to method, and some of them lack major components.<ref>Morris Kline, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-OsRDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Mathematical thought from ancient to modern times]'', Vol. I</ref>\n\nFrom the age of [[Greek mathematics]], [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] ({{circa|408\u2013355}}&nbsp;BC) used the [[method of exhaustion]], which foreshadows the concept of the limit, to calculate areas and volumes, while [[Archimedes]] ({{circa|287\u2013212}}&nbsp;BC) [[Archimedes' use of infinitesimals|developed this idea further]], inventing [[heuristics]] which resemble the methods of integral calculus.<ref>Archimedes, ''Method'', in ''The Works of Archimedes'' {{isbn|978-0-521-66160-7}}</ref>\n\nThe [[method of exhaustion]] was later discovered independently in [[Chinese mathematics|China]] by [[Liu Hui]] in the 3rd century AD in order to find the area of a circle.<ref>{{cite journal\n|series=Chinese studies in the history and philosophy of science and technology|volume=130|title=A comparison of Archimdes' and Liu Hui's studies of circles|first1=Liu|last1=Dun|first2=Dainian|last2=Fan|first3=Robert Sonn\u00e9|last3=Cohen|publisher=Springer|year=1966|isbn=0-7923-3463-9|page=279|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jaQH6_8Ju-MC}},[https://books.google.com/books?id=jaQH6_8Ju-MC&pg=PA279 Chapter , p. 279]</ref> In the 5th century AD, [[Zu Gengzhi]], son of [[Zu Chongzhi]], established a method<ref>{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Victor J.|title=A history of mathematics|date=2008|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=0-321-38700-7|pages=203|edition=3rd}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals|edition=3|first1=Dennis G.|last1=Zill|first2=Scott|last2=Wright|first3=Warren S.|last3=Wright|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|year=2009|isbn=0-7637-5995-3|page=xxvii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3Hk4Uhb1Z0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=R3Hk4Uhb1Z0C&pg=PR27 Extract of page 27]</ref> that would later be called [[Cavalieri's principle]] to find the volume of a [[sphere]].\n\n=== Medieval ===\nIn the Middle East, Hasan Ibn al-Haytham, Latinized as [[Alhazen]] ({{c.|lk=no|965|1040}}&nbsp;{{sc|ce}}) derived a formula for the sum of [[fourth power]]s.

The ideas were similar to Archimedes' in ''[[The Method of Mechanical Theorems|The Method]]'', but this treatise is believed to have been lost in the 13th century, and was only rediscovered in the early 20th century, and so would have been unknown to Cavalieri. Cavalieri's work was not well respected since his methods could lead to erroneous results, and the infinitesimal quantities he introduced were disreputable at first.\n\nThe formal study of calculus brought together Cavalieri's infinitesimals with the [[calculus of finite differences]] developed in Europe at around the same time. [[Pierre de Fermat]], claiming that he borrowed from [[Diophantus]], introduced the concept of [[adequality]], which represented equality up to an infinitesimal error term.<ref>[[Andr\u00e9 Weil]]: Number theory.

In his works, Newton rephrased his ideas to suit the mathematical idiom of the time, replacing calculations with infinitesimals by equivalent geometrical arguments which were considered beyond reproach. He used the methods of calculus to solve the problem of planetary motion, the shape of the surface of a rotating fluid, the oblateness of the earth, the motion of a weight sliding on a [[cycloid]], and many other problems discussed in his ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687). In other work, he developed series expansions for functions, including fractional and irrational powers, and it was clear that he understood the principles of the [[Taylor series]]. He did not publish all these discoveries, and at this time infinitesimal methods were still considered disreputable.\n\n[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] was the first to state clearly the rules of calculus.]]\n\nThese ideas were arranged into a true calculus of infinitesimals by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who was originally accused of [[plagiarism]] by Newton.<ref name=leib>Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm.

His contribution was to provide a clear set of rules for working with infinitesimal quantities, allowing the computation of second and higher derivatives, and providing the [[product rule]] and [[chain rule]], in their differential and integral forms. Unlike Newton, Leibniz paid a lot of attention to the formalism, often spending days determining appropriate symbols for concepts.\n\nToday, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] are usually both given credit for independently inventing and developing calculus. Newton was the first to apply calculus to general [[physics]] and Leibniz developed much of the notation used in calculus today. The basic insights that both Newton and Leibniz provided were the laws of differentiation and integration, second and higher derivatives, and the notion of an approximating polynomial series. By Newton's time, the fundamental theorem of calculus was known.\n\nWhen Newton and Leibniz first published their results, there was [[Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy|great controversy]] over which mathematician (and therefore which country) deserved credit. Newton derived his results first (later to be published in his ''[[Method of Fluxions]]''), but Leibniz published his \"[[Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis]]\" first. Newton claimed Leibniz stole ideas from his unpublished notes, which Newton had shared with a few members of the [[Royal Society]]. This controversy divided English-speaking mathematicians from continental European mathematicians for many years, to the detriment of English mathematics.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} A careful examination of the papers of Leibniz and Newton shows that they arrived at their results independently, with Leibniz starting first with integration and Newton with differentiation.  It is Leibniz, however, who gave the new discipline its name. Newton called his calculus \"[[Method of fluxions|the science of fluxions]]\".\n\nSince the time of Leibniz and Newton, many mathematicians have contributed to the continuing development of calculus. One of the first and most complete works on both infinitesimal and [[integral calculus]] was written in 1748 by [[Maria Gaetana Agnesi]].<ref>{{cite book |title=A Biography of Maria Gaetana Agnesi, an Eighteenth-century Woman Mathematician |edition=illustrated |first1=Antonella |last1=Cupillari |publisher=Edwin Mellen Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7734-5226-8 |page=iii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=urEfAQAAIAAJ&q=most+complete|contributor-last=Allaire|contributor-first=Patricia R.|contribution=Foreword}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/agnesi.htm| title=Maria Gaetana Agnesi| first=Elif| last=Unlu|date=April 1995| publisher   =[[Agnes Scott College]]}}</ref>\n[[File:Maria Gaetana Agnesi.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Maria Gaetana Agnesi]]]]\n\n=== Foundations ===\nIn calculus, ''foundations'' refers to the [[Rigorous#Mathematical rigour|rigorous]] development of the subject from [[axiom]]s and definitions.  In early calculus the use of [[infinitesimal]] quantities was thought unrigorous, and was fiercely criticized by a number of authors, most notably [[Michel Rolle]] and [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]]. Berkeley famously described infinitesimals as the [[ghosts of departed quantities]] in his book ''[[The Analyst]]'' in 1734.  Working out a rigorous foundation for calculus occupied mathematicians for much of the century following Newton and Leibniz, and is still to some extent an active area of research today.\n\nSeveral mathematicians, including [[Colin Maclaurin|Maclaurin]], tried to prove the soundness of using infinitesimals, but it would not be until 150 years later when, due to the work of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] and [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], a way was finally found to avoid mere \"notions\" of infinitely small quantities.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Russell |first= Bertrand |authorlink= Bertrand Russell |year= 1946 |title= [[A History of Western Philosophy|History of Western Philosophy]] |location= London |publisher= [[George Allen & Unwin Ltd]] |page= [https://archive.org/stream/westernphilosoph035502mbp#page/n857/mode/2up 857] |quote= The great mathematicians of the seventeenth century were optimistic and anxious for quick results; consequently they left the foundations of analytical geometry and the infinitesimal calculus insecure. Leibniz believed in actual infinitesimals, but although this belief suited his metaphysics it had no sound basis in mathematics. Weierstrass, soon after the middle of the nineteenth century, showed how to establish the calculus without infinitesimals, and thus at last made it logically secure. Next came Georg Cantor, who developed the theory of continuity and infinite number. \"Continuity\" had been, until he defined it, a vague word, convenient for philosophers like Hegel, who wished to introduce metaphysical muddles into mathematics. Cantor gave a precise significance to the word, and showed that continuity, as he defined it, was the concept needed by mathematicians and physicists. By this means a great deal of mysticism, such as that of Bergson, was rendered antiquated. }}</ref> The foundations of differential and integral calculus had been laid. In Cauchy's ''[[Cours d'Analyse]]'', we find a broad range of foundational approaches, including a definition of [[continuous function|continuity]] in terms of infinitesimals, and a (somewhat imprecise) prototype of an [[(\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit]] in the definition of differentiation.<ref>{{cite book |first=Judith V. |last=Grabiner |title=The Origins of Cauchy's Rigorous Calculus |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |year=1981 |isbn=0-387-90527-8 }}</ref> In his work Weierstrass formalized the concept of [[Limit of a function|limit]]<!--correct link?--> and eliminated infinitesimals (although his definition can actually validate [[nilsquare]] infinitesimals). Following the work of Weierstrass, it eventually became common to base calculus on limits instead of infinitesimal quantities, though the subject is still occasionally called \"infinitesimal calculus\". [[Bernhard Riemann]] used these ideas to give a precise definition of the integral. It was also during this period that the ideas of calculus were generalized to [[Euclidean space]] and the [[complex plane]].\n\nIn modern mathematics, the foundations of calculus are included in the field of [[real analysis]], which contains full definitions and [[mathematical proof|proof]]s of the theorems of calculus.  The reach of calculus has also been greatly extended. [[Henri Lebesgue]] invented [[measure theory]] and used it to define integrals of all but the most [[Pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] functions.  [[Laurent Schwartz]] introduced [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]s, which can be used to take the derivative of any function whatsoever.\n\nLimits are not the only rigorous approach to the foundation of calculus. Another way is to use [[Abraham Robinson]]'s [[non-standard analysis]]. Robinson's approach, developed in the 1960s, uses technical machinery from [[mathematical logic]] to augment the real number system with [[infinitesimal]] and [[Infinity|infinite]] numbers, as in the original Newton-Leibniz conception. The resulting numbers are called [[hyperreal number]]s, and they can be used to give a Leibniz-like development of the usual rules of calculus. There is also [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]], which differs from non-standard analysis in that it mandates neglecting higher power infinitesimals during derivations.\n\n=== Significance ===\nWhile many of the ideas of calculus had been developed earlier in [[Greek mathematics|Greece]], [[Chinese mathematics|China]], [[Indian mathematics|India]], [[Islamic mathematics|Iraq, Persia]], and [[Japanese mathematics|Japan]], the use of calculus began in Europe, during the 17th century, when [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] built on the work of earlier mathematicians to introduce its basic principles. The development of calculus was built on earlier concepts of instantaneous motion and area underneath curves.\n\nApplications of differential calculus include computations involving [[velocity]] and [[acceleration]], the [[slope]] of a curve, and [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]]. Applications of integral calculus include computations involving area, [[volume]], [[arc length]], [[center of mass]], [[work (physics)|work]], and [[pressure]]. More advanced applications include [[power series]] and [[Fourier series]].\n\nCalculus is also used to gain a more precise understanding of the nature of space, time, and motion. For centuries, mathematicians and philosophers wrestled with paradoxes involving [[division by zero]] or sums of infinitely many numbers. These questions arise in the study of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and area. The [[ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] gave several famous examples of such [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]]. Calculus provides tools, especially the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] and the [[infinite series]], that resolve the paradoxes.\n\n== Principles ==\n\n=== Limits and infinitesimals ===\n{{Main|Limit of a function|Infinitesimal}}\nCalculus is usually developed by working with very small quantities. Historically, the first method of doing so was by [[infinitesimal]]s. These are objects which can be treated like real numbers but which are, in some sense, \"infinitely small\".  For example, an infinitesimal number could be greater than 0, but less than any number in the sequence 1, 1/2, 1/3, ... and thus less than any positive [[real number]]. From this point of view, calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating infinitesimals.  The symbols '''<math>dx</math>''' and <math>dy</math> were taken to be infinitesimal, and the derivative <math>dy/dx</math> was simply their ratio.\n\nThe infinitesimal approach fell out of favor in the 19th century because it was difficult to make the notion of an infinitesimal precise. However, the concept was revived in the 20th century with the introduction of [[non-standard analysis]] and [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]], which provided solid foundations for the manipulation of infinitesimals.\n\nIn the late 19th century, infinitesimals were replaced within academia by the [[epsilon, delta]] approach to [[Limit of a function|limit]]s. Limits describe the value of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] at a certain input in terms of its values at nearby inputs. They capture small-scale behavior in the context of the [[real number|real number system]]. In this treatment, calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating certain limits. Infinitesimals get replaced by very small numbers, and the infinitely small behavior of the function is found by taking the limiting behavior for smaller and smaller numbers. Limits were thought to provide a more rigorous foundation for calculus, and for this reason they became the standard approach during the twentieth century.\n\n=== Differential calculus ===\n{{Main|Differential calculus}}\n[[File:Tangent derivative calculusdia.svg|thumb|300px|Tangent line at {{math|(''x'', ''f''(''x''))}}. The derivative {{math|''f\u2032''(''x'')}} of a curve at a point is the slope (rise over run) of the line tangent to that curve at that point.]]\n\nDifferential calculus is the study of the definition, properties, and applications of the [[derivative]] of a function. The process of finding the derivative is called ''differentiation''. Given a function and a point in the domain, the derivative at that point is a way of encoding the small-scale behavior of the function near that point. By finding the derivative of a function at every point in its domain, it is possible to produce a new function, called the ''derivative function'' or just the ''derivative'' of the original function. In formal terms, the derivative is a [[linear operator]] which takes a function as its input and produces a second function as its output. This is more abstract than many of the processes studied in elementary algebra, where functions usually input a number and output another number. For example, if the doubling function is given the input three, then it outputs six, and if the squaring function is given the input three, then it outputs nine. The derivative, however, can take the squaring function as an input. This means that the derivative takes all the information of the squaring function\u2014such as that two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen, and so on\u2014and uses this information to produce another function. The function produced by deriving the squaring function turns out to be the doubling function.\n\nIn more explicit terms the \"doubling function\" may be denoted by {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}} and the \"squaring function\" by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}. The \"derivative\" now takes the function {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, defined by the expression \"{{math|''x''<sup>2</sup>}}\", as an input, that is all the information\u2014such as that two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen, and so on\u2014and uses this information to output another function, the function {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}}, as will turn out.\n\nThe most common symbol for a derivative is an [[apostrophe]]-like mark called [[prime (symbol)|prime]]. Thus, the derivative of a function called {{math|''f''}} is denoted by {{math|''f\u2032''}}, pronounced \"f prime\". For instance, if {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is the squaring function, then {{math|''f\u2032''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}} is its derivative (the doubling function {{math|''g''}} from above). This notation is known as [[Lagrange's notation]].\n\nIf the input of the function represents time, then the derivative represents change with respect to time. For example, if {{math|''f''}} is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output, then the derivative of {{math|''f''}} is how the position is changing in time, that is, it is the [[velocity]] of the ball.\n\nIf a function is [[linear function|linear]] (that is, if the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of the function is a straight line), then the function can be written as {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''mx'' + ''b''}}, where {{math|''x''}} is the independent variable, {{math|''y''}} is the dependent variable, {{math|''b''}} is the ''y''-intercept, and:\n\n:<math>m= \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}= \\frac{\\text{change in } y}{\\text{change in } x} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}.</math>\n\nThis gives an exact value for the slope of a straight line. If the graph of the function is not a straight line, however, then the change in {{math|''y''}} divided by the change in {{math|''x''}} varies. Derivatives give an exact meaning to the notion of change in output with respect to change in input. To be concrete, let {{math|''f''}} be a function, and fix a point {{math|''a''}} in the domain of {{math|''f''}}. {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} is a point on the graph of the function. If {{math|''h''}} is a number close to zero, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is a number close to {{math|''a''}}. Therefore, {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}} is close to {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}. The slope between these two points is\n\n:<math>m = \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{(a+h) - a} = \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nThis expression is called a ''[[difference quotient]]''. A line through two points on a curve is called a ''secant line'', so {{math|''m''}} is the slope of the secant line between {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}. The secant line is only an approximation to the behavior of the function at the point {{math|''a''}} because it does not account for what happens between {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''a'' + ''h''}}. It is not possible to discover the behavior at {{math|''a''}} by setting {{math|''h''}} to zero because this would require [[dividing by zero]], which is undefined. The derivative is defined by taking the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] as {{math|''h''}} tends to zero, meaning that it considers the behavior of {{math|''f''}} for all small values of {{math|''h''}} and extracts a consistent value for the case when {{math|''h''}} equals zero:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0}{f(a+h) - f(a)\\over{h}}.</math>\n\nGeometrically, the derivative is the slope of the [[tangent line]] to the graph of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}}. The tangent line is a limit of secant lines just as the derivative is a limit of difference quotients. For this reason, the derivative is sometimes called the slope of the function {{math|''f''}}.\n\nHere is a particular example, the derivative of the squaring function at the input 3. Let {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} be the squaring function.\n\n[[File:Sec2tan.gif|thumb|300px|The derivative {{math|''f\u2032''(''x'')}} of a curve at a point is the slope of the line tangent to that curve at that point. This slope is determined by considering the limiting value of the slopes of secant lines. Here the function involved (drawn in red) is {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x''}}. The tangent line (in green) which passes through the point {{nowrap|(\u22123/2, \u221215/8)}} has a slope of 23/4. Note that the vertical and horizontal scales in this image are different.]]\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}f'(3) &=\\lim_{h \\to 0}{(3+h)^2 - 3^2\\over{h}} \\\\\n&=\\lim_{h \\to 0}{9 + 6h + h^2 - 9\\over{h}} \\\\\n&=\\lim_{h \\to 0}{6h + h^2\\over{h}} \\\\\n&=\\lim_{h \\to 0} (6 + h) \\\\\n&= 6\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe slope of the tangent line to the squaring function at the point (3, 9) is 6, that is to say, it is going up six times as fast as it is going to the right. The limit process just described can be performed for any point in the domain of the squaring function. This defines the ''derivative function'' of the squaring function, or just the ''derivative'' of the squaring function for short. A computation similar to the one above shows that the derivative of the squaring function is the doubling function.\n\n=== Leibniz notation ===\n{{Main|Leibniz's notation}}\n\nA common notation, introduced by Leibniz, for the derivative in the example above is\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\ny&=x^2 \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dx}&=2x.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nIn an approach based on limits, the symbol {{math|{{sfrac|''dy''|''dx''}}}} is to be interpreted not as the quotient of two numbers but as a shorthand for the limit computed above. Leibniz, however, did intend it to represent the quotient of two infinitesimally small numbers, {{math|''dy''}} being the infinitesimally small change in {{math|''y''}} caused by an infinitesimally small change {{math|''dx''}} applied to {{math|''x''}}. We can also think of {{math|{{sfrac|''d''|''dx''}}}} as a differentiation operator, which takes a function as an input and gives another function, the derivative, as the output. For example:\n:<math>\n\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2)=2x.\n</math>\n\nIn this usage, the {{math|''dx''}} in the denominator is read as \"with respect to {{math|''x''}}\". Another example of correct notation could be:\n\n<math>\\begin{align}\ng(t) = t^2 + 2t + 4 \\\\ \\\\\n{d \\over dt}g(t) = 2t + 2\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nEven when calculus is developed using limits rather than infinitesimals, it is common to manipulate symbols like {{math|''dx''}} and {{math|''dy''}} as if they were real numbers; although it is possible to avoid such manipulations, they are sometimes notationally convenient in expressing operations such as the [[total derivative]].\n\n=== Integral calculus ===\n{{Main|Integral}}\n\n''Integral calculus'' is the study of the definitions, properties, and applications of two related concepts, the ''indefinite integral'' and the ''definite integral''. The process of finding the value of an integral is called ''integration''. In technical language, integral calculus studies two related [[linear operator]]s.\n\nThe ''indefinite integral'', also known as the ''[[antiderivative]]'', is the inverse operation to the derivative. {{math|''F''}} is an indefinite integral of {{math|''f''}} when {{math|''f''}} is a derivative of {{math|''F''}}.  (This use of lower- and upper-case letters for a function and its indefinite integral is common in calculus.)\n\nThe ''definite integral'' inputs a function and outputs a number, which gives the algebraic sum of areas between the graph of the input and the [[x-axis]]. The technical definition of the definite integral involves the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a sum of areas of rectangles, called a [[Riemann sum]].\n\nA motivating example is the distances traveled in a given time.\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{Distance} = \\mathrm{Speed} \\cdot \\mathrm{Time}</math>\n\nIf the speed is constant, only multiplication is needed, but if the speed changes, a more powerful method of finding the distance is necessary. One such method is to approximate the distance traveled by breaking up the time into many short intervals of time, then multiplying the time elapsed in each interval by one of the speeds in that interval, and then taking the sum (a [[Riemann sum]]) of the approximate distance traveled in each interval. The basic idea is that if only a short time elapses, then the speed will stay more or less the same. However, a Riemann sum only gives an approximation of the distance traveled. We must take the limit of all such Riemann sums to find the exact distance traveled.\n\n[[File:Constant velocity.png|left|thumb|Constant velocity]]\n[[File:Integral as region under curve.svg|right|thumb|280px|Integration can be thought of as measuring the area under a curve, defined by {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, between two points (here {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}).]]\nWhen velocity is constant, the total distance traveled over the given time interval can be computed by multiplying velocity and time.  For example, travelling a steady 50&nbsp;mph for 3 hours results in a total distance of 150 miles.  In the diagram on the left, when constant velocity and time are graphed, these two values form a rectangle with height equal to the velocity and width equal to the time elapsed.  Therefore, the product of velocity and time also calculates the rectangular area under the (constant) velocity curve.  This connection between the area under a curve and distance traveled can be extended to ''any'' irregularly shaped region exhibiting a fluctuating velocity over a given time period. If {{math|''f''(''x'')}} in the diagram on the right represents speed as it varies over time, the distance traveled (between the times represented by {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}) is the area of the shaded region&nbsp;{{math|''s''}}.\n\nTo approximate that area, an intuitive method would be to divide up the distance between {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} into a number of equal segments, the length of each segment represented by the symbol {{math|\u0394''x''}}. For each small segment, we can choose one value of the function {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. Call that value {{math|''h''}}. Then the area of the rectangle with base {{math|\u0394''x''}} and height {{math|''h''}} gives the distance (time {{math|\u0394''x''}} multiplied by speed {{math|''h''}}) traveled in that segment.   Associated with each segment is the average value of the function above it, {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''h''}}. The sum of all such rectangles gives an approximation of the area between the axis and the curve, which is an approximation of the total distance traveled. A smaller value for {{math|\u0394''x''}} will give more rectangles and in most cases a better approximation, but for an exact answer we need to take a limit as {{math|\u0394''x''}} approaches zero.\n\nThe symbol of integration is <math>\\int </math>, an [[long s|elongated ''S'']] (the ''S'' stands for \"sum\"). The definite integral is written as:\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\, dx.</math>\n\nand is read \"the integral from ''a'' to ''b'' of ''f''-of-''x'' with respect to ''x''.\"  The Leibniz notation {{math|''dx''}} is intended to suggest dividing the area under the curve into an infinite number of rectangles, so that their width {{math|\u0394''x''}} becomes the infinitesimally small {{math|''dx''}}.  In a formulation of the calculus based on limits, the notation\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b \\cdots\\, dx</math>\n\nis to be understood as an operator that takes a function as an input and gives a number, the area, as an output. The terminating differential, {{math|''dx''}}, is not a number, and is not being multiplied by {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, although, serving as a reminder of the {{math|\u0394''x''}} limit definition, it can be treated as such in symbolic manipulations of the integral. Formally, the differential indicates the variable over which the function is integrated and serves as a closing bracket for the integration operator.\n\nThe indefinite integral, or antiderivative, is written:\n\n:<math>\\int f(x)\\, dx.</math>\n\nFunctions differing by only a constant have the same derivative, and it can be shown that the antiderivative of a given function is actually a family of functions differing only by a constant. Since the derivative of the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''C''}}, where {{math|''C''}} is any constant, is {{math|''y\u2032'' {{=}} 2''x''}}, the antiderivative of the latter given by:\n:<math>\\int 2x\\, dx = x^2 + C.</math>\nThe unspecified constant {{math|''C''}} present in the indefinite integral or antiderivative is known as the [[constant of integration]].\n\n=== Fundamental theorem ===\n{{Main|Fundamental theorem of calculus}}\nThe [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] states that differentiation and integration are inverse operations. More precisely, it relates the values of antiderivatives to definite integrals. Because it is usually easier to compute an antiderivative than to apply the definition of a definite integral, the fundamental theorem of calculus provides a practical way of computing definite integrals. It can also be interpreted as a precise statement of the fact that differentiation is the inverse of integration.\n\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus states: If a function {{math|''f''}} is [[continuous function|continuous]] on the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} and if {{math|''F''}} is a function whose derivative is {{math|''f''}} on the interval {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}}, then\n\n:<math>\\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\,dx = F(b) - F(a).</math>\n\nFurthermore, for every {{math|''x''}} in the interval {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}},\n\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx}\\int_a^x f(t)\\, dt = f(x).</math>\n\nThis realization, made by both [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], who based their results on earlier work by [[Isaac Barrow]], was key to the proliferation of analytic results after their work became known. The fundamental theorem provides an algebraic method of computing many definite integrals\u2014without performing limit processes\u2014by finding formulas for [[antiderivative]]s. It is also a prototype solution of a [[differential equation]]. Differential equations relate an unknown function to its derivatives, and are ubiquitous in the sciences.\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|right|The [[logarithmic spiral]] of the [[Nautilus|Nautilus shell]] is a classical image used to depict the growth and change related to calculus.]]\nCalculus is used in every branch of the physical sciences, [[actuarial science]], computer science, statistics, engineering, economics, business, medicine, [[demography]], and in other fields wherever a problem can be [[mathematical model|mathematically modeled]] and an [[optimization (mathematics)|optimal]] solution is desired. It allows one to go from (non-constant) rates of change to the total change or vice versa, and many times in studying a problem we know one and are trying to find the other.\n\n[[Physics]] makes particular use of calculus; all concepts in [[classical mechanics]] and [[electromagnetism]] are related through calculus. The [[mass]] of an object of known [[density]], the [[moment of inertia]] of objects, as well as the total energy of an object within a conservative field can be found by the use of calculus. An example of the use of calculus in mechanics is [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]]: historically stated it expressly uses the term \"change of motion\" which implies the derivative saying ''The'' '''change''' ''of momentum of a body is equal to the resultant force acting on the body and is in the same direction.'' Commonly expressed today as Force&nbsp;=&nbsp;Mass&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;acceleration, it implies differential calculus because acceleration is the time derivative of velocity or second time derivative of trajectory or spatial position. Starting from knowing how an object is accelerating, we use calculus to derive its path.\n\nMaxwell's theory of [[electromagnetism]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] are also expressed in the language of differential calculus. Chemistry also uses calculus in determining reaction rates and radioactive decay. In biology, population dynamics starts with reproduction and death rates to model population changes.\n\nCalculus can be used in conjunction with other mathematical disciplines. For example, it can be used with [[linear algebra]] to find the \"best fit\" linear approximation for a set of points in a domain. Or it can be used in [[probability theory]] to determine the probability of a continuous random variable from an assumed density function. In [[analytic geometry]], the study of graphs of functions, calculus is used to find high points and low points (maxima and minima), slope, [[Concave function|concavity]] and [[inflection points]].\n\n[[Green's Theorem]], which gives the relationship between a line integral around a simple closed curve C and a double integral over the plane region D bounded by C, is applied in an instrument known as a [[planimeter]], which is used to calculate the area of a flat surface on a drawing. For example, it can be used to calculate the amount of area taken up by an irregularly shaped flower bed or swimming pool when designing the layout of a piece of property.\n\n[[Discrete Green's Theorem]], which gives the relationship between a double integral of a function around a simple closed rectangular curve ''C'' and a linear combination of the antiderivative's values at corner points along the edge of the curve, allows fast calculation of sums of values in rectangular domains.  For example, it can be used to efficiently calculate sums of rectangular domains in images, in order to rapidly extract features and detect object; another algorithm that could be used is the [[summed area table]].\n\nIn the realm of medicine, calculus can be used to find the optimal branching angle of a blood vessel so as to maximize flow. From the decay laws for a particular drug's elimination from the body, it is used to derive dosing laws. In nuclear medicine, it is used to build models of radiation transport in targeted tumor therapies.\n\nIn economics, calculus allows for the determination of maximal profit by providing a way to easily calculate both [[marginal cost]] and [[marginal revenue]].\n\nCalculus is also used to find approximate solutions to equations; in practice it is the standard way to solve differential equations and do root finding in most applications. Examples are methods such as [[Newton's method]], [[fixed point iteration]], and [[linear approximation]]. For instance, spacecraft use a variation of the [[Euler method]] to approximate curved courses within zero gravity environments.\n\n==Varieties==\nOver the years, many reformulations of calculus have been investigated for different purposes.\n\n=== Non-standard calculus ===\n{{Main|Non-standard calculus}}\nImprecise calculations with infinitesimals were widely replaced with the rigorous [[(\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit]] starting in the 1870s. Meanwhile, calculations with infinitesimals persisted and often led to correct results. This led [[Abraham Robinson]] to investigate if it were possible to develop a number system with infinitesimal quantities over which the theorems of calculus were still valid. In 1960, building upon the work of [[Edwin Hewitt]] and [[Jerzy \u0141o\u015b]], he succeeded in developing [[non-standard analysis]]. The theory of non-standard analysis is rich enough to be applied in many branches of mathematics.  As such, books and articles dedicated solely to the traditional theorems of calculus often go by the title [[non-standard calculus]].\n\n=== Smooth infinitesimal analysis ===\n{{Main|Smooth infinitesimal analysis}}\nThis is another reformulation of the calculus in terms of [[infinitesimal]]s. Based on the ideas of [[F. W. Lawvere]] and employing the methods of [[category theory]], it views all functions as being [[continuous function|continuous]] and incapable of being expressed in terms of [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] entities.

As such constructive mathematics also rejects the [[law of excluded middle]].

Development of [[civilization]] has been closely linked with [[History of telecommunication|progress]] in [[telecommunication]].\n\n==Non-verbal==\n{{Main|Nonverbal communication}}\n[[Nonverbal communication]] describes the processes of conveying a type of information in the form of non-linguistic representations. Examples of nonverbal communication include [[haptic communication]], [[Chronemics|chronemic communication]], [[gestures]], [[body language]], [[facial expressions]], [[eye contact]], and how one dresses. Nonverbal communication also relates to the intent of a message. Examples of intent are voluntary, intentional movements like shaking a hand or winking, as well as involuntary, such as sweating.<ref>{{cite web|title = Types of Body Language|url = http://www.simplybodylanguage.com/types-of-body-language.html|website = Simplybodylanguage.com|access-date = 2016-02-08}}</ref> Speech also contains nonverbal elements known as [[paralanguage]], e.g. [[rhythm (linguistics)|rhythm]], [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], [[tempo of speech|tempo]], and [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]]. It affects communication most at the subconscious level and establishes trust. Likewise, written texts include nonverbal elements such as handwriting style, the spatial arrangement of words and the use of [[emoticons]] to convey emotion.\n\nNonverbal communication demonstrates one of [[Paul Watzlawick|Paul Wazlawick's]] laws: you cannot not communicate. Once proximity has formed awareness, living creatures begin interpreting any signals received.<ref>Wazlawick, Paul (1970's) opus</ref> Some of the functions of nonverbal communication in humans are to complement and illustrate, to reinforce and emphasize, to replace and substitute, to control and regulate, and to contradict the denovative message.\n\nNonverbal cues are heavily relied on to express communication and to interpret others\u2019 communication and can replace or substitute verbal messages. However, non-verbal communication is ambiguous. When verbal messages contradict non-verbal messages, observation of non-verbal behaviour is relied on to judge another\u2019s attitudes and feelings, rather than assuming the truth of the verbal message alone.\n\nThere are several reasons as to why non-verbal communication plays a vital role in communication:\n\n\u201cNon-verbal communication is omnipresent.\u201d <ref>(Burgoon, J., Guerrero, L., Floyd, K., (2010). Nonverbal Communication, Taylor & Francis. p.3 )</ref> They are included in every single communication act. To have total communication, all non-verbal channels such as the body, face, voice, appearance, touch, distance, timing, and other environmental forces must be engaged during face-to-face interaction. Written communication can also have non-verbal attributes. E-mails and web chats allow an individual\u2019s the option to change text font colours, stationary, emoticons, and capitalization in order to capture non-verbal cues into a verbal medium.\n\n\u201cNon-verbal behaviours are multifunctional.\u201d <ref name=\"Burgoon et al., p.4\">(Burgoon et al., p.4)</ref> Many different non-verbal channels are engaged at the same time in communication acts and allow the chance for simultaneous messages to be sent and received.\n\n\u201cNon-verbal behaviours may form a universal language system.\u201d <ref name=\"Burgoon et al., p.4\"/> Smiling, crying, pointing, caressing, and glaring are non-verbal behaviours that are used and understood by people regardless of nationality. Such non-verbal signals allow the most basic form of communication when verbal communication is not effective due to language barriers.\n\n==Verbal==\n[[Verbal communication]] is the spoken or written conveyance of a message. Human [[language]] can be defined as a [[system]] of [[symbol]]s (sometimes known as [[lexeme]]s) and the [[grammar]]s ([[wikt:rule|rules]]) by which the symbols are manipulated. The word \"language\" also refers to common properties of languages. [[Language acquisition|Language learning]] normally occurs most intensively during human childhood. Most of the thousands of human languages use patterns of [[sound]] or [[gesture]] for symbols which enable communication with others around them. Languages tend to share certain properties, although there are exceptions. There is [[language or dialect|no defined line]] between a language and a [[dialect]]. [[Constructed language]]s such as [[Esperanto]], [[programming language]]s, and various mathematical formalism is not necessarily restricted to the properties shared by human languages.\n\nAs previously mentioned, language can be characterized as symbolic. Charles Ogden and I.A Richards developed The Triangle of Meaning model to explain the symbol (the relationship between a word), the referent (the thing it describes), and the meaning (the thought associated with the word and the thing).\n\nThe properties of language are governed by rules. Language follows phonological rules (sounds that appear in a language), syntactic rules (arrangement of words and punctuation in a sentence), semantic rules (the agreed upon meaning of words), and pragmatic rules (meaning derived upon context).\n\nThe meanings that are attached to words can be literal, or otherwise known as denotative; relating to the topic being discussed, or, the meanings take context and relationships into account, otherwise known as connotative; relating to the feelings, history, and power dynamics of the communicators.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Sherry Devereaux |last2=Lennox-Terrion |first2=Jenepher |last3=Ahmed |first3=Rukhsana |last4=Jaya |first4=Peruvemba |year=2014 |title=Communication in Everyday Life: Personal and Professional Contexts |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=HZFXngEACAAJ |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Canada |pages=464 |isbn=9780195449280}}</ref>\n\nContrary to popular belief, [[signed languages]] of the world (e.g., [[American Sign Language]]) are considered to be verbal communication because their sign vocabulary, grammar, and other linguistic structures abide by all the necessary classifications as spoken languages. There are however, nonverbal elements to signed languages, such as the speed, intensity, and size of signs that are made. A signer might sign \"yes\" in response to a question, or they might sign a sarcastic-large slow yes to convey a different nonverbal meaning. The sign yes is the verbal message while the other movements add nonverbal meaning to the message.\n\n==Written communication and its historical development==\nOver time the forms of and ideas about communication have evolved through the continuing progression of technology. Advances include communications psychology and media psychology, an emerging field of study.\n\nThe progression of written communication can be divided into three \"information communication revolutions\":<ref>{{cite web|author=Xin Li|title=Complexity Theory \u2013 the Holy Grail of 21st Century|url=http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~xinl/complexity.html|publisher=Lane Dept of CSEE, West Virginia University|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130815234045/http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~xinl/complexity.html|archivedate=2013-08-15|df=}}</ref>\n# Written communication first emerged through the use of pictographs. The [[pictogram]]s were made in stone, hence written communication was not yet mobile. Pictograms began to develop standardized and simplified forms.\n# The next step occurred when writing began to appear on [[paper]], papyrus, clay, wax, and other media with commonly shared writing systems, leading to adaptable [[alphabet]]s. Communication became mobile.\n# The final stage is characterized by the transfer of information through controlled waves of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (i.e., radio, microwave, infrared) and other [[Signal (electrical engineering)|electronic signals]].\n\nCommunication is thus a process by which meaning is assigned and conveyed in an attempt to create shared understanding. Gregory Bateson called it \"the replication of tautologies in the universe.<ref>Bateson, Gregory (1960) Steps to an Ecology of Mind</ref> This process, which requires a vast repertoire of skills in [[interpersonal]] processing, listening, observing, speaking, questioning, analyzing, gestures, and evaluating enables [[collaboration]] and [[cooperation]].<ref>{{cite web| title=communication| work=The office of superintendent of Public Instruction| location=Washington}}</ref>\n\n==Business==\n{{Main|Business communication}}\nBusiness communication is used for a wide variety of activities including, but not limited to: strategic communications planning, media relations, public relations (which can include social media, broadcast and written communications, and more), brand management, reputation management, speech-writing, customer-client relations, and internal/employee communications.\n\nCompanies with limited resources may choose to engage in only a few of these activities, while larger organizations may employ a full spectrum of communications. Since it is difficult to develop such a broad range of skills, communications professionals often specialize in one or two of these areas but usually have at least a working knowledge of most of them. By far, the most important qualifications communications professionals can possess are excellent writing ability, good 'people' skills, and the capacity to think critically and strategically.\n\n==Political==\nCommunication is one of the most relevant tools in political strategies, including persuasion and [[propaganda]]. In mass media research and online media research, the effort of the strategist is that of getting a precise decoding, avoiding \"message reactance\", that is, message refusal. The reaction to a message is referred also in terms of approach to a message, as follows:\n* In \"radical reading\" the audience rejects the meanings, values, and viewpoints built into the text by its makers. Effect: message refusal.\n* In \"dominant reading\", the audience accepts the meanings, values, and viewpoints built into the text by its makers. Effect: message acceptance.\n* In \"subordinate reading\" the audience accepts, by and large, the meanings, values, and worldview built into the text by its makers. Effect: obey to the message.<ref>Danesi, Marcel (2009), Dictionary of Media and Communications. M.E.Sharpe, Armonk, New York.</ref>\nHolistic approaches are used by communication campaign leaders and communication strategists in order to examine all the options, \"actors\" and channels that can generate change in the [[semiotic]] landscape, that is, change in [[perceptions]], change in [[credibility]], change in the \"[[memetic]] background\", change in the image of movements, of candidates, players and managers as perceived by key influencers that can have a role in generating the desired \"end-state\".\n\nThe modern political communication field is highly influenced by the framework and practices of \"information operations\" doctrines that derive their nature from strategic and military studies. According to this view, what is really relevant is the concept of acting on the Information  Environment. The information environment is the aggregate of individuals, organizations, and systems that collect, process, disseminate, or act on information. This environment consists of three interrelated dimensions, which continuously interact with individuals, organizations, and systems. These dimensions are known as physical, informational, and cognitive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army (2012). Information Operations. Joint Publication 3-13.

H., & West, R. L. (2013). ''Perspectives on family communication''. Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill.</ref> The main goal of family communication is to understand the interactions of family and the pattern of behaviors of family members in different circumstances. Open and honest communication creates an atmosphere that allows family members to express their differences as well as love and admiration for one another. It also helps to understand the feelings of one another.\n\nFamily communication study looks at topics such as family rules, family roles or family dialectics and how those factors could affect the communication between family members. Researchers develop theories to understand communication behaviors. Family communication study also digs deep into certain time periods of family life such as marriage, parenthood or divorce and how communication stands in those situations. It is important for family members to understand communication as a trusted way which leads to a well constructed family.\n\n==Interpersonal==\nIn simple terms, [[interpersonal communication]] is the communication between one person and another (or others). It is often referred to as face-to-face communication between two (or more) people. Both verbal and nonverbal communication, or [[body language]], play a part in how one person understands another. In verbal interpersonal communication there are two types of messages being sent: a content message and a relational message. Content messages are messages about the topic at hand and relational messages are messages about the relationship itself.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Interpersonal Communication Seventh Edition|last=Trenholm|first=Sarah|last2=Jensen|first2=Arthur|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=360\u2013361}}</ref> This means that relational messages come across in ''how'' one says something and it demonstrates a person\u2019s feelings, whether positive or negative, towards the individual they are talking to, indicating not only how they feel about the topic at hand, but also how they feel about their relationship with the other individual.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere are many different aspects of [[interpersonal communication]] including:\n\n* Audiovisual Perception of Communication Problems.<ref>Barkhuysen, P., Krahmer, E., Swerts, M., (2004) Audiovisual Perception of Communication Problems, ISCA Archive http://www.isca-speech.org/archive</ref> The concept follows the idea that our words change what form they take based on the stress level or urgency of the situation. It also explores the concept that stuttering during speech shows the audience that there is a problem or that the situation is more stressful.\n* The Attachment Theory.<ref>Bretherton, I., (1992) The Origins of Attachment Theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, Developmental Psychology, 28, 759-775</ref> This is the combined work of John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth (Ainsworth & Bowlby, 1991) This theory follows the relationships that builds between a mother and child, and the impact it has on their relationships with others.\n* Emotional Intelligence and Triggers.<ref>Mazza, J., Emotional Triggers, MABC, CPC</ref> Emotional Intelligence focuses on the ability to monitor ones own emotions as well as those of others. Emotional Triggers focus on events or people that tend to set off intense, emotional reactions within individuals.\n* Attribution Theory.<ref>Bertram, M., (2004) How the Mind Explains Behavior: Folk Explanations, Meaning, and Social Interaction, MIT Press, {{ISBN|978-0-262-13445-3}}</ref> This is the study of how individuals explain what causes different events and behaviors.\n* The Power of Words (Verbal communications).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/a-primer-on-communication-studies/s05-listening.html |title=Listening |website=2012books.lardbucket.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref> Verbal communication focuses heavily on the power of words, and how those words are said. It takes into consideration tone, volume, and choice of words.\n* Nonverbal Communication. It focuses heavily on the setting that the words are conveyed in, as well as the physical tone of the words.\n* Ethics in Personal Relations.<ref>Lipthrott, D., What IS Relationship? What is Ethical Partnership?</ref> It is about a space of mutual responsibility between two individuals, it\u2019s about giving and receiving in a relationship. This theory is explored by Dawn J. Lipthrott in the article What IS Relationship? What is Ethical Partnership?\n* Deception in Communication.<ref>Hearn, J., (2006) Interpersonal Deception Theory: Ten Lessons for Negotiators</ref> This concept goes into that everyone lies, and how this can impact relationships. This theory is explored by James Hearn in his article Interpersonal Deception Theory: Ten Lessons for Negotiators\n* Conflict in Couples.<ref>Lenhart, A., Duggan, M., (2014) Couples, the Internet, and Social Media</ref> This focuses on the impact that social media has on relationships, as well as how to communicate through conflict. This theory is explored by Amanda Lenhart and Maeve Duggan in their paper Couples, the Internet, and Social Media\n\n==Barriers to effectiveness ==\nBarriers to effective communication can retard or distort the message or intention of the message being conveyed. This may result in failure of the communication process or cause an effect that is undesirable. These include filtering, selective perception, information overload, emotions, language, silence, communication apprehension, gender differences and political correctness<ref>Robbins, S., Judge, T., Millett, B., & Boyle, M. (2011). Organisational Behaviour. 6th ed. Pearson, French's Forest, NSW p315-317.</ref>\n\nThis also includes a lack of expressing \"knowledge-appropriate\" communication, which occurs when a person uses ambiguous or complex legal words, medical jargon, or descriptions of a situation or environment that is not understood by the recipient.\n* '''Physical barriers-''' Physical barriers are often due to the nature of the environment. An example of this is the natural barrier which exists if staff is located in different buildings or on different sites. Likewise, poor or outdated equipment, particularly the failure of management to introduce new technology, may also cause problems. Staff shortages are another factor which frequently causes communication difficulties for an organization.\n* '''System design-''' [[System design]] faults refer to problems with the structures or systems in place in an organization. Examples might include an organizational structure which is unclear and therefore makes it confusing to know whom to communicate with. Other examples could be inefficient or inappropriate information systems, a lack of supervision or training, and a lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities which can lead to staff being uncertain about what is expected of them.\n* '''Attitudinal barriers-''' Attitudinal barriers come about as a result of problems with staff in an organization. These may be brought about, for example, by such factors as poor management, lack of consultation with employees, personality conflicts which can result in people delaying or refusing to communicate, the personal attitudes of individual employees which may be due to lack of motivation or dissatisfaction at work, brought about by insufficient training to enable them to carry out particular tasks, or simply resistance to change due to entrenched attitudes and ideas.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n* '''Ambiguity of words/phrases-''' Words sounding the same but having different meaning can convey a different meaning altogether. Hence the communicator must ensure that the receiver receives the same meaning. It is better if such words are avoided by using alternatives whenever possible.\n* '''Individual linguistic ability-''' The use of [[jargon]], difficult or inappropriate words in communication can prevent the recipients from understanding the message. Poorly explained or misunderstood messages can also result in confusion. However, research in communication has shown that confusion can lend [[legitimation|legitimacy]] to research when persuasion fails.<ref>[http://www.pmhut.com/what-should-be-included-in-a-project-plan What Should Be Included in a Project Plan] - Retrieved December 18th, 2009</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/Bafflegab%20Pays.pdf |title=Bafflegab Pays |author=J.

It is when the sender is expressing a thought or a word but the receiver takes it in a different meaning. For example- ASAP, Rest room\n* '''Technological multi-tasking and absorbency-''' With a rapid increase in technologically-driven communication in the past several decades, individuals are increasingly faced with condensed communication in the form of e-mail, text, and social updates. This has, in turn, led to a notable change in the way younger generations communicate and perceive their own self-efficacy to communicate and connect with others. With the ever-constant presence of another \"world\" in one's pocket, individuals are multi-tasking both physically and cognitively as constant reminders of something else happening somewhere else bombard them. Though perhaps too new of an advancement to yet see long-term effects, this is a notion currently explored by such figures as Sherry Turkle.<ref>{{cite web|title = Technology can sometimes hinder communication, TR staffers observe - The Collegian|url = http://collegian.tccd.edu/?p=3851|website = The Collegian|accessdate = 2016-01-11|language = en-US}}</ref>\n* '''Fear of being criticized-'''This is a major factor that prevents good communication. If we exercise simple practices to improve our communication skill, we can become effective communicators. For example, read an article from the newspaper or collect some news from the television and present it in front of the mirror. This will not only boost your confidence but also improve your language and vocabulary.\n* '''Gender barriers-''' Most communicators whether aware or not, often have a set agenda. This is very notable among the different genders. For example, many women are found to be more critical in addressing conflict. It's also been noted that men are more than likely to withdraw from conflict when in comparison to women.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Sandra|year=2009|title=Couple Relationships: Communication and Conflict Resolution|url=http://store.msuextension.org/publications/HomeHealthandFamily/MT200917HR.pdf|journal=MSU Extension|volume=17|page=2|via=George Mason University Libraries}}</ref> This breakdown and comparison not only shows that there are many factors to communication between two specific genders but also room for improvement as well as established guidelines for all.\n\n===Cultural aspects===\nCultural differences exist within countries (tribal/regional differences, dialects etc.), between religious groups and in organisations or at an organisational level - where companies, teams and units may have different expectations, norms and idiolects. Families and family groups may also experience the effect of cultural barriers to communication within and between different family members or groups. For example: words, colours and symbols have different meanings in different cultures. In most parts of the world, nodding your head means agreement, shaking your head means no, except in some parts of the world.<ref>Nageshwar Rao, Rajendra P.Das, ''Communication skills,'' Himalaya Publishing House, 9789350516669, p.48</ref>\n\nCommunication to a great extent is influenced by culture and [[Cultural variations in adoption|cultural variables]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://expertscolumn.com/content/communication-and-cognitive-components-culture |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718080147/http://expertscolumn.com/content/communication-and-cognitive-components-culture |archivedate=2013-07-18 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondintractability.org/bi-essay/cross-cultural-communication |title=Incorrect Link to Beyond Intractability Essay |publisher=Beyond Intractability |date=2017-04-18 |accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studymode.com/essays/Important-Components-Of-Cross-Cultural-Communication-595745.html |title=Important Components of Cross-Cultural Communication Essay - 1298 Words |website=Studymode.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ijdesign.org/ojs/index.php/IJDesign/article/view/313/155 |title=Portable Document Format (PDF) |website=Ijdesign.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref> Understanding ''cultural aspects of communication'' refers to having knowledge of different cultures in order to communicate effectively with cross culture people. Cultural aspects of communication are of great relevance in today's world which is now a [[Global village (term)|global village]], thanks to [[globalisation]]. Cultural aspects of communication are the cultural differences which influences communication across borders. Impact of cultural differences on communication components are explained below:\n\n#[[Verbal communication]] refers to form of communication which uses spoken and written words for expressing and transferring views and ideas. Language is the most important tool of verbal communication and it is the area where cultural difference play its role. All countries have different [[language]]s and to have a better understanding of different culture it is required to have knowledge of languages of different countries.\n#[[Non verbal communication]] is a very wide concept and it includes all the other forms of communication which do not uses written or spoken words. Non verbal communication takes following forms:\n#*[[Paralinguistics]] are the voice involved in communication other than actual language and involves [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]], [[pitch (music)|pitch]], vocal cues etc. It also include sounds from throat and all these are greatly influenced by cultural differences across borders.\n#*[[Proxemics]] deals with the concept of [[space]] element in communication. Proxemics explains four zones of spaces namely intimate personal, social and public. This concept differs with different culture as the permissible space vary in different countries.\n#*[[Artifactics]] studies about the [[nonverbal communication|non verbal signals]] or communication which emerges from personal accessories such as dresses or fashion accessories worn and it varies with culture as people of different countries follow different dressing codes.\n#*[[Chronemics]] deal with the time aspects of communication and also include importance given to the time. Some issues explaining this concept are pauses, silences and response lag during an [[interaction]]. This aspect of communication is also influenced by [[cultural difference]]s as it is well known that there is a great difference in the value given by different cultures to time.\n#*[[Kinesics]] mainly deals with the [[body language]]s such as [[Neutral spine|postures]], [[gesture]]s, [[head nod]]s, leg movements etc. In different countries, the same gestures and postures are used to convey different messages. Sometimes even a particular kinesic indicating something good in a country may have a negative meaning in any other culture.\n\nSo in order to have an effective communication across the world it is desirable to have a knowledge of cultural variables effecting communication.\n\nAccording to Michael Walsh and [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], Western conversational interaction is typically \"dyadic\", between two particular people, where eye contact is important and the speaker controls the interaction; and \"contained\" in a relatively short, defined time frame. However, traditional Aboriginal conversational interaction is \"communal\", broadcast to many people, eye contact is not important, the listener controls the interaction; and \"continuous\", spread over a longer, indefinite time frame.<ref name=Engaging>{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf |title=ENGAGING - A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property |author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al |publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support |year=2015 |p=12 |accessdate=25 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf |archivedate=30 March 2016 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/47329|publisher=Australian National University, North Australia Research Unit|author=Walsh, Michael|year=1997|title=Cross cultural communication problems in Aboriginal Australia|pp=7\u20139|accessdate=25 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Nonhuman==\n{{See also|Biocommunication (science)|Interspecies communication|Biosemiotics}}\nEvery [[information exchange]] between living organisms \u2014 i.e. transmission of [[Signalling theory|signals]] that involve a living sender and [[Receiver (information theory)|receiver]] can be considered a form of communication; and even primitive creatures such as corals are competent to communicate. Nonhuman communication also include [[cell signaling]], [[Cellular communication (biology)|cellular communication]], and chemical transmissions between primitive organisms like [[bacteria]] and within the [[plant]] and [[fungi|fungal]] kingdoms.\n\n===Animals===\nThe broad field of [[animal communication]] encompasses most of the issues in [[ethology]]. [[Animal communication]] can be defined as any [[behavior]] of one animal that affects the current or future behavior of another animal. The study of animal communication, called ''zoo semiotics'' (distinguishable from [[anthroposemiotics]], the study of human communication) has played an important part in the development of [[ethology]], [[sociobiology]], and the study of [[animal cognition]]. Animal communication, and indeed the understanding of the animal world in general, is a rapidly growing field, and even in the 21st century so far, a great share of prior understanding related to diverse fields such as personal symbolic [[name]] use, [[emotion in animals|animal emotions]], [[animal culture]] and [[animal learning|learning]], and even [[animal sexuality|sexual conduct]], long thought to be well understood, has been revolutionized.\n\n===Plants and fungi===\nCommunication is observed within the plant organism, i.e. within [[plant cells]] and between plant cells, between plants of the same or related species, and between plants and non-plant organisms, especially in the [[rhizosphere|root zone]]. [[Plant root]]s communicate with [[rhizome]] [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], and insects within the [[soil]]. Recent research has shown that most of the microorganism plant communication processes are [[neuron]]-like.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Baluska |first1=F. |last2=Marcuso |first2=Stefano |last3=Volkmann |first3=Dieter |title=Communication in plants: neuronal aspects of plant life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IH9N4SKWTokC&pg=PA19 |page=19 |year=2006 |publisher=Taylor & Francis US |isbn=3-540-28475-3 |quote=...the emergence of plant neurobiology as the most recent area of plant sciences.}}</ref> Plants also communicate via [[volatile oil|volatiles]] when exposed to [[herbivory]] attack behavior, thus warning neighboring plants.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rapid Changes in Tree Leaf Chemistry Induced by Damage: Evidence for Communication Between Plants |authors=Ian T.

Fungi communicate with their own and related species as well as with non fungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions, especially with bacteria, [[unicellular]] eukaryote, plants and insects through biochemicals of biotic origin. The biochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner, while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages, they do not trigger the fungal organism to react. This implies that fungal organisms can differentiate between molecules taking part in biotic messages and similar molecules being irrelevant in the situation. So far five different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as [[filamentation]], [[mating]], growth, and [[pathogenicity]]. Behavioral coordination and production of signaling substances is achieved through interpretation processes that enables the organism to differ between self or non-self, a biotic indicator, biotic message from similar, related, or non-related species, and even filter out \"noise\", i.e. similar molecules without biotic content.<ref>Witzany, G (ed) (2012). Biocommunication of Fungi. Springer. {{ISBN|978-94-007-4263-5}}</ref>\n\n===Bacteria quorum sensing===\nCommunication is not a tool used only by humans, plants and animals, but it is also used by microorganisms like bacteria. The process is called [[quorum sensing]]. Through quorum sensing, bacteria are able to sense the density of cells, and regulate gene expression accordingly. This can be seen in both gram positive and gram negative bacteria.\nThis was first observed by Fuqua ''et al.'' in marine microorganisms like ''[[Vibrio harveyi|V. harveyi]]'' and ''[[Vibrio fischeri|V. fischeri]]''.<ref>Anand, Sandhya. ''[http://www.biotecharticles.com/Biology-Article/Quorum-Sensing-Communication-Plan-For-Microbes-517.html Quorum Sensing- Communication Plan For Microbes]''.

E., & Weaver, W. (1949). ''The mathematical theory of communication''. Urbana, Illinois: [[University of Illinois Press]]</ref> The original model was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technologies. Their initial model consisted of three primary parts: sender, channel, and receiver. The sender was the part of a telephone a person spoke into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone where one could hear the other person. Shannon and Weaver also recognized that often there is static that interferes with one listening to a telephone [[conversation]], which they deemed noise.\n\nIn a simple model, often referred to as the transmission model or standard view of communication, information or content (e.g. a message in [[natural language]]) is sent in some form (as [[spoken language]]) from an emitter (''emisor'' in the picture)/ sender/ [[encoder]] to a destination/ receiver/ decoder. This common conception of communication simply views communication as a means of sending and receiving information. The strengths of this model are simplicity, generality, and quantifiability. Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver structured this model based on the following elements:\n# An information source, which produces a message.\n# A transmitter, which encodes the message into signals\n# A channel, to which signals are adapted for transmission\n# A noise source, which distorts the signal while it propagates through the channel\n# A receiver, which 'decodes' (reconstructs) the message from the signal.\n# A destination, where the message arrives.\n\nShannon and Weaver argued that there were three levels of problems for communication within this theory.\n:The technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted?\n:The semantic problem: how precisely is the meaning 'conveyed'?\n:The effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning affect behavior?\n\n[[Daniel Chandler]]<ref>[[Daniel Chandler]], \"The Transmission Model of Communication\", [http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/trans.html Aber.ac.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106130649/http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/trans.html |date=January 6, 2010 }}</ref> critiques the transmission model by stating:\n:It assumes communicators are isolated individuals.\n:No allowance for differing purposes.\n:No allowance for differing interpretations.\n:No allowance for unequal power relations.\n:No allowance for situational contexts.\n\nIn 1960, David Berlo expanded on Shannon and Weaver's (1949) linear model of communication and created the SMCR Model of Communication.<ref>Berlo, D. K. (1960).'' The process of communication''. New York, New York: Holt, Rinehart, & Winston.</ref> The Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver Model of communication separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.\n\nCommunication is usually described along a few major dimensions: Message (what type of things are communicated), source / emisor / sender / [[encoder]] (by whom), form (in which form), channel (through which [[media (communication)|medium]]), destination / receiver / target / decoder (to whom), and Receiver. Wilbur Schram (1954) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and undesired) on the target of the message.<ref>Schramm, W. (1954). How communication works. In W. Schramm (Ed.), ''The process and effects of communication'' (pp. 3\u201326). Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press.</ref> Between parties, communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands, and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make [[message]]s that are sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another [[Interpersonal Communication|person]] or being, another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings).\n\nCommunication can be seen as processes of [[information transmission]] with three levels of [[semiotic]] rules:\n# [[Pragmatics|Pragmatic]] (concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and their users)\n# [[Semantic]] (study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent) and\n# [[Syntactic]] (formal properties of signs and symbols).\n\nTherefore, communication is [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]] where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of [[semiotic]] rules. This commonly held rule in some sense ignores [[semiotics|autocommunication]], including [[intrapersonal communication]] via [[diary|diaries]] or self-talk, both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions.\n\nIn light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (2008) proposed a transactional model of communication.<ref>Barnlund, D. C. (2008). A transactional model of communication. In. C. D. Mortensen (Eds.), ''Communication theory'' (2nd ed., pp47-57). New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction.</ref> The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages.\n\nIn a slightly more complex form a sender and a receiver are linked [[wikt:reciprocal|reciprocally]]. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a [[speech act]]. The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents. In the presence of \"[[noise|communication noise]]\" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a [[codebook]], and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical. Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.\n\nTheories of [[coregulation]] describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian media scholar [[Harold Innis]] had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society.<ref name=\"Wark1997\">{{Cite book|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|year=1997|title=The Virtual Republic|publisher=Allen & Unwin, St Leonards|page=}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2017}} His famous example of this is using [[ancient Egypt]] and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called '[[General semantics|Space Binding]]'. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and '[[General semantics|Time Binding]]', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society.<ref name=\"Wark1997\"/>{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Noise==\nIn any communication model, noise is interference with the decoding of messages sent over a channel by an encoder. There are many examples of noise:\n* '''Environmental noise.''' Noise that physically disrupts communication, such as standing next to loud speakers at a party, or the noise from a construction site next to a classroom making it difficult to hear the professor.\n* '''Physiological-impairment noise.''' Physical maladies that prevent effective communication, such as actual [[deafness]] or [[blindness]] preventing messages from being received as they were intended.\n* '''Semantic noise.''' Different interpretations of the meanings of certain words. For example, the word \"weed\" can be interpreted as an undesirable plant in a yard, or as a euphemism for marijuana.\n* '''Syntactical noise.''' Mistakes in grammar can disrupt communication, such as abrupt changes in [[Grammatical tense|verb tense]] during a sentence.\n* '''Organizational noise.''' Poorly structured communication can prevent the receiver from accurate interpretation. For example, unclear and badly stated directions can make the receiver even more lost.\n* '''Cultural noise.''' Stereotypical assumptions can cause misunderstandings, such as unintentionally offending a non-Christian person by wishing them a \"Merry Christmas\".\n* '''Psychological noise.''' Certain attitudes can also make communication difficult. For instance, great anger or sadness may cause someone to lose focus on the present moment. Disorders such as [[autism]] may also severely hamper effective communication.<ref>Roy M. Berko, et al., Communicating. 11th ed. (Boston, MA: Pearson Education, Inc., 2010) 9-12</ref>\nTo face communication noise, redundancy and acknowledgement must often be used. Acknowledgements are messages from the addressee informing the originator that his/her communication has been received and is understood.<ref>North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Nato Standardization Agency AAP-6 - Glossary of terms and definitions, p 43.</ref> Message repetition and feedback about message received are necessary in the presence of noise to reduce the probability of misunderstanding.\nThe act of disambiguation regards the attempt of reducing noise and wrong interpretations, when the semantic value or meaning of a sign can be subject to noise, or in presence of multiple meanings, which makes the sense-making difficult. Disambiguation attempts to decrease the likelihood of misunderstanding. This is also a fundamental skill in communication processes activated by counselors, psychotherapists, interpreters, and in coaching sessions based on colloquium. In Information Technology, the disambiguation process and the automatic disambiguation of meanings of words and sentences has also been an interest and concern since the earliest days of computer treatment of language.<ref>Nancy Ide, Jean V\u00e9ronis.

The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face conversation to mass media outlets such as television broadcasting. Communication studies also examines how messages are interpreted through the political, cultural, economic, semiotic, hermeneutic, and social dimensions of their contexts. [[Statistics]], as a quantitative approach to communication science, has also been incorporated into research on communication science in order to help substantiate claims.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Statistical Methods for Communication Science |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=YQ5Yb3z5H1UC&printsec=frontcover |last=Hayes |first=Andrew F. |publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]] |date=31 May 2005 |isbn=9781410613707 |pages=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Media|Sociology|Technology}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Advice (opinion)|Advice]]\n* [[Augmentative and alternative communication]]\n* [[Communication rights]]\n* [[Data communication]]\n* [[Error detection and correction]]\n* [[Four Cs of 21st century learning]]\n* [[Human communication]]\n* [[Information engineering (field)|Information engineering]]\n* ''[[Inter Mirifica]]''\n* [[Intercultural communication]]\n* [[Ishin-denshin]]\n* [[Proactive communications]]\n* [[Sign system]]\n* [[Signal]]\n* [[Small talk]]\n* [[SPEAKING]]\n* [[Telecommunication]]\n* [[Telepathy]]\n* [[Understanding]]\n* [[21st century skills]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Library resources box\n|by=no\n|onlinebooks=no\n|others=no\n|about=yes\n|label=communication}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Innis |first=Harold |authorlink=Harold Innis |last2=Innis |first2=Mary Q. |title=[[Empire and Communications]] |edition=Revised |others=Foreword by [[Marshall McLuhan]] |location=Toronto |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |year=1975 |orig-year=1950 |isbn=0-8020-6119-2 |oclc=19403451}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{commons category-inline|Communication}}\n* {{wikiquote-inline}}\n\n{{Communication studies}}\n{{Human intelligence topics}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Communication| ]]\n[[Category:Plant cognition]]", "sha1": "q7no1wde1s25qgxszyqdblwcugm6v7i"}}, {"title": "Classics", "ns": "0", "id": "5178", "revision": {"id": "860483999", "parentid": "853187632", "timestamp": "2018-09-21T00:00:09Z", "contributor": {"username": "Aivin G.", "id": "34360570"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Excessive blanks", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the academic discipline}}\n{{redirect|Classical literature|literature from the ancient world in general|Ancient literature|exemplary or noteworthy books|Classic book}}\n{{redirect|Classicist|the art movement|Classicism}}\n[[File:Homeros Caetani Louvre Ma440 n2.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of [[Homer]], the ancient Greek epic poet]]\n'''Classics''' or '''classical studies''' is the study of [[classical antiquity]].

By the 2nd century AD the word was used in literary criticism to describe writers of the highest quality.<ref name=\"Ziolkowski07-17\">{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=17}}</ref> For example, [[Aulus Gellius]], in his ''Attic Nights'', contrasts \"classicus\" and \"[[wikt:proletarius|proletarius]]\" writers.<ref>Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'', 19.8.15.</ref> By the 6th century AD, the word had acquired a second meaning, referring to pupils at a school.<ref name=\"Ziolkowski07-17\"/> Thus the two modern meanings of the word, referring both to literature considered to be of the highest quality, and to the standard texts used as part of a curriculum, both derive from Roman use.<ref name=\"Ziolkowski07-17\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Catullus, Itally.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Photograph of a bronze bust of a man.

[[Catullus]], for instance, was almost entirely unknown in the medieval period.<ref name=\"Ziolkowski07-22\"/> The popularity of different authors also waxed and waned throughout the period: [[Lucretius]], popular during the [[Carolingian renaissance|Carolingian]] period, was barely read in the twelfth century, while for [[Quintilian]] the reverse is true.<ref name=\"Ziolkowski07-22\"/>\n\n===Renaissance===\nThe [[Renaissance]] led to the increasing study of both ancient literature and ancient history,<ref name=\"Kristeller78-586\"/> as well as a revival of classical styles of Latin.<ref name=\"Kristeller78-587\"/> From the [[14th century]], first in Italy and then increasingly across Europe, [[Renaissance Humanism]], an intellectual movement that \"advocated the study and imitation of classical antiquity\",<ref name=\"Kristeller78-586\">{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=586}}</ref> developed.

In 2009, a review of ''Meeting the Challenge'', a collection of conference papers about the teaching of Latin in Europe, noted that though there is opposition to the teaching of Latin in Italy, it is nonetheless still compulsory in most secondary schools.<ref>{{harvnb|Balbo|2009}}</ref> The same can be said in the case of France or Greece, too. Indeed, Ancient Greek is one of the compulsory subjects in Greek secondary education, whereas in France, Latin is one of the optional subjects that can be chosen in a majority of middle schools and high schools. Ancient Greek is also still being taught, but not as much as Latin.\n\n==Sub-disciplines==\nOne of the most notable characteristics of the modern study of Classics is the diversity of the field.

Indeed, the art and architecture of Ancient Rome and Greece is very well regarded and remains at the heart of much of our art today. For example, Ancient Greek architecture gave us the Classical Orders: [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]. The [[Parthenon]] is still the architectural symbol of the classical world.\n\nGreek sculpture is well known and we know the names of several Ancient Greek artists: for example, [[Phidias]].\n\n===Ancient history===\nWith philology, archaeology, and art history, scholars seek understanding of the history and culture of a civilisation, through critical study of the extant literary and physical artefacts, in order to compose and establish a continual historic narrative of the Ancient World and its peoples. The task is difficult due to a dearth of physical evidence: for example, [[Sparta]] was a leading Greek [[city-state]], yet little evidence of it survives to study, and what is available comes from [[Athens]], Sparta's principal rival; likewise, the [[Roman Empire]] destroyed most evidence (cultural artefacts) of earlier, conquered civilizations, such as that of the [[Etruscans]].\n\n===Philosophy===\n{{Main article|Ancient philosophy}}\nThe English word \"philosophy\" comes from the Greek word \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1, meaning \"love of wisdom\", probably coined by Pythagoras. Along with the word itself, the discipline of philosophy as we know it today has its roots in ancient Greek thought, and according to Martin West \"philosophy as we understand it is a Greek creation\".<ref>{{harvnb|West|2001|p=140}}</ref> Ancient philosophy was traditionally divided into three branches: logic, physics, and ethics.<ref name=\"Mann 1996 178\">{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=178}}</ref> However, not all of the works of ancient philosophers fit neatly into one of these three branches.

It is predated in the 2nd millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. Its Hellenistic phase is known as Koine (\"common\") or Biblical Greek, and its late period mutates imperceptibly into Medieval Greek. Koine is regarded as a separate historical stage of its own, although in its earlier form it closely resembles Classical Greek. Prior to the Koine period, Greek of the classical and earlier periods included several regional dialects.\n\nAncient Greek was the language of Homer and of classical Athenian historians, playwrights, and philosophers. It has contributed many words to the vocabulary of English and many other European languages, and has been a standard subject of study in Western educational institutions since the Renaissance. Latinized forms of Ancient Greek roots are used in many of the scientific names of species and in other scientific terminology.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main article|Ancient Greek literature}}\nThe earliest surviving works of Greek literature are [[epic poetry]].

Herodotus is commonly called the father of history, and his \"History\" contains the first truly literary use of prose in Western literature. Of the two, Thucydides was the more careful historian. His critical use of sources, inclusion of documents, and laborious research made his History of the Peloponnesian War a significant influence on later generations of historians.<!-- Should talk about post-Thucydidean history: Xenophon, Polybius, Diodorus, Arrian, Plutarch etc. --> The greatest achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy. There were many Greek philosophers, but three names tower above the rest: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. These have had a profound influence on Western society.<!-- Socrates wrote nothing! What is he doing in this section?! -->\n\n===Mythology and religion===\n{{Main article|Greek mythology|Religion in Ancient Greece}}\n\nGreek mythology is the body of myths and legends belonging to the ancient Greeks concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. They were a part of religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to the myths and study them in an attempt to throw light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.\n\nGreek religion encompassed the collection of beliefs and rituals practiced in ancient Greece in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices. These different groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or \"cults\" in the plural, though most of them shared similarities. Also, the Greek religion extended out of Greece and out to neighbouring islands.\n\nMany Greek people recognized the major gods and goddesses: Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, Ares, Dionysus, Hephaestus, Athena, Hermes, Demeter, Hestia and Hera; though philosophies such as Stoicism and some forms of Platonism used language that seems to posit a transcendent single deity. Different cities often worshipped the same deities, sometimes with epithets that distinguished them and specified their local nature.\n\n===Philosophy===\n{{Main article|Ancient Greek philosophy}}\n[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A bust of Socrates|So influential was Socrates to classical philosophy that earlier philosophers are today known as [[pre-Socratics]].]]\n\nThe earliest surviving philosophy from ancient Greece dates back to the 6th century BC, when according to Aristotle [[Thales of Miletus]] was considered to have been the first Greek philosopher.<ref>Aristotle, Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.</ref> Other influential pre-Socratic philosophers include [[Pythagoras]] and [[Heraclitus]]. The most famous and significant figures in classical Athenian philosophy, from the 5th to the 3rd centuries BC, are [[Socrates]], his student [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], who studied at [[Plato's Academy]] before founding his own school, known as the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]. Later Greek schools of philosophy, including the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], [[Stoics]], and [[Epicureans]], continued to be influential after the Roman annexation of Greece, and into the post-Classical world.\n\nGreek philosophy dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including political philosophy, [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]], and [[logic]], as well as disciplines which are not today thought of as part of philosophy, such as biology and rhetoric.\n\n==Classical Rome==\n{{Main article|Ancient Rome|Culture of Ancient Rome}}\n\n===Language===\n{{main article|Latin}}\n[[File:Praeneste fibula.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Photograph of a gold brooch|The [[Praeneste fibula]] is believed to bear the oldest known Latin inscription.

The earliest surviving inscription in Latin comes from the 7th century BC, on a [[Praeneste fibula|brooch from Palestrina]]. Latin from between this point and the early 1st century BC is known as [[Old Latin]]. Most surviving Latin literature is [[Classical Latin]], from the 1st century BC to the 2nd century AD. Latin then evolved into [[Late Latin]], in use during the [[Late antiquity|late antique period]]. Late Latin survived long after the end of classical antiquity, and was finally replaced by written Romance languages around the 9th century AD. Along with literary forms of Latin, there existed various vernacular dialects, generally known as [[Vulgar Latin]], in use throughout antiquity. These are mainly preserved in sources such as graffiti and the [[Vindolanda tablets]].\n\n===Literature===\n{{main article|Latin literature}}\nThe earliest surviving Latin authors, writing in Old Latin, include the playwrights [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]]. Much of the best known and most highly thought of Latin literature comes from the classical period, with poets such as [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], and [[Ovid]]; historians such as [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Tacitus]]; orators such as [[Cicero]]; and philosophers such as [[Seneca the Younger]] and [[Lucretius]]. Late Latin authors include many Christian writers such as [[Lactantius]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Ambrose]]; non-Christian authors, such as the historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], are also preserved.\n\n===History===\n{{main article|Timeline of ancient Rome}}\nAccording to legend, the city of Rome was founded in 753 BC;<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=11}}</ref> in reality, there had been a settlement on the site since around 1000 BC, when the [[Palatine Hill]] was settled.<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=10}}</ref> The city was originally ruled by kings, first Roman, and then Etruscan \u2013 according to Roman tradition, the first Etruscan king of Rome, Tarquinius Priscus, ruled from 616 BC.<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|1978|pp=21\u201322}}</ref> Over the course of the 6th century BC, the city expanded its influence over the entirety of [[Latium]].<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=28}}</ref> Around the end of the 6th century \u2013 traditionally in 510 BC \u2013 the kings of Rome were driven out, and the city became a republic.<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=31}}</ref>\n\nAround 387 BC, Rome was sacked by the Gauls following the [[Battle of the Allia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=44}}</ref> It soon recovered from this humiliating defeat, however, and in 381 the inhabitants of [[Tusculum]] in Latium were made Roman citizens.

Thus, Latin grew from a highly developed cultural product of the Golden and Silver eras of Latin literature to become the ''international lingua franca'' in matters diplomatic, scientific, philosophic and religious, until the 17th century. Long before this, Latin had evolved into [[Romance languages|the Romance languages]] and Ancient Greek into [[Modern Greek]] and its [[Modern Greek dialects|dialects]]. In the specialised science and technology vocabularies, the influence of [[Latin influence in English|Latin]] and [[English words of Greek origin|Greek]] is notable. [[Ecclesiastical Latin]], the Roman Catholic Church's official language, remains a living legacy of the classical world in the contemporary world.\n\nLatin had an impact far beyond the classical world. It continued to be the pre-eminent language for serious writings in Europe long after the fall of the Roman empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|pp=xi\u2013xii}}</ref> The modern [[Romance languages]] \u2013 such as French, Spanish, and Italian \u2013 all derive from Latin.<ref>{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|p=161}}</ref> Latin is still seen as a foundational aspect of European culture.<ref>{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|p=xiii}}</ref>\n\nThe legacy of the classical world is not confined to the influence of classical languages.

Since several millennia BC, civilizations were using technologies that would eventually form the basis of the various branches of chemistry. Examples include extracting [[metal]]s from [[ore]]s, making pottery and glazes, fermenting beer and wine, extracting chemicals from plants for medicine and perfume, rendering fat into [[soap]], making [[glass]], and making [[alloy]]s like [[bronze]]. Chemistry was preceded by its protoscience, [[alchemy]], which is an intuitive but non-scientific approach to understanding the constituents of matter and their interactions. It was unsuccessful in explaining the nature of matter and its transformations, but, by performing experiments and recording the results, alchemists set the stage for modern chemistry. Chemistry as a body of knowledge distinct from alchemy began to emerge when a clear differentiation was made between them by  [[Robert Boyle]] in his work ''[[The Sceptical Chymist]]'' (1661). While both alchemy and chemistry are concerned with matter and its transformations, the crucial difference was given by the [[scientific method]] that [[chemist]]s employed in their work. Chemistry is considered to have become an established science with the work of [[Antoine Lavoisier]], who developed a law of [[conservation of mass]] that demanded careful measurement and quantitative observations of chemical phenomena.  The history of chemistry is intertwined with the [[history of thermodynamics]], especially through the work of [[Willard Gibbs]].<ref>[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/papers.html Selected Classic Papers from the History of Chemistry]</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''[[Chemistry (word)|chemistry]]'' comes from ''alchemy,'' which referred to an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism and medicine. It is often seen as linked to the quest to turn lead or another common starting material into gold,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alchemylab.com/history_of_alchemy.htm |title=History of Alchemy |publisher=Alchemy Lab |accessdate=2011-06-12}}</ref> though in ancient times the study encompassed many of the questions of modern chemistry being defined as the study of the composition of waters, movement, growth, embodying, disembodying, drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies by the early 4th century Greek-Egyptian alchemist [[Zosimos of Panopolis|Zosimos]].<ref>Strathern, P.

The [[chemical interaction|interactions]], reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms, leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together. Such behaviors are studied in a chemistry [[laboratory]].\n\nThe chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of [[laboratory glassware]]. However glassware is not central to chemistry, and a great deal of experimental (as well as applied/industrial) chemistry is done without it.\n\n[[File:Chemicals in flasks.jpg|thumb|right|Solutions of substances in reagent bottles, including [[ammonium hydroxide]] and [[nitric acid]], illuminated in different colors]]\n\nA [[chemical reaction]] is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances.<ref>IUPAC [[Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01033.html Definition]</ref> The basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms. It can be symbolically depicted through a [[chemical equation]], which usually involves atoms as subjects. The number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal. (When the number of atoms on either side is unequal, the transformation is referred to as a [[nuclear reaction]] or [[radioactive decay]].) The type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws.\n\n[[Energy]] and [[entropy]] considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies. Chemical substances are classified in terms of their [[structure]], phase, as well as their [[chemical composition]]s. They can be analyzed using the tools of [[chemical analysis]], e.g. [[spectroscopy]] and [[chromatography]].

The nucleus is made up of positively charged [[protons]] and uncharged [[neutrons]] (together called [[nucleon]]s), while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged [[electron]]s which orbit the nucleus. In a neutral atom, the negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons. The nucleus is dense; the mass of a nucleon is appromixately 1,836 times that of an electron, yet the radius of an atom is about 10,000 times that of its nucleus.{{sfn|Burrows|Holman|Parsons|Pilling|2008|p=13}}{{sfn|Housecroft|Sharpe|2008|p=2}}\n\nThe atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain the [[chemical properties]] of the element, such as [[electronegativity]], [[ionization potential]], preferred [[oxidation state]](s), [[coordination number]], and preferred types of bonds to form (e.g., [[metal]]lic, [[ion]]ic, [[covalent]]).\n\n====Element====\n[[File:Simple Periodic Table Chart-en.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Standard form of the [[periodic table]] of chemical elements.

The [[mass number]] is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus. Although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same atomic number, they may not necessarily have the same mass number; atoms of an element which have different mass numbers are known as [[isotope]]s. For example, all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element [[carbon]], but atoms of carbon may have mass numbers of 12 or 13.{{sfn|Housecroft|Sharpe|2008|p=2}}\n\nThe standard presentation of the chemical elements is in the [[periodic table]], which orders elements by atomic number. The periodic table is arranged in [[Periodic table group|groups]], or columns, and [[period (periodic table)|periods]], or rows. The periodic table is useful in identifying [[periodic trends]].{{sfn|Burrows|Holman|Parsons|Pilling|2009|p=110}}\n\n====Compound====\n[[File:Carbon dioxide structure.png|thumb|left|upright=0.6|[[Carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>), an example of a chemical compound]]\n{{Main|Chemical compound}}\n\nA ''compound'' is a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element.

In this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its [[CAS registry number]].\n\n====Molecule====\n{{Main|Molecule}}\n[[File:Caffeine (1) 3D ball.png|upright=1.05|thumb|right|A ball-and-stick representation of the [[caffeine]] molecule (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).]]\n\nA ''molecule'' is the smallest indivisible portion of a pure [[chemical substance]] that has its unique set of chemical properties, that is, its potential to undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances. However, this definition only works well for substances that are composed of molecules, which is not true of many substances (see below). Molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together by [[covalent bond]]s, such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either in bonds or in [[lone pair]]s.\n\nThus, molecules exist as electrically neutral units, unlike ions. When this rule is broken, giving the \"molecule\" a charge, the result is sometimes named a [[molecular ion]] or a polyatomic ion. However, the discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in well-separated form, such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a [[mass spectrometer]]. Charged polyatomic collections residing in solids (for example, common sulfate or nitrate ions) are generally not considered \"molecules\" in chemistry. Some molecules contain one or more unpaired electrons, creating [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]]. Most radicals are comparatively reactive, but some, such as nitric oxide (NO) can be stable.\n\n[[File:Benzene-2D-full.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|A 2-D [[skeletal model]] of a [[benzene]] molecule (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>)]]\nThe \"inert\" or [[Noble gas|noble gas elements]] ([[helium]], [[neon]], [[argon]], [[krypton]], [[xenon]] and [[radon]]) are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit, but the other isolated chemical elements consist of either molecules or networks of atoms bonded to each other in some way. Identifiable molecules compose familiar substances such as water, air, and many organic compounds like alcohol, sugar, gasoline, and the various [[pharmaceutical]]s.\n\nHowever, not all substances or chemical compounds consist of discrete molecules, and indeed most of the solid substances that make up the solid crust, mantle, and core of the Earth are chemical compounds without molecules. These other types of substances, such as [[ionic compounds]] and [[network solids]], are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules ''per se''.  Instead, these substances are discussed in terms of [[formula unit]]s or [[unit cell]]s as the smallest repeating structure within the substance. Examples of such substances are mineral salts (such as [[table salt]]), solids like carbon and diamond, metals, and familiar [[silica]] and [[silicate minerals]] such as quartz and granite.\n\nOne of the main characteristics of a molecule is its geometry often called its [[molecular structure|structure]]. While the structure of diatomic, triatomic or tetra atomic molecules may be trivial, (linear, angular pyramidal etc.) the structure of polyatomic molecules, that are constituted of more than six atoms (of several elements) can be crucial for its chemical nature.\n\n====Substance and mixture====\n{{infobox\n| data1 = [[File:C\u00edn.png|100px]] [[File:Sulfur-sample.jpg|100px]]\n| data2 = [[File:Diamants macl\u00e9s 2(R\u00e9publique d'Afrique du Sud).jpg|100px]] [[File:Sugar 2xmacro.jpg|100px]]\n| data3 = [[File:Sal (close).jpg|100px]] [[File:Sodium bicarbonate.jpg|100px]]\n| data5 = Examples of pure chemical substances.

For the most part, the chemical classifications are independent of these bulk phase classifications; however, some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain chemical properties. A ''phase'' is a set of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties, over a range of conditions, such as [[pressure]] or [[temperature]].\n\nPhysical properties, such as [[density]] and [[refractive index]] tend to fall within values characteristic of the phase. The phase of matter is defined by the ''[[phase transition]]'', which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into rearranging the structure of the system, instead of changing the bulk conditions.\n\nSometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a discrete boundary, in this case the matter is considered to be in a [[supercritical fluid|supercritical]] state. When three states meet based on the conditions, it is known as a [[triple point]] and since this is invariant, it is a convenient way to define a set of conditions.\n\nThe most familiar examples of phases are [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, and [[gas]]es. Many substances exhibit multiple solid phases. For example, there are three phases of solid [[iron]] (alpha, gamma, and delta) that vary based on temperature and pressure. A principal difference between solid phases is the [[crystal structure]], or arrangement, of the atoms. Another phase commonly encountered in the study of chemistry is the ''aqueous'' phase, which is the state of substances dissolved in [[aqueous solution]] (that is, in water).\n\nLess familiar phases include [[plasma physics|plasmas]], [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]]s and [[fermionic condensate]]s and the [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] and [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] phases of [[magnet]]ic materials. While most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems, it is also possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems, which has received attention for its relevance to systems in [[biology]].\n\n===Bonding===\n{{Main|Chemical bond}}\n[[File:Ionic bonding animation.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.15|An animation of the process of ionic bonding between [[sodium]] (Na) and [[chlorine]] (Cl) to form [[sodium chloride]], or common table salt. Ionic bonding involves one atom taking valence electrons from another (as opposed to sharing, which occurs in covalent bonding)]]\n\nAtoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be bonded with one another. A chemical bond may be visualized as the [[multipole]] balance between the positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them.<ref>{{cite web|author=Visionlearning |url=http://www.visionlearning.com/library/module_viewer.php?mid=55 |title=Chemical Bonding by Anthony Carpi, Ph |publisher=visionlearning |accessdate=2011-06-12}}</ref> More than simple attraction and repulsion, the energies and distributions characterize the availability of an electron to bond to another atom.\n\nA chemical bond can be a [[covalent bond]], an [[ionic bond]], a [[hydrogen bond]] or just because of [[Van der Waals force]]. Each of these kinds of bonds is ascribed to some potential. These potentials create the [[chemical interaction|interactions]] which hold atoms together in [[molecule]]s or [[crystal]]s. In many simple compounds, [[valence bond theory]], the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion model ([[VSEPR]]), and the concept of [[oxidation number]] can be used to explain molecular structure and composition.\n\nAn ionic bond is formed when a metal loses one or more of its electrons, becoming a positively charged cation, and the electrons are then gained by the non-metal atom, becoming a negatively charged anion. The two oppositely charged ions attract one another, and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between them. For example, [[sodium]] (Na), a metal, loses one electron to become an Na<sup>+</sup> cation while [[chlorine]] (Cl), a non-metal, gains this electron to become Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>. The ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction, and that compound [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), or common table salt, is formed.\n\n[[File:Elektronenformel Punkte CH4.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|In the [[methane]] molecule (CH<sub>4</sub>), the carbon atom shares a pair of valence electrons with each of the four hydrogen atoms. Thus, the octet rule is satisfied for C-atom (it has eight electrons in its valence shell) and the duet rule is satisfied for the H-atoms (they have two electrons in their valence shells).]]\nIn a covalent bond, one or more pairs of [[valence electron]]s are shared by two atoms: the resulting electrically neutral group of bonded atoms is termed a [[molecule]]. Atoms will share valence electrons in such a way as to create a [[noble gas]] electron configuration (eight electrons in their outermost shell) for each atom. Atoms that tend to combine in such a way that they each have eight electrons in their valence shell are said to follow the [[octet rule]]. However, some elements like [[hydrogen]] and [[lithium]] need only two electrons in their outermost shell to attain this stable configuration; these atoms are said to follow the ''duet rule'', and in this way they are reaching the electron configuration of the noble gas [[helium]], which has two electrons in its outer shell.\n\nSimilarly, theories from [[classical physics]] can be used to predict many ionic structures. With more complicated compounds, such as [[complex (chemistry)|metal complexes]], valence bond theory is less applicable and alternative approaches, such as the [[molecular orbital]] theory, are generally used. See diagram on electronic orbitals.\n\n===Energy===\n{{Main|Energy}}\n\nIn the context of chemistry, energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its [[atomic structure|atomic]], [[molecular structure|molecular]] or aggregate [[chemical structure|structure]]. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structures, it is invariably accompanied by an [[endothermic reaction|increase]] or [[exothermic reaction|decrease]] of [[energy]] of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or [[photochemistry|light]]; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants.\n\nA reaction is said to be [[exergonic reaction|exergonic]] if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of [[endergonic reaction]]s the situation is the reverse. A reaction is said to be [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] if the reaction releases heat to the surroundings; in the case of [[endothermic reaction]]s, the reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings.\n\nChemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the [[activation energy]]. The ''speed'' of a chemical reaction (at given temperature T) is related to the activation energy E, by the Boltzmann's population factor <math>e^{-E/kT} </math> \u2013 that is the probability of a molecule to have energy greater than or equal to E at the given temperature T. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the [[Arrhenius equation]].\nThe activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction to occur can be in the form of heat, light, [[electricity]] or mechanical [[force]] in the form of [[ultrasound]].<ref>Reilly, Michael. (2007). [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11427-mechanical-force-induces-chemical-reaction.html#.Uy6ySlendfA Mechanical force induces chemical reaction], NewScientist.com news service, Reilly</ref>\n\nA related concept [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], which also incorporates entropy considerations, is a very useful means for predicting the feasibility of a reaction and determining the state of equilibrium of a chemical reaction, in [[chemical thermodynamics]]. A reaction is feasible only if the total change in the [[Gibbs free energy]] is negative, <math> \\Delta G \\le 0 \\,</math>; if it is equal to zero the chemical reaction is said to be at [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]].\n\nThere exist only limited possible states of energy for electrons, atoms and molecules. These are determined by the rules of [[quantum mechanics]], which require [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of energy of a bound system. The atoms/molecules in a higher energy state are said to be excited. The molecules/atoms of substance in an excited energy state are often much more reactive; that is, more amenable to chemical reactions.\n\nThe phase of a substance is invariably determined by its energy and the energy of its surroundings. When the [[intermolecular force]]s of a substance are such that the energy of the surroundings is not sufficient to overcome them, it occurs in a more ordered phase like liquid or solid as is the case with water (H<sub>2</sub>O); a liquid at room temperature because its molecules are bound by [[hydrogen bonds]].<ref>[http://www.chem4kids.com/files/matter_changes.html Changing States of Matter] - Chemforkids.com</ref> Whereas [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S) is a gas at room temperature and standard pressure, as its molecules are bound by weaker [[dipole-dipole interaction]]s.\n\nThe transfer of energy from one chemical substance to another depends on the ''size'' of energy [[quantum|quanta]] emitted from one substance. However, heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the [[phonons]] responsible for vibrational and rotational energy levels in a substance have much less energy than [[photons]] invoked for the electronic energy transfer. Thus, because vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels, heat is more easily transferred between substances relative to light or other forms of electronic energy. For example, ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy.\n\nThe existence of characteristic energy levels for different [[chemical substance]]s is useful for their identification by the analysis of [[spectral lines]]. Different kinds of spectra are often used in chemical [[spectroscopy]], e.g. [[infrared spectroscopy|IR]], [[microwave spectroscopy|microwave]], [[NMR]], [[electron spin resonance|ESR]], etc. Spectroscopy is also used to identify the composition of remote objects \u2013 like stars and distant galaxies \u2013 by analyzing their radiation spectra.\n[[File:Emission spectrum-Fe.svg|thumb|upright=2.25|center|Emission spectrum of [[iron]]]]\n\nThe term [[Energy#Chemical energy|chemical energy]] is often used to indicate the potential of a chemical substance to undergo a transformation through a [[chemical reaction]] or to transform other chemical substances.\n\n===Reaction===\n{{Main|Chemical reaction}}\n[[File:VysokePece1.jpg|thumb|right|During chemical reactions, bonds between atoms break and form, resulting in different substances with different properties. In a blast furnace, iron oxide, a [[chemical compound|compound]], reacts with carbon monoxide to form iron, one of the [[chemical element]]s, and carbon dioxide.]]\nWhen a chemical substance is transformed as a result of its interaction with another substance or with energy, a chemical reaction is said to have occurred. A ''chemical reaction'' is therefore a concept related to the \"reaction\" of a substance when it comes in close contact with another, whether as a mixture or a [[solution]]; exposure to some form of energy, or both. It results in some energy exchange between the constituents of the reaction as well as with the system environment, which may be designed vessels\u2014often [[laboratory glassware]].\n\nChemical reactions can result in the formation or [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] of molecules, that is, molecules breaking apart to form two or more smaller molecules, or rearrangement of atoms within or across molecules. Chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of chemical bonds. [[Redox|Oxidation, reduction]], [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]], acid-base [[neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] and molecular [[rearrangement reaction|rearrangement]] are some of the commonly used kinds of chemical reactions.\n\nA chemical reaction can be symbolically depicted through a [[chemical equation]]. While in a non-nuclear chemical reaction the number and kind of atoms on both sides of the equation are equal, for a nuclear reaction this holds true only for the nuclear particles viz. protons and neutrons.<ref>[http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01034.html Chemical Reaction Equation] \u2013 IUPAC Goldbook</ref>\n\nThe sequence of steps in which the reorganization of chemical bonds may be taking place in the course of a chemical reaction is called its [[Reaction mechanism|mechanism]]. A chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps, each of which may have a different speed. Many [[reaction intermediates]] with variable stability can thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction. Reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] and the relative product mix of a reaction. Many [[chemists|physical chemists]] specialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions. Several empirical rules, like the [[Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules]] often come in handy while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction.\n\nAccording to the [[IUPAC]] gold book, a chemical reaction is \"a process that results in the interconversion of chemical species.\"<ref>[[Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01033.html Chemical Reaction] IUPAC Goldbook</ref> Accordingly, a chemical reaction may be an [[elementary reaction]] or a [[stepwise reaction]]. An additional caveat is made, in that this definition includes cases where the [[conformer|interconversion of conformers]] is experimentally observable. Such detectable chemical reactions normally involve sets of molecular entities as indicated by this definition, but it is often conceptually convenient to use the term also for changes involving single molecular entities (i.e. 'microscopic chemical events').\n\n===Ions and salts===\n[[File:Potassium-chloride-3D-ionic.png|thumb|upright=0.75|The crystal lattice structure of [[potassium chloride]] (KCl), a salt which is formed due to the attraction of K<sup>+</sup> cations and Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> anions. Note how the overall charge of the ionic compound is zero.]]\n{{Main|Ion}}\n\nAn ''ion'' is a charged species, an atom or a molecule, that has lost or gained one or more electrons. When an atom loses an electron and thus has more protons than electrons, the atom is a positively charged ion or [[cation]]. When an atom gains an electron and thus has more electrons than protons, the atom is a negatively charged ion or [[anion]]. Cations and anions can form a crystalline lattice of neutral [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], such as the Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> ions forming [[sodium chloride]], or NaCl. Examples of [[polyatomic ion]]s that do not split up during [[Acid-base reaction theories|acid-base reactions]] are [[hydroxide]] (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) and [[phosphate]] (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3\u2212</sup>).\n\n[[plasma (physics)|Plasma]] is composed of gaseous matter that has been completely ionized, usually through high temperature.\n\n===Acidity and basicity===\n[[File:Hydrogen-bromide-3D-vdW.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|When [[hydrogen bromide]] (HBr), pictured, is dissolved in water, it forms the strong acid [[hydrobromic acid]]]]\n{{Main|Acid\u2013base reaction}}\n\nA substance can often be classified as an acid or a [[base (chemistry)|base]]. There are several different theories which explain acid-base behavior. The simplest is [[Arrhenius acid|Arrhenius theory]], which states than an acid is a substance that produces [[hydronium ion]]s when it is dissolved in water, and a base is one that produces [[hydroxide ion]]s when dissolved in water. According to [[Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base theory]], acids are substances that donate a positive [[hydrogen]] [[ion]] to another substance in a chemical reaction; by extension, a base is the substance which receives that hydrogen ion.\n\nA third common theory is [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acid-base theory]], which is based on the formation of new chemical bonds. Lewis theory explains that an acid is a substance which is capable of accepting a pair of electrons from another substance during the process of bond formation, while a base is a substance which can provide a pair of electrons to form a new bond.  According to this theory, the crucial things being exchanged are charges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apsidium.com/theory/lewis_acid.htm |title=The Lewis Acid-Base Concept |accessdate=2010-07-31 |date=May 19, 2003 |work=Apsidium |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527132328/http://www.apsidium.com/theory/lewis_acid.htm |archivedate=2008-05-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2010}}</ref><!-- A nicely laid-out and informative page on Lewis; unfortunately the apsidium.com web site was anonymous and thus not \"reliable source\" --> There are several other ways in which a substance may be classified as an acid or a base, as is evident in the history of this concept.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A708257 |title=History of Acidity |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2004-05-27 |accessdate=2011-06-12}}</ref>\n\nAcid strength is commonly measured by two methods. One measurement, based on the Arrhenius definition of acidity, is [[pH]], which is a measurement of the hydronium ion concentration in a solution, as expressed on a negative [[logarithm]]ic scale. Thus, solutions that have a low pH have a high hydronium ion concentration, and can be said to be more acidic. The other measurement, based on the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry definition, is the [[acid dissociation constant]] (K<sub>a</sub>), which measures the relative ability of a substance to act as an acid under the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry definition of an acid.  That is, substances with a higher K<sub>a</sub> are more likely to donate hydrogen ions in chemical reactions than those with lower K<sub>a</sub> values.\n\n===Redox===\n{{Main|Redox}}\n\nRedox (''red''uction-''ox''idation) reactions include all [[chemical reaction]]s in which atoms have their [[oxidation state]] changed by either gaining electrons (reduction) or losing electrons (oxidation). Substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances are said to be oxidative and are known as [[oxidizing agents]], oxidants or oxidizers. An oxidant removes electrons from another substance. Similarly, substances that have the ability to reduce other substances are said to be reductive and are known as [[reducing agents]], reductants, or reducers.\n\nA reductant transfers electrons to another substance, and is thus oxidized itself. And because it \"donates\" electrons it is also called an electron donor. Oxidation and reduction properly refer to a change in oxidation number\u2014the actual transfer of electrons may never occur. Thus, oxidation is better defined as an increase in [[oxidation number]], and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number.\n\n===Equilibrium===\n{{Main|Chemical equilibrium}}\n\nAlthough the concept of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] is widely used across sciences, in the context of chemistry, it arises whenever a number of different states of the chemical composition are possible, as for example, in a mixture of several chemical compounds that can react with one another, or when a substance can be present in more than one kind of phase.\n\nA system of chemical substances at equilibrium, even though having an unchanging composition, is most often not [[static equilibrium|static]]; molecules of the substances continue to react with one another thus giving rise to a [[dynamic equilibrium]]. Thus the concept describes the state in which the parameters such as chemical composition remain unchanged over time.\n\n===Chemical laws===\n{{Main|Chemical law}}\n\nChemical reactions are governed by certain laws, which have become fundamental concepts in chemistry. Some of them are:\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Avogadro's law]]\n* [[Beer\u2013Lambert law]]\n* [[Boyle's law]] (1662, relating pressure and volume)\n* [[Charles's law]] (1787, relating volume and temperature)\n* [[Fick's laws of diffusion]]\n* [[Pressure law|Gay-Lussac's law]] (1809, relating pressure and temperature)\n* [[Le Chatelier's principle]]\n* [[Henry's law]]\n* [[Hess's law]]\n* [[Conservation of energy|Law of conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].\n* [[Law of conservation of mass]] continues to be conserved in [[isolated system]]s, even in modern physics. However, [[special relativity]] shows that due to [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]], whenever non-material \"energy\" (heat, light, kinetic energy) is removed from a non-isolated system, some mass will be lost with it. High energy losses result in loss of weighable amounts of mass, an important topic in [[nuclear chemistry]].\n* [[Law of definite composition]], although in many systems (notably biomacromolecules and minerals) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.\n* [[Law of multiple proportions]]\n* [[Raoult's law]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of chemistry}}  \n===Of definition===\nThe definition of chemistry has changed over time, as new discoveries and theories add to the functionality of the science.

Analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods in chemistry. These methods may be used in all subdisciplines of chemistry, excluding purely theoretical chemistry.\n* [[Biochemistry]] is the study of the [[chemical compound|chemicals]], [[chemical reaction]]s and [[chemical interaction]]s that take place in living [[organism]]s. Biochemistry and organic chemistry are closely related, as in [[medicinal chemistry]] or [[neurochemistry]]. Biochemistry is also associated with [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]].\n* [[Inorganic chemistry]] is the study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds. The distinction between organic and inorganic disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap, most importantly in the sub-discipline of [[organometallic chemistry]].\n* [[Materials science|Materials chemistry]] is the preparation, characterization, and understanding of substances with a useful function. The field is a new breadth of study in graduate programs, and it integrates elements from all classical areas of chemistry with a focus on fundamental issues that are unique to materials. Primary systems of study include the chemistry of condensed phases (solids, liquids, [[polymers]]) and [[interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] between different phases.\n* [[Neurochemistry]] is the study of neurochemicals; including transmitters, peptides, proteins, lipids, sugars, and nucleic acids; their interactions, and the roles they play in forming, maintaining, and modifying the nervous system.\n* [[Nuclear chemistry]] is the study of how subatomic particles come together and make nuclei. Modern [[Nuclear transmutation|Transmutation]] is a large component of nuclear chemistry, and the [[table of nuclides]] is an important result and tool for this field.\n* [[Organic chemistry]] is the study of the structure, properties, composition, mechanisms, and [[chemical reaction|reactions]] of [[organic compound]]s. An organic compound is defined as any compound based on a carbon skeleton.\n* [[Physical chemistry]] is the study of the physical and fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes. In particular, the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists. Important areas of study include [[chemical thermodynamics]], [[chemical kinetics]], [[electrochemistry]], [[statistical mechanics]], [[spectroscopy]], and more recently, [[astrochemistry]].<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Herbst, Eric | title = Chemistry of Star-Forming Regions | journal = Journal of Physical Chemistry A | date = May 12, 2005 | volume = 109 | pages = 4017\u20134029 | issue = 18 | doi = 10.1021/jp050461c | pmid = 16833724| bibcode = 2005JPCA..109.4017H }}</ref>  Physical chemistry has large overlap with [[molecular physics]].

A key passage in the New Testament is {{bibleverse||John|1:1\u201318|NIV}} where John 1:17 specifically mentions that \"grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.\" Those who believe in the [[Trinity]], consider Christ a pre-existent divine [[Hypostatic union|hypostasis]] called the [[Logos]] or the [[Logos (Christianity)|Word]]. Other, non-Trinitarian views, question the aspect of personal pre-existence or question the aspect of divinity, or both. An example is the Orthodox Gnomic view, which asserts that Christ was, in fact, not a pre-existent divine being.\n\nThe concept of Christ as [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] derives from {{bibleverse||John|1:1|NIV}}: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" In the original Greek, ''[[Logos]]'' (\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2) is used for \"Word,\" and is often used untranslated.

The German term denoting Central Europe was so fashionable that other languages started referring to it when indicating territories from [[Rhine]] to [[Vistula]], or even [[Dnieper]], and from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Balkans]].<ref>A.

The centre of interest was moved to its eastern part \u2013 the countries that have (re)appeared on the map of Europe: [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]]. Central Europe ceased to be the area of German aspiration to lead or dominate and became a territory of various integration movements aiming at resolving political, economic and national problems of \"new\" states, being a way to face German and Soviet pressures. However, the conflict of interests was too big and neither [[Little Entente]] nor [[Intermarium]] (''Mi\u0119dzymorze'') ideas succeeded.\n\nThe interwar period brought new elements to the concept of Central Europe. Before World War I, it embraced mainly German states (Germany, [[Austria]]), non-German territories being an area of intended German penetration and domination \u2013 German leadership position was to be the natural result of economic dominance.<ref name=\"essex.ac.uk\" /> After the war, the Eastern part of Central Europe was placed at the centre of the concept. At that time the scientists took an interest in the idea: the International Historical Congress in [[Brussels]] in 1923 was committed to Central Europe, and the 1933 Congress continued the discussions.<ref name=\"ehr.oxfordjournals.org\">{{cite journal|last1=Deak|first1=I. |title=The Versailles System and Central Europe|doi=10.1093/ehr/cej100 |page=338|volume=CXXI |year=2006 |journal=The English Historical Review|issue=490}}</ref>\n\nHungarian scholar Magda Adam wrote in her study ''Versailles System and Central Europe'' (2006): \"Today we know that the bane of Central Europe was the [[Little Entente]], military alliance of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia), created in 1921 not for Central Europe's cooperation nor to fight German expansion, but in a wrong perceived notion that a completely powerless Hungary must be kept down\".<ref name=\"ehr.oxfordjournals.org\" />\n\nThe avant-garde movements of Central Europe were an essential part of modernism's evolution, reaching its peak throughout the continent during the 1920s.

On the other hand, the topic became popular in Western Europe and the United States, much of the research being carried out by immigrants from Central Europe.<ref>One of the main representatives was Oscar Halecki and his book ''The limits and divisions of European history'', London and New York 1950</ref> At the end of the communism, publicists and historians in Central Europe, especially anti-communist opposition, came back to their research.<ref>A. Podraza, Europa \u015arodkowa jako region historyczny, 17th Congress of Polish Historians, Jagiellonian University 2004</ref>\n\nAccording to Karl A. Sinnhuber (''Central Europe: Mitteleuropa: Europe Centrale: An Analysis of a Geographical Term'')<ref name=\"jstor29\" /> most Central European states were unable to preserve their political independence and became Soviet Satellite Europe. Besides [[Austria]], only the marginal Central European states of [[Finland]] and [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] preserved their political sovereignty to a certain degree, being left out of any military alliances in Europe.\n\nAccording to ''Meyers Enzyklop\u00e4disches Lexikon'',<ref>Band 16, Bibliographisches Institut Mannheim/Wien/Z\u00fcrich, Lexikon Verlag 1980</ref> Central Europe is a part of Europe composed of [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]] and [[Switzerland]], and northern marginal regions of [[Italy]] and Yugoslavia (northern states \u2013 [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Slovenia]]), as well as northeastern [[France]].\n\n===Current views===\n[[File:Geopolitical Challenges.jpg|thumb|Geopolitical Challenges - Panel on the Future of Europe]]\nRather than a physical entity, Central Europe is a concept of shared history which contrasts with that of the surrounding regions. The issue of how to name and define the Central European region is subject to debates. Very often, the definition depends on the nationality and historical perspective of its author.\n\nMain propositions, gathered by [[Jerzy K\u0142oczowski]], include:<ref>[[Jerzy K\u0142oczowski]], Actualit\u00e9 des grandes traditions de la cohabitation et du dialogue des cultures en Europe du Centre-Est, in: L'h\u00e9ritage historique de la Res Publica de Plusieurs Nations, Lublin 2004, pp. 29\u201330 {{ISBN|83-85854-82-7}}</ref>\n* West-Central and [[East-Central Europe]] \u2013 this conception, presented in 1950,<ref>[[Oskar Halecki]], The Limits and Divisions of European History, Sheed & Ward: London and New York 1950, chapter VII</ref> distinguishes two regions in Central Europe: German West-Centre, with imperial tradition of the ''[[Reich]]'', and the East-Centre covered by variety of nations ''from [[Finland]] to [[Greece]]'', placed between great empires of [[Scandinavia]], Germany, [[Italy]] and the [[Soviet Union]].\n* Central Europe as the area of cultural heritage of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] \u2013 [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], [[Belarus]]ian and [[Lithuania]]n historians, in cooperation (since 1990) with [[Poland|Polish]] historians, insist on the importance of the concept.\n* Central Europe as a region connected to the [[western world|Western civilisation]] for a very long time, including countries such as the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], [[Holy Roman Empire]], later [[German Empire]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Crown of Bohemia]]. Central Europe understood in this way borders on [[Russia]] and [[South-Eastern Europe]], but the exact frontier of the region is difficult to determine.\n* Central Europe as the area of cultural heritage of the Habsburg Empire (later [[Austria-Hungary]]) \u2013 a concept which is popular in regions along the [[Danube River]]: [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]], large parts of [[Romania]] and [[Serbia]], and smaller parts of [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]]\n[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|right|[[Austria-Hungary|Habsburg-ruled lands]]]]\n* A concept underlining the links connecting [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]] with [[Russia]] and treating the [[Russian Empire]] together with the whole [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] population as one entity \u2013 this position is taken by the [[Russia]]n historiography.\n* A concept putting an accent on the links with the West, especially from the 19th century and the grand period of liberation and formation of Nation-states \u2013 this idea is represented by in the [[South-Eastern Europe|South-Eastern]] states, which prefer the enlarged concept of the \"East Centre\" expressing their links with the [[Western culture]].\n\nAccording to [[Ronald Tiersky]], the 1991 summit held in [[Visegr\u00e1d]], [[Hungary]] and attended by the [[Poland|Polish]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] presidents was hailed at the time as a major breakthrough in Central European cooperation, but the [[Visegr\u00e1d Group]] became a vehicle for coordinating Central Europe's road to the European Union, while development of closer ties within the region languished.<ref name=\"Tiersky, p. 472\">[[Ronald Tiersky|Tiersky]], p. 472</ref>\n\n[[Peter J. Katzenstein]] described Central Europe as a way station in a Europeanization process that marks the transformation process of the [[Visegr\u00e1d Group]] countries in different, though comparable ways.<ref name=\"Peter J p. 6\">[[Peter J. Katzenstein|Katzenstein]], p. 6</ref> According to him, in Germany's contemporary public discourse \"Central European identity\" refers to the civilizational divide between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.<ref name=\"Peter J p. 6\" /> He says there's no precise, uncontestable way to decide whether the Baltic states, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, and Bulgaria are parts of Central Europe or not.<ref name=\"Peter J p. 4\">[[Peter J.

In 1222 Hungary defined for the first time the rights of the nobility in its \"Golden Bull\". In 1264 the Statute of Kalisz and the General Charter of Jewish Liberties introduced numerous rights for the Jews in Poland, granting them de facto autonomy. In 1783 for the first time, Poland forbid corporal punishment of children in schools. In the same year, a German state of Baden banned slavery.\n\nOn the other hand, there were also major regressions, such as \"Nihil novi\" in Poland in 1505 which forbade peasants from leaving their land without permission from their feudal lord.\n\n====Present====\nGenerally, the countries in the region are progressive on the issue of human rights: death penalty is illegal in all of them, corporal punishment is outlawed in most of them and people of both genders can vote in elections. Nevertheless, Central European countries struggle to adopt new generations of human rights, such as [[same-sex marriage]].

However, most of them have been impacted by totalitarian rule, particularly Nazism (Germany, Austria, other occupied countries) and Communism. Most of Central Europe have been occupied and later allied with the USSR, often against their will through forged referendum (e.g., [[Polish people's referendum, 1946|Polish people's referendum in 1946]]) or force (northeast Germany, Poland, Hungary et alia).

The Shield mostly consists of eroded hilly terrain and contains many lakes and important rivers used for [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] production, particularly in northern Quebec and Ontario. The shield also encloses an area of [[wetlands]], the [[Hudson Bay]] lowlands.

[[Boreal forest]] covers much of the shield, with a mix of [[conifers]] that provide valuable timber resources in areas such as the [[Central Canadian Shield forests]] [[ecoregion]] that covers much of [[Northern Ontario]]. The region is known for its extensive mineral reserves.<ref name=\"SonPress2002\"/>\n\nThe Canadian Shield is known for its vast minerals, such as emeralds, diamonds and copper. The Canadian shield is also called the mineral house.\n\n===Canadian Interior Plains===\n\nThe [[Canadian Prairies]] are part of a vast [[sedimentary]] [[Great Plains|plain]] covering much of [[Alberta]], southern Saskatchewan, and southwestern Manitoba, as well as much of the region between the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Great Slave Lake|Great Slave]] and [[Great Bear Lake|Great Bear]] lakes in [[Northwest Territories]]. The plains generally describes the expanses of (largely flat) arable agricultural land which sustain extensive grain farming operations in the southern part of the provinces. Despite this, some areas such as the [[Cypress Hills (Canada)|Cypress Hills]] and the Alberta Badlands are quite hilly and the prairie provinces contain large areas of forest such as the [[Mid-Continental Canadian forests]]. The size is roughly ~{{convert|1900000|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Western Cordillera===\n\nThe [[Canadian Cordillera]], contiguous with the [[American cordillera]], is bounded by the Rocky Mountains to the east and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west.\n\nThe [[Canadian Rockies]] are part of a major [[continental divide]] that extends north and south through western North America and western [[South America]]. The [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and the [[Fraser River]]s have their headwaters in the Canadian Rockies and are the second and third largest rivers respectively to drain to the west coast of North America.  To the west of their headwaters, across the [[Rocky Mountain Trench]], is a second belt of mountains, the [[Columbia Mountains]], comprising the [[Selkirk Mountains|Selkirk]], [[Purcell Mountains|Purcell]], [[Monashee Mountains|Monashee]] and [[Cariboo Mountains]] sub-ranges.\n\nImmediately west of the Columbia Mountains is a large and rugged [[Interior Plateau]], encompassing the [[Chilcotin District|Chilcotin]] and [[Cariboo]] regions in central [[British Columbia]] (the [[Fraser Plateau]]), the [[Nechako Plateau]] further north, and also the [[Thompson Plateau]] in the south. The [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] Valley in northeastern British Columbia is Canada's most northerly agricultural region, although it is part of the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]]. The dry, temperate climate of the [[Okanagan]] Valley in south central British Columbia provides ideal conditions for fruit growing and a flourishing wine industry; the semi-arid belt of the Southern Interior also includes the [[Fraser Canyon]], and [[Thompson Country|Thompson]], [[Nicola Country|Nicola]], [[Similkameen Country|Similkameen]], [[Shuswap Country|Shuswap]] and [[Boundary Country|Boundary regions]] and fruit-growing is common in these areas also, and also in the [[Kootenays|West Kootenay]]. Between the plateau and the coast is the province's largest mountain range, the [[Coast Mountains]]. The Coast Mountains contain some of the largest temperate-latitude [[icefield]]s in the world.\n\nOn the south coast of British Columbia, [[Vancouver Island]] is separated from the mainland by the continuous [[Strait of Juan de Fuca|Juan de Fuca]], [[Strait of Georgia|Georgia]], and [[Johnstone Strait]]s. Those straits include a large number of islands, notably the [[Gulf Islands]] and [[Discovery Islands]]. North, near the [[Alaska]]n border, [[Haida Gwaii]] lies across [[Hecate Strait]] from the [[Coast of British Columbia|North Coast region]] and to its north, across [[Dixon Entrance]] from [[Southeast Alaska]]. Other than in the plateau regions of the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior]] and its many river valleys, most of British Columbia is coniferous forest. The only [[temperate rain forests]] in Canada are found along the Pacific Coast in the Coast Mountains, on Vancouver Island, and on Haida Gwaii, and in the [[Cariboo Mountains]] on the eastern flank of the Plateau.\n\nThe Western Cordillera continues northwards past the [[Liard River]] in northernmost British Columbia to include the [[Mackenzie Mountains|Mackenzie]] and [[Selwyn Range (Canada)|Selwyn Range]]s which lie in the far western [[Northwest Territories]] and the eastern [[Yukon Territory]].  West of them is the large [[Yukon Plateau]] and, west of that, the [[Yukon Ranges]] and [[Saint Elias Mountains]], which include Canada's and British Columbia's highest summits, [[Mount Saint Elias]] in the [[Kluane]] region and [[Mount Fairweather]] in the [[Tatshenshini-Alsek]] region.  The headwaters of the [[Yukon River]], the largest and longest of the rivers on the [[Pacific Slope]], lie in northern British Columbia at [[Atlin Lake|Atlin]] and [[Teslin Lake]]s.\n\n===Volcanoes===\n{{Main|Volcanology of Canada}}\n\n[[Image:Mount Garibaldi.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Mount Garibaldi]] as seen from [[Squamish, British Columbia|Squamish]] ]]\n[[Western Canada]] has many volcanoes and is part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], a system of volcanoes found around the margins of the Pacific Ocean. There are over 200 young volcanic centres that stretch northward from the [[Cascade Range]] to [[Yukon]]. They are grouped into five [[volcanic belt]]s with different volcano types and [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] settings. The [[Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province]] was formed by [[Fault (geology)|faulting]], cracking, [[rift]]ing, and the interaction between the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]]. The [[Garibaldi Volcanic Belt]] was formed by [[subduction]] of the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] beneath the North American Plate. The [[Anahim Volcanic Belt]] was formed as a result of the North American Plate sliding westward over the [[Anahim hotspot]]. The [[Chilcotin Group]] is believed to have formed as a result of [[back-arc basin|back-arc extension]] behind the [[Cascadia subduction zone]]. The [[Wrangell Volcanic Field]] formed as a result of subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate at the easternmost end of the [[Aleutian Trench]].\n\nVolcanism has also occurred in the [[Canadian Shield]]. It contains over 150 volcanic belts (now deformed and eroded down to nearly flat [[plain]]s) that range from 600 million to 2.8 billion years old. Many of Canada's major [[ore]] deposits are associated with [[Precambrian]] volcanoes. There are [[pillow lava]]s in the [[Northwest Territories]] that are about 2.6 billion years old and are preserved in the [[Cameron River Volcanic Belt]]. The pillow lavas in rocks over 2 billion years old in the Canadian Shield signify that great oceanic volcanoes existed during the early stages of the formation of the Earth's crust. Ancient volcanoes play an important role in estimating Canada's mineral potential. Many of the volcanic belts bear ore deposits that are related to the volcanism.\n\n===Canadian Arctic===\n{{Main|Northern Canada}}\n\nWhile the largest part of the Canadian Arctic is composed of seemingly endless permafrost and [[tundra]] north of the [[tree line]], it encompasses geological regions of varying types: the [[Arctic Cordillera]] (with the [[British Empire Range]] and the [[United States Range]] on [[Ellesmere Island]]) contains the northernmost mountain system in the world. The [[Arctic Lowlands]] and Hudson Bay lowlands comprise a substantial part of the geographic region often designated as the Canadian Shield (in contrast to the sole geologic area). The ground in the Arctic is mostly composed of [[permafrost]], making construction difficult and often hazardous, and agriculture virtually impossible.\n\nThe Arctic, when defined as everything north of the tree line, covers most of [[Nunavut]] and the northernmost parts of Northwest Territories, Yukon, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and Labrador.\n\n==Hydrography==\n{{Canada provinces map\n |align=right\n |prefix = List of rivers of\n |the=the\n |map=Canada-Drainage.png\n |caption = Drainage basins of Canada\n}}\n\nCanada holds vast reserves of water: its rivers discharge nearly 9% of the world's renewable water supply,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/freshwater/distribution/1 | author= Atlas of Canada | title= Distribution of Freshwater |date=February 2004 | accessdate=2007-02-01}}</ref> it contains a quarter of the world's wetlands, and it has the third largest amount of [[glacier]]s (after [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]]).

It covers Manitoba, northern Ontario and Quebec, most of Saskatchewan, southern Alberta, southwestern Nunavut and the southern half of [[Baffin Island]]. This basin is most important in fighting [[drought]] in the [[Canadian Prairies|prairies]] and producing hydroelectricity, especially in Manitoba, northern Ontario and Quebec. Major elements of this watershed include [[Lake Winnipeg]], Nelson River, the North Saskatchewan and [[South Saskatchewan River]]s, [[Assiniboine River]], and [[Nettilling Lake]] on Baffin Island. [[Wollaston Lake]] lies on the boundary between the Hudson Bay and Arctic Ocean watersheds and drains into both. It is the largest lake in the world that naturally drains in two directions.<ref name=canadian/>\n\nThe [[Continental Divide of the Americas|continental divide]] in the Rockies separates the Pacific watershed in British Columbia and Yukon from the Arctic and Hudson Bay watersheds. This watershed irrigates the agriculturally important areas of inner British Columbia (such as the [[Okanagan River|Okanagan]] and [[Kootenay River|Kootenay]] valleys), and is used to produce hydroelectricity. Major elements are the Yukon, [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and Fraser rivers.<ref name=canadian/>\n\nThe northern parts of Alberta, Manitoba and British Columbia, most of Northwest Territories and Nunavut, and parts of Yukon are drained by the Arctic watershed. This watershed has been little used for hydroelectricity, with the exception of the [[Mackenzie River]], the longest river in Canada. The [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace]], Athabasca and [[Liard River]]s, as well as Great Bear Lake and Great Slave Lake (respectively the largest and second largest lakes wholly enclosed by Canada) are significant elements of the Arctic watershed. Each of these elements eventually merges with the Mackenzie, thereby draining the vast majority of the Arctic watershed.<ref name=canadian/>\n\nThe southernmost part of Alberta drains into the Gulf of Mexico through the [[Milk River (Montana-Alberta)|Milk River]] and its tributaries. The Milk River originates in the Rocky Mountains of [[Montana]], then flows into Alberta, then returns into the United States, where it is drained by the [[Missouri River]]. A small area of southwestern Saskatchewan is drained by [[Battle Creek (Milk River)|Battle Creek]], which empties into the Milk River.<ref name=canadian/>\n\n==Floristic geography==\n[[Image:portneuf.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mixed forest]] landscape in R\u00e9serve Faunique de Portneuf, Quebec]]\n{{Main|Ecoregions of Canada (disambiguation)}}\n{{See also|Flora of Canada|Fauna of Canada|Forests of Canada}}\n\nCanada has produced a [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] in response to the 1992 international accord; the plan addresses conservation of [[endangered species]] and certain habitats.

This leaves the vast majority of Canada's territory as sparsely populated wilderness; Canada's population density is 3.5 people/km<sup>2</sup> (9.1/mi<sup>2</sup>), among the lowest in the world. Despite this, 79.7 percent of Canada's population resides in [[Urban area|urban]] areas, where population densities are increasing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo62a-eng.htm|title=Population, urban and rural, by province and territory (Canada)|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-01-30}}</ref>\n\nCanada shares with the U.S. the world's [[Canada\u2013United States border|longest undefended border]] at {{convert|8893|km|mi}}; {{convert|2477|km|mi}} are with [[Alaska]].

Canada's position between the [[Soviet Union]] (now [[Russia]]) and the U.S. was strategically important during the [[Cold War]] since the route over the North Pole and Canada was the fastest route by air between the two countries and the most direct route for [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s.  Since the end of the Cold War, there has been growing speculation that [[Canadian Arctic|Canada's Arctic]] maritime claims may become increasingly important if [[global warming]] melts the ice enough to open the [[Northwest Passage]].\n\nSimilarly, the disputed\u2014and tiny\u2014[[Hans Island]] (with Denmark), in the [[Nares Strait]] between [[Ellesmere Island]] and northern Greenland, may be a flashpoint for challenges to overall claims of Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic.<ref name=Hans/>\n\n==Natural resources==\n{{see also|History of the petroleum industry in Canada}}\nCanada's abundance of [[natural resource]]s is reflected in their continued importance in the [[economy of Canada]].

Unmatched [[cod]] stocks on the [[Grand Banks]] off Newfoundland launched this industry in the 16th century. Today these stocks are nearly depleted, and their conservation has become a preoccupation of the [[Atlantic Provinces]]. On the West Coast, [[tuna]] stocks are now restricted. The less depleted (but still greatly diminished) [[salmon]] population continues to drive a strong fisheries industry. Canada claims {{convert|12|nmi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of territorial sea, a contiguous zone of {{convert|24|nmi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}, an [[exclusive economic zone]] of {{convert|200|nmi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} and a continental shelf of {{convert|200|nmi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} or to the edge of the continental margin.\n\nForestry has long been a major industry in Canada. Forest products contribute one fifth of the nation's exports. The provinces with the largest forestry industries are British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. Fifty-four percent of Canada's land area is covered in forest. The boreal forests account for four-fifths of Canada's forestland.\n\n[[Image:Grain Elevator 047.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Albertan [[grain elevator]]s]]\nFive per cent of Canada's land area is arable, none of which is for permanent crops. Three per cent of Canada's land area is covered by permanent pastures. Canada has 7,200 square kilometres (2,800&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>) of irrigated land (1993 estimate). Agricultural regions in Canada include the Canadian Prairies, the [[Lower Mainland]] and various regions within the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior of British Columbia]], the [[St. Lawrence Basin]] and the Canadian [[Maritimes]]. Main crops in Canada include [[flax]], [[oat]]s, [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[barley]], [[sugar beet]]s and [[rye]] in the prairies; flax and maize in [[Western Ontario]]; Oats and [[potato]]es in the Maritimes. [[Fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s are grown primarily in the [[Annapolis Valley]] of Nova Scotia, [[Southwestern Ontario]], the [[Golden Horseshoe]] region of Ontario, along the south coast of [[Georgian Bay]] and in the [[Okanagan]] Valley of British Columbia. [[Cattle]] and [[domestic sheep|sheep]] are raised in the valleys and plateaus of British Columbia. Cattle, sheep and [[Hog (swine)|hog]]s are raised on the prairies, cattle and hogs in Western Ontario, sheep and hogs in Quebec, and sheep in the Maritimes. There are significant [[dairy]] regions in central Nova Scotia, southern New Brunswick, the St. Lawrence Valley, [[northeastern Ontario]], southwestern Ontario, the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] valley of Manitoba and the valleys in the [[British Columbia Interior]], on [[Vancouver Island]] and in the [[Lower Mainland]].\n\nFossil fuels are a more recently developed resource in Canada, with [[petroleum|oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] being extracted from deposits in the [[Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin]] since the mid 1900s. While Canada's [[crude oil]] deposits are fewer, technological developments in recent decades have opened up oil production in Alberta's [[Oil Sands]] to the point where Canada now has some of the largest reserves of oil in the world. In other forms, Canadian industry has a long history of extracting large [[coal]] and natural gas reserves.\n\nCanada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive. Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large [[iron]], [[nickel]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[gold]], [[lead]], [[molybdenum]], and [[uranium]] reserves. Large [[diamond]] concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic, making Canada one of the world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the [[Sudbury Basin]] is an ancient [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]]. The nearby, but less known [[Temagami Magnetic Anomaly]] has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.<ref name=\"GH\">{{cite web |website=Geological Survey of Canada |url=http://gdcinfo.agg.nrcan.gc.ca/app/3Dimaging/temagami_e.html |title=3-D Magnetic Imaging using Conjugate Gradients: Temagami anomaly |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711184237/http://gdcinfo.agg.nrcan.gc.ca/app/3Dimaging/temagami_e.html |archive-date=2009-07-11 |access-date=2008-03-13}}</ref> The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important [[logging]] industry.\n\nCanada's many rivers have afforded extensive development of hydroelectric power. Extensively developed in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and Labrador, the many dams have long provided a clean, dependable source of energy.\n\n==Natural hazards==\n{{See also|Drought in Canada|Drought Research Initiative}}\nContinuous permafrost in the north is a serious obstacle to development. Cyclonic storms form east of the Rocky Mountains, a result of the mixing of air masses from the Arctic, Pacific, and North American interior, and produce most of the country's rain and snow east of the mountains.\n\n==Current environmental issues==\n{{main|Environmental issues in Canada}}\nAir pollution and resulting [[acid rain]] severely affects lakes and damages forests.<ref name=\"Boyd2011\">{{cite book|author=David R Boyd|title=Unnatural Law: Rethinking Canadian Environmental Law and Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeYgVGE9j3EC&pg=PA67|year=2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-4063-7|pages=67\u201369}}</ref> Metal smelting, coal-burning utilities, and vehicle emissions impact agricultural and forest productivity.

The [[Two-party system|two dominant political parties]] in Canada have historically been the  [[Liberal Party of Canada]] and the [[Conservative Party of Canada]]   (or its [[Conservative Party of Canada#Predecessors|predecessors]]) however, the social democratic [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) has risen to prominence and even threatened to upset the two other established parties during the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 federal election]]. Smaller parties like the [[Quebec nationalist]] [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] and the [[Green Party of Canada]] have also been able to exert their own influence over the political process. \n\nCanada has evolved variations: [[party discipline]] in Canada is stronger than in the United Kingdom, and more parliamentary votes are considered [[Motion of Confidence|motions of confidence]], which tends to diminish the role of non-[[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] members of parliament (MPs). Such members, in the government [[caucus]], and junior or lower-profile members of [[parliamentary opposition|opposition]] caucuses, are known as [[backbencher]]s. Backbenchers can, however, exert their influence by sitting in parliamentary committees, like the [[Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Accounts|Public Accounts Committee]] or the [[Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security|National Defence Committee]].\n\n==Context==\n{{Canada provinces map|align=right|prefix =Politics of|the=the|caption=A map of Canada's provinces and territories}}\nCanada's governmental structure was originally established by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] through the ''[[British North America Act]]'' (now known as the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''),<ref>''[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/Const/index.html The ''Constitution Act, 1867''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427011140/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/index.html |date=2006-04-27 }}'', s. 6.</ref> but the federal model and division of powers were devised by Canadian politicians. Particularly after World War I, citizens of the self-governing [[Dominion]]s, such as Canada, began to develop a strong sense of identity, and, in the [[Balfour Declaration, 1926|Balfour Declaration]] of 1926, the British government expressed its intent to grant full autonomy to these regions.\n\nThus in 1931, the British Parliament passed the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], giving legal recognition to the autonomy of Canada and other Dominions. Following this, Canadian politicians were unable to obtain consensus on a process for amending the constitution until 1982, meaning amendments to Canada's constitution continued to require the approval of the British parliament until that date. Similarly, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in Britain continued to make the final decision on criminal appeals until 1933 and on civil appeals until 1949.<ref>''[http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/court-cour/creation/index-eng.asp The Creation and Beginnings of the Supreme Court of Canada''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430084251/http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/court-cour/creation/index-eng.asp |date=2009-04-30 }}</ref>\n\n==Political culture==\n{{See|Political culture of Canada}}\nCanada's [[egalitarian]] approach to governance has emphasized [[Social programs in Canada|social welfare]], [[Economy of Canada|economic freedom]], and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multiculturalism]], which is based on selective [[economic migrant]]s, [[social integration]], and [[Suppression of dissent|suppression]] of [[far-right politics]], that has wide public and political support.<ref name=\"Ambrosea\">{{Cite journal|title=Canadian Multiculturalism and the Absence of the Far Right \u2013 Nationalism and Ethnic Politics|journal=Nationalism and Ethnic Politics|volume=21 Issue 2|issue=2|pages=213\u2013236|doi=10.1080/13537113.2015.1032033|year=2015|author1=Emma Ambrosea|author2=Cas Muddea}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/world/canada/canadas-secret-to-resisting-the-wests-populist-wave.html|title=Canada's Secret to Resisting the West's Populist Wave|newspaper=The New York Times|year=2017|last1=Taub|first1=Amanda}}</ref> Its broad range of constituent nationalities and policies that promote a \"[[just society]]\" are constitutionally protected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rand Dyck|title=Canadian Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUOoN8e5Ps0C&pg=PA88|year=2011|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=978-0-17-650343-7|page=88|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412160000/https://books.google.com/books?id=BUOoN8e5Ps0C&pg=PA88|archivedate=April 12, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Newman2012\">{{cite book|author=Stephen L.

Only two adult citizens in Canada cannot vote: the [[Chief Electoral Officer (Canada)|Chief Electoral Officer]], and the Deputy Chief Electoral Officer. The [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] is eligible to vote, but abstains due to [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]. Citizens residing outside of Canada for a period greater than 5 years are excluded from voting beginning 2015.\n\n\n===Monarchy===\n; [[Head of state]]: [[Elizabeth II]], [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]] (since February 6, 1952).\n\n; [[Viceroy]]: [[Julie Payette]], [[Governor General of Canada]] (since October 2, 2017).\n\n===Executive power===\n[[File:Prime Ministers of Canada to 1963.jpg|right|thumb|[[List of Prime Ministers of Canada|Canada's Prime Ministers]] from 1867 to 1963. The [[Prime Minister of Canada]] serves as the [[head of government]].]]\n; [[Head of government]]: Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] (since November 4, 2015).\n\n; Cabinet: [[The Ministry|Ministers]] (usually around thirty) chosen by the Prime Minister and appointed by the Governor General to lead various ministries and agencies, generally with regional representation. Traditionally most, if not all, cabinet ministers will be members of the leader's own party in the House of Commons or Senate (see [[Cabinet of Canada]]); however this is not legally or constitutionally mandated, and occasionally, the Prime Minister will appoint a cabinet minister from another party.\n\n; Elections : The monarchy is hereditary. The Governor-General is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister for a non-specific term, though it is traditionally approximately five years. Following legislative elections, the leader of the majority party in the House of Commons is usually designated by the Governor General to become Prime Minister.\n{{Further|Monarchy of Canada|Monarchy in the Canadian provinces|Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Premier (Canada)|Elections in Canada}}\n\n===Legislative power===\nThe [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Parliament of Canada]] consists of three parts: the [[Monarchy in Canada|monarch]], the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]], and the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]].\n\nCurrently, the Senate, which is frequently described as providing \"regional\" representation, has 105 members appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Prime Minister to serve until age 75. It was created with equal representation from each of Ontario, Quebec, the Maritime region and the Western Provinces. However, it is currently the product of various specific exceptions, additions and compromises, meaning that regional equality is not observed, nor is representation-by-population. The normal number of senators can be exceeded by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister, as long as the additional senators are distributed equally with regard to region (up to a total of eight additional Senators). This power of additional appointment has only been used once, when Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] petitioned [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] to add eight seats to the Senate so as to ensure the passage of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] legislation.\n[[File:Colline du Parlement, \u00c9difice du Centre 04.jpg|thumb|A democratically elected body, the [[House of Commons of Canada]] is one of three components of the [[Parliament of Canada]].]]\nThe House of Commons currently has 338 members elected in [[single-member district]]s in a [[plurality voting system]] (first past the post), meaning that members must attain only a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] (the most votes of any candidate) rather than a [[majority]] (50 percent plus one). The [[Electoral district (Canada)|electoral districts]] are also known as [[Riding (country subdivision)|ridings]].\n\nMandates cannot exceed five years; an election must occur by the end of this time. This fixed mandate has been exceeded only once, when Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] perceived the need to do so during World War I. The size of the House and [[Apportionment (politics)|apportionment]] of seats to each province is revised after every census, conducted every five years, and is based on population changes and approximately on representation-by-population.\n\n===Majority and minority governments===\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2018}}\n[[Canadians]] vote for their local Member of Parliament (MP) only.  An MP need not be a member of any political party: such MPs are known as independents.  When a number of MPs share political opinions they may form a body known as a political party.\n\nThe ''[[Canada Elections Act]]'' defines a political party as \"an organization one of whose fundamental purposes is to participate in public affairs by endorsing one or more of its members as candidates and supporting their election.\" Forming and registering a federal political party are two different things. There is no legislation regulating the formation of federal political parties. Elections Canada cannot dictate how a federal political party should be formed or how its legal, internal and financial structures should be established.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&dir=pol/bck&document=index&lang=e|title=Registration of Federal Political Parties|first=Elections|last=Canada|date=|website=elections.ca|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201235534/http://elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&dir=pol%2Fbck&document=index&lang=e|archivedate=2018-02-01|df=}}</ref>\n\nParties elect their leaders in [[run-off election]]s to ensure that the winner receives more than 50% of the votes. Normally the party leader stands as a candidate to be an MP during an election.  Canada's parliamentary system empowers political parties and their party leaders. Where one party gets a majority of the seats in the House of Commons, that party is said to have a \"majority government.\" Through party discipline, the party leader, who is elected in only one riding, exercises a great deal of control over the cabinet and the parliament.\n\nHistorically the [[prime minister of canada|prime minister]] and senators are selected by the [[governor general of canada|governor general]] as a representative of the Queen, though in modern practice the monarch's duties are ceremonial.  Consequently, the prime minister while technically selected by the governor general is for all practical purposes selected by the party with the majority of seats.  That is, the party that gets the most seats normally forms the government, with that party's leader becoming prime minister. The prime minister is not directly elected by the general population, although the prime minister is almost always directly elected as an MP within his or her constituency.  Again senators while technically selected at the pleasure of the monarch, are ceremonially selected by the governor general at the advice (and for most practical purposes authority) of the prime minister.\n\nA [[minority government]] situation occurs when the party that holds the most seats in the House of Commons holds fewer seats than the opposition parties combined. In this scenario usually the party leader whose party has the most seats in the House is selected by the governor general to lead the government, however, to create stability, the leader chosen must have the support of the majority of the House, meaning they need the support of at least one other party.\n\n==Federal-provincial relations==\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:Mackenzie King with Ferguson and Taschereau.jpg|thumb|[[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] (center), Prime minister of Canada, between [[Howard Ferguson]] (left), Premier of Ontario, and [[Louis-Alexandre Taschereau]](right), Premier of Quebec, at the [[First Ministers' conference|Dominion-Provincial Conference]], 1927.]]\nIn Canada, [[Provinces and territories of Canada|the provinces]] are considered co-sovereign; [[sovereignty]] of the provinces is passed on, not by the Governor General or the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]], but through the Crown itself. This means that the Crown is \"divided\" into 11 legal jurisdictions; into 11 \"Crowns\" \u2013 one federal and ten provincial.\n\nFederal-provincial (or intergovernmental, formerly Dominion-provincial) relations is a regular issue in Canadian politics: Quebec wishes to preserve and strengthen its distinctive nature, western provinces desire more control over their abundant natural resources, especially energy reserves; industrialized Central Canada is concerned with its manufacturing base, and the Atlantic provinces strive to escape from being less affluent than the rest of the country.\n\nIn order to ensure that social programs such as health care and education are funded consistently throughout Canada, the \"have-not\" (poorer) provinces receive a proportionately greater share of federal \"[[equalization payments|transfer (equalization) payments]]\" than the richer, or \"have\", provinces do; this has been somewhat controversial. The richer provinces often favour freezing transfer payments, or rebalancing the system in their favour, based on the claim that they already pay more in taxes than they receive in federal government services, and the poorer provinces often favour an increase on the basis that the amount of money they receive is not sufficient for their existing needs.\n\nParticularly in the past decade, some scholars have argued that the federal government's exercise of its unlimited constitutional spending power has contributed to strained federal-provincial relations. This power, which allows the federal government to spend the revenue it raises in any way that it pleases, allows it to overstep the constitutional division of powers by creating programs that encroach on areas of provincial jurisdiction. The federal spending power is not expressly set out in the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''; however, in the words of the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] the power \"can be inferred\" from s. 91(1A), \"the public debt and property\".<ref>[http://canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2004/2004canlii15104/2004canlii15104.html ''Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. v. Iness''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712162257/http://canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2004/2004canlii15104/2004canlii15104.html |date=2012-07-12 }}, 2004 CanLII 15104 at paragraph 25.</ref>\n\nA prime example of an exercise of the spending power is the ''[[Canada Health Act]]'', which is a conditional grant of money to the provinces. Regulation of health services is, under the Constitution, a provincial responsibility. However, by making the funding available to the provinces under the ''Canada Health Act'' contingent upon delivery of services according to federal standards, the federal government has the ability to influence health care delivery. This spending power, coupled with Supreme Court rulings \u2013 such as [[Reference re Canada Assistance Plan (B.C.)]] \u2013 that have held that funding delivered under the spending power can be reduced unilaterally at any time, has contributed to strained federal-provincial relations.\n\n===Quebec and Canadian politics===\nExcept for three short-lived transitional or minority governments, prime ministers from [[Quebec]] led Canada continuously from 1968 to early 2006. Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois led both [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] and [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] governments in this period.\n\nMonarchs, governors general, and prime ministers are now expected to be at least functional, if not fluent, in both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[French language in Canada|French]]. In selecting leaders, political parties give preference to candidates who are fluently bilingual.\n\nAlso, by law, three of the nine positions on the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] must be held by judges from Quebec. This representation makes sure that at least three judges have sufficient experience with the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system to treat cases involving Quebec laws.<ref name=\"2014 SCC 21\">{{cite web|title=Reference re Supreme Court Act, ss. 5 and 6|url=https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2014/2014scc21/2014scc21.html|website=CanLII|accessdate=August 5, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140505164818/http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2014/2014scc21/2014scc21.html|archivedate=May 5, 2014|df=}}</ref>\n\n==National unity==\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2018}}\nCanada has a long and storied history of secessionist movements (see [[Secessionist movements of Canada]]). National unity has been a major issue in Canada since the forced union of [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]] in 1840.\n\nThe predominant and lingering issue concerning Canadian national unity has been the ongoing conflict between the French-speaking majority in Quebec and the English-speaking majority in the rest of Canada. Quebec's continued demands for recognition of its \"[[distinct society]]\" through special political status has led to attempts for constitutional reform, most notably with the failed attempts to amend the constitution through the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and the [[Charlottetown Accord]] (the latter of which was rejected through a national [[referendum]]).\n\nSince the [[Quiet Revolution]], sovereigntist sentiments in Quebec have been variably stoked by the [[Canada Act 1982|patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982]] (without Quebec's consent) and by the failed attempts at constitutional reform. Two provincial referenda, in [[1980 Quebec referendum|1980]] and [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995]], rejected proposals for sovereignty with majorities of 60% and 50.6% respectively. Given the narrow federalist victory in 1995, a reference was made by the [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien|Chr\u00e9tien]] government to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in 1998 regarding the [[Re Secession of Quebec|legality of unilateral provincial secession]]. The court decided that a unilateral declaration of secession would be unconstitutional. This resulted in the passage of the ''[[Clarity Act]]'' in 2000.\n\nThe [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]], a sovereigntist party which runs candidates exclusively in [[Quebec]], was started by a group of MPs who left the Progressive Conservative (PC) party (along with several disaffected Liberal MPs), and first put forward candidates in the 1993 federal election. With the collapse of the PCs in that election, the Bloc and Liberals were seen as the only two viable parties in Quebec. Thus, prior to the 2006 election, any gain by one party came at the expense of the other, regardless of whether national unity was really at issue. The Bloc, then, benefited (with a significant increase in seat total) from the impressions of corruption that surrounded the Liberal Party in the leadup to the 2004 election. However, the newly unified Conservative party re-emerged as a viable party in Quebec by winning 10 seats in the 2006 election.  In the 2011 election, the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] succeeded in winning 59 of Quebec's 75 seats, successfully reducing the number of seats of every other party substantially.  The NDP surge nearly destroyed the Bloc, reducing them to 4 seats, far below the minimum requirement of 12 seats for [[Official party status]].\n\n[[Newfoundland and Labrador]] is also a problem regarding national unity. As the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] was a self-governing country equal to Canada until 1949, there are large, though uncoordinated, feelings of Newfoundland nationalism and anti-Canadian sentiment among much of the population. This is due in part to the perception of chronic [[Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|federal mismanagement of the fisheries]], [[Resettlement (Newfoundland)|forced resettlement]] away from isolated settlements in the 1960s, the government of Quebec still drawing inaccurate political maps whereby [[Labrador#Boundary dispute|they take parts of Labrador]], and to the perception that mainland Canadians look down upon Newfoundlanders. In 2004, the [[Newfoundland and Labrador First Party]] contested provincial elections and in 2008 in federal ridings within the province. In 2004, then-premier [[Danny Williams (politician)|Danny Williams]] ordered all federal flags removed from government buildings as a result of lost offshore revenues to equalization clawbacks.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/maple-leaf-flags-removed-in-offshore-feud-1.494970 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084310/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/maple-leaf-flags-removed-in-offshore-feud-1.494970 |archivedate=2014-08-19 |df= }}{{cite web|title=Maple Leaf flags removed in offshore feud|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/maple-leaf-flags-removed-in-offshore-feud-1.494970|website=CBC News|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=16 August 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084310/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/maple-leaf-flags-removed-in-offshore-feud-1.494970|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=}}</ref> On December 23, 2004, premier Williams made this statement to reporters in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], {{quote| \"They basically slighted us, they are not treating us as a proper partner in Confederation.

Residents of the four western provinces, particularly Alberta, have often been unhappy with a lack of influence and a perceived lack of understanding when residents of Central Canada consider \"national\" issues. While this is seen to play itself out through many avenues (media, commerce, and so on.), in politics, it has given rise to a number of political parties whose base constituency is in western Canada. These include the [[United Farmers of Alberta]], who first won federal seats in 1917, the [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressives]] (1921), the [[Social Credit Party of Canada|Social Credit Party]] (1935), the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (1935), the [[Reconstruction Party]] (1935), [[New Democracy (Canada)|New Democracy]] (1940) and most recently the [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] (1989).\n\nThe Reform Party's slogan \"The West Wants In\" was echoed by commentators when, after a successful merger with the PCs, the successor party to both parties, the Conservative Party won the 2006 election. Led by Stephen Harper, who is an MP from Alberta, the electoral victory was said to have made \"The West IS In\" a reality. However, regardless of specific electoral successes or failures, the concept of western alienation continues to be important in Canadian politics, particularly on a provincial level, where opposing the federal government is a common tactic for provincial politicians. For example, in 2001, a group of prominent Albertans produced the [[Alberta Agenda]], urging Alberta to take steps to make full use of its constitutional powers, much as Quebec has done.\n\n==Political conditions==\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2018}}\nCanada is considered by most sources to be a very stable democracy. In 2006, ''[[The Economist]]'' ranked Canada the third-most democratic nation in its [[Democracy Index]], ahead of all other nations in the Americas and ahead of every nation more populous than itself. In 2008, Canada was ranked World No. 11 and again ahead of all countries more populous and No. 1 for the Americas. (In 2008, the United States was ranked World No. 18, Uruguay World No. 23, and Costa Rica World No. 27.)\n\nThe [[Liberal Party of Canada]], under the leadership of Paul Martin,<ref>Aucoin, Peter. ''The democratic deficit: Paul Martin and parliamentary reform'', Canadian Public Administration, Jan 1, 2003, Vol. 46, No. 4 (Winter 2003), p. 427.</ref> won a minority victory in the June [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 general elections]]. In December 2003, Martin had succeeded fellow Liberal Jean Chr\u00e9tien, who had, in 2000, become the first prime minister to lead three consecutive majority governments since 1945. However, in 2004 the Liberals lost seats in Parliament, going from 172 of 301 parliamentary seats to 135 of 308, and from 40.9% to 36.7% in the popular vote. The [[Canadian Alliance]], which did well in western Canada in the 2000 election but was unable to make significant inroads in the East, merged with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] to form the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] in late 2003.\n\nThey proved to be moderately successful in the 2004 campaign, gaining seats from a combined Alliance-PC total of 78 in 2000 to 99 in 2004. However, the new Conservatives lost in popular vote, going from 37.7% in 2000 down to 29.6%. In 2006, the Conservatives, led by Stephen Harper, won a minority government with 124 seats. They improved their percentage from 2004, garnering 36.3% of the vote. During this election, the Conservatives also made major breakthroughs in Quebec. They gained 10 seats here, whereas in 2004 they had no seats.\n\nAt the [[2011 Canadian federal election|2011 federal election]], the Conservatives won a majority government with 167 seats. For the first time, the NDP became the Official Opposition, with 102 seats; the Liberals finished in third place with 34 seats. This was the first election in which the Green Party won a seat, that of leader [[Elizabeth May]]; the Bloc won 4 seats, losing official party status.\n\n===Realignment: Conservatives in power===\n{{See also|Realigning election#Canada}}\n[[File:Canada Federal Election 2004-2011.gif|right|250px|thumb|Political shift in Canada in the 21st century]]\n[[File:GoverningPoliticalPartyByProvince.png|right|250px|thumb|The governing political party(s) in each Canadian province. Multicolored provinces are governed by a coalition or minority government consisting of more than one party.]]\n\nThe Liberal Party, after dominating Canadian politics since the 1920s, was in decline in early years of the 21st century. As [[Eugene Lang (minister)|Lang]] (2010) concluded, they lost their majority in Parliament in the 2004 election, were defeated in 2006, and in 2008 became little more than a \"rump\", falling to their lowest seat count in decades and a mere 26% of the popular vote. Furthermore, said Lang (a Liberal himself), its prospects \"are as bleak as they have ever been.\"<ref>Eugene Lang, \"Whither the Liberals? Current State and Prospects of the Liberal Party of Canada,\" ''The Journal for International Relations and Global Trends,'' (2010) p. 195 [http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/ipg/ipg-2010-4/lang.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309234018/http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/ipg/ipg-2010-4/lang.pdf |date=2012-03-09 }}.</ref> In the 2011 election, the Liberals suffered a crushing defeat, managing to secure only 18.9% of the vote share and only 34 seats.  As a result, the Liberals lost their status as official opposition to the NDP.\n\nIn explaining those trends, Behiels (2010) synthesized major studies and reported that \"a great many journalists, political advisors, and politicians argue that a new political party paradigm is emerging\"<ref>Behiels cites Tom Flanagan, ''Harper's Team: Behind the Scenes in the Conservative Rise to Power'' (2nd ed.

Personal donations to federal parties and campaigns benefit from tax credits, although the amount of tax relief depends on the amount given. Also only people paying income taxes receive any benefit from this.\n\nA good part of the reasoning behind the change in funding was that union or business funding should not be allowed to have as much impact on federal election funding as these are not contributions from citizens and are not evenly spread out between parties. They are still allowed to contribute to the election but only in a minor fashion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The new rules stated that a party had to receive 2% of the vote nationwide in order to receive the general federal funding for parties. Each vote garnered a certain dollar amount for a party (approximately $1.75) in future funding. For the initial disbursement, approximations were made based on previous elections. The NDP received more votes than expected (its national share of the vote went up) while the new Conservative Party of Canada received fewer votes than had been estimated and was asked to refund the difference. [[Quebec]] was the first province to implement a similar system of funding many years before the changes to funding of federal parties.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n[[Federal political financing in Canada|Federal funds]] are disbursed quarterly to parties, beginning at the start of 2005. For the moment, this disbursement delay leaves the NDP and the Green Party in a better position to fight an election, since they rely more on individual contributors than federal funds.

There are two types of departments: central agencies such as Finance, Privy Council Office, and Treasury Board Secretariat have an organizing and oversight role for the entire public service; line departments are departments which perform tasks in a specific area or field, such as the departments of Agriculture, Environment, or Defence.\n\n*Significant departments include [[Department of Finance (Canada)|Finance]], [[Canada Revenue Agency|Revenue]], [[Human Resources and Skills Development Canada|Human Resources and Skills Development]], [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|National Defence]], [[Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada|Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness]], and [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Foreign Affairs]]/[[Department of International Trade (Canada)|International Trade]].\n{{Further|Structure of the Canadian federal government}}\n\nScholar Peter Aucoin, writing about the Canadian Westminster system, has raised concerns in the early 2000s about the centralization of power; an increased number, role and influence of partisan-political staff; personal-politicization of appointments to the senior public service; and, the assumption that the public service is promiscuously partisan for the government of the day.<ref>Aucoin, Peter (2008). ''New Public Management and the Quality of Government: Coping with the New Political Governance in Canada'', Conference on \"New Public Management and the Quality of Government\", SOG and the Quality of Government Institute, University of Gothenburg, Sweden, 13\u201315 November 2008, p.14.</ref>\n\n==Immigration==\nIn 1967, Canada established a point-based system to determine if immigrants should be eligible to enter the country, using meritorious qualities such as the applicant's ability to speak both [[French people|French]] and [[English language|English]], their level of education, and other details that may be expected of a natural-born Canadian. This system was considered ground-breaking at the time since prior systems were slanted on the basis of ethnicity. However, many foreign nationals still found it challenging to secure work after emigrating, resulting in a higher unemployment rate amongst the immigrant population. After winning power at the [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006 federal election]], the [[Conservative Party (Canada)|Conservative Party]] has sought to curb this issue by placing weight on whether or not the applicant has a standing job offer in Canada. The change has been a source of some contention as opponents argue that businesses use this change to suppress wages, with corporate owners leveraging the knowledge that an immigrant should hold a job to successfully complete the immigration process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21638191-canada-used-prize-immigrants-who-would-make-good-citizens-now-people-job-offers-have|title=No country for old men|author=|date=|website=The Economist|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725151331/http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21638191-canada-used-prize-immigrants-who-would-make-good-citizens-now-people-job-offers-have|archivedate=2017-07-25|df=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Canadian politics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*[[Australia\u2013Canada relations]]\n*[[Canadian nationalism]]\n*[[Conservatism in Canada]]\n*[[Council of the Federation]]\n*[[Federal political financing in Canada]]\n*[[Liberalism in Canada]]\n*[[List of Canadian federal general elections]]\n*[[List of Canadian federal electoral districts]]\n*[[List of Canadian political scandals]]\n*[[List of political parties in Canada]]\n*[[Political culture of Canada]]\n*[[Progressivism]]\n*[[Socialism and social democracy in Canada]]\n*[[Ten Percenter]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Argyle, Ray.

Many, if not most, towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, exist because of a nearby mine or source of timber. Canada is a world leader in the production of many natural resources such as [[gold]], [[nickel]], [[uranium mining in Canada|uranium]], [[Canadian diamonds|diamonds]], [[lead]], and in recent years, [[petroleum industry in Canada|crude petroleum]], which, with the world's second-largest oil reserves, is taking an increasingly prominent position in natural resources extraction. Several of Canada's largest companies are based in natural resource industries, such as [[Encana]], [[Cameco]], [[Goldcorp]], and [[Barrick Gold]]. The vast majority of these products are exported, mainly to the United States. There are also many secondary and service industries that are directly linked to primary ones. For instance one of Canada's largest manufacturing industries is the [[pulp and paper]] sector, which is directly linked to the [[Forestry in Canada|logging]] business.\n\nThe reliance on natural resources has several effects on the Canadian economy and Canadian society. While manufacturing and service industries are easy to standardize, natural resources vary greatly by region. This ensures that differing economic structures developed in each region of Canada, contributing to Canada's strong regionalism. At the same time the vast majority of these resources are exported, integrating Canada closely into the international economy. Howlett and Ramesh argue that the inherent instability of such industries also contributes to greater government intervention in the economy, to reduce the social impact of market changes.<ref>Howlett, Michael and M. Ramesh. ''Political Economy of Canada: An Introduction.'' Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1992.</ref>\n\nNatural resource industries also raise important questions of sustainability. Despite many decades as a leading producer, there is little risk of depletion. Large discoveries continue to be made, such as the massive nickel find at [[Voisey's Bay]]. Moreover, the far north remains largely undeveloped as producers await higher prices or new technologies as many operations in this region are not yet cost effective. In recent decades Canadians have become less willing to accept the environmental destruction associated with exploiting natural resources. High wages and Aboriginal land claims have also curbed expansion. Instead many Canadian companies have focused their exploration, exploitation and expansion activities overseas where prices are lower and governments more amenable. Canadian companies are increasingly playing important roles in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.\n\nThe depletion of renewable resources has raised concerns in recent years. After decades of escalating [[overutilization]] the [[Cod fisheries|cod fishery]] all but collapsed in the 1990s, and the Pacific salmon industry also suffered greatly. The [[Forestry in Canada|logging]] industry, after many years of activism, has in recent years moved to a more sustainable model, or to other countries.\n\n=== Data ===\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017.

This indicator assesses an economy's \"underlying productive capacity ('potential output'), itself an important measure of the growth possibilities of economies and of inflationary pressures\". MFP measures the residual growth that cannot be explained by the rate of change in the services of labour, capital and intermediate outputs, and is often interpreted as the contribution to economic growth made by factors such as technical and organisational innovation. (OECD 2008,11)\n\nAccording to the OECD's annual economic survey of Canada in June 2012, Canada has experienced weak growth of multi-factor productivity (MFP) and has been declining further since 2002. One of the ways MFP growth is raised is by boosting innovation and Canada's innovation indicators such as business R&D and patenting rates were poor. Raising MFP growth is \"needed to sustain rising living standards, especially as the population ages\".<ref name=OECD2012>{{cite report|title=OECD Economic Surveys Canada June 2012 Overview |url=http://www.oecd.org/eco/50543310.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IqRsaqI0?url=http://www.oecd.org/eco/50543310.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-13 |format=PDF |year=2012 |publisher=Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Bank of Canada==\n\n===Inflation targeting===\nThe [[Bank of Canada]], a federal crown corporation, has the responsibility of Canada's monetary system.

As with all other developed nations the proportion of the population and GDP devoted to agriculture fell dramatically over the 20th century.\n\nAs with other developed nations, the Canadian agriculture industry receives significant government subsidies and supports. However, Canada has been a strong supporter of reducing market influencing subsidies through the [[World Trade Organization]]. In 2000, Canada spent approximately CDN$4.6 billion on supports for the industry. Of this, $2.32 billion was classified under the WTO designation of \"green box\" support, meaning it did not directly influence the market, such as money for research or disaster relief. All but $848.2 million were subsidies worth less than 5% of the value of the crops they were provided for.\n\n==Free-trade agreements==\n{{Main|Free-trade agreements of Canada}}\n[[File:FTAs with Canada.svg|thumb|right|275px|{{Legend|#000|Canada}}{{Legend|#393|Free-trade areas}}]]\n\n===Free-trade agreements in force<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/fta-ale.aspx?lang=eng |title=Canada's Free Trade Agreements |publisher=International.gc.ca |accessdate=2013-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312210043/http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/fta-ale.aspx?lang=eng |archive-date=March 12, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref>===\n\n*[[Canada\u2013U.S. Free Trade Agreement]] (Signed 12 October 1987, entered into force 1 January 1989, later superseded by NAFTA)\n*[[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 1 January 1994, includes Canada, U.S. and Mexico)\n*[[Canada\u2013Israel Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 1 January 1997, modernization ongoing)\n*[[Canada\u2013Chile Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 5 July 1997)\n*[[Canada\u2013Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 1 November 2002, modernization ongoing)\n*[[Canada\u2013European Free Trade Association Free Trade Agreement]] (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein; entered into force 01-Jul-2009)\n*[[Canada\u2013Peru Free Trade Agreement]] (Entered into force 1 August 2009)\n*[[Canada\u2013Colombia Free Trade Agreement]] (Signed 21 November 2008, entered into force 15 August 2011; Canada's ratification of this FTA had been dependent upon Colombia's ratification of the \"Agreement Concerning Annual Reports on Human Rights and Free Trade Between Canada and the Republic of Colombia\" signed on 27 May 2010)\n*Canada\u2013Jordan Free Trade Agreement (Signed on 28 June 2009, entered into force 1 October 2012)\n*[[Canada\u2013Panama Free Trade Agreement]] (Signed on 14 May 2010, entered into force 1 April2013)\n*[[Canada\u2013South Korea Free Trade Agreement]] (Signed on 11 March 2014, entered into force 1 January 2015)\n\n===Free-trade agreements concluded<ref name=\"Canada's Free Trade Agreements\">{{cite web |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/fta-ale.aspx?lang=eng |title=Canada's Free Trade Agreements |publisher=International.gc.ca |access-date=March 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312210043/http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/fta-ale.aspx?lang=eng |archive-date=March 12, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref>===\n*[[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (concluded 5 October 2015)\n*[[Canada\u2013Ukraine Free Trade Agreement]] (concluded 14 July 2015)\n*[[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement]] (concluded 5 August 2014)\n\n===Ongoing free-trade agreements negotiations<ref name=\"Canada's Free Trade Agreements\"/>===\n\nCanada is negotiating bilateral FTAs with the following countries respektively trade blocs:\n*Caribbean Community ([[CARICOM]])\n*[[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]]\n*[[Dominican Republic]]\n*[[India]]\n*[[Japan]]<ref>{{cite news|author=The Canadian Press |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2011/02/23/canada-japan-free-trade.html |title=Canada, Japan study free-trade pact|publisher=CBC News |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref>\n*[[Morocco]]\n*[[Singapore]]\n*[[Andean Community]] (FTA's are already in force with Peru and Colombia)\n\nCanada has been involved in negotiations to create the following regional trade blocks:\n\n*[[Canada and Central American Free Trade Agreement]]\n*[[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA)\n\n==Political issues==\n=== Relations with the U.S. ===\n{{Main|Canada\u2013United States trade relations}}\nCanada and the United States share a common trading relationship.

In general, the British heavily relied on American colonial militia units, while the French heavily relied on their First Nation allies. The Iroquois Nation were important allies of the British.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thomas Morgan |first1=William |year=1926 |title=The Five Nations and Queen Anne |journal=Mississippi Valley Historical Review |volume=13 |issue=2|pages=169\u2013189 |doi=10.2307/1891955 |jstor=1891955}}</ref> Much of the fighting involved ambushes and small-scale warfare in the villages along the border between New England and Quebec. The New England colonies had a much larger population than Quebec, so major invasions came from south to north. The First Nation allies, only loosely controlled by the French, repeatedly raided New England villages to kidnap women and children, and torture and kill the men.<ref>June Namias, ''White Captives: Gender and Ethnicity on the American Frontier'' (1993)</ref> Those who survived were brought up as Francophone Catholics. The tension along the border was exacerbated by religion, the French Catholics and English Protestants had a deep mutual distrust.<ref>Howard H.

The major wars were (to use American names), [[King William's War]] (1689\u20131697); [[Queen Anne's War]] (1702\u20131713); [[King George's War]] (1744\u20131748), and the [[French and Indian War]] (1755\u20131763). In Canada, as in Europe, this era is known as the Seven Years' War.\n\nNew England soldiers and sailors were critical to the successful British campaign to capture the French fortress of Louisbourg in 1745,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shortt |first1=S.

From 1790 to 1812 many farmers moved from New York and New England into Ontario (mostly to Niagara, and the north shore of Lake Ontario). In the mid and late 19th century gold rushes attracted American prospectors, mostly to British Columbia after the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]], [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]], and later to the Yukon. In the early 20th century, the opening of land blocks in the Prairie Provinces attracted many farmers from the American Midwest. Many Mennonites immigrated from Pennsylvania and formed their own colonies. In the 1890s some Mormons went north to form communities in Alberta after [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] rejected plural marriage.<ref>Marcus Lee Hansen, ''The Mingling of the Canadian and American Peoples.

When [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|Canada was invaded]], thousands joined the American cause and formed regiments that fought during the war; however most remained neutral and some joined the British effort. Britain advised the French Canadians that the British Empire already enshrined their rights in the [[Quebec Act]], which the American colonies had viewed as one of the [[Intolerable Acts]]. The American invasion was a fiasco and Britain tightened its grip on its northern possessions; in 1777, a major British invasion into New York led to the surrender of the entire British army at Saratoga, and led France to enter the war as an ally of the U.S. The French Canadians largely ignored France's appeals for solidarity.<ref>Mason Wade, ''The French Canadians, 1760\u20131945'' (1955) p. 74.</ref> After the war Canada became a refuge for about 75,000 [[United Empire Loyalist|Loyalists]] who either wanted to leave the U.S., or were compelled by Patriot reprisals to do so.<ref>Thomas B. Allen, ''Tories: Fighting for the King in America's First Civil War'' (2010) p xviii</ref>\n\nAmong the original Loyalists there were 3,500 free African Americans. Most went to Nova Scotia and in 1792, 1200 migrated to [[Sierra Leone]]. About 2000 black slaves were brought in by Loyalist owners; they remained slaves in Canada until the Empire abolished slavery in 1833. Before 1860, about 30,000\u201340,000 black people entered Canada; many were already free and others were escaped slaves who came through the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>Patrick Bode, \"Upper Canada, 1793: Simcoe and the Slaves,\" ''Beaver'' 1993 73(3): 17\u201319; Paul Robert Magocsi, ed.

Britain refused to do so, citing failure of the United States to provide financial restitution for Loyalists who had lost property in the war. The [[Jay Treaty]] in 1795 with Great Britain resolved that lingering issue and the British departed the forts. [[Thomas Jefferson]] saw the nearby British imperial presence as a threat to the [[United States]], and so he opposed the [[Jay Treaty]], and it became one of the major political issues in the United States at the time.<ref>Bradford Perkins, ''The First Rapprochement: England and the United States, 1795\u20131805'' (1955)</ref> Thousands of Americans immigrated to Upper Canada (Ontario) from 1785 to 1812 to obtain cheaper land and better tax rates prevalent in that province; despite expectations that they would be loyal to the U.S. if a war broke out, in the event they were largely non-political.<ref>{{cite book|author=George A.

The Americans were angered by British harassment of U.S. ships on the high seas and seizure (\"[[Impressment]]\") of 6,000 sailors from American ships, severe restrictions against neutral American trade with France, and British support for hostile Indian tribes in Ohio and territories the U.S. had gained in 1783. American \"honor\" was an implicit issue. The Americans were outgunned by more than 10 to 1 by the [[Royal Navy]], but could call on an army much larger than the British garrison in Canada, and so a land invasion of Canada was proposed as the only feasible, and most advantegous means of attacking the British Empire.

There was some hope that settlers in western Canada\u2014most of them recent immigrants from the U.S.\u2014would welcome the chance to overthrow their British rulers. However, the American invasions were defeated primarily by British regulars with support from Native Americans and [[Upper Canada]] (Ontario) militia. Aided by the powerful Royal Navy, a series of British raids on the American coast were highly successful, culminating with an [[Burning of Washington|attack on Washington]] that resulted in the British burning of the [[White House]], [[United States Capitol|Capitol]], and other public buildings. Major British invasions of New York in 1814 and Louisiana in 1814\u201315 were fiascoes, with the British retreating from New York and decisively defeated at the [[Battle of New Orleans]]. At the end of the war, Britain's American Indian allies had largely been defeated, and the Americans controlled a strip of Western Ontario centered on [[Amherstburg|Fort Malden]]. However, Britain held much of Maine, and, with the support of their remaining American Indian allies, huge areas of the Old Northwest, including [[Wisconsin]] and much of [[Michigan]] and [[Illinois]]. With the surrender of Napoleon in 1814, Britain ended naval policies that angered Americans; with the defeat of the Indian tribes the threat to American expansion was ended. The upshot was both sides had asserted their honour, Canada was not annexed, and London and Washington had nothing more to fight over. The war was ended by the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which took effect in February 1815.<ref>Mark Zuehlke, ''For Honour's Sake: The War of 1812 and the Brokering of an Uneasy Peace'' (2007) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] perspective.</ref> A series of postwar agreements further stabilized peaceful relations along the Canadian-US border.

Morton, ''The Kingdom of Canada'' (1969) ch 12</ref>\n\nIn later years, Anglophone Canadians, especially in Ontario, viewed the War of 1812 as a heroic and successful resistance against invasion and as a victory that defined them as a people. The myth that the Canadian militia had defeated the invasion almost single-handed, known logically as the \"militia myth\", became highly prevalent after the war, having been propounded by [[John Strachan]], [[Toronto|Anglican Bishop of York]]. Meanwhile, the United States celebrated victory in its \"Second War of Independence,\" and war heroes such as [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] headed to the White House.<ref>A.J.

A small interlocking elite, known as the [[Family Compact]] took full political control. Democracy, as practiced in the US, was ridiculed. The policies had the desired effect of deterring immigration from United States. [[Rebellions of 1837|Revolts in favor of democracy]] in Ontario and Quebec (\"Lower Canada\") in 1837 were suppressed; many of the leaders fled to the US.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dunning | first1 = Tom | year = 2009 | title = The Canadian Rebellions of 1837 and 1838 as a Borderland War: A Retrospective | url = | journal = Ontario History | volume = 101 | issue = 2| pages = 129\u2013141 }}</ref> The American policy was to largely ignore the rebellions,<ref>Orrin Edward Tiffany, ''The Relations of the United States to the Canadian Rebellion of 1837\u20131838'' (1905).

Seward]] negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] with Russia in 1867, he intended it as the first step in a comprehensive plan to gain control of the entire northwest Pacific Coast. Seward was a firm believer in [[Manifest Destiny]], primarily for its commercial advantages to the U.S. Seward expected [[British Columbia]] to seek annexation to the U.S. and thought Britain might accept this in exchange for the ''Alabama'' claims. Soon other elements endorsed annexation, Their plan was to annex [[British Columbia]], [[Red River Colony]] (Manitoba), and [[Nova Scotia]], in exchange for the dropping the damage claims. The idea reached a peak in the spring and summer of 1870, with American expansionists, Canadian separatists, and British anti-imperialists seemingly combining forces. The plan was dropped for multiple reasons. London continued to stall, American commercial and financial groups pressed Washington for a quick settlement of the dispute on a cash basis, growing Canadian nationalist sentiment in British Columbia called for staying inside the British Empire, Congress became preoccupied with Reconstruction, and most Americans showed little interest in territorial expansion. The \"[[Alabama Claims]]\" dispute went to international arbitration. In one of the first major cases of arbitration, the tribunal in 1872 supported the American claims and ordered Britain to pay $15.5 million. Britain paid and the episode ended in peaceful relations.<ref>Doris W.

Prior to Confederation, there was an [[Oregon boundary dispute]] in which the Americans claimed the 54th degree latitude. That issue was resolved by splitting the disputed territory; the northern half became British Columbia, and the southern half the states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]]. Strained relations with America continued, however, due to a series of small-scale armed incursions named the [[Fenian raids]] by [[Irish American|Irish-American]] Civil War veterans across the border from 1866 to 1871 in an attempt to trade Canada for Irish independence.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yossi Shain|title=Marketing the American Creed Abroad: Diasporas in the U.S. and Their Homelands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8pqj8GFCg7MC&pg=PA53|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=53|accessdate=2015-11-06}}</ref> The American government, angry at Canadian tolerance of Confederate raiders during the American Civil War, moved very slowly to disarm the [[Fenians]]. The British government, in charge of diplomatic relations, protested cautiously, as Anglo-American relations were tense. Much of the tension was relieved as the Fenians faded away and in 1872 by the settlement of the [[Alabama Claims]], when Britain paid the U.S. $15.5 million for war losses caused by warships built in Britain and sold to the Confederacy.\n\nDisputes over ocean boundaries on [[Georges Bank]] and over fishing, whaling, and sealing rights in the Pacific were settled by international arbitration, setting an important precedent.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mark Kurlansky|title=Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKv3CIH2rvoC&pg=PT117|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|page=117|accessdate=2015-11-06}}</ref>\n\n===Emigration to and from the United States of America===\n{{Further information|French American}}\nAfter 1850, the pace of industrialization and urbanization was much faster in the United States, drawing a wide range of immigrants from the North. By 1870, 1/6 of all the people born in Canada had moved to the United States, with the highest concentrations in New England, which was the destination of Francophone emigrants from Quebec and Anglophone emigrants from the Maritimes. It was common for people to move back and forth across the border, such as seasonal lumberjacks, entrepreneurs looking for larger markets, and families looking for jobs in the textile mills that paid much higher wages than in Canada.<ref>John J. Bukowczyk et al. ''Permeable Border: The Great Lakes Region as Transnational Region, 1650\u20131990'' (University of Pittsburgh Press. 2005)</ref>\n\nThe southward migration slacked off after 1890, as Canadian industry began a growth spurt. By then, the American frontier was closing, and thousands of farmers looking for fresh land moved from the United States north into the Prairie Provinces. The net result of the flows were that in 1901 there were 128,000 American-born residents in Canada (3.5% of the Canadian population) and 1.18 million Canadian-born residents in the United States (1.6% of the U.S. population).<ref>J.

The issue was unimportant until a gold rush brought tens of thousands of men to Canada's Yukon, and they had to arrive through American ports. Canada needed its port and claimed that it had a legal right to a port near the present American town of [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], Alaska. It would provide an all-Canadian route to the rich goldfields. The dispute was settled by arbitration, and the British delegate voted with the Americans\u2014to the astonishment and disgust of Canadians who suddenly realized that Britain considered its relations with the United States paramount compared to those with Canada. The arbitrartion validated the status quo, but made Canada angry at Britain.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Munro | first1 = John A. | year = 1965 | title = English-Canadianism and the Demand for Canadian Autonomy: Ontario's Response to the Alaska Boundary Decision, 1903 | url = | journal = Ontario History | volume = 57 | issue = 4| pages = 189\u2013203 }}</ref>\n\n1907 saw a minor controversy over [[USS Nashville (PG-7)|USS ''Nashville'']] sailing into the Great Lakes via Canada without Canadian permission.

Canada's assertion that the Northwest Passage represents internal (territorial) waters has been challenged by other countries, especially the U.S., which argue that these waters constitute an international strait ([[international waters]]). Canadians were alarmed when Americans drove the reinforced oil tanker {{SS|Manhattan|1962|2}} through the Northwest Passage in 1969, followed by the icebreaker [[USCGC Polar Sea (WAGB-11)|Polar Sea]] in 1985, which actually resulted in a [[1985 Polar Sea controversy|minor diplomatic incident]]. In 1970, the Canadian parliament enacted the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, which asserts Canadian regulatory control over pollution within a 100-mile zone. In response, the United States in 1970 stated, \"We cannot accept the assertion of a [[Canadians|Canadian]] claim that the Arctic waters are internal waters of Canada. ... Such acceptance would jeopardize the freedom of navigation essential for United States naval activities worldwide.\" A compromise of sorts was reached in 1988, by an agreement on \"Arctic Cooperation,\" which pledges that voyages of American icebreakers \"will be undertaken with the consent of the Government of Canada.\" However the agreement did not alter either country's basic legal position. [[Paul Cellucci]], the American ambassador to Canada, in 2005 suggested to Washington that it should recognize the straits as belonging to Canada. His advice was rejected and Harper took opposite positions. The U.S. opposes Harper's proposed plan to deploy military icebreakers in the Arctic to detect interlopers and assert Canadian sovereignty over those waters.<ref>Matthew Carnaghan, Allison Goody, [http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/researchpublications/prb0561-e.htm \"Canadian Arctic Sovereignty\"] (Library of Parliament: Political and Social Affairs Division, January 26, 2006); [https://web.archive.org/web/20061215051632/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/01/26/wilkins-harper060126.html 2006 news]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Politics/20070817/qp_cellucci_070819/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222190522/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Politics/20070817/qp_cellucci_070819/ |archivedate=2011-02-22 |title=Cellucci: Canada should control Northwest Passage |publisher=CTV.ca |date= |accessdate=February 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Common memberships===\n{{UKUSA}}\nCanada and the United States both hold membership in a number of multinational organizations such as:\n* [[Arctic Council]]\n* [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]]\n* [[Canadian Football League]]\n* [[CONCACAF]]\n* [[FIBA]]\n* [[FIFA]]\n* [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]\n* [[G7]]\n* [[Group of Ten (economic)|G-10]]\n* [[G-20 major economies]]\n* [[International Chamber of Commerce]]\n* [[International Development Association]]\n* [[International Ice Hockey Federation]]\n* [[International Monetary Fund]]\n* [[International Olympic Committee]]\n* [[Interpol]]\n* [[Major League Baseball]]\n* [[Major League Soccer]]\n* [[National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing]]\n* [[National Basketball Association]]\n* [[National Football League]]\n* [[National Hockey League]]\n* [[National Lacrosse League]]\n* [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]\n* [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]]\n* [[North American Numbering Plan]]\n* [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]\n* [[Organization of American States]]\n* [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]\n* [[Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America]]\n* [[UKUSA Community]]\n* [[United Nations]]\n* [[UNESCO]]\n* [[World Bowling]]\n* [[World Health Organization]]\n* [[World Trade Organization]]\n* [[World Bank]]\n* [[World Rugby]]\n\n==Diplomatic missions==\n\n===Canadian missions in the United States===\n{{multiple image\n | width1   = 222\n | image1   = Embassy of Canada in Washington, D.C..JPG\n | caption1 = [[Canadian Embassy, Washington, D.C.|Embassy of Canada]] in Washington, D.C.\n | width2 = 187\n | image2   = USEmbassyOttawa.JPG\n | caption2 = [[Embassy of the United States, Ottawa|Embassy of the United States]] in Ottawa\n}}\nCanada's chief diplomatic mission to the United States is the Canadian Embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]].

Although the words \"Trinity\" and \"Triune\" do not appear in the Bible, theologians beginning in the 3rd&nbsp;century developed the term and concept to facilitate comprehension of the New Testament teachings of God as being Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Since that time, Christian theologians have been careful to emphasize that Trinity does not imply that there are three gods (the antitrinitarian heresy of [[Tritheism]]), nor that each hypostasis of the Trinity is one-third of an infinite God (partialism), nor that the Son and the Holy Spirit are beings created by and subordinate to the Father ([[Arianism]]). Rather, the Trinity is defined as one God in three Persons.<ref>Moltman, Jurgen. ''The Trinity and the Kingdom: The Doctrine of God.'' Tr. from German.

Christianity regards the [[biblical canon]], the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]], as the [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] word of God. The traditional view of inspiration is that God worked through human authors so that what they produced was what God wished to communicate. The Greek word referring to inspiration in {{bibleref2|2Timothy|3:16||2 Timothy 3:16}} is ''theopneustos'', which literally means \"God-breathed\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Hermeneutics: Principles and Processes of Biblical Interpretation |edition=2nd |last=Virkler |first=Henry A. |editor-last=Ayayo |editor-first=Karelynne Gerber |year=2007 |publisher=Baker Academic |location=Grand Rapids, USA |isbn=978-0-8010-3138-0 |page=21 }}</ref>\n\nSome believe that divine inspiration makes our present Bibles [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]].

These variations are a reflection of the range of [[tradition]]s, and of the [[Ecumenical council|councils]] that have convened on the subject. Every version of the Old Testament always includes the books of the [[Tanakh]], the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The Catholic and Orthodox canons, in addition to the Tanakh, also include the [[Deuterocanonical Books]] as part of the Old Testament. These books appear in the [[Septuagint]], but are regarded by Protestants to be [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]]. However, they are considered to be important historical documents which help to inform the understanding of words, grammar and syntax used in the historical period of their conception. Some versions of the Bible include a separate Apocrypha section between the Old Testament and the New Testament.<ref>Metzger/Coogan, ''Oxford Companion to the Bible''. p. 39.</ref> The New Testament, originally written in [[Koine Greek]], contains 27 books which are agreed upon by all churches.\n\nModern scholarship has raised many issues with the Bible.

Then we all rise together and pray, and, as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, according to his ability, and the people assent, saying [[Amen]]; and there is a distribution to each, and a participation of that over which thanks have been given, and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons. And they who are well to do, and willing, give what each thinks fit; and what is collected is deposited with the president, who succours the orphans and widows and those who, through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who are in bonds and the strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of all who are in need.<ref name=\"justin\">Justin Martyr, [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-firstapology.html ''First Apology''] \u00a7LXVII</ref></blockquote>\n\nThus, as Justin described, Christians assemble for communal worship on Sunday, the day of the resurrection, though other liturgical practices often occur outside this setting. Scripture readings are drawn from the Old and New Testaments, but especially the gospel accounts. Often these are arranged on an [[annual cycle]], using a book called a [[lectionary]]. Instruction is given based on these readings, called a [[sermon]], or homily. There are a variety of congregational [[prayer]]s, including thanksgiving, confession and intercession, which occur throughout the service and take a variety of forms including recited, responsive, silent, or sung. The [[Lord's Prayer]], or Our Father, is regularly prayed.\n\n[[File:Worship-team.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A modern Protestant worship band leading a contemporary worship session]]\nSome groups depart from this traditional liturgical structure. A division is often made between \"[[High church|High]]\" [[church service]]s, characterized by greater solemnity and ritual, and \"[[Low church|Low]]\" services, but even within these two categories there is great diversity in forms of worship. [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] meet on Saturday, while others do not meet on a weekly basis. [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]] or [[Pentecostal]] congregations may spontaneously feel led by the Holy Spirit to action rather than follow a formal order of service, including spontaneous prayer. [[Society of Friends|Quakers]] sit quietly until moved by the Holy Spirit to speak.\n\nSome [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] services resemble concerts with [[Christian rock|rock and pop music]], dancing and use of multimedia. For groups which do not recognize a priesthood distinct from ordinary believers the services are generally led by a [[minister of religion|minister]], [[preacher]], or [[pastor]]. Still others may lack any formal leaders, either in principle or by local necessity. Some churches use only [[a cappella]] music, either on principle (for example, many [[Churches of Christ]] object to the use of instruments in worship) or by tradition (as in Orthodoxy).\n\nNearly all forms of [[churchmanship]] celebrate the [[Eucharist]] (Holy Communion), which consists of a consecrated meal. It is reenacted in accordance with Jesus' instruction at the Last Supper that his followers do in remembrance of him as when he gave his disciples [[Sacramental bread|bread]], saying, \"This is my body\", and gave them [[sacramental wine|wine]] saying, \"This is my blood\".<ref>Ignazio Silone, ''Bread and Wine'' (1937).</ref> Some [[Christian denominations]] practice [[closed communion]]. They offer communion to those who are already united in that denomination or sometimes individual church. Catholics restrict participation to their members who are not in a state of [[mortal sin]]. Most other churches practice [[open communion]] since they view communion as a means to unity, rather than an end, and invite all believing Christians to participate.\n\nWorship can be varied for special events like [[baptism]]s or weddings in the service or significant [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. In the [[Early Christianity|early church]], Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the worship. In many churches today, adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age-appropriate teaching. Such children's worship is often called [[Sunday school]] or [[Sabbath school]] (Sunday schools are often held before rather than during services).\n\n===Sacraments===\n{{Main|Sacrament}}\n{{See also|Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Anglican sacraments|Lutheran sacraments}}\n{{quote box|title=2nd-century description of the [[Eucharist]]\n|quote=And this food is called among us ''Eukharistia'' [the Eucharist], of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined.

Views concerning both which rites are sacramental, and what it means for an act to be a sacrament, vary among Christian denominations and traditions.<ref name=\"ODCC1435\">Cross/Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. p. 1435f.</ref>\n\nThe most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign, instituted by Christ, that conveys an inward, spiritual grace through Christ. The two most widely accepted sacraments are [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]] (or Holy Communion), however, the majority of Christians also recognize five additional sacraments: [[Confirmation (Christian sacrament)|Confirmation]] ([[Chrismation]] in the Orthodox tradition), [[Holy orders]] ([[ordination]]), [[Penance]] (or [[Confession (religion)|Confession]]), [[Anointing of the Sick]] and [[Matrimony]] (see [[Christian views on marriage]]).<ref name=\"ODCC1435\" />\n\nTaken together, these are the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Seven Sacraments]] as recognized by churches in the [[High Church]] tradition\u2014notably [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Independent Catholic Churches|Independent Catholic]], [[Old Catholic]], many [[Anglican sacraments|Anglicans]] and some [[Lutherans]]. Most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, while some Protestant groups, such as the Quakers, reject sacramental theology.<ref name=\"ODCC1435\" /> [[Christian denominations]], such as [[Baptists]], which believe these rites do not communicate grace, prefer to call Baptism and Holy Communion ''[[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinances]]'' rather than sacraments.\n\nIn addition to this, the [[Church of the East]] has two additional sacraments in place of the traditional sacraments of Matrimony and the Anointing of the Sick.

Beliefs on baptism vary among denominations. Differences occur firstly on whether the act has any spiritual significance. Some, such as the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, as well as Lutherans and Anglicans, hold to the doctrine of [[baptismal regeneration]], which affirms that baptism creates or strengthens a person's faith, and is intimately linked to salvation. Others view baptism as a purely symbolic act, an external public declaration of the inward change which has taken place in the person, but not as spiritually efficacious. Secondly, there are differences of opinion on the methodology of the act. These methods are: by [[Immersion baptism|''immersion'']]; if immersion is total, by ''submersion''; by [[affusion]] (pouring); and by [[aspersion]] (sprinkling). Those who hold the first view may also adhere to the tradition of [[infant baptism]];<ref>\"Through Baptism we are freed from sin and reborn as sons of God; we become members of Christ, are incorporated into the Church and made sharers in her mission\" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3G.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1213] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722003736/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3G.HTM |date=22 July 2016 }}); \"Holy Baptism is the sacrament by which God adopts us as his children and makes us members of Christ's Body, the Church, and inheritors of the kingdom of God\" ([http://anglicansonline.org/basics/catechism.html#Holy Book of Common Prayer, 1979, Episcopal );] \"Baptism is the sacrament of initiation and incorporation into the body of Christ\" ([http://www.backriverumc.com/userFiles/1257/by_water_and_the_spirit.pdf By Water and The Spirit \u2013 The Official United Methodist Understanding of Baptism (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313053601/http://www.backriverumc.com/userFiles/1257/by_water_and_the_spirit.pdf |date=13 March 2016 }};<br />\"As an initiatory rite into membership of the Family of God, baptismal candidates are symbolically purified or washed as their sins have been forgiven and washed away\" ([[William H.

Both orders made significant contributions to the development of the great universities of Europe. Another new order were the [[Cistercians]], whose large isolated monasteries spearheaded the settlement of former wilderness areas.

Partly from missionary zeal, but under the impetus of [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]] by the European powers, Christianity spread to the Americas, Oceania, [[East Asia]] and [[sub-Saharan Africa]].\n\nThroughout Europe, the divides caused by the Reformation led to outbreaks of [[religious violence]] and the establishment of separate state churches in Europe. [[Lutheranism]] spread into northern, central and eastern parts of present-day Germany, [[Livonia]] and Scandinavia. [[Anglicanism]] was established in England in 1534. [[Calvinism]] and its varieties (such as [[Presbyterianism]]) were introduced in [[Scotland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Hungary]], [[Switzerland]] and [[France]]. [[Arminianism]] gained followers in the Netherlands and [[Frisia]]. Ultimately, these differences led to the outbreak of [[religious war|conflicts]] in which religion played a key factor. The [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[English Civil War]] and the [[French Wars of Religion]] are prominent examples.

In all European countries, different Christian denominations found themselves in competition, to greater or lesser extents, with each other and with the state. Variables are the relative sizes of the denominations and the religious, political and ideological orientation of the state. Urs Altermatt of the [[University of Fribourg]], looking specifically at Catholicisms in Europe, identifies four models for the European nations. In traditionally Catholic-majority countries such as [[Belgium]], [[Spain]] and to some extent [[Austria]], religious and national communities are more or less identical. Cultural symbiosis and separation are found in [[Poland]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Switzerland]], all countries with competing denominations. Competition is found in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and again Switzerland, all countries with minority Catholic populations who to a greater or lesser extent did identify with the nation. Finally, separation between religion (again, specifically Catholicism) and the state is found to a great degree in France and [[Italy]], countries where the state actively opposed itself to the authority of the Catholic Church.<ref>{{cite book|last=Altermatt|first=Urs|title=Religion und Nation: Katholizismen im Europa des 19. und 20.

This conflict came to a head in the [[First Vatican Council]], and in Germany would lead directly to the [[Kulturkampf]], where liberals and Protestants under the leadership of [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] managed to severely restrict Catholic expression and organization.\n\nChristian commitment in Europe dropped as modernity and secularism came into their own in Europe,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12811197 | work=BBC News | title=Religion may become extinct in nine nations, study says | date=22 March 2011}}</ref> particularly in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Estonia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/~honkawa/9460.html |title=\u56f3\u9332\u25bd\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u56fd\u306e\u5b97\u6559 |publisher=.ttcn.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref> while religious commitments in America have been generally high in comparison to Europe.

Major computing disciplines include [[computer engineering]], [[software engineering]], [[computer science]], [[information system]]s, and [[information technology]].\n\n==Definitions==\n\nThe [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] ''Computing Curricula 2005''<ref name=curricula>{{cite web|author=The Joint Task Force for Computing Curricula 2005|url=http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf|title=Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report|format=pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021153204/http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-21|df=}}</ref> defined \"computing\" as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\"In a general way, we can define computing to mean any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating computers. Thus, computing includes designing and building hardware and software systems for a wide range of purposes; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific studies using computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; creating and using communications and entertainment media; finding and gathering information relevant to any particular purpose, and so on. The list is virtually endless, and the possibilities are vast.\"</blockquote>\n\nand it defines five sub-disciplines of the ''computing'' field: [[computer science]], [[computer engineering]], [[information system]]s, [[information technology]], and [[software engineering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations |title=Curricula Recommendations |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |year=2005 |accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref>\n\nHowever, ''Computing Curricula 2005''<ref name=curricula/> also recognizes that the meaning of \"computing\" depends on the context:\n\n<blockquote>''Computing also has other meanings that are more specific, based on the context in which the term is used. For example, an information systems specialist will view computing somewhat differently from a software engineer. Regardless of the context, doing computing well can be complicated and difficult. Because society needs people to do computing well, we must think of computing not only as a profession but also as a discipline.''</blockquote>\n\nThe term \"computing\" has sometimes been narrowly defined, as in a 1989 [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] report on ''Computing as a Discipline'':<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://cs.gmu.edu/cne/pjd/GP/CompDisc.pdf |title=Computing as a Discipline |format=PDF |date=January 1989 |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |work=[[Communications of the ACM]] |author=Peter J.

The fundamental question underlying all computing is \"What can be (efficiently) automated?\"</blockquote>\n\nThe term \"computing\" is also [[synonymous]] with counting and calculating. In earlier times, it was used in reference to the action performed by [[Mechanical computer|mechanical computing machines]], and before that, to [[human computer]]s {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of computing|Timeline of computing}}\n\nThe history of computing is longer than the [[history of computing hardware]] and [[computer|modern computing technology]] and includes the history of methods intended for pen and paper or for chalk and slate, with or without the aid of tables.\n\nComputing is intimately tied to the representation of [[number]]s. But long before [[abstraction]]s like ''the number'' arose, there were mathematical concepts to serve the purposes of civilization. These concepts include [[one-to-one correspondence]] (the basis of counting), comparison to a standard (used for measurement), and the ''3-4-5'' right triangle (a device for assuring a ''right angle'').\n\nThe earliest known tool for use in computation was the [[abacus]], and it was thought to have been invented in [[Babylon]] circa 2400 BC. Its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles. Abaci, of a more modern design, are still used as calculation tools today. This was the first known calculation aid - preceding Greek methods by 2,000 years{{citation needed|reason=What Greek methods?|date=March 2018}}.\n\nThe first recorded idea of using digital electronics for computing was the 1931 paper \"The Use of Thyratrons for High Speed Automatic Counting of Physical Phenomena\" by [[C. E. Wynn-Williams]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Wynn-Williams | first = C. E. | author-link = C. E. Wynn-Williams | title = The Use of Thyratrons for High Speed Automatic Counting of Physical Phenomena | journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | volume = 132 | issue = 819 | pages = 295\u2013310 | date = July 2, 1931 | doi = 10.1098/rspa.1931.0102 |bibcode = 1931RSPSA.132..295W }}</ref> [[Claude Shannon]]'s 1938 paper \"[[A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits]]\" then introduced the idea of using electronics for [[Boolean algebra]]ic operations.\n\n== Computer ==\n{{Main|Computer|Outline of computers|Glossary of computer terms}}\n\nA computer is a [[machine]] that manipulates [[Data (computing)|data]] according to a set of [[Source code|instructions]] called a [[computer program]].  The program has an [[Execution (computing)|executable]] form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions.  The same program in its human-readable [[source code]] form, enables a [[programmer]] to study and develop a sequence of steps known as an [[algorithm]]. Because the instructions can be carried out in different types of computers, a single set of source instructions converts to machine instructions according to the [[central processing unit]] type.\n\nThe execution [[process (computing)|process]] carries out the instructions in a computer program. Instructions express the [[computation]]s performed by the computer. They trigger sequences of simple actions on the executing machine. Those actions produce effects according to the [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]] of the instructions.\n\n=== Computer software and hardware ===\n{{Main|Software|Computer hardware}}\n\nComputer software or just \"software\", is a collection of [[computer program]]s and related [[data]] that provides the instructions for telling a [[computer]] what to do and how to do it. Software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer for some purposes. In other words, software is a set of ''programs, procedures, algorithms'' and its ''documentation'' concerned with the operation of a data processing system. Program software performs the [[Function (engineering)|function]] of the [[Computer program|program]] it implements, either by directly providing [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] to the computer hardware or by serving as input to another piece of software. The [[Terminology|term]] was coined to contrast with the old term [[computer hardware|hardware]] (meaning physical devices). In contrast to hardware, software is intangible.<ref>{{cite web| title = Wordreference.com: WordNet 2.0| publisher = Princeton University, Princeton, NJ| url = http://www.wordreference.com/definition/software\n| accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}</ref> Software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense, meaning [[application software]] only.\n\n==== Application software ====\n{{Main|Application software}}\n\nApplication software, also known as an \"application\" or an \"app\", is a [[computer software]] designed to help the user to perform specific tasks. Examples include [[enterprise software]], [[accounting software]], [[office suite]]s, [[graphics software]] and [[media player (application software)|media player]]s.  Many application programs deal principally with [[Document file format|documents]].  Apps may be [[Product bundling|bundled]] with the computer and its system software, or may be published separately.  Some users are satisfied with the bundled apps and need never install one.\n\nApplication software is contrasted with [[system software]] and [[middleware]], which manage and integrate a computer's capabilities, but typically do not directly apply them in the performance of tasks that benefit the user.  The system software serves the application, which in turn serves the user.\n\nApplication software applies the power of a particular [[computing platform]] or system software to a particular purpose.  Some apps such as [[Microsoft Office]] are available in versions for several different platforms; others have narrower requirements and are thus called, for example, a [[Geographic information system|Geography]] application for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] or an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] application for [[Educational software|education]] or [[Linux gaming]].  Sometimes a new and popular application arises that only runs on one platform, increasing the desirability of that platform.  This is called a [[killer application]].\n\n====System software====\n{{Main|System software}}\n\nSystem software, or systems software, is computer software designed to operate and control the computer hardware and to provide a platform for running application software.  System software includes [[operating system]]s, [[utility software]], [[device driver]]s, [[window system]]s, and [[firmware]].  Frequently development tools such as [[compiler]]s, [[linker (computing)|linker]]s, and [[Debugging|debuggers]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Game of thrones|last=|first=|last3=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> are classified as system software.\n\n=== Computer network ===\n{{Main|Computer network}}\n\nA computer network, often simply referred to as a network, is a collection of hardware components and computers '''[[Computer network|interconnected]]''' by communication channels that allow sharing of resources and information.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atis.org/glossary/definition.aspx?id=6555 |title=Computer network definition |accessdate=2011-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121061919/http://www.atis.org/glossary/definition.aspx?id=6555 |archivedate=2012-01-21 |df= }}</ref> Where at least one process in one device is able to send/receive data to/from at least one process residing in a remote device, then the two devices are said to be in a network.\n\nNetworks may be classified according to a wide variety of characteristics such as the medium used to transport the data, [[communications protocol]] used, scale, [[Network topology|topology]], and organizational scope.\n\n[[Communications protocol]]s define the rules and data formats for exchanging information in a computer network, and provide the basis for [[computer network programming|network programming]]. Well-known communications protocols are [[Ethernet]], a hardware and [[Link Layer]] standard that is ubiquitous in [[local area network]]s, and the [[Internet Protocol Suite]], which defines a set of protocols for internetworking, i.e. for data communication between multiple networks, as well as host-to-host data transfer, and application-specific data transmission formats.\n\nComputer networking is sometimes considered a sub-discipline of [[electrical engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[computer science]], [[information technology]] or [[computer engineering]], since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of these disciplines.\n\n==== Internet ====\n\nThe Internet is a global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s that use the standard [[Internet protocol suite]] (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of [[information]] resources and services, such as the inter-linked [[hypertext]] documents of the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW) and the [[information infrastructure|infrastructure]] to support [[email]].\n\n=== Computer programming ===\n{{Main|Computer programming|Software engineering}}\n\nComputer programming in general is the process of writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code and documentation of [[computer program]]s. This source code is written in a [[programming language]], which is an [[artificial language]] often more restrictive or demanding than [[natural language]]s, but easily translated by the computer. The purpose of programming is to invoke the desired behavior (customization) from the machine. The process of writing high quality source code requires knowledge of both the application's domain  ''and'' the computer science domain.  The highest-quality software is thus developed by a team of various domain experts, each person a specialist in some area of development.  But the term ''programmer'' may apply to a range of program quality, from [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] to [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|open source contributor]] to professional. And a single programmer could do most or all of the computer programming needed to generate the [[proof of concept]] to launch a new [[Killer application|\"killer\" application]].\n\n==== Computer programmer ====\n{{Main|Programmer|Software engineer|Software developer}}\n\nA programmer, computer programmer, or coder is a person who writes [[computer software]]. The term ''computer programmer'' can refer to a specialist in one area of [[computer programming]] or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software. One who practices or professes a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst. A programmer's primary computer language ([[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Python programming language|Python]], etc.) is often prefixed to the above titles, and those who work in a web environment often prefix their titles with ''web''. The term ''programmer'' can be used to refer to a [[software developer]], [[software engineer]], [[computer scientist]], or [[software analyst]]. However, members of these [[profession]]s typically{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} possess other [[software engineering]] skills, beyond programming.\n\n=== Computer industry ===\n{{Main|Computer industry}}\n\nThe computer industry is made up of all of the businesses involved in developing [[computer software]], designing [[computer hardware]] and [[computer networking]] infrastructures, the manufacture of [[computer]] components and the provision of [[information technology]] services including [[System administrator|system administration]] and maintenance.\n\n==== Software industry ====\n{{Main|Software industry}}\n\nThe software industry includes businesses engaged in [[software development|development]], [[software maintenance|maintenance]] and [[software publisher|publication]] of [[software]]. The industry also includes software [[Service (economics)|service]]s, such as [[training]], [[software documentation|documentation]], and [[consultancy|consulting]].\n\n=={{Anchor|DISCIPLINES}}Sub-disciplines of computing==\n\n=== Computer engineering ===\n{{Main|Computer engineering}}\n\nComputer engineering is a [[academic discipline|discipline]] that integrates several fields of [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]] required to develop computer hardware and software.<ref>{{Cite book | author1 = IEEE Computer Society | authorlink = IEEE Computer Society |author2=ACM |authorlink2=Association for Computing Machinery  | title = Computer Engineering 2004: Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Engineering | url = http://www.acm.org/education/education/curric_vols/CE-Final-Report.pdf | accessdate = 2012-12-17 |date=12 December 2004 | page = iii | quote = Computer System engineering has traditionally been viewed as a combination ofboth electronic engineering (EE) and computer science (CS).|format=pdf}}</ref> Computer engineers usually have training in [[electronic engineering]] (or [[electrical engineering]]), [[software design]], and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering.

Some, such as [[computational complexity theory]], which studies fundamental properties of [[computational problem]]s, are highly abstract, while others, such as [[Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]], emphasize real-world applications. Still others focus on the challenges in implementing computations.

From the Ancient [[Greeks]] and Romans to Napoleon's [[France]] and Elizabethan [[England]], much of history is filled with stories of entertainment based on games of chance.\n\nThe first known European gambling house, not called a casino although meeting the modern definition, was the [[Ridotto]], established in [[Venice]], Italy in 1638 by the [[Great Council of Venice]] to provide controlled gambling during the carnival season. It was closed in 1774 as the city government felt it was impoverishing the local gentry.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomassen|first1=Bj\u00f8rn|title=Liminality and the Modern: Living Through the In-Between|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Sd7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=ridotto+1638+casino&source=bl&ots=ycf-bQdcM5&sig=sRJvGUBC40KsjX3kWOI19UYw7Bk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEUQ6AEwB2oVChMIr-2H6IOxxwIVC9keCh18tAti#v=onepage&q=ridotto%201638%20casino&f=false|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn American history, early gambling establishments were known as [[Western saloon|saloons]]. The creation and importance of saloons was greatly influenced by four major cities: [[New Orleans]], [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]] and [[San Francisco]]. It was in the saloons that travelers could find people to talk to, drink with, and often gamble with. During the early 20th century in America, gambling became outlawed and banned by state legislation and social reformers of the time. However, in 1931, gambling was legalized throughout the state of [[Nevada]]. America's first legalized casinos were set up in those places. In 1976 [[New Jersey]] allowed gambling in [[Atlantic City]], now America's second largest gambling city.\n\n==Gambling in casinos==\n[[File:Casino slots2.jpg|thumb|[[Slot machine]]s in Atlantic City.

Most games played have mathematically determined [[odds]] that ensure the house has at all times an overall advantage over the players. This can be expressed more precisely by the notion of [[expected value]], which is uniformly negative (from the player's perspective). This advantage is called the ''[[Casino game#House advantage|house edge]]''. In games such as [[poker]] where players play against each other, the house takes a commission called the [[Rake (poker)|rake]].

[[Security camera]]s located throughout the casino are the most basic measure.\n\nModern casino security is usually divided between a physical security force and a specialized surveillance department. The physical security force usually patrols the casino and responds to calls for assistance and reports of suspicious or definite criminal activity. A specialized surveillance department operates the casino's [[closed circuit television]] system, known in the industry as the [[Eye in the sky (camera)|eye in the sky]]. Both of these specialized casino security departments work very closely with each other to ensure the safety of both guests and the casino's assets, and have been quite successful in preventing crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamblinginfo.com/6_Casino_Management.htm|title=Casino Management and Operations|publisher=Gambling Info|accessdate=23 June 2011}}</ref> Some casinos also have catwalks in the ceiling above the casino floor, which allow surveillance personnel to look directly down, through one way glass, on the activities at the tables and slot machines.\n\nWhen it opened in 1989, [[The Mirage]] was the first casino to use cameras full-time on all table games.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Knightly |first= Arnold M. |date=February 2007 |title=Blink and you'll miss him |journal=Casino City Times|pages=1 |url=http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/casino-business-blink-and-youll-miss-him-164381 |accessdate= 2011-01-30 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to cameras and other technological measures, casinos also enforce security through rules of conduct and behavior; for example, players at card games are required to keep the cards they are holding in their hands visible at all times.\n\n==Business practices==\nOver the past few decades, casinos have developed many different marketing techniques for attracting and maintaining loyal patrons. Many casinos use a loyalty rewards program used to track players' spending habits and target their patrons more effectively, by sending mailings with free slot play and other promotions.<ref>[http://articles.boston.com/2009-08-27/news/29264771_1_slot-promotions-tribes \"Tribes to pay Conn. $25m in slot accord\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512043241/http://articles.boston.com/2009-08-27/news/29264771_1_slot-promotions-tribes |date=2012-05-12 }}, (August 27, 2009).

Part of the reason this methodology is used, despite it leading to an overstatement of crime rates is that reliable data on tourist count are often not available.<ref>Walker, Douglas M. \"Do Casinos Really Cause Crime?\" (Jan 2008).

Within Cambodia, regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded as varieties of Central Khmer. Two exceptions are the speech of the capital, Phnom Penh, and that of the Khmer Khe in Stung Treng province, both of which differ sufficiently enough from Central Khmer to be considered separate dialects of Khmer. Outside of Cambodia, three distinct dialects are spoken by ethnic Khmers native to areas that were historically part of the [[Khmer Empire]]. The [[Northern Khmer dialect]] is spoken by over a million Khmers in the southern regions of [[Isan|Northeast Thailand]] and is treated by some linguists as a separate language. Khmer Krom, or Southern Khmer, is the first language of the [[Khmer Krom|Khmer of Vietnam]] while the Khmer living in the remote [[Cardamom mountains]] speak a very conservative dialect that still displays features of the [[Middle Khmer]] language.\n\nKhmer is primarily an [[analytic language|analytic]], [[isolating language]]. There are no [[inflection]]s, [[conjugation (grammar)|conjugations]] or [[grammatical case|case]] endings. Instead, [[Grammatical particle|particles]] and auxiliary words are used to indicate [[Grammar|grammatical]] relationships. General word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]], and [[modifier (grammar)|modifiers]] follow the word they modify. [[Classifier (linguistics)|Classifiers]] appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though not always so consistently as in languages like [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. In spoken Khmer, [[topic-comment]] structure is common and the perceived social relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary, such as pronouns and honorifics, are proper.{{Contains special characters}}\n\nKhmer differs from neighboring languages such as Thai, [[Burmese language|Burmese]], Lao and Vietnamese in that it is not a [[tonal language]]. Words are [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]] on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon\u2013Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a [[minor syllable]]. The language has been written in the [[Khmer script]], an [[abugida]] descended from the [[Brahmi script]] via the southern Indian [[Pallava script]], since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write [[consonant cluster|clusters]] and a division of consonants into two series with different [[inherent vowel]]s.

This dialect is characterized by merging or complete [[elision]] of syllables, which speakers from other regions consider a \"relaxed\" pronunciation. For instance, \"Phnom Penh\" is sometimes be shortened to \"m'Penh\". Another characteristic of Phnom Penh speech is observed in words with an \"r\" either as an initial consonant or as the second member of a [[consonant cluster]] (as in the English word \"bread\"). The \"r\", [[Alveolar trill|trilled]] or [[Alveolar tap|flapped]] in other dialects, is either pronounced as a [[uvular trill]] or not pronounced at all. This alters the quality of any preceding consonant, causing a harder, more emphasized pronunciation. Another unique result is that the syllable is spoken with a low-rising or \"dipping\" [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] much like the \"h\u1ecfi\" tone in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. For example, some people pronounce {{IPA|/tr\u0259j/}} ('fish') as {{IPA|[t\u0259j]}}: the {{IPA|/r/}} is dropped and the vowel begins by dipping much lower in tone than standard speech and then rises, effectively doubling its length. Another example is the word {{IPA|/ri\u0259n/}} ('study'), which is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0280i\u0259n]}}, with the uvular \"r\" and the same intonation described above.<ref>{{cite book|title=Linguistic Diversity and National Unity: Language Ecology in Thailand |author= William Allen A.

Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the [[Khmer Empire]] from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably [[Saveros Pou]], Phillip Jenner and Heinz-J\u00fcrgen Pinnow. Following the end of the Khmer Empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[phonology]] and [[lexicon]]. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer. The language became recognizable as Modern Khmer, spoken from the 19th century till today.<ref name=\"Sak\" />\n\nThe following table shows the conventionally accepted historical stages of Khmer.<ref name=\"Sidwell2009\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Historical Stages of Khmer\n! c=01| Historical stage\n! c=02| Date\n|-\n| c=01| Pre- or [[Proto-Khmeric language|Proto-Khmer]]\n| c=02| Before 600 CE\n|-\n| c=01| Pre-Angkorian Old Khmer\n| c=02| 600\u2013800\n|-\n| c=01| Angkorian Old Khmer\n| c=02| 800 to mid-14th century\n|-\n| c=01| [[Middle Khmer]]\n| c=02| Mid-14th century to 18th century\n|-\n| c=01| Modern Khmer\n| c=02| 1800\u2013present\n|}\n\nJust as modern Khmer was emerging from the transitional period represented by Middle Khmer, Cambodia fell under the [[French protectorate of Cambodia|influence]] of [[France|French]] [[French colonial empire|colonialism]].<ref name=CBHP>{{cite book\n | last = Harris | first = Ian | title = Cambodian Buddhism: History and Practice | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | edition = | year = 2008 | location = Hawaii | pages =  | doi = | isbn = 0-8248-3298-1}}</ref>  Thailand, which had for centuries claimed suzerainty over Cambodia and controlled succession to the Cambodian throne, began losing its influence on the language.<ref name=\"Candler1\">{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=David P.|title=A history of Cambodia|date=1992|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=0813309263|edition=2, illustrated}}</ref> In 1887 Cambodia was fully integrated into [[French Indochina]], which brought in a [[French language|French]]-speaking aristocracy.

Syntactic relations are mainly determined by word order.

Colloquial Khmer is a [[zero copula]] language, instead preferring predicative adjectives (and even predicative nouns) unless using a copula for emphasis or to avoid ambiguity in more complex sentences. Basic word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO), although subjects are often [[Null-subject language|dropped]]; [[prepositions]] are used rather than postpositions.<ref>Huffman, Franklin. 1967.

The different registers, which include those used for common speech, polite speech, speaking to or about royals and speaking to or about monks, employ alternate verbs, names of body parts and pronouns. This results in what appears to foreigners as separate languages and, in fact, isolated villagers often are unsure how to speak with royals and royals raised completely within the court do not feel comfortable speaking the common register. As an example, the word for \"to eat\" used between intimates or in reference to animals is {{IPA|/si\u02d0/}}. Used in polite reference to commoners, it is {{IPA|/\u0272am/}}. When used of those of higher social status, it is {{IPA|/pisa/}} or {{IPA|/t\u0254tu\u0259l ti\u0259n/}}. For monks the word is {{IPA|/c\u02b0an/}} and for royals, {{IPA|/saoj/}}.<ref name =\"cl\" /> Another result is that the pronominal system is complex and full of honorific variations, just a few of which are shown in the table below.<ref name=KhDict />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The instructions to be executed are kept in some kind of [[Memory (computers)|computer memory]]. Nearly all CPUs follow the fetch, decode and execute steps in their operation, which are collectively known as the [[instruction cycle]].\n\nAfter the execution of an instruction, the entire process repeats, with the next instruction cycle normally fetching the next-in-sequence instruction because of the incremented value in the [[program counter]]. If a jump instruction was executed, the program counter will be modified to contain the address of the instruction that was jumped to and program execution continues normally. In more complex CPUs, multiple instructions can be fetched, decoded and executed simultaneously. This section describes what is generally referred to as the \"[[classic RISC pipeline]]\", which is quite common among the simple CPUs used in many electronic devices (often called microcontroller). It largely ignores the important role of [[CPU cache]], and therefore the access stage of the pipeline.\n\nSome instructions manipulate the program counter rather than producing result data directly; such instructions are generally called \"jumps\" and facilitate program behavior like [[Control flow#Loops|loops]], conditional program execution (through the use of a conditional jump), and existence of [[Subroutine|functions]].{{Efn|Some early computers like the Harvard Mark I did not support any kind of \"jump\" instruction, effectively limiting the complexity of the programs they could run. It is largely for this reason that these computers are often not considered to contain a proper CPU, despite their close similarity to stored-program computers.}} In some processors, some other instructions change the state of bits in a [[Status register|\"flags\" register]]. These flags can be used to influence how a program behaves, since they often indicate the outcome of various operations. For example, in such processors a \"compare\" instruction evaluates two values and sets or clears bits in the flags register to indicate which one is greater or whether they are equal; one of these flags could then be used by a later jump instruction to determine program flow.\n\n===Fetch===\nThe first step, fetch, involves retrieving an [[instruction (computing)|instruction]] (which is represented by a number or sequence of numbers) from program memory. The instruction's location (address) in program memory is determined by a program counter (PC), which stores a number that identifies the address of the next instruction to be fetched. After an instruction is fetched, the PC is incremented by the length of the instruction so that it will contain the address of the next instruction in the sequence.{{Efn|Since the program counter counts ''memory addresses'' and not ''instructions'', it is incremented by the number of memory units that the instruction word contains. In the case of simple fixed-length instruction word ISAs, this is always the same number. For example, a fixed-length 32-bit instruction word ISA that uses 8-bit memory words would always increment the PC by four (except in the case of jumps). ISAs that use variable-length instruction words increment the PC by the number of memory words corresponding to the last instruction's length.}} Often, the instruction to be fetched must be retrieved from relatively slow memory, causing the CPU to stall while waiting for the instruction to be returned. This issue is largely addressed in modern processors by caches and pipeline architectures (see below).\n\n===Decode===\nThe instruction that the CPU fetches from memory determines what the CPU will do. In the decode step, performed by the circuitry known as the ''instruction decoder'', the instruction is converted into signals that control other parts of the CPU.\n\nThe way in which the instruction is interpreted is defined by the CPU's instruction set architecture (ISA).{{Efn|Because the instruction set architecture of a CPU is fundamental to its interface and usage, it is often used as a classification of the \"type\" of CPU. For example, a \"PowerPC CPU\" uses some variant of the PowerPC ISA. A system can execute a different ISA by running an emulator.}} Often, one group of bits (that is, a \"field\") within the instruction, called the opcode, indicates which operation is to be performed, while the remaining fields usually provide supplemental information required for the operation, such as the operands. Those operands may be specified as a constant value (called an immediate value), or as the location of a value that may be a [[processor register]] or a memory address, as determined by some [[addressing mode]].\n\nIn some CPU designs the instruction decoder is implemented as a hardwired, unchangeable circuit. In others, a [[microprogram]] is used to translate instructions into sets of CPU configuration signals that are applied sequentially over multiple clock pulses. In some cases the memory that stores the microprogram is rewritable, making it possible to change the way in which the CPU decodes instructions.\n\n===Execute===\nAfter the fetch and decode steps, the execute step is performed. Depending on the CPU architecture, this may consist of a single action or a sequence of actions. During each action, various parts of the CPU are electrically connected so they can perform all or part of the desired operation and then the action is completed, typically in response to a clock pulse. Very often the results are written to an internal CPU register for quick access by subsequent instructions. In other cases results may be written to slower, but less expensive and higher capacity [[Random access memory|main memory]].\n\nFor example, if an addition instruction is to be executed, the [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU) inputs are connected to a pair of operand sources (numbers to be summed), the ALU is configured to perform an addition operation so that the sum of its operand inputs will appear at its output, and the ALU output is connected to storage (e.g., a register or memory) that will receive the sum. When the clock pulse occurs, the sum will be transferred to storage and, if the resulting sum is too large (i.e., it is larger than the ALU's output word size), an arithmetic overflow flag will be set.\n\n==Structure and implementation==\n{{see also|Processor design}}\n[[File:ABasicComputer.gif|thumb|upright=1.7|Block diagram of a basic uniprocessor-CPU computer. Black lines indicate data flow, whereas red lines indicate control flow; arrows indicate flow directions.]]\n\nHardwired into a CPU's circuitry is a set of basic operations it can perform, called an [[instruction set]]. Such operations may involve, for example, adding or subtracting two numbers, comparing two numbers, or jumping to a different part of a program. Each basic operation is represented by a particular combination of [[bit]]s, known as the machine language [[opcode]]; while executing instructions in a machine language program, the CPU decides which operation to perform by \"decoding\" the opcode. A complete machine language instruction consists of an opcode and, in many cases, additional bits that specify arguments for the operation (for example, the numbers to be summed in the case of an addition operation). Going up the complexity scale, a machine language program is a collection of machine language instructions that the CPU executes.\n\nThe actual mathematical operation for each instruction is performed by a [[combinational logic]] circuit within the CPU's processor known as the [[arithmetic logic unit]] or ALU. In general, a CPU executes an instruction by fetching it from memory, using its ALU to perform an operation, and then storing the result to memory. Beside the instructions for integer mathematics and logic operations, various other machine instructions exist, such as those for loading data from memory and storing it back, branching operations, and mathematical operations on floating-point numbers performed by the CPU's [[floating-point unit]] (FPU).<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.bottomupcs.com/csbu.pdf#page=44\n | title = Computer Science from the Bottom Up, Chapter 3.

The control unit does not execute program instructions; rather, it directs other parts of the system to do so. The control unit communicates with both the ALU and memory.\n\n===Arithmetic logic unit===\n{{main article|Arithmetic logic unit}}\n[[File:ALU block.gif|thumb|upright=1.3|Symbolic representation of an ALU and its input and output signals]]\n\nThe arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit within the processor that performs integer arithmetic and [[bitwise logic]] operations. The inputs to the ALU are the data words to be operated on (called [[operands]]), status information from previous operations, and a code from the control unit indicating which operation to perform. Depending on the instruction being executed, the operands may come from [[processor register|internal CPU registers]] or external memory, or they may be constants generated by the ALU itself.\n\nWhen all input signals have settled and propagated through the ALU circuitry, the result of the performed operation appears at the ALU's outputs. The result consists of both a data word, which may be stored in a register or memory, and status information that is typically stored in a special, internal CPU register reserved for this purpose.\n\n===Memory management unit (MMU)===\n{{main article|Memory management unit}}\n\nMost high-end microprocessors (in desktop, laptop, server computers) have a memory management unit, translating logical addresses into physical RAM addresses, providing [[memory protection]] and [[paging]] abilities, useful for [[virtual memory]]. Simpler processors, especially [[microcontroller]]s, usually don't include an MMU.\n\n===Clock rate===\n{{main article|Clock rate}}\nMost CPUs are [[synchronous circuit]]s, which means they employ a [[clock signal]] to pace their sequential operations. The clock signal is produced by an external [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator circuit]] that generates a consistent number of pulses each second in the form of a periodic [[square wave]]. The frequency of the clock pulses determines the rate at which a CPU executes instructions and, consequently, the faster the clock, the more instructions the CPU will execute each second.\n\nTo ensure proper operation of the CPU, the clock period is longer than the maximum time needed for all signals to propagate (move) through the CPU. In setting the clock period to a value well above the worst-case [[propagation delay]], it is possible to design the entire CPU and the way it moves data around the \"edges\" of the rising and falling clock signal. This has the advantage of simplifying the CPU significantly, both from a design perspective and a component-count perspective. However, it also carries the disadvantage that the entire CPU must wait on its slowest elements, even though some portions of it are much faster. This limitation has largely been compensated for by various methods of increasing CPU parallelism (see below).\n\nHowever, architectural improvements alone do not solve all of the drawbacks of globally synchronous CPUs. For example, a clock signal is subject to the delays of any other electrical signal. Higher clock rates in increasingly complex CPUs make it more difficult to keep the clock signal in phase (synchronized) throughout the entire unit. This has led many modern CPUs to require multiple identical clock signals to be provided to avoid delaying a single signal significantly enough to cause the CPU to malfunction. Another major issue, as clock rates increase dramatically, is the amount of heat that is [[CPU power dissipation|dissipated by the CPU]]. The constantly changing clock causes many components to switch regardless of whether they are being used at that time. In general, a component that is switching uses more energy than an element in a static state. Therefore, as clock rate increases, so does energy consumption, causing the CPU to require more [[heat dissipation]] in the form of [[CPU cooling]] solutions.\n\nOne method of dealing with the switching of unneeded components is called [[clock gating]], which involves turning off the clock signal to unneeded components (effectively disabling them). However, this is often regarded as difficult to implement and therefore does not see common usage outside of very low-power designs. One notable recent CPU design that uses extensive clock gating is the IBM [[PowerPC]]-based [[Xenon (processor)|Xenon]] used in the [[Xbox 360]]; that way, power requirements of the Xbox 360 are greatly reduced.<ref>{{cite web | last = Brown | first = Jeffery | title = Application-customized CPU design | publisher = IBM developerWorks | url = http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-fpfxbox/?ca=dgr-lnxw07XBoxDesign | year = 2005 | accessdate = 2005-12-17 }}</ref> Another method of addressing some of the problems with a global clock signal is the removal of the clock signal altogether. While removing the global clock signal makes the design process considerably more complex in many ways, asynchronous (or clockless) designs carry marked advantages in power consumption and [[heat dissipation]] in comparison with similar synchronous designs. While somewhat uncommon, entire [[Asynchronous circuit#Asynchronous CPU|asynchronous CPUs]] have been built without using a global clock signal. Two notable examples of this are the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] compliant [[AMULET microprocessor|AMULET]] and the [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R3000 compatible MiniMIPS.\n\nRather than totally removing the clock signal, some CPU designs allow certain portions of the device to be asynchronous, such as using asynchronous [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALUs]] in conjunction with superscalar pipelining to achieve some arithmetic performance gains. While it is not altogether clear whether totally asynchronous designs can perform at a comparable or better level than their synchronous counterparts, it is evident that they do at least excel in simpler math operations. This, combined with their excellent power consumption and heat dissipation properties, makes them very suitable for [[embedded computer]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Garside, J.

For example, some early digital computers represented numbers as familiar [[decimal]] (base 10) [[numeral system]] values, and others have employed more unusual representations such as [[Balanced ternary|ternary]] (base three). Nearly all modern CPUs represent numbers in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] form, with each digit being represented by some two-valued physical quantity such as a \"high\" or \"low\" [[volt]]age.{{Efn|The physical concept of [[voltage]] is an analog one by nature, practically having an infinite range of possible values. For the purpose of physical representation of binary numbers, two specific ranges of voltages are defined, one for logic '0' and another for logic '1'. These ranges are dictated by design considerations such as noise margins and characteristics of the devices used to create the CPU.}}\n\n[[File:Binary Forty.PNG|thumb|left|A six-bit word containing the binary encoded representation of decimal value 40. Most modern CPUs employ word sizes that are a power of two, for example 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits.]]\n\nRelated to numeric representation is the size and precision of integer numbers that a CPU can represent. In the case of a binary CPU, this is measured by the number of bits (significant digits of a binary encoded integer) that the CPU can process in one operation, which is commonly called [[Word (data type)|''word size'']], ''bit width'', ''data path width'', ''integer precision'', or ''integer size''. A CPU's integer size determines the range of integer values it can directly operate on.{{Efn|While a CPU's integer size sets a limit on integer ranges, this can (and often is) overcome using a combination of software and hardware techniques. By using additional memory, software can represent integers many magnitudes larger than the CPU can. Sometimes the CPU's [[instruction set]] will even facilitate operations on integers larger than it can natively represent by providing instructions to make large integer arithmetic relatively quick. This method of dealing with large integers is slower than utilizing a CPU with higher integer size, but is a reasonable trade-off in cases where natively supporting the full integer range needed would be cost-prohibitive. See [[Arbitrary-precision arithmetic]] for more details on purely software-supported arbitrary-sized integers.}} For example, an [[8-bit]] CPU can directly manipulate integers represented by eight bits, which have a range of 256 (2<sup>8</sup>) discrete integer values.\n\nInteger range can also affect the number of memory locations the CPU can directly address (an address is an integer value representing a specific memory location). For example, if a binary CPU uses 32 bits to represent a memory address then it can directly address 2<sup>32</sup> memory locations. To circumvent this limitation and for various other reasons, some CPUs use mechanisms (such as [[bank switching]]) that allow additional memory to be addressed.\n\nCPUs with larger word sizes require more circuitry and consequently are physically larger, cost more and consume more power (and therefore generate more heat). As a result, smaller 4- or 8-bit [[microcontroller]]s are commonly used in modern applications even though CPUs with much larger word sizes (such as 16, 32, 64, even 128-bit) are available. When higher performance is required, however, the benefits of a larger word size (larger data ranges and address spaces) may outweigh the disadvantages.  A CPU can have internal data paths shorter than the word size to reduce size and cost.  For example, even though the [[IBM System/360]] [[instruction set]] was a 32-bit instruction set, the System/360 [[IBM System/360 Model 30|Model 30]] and [[IBM System/360 Model 40|Model 40]] had 8-bit data paths in the arithmetic logical unit, so that a 32-bit add required four cycles, one for each 8 bits of the operands, and, even though the [[Motorola 68000 series]] instruction set was a 32-bit instruction set, the [[Motorola 68000]] and [[Motorola 68010]] had 16-bit data paths in the arithmetic logical unit, so that a 32-bit add required two cycles.\n\nTo gain some of the advantages afforded by both lower and higher bit lengths, many [[instruction set]]s have different bit widths for integer and floating-point data, allowing CPUs implementing that instruction set to have different bit widths for different portions of the device. For example, the IBM [[System/360]] instruction set was primarily 32 bit, but supported 64-bit [[floating point]] values to facilitate greater accuracy and range in floating point numbers.<ref name=\"amdahl1964\" /> The System/360 Model 65 had an 8-bit adder for decimal and fixed-point binary arithmetic and a 60-bit adder for floating-point arithmetic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/funcChar/A22-6884-3_360-65_funcChar.pdf|title=IBM System/360 Model 65 Functional Characteristics|date=September 1968|publisher=[[IBM]]|pages=8\u20139|id=A22-6884-3}}</ref> Many later CPU designs use similar mixed bit width, especially when the processor is meant for general-purpose usage where a reasonable balance of integer and floating point capability is required.\n\n===Parallelism===\n{{main article|Parallel computing}}\n[[File:Nopipeline.png|thumb|upright=2|Model of a subscalar CPU, in which it takes fifteen clock cycles to complete three instructions]]\n\nThe description of the basic operation of a CPU offered in the previous section describes the simplest form that a CPU can take. This type of CPU, usually referred to as ''subscalar'', operates on and executes one instruction on one or two pieces of data at a time, that is less than one [[Instructions per cycle|instruction per clock cycle]] ({{nobreak|IPC < 1}}).\n\nThis process gives rise to an inherent inefficiency in subscalar CPUs. Since only one instruction is executed at a time, the entire CPU must wait for that instruction to complete before proceeding to the next instruction. As a result, the subscalar CPU gets \"hung up\" on instructions which take more than one clock cycle to complete execution. Even adding a second [[execution unit]] (see below) does not improve performance much; rather than one pathway being hung up, now two pathways are hung up and the number of unused transistors is increased. This design, wherein the CPU's execution resources can operate on only one instruction at a time, can only possibly reach ''scalar'' performance (one instruction per clock cycle, {{nobreak|1=IPC = 1}}). However, the performance is nearly always subscalar (less than one instruction per clock cycle, {{nobreak|IPC < 1}}).\n\nAttempts to achieve scalar and better performance have resulted in a variety of design methodologies that cause the CPU to behave less linearly and more in parallel. When referring to parallelism in CPUs, two terms are generally used to classify these design techniques:\n* ''[[instruction-level parallelism]]'' (ILP), which seeks to increase the rate at which instructions are executed within a CPU (that is, to increase the use of on-die execution resources);\n* ''[[task-level parallelism]]'' (TLP), which purposes to increase the number of [[Thread (computing)|threads]] or [[Process (computing)|processes]] that a CPU can execute simultaneously.\n\nEach methodology differs both in the ways in which they are implemented, as well as the relative effectiveness they afford in increasing the CPU's performance for an application.{{Efn|Neither [[Instruction-level parallelism|ILP]] nor [[Task-level parallelism|TLP]] is inherently superior over the other; they are simply different means by which to increase CPU parallelism. As such, they both have advantages and disadvantages, which are often determined by the type of software that the processor is intended to run. High-TLP CPUs are often used in applications that lend themselves well to being split up into numerous smaller applications, so-called \"[[embarrassingly parallel]] problems\". Frequently, a computational problem that can be solved quickly with high TLP design strategies like [[symmetric multiprocessing]] takes significantly more time on high ILP devices like superscalar CPUs, and vice versa.}}\n\n====Instruction-level parallelism====\n{{main article|Instruction pipelining|Superscalar processor}}\n[[File:Fivestagespipeline.png|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Basic five-stage pipeline. In the best case scenario, this pipeline can sustain a completion rate of one instruction per clock cycle.]]\n\nOne of the simplest methods used to accomplish increased parallelism is to begin the first steps of instruction fetching and decoding before the prior instruction finishes executing. This is the simplest form of a technique known as [[instruction pipelining]], and is utilized in almost all modern general-purpose CPUs. Pipelining allows more than one instruction to be executed at any given time by breaking down the execution pathway into discrete stages. This separation can be compared to an assembly line, in which an instruction is made more complete at each stage until it exits the execution pipeline and is retired.\n\nPipelining does, however, introduce the possibility for a situation where the result of the previous operation is needed to complete the next operation; a condition often termed data dependency conflict. To cope with this, additional care must be taken to check for these sorts of conditions and delay a portion of the [[instruction pipeline]] if this occurs. Naturally, accomplishing this requires additional circuitry, so pipelined processors are more complex than subscalar ones (though not very significantly so). A pipelined processor can become very nearly scalar, inhibited only by pipeline stalls (an instruction spending more than one clock cycle in a stage).\n\n[[File:Superscalarpipeline.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A simple superscalar pipeline. By fetching and dispatching two instructions at a time, a maximum of two instructions per clock cycle can be completed.]]\n\nFurther improvement upon the idea of instruction pipelining led to the development of a method that decreases the idle time of CPU components even further. Designs that are said to be ''superscalar'' include a long instruction pipeline and multiple identical [[execution unit]]s, such as [[load-store unit]]s, [[arithmetic-logic unit]]s, [[floating-point unit]]s and [[address generation unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web | last = Huynh | first = Jack | title = The AMD Athlon XP Processor with 512KB L2 Cache | publisher = University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign | pages = 6\u201311 | url = http://courses.ece.uiuc.edu/ece512/Papers/Athlon.pdf | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2007-10-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071128061217/http://courses.ece.uiuc.edu/ece512/Papers/Athlon.pdf | archivedate = 2007-11-28 | df =  }}</ref> In a superscalar pipeline, multiple instructions are read and passed to a dispatcher, which decides whether or not the instructions can be executed in parallel (simultaneously). If so they are dispatched to available execution units, resulting in the ability for several instructions to be executed simultaneously. In general, the more instructions a superscalar CPU is able to dispatch simultaneously to waiting execution units, the more instructions will be completed in a given cycle.\n\nMost of the difficulty in the design of a superscalar CPU architecture lies in creating an effective dispatcher. The dispatcher needs to be able to quickly and correctly determine whether instructions can be executed in parallel, as well as dispatch them in such a way as to keep as many execution units busy as possible. This requires that the instruction pipeline is filled as often as possible and gives rise to the need in superscalar architectures for significant amounts of [[CPU cache]]. It also makes [[Hazard (computer architecture)|hazard]]-avoiding techniques like [[branch prediction]], [[speculative execution]], [[register renaming]], [[out-of-order execution]] and [[transactional memory]] crucial to maintaining high levels of performance. By attempting to predict which branch (or path) a conditional instruction will take, the CPU can minimize the number of times that the entire pipeline must wait until a conditional instruction is completed. Speculative execution often provides modest performance increases by executing portions of code that may not be needed after a conditional operation completes. Out-of-order execution somewhat rearranges the order in which instructions are executed to reduce delays due to data dependencies. Also in case of [[SIMD|single instruction stream, multiple data stream]]\u2014a case when a lot of data from the same type has to be processed\u2014, modern processors can disable parts of the pipeline so that when a single instruction is executed many times, the CPU skips the fetch and decode phases and thus greatly increases performance on certain occasions, especially in highly monotonous program engines such as video creation software and photo processing.\n\nIn the case where a portion of the CPU is superscalar and part is not, the part which is not suffers a performance penalty due to scheduling stalls. The Intel [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] had two superscalar ALUs which could accept one instruction per clock cycle each, but its FPU could not accept one instruction per clock cycle. Thus the P5 was integer superscalar but not floating point superscalar. Intel's successor to the P5 architecture, [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]], added superscalar capabilities to its floating point features, and therefore afforded a significant increase in floating point instruction performance.\n\nBoth simple pipelining and superscalar design increase a CPU's ILP by allowing a single processor to complete execution of instructions at rates surpassing one instruction per clock cycle.{{Efn|Best-case scenario (or peak) IPC rates in very superscalar architectures are difficult to maintain since it is impossible to keep the instruction pipeline filled all the time. Therefore, in highly superscalar CPUs, average sustained IPC is often discussed rather than peak IPC.}} Most modern CPU designs are at least somewhat superscalar, and nearly all general purpose CPUs designed in the last decade are superscalar. In later years some of the emphasis in designing high-ILP computers has been moved out of the CPU's hardware and into its software interface, or [[Instruction set|ISA]]. The strategy of the [[very long instruction word]] (VLIW) causes some ILP to become implied directly by the software, reducing the amount of work the CPU must perform to boost ILP and thereby reducing the design's complexity.\n\n====Task-level parallelism====\n{{main article|Multithreading (computer architecture)|l1=Multithreading|Multi-core processor}}\nAnother strategy of achieving performance is to execute multiple [[Thread (computing)|threads]] or [[Process (computing)|processes]] in parallel. This area of research is known as [[parallel computing]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gottlieb|first=Allan|title=Highly parallel computing|year=1989|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings|location=Redwood City, Calif.|isbn=0-8053-0177-1|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=160438|author2=Almasi, George S.}}</ref> In [[Flynn's taxonomy]], this strategy is known as [[MIMD|multiple instruction stream, multiple data stream]] (MIMD).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=M.

In this scheme, each CPU has additional hardware to maintain a constantly up-to-date view of memory. By avoiding stale views of memory, the CPUs can cooperate on the same program and programs can migrate from one CPU to another. To increase the number of cooperating CPUs beyond a handful, schemes such as [[non-uniform memory access]] (NUMA) and [[directory-based coherence protocols]] were introduced in the 1990s. SMP systems are limited to a small number of CPUs while NUMA systems have been built with thousands of processors. Initially, multiprocessing was built using multiple discrete CPUs and boards to implement the interconnect between the processors. When the processors and their interconnect are all implemented on a single chip, the technology is known as chip-level multiprocessing (CMP) and the single chip as a [[multi-core processor]].\n\nIt was later recognized that finer-grain parallelism existed with a single program. A single program might have several threads (or functions) that could be executed separately or in parallel. Some of the earliest examples of this technology implemented [[input/output]] processing such as [[direct memory access]] as a separate thread from the computation thread. A more general approach to this technology was introduced in the 1970s when systems were designed to run multiple computation threads in parallel. This technology is known as [[Multithreading (computer architecture)|multi-threading]] (MT). This approach is considered more cost-effective than multiprocessing, as only a small number of components within a CPU is replicated to support MT as opposed to the entire CPU in the case of MP. In MT, the execution units and the memory system including the caches are shared among multiple threads. The downside of MT is that the hardware support for multithreading is more visible to software than that of MP and thus supervisor software like operating systems have to undergo larger changes to support MT. One type of MT that was implemented is known as [[temporal multithreading]], where one thread is executed until it is stalled waiting for data to return from external memory. In this scheme, the CPU would then quickly context switch to another thread which is ready to run, the switch often done in one CPU clock cycle, such as the [[UltraSPARC T1]]. Another type of MT is [[simultaneous multithreading]], where instructions from multiple threads are executed in parallel within one CPU clock cycle.\n\nFor several decades from the 1970s to early 2000s, the focus in designing high performance general purpose CPUs was largely on achieving high ILP through technologies such as pipelining, caches, superscalar execution, out-of-order execution, etc. This trend culminated in large, power-hungry CPUs such as the Intel [[Pentium 4]]. By the early 2000s, CPU designers were thwarted from achieving higher performance from ILP techniques due to the growing disparity between CPU operating frequencies and main memory operating frequencies as well as escalating CPU power dissipation owing to more esoteric ILP techniques.\n\nCPU designers then borrowed ideas from commercial computing markets such as [[transaction processing]], where the aggregate performance of multiple programs, also known as [[throughput]] computing, was more important than the performance of a single thread or process.\n\nThis reversal of emphasis is evidenced by the proliferation of dual and more core processor designs and notably, Intel's newer designs resembling its less superscalar [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]] architecture. Late designs in several processor families exhibit CMP, including the [[x86-64]] [[Opteron]] and [[Athlon 64 X2]], the [[SPARC]] [[UltraSPARC T1]], IBM [[POWER4]] and [[POWER5]], as well as several [[video game console]] CPUs like the [[Xbox 360]]'s triple-core PowerPC design, and the [[PlayStation 3]]'s 7-core [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell microprocessor]].\n\n====Data parallelism====\n{{main article|Vector processor|SIMD}}\nA less common but increasingly important paradigm of processors (and indeed, computing in general) deals with data parallelism. The processors discussed earlier are all referred to as some type of scalar device.{{Efn|Earlier the term ''scalar'' was used to compare the IPC count afforded by various ILP methods. Here the term is used in the strictly mathematical sense to contrast with vectors. See [[scalar (mathematics)]] and [[Vector (geometric)]].}} As the name implies, vector processors deal with multiple pieces of data in the context of one instruction. This contrasts with scalar processors, which deal with one piece of data for every instruction. Using [[Flynn's taxonomy]], these two schemes of dealing with data are generally referred to as [[SIMD|single instruction stream, multiple data stream]] (SIMD) and [[SISD|single instruction stream, single data stream]] (SISD), respectively. The great utility in creating processors that deal with vectors of data lies in optimizing tasks that tend to require the same operation (for example, a sum or a [[dot product]]) to be performed on a large set of data. Some classic examples of these types of tasks include [[multimedia]] applications (images, video and sound), as well as many types of [[Scientific computing|scientific]] and engineering tasks. Whereas a scalar processor must complete the entire process of fetching, decoding and executing each instruction and value in a set of data, a vector processor can perform a single operation on a comparatively large set of data with one instruction. This is only possible when the application tends to require many steps which apply one operation to a large set of data.\n\nMost early vector processors, such as the [[Cray-1]], were associated almost exclusively with scientific research and [[cryptography]] applications. However, as multimedia has largely shifted to digital media, the need for some form of SIMD in general-purpose processors has become significant. Shortly after inclusion of [[floating-point unit]]s started to become commonplace in general-purpose processors, specifications for and implementations of SIMD execution units also began to appear for general-purpose processors.{{when|date=September 2016}} Some of these early SIMD specifications - like HP's [[Multimedia Acceleration eXtensions]] (MAX) and Intel's [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]] - were integer-only. This proved to be a significant impediment for some software developers, since many of the applications that benefit from SIMD primarily deal with [[floating-point]] numbers. Progressively, developers refined and remade these early designs into some of the common modern SIMD specifications, which are usually associated with one ISA. Some notable modern examples include Intel's [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] and the PowerPC-related [[AltiVec]] (also known as VMX).{{Efn|Although SSE/SSE2/SSE3 have superseded MMX in Intel's general-purpose processors, later [[IA-32]] designs still support MMX. This is usually accomplished by providing most of the MMX functionality with the same hardware that supports the much more expansive SSE instruction sets.}}\n\n===Virtual CPUs===\n{{expand section|date=September 2016}}\n[[Cloud computing]] can involve subdividing CPU operation into '''virtual central processing units'''<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Anjum\n| first1 = Bushra\n| last2 = Perros\n| first2 = Harry G.\n| chapter = 1: Partitioning the End-to-End QoS Budget to Domains\n| title = Bandwidth Allocation for Video Under Quality of Service Constraints\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3r3eBQAAQBAJ\n| series = Focus Series\n| location =\n| publisher = John Wiley & Sons\n| publication-date = 2015\n| page = 3\n| isbn = 9781848217461\n| access-date = 2016-09-21\n| quote = [...] in cloud computing where multiple software components run in a virtual environment on the same blade, one component per virtual machine (VM).

Canoidea have more premolars and molars in an elongated skull.\n\nThe superfamily [[Feloidea]] (or suborder [[Feliformia]])\u2013 [[Felidae]] (cats), [[Prionodontidae]] (Asiatic linsangs), [[Herpestidae]] (mongooses), [[Hyaenidae]] (hyenas), [[Viverridae]] (civets), and [[Eupleridae]] (Malagasy carnivorans), as well as the extinct family [[Nimravidae]] (paleofelids) \u2013 often have spotted, rosetted or striped coats, and tend to be more brilliantly colored than their Canoidean counterparts. This is because these species tend to range in tropical habitats, although a few species do inhabit temperate and subarctic habitats. Many are arboreal or semiarboreal, and the majority are digitigrade. Diet tends to be more strictly carnivorous, especially in the family Felidae. They have fewer teeth and shorter skulls, with much more specialized carnassials meant for shearing meat. Feliformia claws are often retractile, or rarely, semiretractile. The terminal phalanx, with the claw attached, folds back in the forefoot into a sheath by the outer side of the middle phalanx of the digit, and is retained in this position when at rest by a strong elastic ligament. In the hindfoot, the terminal joint or phalanx is retracted on to the top, and not the side of the middle phalanx. Deep flexor muscles straighten the terminal phalanges, so the claws protrude from their sheaths, and the soft \"velvety\" paw becomes suddenly converted into a formidable weapon. The habitual retraction of the claws preserves their points from wear.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe superfamily [[Pinnipedia]] (walruses, seals, and sea lions), now considered to be part of Caniformia, are medium to large (to 6.5&nbsp;m) aquatic mammals. Being homeothermic (warm-blooded) marine mammals, pinnipeds need a low surface area to body mass ratio. Otherwise, they would suffer from excessive heat loss due to water's high capacity for heat conduction. The body is usually insulated with a thick layer of fat called [[blubber]] and typically covered with hair. The digits are not separate, but connected by a thick web that forms flippers for swimming; thus, the forelimbs and hindlimbs are transformed into paddles. This enables them to dive at extreme depths (600&nbsp;m for the [[Weddell seal]]). They can remain underwater for long periods of time, sometimes an hour or more, but most dives are usually short. The facial region of skull is relatively small, with [[pinnae]] very small or lacking, and the [[vibrissae]] are well developed. The molariform teeth are mostly [[homodont]] and the canines are well developed. The tail is very short or absent, the ears are small or absent as well, and the external [[genitalia]] are hidden in slits or depressions in the body.<ref name=\"ADW\"/>\n\n===Skull structure===\n[[File:Hyaena eximia head.jpg|thumb|Skull of ''[[Hyaena eximia]]'']]\nMembers of Carnivora have a characteristic skull shape with relatively large brains encased in a heavy skull. The skull has a highly developed [[zygomatic arch]] just behind the [[maxilla]] (common to all mammals and their [[cynodont]] forebears), and they have [[ossified]] external [[auditory bulla]]e. Feloidea have a two-chambered auditory bulla. In addition to allowing extra room for the passage of muscles to work the lower jaw, the zygomatic arch also allows for differentiation of separate muscle groups to be involved in biting and chewing. [[Masseter muscle|Masseters]] attach from the dentary (specifically, the masseteric fossa) to the zygomatic arch and onto the maxilla in front of the arch, providing crushing force. The [[temporalis]] attaches from the dentary (specifically, the [[coronoid process of the mandible|coronoid process]]) to the side of the braincase, providing torque about the axis of jaw articulation.\n\n[[File:Wolf cranium labelled.jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a wolf skull with key features labelled]]\n\nIn comparing the skulls of carnivores and herbivores, it can be seen that the shearing force of the temporalis is somewhat more important to carnivores, which have more room on the braincase (this is not unrelated to carnivoran intelligence) and commonly develop a [[sagittal crest]] (running from posterior to anterior on the skull), providing yet additional room for temporalis attachment. Carnivoran jaws can only move on a vertical axis, in an up-and-down motion, and cannot move from side-to-side. The jaw joint in carnivores tends to lie within the plane of tooth occlusion, an arrangement that further emphasizes shearing (as in a pair of scissors). In herbivores, the crushing force of the masseters is relatively more important than is shearing. The jaw joint is generally well above the plane of tooth occlusion, allowing extra room for masseteric attachment on the dentary and causing the rotation of the lower jaw to be translated into straight-ahead crushing force between the teeth of the upper and lower jaws.\n\n===Dentition===\n[[Dentition]] relates to the arrangement of teeth in the mouth, with the [[Dentition#Dental formula|dental notation]] for the upper-jaw teeth using the upper-case letters I to denote [[incisors]], C for [[Canine tooth|canines]], P for [[premolars]], and M for [[molars]], and the lower-case letters i, c, p and m to denote the [[Mandible|mandible teeth]]. Teeth are numbered using one side of the mouth and from the front of the mouth to the back. In [[carnivores]], the upper premolar P4 and the lower molar m1 form the [[carnassials]] that are used together in a scissor-like action to shear the muscle and tendon of prey.<ref name=wang2008/>\n\n===Physiology===\n{{category see also|Carnivora anatomy}}\nCarnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibers. The [[caecum]] is either absent or short and simple, and the colon is not [[sacculation|sacculated]] or much wider than the small intestine. Most species of Carnivora are, to some degree, omnivorous, except the Felidae and Pinnipedia, which are obligate carnivores. Most have highly developed senses, especially vision and hearing, and often a highly acute sense of smell in many species, such as in the Canoidea. They are excellent runners: some are long-distance runners, but more commonly are sprinters. Even bears and raccoons, although seemingly slow and clumsy, are capable of remarkable bursts of speed.\n\n===Diet specializations===\nCarnivorans include [[carnivores]], [[omnivores]], and even a few primarily [[herbivorous]] species, such as the [[giant panda]] and the [[binturong]]. Important teeth for carnivorans are the large, slightly recurved canines, used to dispatch prey, and the [[carnassial]] complex, used to rend meat from bone and slice it into digestible pieces. Dogs have molar teeth behind the carnassials for crushing bones, but cats have only a greatly reduced, functionless molar behind the carnassial in the upper jaw. Cats will strip bones clean but will not crush them to get the marrow inside. Omnivores, such as bears and raccoons, have developed blunt, molar-like carnassials. Carnassials are a key adaptation for terrestrial vertebrate predation; all other placental orders are primarily herbivores, insectivores, or aquatic.\n\n===Reproductive system===\n{{see also|Mammalian reproduction|Canidae#Reproduction|Pinniped#Birth and parenting}}\n[[File:Laitche-P013.jpg|thumb|A [[cat]] with a litter of four [[kitten]]s]]\nMost male carnivorans have a [[baculum]], although it is relatively short in [[felids]], and absent in [[hyenas]].<ref>Dixson, A.

Litter sizes are usually small, ranging from one to 13 young, which are born with underdeveloped eyes and ears. In most species, the mother has exclusive or at least primary care of the offspring.

Older classification schemes divided the order into two suborders: [[Fissipedia]] (which included the families of primarily land Carnivora) and [[Pinnipedia]] (which included the [[true seal]]s, [[eared seal]]s, and [[walrus]]). However, it is now recognized that the Fissipedia is a paraphyletic group and that the pinnipeds were not the sister group to the fissipeds but rather had arisen from among them.\n\nCarnivora are generally divided into the suborders Feliformia (cat-like) and Caniformia (dog-like), the latter of which includes the [[pinniped]]s. The pinnipeds are part of a clade, known as the [[Arctoidea]], which also includes the [[Ursidae]] (bears) and the superfamily [[Musteloid]]ea. The Musteloidea in turn consists of the [[Mustelidae]] (mustelids: weasels), [[Procyonidae]] (procyonids: raccoons), [[Mephitidae]] (skunks) and ''[[Ailurus]]'' (red panda). The oldest caniforms are the ''[[Miacis]]'' species ''Miacis cognitus'', the [[Amphicyonidae]] (bear-dogs) such as ''[[Daphoenus]]'', and ''[[Hesperocyon]]'' (of the family Canidae, subfamily Hesperocyoninae). Hesperocyonine [[canid]]s first appeared in North America, and the earliest species is currently dated at 39.74 mya, but they were not represented in Europe until well into the [[Miocene]], and not into Asia and Africa until the [[Pliocene]]. ''Miacis'' and Amphicyonidae were the first of the caniforms to split from the others and are sometimes considered to be sister groups to Ursidae, but the exact closeness of Amphicyonidae and Ursidae, as well as Arctoidae to Ursidae, is still uncertain. The [[Canidae]] ([[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[coyote]]s, [[jackal]]s, [[fox]]es and [[dog]]s) are generally considered to be the sister group to Arctoidea.<ref name=Kemp2005/><ref name=\"Wesley-Hunt2005a\"/><ref name=\"Wesley-Hunt2005b\">{{cite journal|author1=Wesley-Hunt, Gina D.|author2=Lars Werdelin|year=2005|title=Basicranial morphology and phylogenetic position of the upper Eocene carnivoramorphan ''Quercygale''|journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica|volume=50|issue=4|pages=837\u2013846|url=http://www.app.pan.pl/acta50/app50-837.pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203022/http://www.app.pan.pl/acta50/app50-837.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref><!-- The updated source of this phylogenic analysis is personal email correspondence with Dr. Gina D.

The [[Nimravidae]] are sometimes seen as the most basal of all feliforms and the first to split from the others, but there is a possibility that Nimravidae might not even belong within the order,<ref name=\"Wesley-Hunt2005b\" /> and therefore its position as a clade within Carnivora is currently unstable. Other studies indicate that the [[Barbourofelidae|barbourofelids]] form a separate family, which is closely related to the true felids instead of being related to the nimravids. Recognizable nimravid fossils date from the late Eocene (37 mya), from the Chadronian White River Carnivora Formation at Flagstaff Rim, Wyoming. Nimravid diversity appears to have peaked about 28 mya. The [[hypercarnivore|hypercarnivorous]] (strictly meat-eating) nimravid feliforms were extinct in North America after 26 mya and felids did not arrive in North America until the early middle Miocene (16 mya).\n\nIt has been suggested that canids evolved hypercarnivorous morphologies because feliforms were absent during this period (the \"[[cat-gap]]\", 26-18.5 mya), however recent data do not support this hypothesis. Hypercarnivore feliforms (felids and nimravids) occupied an area that canids did not and where felids, nimravids, and hypercarnivorous creodonts are found. Hypercarnivorous canids were present before the disappearance of the nimravids, and all became extinct before the appearance of felids. Following the extinction of nimravids, only three taxa originated, two of which were relatively small in body size. Disparity increased during the \"cat-gap\" even with the extinction of the hypercarnivorous extremes. This was due to the extinction of morphological intermediates, and because carnivorans began to occupy hypocarnivorous (nonmeat-specialist) morphospace for the first time in North America. Procyonids did not arrive in North America until the early Miocene, and \"modern\" ursids (e.g., [[Ursinae]]), did not arrive until the late Miocene. Extinct lineages of Ursidae were present in North America from the late Eocene through the Miocene and amphicyonids (bear-dogs) were present during this period as well, but occupied a morphospace generally shared with canids and not in close proximity to ursids. A large question remains as to why there was a progressive decline in hypercarnivorous carnivoramorphans during the late Oligocene/early Miocene. During this period all hypercarnivorous forms disappeared from the fossil record, including hypercarnivorous feliforms, canids, and mustelids. One possible explanation is climate change. Earth was gradually cooling after the late Paleocene, and over a period spanning the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, a dramatic climatic cooling event occurred.<ref name=\"Wesley-Hunt2005c\">{{cite journal|author=Wesley-Hunt, Gina D.|year=2005|title=The Morphological Diversification of Carnivores in North America|doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2005)031<0035:TMDOCI>2.0.CO;2|journal=Paleobiology|volume=31|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4067/is_200501/ai_n9468217/|pages=35\u201355|issn=0094-8373}}{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\nA recent study has finally resolved the exact position of ''Ailurus'': the red panda is neither a procyonid nor an ursid, but forms a monotypic family, with the other musteloids as its closest living relatives.

Basic education (''Educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica'') is compulsory by law.<ref>Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title II \u2013 Concerning rights, guarantees, and duties \u2013 Chapter 2 \u2013 Concerning social, economic and cultural rights \u2013 Article 67)</ref> It has two stages: Primary basic education (''Educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica primaria'') which goes from first to fifth grade \u2013 children from six to ten years old, and Secondary basic education (''Educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica secundaria''), which goes from sixth to ninth grade. Basic education is followed by Middle vocational education (''Educaci\u00f3n media vocacional'') that comprises the tenth and eleventh grades. It may have different vocational training modalities or specialties (academic, technical, business, and so on.) according to the curriculum adopted by each school.<ref name=\"sistema educativo\"/>\n\nAfter the successful completion of all the basic and middle education years, a [[high-school diploma]] is awarded. The high-school graduate is known as a  ''bachiller'', because secondary basic school and middle education are traditionally considered together as a unit called ''bachillerato'' (sixth to eleventh grade). Students in their final year of middle education take the [[ICFES Examination|ICFES test]] (now renamed Saber 11) in order to gain access to higher education (''Educaci\u00f3n superior''). This higher education includes undergraduate professional studies, technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies. Technical professional institutions of Higher Education are also opened to students holder of a qualification in Arts and Business. This qualification is usually awarded by the [[National Service of Learning (Colombia)|SENA]] after a two years [[curriculum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=COL|title=UNESCO-UNEVOC World TVET Database|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''Bachilleres'' (high-school graduates) may enter into a professional undergraduate career program offered by a university; these programs last up to five years (or less for technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies), even as much to six to seven years for some careers, such as medicine. In Colombia, there is not an institution such as college; students go directly into a career program at a university or any other educational institution to obtain a professional, technical or technological title. Once graduated from the university, people are granted a (professional, technical or technological) diploma and licensed (if required) to practice the career they have chosen.

The picture was Welles's [[List of directorial debuts|first feature film]]. Nominated for [[14th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] in nine categories, it won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]] by [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] and Welles. Considered by many critics, filmmakers, and fans to be the [[List of films considered the best|greatest film of all time]], ''Citizen Kane'' was voted as such in five consecutive [[British Film Institute]] ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' polls of critics, and it topped the [[American Film Institute]]'s  [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years&nbsp;... 100 Movies]] list in 1998, as well as its [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|2007 update]]. ''Citizen Kane'' is particularly praised for its cinematography, music, editing and narrative structure, which have been considered innovative and precedent-setting.\n\nThe [[film \u00e0 clef|quasi-biographical film]] examines the life and legacy of [[Charles Foster Kane]], played by Welles, a character based in part upon the American newspaper magnates [[William Randolph Hearst]] and [[Joseph Pulitzer]], Chicago tycoons [[Samuel Insull]] and [[Harold Fowler McCormick|Harold McCormick]], and aspects of the screenwriters' own lives. Upon its release, Hearst prohibited mention of the film in any of his newspapers. Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power. Narrated principally through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], the story is told through the research of a [[newsreel]] reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word: \"Rosebud\".\n\nAfter the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] successes of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]] and the controversial 1938 radio broadcast \"[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]\" on ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'', Welles was courted by Hollywood. He signed a contract with [[RKO Pictures]] in 1939. Unusually for an untried director, he was given the freedom to develop his own story, to use his own cast and crew, and to have [[final cut privilege]]. Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground, he wrote the [[Screenplay for Citizen Kane|screenplay for ''Citizen Kane'']], collaborating on the effort with Herman Mankiewicz. Principal photography took place in 1940 and the film received its American release in 1941.\n\nWhile a critical success, ''Citizen Kane'' failed to recoup its costs at the box office. The film faded from view after its release, but was subsequently returned to the public's attention when it was praised by such French critics as [[Andr\u00e9 Bazin]] and given an American revival in 1956. The film was released on [[Blu-ray]] on September 13, 2011, for a special 70th anniversary edition.\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Plot==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Citizen-Kane-Welles-Podium.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Favored to win election as governor, Kane makes a campaign speech at [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]]\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Citizen-Kane-Comingore-Welles-Collins.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = The affair between Kane and Susan Alexander ([[Dorothy Comingore]]) is exposed by his political opponent, Boss Jim W. Gettys ([[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]])\n}}\nIn a mansion in [[Xanadu (Citizen Kane)|Xanadu]], a vast palatial estate in [[Florida]], the elderly [[Charles Foster Kane]] is on his deathbed. Holding a [[snow globe]], he utters a word, \"Rosebud\", and dies; the globe slips from his hand and smashes on the floor. A [[newsreel]] obituary tells the life story of Kane, an enormously wealthy newspaper publisher. Kane's death becomes sensational news around the world, and the newsreel's producer tasks reporter Jerry Thompson with discovering the meaning of \"Rosebud\".\n\nThompson sets out to interview Kane's friends and associates. He tries to approach Susan Alexander Kane, now an [[alcoholic]] who runs her own nightclub, but she refuses to talk to him. Thompson goes to the private archive of the late banker Walter Parks Thatcher. Through Thatcher's written memoirs, Thompson learns that Kane's childhood began in poverty in Colorado.\n\nIn 1871, after a gold mine is discovered on her property, Kane's mother Mary Kane sends Charles away to live with Thatcher so that he would be properly educated. It is also implied that Kane's father could be violent towards his son and that is another reason she wants to send him away. While Thatcher and Charles' parents discuss arrangements inside, the young Kane plays happily with a sled in the snow outside his parents' boarding-house and protests being sent to live with Thatcher. Furious at the prospect of exile from his own family to live with a man he does not know, the boy strikes Thatcher with his sled and attempts to run away.\n\nYears later, after gaining full control over his trust fund at the age of 25, Kane enters the newspaper business and embarks on a career of [[yellow journalism]]. He takes control of the ''New York Inquirer'' and starts publishing scandalous articles that attack Thatcher's business interests. After the stock market crash in 1929, Kane is forced to sell controlling interest of his newspaper empire to Thatcher.\n\nBack in the present, Thompson interviews Kane's personal business manager, Mr. Bernstein. Bernstein recalls how Kane hired the best journalists available to build the ''Inquirer''{{'}}s circulation. Kane rose to power by successfully manipulating public opinion regarding the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and marrying Emily Norton, the niece of a President of the United States.\n\nThompson interviews Kane's estranged best friend, Jedediah Leland, in a [[retirement home]]. Leland recalls how Kane's marriage to Emily disintegrates more and more over the years, and he begins an affair with amateur singer Susan Alexander while he is running for [[Governor of New York]]. Both his wife and his political opponent discover the affair and the [[Political scandal|public scandal]] ends his political career. Kane marries Susan and forces her into a humiliating [[opera]]tic career for which she has neither the talent nor the ambition.\n\nBack in the present, Susan now consents to an interview with Thompson and recalls her failed opera career. Kane finally allows her to abandon her singing career after she attempts suicide. After years spent dominated by Kane and living in isolation at Xanadu, Susan leaves Kane. Kane's butler Raymond recounts that, after Susan leaves him, Kane begins violently destroying the contents of her bedroom. He suddenly calms down when he sees a snow globe and says, \"Rosebud\".\n\nBack at Xanadu, Kane's belongings are being cataloged or discarded. Thompson concludes that he is unable to solve the mystery and that the meaning of Kane's last word will forever remain an enigma. As the film ends, the camera reveals that \"Rosebud\" is the trade name of the [[sled]] on which the eight-year-old Kane was playing on the day that he was taken from his home in Colorado. Thought to be junk by Xanadu's staff, the sled is burned in a furnace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Citizen-Kane-Moorehead.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = [[Harry Shannon (actor)|Harry Shannon]], [[George Coulouris]] and [[Agnes Moorehead]]\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Citizen-Kane-Inquirer-Window.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Orson Welles]] and [[Everett Sloane]]\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =Citizen-Kane-Comingore-Welles.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = Dorothy Comingore and Orson Welles\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image4    =Citizen-Kane-Collins-Welles.jpg\n| alt4      =\n| caption4  = Ray Collins, Dorothy Comingore, Orson Welles and [[Ruth Warrick]]\n}}\nThe beginning of the film's ending credits state that \"Most of the principal actors in ''Citizen Kane'' are new to motion pictures.

Through its use, it is possible to photograph action from a range of eighteen inches from the camera lens to over two hundred feet away, with extreme foreground and background figures and action both recorded in sharp relief. Hitherto, the camera had to be focused either for a close or a distant shot, all efforts to encompass both at the same time resulting in one or the other being out of focus. This handicap necessitated the breaking up of a scene into long and short angles, with much consequent loss of realism.

An early example is the invention of [[language]], which enabled a person, through [[speech]], to communicate what he or she saw, heard, felt, or thought to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry, and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered. The invention of [[writing]], which converted spoken language into [[visual system|visual]] [[symbol]]s, extended the range of communication across [[space]] and [[time]].\n\nThe process of '''encoding''' converts information from a [[communication source|source]] into symbols for communication or storage. '''Decoding''' is the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understand, such as English or Spanish.\n\nOne reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary [[plain language]], spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration of [[Flag semaphore|flags]] held by a signaler or the arms of a [[semaphore line|semaphore tower]] encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters and numbers. Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.\n\n== Theory ==\n\n{{main article|Coding theory}}\nIn [[information theory]] and [[computer science]], a code is usually considered as an [[algorithm]] that uniquely represents [[symbols]] from some source [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]], by ''encoded'' strings, which may be in some other target alphabet. An extension of the code for representing sequences of symbols over the source alphabet is obtained by concatenating the encoded strings.\n\nBefore giving a mathematically precise definition, this is a brief example. The mapping\n:<math>C = \\{\\, a\\mapsto 0, b\\mapsto 01, c\\mapsto 011\\,\\}</math>\nis a code, whose source alphabet is the set <math>\\{a,b,c\\}</math> and whose target alphabet is the set <math>\\{0,1\\}</math>. Using the extension of the code, the encoded string 0011001011 can be grouped into codewords as 0\u2002011\u20020\u200201\u2002011, and these in turn can be decoded to the sequence of source symbols ''acabc''.\n\nUsing terms from [[formal language theory]], the precise mathematical definition of this concept is as follows: let S and T be two finite sets, called the source and target [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabets]], respectively. A '''code''' <math>C:\\, S \\to T^*</math> is a [[total function]] mapping each symbol from S to a [[String (computer science)|sequence of symbols]] over T, and the extension of <math>C</math> to a [[Homomorphism#Homomorphisms and e-free homomorphisms in formal language theory|homomorphism]] of <math>S^*</math> into <math>T^*</math>, which naturally maps each sequence of source symbols to a sequence of target symbols, is referred to as its '''extension'''.\n\n=== Variable-length codes ===\n{{Main article|Variable-length code}}\nCodes that encode each source (clear text) character by a [[code word]] from some dictionary, and [[concatenation]] of such code words give us an encoded string. Variable-length codes are especially useful when clear text characters have different probabilities; see also [[entropy encoding]].\n\nA ''prefix code'' is a code with the \"prefix property\": there is no valid code word in the system that is a [[prefix (computer science)|prefix]] (start) of any other valid code word in the set. [[Huffman coding]] is the most known algorithm for deriving prefix codes. Prefix codes are widely referred to as \"Huffman codes\" even when the code was not produced by a Huffman algorithm. Other examples of prefix codes are [[country calling codes]], the country and publisher parts of [[ISBN]]s, and the Secondary Synchronization Codes used in the [[UMTS]] [[W-CDMA|WCDMA]] 3G Wireless Standard.\n\n[[Kraft's inequality]] characterizes the sets of codeword lengths that are possible in a prefix code. Virtually any uniquely decodable one-to-many code, not necessary a prefix one, must satisfy Kraft's inequality.\n\n=== Error-correcting codes ===\n{{Main article|Error detection and correction}}\n{{see also|Block code}}\nCodes may also be used to represent data in a way more resistant to errors in transmission or storage. This so-called [[Error detection and correction|error-correcting code]] works by including carefully crafted redundancy with the stored (or transmitted) data. Examples include [[Hamming code]]s, [[Reed\u2013Solomon]], [[Reed\u2013Muller code|Reed\u2013Muller]], [[Walsh\u2013Hadamard code|Walsh\u2013Hadamard]], [[BCH code|Bose\u2013Chaudhuri\u2013Hochquenghem]], [[Turbo code|Turbo]], [[Binary Golay code|Golay]], [[Goppa code|Goppa]], [[low-density parity-check code]]s, and [[space\u2013time code]]s.\nError detecting codes can be optimised to detect ''burst errors'', or ''random errors''.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Codes in communication used for brevity ===\nA cable code replaces words (e.g. ''ship'' or ''invoice'') with shorter words, allowing the same information to be sent with fewer [[character (computing)|characters]], more quickly, and less expensively.\n\nCodes can be used for brevity. When [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] messages were the state of the art in rapid long distance communication, elaborate systems of [[commercial code (communications)|commercial codes]] that encoded complete phrases into single mouths (commonly five-minute groups) were developed, so that telegraphers became conversant with such \"words\" as ''BYOXO'' (\"Are you trying to weasel out of our deal?\"), ''LIOUY'' (\"Why do you not answer my question?\"), ''BMULD'' (\"You're a skunk!\"), or ''AYYLU'' (\"Not clearly coded, repeat more clearly.\"). [[Code word]]s were chosen for various reasons: [[length]], [[pronounceability]], etc. Meanings were chosen to fit perceived needs: commercial negotiations, military terms for military codes, diplomatic terms for diplomatic codes, any and all of the preceding for espionage codes. Codebooks and codebook publishers proliferated, including one run as a front for the American [[Black Chamber]] run by [[Herbert Yardley]] between the First and Second World Wars. The purpose of most of these codes was to save on cable costs. The use of data coding for [[data compression]] predates the computer era; an early example is the telegraph [[Morse code]] where more-frequently used characters have shorter representations. Techniques such as [[Huffman coding]] are now used by computer-based [[algorithm]]s to compress large data files into a more compact form for storage or transmission.\n\n=== Character encodings ===\n{{Main article|Character encoding}}\nCharacter encodings are representations of textual data. A given character encoding may be associated with a specific character set (the collection of characters which it can represent), though some character sets have multiple character encodings and vice versa. Character encodings may be broadly grouped according to the number of bytes required to represent a single character: there are single byte encodings, [[Wide_character|multibyte]] (also called wide) encodings, and [[Variable-width_encoding|variable-width]] (also called variable-length) encodings. The earliest character encodings were single-byte, the best known example of which is [[ASCII]]. ASCII remains in use today, for example in [[HTTP headers]]. However, single-byte encodings cannot model character sets with more than 256 characters. Scripts which require large character sets such as [[CJK|Chinese, Japanese and Korean]] must be represented with multibyte encodings. Early multibyte encodings were fixed-length, meaning that although each character was represented by more than one byte, all characters used the same number of bytes (\"word length\"), making them suitable for decoding with a lookup table. The final group, variable-width encodings, is a subset of multibyte encodings. These use more complex encoding and decoding logic to efficiently represent large character sets while keeping the representations of more commonly used characters shorter or maintaining backwards compatibility properties. This group includes [[UTF-8]], an encoding of the [[Unicode]] character set; UTF-8 is the most common encoding of text media on the Internet.\n\n=== Genetic code ===\n{{Main article|Genetic code}}\n[[Biology|Biological]] organisms contain genetic material that is used to control their function and development. This is [[DNA]], which contains units named [[gene]]s from which [[messenger RNA]] is derived. This in turn produces [[protein]]s through a [[genetic code]] in which a series of triplets ([[codon]]s) of four possible [[nucleotides]] can be translated into one of twenty possible [[amino acid]]s. A sequence of codons results in a corresponding sequence of amino acids that form a protein molecule; a type of codon called a [[stop codon]] signals the end of the sequence.\n\n===G\u00f6del code===\nIn [[mathematics]], a [[G\u00f6del code]] was the basis for the proof of [[G\u00f6del]]'s [[incompleteness theorem]]. Here, the idea was to map [[mathematical notation]] to a [[natural number]] (using a [[G\u00f6del numbering]]).\n\n=== Other ===\n\nThere are codes using colors, like [[traffic lights]], the [[Electronic color code|color code]] employed to mark the nominal value of the [[Resistor|electrical resistor]]s or that of the trashcans devoted to specific types of garbage (paper, glass, organic, etc.).\n\nIn [[marketing]], [[coupon]] codes can be used for a financial discount or rebate when purchasing a product from a (usually internet) retailer.\n\nIn military environments, specific sounds with the [[cornet]] are used for different uses: to mark some moments of the day, to command the infantry on the battlefield, etc.\n\nCommunication systems for sensory impairments, such as [[sign language]] for deaf people and [[braille]] for blind people, are based on movement or tactile codes.\n\n[[Sheet music|Musical scores]] are the most common way to encode [[music]].\n\nSpecific games have their own code systems to record the matches, e.g. [[chess notation]].\n\n=== Cryptography ===\nIn the [[history of cryptography]], [[Code (cryptography)|codes]] were once common for ensuring the confidentiality of communications, although [[cipher]]s are now used instead.\n\nSecret codes intended to obscure the real messages, ranging from serious (mainly [[espionage]] in military, diplomacy, business, etc.) to trivial (romance, games) can be any kind of imaginative encoding: [[Language of flowers|flowers]], game cards, clothes, fans, hats, melodies, birds, etc., in which the sole requisite is the pre-agreement on the meaning by both the sender and the receiver.\n\n== Other examples ==\n\nOther examples of encoding include:\n*Encoding (in [[cognition]]) - a basic perceptual process of interpreting incoming stimuli; technically speaking, it is a complex, multi-stage process of converting relatively objective sensory input (e.g., light, sound) into subjectively meaningful experience.\n*A [[content format]] - a specific encoding format for converting a specific type of [[data]] to [[information]].\n*Text encoding uses a [[markup language]] to tag the structure and other features of a text to facilitate processing by computers. (See also [[Text Encoding Initiative]].)\n*[[Semantics encoding]] of formal language A in formal language B is a method of representing all terms (e.g. programs or descriptions) of language A using language B.\n*[[Encoder|Electronic encoding]] transforms a signal into a code optimized for [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] or [[data storage device|storage]], generally done with a [[codec]].\n*[[Neural encoding]] - the way in which information is represented in [[neuron]]s.\n*[[Encoding (memory)|Memory encoding]] - the process of converting sensations into memories.\n*[[Television encoding]]: [[NTSC]], [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]]\n\nOther examples of decoding include:\n* [[Parsing|Decoding (computer science)]]\n* [[Decoding methods]], methods in communication theory for decoding code words sent over a noisy channel\n* [[Digital signal processing]], the study of signals in a digital representation and the processing methods of these signals\n* [[Digital-to-analog converter]], the use of analog circuit for decoding operations\n* Word decoding, the use of [[phonics]] to decipher print patterns and translate them into the sounds of language\n\n==Codes and acronyms==\n[[Acronym]]s and abbreviations can be considered codes, and in a sense all [[language]]s and [[Writing system|writing systems]] are codes for human thought.\n\n[[International Air Transport Association airport code]]s are three-letter codes used to designate airports and used for [[bag tag]]s. [[Station code]]s are similarly used on railways, but are usually national, so the same code can be used for different stations if they are in different countries.\n\nOccasionally, a code word achieves an independent existence (and meaning) while the original equivalent phrase is forgotten or at least no longer has the precise meaning attributed to the code word.

Like all other [[lemur]]s, '''cheirogaleids''' live exclusively on the island of [[Madagascar]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nCheirogaleids are smaller than the other lemurs and, in fact, they are the smallest primates. They have soft, long fur, colored grey-brown to reddish on top, with a generally brighter underbelly. Typically, they have small ears, large, close-set eyes, and long hind legs. Like all strepsirrhines, they have fine claws at the second toe of the hind legs. They grow to a size of only 13 to 28&nbsp;cm, with a tail that is very long, sometimes up to one and a half times as long as the body. They weigh no more than 500&nbsp;grams, with some species weighing as little as 60&nbsp;grams.<ref name=EoM>{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Martin, Robert D.|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 126\u2013127|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}</ref>\n\nDwarf and mouse lemurs are [[nocturnal]] and [[arboreal]]. They are excellent climbers and can also jump far, using their long tails for balance. When on the ground (a rare occurrence), they move by hopping on their hind legs. They spend the day in tree hollows or leaf nests. Cheirogaleids are typically solitary, but sometimes live together in pairs.\n\nTheir eyes possess a [[tapetum lucidum]], a light-reflecting layer that improves their night vision. Some species, such as the [[lesser dwarf lemur]], store fat at the hind legs and the base of the tail, and hibernate. Unlike [[Lemuridae|lemurid]]s, they have long upper [[incisor]]s, although they do have the comb-like teeth typical of all strepsirhines. They have the [[dentition|dental formula]]: {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.3.3|lower=2.1.3.3}}\n\nCheirogaleids are [[omnivore]]s, eating fruits, flowers and leaves (and sometimes nectar), as well as insects, spiders, and small vertebrates.<ref name=EoM/>\n\nThe females usually have three pairs of nipples. After a meager 60-day gestation, they will bear two to four (usually two or three) young. After five to six weeks, the young are weaned and become fully mature near the end of their first year or sometime in their second year, depending on the species. In human care, they can live for up to 15 years, although their life expectancy in the wild is probably significantly shorter.\n\n==Classification==\nThe five [[genus|genera]] of cheirogaleids contain 34 [[species]].<ref name=Mittermeier2008>{{cite journal|title=Lemur Diversity in Madagascar|author=Mittermeier, R.|author-link=Russell Mittermeier|author2=Ganzhorn, J., Konstant, W., Glander, K., Tattersall, I., [[Colin Groves|Groves, C.]], Rylands, A., Hapke, A., Ratsimbazafy, J., Mayor, M., Louis, E., Rumpler, Y., Schwitzer, C. & Rasoloarison, R.|journal=International Journal of Primatology|doi=10.1007/s10764-008-9317-y|pages=1607\u20131656|volume=29|issue=6|date=December 2008}}</ref><ref name=Louis>{{cite journal | title = Revision of the Mouse Lemurs (''Microcebus'') of Eastern Madagascar | pages = 347\u2013389 |author1=Edward E.

In polyandrous groups, both (or all) the mature males regularly copulate with the female, and all contribute equally to parental care. It is now thought that this flexible system, with a tendency towards polyandry, may be the typical mating system among callitrichids; though, until field studies on more species have been completed, any generalisation must be tentative.<ref name=\"1988Goldizen\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0169-5347(88)90045-6 | last1 = Goldizen | first1 = A.W. | title = tamarin and marmoset mating systems: Unusual flexibility | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution | year = 1988 | volume = 3 | pages = 36\u201340 | issue = 2 | pmid = 21227069}}</ref>\n-->\n\nThey are the only primate group that regularly produces twins, which constitute over 80% of births in species that have been studied.

Extant members are the [[capuchin monkey]]s and [[squirrel monkey]]s.<ref name=SAP/> These species are found throughout tropical and subtropical [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nCebid monkeys are [[arboreal]] animals that only rarely travel on the ground. They are generally small monkeys, ranging in size <!--from the [[pygmy marmoset]], with a head-body length of 17 to 19 cm, and a weight of 120 to 190 grams,--> up to that of the [[brown capuchin]], with a body length of 33 to 56&nbsp;cm, and a weight of 2.5 to 3.9 kilograms. They are somewhat variable in form and coloration, but all have the wide, flat, noses typical of New World monkeys.\n\nThey are [[omnivore|omnivorous]], mostly eating fruit and insects, although the proportions of these foods vary greatly between species. They have the [[dentition|dental formula]]:{{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.3.2-3|lower=2.1.3.2-3}}\n\nFemales give birth to one or two young after a [[gestation]] period of between 130 and 170 days, depending on species. They are social animals, living in groups of between five and forty individuals, with the smaller species typically forming larger groups. They are generally [[Diurnality|diurnal]] in habit.<ref name=EoM>{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author1=Janson, C.H.  |author2=Rylands, A.B.|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 342\u2013361|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nPreviously, New World monkeys were divided between [[Callitrichidae]] and this family. For a few recent years, [[marmoset]]s, [[tamarin]]s, and [[lion tamarin]]s were placed as a subfamily (Callitrichinae) in Cebidae, while moving other genera from Cebidae into the families [[Aotidae]], [[Pitheciidae]] and [[Atelidae]].<ref name=msw3/> The most recent classification of New World monkeys again splits the callitrichids off, leaving only the capuchins and squirrel monkeys in this family.<ref name=SAP/>\n\n* '''Family Cebidae''': capuchins and squirrel monkeys[[Image:Cebus albifrons edit.jpg|thumb|right|[[White-fronted capuchin]] (''Cebus albifrons'')]]\n** Subfamily [[Cebinae]]\n*** Genus ''[[Cebus]]''\n**** [[Kaapori capuchin]], ''Cebus kaapori''\n**** [[Wedge-capped capuchin]], ''Cebus olivaceus''\n**** [[White-headed capuchin]], ''Cebus capucinus''\n**** [[White-fronted capuchin]], ''Cebus albifrons''\n*** Genus ''[[Sapajus]]''\n**** [[Black-striped capuchin]], ''Sapajus libidinosus''\n**** [[Black capuchin]], ''Sapajus nigritus''\n**** [[Blond capuchin]], ''Sapajus flavius''\n**** [[Golden-bellied capuchin]], ''Sapajus xanthosternos''\n**** [[Tufted capuchin]], ''Sapajus apella''[[Image:common.squirrel.monkey.arp.jpg|right|thumb|[[Common squirrel monkey]] (''Saimiri sciureus'')]]\n** Subfamily [[Saimiriinae]]\n*** Genus ''[[Saimiri]]''\n**** [[Bare-eared squirrel monkey]], ''Saimiri ustus''\n**** [[Black squirrel monkey]], ''Saimiri vanzolini''\n**** [[Black-capped squirrel monkey]], ''Saimiri boliviensis''\n**** [[Central American squirrel monkey]], ''Saimiri oerstedi''\n**** [[Common squirrel monkey]], ''Saimiri sciureus''\n\n==Extinct taxa==\n\n*Subfamily [[Cebinae]]\n**Genus ''[[Acrecebus]]''\n***''[[Acrecebus fraileyi]]''\n**Genus ''[[Dolichocebus]]''\n***''[[Dolichocebus gaimanensis]]''\n**Genus ''[[Chilecebus]]''\n***''[[Chilecebus carrascoensis]]''\n**Genus ''[[Neosaimiri]]''\n***''[[Neosaimiri fieldsi]]''\n**Genus ''[[Laventiana]]''\n***''[[Laventiana annectens]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Wikispecies|Cebidae}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Primates}}\n{{Cebidae nav}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q425707}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:New World monkeys]]\n[[Category:Primate families]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Charles Lucien Bonaparte]]", "sha1": "aix3ajdvoc4lubyzvxqio51hl7w2635"}}, {"title": "Cercopithecidae", "ns": "0", "id": "5231", "redirect": {"title": "Old World monkey"}, "revision": {"id": "783860642", "parentid": "722883347", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:29:10Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Old World monkey]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from scientific name}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Primate families]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray]]", "sha1": "9p7n3efw3d9jswajdcl2upt8fbqydot"}}, {"title": "Chondrichthyes", "ns": "0", "id": "5232", "revision": {"id": "866377841", "parentid": "866288050", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T00:02:30Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ericeleven", "id": "33375732"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Automatic taxobox\n | name                = Cartilaginous fishes\n | fossil_range        = {{Fossil range|422|0|ref=<ref name=\"botella et al\">{{cite journal |author1=Botella, H.A. |author2=Donoghue, P.C.J. |author3=Mart\u00ednez-P\u00e9rez, C. |year=2009 |title=Enameloid microstructure in the oldest known chondrichthyan teeth |journal=Acta Zoologica |volume=90 |pages=103\u2013108 |issue=Supplement |doi=10.1111/j.1463-6395.2008.00337.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1463-6395.2008.00337.x/abstract |accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |publisher=PalaeoDB |title=Chondrichthyes |url=http://paleodb.org/?a=checkTaxonInfo&taxon_no=34422 | accessdate          = 26 November 2013}}</ref>}} <small>Latest [[Silurian]] to Present</small>\n | image               = White shark.jpg\n | image_width         = 250px\n | image_caption       = [[Great white shark]], ''Carcharodon carcharias''\n | authority   = [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]], 1880\n | display_parents = 3\n | subdivision_ranks   = [[Class (biology)|Subclass]]es\n | subdivision         = \n[[Elasmobranchii]]<br />\n[[Holocephali]]\n}}\n\n'''Chondrichthyes''' ({{IPAc-en|k|\u0252|n|\u02c8|d|r|\u026a|k|\u03b8|i|i\u02d0|z}}; from Greek \u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1- ''chondr-'' 'cartilage', \u1f30\u03c7\u03b8\u03cd\u03c2 ''ichthys'' 'fish') is a [[class (biology)|class]] that contains the '''cartilaginous fishes''': they are jawed [[vertebrate]]s with paired fins, paired [[nare]]s, scales, a heart with its chambers in series, and skeletons made of [[cartilage]] rather than [[bone]]. The class is divided into two subclasses: [[Elasmobranchii]] ([[shark]]s, [[Batoidea|ray]]s, [[Skate (fish)|skate]]s, and [[sawfish]]) and [[Holocephali]] ([[chimaera]]s, sometimes called ghost sharks, which are sometimes separated into their own class).\n\nWithin the infraphylum [[Gnathostomata]], cartilaginous fishes are distinct from all other jawed vertebrates.\n\n==Anatomy==\n{{see also|Cartilaginous versus bony fishes}}\n\n===Skeleton===\nThe skeleton is cartilaginous. The [[notochord]] is gradually replaced by a vertebral column during development, except in [[Holocephali]], where the notochord stays intact. In some deepwater sharks, the column is reduced.<ref>[https://books.google.no/books?id=cxxSN4YA2i8C&pg=PA23&dq=Notochord:+Chimaeroids+%22Some+deepwater+squaloid,+hexanchoid,+and+lamnoid+sharks+%22&hl=no&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjK-YDWxYnbAhXhA5oKHZmtByAQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Notochord%3A%20Chimaeroids%20%22Some%20deepwater%20squaloid%2C%20hexanchoid%2C%20and%20lamnoid%20sharks%20%22&f=false Sharks of the World: An Annotated and Illustrated Catalogue of Shark Species Known to Date]</ref>\n\nAs they do not have [[bone marrow]], [[red blood cell]]s are produced in the [[spleen]] and the epigonal organ (special tissue around the [[gonad]]s, which is also thought to play a role in the immune system). They are also produced in the [[Leydig's organ]], which is only found in certain cartilaginous fishes. The subclass [[Holocephali]], which is a very specialized group, lacks both the Leydig's and epigonal organs.\n\n===Appendages===\nApart from [[electric ray]]s, which have a thick and flabby body, with soft, loose skin, chondrichthyans have tough skin covered with dermal teeth (again, Holocephali is an exception, as the teeth are lost in adults, only kept on the clasping organ seen on the caudal ventral surface of the male), also called [[placoid scale]]s (or ''dermal denticles''), making it feel like sandpaper. In most species, all dermal denticles are oriented in one direction, making the skin feel very smooth if rubbed in one direction and very rough if rubbed in the other.\n\nOriginally, the pectoral and pelvic girdles, which do not contain any dermal elements, did not connect. In later forms, each pair of fins became ventrally connected in the middle when scapulocoracoid and pubioischiadic bars evolved. In [[Batoidea|rays]], the pectoral fins have connected to the head and are very flexible.\n\nOne of the primary characteristics present in most sharks is the heterocercal tail, which aids in locomotion.<ref>{{cite journal |first=C. D. |last=Wilga |first2=G. V. |last2=Lauder |title=Function of the heterocercal tail in sharks: quantitative wake dynamics during steady horizontal swimming and vertical maneuvering |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Biology]] |volume=205 |issue=16 |pages=2365\u20132374 |year=2002 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/16/2365.short }}</ref>\n\n===Body covering===\nChondrichthyans have toothlike scales called [[dermal denticle]]s or placoid scales. Denticles usually provide protection, and in most cases, streamlining. Mucous glands exist in some species, as well.\n\nIt is assumed that their oral teeth evolved from dermal denticles that migrated into the mouth, but it could be the other way around, as the [[Teleostei|teleost]] bony fish ''[[Denticeps clupeoides]]'' has most of its head covered by dermal teeth (as does, probably, ''[[Atherion elymus]]'', another bony fish). This is most likely a secondary evolved characteristic, which means there is not necessarily a connection between the teeth and the original dermal scales.\n\nThe old [[placoderms]] did not have teeth at all, but had sharp bony plates in their mouth. Thus, it is unknown whether the dermal or oral teeth evolved first. It has even been suggested{{by whom?|date=August 2018}} that the original bony plates of ''all'' vertebrates are now gone and that the present scales are just modified teeth, even if both the teeth and body armor had a common origin a long time ago. However, there is currently no evidence of this.\n\n===Respiratory system===\nAll chondrichthyans breathe through five to seven pairs of [[gill]]s, depending on the species. In general, pelagic species must keep swimming to keep oxygenated water moving through their gills, whilst demersal species can actively pump water in through their spiracles and out through their gills. However, this is only a general rule and many species differ.\n\nA [[spiracle]] is a small hole found behind each eye. These can be tiny and circular, such as found on the nurse shark (''Ginglymostoma cirratum''), to extended and slit-like, such as found on the wobbegongs (Orectolobidae). Many larger, pelagic species, such as the mackerel sharks (Lamnidae) and the thresher sharks (Alopiidae), no longer possess them.\n\n=== Nervous System ===\n[[File:Skate Brain Regions.png|thumb|Regions of a Chondrichthyes brain colored and labeled on dissected skate. The rostral end of the skate is to the right.]]\nChondrichthyes nervous system is composed of a small brain, 8-10 pairs of cranial nerves, and a spinal chord with spinal nerves<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Collin|first=Shaun P.|date=2012|title=The Neuroecology of Cartilaginous Fishes: Sensory Strategies for Survival|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/339870|journal=Brain, Behavior and Evolution|language=english|volume=80|issue=2|pages=80\u201396|doi=10.1159/000339870|issn=1421-9743}}</ref>. They have several sensory organs which provide information to be processed. [[Ampullae of Lorenzini]] are a network of small jelly filled pores called [[Electroreception|electroreceptors]] which help the fish sense electric fields in water. This aids in finding prey, navigation, and sensing temperature. The [[Lateral line]] system has modified epithelial cells located externally which sense motion, vibration, and pressure in the water around them. Most subspecies have large well-developed eyes. Also, they have very powerful nostrils and [[Olfactory bulb|olfactory]] organs. Their inner ears consist of 3 large [[semicircular canals]] which aid in balance and orientation. Their sound detecting apparatus has limited range and is typically more powerful at lower frequencies. Some subspecies have [[Electric organ (biology)|electric organs]] which can be used for defense and predation. They have relatively simple brains with the forebrain not greatly enlarged. The structure and formation of myelin in their nervous systems are nearly identical to that of tetrapods, which has led evolutionary biologists to believe that Chondrichthyes were a cornerstone group in the evolutionary timeline of myelin development.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=de Bellard|first=Maria Elena|date=2016-06-15|title=Myelin in cartilaginous fish|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2016.01.013|journal=Brain Research|volume=1641|pages=34\u201342|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2016.01.013|issn=0006-8993|pmc=4909530|pmid=26776480}}</ref>\n\n===Immune system===\nLike all other jawed vertebrates, members of Chondrichthyes have an [[adaptive immune system#Evolution|adaptive immune system]].<ref name=ref1>{{cite journal |last=Flajnik |first=M.

Development is usually live birth ([[ovoviviparous]] species) but can be through eggs ([[oviparous]]). Some rare species are [[viviparous]].

This group includes the rat fishes (e.g., ''[[Chimaera]]''), rabbit-fishes (e.g., ''[[Hydrolagus]]'') and elephant-fishes (''[[Callorhynchus]]''). Today, they preserve some features of elasmobranch life in Paleaozoic times, though in other respects they are aberrant. They live close to the bottom and feed on molluscs and other invertebrates. The tail is long and thin and they move by sweeping movements of the large pectoral fins. There is an erectile spine in front of the dorsal fin, sometimes poisonous. There is no stomach (that is, the gut is simplified and the 'stomach' is merged with the intestine), and the mouth is a small aperture surrounded by lips, giving the head a parrot-like appearance.\n\nThe fossil record of the Holocephali starts in the [[Devonian]] period. The record is extensive, but most fossils are teeth, and the body forms of numerous species are not known, or at best poorly understood. \n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=13 | Extant [[Order (biology)|orders]] of cartilaginous fishes\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Group\n! rowspan=2 | Order\n! rowspan=2 | Image\n! rowspan=2 | Common name\n! rowspan=2 | Authority\n! rowspan=2 | Families\n! rowspan=2 | Genera\n! colspan=4 | Species\n! rowspan=2 | Note\n|-\n!

The modern bony fishes, class [[Osteichthyes]], appeared in the late [[Silurian]] or early Devonian, about 416 million years ago. Cartilaginous fishes first appeared about 395 Ma, having evolved from ''[[Doliodus]]''-like [[spiny shark]] ancestors. The first abundant genus of shark, ''[[Cladoselache]]'', appeared in the oceans during the Devonian Period.\n\nA Bayesian analysis of molecular data suggests that the Holocephali and Elasmoblanchii diverged in the [[Silurian]] ({{Ma|421}}) and that the sharks and rays/skates split in the [[Carboniferous]] ({{Ma|306}}).\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 style=\"background:{{period color|Devonian}}\" | <center>[[Devonian]]</center>\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#ddf8f8;\"| [[Devonian]] (419\u2013359 mya)\n|-\n| [[File:Early Shark.jpg|140px]]\n| ''[[Cladoselache]]''\n| ''[[Cladoselache]]'' was the first abundant genus of primitive shark, appearing about 370 Ma.{{sfn|The Marshall Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Animals|1999|p=26}} It grew to {{convert|6|ft|m}} long, with anatomical features similar to modern [[mackerel shark]]s.

These included some, like ''[[Psammodus]]'', with crushing pavement-like teeth adapted for grinding the shells of brachiopods, crustaceans, and other marine organisms. Other sharks had piercing teeth, such as the [[Symmoriida]]; some, the [[Petalodontiformes|petalodonts]], had peculiar cycloid cutting teeth. Most of the sharks were marine, but the [[Xenacanthida]] invaded fresh waters of the coal swamps.

He received most of his higher education at [[Uppsala University]] and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also published the first edition of his ''{{lang|la|[[Systema Naturae]]}}'' in the Netherlands.

Another Swedish scientist, [[Johan Andreas Murray]] issued the ''Regnum Vegetabile'' section separately in 1774 as the ''Systema Vegetabilium'', rather confusingly labelled the 13th edition.{{sfn|Linn\u00e9|1774}} Meanwhile a 13th edition of the entire ''Systema'' appeared in parts between 1788 and 1793.

Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by [[Carl Gyllenborg]] (in 1744\u20131745), crown-prince [[Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden|Adolf Fredrik]] (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerstr\u00f6m (in 1748 and 1750) and [[Jonas Alstr\u00f6mer]] (in 1749).

This resulted in a physical separation between the two collections, the museum collection remained in the botanical garden of the university.

This distinction was taken up by other naturalists, most notably [[Georges Cuvier]]. Some elevated the distinction to the level of [[order (biology)|order]]. However, the many affinities between humans and other primates \u2013 and especially the great apes \u2013 made it clear that the distinction made no scientific sense. [[Charles Darwin]] wrote, in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' in 1871:\n\n<blockquote>The greater number of naturalists who have taken into consideration the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|Blumenbach]] and [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]], and have placed man in a separate Order, under the title of the Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by [[Theodor Ludwig Wilhelm Bischoff|Bischoff]], [[Christoph Theodor Aeby|Aeby]], and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head.</blockquote></ref> I absolutely know of none.

Edinburgh for example is a city on the coast of Great Britain.\n\nA [[pelagic]] coast refers to a coast which fronts the open ocean, as opposed to a more sheltered coast in a gulf or [[bay]]. A [[shore]], on the other hand, can refer to parts of land adjoining any large [[body of water]], including oceans (sea shore) and [[lake]]s (lake shore). Similarly, the somewhat related term \"[stream bed/bank]\" refers to the land alongside or sloping down to a [[river]] (riverbank) or body of water smaller than a lake. \"Bank\" is also used in some parts of the world to refer to an artificial ridge of earth intended to retain the water of a river or [[pond]]; in other places this may be called a [[levee]].\n \nWhile many scientific experts might agree on a common definition of the term \"coast\", the delineation of the extents of a coast differ according to [[jurisdiction]], with many scientific and government authorities in various countries differing for economic and social policy reasons. According to the UN atlas, 44% of people live within {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=off}} of the sea.<ref name=\"UN Atlas\">{{cite web|title=UN Atlas|url=http://coastalchallenges.com/2010/01/31/un-atlas-60-of-us-live-in-the-coastal-areas/|accessdate=31 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102170907/http://coastalchallenges.com/2010/01/31/un-atlas-60-of-us-live-in-the-coastal-areas/|archivedate=2 November 2013|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Formation {{anchor|Formation of Coasts}}==\n[[File:Porto Covo pano April 2009-4.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Atlantic rocky coastline, showing a surf area. Porto Covo, west coast of Portugal]]\n[[Tide]]s often determine the range over which [[sediment]] is deposited or eroded. Areas with high tidal ranges allow waves to reach farther up the shore, and areas with lower tidal ranges produce deposition at a smaller elevation interval. The tidal range is influenced by the size and shape of the coastline. Tides do not typically cause erosion by themselves; however, [[tidal bore]]s can erode as the waves surge up river [[Estuary|estuaries]] from the ocean.<ref>Davidson (2002), p.421.</ref>\n\nWaves erode coastline as they break on shore releasing their energy; the larger the wave the more energy it releases and the more sediment it moves. Coastlines with longer shores have more room for the waves to disperse their energy, while coasts with cliffs and short shore faces give little room for the wave energy to be dispersed. In these areas the wave energy breaking against the cliffs is higher, and air and water are compressed into cracks in the rock, forcing the rock apart, breaking it down. Sediment deposited by waves comes from eroded cliff faces and is moved along the coastline by the waves. This forms an [[abrasion coast|abrasion]] or [[cliffed coast]].\n\nSediment deposited by rivers is the dominant influence on the amount of sediment located on a coastline.<ref name=Easterbrook>Easterbrook (1999).</ref> Today riverine deposition at the coast is often blocked by dams and other human regulatory devices, which remove the sediment from the stream by causing it to be deposited inland.\n\nLike the ocean which shapes them, coasts are a dynamic environment with constant change. The Earth's natural processes, particularly [[sea level rise]]s, waves and various [[weather]] phenomena, have resulted in the [[erosion]], [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] and reshaping of coasts as well as flooding and creation of [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and drowned river valleys ([[ria]]s).\n\n==Environmental importance==\n[[File:Somalia 16.08.2009 08-30-13.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Somalia]] has the longest coastline in Africa]]\nThe coast and its adjacent areas on and off shore are an important part of a local [[ecosystem]]: the mixture of [[fresh water]] and [[Seawater|salt water]] ([[brackish water]]) in [[estuary|estuaries]] provides many nutrients for marine life. [[Salt marsh]]es and [[beach]]es also support a diversity of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s and [[insect]]s crucial to the [[food chain]].\n\nThe high level of [[biodiversity]] creates a high level of biological activity, which has attracted human activity for thousands of years.\n\n==Human impacts==\n\n===Human uses of coasts===\n[[File:The CHW system.png|thumb|The Coastal Hazard Wheel system published by UNEP for global coastal management]]\n[[File:Marbleheadcoastline.jpg|thumb|A settled coastline in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]].

Some  [[landlocked]] places have achieved port status by building [[canal]]s.\n\nThe coast is a frontier that nations have typically defended against military invaders, smugglers and illegal migrants. Fixed [[Coastal defence and fortification|coastal defenses]] have long been erected in many nations and coastal countries typically have a [[navy]] and some form of [[coast guard]].\n\nCoasts, especially those with [[beach]]es and warm water, attract [[tourists]]. In many [[island nation]]s such as those of the Mediterranean, South Pacific and Caribbean, tourism is central to the economy. Coasts offer recreational activities such as [[human swimming|swimming]], [[fishing]], [[surfing]], [[boating]], and [[Sunlight#Sunbathing|sunbathing]]. [[Growth management]] can be a challenge for coastal [[local government|local authorities]] who often struggle to provide the [[infrastructure]] required by new residents.\n\n===Threats to a coast===\nCoasts also face many [[Human impact on the environment|human-induced environmental impacts]]. The human influence on [[climate change]] is thought to contribute to an accelerated trend in [[sea level rise]] which threatens coastal [[habitat]]s.\n\n[[Marine pollution|Pollution]] can occur from a number of sources: [[Marine debris|garbage and industrial debris]]; the [[Petroleum transport|transportation of petroleum]] in [[tanker (ship)|tankers]], increasing the probability of large [[oil spill]]s; small oil spills created by large and small vessels, which flush [[bilge]] water into the ocean.\n\nFishing has declined due to [[Environmental effects of fishing|habitat degradation]], [[overfishing]], [[trawling]], [[bycatch]] and [[climate change]]. Since the growth of global fishing enterprises after the 1950s, intensive fishing has spread from a few concentrated areas to encompass nearly all fisheries. The scraping of the ocean floor in [[Bottom trawling|bottom dragging]] is devastating to [[coral]], [[sponges]] and other long-lived species that do not recover quickly. This destruction alters the functioning of the ecosystem and can permanently alter species composition and biodiversity. [[Bycatch]], the capture of unintended species in the course of fishing, is typically returned to the ocean only to die from injuries or exposure. Bycatch represents about a quarter of all marine catch. In the case of [[shrimp]] capture, the bycatch is five times larger than the shrimp caught.\n\nIt is believed that melting [[Arctic ice]] will cause sea levels to rise and flood coastal areas.\n{{further information|Marine pollution|Marine debris}}\n\n===Conservation===\nExtraordinary [[population growth]] in the 21st century has placed stress on the planet's ecosystems. For example, on [[Saint Lucia]], harvesting [[mangrove]] for timber and clearing for fishing reduced the mangrove forests, resulting in a [[habitat loss|loss of habitat]] and spawning grounds for marine life that was unique to the area. These forests also helped to stabilize the coastline. Conservation efforts since the 1980s have partially [[ecological restoration|restored the ecosystem]].\n\n==Types of coast==\nAccording to one principle of classification, an emergent coastline is a coastline which has experienced a fall in sea level, because of either a global sea level change, or local uplift. Emergent coastlines are identifiable by the coastal [[landform]]s, which are above the high tide mark, such as [[raised beach]]es. In contrast, a submergent coastline is one where the sea level has risen, due to a global sea level change, local [[subsidence]], or [[isostatic rebound]]. Submergent coastlines are identifiable by their submerged, or \"drowned\" landforms, such as [[ria]]s (drowned valleys) and [[fjord]]s.\n{{further information|Emergent coastline|Submergent coastline}}\n\nAccording to a second principle of classification, a concordant coastline is a coastline where bands of different rock types run parallel to the shore. These rock types are usually of varying [[Geological resistance|resistance]], so the coastline forms distinctive landforms, such as coves. Discordant coastlines feature distinctive landforms because the rocks are [[erosion|eroded]] by ocean [[wave]]s. The less resistant rocks erode faster, creating [[inlet]]s or [[bay]]; the more resistant rocks erode more slowly, remaining as [[headland]]s or [[outcrop]]pings.\n{{further information|Concordant coastline|Discordant coastline}}\n\nOther coastal categories:\n*A [[cliffed coast]] or abrasion coast is one where marine action has produced steep declivities known as [[cliff]]s.\n*A [[flat coast]] is one where the land gradually descends into the sea.\n*A [[graded shoreline]] is one where wind and water action has produced a flat and straight coastline.\n\n== Coastal landforms ==\n[[File:Accreting coast Image6.svg|thumb|Coastal landforms. The feature shown here as a [[bay]] would, in certain (mainly southern) parts of [[Great Britain|Britain]], be called a [[cove]]. That between the cuspate foreland and the tombolo is a British bay.]]\nThe following articles describe some coastal landforms\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=24em}}\n*[[Bay]]\n*[[Headland]]\n*[[Cove]]\n*[[Peninsula]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Cliff erosion===\n* Much of the sediment deposited along a coast is the result of erosion of a surrounding [[cliff]], or bluff. [[Sea cliff]]s retreat landward because of the constant undercutting of slopes by waves. If the slope/cliff being undercut is made of unconsolidated sediment it will erode at a much faster rate then a cliff made of bedrock.<ref name=Easterbrook/>\n*A [[natural arch]] is formed when a headland is eroded through by waves.\n*[[Sea cave]]s are made when certain rock beds are more susceptible to erosion than the surrounding rock beds because of different areas of weakness. These areas are eroded at a faster pace creating a hole or crevice that, through time, by means of wave action and erosion, becomes a cave.\n*A [[stack (geology)|stack]] is formed when a headland is eroded away by wave and wind action.\n*A [[Stack (geology)|stump]] is a shortened sea stack that has been eroded away or fallen because of instability.\n* Wave-cut notches are caused by the undercutting of overhanging slopes which leads to increased stress on cliff material and a greater probability that the slope material will fall. The fallen debris accumulates at the bottom of the cliff and is eventually removed by waves.\n*A [[wave-cut platform]] forms after erosion and retreat of a sea cliff has been occurring for a long time. Gently sloping wave-cut platforms develop early on in the first stages of cliff retreat. Later, the length of the platform decreases because the waves lose their energy as they break further off shore.<ref name=Easterbrook/>\n\n===Coastal features formed by sediment===\n{{Div col|colwidth=24em}}\n*[[Beach]]\n*[[Beach cusps]]\n*[[Raised beach]]\n*[[Cuspate foreland]]\n*[[Dune|Dune system]]\n*[[Mudflat]]\n*[[Ria]]\n*[[Shoal]]\n*[[Strand plain]]\n*[[Spit (landform)|Spit]]\n*[[Surge channel]]\n*[[Tombolo]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Coastal features formed by another feature===\n*[[Lagoon]]\n*[[Salt marsh]]\n\n===Other features on the coast===\n{{Div col|colwidth=24em}}\n*[[Concordant coastline]]\n*[[Discordant coastline]]\n*[[Fjord]]\n*[[Island]]\n*[[Island arc]]\n*[[Machair]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Coastal processes==\nThe following articles describe the various geologic processes that affect a coastal zone:\n{{Div col|colwidth=24em}}\n*[[Attrition (weathering)|Attrition]]\n*[[Ocean current|Currents]]\n*[[Denudation]]\n*[[Deposition (geology)|Deposition]]\n*[[Erosion]]\n*[[Flood]]ing\n*[[Longshore drift]]\n*[[Saltation (geology)|Saltation]]\n*[[Sea level change]]\n**[[eustatic]]\n**[[isostasy|isostatic]]\n*[[Sedimentation]]\n* [[Coastal sediment supply]]\n**[[sediment transport]]\n**[[solution]]\n**[[subaerial]] processes\n**[[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]\n*[[Tide]]s\n*[[Wind wave|Water waves]]\n**[[diffraction]]\n**[[refraction]]\n**[[wave breaking]]\n**[[wave shoaling]]\n*[[Weathering]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Wildlife==\n{{See also|Seashore wildlife|Coastal fish}}\n{{Unsourced section|date=April 2018}}\n===Animals===\nSome of the animals live along a typical coast. There are animals like [[puffin]]s, [[sea turtle]]s and [[rockhopper penguin]]s. [[Gastropoda|Sea snails]] and various kinds of [[barnacle]]s live on the coast and scavenge on food deposited by the sea. Most coastal animals are used to humans in developed areas, such as [[dolphin]]s and [[seagulls]] who eat food thrown for them by tourists. Since the coastal areas are all part of the [[littoral zone]], there is a profusion of marine life found just off-coast.\n\nThere are many kinds of [[seabird]]s on the coast. [[Pelican]]s and [[cormorant]]s join up with [[tern]]s and [[oystercatcher]]s to forage for fish and shellfish on the coast. There are sea lions on the coast of Wales and other countries.\n\n===Plants===\nCoastal areas are famous for their [[kelp]] beds. Kelp is a fast-growing [[seaweed]] that grows up to a metre a day. [[Coral]]s and [[sea anemone]]s are true animals, but live a lifestyle similar to that of plants. [[Mangroves]], [[seagrass]]es and [[salt marsh]] are important coastal vegetation types in tropical and temperate environments respectively.\n\n==Coastline statistics==\n\n===Coastline problem===\n{{main article|Coastline paradox}}\n\nShortly before 1951, [[Lewis Fry Richardson#Research on the length of coastlines and borders|Lewis Fry Richardson]], in researching the possible effect of border lengths on the probability of war, noticed that the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] reported their measured border with [[Spain]] to be 987&nbsp;km, but the Spanish reported it as 1214&nbsp;km. This was the beginning of the coastline problem, which is a mathematical uncertainty inherent in the measurement of boundaries that are irregular.<ref>{{Cite book |contributor-last=Drazin |contributor-first=P. G. |contribution=Fractals |last=Richardson |first=Lewis Fry |pages=45\u201346 |title=The Collected Papers of Lewis Fry Richardson: Meteorology and numerical analysis |volume=1 |editor1-first=Oliver M. |editor1-last=Ashford |editor2-first= H. |editor2-last=Charnock |editor3-first= P.

R. |editor4-last=Hunt |display-editors = 3 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-521-38297-1}}</ref>\n\nThe prevailing method of estimating the length of a border (or coastline) was to lay out ''n'' equal straight-line segments of length ''\u2113'' with [[Caliper#Divider caliper|dividers]] on a map or aerial photograph. Each end of the segment must be on the boundary. Investigating the discrepancies in border estimation, Richardson discovered what is now termed the '''Richardson Effect''': the sum of the segments is inversely proportional to the common length of the segments. In effect, the shorter the ruler, the longer the measured border; the Spanish and Portuguese geographers were simply using different-length rulers.\n\nThe result most astounding to Richardson is that, under certain circumstances, as ''\u2113'' approaches zero, the length of the coastline approaches [[infinity]]. Richardson had believed, based on Euclidean geometry, that a coastline would approach a fixed length, as do similar estimations of regular geometric figures. For example, the [[perimeter]] of a regular [[polygon]] inscribed in a [[circle]] approaches the [[circumference]] with increasing numbers of sides (and decrease in the length of one side). In [[geometric measure theory]] such a smooth curve as the circle that can be approximated by small straight segments with a definite limit is termed a [[rectifiable curve]].\n\n===Measuring a coastline===\nMore than a decade after Richardson completed his work, [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] developed a new branch of [[mathematics]], [[fractal geometry]], to describe just such non-rectifiable complexes in nature as the infinite coastline.<ref name=MB28>Mandelbrot (1983) page 28.</ref> His own definition of the new figure serving as the basis for his study is:<ref>Mandelbrot (1983), page 1.</ref>{{Quote|I coined ''[[fractal]]'' from the [[Latin]] adjective ''fractus''. The corresponding Latin verb ''frangere'' means \"to break:\" to create irregular fragments. It is therefore sensible ... that, in addition to \"fragmented\" ... ''fractus'' should also mean \"irregular.\"}}\n\nA key property of the fractal is [[self-similarity]]; that is, at any [[Scale (spatial)|scale]] the same general configuration appears. A coastline is perceived as bays alternating with promontories. In the hypothetical situation that a given coastline has this property of self-similarity, then no matter how greatly any one small section of coastline is magnified, a similar pattern of smaller bays and promontories superimposed on larger bays and promontories appears, right down to the grains of sand. At that scale the coastline appears as a momentarily shifting, potentially infinitely long thread with a [[stochastic]] arrangement of bays and promontories formed from the small objects at hand. In such an environment (as opposed to smooth curves) Mandelbrot asserts<ref name=MB28/> \"coastline length turns out to be an elusive notion that slips between the fingers of those who want to grasp it.\"\n\nThere are different kinds of fractals. A coastline with the stated property is in \"a first category of fractals, namely curves whose fractal dimension is greater than 1.\" That last statement represents an extension by Mandelbrot of Richardson's thought. Mandelbrot's statement of the Richardson Effect is:<ref>Mandelbrot (1983), pages 29\u201331.</ref>\n\n:<math>L(\\epsilon)\\sim F\\epsilon^{1-D}\\,</math>\n\nwhere L, coastline length, a function of the measurement unit, \u03b5, is approximated by the expression. F is a constant and D is a parameter that Richardson found depended on the coastline approximated by L. He gave no theoretical explanation but Mandelbrot identified D with a non-integer form of the [[Hausdorff dimension]], later the fractal dimension. Rearranging the right side of the expression obtains:\n\n:<math>\\frac {F} {\\epsilon^{D}} \\cdot \\epsilon</math>\n\nwhere F\u03b5<sup>\u2212D</sup> must be the number of units \u03b5 required to obtain L. The fractal dimension is the number of the dimensions of the figure being used to approximate the fractal: 0 for a dot, 1 for a line, 2 for a square. D in the expression is between 1 and 2, for coastlines typically less than 1.5. The broken line measuring the coast does not extend in one direction nor does it represent an area, but is intermediate. It can be interpreted as a thick line or band of width 2\u03b5. More broken coastlines have greater D and therefore L is longer for the same \u03b5. Mandelbrot showed that D is independent of \u03b5.\n\n{{details|How Long Is the Coast of Britain?

Stuporous catatonia is characterised by immobility during which people may hold rigid poses ([[stupor]]), an inability to speak ([[mutism]]), as well as [[waxy flexibility]], in which they maintain positions after being placed in them by someone else. [[Mutism]] may be partial and they may repeat meaningless phrases or speak only to repeat what someone else says. People with stuporous catatonia may also show stereotyped, repetitive movements ([[stereotypy]]). Excited catatonia is characterised by bizarre, non-goal directed hyperactivity and impulsiveness.\n\nCatatonia is a syndrome that can occur in various psychiatric disorders, including [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[schizophreniform disorder]], [[brief psychotic disorder]], and substance-induced psychotic disorder. It appears as the Kahlbaum syndrome (motionless catatonia), malignant catatonia (neuroleptic malignant syndrome, [[Serotonin syndrome|toxic serotonin syndrome]]), and excited forms (delirious mania, catatonic excitement, [[oneirophrenia]]).<ref name = \"Fink & Taylor\">Fink M, Taylor MA: CATATONIA: A Clinician's Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment, Cambridge U Press, 2003\"</ref> \nIt has also been recognized as grafted on to [[autism spectrum disorders]].<ref>Dhossche D et al.: Catatonia in Autism Spectrum Disorders, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2006</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nAccording to the [[DSM-5]], \"Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder (Catatonia Specifier)\" (code 293.89 [F06.1]) is diagnosed if the clinical picture is dominated by at least three of the following:<ref name=\"DSM-5-introduction\">{{Cite book| first=| last= American Psychiatric Association| year= 2013| title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders| edition=Fifth| publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing| location=Arlington, VA| page=119\u2013121| isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8}}</ref>\n\n* [[stupor]] (i.e., no psychomotor activity; not actively relating to environment)\n* [[catalepsy]] (i.e., passive induction of a posture held against gravity)\n* [[waxy flexibility]] (i.e., allow positioning by examiner and maintain position)\n* [[mutism]] (i.e., no, or very little, verbal response [exclude if known [[aphasia]]])\n* [[negativism]] (i.e., opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli)\n* [[posturing]] (i.e., spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity)\n* [[mannerisms]] (i.e., odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions)\n* [[stereotypy]] (i.e., repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed movements)\n* agitation, not influenced by external stimuli\n* grimacing (i.e. making a [[Facial expression|grimace]] like children)\n* [[echolalia]] (i.e., mimicking another's speech)\n* [[echopraxia]] (i.e., mimicking another's movements)\n\nOther disorders (used additional code 293.89 [F06.1] to indicate the presence of the [[Comorbidity|comorbid]] catatonia):\n* Catatonia associated with [[autism spectrum disorder]].\n* Catatonia associated with [[schizophrenia]] spectrum and other psychotic disorders.\n** Catatonia associated with [[brief psychotic disorder]]\n** Catatonia associated with [[schizophreniform disorder]]\n** Catatonia associated with [[schizoaffective disorder]]\n** Catatonia associated with substance-induced psychotic disorder\n* Catatonia associated with [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] and related disorders.\n* Catatonia associated with [[major depressive disorder]]\n* Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition.\n\nIf catatonic [[symptom]]s are present but they don't form the catatonic [[syndrome]], a medication-induced or substance-induced aetiology should first be considered.<ref name=\"DSM-5Differential\">{{cite book |author=Michael B.

Amantadine may have an increased incidence of tolerance with prolonged use and can cause psychosis, due to its additional effects on the dopamine system. Memantine has a more targeted pharmacological profile for the glutamate system, reduced incidence of psychosis and may therefore be preferred for individuals who cannot tolerate amantadine. [[Topiramate]] is another treatment option for resistant catatonia; it produces its therapeutic effects by producing glutamate antagonism via modulation of AMPA receptors.<ref name=\"Carroll-2007\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = BT. | last2 = Goforth | first2 = HW. | last3 = Thomas | first3 = C. | last4 = Ahuja | first4 = N. | last5 = McDaniel | first5 = WW. | last6 = Kraus | first6 = MF. | last7 = Spiegel | first7 = DR. | last8 = Franco | first8 = KN. | last9 = Pozuelo | first9 = L. | last10 = Munoz | first10 = C. | title = Review of adjunctive glutamate antagonist therapy in the treatment of catatonic syndromes | url = http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/19/4/406 | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 406\u201312 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.19.4.406 | pmid = 18070843 | display-authors = 8 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Autistic catatonia]]\n*''[[Awakenings]]'' (1990 biopic about catatonic patients, based on [[Oliver Sachs]]' [[Awakenings (book)|book of the same name]])\n*[[Blank expression]]\n*[[Botulism]]\n*[[Disorganized schizophrenia]]\n*[[Homecoming (novel)|Homecoming]] (features catatonia as a main plot point)\n*[[Karolina Olsson]]\n*[[Oneiroid syndrome]]\n*[[Paranoid schizophrenia]]\n*[[Persistent vegetative state]]\n*[[Resignation Syndrome|Resignation syndrome]]\n*[[Tonic immobility]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical condition classification and resources\n|  ICD10       = {{ICD10|F|06|1|f|06}}\n|  ICD9        = {{ICD9|293.89}}\n|  MeshID      = D002389\n}}\n* [http://ccpweb.wustl.edu/pdfs/2013barchcatatonia.pdf Catatonia in DSM-5]\n* [http://www.minddisorders.com/Br-Del/Catatonic-disorders.html Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders - Catatonic Disorders]\n\n{{Mental and behavioral disorders|selected = symptoms}}\n\n[[Category:Mental and behavioural disorders]]\n[[Category:Schizophrenia]]\n[[Category:Psychopathological syndromes]]", "sha1": "4k3djf9n6qcuaeofli2rg6sy53tnbsj"}}, {"title": "CountriesY", "ns": "0", "id": "5238", "redirect": {"title": "List of sovereign states"}, "revision": {"id": "15903461", "parentid": "6024065", "timestamp": "2004-09-20T22:20:25Z", "contributor": {"username": "Timwi", "id": "13051"}, "minor": "", "comment": "fix double-redirect", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[List of sovereign states]]", "sha1": "g3zls5r5fqdtfj0bvcw8dgl0zach6nw"}}, {"title": "Countably infinite", "ns": "0", "id": "5239", "redirect": {"title": "Countable set"}, "revision": {"id": "349779375", "parentid": "15903462", "timestamp": "2010-03-14T10:17:49Z", "contributor": {"username": "Graham87", "id": "194203"}, "minor": "", "comment": "2 revisions from [[:nost:Countably infinite]]: import old edits, see [[User:Graham87/Import]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Countable set]]", "sha1": "4tovggxlloon1xiscl2ehmbk4lexids"}}, {"title": "Ciliates", "ns": "0", "id": "5242", "redirect": {"title": "Ciliate"}, "revision": {"id": "783860648", "parentid": "779220997", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:29:14Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Ciliate]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from plural}}\n}}", "sha1": "ijyl486uqvccalpokmbun9of11q7k39"}}, {"title": "Cipher", "ns": "0", "id": "5244", "revision": {"id": "858001298", "parentid": "857887721", "timestamp": "2018-09-04T12:28:45Z", "contributor": {"username": "Zontic0", "id": "31925919"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses}}\n{{More footnotes|date=March 2009}}\n\n[[File:Edward Larsson 1885 I.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Larsson]]'s [[Cipher runes|rune cipher]] resembling that found on the [[:en:Kensington Runestone|Kensington Runestone]]. Also includes runically unrelated [[:en:blackletter|blackletter]] writing style and [[:en:pigpen cipher|pigpen cipher]].]]\nIn [[cryptography]], a '''cipher''' (or '''cypher''') is an [[algorithm]] for performing [[encryption]] or [[decryption]]&mdash;a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is ''encipherment''. To encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code. In common parlance, \"cipher\" is synonymous with \"[[code (cryptography)|code]]\", as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially [[classical cryptography]].\n\nCodes generally substitute different length strings of characters in the output, while ciphers generally substitute the same number of characters as are input.  There are exceptions and some cipher systems may use slightly more, or fewer, characters when output versus the number that were input.\n\nCodes operated by substituting according to a large [[codebook]] which linked a random string of characters or numbers to a word or phrase.  For example, \"UQJHSE\" could be the code for \"Proceed to the following coordinates.\" When using a cipher the original information is known as [[plaintext]], and the encrypted form as [[ciphertext]]. The ciphertext message contains all the information of the plaintext message, but is not in a format readable by a human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it.\n\nThe operation of a cipher usually depends on a piece of auxiliary information, called a [[key (cryptography)|key]] (or, in traditional [[NSA]] parlance, a ''cryptovariable''). The encrypting procedure is varied depending on the key, which changes the detailed operation of the algorithm. A key must be selected before using a cipher to encrypt a message. Without knowledge of the key, it should be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to decrypt the resulting ciphertext into readable plaintext.\n\nMost modern ciphers can be categorized in several ways\n* By whether they work on blocks of symbols usually of a fixed size ([[block cipher]]s), or on a continuous stream of symbols ([[stream cipher]]s).\n* By whether the same key is used for both encryption and decryption ([[symmetric key algorithm]]s), or if a different key is used for each ([[asymmetric key algorithm]]s). If the algorithm is symmetric, the key must be known to the recipient and sender and to no one else. If the algorithm is an asymmetric one, the enciphering key is different from, but closely related to, the deciphering key. If one key cannot be deduced from the other, the asymmetric key algorithm has the public/private key property and one of the keys may be made public without loss of confidentiality.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"cipher\" (minority spelling \"cypher\") in former times meant \"zero\" and had the same origin: Middle French as ''{{lang|fr|cifre}}'' and Medieval Latin as ''cifra,'' from the Arabic '''\u0635\u0641\u0631''' ''sifr'' = zero (see [[0 (number)#Etymology|Zero\u2014Etymology]]).  \"Cipher\" was later used for any decimal digit, even any number.  There are many theories about how the word \"cipher\" may have come to mean \"encoding\". In fact the more ancient source of word \"Cypher\" is the ancient Hebrew; there are more than 100 verses in the Hebrew Bible - Torah using word \"Cepher\": means (Book or Story telling), and in some of them the word \"Cipher\" literally means (Counting)-- (Numerical description)-- Example, Book 2 Samuel 24:10, Isaiah 33:18, and Jeremiah 52:25.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n*Encoding often involved numbers.\n*The [[Roman Numerals|Roman number system]] was very cumbersome because there was no concept of zero (or empty space).  The concept of zero (which was also called \"cipher\"), which is now common knowledge, was alien to medieval Europe, so confusing and ambiguous to common Europeans that in arguments people would say \"talk clearly and not so far fetched as a cipher\".  Cipher came to mean concealment of clear messages or encryption.\n**The French formed the word \"{{lang|fr|chiffre}}\" and adopted the Italian word \"{{lang|it|zero}}\".\n**The English used \"zero\" for \"0\", and \"cipher\" from the word \"ciphering\" as a means of computing.\n**The Germans used the words \"Ziffer\" (digit) and \"Chiffre\".\n**The Dutch still use the word \"cijfer\" to refer to a numerical digit.\n**The Slovaks, similarly, also use the word \"cifra\" to refer to a numerical digit.\n**The Serbians use the word \"cifra\", which refers to a digit, or in some cases, any number. Besides \"cifra\", they use word \"broj\" for a number.\n**The Italians and the Spanish also use the word \"cifra\" to refer to a number.\n**The Swedes use the word \"siffra\" which refers to a digit and \"nummer\" to refer to a combination of \"siffror\".\nIbrahim Al-Kadi concluded that the Arabic word ''sifr'', for the digit zero, developed into the European technical term for encryption.<ref>Ibrahim A. Al-Kadi, \"Cryptography and Data Security: Cryptographic Properties of Arabic\", proceedings of the Third Saudi Engineering Conference. Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: Nov 24-27, Vol 2:910-921., 1991.</ref>\n\nAs the decimal zero and its new mathematics spread from the Arabic world to Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], words derived from ''sifr'' and ''zephyrus'' came to refer to calculation, as well as to privileged knowledge and secret codes. According to Ifrah, \"in thirteenth-century Paris, a 'worthless fellow' was called a {{lang|fro|'... cifre en algorisme'}}, i.e., an 'arithmetical nothing'.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Georges |last=Ifrah |title=The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer |location= |publisher=Wiley |year=2000 |isbn=0-471-39340-1 }}</ref> Cipher was the European pronunciation of sifr, and cipher came to mean a message or communication not easily understood.<ref>The Muslim next door : the Qur'an, the media, and that veil thing, Sumbul Ali-Karamali, 2008, pp. 240-241</ref>\n\n==Versus codes==\n{{Main|Code (cryptography)}}\nIn non-technical usage, a \"(secret) [[code (cryptography)|code]]\" typically means a \"cipher\". Within technical discussions, however, the words \"code\" and \"cipher\" refer to two different concepts. Codes work at the level of meaning\u2014that is, words or phrases are converted into something else and this chunking generally shortens the message.\n\nAn example of this is the [[Commercial code (communications)|Commercial Telegraph Code]] which was used to shorten long telegraph messages which resulted from entering into commercial contracts using exchanges of [[Telegram]]s.\n\nAnother example is given by whole word ciphers, which allow the user to replace an entire word with a symbol or character, much like the way Japanese utilize Kanji (Japanese) characters to supplement their language. ex \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\" becomes \"The quick brown \u72d0 jumps \u8fc7 the lazy \u72d7\".\n\nCiphers, on the other hand, work at a lower level: the level of individual letters, small groups of letters, or, in modern schemes, individual bits and blocks of bits. Some systems used both codes and ciphers in one system, using [[superencipherment]] to increase the security. In some cases the terms codes and ciphers are also used synonymously to substitution and transposition.\n\nHistorically, cryptography was split into a dichotomy of codes and ciphers; and coding had its own terminology, analogous to that for ciphers: \"''encoding'', ''codetext'', ''decoding''\" and so on.\n\nHowever, codes have a variety of drawbacks, including susceptibility to [[cryptanalysis]] and the difficulty of managing a cumbersome [[codebook]]. Because of this, codes have fallen into disuse in modern cryptography, and ciphers are the dominant technique.\n\n==Types==\nThere are a variety of different types of encryption. Algorithms used earlier in the [[history of cryptography]] are substantially different from modern methods, and modern ciphers can be classified according to how they operate and whether they use one or two keys.\n\n===Historical===\nHistorical pen and paper ciphers used in the past are sometimes known as [[classical cipher]]s. They include simple [[substitution cipher]]s (such as [[Rot 13]]) and [[transposition cipher]]s (such as a [[Rail Fence Cipher]]). For example, \"GOOD DOG\" can be encrypted as \"PLLX XLP\" where \"L\" substitutes for \"O\", \"P\" for \"G\", and \"X\" for \"D\" in the message.  Transposition of the letters \"GOOD DOG\" can result in \"DGOGDOO\". These simple ciphers and examples are easy to crack, even without plaintext-ciphertext pairs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saltzman|first=Benjamin A.|title=Ut hkskdkxt: Early Medieval Cryptography, Textual Errors, and Scribal Agency (Speculum, forthcoming)|url=https://www.academia.edu/35034685/Ut_hkskdkxt_Early_Medieval_Cryptography_Textual_Errors_and_Scribal_Agency_Speculum_forthcoming_|journal=Speculum|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSimple '''ciphers''' were replaced by [[polyalphabetic substitution]] ciphers (such as the [[Vigen\u00e8re cipher|Vigen\u00e8re]]) which changed the substitution alphabet for every letter.  For example, \"GOOD DOG\" can be encrypted as \"PLSX TWF\" where \"L\", \"S\", and \"W\" substitute for \"O\".  With even a small amount of known or estimated plaintext, simple polyalphabetic substitution ciphers and letter transposition ciphers designed for pen and paper encryption are easy to crack.<ref>{{harvnb|Stinson|loc=p. 45}}</ref> It is possible to create a secure pen and paper cipher based on a [[one-time pad]] though, but the [[One-time pad#Problems|usual disadvantages of one-time pads]] apply.\n\nDuring the early twentieth century, electro-mechanical machines were invented to do encryption and decryption using transposition, polyalphabetic substitution, and a kind of \"additive\" substitution.  In [[rotor machine]]s, several rotor disks provided polyalphabetic substitution, while plug boards provided another substitution. Keys were easily changed by changing the rotor disks and the plugboard wires. Although these encryption methods were more complex than previous schemes and required machines to encrypt and decrypt, other machines such as the British [[Bombe]] were invented to crack these encryption methods.\n\n===Modern===\nModern encryption methods can be divided by two criteria: by type of key used, and by type of input data.\n\nBy type of key used ciphers are divided into:\n* [[symmetric key algorithm]]s ([[Private-key cryptography]]), where the same key is used for encryption and decryption, and\n* [[asymmetric key algorithm]]s ([[Public-key cryptography]]), where two different keys are used for encryption and decryption.\n\nIn a symmetric key algorithm (e.g., [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]]), the sender and receiver must have a shared key set up in advance and kept secret from all other parties; the sender uses this key for encryption, and the receiver uses the same key for decryption.  The [[Feistel cipher]] uses a combination of substitution and transposition techniques. Most block cipher algorithms are based on this structure.  In an asymmetric key algorithm (e.g., [[Rivest Shamir Adleman|RSA]]), there are two separate keys: a ''public key'' is published and enables any sender to perform encryption, while a ''private key'' is kept secret by the receiver and enables only him to perform correct decryption.\n\nCiphers can be distinguished into two types by the type of input data:\n* [[block cipher]]s, which encrypt block of data of fixed size, and\n* [[stream cipher]]s, which encrypt continuous streams of data\n\n==Key size and vulnerability==\nIn a pure mathematical attack, (i.e., lacking any other information to help break a cipher) two factors above all count:\n\n* Computational power available, i.e., the computing power which can be brought to bear on the problem. It is important to note that average performance/capacity of a single computer is not the only factor to consider. An adversary can use multiple computers at once, for instance, to increase the speed of [[exhaustive search]] for a key (i.e., \"brute force\" attack) substantially.\n* [[Key size]], i.e., the size of key used to encrypt a message. As the key size increases, so does the complexity of [[exhaustive search]] to the point where it becomes impractical to crack encryption directly.\nSince the desired effect is computational difficulty, in theory one would choose an [[algorithm]] and desired difficulty level, thus decide the key length accordingly.\n\nAn example of this process can be found at [http://www.keylength.com/ Key Length] which uses multiple reports to suggest that a symmetric cipher with 128 [[binary digit|bit]]s, an asymmetric cipher with 3072 bit keys, and an [[Elliptic curve cryptography|elliptic curve cipher]] with 512 bits, all have similar difficulty at present.\n\n[[Claude Shannon]] proved, using information theory considerations, that any theoretically unbreakable cipher must have keys which are at least as long as the plaintext, and used only once: [[one-time pad]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cryptography}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Autokey cipher]]\n* [[Cover-coding]]\n* [[Cryptography Classification]]\n* [[Encryption software]]\n* [[Famous ciphertexts]]\n* [[Pretty Good Privacy]]\n* [[Steganography]]\n* [[Telegraph code]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Richard J.

The most important was the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', aired starting in 1925 by [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and continuing to the present day. During the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or Western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood. [[Bob Wills]] was another country musician from the Lower [[Great Plains]] who had become very popular as the leader of a \"[[Dixieland|hot]] [[string band]],\" and who also appeared in [[Western (genre)|Hollywood westerns]]. His mix of country and [[jazz]], which started out as dance hall music, would become known as [[Western swing]]. Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an electric guitar to his band, in 1938.<ref name=\"Takecountryback.com\">[http://takecountryback.com/reviews/merlebobwills.htm Takecountryback.com], Merle Haggard - Bob Wills {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513085028/http://takecountryback.com/reviews/merlebobwills.htm |date=May 13, 2008 }}</ref> Country musicians began recording [[boogie-woogie|boogie]] in 1939, shortly after it had been played at [[Carnegie Hall]], when [[Johnny Barfield]] recorded \"Boogie Woogie\".\n\nThe third generation (1950s\u20131960s) started at the end of [[World War II]] with \"mountaineer\" string band music known as [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], which emerged when [[Bill Monroe]], along with [[Lester Flatt]] and [[Earl Scruggs]] were introduced by [[Roy Acuff]] at the Grand Ole Opry. [[Gospel music]] remained a popular component of country music. Another type of stripped-down and raw music with a variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar, bass, [[dobro]] or steel guitar (and later) drums became popular, especially among poor whites in Texas and [[Oklahoma]]. It became known as [[Honky tonk music|honky tonk]], and had its roots in Western swing and the [[ranchera]] music of Mexico and the border states. By the early 1950s a blend of Western swing, country boogie, and honky tonk was played by most country bands. Rockabilly was most popular with country fans in the 1950s, and 1956 could be called the year of [[rockabilly]] in country music, with [[Johnny Cash]] emerging as one of the most popular and enduring representatives of the rockabilly genre; rockabilly was also a starting point for eventual rock-and-roll superstar [[Elvis Presley]], who would return to his country roots near the end of his life. Beginning in the mid-1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the [[Nashville sound]] turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; [[Patsy Cline]] and [[Jim Reeves]] were two of the most broadly popular Nashville sound artists, and their deaths in separate plane crashes in the early 1960s were a factor in the genre's decline. The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the [[British Invasion]], many desired a return to the \"old values\" of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as [[country rock]].\n\nFourth generation (1970s\u20131980s) music included [[outlaw country]] with roots in the [[Bakersfield sound]], and [[country pop]] with roots in the [[Nashville sound|countrypolitan]], folk music and [[soft rock]]. Between 1972 and 1975 singer/guitarist [[John Denver]] released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles. During the early 1980s country artists continued to see their records perform well on the pop charts. In 1980 a style of \"neocountry disco music\" was popularized. During the mid-1980s a group of new artists began to emerge who rejected the more polished country-pop sound that had been prominent on radio and the charts in favor of more traditional \"back-to-basics\" production; this [[neotraditional country|neotraditional movement]] would dominate country music through the late 1980s and was typified by the likes of [[George Strait]]. Attempts to combine [[Punk rock|punk]] and country were pioneered by [[Jason and the Scorchers]], and in the 1980s Southern Californian [[cowpunk]] scene with bands like [[the Long Ryders]] and [[Mojo Nixon]].\n\nDuring the fifth generation (1990s), country music became a worldwide phenomenon. Two types of artists enjoyed mainstream popularity: neotraditionalists such as [[Alan Jackson]], and the more broadly popular [[stadium rock|stadium country]] acts, in particular [[Garth Brooks]]. The [[Dixie Chicks]] became one of the most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThe sixth generation (2000s\u2013present) has seen a certain amount of diversification in regard to country music styles. The influence of [[rock music]] in country has become more overt during the late 2000s and early 2010s.

Cowgirls contributed to the sound in various family groups. [[Patsy Montana]] opened the door for female artists with her history-making song \"I Want To Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\". This would begin a movement toward opportunities for women to have successful solo careers. [[Bob Wills]] was another country musician from the Lower [[Great Plains]] who had become very popular as the leader of a \"[[Dixieland|hot]] [[string band]],\" and who also appeared in [[Western (genre)|Hollywood westerns]]. His mix of country and [[jazz]], which started out as dance hall music, would become known as [[Western swing]]. [[Cliff Bruner]], [[Moon Mullican]], [[Milton Brown]] and [[Adolph Hofner]] were other early Western swing pioneers. [[Spade Cooley]] and [[Tex Williams]] also had very popular bands and appeared in films. At its height, Western swing rivaled the popularity of [[big band]] swing music.\n\n===Changing instrumentation===\nDrums were scorned by early country musicians as being \"too loud\" and \"not pure\", but by 1935 Western swing big band leader Bob Wills had added drums to the [[Texas Playboys]]. In the mid-1940s, the Grand Ole Opry did not want the Playboys' drummer to appear on stage.

Only a handful of folk artists, such as [[Burl Ives]], [[John Denver]] and Canadian musician [[Gordon Lightfoot]], would cross over into country music after the folk revival died out. During the mid-1950s a new style of country music became popular, eventually to be referred to as rockabilly.<ref>{{cite book| last = Morrison| first = Craig| title = Go Cat Go!: Rockabilly Music and Its Makers| date = 1996-09-01| publisher = University of Illinois Press| isbn = 978-0-252-02207-4| page = 28 }}</ref>\n\nThe music of the 1960s and 1970s targeted the American working class, and [[History of the trucking industry in the United States|truckers]] in particular. As country radio became more popular, trucking songs like the 1963 hit song ''Six Days on the Road'' by [[Dave Dudley]] began to make up their own subgenre of country. These revamped songs sought to portray American truckers as a \"new folk hero\", marking a significant shift in sound from earlier country music. The song was written by actual truckers and contained numerous references to the trucker culture of the time like \"ICC\" for [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] and \"little white pills\" as a reference to [[amphetamines]].

By the mid-1960s, the genre had developed into [[countrypolitan]]. Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets, and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s.

Influenced by one-time West Coast residents [[Bob Wills]] and [[Lefty Frizzell]], by 1966 it was known as the [[Bakersfield sound]].

Relegated to the \"country and Western\" genre by marketing agencies, popular Western recording stars released albums to only moderate success.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Rock-and-roll artists got hit songs, but Western artists also got country hits.

Waylon and I had that outlaw image going, and when it caught on at colleges and we started selling records, we were O.K.

Although the term first referred to country music songs and artists that crossed over to top 40 radio, country pop acts are now more likely to cross over to [[adult contemporary music]]. It started with pop music singers like [[Glen Campbell]], [[Bobbie Gentry]], [[John Denver]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Anne Murray]], [[B. J. Thomas]], [[The Bellamy Brothers]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]] having hits on the country charts. Between 1972 and 1975, singer/guitarist John Denver released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles (\"[[Rocky Mountain High]]\", \"[[Sunshine on My Shoulders]]\", \"[[Annie's Song]]\", \"[[Thank God I'm a Country Boy]]\", and \"[[I'm Sorry (John Denver song)|I'm Sorry]]\"), and was named Country Music Entertainer of the Year in 1975. The year before, Olivia Newton-John, an Australian pop singer, won the \"Best Female Country Vocal Performance\" as well as the Country Music Association's most coveted award for females, \"Female Vocalist of the Year\". In response George Jones, Tammy Wynette, [[Jean Shepard]] and other traditional Nashville country artists dissatisfied with the new trend formed the short-lived \"Association of Country Entertainers\" in 1974; the ACE soon unraveled in the wake of Jones and Wynette's bitter divorce and Shepard's realization that most others in the industry lacked her passion for the movement.\n[[File:Dolly Parton, 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Dolly Parton]]]]\n\nDuring the mid-1970s, [[Dolly Parton]], a successful mainstream country artist since the late 1960s, mounted a high-profile campaign to cross over to pop music, culminating in her 1977 hit \"[[Here You Come Again]]\", which topped the U.S. country singles chart, and also reached No. 3 on the pop singles charts. Parton's male counterpart, [[Kenny Rogers]], came from the opposite direction, aiming his music at the country charts, after a successful career in pop, rock and folk music with [[Kenny Rogers and the First Edition|The First Edition]], achieving success the same year with \"[[Lucille (Kenny Rogers song)|Lucille]]\", which topped the country charts and reached No. 5 on the U.S. pop singles charts, as well as reaching Number 1 on the British all-genre chart. Parton and Rogers would both continue to have success on both country and pop charts simultaneously, well into the 1980s. Artists like [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Ronnie Milsap]] and [[Barbara Mandrell]] would also find success on the pop charts with their records. In 1975, author Paul Hemphill stated in the ''Saturday Evening Post'', \"Country music isn't really country anymore; it is a hybrid of nearly every form of popular music in America.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hemphill | first1 = Paul | year = 1975 | title = Nashville\u2014Where It All Started | url = | journal = Saturday Evening Post | volume = 247 | issue = 3| pages = 44\u201386 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1980s, country artists continued to see their records perform well on the pop charts. [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Juice Newton]] each had two songs in the top 5 of the Billboard Hot 100 in the early eighties: Nelson charted \"[[Always on My Mind]]\" (No. 5, 1982) and \"[[To All the Girls I've Loved Before]]\" (No. 5, 1984, a duet with [[Julio Iglesias]]), and Newton achieved success with \"[[Queen of Hearts (Hank DeVito song)|Queen of Hearts]]\" (No. 2, 1981) and \"[[Angel of the Morning]]\" (No. 4, 1981). Four country songs topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in the 1980s: \"[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]\" by [[Kenny Rogers]], from the late fall of 1980; \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\" by [[Dolly Parton]], \"[[I Love a Rainy Night]]\" by [[Eddie Rabbitt]] (these two back-to-back at the top in early 1981); and \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\", a duet by Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers in 1983, a pop-country crossover hit written by Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb of the [[Bee Gees]].

The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the [[British Invasion]], many desired a return to the \"old values\" of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as [[country rock]]. Early innovators in this new style of music in the 1960s and 1970s included [[Bob Dylan]], who was the first to revert to country music with his 1967 album ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]''{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 54}} (and even more so with that album's follow-up, ''[[Nashville Skyline]]''), followed by [[Gene Clark]], Clark's former band [[The Byrds]] (with [[Gram Parsons]] on ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'') and its spin-off [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] (also featuring Gram Parsons), guitarist [[Clarence White]], [[Michael Nesmith]] ([[The Monkees]] and the [[First National Band]]), the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Neil Young]], [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen|Commander Cody]], [[The Allman Brothers]], [[The Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Poco]], [[Buffalo Springfield]], and [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], among many, even the former folk music duo [[Ian & Sylvia]], who formed [[Great Speckled Bird (band)|Great Speckled Bird]] in 1969.

Many of the artists during the latter half of the 1980s drew on traditional honky-tonk, bluegrass, folk and western swing. Artists who typified this sound included [[Travis Tritt]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[George Strait]], [[Keith Whitley]], [[Alan Jackson]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Patty Loveless]], [[Kathy Mattea]], [[Randy Travis]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], and [[The Judds]].\n\nBeginning in 1989, a confluence of events brought an unprecedented commercial boom to country music. The arrival of exceptionally talented artists coincided with new marketing strategies to engage fans, technology that more accurately tracked the popularity of country music, and a political and economic climate that focused attention on the genre. [[Garth Brooks]] (\"Friends in Low Places\") in particular attracted fans with his fusion of neotraditionalist country and [[arena rock|stadium rock]]. Other artists such as [[Brooks and Dunn]] (\"Boot Scootin' Boogie\") also combined conventional country with slick, rock elements, while [[Lorrie Morgan]], [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], and [[Kathy Mattea]] updated neotraditionalist styles.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Neal|first1=Jocelyn R.|title=Country Music|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2224075|website=Oxford music online}}</ref>\n\n==Fifth generation (1990s)==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Garth Brooks at We Are One (edit).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Garth Brooks]]]]\n{{See also|1990s_in_music#Country_music|l1=1990s in music \u00a7 Country}}\n\nCountry music was aided by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) Docket 80\u201390, which led to a significant expansion of [[FM radio]] in the 1980s by adding numerous higher-fidelity FM signals to rural and suburban areas. At this point, country music was mainly heard on rural [[AM radio]] stations; the expansion of FM was particularly helpful to country music, which migrated to FM from the AM band as AM became overcome by [[talk radio]] (the country music stations that stayed on AM developed the [[classic country]] format for the AM audience). At the same time, [[beautiful music]] stations already in rural areas began abandoning the format (leading to its effective demise) to adopt country music as well. This wider availability of country music led to producers seeking to polish their product for a wider audience. In 1990, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', which had published a [[Hot Country Songs|country music chart]] since the 1940s, changed the methodology it used to compile the chart: singles sales were removed from the methodology, and only airplay on [[country radio]] determined a song's place on the chart.<ref>{{cite journal|title=R&B Enjoying Rare Dominance Over Rap|journal=Billboard|date=24 April 2004|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mxAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68&dq=Nielsen+Broadcast+Data+Systems+january+20+1990&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje0deb39XaAhVQy1MKHUCXALUQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Nielsen%20Broadcast%20Data%20Systems%20january%2020%201990&f=false|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, country music became a worldwide phenomenon thanks to [[Garth Brooks]],<ref name=\"Country Worldwide\">{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0LYxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_OIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1510,3298161&dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&hl=en |title=Country is No. 1 musical style |date=1992-08-19 |publisher=Reading Eagle |accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref><ref name=\"Country Worldwide2\">{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TjQfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=B88EAAAAIBAJ&pg=4760,3698051&dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&hl=en |title=Country music reflects the time |date=1992-09-27 |publisher=Herald-Journal |accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref><ref name=\"Country Worldwide3\">{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/504338431.html?dids=504338431:504338431&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+25%2C+1993&author=Jack+Hurst&pub=The+Record&desc=Country+music+is+making+waves+across+the+seas&pqatl=google |title=Country music is making waves across the seas |date=1993-11-25 |publisher=thestar.com |accessdate=2010-07-26 | first=Jack | last=Hurst}}</ref> who enjoyed one of the most successful careers in popular music history, breaking records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the decade.

After their third album, ''[[Home (Dixie Chicks album)|Home]]'', was released in 2003, the band made political news in part because of lead singer [[Natalie Maines]]'s comments disparaging then-President [[George W. Bush]] while the band was overseas (Maines stated that she and her bandmates were ashamed to be from the same state as Bush, who had just commenced the [[Iraq War]] a few days prior). The comments caused a rift between the band and the country music scene, and the band's fourth (and most recent) album, 2006's ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'', took a more rock-oriented direction; the album was commercially successful overall but largely ignored among country audiences{{Citation needed|reason=Who else would have bought it except the country audience?|date=December 2016}}.

The album became a major worldwide phenomenon and became one of the world's best selling albums of 1998, 1999 and 2000; it also went on to become the best selling country album of all time. \nUnlike the majority of her contemporaries, Twain enjoyed large international success that had been seen by very few country artists, before or after her. Critics have noted that Twain enjoyed much of her success due to breaking free of traditional country stereotypes and for incorporating elements of rock and pop into her music. In 2002, she released her successful fourth studio album, titled ''[[Up! (album)|Up!]]'', which was certified 11x platinum and sold over 15 million copies worldwide. Twain has been credited with breaking international boundaries for country music, as well as inspiring many country artists to incorporate different genres into their music in order to attract a wider audience. She is also credited with changing the way in which many female country performers would market themselves, as unlike many before her she used fashion and her sex appeal to get rid of the stereotypical '[[honky-tonk]]' image the majority of country singers had in order to distinguish herself from many female country artists of the time.\n\n===Line dancing revival===\nIn the early-mid-1990s, country western music was influenced by the popularity of [[line dancing]]. This influence was so great that [[Chet Atkins]] was quoted as saying, \"The music has gotten pretty bad, I think. It's all that damn line dancing.\"<ref>The Roots of Country Music\" Collectors Edition by ''Life'', September 1, 1994</ref> By the end of the decade, however, at least one line dance choreographer complained that good country line dance music was no longer being released. In contrast, artists such as [[Don Williams]] and [[George Jones]] who had more or less had consistent chart success through the 1970s and 1980s suddenly had their fortunes fall rapidly around 1991 when the new chart rules took effect.\n\n===Alt-country/Americana===\n{{Main|Alt country|cowpunk}}\n\n[[File:WilcoFIB.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[Wilco]] performing in Spain in 2007]]\n\nCountry influences combined with [[Punk rock]] and [[alternative rock]] to forge the \"[[cowpunk]]\" scene in Southern California during the 1980s, which included bands such as [[The Long Ryders]], [[Lone Justice]] and [[The Beat Farmers]], as well as the established punk group [[X (American band)|X]], whose music had begun to include country and rockabilly influences.<ref name=\"Malone2002\">W.

Underwood's debut album, ''[[Some Hearts (Carrie Underwood album)|Some Hearts]]'', became the best-selling solo female debut album in country music history, the fastest-selling debut country album in the history of the SoundScan era and the best-selling country album of the last 10 years, being ranked by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as the #1 Country Album of the 2000\u20132009 decade. She has also become the female country artist with the most number one hits on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in the Nielsen SoundScan era (1991\u2013present), having 14 No. 1s and breaking her own ''[[Guinness Book]]'' record of ten. In 2007, Underwood won the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]], becoming only the second Country artist in history (and the first in a decade) to win it. She also made history by becoming the seventh woman to win Entertainer of the Year at the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], and the first woman in history to win the award twice, as well as twice consecutively. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' has listed Underwood as one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]].\nIn 2016, Underwood topped the [[Country Airplay]] chart for the 15th time, becoming the female artist with most number ones on that chart.\n\n[[Carrie Underwood]] was one of several country stars produced by a television series in the 2000s. In addition to Underwood, ''American Idol'' launched the careers of [[Kellie Pickler]], [[Josh Gracin]], [[Bucky Covington]], [[Kristy Lee Cook]], [[Danny Gokey]], [[Lauren Alaina]] and [[Scotty McCreery]] (as well as that of occasional country singer [[Kelly Clarkson]]) in the decade, and would continue to launch country careers in the 2010s. The series ''[[Nashville Star]]'', while not nearly as successful as ''Idol'', did manage to bring [[Miranda Lambert]], [[Kacey Musgraves]] and [[Chris Young (musician)|Chris Young]] to mainstream success, also launching the careers of lower-profile musicians such as [[Buddy Jewell]], [[Sean Patrick McGraw]], and Canadian musician [[George Canyon]]. ''[[Can You Duet]]?'' produced the duos [[Steel Magnolia]] and [[Joey + Rory]]. Teen sitcoms also have influenced modern country music; in 2008, actress [[Jennette McCurdy]] (best known as the sidekick Sam on the teen sitcom ''[[iCarly]]'') released her first single, \"So Close\", following that with the single \"[[Generation Love]]\" in 2011. Another teen sitcom star, [[Miley Cyrus]] (of ''[[Hannah Montana]]''), also had a crossover hit in the late 2000s with \"[[The Climb (Miley Cyrus song)|The Climb]]\" and another with a duet with her father, [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], with \"[[Ready, Set, Don't Go]].\" [[Jana Kramer]], an actress in the teen drama ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', released a country album in 2012 that has produced two hit singles as of 2013.

Swift first became widely known in 2006 when her debut single, \"[[Tim McGraw (song)|Tim McGraw]],\" was released when Swift was only 16. In 2006, Taylor released her first studio album, ''[[Taylor Swift (album)|Taylor Swift]]'', which spent 275 weeks on Billboard 200, one of the longest runs of any album on that chart. In 2008, Taylor Swift released her second studio album, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'', which made her the second-longest Number One charted on Billboard 200 and the second best-selling album (just behind [[Adele]]'s ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'') within the past 5 years. At the 2010 Grammys, Taylor Swift was 20 and won Album of the Year for ''Fearless'', which made her the youngest artist to win this award. Swift has received ten Grammys already. Buoyed by her [[teen idol]] status among girls and a change in the methodology of compiling the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts to favor pop-crossover songs, Swift's 2012 single \"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\" spent the most weeks at the top of Billboard's [[Hot Country Songs]] chart of any song in nearly five decades.  The song's long run at the top of the chart was somewhat controversial, as the song is largely a pop song without much country influence and its success on the charts driven by a change to the chart's criteria to include airplay on non-country radio stations, prompting disputes over what constitutes a country song; many of Swift's later releases, such as \"[[Shake It Off (Taylor Swift song)|Shake It Off]],\" were released solely to pop audiences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/6228999/taylor-swift-country-music-split |title=Are Taylor Swift and Country Splitting Up for Good? |author= Jem Aswad |date= August 22, 2014 |work=Billboard }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/taylor-swift-country-pop-transformation-20140909 |title=Trace Taylor Swift's Country-to-Pop Transformation in 5 Song |author= Keith Harris |date=September 9, 2014 |work=Rolling Stone }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/08/18/taylor-swift-shakes-off-country-with-first-pop-album-1989/14256849/ |title=Taylor Swift shakes off country with first pop album |author=Patrick Ryan and Brian Mansfield |work= USA TODAY |date= August 18, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001 and the economic recession helped move country music back into the spotlight.

Alt-Country singer Ryan Adams song \"[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]\" pays tribute to New York City, and its popular music video (which was shot 4 days before the attacks) shows Adams playing in front of the Manhattan skyline, Along with several shots of the city.

Country and Western music never really developed separately in Canada; however, after its introduction to Canada, following the spread of radio, it developed quite quickly out of the Atlantic Canadian traditional scene. While true Atlantic Canadian traditional music is very Celtic or \"[[sea shanty]]\" in nature, even today, the lines have often been blurred. Certain areas often are viewed as embracing one strain or the other more openly. For example, in Newfoundland the traditional music remains unique and [[Music of Ireland|Irish]] in nature, whereas traditional musicians in other parts of the region may play both genres interchangeably.\n\n''[[Don Messer's Jubilee]]'' was a [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]-based country/folk variety television show that was broadcast nationally from 1957 to 1969. In Canada it out-performed ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' broadcast from the United States and became the top-rated television show throughout much of the 1960s. ''Don Messer's Jubilee'' followed a consistent format throughout its years, beginning with a tune named \"Goin' to the Barndance Tonight\", followed by fiddle tunes by Messer, songs from some of his \"Islanders\" including singers [[Marg Osburne]] and [[Charlie Chamberlain]], the featured guest performance, and a closing hymn. It ended with \"[[Till We Meet Again (1918 song)|Till We Meet Again]]\".\n\nThe guest performance slot gave national exposure to numerous Canadian folk musicians, including [[Stompin' Tom Connors]] and [[Catherine McKinnon]]. Some Maritime country performers went on to further fame beyond Canada. [[Hank Snow]], [[Wilf Carter (musician)|Wilf Carter]] (also known as Montana Slim), and [[Anne Murray]] are the three most notable.\n\nThe cancellation of the show by the public broadcaster in 1969 caused a nationwide protest, including the raising of questions in the Parliament of Canada.\n\nThe Prairie provinces, due to their western cowboy and agrarian nature, are the true heartland of Canadian country music.<ref name=\"book\"/> While the Prairies never developed a traditional music culture anything like the Maritimes, the folk music of the Prairies often reflected the cultural origins of the settlers, who were a mix of [[Scottish Canadian|Scottish]], [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainian]], [[Canadians of German ethnicity|German]] and others. For these reasons [[polka]]s and Western music were always popular in the region, and with the introduction of the radio, mainstream country music flourished. As the culture of the region is western and frontier in nature, the specific genre of country and western is more popular today in the Prairies than in any other part of the country. No other area of the country embraces all aspects of the culture, from two-step dancing, to the cowboy dress, to rodeos, to the music itself, like the Prairies do. The Atlantic Provinces, on the other hand, produce far more traditional musicians, but they are not usually specifically country in nature, usually bordering more on the [[Folk music|folk]] or [[Celtic music|Celtic]] genres.<ref name=\"book\"/>\n\nMany traditional country artists are present in eastern and western Canada. They make common use of fiddle and pedal steel guitar styles. Some notable Canadian country artists include [[Shania Twain]], [[Anne Murray]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[George Canyon]], [[Blue Rodeo]], [[Tommy Hunter]], [[Rita MacNeil]], [[Stompin' Tom Connors]], [[Stan Rogers]], [[Ronnie Prophet]], [[Carroll Baker (singer)|Carroll Baker]], [[The Rankin Family]], [[Ian Tyson]], [[Johnny Reid]], [[Paul Brandt]], [[Jason McCoy]], [[George Fox (singer)|George Fox]], [[Carolyn Dawn Johnson]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Don Messer]], [[Wilf Carter (musician)|Wilf Carter]], [[Michelle Wright]], [[Terri Clark]], [[Prairie Oyster]], [[Family Brown]], [[Johnny Mooring]], [[Marg Osburne]], [[Lindsay Ell]], [[Doc Walker]], [[Emerson Drive]], [[The Wilkinsons]], [[Corb Lund and the Hurtin' Albertans]], [[Crystal Shawanda]], [[Dean Brody]], [[Shane Yellowbird]], [[Gord Bamford]], [[Chad Brownlee]], [[The Road Hammers]], Rowdy Spurs, [[Colter Wall]] and [[The Higgins]].\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main|Australian country music}}\n[[File:Olivia Newton-John Sydney 2008.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|left|[[Olivia Newton-John]] singing in [[Sydney]] in 2008]]\n\n[[Australian country music]] has a long tradition. Influenced by American country music, it has developed a distinct style, shaped by British and Irish folk ballads and Australian [[bush ballad]]eers like [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]]. Country instruments, including the guitar, [[banjo]], [[fiddle]] and harmonica, create the distinctive sound of country music in Australia and accompany songs with strong storyline and memorable chorus.\n\nFolk songs sung in Australia between the 1780s and 1920s, based around such themes as the struggle against government [[tyranny]], or the lives of [[bushranger]]s, [[swagmen]], [[Drover (Australian)|drovers]], [[Stockman (Australia)|stockmen]] and [[sheep shearer|shearers]], continue to influence the genre. This strain of Australian country, with lyrics focusing on Australian subjects, is generally known as \"bush music\" or \"[[bush band]] music\". \"[[Waltzing Matilda]]\", often regarded as Australia's unofficial [[national anthem]], is a quintessential Australian country song, influenced more by British and Irish folk ballads than by American country and western music. The lyrics were composed by the poet Banjo Paterson in 1895.

Author Andrew Smith delivers a through research and engaged view of Tex Morton's life and his impact on the country music scene in Australia in the 1930s and 1940s. Other early stars included [[Buddy Williams (country musician)|Buddy Williams]], [[Shirley Thoms]] and [[Smoky Dawson]]. Buddy Williams (1918\u20131986) was the first Australian-born to record country music in Australia in the late 1930s and was the pioneer of a distinctly Australian style of country music called the bush ballad that others such as Slim Dusty would make popular in later years. During the Second World War, many of Buddy Williams recording sessions were done whilst on leave from the Army. At the end of the war, Williams would go on to operate some of the largest travelling tent rodeo shows Australia has ever seen.\n\nIn 1952, Dawson began a radio show and went on to national stardom as a singing cowboy of radio, TV and film. [[Slim Dusty]] (1927\u20132003) was known as the \"King of Australian Country Music\" and helped to popularise the Australian [[bush ballad]]. His successful career spanned almost six decades, and his 1957 hit \"[[A Pub with No Beer]]\" was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time, and with over seven million record sales in Australia he is the most successful artist in Australian musical history.<ref name=\"Guardian-obit\">Dave\" Laing, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/20/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries \"Slim Dusty: Country singer famous for A Pub With No Beer\"], ''The Guardian (UK)'', 20 September 2003</ref> Dusty recorded and released his one-hundredth album in the year 2000 and was given the honour of singing \"[[Waltzing Matilda]]\" in the closing ceremony of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games]].

Though, there have been exceptions such as [[Garth Brooks]] and [[Shania Twain]] in the '90s (particularly the latter) and Taylor Swift, [[Carrie Underwood]], [[Lady Antebellum]] and the Dixie Chicks in the 2000s. Crossover hits (in terms of singles and albums) within the country genre are few and far between and have been since the '80s. There are some [[British country music]] acts and publications. Although radio stations devoted to country are among the most popular in other Anglophone nations, none of the top 10 [[List of most-listened-to radio programs|most-listened-to stations in the UK]] are country stations, and national broadcaster [[BBC Radio]] does not offer a full-time country station ([[BBC Radio 2 Country]], a \"pop-up\" station, operated four days each year between 2015 and 2017).

The shows were later taken into Europe, and featured such stars as [[Johnny Cash]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Tammy Wynette]], [[David Allan Coe]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Boxcar Willie]], [[Johnny Russell (singer)|Johnny Russell]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]. A handful of country musicians had even greater success in mainstream UK music than they did in the US, despite a certain amount of disdain from the music press. The UK's largest music festival [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] has featured major US country acts in recent years, such as [[Kenny Rogers]] in 2013 and Dolly Parton in 2014.\n\nFrom within the UK, few country musicians achieved widespread mainstream success. [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], by this point near the end of his peak success as a pop singer, had a string of country hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In 2013, Tyler returned to her roots, blending the country elements of her early work with the rock of her successful material on her album ''[[Rocks and Honey]]'' which featured a duet with American country icon [[Vince Gill]].

Over the past ten years country and gospel recording artist [[James Kilbane]] has reached multi-platinum success with his mix of [[contemporary Christian music|Christian]] and traditional country influenced albums. James Kilbane like many other Irish artists are today working closer with Nashville. A recent success in the Irish arena has been [[Crystal Swing]].

In 1994, the group had a worldwide hit with their version of the traditional Southern tune \"[[Cotton-Eyed Joe]]\". Artists popularizing more traditional country music in Sweden have been [[Ann-Louise Hanson]], [[Hasse Andersson]], [[Kikki Danielsson]], [[Elisabeth Andreassen]] and [[Jill Johnson]]. In [[Poland]] an international country music festival, known as [[Piknik Country]], has been organized in [[Mr\u0105gowo]] in [[Masuria]] since 1983. There are more and more country music artists in France. Some of the most important are [[Liane Edwards]], {{ill|Annabel (singer)|lt=Annabel|fr|Annabel|vertical-align=sup}}, Rockie Mountains, Tahiana, and Lili West.

In 2000, after it and CMT fell under the same corporate ownership, the channel was stripped of its country format and rebranded as ''The National Network'', then ''Spike'', and finally [[Paramount Network]]. TNN was later revived from 2012 to 2013 after Jim Owens Entertainment (the company responsible for prominent TNN hosts [[Crook & Chase]]) acquired the trademark and licensed it to Luken Communications; that channel renamed itself Heartland after Luken was embroiled in an unrelated dispute that left the company bankrupt.\n\n===Canadian television===\nOnly one television channel was dedicated to country music in Canada: [[CMT (Canada)|CMT]] owned by [[Corus Entertainment]] (90%) and Viacom (10%). However, the lifting of strict genre licensing restrictions saw the network remove the last of its music programming at the end of August 2017 for a schedule of generic off-network family sitcoms, [[Canadian content|Cancom]]-compliant lifestyle programming, and reality programming. In the past, the current-day [[Cottage Life (TV channel)|Cottage Life]] network saw some country focus as Country Canada and later, CBC Country Canada before that network drifted into an alternate network for overflow CBC content as Bold.

The [[Origins of the Cold War|Cold War emerged in Europe]] a few years after the successful US\u2013USSR\u2013UK coalition won [[World War II]] in Europe, and extended to 1989\u201391. In 1947, [[Bernard Baruch]], the multimillionaire financier and adviser to presidents from Woodrow Wilson to Harry S. Truman, coined the term \u201cCold War\u201d to describe the increasingly chilly relations between two World War II Allies: the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nSome conflicts between the West and the USSR appeared earlier. In 1945\u201346 the US and UK strongly protested Soviet political takeover efforts in Eastern Europe and [[Iran crisis of 1946|Iran]], while the hunt for Soviet spies made the tensions more visible.  However historians emphasize the decisive break between the US\u2013UK and the USSR came in 1947\u201348 over such issues as the [[Truman Doctrine]], the [[Marshall Plan]] and the [[Berlin Blockade]], followed by the formation of [[NATO]] in 1949.{{dubious|date=January 2018}}The Cold War took place worldwide, but it had a partially different timing  outside Europe.<ref name=\"Westad2017\"/>\n\n==Creation of the Eastern Bloc==\n{{Main|Eastern Bloc}}\n[[File:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|left|thumb|267px]]\nDuring [[World War II]], the Soviet Union annexed several countries as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] within the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]].

Communist parties had already come to power in [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Albania]], and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

The resulting [[Morgenthau plan]] policy foresaw returning Germany to a pastoral state without heavy industry. Because of the increasing costs of food imports to avoid mass-starvation in Germany, and with the danger of losing the entire nation to communism, the U.S. government abandoned the Morgenthau plan in September 1946 with [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James F.

Stalin had respected the \"[[percentages agreement]]\" with Winston Churchill to not intervene, but Yugoslavia and Albania defied the USSR's policy and sent supplies during the [[Greek Civil War]] to the army of the [[Communist Party of Greece]], the [[Democratic Army of Greece|DSE]] (Democratic Army of Greece). The UK had given aid to the royalist Greek forces, leaving the Communists (without Soviet aid and having boycotted the elections)  at a disadvantaged position. However, by 1947, the near-bankrupt British government could no longer maintain its massive overseas commitments. In addition to granting [[Partition of India|independence to India]] and handing back the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Palestinian Mandate]] to the [[United Nations]], the British government decided to withdraw from both Greece and nearby Turkey. This would have left the two nations, in particular Greece, on the brink of a communist-led revolution.\n\nNotified that British aid to Greece and Turkey would end in less than six weeks, and already hostile towards and suspicious of Soviet intentions, because of their [[Iran crisis of 1946|reluctance to withdraw from Iran]], the Truman administration decided that additional action was necessary.  With [[United States Congress|Congress]] solidly in [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] hands, and with [[isolationism|isolationist]] sentiment strong among the U.S. public, Truman adopted an ideological approach. In a meeting with congressional leaders, the argument of \"apples in a barrel infected by one rotten one\" was used to convince them of the significance in supporting Greece and Turkey. It was to become the \"[[domino theory]]\". On the morning of March 12, 1947, President [[Harry S. Truman]] appeared before Congress to ask for $400 million of aid to Greece and Turkey. Calling on congressional approval for the United States to \"support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures,\" or in short a policy of \"[[containment]]\", Truman articulated a presentation of the ideological struggle that became known as the \"Truman Doctrine.\" Although based on a simplistic analysis of internal strife in Greece and Turkey, it became the single dominating influence over U.S. policy until at least the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nTruman's speech had a tremendous effect. The anti-communist feelings that had just begun to hatch in the U.S. were given a great boost, and a silenced Congress voted overwhelmingly in approval of aid.

West Germany, Spain, Greece, and Turkey would later join this alliance. The Eastern leaders retaliated against these steps by integrating the economies of their nations in [[Comecon]], their version of the [[Marshall Plan]]; exploding the first Soviet [[nuclear weapon|atomic device]] in 1949; signing an alliance with [[People's Republic of China]] in February 1950; and forming the [[Warsaw Pact]], Eastern Europe's counterpart to NATO, in 1955. The Soviet Union, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland founded this military alliance.\n\n===NSC 68===\nU.S. officials quickly moved to escalate and expand \"containment.\" In a secret 1950 document, [[NSC 68]], they proposed to strengthen their alliance systems, quadruple defense spending, and embark on an elaborate propaganda campaign to convince the U.S. public to fight this costly cold war. Truman ordered the development of a [[hydrogen bomb]]. In early 1950, the U.S. took its first efforts to oppose communist forces in Vietnam; planned to form a West German army, and prepared proposals for a peace treaty with Japan that would guarantee long-term U.S. military bases there.\n\n==Outside Europe==\nThe Cold War took place worldwide, but it had a partially different timing and trajectory outside Europe.<ref name=\"Westad2017\">Odd Arne Westad, ''The Cold War: A World History'' (Penguin UK, 2017)  pp. 2\u20137.</ref>\n\nIn Africa, decolonization took place first; it was largely accomplished in the 1950s.

''The United States, Cuba, and the Cold War; American Failure Or Communist Conspiracy?''

The USSR had signed a Treaty of Friendship with the Kuomintang in 1945 and disavowed support for the Chinese Communists. The outcome was closely fought, with the Communists finally prevailing with superior military tactics. Although the Nationalists had an advantage in numbers of men and weapons, initially controlled a much larger territory and population than their adversaries, and enjoyed considerable international support, they were exhausted by the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|long war with Japan]] and the attendant internal responsibilities. In addition, the Chinese Communists were able to fill the political vacuum left in [[Manchuria]] after Soviet forces withdrew from the area and thus gained China's prime industrial base. The Chinese Communists were able to fight their way from the north and northeast, and virtually all of [[mainland China]] was taken by the end of 1949. On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). Chiang Kai-shek and 600,000 Nationalist troops and 2 million refugees, predominantly from the government and business community, fled from the mainland to the island of [[Taiwan]]. In December 1949, Chiang proclaimed [[Taipei]] the temporary capital of the Republic of China (ROC) and continued to assert his government as the sole legitimate authority in China.\n\nThe continued hostility between the Communists on the mainland and the Nationalists on Taiwan continued throughout the Cold War. Though the United States refused to aide Chiang Kai-shek in his hope to \"recover the mainland,\" it continued supporting the Republic of China with military supplies and expertise to prevent Taiwan from falling into PRC hands. Through the support of the Western bloc (most Western countries continued to recognize the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China), the Republic of China on Taiwan retained [[China and the United Nations|China's seat in the United Nations]] until 1971.\n\n==Korean War==\n[[File:Truman initiating Korean involvement.jpg|thumb|right|200px|President Truman signing a proclamation declaring a national emergency that initiates U.S. involvement in the Korean War.]]\n{{Main|Korean War}}\nIn early 1950, the United States made its first commitment to form a peace treaty with Japan that would guarantee long-term U.S. military bases. Some observers (including [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]]) believed that the Japanese treaty led Stalin to approve a plan to invade U.S.-supported [[South Korea]] on June 25, 1950. [[Korea]] had been divided at the end of World War II along the 38th parallel into Soviet and U.S. occupation zones, in which a communist government was installed in the [[North Korea|North]] by the Soviets, and an elected government in the South came to power after UN-supervised elections in 1948.\n\nIn June 1950, [[Kim Il-sung]]'s [[Korean People's Army|North Korean People's Army]] invaded South Korea.<ref name=\"Stokesbury1990\">{{cite book |title= A Short History of the Korean War|last=Stokesbury |first= James L|year= 1990|publisher=Harper Perennial |location= New York|isbn= 0-688-09513-5|page=14}}</ref>  Fearing that communist Korea under a Kim Il Sung dictatorship could threaten Japan  and foster other communist movements in Asia, Truman committed U.S. forces and obtained help from the [[United Nations]] to counter the North Korean invasion. The Soviets boycotted [[UN Security Council]] meetings while protesting the Council's failure to seat the [[People's Republic of China]] and, thus, did not veto the Council's approval of UN action to oppose the North Korean invasion. A joint UN force of personnel from South Korea, the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Turkey]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[France]], the [[Philippines]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[New Zealand]] and other countries joined to stop the invasion.<ref>Fehrenbach, T.

The 1951 children's film ''[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]]'' is a prime example.\n\nGeorge Orwell's classic dystopia [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] was published in 1949. The novel explores life in an imagined future world where a totalitarian government has achieved terrifying levels of power and control. With Nineteen Eighty-Four, Orwell taps into the anti-communist fears that would continue to haunt so many in the West for decades to come. In a Cold War setting his descriptions could hardly fail to evoke comparison to Soviet communism and the seeming willingness of Stalin and his successors to control those within the Soviet bloc by whatever means necessary. Orwell's famous allegory of totalitarian rule, [[Animal Farm]], published in 1945, provoked similar anti-communist sentiments.\n\n==Significant documents==\nThe Cold War generated innumerable documents.  The texts of 171 documents appear in ''The Encyclopedia of the Cold War'' (2008).<ref>Priscilla Mary Roberts, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of the Cold War:  A Political, Social, and Military History: Volume 5: Documents'' (2008).  isbn 978-1-85109-701-2</ref>\n*[[Baruch Plan]]: 1946. A proposal by the U.S. to the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission]] (UNAEC) to a) extend between all nations the exchange of basic scientific information for peaceful ends; b) implement control of atomic  energy to the extent necessary to ensure its use only for peaceful purposes; c) eliminate from national armaments atomic weapons and all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction; and d) establish effective safeguards by way of inspection and other means to protect complying States against the hazards of violations and evasions. When the Soviet Union was the only member state which refused to sign, the U.S. embarked on a massive nuclear weapons testing, development, and deployment program.\n*The Long Telegram and The \"[[X Article]]\", 1946\u20131947. Formally titled \"''The Sources of Soviet Conduct''\". The article describes the concepts that became the foundation of United States Cold War policy and was published in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' in 1947. The article was an expansion of a well-circulated top secret [[United States Department of State|State Department]] cable called the X Article and became famous for setting forth the doctrine of containment. Though the article was signed [[pseudonym]]ously by \"X,\" it was well known at the time that the true author was [[George F. Kennan]], the deputy chief of mission of the United States to the Soviet Union from 1944 to 1946, under [[ambassador]] [[W. Averell Harriman]].\n*[[NSC 68]]: April 14, 1950. A [[classified information|classified]] report written and issued by the [[United States National Security Council]]. The report outlined the [[National Security Strategy of the United States]] for that time and provided a comprehensive analysis of the capabilities of the Soviet Union and of the United States from military, economic, political, and psychological standpoints. NSC{{nbsp}}68's principal thesis was that the Soviet Union intended to become the single dominant world power. The report argued that the Soviet Union had a systematic strategy aimed at the spread of communism across the entire world, and it recommended that the United States government adopt a policy of containment to stop the further spread of Soviet power. NSC{{nbsp}}68 outlined a drastic [[foreign policy]] shift from defensive to active containment and advocated aggressive military preparedness. NSC{{nbsp}}68 shaped government actions in the Cold War for the next 20 years and has subsequently been labeled the \"blueprint\" for the Cold War.\n*Speech by [[James F. Byrnes]],  [[United States Secretary of State]] \"''[[Restatement of Policy on Germany]]''\" [[Stuttgart]] September 6, 1946.  Also known as the \"''Speech of hope,''\" it set the tone of future U.S. policy as it repudiated the [[Morgenthau Plan]] economic policies and gave the Germans hope for the future. The Western powers worst fear was that the poverty and hunger would drive the Germans to communism. General [[Lucius D. Clay|Lucius Clay]] stated \"There is no choice between being a communist on 1,500 calories a day and a believer in democracy on a thousand\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=aEzVNpVqENYC&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=%22There+is+no+choice+between+being+a+communist+on+1,500+calories+a+day+and+a+believer+in+democracy+on+a+thousand%22+-wikipedia&source=bl&ots=BLqGX6hvRq&sig=rhtHtmUCWyjw_4mh_6nMPORh0DA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwibqOKnqObaAhVMJpQKHYjYCTMQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&q=%22There+is+no+choice+between+being+a+communist+on+1,500+calories+a+day+and+a+believer+in+democracy+on+a+thousand%22+-wikipedia&f=false|title=The European Union|publisher=PediaPress|accessdate=2 May 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> The speech was also seen as a stand against the Soviet Union because it stated the firm intention of the United States to maintain a military presence in Europe indefinitely.

In its lightest form, crony capitalism consists of [[collusion]] among market players which is officially tolerated or encouraged by the government.

This is most common in natural resource sectors through the granting of mining or drilling concessions, but it is also possible through a process known as [[regulatory capture]] where the government agencies in charge of regulating an industry come to be controlled by that industry. Governments will often, in good faith, establish [[regulatory agency|government agencies to regulate an industry]]. However, the members of an industry have a very strong interest in the actions of that regulatory body, while the rest of the citizenry are only lightly affected.

This is sometimes called [[plutocracy]] (rule by wealth) or [[kleptocracy]] (rule by theft).\n\nCorrupt governments may favor one set of business owners who have close ties to the government over others.

In a developing country those hubs may be very few, thus concentrating economic and political power in a small interlocking group.\n\nNormally, this will be untenable to maintain in business; new entrants will affect the market.

according to which a [[State (polity)|state]] or other organization is governed.<ref>''The [[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'', Second Edn., [[Erin McKean]] (editor), 2051 pages, May 2005, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-517077-6}}.</ref> These rules together make up, i.e. ''constitute'', what the entity is. When these principles are written down into a single document or set of legal documents, those documents may be said to embody a ''written'' constitution; if they are written down in a single comprehensive document, it is said to embody a ''codified'' constitution. Some constitutions (such as the [[constitution of the United Kingdom]]) are uncodified, but written in numerous fundamental Acts of a legislature, court cases or treaties.<ref>''[[R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport]]'' [2014] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/3.html UKSC 3], [207]</ref>\n\nConstitutions concern different levels of organizations, from sovereign states to companies and unincorporated associations.

According to Scott Gordon, a political organization is constitutional to the extent that it \"contain[s] [[institution]]alized mechanisms of power control for the protection of the interests and [[Liberty|liberties]] of the [[citizenry]], including those that may be in the [[Minority group|minority]]\".<ref name=\"Gordon1999\">{{cite book |last=Gordon |first=Scott |title=Controlling the State: Constitutionalism from Ancient Athens to Today |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1999 |page=4 |isbn=0-674-16987-5}}</ref>\n\nActivities of officials within an organization or polity that fall within the constitutional or statutory authority of those officials are termed \"within power\" (or, in Latin, ''intra vires'');  if they do not, they are termed \"beyond power\" (or, in Latin, ''[[ultra vires]]'').  For example, a [[students' union]] may be prohibited as an organization from engaging in activities not concerning students;  if the union becomes involved in non-student activities, these activities are considered to be ''ultra vires'' of the union's charter, and nobody would be compelled by the charter to follow them. An example from the constitutional law of [[sovereign state]]s would be a provincial [[parliament]] in a [[federal state]] trying to legislate in an area that the constitution allocates  exclusively to the federal parliament, such as ratifying a treaty.  Action that appears to be beyond power may be [[judicial review|judicially reviewed]] and, if found to be beyond power, must cease.  Legislation that is found to be beyond power will be \"invalid\" and of no force;  this applies to primary legislation, requiring constitutional authorization, and secondary legislation, ordinarily requiring statutory authorization. In this context, \"within power\", ''intra vires'', \"authorized\" and \"valid\" have the same meaning;  as do \"beyond power\", ''ultra vires'', \"not authorized\" and \"invalid\".\n\nIn most but not all modern states the constitution has supremacy over ordinary [[statutory law]] (see [[#Uncodified constitution|Uncodified constitution]] below); in such states when an official act is unconstitutional, i.e. it is not a power granted to the government by the constitution, that act is ''null and void'', and the nullification is ''[[ab initio]]'', that is, from inception, not from the date of the finding. It was never \"law\", even though, if it had been a statute or statutory provision, it might have been adopted according to the procedures for adopting legislation. Sometimes the problem is not that a statute is unconstitutional, but the application of it is, on a particular occasion, and a court may decide that while there are ways it could be applied that are constitutional, that instance was not allowed or legitimate. In such a case, only the application may be ruled unconstitutional. Historically, the remedy for such violations have been petitions for common law [[writ]]s, such as ''[[quo warranto]]''.\n\n==History and development==\n\n===Pre-modern constitutions===\n====Ancient====\n[[File:Hammurabi.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail from [[Hammurabi]]'s [[stele]] shows him receiving the laws of [[Babylon]] from the seated [[sun deity]].]]\nExcavations in modern-day [[Iraq]] by [[Ernest de Sarzec]] in 1877 found evidence of the earliest known [[code of justice]], issued by the [[Sumer]]ian king [[Urukagina]] of [[Lagash]] ''ca'' 2300 BC. Perhaps the earliest prototype for a law of government, this document itself has not yet been discovered; however it is known that it allowed some rights to his citizens. For example, it is known that it relieved tax for widows and orphans, and protected the poor from the [[usury]] of the rich.\n\nAfter that, many [[Forms of government|governments]] ruled by special codes of written laws. The oldest such document still known to exist seems to be the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] of [[Ur]] (''ca'' 2050 BC). Some of the better-known ancient law codes include the code of [[Lipit-Ishtar]] of [[Isin]], the [[code of Hammurabi]] of [[Babylonia]], the [[Hittite laws|Hittite code]], the [[Assyrian law|Assyrian code]] and [[613 Commandments|Mosaic law]].\n\nIn 621 BC, a scribe named [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]] codified the cruel oral laws of the [[city-state]] of [[Athens]]; this code prescribed the [[death penalty]] for many offences (nowadays very severe rules are often called \"Draconian\"). In 594 BC, [[Solon]], the ruler of Athens, created the new ''[[Solonian Constitution]]''. It eased the burden of the workers, and [[Determinacy|determined]] that membership of the ruling class was to be based on wealth ([[plutocracy]]), rather than by birth ([[aristocracy]]). [[Cleisthenes of Athens|Cleisthenes]] again reformed the Athenian constitution and set it on a democratic footing in 508 BC.\n\n[[File:Aristotle's constitutions diagram.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Diagram illustrating the classification of constitutions by [[Aristotle]].]]\n[[Aristotle]] (''ca'' 350 BC) was the first to make a formal distinction between ordinary law and constitutional law, establishing ideas of constitution and [[constitutionalism]], and attempting to classify different forms of constitutional government. The most basic definition he used to describe a constitution in general terms was \"the arrangement of the offices in a state\". In his works ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of Athens]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', and ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' he explores different constitutions of his day, including those of Athens, [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Sparta]], and [[Carthage]]. He classified both what he regarded as good and what he regarded as bad constitutions, and came to the conclusion that the best constitution was a mixed system, including monarchic, aristocratic, and democratic elements. He also distinguished between citizens, who had the right to participate in the state, and non-citizens and slaves, who did not.\n\nThe Romans first codified their constitution in 450 BC as the ''[[Twelve Tables]]''. They operated under a series of laws that were added from time to time, but [[Roman law]] was never reorganised into a single code until the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'' (AD 438); later, in the Eastern Empire the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex repetit\u00e6 pr\u00e6lectionis]]'' (534) was highly influential throughout Europe. This was followed in the east by the ''Ecloga'' of [[Leo III the Isaurian]] (740) and the ''Basilica'' of [[Basil I]] (878).\n\nThe ''[[Edicts of Ashoka]]'' established constitutional principles for the 3rd century BC [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] king's rule in [[History of India|Ancient India]]. For constitutional principles almost lost to antiquity, see the [[code of Manu]].\n\n====Early Middle ages====\n\nMany of the Germanic people that filled the power vacuum left by the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]] codified their laws. One of the first of these [[Germanic tribal laws|Germanic law codes]] to be written was the Visigothic ''Code of [[Euric]]'' (471). This was followed by the ''[[Lex Burgundionum]]'', applying separate codes for Germans and for Romans; the ''[[Lex Alamannorum|Pactus Alamannorum]]''; and the [[Salic Law]] of the [[Franks]], all written soon after 500. In 506, the ''[[Breviary of Alaric|Breviarum]]'' or ''\"Lex Romana\"'' of [[Alaric II]], king of the Visigoths, adopted and consolidated the ''Codex Theodosianus'' together with assorted earlier Roman laws. Systems that appeared somewhat later include the ''[[Edictum Rothari]]'' of the [[Lombards]] (643), the ''[[Lex Visigothorum]]'' (654), the ''Lex Alamannorum'' (730) and the ''[[Lex Frisionum]]'' (''ca'' 785). These continental codes were all composed in Latin, while [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] was used for those of England, beginning with the Code of [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent]] (602). In ca. 893, [[Alfred the Great]] combined this and two other earlier Saxon codes, with various Mosaic and Christian precepts, to produce the ''[[Doom book]]'' code of laws for England.\n\n[[Japan]]'s ''[[Seventeen-article constitution]]'' written in 604, reportedly by [[Prince Shotoku|Prince Sh\u014dtoku]], is an early example of a constitution in Asian political history. Influenced by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings, the document focuses more on social morality than institutions of government ''per se'' and remains a notable early attempt at a government constitution.\n\nThe [[Constitution of Medina]] ({{lang-ar|\u0635\u062d\u06cc\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u06cc\u0646\u0647}}, \u1e62a\u1e25\u012bfat al-Mad\u012bna), also known as the Charter of Medina, was drafted by the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] after his flight ([[Hegira|hijra]]) to Yathrib where he became political leader. It constituted a formal agreement between Muhammad and all of the significant tribes and families of Yathrib (later known as [[Medina]]), including [[Muslim]]s, [[Jew]]s, and [[pagan]]s.<ref>See:\n* Reuven Firestone, ''Jih\u0101d: the origin of holy war in Islam'' (1999) p. 118;\n* \"Muhammad\", ''Encyclopedia of Islam Online''</ref><ref>Watt.

Serjeant argues that the constitution is in fact 8 different treaties which can be dated according to events as they transpired in Medina with the first treaty being written shortly after Muhammad's arrival.

Wellhausen argues that it belongs to the first year of Muhammad's residence in Medina, before the battle of Badr in 2/624. Wellhausen bases this judgement on three considerations; first Muhammad is very diffident about his own position, he accepts the Pagan tribes within the Umma, and maintains the Jewish clans as clients of the Ansars see Wellhausen, Excursus, p. 158. Even Moshe Gil a skeptic of Islamic history argues that it was written within 5 months of Muhammad's arrival in Medina.

It survived only in later editions of the 15th century.\n\nIn [[England]], [[Henry I of England|Henry I's]] proclamation of the [[Charter of Liberties]] in 1100 bound the king for the first time in his treatment of the clergy and the nobility. This idea was extended and refined by the English barony when they forced [[John of England|King John]] to sign ''[[Magna Carta]]'' in 1215. The most important single article of the ''Magna Carta'', related to \"''[[habeas corpus]]''\", provided that the king was not permitted to imprison, outlaw, exile or kill anyone at a whim\u2014there must be [[due process]] of law first. This article, Article 39, of the ''Magna Carta'' read:\n\n''No free man shall be arrested, or imprisoned, or deprived of his property, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any way destroyed, nor shall we go against him or send against him, unless by legal judgement of his peers, or by the law of the land.''\n\nThis provision became the cornerstone of English liberty after that point. The [[social contract]] in the original case was between the king and the nobility, but was gradually extended to all of the people. It led to the system of [[Constitutional Monarchy]], with further reforms shifting the balance of power from the monarchy and nobility to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].\n\nThe [[Nomocanon]] of [[Saint Sava]] ({{lang-sr|\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e/Zakonopravilo}})<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QDFVUDmAIqIC&pg=PA118 The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century ... - John V.

This legal act was well developed. [[St. Sava's Nomocanon]] was the compilation of [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]], based on [[Roman Law]] and [[Canon law]], based on [[Ecumenical Councils]] and its basic purpose was to organize functioning of the young [[Serbia in the Middle Ages|Serbian kingdom]] and the [[Serbian Ortodox Church|Serbian church]]. Saint Sava began the work on the Serbian Nomocanon in 1208 while being at [[Mount Athos]], using ''The Nomocanon in Fourteen Titles'', ''Synopsis of Stefan the Efesian'', ''Nomocanon of [[John Scholasticus]]'', Ecumenical Councils' documents, which he modified with the canonical commentaries of Aristinos and [[Joannes Zonaras]], local church meetings, rules of the [[Holy Fathers]], the law of [[Moses]], translation of Prohiron and the [[Byzantine emperors]]' [[Novellae Constitutiones|Novellae]] (most were taken from [[Justinian]]'s Novellae). The Nomocanon was completely new compilation of civil and canonical regulations, taken from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] sources, but completed and reformed by St. Sava to function properly in Serbia. Beside decrees that organized the life of church, there are various norms regarding civil life, most of them were taken from Prohiron. [[Legal transplants]] of [[Roman Law|Roman]]-[[Byzantine law]] became the basis of the Serbian medieval law.

'Ibn al-Assal took his laws partly from apostolic writings and Mosaic law, and partly from the former [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] codes. There are a few historical records claiming that this law code was translated into [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] and entered Ethiopia around 1450 in the reign of [[Zara Yaqob]]. Even so, its first recorded use in the function of a constitution (supreme law of the land) is with [[Sarsa Dengel]] beginning in 1563. The ''Fetha Negest'' remained the supreme law in Ethiopia until 1931, when a modern-style [[Constitution of Ethiopia|Constitution]] was first granted by Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] I.\n\n[[File:ConstCATMonso1535.png|thumb|upright=0.75|left|Third volume of the compilation of Catalan Constitutions of 1585]]\nIn the [[Principality of Catalonia]], the [[Catalan constitutions]] were promulgated by the Court from 1283 (or even two centuries before, if we consider the [[Usatges of Barcelona]] as part of the compilation of Constitutions) until 1716, when [[Philip V of Spain]] gave the [[Nueva Planta decrees]], finishing with the historical laws of [[Catalonia]]. These Constitutions were usually made formally as a royal initiative, but required for its approval or repeal the favorable vote of the [[Catalan Courts]], the medieval antecedent of the modern Parliaments. These laws had, as the other modern constitutions, preeminence over other laws, and they could not be contradicted by mere decrees or edicts of the king.\n\nThe [[Golden Bull of 1356]] was a decree issued by a ''[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]]'' in Nuremberg headed by Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] that fixed, for a period of more than four hundred years, an important aspect of the constitutional structure of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nIn [[China]], the [[Hongwu Emperor]] created and refined a document he called ''[[Huang Ming Zu Xun|Ancestral Injunctions]]'' (first published in 1375, revised twice more before his death in 1398).

It also required the calling of triennial [[Parliament]]s, with each sitting for at least five months.\n\nThe ''Instrument of Government'' was replaced in May 1657 by England's second, and last, codified constitution, the [[Humble Petition and Advice]], proposed by Sir [[Christopher Packe (politician)|Christopher Packe]].<ref>[[Sidney Lee|Lee, Sidney]] (1903), [[Dictionary of National Biography]] [https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofnati00leesuoft#page/991/mode/1up Index and Epitome p. 991].</ref> The Petition offered hereditary [[monarchy]] to [[Oliver Cromwell]], asserted [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]'s control over issuing new [[taxation]], provided an independent council to advise the king and safeguarded 'Triennial' meetings of Parliament. A modified version of the Humble Petition with the clause on kingship removed was ratified on 25 May. This finally met its demise in conjunction with the death of Cromwell and the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] of the monarchy.\n\nOther examples of European constitutions of this era were the [[Corsican Constitution]] of 1755 and the [[Swedish Constitution of 1772]].\n\nAll of the British colonies in North America that were to become the 13 original United States, adopted their own constitutions in 1776 and 1777, during the American Revolution (and before the later [[Articles of Confederation]] and [[United States Constitution]]), with the exceptions of Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. The [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] adopted [[Constitution of Massachusetts|its Constitution]] in 1780, the oldest still-functioning constitution of any U.S. state; while Connecticut and Rhode Island officially continued to operate under their old colonial charters, until they adopted their first state constitutions in 1818 and 1843, respectively.\n\n====Democratic constitutions====\n[[File:Konstytucja 3 Maja.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[Constitution of May 3, 1791 (painting)|Constitution of May 3, 1791]]'' (painting by [[Jan Matejko]], 1891).

It was written to establish a free [[Cossack Hetmanate|Zaporozhian-Ukrainian Republic]], with the support of [[Charles XII of Sweden]]. It is notable in that it established a democratic standard for the separation of powers in government between the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches, well before the publication of Montesquieu's ''[[Spirit of the Laws]]''. This Constitution also limited the executive authority of the ''hetman'', and established a democratically elected Cossack parliament called the General Council.

The leader of the national emancipation process was the Portuguese prince [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]], elder son of the king of Portugal. Pedro was crowned in 1822 as first emperor of Brazil. The country was ruled by Constitutional monarchy until 1889, when finally adopted the Republican model.\n\nIn [[Denmark]], as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[absolute monarchy]] lost its personal possession of [[Norway]] to another absolute monarchy, [[Sweden]].

Such rule led some thinkers to take the position that what mattered was not the design of governmental institutions and operations, as much as the character of the rulers. This view can be seen in [[Plato]], who called for rule by \"philosopher-kings.\"<ref>'' Aristotle, by Francesco Hayez</ref> Later writers, such as [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]] and [[Plutarch]], would examine designs for government from a legal and historical standpoint.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] brought a series of political philosophers who wrote implied criticisms of the practices of monarchs and sought to identify principles of constitutional design that would be likely to yield more effective and just governance from their viewpoints. This began with revival of the Roman [[law of nations]] concept<ref>''[http://www.constitution.org/victoria/victoria_.htm Relectiones]'', Franciscus de Victoria (lect. 1532, first pub. 1557).</ref> and its application to the relations among nations, and they sought to establish customary \"laws of war and peace\"<ref>''[[The Law of War and Peace]]'', Hugo Grotius (1625)</ref> to ameliorate wars and make them less likely. This led to considerations of what authority monarchs or other officials have and don't have, from where that authority derives, and the remedies for the abuse of such authority.<ref>''[http://www.constitution.org/vct/vct.htm Vindiciae Contra Tyrannos (Defense of Liberty Against Tyrants)]'', \"Junius Brutus\" (Orig. Fr. 1581, Eng. tr. 1622, 1688)</ref>\n\nA seminal juncture in this line of discourse arose in England from the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], the [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] [[Commonwealth of England|Protectorate]], the writings of [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Samuel Rutherford]], the [[Levellers]], [[John Milton]], and [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], leading to the debate between [[Robert Filmer]], arguing for the divine right of monarchs, on the one side, and on the other, [[Henry Neville (writer)|Henry Neville]], [[James Tyrrell (writer)|James Tyrrell]], [[Algernon Sidney]], and [[John Locke]]. What arose from the latter was a concept of government being erected on the foundations of first, a state of nature governed by natural laws, then a state of society, established by a social contract or compact, which bring underlying natural or social laws, before governments are formally established on them as foundations.\n\nAlong the way several writers examined how the design of government was important, even if the government were headed by a monarch. They also classified various historical examples of governmental designs, typically into democracies, aristocracies, or monarchies, and considered how just and effective each tended to be and why, and how the advantages of each might be obtained by combining elements of each into a more complex design that balanced competing tendencies. Some, such as [[Montesquieu]], also examined how the functions of government, such as legislative, executive, and judicial, might appropriately be separated into branches. The prevailing theme among these writers was that the design of constitutions is not completely arbitrary or a matter of taste. They generally held that there are underlying principles of design that constrain all constitutions for every polity or organization. Each built on the ideas of those before concerning what those principles might be.\n\nThe later writings of [[Orestes Brownson]]<ref>[http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=2053 ''The American Republic: its Constitution, Tendencies, and Destiny''], O. A. Brownson (1866)</ref> would try to explain what constitutional designers were trying to do. According to Brownson there are, in a sense, three \"constitutions\" involved: The first the ''constitution of nature'' that includes all of what was called \"natural law.\" The second is the ''constitution of society'', an unwritten and commonly understood set of rules for the society formed by a social contract before it establishes a government, by which it establishes the third, a ''constitution of government''. The second would include such elements as the making of decisions by public [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]] called by [[public notice]] and conducted by established [[Parliamentary procedure|rules of procedure]]. Each constitution must be consistent with, and derive its authority from, the ones before it, as well as from a historical act of society formation or constitutional ratification. Brownson argued that a [[state (polity)|state]] is a society with effective dominion over a well-defined territory, that consent to a well-designed constitution of government arises from presence on that territory, and that it is possible for provisions of a written constitution of government to be \"unconstitutional\" if they are inconsistent with the constitutions of nature or society. Brownson argued that it is not ratification alone that makes a written constitution of government legitimate, but that it must also be competently designed and applied.\n\nOther writers<ref>''Principles of Constitutional Design'', Donald S. Lutz (2006) {{ISBN|0-521-86168-3}}</ref> have argued that such considerations apply not only to all national constitutions of government, but also to the constitutions of private organizations, that it is not an accident that the constitutions that tend to satisfy their members contain certain elements, as a minimum, or that their provisions tend to become very similar as they are amended after experience with their use. Provisions that give rise to certain kinds of questions are seen to need additional provisions for how to resolve those questions, and provisions that offer no course of action may best be omitted and left to policy decisions. Provisions that conflict with what Brownson and others can discern are the underlying \"constitutions\" of nature and society tend to be difficult or impossible to execute, or to lead to unresolvable disputes.\n\nConstitutional design has been treated as a kind of [[metagame]] in which play consists of finding the best design and provisions for a written constitution that will be the rules for the game of government, and that will be most likely to optimize a balance of the utilities of justice, liberty, and security. An example is the metagame [[Nomic]].<ref>[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psa/ The Paradox of Self-Amendment], byPeter Suber (1990) {{ISBN|0-8204-1212-0}}</ref>\n\nPolitical economy theory regards constitutions as coordination devices that help citizens to prevent rulers from abusing power.

Because rulers cannot themselves implement their policies, they need to rely on a set of organizations (armies, courts, police agencies, tax collectors) to implement it. In this position, they can directly sanction the government by refusing to cooperate, disabling the authority of the rulers. Therefore, constitutions could be characterized by a self-enforcing equilibria between the rulers and powerful administrators.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gonz\u00e1lez de Lara|first=Yadira|last2=Greif|first2=Avner|last3=Jha|first3=Saumitra|date=May 2008|title=The Administrative Foundations of Self-Enforcing Constitutions|url=|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=98 |issue=2|pages=105\u2013109|doi=10.1257/aer.98.2.105}}</ref>\n\n==Governmental constitutions==\n{{Original research|section|date=September 2016}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2016}}\n[[File:Red copy of the Russian constitution.jpg|thumb|upright|[[President of Russia|Presidential]] copy of the [[Constitution of Russia|Russian Constitution]].]]\n\nMost commonly, the term ''constitution'' refers to a set of rules and principles that define the nature and extent of government. Most constitutions seek to regulate the relationship between institutions of the state, in a basic sense the relationship between the executive, legislature and the judiciary, but also the relationship of institutions within those branches. For example, executive branches can be divided into a head of government, government departments/ministries, executive agencies and a [[civil service]]/administration. Most constitutions also attempt to define the relationship between individuals and the state, and to establish the broad rights of individual citizens. It is thus the most basic law of a territory from which all the other laws and rules are hierarchically derived; in some territories it is in fact called \"[[Basic Law]]\".\n\n===Key features===\nThe following are features of democratic constitutions that have been identified by political scientists to exist, in one form or another, in virtually all national constitutions.\n\n====Classification====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Type !! Form !! Example\n|-\n| Codified   || in single act (document) || ''Most of the world constitutions.''\n|-\n| Uncodified || fully written (in few documents) || [[Constitution of San Marino|San Marino]], Israel, Saudi Arabia\n|-\n| Uncodified || partially unwritten (see [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]) || Canada, NZ, UK\n|}\n\n====Codification====\nA fundamental classification is codification or lack of codification. A codified constitution is one that is contained in a single document, which is the single source of constitutional law in a state. An uncodified constitution is one that is not contained in a single document, consisting of several different sources, which may be written or unwritten; see [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]].\n\n=====Codified constitution=====\nMost states in the world have codified constitutions.\n\nCodified constitutions are often the product of some dramatic political change, such as a [[revolution]]. The process by which a country adopts a constitution is closely tied to the historical and political context driving this fundamental change. The legitimacy (and often the longevity) of codified constitutions has often been tied to the process by which they are initially adopted and some scholars have [http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/75150/wiki-constitutionalism pointed out] that high constitutional [[Wiki-constitutionalism|turnover]] within a given country may itself be detrimental to separation of powers and the rule of law.\n\nStates that have codified constitutions normally give the constitution supremacy over ordinary [[statute]] law. That is, if there is any conflict between a legal statute and the codified constitution, all or part of the statute can be declared ''ultra vires'' by a court, and struck down as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. In addition, exceptional procedures are often required to [[constitutional amendment|amend a constitution]]. These procedures may include: convocation of a special [[constituent assembly]] or constitutional convention, requiring a [[supermajority]] of legislators' votes, the consent of regional legislatures, a [[referendum]] process, and/or other procedures that make amending a constitution more difficult than passing a simple law.\n\nConstitutions may also provide that their most basic principles can never be abolished, even by amendment. In case a formally valid amendment of a constitution infringes these principles protected against any amendment, it may constitute a so-called ''unconstitutional constitutional law''.\n\nCodified constitutions normally consist of a ceremonial [[preamble]], which sets forth the goals of the state and the motivation for the constitution, and several articles containing the substantive provisions. The preamble, which is omitted in some constitutions, may contain a [[Constitutional references to God|reference to God]] and/or to fundamental values of the state such as [[liberty]], [[democracy]] or [[human rights]]. In ethnic nation-states such as [[Estonia]], the mission of the state can be defined as preserving a specific nation, language and culture.\n\n=====Uncodified constitution=====\n{{Main|Uncodified constitution}}\n[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|[[Magna Carta]]]]\n{{As of|2017}} only two sovereign states, [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]], have wholly uncodified constitutions. The [[Basic Laws of Israel]] have since 1950 been intended to be the basis for a constitution, but as of 2017 it had not been drafted. The various Laws are considered to have precedence over other laws, and give the procedure by which they can be amended, typically by a simple majority of members of the Knesset (parliament).<ref name=lawsintro>{{cite web|title=Basic Laws - Introduction|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/description/eng/eng_mimshal_yesod.htm|website=The Knesset|date=2016|accessdate=7 May 2017}} Article gives information on the procedures for amending each of the Basic Laws of Israel.</ref>\n\nUncodified constitutions are the product of an \"evolution\" of laws and conventions over centuries (such as in the [[Westminster System]] that developed in Britain). By contrast to codified constitutions, uncodified constitutions include both written sources \u2013 e.g. constitutional statutes enacted by the Parliament \u2013 and unwritten sources \u2013 [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional conventions]], observation of [[precedent]]s, [[royal prerogative]]s, [[convention (norm)|customs]] and traditions, such as holding general elections on Thursdays; together these constitute [[British constitutional law]].\n\n=====Written versus unwritten; codified versus uncodified=====\nSome constitutions are largely, but not wholly, codified. For example, in the Constitution of Australia, most of its fundamental political principles and regulations concerning the relationship between branches of government, and concerning the government and the individual are codified in a single document, the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. However, the presence of statutes with constitutional significance, namely the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], as adopted by the Commonwealth in the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942]], and the [[Australia Act 1986]] means that Australia's constitution is not contained in a single constitutional document. It means the Constitution of Australia is uncodified, it also contains [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional conventions]], thus is partially unwritten.\n\nThe [[Constitution of Canada]], which evolved from the [[British North America Acts]] until severed from nominal British control by the [[Canada Act 1982]] (analogous to the Australia Act 1986), is a similar example. Canada's constitution [[List of Canadian constitutional documents|consists of almost 30 different statutes]].\n\nThe terms ''written constitution'' and ''codified constitution'' are often used interchangeably, as are ''unwritten constitution'' and ''uncodified constitution'', although this usage is technically inaccurate. A codified constitution is a single document; states that do not have such a document have uncodified, but not entirely unwritten, constitutions, since much of an uncodified constitution is usually written in laws such as the [[Basic Laws of Israel]] and the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949|Parliament Acts]] of the United Kingdom. Uncodified constitutions largely lack protection against amendment by the government of the time. For example, the UK [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] legislated by simple majority for strictly [[Fixed-term election|fixed-term parliaments]]; until then the ruling party could call a general election at any convenient time up to the maximum term of five years. This change would require a constitutional amendment in most nations.\n\n====Entrenchment====\n{{Original research|section|date=December 2010}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}\n[[File:Constitution of the United States, page 1.jpg|thumb|[[United States Constitution]]]]\n\n{{further|Fundamental Laws of England}}\n\nThe presence or lack of entrenchment is a fundamental feature of constitutions. An entrenched constitution cannot be altered in any way by a legislature as part of its normal business concerning ordinary statutory laws, but can only be amended by a different and more onerous procedure. There may be a requirement for a [[Constituent assembly|special body]] to be set up, or the proportion of favourable votes of members of existing legislative bodies may be required to be higher to pass a constitutional amendment than for [[statute]]s. The [[entrenched clause]]s of a constitution can create different degrees of entrenchment, ranging from simply excluding constitutional amendment from the normal business of a legislature, to making certain amendments either more difficult than normal modifications, or forbidden under any circumstances.\n\nEntrenchment is an inherent feature in most codified constitutions. A codified constitution will incorporate the rules which must be followed for the constitution itself to be changed.\n\nThe US constitution is an example of an entrenched constitution, and the UK constitution is an example of a constitution that is not entrenched (or codified). In some states the text of the constitution may be changed; in others the original text is not changed, and [[Constitutional amendment|amendments]] are passed which add to and may override the original text and earlier amendments.\n\nProcedures for constitutional amendment vary between states. In a nation with a federal system of government the approval of a majority of state or provincial legislatures may be required. Alternatively, a national referendum may be required. Details are to be found in the articles on the constitutions of the various nations and federal states in the world.\n\nIn constitutions that are not entrenched, no special procedure is required for modification. Lack of entrenchment is a characteristic of uncodified constitutions; the constitution is not recognised with any higher legal status than ordinary [[statutes]]. In the UK, for example laws which modify written or unwritten provisions of the constitution are passed on a simple majority in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. No special \"constitutional amendment\" procedure is required. The principle of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] holds that no sovereign parliament may be bound by the acts of its predecessors;<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040821114312/http://www.sovereignty.org.uk/features/eucon/fcosov.html UK principle: no Parliament is bound by the acts of its predecessors]</ref> and there is no higher authority that can create law which binds Parliament. The [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|sovereign]] is nominally the head of state with important powers, such as the power to declare war; the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|uncodified and unwritten constitution]] removes all these powers in practice.\n\nIn practice democratic governments do not use the lack of entrenchment of the constitution to impose the will of the government or abolish all civil rights, as they could in theory do, but the distinction between constitutional and other law is still somewhat arbitrary, usually following historical principles embodied in important past legislation. For example, several British [[Acts of Parliament]] such as the [[English Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], Human Rights Act and, prior to the creation of Parliament, Magna Carta are regarded as granting fundamental rights and principles which are treated as almost constitutional. Several rights that in another state might be guaranteed by constitution have indeed been abolished or modified by the British parliament in the early 21st century, including{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} the unconditional right to [[trial by jury]], the [[right to silence]] without prejudicial inference, [[Habeas corpus|permissible detention before a charge is made]] extended from 24 hours to 42 days, and the [[Double jeopardy|right not to be tried twice for the same offence]].\n\n=====Absolutely unmodifiable articles=====\nThe strongest level of [[entrenched clause|entrenchment]] exists in those constitutions that state that some of their most fundamental principles are absolute, i.e. certain articles may not be amended under any circumstances. An amendment of a constitution that is made consistently with that constitution, except that it violates the absolute non-modifiability, can be called an ''unconstitutional constitutional law''. Ultimately it is always possible for a constitution to be overthrown by internal or external force, for example, a [[revolution]] (perhaps claiming to be justified by the [[right to revolution]]) or invasion.\nIn the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court has created the [[Doctrine of Basic Structure]] in Kesavananda Bharti's case (1973) stating that the essential features of the Basic structure cannot be amended by the Parliament. The Court has identified judicial review, independence of Judiciary, free and fair election, core of Fundamental Rights as a few of the essential features which are unamendable. However, the Supreme Court did not identify specific provisions which are in the category of absolute entrenchment. A critical analysis of the Doctrine of Basic Structure appears in Professor M.K. Bhandari's book ''Basic Structure of Indian Constitution - A Critical Reconsideration''.\n\nAn example of absolute unmodifiability is found in the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]]. Articles 1 and 20 protect human dignity, human rights, democracy, rule of law, federal and social state principles, and the people's right of resistance as a last resort against an attempt to abolish the constitutional order. [[Entrenched clause#Germany|Article 79, Section 3]] states that these principles cannot be changed, even according to the methods of amendment defined elsewhere in the document, until a new constitution comes into effect.\n\nAnother example is the [[Constitution of Honduras]], which has an article stating that the article itself and certain other articles cannot be changed in any circumstances. Article 374 of the Honduras Constitution asserts this unmodifiability, stating, \"It is not possible to reform, in any case, the preceding article, the present article, the constitutional articles referring to the form of government, to the national territory, to the presidential period, the prohibition to serve again as President of the Republic, the citizen who has performed under any title in consequence of which she/he cannot be President of the Republic in the subsequent period.\"<ref name=\"georgetown_const_82-05_art374\">{{Cite journal | title= Republic of Honduras: Political Constitution of 1982 through 2005 reforms; Article 374 | work= Political Database of the Americas | publisher= [[Georgetown University]] | url= http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Honduras/hond05.html  | language= Spanish}}</ref> This unmodifiability article played an important role in the [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis]].\n\n====Distribution of sovereignty====\n{{See also|Federalism}}\n\nConstitutions also establish where sovereignty is located in the state. There are three basic types of distribution of sovereignty according to the degree of centralisation of power: unitary, federal, and confederal. The distinction is not absolute.\n\nIn a unitary state, sovereignty resides in the state itself, and the constitution determines this. The territory of the state may be divided into regions, but they are not sovereign and are subordinate to the state. In the UK, the constitutional doctrine of [[Parliamentary sovereignty]] dictates than sovereignty is ultimately contained at the centre. Some powers have been [[devolution|devolved]] to [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and [[Wales]] (but not [[England]]). Some unitary states ([[Spain]] is an example) devolve more and more power to sub-national governments until the state functions in practice much like a federal state.\n\nA federal state has a central structure with at most a small amount of territory mainly containing the institutions of the federal government, and several regions (called ''states'', ''provinces'', etc.) which compose the territory of the whole state. Sovereignty is divided between the centre and the constituent regions. The constitutions of Canada and the United States establish federal states, with power divided between the federal government and the provinces or states. Each of the regions may in turn have its own constitution (of unitary nature).\n\nA confederal state comprises again several regions, but the central structure has only limited coordinating power, and sovereignty is located in the regions. Confederal constitutions are rare, and there is often dispute to whether so-called \"confederal\" states are actually federal.\n\nTo some extent a group of states which do not constitute a federation as such may by [[treaty|treaties]] and accords give up parts of their sovereignty to a [[supranational]] entity. For example, the countries constituting the [[European Union]] have agreed to abide by some Union-wide measures which restrict their absolute sovereignty in some ways, e.g., the use of the [[metric system of measurement]] instead of national units previously used.\n\n====Separation of powers====\n{{Main|Separation of powers}}\n\nConstitutions usually explicitly divide power between various branches of government. The standard model, described by the [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]], involves three branches of government: [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislature|legislative]] and [[judiciary|judicial]]. Some constitutions include additional branches, such as an [[audit|auditory branch]]. Constitutions vary extensively as to the degree of separation of powers between these branches.\n\n====Lines of accountability====\nIn [[presidential]] and [[semi-presidential]] systems of government, department secretaries/ministers are accountable to the [[president]], who has patronage powers to appoint and dismiss ministers. The president is accountable to the people in an election.\n\nIn [[parliamentary]] systems, Cabinet Ministers are accountable to [[Parliament]], but it is the [[prime minister]] who appoints and dismisses them. In the case of the United Kingdom and other countries with a monarchy, it is the monarch who appoints and dismisses ministers, on the advice of the prime minister. In turn the prime minister will resign if the government loses the confidence of the parliament (or a part of it). Confidence can be lost if the government loses a [[vote of no confidence]] or, depending on the country,<ref>A synchronic comparative perspective were before the founding fathers of Italian Constitution, when they were faced with the question of bicameralism and related issues of confidence and the legislative procedure, {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Il bicameralismo tra due modelli mancati|journal= L\u2019Ago e il filo edizione online|date=2013| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89409110}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref> loses a particularly important vote in parliament, such as vote on the budget. When a government loses confidence, it stays in office until a new government is formed; something which normally but not necessarily required the holding of a general election.\n\n====State of emergency====\n{{Main|State of emergency}}\nMany constitutions allow the declaration under exceptional circumstances of some form of state of emergency during which some rights and guarantees are suspended. This provision can be and has been abused to allow a government to suppress dissent without regard for human rights\u2014see the article on [[state of emergency]].\n\n===Facade constitutions===\n{{See also|Constitutionalism}}\nItalian political theorist [[Giovanni Sartori]] noted the existence of national constitutions which are a facade for authoritarian sources of power. While such documents may express respect for [[human rights]] or establish an independent judiciary, they may be ignored when the government feels threatened, or never put into practice. An extreme example was the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]] that on paper supported [[freedom of assembly]] and [[freedom of speech]]; however, citizens who transgressed unwritten limits were summarily [[Political prisoner|imprisoned]]. The example demonstrates that the protections and benefits of a constitution are ultimately provided not through its written terms but through deference by government and society to its principles. A constitution may change from being real to a facade and back again as democratic and autocratic governments succeed each other.\n\n==Constitutional courts==\n{{Further|Constitutional court|Constitutionality}}\n\nConstitutions are often, but by no means always, protected by a legal body whose job it is to interpret those constitutions and, where applicable, declare void executive and legislative acts which infringe the constitution. In some countries, such as [[Germany]], this function is carried out by a dedicated constitutional court which performs this (and only this) function. In other countries, such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the ordinary courts may perform this function in addition to their other responsibilities. While elsewhere, like in the [[United Kingdom]], the concept of declaring an act to be unconstitutional does not exist.\n\nA constitutional violation is an action or legislative act that is judged by a [[constitutional court]] to be contrary to the constitution, that is, unconstitutional. An example of constitutional violation by the executive could be a public office holder who acts outside the powers granted to that office by a constitution. An example of constitutional violation by the legislature is an attempt to pass a law that would contradict the constitution, without first going through the proper [[constitutional amendment]] process.\n\nSome countries, mainly those with uncodified constitutions, have no such courts at all. For example, the [[United Kingdom]] has traditionally operated under the principle of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] under which the laws passed by [[United Kingdom Parliament]] could not be questioned by the courts.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Basic law]], equivalent in some countries, often for a temporary constitution\n* [[Apostolic constitution]] (a class of [[Catholic Church]] documents)\n* [[Constitution of the Roman Republic]]\n* [[Constitutional amendment]]\n* [[Constitutional court]]\n* [[Constitutional crisis]]\n* [[Constitutional economics]]\n* [[Constitutionalism]]\n* [[Constitutional documents|Corporate constitutional documents]]\n* [[International constitutional law]]\n* [[Judicial activism]]\n* [[Judicial restraint]]\n* [[Judicial review]]\n* [[Philosophy of law]]\n* [[Rule of law]]\n* [[Rule according to higher law]]\n\n''Judicial philosophies of constitutional interpretation (note: generally specific to [[United States constitutional law]])''\n* [[List of national constitutions]]\n* [[Originalism]]\n* [[Strict constructionism]]\n* [[Textualism]]\n* [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|Proposed European Union constitution]]\n** [[Treaty of Lisbon]] (adopts same changes, but without constitutional name)\n* [[United Nations Charter]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- NO MORE LINKS!

In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past [[precedent]]ial decisions of relevant courts, and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts.  If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as ''[[stare decisis]]''). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a \"[[Case of first impression|matter of first impression]]\"), and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question, judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision).<ref>''Marbury v.

This split propagated to many of the colonies, including the United States. For most purposes, most jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal system and most states, have merged the two courts.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule2.htm Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 2] (\"There is one form of action\u2014the civil action.\") (1938)</ref><ref name=\"friedmanxix\">{{harvnb|Friedman|2005|p=xix}}</ref> Additionally, even before the separate courts were merged, most courts were permitted to apply both law and equity, though under potentially different procedural law.

Historical uses}} ===\n\nIn addition, there are several historical (but now archaic) uses of the term that, while no longer current, provide background context that assists in understanding the meaning of \"common law\" today.\n\nIn one usage that is now archaic, but that gives insight into the history of the common law, \"common law\" referred to the pre-Christian system of law, imported by the Saxons to England, and dating to before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], and before there was any consistent law to be applied.<ref name=\"JeffersonToCooper\">One example of this usage is in a letter from Thomas Jefferson to Dr. Thomas Cooper. {{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=Letter to Dr. Thomas Cooper|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/jefferson_cooper.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=February 10, 1814|quote=Authorities for what is common law may therefore be as well cited, as for any part of the Lex Scripta, and there is no better instance of the necessity of holding the judges and writers to a declaration of their authorities than the present; where we detect them endeavoring to make law where they found none, and to submit us at one stroke to a whole system, no particle of which has its foundation in the common law. For we know that the common law is that system of law which was introduced by the Saxons on their settlement in England, and altered from time to time by proper legislative authority from that time to the date of Magna Carta, which terminates the period of the common law, or lex non scripta, and commences that of the statute law, or Lex Scripta. This settlement took place about the middle of the fifth century. But Christianity was not introduced till the seventh century; the conversion of the first christian king of the Heptarchy having taken place about the year 598, and that of the last about 686. Here, then, was a space of two hundred years, during which the common law was in existence, and Christianity no part of it.}}</ref><ref name=JeffersonToCartwright>Another example of this usage is in another letter of Jefferson, to John Cartright.{{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|title=Letter To Major John Cartwright|url=http://www.yamaguchy.com/library/jefferson/cartwright.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=June 5, 1824|quote=I was glad to find in your book a formal contradiction, at length, of the judiciary usurpation of legislative powers; for such the judges have usurped in their repeated decisions, that Christianity is a part of the common law.

It is both underinclusive and overinclusive, as discussed [[Common law#CL Misconceptions|in the section on \"misconceptions\"]].\n\n\"Common law\" as the term is used today in common law countries contrasts with ''[[ius commune]]''. While historically the ''ius commune'' became a secure point of reference in continental European legal systems, in England it was not a point of reference at all.<ref name=\"Ius Commune' p.20\">[[David John Ibbetson]], ''Common Law and Ius Commune'' p.20 (2001) {{ISBN|978-0-85423-165-2}}</ref>\n\nThe English [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] dealt with lawsuits in which the Monarch had no interest, i.e., between commoners.\n\n''Black's Law Dictionary'' 10th Ed., definition 3 is \"General law common to a country as a whole, as opposed to special law that has only local application.\"<ref name=\"Blacks10th\">{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary \u2013 Common law|date=2014|edition=10th|p=334}}</ref> From at least the 11th century and continuing for several centuries after that, there were several different circuits in the royal court system, served by [[Circuit court|itinerant judges]] who would travel from town to town dispensing the King's justice in \"[[assize]]s\".

Under this older view, the legal profession considered it no part of a judge's duty to make new or change existing law, but only to expound and apply the old. By the early 20th century, largely at the urging of [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] (as discussed throughout this article), this view had fallen into the minority view: Holmes pointed out that the older view worked undesirable and unjust results, and hampered a proper development of the law. In the century since Holmes, the dominant understanding has been that common law \u201cdecisions are themselves law, or rather the rules which the courts lay down in making the decisions constitute law\u201d.<ref name=\"CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions\" /> The reality of the modern view can be seen in practical operation: under the old \"pre-existing custom\" view, (a) jurisdictions could not logically diverge from each other (but nonetheless did), (b) a new decision logically needed to operate retroactively (but did not), and (c) there was no standard to decide which English medieval customs should be \"law\" and which should not. All three tensions resolve under the modern view: (a) the common law in different jurisdictions may diverge, (b) new decisions need not have retroactive operation, and (c) court decisions are effective immediately as they are issued, not years later, or after they become \"custom\", and questions of what \"custom\" might have been at some \"ancient\" time are simply irrelevant.\n* Common law, as the term is used among lawyers in the present day, is not frozen in time, and no longer beholden to 11th, 13th, or 17th century English law. Rather, the common law evolves daily and immediately as courts issue precedential decisions (as explained [[Common law#Principles Common Law Evolves|later in this article]]), and all parties in the legal system (courts, lawyers, and all others) are responsible for up-to-date knowledge.<ref>For example, ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]'' ended prayer in public schools immediately, and same-sex marriage became legal throughout the United States immediately on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''.</ref> There is no fixed reference point (for example the 11th or 18th centuries) for the definition of \"common law\", except in a handful of isolated contexts.<ref>See, for example, [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution#The historical test|applicability of the Seventh Amendment]]</ref> Much of what was \"customary\" in the 13th or 17th or 18th century has no part of the common law today; much of the common law today has no antecedent in those earlier centuries. Among legal professionals (lawyers and judges), the change in understanding occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (as explained [[Common law#History and Holmes|later in this article]]),<ref name=\"CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions\" /> though lay dictionaries were decades behind in recognizing the change.\n* The common law is not \"unwritten\". Common law exists in writing\u2014as must any law that is to be applied consistently\u2014in the written decisions of judges.<ref name=\"GarnerUsageDef0\" /><ref name=\"CarpenterColumbiaCourtDecisions\" /><ref name=\"Blacks10thDef1\" />\n* Common law is not the product of \"universal consent\".

L.Rev. 1 (Sep. 2007) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1012220] [https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1209]</ref> First, one must ascertain the facts. Then, one must locate any relevant statutes and cases. Then one must extract the principles, analogies and statements by various courts of what they consider important to determine how the next court is likely to rule on the facts of the present case. Later decisions, and decisions of higher courts or legislatures carry more weight than earlier cases and those of lower courts.<ref>''e.g.'', ''Ex parte Holt'', 19 USPQ2d 1211, 1214 (Bd. Patent App. & Interf. 1991) (explaining the hierarchy of precedent binding on tribunals of the United States Patent Office)</ref> Finally, one integrates all the lines drawn and reasons given, and determines \"what the law is\". Then, one applies that law to the facts.\n\nIn practice, common law systems are considerably more complicated than the simplified system described above. The decisions of a court are binding only in a particular [[jurisdiction]], and even within a given jurisdiction, some courts have more power than others. For example, in most jurisdictions, decisions by [[appellate courts]] are binding on lower courts in the same jurisdiction, and on future decisions of the same appellate court, but decisions of lower courts are only non-binding persuasive authority. Interactions between common law, [[constitutional law]], [[statutory law]] and [[Regulation (law)|regulatory law]] also give rise to considerable complexity.\n\n=== The common law evolves to meet changing social needs and improved understanding {{anchor|CL_Common_Law_Evolves}} ===\n[[File:Holmes Nomination.JPG|thumb|Nomination of Oliver Wendell Holmes to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1902.]]\n[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] cautioned that \"the proper derivation of general principles in both common and constitutional law ... arise gradually, in the emergence of a consensus from a multitude of particularized prior decisions.\"<ref>Frederic R. Kellog, Law, Morals, and Justice Holmes, 69 Judicature 214 (1986).</ref> [[Benjamin Cardozo|Justice Cardozo]] noted the \"common law does not work from pre-established truths of universal and inflexible validity to conclusions derived from them deductively\", but \"[i]ts method is inductive, and it draws its generalizations from particulars\".<ref>Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 22\u201323 (1921).</ref>\n\nThe common law is more malleable than statutory law. First, common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent, but can (when extraordinarily good reason is shown) reinterpret and revise the law, without legislative intervention, to adapt to new trends in political, legal and [[social philosophy]]. Second, the common law evolves through a series of [[incrementalism|gradual steps]], that gradually works out all the details, so that over a decade or more, the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects.<ref>The beneficial qualities of the common law's incrementalist evolution was most eloquently expressed by the future [[Lord Mansfield]], then Solicitor General Murray, in the case of ''Omychund v. Barker'', who contended that \"a statute very seldom can take in all cases; therefore the common law, that works itself pure by rules drawn from the fountain of justice, is for that reason superior to an [[Act of Parliament|act of parliament]].\" I Atk. 21, 33, 26 Eng. Rep. 15, 22\u201323 (Ch. 1744)</ref> In contrast to common law incrementalism, the legislative process is very difficult to get started, as legislatures tend to delay action until a situation is totally intolerable. For these reasons, legislative changes tend to be large, jarring and disruptive (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, and sometimes with unintended consequences).\n\nOne example of the gradual change that typifies evolution of the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. The traditional common law rule through most of the 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were in [[privity of contract]]. Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect, and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. In an 1842 English case, ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright]]'',<ref>''Winterbottom v. Wright'', 10 M&W 109, 152 Eng.Rep. 402, 1842 WL 5519 (Exchequer of pleas 1842)</ref> the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The ''Winterbottom'' court recognized that there would be \"absurd and outrageous consequences\" if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and knew it had to draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury. The court looked to the contractual relationships, and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract (\"privity\") with the negligent party.\n\nA first exception to this rule arose in 1852, in the case of ''[[Thomas v. Winchester]]'',<ref>[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/thomas_winchester.htm ''Thomas v. Winchester''], 6 N.Y. 397 (N.Y. 1852)</ref> when New York's highest court held that mislabeling a poison as an innocuous herb, and then selling the mislabeled poison through a dealer who would be expected to resell it, put \"human life in imminent danger\". ''Thomas'' relied on this reason to create an exception to the \"privity\" rule. In, 1909, New York held in ''Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.''<ref>''Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.'', 195 N.Y. 478, 480 (N.Y. 1909)</ref> that a coffee urn manufacturer was liable to a person injured when the urn exploded, because the urn \"was of such a character inherently that, when applied to the purposes for which it was designed, it was liable to become a source of great danger to many people if not carefully and properly constructed\".\n\nYet the privity rule survived. In ''Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson'',<ref>''Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson'', 221 F. 801 (2nd Cir. 1915)</ref> (decided in 1915 by the federal appeals court for New York and several neighboring states), the court held that a car owner could not recover for injuries from a defective wheel, when the automobile owner had a contract only with the automobile dealer and not with the manufacturer, even though there was \"no question that the wheel was made of dead and \u2018dozy\u2018 wood, quite insufficient for its purposes.\" The ''Cadillac'' court was willing to acknowledge that the case law supported exceptions for \"an article dangerous in its nature or likely to become so in the course of the ordinary usage to be contemplated by the vendor\". However, held the ''Cadillac'' court, \"one who manufactures articles dangerous only if defectively made, or installed, e.g., tables, chairs, pictures or mirrors hung on the walls, carriages, automobiles, and so on, is not liable to third parties for injuries caused by them, except in case of willful injury or fraud,\"\n[[File:Cardozo Nomination.JPG|thumb|Nomination of Benjamin Cardozo to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, 1932.]]\nFinally, in the famous case of ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'',<ref>''MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.'', 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916)[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/macpherson_buick.htm]</ref> in 1916, [[Benjamin Cardozo|Judge Benjamin Cardozo]] for New York's highest court pulled a broader principle out of these predecessor cases. The facts were almost identical to ''Cadillac'' a year earlier: a wheel from a wheel manufacturer was sold to Buick, to a dealer, to MacPherson, and the wheel failed, injuring MacPherson. Judge Cardozo held:\n\n{{quote|It may be that Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co. have extended the rule of Thomas v. Winchester. If so, this court is committed to the extension. The defendant argues that things imminently dangerous to life are poisons, explosives, deadly weapons\u2014things whose normal function it is to injure or destroy. But whatever the rule in Thomas v. Winchester may once have been, it has no longer that restricted meaning. A scaffold (Devlin v. Smith, supra) is not inherently a destructive instrument. It becomes destructive only if imperfectly constructed. A large coffee urn (Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co., supra) may have within itself, if negligently made, the potency of danger, yet no one thinks of it as an implement whose normal function is destruction. What is true of the coffee urn is equally true of bottles of aerated water (Torgesen v. Schultz, 192 N. Y. 156). We have mentioned only cases in this court. But the rule has received a like extension in our courts of intermediate appeal. In Burke v. Ireland (26 App. Div. 487), in an opinion by CULLEN, J., it was applied to a builder who constructed a defective building; in Kahner v. Otis Elevator Co. (96 App. Div. 169) to the manufacturer of an elevator; in Davies v. Pelham Hod Elevating Co. (65 Hun, 573; affirmed in this court without opinion, 146 N. Y. 363) to a contractor who furnished a defective rope with knowledge of the purpose for which the rope was to be used. We are not required at this time either to approve or to disapprove the application of the rule that was made in these cases. It is enough that they help to characterize the trend of judicial thought.\n\nWe hold, then, that the principle of ''Thomas v. Winchester'' is not limited to poisons, explosives, and things of like nature, to things which in their normal operation are implements of destruction. If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully. ... There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable.}}\n\nCardozo's new \"rule\" exists in no prior case, but is inferrable as a synthesis of the \"thing of danger\" principle stated in them, merely extending it to \"foreseeable danger\" even if \"the purposes for which it was designed\" were not themselves \"a source of great danger\". ''MacPherson'' takes some care to present itself as foreseeable progression, not a wild departure. Cardozo continues to adhere to the original principle of ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright|Winterbottom]]'', that \"absurd and outrageous consequences\" must be avoided, and he does so by drawing a new line in the last sentence quoted above: \"There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable.\" But while adhering to the underlying principle that ''some'' boundary is necessary, ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.|MacPherson]]'' overruled the prior common law by rendering the formerly dominant factor in the boundary, that is, the privity formality arising out of a contractual relationship between persons, totally irrelevant. Rather, the most important factor in the boundary would be the nature of the thing sold and the foreseeable uses that downstream purchasers would make of the thing.\n\nThe example of the evolution of the law of negligence in the preceding paragraphs illustrates two crucial principles: (a) The common law evolves, this evolution is in the hands of judges, and judges have \"made law\" for hundreds of years.<ref name=\"SpeiserLawOfTorts\" /> (b) The [[ratio decidendi|reasons given for a decision]] are often more important in the long run than the outcome in a particular case. This is the reason that judicial opinions are usually quite long, and give rationales and policies that can be balanced with judgment in future cases, rather than the bright-line rules usually embodied in statutes.\n\n=== Publication of decisions ===\n\nAll law systems rely on written publication of the law,<ref name=\"BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil\" /> so that it is accessible to all. Common law decisions are published in [[law reports]] for use by lawyers, courts and the general public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=148|title=Legal Dictionary \u2013 Law.com|work=Law.com Legal Dictionary}}</ref>\n\nAfter the American Revolution, Massachusetts became the first state to establish an official Reporter of Decisions. As newer states needed law, they often looked first to the Massachusetts Reports for authoritative precedents as a basis for their own common law.<ref name=\"BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil\">Social Law Library, Common Law or Civil Code?, Boston Mass.</ref> The United States federal courts relied on private publishers until after the Civil War, and only began publishing as a government function [[United States Reports#history|in 1874]]. [[West (publisher)|West Publishing in Minnesota]] is the largest private-sector publisher of law reports in the United States. Government publishers typically issue only decisions \"in the raw,\" while private sector publishers often add indexing, editorial analysis, and similar finding aids.\n\n=== Interaction of constitutional, statutory and common law{{anchor|Interaction_with_statute}} ===\n\nIn common law legal systems, the common law is crucial to understanding almost all important areas of law. For example, in [[English law|England and Wales]], in English Canada, and in most states of the [[Law of the United States|United States]], the basic law of [[contract]]s, [[tort]]s and [[property law|property]] do not exist in statute, but only in common law (though there may be isolated modifications enacted by statute). As another example, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1877,<ref>''Meister v. Moore'', 96 U.S. 76 (1877) (\"No doubt a statute may take away a common law right, but there is always a presumption that the legislature has no such intention unless it be plainly expressed.\")</ref> held that a [[Michigan]] statute that established rules for [[solemnization]] of marriages did not abolish pre-existing [[common-law marriage]], because the statute did not affirmatively require statutory solemnization and was silent as to preexisting common law.\n\nIn almost all areas of the law (even those where there is a statutory framework, such as contracts for the sale of goods,<ref>''E.g.'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/ Uniform Commercial Code, Article 2, on Contracts for the Sales of Goods]</ref> or the criminal law),<ref>[[Model Penal Code]] as adopted in several states, for example, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/nycodes/c82.html New York's Penal Law]</ref> legislature-enacted statutes generally give only terse statements of general principle, and the fine boundaries and definitions exist only in the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|interstitial common law]]. To find out what the precise law is that applies to a particular set of facts, one has to locate [[precedent]]ial decisions on the topic, and reason from those decisions by [[analogy]].\n\nIn ([[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|common law jurisdictions (in the sense opposed to \"civil law\")]], legislatures operate under the assumption that [[statute]]s will be interpreted against the backdrop of the pre-existing common law. As the United States Supreme Court explained in ''United States v Texas'', 507 U.S. 529 (1993):\n\n:Just as longstanding is the principle that \"[s]tatutes which invade the common law ... are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.\" ''Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson'', 343 U.S. 779, 783 (1952); ''Astoria Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Solimino'', 501 U.S. 104, 108 (1991). In such cases, Congress does not write upon a clean slate. ''Astoria'', 501 U.S. at 108. In order to abrogate a common-law principle, the statute must \"speak directly\" to the question addressed by the common law. ''Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham'', 436 U. S. 618, 625 (1978); ''Milwaukee v. Illinois'', 451 U. S. 304, 315 (1981).\n\nFor example, in most U.S. states, the criminal statutes are primarily codification of pre-existing common law. ([[Codification (law)|Codification]] is the process of enacting a statute that collects and restates pre-existing law in a single document\u2014when that pre-existing law is common law, the common law remains relevant to the interpretation of these statutes.) In reliance on this assumption, modern statutes often leave a number of terms and fine distinctions unstated\u2014for example, a statute might be very brief, leaving the precise definition of terms unstated, under the assumption that these fine distinctions will be inherited from pre-existing common law. (For this reason, many modern American law schools teach the common law of crime as it stood in England in 1789, because that centuries-old English common law is a necessary foundation to interpreting modern criminal statutes.)\n\nWith the transition from English law, which had common law crimes, to the new legal system under the [[U.S. Constitution]], which prohibited [[ex post facto law|''ex post facto'' laws]] at both the federal and state level, the question was raised whether there could be common law crimes in the United States. It was settled in the case of [[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin|''United States v. Hudson'']],<ref name=\"USvHudson\">[[United States v. Hudson and Goodwin|''United States v. Hudson'']], {{ussc|11|32|1812}}</ref> which decided that federal courts had no jurisdiction to define new common law crimes, and that there must always be a (constitutional) statute defining the offense and the penalty for it.\n\nStill, many states retain selected common law crimes. For example, in Virginia, the definition of the conduct that constitutes the crime of robbery exists only in the common law, and the robbery statute only sets the punishment.<ref>''Johnson v. Commonwealth'', 209 Va. 291, 293, 163 S.E.2d 570, ___ (1968)</ref> [[Code of Virginia|Virginia Code]] section 1-200 establishes the continued existence and vitality of common law principles and provides that \"The common law of England, insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly.\"\n\nBy contrast to statutory codification of common law, some statutes displace common law, for example to create a new [[cause of action]] that did not exist in the common law, or to legislatively overrule the common law. An example is the [[tort]] of [[wrongful death]], which allows certain persons, usually a spouse, child or [[estate (law)|estate]], to sue for damages on behalf of the deceased. There is no such tort in English common law; thus, any jurisdiction that lacks a wrongful death statute will not allow a lawsuit for the wrongful death of a loved one. Where a wrongful death statute exists, the compensation or other remedy available is limited to the remedy specified in the statute (typically, an upper limit on the amount of damages). Courts generally interpret statutes that create new causes of action narrowly\u2014that is, limited to their precise terms\u2014because the courts generally recognize the legislature as being supreme in deciding the reach of judge-made law unless such statute should violate some \"second order\" constitutional law provision (''cf''. [[judicial activism]]).\n\nWhere a tort is rooted in common law, all traditionally recognized damages for that tort may be sued for, whether or not there is mention of those [[damages]] in the current statutory law. For instance, a person who sustains bodily injury through the [[negligence]] of another may sue for medical costs, pain, suffering, loss of earnings or earning capacity, mental and/or emotional distress, loss of [[quality of life]], disfigurement and more. These damages need not be set forth in statute as they already exist in the tradition of common law. However, without a wrongful death statute, most of them are extinguished upon death.\n\nIn the United States, the power of the federal judiciary to review and invalidate unconstitutional acts of the federal executive branch is stated in the constitution, Article III sections 1 and 2: \"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. ... The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority...\" The first [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark decision]] on \"the judicial power\" was ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', {{ussc|5|137|1803|Cranch|1}}. Later cases interpreted the \"judicial power\" of Article III to establish the power of federal courts to consider or overturn any action of Congress or of any state that conflicts with the Constitution.\n\nThe interactions between decisions of different courts is discussed further in the article on [[precedent]].\n\n=== Overruling precedent\u2014the limits of ''stare decisis'' ===\nThe [[Common law#United States federal system (1789 and 1938)|United States federal courts]] are divided into twelve regional circuits, each with a [[United States courts of appeals|circuit court of appeals]] (plus a thirteenth, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals in patent cases and cases against the federal government, without geographic limitation). Decisions of one circuit court are binding on the district courts within the circuit and on the circuit court itself, but are only persuasive authority on sister circuits. District court decisions are not binding precedent at all, only persuasive.\n\nMost of the U.S. federal courts of appeal have adopted a rule under which, in the event of any conflict in decisions of panels (most of the courts of appeal almost always sit in panels of three), the earlier panel decision is controlling, and a panel decision may only be overruled by the court of appeals sitting ''en banc'' (that is, all active judges of the court) or by a higher court.<ref>''E.g.'', ''South Corp. v. United States'', 690 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1982) (''en banc'' in relevant part) (explaining order of precedent binding on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit); ''Bonner v. City of Prichard, Alabama'', 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981) (''en banc'') (after the Eleventh Circuit was split off from the Fifth Circuit, adopting precedent of Fifth Circuit as binding until overruled by the Eleventh Circuit ''en banc'': \"The [pre-split] Fifth followed the absolute rule that a prior decision of the circuit (panel or ''en banc'') could not be overruled by a panel but only by the court sitting ''en banc''. The Eleventh Circuit decides in this case that it chooses, and will follow, this rule.\"); ''Ex parte Holt'', 19 USPQ2d 1211, 1214 (Bd. Patent App. & Interf. 1991) (explaining the hierarchy of precedent binding on tribunals of the United States Patent Office).</ref> In these courts, the older decision remains controlling when an issue comes up the third time.\n\nOther courts, for example, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Supreme Court, always sit ''en banc'', and thus the ''later'' decision controls. These courts essentially overrule all previous cases in each new case, and older cases survive only to the extent they do not conflict with newer cases. The interpretations of these courts\u2014for example, Supreme Court interpretations of the constitution or federal statutes\u2014are stable only so long as the older interpretation maintains the support of a majority of the court. Older decisions persist through some combination of belief that the old decision is right, and that it is not sufficiently wrong to be overruled.\n\nIn the UK, since 2009, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] has the authority to overrule and unify decisions of lower courts. From 1966 to 2009, this [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|power]] lay with the [[House of Lords]], granted by the Practice Statement of 1966.<ref>83 Cr App R 191, 73 Cr App R 266</ref>\n\nCanada's federal system, described [[Common law#CL Canada federal|below]], avoids regional variability of federal law by giving national jurisdiction to both layers of appellate courts.\n\n=== Common law as a foundation for commercial economies ===\n\nThe reliance on judicial opinion is a strength of common law systems, and is a significant contributor to the robust commercial systems in the United Kingdom and United States. Because there is reasonably precise guidance on almost every issue, parties (especially commercial parties) can predict whether a proposed course of action is likely to be lawful or unlawful, and have some assurance of consistency. As [[Justice Brandeis]] famously expressed it, \"in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.\"<ref>''Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co.'', 285 U.S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).</ref> This ability to predict gives more freedom to come close to the boundaries of the law.<ref>See, e.g., Yeo Tiong Min, \"[http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/SomeDifferences.html A Note on Some Differences in English Law, New York Law, and Singapore Law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502093747/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/content/SomeDifferences.html |date=2007-05-02 }}\" (2006).</ref> For example, many commercial contracts are more economically efficient, and create greater wealth, because the parties know ahead of time that the proposed arrangement, though perhaps close to the line, is almost certainly legal. Newspapers, taxpayer-funded entities with some religious affiliation, and political parties can obtain fairly clear guidance on the boundaries within which their [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] rights apply.\n\nIn contrast, in jurisdictions with very weak respect for precedent,<ref>for example, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] issues very few of its decisions in precedential form, Kate Gaudry & Thomas Franklin, Only 1 in 20,631 ex parte appeals designated precedential by PTAB, IPWatchdog (Sep. 27, 2015), and various lower tribunals in the Patent Office give very weak respect to earlier superior decisions.</ref> fine [[Question of law|questions of law]] are redetermined anew each time they arise, making consistency and prediction more difficult, and procedures far more protracted than necessary because parties cannot rely on written statements of law as reliable guides. In jurisdictions that do not have a strong allegiance to a large body of precedent, parties have less ''a priori'' guidance (unless the written law is very clear and kept updated) and must often leave a bigger \"safety margin\" of unexploited opportunities, and final determinations are reached only after far larger expenditures on legal fees by the parties.\n\nThis is the reason<ref name=\"EisenbergMillerNewYork\" /> for the frequent choice of the law of the State of New York in commercial contracts, even when neither entity has extensive contacts with New York\u2014and remarkably often even when neither party has contacts with the United States.<ref name=\"EisenbergMillerNewYork\">Theodore Eisenberg & Geoffrey P. Miller, The Flight to New York: An Empirical Study of Choice of Law and Choice of Forum Clauses in {{Sic|hide=y|Publicly|-}}Held Companies\u2019 Contracts (2008).

Paper 124, http://lsr.nellco.org/nyu_lewp/124 (based on a survey of 2882 contracts, \"New York law plays a role for major corporate contracts similar to the role Delaware law plays in the limited setting of corporate governance disputes. ... New York's dominance is striking. It is the choice of law in approximately 46 percent of contracts,\" and if merger contracts excluded, over half)</ref> Commercial contracts almost always include a \"choice of law clause\" to reduce uncertainty. Somewhat surprisingly, contracts throughout the world (for example, contracts involving parties in Japan, France and Germany, and from most of the other states of the United States) often choose the law of New York, even where the relationship of the parties and transaction to New York is quite attenuated. Because of its history as the United States' commercial center, New York common law has a depth and predictability not (yet) available in any other jurisdictions of the United States. Similarly, American corporations are often formed under Delaware [[Corporations law|corporate law]], and American contracts relating to corporate law issues ([[Mergers and acquisitions|merger and acquisitions]] of companies, rights of shareholders, and so on.) include a Delaware [[choice of law]] clause, because of the deep body of law in Delaware on these issues.<ref>Eisenberg & Miller at 19\u201320 (Delaware is chosen in about 15% of contracts, \"Delaware dominates for one type of contract\u2014[merger] trust agreements. ... The dominance of Delaware for this specialized type of contract is apparently due to the advantages and flexibility which Delaware's business trust statute.\")</ref> On the other hand, some other jurisdictions have sufficiently developed bodies of law so that parties have no real motivation to choose the law of a foreign jurisdiction (for example, England and Wales, and the state of California), but not yet so fully developed that parties with no relationship to the jurisdiction choose that law.<ref>Eisenberg & Miller at 19, only about 5% of commercial contracts designate California choice of law, where nearly 50% designate New York.</ref> Outside the United States, parties that are in different jurisdictions from each other often choose the law of England and Wales, particularly when the parties are each in former British colonies and members of the Commonwealth. The common theme in all cases is that commercial parties seek predictability and simplicity in their contractual relations, and frequently choose the law of a common law jurisdiction with a well-developed body of common law to achieve that result.\n\nLikewise, for litigation of commercial disputes arising out of unpredictable torts (as opposed to the prospective choice of law clauses in contracts discussed in the previous paragraph), certain jurisdictions attract an unusually high fraction of cases, because of the predictability afforded by the depth of decided cases. For example, [[London]] is considered the pre-eminent centre for litigation of [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] cases.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-becomes-litigation-capital-of-the-world-1031231.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Richard | last=Osley | title=London becomes litigation capital of the world | date=2008-11-23}}. London is also forum for many defamation cases, because UK law is more plaintiff-friendly\u2014in the United States, the First Amendment protection for freedom of the press allows for statements concerning public figures of questionable veracity, where in the UK, those same statements support a judgment for libel.</ref>\n\nThis is not to say that common law is better in every situation. For example, civil law can be clearer than case law when the legislature has had the foresight and diligence to address the precise set of facts applicable to a particular situation. For that reason, civil law statutes tend to be somewhat more detailed than statutes written by common law legislatures\u2014but, conversely, that tends to make the statute more difficult to read (the United States tax code is an example).<ref>U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Taxpayer Advocate Service, 2008 Report to Congress, https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/08_tas_arc_msp_1.pdf</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|English law}}\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe common law{{mdash}}so named because it was \"common\" to all the king's courts across England{{mdash}}originated in the practices of the courts of the English kings in the centuries following the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066.{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  Prior to the Norman Conquest, much of England's legal business took place in the local folk courts of its various [[shires]] and [[Hundred (county division)|hundreds]].{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  A variety of other individual courts also existed across the land: urban boroughs and merchant fairs held their own courts, as did the [[University of Oxford|universities of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and large landholders also held their own manorial and seigniorial courts as needed.{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}  Additionally, the [[Catholic Church]] operated its own court system that adjudicated issues of [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]].{{sfnp|Langbein|Lerner|Smith|2009|p=4}}\n\nThe main sources for the history of the common law in the Middle Ages are the [[plea rolls]] and the [[Year Books]].

The type of [[legal procedure|procedure]] practiced in common law courts is known as the [[adversarial system]]; this is also a development of the common law.\n\n=== Medieval English common law ===\n\nThe early development of case-law in the thirteenth century has been traced to [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton's]] ''On the Laws and Customs of England'' and led to the yearly compilations of court cases known as [[Year Books]], of which the first extant was published in 1268, the same year that Bracton died.<ref>[[Theodore Plucknett|T.

Among many achievements, Henry institutionalized common law by creating a unified system of law \"common\" to the country through incorporating and elevating local custom to the national, ending local control and peculiarities, eliminating arbitrary remedies and reinstating a [[jury]] system\u2014citizens sworn on oath to investigate reliable criminal accusations and civil claims. The jury reached its [[verdict]] through evaluating common [[Traditional knowledge|local knowledge]], not necessarily through the presentation of [[evidence (law)|evidence]], a distinguishing factor from today's civil and criminal court systems.\n\nHenry II developed the practice of sending judges from his own central court to hear the various disputes throughout the country. His judges would resolve disputes on an [[ad hoc]] basis according to what they interpreted the customs to be. The king's judges would then return to London and often discuss their cases and the decisions they made with the other judges. These decisions would be recorded and filed. In time, a rule, known as ''stare decisis'' (also commonly known as precedent) developed, whereby a judge would be bound to follow the decision of an earlier judge; he was required to adopt the earlier judge's interpretation of the law and apply the same principles promulgated by that earlier judge if the two cases had similar facts to one another. Once judges began to regard each other's decisions to be binding precedent, the pre-Norman system of local customs and law varying in each locality was replaced by a system that was (at least in theory, though not always in practice) common throughout the whole country, hence the name \"common law\".\n\nHenry II's creation of a powerful and unified court system, which curbed somewhat the power of [[canon law|canonical]] (church) courts, brought him (and England) into conflict with the church, most famously with [[Thomas Becket]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The murder of the Archbishop gave rise to a wave of popular outrage against the King. Henry was forced to repeal the disputed laws and to abandon his efforts to hold church members accountable for secular crimes (see also [[Constitutions of Clarendon]]).\n\nThe English [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] was established after [[Magna Carta]] to try lawsuits between commoners in which the monarch had no interest. Its judges sat in open court in the Great Hall of the king's [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Palace of Westminster]], permanently except in the vacations between the four terms of the [[Legal year]].\n\nJudge-made common law operated as the primary source of law for several hundred years, before [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] acquired legislative powers to create [[statutory law]]. It is important to understand that common law is the older and more traditional source of law, and legislative power is simply a layer applied on top of the older common law foundation. Since the 12th century, courts have had parallel and co-equal authority to make law<ref name=\"William Burnham 2006\">William Burnham, ''Introduction to the Law and Legal System of the United States'', 4th ed. (St. Paul, Thomson West, 2006), 42.</ref>\u2014\"legislating from the bench\" is a traditional and essential function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the \"judicial power\" specified by Article III of the U.S. constitution.<ref name=\"GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute\" /> Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] summarized centuries of history in 1917, \"judges do and must legislate.\"<ref name=\"HolmesSouthernPacificLegislate\">''Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen'', 244 U.S. 205, 221 (1917) (Holmes, J., dissenting).</ref> There are legitimate debates on how the powers of courts and legislatures should be balanced. However, the view that courts lack law-making power is historically inaccurate and constitutionally unsupportable.\n\nIn England, judges have devised a number of rules as to [[Mechanisms of the English common law|how to deal with precedent decisions]].\n\n=== Influence of Roman law ===\nThe term \"common law\" is often used as a contrast to Roman-derived \"civil law\", and the fundamental processes and forms of reasoning in the two are quite different. Nonetheless, there has been considerable cross-fertilization of ideas, while the two traditions and sets of foundational principles remain distinct.\n\nBy the time of the rediscovery of the [[Roman law]] in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, the common law had already developed far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent.<ref>E.g., R. C. van Caenegem, ''The Birth of the English Common Law'' 89\u201392 (1988).</ref> However, the first common law scholars, most notably [[Ranulf de Glanvill|Glanvill]] and [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]], as well as the early royal common law judges, had been well accustomed with Roman law. Often, they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law.<ref>E.g., [[Peter Birks]], Grant McLeod, ''Justinian's Institutes'' 7 (1987).</ref> One of the first and throughout its history one of the most significant treatises of the common law, Bracton's ''De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae'' (On the Laws and Customs of England), was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian's ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Institutes]]''.<ref>E.g., George E. Woodbine (ed.), Samuel E. Thorne (transl.), ''Bracton on the Laws and Customs of England'', Vol. I (Introduction) 46 (1968); Carl G\u00fcterbock, ''Bracton and his Relation to the Roman Law'' 35\u201338 (1866).</ref> The impact of Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton, but the Roman divisions of actions into ''[[in rem]]'' (typically, actions against a ''thing'' or property for the purpose of gaining title to that property; must be filed in a court where the property is located) and ''[[in personam]]'' (typically, actions directed against a person; these can affect a person's rights and, since a person often owns things, his property too) used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th centuries. Signs of this can be found in Blackstone's ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'',<ref>Stephen P. Buhofer, ''Structuring the Law: The Common Law and the Roman Institutional System'', Swiss Review of International and European Law (SZIER/RSDIE) 5/2007, 24.</ref> and Roman law ideas regained importance with the revival of academic law schools in the 19th century.<ref>Peter Stein, ''Continental Influences on English Legal thought, 1600\u20131900'', ''in'' Peter Stein, ''The Character and Influence of the Roman Civil Law'' 223 ''et seq''. (1988).</ref> As a result, today, the main systematic divisions of the law into property, contract, and tort (and to some extent [[unjust enrichment]]) can be found in the civil law as well as in the common law.<ref>See generally Stephen P. Buhofer, ''Structuring the Law: The Common Law and the Roman Institutional System'', Swiss Review of International and European Law (SZIER/RSDIE) 5/2007.</ref>\n\n=== Coke and Blackstone ===\n\nThe first attempt at a comprehensive compilation of centuries of common law was by Lord Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]], in his treatise, ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'' in the 17th century.\n\nThe next definitive historical treatise on the common law is ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', written by Sir [[William Blackstone]] and first published in 1765\u20131769.\n\n=== Propagation of the common law to the colonies and Commonwealth by reception statutes ===\n\n{{anchor|CL_Reception_Statutes}}A [[reception statute]] is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes independent, by which the new nation adopts (i.e. receives) pre-independence common law, to the extent not explicitly rejected by the [[legislative body]] or [[constitution]] of the new nation. Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, and the precedent originating from it, as the default law, because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state. All U.S. states, with the partial exception of [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]], have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the common law by judicial opinion.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wl3KFBnC0P0C Thinking like a lawyer: an introduction to legal reasoning] (Westview Press, 1996), pg. 10</ref>\n\nOther examples of reception statutes in the United States, the states of the U.S., Canada and its provinces, and Hong Kong, are discussed in the [[reception statute]] article.\n\nYet, adoption of the common law in the newly-independent nation was not a foregone conclusion, and was controversial. Immediately after the American Revolution, there was widespread distrust and hostility to anything British, and the common law was no exception.<ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil /> Jeffersonians decried lawyers and their common law tradition as threats to the new republic. The Jeffersonians preferred a legislatively-enacted civil law under the control of the political process, rather than the common law developed by judges that\u2014by design\u2014were insulated from the political process. The Federalists believed that the common law was the birthright of Independence: after all, the natural rights to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" were the rights protected by common law. Even advocates for the common law approach noted that it was not an ideal fit for the newly-independent colonies: judges and lawyers alike were severely hindered by a lack of printed legal materials. Before Independence, the most comprehensive law libraries had been maintained by Tory lawyers, and those libraries vanished with the loyalist expatriation, and the ability to print books was limited. Lawyer (later president) John Adams complained that he \"suffered very much for the want of books\". To bootstrap this most basic need of a common law system\u2014knowable, written law\u2014in 1803, lawyers in Massachusetts donated their books to found a law library.<ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil />  A Jeffersonian newspaper criticized the library, as it would carry forward \"all the old authorities practiced in England for centuries back ... whereby a new system of jurisprudence [will be founded] on the high monarchical system [to] become the Common Law of this Commonwealth... [The library] may hereafter have a very unsocial purpose.\"<ref name=BostonSocialLawCommonOrCivil />\n\n=== Decline of Latin maxims and \"blind imitation of the past\", and adding flexibility to ''stare decisis'' {{Anchor|History_and_Holmes}} ===\nWell into the 19th century, ancient maxims played a large role in common law adjudication. Many of these maxims had originated in Roman Law, migrated to England before the introduction of Christianity to the British Isles, and were typically stated in Latin even in English decisions. Many examples are familiar in everyday speech even today, \"[[Nemo iudex in causa sua|One cannot be a judge in one's own cause]]\" (see [[Dr. Bonham's Case]]), rights are reciprocal to obligations, and the like. Judicial decisions and treatises of the 17th and 18th centuries, such at those of Lord Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]], presented the common law as a collection of such maxims.\n\nReliance on old maxims and rigid adherence to precedent, no matter how old or ill-considered, came under critical discussion in the late 19th century, starting in the United States. [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] in his famous article, \"The Path of the Law\",<ref>{{cite journal|volume=10 |journal=Harvard Law Review |pages=457, 469 |year=1897|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2373|title=The Path of the Law|first=Oliver Wendell |last=Holmes, Jr.|doi=10.2307/1322028|issue=8}}</ref> commented, \"It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.\" Justice Holmes noted that study of maxims might be sufficient for \"the man of the present\", but \"the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics\". In an 1880 lecture at Harvard, he wrote:<ref>[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]] [https://archive.org/details/commonlaw00holmuoft O. W. Holmes, Jr., ''The Common Law'']</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow men, have had a good deal more to do than the [[:w:syllogism|syllogism]] in determining the rules by which men should be governed. The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the [[:w:axiom|axioms]] and corollaries of a book of mathematics.</blockquote>\n\nIn the early 20th century, [[Louis Brandeis]], later appointed to the United States Supreme Court, became noted for his use of policy-driving facts and economics in [[Brandeis Brief|his briefs]], and extensive appendices presenting facts that lead a judge to the advocate's conclusion. By this time, briefs relied more on facts than on Latin maxims.\n\nReliance on old maxims is now deprecated.<ref>''Acree v. Republic of Iraq'', 370 F.3d 41 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (Roberts, J., concurring).</ref> Common law decisions today reflect both precedent and policy judgment drawn from economics, the social sciences, business, decisions of foreign courts, and the like. The degree to which these external factors ''should'' influence adjudication is the subject of active debate, but it is indisputable that judges ''do'' draw on experience and learning from everyday life, from other fields, and from other jurisdictions.<ref>[[Roper v.

Please edit redirect if changing the name of this section header -->\nAs early as the 15th century, it became the practice that litigants who felt they had been cheated by the common law system would petition the King in person. For example, they might argue that an award of damages (at [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]]) was not sufficient redress for a trespasser occupying their land, and instead request that the trespasser be evicted. From this developed the system of [[Equity (law)|equity]], administered by the [[Lord Chancellor]], in the courts of [[Court of equity|chancery]]. By their nature, equity and law were frequently in conflict and litigation would frequently continue for years as one court countermanded the other,<ref>{{harvnb|Salmond|1907|p=34}}</ref> even though it was established by the 17th century that equity should prevail.\n\nIn England, courts of law ([[Common law#Disambiguate equity|as opposed to equity]]) were combined with [[Court of equity|courts of equity]] by the [[Judicature Acts]] of 1873 and 1875, with equity prevailing in case of conflict.<ref>Lobban, Michael \"Preparing for Fusion: Reforming the Nineteenth-Century Court of Chancery, Part II | year=2004 | work=Law and History Review, 2004 (University of Illinois Press) . {{ISSN|0738-2480}}.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, parallel systems of [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] (providing money [[damages]], with cases heard by a jury upon either party's request) and equity (fashioning a remedy to fit the situation, including injunctive relief, heard by a judge) survived well into the 20th century. The [[United States federal courts]] procedurally separated law and equity: the same judges could hear either kind of case, but a given case could only pursue causes in law or in equity, and the two kinds of cases proceeded under different procedural rules. This became problematic when a given case required both money damages and injunctive relief. In 1937, the new [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] combined [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|law]] and equity into one form of action, the \"civil action\". Fed.R.Civ.P. {{frcp|2}}. The distinction survives to the extent that issues that were \"[[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]]\" as of 1791 (the date of adoption of the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]]) are still subject to the right of either party to request a jury, and \"equity\" issues are decided by a judge.<ref>''E.g.'', ''Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.'', 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996) (\"[W]e [the U.S. Supreme Court] have understood that the right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right which existed under the English [[Common law#Disambiguate equity|common law (as opposed to equity)]] when the Amendment was adopted.

In many [[U.S. state|states]] there are separate divisions for law and equity within one court.\n\n=== Common law pleading and its abolition in the early 20th century ===\n\nFor centuries, through the 19th century, the common law recognized only specific [[Form of action|forms of action]], and required very careful drafting of the opening pleading (called a [[writ]]) to slot into exactly one of them: Debt, Detinue, Covenant, Special Assumpsit, General Assumpsit, Trespass, Trover, Replevin, Case (or Trespass on the Case), and Ejectment.<ref>F. W. Maitland, ''The Forms of Action at Common Law'', 1909, Lecture I, online [https://legacy.fordham.edu/Halsall/basis/maitland-formsofaction.asp] or John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common Law Pleading (1894) or [[James Barr Ames|Ames]], [[Joseph Chitty|Chitty]], [[Henry John Stephen|Stephen]], [[James Bradley Thayer|Thayer]] and other writers named in the preface of Perry's ''Common-law Pleading: its history and principles'' (Boston, 1897)[http://www.lawfulpath.com/ref/commonlawpleadin00perr.pdf] or [https://kateofgaia.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/handbook-of-common-law-pleadings1.pdf ''Handbook of Common Law Pleading, Koffler and Reppy, 1969, online'']</ref> To initiate a lawsuit, a pleading had to be drafted to meet myriad technical requirements: correctly categorizing the case into the correct legal pigeonhole (pleading in the alternative was not permitted), and using specific \"magic words\" encrusted over the centuries. Under the old common law pleading standards, a suit by a ''pro se'' (\"for oneself,\" without a lawyer) party was all but impossible, and there was often considerable procedural jousting at the outset of a case over minor wording issues.\n\nOne of the major reforms of the late 19th century and early 20th century was the abolition of common law pleading requirements.<ref>Note that the remainder of the \"common law\" discussed in the rest of the article remained intact; all that was abolished were the highly technical requirements for language of the paper provided by the plaintiff to the defendant to initiate a case.</ref> A plaintiff can initiate a case by giving the defendant \"a short and plain statement\" of facts that constitute an alleged wrong.<ref>''E.g.'', Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 4, a complaint must contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\"</ref> This reform moved the attention of courts from technical scrutiny of words to a more rational consideration of the facts, and opened access to justice far more broadly.<ref>''E.g.'', Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 1, civil procedure rules \"should be construed, administered, and employed by the court and the parties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.\"</ref>\n\n== Alternatives to common law systems ==\n\n=== Civil law systems--comparisons and contrasts to common law{{anchor|Contrasts between common law and civil law systems}} ===\n[[File:Corpus Iuris Civilis 02.jpg|thumb|A 16th century edition of ''Corpus Juris Civilis Romani'' (1583)]]\n\nThe main alternative to the common law system is the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, which is used in [[Continental Europe]], and most of the rest of the world.\n\n==== Judicial decisions play only a minor role in shaping civil law ====\nThe primary contrast between the two systems is the role of written decisions and precedent.\n\nIn common law jurisdictions, nearly every case that presents a ''bona fide'' disagreement on the law is resolved in a written opinion. The legal reasoning for the decision, known as ''[[ratio decidendi]]'', not only determines the court's judgment between the parties, but also stands as precedent for resolving future disputes. In contrast, civil law decisions typically do not include explanatory opinions,and thus no precedent flows from one decision to the next.<ref>Potter, H. Law, Liberty and the Constitution: A Brief History of the common Law (2018)</ref>\nIn common law systems, a single decided case is binding [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law (connotation 1)]] to the same extent as statute or regulation, under the principle of ''stare decisis''. In contrast, in civil law systems, individual decisions have only advisory, not binding effect. In civil law systems, case law only acquires weight when a long series of cases use consistent reasoning, called ''[[jurisprudence constante]]''. Civil law lawyers consult case law to obtain their best prediction of how a court will rule, but comparatively, civil law judges are less bound to follow it.\n\nFor that reason, statutes in civil law systems are more comprehensive, detailed, and continuously updated, covering all matters capable of being brought before a court.<ref>''The Common Law and Civil Law Traditions'', Robbins Collection, University of California at Berkeley.[https://www.law.berkeley.edu/library/robbins/CommonLawCivilLawTraditions.html]</ref>\n\n==== Adversarial system vs. inquisitorial system ====\n[[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|Common law systems]] tend to give more weight to separation of powers between the judicial branch and the executive branch. In contrast, civil law systems are typically more tolerant of allowing individual officials to exercise both powers.  One example of this contrast is the difference between the two systems in allocation of responsibility between prosecutor and adjudicator.<ref name=\"LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial\">{{cite web|url=https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/constitutional-law/inquisitorial-and-adversarial-system-of-law-constitutional-law-essay.php|title=Inquisitorial And Adversarial System Of Law|website=lawteacher.net}}</ref><ref name=\"PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory\">{{cite web|url=http://compass.port.ac.uk/UoP/file/c7ffec37-0632-475f-84ba-ae018a2f0f38/1/Types_of_law_IMSLRN.zip/page_10.htm|title=Types of Legal System: Adversarial v. Investigatory Trial Systems|first=|last=LangstoT|website=compass.port.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nCommon law courts usually use an [[adversarial system]], in which two sides present their cases to a neutral judge.<ref name=\"LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial\" /><ref name=\"PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory\" /> In contrast, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, criminal proceedings proceed under an [[inquisitorial system]] in which an examining magistrate serves two roles by developing the evidence and arguments for one side and then the other during the investigation phase.<ref name=\"LawteacherInquisitorialAdversarial\" /><ref name=\"PortsmouthAdversarialInquisitory\" />\n\nThe examining magistrate then presents the dossier detailing his or her findings to the president of the bench that will adjudicate on the case where it has been decided that a trial shall be conducted. Therefore, the president of the bench's view of the case is not neutral and may be biased while conducting the trial after the reading of the dossier. Unlike the common law proceedings, the president of the bench in the inquisitorial system is not merely an umpire and is entitled to directly interview the witnesses or express comments during the trial, as long as he or she does not express his or her view on the guilt of the accused.\n\nThe proceeding in the inquisitorial system is essentially by writing. Most of the witnesses would have given evidence in the investigation phase and such evidence will be contained in the dossier under the form of police reports. In the same way, the accused would have already put his or her case at the investigation phase but he or she will be free to change her or his evidence at trial. Whether the accused pleads guilty or not, a trial will be conducted. Unlike the adversarial system, the conviction and sentence to be served (if any) will be released by the trial jury together with the president of the trial bench, following their common deliberation.\n\nThere are many exceptions in both directions. For example, most proceedings before U.S. federal and state agencies are inquisitorial in nature, at least the initial stages (''e.g.'', a patent examiner, a social security hearing officer, and so on), even though the law to be applied is developed through common law processes.\n\n==== Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems{{anchor|CL academic writings}} ====\nThe role of the legal academy presents a significant \"cultural\" difference between common law ([[Common law#Disambiguate civil law|connotation 2]]) and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions.  In both systems, treatises compile decisions and state overarching principles that (in the author's opinion) explain the results of the cases.  In neither system are treatises considered \"law,\" but the weight given them is nonetheless quite different.\n\nIn common law jurisdictions, lawyers and judges tend to use these treatises as only \"finding aids\" to locate the relevant cases. In common law jurisdictions, scholarly work is seldom cited as authority for what the law is.<ref>At least in the U.S., practicing lawyers tend to use \"law professor\" or \"law review article\" as a pejorative to describe a person or work that is insufficiently grounded in reality or practicality\u2014every young lawyer is admonished repeatedly by senior lawyers not to write \"law review articles,\" but instead to focus on the facts of the case and the practical effects of a given outcome.</ref>  Chief Justice Roberts noted the \"great disconnect between the academy and the profession.\"<ref>A Conversation with Chief Justice Roberts, June 11, 2011 [https://www.c-span.org/video/?300203-1/conversation-chief-justice-roberts] at 30:30.</ref> When common law courts rely on scholarly work, it is almost always only for factual findings, policy justification, or the [[Legal history|history and evolution of the law]], but the court's legal conclusion is reached through analysis of relevant statutes and common law, seldom scholarly commentary.\n\nIn contrast, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, courts give the writings of [[law school|law professors]] significant weight, partly because civil law decisions traditionally were very brief, sometimes no more than a paragraph stating who wins and who loses. The rationale had to come from somewhere else: the academy often filled that role.\n\n==== Narrowing of differences between common law and civil law ====\nThe contrast between civil law and common law legal systems has become increasingly blurred, with the growing importance of [[jurisprudence]] (similar to [[case law]] but not binding) in civil law countries, and the growing importance of statute law and codes in common law countries.\n\nExamples of common law being replaced by statute or codified rule in the United States include [[Common law offence#United States|criminal law]] (since 1812,<ref name=\"USvHudson\" /> U.S. federal courts and most but not all of the States have held that criminal law must be embodied in statute if the public is to have fair notice), [[commercial law]] (the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] in the early 1960s) and procedure (the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in the 1930s and the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] in the 1970s). But note that in each case, the statute sets the general principles, but the [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|interstitial common law]] process determines the scope and application of the statute.\n\nAn example of convergence from the other direction is shown in the 1982 decision ''Srl CILFIT and Lanificio di Gavardo SpA v Ministry of Health'' ({{ECLI|ECLI:EU:C:1982:335}}), in which the [[European Court of Justice]] held that questions it has already answered need not be resubmitted. This showed how a historically distinctly common law principle is used by a court composed of judges (at that time) of essentially civil law jurisdiction.\n\n=== Other alternatives ===\n\nThe former [[Soviet Bloc]] and other Socialist countries used a [[Socialist law]] system.\n\nMuch of the [[Muslim world]] uses [[Sharia]] (also called [[Sharia|Islamic law]]).\n\n== Common law legal systems in the present day ==\n=== In jurisdictions around the world ===\nThe common law constitutes the basis of the legal systems of:\n* [[Law of Australia|Australia]] (both federal and individual states),\n* [[Law of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]],\n* [[Belize]],\n* Brunei,\n* Canada (both [[Common law#CL Canada federal|federal]] and the [[Common law#CL Canada provinces|individual provinces]] (except Quebec)),\n* the Caribbean jurisdictions of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahamas, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago,\n*Ghana,\n* [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]],\n* [[common law#CL India|India]],\n* [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]],\n* [[Israeli law|Israel]],\n* Kenya,\n* [[Law of Malaysia|Malaysia]],\n* Myanmar,\n* [[Law of New Zealand|New Zealand]],\n* [[Common law#CL Pakistan|Pakistan]],\n* [[Law of Singapore|Singapore]],\n* [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]],\n* United Kingdom:\n:* [[English law|England and Wales]],\n:* [[Northern Ireland law|Northern Ireland]],\n* United States (both the [[Common law#CL United States federal|federal]] system and the individual [[Common law#CL United States|states]] (with the partial exception of [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]])),\n\nand many other generally [[English-speaking countries]] or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (except the UK's [[Common law#CL Scotland|Scotland]], which is [[bijuridicial law|bijuridicial]], and [[Malta]]). Essentially, every country that was colonised at some time by England, Great Britain, or the United Kingdom uses common law except those that were formerly colonised by other nations, such as [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]] (which follows the [[bijuridicial law|law]] of France in part), South Africa and Sri Lanka (which follow [[Common law#CL Roman Dutch|Roman Dutch law]]), where the prior civil law system was retained to respect the [[civil rights]] of the local colonists. Guyana and Saint Lucia have mixed Common Law and Civil Law systems.\n\nThe remainder of this section discusses jurisdiction-specific variants, arranged chronologically.\n\n=== Scotland{{anchor|CL Scotland}} ===\n[[Scotland]] is often said to use the civil law system, but it has [[Scots law|a unique system]] that combines elements of an uncodified civil law dating back to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] with an element of its own common law long predating the [[Act of Union (1707)|Treaty of Union]] with England in 1707 (see [[Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages]]), founded on the customary laws of the tribes residing there. Historically, [[Scots Law|Scottish common law]] differed in that the use of ''precedent'' was subject to the courts' seeking to discover the principle that justifies a law rather than searching for an example as a ''precedent'',<ref>Stair Memorial Encyclopedia</ref> and principles of [[natural justice]] and fairness have always played a role in Scots Law. From the 19th century, the Scottish approach to precedent developed into a ''stare decisis'' akin to that already established in England thereby reflecting a narrower, more modern approach to the application of case law in subsequent instances. This is not to say that the substantive rules of the common laws of both countries are the same although in many matters (particularly those of UK-wide interest) they are similar.\n\nScotland shares the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], with England, Wales and Northern Ireland for civil cases; the court's decisions are binding on the jurisdiction from which a case arises but only influential on similar cases arising in Scotland. This has had the effect of converging the law in certain areas. For instance, the modern UK [[negligence|law of negligence]] is based on ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'', a case originating in Paisley, Scotland.\n\nScotland maintains a separate criminal law system from the rest of the UK, with the [[High Court of Justiciary]] being the final court for criminal appeals. The highest court of appeal in civil cases brought in Scotland is now the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (before October 2009, final appellate jurisdiction lay with the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/about/role-of-the-supreme-court.html|title=Role of The Supreme Court \u2013 The Supreme Court|first=The Supreme|last=Court|website=www.supremecourt.uk}}</ref>\n\n=== United States ===\n==== States of the United States (17th century on){{anchor|CL United States}} ====\nThe centuries-old authority of the common law courts in England to develop law case by case and to apply statute law<ref name=\"William Burnham 2006\" />\u2014\"legislating from the bench\"\u2014 is a traditional function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the \"judicial power\" specified by Article III of the U.S. constitution.<ref name=\"GeneralCommonLaw_w_NoStatute\" /> Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] summarized centuries of history in 1917, \"judges do and must legislate\u201d (in the federal courts, only interstitially, in state courts, to the full limits of common law adjudicatory authority).<ref name=\"HolmesSouthernPacificLegislate\" />\n\n===== New York (17th century) =====\nThe state of [[New York (state)|New York]], which also has a civil law history from its [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colonial]] days, began a [[Codification (law)|codification]] of its law in the 19th century. The only part of this codification process that was considered complete is known as the [[Field Code]] applying to [[civil procedure]]. The original colony of [[New Netherland]] was settled by the Dutch and the law was also Dutch. When the English captured pre-existing colonies they continued to allow the local settlers to keep their civil law. However, the Dutch settlers revolted against the English and the colony was [[Second Anglo-Dutch War|recaptured]] by the Dutch. When the English finally regained control of New Netherland they forced, as a punishment unique in the history of the British Empire, the English imposed common law upon all the colonists, including the Dutch. This was problematic, as the [[patroon]] system of land holding, based on the [[Feudalism|feudal system]] and civil law, continued to operate in the colony until it was abolished in the mid-19th century. The influence of [[Roman-Dutch law]] continued in the colony well into the late 19th century. The codification of a law of general obligations shows how remnants of the civil law tradition in New York continued on from the Dutch days.\n\n===== Louisiana (1700s){{anchor|Louisiana (1700s)}} =====\n\nUnder [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana's codified system]], the [[Louisiana Civil Code]], private law\u2014that is, [[substantive law]] between private sector parties\u2014is based on principles of law from continental Europe, with some common law influences. These principles derive ultimately from [[Roman law]], transmitted through [[Law of France|French law]] and [[Law of Spain|Spanish law]], as the state's current territory intersects the area of North America colonized by Spain and by France. Contrary to popular belief, the Louisiana code does not directly derive from the [[Napoleonic Code]], as the latter was enacted in 1804, one year after the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. However, the two codes are similar in many respects due to common roots.\n\nLouisiana's [[criminal law]] largely rests on English common law. Louisiana's [[administrative law]] is generally similar to the [[administrative Procedure Act (United States)|administrative law of the U.S. federal government]] and other U.S. states. Louisiana's [[procedural law]] is generally in line with that of other U.S. states, which in turn is generally based on the U.S. [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].\n\nHistorically notable among the Louisiana code's differences from common law is the role of property rights among women, particularly in inheritance gained by widows.\n\n===== California (1850s) =====\nThe [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] has a system based on common law, but it has [[Codification (law)|codified]] the law in the manner of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. The reason for the enactment of the [[California Codes]] in the 19th century was to replace a pre-existing system based on Spanish civil law with a system based on common law, similar to that in most other states. California and a number of other [[Western United States|Western states]], however, have retained the concept of [[community property]] derived from civil law. The California courts have treated portions of the codes as an extension of the common-law tradition, subject to judicial development in the same manner as judge-made common law. (Most notably, in the case ''[[Li v. Yellow Cab Co.]]'', 13 Cal.3d 804 (1975), the [[California Supreme Court]] adopted the principle of [[comparative negligence]] in the face of a [[California Civil Code]] provision codifying the traditional common-law doctrine of [[contributory negligence]].)\n\n==== United States federal courts (1789 and 1938){{anchor|CL United States federal}} ====\n[[File:Uscatitle11.jpg|thumb|USCA: some annotated volumes of the [[United States Code|official compilation]] and codification of federal statutes.]]\n\nThe United States federal government (as opposed to the states) has a variant on a common law system. [[United States federal courts]] only act as interpreters of statutes and the constitution by elaborating and precisely defining broad statutory language ([[Common law#Disambiguate statute|connotation 1(b)]] above), but, unlike state courts, do not act as an independent source of common law.\n\nBefore 1938, the federal courts, like almost all other common law courts, decided the law on any issue where the relevant legislature (either the U.S. Congress or state legislature, depending on the issue), had not acted, by looking to courts in the same system, that is, other federal courts, even on issues of state law, and even where there was no express grant of authority from Congress or the Constitution.\n\nIn 1938, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins]]'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=304&page=64 304 U.S. 64, 78] (1938), overruled earlier precedent,<ref>''Swift v. Tyson'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=41&page=1 41 U.S. 1] (1842). In ''Swift'', the [[United States Supreme Court]] had held that federal courts hearing cases brought under their [[diversity jurisdiction]] (allowing them to hear cases between parties from different states) had to apply the statutory law of the states, but not the common law developed by state courts. Instead, the Supreme Court permitted the federal courts to make their own common law based on general principles of law. ''Erie v. Tompkins'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=304&page=64 304 U.S. 64] (1938). ''Erie'' overruled ''Swift v. Tyson'', and instead held that federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction had to use all of the same [[substantive law]] as the courts of the states in which they were located. As the ''Erie'' Court put it, there is no \"general federal common law\", the key word here being '''''general'''''. This history is elaborated in\n[[federal common law]].</ref> and held \"There is no federal general common law,\" thus confining the federal courts to act only as interpreters of law originating elsewhere. ''E.g.'', ''Texas Industries v. Radcliff'', {{ussc|451|630|1981}} (without an express grant of statutory authority, federal courts cannot create rules of intuitive justice, for example, a right to contribution from co-conspirators). Post-1938, federal courts deciding issues that arise under state law are required to defer to state court interpretations of state statutes, or reason what a state's highest court would rule if presented with the issue, or to certify the question to the state's highest court for resolution.\n\nLater courts have limited ''Erie'' slightly, to create a few situations where [[United States federal courts]] are permitted to create [[federal common law]] rules without express statutory authority, for example, where a federal rule of decision is necessary to protect uniquely federal interests, such as foreign affairs, or financial instruments issued by the federal government. ''See, e.g.'', ''[[Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|318|363|1943}} (giving federal courts the authority to fashion common law rules with respect to issues of federal power, in this case [[negotiable instrument]]s backed by the federal government); ''see also'' ''[[International News Service v. Associated Press]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=248&page=215 248 U.S. 215] (1918) (creating a cause of action for misappropriation of \"hot news\" that lacks any statutory grounding); ''but see National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc.'', 105 F.3d 841, 843\u201344, 853 (2d Cir. 1997) (noting continued vitality of ''INS'' \"hot news\" tort under New York state law, but leaving open the question of whether it survives under federal law). Except on Constitutional issues, Congress is free to legislatively overrule federal courts' common law.<ref>''City of Boerne v. Flores'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=521&invol=507 521 U.S. 507] (1997) (invalidating the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]], in which Congress had attempted to redefine the court's jurisdiction to decide constitutional issues); ''Milwaukee v. Illinois'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=451&invol=304 451 U.S. 304] (1981)</ref>\n\n==== United States executive branch agencies (1946) ====\nMost executive branch agencies in the United States federal government have some adjudicatory authority. To greater or lesser extent, agencies honor their own precedent to ensure consistent results. Agency decision making is governed by the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] of 1946.\n\nFor example, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] issues relatively few [[regulations]], but instead promulgates most of its substantive rules through [[Common law#Disambiguate statute|common law (connotation 1)]].\n\n=== India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh (19th century and 1948){{anchor|CL India and Pakistan}} ===\nThe law of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are largely based on [[English law|English]] common law because of the long period of [[British Empire|British colonial influence]] during the period of the [[British India|British Raj]].\n\n[[History of India|Ancient India]] represented a distinct tradition of law, and had an historically independent school of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', dating from 400 BCE and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'', from 100 CE, were influential treatises in India, texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=255}}</ref> [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]'s central philosophy was tolerance and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], and was cited across [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Glenn|2000|p=276}}</ref> Early in this period, which finally culminated in the creation of the [[Gupta Empire]], relations with ancient Greece and Rome were not infrequent.

Legislation first introduced by the British is still in effect in modified form today. During the drafting of the [[Indian Constitution]], laws from Ireland, the United States, Britain, and France were all synthesized to produce a refined set of Indian laws. Indian laws also adhere to the [[United Nations]] guidelines on [[human rights law]] and [[environmental law]]. Certain [[international trade law]]s, such as those on [[intellectual property]], are also enforced in India.\n\nThe exception to this rule is in the state of [[Goa]], annexed in stages in the 1960s through 1980s. In Goa, a Portuguese [[uniform civil code]] is in place, in which all religions have a common law regarding marriages, divorces and adoption.\n\n==== Post-partition Pakistan (1948){{anchor|CL Pakistan}} ====\n\nPost-partition, [[Law of Pakistan|Pakistan]] retained its common law system.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/user_files/File/REVIEW_P_46&47_2011_full.pdf |title=Federation of Pakistan v.

The division of [[jurisdiction]] between the federal and provincial Parliaments is specified in the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]].<ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-5.html#anchorbo-ga:s_91-gb:s_91 Constitution Act, 1867], s. 91(10), (18)</ref>\n\n==== Canadian provincial law{{anchor|CL Canada provinces}} ====\n\nEach [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province and territory]] is considered a separate jurisdiction with respect to common law matters. As such, only the provincial legislature may enact legislation to amend private law. Each has its own procedural law, statutorily created provincial courts and superior trial courts with inherent jurisdiction culminating in the Court of Appeal of the province. This is the highest court in provincial jurisdiction, only subject to the Supreme Court of Canada in terms of appeal of their decisions. All but one of the provinces of [[Law of Canada|Canada]] use a common law system (the exception being [[Law of Quebec|Quebec]], which uses a French-heritage civil law system for issues arising within provincial jurisdiction, such as property ownership and contracts).\n\n==== Canadian federal law{{anchor|CL Canada federal}} ====\n\nCanadian Federal Courts operate under a separate system throughout Canada and deal with narrower subject matter than superior courts in provincial jurisdiction. They hear cases reserved for federal jurisdiction by the Canadian constitution, such as immigration, intellectual property, judicial review of federal government decisions, and admiralty. The [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] is the appellate level court in federal jurisdiction and hears cases in multiple cities, and unlike the United States, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal is not divided into appellate circuits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fca-caf.gc.ca/index_e.shtml |title=Federal Court of Appeal \u2013 Home |publisher=Fca-caf.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref>\n\nCriminal law is uniform throughout Canada. It is based on the constitution and federal statutory Criminal Code, as interpreted by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. The administration of justice and enforcement of the criminal code are the responsibilities of the provinces.\n\nCanadian federal statutes must use the terminology of both the common law and civil law for those matters; this is referred to as legislative bijuralism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canada.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/harmonization/bijurilex/aboutb-aproposb.html|title=Department of Justice \u2013 About Bijuralism|first=Government of Canada, Department of Justice, Legislative Services|last=Branch|website=canada.justice.gc.ca}}</ref>\n\n=== Nicaragua ===\n[[Nicaragua]]'s legal system is also a mixture of the English Common Law and Civil Law.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} This situation was brought through the influence of British administration of the Eastern half of the [[Mosquito Coast]] from the mid-17th century until about 1894, the [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] period from about 1855 through 1857, USA interventions/occupations during the period from 1909 to 1933, the influence of USA institutions during the [[Somoza family]] administrations (1933 through 1979) and the considerable importation between 1979 and the present of USA culture and institutions.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n=== Israel (1948){{anchor|CL Israel}} ===\n[[Israeli law|Israel]] has a common law legal system. Its basic principles are inherited from the law of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] and thus resemble those of British and American law, namely: the role of courts in creating the body of law and the authority of the [[Supreme Court of Israel|supreme court]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lawofisrael.com/israeli-supreme-court-decisions | title=Supreme court decisions database}}</ref> in reviewing and if necessary overturning legislative and executive decisions, as well as employing the adversarial system. One of the primary reasons that the [[Constitution of Israel|Israeli constitution]] remains [[unwritten constitution|unwritten]] is the fear by whatever party holds power that creating a written constitution, combined with the common-law elements, would severely limit the powers of the [[Knesset]] (which, following the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], holds near-unlimited power).{{sfn|Mahler|2004|p=126}}\n\n=== Roman Dutch Common law{{anchor|CL Roman Dutch}} ===\n[[Roman Dutch law|Roman Dutch Common law]] is a bijuridical or mixed system of law similar to the common law system in [[Scotland]] and [[Common law#Louisiana (1700s)|Louisiana]]. Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions include [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], [[Namibia]], [[Swaziland]], [[Sri-Lanka]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. Many of these jurisdictions recognise customary law, and in some, such as South Africa the Constitution requires that the common law be developed in accordance with the Bill of Rights. Roman Dutch common law is a development of [[Roman Dutch law]] by courts in the Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions. During the Napoleonic wars the Kingdom of the Netherlands adopted the French ''code civil'' in 1809, however the Dutch colonies in the Cape of Good Hope and Sri Lanka, at the time called Ceylon, were seized by the British to prevent them being used as bases by the French Navy. The system was developed by the courts and spread with the expansion of British colonies in Southern Africa. Roman Dutch common law relies on legal principles set out in Roman law sources such as Justinian's Institutes and Digest, and also on the writing of Dutch jurists of the 17th century such as [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]] and [[Johannes Voet|Voet]]. In practice, the majority of decisions rely on recent precedent.\n\n=== Ghana ===\nGhana follows the English common-law<ref>The common law as used in this paper designates the English common-law as a legal tradition which is made up of law (generally referred to as the common law), and the doctrine of equity.</ref> tradition which was inherited from the British during her colonisation. Consequently, the laws of Ghana are, for the most part, a modified version of imported law that is continuously adapting to changing socio-economic and political realities of the country.<ref>Obiri-Korang P \"Private international law of contract in Ghana: the need for a paradigm shift\" (2017) P 8; Quansah ''The Ghana Legal System'' (2011) P 51</ref> The Bond of 184<ref>The Bond was a pact between the British and some chiefs from the southern states of the Gold Coast under which British protection was extended to the signatories in exchange for judicial authority over them.</ref> 4 was the first most important event in the history of Ghana (then Gold Coast) that marked the critical period when the people ceded their independence to the British<ref>See, generally, Benion ''The Constitutional Law of Ghana'' (1962). Boahen, however, submits that the Bond of 1844 is not as important as held by some Ghanaian historians. He further posits that it cannot be the Mgna Carta of Ghana or the basis for British rule or law \u2013 see Boahen ''Ghana: Evolution and Change in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Century'' (1975) 36.</ref> and gave the British judicial authority. Later, the Supreme Court Ordinance of 1876 \u201cformally\u201d introduced British law, be it the common law or statutory law, in the Gold Coast.<ref>Asante \u201cOver a hundred years of a national legal system in Ghana: a review and critique\u201d 1988 ''Journal of African Law'' 31 70.</ref> Section 14<ref>This states that \u201cthe common law, the doctrines of equity, and Statutes of general application which were in force in England at the date when the colony obtained a local legislature, that is to say, on the 24th of July 1874, shall be in force within the jurisdiction of the court\u201d.</ref> of the Ordinance formalised the application of the common-law tradition in the country.\n\nGhana, after independence, did not do away with the common law system inherited from the British, and today it has been enshrined in the 1992 Constitution of the country. Chapter four of Ghana's Constitution, entitled \u201cThe Laws of Ghana\u201d, has in Article 11(1) the list of laws applicable in the state. This comprises (a) the Constitution; (b) enactments made by or under the authority of the Parliament established by the Constitution; (c) any Orders, Rules and Regulations made by any person or authority under a power conferred by the Constitution; (d) the existing law; and (e) the common law.<ref>According to Article 11(2) of Ghana\u2019s Constitution, the common law of Ghana shall comprise the rule of law generally known as the common law, the rules generally known as the doctrine of equity and the rules of customary law, including those determined by the Superior Court of Judicature.</ref> Thus, the modern-day Constitution of Ghana, like those before it, embraced the English common law by entrenching it in its provisions. The doctrine of judicial precedence which is based on the principle of ''stare decisis'' as applied in England and other pure common law countries also applies in Ghana.\n\n== Scholarly works ==\n[[File:WilliamBlackstone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sir William Blackstone]] as illustrated in his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''.]]\n[[Edward Coke]], a 17th-century Lord Chief Justice of the English Court of Common Pleas and a [[Member of Parliament]], wrote several legal texts that collected and integrated centuries of case law. Lawyers in both England and America learned the law from his ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England|Institutes]]'' and ''Reports'' until the end of the 18th century. His works are still cited by common law courts around the world.\n\nThe next definitive historical treatise on the common law is ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', written by Sir [[William Blackstone]] and first published in 1765\u20131769. Since 1979, a facsimile edition of that first edition has been available in four paper-bound volumes. Today it has been superseded in the English part of the United Kingdom by [[Halsbury's Laws of England]] that covers both common and statutory English law.\n\nWhile he was still on the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], and before being named to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] published a short volume called ''[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]]'', which remains a classic in the field. Unlike Blackstone and the Restatements, Holmes' book only briefly discusses what the law ''is''; rather, Holmes describes the common law ''process''. Law professor [[John Chipman Gray]]'s ''The Nature and Sources of the Law'', an examination and survey of the common law, is also still commonly read in [[Law school in the United States|U.S. law schools]].\n\nIn the United States, [[Restatement of the Law|Restatements]] of various subject matter areas (Contracts, Torts, Judgments, and so on.), edited by the [[American Law Institute]], collect the common law for the area. The ALI Restatements are often cited by American courts and lawyers for propositions of uncodified common law, and are considered highly persuasive authority, just below binding precedential decisions. The [[Corpus Juris Secundum]] is an encyclopedia whose main content is a compendium of the common law and its variations throughout the various state jurisdictions.\n\nScots ''common law'' covers matters including murder and theft, and has sources in custom, in legal writings and previous court decisions. The legal writings used are called ''Institutional Texts'' and come mostly from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Examples include Craig, ''Jus Feudale'' (1655) and Stair, ''The Institutions of the Law of Scotland'' (1681).\n\n== See also ==\n=== Common law national legal systems today ===\n* [[List of national legal systems#Common law|List of Common Law national legal systems]]\n\n=== Common vs. civil laws ===\n* [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]]\n* [[Common law offences]]\n\n=== Development of English legal system and case law ===\n* [[Books of authority]]\n* [[Lists of case law]]\n\n=== Early common law systems ===\n* [[Anglo-Saxon law]]\n* [[Brehon law]], or Irish law\n* [[Doom book]], or Code of [[Alfred the Great]]\n* [[Time immemorial]]\n\n=== Stages of common law trials ===\n* [[Arraignment]]\n* [[Grand jury]]\n* [[Jury trial]]\n\n=== Common law in specific areas ===\n==== Common law as applied to matrimony ====\n* [[Alimony]]\n* [[Common-law marriage]]\n\n==== Slavery ====\n* [[Slavery at common law]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Crane, Elaine Forman (2011), ''Witches, Wife Beaters, and Whores: Common Law and Common Folk in Early America.''

Richard Egel argues that in particular the [[hydrophobic]] (non-polar) side-chains are well organised, suggesting that these enabled the earliest organisms to create [[peptide]]s with water-repelling regions able to support the essential electron exchange ([[redox]]) reactions for energy transfer.<ref name=Egel>{{cite journal |last1=Egel |first1=Richard |title=Primal Eukaryogenesis: On the Communal Nature of Precellular States, Ancestral to Modern Life |journal=Life |date=March 2012 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=170\u2013212 |doi=10.3390/life2010170 |pmc=4187143 |pmid=25382122}}</ref>\n\n===Selectively neutral similarities===\n\nSimilarities which have no adaptive relevance cannot be explained by [[convergent evolution]], and therefore they provide compelling support for universal common descent. Such evidence has come from two areas: [[amino acid]] sequences and DNA sequences. Proteins with the same three-dimensional structure need not have identical amino acid sequences; any irrelevant similarity between the sequences is evidence for common descent. In certain cases, there are several [[Genetic code|codon]]s (DNA triplets) that code redundantly for the same amino acid. Since many species use the same codon at the same place to specify an amino acid that can be represented by more than one codon, that is evidence for their sharing a recent common ancestor. Had the amino acid sequences come from different ancestors, they would have been coded for by any of the redundant codons, and since the correct amino acids would already have been in place, [[natural selection]] would not have driven any change in the codons, however much time was available. [[Genetic drift]] could change the codons, but it would be extremely unlikely to make all the redundant codons in a whole sequence match exactly across multiple lineages. Similarly, shared nucleotide sequences, especially where these are apparently neutral such as the positioning of [[intron]]s and [[pseudogene]]s, provide strong evidence of common ancestry.<ref name=\"Sharma2005\">{{cite book |last=Sharma |first=N.

These similarities include the energy carrier [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), and the fact that all amino acids found in proteins are [[Chirality (chemistry)#In biology|left-handed]]. It is, however, possible that these similarities resulted because of the [[Laws of science|laws of physics and chemistry]] - rather than through universal common descent - and therefore resulted in convergent evolution. In contrast, there is evidence for homology of the central subunits of [[ATPase#Transmembrane ATP synthases|Transmembrane ATPases]] throughout all living organisms, especially how the rotating elements are bound to the membrane. This supports the assumption of a LUCA as a cellular organism, although primordial membranes may have been semipermeable and evolved later to the membranes of modern bacteria, and on a second path to those of modern archaea also.<ref>\n{{cite book \n |last= Lane |first= Nick |authorlink= Nick Lane\n |year= 2015\n |title= The Vital Question: Why Is Life The Way It Is?\n |publisher= Profile Books |isbn= 978-1781250365\n |titlelink= The Vital Question\n |page= <!--part 77 of online edition-->\n}}\n</ref>\n\n===Phylogenetic trees===\n{{PhylomapB|size=300px|caption=A [[phylogenetic tree]] based on [[ribosomal RNA]] genes implies a single origin for all life.}}\n{{Main |Phylogenetic tree}}\n{{See also |Tree of life (biology)}}\n\nAnother important piece of evidence is from detailed phylogenetic trees (i.e., \"genealogic trees\" of species) mapping out the proposed divisions and common ancestors of all living species. In 2010, Douglas L. Theobald published a statistical analysis of available genetic data,<ref name=\"theobald\" /> mapping them to phylogenetic trees, that gave \"strong quantitative support, by a formal test, for the unity of life.\"<ref name=\"steel\" />\n\nTraditionally, these trees have been built using morphological methods, such as appearance, [[embryology]], etc. Recently, it has been possible to construct these trees using molecular data, based on similarities and differences between genetic and protein sequences. All these methods produce essentially similar results, even though most [[genetic variation]] has no influence over external morphology. That phylogenetic trees based on different types of information agree with each other is strong evidence of a real underlying common descent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section1.html#independent_convergence |title=Prediction 1.3: Consilience of independent phylogenies |last=Theobald |first=Douglas L. |work=29+ Evidences for Macroevolution: The Scientific Case for Common Descent |version=Version 2.89 |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive|The TalkOrigins Foundation]] |accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref>\n\n==Potential objections==\n\n[[File:Tree Of Life (with horizontal gene transfer).svg|thumb|2005 [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] shows many [[horizontal gene transfer]]s, implying multiple possible origins.]]\n\n===Gene exchange clouds phylogenetic analysis===\n{{further|Horizontal gene transfer}}\n\nTheobald noted that substantial [[horizontal gene transfer]] could have occurred during early evolution. Bacteria today remain capable of gene exchange between distantly-related lineages. This weakens the basic assumption of phylogenetic analysis, that similarity of genomes implies common ancestry, because sufficient gene exchange would allow lineages to share much of their genome whether or not they [[monophyly|shared an ancestor (monophyly)]]. This has led to questions about the single ancestry of life.<ref name=\"theobald\" /> However, biologists consider it very unlikely that completely unrelated proto-organisms could have exchanged genes, as their different coding mechanisms would have resulted only in garble rather than functioning systems. Later, however, many organisms all derived from a single ancestor could readily have shared genes that all worked in the same way, and it appears that they have.<ref name=\"theobald\" />\n\n===Convergent evolution===\n{{further|Convergent evolution}}\n\nIf early organisms had been driven by the same environmental conditions to [[Convergent evolution|evolve similar biochemistry convergently]], they might independently have acquired similar genetic sequences. Theobald's \"formal test\" was accordingly criticised by Takahiro Yonezawa and colleagues<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yonezawa |first1=Takahiro |last2=Hasegawa |first2=Masami |title=Was the universal common ancestry proved? |date=16 December 2010 |journal=Nature |volume=468 |issue=7326 |page=E9 |doi=10.1038/nature09482 |pmid=21164432|bibcode=2010Natur.468E...9Y }}</ref> for not including consideration of convergence. They argued that Theobald's test was insufficient to distinguish between the competing hypotheses. Theobald has defended his method against this claim, arguing that his tests distinguish between phylogenetic structure and mere sequence similarity.

There are a number of possible reasons for this:\n**''Melodic variation'' can be easily introduced. Melodic variation is widely used in Celtic music, especially by the pipes and harp.\n**It is easier to anticipate the direction that the melody will take, so that harmony either composed or improvised can be introduced: cliched cadences that are essential for impromptu harmony are also more easily formed.\n**The relatively wider tonal intervals in some songs make it possible for stress accents within the poetic line to be more in keeping with the local Celtic accent.\n*Across just one Celtic group.\n*By more than one Celtic language population belonging to different Celtic groups.\n\nThese two latter usage patterns may simply be remnants of formerly widespread melodic practices.\n\nOften, the term ''Celtic music'' is applied to the [[Folk music of Ireland|music of Ireland]] and [[music of Scotland|Scotland]] because both lands have produced well-known distinctive styles which actually have genuine commonality and clear mutual influences. The definition is further complicated by the fact that Irish independence has allowed Ireland to promote 'Celtic' music as a specifically Irish product. However, these are modern geographical references to a people who share a common Celtic ancestry and consequently, a common musical heritage.\n\nThese styles are known because of the importance of Irish and Scottish people in the English speaking world, especially in the United States, where they had a profound impact on [[Music of the United States|American music]], particularly [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chincoteagueculturalalliance.org/articles/article/5493371/95457.htm |title=From Heather to High Lonesome |last=Troxler |first=Bill |publisher=Chincoteague Cultural Alliance |work=Bluegrass and Celtic Music |date=14 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828183250/http://www.chincoteagueculturalalliance.org/articles/article/5493371/95457.htm |archive-date=28 August 2008}}</ref> The [[music of Wales]], [[music of Cornwall|Cornwall]], the [[music of the Isle of Man|Isle of Man]], [[music of Brittany|Brittany]], [[music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias|Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias]] (Spain) and [[music of Portugal|Portugal]] are also considered Celtic music, the tradition being particularly strong in [[Brittany]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceolas.org/ref/what.is.celtic.html|title=What is celtic music?|website=www.ceolas.org|access-date=2017-09-18}}</ref> where Celtic festivals large and small take place throughout the year,<ref>Defrance Yves, \u201cNew Celtic Music in Brittany\u201d, in Continuum Encyclopedia of popular music of the world, London-New York, International Association of Popular Music, Continuum Books, Part.3 Genres, vol.10, 2013, 3 p.</ref> and in Wales, where the ancient [[eisteddfod]] tradition has been revived and flourishes.

Further, some older forms of Celtic music that are rare in Scotland and Ireland today, such as the practice of accompanying a fiddle with a piano, or the Gaelic spinning songs of Cape Breton remain common in the Maritimes.

Variously referred to as roots music, American folk music, or [[old-time music]], this tradition has exerted a strong influence on all forms of American music, including country, blues, and rock and roll.<ref>Irish Folk, Trad and Blues: A Secret History\" by Colin Harper (2005) covers Horslips, The Pogues, Planxty and others.</ref> In addition to its lasting effects on other genres, it marked the first modern large-scale mixing of musical traditions from multiple ethnic and religious communities within the [[Celtic diaspora (disambiguation)|Celtic diaspora]].\n\nIn the 1960s several bands put forward modern adaptations of Celtic music pulling influences from several of the Celtic nations at once to create a modern [[pan-celtic]] sound. A few of those include [[bagad]]o\u00f9 (Breton pipe bands), [[Fairport Convention]], [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]], [[Steeleye Span]] and [[Horslips]].\n\nIn the 1970s [[Clannad]] made their mark initially in the [[Folk music|folk]] and traditional scene, and then subsequently went on to bridge the gap between traditional Celtic and pop music in the 1980s and 1990s, incorporating elements from [[New-age music|new-age]], [[smooth jazz]], and [[folk rock]]. Traces of Clannad's legacy can be heard in the music of many artists, including [[Enya]], Donna Taggart, [[Altan (band)|Altan]], [[Capercaillie (band)|Capercaillie]], [[The Corrs]], [[Loreena McKennitt]], [[An\u00fana]], [[Riverdance]] and [[U2]]. The solo music of Clannad's lead singer, [[Moya Brennan]] (often referred to as the First Lady of Celtic Music) has further enhanced this influence.\n\nLater, beginning in 1982 with [[The Pogues]]' invention of Celtic folk-punk and [[Stockton's Wing]] blend of Irish traditional and Pop, Rock and Reggae, there has been a movement to incorporate [[Celt]]ic influences into other genres of music. Bands like [[Flogging Molly]], [[Black 47]], [[Dropkick Murphys]], [[The Young Dubliners]], [[The Tossers]] introduced a hybrid of [[Celtic rock]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[reggae]], [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] and other elements in the 1990s that has become popular with Irish-American youth.\n\nToday there are Celtic-influenced subgenres of virtually every type of popular music including [[electronica]], [[Celtic rock|rock]], [[Celtic metal|metal]], [[Celtic punk|punk]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[reggae]], [[New-age music|new-age]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]], [[Andean music|Andean]] and [[Pop music|pop]]. Collectively these modern interpretations of Celtic music are sometimes referred to as [[Celtic fusion]].\n\n== Other modern adaptations ==\nOutside of America, the first deliberate attempts to create a \"Pan-Celtic music\" were made by the Breton [[Fran\u00e7ois Jaffrennou|Taldir Jaffrennou]], having translated songs from Ireland, Scotland, and Wales into Breton between the two world wars. One of his major works was to bring \"[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]\" (the Welsh [[national anthem]]) back in Brittany and create lyrics in Breton. Eventually this song became \"''Bro goz va zado\u00f9''\" (\"Old land of my fathers\") and is the most widely accepted Breton anthem. In the 70s, the Breton [[Alan Cochevelou]] (future [[Alan Stivell]]) began playing a mixed repertoire from the main Celtic countries on the Celtic harp his father created.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> <br />\nProbably the most successful all inclusive Celtic music composition in recent years is [[Shaun Davey]]s composition [[The Pilgrim (1983 album)|'The Pilgrim']]. This suite depicts the journey of St. Colum Cille through the Celtic nations of Ireland, Scotland, the [[Isle of Man]], Wales, [[Cornwall]], [[Brittany]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. The suite which includes a Scottish pipe band, Irish and Welsh harpists, [[Galician gaita]]s, Irish [[uilleann pipes]], the [[bombarde]]s of [[Brittany]], two vocal soloists and a narrator is set against a background of a classical orchestra and a large choir.\n\nModern music may also be termed \"Celtic\" because it is written and recorded in a Celtic language, regardless of musical style. Many of the Celtic languages have experienced resurgences in modern years, spurred on partly by the action of artists and musicians who have embraced them as hallmarks of identity and distinctness. In 1971, the Irish band ''[[Skara Brae (band)|Skara Brae]]'' recorded its only [[LP album|LP]] (simply called ''Skara Brae''), all songs in Irish. In 1978 [[Runrig]] recorded an album in [[Scottish Gaelic]]. In 1992 [[Capercaillie (band)|Capercaillie]] recorded \"A Prince Among Islands\", the first Scottish Gaelic language record to reach the UK top 40. In 1996, a song in Breton represented France in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|41st Eurovision Song Contest]], the first time in history that France had a song without a word in French. Since about 2005, [[Oi Polloi]] (from Scotland) have recorded in Scottish Gaelic. [[Mill a h-Uile Rud]] (a [[Scottish Gaelic punk]] band from Seattle) recorded in the language in 2004.\n\nSeveral contemporary bands have Welsh language songs, such as [[Ceredwen]], which fuses traditional instruments with [[trip hop]] beats, the [[Super Furry Animals]], [[Fernhill (band)|Fernhill]], and so on (see the [[Music of Wales]] article for more Welsh and Welsh-language bands). The same phenomenon occurs in Brittany, where many singers record songs in Breton, traditional or modern (hip hop, [[Rap music|rap]], and so on.).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Folk music of Ireland]]\n*[[Music of Brittany]]\n*[[Music of Cornwall]]\n*[[Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias]]\n*[[Music of the Isle of Man]]\n*[[Music of Scotland]]\n*[[Music of Wales]]\n*[[Music of Portugal]]\n*[[Traditional Gaelic music]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{DMOZ|Regional/Europe/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music/|European Music}}\n* [http://sites.google.com/site/jcorelisceltic/ Celtic melody library]\n* [http://www.celticscores.com/ Free sheet music on CelticScores.com]\n* [http://www.vashonceltictunes.net/irish/ Free sheet music, chords, midis at Vashon Celtic Tunes]\n\n{{Celtic music}}\n{{Celtic nations}}\n<!--{{Folk music}}-->\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Celtic Music}}\n[[Category:Celtic music| ]]\n[[Category:Western European music]]\n[[Category:Irish culture]]", "sha1": "a37ezu2rik10b5kll7werjduepk0o8i"}}, {"title": "Computer Monitor", "ns": "0", "id": "5264", "redirect": {"title": "Computer monitor"}, "revision": {"id": "783860658", "parentid": "299855616", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:29:19Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Computer monitor]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from other capitalisation}}\n}}", "sha1": "2j1150wzpqvfvi8uzx9hur1oaldhlod"}}, {"title": "Constellation", "ns": "0", "id": "5267", "revision": {"id": "866601973", "parentid": "866601929", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T10:59:07Z", "contributor": {"username": "Shellwood", "id": "2366721"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/Halloweener2|Halloweener2]] ([[User talk:Halloweener2|talk]]) ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the star grouping}}\n<!-- infobox -->\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 290px;\" \n|-\n|\n{| style=\"background: white; white-space: nowrap;\" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0\n|-\n| colspan=2 | [[File:Orion constellation Hevelius.jpg|286px]]\n|-\n|[[File:Orion IAU.svg|157px]][[File:OrionCC.jpg|128px]]\n|}\n|-\n|\n* Top: Baroque drawing of the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] from [[Johannes Hevelius]]{{'}} Celestial catalogue, showing the stars as they would appear to an observer looking down upon the imaginary celestial sphere from the outside\n* Bottom: Contemporary map of Orion from the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] and photography of the night sky\n|}\n\nA '''constellation''' is a group of [[star]]s that forms an imaginary outline or meaningful pattern on the [[celestial sphere]], typically representing an animal, mythological person or creature, a god, or an inanimate object.<ref name=\"oxforddic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/constellation |title=Definition of constellation |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |access-date=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nOrigins for the earliest constellations likely go back to [[prehistory]]. People used them to relate stories of their beliefs, experiences, [[creation myth|creation]], or [[mythology]]. Different cultures and countries adopted their own sets of constellations outlines, some of which lasted into the early [[20th century]] before today's constellations were internationally recognized. Adoption of constellations has changed significantly over time. Many have changed in size or shape. Some became popular, only to drop into obscurity. Others were limited to single cultures or nations.\n\nThe 48 traditional Western constellations are Greek. They are given in [[Aratus]]' work ''Phenomena'' and [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'', though their origin probably predates these works by several centuries. Constellations in the far [[southern celestial hemisphere|southern sky]] were added from the [[15th century]] until the mid-[[18th century]] when European explorers began traveling to the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Twelve ancient constellations belong to the [[zodiac]] (straddling the [[ecliptic]], which the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planet]]s all traverse). The origins of the zodiac remain historically uncertain; its [[astrology|astrological]] divisions became prominent [[circa|c.]] 400 BC in [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian]] or [[Chaldea]]n astronomy,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Britton |first=John P. |date=2010 |title=Studies in Babylonian lunar theory: part III.

Some [[stellar designation|astronomical naming systems]] include the constellation where a given celestial object is found to convey its approximate location in the sky. The [[Flamsteed designation]] of a star, for example, consists of a number and the genitive form of the constellation name.\n\nOther star patterns or groups called [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] are not constellations per se but are used by observers to navigate the night sky. Asterisms often refer to several stars within a constellation or may share stars with several constellations. Examples include the [[Pleiades]] and [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] within the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and the [[False Cross]] split between the southern constellations [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]], or Venus' Mirror in the constellation of Orion.<ref name=\"DOCdb2018\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.docdb.net/show_object.php?id=saucepan\n|title=DOCdb Deep Sky Observer's Companion \u2013 the online database\n|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"SoftBisque2018\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.bisque.com/tom/asterisms/list.asp\n|title=A Complete List of Asterisms\n|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n\nThe word \"constellation\" comes from the [[Late Latin]] term {{lang|la|c\u014dnstell\u0101ti\u014d}}, which can be translated as \"set of stars\"; it came into use in [[Middle English|English]] during the 14th century.<ref>{{cite web |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/constellation#etymonline_v_18252}}</ref> The [[Ancient Greek]] word for constellation is [[wikt:\u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd|\u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd.]] A more modern astronomical sense of the term \"constellation\" is simply as a recognisable pattern of stars whose appearance is associated with mythological characters or creatures, or  earthbound animals, or objects.<ref name=\"oxforddic\" /> It can also specifically denote the officially recognized 88 named constellations used today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constellation|title=constellation|accessdate=2 August 2016|publisher= Merriam-webster}}</ref>\n \nColloquial usage does not draw a sharp distinction between \"constellations\" and smaller \"asterisms\" (pattern of stars), yet the modern accepted astronomical constellations employ such a distinction. E.g., the [[Pleiades]] and the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] are both asterisms, and each lies within the boundaries of the constellation of Taurus. Another example is the popular northern asterism known as the [[Big Dipper]] (US) or the Plough (UK), composed of the seven brightest stars within the area of the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]-defined constellation of [[Ursa Major]]. The southern [[False Cross]] asterism includes portions of the constellations [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]].\n\nA constellation (or star), viewed from a particular latitude on Earth, that never sets below the [[horizon]] is termed [[circumpolar star|circumpolar]]. From the [[North Pole]] or [[South Pole]], all constellations south or north of the [[celestial equator]] are [[circumpolar constellation|circumpolar]]. Depending on the definition, equatorial constellations may include those that lie between declinations 45\u00b0 north and 45\u00b0 south,<ref name=harbord_goodwin1897/> or those that pass through the declination range of the ecliptic or [[zodiac]] ranging between 23\u00bd\u00b0 north, the celestial equator, and 23\u00bd\u00b0 south.<ref name=\"Norton14th\" /><ref name=steele1884 />\n\nAlthough stars in constellations appear near each other in the sky, they usually lie at a variety of distances away from the Earth. Since stars have their own independent motions, all constellations will change slowly over time. After tens to hundreds of thousands of years, familiar outlines will generally become unrecognizable.<ref name=\"marc\">{{cite web\n|url=http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/dr-marc-space/constellations.html\n|title=Do Constellations Ever Break Apart or Change?\n|publisher=NASA\n|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}</ref> Astronomers can predict the past or future constellation outlines by measuring individual stars' [[proper motion|common proper motions]] or cpm<ref name=\"Koupelis2007\">{{cite book\n|author=Theo Koupelis \n|author2=Karl F.
