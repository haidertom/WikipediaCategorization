Most kinds of dunes are longer on the stoss (upflow) side, where the sand is pushed up the dune, and have a shorter \"slip face\" in the lee side. The valley or trough between dunes is called a ''slack''. A \"dune field\" or [[Erg (landform)|erg]] is an area covered by extensive dunes. \n\nDunes occur in some [[desert]]s and along some coasts. Some coastal areas have one or more sets of dunes running parallel to the shoreline directly inland from the [[beach]]. In most cases, the dunes are important in protecting the land against potential ravages by storm waves from the [[sea]]. Although the most widely distributed dunes are those associated with coastal regions, the largest complexes of dunes are found inland in dry regions and associated with ancient [[lake]] or [[sea]] beds. Dunes can form under the action of water flow ([[fluvial]] processes), and on sand or [[gravel]] beds of [[river]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]] and the sea-bed.\n\nThe modern word \"dune\" came into English from French {{circa}} 1790,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dune|title=Dune\u2014Define Dune at Dictionary.com|author=|date=|website=dictionary.com|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501201547/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dune|archivedate=1 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> which in turn came from [[Middle Dutch]] ''d\u016bne''.<ref name=\"oxford\"/>\n\n==Formation==\n[[File:Saltation on sand dune.png|thumb|left|Sand hitting sand is more likely to stick; sand hitting a more coherent surface is more likely to bounce ([[saltation (geology)|saltation]]). This exacerbating [[feedback loop]] helps sand accumulate into dunes.]]\nDunes are made of [[sand]]; the sand may be quartz, calcium carbonate, snow, gypsum, or other materials. The upwind/upstream/upcurrent side of the dune is called the stoss side; the downflow side is called the lee side. Sand is pushed (creep) or bounces ([[saltation (geology)|saltation]]) up the stoss side, and slides down the lee side. A side of a dune that the sand has slid down is called a slip face.\n\nThe [[Bagnold formula]] gives the speed at which particles can be transported.\n\n==Aeolian dunes==\n\n===Aeolian dune shapes===\n\n====Barchan or crescentic====\n{{main|barchan}}\n[[File:Barchan in Noachis.jpg|thumbnail|right|Isolated barchan dunes on the surface of [[Mars]]. Dominant wind direction would be from left to right.]]\nBarchan dunes are crescent-shaped mounds which are generally wider than they are long. The lee-side slipfaces are on the concave sides of the dunes. These dunes form under winds that blow consistently from one direction (unimodal winds). They form separate crescents when the sand supply is comparatively small. When the sand supply is greater, they may merge into barchanoid ridges, and then transverse dunes (see below).\n\nSome types of crescentic dunes move more quickly over [[desert]] surfaces than any other type of dune. A group of dunes moved more than 100 metres per year between 1954 and 1959 in [[China]]'s [[Ningxia Province]], and similar speeds have been recorded in the Western Desert of [[Egypt]]. The largest crescentic dunes on Earth, with mean crest-to-crest widths of more than three kilometres, are in China's [[Taklamakan Desert]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Types of Dunes|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/|accessdate=8 March 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314161113/http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/|archivedate=14 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSee lunettes and parabolic dues, below, for other crescent-shaped dunes.\n\n====Transverse====\nAbundant barchan dunes (see above) may merge into barchanoid ridges, which then grade into linear (or slightly sinuous) transverse dunes, so called because they lie transverse, or across, the wind direction, with the wind blowing perpendicular to the ridge crest.<ref name=Mangimeli/>\n\n====Seif or longitudinal dunes====\nSeif dunes are linear (or slightly sinuous) dunes with two slip faces.<ref name=Mangimeli/> The two slip faces make them sharp-crested. They are called ''seif'' dunes after the Arabic word for \"sword\". They may be more than 160 kilometres (100 miles) long, and thus easily visible in satellite images (see illustrations). \n\nSeif dunes are associated with bidirectional winds.

Bagnold, in ''[[The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes]]'', suggested that some seif dunes form when a barchan dune moves into a bidirectional wind regime, and one arm or wing of the crescent elongates. Others suggest that seif dunes are formed by [[vortex|vortices]] in a unidirectional wind.<ref name=Mangimeli/> In the sheltered troughs between highly developed seif dunes, barchans may be formed, because the wind is constrained to be unidirectional by the dunes.\n\n<!-- The first image (Rub' al Khali) would be better rotated 90 degrees clockwise to match it with the contrasting image to the right --> \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Rub' al Khali (Arabian Empty Quarter) sand dunes imaged by Terra (EOS AM-1).jpg|alt = On the left, more barchany dunes, with the crescent arms pointing towards the bottom edge of the image and slightly rightwards.

They range up to {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length. In the southern third of the Arabian Peninsula, a vast [[Erg (landform)|erg]], called the [[Rub' al Khali]] or Empty Quarter, contains seif dunes that stretch for almost 200&nbsp;km and reach heights of over 300&nbsp;m.\n\nLinear [[loess]] hills known as [[paha (landform)|pahas]] are superficially similar. These hills appear to have been formed during the last [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]] under [[permafrost]] conditions dominated by sparse [[tundra]] vegetation.\n\n====Star====\n[[File:Star-dune.jpg|thumbnail|An isolated star dune]]\nRadially symmetrical, star dunes are pyramidal sand mounds with slipfaces on three or more arms that radiate from the high center of the mound. They tend to accumulate in areas with multidirectional wind regimes. Star dunes grow upward rather than laterally. They dominate the [[Grand Erg Oriental]] of the Sahara. In other deserts, they occur around the margins of the [[sand sea]]s, particularly near topographic barriers. In the southeast [[Badain Jaran Desert]] of China, the star dunes are up to 500 metres tall and may be the tallest dunes on Earth.\n\n====Dome====\nOval or circular mounds that generally lack a slipface. Dome dunes are rare and occur at the far upwind margins of sand seas.\n\n====='''Lunettes'''=====\nFixed crescentic dunes that form on the leeward margins of [[Dry lake|playas]] and river valleys in arid and semiarid regions in response to the direction(s) of prevailing winds, are known as lunettes, source-bordering dunes, bourrelets and clay dunes. They may be composed of clay, silt, sand, or gypsum, eroded from the basin floor or shore, transported up the concave side of the dune, and deposited on the convex side. Examples in Australia are up to 6.5&nbsp;km long, 1&nbsp;km wide, and up to 50 metres high. They also occur in southern and West Africa, and in parts of the western United States, especially Texas.<ref>[[Charles Rowland Twidale|Twidale, C.R.]] & Campbell, E.M.

Pp. 241\u20133. {{ISBN|1 877058 32 7}}</ref>\n\n====Parabolic====\n[[File:Parabolic dune.jpg|thumb|Schematic of coastal parabolic dunes]]\nU-shaped mounds of sand with convex noses trailed by elongated arms are parabolic dunes. These dunes are formed from blowout dunes where the erosion of vegetated sand leads to a U-shaped depression. The elongated arms are held in place by vegetation; the largest arm known on Earth reaches 12&nbsp;km. Sometimes these dunes are called U-shaped, [[blowout (geology)|blowout]], or hairpin dunes, and they are well known in coastal deserts. Unlike crescent shaped dunes, their crests point upwind. The bulk of the sand in the dune migrates forward.\n\nIn plan view, these are U-shaped or V-shaped mounds of well-sorted, very fine to medium sand with elongated arms that extend upwind behind the central part of the dune. There are slipfaces that often occur on the outer side of the nose and on the outer slopes of the arms.\n\nThese dunes often occur in semiarid areas where the precipitation is retained in the lower parts of the dune and underlying soils. The stability of the dunes was once attributed to the vegetative cover but recent research has pointed to water as the main source of parabolic dune stability. The vegetation that covers them\u2014grasses, shrubs, and trees\u2014help anchor the trailing arms. In inland deserts, parabolic dunes commonly originate and extend downwind from blowouts in sand sheets only partly anchored by vegetation. They can also originate from beach sands and extend inland into vegetated areas in coastal zones and on shores of large lakes.\n\nMost parabolic dunes do not reach heights higher than a few tens of metres except at their nose, where vegetation stops or slows the advance of accumulating sand.\n\nSimple parabolic dunes have only one set of arms that trail upwind, behind the leading nose. Compound parabolic dunes are coalesced features with several sets of trailing arms. Complex parabolic dunes include subsidiary superposed or coalesced forms, usually of barchanoid or linear shapes.\n\nParabolic dunes, like crescent dunes, occur in areas where very strong winds are mostly unidirectional. Although these dunes are found in areas now characterized by variable wind speeds, the effective winds associated with the growth and migration of both the parabolic and crescent dunes probably are the most consistent in wind direction.\n\nThe grain size for these well-sorted, very fine to medium sands is about 0.06 to 0.5&nbsp;mm. Parabolic dunes have loose sand and steep slopes only on their outer flanks. The inner slopes are mostly well packed and anchored by vegetation, as are the corridors between individual dunes. Because all dune arms are oriented in the same direction, and, the inter-dune corridors are generally swept clear of loose sand, the corridors can usually be traversed in between the trailing arms of the dune. However to cross straight over the dune by going over the trailing arms, can be very difficult. Also, traversing the nose is very difficult as well because the nose is usually made up of loose sand without much if any vegetation.\n\nA type of extensive parabolic dune that lacks discernible slipfaces and has mostly coarse grained sand is known as a ''zibar''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goudie|first=Ron Cooke; Andrew Warren; Andrew|title=Desert geomorphology|year=1996|publisher=UCL Press|location=London|isbn=1-85728-017-2|pages=395\u2013396|edition=2. impr.}}</ref> The term zibar comes from the [[Arabic]] word to describe \"rolling transverse ridges ... with a hard surface\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Goudie|first=Ron Cooke; Andrew Warren; Andrew|title=Desert geomorphology|year=1996|publisher=UCL Press|location=London|isbn=1-85728-017-2|pages=395|edition=2. impr.}}</ref> The dunes are small, have low relief, and can be found in many places across the planet from [[Wyoming]] (United States) to Saudi Arabia to Australia.

These dunes typically have major and minor slipfaces oriented in opposite directions. The minor slipfaces are usually temporary, as they appear after a reverse wind and are generally destroyed when the wind next blows in the dominant direction.<ref name=Mangimeli/>\n\n====Draas====\n[[File:350m D\u00fcne Deadvlei Sossusvlei.JPG|thumb|Dune Nine in [[Sossusvlei]], [[Namibia]], is over 300m high.]]\nDraas are very large-scale dune bedforms; they may be tens or a few hundreds of meters in height, kilometers wide, and hundreds of kilometers in length.<ref name=Mangimeli>{{Cite| publisher = U.S.A.

Draas are widespread in sand seas and are [[Cross-bedding|well-represented in the geological record]].<ref name=Lancaster/>\n\n===Dune complexity===\nAll these dune shapes may occur in three forms: simple, compound, and complex. Simple dunes are basic forms with the minimum number of slipfaces that define the geometric type. Compound dunes are large dunes on which smaller dunes of similar type and slipface orientation are superimposed. Complex dunes are combinations of two or more dune types. A crescentic dune with a star dune superimposed on its crest is the most common complex dune. Simple dunes represent a wind regime that has not changed in intensity or direction since the formation of the dune, while compound and complex dunes suggest that the intensity and direction of the wind has changed.\n\n===Dune movement===\nThe sand mass of dunes can move either windward or leeward, depending on if the wind is making contact with the dune from below or above its apogee. If wind hits from above, the sand particles move leeward. If sand hits from below, sand particles move windward. The leeward flux of sand is greater than the windward flux. Further, when the wind carrying sand particles when it hits the dune, the dune\u2019s sand particles will saltate more than if the wind had hit the dune without carrying sand particles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Hong|last2=Dun|first2=Hongchao|last3=Tong|first3=Ding|last4=Huang|first4=Ning|date=2017-04-15|title=Sand transportation and reverse patterns over leeward face of sand dune|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X16302732|journal=Geomorphology|volume=283|pages=41\u201347|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.12.030}}</ref>\n\n===Coastal dunes===\n[[File:LIVER AAS UDLOEB I JULI 2012 (ubt)-002.JPG|thumb|Coastal dunes covered in grasses around the mouth of the Liver \u00c5 river in Denmark]]\nDunes form where the beach is wide enough to allow for the accumulation of wind-blown sand, and where prevailing '''onshore winds''' tend to blow sand inland.

The conditions on an ''embryo dune'' are harsh, with [[salt spray]] from the sea carried on strong winds. The dune is well drained and often dry, and composed of calcium carbonate from seashells. Rotting [[seaweed]], brought in by storm waves adds nutrients to allow [[pioneer species]] to colonize the dune. These pioneer species are [[Ammophila (Poaceae)|marram grass]], [[sea wort grass]] and other sea grasses in the [[United Kingdom]]. These plants are well adapted to the harsh conditions of the foredune\ntypically having deep roots which reach the [[water table]], [[root nodules]] that produce [[nitrogen]] compounds, and protected [[stoma]], reducing [[transpiration]]. Also, the deep roots bind the sand together, and the dune grows into a [[foredune]] as more sand is blown over the grasses. The grasses add [[nitrogen]] to the soil, meaning other, less hardy plants can then colonize the dunes. Typically these are [[Calluna|heather]], [[Heath (habitat)|heath]]s and [[gorse]]s. These too are adapted to the low soil water content and have small, prickly leaves which reduce transpiration. Heather adds [[humus]] to the soil and is usually replaced by [[conifer]]ous trees, which can tolerate low soil [[pH]], caused by the accumulation and decomposition of organic matter with nitrate leaching.<ref name=Miles1985>{{Cite journal| last = Miles | first = J.| year = 1985| title = The pedogenic effects of different species and vegetation types and the implications of succession| journal = European Journal of Soil Science| volume = 36| issue = 4| pages = 571| doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2389.1985.tb00359.x| postscript = . }}</ref> Coniferous forests and [[heathland]] are common [[climax community|climax communities]] for sand dune systems.\n\nYoung dunes are called [[yellow dune]]s and dunes which have high humus content are called [[grey dune]]s.

It is usually in the slacks that more rare species are developed and there is a tendency for the dune slacks soil to be waterlogged and where only marsh plants can survive. These plants would include: creeping willow, cotton grass, [[yellow iris]], reeds, and rushes. As for the species, there is a tendency for [[natterjack toad]]s to breed here.\n\n=== Coastal dune floral adaptations ===\nDune ecosystems are extremely difficult places for plants to survive. This is due to a number of pressures related to their proximity to the ocean and confinement to growth on sandy substrates.  These include:\n* Little available soil moisture\n* Little available [[soil organic matter]]/nutrients\n* Harsh winds\n* Salt spray\n* Erosion/shifting and sometimes ephemeral substrate\n* Tidal influences\nThere are many adaptations plants have evolved to cope with these pressures:\n* Deep taproot to reach water table (Pink Sand Verbena)\n* Shallow but extensive root systems\n* Prostrate growth form to avoid wind/salt spray (''Abronia spp''., Beach Primrose)\n* Krummholz growth form (Monterrey Cypress-not a dune plant but deals with similar pressures)\n* Thickened cuticle/Succulence to reduce moisture loss and reduce salt uptake (''Ambrosia/Abronia spp., Calystegia soldanella'')\n* Pale leaves to reduce insolation (''Artemisia/Ambrosia spp.'')\n* Thorny/Spiky seeds to ensure establishment in vicinity of parent, reduces chances of being blown away or swept our to sea (''Ambrosia chamissonis'')\n\n===Nabkha dunes===\nA [[nabkha]], or coppice dune, is a small dune anchored by vegetation. They usually indicate desertification or soil erosion, and serve as nesting and burrow sites for animals.\n\n==Sub-aqueous dunes==\n{{main|Ripple marks}}\nSub-aqueous ([[underwater]]) dunes form on a bed of sand or gravel under the actions of water flow. They are ubiquitous in natural [[Channel (geography)|channels]] such as rivers and estuaries, and also form in engineered [[canal]]s and pipelines. Dunes move downstream as the upstream slope is eroded and the sediment deposited on the downstream or lee slope in typical [[bedform]] construction.<ref>Prothero, D. R. and Schwab, F., 1996, ''[[Sedimentary Geology (journal)|Sedimentary Geology]]'', pg. 45\u201349, {{ISBN|0-7167-2726-9}}</ref>\n\nThese dunes most often form as a continuous 'train' of dunes, showing remarkable similarity in [[wavelength]] and height. The shape of a dune gives information about its formation environment.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www4.uwm.edu/course/geosci697/ripple-indices/Ripple%20Indices.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-01-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501201547/https://www4.uwm.edu/course/geosci697/ripple-indices/Ripple%20Indices.html |archivedate=1 May 2018 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> For instance, rives produce asymmetrical ripples, with the steeper slip face facing downstream. This is useful when they are [[Ripple marks|found fossilized in the geological record]].\n\nDunes on the bed of a channel significantly increase flow resistance, their presence and growth playing a major part in river [[flooding]].\n\n==Lithified dunes==\n[[File:Cross-bedding Of Sandstone Near Mt Carmel Road Zion Canyon Utah.jpg|thumb|Cross-bedding in lithified aeolian sand dunes preserved as sandstone in Zion National Park, Utah]]\nA [[Lithification|lithified]] (consolidated) sand dune is a type of [[sandstone]] that is formed when a marine or aeolian sand dune becomes compacted and hardened. Once in this form, water passing through the rock can carry and deposit minerals, which can alter the color of the rock. [[Cross-bedding|Cross-bedded]] layers of stacks of lithified dunes can produce the cross-hatching patterns, such as those seen in the [[Zion National Park]] in the western United States.\n\nA slang term, used in the [[Southwestern United States|southwest US]], for consolidated and hardened sand dunes is \"slickrock\", a name that was introduced by pioneers of the [[Old West]] because their steel-rimmed wagon wheels could not gain traction on the rock.\n\n==Desertification==\n{{Main article|Desertification}}\nSand dunes can have a negative impact on humans when they encroach on human habitats. Sand dunes move via a few different means, all of them helped along by wind. One way that dunes can move is by [[saltation (geology)|saltation]], where sand particles skip along the ground like a [[bouncing ball]]. When these skipping particles land, they may knock into other particles and cause them to move as well, in a process known as [[creep (sand dunes)|creep]]. With slightly stronger winds, particles collide in mid-air, causing [[sheet flow]]s. In a major [[dust storm]], dunes may move tens of metres through such sheet flows. Also as in the case of snow, sand [[avalanche]]s, falling down the [[slipface]] of the dunes\u2014that face away from the winds\u2014also move the dunes forward.\n\nSand threatens buildings and crops in Africa, the Middle East, and China. Drenching sand dunes with oil stops their migration, but this approach is quite destructive to the dunes' animal habitats and uses a valuable resource. [[Sand fence]]s might also slow their movement to a crawl, but geologists are still analyzing results for the optimum fence designs.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Preventing sand dunes from overwhelming towns, villages, and agricultural areas has become a priority for the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. Planting dunes with vegetation also helps to stabilise them.\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:KelsoSand.JPG|thumb|Sand blowing off a crest in the [[Kelso Dunes]] of the [[Mojave Desert]], California, USA]]\nDune habitats provide niches for highly specialized plants and animals, including numerous [[rare species]] and some [[endangered species]]. Due to widespread human population expansion, dunes face destruction through land development and recreational usages, as well as alteration to prevent the encroachment of sand onto inhabited areas. Some countries, notably the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Sri Lanka have developed significant programs of dune protection through the use of [[sand dune stabilization]]. In the U.K., a [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] has been developed to assess dunes loss and to prevent future dunes destruction.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Africa===\n[[File:D\u00fcne S-Schlag Sossusvlei.JPG|thumb|A dune in [[Sossusvlei]], in the greater [[Namib-Naukluft National Park]], [[Namibia]].

In 2016, ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', was named the top film of the 21st century by the BBC following a poll of 177 film critics from 36 countries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBorn to a middle-class family in [[Missoula, Montana]], Lynch spent his childhood traveling around the United States before he studied painting at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Philadelphia]], where he first made the transition to producing short films. He moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror film ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977). After ''Eraserhead'' became a [[cult classic]] on the [[midnight movie]] circuit, Lynch was employed to direct the biographical film ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980), from which he gained mainstream success. He was then employed by the [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]] and proceeded to make two films: the science-fiction epic ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'' (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a [[neo-noir]] mystery film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), which stirred controversy over its violence but later grew in critical reputation.\n\nNext, Lynch created his own television series with [[Mark Frost]], the popular murder mystery ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (1990\u20131991). He also created a cinematic prequel, ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' (1992), a [[road film]] ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'' (1990) and a family film ''[[The Straight Story]]'' (1999) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent films operated on dream logic [[non-linear narrative]] structures: ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997),  ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), and ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' (2006). Meanwhile, Lynch embraced the [[Internet]] as a medium, producing several web-based shows, such as the animated ''[[DumbLand]]'' (2002) and the surreal sitcom ''[[Rabbits (film)|Rabbits]]'' (2002). Lynch and Frost reunited for the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] limited series ''[[Twin Peaks (2017 TV series)|Twin Peaks: The Return]]'' (2017), with Lynch co-writing and directing every episode.\n\nLynch's other artistic endeavours include: his work as a musician, encompassing two solo albums\u2014''[[Crazy Clown Time]]'' (2011) and ''[[The Big Dream]]'' (2013)\u2014as well as music and [[sound design]] for a variety of his films; painting and photography; writing three books\u2014''[[Images (book)|Images]]'' (1994), ''[[Catching the Big Fish]]'' (2006), and Room to Dream (2018); and directing several music videos and advertisements, including the [[Dior]] promotional film ''[[Lady Blue Shanghai]]'' (2006). An avid practitioner of [[Transcendental Meditation]] (TM), Lynch founded the [[David Lynch Foundation]] in 2005, which sought to fund the teaching of TM in schools and has since widened its scope to other at-risk populations, including the homeless, veterans and refugees.\n\n==Early life==\n{{main|Early life of David Lynch}}\n{{Quote box|width=275px|align=right|quote=My childhood was elegant homes, tree-lined streets, the milkman, building backyard forts, droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees.

It was because of this that when he was two months old, Lynch moved with his parents to [[Sandpoint, Idaho]], and only two years after that, following the birth of his brother John, the family moved to [[Spokane, Washington]]. It was here that Lynch's sister Martha was born. The family then moved to [[Durham, North Carolina]], then [[Boise, Idaho]], and then [[Alexandria, Virginia]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Lynch found this transitory early life relatively easy to adjust to, noting that he found it fairly easy to meet new friends whenever he started attending a new school.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 2\u20133.</ref> Commenting on much of his early life, Lynch has remarked:\n\n{{quote|I found the world completely and totally fantastic as a child. Of course, I had the usual fears, like going to school&nbsp;... For me, back then, school was a crime against young people. It destroyed the seeds of liberty. The teachers didn't encourage knowledge or a positive attitude.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 14.</ref>}}\n\nAlongside his schooling, Lynch joined the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], although he would later note that he only \"became [a Scout] so I could quit and put it behind me\". He rose to the highest rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]. It was through being an Eagle Scout that he was present with other Boy Scouts outside of the [[White House]] at the [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]], which took place on Lynch's birthday in 1961.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 05.</ref> Lynch had become interested in painting and drawing from an early age, becoming intrigued by the idea of pursuing it as a career path when living in Virginia, where his friend's father was a professional painter.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nAt Francis C. Hammond High School in Alexandria, Lynch did poorly academically, having little interest in school work, but was popular with other students, and after leaving decided that he wanted to study painting at college, beginning his studies at the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] in 1964, where he was a roommate of [[Peter Wolf]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Peter'sBio|url=http://www.peterwolf.com/bio/index2.html|work=Peter Wolf|publisher=Peter Wolf|accessdate=August 16, 2012|author=Wolf, Peter|year=2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615152715/http://www.peterwolf.com/bio/index2.html|archivedate=June 15, 2012}}</ref> Nonetheless, he left the School of the Museum of Fine Arts after only a year, stating that \"I was not inspired AT ALL in that place\", and instead deciding that he wanted to travel around [[Europe]] for three years with his friend [[Jack Fisk]], who was similarly unhappy with his studies at [[Cooper Union]]. They had some hopes that in Europe they could train with the [[expressionism|expressionist]] painter [[Oskar Kokoschka]] at his school. Upon reaching [[Salzburg]], however, they found that he was not available and, disillusioned, returned to the United States after spending only 15 days of their planned three years in Europe.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 31\u201334.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Philadelphia and short films: 1966\u20131970===\nBack in the United States, Lynch returned to Virginia, but since his parents had moved to [[Walnut Creek, California]], he stayed with his friend Toby Keeler for a while. He decided to move to the city of [[Philadelphia]] and enroll at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], after advice from Jack Fisk, who was already enrolled there. He preferred this college to his previous school in Boston, claiming that \"In Philadelphia there were great and serious painters, and everybody was inspiring one another and it was a beautiful time there.\"<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 36\u201337.</ref> It was here that he began a relationship with a fellow student, Peggy Reavey, and they were married in 1967. The following year, Peggy gave birth to their daughter Jennifer. Later describing this situation, Peggy stated that \"[Lynch] definitely was a reluctant father, but a very loving one. Hey, I was pregnant when we got married. We were both reluctant.\"<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 31.</ref> As a family, they moved to the [[Fairmount, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Fairmount]] neighborhood of Philadelphia, where they were able to purchase a large 12-room house for the relatively low price of $3,500 due to the high crime and poverty rates in the area. Later describing living there, Lynch stated that\n\n{{quote|We lived cheap, but the city was full of fear. A kid was shot to death down the street&nbsp;... We were robbed twice, had windows shot out and a car stolen. The house was first broken into only three days after we moved in&nbsp;... The feeling was so close to extreme danger, and the fear was so intense. There was violence and hate and filth. But the biggest influence in my whole life was that city.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 42\u201343.</ref>}}\n\nMeanwhile, to help financially support his family alongside his art studies, he took up a job printing engravings.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 43.</ref>\n\nAt the Pennsylvania Academy  Lynch made his first [[short film]], which was titled ''[[Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)]]'' (1967). He had first come up with the idea when he developed a wish to see his paintings move, and he subsequently began discussing the idea of creating an [[animation]] with an artist named Bruce Samuelson. When this project never came about, Lynch decided to work on a film alone, and so purchased the cheapest 16mm camera that he could find in order to do so. Taking one of the abandoned upper rooms of the Academy as a working space, he spent $150<ref name=\"The Short Films of David Lynch\">{{cite film|title=The Short Films of David Lynch|publisher=}}</ref> \u2013 which at the time he felt to be a lot of money \u2013 to produce ''Six Men Getting Sick''.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 37\u201338.</ref> Describing the work as \"57&nbsp;seconds of growth and fire, and three seconds of vomit\", Lynch played the film on a loop at the Academy's annual end-of-year exhibit, where it shared joint first prize with a painting by Noel Mahaffey.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 38.</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 15\u201316.</ref> This led to a commission from one of his fellow students, the wealthy H. Barton Wasserman, who offered him $1000 to create a film installation in his home. Spending $478.28 of that on purchasing the second-hand [[Bolex]] camera \"of [his] dreams\", Lynch produced a new animated short, but upon getting the film developed, realized that the result was simply a blurred, frameless print. As he would later relate, \"So I called up Bart [Wasserman] and said, 'Bart, the film is a disaster. The camera was broken and what I've done hasn't turned out.' And he said, 'Don't worry, David, take the rest of the money and make something else for me. Just give me a print.' End of story.\"<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 39.</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lynch The Alphabet.jpg|thumb|left|The opening title of ''The Alphabet'', Lynch's second short film, and the first to include live action elements]] -->\n\nUsing this leftover money, Lynch decided to experiment on making a work that was a mix of animation with [[live action]], producing a four-minute short called ''[[The Alphabet (film)|The Alphabet]]'' (1968). The film starred Lynch's wife Peggy as a character known as The Girl, who chants the [[alphabet]] to a series of images of horses before dying at the end by hemorrhaging blood all over her bed sheets. Adding a sound effect, Lynch used a broken [[Uher (brand)|Uher]] tape recorder to record the sound of his baby daughter Jennifer crying, creating a distorted sound that Lynch felt to be particularly effective. Later describing what had inspired him, Lynch stated that \"Peggy's niece was having a bad dream one night and was saying the alphabet in her sleep in a tormented way. So that's sort of what started ''The Alphabet'' going. The rest of it was just [[subconscious]].\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 39\u201340</ref>\n\nLearning about the newly founded [[American Film Institute]], which gave grants to film makers who could support their application with a prior work and a script for a new project, Lynch decided to send them a copy of ''The Alphabet'' along with a script that he had written for a new short film, one that would be almost entirely live action, named ''[[The Short Films of David Lynch#The Grandmother|The Grandmother]]''.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 42.</ref> The Institute agreed to help finance the work, initially offering him $5000 out of his requested budget of $7,200, but later granting him the additional $2,200 that he had requested. Starring people he knew from both work and college and filmed in his own house,<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 44\u201347.</ref> ''The Grandmother'' featured a neglected boy who \"grows\" a grandmother from a seed to care for him. The film critics Michelle Le Blanc and Colin Odell later remarked that \"this film is a true oddity but contains many of the themes and ideas that would filter into his later work, and shows a remarkable grasp of the medium\".<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 18.</ref>\n\n===Los Angeles and ''Eraserhead'': 1971\u20131979===\n[[File:Eraserhead.jpg|thumb|right|Lynch's ''Eraserhead'', featuring Henry Spencer ([[Jack Nance]])]]\nIn 1971, Lynch moved with his wife and daughter to [[Los Angeles]], where he began studying filmmaking at the [[AFI Conservatory]], a place that he would later describe as being \"completely chaotic and disorganized, which was great&nbsp;... you quickly learned that if you were going to get something done, you would have to do it yourself. They wanted to let people do their thing.\"<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 57\u201358.</ref> He began writing a script for a proposed work titled ''Gardenback'', which had \"unfolded from this painting I'd done\". In this venture he was supported by a number of figures at the Conservatory, who encouraged him to lengthen the script and add more dialogue, something that he reluctantly agreed to do. Nonetheless, with all the interference on his ''Gardenback'' project, he became fed up with the Conservatory and quit after returning to start the second year and being put in first year classes. Dean of the AFI, Frank Daniel, asked Lynch to reconsider, believing that he was one of the school's best students. Lynch agreed on the condition that he could create his own project that would not be interfered with. Feeling that ''Gardenback'' was \"wrecked\", he instead set about on a new film, which he called ''[[Eraserhead]]''.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 58\u201359.</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that the film was planned to be about forty-two minutes long (it ended up being eighty-nine minutes long), the script for ''Eraserhead'' was only 21 pages long, and Lynch was able to create the film free from interference. Filming, which began on May 29, 1972, took place at night in some abandoned stables, allowing the production team, which was largely Lynch and some of his friends, including [[Sissy Spacek]], [[Jack Fisk]], cinematographer [[Frederick Elmes]] and sound designer [[Alan Splet]] to set up a camera room, green room, editing room, sets as well as a food room and a bathroom.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 59\u201360.</ref> Initially, funding for the project came from the [[American Film Institute|AFI]], who gave Lynch a $10,000 grant, but it was not enough to complete the work, and under pressure from studios after the success of the relatively cheap feature film ''[[Easy Rider]]'', they were unable to provide him with any more. Lynch was then supported by a loan from his father, and by money that he was able to bring in from a paper route that he took up delivering the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 76 and 60.\n</ref><ref>{{cite news \n |title=David Lynch \n |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303754904577530860419854198 \n |publisher=The Wall Street Journal \n |accessdate=July 22, 2012 \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69M2PL2hp?url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303754904577530860419854198.html \n |archivedate=July 22, 2012 \n |date=July 21, 2012 \n |deadurl=no \n  \n }}\n</ref>  Not long into the production of ''Eraserhead'', Lynch and his wife Peggy amicably separated and divorced, and so he began living full-time on set.

It was in one such break in 1974 that Lynch created a short film titled ''The Amputee'', which  is a short one-shot film about two minutes long. David Lynch proposed that he make the film which would become ''The Amputee'' to present to AFI to test two different types of film stock. The film really isn't good, it was thrown together to demonstrate film stock, that is all.<ref name=\"The Short Films of David Lynch\"/>{{full citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n''Eraserhead'' was finally finished in 1976, after five years of production. Lynch subsequently tried to get the film entered into the [[Cannes Film Festival]], but while some reviewers liked it, others felt that it was awful, and so it was not selected for screening. Similarly, reviewers from the [[New York Film Festival]] also rejected it, though it was screened at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]], where [[Ben Barenholtz]], the distributor of the [[Elgin Theater]], heard about it.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 82\u201383.</ref> He was very supportive of the movie, helping to distribute it around the United States in 1977, and ''Eraserhead'' subsequently became popular on the [[midnight movie]] underground circuit,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 54.</ref> and was later described as one of the most important midnight movies of the seventies along with ''[[El Topo]]'', ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', ''[[The Harder They Come]]'' and ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=457414|title=Midnight Movies: From the Margin to the Mainstream}}</ref> The acclaimed film maker [[Stanley Kubrick]] said that it was one of his all-time favorite films.<ref name=\"lynch77\">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 77.</ref>\n\n===''The Elephant Man'' and mainstream success: 1980\u20131982===\nAfter the cult success of ''Eraserhead'' on the underground circuit, [[Stuart Cornfeld]], an executive producer for [[Mel Brooks]], saw it and later remarked that \"I was just 100 percent blown away&nbsp;... I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever seen. It was such a cleansing experience.\"<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 88.</ref> Contacting Lynch, he agreed to help him with his next planned project, a film titled ''[[Ronnie Rocket]]'' for which Lynch had already written a script. However, Lynch soon realized that ''Ronnie Rocket'', a film that he described as being about \"electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair\", was not going to be picked up by any financiers, and so he asked Cornfeld to find him a script written by someone else which he could direct. Cornfeld found him four possible scripts. On hearing the title of the first, ''The Elephant Man'', Lynch chose the script.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 90\u201392.</ref>\n\n''The Elephant Man'' script, written by Chris de Vore and [[Eric Bergren]], was based on a true story, that of [[Joseph Merrick]], a heavily deformed man living in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London, who was held in a sideshow but was later taken under the care of a London surgeon, [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]]. Lynch wanted to make some alterations that would alter the story from true events, but in his view make a better plot.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 95.</ref> However, in order to do so he would have to get the permission of [[Mel Brooks]], whose company, [[Brooksfilms]], would be responsible for production; subsequently Brooks viewed ''Eraserhead'', and after coming out of the screening theatre, embraced Lynch, declaring that \"You're a madman, I love you! You're in.\"<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 92\u201393.</ref>\n\nThe resulting film, ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'', starred [[John Hurt]] as John Merrick (his name was changed from Joseph), as well as [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Frederick Treves. Filming took place in London, and Lynch brought his own distinctively surrealist approach to the film, filming it in color stock black and white. Nonetheless it has been described as \"one of the most conventional\" of his films.<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 29\u201330.</ref> ''The Elephant Man'' was a huge critical and commercial success, and earned eight [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Lynch personally.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 104.</ref>\n\n===The De Laurentiis films, ''Dune'' and ''Blue Velvet'': 1983\u20131986===\nFollowing on from the success of ''The Elephant Man'', the filmmaker [[George Lucas]], himself a fan of ''Eraserhead'', offered Lynch the opportunity to direct the third film in his ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy, ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.

He then set about writing a script based upon the original novel, initially with both Chris de Vore and Eric Bergren, and then just by himself when De Laurentiis wasn't happy with their ideas.<ref name=\"lynch115\">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 115.</ref> Lynch also helped build some of the sets, attempting to create \"a certain look\" for the film, and he particularly enjoyed building the set for the [[oil]] planet of [[Giedi Prime]], for which he \"used steel, bolts, and porcelain to construct\" it.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 118.</ref>\n\n''Dune'' is set in the far future, when humans live in an interstellar empire under a [[feudalism|feudal system]].

Lynch, however, was unhappy with the work, later remarking that \"''Dune'' was a kind of studio film. I didn't have [[final cut privilege|final cut]].

Later on, [[Universal Studios]] released an \"extended cut\" of the film for syndicated television, containing almost an hour of cutting-room-floor footage and new narration. Such was not representative of Lynch's intentions, but the studio considered it more comprehensible than the original two-hour version. Lynch objected to these changes and had his name struck from the extended cut, which has \"[[Alan Smithee]]\" credited as the director and \"Judas Booth\" (a pseudonym which Lynch himself invented, inspired by his own feelings of betrayal) as the screenwriter.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5JwyKjpH2QC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41 |title=The cinema of David Lynch: American dreams, nightmare visions |author1=Erica Sheen |author2=Annette Davison |publisher=Wallflower Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-903364-85-7}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, in 1983, he had begun the writing and drawing of a comic strip, ''[[The Angriest Dog in the World]]'', which featured unchanging graphics of a tethered dog that was so angry that it could not move, alongside cryptic philosophical references.

Developing from ideas that Lynch had had since 1973, the resulting film, ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'', was set in the fictional town of Lumberton, USA, and revolves around a college student named Jeffrey Beaumont ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), who finds a severed ear in a field. Subsequently, investigating further with the help of friend Sandy ([[Laura Dern]]), he uncovers that it is related to a criminal gang led by psychopath [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] ([[Dennis Hopper]]), who has kidnapped the husband and child of singer Dorothy Vallens ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) and repeatedly subjects her to [[rape]]. Lynch himself characterizes the story as \"a dream of strange desires wrapped inside a mystery story\".<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 138.</ref>\n\nFor the film, Lynch decided to include pop songs from the 1960s, including \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\" by [[Roy Orbison]] and \"[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]]\" by [[Bobby Vinton]], the latter of which was largely inspirational for the film, with Lynch stating that \"It was the song that sparked the movie&nbsp;...

He has stated that [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950) is one of his favourite motion pictures,<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 71.</ref> as is Kubrick's ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (1962).<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 21.</ref>  He has also cited [[Herk Harvey]]'s ''[[Carnival of Souls]]'' (1962) and [[Jerzy Skolimowski]]'s ''[[Deep End (film)|Deep End]]'' (1970) as an influence on his work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moviefone.com/2007/10/12/retro-cinema-carnival-of-souls/|title=Retro Cinema: Carnival of Souls|website=''Moviefone''|date=October 12, 2007|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Motifs===\nThere are several recurring themes within Lynch's work, leading film critics Le Blanc and Odell to state that \"his films are so packed with motifs, recurrent characters, images, compositions and techniques that you could view his entire output as one large jigsaw puzzle of ideas\".<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 08.</ref> One of the key themes that they noted was the usage of dreams and [[dreamlike]] imagery and structure within his works, something they related to the \"[[surrealist]] ethos\" of relying \"on the [[subconscious]] to provide visual drive\". This can be seen in [[Joseph Merrick|John Merrick]]'s dream of his mother in ''The Elephant Man'', [[Dale Cooper|Agent Cooper]]'s dreams of the red room in ''Twin Peaks'' and the \"dreamlike logic\" of the narrative found in ''Eraserhead'', ''Mulholland Drive'' and ''Inland Empire''.<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 8\u20139.</ref> Discussing his attitude to dreams, Lynch has stated that \"Waking dreams are the ones that are important, the ones that come when I'm quietly sitting in a chair, letting my mind wander. When you sleep, you don't control your dream. I like to dive into a dream world that I've made or discovered; a world I choose&nbsp;... [You can't really get others to experience it, but] right there is the power of cinema.\"<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 15.</ref> His films are known for their use of [[magic realism]].\n\nAnother of Lynch's prominent themes is [[industry]], with repeated imagery of \"the clunk of machinery, the power of pistons, shadows of oil drills pumping, screaming woodmills and smoke billowing factories\", as can be seen with the industrial wasteland in ''Eraserhead'', the factories in ''The Elephant Man'', the sawmill in ''Twin Peaks'' and the lawn mower in ''The Straight Story''.<ref name=\"autogenerated9\">[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 9\u201311.</ref> Describing his interest in such things, Lynch stated that \"It makes me feel good to see giant machinery, you know, working: dealing with molten metal. And I like fire and smoke. And the sounds are so powerful. It's just big stuff. It means that things are being made, and I really like that.\"<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 110.</ref>\n\nAnother theme is the dark underbelly of violent criminal activity within a society, such as with Frank's gang in ''Blue Velvet'' and the cocaine smugglers in ''Twin Peaks''. The idea of [[deformity]] is also found in several of Lynch's films, from ''The Elephant Man'' to the deformed baby in ''Eraserhead'', as well as death from head wounds, found in most of Lynch's films. Other imagery commonly used in Lynch's works are flickering electricity or lights, fire and stages upon which a singer performs, often surrounded by drapery.<ref name=\"autogenerated9\"/>\n\nWith the exception of ''The Elephant Man'' and ''Dune'', which are set in [[Victorian London]] and [[Duniverse|a fictitious galaxy]] respectively, all of Lynch's films have been set in the United States, and he has stated that \"I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels right to me to, you know, make American films.\"<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 18.</ref> A number of his works, including ''Blue Velvet'', ''Twin Peaks'' and ''Lost Highway'' are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture despite being set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch stated that \"It was a fantastic decade in a lot of ways&nbsp;... there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were laying the groundwork for a disastrous future.\"<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 3\u20135.</ref>\n\nLynch also tends to feature his leading female actors in \"split\" roles, so that many of his female characters have multiple, fractured identities. This practice began with his choice to cast [[Sheryl Lee]] as both [[Laura Palmer]] and her cousin [[Maddy Ferguson]] in ''Twin Peaks'' and continued in his later works. In ''Lost Highway'', [[Patricia Arquette]] plays the dual role of Renee Madison/Alice Wakefield, while in ''Mulholland Drive'' [[Naomi Watts]] plays Diane Selwyn/Betty Elms and Laura Harring plays Camilla Rhodes/Rita and in ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' [[Laura Dern]] plays Nikki Grace/Susan Blue. The numerous alternative versions of lead characters and numerous examples of fragmented timelines may echo and/or reference the [[many worlds interpretation]] of quantum physics and perhaps Lynch's broader interest in quantum physics/ quantum theory.<ref>David Lynch on World Peace From the Quantum Level https://www.tm.org/blog/video/world-peace-from-the-quantum-level-david-lynch-and-john-hagelin/</ref> Some have also suggested that Lynch's love for the 1958 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', which employs a split lead character (the Judy Barton and Madeleine Elster characters, both portrayed by [[Kim Novak]]) may have had an influence on this aspect of Lynch's work.<ref>David Lynch Attends Vertigo Screening http://cinearchive.org/post/116927300550/david-lynch-watching-vertigo-the-most-studied</ref><ref>10 Films Influenced by Vertigo http://www.indiewire.com/2015/04/9-great-films-influenced-by-alfred-hitchcocks-vertigo-62999/</ref>\n\nHe frequently tends to have characters that have supernatural and omnipotent qualities. They can be seen as physical manifestations of various different concepts, such as hatred or fear. Examples of these characters are The Man Inside the Planet from ''Eraserhead'', Bob from ''Twin Peaks'', The Mystery Man from ''Lost Highway'', The Bum in ''Mulholland Drive'', and The Phantom in ''Inland Empire''. Lynch approaches his characters and film content in a way that steeps them in a dream state rather than reality.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/09/david-lynch-racial-politics.html|title=What Does David Lynch Have to Say About Race?|last=Guan|first=Frank|work=Vulture|access-date=November 15, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Recurring collaborators===\n{{Main|List of frequent David Lynch collaborators}}\nLynch is also widely noted for his collaborations with various production artists and composers on his films and other productions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/my-beautiful-broken-brain-the-amazing-collaboration-of-david-lynch-and-a-woman-who-video-selfied-her-a6937571.html|title=My Beautiful Broken Brain: The woman who 'video-selfied' her stroke|date=March 17, 2016|work=The Independent|access-date=March 26, 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref> He frequently works with [[Angelo Badalamenti]] to compose music for his productions, former wife [[Mary Sweeney]] as a film editor, casting director [[Johanna Ray]], and cast members [[Harry Dean Stanton]], [[Jack Nance]], [[Kyle MacLachlan]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Isabella Rossellini]], [[Grace Zabriskie]], and [[Laura Dern]].\n\n==Other work==\n\n===Painting===\n[[File:Lynch's So This is Love painting.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Lynch's painting ''So This Is Love'', 1992]]\nLynch first trained as a painter, and although he is now better known as a filmmaker, he has continued to paint. Lynch has stated that \"all my paintings are organic, violent comedies. They have to be violently done and primitive and crude, and to achieve that I try to let [[nature]] paint more than I paint.\"<ref name=\"lynch22\">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 22.</ref> Many of his works are very dark in colour, and Lynch has said this is because\n\n<blockquote>I wouldn't know what to do with [colour]. Colour to me is too real. It's limiting. It doesn't allow too much of a dream. The more you throw black into a colour, the more dreamy it gets&nbsp;... Black has depth. It's like a little egress; you can go into it, and because it keeps on continuing to be dark, the mind kicks in, and a lot of things that are going on in there become manifest. And you start seeing what you're afraid of. You start seeing what you love, and it becomes like a dream.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 20.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nMany of his works also contain letters and words added to the painting. He explains:\n\n<blockquote>The words in the paintings are sometimes important to make you start thinking about what else is going on in there. And a lot of times, the words excite me as shapes, and something'll grow out of that. I used to cut these little letters out and glue them on. They just look good all lined up like teeth&nbsp;... sometimes they become the title of the painting.<ref name=\"lynch22\"/></blockquote>\n\nLynch considers the 20th-century Irish-born British artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] to be his \"number one kinda hero painter\", stating that \"Normally I only like a couple of years of a painter's work, but I like everything of Bacon's. The guy, you know, had the stuff.\"<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nLynch was the subject of a major art retrospective at the [[Fondation Cartier]], Paris from March 3 \u2013 May 27, 2007.

In the first third of his career, he explored these themes mostly through [[horror film|horror]] and [[science fiction film|science fiction]] films such as ''[[Scanners]]'' (1981) and ''[[Videodrome]]'' (1983), although his work has since expanded beyond these genres.\n\nCronenberg's films have polarized audiences and critics alike; he has earned critical acclaim and has sparked controversy for his depictions of gore and violence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/cronenberg-defends-movie-s-naked-bathhouse-scene-1.256007|title=Cronenberg defends movie's naked bathhouse scene|date=2007-09-11|work=CTVNews|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en-CA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/09/21/david.cronenberg/|title=Director David Cronenberg: Responsible violence? - CNN.com|website=www.cnn.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}</ref> ''[[The Village Voice]]'' called him \"the most audacious and challenging narrative director in the English-speaking world\".<ref>{{cite web |author=J.

He attended high school at [[Harbord Collegiate Institute]] and [[North Toronto Collegiate Institute]]. A keen interest in science, especially [[botany]] and [[lepidopterology]], led him to enter the Honours Science program at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1963, but he switched to Honours English Language and Literature later in his first year.\n\nCronenberg's fascination with the film ''[[Winter Kept Us Warm]]'' (1966), by classmate [[David Secter]], sparked his interest in film. He began frequenting film camera rental houses, learning the art of filmmaking, and made two [[16 mm film|16mm]] films (''Transfer'' and ''From the Drain''). Inspired by the New York underground film scene, he founded the Toronto Film Co-op with Iain Ewing and [[Ivan Reitman]]. After taking a year off to travel in Europe, he returned to Canada in 1967 and graduated from [[University College, University of Toronto|University College]] at the top of his class.<ref name=fullbio>{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 8, 2012|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/86249/David-Cronenberg/biography|title=David Cronenberg: Full Biography|accessdate=April 16, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222043459/https://movies.nytimes.com/person/86249/David-Cronenberg/biography|archivedate=February 22, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAfter two short sketch films and two short [[art-house]] features (the [[Black and white|black-and-white]] ''[[Stereo (1969 film)|Stereo]]'' and the colour ''[[Crimes of the Future]]'') Cronenberg went into partnership with [[Ivan Reitman]]. The Canadian government provided financing for his films throughout the 1970s. He alternated his signature \"[[body horror]]\" films such as ''[[Shivers (film)|Shivers]]'' with projects reflecting his interest in car racing and bike gangs (''[[Fast Company (1979 film)|Fast Company]]''). ''[[Rabid (film)|Rabid]]'' provided pornographic actress [[Marilyn Chambers]] with work in a different genre. (Cronenberg's first choice for the role had been a then little-known [[Sissy Spacek]]). ''Rabid'' was a breakthrough with international distributors, and his next two horror features gained stronger support.\n\nCronenberg's films follow a definite progression: a movement from the social world to the inner life. In his early films, scientists modify human bodies, which results in the breakdown of social order (e.g. ''Shivers'', ''Rabid''). In his middle period, the chaos wrought by the scientist is more personal, (e.g. ''[[The Brood]]'', ''[[Scanners]]'', ''[[Videodrome]]''). In the later middle period, the scientist himself is altered by his experiment (e.g. his remake of ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]''). This trajectory culminates in ''[[Dead Ringers (film)|Dead Ringers]]'' in which a twin pair of [[gynecology|gynecologists]] spiral into [[codependency]] and [[drug addiction]]. His later films tend more to the psychological, often contrasting subjective and objective realities (''[[Existenz|eXistenZ]]'', ''[[M. Butterfly (film)|M. Butterfly]]'', ''[[Spider (2002 film)|Spider]]'').{{citation needed|date=November 2012|reason=No source cited yet}}\n\nCronenberg has cited [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]] as influences.<ref>{{cite book|author=Browning, Mark |date=2007|title=David Cronenberg: Author or Film-maker?|publisher= Intellect Books|isbn= 1-84150-173-5}}</ref> Perhaps the best example of a film that straddles the line between his works of personal chaos and psychological confusion is Cronenberg's 1991 \"adaptation\" of ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' (1959), his literary hero [[William S. Burroughs]]' most controversial book. The novel was considered \"unfilmable\", and Cronenberg acknowledged that a straight translation into film would \"cost 400 million dollars and be banned in every country in the world\". Instead\u2014much like in his earlier film, ''Videodrome''\u2014he consistently blurred the lines between what appeared to be reality and what appeared to be [[hallucinations]] brought on by the main character's drug addiction. Some of the book's \"moments\" (as well as incidents loosely based upon Burroughs' life) are presented in this manner within the film. Cronenberg stated that while writing the screenplay for ''[[Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch]]'' (1991), he felt a moment of [[synergy]] with Burroughs' writing style. He felt the connection between his screenwriting style and Burroughs' prose style was so strong, that he jokingly remarked that should Burroughs pass on, \"I'll just write his next book.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2012|reason=No source cited yet}}\n\nCronenberg has said that his films should be seen \"from the point of view of the disease\", and that in ''Shivers'', for example, he identifies with the characters ''after'' they become infected with the anarchic parasites. Disease and disaster, in Cronenberg's work, are less problems to be overcome than agents of [[Morphological freedom|personal transformation]]. Of his characters' transformations, Cronenberg said, \"But because of our necessity to impose our own structure of perception on things we look on ourselves as being relatively stable. But, in fact, when I look at a person I see this maelstrom of organic, chemical and electron chaos; volatility and instability, shimmering; and the ability to change and transform and transmute.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Gordon, Bette|url=http://bombsite.com/issues/26/articles/1160 |title=David Cronenberg|work=[[BOMB Magazine]]|date= Winter 1989|accessdate= July 25, 2011}}</ref> Similarly, in ''[[Crash (1996 film)|Crash]]'' (1996), people who have been injured in car crashes attempt to view their ordeal as \"a fertilizing rather than a destructive event\". In 2005, Cronenberg publicly disagreed with [[Paul Haggis]]' choice of the same name for the latter's [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (2004), arguing that it was \"very disrespectful\" to the \"important and seminal\" [[Crash (J. G. Ballard novel)|J.G. Ballard novel]] on which Cronenberg's film was based.<ref>{{cite news|title=Double Trouble |work=Slate Magazine |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2118602/fr/nl/ |date=May 12, 2005 |accessdate=December 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAside from ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'' (1986), Cronenberg has not generally worked within the world of big-budget, mainstream [[Hollywood]] filmmaking, although he has had occasional near misses. At one stage he was considered by [[George Lucas]] as a possible director for ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983) but was passed over. Cronenberg also worked for nearly a year on a version of ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990), but experienced \"creative differences\" with producers [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and [[Ronald Shusett]]; a different version of the film was eventually made by [[Paul Verhoeven]]. A fan of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s, author of \"We Can Remember it For You Wholesale\", the short story upon which the film was based, Cronenberg related in the biography/overview of his work, [[''Cronenberg on Cronenberg'' (1992)]] that his dissatisfaction with what he envisioned the film to be and what it ended up being pained him so greatly that for a time, he suffered a [[migraine]] just thinking about it, akin to a needle piercing his eye.<ref>{{cite book|author=Cronenberg, David|title=Cronenberg on Cronenberg|date=1992|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/901380.Cronenberg_On_Cronenberg|isbn=9780571144365|publisher=Faber & Faber}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1990s, Cronenberg was announced as director of a sequel to another Verhoeven film, ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), but this also fell through. His thriller ''[[A History of Violence]]'' (2005) is one of his highest budgeted and most accessible to date. He has said that the decision to direct it was influenced by his having had to defer some of his salary on the low-budgeted ''[[Spider (2002 film)|Spider]]'' (2002), but it was one of his most critically acclaimed films to date, along with ''[[Eastern Promises]]'' (2007), a film about the struggle of one man to gain power in the Russian Mafia.\n\n[[File:Director DAVID CRONENBERG of the film 'Spider' during the Toronto International Film Festival.jpg|thumb|left|Cronenberg at the 2011 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]]]\nCronenberg has collaborated with composer [[Howard Shore]] on all of his films since ''[[The Brood]]'' (1979), (see [[List of noted film director and composer collaborations]]) with the exception of ''The Dead Zone'' (1983), which was scored by [[Michael Kamen]]. Other regular collaborators include actor Robert Silverman, [[art director]] Carol Spier, [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]] Bryan Day, film editor Ronald Sanders, his sister, [[costume designer]] [[Denise Cronenberg]], and, from 1979 until 1988, [[cinematographer]] Mark Irwin. In 2008, Cronenberg directed Howard Shore's first opera, ''[[The Fly (opera)|The Fly]]''.\n\nSince ''Dead Ringers'' (1988), Cronenberg has worked with cinematographer [[Peter Suschitzky]] on each of his films (see [[List of film director and cinematographer collaborations]]). Suschitzky was the director of photography for ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), and Cronenberg remarked that Suschitzky's work in that film \"was the only one of those movies that actually looked good\",<ref>{{cite web |title=David Cronenberg Re-Examines David Cronenberg |publisher=Film Freak Central |url=http://www.filmfreakcentral.net/notes/dcronenbergretrointerview.htm |date=March 9, 2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030401142610/http://filmfreakcentral.net/notes/dcronenbergretrointerview.htm |archivedate=April 1, 2003 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> which was a motivating factor to work with him on ''Dead Ringers''.\n\nHaving worked with many Hollywood stars, Cronenberg says that he did not get to make a film with an actor he wanted to work with for a long time, [[Burt Reynolds]]. Cronenberg remains a staunchly Canadian filmmaker, with nearly all of his films (including major studio vehicles ''The Dead Zone'' and ''The Fly'') having been filmed in his home province Ontario. Notable exceptions include ''[[M. Butterfly (film)|M. Butterfly]]'' (1993), most of which was shot in China, ''Spider'', and ''[[Eastern Promises]]'' (2007), which were both filmed primarily in England, and ''[[A Dangerous Method]]'' (2011), which was filmed in Germany and Austria. ''Rabid'' and ''Shivers'' were shot in and around [[Montreal]]. Most of his films have been at least partially financed by [[Telefilm Canada]], and Cronenberg, a vocal supporter of government-backed film projects, has said: \"Every country needs [a system of government [[Grant (money)|grants]]] in order to have a national cinema in the face of Hollywood\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Phipps |first=Keith |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22500 |title=David Cronenberg |work=[[The A.V.

Most of his roles are [[cameo appearance]]s, as in the films ''[[Into the Night (film)|Into the Night]]'' (1985), ''[[Blood and Donuts]]'' (1995), ''[[To Die For]]'' (1995), and ''[[Jason X]]'' (2002) and the television series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', but on occasion he has played major roles, as in ''[[Nightbreed]]'' (1990) and ''[[Last Night (1998 film)|Last Night]]'' (1998). He has not played major roles in any of his own films, but he did put in a brief appearance as a gynecologist in ''The Fly''; he can also be glimpsed among the sex-crazed hordes in ''Shivers''; he can be heard as an unseen car-pound attendant in ''Crash''; his hands can be glimpsed in ''[[eXistenZ]]'' (1999); and he appeared as a stand-in for [[James Woods]] in ''Videodrome'' for shots in which Woods' character wore a helmet that covered his head.\n\nIn 2008, Cronenberg realized two extra-cinematographic projects: the exhibition ''Chromosomes'' at the [[Rome Film Fest]], and the opera ''The Fly'' at the LaOpera in Los Angeles and Theatre Ch\u00e2telet in Paris. In July 2010, Cronenberg completed production on ''[[A Dangerous Method]]'' (2011), an adaptation of [[Christopher Hampton]]'s play ''The Talking Cure'', starring [[Keira Knightley]], [[Michael Fassbender]], and frequent collaborator [[Viggo Mortensen]]. The film was produced by independent British producer [[Jeremy Thomas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theplaylist.blogspot.com/2010/03/viggo-mortensen-replaces-christoph.html |title=Viggo Mortensen Replaces Christoph Waltz As Sigmund Freud in David Cronenberg's 'The Talking Cure' |website=The Playlist |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Keira Knightley Takes The Talking Cure | url=http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=26588|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|date=December 23, 2009 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, his film ''[[Cosmopolis (film)|Cosmopolis]]'' competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Official Selection\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/58878.html |title=2012 Official Selection |accessdate=April 19, 2012 |website=Cannes Film Festival}}</ref><ref name=\"timeout\">{{cite news|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2547/cannes-film-festival-2012-line-up-announced |title=Cannes Film Festival 2012 line-up announced |accessdate=April 19, 2012 |work=Timeout}}</ref>\n\nIn the October 2011 edition of ''[[Rue Morgue (magazine)|Rue Morgue]]'', Cronenberg stated that he has written a companion piece to his 1986 remake of ''The Fly'', which he would like to direct if given the chance.

The third child of racing driver [[Ralph Earnhardt]] and first of two to Martha Coleman, he began his career in 1975 in the [[1975 World 600|World 600]] as part of the [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]].\n\nRegarded as one of the most significant drivers in NASCAR history,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/lists/Ranking-the-20-greatest-NASCAR-drivers-of-all-time|title=Ranking the 20 greatest NASCAR drivers of all time|work=Fox Sports|accessdate=May 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>http://www.carophile.org/greatest-race-car-drivers-of-all-time/4/</ref> Earnhardt won a total of 76 Winston Cup races over the course of his career, including the [[1998 Daytona 500]]. He also earned seven NASCAR Winston Cup championships, tying for the most all-time with [[Richard Petty]]. This feat, accomplished in [[1994 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1994]], was not equaled again for 22 years until [[Jimmie Johnson]] in [[2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2016]]. His aggressive driving style earned him the nicknames \"'''The Intimidator'''\", \"'''The Man in Black\"''', and \"'''The Count of Monte Carlo'''\". Also, his success at the [[restrictor plate]] tracks of Daytona and Talladega earned him the nickname, \"'''Mr. Restrictor Plate\"'''.\n\nIn February 2001, Earnhardt [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|was killed instantly]] in a collision during the final lap of the [[2001 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], an event that was widely lamented in the racing industry.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.carsandracingstuff.com/library/e/earnhardtdale.php | title = Dale Earnhardt | work = The Crittenden Automotive Library | accessdate = May 7, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Lars|last=Anderson|title=Number 3 Still Roars Ten Years After: Dale Earnhardt died in the 2001 Daytona 500, but even as the green flag flies for this year's race and a new Sprint Cup season, his legacy is felt throughout the sport\u2014and in the lives of three men in particular|date=February 21, 2011|publisher=Time Inc|work=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1182014/index.htm|accessdate=February 21, 2011}}</ref> Earnhardt has been inducted into numerous halls of fame, including the [[NASCAR Hall of Fame]] inaugural class in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascarhall.com/media/news/inaugural-nascar-hall-of-fame-class-announced|title=Inaugural NASCAR Hall of Fame Class Announced|work=[[NASCAR Hall of Fame]]|date=October 14, 2009|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early and personal life===\nOf [[German Americans|German ancestry]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/earnhardt.html|title=Ancestry of Dale Earnhardt Jr.|publisher=}}</ref> Dale Earnhardt was born on April 29, 1951, in [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]], as the third child of Martha (Coleman) and [[Ralph Earnhardt]]. Earnhardt's father was one of the best short-track drivers in North Carolina at the time and won his first and only NASCAR Sportsman Championship in 1956 at [[Greenville Pickens Speedway]] in [[Greenville, South Carolina]]. Although Ralph did not want his son to pursue a career as a race car driver, Dale dropped out of school to pursue his dreams. Ralph was a hard teacher for Dale, and after Ralph died of a [[heart attack]] at his home in 1973 at age 45, it took many years before Dale felt as though he had finally \"proven\" himself to his father. Earnhardt had four siblings: two brothers, Danny and Randy (died 2013);<ref>{{cite web|last=Caraviello|first=David|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/07/28/dale-earnhardt-junior-sees-struggles-on-off-track-at-indy.html|title=Earnhardt meets struggles on, off track at Indy|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=July 28, 2013|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}</ref> and two sisters, Cathy and Kaye.\n\nIn 1968, at the age of 17, Earnhardt married his first wife, Latane Brown. With her, Earnhardt fathered his first son, [[Kerry Earnhardt|Kerry]], a year later. Earnhardt and Latane divorced in 1970. In 1971, Earnhardt married his second wife, Brenda Gee, the daughter of NASCAR car builder Robert Gee. In his marriage with Gee, Earnhardt had two more children: a daughter, [[Kelley Earnhardt Miller|Kelley King Earnhardt]], in 1972, and a son, [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.|Ralph Dale Earnhardt Jr.]], in 1974. Not long after Dale Jr. was born, Earnhardt and Gee divorced. Earnhardt then married his third and final wife, [[Teresa Earnhardt|Teresa Houston]] ([[Tommy Houston]]'s niece), in 1982. She gave birth to their daughter, Taylor Nicole Earnhardt, in 1988. Taylor and her husband, Brandon Putnam, are professional [[rodeo]] performers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Sam|url=http://www.oleantimesherald.com/sports/article_76cd428c-21e9-11e5-9931-ffa4325f22b0.html|title=A familiar name at Ellicottville rodeo|work=Olean Times Herald|date=July 4, 2015|accessdate=July 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==NASCAR career==\n\n===Early Winston Cup career (1975\u20131978)===\nEarnhardt began his professional career in the [[Winston Cup]] in 1975, making his debut at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in North Carolina in the longest race on the Cup circuit\u2014the [[1975 World 600]]. He drove the No. 8 Ed Niegre Dodge Charger and finished 22nd in that race, just one spot ahead of his future car owner, [[Richard Childress]]. Earnhardt competed in eight more races until 1979.\n\n===Rod Osterlund Racing (1979\u20131980)===\nWhen he joined car owner [[Rod Osterlund|Rod Osterlund Racing]] in a season that included a rookie class of future stars including Earnhardt, [[Harry Gant]], and [[Terry Labonte]] in his rookie season, Earnhardt won one race at [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]], captured four poles, scored eleven Top 5s and seventeen Top 10s, and finished seventh in the points standings despite missing four races due to a broken collarbone, winning [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] honors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caraviello|first=David|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/1/20/top-10-nascar-rookies-tony-stewart-jimmie-johnson-dale-earnhardt.html|title=TOP 10 ROOKIE CAMPAIGNS AT NASCAR'S HIGHEST LEVEL|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=January 20, 2014|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring his sophomore season, Earnhardt, now with 20-year-old Doug Richert as his crew chief, began the season winning the [[Budweiser Shootout|Busch Clash]]. With wins at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]], Bristol, [[Music City Motorplex|Nashville]], [[Martinsville Speedway|Martinsville]], and Charlotte, Earnhardt won his first [[Winston Cup]] points championship. He is the only driver in NASCAR Winston Cup history to follow a Rookie of the Year title with a NASCAR Winston Cup Championship the next season. He was also the third driver in NASCAR history to win both the Rookie of the Year and Cup Series championship, following [[David Pearson (NASCAR driver)|David Pearson]] (1960, 1966) and Richard Petty (1959, 1964). Only seven drivers have joined this exclusive club since: [[Rusty Wallace]] (1984, 1989), [[Alan Kulwicki]] (1986, 1992), [[Jeff Gordon]] (1993, 1995), [[Tony Stewart]] (1999, 2002), [[Matt Kenseth]] (2000, 2003), [[Kevin Harvick]] (2001, 2014), and [[Kyle Busch]] (2005, 2015).\n\n===Rod Osterlund Racing, Stacy Racing, and Richard Childress Racing (1981)===\nIn 1981, after Osterlund sold his team to [[Jim Stacy|J. D. Stacy]], Earnhardt left for [[Richard Childress Racing]] and finished the season seventh in the points standings but winless.\n\n===Bud Moore Engineering (1982\u20131983)===\n[[File:DaleEarnhardt15racecar1983.jpg|right|thumb|Earnhardt's 1983 Ford Thunderbird]] \nThe following year, at [[Richard Childress|Childress's]] suggestion, Earnhardt joined car owner [[Bud Moore (NASCAR owner)|Bud Moore]] for the 1982 and 1983 seasons driving the No. 15 [[Wrangler Jeans]]-sponsored [[Ford Thunderbird]] (the only full-time Ford ride in his career). During the 1982 season, Earnhardt struggled. Although he won at [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]], he failed to finish 15 races and completed the season 12th in points, the worst of his career. He also suffered a broken kneecap at Pocono Raceway when he flipped after contact with [[Tim Richmond]]. In 1983, Earnhardt rebounded and won his first of 12 [[Daytona 500#Qualifying procedure|Twin 125]] Daytona 500 qualifying races. He won at Nashville and at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]], finishing eighth in the points standings.\n\n===Return to Richard Childress Racing (1984\u20132001)===\n\n====1984\u20131985====\nAfter the 1983 season, Earnhardt returned to [[Richard Childress Racing]], replacing Ricky Rudd in the No. 3. Rudd went to Bud Moore's No. 15, replacing Earnhardt. Wrangler sponsored both drivers at their respective teams. During the 1984 and 1985 seasons, Earnhardt went to victory lane six times, at Talladega, Atlanta, [[Richmond International Raceway|Richmond]], Bristol (twice), and Martinsville, where he finished fourth and eighth in the season standings respectively.\n\n====1986\u20131987====\nThe 1986 season saw Earnhardt win his second career Winston Cup Championship and the first owner's championship for RCR. He won five races and had ten Top 5s and sixteen Top 10s. Earnhardt successfully defended his championship the following year, going to victory lane eleven times and winning the championship by 489 points over [[Bill Elliott]]. In the process, Earnhardt set a NASCAR modern era record of four consecutive wins and won five of the first seven races. In the 1987 season, he earned the nickname \"The Intimidator\", due in part to the 1987 Winston All-Star Race. During this race, Earnhardt was briefly forced into the infield grass but kept control of his car and returned to the track without giving up his lead. The maneuver is now referred to as the \"'''Pass in the Grass'''\", even though Earnhardt did not pass anyone while he was off the track.\n\n====1988\u20131989====\nThe 1988 season saw Earnhardt racing with a new sponsor, [[GM Certified Service|GM Goodwrench]], after [[Wrangler Jeans]] dropped its sponsorship in 1987. During this season, he changed the color of his paint scheme from [[blue]] and [[yellow]] to the signature [[black]] in which the No. 3 car was painted for the rest of his life.  He won three races in 1988, finishing third in the points standings behind Bill Elliott in first and Rusty Wallace in second. The following year, Earnhardt won five races, but a late spin out at [[North Wilkesboro Speedway|North Wilkesboro]] arguably cost him the 1989 championship, as Rusty Wallace edged him out for it. It was his first season for the [[GM Certified Service|GM Goodwrench]] [[Chevrolet Lumina]].\n\n====1990====\nThe 1990 season started for Earnhardt with victories in the [[Budweiser Shootout|Busch Clash]] and his heat of the [[Gatorade Duel|Gatorade Twin 125's]]. Near the end of the [[Daytona 500]], he had a dominant forty-second lead when the final caution flag came out with a handful of laps to go. When the green flag waved, Earnhardt was leading [[Derrike Cope]]. On the final lap, Earnhardt ran over a piece of metal,  which was later revealed as a [[bell housing]], in turn 4, cutting down a tire. Cope, in an upset, won the race while Earnhardt finished fifth after leading 155 of the 200 laps. The No. 3 Goodwrench-sponsored Chevy team took the flat tire that cost them the win and hung it on the shop wall as a reminder of how close they had come to winning the Daytona 500.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caraviello|first=David|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/3/6/top-10-bad-luck-moments-las-vegas.html|title=TOP 10 BAD LUCK MOMENTS IN NASCAR|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=March 6, 2014|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref> Earnhardt won nine races that season and won his fourth Winston Cup title, beating [[Mark Martin]] by 26 points. He also became the first multiple winner of the annual all-star race, The Winston.\n\n====1991====\nThe 1991 season saw Earnhardt win his fifth Winston Cup championship. This season, he scored four wins and won the championship by 195 points over [[Ricky Rudd]]. One of his wins came at [[North Wilkesboro Speedway|North Wilkesboro]], in a race where [[Harry Gant]] had a chance to set a single-season record by winning his fifth consecutive race, breaking a record held by Earnhardt. Late in the race, Gant lost his brakes, which gave Earnhardt the chance he needed to make the pass for the win and maintain his record.\n\n====1992====\nEarnhardt's only win of the 1992 season came at Charlotte, in the [[Coca-Cola 600]], ending a 13-race win streak by Ford teams. Earnhardt finished a career-low 12th in the points for the second time in his career, and the only time he had finished that low since joining RCR. He still made the trip to the annual Awards Banquet with Rusty Wallace but did not have the best seat in the house. Wallace stated he and Earnhardt had to sit on the backs of their chairs to see, and Earnhardt said, \"This sucks, I could have gone hunting.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/columns/story?columnist=mcgee_ryan&id=3736700 |title=Ryan McGee: Best and worst of NASCAR Sprint Cup banquet nights past&nbsp;\u2014 ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=January 12, 2009 |accessdate=December 17, 2010}}</ref> At the end of the year, longtime crew chief [[Kirk Shelmerdine]] left to become a driver. [[Andy Petree]] took over as crew chief.\n\n====1993====\nHiring Petree turned out to be beneficial, as Earnhardt returned to the front in 1993. He once again came close to a win at the Daytona 500 and dominated Speedweeks before finishing second to [[Dale Jarrett]] on a last-lap pass. Earnhardt scored six wins en route to his sixth Winston Cup title, including wins in the first prime-time Coca-Cola 600 and The Winston both at Charlotte, and the [[Coke Zero 400|Pepsi 400]] at Daytona. He beat Rusty Wallace for the championship by 80 points. On November 14, 1993, after the Hooters 500 (Atlanta), the last race of that season, the race winner Wallace and 1993 series champion Dale Earnhardt ran a dual Polish Victory Lap together while carrying #28 and #7 flags commemorating [[Davey Allison]] and [[Alan Kulwicki]], both drivers died during the season, respectively.\n\n[[File:Dale Sr 1994.jpg|thumb|Earnhardt's [[1994 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1994]] racecar]]\n\n====1994====\nIn 1994, Earnhardt achieved a feat that he himself had believed to be impossible\u2014he scored his seventh Winston Cup championship, tying [[Richard Petty]]. He was very consistent, scoring four wins, and after [[Ernie Irvan]] was sidelined due to a near-deadly crash at Michigan (the two were neck-and-neck at the top of the points up until the crash), won the title by over 400 points over Mark Martin. Earnhardt sealed the deal at Rockingham by winning the race over [[Rick Mast]]. It was his final NASCAR championship and his final season for the [[GM Certified Service|GM Goodwrench]] [[Chevrolet Lumina]].\n\n====1995====\nEarnhardt started off the 1995 season by finishing second in the Daytona 500 to [[Sterling Marlin]]. He won five races in 1995, including his first [[road course]] victory at [[Infineon Raceway|Sears Point]]. He also won the [[Allstate 400 at The Brickyard|Brickyard 400]] at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], a win he called the biggest of his career. But in the end, Earnhardt lost the championship to [[Jeff Gordon]] by 34 points. The [[GM Certified Service|GM Goodwrench]] racing team changed to [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]s.\n\n====1996====\n[[File:Dale Earnhardt - NASCAR Photography By Darryl Moran.jpg|thumb|right|Earnhardt at [[Phoenix International Raceway]].]]\n1996 for Earnhardt started just like it had done in 1993\u2014he dominated Speedweeks, only to finish second in the [[1996 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] to [[Dale Jarrett]] for the second time. He won early in the year, scoring consecutive victories at [[Rockingham Speedway|Rockingham]] and Atlanta. On July 28 in the [[AMP Energy 500|DieHard 500]] at Talladega, he was in the points lead and looking for his eighth season title, despite the departure of crew chief Andy Petree. Late in the race, [[Ernie Irvan]] lost control of his No. 28 [[Havoline]]-sponsored Ford Thunderbird, made contact with the No. 4 Kodak-sponsored Chevy Monte Carlo of [[Sterling Marlin]], and ignited a crash that saw Earnhardt's No. 3 Chevrolet hit the tri-oval wall nearly head-on at almost 200&nbsp;mph. After hitting the wall, Earnhardt's car flipped and slid across the track, in front of race-traffic. His car was hit in the roof and windshield. This accident, as well as a similar accident that led to the death of [[Russell Phillips]] at Charlotte, led NASCAR to mandate the \"Earnhardt Bar\", a metal brace located in the center of the windshield that reinforces the roof in case of a similar crash.  This bar is also required in NASCAR-owned [[United SportsCar Racing]] and its predecessors for road racing.\n\nRain delays had canceled the live telecast of the race, and most fans first learned of the accident during the night's sports newscasts. Video of the crash showed what appeared to be a fatal incident, but once medical workers arrived at the car, Earnhardt climbed out and waved to the crowd, refusing to be loaded onto a stretcher despite a broken collarbone, sternum, and shoulder blade. Many{{Who|date=July 2013}} thought the incident would end his season early, but Earnhardt refused to give up. The next week at Indianapolis, he started the race but exited the car on the first pit stop, allowing [[Mike Skinner (racing driver)|Mike Skinner]] to take the wheel. When asked, Earnhardt said that vacating the No. 3 car was the hardest thing he had ever done. The following weekend at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]], he drove the No. 3 Goodwrench Chevrolet to the fastest time in qualifying, earning the \"True Grit\" pole. T-shirts emblazoned with Earnhardt's face were quickly printed up, brandishing the caption, \"It Hurt So Good\". Earnhardt led for most of the race and looked to have victory in hand, but fatigue took its toll and he ended up sixth behind race winner [[Geoff Bodine]]. Earnhardt did not win again in 1996 but still finished fourth in the standings behind [[Terry Labonte]], Jeff Gordon, and Dale Jarrett. David Smith departed as crew chief of the No. 3 team and RCR at the end of the year for personal reasons, and he was replaced by [[Larry McReynolds]].\n\n====1997====\nIn 1997, Earnhardt went winless for only the second time in his career. The only (non-points) win came during Speedweeks at Daytona in the Twin 125-mile qualifying race, his record eighth-straight win in the event. Once again in the hunt for the Daytona 500 with 10 laps to go, Earnhardt was taken out of contention by a late crash which sent his car upside down on the backstretch. He hit the low point of his year when he blacked out early in the [[1997 Mountain Dew Southern 500|Mountain Dew Southern 500]] at [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]] in September, causing him to hit the wall. Afterward, he was disoriented, and it took several laps before he could find his pit stall. When asked, Earnhardt complained of double vision which made it difficult to pit. Mike Dillon (Richard Childress's son-in-law) was brought in to relieve Earnhardt for the remainder of the race. Earnhardt was evaluated at a local hospital and cleared to race the next week, but the cause of the blackout and double vision was never determined. Despite no wins, the RCR team finished the season fifth in the final standings.\n\n====1998====\n1998 saw Earnhardt finally win the [[1998 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] in his 20th attempt after being shut out in his previous 19 attempts. He began the season by winning his Twin 125-mile qualifier race for the ninth straight year, and the week before was the first to drive around the track under the newly installed lights, for coincidentally 20 times. On race day, he showed himself to be a contender early. Halfway through the race, however, it seemed that [[Jeff Gordon]] had the upper hand. But by lap 138, Earnhardt had taken the lead and thanks to a push by teammate [[Mike Skinner (racing driver)|Mike Skinner]], he maintained it. Earnhardt made it to the caution-checkered flag before [[Bobby Labonte]]. Afterwards, there was a large show of respect for Earnhardt, in which every crew member of every team lined [[pit road]] to shake his hand as he made his way to [[List of motorsport terminology#V|victory lane]]. Earnhardt then drove his No. 3 into the infield grass, starting a trend of post-race celebrations. He spun the car twice, throwing grass and leaving tire tracks in the shape of a No. 3 in the grass. He then spoke about the victory, saying, \"I have had a lot of great fans and people behind me all through the years and I just can't thank them enough. The Daytona 500 is ours. We won it, we won it, we won it!\" The rest of the season did not go as well, and the 500 was his only victory that year. Despite that, he did almost pull off a Daytona sweep, where he was one of the contenders for the win in the first nighttime Pepsi 400, but a pit stop late in the race in which a rogue tire cost him the race win. He slipped to 12th in the point standings halfway through the season, and Richard Childress decided to make a crew chief change, taking [[Mike Skinner (racing driver)|Mike Skinner]]'s crew chief [[Kevin Hamlin]] and putting him with Earnhardt while giving Skinner [[Larry McReynolds]] (Earnhardt's crew chief). Earnhardt finished eighth in the final standings.\n\n====1999====\nBefore the 1999 season, fans began discussing Earnhardt's age and speculating that with his son, [[Dale Earnhardt Jr|Dale Jr.]], making his Winston Cup debut, Earnhardt might be contemplating retirement. Earnhardt swept both races for the year at Talladega, leading some to conclude that his talent had become limited to the restrictor plate tracks, which require a unique skill set and an exceptionally powerful racecar to win. But halfway through the year, Earnhardt began to show some of the old spark. In the August race at Michigan, he led laps late in the race and nearly pulled off his first win on a non-restrictor-plate track since 1996.\n\nOne week later, he provided NASCAR with one of its most controversial moments. At the [[1999 Goody's Headache Powder 500|Bristol night race]], Earnhardt found himself in contention to win his first short track race since Martinsville in 1995. When a caution came out with 15 laps to go, leader Terry Labonte got hit from behind by the lapped car of [[Darrell Waltrip]]. His spin put Earnhardt in the lead with five cars between him and Labonte with 5 laps to go. Labonte had four fresh tires, and Earnhardt was driving on old tires, which made Earnhardt's car considerably slower. Labonte caught Earnhardt and passed him coming to the [[white flag]], but Earnhardt drove hard into turn two, bumping Labonte and spinning him around. Earnhardt collected the win while spectators booed and made obscene gestures. \"I didn't mean to turn him around, I just wanted to rattle his cage,\" Earnhardt said of the incident. He finished seventh in the standings that year.\n\n====2000====\n[[File:Dale Earnhardt drives a Bomb Lift Truck.jpg|thumb|As part of a Winston No Bull 5 fan contest, Earnhardt drove a Bomb Lift Truck and attempts to load an [[AIM-120 AMRAAM|AIM-120 advanced medium-range air-to-air missile (AMRAAM)]] missile as he competes in a load crew competition at [[Langley Air Force Base]], Virginia, September 2000.  Coincidentally, this position on a load crew is known unofficially as \"Jammer Driver\" or officially as Number ''3'' man.]]\nIn the 2000 season, Earnhardt had a resurgence, which was commonly attributed to neck surgery he underwent to correct a lingering injury from his 1996 Talladega crash. He scored what were considered the two most exciting wins of the year\u2014winning by 0.010 seconds over [[Bobby Labonte]] at Atlanta, then gaining seventeen positions in the final four laps to win at Talladega, claiming his only [[Winston Million|No Bull]] million-dollar bonus along with his record 10th win at the track. Earnhardt also had second-place runs at Richmond and Martinsville, tracks where he had struggled through the late 1990s. On the strength of those performances, Earnhardt got to second in the standings. However, poor performances at the road course of Watkins Glen, where he wrecked coming out of the [[chicane]], a wreck with [[Kenny Irwin Jr.]] while leading the spring race at Bristol, and mid-pack runs at intermediate tracks like Charlotte and Dover in a season dominated by the Ford Taurus in those tracks from Roush, Yates, and Penske, coupled with Labonte's extreme consistency, denied Earnhardt an eighth championship title.\n\n===Death===\n{{main|Death of Dale Earnhardt}}\n[[File:2001DaleSrCrash.jpg|thumb|right|The final-lap crash that took Earnhardt's life. He and [[Ken Schrader]] (No. 36) have just made contact with each other.]]\nDuring the [[2001 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] at [[Daytona International Speedway]] on February 18, 2001, Earnhardt was killed in a three-car crash on the final lap of the race. He collided with [[Ken Schrader]] after making small contact with [[Sterling Marlin]] and hit the outside wall head-on. Earnhardt's and Schrader's cars both slid off the track's asphalt banking into the infield grass just inside of turn 4. Seconds later, his driver [[Michael Waltrip]] won the race, with his teammate and son [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] finishing second.<ref name=\"rpm\">{{cite news|url=http://static.espn.go.com/rpm/wc/2001/0218/1093772.html|title=Earnhardt dies instantly of head injuries|work=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|agency=Associated Press|date=February 18, 2001|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/021901/spr_5436772.html|title=Earnhardt killed|work=Jacksonville.com|publisher=The Florida Times Union|date=February 19, 2001|accessdate=January 25, 2013}}</ref> Earnhardt's death was officially pronounced at the [[Halifax Health|Halifax Medical Center]] at 5:16 PM [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]] (22:16 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]); he was 49 years old.

After driver Sterling Marlin and his relatives received hate mail and death threats from angry fans, Waltrip and Earnhardt Jr. absolved him of any responsibility. Richard Childress made a public pledge that the number 3 would never again adorn the side of a black race car with a GM Goodwrench sponsorship. Childress, who holds the rights from NASCAR to the No.3, placed a moratorium on using it; the number returned for the [[2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2014 season]], driven by Childress's grandson [[Austin Dillon]].\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=\"No fire could burn his character.

Childress' second-year Busch Series driver [[Kevin Harvick]] was named as Earnhardt's replacement, beginning with the [[2001 Dura Lube 400]] at [[North Carolina Speedway]]. Special pennants bearing the No.3 were distributed to everyone at the track to honor Earnhardt, and the Childress team wore blank uniforms out of respect, something which disappeared quickly and was soon replaced by the previous GM Goodwrench Service Plus uniforms. Harvick's car always displayed the Earnhardt stylized number 3 on the \"B\" posts (metal portion on each side of the car to the rear of the front windows) above the number 29 until the end of 2013, when he departed for [[Stewart-Haas Racing]].\n\nFans began honoring Earnhardt by holding three fingers aloft on the third lap of every race, a black screen of No. 3 in the beginning of ''[[NASCAR Thunder 2002]]'' before the [[EA Sports]] logo, and the television coverage of ''[[NASCAR on Fox]]'' and ''[[NASCAR on NBC]]'' went silent for each third lap from Rockingham to the following year's race there in honor of Earnhardt. On-track incidents brought out the caution flag on the third lap. Three weeks after Earnhardt's death, Harvick, driving a car that had been prepared for Earnhardt, scored his first career Cup win at Atlanta. On the final lap of the [[2001 Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500]], he beat [[Jeff Gordon]] by .006 seconds (the margin being 0.004 of a second closer than Earnhardt had won over [[Bobby Labonte]] at the same race a year ago) in an identical photo finish, and the images of Earnhardt's longtime gas man [[Danny \"Chocolate\" Myers]] crying after the victory, Harvick's tire-smoking burnout on the frontstretch with three fingers held aloft outside the driver's window; and the Fox television call by [[Mike Joy]], [[Larry McReynolds]], and [[Darrell Waltrip]] concluding with \"Just like a year ago [with Earnhardt and Bobby Labonte], but he [Harvick] is gonna get him though...Gordon got loose... it's Harvick! Harvick by inches!\" are memorable to many NASCAR fans. The win was also considered [[catharsis|cathartic]] for a sport whose epicenter had been ripped away. Harvick would win another race at the inaugural event at Chicagoland en route to a ninth-place finish in the final points, and won Rookie of the Year honors along with the 2001 NASCAR Busch Series Championship.\n\n[[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.]] won five races in the 2001 season, beginning with [[Steve Park]]'s victory in the race at Rockingham just one week after Earnhardt's death. Earnhardt Jr. and Waltrip finished first and second in the series' return to Daytona in July for the [[2001 Pepsi 400|Pepsi 400]], a reverse of the finish in the Daytona 500. Earnhardt Jr. also won the fall races at Dover (first post 9/11 race) and Talladega and came to an eighth-place points finish.\n\nEarnhardt's remains were interred at his estate in Mooresville after a private funeral service on February 21, 2001.<ref name=\"OSFuneral\"/><ref name=\"LATimesFuneral\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=20861|title=Dale Earnhardt|publisher=Find a Grave|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==No. 3 car==\n[[File:DaleEarnhardtInCar.jpg|thumb|right|Earnhardt in the No. 3 car]]\nEarnhardt drove the No. 3 car for the majority of his career, spanning the early 1980s until his death in 2001. Although he had other sponsors during his career, his No. 3 is associated in fans' minds with his last sponsor [[GM Certified Service|GM Goodwrench]] and his last color scheme&nbsp;\u2014 a predominantly black car with bold red and silver trim. The black and red No. 3 continues to be one of the most famous logos in North American motor racing.\n \nA common misconception is that Richard Childress Racing \"owns the rights\" to the No. 3 in NASCAR competition (fueled by the fact that Kevin Harvick's car has a little No. 3 as an homage to Earnhardt and the usage of the No. 3 on the Camping World Series truck of [[Ty Dillon]]), but in fact no team owns the rights to this or any other number. However, according to established NASCAR procedures, RCR would have priority over other teams if and when the time came to reuse the number. RCR owns the stylized No. 3 logos used during Earnhardt's lifetime; however these rights may not prevent a future racing team from using a different No. 3 design (also, a new No. 3 team would most likely, in any case, need to create logos which fit with their sponsor's logos).\n\nIn 2004, [[ESPN]] released a made-for-TV movie entitled ''[[3: The Dale Earnhardt Story]]'', which used a new (but similarly colored) No. 3 logo. The movie was a sympathetic portrayal of Earnhardt's life, but the producers were sued for using the No. 3 logo. In December 2006, the ESPN lawsuit was settled, but details were not released to the public.\n\nIt is generally believed that current NASCAR owners have agreed never to use the No. 3 in Sprint Cup competition again, although this is not official NASCAR policy. [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] made two special appearances in 2002 in a No. 3 [[Busch Series]] car: these appearances were at the track where his father died ([[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]]) and the track where he made his first Winston Cup start ([[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]]). Earnhardt Jr. won the first of those two races, which was the season-opening event at Daytona. He also raced a No. 3 sponsored by Wrangler on July 2, 2010, for Richard Childress Racing at Daytona. In a green-white- checker finish he outran [[Joey Logano]] to win his second race in the No. 3.\n\nOtherwise, the No. 3 was missing from the national touring series until September 5, 2009, when [[Austin Dillon]], the 19-year-old grandson of Richard Childress, debuted an RCR-owned No. 3 truck in the [[Camping World Truck Series]].<ref name=\"Austin-Dillon-3\">{{cite web|author=David Caraviello |url=http://www.nascar.com/2009/news/headlines/truck/09/03/rcr.adillon.3/index.html |title=Childress grandson brings No. 3 back to national level&nbsp;\u2014 Sep 3, 2009 |publisher=Nascar.Com |date=September 3, 2009 |accessdate=December 17, 2010}}</ref> Dillon and his younger brother [[Ty Dillon]] drove No. 3s in various lower level competitions for several years, including the [[Camping World East Series]].<ref>{{cite web|author=David Caraviello |url=http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/features/03/20/adillon.driving.3.car/index.html |title=\u2013 Childress' grandson driving No. 3 car back to NASCAR&nbsp;\u2013 March 20, 2008 |publisher=Nascar.com |date=March 20, 2008 |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref>  In 2012, A.

The North Carolina Department of Transportation switched the designation of a road between Kannapolis and [[Mooresville, North Carolina|Mooresville]] near the headquarters of DEI (that used to be called NC 136) with [[North Carolina Highway 3|NC 3]], which was in [[Currituck County, North Carolina|Currituck County]]. In addition, Exit 72 off [[Interstate 35W (Texas)|Interstate 35W]], one of the entrances to [[Texas Motor Speedway]], is named \"Dale Earnhardt Way\".\n\nBetween the 2004 and 2005 JGTC (renamed [[Super GT]] from 2005) season, [[Masahiro Hasemi|Hasemi Sport]] competed in the series with a sole black G'Zox sponsored [[Nissan 350Z]] with the same number and letterset as Earnhardt on the roof.\n\nDuring the NASCAR weekend races at [[Talladega Superspeedway]] on April 29, 2006&nbsp;\u2013 May 1, 2006, the DEI cars competed in identical special black paint schemes on Dale Earnhardt Day, which is held annually on his birthday\u2014April 29. Martin Truex Jr., won the Aaron's 312 in the black car, painted to reflect Earnhardt's Intimidating Black No. 3 NASCAR Busch Grand National series car. In the Nextel Cup race on May 1, No. 8 Dale Earnhardt Jr.; No. 1 Martin Truex Jr.; and No. 15 Paul Menard competed in cars with the same type of paint scheme.\n\nOn June 18, 2006, at Michigan for the 3M Performance 400, Earnhardt Jr. ran a special vintage [[Budweiser]] car to honor his father and his grandfather [[Ralph Earnhardt]]. He finished third after rain caused the race to be cut short. The car was painted to resemble Ralph's 1956 dirt cars, and carried 1956-era Budweiser logos to complete the throwback look.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.]] (DEI) with the Dale Earnhardt Foundation, announced it will fund an annual [[undergraduate]] scholarship at [[Clemson University]] in [[Clemson, South Carolina]] for students interested in [[motorsports]] and [[automotive]] engineering.

In a tribute to all previous Daytona 500 winners, the winning drivers appeared in a lineup on stage, in chronological order.  The throwback No. 3 car stood in the infield, in the approximate position Earnhardt would have taken in the processional.  The throwback car featured the authentic 1998-era design on a current-era car, a concept similar to modern throwback jerseys in other sports.  The car was later sold in 1:64 and 1:24 scale models.\n\nThe [[Intimidator 305]] roller coaster has been open since April 2010 at [[Kings Dominion]] in [[Doswell, Virginia]].

When Yost was named [[Milwaukee Brewers]] manager, he changed jersey numbers, from No. 5 to No. 3 in Earnhardt's honor.  (No. 3 is retired by the Braves in honor of outfielder [[Dale Murphy]], so Yost could not make the change while in Atlanta.)  When Yost was named [[Kansas City Royals]] assistant coach, he wore No. 2 for the 2010 season, even when he was named manager in May 2010, but for the 2011 season, he switched back to No. 3.\n\nDuring the third lap of the 2011 Daytona 500 (a decade since Earnhardt's death), the commentators on FOX fell silent while fans raised three fingers in a similar fashion to the tributes throughout 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-20/rookie-trevor-bayne-wins-nascar-s-daytona-500-from-carl-edwards.html |title=Bayne Becomes Youngest Daytona 500 Winner as Nascar's Past, Future Unite |publisher=Bloomberg |date= February 21, 2011|accessdate=February 21, 2011 |first=Dex |last=McLuskey}}</ref>\n\nThe north entrance to New Avondale City Center in Arizona will bear the name Dale Earnhardt Drive.

His sexual preference for young men is implied in ''Dune'' and ''Children of Dune''.<ref>From ''Dune'': \"I'll be in my sleeping chambers,\" the Baron said. \"Bring me that young fellow we bought on [[Gamont]], the one with the lovely eyes.

But it was for the genetic purposes of the Bene Gesserit, by one of you.\"</ref>\n\n== Plotlines ==\n\n=== ''Dune'' ===\nAs ''Dune'' begins, a longstanding feud exists between the Harkonnens of [[Giedi Prime]] and the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] of [[Caladan]]. The Baron's intent to exterminate the Atreides line seems close to fruition as [[Leto I Atreides|Duke Leto Atreides]] is lured to the [[desert planet]] Arrakis on the pretense of taking over the valuable melange operation there. The Baron has an agent in the Atreides household: Leto's own physician, the trusted [[Suk School|Suk doctor]] [[Wellington Yueh]]. Though Suk Imperial Conditioning supposedly makes the subject incapable of inflicting harm, the Baron's twisted [[Mentat]] [[Piter De Vries]] notes:\n\n{{quote|It's assumed that ultimate conditioning cannot be removed without killing the subject. However, as [[Archimedes|someone]] once observed, given the right lever you can move a planet. We found the lever that moved the doctor.}}\n\nThe Baron has taken Yueh's wife [[Wanna (Dune)|Wanna]] prisoner, threatening her with interminable torture unless Yueh complies with his demands. Harkonnen also distracts Leto's Mentat [[Thufir Hawat]] from discovering Yueh by guiding Hawat toward another suspect: Leto's [[Bene Gesserit]] [[concubinage|concubine]] [[Lady Jessica]], of whom Hawat is already distrustful. The Atreides are soon attacked by Harkonnen forces (secretly supplemented by the seemingly unstoppable Imperial [[Sardaukar]]) as Yueh disables the protective shields around the Atreides palace on Arrakis. As instructed, Yueh takes Leto prisoner; however, desiring to slay the Baron, Yueh provides the captive Leto with a fake tooth filled with poisonous gas as a means of simultaneous [[assassination]] and [[suicide]]. De Vries kills Yueh but he also dies with Leto in the assassination attempt; however Harkonnen survives. The Baron then manipulates Hawat into his service, by convincing Hawat that Lady Jessica was the traitor and using Hawat's desire for revenge on Lady Jessica and the Emperor as motivation to assist House Harkonnen.\n\nLeto and Jessica's son [[Paul Atreides]] flee into the desert with Jessica, and both are presumed dead. Paul's [[prescience]] helps him determine the identity of Jessica's father, the \"maternal grandfather who cannot be named\" \u2014 the Baron himself.<ref name=\"Jessica's father\"/> Over the next two years, Harkonnen learns that his nephews [[Glossu Rabban]] and [[Feyd-Rautha]] are conspiring against him to usurp his throne; he lets them continue to do so, reasoning that they have to somehow learn to organize a [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]]. As punishment for a failed assassination attempt against him, Harkonnen forces Feyd to single-handedly slaughter all the female slaves who serve as Feyd's lovers. He explains that Feyd has to learn the price of failure.\n\nThe Baron's plan to assure Feyd's power is to install him as ruler of Arrakis after a period of tyrannical misrule by Rabban, making Feyd appear to be the savior of the people. However, a crisis on Arrakis begins when the mysterious [[Muad'Dib]] emerges as a leader of the native [[Fremen]] tribes against the rule of the Harkonnens. Eventually, a series of Fremen victories against Beast Rabban threaten to disrupt the trade of the spice. The [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam IV]] decides to intervene himself and arrives on Arrakis along with legions of Sardaukar forces.  Shaddam and the Baron are shocked to learn that Muad'Dib is, of course, a very-much-alive Paul Atreides. The Imperial forces fall prey to a surprise attack by the Fremen.  Part of the Fremen/Atreides strategy is to wait until a sandstorm shorts out the force field shields of the Harkonnen/Imperial transport ships, disable them with projectile weapons, and then attack with a vast assault force, using [[sandworm (Dune)|sandworm]]s under cover of the severe weather to break the enemy lines.  The Sardaukar and Harkonnen forces are trapped on the planet, astonished at the sandworm mounts and vast numbers of their attackers. Their past ruthlessness gives them little hope of quarter from the enraged Fremen.\n\nRabban dies in the initial part of the battle; the Harkonnen army is massacred to the last man and almost all the Imperial Sardaukar are killed. Baron Harkonnen himself is poisoned with a [[gom jabbar]] by Paul's young sister [[Alia Atreides]], his own granddaughter, and dies at the age of 83, with the latter also revealing her direct lineage to him just beforehand. Paul then kills Feyd in ritual combat. House Harkonnen's virtual extermination removes it as a galactic power, but Paul's ascension to the Imperial throne in Shaddam's place guarantees that Vladimir's descendants will long reign as the Imperial House Atreides.\n\n=== ''Children of Dune'' ===\nAlia had been born with her ancestral memories in the womb, a circumstance the Bene Gesserit refer to as [[abomination (Dune)|Abomination]], because in their experience it is inevitable that the individual will become possessed by the personality of one of their ancestors. In ''[[Children of Dune]]'', Alia falls victim to this prediction when she shares control of her body with the ego-memory of the Baron Harkonnen, and eventually falls under his power. Alia eventually commits [[suicide]], realizing that Harkonnen's [[consciousness]] has surpassed her abilities to contain him.\n\n=== ''Prelude to Dune'' ===\nIn the ''Prelude to Dune'' prequel series by Brian Herbert and Anderson, it is established that Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is the son and heir of [[Dmitri Harkonnen]] and his wife Victoria. Harkonnen's father had been the head of House Harkonnen and ruled the planet Giedi Prime. Trained since youth as a possible successor,  Vladimir had been eventually chosen over his half-brother [[Abulurd Harkonnen|Abulurd]] (namesake of the original). Unhappy with his brother's doings, Abulurd eventually marries Emmi Rabban and renounces the family name and his rights to the title. Under the name Abulurd Rabban, he reigns as governor of the secondary Harkonnen planet [[Lankiveil]]. Abulurd and his wife have two sons: Glossu Rabban (later nicknamed \"Beast Rabban\" after he murders his own father) and Feyd-Rautha; Vladimir later adopts the boys back into House Harkonnen, and Feyd becomes his designated heir.\n\nThe Baron's most prominent political rival is Duke Leto Atreides; the Harkonnens and the Atreides have been bitter enemies for millennia, since the [[Battle of Corrin]] that ended the [[Butlerian Jihad]]. When Emperor Shaddam IV orchestrates a plot to destroy the \"Red Duke\" Leto, the Baron eagerly lends his aid.\n\nThe young Baron Vladimir is described as an exceedingly handsome man, possessing red hair and a near-perfect physique. The Bene Gesserit [[Reverend Mother (Dune)|Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] is instructed by the Sisterhood to collect the genetic material of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (through conception) for their breeding program.  As the Baron's [[homosexuality]] is something of an open secret, Mohiam [[blackmail]]s him into having sexual relations with her and conceives his child.  When that daughter proves genetically undesirable, Mohiam kills her and returns to Harkonnen for a second try; at this point he drugs and viciously rapes her.  She exacts her retribution by infecting him with a rare, incurable disease that later causes his obesity.  Mohiam's second child with the Baron is Jessica.<ref>According to the authors, the revelation that Mohiam is Jessica's mother was pulled directly from Frank Herbert's working notes for the original ''Dune'' series.

He consults numerous doctors in the expanse of time between the ''[[Dune: House Atreides]]'' and ''Dune: House Harkonnen'', up to and including his future instrument Dr. Yueh, all of whom are ultimately no help.  To conceal this debilitation, he pretends that his obesity is due to intentional overindulgence, lest the [[Landsraad]] remove him from power. When he determines that Mohiam inflicted him with the disease, he attempts to coerce her into revealing the cure, but soon discovers that there is none.\n\nThe Baron, Duke Leto, and Jessica herself are unaware that Jessica is secretly the Baron's daughter or that he has even fathered one; in the year 10,176, the Baron's grandson Paul is born to Leto and Jessica.\n\n=== ''Hunters of Dune'' ===\nIn ''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' (2006), the continuation of the original series by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, the Baron is resurrected as a ghola (5,029 years after the death of Alia) by the [[Lost Tleilaxu]] [[Uxtal]], acting on orders from the [[Face Dancer]] [[Khrone]]. Khrone intends to use the Baron ghola to manipulate a ghola of Paul Atreides, named [[Paolo (Dune)|Paolo]]. Khrone tries various torture techniques for three years to awaken the 12-year-old Baron's genetic memories; these methods fail due to the Baron's [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] nature. Khrone is successful when he imprisons the Baron in a sensory deprivation tank for a prolonged period; the Baron's memories of his former life return. The reincarnated Baron is soon haunted by the voice of Alia in his mind; the source of this inner Alia is never explained.\n\n==In adaptations==\n[[File:McNeice as Harkonnen (2000).jpg|thumb|right|[[Ian McNeice]] as Vladimir Harkonnen in the [[Frank Herbert's Dune|''Dune'' miniseries]] (2000)]]\nIn [[David Lynch]]'s [[Dune (film)|1984 film]], Baron Harkonnen was portrayed by [[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]]. In this characterization, he is grotesquely overweight, dressed in filthy garments and covered in large, black [[pustule]]s which require constant draining and treatment. This version of the character is more overtly unstable than in the novel, screaming and laughing incoherently at any given moment and even drinking the blood of a servant after removing a \"heart plug.\" Diverging from the novel, after Alia pricks Harkonnen with the gom jabbar, she pushes him and sends him flying through a hole in the palace wall, to be devoured by a giant sandworm.\n\nBritish actor [[Ian McNeice]]'s interpretation of the Baron in the 2000 [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Frank Herbert's Dune]]'' (and its [[sequel]], 2003's ''[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune|Children of Dune]]'') is, though dramatic, somewhat lighter, more eloquent and sane in comparison to Lynch's version, and therefore more consistent with the novel. Though the Baron still takes [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] enjoyment in the suffering of others, he is portrayed as somewhat flamboyant, pompous, calculating and self-indulgent, with a tendency to speak in [[iambic pentameter]] when the mood strikes him.\n\nThough Herbert's novel ''Dune'' seems to describe Harkonnen's suspensor belt as simply enabling him to stand and walk upright rather than actually \"fly,\" both the 1984 film and the 2000 miniseries feature the Baron utilizing the suspensors to levitate off the ground and float through the air in a flying-like manner.  The later ''Prelude to Dune'' prequels also employ this floating ability. Herbert does, however, note Harkonnen floating slightly off the floor after he is killed.<ref name=\"Floating\">From ''Dune'': \"He rolled sideways in his suspensors, a sagging mass of flesh supported inches off the floor with head lolling and mouth hanging open.\"</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nThe video game ''[[Emperor: Battle for Dune]]'', whose in-game [[cut scene]]s are visually inspired by David Lynch's film, features a character named Baron Rakan Harkonnen, portrayed by [[Mike McShane]]. This Harkonnen is nearly identical to the film's version of Vladimir in both appearance (minus the belt-mounted suspensors) and personality, and also dies by poisoning.\n\n[[H. R.

One such fatal poison is secretly administered by the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnens]] to [[Thufir Hawat]], the Mentat of [[House Atreides]], in order to keep Hawat's allegiance as the only provider of the antidote<ref name=\"Dune\"/> (in the 1984 movie version, it is shown that Hawat has to milk a gruesome captive cat for the antidote every day).\n\nDe Vries is generally regarded as architect of the plan to destroy House Atreides, long-time enemy of the Harkonnens, while restoring the Baron's stewardship over the planet [[Arrakis]]. Through torture and psychological manipulation, De Vries breaks the [[Suk School|Suk conditioning]] of [[Wellington Yueh]], personal physician to House Atreides, which renders him incapable of inflicting harm on his patients. Yueh eventually betrays House Atreides. De Vries originally plans to claim [[Lady Jessica]], the [[concubine]] of [[Leto I Atreides|Duke Leto Atreides]], as his slave, but he decides to become governor of Arrakis instead.

It credits Hellman, Diffie, and Merkle as inventors.\n\n==Name==\nIn 2002, Hellman suggested the algorithm be called '''Diffie\u2013Hellman\u2013Merkle key exchange''' in recognition of Ralph Merkle's contribution to the invention of public-key cryptography (Hellman, 2002), writing:\n\n: The system...has since become known as Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange. While that system was first described in a paper by Diffie and me, it is a public key distribution system, a concept developed by Merkle, and hence should be called 'Diffie\u2013Hellman\u2013Merkle key exchange' if names are to be associated with it.

The conceptual diagram to the right illustrates the general idea of the key exchange by using colors instead of very large numbers.\n\nThe process begins by having the two parties, [[Alice and Bob]], agree on an arbitrary starting color that does not need to be kept secret (but should be different every time<ref name=imperfectfs/>); in this example, the color is yellow. Each of them selects a secret color that they keep to themselves \u2013 in this case, orange and blue-green. The crucial part of the process is that Alice and Bob each mix their own secret color together with their mutually shared color, resulting in orange-tan and light-blue mixtures respectively, and then publicly exchange the two mixed colors. Finally, each of the two mixes the color he or she received from the partner with his or her own private color. The result is a final color mixture (yellow-brown in this case) that is identical to the partner's final color mixture.\n\nIf a third party listened to the exchange, it would be computationally difficult for this party to determine the secret colors. In fact, when using large numbers rather than colors, this action is computationally expensive for modern [[supercomputer]]s to do in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n===Cryptographic explanation===\nThe simplest and the original implementation<ref name=\"Diffie 1976\" /> of the protocol uses the [[Multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplicative group of integers modulo]] ''p'', where ''p'' is [[prime number|prime]], and ''g'' is a [[Primitive root modulo n|primitive root modulo]] ''p''. These two values are chosen in this way to ensure that the resulting shared secret can take on any value from 1 to ''p''\u20131. Here is an example of the protocol, with non-secret values in <span style=\"color:blue\">blue</span>, and secret values in'''<span style=\"color:red\"> red</span>'''.\n\n# [[Alice and Bob]] agree to use a modulus ''<span style=\"color:blue\">p</span>'' = <span style=\"color:blue\">23</span> and base ''<span style=\"color:blue\">g</span>'' = 5 (which is a primitive root modulo 23).\n# Alice chooses a secret integer '''''<span style=\"color:red\">a</span>''''' = 4, then sends Bob ''<span style=\"color:blue\">A</span>'' = ''<span style=\"color:blue\">g</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">a</span>'''</sup>'' mod ''<span style=\"color:blue\">p</span>''\n#* ''<span style=\"color:blue\">A</span>'' = 5<sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">4</span>'''</sup> mod <span style=\"color:blue\">23</span> = <span style=\"color:blue\">4</span>\n# Bob chooses a secret integer '''''<span style=\"color:red\">b</span>''''' = 3, then sends Alice ''<span style=\"color:blue\">B</span>'' = ''<span style=\"color:blue\">g</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">b</span>'''</sup>'' mod ''<span style=\"color:blue\">p</span>''\n#* ''<span style=\"color:blue\">B</span>'' = 5<sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">3</span>'''</sup> mod <span style=\"color:blue\">23</span> = <span style=\"color:blue\">10</span>\n# Alice computes '''''<span style=\"color:red\">s</span>''''' = ''<span style=\"color:blue\">B</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">a</span>'''</sup>'' mod ''<span style=\"color:blue\">p</span>''\n#* '''''<span style=\"color:red\">s</span>''''' = <span style=\"color:blue\">10</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">4</span>'''</sup> mod <span style=\"color:blue\">23</span> = <span style=\"color:red\">18</span>\n# Bob computes '''''<span style=\"color:red\">s</span>''''' = ''<span style=\"color:blue\">A</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">b</span>'''</sup>'' mod ''<span style=\"color:blue\">p</span>''\n#* '''''<span style=\"color:red\">s</span>''''' = <span style=\"color:blue\">4</span><sup>'''<span style=\"color:red\">3</span>'''</sup> mod <span style=\"color:blue\">23</span> = <span style=\"color:red\">18</span>\n# Alice and Bob now share a secret (the number 18).\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have arrived at the same value s, because, under mod p,\n\n:<math>{\\color{Blue}A}^{\\color{Red}b}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p} = {\\color{Blue}g}^{\\color{Red}ab}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p} = {\\color{Blue}g}^{\\color{Red}ba}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p} = {\\color{Blue}B}^{\\color{Red}a}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p}</math><ref>{{citation | first1=F. | last1=Garzia | title=Handbook of Communications Security | page=182 | publisher=WIT Press | date=2013 | isbn=1845647688 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-KBlLnllSoC&pg=PA182 }}</ref>\n\nMore specifically,\n\n:<math>({\\color{Blue}g}^{\\color{Red}a}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p})^{\\color{Red}b}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p} = ({\\color{Blue}g}^{\\color{Red}b}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p})^{\\color{Red}a}\\bmod {\\color{Blue}p}</math>\n\nNote that only ''a'', ''b'', and (''g<sup>ab</sup>'' mod ''p'' = ''g<sup>ba</sup>'' mod ''p'') are kept secret.

Once Alice and Bob compute the shared secret they can use it as an encryption key, known only to them, for sending messages across the same open communications channel.\n\nOf course, much larger values of ''a'', ''b'', and ''p'' would be needed to make this example secure, since there are only 23 possible results of ''n'' mod 23. However, if ''p'' is a prime of at least 600 digits, then even the fastest modern computers cannot find ''a'' given only ''g'', ''p'' and ''g<sup>a</sup>'' mod ''p''. Such a problem is called the [[discrete logarithm problem]].<ref name=imperfectfs/> The computation of ''g<sup>a</sup>'' mod ''p'' is known as [[modular exponentiation]] and can be done efficiently even for large numbers.\nNote that ''g'' need not be large at all, and in practice is usually a small integer (like 2, 3, ...).\n\n===Secrecy chart===\nThe chart below depicts who knows what, again with non-secret values in <span style=\"color:blue\">blue</span>, and secret values in'''<span style=\"color:red\"> red</span>'''.

If it is not difficult for Alice to solve for Bob's private key (or vice versa), Eve may simply substitute her own private / public key pair, plug Bob's public key into her private key, produce a fake shared secret key, and solve for Bob's private key (and use that to solve for the shared secret key. Eve may attempt to choose a public / private key pair that will make it easy for her to solve for Bob's private key).\n\nAnother demonstration of Diffie\u2013Hellman (also using numbers too small for practical use) is given [http://buchananweb.co.uk/security02.aspx here].<ref>{{citation | first1=Bill | last1=Buchanan | title=Diffie\u2013Hellman Example in ASP.NET | work=Bill's Security Tips | url=http://buchananweb.co.uk/security02.aspx | accessdate=2015-08-27 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110827202606/http://buchananweb.co.uk/security02.aspx | archivedate=2011-08-27 | df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Generalization to finite cyclic groups ===\nHere is a more general description of the protocol:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BuQlBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA190#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Introduction to Cryptography|last=Buchmann|first=Johannes A.|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4419-9003-7|edition=Second|location=|pages=190\u2013191}}</ref>\n\n# Alice and Bob agree on a finite [[cyclic group]] ''G'' of order ''n'' and a [[Generating set of a group|generating]] element ''g'' in ''G''. (This is usually done long before the rest of the protocol; ''g'' is assumed to be known by all attackers.) The group ''G'' is written multiplicatively.\n# Alice picks a random [[natural number]] ''a'', where 1 \u2264 ''a'' < ''n'', and sends ''g<sup>a</sup>'' to Bob.\n# Bob picks a random natural number ''b'', which is also 1 \u2264 ''b'' < ''n'', and sends ''g<sup>b</sup>'' to Alice.\n# Alice computes (''g<sup>b</sup>'')''<sup>a</sup>''.\n# Bob computes (''g<sup>a</sup>'')''<sup>b</sup>''.\n\nBoth Alice and Bob are now in possession of the group element ''g<sup>ab</sup>'', which can serve as the shared secret key. The group ''G'' satisfies the requisite condition for secure communication if there is not an efficient algorithm for determining ''g<sup>ab</sup>'' given ''g'', ''g<sup>a</sup>'', and ''g<sup>b</sup>''.\n\nFor example, the [[Elliptic-curve Diffie\u2013Hellman|elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] protocol is a variant that uses elliptic curves instead of the multiplicative group of integers modulo p.&nbsp;Variants using [[Hyperelliptic curve cryptography|hyperelliptic curves]] have also been proposed. The [[supersingular isogeny key exchange]] is a Diffie\u2013Hellman variant that has been designed to be secure against [[quantum computers]].\n\n==Operation with more than two parties==\nDiffie\u2013Hellman key agreement is not limited to negotiating a key shared by only two participants. Any number of users can take part in an agreement by performing iterations of the agreement protocol and exchanging intermediate data (which does not itself need to be kept secret). For example, Alice, Bob, and Carol could participate in a Diffie\u2013Hellman agreement as follows, with all operations taken to be modulo ''p'':\n\n# The parties agree on the algorithm parameters ''p'' and ''g''.\n# The parties generate their private keys, named ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''.\n# Alice computes ''g<sup>a</sup>'' and sends it to Bob.\n# Bob computes ({{var|g<sup>a</sup>}})<sup>{{var|b}}</sup> = ''g<sup>ab</sup>'' and sends it to Carol.\n# Carol computes ({{var|g<sup>ab</sup>}})<sup>{{var|c}}</sup> = ''g<sup>abc</sup>'' and uses it as her secret.\n# Bob computes ''g<sup>b</sup>'' and sends it to Carol.\n# Carol computes ({{var|g<sup>b</sup>}})<sup>{{var|c}}</sup> = ''g<sup>bc</sup>'' and sends it to Alice.\n# Alice computes ({{var|g<sup>bc</sup>}})<sup>{{var|a}}</sup> = ''g<sup>bca</sup>'' = ''g<sup>abc</sup>'' and uses it as her secret.\n# Carol computes ''g<sup>c</sup>'' and sends it to Alice.\n# Alice computes ({{var|g<sup>c</sup>}})<sup>{{var|a}}</sup> = ''g<sup>ca</sup>'' and sends it to Bob.\n# Bob computes ({{var|g<sup>ca</sup>}})<sup>{{var|b}}</sup> = ''g<sup>cab</sup>'' = ''g<sup>abc</sup>'' and uses it as his secret.\n\nAn eavesdropper has been able to see ''g<sup>a</sup>'', ''g<sup>b</sup>'', ''g<sup>c</sup>'', ''g<sup>ab</sup>'', ''g<sup>ac</sup>'', and ''g<sup>bc</sup>'', but cannot use any combination of these to efficiently reproduce ''g<sup>abc</sup>''.\n\nTo extend this mechanism to larger groups, two basic principles must be followed:\n\n* Starting with an \"empty\" key consisting only of ''g'', the secret is made by raising the current value to every participant\u2019s private exponent once, in any order (the first such exponentiation yields the participant\u2019s own public key).\n* Any intermediate value (having up to ''N''-1 exponents applied, where ''N'' is the number of participants in the group) may be revealed publicly, but the final value (having had all ''N'' exponents applied) constitutes the shared secret and hence must never be revealed publicly. Thus, each user must obtain their copy of the secret by applying their own private key last (otherwise there would be no way for the last contributor to communicate the final key to its recipient, as that last contributor would have turned the key into the very secret the group wished to protect).\n\nThese principles leave open various options for choosing in which order participants contribute to keys. The simplest and most obvious solution is to arrange the ''N'' participants in a circle and have ''N'' keys rotate around the circle, until eventually every key has been contributed to by all ''N'' participants (ending with its owner) and each participant has contributed to ''N'' keys (ending with their own). However, this requires that every participant perform ''N'' modular exponentiations.\n\nBy choosing a more optimal order, and relying on the fact that keys can be duplicated, it is possible to reduce the number of modular exponentiations performed by each participant to {{math|log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') + 1}} using a [[Divide and conquer algorithms|divide-and-conquer-style]] approach, given here for eight participants:\n\n# Participants A, B, C, and D each perform one exponentiation, yielding ''g<sup>abcd</sup>''; this value is sent to E, F, G, and H. In return, participants A, B, C, and D receive ''g<sup>efgh</sup>''.\n# Participants A and B each perform one exponentiation, yielding ''g<sup>efghab</sup>'', which they send to C and D, while C and D do the same, yielding ''g<sup>efghcd</sup>'', which they send to A and B.\n# Participant A performs an exponentiation, yielding ''g<sup>efghcda</sup>'', which it sends to B; similarly, B sends ''g<sup>efghcdb</sup>'' to A. C and D do similarly.\n# Participant A performs one final exponentiation, yielding the secret ''g<sup>efghcdba</sup>'' = ''g<sup>abcdefgh</sup>'', while B does the same to get ''g<sup>efghcdab</sup>'' = ''g<sup>abcdefgh</sup>''; again, C and D do similarly.\n# Participants E through H simultaneously perform the same operations using ''g<sup>abcd</sup>'' as their starting point.\n\nOnce this operation has been completed all participants will possess the secret ''g<sup>abcdefgh</sup>'', but each participant will have performed only four modular exponentiations, rather than the eight implied by a simple circular arrangement.\n\n==Security==\nThe protocol is considered secure against eavesdroppers if ''G'' and ''g'' are chosen properly. In particular, the order of the group G must be large, particularly if the same group is used for large amounts of traffic. The eavesdropper (\"Eve\") has to solve the [[Diffie\u2013Hellman problem]] to obtain ''g''<sup>''ab''</sup>. This is currently considered difficult for groups whose order is large enough. An efficient algorithm to solve the [[discrete logarithm problem]] would make it easy to compute ''a'' or ''b'' and solve the Diffie\u2013Hellman problem, making this and many other public key cryptosystems insecure. Fields of small characteristic may be less secure.<ref>{{cite conference | first1=Razvan | last1=Barbulescu | first2=Pierrick | last2=Gaudry | first3=Antoine | last3=Joux | first4=Emmanuel | last4=Thom\u00e9 | title=A Heuristic Quasi-Polynomial Algorithm for Discrete Logarithm in Finite Fields of Small Characteristic | work=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | book-title=Advances in Cryptology \u2013 EUROCRYPT 2014 | conference=Proceedings 33rd Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques | location=Copenhagen, Denmark | volume=8441 | date=2014 | pages=1\u201316 | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-55220-5_1 | isbn=978-3-642-55220-5 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Order (group theory)|order]] of ''G'' should have a large prime factor to prevent use of the [[Pohlig\u2013Hellman algorithm]] to obtain ''a'' or ''b''. For this reason, a [[Sophie Germain prime]] ''q'' is sometimes used to calculate {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 2''q'' + 1}}, called a [[safe prime]], since the order of ''G'' is then only divisible by 2 and ''q''. ''g'' is then sometimes chosen to generate the order ''q'' subgroup of ''G'', rather than ''G'', so that the [[Legendre symbol]] of ''g<sup>a</sup>'' never reveals the low order bit of ''a''. A protocol using such a choice is for example [[Internet Key Exchange|IKEv2]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=RFC 4306 Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol |publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) |author=C.

Because of the [[random self-reducibility]] of the discrete logarithm problem a small ''g'' is equally secure as any other generator of the same group.\n\nIf Alice and Bob use [[random number generator]]s whose outputs are not completely random and can be predicted to some extent, then Eve's task is much easier.\n\nIn the original description, the Diffie\u2013Hellman exchange by itself does not provide [[authentication]] of the communicating parties and is thus vulnerable to a [[man-in-the-middle attack]]. Mallory (an active attacker executing the man-in-the-middle attack) may establish two distinct key exchanges, one with Alice and the other with Bob, effectively masquerading as Alice to Bob, and vice versa, allowing her to decrypt, then re-encrypt, the messages passed between them. Note that Mallory must continue to be in the middle, transferring messages every time Alice and Bob communicate. If she is ever absent, her previous presence is then revealed to Alice and Bob. They will know that all of their private conversations had been intercepted and decoded by someone in the channel.\n\nA method to authenticate the communicating parties to each other is generally needed to prevent this type of attack. Variants of Diffie\u2013Hellman, such as [[Station-to-Station protocol|STS protocol]], may be used instead to avoid these types of attacks.\n\n===Practical attacks on Internet traffic===\nThe [[number field sieve]] algorithm, which is generally the most effective in solving the [[discrete logarithm problem]], consists of four computational steps. The first three steps only depend on the order of the group G, not on the specific number whose finite log is desired.<ref>Whitfield Diffie, Paul C. Van Oorschot, and Michael J. Wiener \"Authentication and Authenticated Key Exchanges\", in Designs, Codes and Cryptography, 2, 107\u2013125 (1992), Section 5.2, available as Appendix B to {{US patent|5724425}}</ref> It turns out that much Internet traffic uses one of a handful of groups that are of order 1024&nbsp;bits or less.<ref name=imperfectfs/> By [[precomputing]] the first three steps of the number field sieve for the most common groups, an attacker need only carry out the last step, which is much less computationally expensive than the first three steps, to obtain a specific logarithm. The [[Logjam (computer security)|Logjam]] attack used this vulnerability to compromise a variety of Internet services that allowed the use of groups whose order was a 512-bit prime number, so called [[export of cryptography|export grade]]. The authors needed several thousand CPU cores for a week to precompute data for a single 512-bit prime. Once that was done, individual logarithms could be solved in about a minute using two 18-core Intel Xeon CPUs.<ref name=imperfectfs/>\n\nAs estimated by the authors behind the Logjam attack, the much more difficult precomputation needed to solve the discrete log problem for a 1024-bit prime would cost on the order of $100 million, well within the budget of large national [[intelligence agency]] such as the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). The Logjam authors speculate that precomputation against widely reused 1024-bit DH primes is behind claims in [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)|leaked NSA documents]] that NSA is able to break much of current cryptography.<ref name=imperfectfs/>\n\nTo avoid these vulnerabilities, authors recommend use of [[elliptic curve cryptography]], for which no similar attack is known. Failing that, they recommend that the order, ''p'', of the Diffie\u2013Hellman group should be at least 2048&nbsp;bits. They estimate that the pre-computation required for a 2048-bit prime is 10<sup>9</sup> more difficult than for 1024-bit primes.<ref name=\"imperfectfs\">{{cite web|url=https://weakdh.org/imperfect-forward-secrecy-ccs15.pdf|title=Imperfect Forward Secrecy: How Diffie\u2013Hellman Fails in Practice|last1=Adrian|first1=David|last2=Bhargavan|first2=Karthikeyan|date=October 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Durumeric|first3=Zakir|last4=Gaudry|first4=Pierrick|last5=Green|first5=Matthew|last6=Halderman|first6=J.

The first such scheme is the [[ElGamal encryption]]. A more modern variant is the [[Integrated Encryption Scheme]].\n\n===Forward secrecy===\nProtocols that achieve [[forward secrecy]] generate new key pairs for each [[session (computer science)|session]] and discard them at the end of the session. The Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange is a frequent choice for such protocols, because of its fast key generation.\n\n===Password-authenticated key agreement===\nWhen Alice and Bob share a password, they may use a [[password-authenticated key agreement]] (PK) form of Diffie\u2013Hellman to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. One simple scheme is to compare the [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of '''s''' concatenated with the password calculated independently on both ends of channel. A feature of these schemes is that an attacker can only test one specific password on each iteration with the other party, and so the system provides good security with relatively weak passwords. This approach is described in [[ITU-T]] Recommendation [[X.1035]], which is used by the [[G.hn]] home networking standard.\n\nAn example of such a protocol is the [[Secure Remote Password protocol]].\n\n===Public key===\nIt is also possible to use Diffie\u2013Hellman as part of a [[public key infrastructure]], allowing Bob to encrypt a message so that only Alice will be able to decrypt it, with no prior communication between them other than Bob having trusted knowledge of Alice's public key. Alice's public key is <math>(g^a \\bmod{p}, g, p)</math>. To send her a message, Bob chooses a random ''b'' and then sends Alice <math>g^b \\bmod p</math> (unencrypted) together with the message encrypted with symmetric key <math>(g^a)^b \\bmod{p}</math>. Only Alice can determine the symmetric key and hence decrypt the message because only she has ''a'' (the private key). A pre-shared public key also prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nIn practice, Diffie\u2013Hellman is not used in this way, with [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] being the dominant public key algorithm. This is largely for historical and commercial reasons{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}, namely that [[RSA (security firm)|RSA Security]] created a certificate authority for key signing that became [[Verisign]]. Diffie\u2013Hellman cannot be used to sign certificates. However, the [[ElGamal signature scheme|ElGamal]] and [[Digital Signature Algorithm|DSA]] signature algorithms are mathematically related to it, as well as [[MQV]], [[Station-to-Station protocol|STS]] and the [[Internet key exchange|IKE]] component of the [[IPsec]] protocol suite for securing [[Internet Protocol]] communications.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Elliptic-curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] key exchange\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"nb\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===General references===\n* {{cite book | last1=Gollman | first1=Dieter | title=Computer Security | year=2011 | edition=2nd | publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. | publication-place=West Sussex, England | isbn=0470741155 }}\n* {{cite techreport | last1=Williamson | first1=Malcolm J. | title=Non-secret encryption using a finite field | institution=Communications Electronics Security Group | date=January 21, 1974 | url=https://www.gchq.gov.uk/sites/default/files/document_files/nonsecret_encryption_finite_field_0.pdf | accessdate=2017-03-22 }}\n* {{cite techreport | last1=Williamson | first1=Malcolm J. | title=Thoughts on Cheaper Non-Secret Encryption | institution=Communications Electronics Security Group | date=August 10, 1976 | url=http://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/matyas/lecture/paper3.pdf | accessdate=2015-08-25 }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130404174201/https://cryptocellar.web.cern.ch/cryptocellar/cesg/ellis.pdf The History of Non-Secret Encryption] [[James H.

The supporting cast includes [[Mischa Auer]], [[Charles Winninger]], [[Brian Donlevy]], [[Allen Jenkins]], [[Irene Hervey]], [[Billy Gilbert]], [[Bill Cody, Jr.]], [[Lillian Yarbo]], and [[Una Merkel]]. Although the title comes from [[Max Brand]]'s [[Destry Rides Again (novel)|popular novel]], which inspired the earlier screenplay with [[Tom Mix]], this version is almost entirely unrelated to either.\n\nIn 1996, ''Destry Rides Again'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Destry-Rides-Again-1939.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]] in ''Destry Rides Again'']]\nSaloon owner Kent ([[Brian Donlevy]]), the unscrupulous boss of the fictional [[Wild West|Western]] town of Bottleneck, has the town's sheriff, Mr. Keogh ([[Joe King (actor)|Joe King]]), killed when Keogh asks one too many questions about a rigged poker game. Kent and \"Frenchy\" ([[Marlene Dietrich]]), his girlfriend and the dance hall queen, now have a stranglehold over the local cattle ranchers. The crooked town's mayor, Hiram J. Slade ([[Samuel S. Hinds]]), who is in collusion with Kent, appoints the town drunk, Washington Dimsdale ([[Charles Winninger]]), as the new sheriff, assuming that he will be easy to control and manipulate. However, Dimsdale, a deputy under the famous lawman Tom Destry, promptly swears off drinking, and is able to call upon the latter's equally formidable son, Tom Destry, Jr. ([[James Stewart]]), to help him make Bottleneck a lawful, respectable town.\n\nDestry arrives in Bottleneck with Jack Tyndall, a cattleman, and his sister, Janice. Destry initially confounds the townsfolk by refusing to strap on a gun and maintaining civility in dealing with everyone, including Kent and Frenchy. This quickly makes him a disappointment to Dimsdale and a laughingstock to the townspeople; he is mockingly asked to \"clean up\" Bottleneck by being given a mop and bucket. However, after a number of rowdy horsemen ride into town shooting their pistols in the air, he demonstrates uncanny expertise in marksmanship and threatens to jail them if they do it again, earning the respect of Bottleneck's citizens.\n\nThrough the townsmen's evasive answers regarding the whereabouts of Keogh, Destry gradually begins to suspect that Keogh was murdered. He confirms this by provoking Frenchy into admitting it, but without a location for the body, he lacks any proof. Destry therefore deputizes Boris, a Russian immigrant who Frenchy had earlier humiliated, and implies to Kent that he had found the body outside of town \"in remarkably good condition\". When Kent sends a member of his gang to check on Keogh's burial site, Boris and Dimsdale follow, capture, and jail him.\n\nAlthough the gang member is charged with Keogh's murder (in the hope that he would implicate Kent in exchange for clemency), Mayor Slade appoints himself judge of the trial, making an innocent verdict a foregone conclusion. To prevent this, Destry calls in a judge from a larger city in secret, but the plan is ruined after Boris accidentally gives away the other judge's name in the saloon. Kent orders Frenchy to invite the deputy to her house while other gang members storm the sheriff's office and cause a breakout; now in love with Destry, she accepts. When shots are fired, he rushes back, to find the cell empty and Dimsdale mortally wounded. Destry returns to his room and puts on his gun belt, abandoning his previous commitment to nonviolence.\n\nUnder Destry's command, the honest townsmen form a posse and prepare to attack the saloon, where Kent's gang is fortified, while Destry enters through the roof and looks for Kent. At Frenchy's urging, the townswomen march in between the groups, preventing further violence, before breaking into the saloon and subduing the gang. Kent narrowly escapes, and attempts to shoot Destry from the second floor; Frenchy takes the bullet for him, killing her, and Destry kills Kent.\n\nSome time later, Destry is shown to be the sheriff of a now lawful Bottleneck, repeating to children the stories that Dimsdale told him of the town's violent history. He jokingly tells a story about marriage to Janice, implying a marriage between them will soon follow.\n\n==Cast==\nAs appearing in screen credits:<ref name= \"credits\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031225/fullcredits \"Destry Rides Again credits.\"] ''IMDb.''

In the original work, Harrison (or \"Harry\") Destry was not a pacifist. As [[Destry Rides Again (1932 film)|filmed in 1932]], with [[Tom Mix]] in the starring role, the central character differed in that Destry did wear six-guns in that version.\n\nThe film was James Stewart's first western (he would not return to the genre until 1950, with ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' and ''[[Winchester 73]]'').

It was reviewed by Frank S. Nugent in ''[[The New York Times]],'' who noted that the film did not follow the usual Hollywood type-casting. On Dietrich's role, he characterized, \"It's difficult to reconcile Miss Dietrich's Frenchy, the cabaret girl of the Bloody Gulch Saloon, with the posed and posturing Dietrich we last saw in Mr. Lubitsch's 'Angel'.\" Stewart's contribution was similarly treated, \"turning in an easy, likable, pleasantly humored performance.\"<ref>Nugent, Frank S.

The [[slope]] of the tangent line is equal to the derivative of the function at the marked point.]]\n{{Calculus |differential}}\n\nThe '''derivative''' of a [[function of a real variable]] measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). Derivatives are a fundamental tool of [[calculus]].  For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to [[time]] is the object's [[velocity]]: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.\n\nThe derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the [[slope]] of the [[Tangent|tangent line]] to the [[graph of a function|graph of the function]] at that point. The tangent line is the best [[linear approximation]] of the function near that input value.  For this reason, the derivative is often described as the \"instantaneous rate of change\", the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.\n\nDerivatives may be generalized to [[function of several real variables|functions of several real variables]]. In this generalization, the derivative is reinterpreted as a [[linear transformation]] whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. The [[Jacobian matrix]] is the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables.  It can be calculated in terms of the [[partial derivative]]s with respect to the independent variables.  For a [[real-valued function]] of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the [[gradient vector]].\n\nThe process of finding a derivative is called '''differentiation'''. The reverse process is called ''[[antiderivative|antidifferentiation]]''.  The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] states that antidifferentiation is the same as [[integral|integration]]. Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.{{#tag:ref|Differential calculus, as discussed in this article, is a very well established mathematical discipline for which there are many sources. See Apostol 1967, Apostol 1969, and Spivak 1994.|group=Note}}\n\n==Differentiation==\n''Differentiation'' is the action of computing a derivative. The derivative of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} of a variable {{math|''x''}} is a measure of the rate at which the value {{math|''y''}} of the function changes with respect to the change of the variable {{math|''x''}}. It is called the ''derivative'' of {{math|''f''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}}. If {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are [[real number]]s, and if the [[graph of a function|graph]] of {{math|''f''}} is plotted against {{math|''x''}}, the derivative is the [[slope]] of this graph at each point.\n\n[[File:Wiki slope in 2d.svg|right|thumb|250px|Slope of a linear function: <math>m=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}</math>]]\nThe simplest case, apart from the trivial case of a [[constant function]], is when {{math|''y''}} is a [[linear function]] of {{math|''x''}}, meaning that the graph of {{math|''y''}} is a line. In this case, {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''mx'' + ''b''}}, for real numbers {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and the slope {{math|''m''}} is given by\n:<math>m=\\frac{\\text{change in } y}{\\text{change in } x} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x},</math>\nwhere the symbol {{math|\u0394}} ([[Delta (letter)|Delta]]) is an abbreviation for \"change in\". This formula is true because\n:<math>y+\\Delta y=f\\left( x+\\Delta x\\right) \n=m\\left( x+\\Delta x\\right) +b \n=mx +m\\,\\Delta x +b\n= y + m\\,\\Delta x. </math>\nThus, since\n:<math>y+\\Delta y=y+m\\,\\Delta x, </math>\nit follows that\n:<math> \\Delta y=m\\,\\Delta x. </math>\n\nThis gives an exact value for the slope of a line.\nIf the function {{math|''f''}} is not linear (i.e. its graph is not a straight line), however, then the change in {{math|''y''}} divided by the change in {{math|''x''}} varies: differentiation is a method to find an exact value for this rate of change at any given value of {{math|''x''}}.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 250\n | header    = Rate of change as a limit value\n | image1    = Tangent-calculus.svg\n | caption1  = '''Figure 1'''.

(The above expression is read as \"the derivative of ''y'' with respect to ''x''\", \"''dy'' by ''dx''\", or \"''dy'' over ''dx''\". The oral form \"''dy'' ''dx''\" is often used conversationally, although it may lead to confusion.)\n\nIn [[Lagrange's notation]], the derivative with respect to {{math|''x''}} of a function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is denoted {{math|''f'''(''x'')}} (read as \"''f'' prime of ''x''\") or {{math|''f<sub>x</sub>''\u2032(''x'')}} (read as \"''f'' prime ''x'' of ''x''\"), in case of ambiguity of the variable implied by the derivation. Lagrange's notation is sometimes incorrectly attributed to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].\n\n===Rigorous definition===\n[[File:Tangent animation.gif|thumb|250px|A secant approaches a tangent when <math>\\Delta x \\to 0</math>.]]\nThe most common approach to turn this intuitive idea into a precise definition is to define the derivative as a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of difference quotients of real numbers.<ref>Spivak 1994, chapter 10.</ref>  This is the approach described below.\n\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a real valued function defined in an [[open neighborhood]] of a real number {{math|''a''}}.  In classical geometry, the tangent line to the graph of the function {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}} was the unique line through the point {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} that did ''not'' meet the graph of {{math|''f''}} [[transversality (mathematics)|transversally]], meaning that the line did not pass straight through the graph.  The derivative of {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}} at {{math|''a''}} is, geometrically, the slope of the tangent line to the graph of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}.  The slope of the tangent line is very close to the slope of the line through {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and a nearby point on the graph, for example {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}.  These lines are called [[secant line]]s.  A value of {{math|''h''}} close to zero gives a good approximation to the slope of the tangent line, and smaller values (in [[absolute value]]) of {{math|''h''}} will, in general, give better [[approximation]]s.  The slope {{math|''m''}} of the secant line is the difference between the {{math|''y''}} values of these points divided by the difference between the {{math|''x''}} values, that is, \n:<math>m = \\frac{\\Delta f(a)}{\\Delta a} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{(a+h)-(a)} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nThis expression is [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[difference quotient]].  Passing from an approximation to an exact answer is done using a [[limit of a function|limit]].  Geometrically, the limit of the secant lines is the tangent line.  Therefore, the limit of the difference quotient as {{math|''h''}} approaches zero, if it exists, should represent the slope of the tangent line to {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}}.  This limit is defined to be the derivative of the function {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}}:\n\n:<math>f'(a)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\nWhen the limit exists, {{math|''f''}} is said to be ''[[differentiable function|differentiable]]'' at {{math|''a''}}.  Here {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} is one of several common notations for the derivative ([[Derivative#Notations for differentiation|see below]]).\n\nEquivalently, the derivative satisfies the property that\n:<math>\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h) - (f(a) + f'(a)\\cdot h)}{h} = 0,</math>\nwhich has the intuitive interpretation (see Figure 1) that the tangent line to {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}} gives the ''best [[linear]] approximation''\n:<math>f(a+h) \\approx f(a) + f'(a)h</math>\nto {{math|''f''}} near {{math|''a''}} (i.e., for small {{math|''h''}}). This interpretation is the easiest to generalize to other settings ([[Derivative#Total derivative, total differential and Jacobian matrix|see below]]).\n\n[[Substitution property of equality|Substituting]] 0 for {{math|''h''}} in the difference quotient causes [[division by zero]], so the slope of the tangent line cannot be found directly using this method.  Instead, define {{math|''Q''(''h'')}} to be the difference quotient as a function of {{math|''h''}}:\n\n:<math>Q(h) = \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}.</math>\n\n{{math|''Q''(''h'')}} is the slope of the secant line between {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and {{math|(''a'' + ''h'', ''f''(''a'' + ''h''))}}.  If {{math|''f''}} is a [[continuous function]], meaning that its graph is an unbroken curve with no gaps, then {{math|''Q''}} is a continuous function away from {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.  If the limit {{math|lim{{sub|''h''\u21920}}''Q''(''h'')}} exists, meaning that there is a way of choosing a value for {{math|''Q''(0)}} that makes {{math|''Q''}} a continuous function, then the function {{math|''f''}} is differentiable at {{math|''a''}}, and its derivative at {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|''Q''(0)}}.\n\nIn practice, the existence of a continuous extension of the difference quotient {{math|''Q''(''h'')}} to {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}} is shown by modifying the numerator to cancel {{math|''h''}} in the denominator. Such manipulations can make the limit value of {{math|''Q''}} for small {{math|''h''}} clear even though {{math|''Q''}} is still not defined at {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}. This process can be long and tedious for complicated functions, and many shortcuts are commonly used to simplify the process.\n\n===Definition over the hyperreals===\nRelative to a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] extension {{math|'''R''' \u2282 <sup>\u2217</sup>'''R'''}} of the real numbers, the derivative of a real function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} at a real point {{math|''x''}} can be defined as the [[shadow (mathematics)|shadow]] of the quotient {{math|{{sfrac|\u2206''y''|\u2206''x''}}}} for [[infinitesimal]] {{math|\u2206''x''}}, where {{math|\u2206''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'' + \u2206''x'') \u2212 ''f''(''x'')}}. Here the natural extension of {{math|''f''}} to the hyperreals is still denoted {{math|''f''}}. Here the derivative is said to exist if the shadow is independent of the infinitesimal chosen.\n\n===Example===\n[[File:Parabola2.svg|thumb|The squaring function]]\nThe squaring function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 3}}, and its derivative there is 6. This result is established by calculating the limit as {{math|''h''}} approaches zero of the difference quotient of {{math|''f''(3)}}:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nf'(3) & = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(3+h)-f(3)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(3+h)^2 - 3^2}{h} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{9 + 6h + h^2 - 9}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{6h + h^2}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(6 + h)}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe last expression shows that the difference quotient equals {{math|6 + ''h''}} when {{math|''h'' \u2260 0}} and is undefined when {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}, because of the definition of the difference quotient.  However, the definition of the limit says the difference quotient does not need to be defined when {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.  The limit is the result of letting {{math|''h''}} go to zero, meaning it is the value that {{math|6 + ''h''}} tends to as {{math|''h''}} becomes very small:\n\n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(6 + h)} = 6 + 0 = 6. </math>\n\nHence the slope of the graph of the squaring function at the point {{math|(3, 9)}} is {{math|6}}, and so its derivative at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 3}} is {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(3) {{=}} 6}}.\n\nMore generally, a similar computation shows that the derivative of the squaring function at {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}} is {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'') {{=}} 2''a''}}:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nf'(a) & = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{(a+h)^2 - a^2}{h} \\\\[0.3em]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{a^2 + 2ah + h^2 - a^2}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{2ah + h^2}{h} \\\\[0.3em]\n& = \\lim_{h\\to 0}{(2a + h)} = 2a\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Continuity and differentiability===\n\n[[File:Right-continuous.svg|thumb|right|This function does not have a derivative at the marked point, as the function is not continuous there (specifically, it has a [[jump discontinuity]]).]]\n\nIf {{math|''f''}} is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] at {{math|''a''}}, then {{math|''f''}} must also be [[continuous function|continuous]] at {{math|''a''}}.  As an example, choose a point {{math|''a''}} and let {{math|''f''}} be the [[step function]] that returns the value 1 for all {{math|''x''}} less than {{math|''a''}}, and returns a different value 10 for all {{math|''x''}} greater than or equal to {{math|''a''}}.  {{math|''f''}} cannot have a derivative at {{math|''a''}}.  If {{math|''h''}} is negative, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is on the low part of the step, so the secant line from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is very steep, and as {{math|''h''}} tends to zero the slope tends to infinity.  If {{math|''h''}} is positive, then {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} is on the high part of the step, so the secant line from {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''a'' + ''h''}} has slope zero.  Consequently, the secant lines do not approach any single slope, so the limit of the difference quotient does not exist.{{#tag:ref|Despite this, it is still possible to take the derivative in the sense of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]].  The result is nine times the [[Dirac measure]] centered at {{math|''a''}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}|group=Note}}\n\n[[File:Absolute value.svg|right|thumb|The absolute value function is continuous, but fails to be differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} since the tangent slopes do not approach the same value from the left as they do from the right.]]\n\nHowever, even if a function is continuous at a point, it may not be differentiable there.  For example, the [[absolute value]] function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} {{abs|''x''}} }} is continuous at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, but it is not differentiable there.  If {{math|''h''}} is positive, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to {{math|''h''}} is one, whereas if {{math|''h''}} is negative, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to {{math|''h''}} is negative one.  This can be seen graphically as a \"kink\" or a \"cusp\" in the graph at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.  Even a function with a smooth graph is not differentiable at a point where its [[Vertical tangent|tangent is vertical]]: For instance, the function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>1/3</sup>}} is not differentiable at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\nIn summary: for a function {{math|''f''}} to have a derivative it is ''[[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary]]'' for the function {{math|''f''}} to be continuous, but continuity alone is not ''[[Necessary and sufficient conditions|sufficient]]''.\n\nMost functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or at [[Almost everywhere|almost every]] point.  Early in the [[history of calculus]], many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points.  Under mild conditions, for example if the function is a [[monotone function]] or a [[Lipschitz function]], this is true.  However, in 1872 Weierstrass found the first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.  This example is now known as the [[Weierstrass function]].  In 1931, [[Stefan Banach]] proved that the set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a [[meager set]] in the space of all continuous functions.<ref>{{Citation|author=Banach, S.|title=Uber die Baire'sche Kategorie gewisser Funktionenmengen|journal=Studia.

In this case, the derivative is equal to:<math>\\sin(x^2) + 2x^2 \\cos(x^2)</math>]]\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a function that has a derivative at every point in its [[domain of a function|domain]].  We can then define a function that maps every point <math>x</math> to the value of the derivative of <math>f</math> at <math>x</math>.  This function is written {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}}} and is called the ''derivative function'' or the ''derivative of''  {{math|''f''}}.\n\nSometimes {{math|''f''}} has a derivative at most, but not all, points of its domain.  The function whose value at {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} whenever {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}} is defined and elsewhere is undefined is also called the derivative of {{math|''f''}}.  It is still a function, but its domain is strictly smaller than the domain of {{math|''f''}}.\n\nUsing this idea, differentiation becomes a function of functions: The derivative is an [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] whose domain is the set of all functions that have derivatives at every point of their domain and whose range is a set of functions.  If we denote this operator by {{math|''D''}}, then {{math|''D''(''f'')}} is the function {{math|''f''{{\u2032}}}}.  Since {{math|''D''(''f'')}} is a function, it can be evaluated at a point {{math|''a''}}.  By the definition of the derivative function, {{math|''D''(''f'')(''a'') {{=}} ''f''{{\u2032}}(''a'')}}.\n\nFor comparison, consider the doubling function given by {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}}; {{math|''f''}} is a real-valued function of a real number, meaning that it takes numbers as inputs and has numbers as outputs:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n 1 &{}\\mapsto 2,\\\\\n 2 &{}\\mapsto 4,\\\\\n 3 &{}\\mapsto 6.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThe operator {{math|''D''}}, however, is not defined on individual numbers.  It is only defined on functions:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n D(x \\mapsto 1) &= (x \\mapsto 0),\\\\\n D(x \\mapsto x) &= (x \\mapsto 1),\\\\\n D(x \\mapsto x^2) &= (x \\mapsto 2\\cdot x).\n\\end{align}</math>\nBecause the output of {{math|''D''}} is a function, the output of {{math|''D''}} can be evaluated at a point.  For instance, when {{math|''D''}} is applied to the squaring function, {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}, {{math|''D''}} outputs the doubling function {{math|''x'' \u21a6 2''x''}}, which we named {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. This output function can then be evaluated to get {{math|''f''(1) {{=}} 2}}, {{math|''f''(2) {{=}} 4}}, and so on.\n\n==={{anchor|order of derivation}} Higher derivatives===\n\nLet {{math|''f''}} be a differentiable function, and let {{math|''f'' \u2032}} be its derivative. The derivative of {{math|''f'' \u2032}} (if it has one) is written {{math|''f'' \u2032\u2032}} and is called the ''[[second derivative]] of {{math|f}}''.  Similarly, the derivative of the second derivative, if it exists, is written {{math|''f'' \u2032\u2032\u2032}} and is called the ''[[third derivative]] of {{math|f}}''. Continuing this process, one can define, if it exists, the {{math|''n''}}th derivative as the derivative of the {{math|(''n''-1)}}th derivative. These repeated derivatives are called ''higher-order derivatives''. The {{math|''n''}}th derivative is also called the '''derivative of order {{math|''n''}}'''.\n\nIf {{math|''x''(''t'')}} represents the position of an object at time {{math|''t''}}, then the higher-order derivatives of {{math|''x''}} have physical interpretations.  The second derivative of {{math|''x''}} is the derivative of {{math|''x''\u2032}}, the velocity, and by definition this is the object's [[acceleration]]. The third derivative of {{math|''x''}} is defined to be the [[jerk (physics)|jerk]], and the fourth derivative is defined to be the [[jounce]].\n\nA function {{math|''f''}} need not have a derivative (for example, if it is not continuous).  Similarly, even if {{math|''f''}} does have a derivative, it may not have a second derivative.  For example, let\n:<math>f(x) = \\begin{cases} +x^2, & \\text{if }x\\ge 0 \\\\ -x^2, & \\text{if }x \\le 0.\\end{cases}</math>\nCalculation shows that {{math|''f''}} is a differentiable function whose derivative at <math>x</math> is given by\n:<math>f'(x) = \\begin{cases} +2x, & \\text{if }x\\ge 0 \\\\ -2x, & \\text{if }x \\le 0.\\end{cases}</math>\n{{math|''f'''(''x'')}} is twice the absolute value function at <math>x</math>, and it does not have a derivative at zero. Similar examples show that a function can have a {{math|''k''}}th derivative for each non-negative integer {{math|''k''}} but not a {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}th derivative.  A function that has {{math|''k''}} successive derivatives is called ''{{math|k}} times differentiable''.  If in addition the {{math|''k''}}th derivative is continuous, then the function is said to be of [[differentiability class]] {{math|''C<sup>k</sup>''}}.  (This is a stronger condition than having {{math|''k''}} derivatives, as shown by the second example of {{slink|Smoothness|Examples}}.)  A function that has infinitely many derivatives is called ''infinitely differentiable'' or ''[[smoothness|smooth]]''.\n\nOn the real line, every [[polynomial function]] is infinitely differentiable.  By standard [[differentiation rules]], if a polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} is differentiated {{math|''n''}} times, then it becomes a [[constant function]].  All of its subsequent derivatives are identically zero.  In particular, they exist, so polynomials are smooth functions.\n\nThe derivatives of a function {{math|''f''}} at a point {{math|''x''}} provide polynomial approximations to that function near {{math|''x''}}. For example, if {{math|''f''}} is twice differentiable, then\n:<math> f(x+h) \\approx f(x) + f'(x)h + \\tfrac{1}{2} f''(x) h^2</math>\nin the sense that\n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x) - f'(x)h - \\frac{1}{2} f''(x) h^2}{h^2}=0.</math>\nIf {{math|''f''}} is infinitely differentiable, then this is the beginning of the [[Taylor series]] for {{math|''f''}} evaluated at {{math|''x'' + ''h''}} around {{math|''x''}}.\n\n===Inflection point===\n{{Main|Inflection point}}\n\nA point where the second derivative of a function changes sign is called an ''inflection point''.<ref>{{harvnb|Apostol|1967|loc=\u00a74.18}}</ref> At an inflection point, the second derivative may be zero, as in the case of the inflection point {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} of the function given by <math>f(x) = x^3</math>, or it may fail to exist, as in the case of the inflection point {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} of the function given by <math>f(x) = x^\\frac{1}{3}</math>. At an inflection point, a function switches from being a [[convex function]] to being a [[concave function]] or vice versa.\n\n==Notation (details)==\n{{Main|Notation for differentiation}}\n\n===Leibniz's notation===\n{{Main|Leibniz's notation}}\n\nThe symbols <math>dx</math>, <math>dy</math>, and <math>\\frac{dy}{dx}</math> were introduced by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1675.<ref>Manuscript of November 11, 1675 (Cajori vol. 2, page 204)</ref> It is still commonly used when the equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} is viewed as a functional relationship between [[dependent and independent variables]]. Then the first derivative is denoted by\n\n: <math>\\frac{dy}{dx},\\quad\\frac{d f}{dx}, \\text{  or  }\\frac{d}{dx}f,</math>\n\nand was once thought of as an [[infinitesimal]] quotient.

These are abbreviations for multiple applications of the derivative operator.

It also makes the [[chain rule]] easier to remember:{{#tag:ref|In the formulation of calculus in terms of limits, the ''du'' symbol has been assigned various meanings by various authors.

In practice, once the derivatives of a few simple functions are known, the derivatives of other functions are more easily computed using ''rules'' for obtaining derivatives of more complicated functions from simpler ones.\n\n===Rules for basic functions===\nMost derivative computations eventually require taking the derivative of some common functions. The following incomplete list gives some of the most frequently used functions of a single real variable and their derivatives.\n\n* ''[[Power rule|Derivatives of powers]]'': if\n\n:<math> f(x) = x^r,</math>\n\nwhere ''r'' is any [[real number]], then\n\n:<math> f'(x) = rx^{r-1},</math>\n\nwherever this is defined.

A vector-valued function can be split up into its coordinate functions ''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t''), ''y''<sub>2</sub>(''t''), \u2026, ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t''), meaning that {{nowrap|1='''y'''(''t'') = (''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t''), ..., ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t''))}}.  This includes, for example, [[parametric curve]]s in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> or '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.  The coordinate functions are real valued functions, so the above definition of derivative applies to them.  The derivative of '''y'''(''t'') is defined to be the [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], called the [[Differential geometry of curves|tangent vector]], whose coordinates are the derivatives of the coordinate functions.  That is,\n:<math>\\mathbf{y}'(t) = (y'_1(t), \\ldots, y'_n(t)).</math>\n\nEquivalently,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{y}'(t)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{\\mathbf{y}(t+h) - \\mathbf{y}(t)}{h},</math>\n\nif the limit exists.  The subtraction in the numerator is the subtraction of vectors, not scalars.  If the derivative of '''y''' exists for every value of ''t'', then '''y'''\u2032 is another vector-valued function.\n\nIf '''e'''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, '''e'''<sub>''n''</sub> is the standard basis for '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, then '''y'''(''t'') can also be written as {{nowrap|''y''<sub>1</sub>(''t'')'''e'''<sub>1</sub> + \u2026 + ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t'')'''e'''<sub>''n''</sub>}}. If we assume that the derivative of a vector-valued function retains the [[linearity of differentiation|linearity]] property, then the derivative of '''y'''(''t'') must be\n:<math>y'_1(t)\\mathbf{e}_1 + \\cdots + y'_n(t)\\mathbf{e}_n</math>\nbecause each of the basis vectors is a constant.\n\nThis generalization is useful, for example, if '''y'''(''t'') is the position vector of a particle at time ''t''; then the derivative '''y'''&prime;(''t'') is the [[velocity]] vector of the particle at time ''t''.\n\n===Partial derivatives===\n{{Main|Partial derivative}}\n\nSuppose that ''f'' is a function that depends on more than one variable\u2014for instance,\n:<math>f(x,y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\n''f'' can be reinterpreted as a family of functions of one variable indexed by the other variables:\n:<math>f(x,y) = f_x(y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\nIn other words, every value of ''x'' chooses a function, denoted ''f<sub>x</sub>'', which is a function of one real number.{{#tag:ref|This can also be expressed as the operation known as [[currying]].|group=Note}} That is,\n:<math>x \\mapsto f_x,</math>\n:<math>f_x(y) = x^2 + xy + y^2.</math>\nOnce a value of ''x'' is chosen, say ''a'', then {{nowrap|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}} determines a function ''f<sub>a</sub>'' that sends ''y'' to {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ay + ''y''<sup>2</sup>}}:\n:<math>f_a(y) = a^2 + ay + y^2.</math>\nIn this expression, ''a'' is a ''constant'', not a ''variable'', so ''f<sub>a</sub>'' is a function of only one real variable.  Consequently, the definition of the derivative for a function of one variable applies:\n:<math>f_a'(y) = a + 2y.</math>\nThe above procedure can be performed for any choice of ''a''.  Assembling the derivatives together into a function gives a function that describes the variation of ''f'' in the ''y'' direction:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(x,y) = x + 2y.</math>\nThis is the partial derivative of ''f'' with respect to ''y''.  Here [[\u2202]] is a rounded ''d'' called the '''partial derivative symbol'''.  To distinguish it from the letter ''d'', \u2202 is sometimes pronounced \"der\", \"del\", or \"partial\" instead of \"dee\".\n\nIn general, the '''partial derivative''' of a function {{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} in the direction ''x<sub>i</sub>'' at the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) is defined to be:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a_1,\\ldots,a_n) = \\lim_{h \\to 0}\\frac{f(a_1,\\ldots,a_i+h,\\ldots,a_n) - f(a_1,\\ldots,a_i,\\ldots,a_n)}{h}.</math>\nIn the above difference quotient, all the variables except ''x<sub>i</sub>'' are held fixed.  That choice of fixed values determines a function of one variable\n:<math>f_{a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n}(x_i) = f(a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},x_i,a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n),</math>\nand, by definition,\n:<math>\\frac{df_{a_1,\\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_n}}{dx_i}(a_i) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}(a_1,\\ldots,a_n).</math>\nIn other words, the different choices of ''a'' index a family of one-variable functions just as in the example above.  This expression also shows that the computation of partial derivatives reduces to the computation of one-variable derivatives.\n\nAn important example of a function of several variables is the case of a [[scalar-valued function]] {{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} on a domain in Euclidean space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> (e.g., on '''R'''<sup>2</sup> or '''R'''<sup>3</sup>). In this case ''f'' has a partial derivative \u2202''f''/\u2202''x''<sub>''j''</sub> with respect to each variable ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>. At the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>), these partial derivatives define the vector\n:<math>\\nabla f(a_1, \\ldots, a_n) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n), \\ldots, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n}(a_1, \\ldots, a_n)\\right).</math>\nThis vector is called the '''[[gradient]]''' of ''f'' at ''a''.  If ''f'' is differentiable at every point in some domain, then the gradient is a vector-valued function \u2207''f'' that takes the point (''a''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) to the vector \u2207''f''(''a''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>).  Consequently, the gradient determines a [[vector field]].\n\n===Directional derivatives===\n{{Main|Directional derivative}}\n\nIf ''f'' is a real-valued function on '''R'''<sup>n</sup>, then the partial derivatives of ''f'' measure its variation in the direction of the coordinate axes.  For example, if ''f'' is a function of ''x'' and ''y'', then its partial derivatives measure the variation in ''f'' in the ''x'' direction and the ''y'' direction.  They do not, however, directly measure the variation of ''f'' in any other direction, such as along the diagonal line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''}}.  These are measured using directional derivatives.  Choose a vector\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} = (v_1,\\ldots,v_n).</math>\nThe '''directional derivative''' of ''f'' in the direction of '''v''' at the point '''x''' is the limit\n:<math>D_{\\mathbf{v}}{f}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0}{\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + h\\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{h}}.</math>\nIn some cases it may be easier to compute or estimate the directional derivative after changing the length of the vector.  Often this is done to turn the problem into the computation of a directional derivative in the direction of a unit vector.  To see how this works, suppose that {{nowrap|1='''v''' = ''\u03bb'''''u'''}}.  Substitute {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''k''/''\u03bb''}} into the difference quotient.  The difference quotient becomes:\n:<math>\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + (k/\\lambda)(\\lambda\\mathbf{u})) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{k/\\lambda}\n= \\lambda\\cdot\\frac{f(\\mathbf{x} + k\\mathbf{u}) - f(\\mathbf{x})}{k}.</math>\nThis is ''\u03bb'' times the difference quotient for the directional derivative of ''f'' with respect to '''u'''. Furthermore, taking the limit as ''h'' tends to zero is the same as taking the limit as ''k'' tends to zero because ''h'' and ''k'' are multiples of each other.  Therefore, {{nowrap|1=''D''<sub>'''v'''</sub>(''f'') = \u03bb''D''<sub>'''u'''</sub>(''f'')}}.  Because of this rescaling property, directional derivatives are frequently considered only for unit vectors.\n\nIf all the partial derivatives of ''f'' exist and are continuous at '''x''', then they determine the directional derivative of ''f'' in the direction '''v''' by the formula:\n:<math>D_{\\mathbf{v}}{f}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\sum_{j=1}^n v_j \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_j}.</math>\nThis is a consequence of the definition of the [[total derivative]].  It follows that the directional derivative is [[linear map|linear]] in '''v''', meaning that {{nowrap|1=''D''<sub>'''v''' + '''w'''</sub>(''f'') = ''D''<sub>'''v'''</sub>(''f'') + ''D''<sub>'''w'''</sub>(''f'')}}.\n\nThe same definition also works when ''f'' is a function with values in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>. The above definition is applied to each component of the vectors.  In this case, the directional derivative is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>.\n\n===Total derivative, total differential and Jacobian matrix===\n{{Main|Total derivative}}\n\nWhen ''f'' is a function from an open subset of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, then the directional derivative of ''f'' in a chosen direction is the best linear approximation to ''f'' at that point and in that direction.  But when {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 1}}, no single directional derivative can give a complete picture of the behavior of ''f''. The total derivative gives a complete picture by considering all directions at once.  That is, for any vector '''v''' starting at '''a''', the linear approximation formula holds:\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) \\approx f(\\mathbf{a}) + f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v}.</math>\nJust like the single-variable derivative, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;&prime;('''a''')}} is chosen so that the error in this approximation is as small as possible.\n\nIf ''n'' and ''m'' are both one, then the derivative {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')}} is a number and the expression {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')''v''}} is the product of two numbers. But in higher dimensions, it is impossible for {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} to be a number. If it were a number, then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} would be a vector in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> while the other terms would be vectors in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and therefore the formula would not make sense. For the linear approximation formula to make sense, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} must be a function that sends vectors in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to vectors in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} must denote this function evaluated at '''v'''.\n\nTo determine what kind of function it is, notice that the linear approximation formula can be rewritten as\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a}) \\approx f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v}.</math>\nNotice that if we choose another vector '''w''', then this approximate equation determines another approximate equation by substituting '''w''' for '''v'''. It determines a third approximate equation by substituting both '''w''' for '''v''' and {{nowrap|'''a''' + '''v'''}} for '''a'''. By subtracting these two new equations, we get\n:<math>f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) + f(\\mathbf{a})\n\\approx f'(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v})\\mathbf{w} - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{w}.</math>\nIf we assume that '''v''' is small and that the derivative varies continuously in '''a''', then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''' + '''v''')}} is approximately equal to {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}}, and therefore the right-hand side is approximately zero. The left-hand side can be rewritten in a different way using the linear approximation formula with {{nowrap|'''v''' + '''w'''}} substituted for '''v'''. The linear approximation formula implies:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n0\n&\\approx f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) + f(\\mathbf{a}) \\\\\n&= (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) - (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) - (f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{w}) - f(\\mathbf{a})) \\\\\n&\\approx f'(\\mathbf{a})(\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{v} - f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{w}.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThis suggests that {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is a [[linear transformation]] from the vector space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to the vector space '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>. In fact, it is possible to make this a precise derivation by measuring the error in the approximations.  Assume that the error in these linear approximation formula is bounded by a constant times ||'''v'''||, where the constant is independent of '''v''' but depends continuously on '''a'''. Then, after adding an appropriate error term, all of the above approximate equalities can be rephrased as inequalities.  In particular, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is a linear transformation up to a small error term.  In the limit as '''v''' and '''w''' tend to zero, it must therefore be a linear transformation. Since we define the total derivative by taking a limit as '''v''' goes to zero, {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} must be a linear transformation.\n\nIn one variable, the fact that the derivative is the best linear approximation is expressed by the fact that it is the limit of difference quotients.  However, the usual difference quotient does not make sense in higher dimensions because it is not usually possible to divide vectors. In particular, the numerator and denominator of the difference quotient are not even in the same vector space: The numerator lies in the codomain '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> while the denominator lies in the domain '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. Furthermore, the derivative is a linear transformation, a different type of object from both the numerator and denominator.  To make precise the idea that {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')}} is the best linear approximation, it is necessary to adapt a different formula for the one-variable derivative in which these problems disappear. If {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}}, then the usual definition of the derivative may be manipulated to show that the derivative of ''f'' at ''a'' is the unique number {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')}} such that\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - (f(a) + f'(a)h)}{h} = 0.</math>\nThis is equivalent to\n:<math>\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{|f(a + h) - (f(a) + f'(a)h)|}{|h|} = 0</math>\nbecause the limit of a function tends to zero if and only if the limit of the absolute value of the function tends to zero.  This last formula can be adapted to the many-variable situation by replacing the absolute values with [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s.\n\nThe definition of the '''total derivative''' of ''f'' at '''a''', therefore, is that it is the unique linear transformation {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''') : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} such that\n:<math>\\lim_{\\mathbf{h}\\to 0} \\frac{\\lVert f(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{h}) - (f(\\mathbf{a}) + f'(\\mathbf{a})\\mathbf{h})\\rVert}{\\lVert\\mathbf{h}\\rVert} = 0.</math>\nHere '''h''' is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, so the norm in the denominator is the standard length on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.  However, ''f''\u2032('''a''')'''h''' is a vector in '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, and the norm in the numerator is the standard length on '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>.  If ''v'' is a vector starting at ''a'', then {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} is called the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] of '''v''' by ''f'' and is sometimes written {{nowrap|''f''<sub>\u2217</sub>'''v'''}}.\n\nIf the total derivative exists at '''a''', then all the partial derivatives and directional derivatives of ''f'' exist at '''a''', and for all '''v''', {{nowrap|''f''&thinsp;\u2032('''a''')'''v'''}} is the directional derivative of ''f'' in the direction '''v'''.  If we write ''f'' using coordinate functions, so that {{nowrap|1=''f'' = (''f''<sub>1</sub>, ''f''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>''m''</sub>)}}, then the total derivative can be expressed using the partial derivatives as a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].  This matrix is called the '''[[Jacobian matrix]]''' of ''f'' at '''a''':\n\n:<math>f'(\\mathbf{a}) = \\operatorname{Jac}_{\\mathbf{a}} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}\\right)_{ij}.</math>\n\nThe existence of the total derivative ''f''\u2032('''a''') is strictly stronger than the existence of all the partial derivatives, but if the partial derivatives exist and are continuous, then the total derivative exists, is given by the Jacobian, and depends continuously on '''a'''.\n\nThe definition of the total derivative subsumes the definition of the derivative in one variable.  That is, if ''f'' is a real-valued function of a real variable, then the total derivative exists if and only if the usual derivative exists.  The Jacobian matrix reduces to a 1\u00d71 matrix whose only entry is the derivative ''f''&prime;(''x'').  This 1\u00d71 matrix satisfies the property that {{nowrap|''f''(''a'' + ''h'') \u2212 (''f''(''a'') + ''f''&thinsp;\u2032(''a'')''h'')}} is approximately zero, in other words that\n\n:<math>f(a+h) \\approx f(a) + f'(a)h.</math>\n\nUp to changing variables, this is the statement that the function <math>x \\mapsto f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)</math> is the best linear approximation to ''f'' at ''a''.\n\nThe total derivative of a function does not give another function in the same way as the one-variable case.  This is because the total derivative of a multivariable function has to record much more information than the derivative of a single-variable function.  Instead, the total derivative gives a function from the [[tangent bundle]] of the source to the tangent bundle of the target.\n\nThe natural analog of second, third, and higher-order total derivatives is not a linear transformation, is not a function on the tangent bundle, and is not built by repeatedly taking the total derivative. The analog of a higher-order derivative, called a [[jet (mathematics)|jet]], cannot be a linear transformation because higher-order derivatives reflect subtle geometric information, such as concavity, which cannot be described in terms of linear data such as vectors.  It cannot be a function on the tangent bundle because the tangent bundle only has room for the base space and the directional derivatives. Because jets capture higher-order information, they take as arguments additional coordinates representing higher-order changes in direction. The space determined by these additional coordinates is called the [[jet bundle]].  The relation between the total derivative and the partial derivatives of a function is paralleled in the relation between the ''k''th order jet of a function and its partial derivatives of order less than or equal to ''k''.\n\nBy repeatedly taking the total derivative, one obtains higher versions of the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]], specialized to '''R'''<sup>''p''</sup>. The ''k''th order total derivative may be interpreted as a map\n:<math>D^k f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to L^k(\\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathbb{R}^n, \\mathbb{R}^m)</math>\nwhich takes a point '''x''' in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> and assigns to it an element of the space of ''k''-linear maps from '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> to '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> \u2013 the \"best\" (in a certain precise sense) ''k''-linear approximation to ''f'' at that point. By precomposing it with the [[Diagonal functor|diagonal map]] \u0394, {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2192 ('''x''', '''x''')}}, a generalized Taylor series may be begun as\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n f(\\mathbf{x}) & \\approx f(\\mathbf{a}) + (D f)(\\mathbf{x-a}) + (D^2 f)(\\Delta(\\mathbf{x-a})) + \\cdots\\\\\n & = f(\\mathbf{a}) + (D f)(\\mathbf{x - a}) + (D^2 f)(\\mathbf{x - a}, \\mathbf{x - a})+ \\cdots\\\\\n & = f(\\mathbf{a}) + \\sum_i (D f)_i (x_i-a_i) + \\sum_{j, k} (D^2 f)_{j k} (x_j-a_j) (x_k-a_k) + \\cdots\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere f('''a''') is identified with a constant function, {{nowrap|''x''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2212 ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are the components of the vector {{nowrap|'''x''' \u2212 '''a'''}}, and {{nowrap|(''Df'')<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{nowrap|(''D''<sup>2</sup>''f'')<sub>''jk''</sub>}} are the components of {{nowrap|''Df''}} and {{nowrap|''D''<sup>2</sup>''f''}} as linear transformations.\n\n==Generalizations==\n{{Main|Derivative (generalizations)}}\n\nThe concept of a derivative can be extended to many other settings. The common thread is that the derivative of a function at a point serves as a [[linear approximation]] of the function at that point.\n* An important generalization of the derivative concerns [[complex function]]s of [[Complex number|complex variable]]s, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers '''C''' to '''C'''. The notion of the derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If '''C''' is identified with '''R'''<sup>2</sup> by writing a complex number ''z'' as {{nowrap|''x'' + ''iy''}}, then a differentiable function from '''C''' to '''C''' is certainly differentiable as a function from '''R'''<sup>2</sup> to '''R'''<sup>2</sup> (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is ''complex linear'' and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]] \u2013 see [[holomorphic function]]s.\n* Another generalization concerns functions between [[smooth manifold|differentiable or smooth manifolds]]. Intuitively speaking such a manifold ''M'' is a space that can be approximated near each point ''x'' by a vector space called its [[tangent space]]: the prototypical example is a [[smooth surface]] in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. The derivative (or differential) of a (differentiable) map {{nowrap|''f'': ''M'' \u2192 ''N''}} between manifolds, at a point ''x'' in ''M'', is then a [[linear map]] from the tangent space of ''M'' at ''x'' to the tangent space of ''N'' at ''f''(''x''). The derivative function becomes a map between the [[tangent bundle]]s of ''M'' and ''N''. This definition is fundamental in [[differential geometry]] and has many uses \u2013 see [[pushforward (differential)]] and [[pullback (differential geometry)]].\n* Differentiation can also be defined for maps between [[Dimension (vector space)|infinite dimensional]] [[vector space]]s such as [[Banach space]]s and [[Fr\u00e9chet space]]s.  There is a generalization both of the directional derivative, called the [[G\u00e2teaux derivative]], and of the differential, called the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative]].\n* One deficiency of the classical derivative is that not very many functions are differentiable. Nevertheless, there is a way of extending the notion of the derivative so that all [[continuous function|continuous]] functions and many other functions can be differentiated using a concept known as the [[weak derivative]]. The idea is to embed the continuous functions in a larger space called the space of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] and only require that a function is differentiable \"on average\".\n* The properties of the derivative have inspired the introduction and study of many similar objects in algebra and topology \u2014 see, for example, [[differential algebra]].\n* The discrete equivalent of differentiation is [[finite difference]]s. The study of differential calculus is unified with the calculus of finite differences in [[time scale calculus]].\n* Also see [[arithmetic derivative]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of calculus}}\n[[Calculus]], known in its early history as ''infinitesimal calculus'', is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] discipline focused on [[limit (mathematics)|limits]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], [[derivative]]s, [[integral]]s, and [[infinite series]]. [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] independently discovered calculus in the mid-17th century. However, each inventor claimed the other stole his work in a [[Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy|bitter dispute]] that continued until the end of their lives.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Differential calculus#Applications of derivatives|Applications of derivatives]]\n* [[Automatic differentiation]]\n* [[Differentiability class]]\n* [[Differentiation rules]]\n* [[Differintegral]]\n* [[Fractal derivative]]\n* [[Generalizations of the derivative]]\n* [[Hasse derivative]]\n* [[History of calculus]]\n* [[Integral]]\n* [[Infinitesimal]]\n* [[Linearization]]\n* [[Mathematical analysis]]\n* [[Multiplicative inverse]]\n* [[Multiplicative calculus#History|Non-Newtonian calculus]]\n* [[Numerical differentiation]]\n* [[Rate (mathematics)]]\n* [[Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem]]\n* [[Symmetric derivative]]\n* [[Schwarzian derivative]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Print===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Anton\n | first = Howard\n | last2 = Bivens\n | first2 = Irl\n | last3 = Davis\n | first3 = Stephen\n | date = February 2, 2005\n | title = Calculus: Early Transcendentals Single and Multivariable\n | place = New York\n | publisher = Wiley\n | edition = 8th\n | isbn  = 978-0-471-47244-5\n}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Apostol\n | first = Tom M.\n | author-link = Tom M.

The author doesn't consider the \"Kar\u1e47\u1e47\u0101\u1e6da\" (Kannada) and the \"Andhra\" (Telugu) languages as \"Drami\u1e0da\", because they were very different from the language of the \"Tamil Veda\" (''[[Tiruvaymoli]]''), but states that some people would include them in the \"Drami\u1e0da\" category.{{sfn|Shulman|2016|p=6}}\n\nIn 1816, Alexander D.

Caldwell coined the term \"Dravidian\" for this family of languages, based on the usage of the [[Sanskrit]] word \u0926\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0926\u093e (Dravid\u0101) in the work ''Tantrav\u0101rttika'' by {{IAST|[[Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da]]}}.{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990|p=xx}} In his own words, Caldwell says,\n\n{{quote|The word I have chosen is 'Dravidian', from {{IAST|Dr\u0101vi\u1e0da}}, the adjectival form of {{IAST|Dravi\u1e0da}}. This term, it is true, has sometimes been used, and is still sometimes used, in almost as restricted a sense as that of Tamil itself, so that though on the whole it is the best term I can find, I admit it is not perfectly free from ambiguity. It is a term which has already been used more or less distinctively by Sanskrit philologists, as a generic appellation for the South Indian people and their languages, and it is the only single term they ever seem to have used in this manner. I have, therefore, no doubt of the propriety of adopting it.{{sfnp|Caldwell|1856|p=4}}}} The 1961 publication of the ''[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/burrow/ Dravidian etymological dictionary]'' by [[T.

Basically the theories deal with the direction of derivation between ''{{IAST|tami\u1e93}}'' and ''{{IAST|dr\u0101vi\u1e0da}}''.

[[Kamil Zvelebil]] cites the forms such as ''dramila'' (in {{IAST|Da\u1e47\u1e0din}}'s Sanskrit work ''Avanisundar\u012bkath\u0101'') ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}'' (found in the Sri Lankan (Ceylonese) chronicle ''[[Mahavamsa]]'') and then goes on to say, \"The forms ''dami\u1e37a''/''damila'' almost certainly provide a connection of ''{{IAST|dr(a/\u0101)vi\u1e0da}}'' \" and \"... ''{{IAST|tami\u1e37}}'' < ''{{IAST|tami\u1e93}}'' ...whereby the further development might have been *''{{IAST|tami\u1e93}}'' > *''{{IAST|dami\u1e37}}'' > ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}''- / ''damila''- and further, with the intrusive, 'hypercorrect' (or perhaps analogical) -''r''-, into ''{{IAST|dr(a/\u0101)vi\u1e0da}}''. The -''m''-/-''v''- alternation is a common enough phenomenon in Dravidian phonology\"{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990|p=xxi}}\nZvelebil in his earlier treatise states, \"It is obvious that the Sanskrit ''{{IAST|dr(a/\u0101)vi\u1e0da}}'', Pali ''damila'', ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37o}}'' and Prakrit ''{{IAST|d(a/\u0101)vi\u1e0da}}'' are all etymologically connected with ''{{IAST|tami\u1e93}}''\", and further remarks, \"The ''r'' in ''{{IAST|tami\u1e93}}'' \u2192 ''{{IAST|dr(a/\u0101)vi\u1e0da}}'' is a hypercorrect insertion, cf. an analogical case of DED 1033 Ta. ''kamuku'', Tu. ''kangu'' \"areca nut\": Skt. ''kramu(ka)''.\"{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1975|p=53}}\n\nFurthermore, another Dravidianist and linguist, [[Bhadriraju Krishnamurti]], in his book ''Dravidian Languages'' states:{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|loc=p. 2, footnote 2}} {{quote|Joseph (1989: IJDL 18.2:134-42) gives extensive references to the use of the term ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}'', ''dramila'' first as the name of a people, then of a country. Sinhala BCE inscriptions cite ''{{IAST|dame\u1e0da}}''-, ''damela''- denoting Tamil merchants. Early Buddhist and Jaina sources used ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}''- to refer to a people of south India (presumably Tamil); ''{{IAST|damilara\u1e6d\u1e6dha}}''- was a southern non-Aryan country; ''{{IAST|drami\u1e37a}}''-, ''{{IAST|drami\u1e0da}}'', and ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}''- were used as variants to designate a country in the south (''{{IAST|B\u1e5bhatsamhita-}}'', ''K\u0101dambar\u012b'', ''Da\u015bakum\u0101racarita-'', fourth to seventh centuries CE) (1989: 134\u2013138). It appears that ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}''- was older than ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}''- which could be its Sanskritization.}}\n\nBased on what Krishnamurti states (referring to a scholarly paper published in the ''International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics''), the Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}'' itself is later than ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}'' since the dates for the forms with -r- are centuries later than the dates for the forms without -r- (''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}'', ''{{IAST|dame\u1e0da}}''-, ''damela''- etc.). The ''Monier-Williams Sanskrit Dictionary'' lists for the Sanskrit word ''dravi\u1e0da'' a meaning of \"collective Name for 5 peoples, viz. the \u0100ndhras, Kar\u1e47\u0101\u1e6dakas, Gurjaras, Taila\u1e45gas, and Mah\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dras\".<ref>[http://webapps.uni-koeln.de/tamil/ Sanskrit, Tamil and Pahlavi Dictionaries<!--Bot-generated title-->]\n</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nThe Dravidian languages form a close-knit family. Most scholars agree on four groups: South (or South Dravidian{{nbsp}}I), South-Central (or South Dravidian{{nbsp}}II), Central, and North Dravidian, but there are different proposals regarding the relationship between these groups.

These include the [[gerund]], which has the same function as in Dravidian, and the [[quotative]] marker ''iti''.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|pp=36\u201337}} Some linguists explain this asymmetrical borrowing by arguing that Middle Indo-Aryan languages were built on a Dravidian [[substratum]].{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|pp=40\u201341}} These scholars argue that the most plausible explanation for the presence of Dravidian structural features in Indic is [[language shift]], that is, native Dravidian speakers learning and adopting Indic languages.{{sfnp|Erdosy|1995|p=18}} Although each of the innovative traits in Indic could be accounted for by internal explanations, early Dravidian influence is the only explanation that can account for all of the innovations at once; moreover, it accounts for several of the innovative traits in Indic better than any internal explanation that has been proposed.{{sfnp|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|pp=141\u2013144}}\n\n==Grammar==\nThe most characteristic grammatical features of Dravidian languages are:<ref name=\"britannicaDVD\"/>\n* Dravidian languages are [[Agglutination|agglutinative]].\n* Word order is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] (SOV).\n* Most Dravidian languages have a [[clusivity]] distinction (notably, [[Kannada]] does not).\n* The major word classes are nouns (substantives, numerals, pronouns), adjectives, verbs, and indeclinables (particles, enclitics, adverbs, interjections, onomatopoetic words, echo words).\n* Proto-Dravidian used only suffixes, never prefixes or infixes, in the construction of inflected forms. Hence, the roots of words always occurred at the beginning. Nouns, verbs, and indeclinable words constituted the original word classes.\n* There are two numbers and four different gender systems, the ancestral system probably having \"male:non-male\" in the singular and \"person:non-person\" in the plural.\n* In a sentence, however complex, only one finite verb occurs, normally at the end, preceded if necessary by a number of gerunds.\n* Word order follows certain basic rules but is relatively free.\n* The main (and probably original) dichotomy in tense is past:non-past. Present tense developed later and independently in each language or subgroup.\n* Verbs are intransitive, transitive, and causative; there are also active and passive forms.\n* All of the positive verb forms have their corresponding negative counterparts, [[negative verbs]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nDravidian languages are noted for the lack of distinction between aspirated and unaspirated stops. While some Dravidian languages have accepted large numbers of loan words from [[Sanskrit]] and other [[Indo-Iranian languages]] in addition to their already vast vocabulary, in which the [[orthography]] shows distinctions in voice and [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], the words are pronounced in Dravidian according to different rules of [[phonology]] and [[phonotactics]]: aspiration of [[plosives]] is generally absent, regardless of the spelling of the word. This is not a universal phenomenon and is generally avoided in formal or careful speech, especially when reciting. For instance, [[Tamil language|Tamil]] does not distinguish between voiced and voiceless stops. In fact, the [[Tamil alphabet]] lacks symbols for voiced and aspirated stops. Dravidian languages are also characterized by a three-way distinction between [[Dental consonant|dental]], [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], and [[retroflex]] places of articulation as well as large numbers of [[Liquid consonant|liquids]].\n\n===Proto-Dravidian===\n{{main|Proto-Dravidian}}\nProto-Dravidian had five short and long vowels: ''*a'', ''*\u0101'', ''*i'', ''*\u012b'', ''*u'', ''*\u016b'', ''*e'', ''*\u0113'', ''*o'', ''*\u014d''.

It introduced the character of [[Count Dracula]], and established many conventions of subsequent [[vampire]] fantasy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bramstoker.org/novels.html|title=Bram Stoker - Novels|website=Bramstoker.org|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref> The novel tells the story of Dracula's attempt to move from [[Transylvania]] to England so that he may find new blood and spread the undead curse, and of the battle between Dracula and a small group of men and a woman led by Professor [[Abraham Van Helsing]].\n\n''Dracula'' has been assigned to many [[literary genre]]s including [[vampire literature]], [[horror fiction]], the [[gothic fiction|gothic novel]], and [[invasion literature]]. The novel has spawned numerous theatrical, film, and television interpretations.\n==Plot==\n[[File:Stoker Dracula Notes Personal.jpg|thumb|upright|Stoker's handwritten notes on the characters in the novel]]\n\nThe story is told in an [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]] format, as a series of letters, [[diary]] entries, newspaper articles, and ships' log entries, whose narrators are the novel's protagonists, and occasionally supplemented with newspaper clippings relating events not directly witnessed. The events portrayed in the novel take place chronologically and largely in England and [[Transylvania]] during the 1890s and all transpire within the same year between 3 May and 6 November. A short note is located at the end of the final chapter written 7 years after the events outlined in the novel.\n\nThe tale begins with [[Jonathan Harker]], a newly qualified English [[solicitor]], visiting Count Dracula at [[Castle Dracula|his castle]] in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] on the border of [[Transylvania]], [[Bukovina]], and [[Moldavia]], to provide legal support for a [[real estate]] transaction overseen by Harker's employer, Mr Peter Hawkins of [[Exeter]]. At first enticed by Dracula's gracious manners, Harker soon realizes that he is Dracula's prisoner. Wandering the Count's castle against Dracula's admonition, Harker encounters three female vampires, called \"[[Brides of Dracula|the sisters]]\", from whom he is rescued by Dracula. Harker soon realizes that Dracula himself is also a vampire. After the preparations are made, Dracula leaves Transylvania and abandons Harker to the sisters. Harker barely escapes from the castle with his life.\n\nDracula boards a Russian ship, the ''Demeter'', taking along with him boxes of Transylvanian soil, which he required in order to regain his strength. Not long afterward, the ship having weighed anchor at [[Varna]], runs aground on the shores of [[Whitby]] in the east coast of England. The captain's [[Logbook|log]] narrates the gradual disappearance of the entire crew, until the captain alone remained, himself bound to the helm to maintain course. An animal resembling \"a large dog\" is seen leaping ashore. The ship's cargo is described as silver sand and 50 boxes of \"mould\", or earth, from Transylvania. It is later learned that Dracula successfully purchased multiple estates under the alias 'Count De Ville' throughout London and devised to distribute the 50 boxes to each of them utilizing transportation services as well as moving them himself. He does this to secure for himself \"lairs\" and the 50 boxes of earth would be used as his graves which would grant safety and rest during times of feeding and replenishing his strength.\n\nHarker's fianc\u00e9e, [[Mina Murray]], is staying with her friend [[Lucy Westenra]], who is holidaying in [[Whitby]]. Lucy receives three marriage proposals from [[John Seward|Dr. John Seward]], [[Quincey Morris]], and [[Arthur Holmwood]] (the son of Lord Godalming who later obtains the title himself<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stoker|first1=Bram|title=Dracula|location=Chapter 6, Mina Murray's Journal, 26 July|page=105|url=http://www.planetebook.com/ebooks/Dracula.pdf|quote=Mr. Holmwood, he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only son of Lord Godalming}}</ref>). Lucy accepts Holmwood's proposal while turning down Seward and Morris, but all remain friends. Dracula communicates with Seward's patient, [[Renfield]], an insane man who wishes to consume insects, spiders, birds, and rats to absorb their \"life force\". Renfield is able to detect Dracula's presence and supplies clues accordingly.\n\nSoon Dracula is indirectly shown to be stalking Lucy. As time passes she begins to suffer from episodes of sleepwalking and dementia, as witnessed by Mina. When Lucy begins to waste away suspiciously, Seward invites his old teacher, [[Abraham Van Helsing]], who immediately determines the true cause of Lucy's condition. He refuses to disclose it but diagnoses her with acute blood-loss. Van Helsing prescribes numerous [[blood transfusion]]s to which he, Seward, Quincey, and Arthur all contribute over time. Van Helsing also prescribes garlic flowers to be placed throughout her room and weaves a necklace of withered [[Allium|garlic blossoms]] for her to wear. However she continues to waste away \u2013 appearing to lose blood every night. While both doctors are absent, Lucy and her mother are attacked by a [[wolf]] and Mrs. Westenra, who has a heart condition, dies of fright. Van Helsing attempts to protect her with [[Garlic#Spiritual and religious uses|garlic]] but fate thwarts him each night, whether Lucy's mother removes the garlic from her room, or Lucy herself does so in her restless sleep. The doctors have found two small puncture marks about her neck, which Dr. Seward is at a loss to understand. After Lucy dies, Van Helsing places a golden crucifix over her mouth, ostensibly to delay or prevent Lucy's vampiric conversion.  Fate conspires against him again when Van Helsing finds the crucifix in the possession of one of the servants who stole it off Lucy's corpse.\n\nFollowing Lucy's death and burial, the newspapers report children being stalked in the night by a \"bloofer lady\" (i.e., \"beautiful lady\").<ref>[[Leonard Wolf]] (2004). ''The Essential Dracula'', Chapter 13, Note 31. \"Bloofer lady\" is explained as baby-talk for \"beautiful lady\".</ref> Van Helsing, knowing Lucy has become a vampire, confides in Seward, Lord Godalming, and Morris. The suitors and Van Helsing track her down and, after a confrontation with her, stake her heart, [[Decapitation|behead]] her, and fill her mouth with garlic. Around the same time, Jonathan Harker arrives from [[Budapest]], where Mina marries him after his escape, and he and Mina join the campaign against Dracula.\n\nThe vampire hunters stay at Dr. Seward's residence, holding nightly meetings and providing reports based on each of their various tasks. Mina discovers that each of their journals and letters collectively contain clues to which they can track him down. She tasks herself with collecting them, researching newspaper clippings, fitting the most relevant entries into chronological order and typing out copies to distribute to each of the party which they are to study. Jonathan Harker tracks down the shipments of boxed graves and the estates which Dracula has purchased in order to store them. Van Helsing conducts research along with Dr. Seward to analyze the behaviour of their patient Renfield who they learn is directly influenced by Dracula. They also research historical events, folklore, and superstitions from various cultures to understand Dracula's powers and weaknesses. Van Helsing also establishes a criminal profile on Dracula in order to better understand his actions and predict his movements. Arthur Holmwood's fortune assists in funding the entire operation and expenses. As they discover the various properties Dracula had purchased, the male protagonists team up to raid each property and are several times confronted by Dracula. As they discover each of the boxed graves scattered throughout London, they pry them open to place and seal wafers of [[sacramental bread]] within. This act renders the boxes of earth completely useless to Dracula as he is unable to open, enter or further transport them.\n\nAfter Dracula learns of the group's plot against him, he attacks Mina on three occasions, and feeds Mina his own blood to control her. This curses Mina with vampirism and changes her but does not completely turn her into a vampire. Van Helsing attempts to bless Mina through prayer and by placing a wafer of sacrament against her forehead, but it burns her upon contact leaving a wretched scar. Under this curse, Mina oscillates from consciousness to a semi-trance during which she perceives Dracula's surroundings and actions. Van Helsing is able to use hypnotism twice a day, at dawn and at sunset, to put her into this trance to further track Dracula's movements. Mina, afraid of Dracula's link with her, urges the team not to tell her their plans out of fear that Dracula will be listening. After the protagonists discover and sterilize 49 boxes found throughout his lairs in London, they learn that Dracula has fled with the missing 50th box back to his castle in Transylvania. They pursue him under the guidance of Mina. They split up into teams once they reach Europe; Van Helsing and Mina team up to locate the castle of Dracula while the others attempt to ambush the boat Dracula is using to reach his home. Van Helsing raids the castle and destroys the vampire \"sisters\". Upon discovering Dracula being transported by [[Romani people|Gypsies]], the three teams converge and attack the caravan carrying Dracula in the 50th box of Earth. After dispatching many Gypsies who were sworn to protect the Count, Harker shears Dracula through the throat with a [[Kukri|kukri knife]], while the mortally wounded Quincey stabs the Count in the heart with a [[Bowie knife]]. Dracula crumbles to dust, and Mina is freed from her curse of vampirism, as the scar on her forehead disappears. Soon after, Quincey dies from his wounds.\n\nThe book closes with a note left by Jonathan Harker seven years after the events of the novel, detailing his married life with Mina and the birth of their son, whom they name after all four members of the party, but address as \"Quincey\". Quincey is depicted sitting on the knee of Van Helsing as they recount their adventure.

Contrary to popular belief, the name Dracula does not translate to \"son of the devil\" in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], which would be \"fiul diavolului\".\n\nStoker came across the name Dracula in his reading on [[History of Romania|Romanian history]], and chose this to replace the name (''Count Wampyr'') originally intended for his villain.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Onion|first1=Rebecca|title=Bram Stoker's Ever-Evolving List of Characters for Dracula|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2013/04/23/bram_stoker_s_dracula_how_dracula_van_helsing_and_other_characters_came.html|website=Slate|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> Some Dracula scholars led by [[Elizabeth Miller (academic)|Elizabeth Miller]] argue that Stoker knew little of the historic Vlad III except for the name \"Dracula\" in addition to a few bits of Romanian history.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Stoker mentions that his Dracula fought against the Turks and was later betrayed by his brother, historical facts in the novel which point to Vlad III:\n\n{{quote|Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! (Chapter 3, pp. 19)}}\n\nThe Count's identity is later speculated on by Professor Van Helsing:\n\n{{quote|He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey-land. (Chapter 18, p. 145)}}\n\nMany of Stoker's biographers and literary critics have found strong similarities to the earlier Irish writer [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s classic of the vampire genre ''[[Carmilla]]''. In writing ''Dracula'', Stoker may also have drawn on stories about the [[Aos S\u00ed|s\u00eddhe]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} some of which feature blood-drinking women. The Irish legend of [[Abhartach]] has also been suggested as a source.<ref name=curran>{{cite journal | last = Curran | first = Bob | authorlink = | title = Was Dracula an Irishman? | journal = History Ireland | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = | publisher = | location = | date = Summer 2000 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}</ref>It is also thought probable that his mothers stories of events during the severe [[1832 Sligo cholera outbreak|cholera outbreak]] in [[Sligo]] in 1832 were influential.

''The Essential Dracula''. London: Bison Books, 1992 {{page needed|date=April 2017}}</ref> According to Miller, he first visited Cruden Bay in 1893, three years after work had begun on ''Dracula''. Haining and Tremaine maintain that, during this visit, Stoker was especially impressed by Slains Castle's interior and the surrounding landscape. Miller and Leatherdale question the stringency of this connection.<ref>Haining, Peter and Tremayne, Peter. The Un-Dead: The Legend of Bram Stoker and Dracila.

Westcliff-on-Sea, UK: Desert Island Books, 1998, p. 13</ref>\n\nPossibly, Stoker was not inspired by a real edifice at all, but by [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[The Carpathian Castle]]'' (1892) or [[Anne Radcliffe]]'s ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794).<ref>Elizabeth Miller, ''Dracula: Sense & Nonsense''. 2nd ed. Westcliff-on-Sea, UK: Desert Island Books, 2006, p. 141</ref> A third possibility is that he copied information about a castle at [[Br\u00e2ncovene\u0219ti, Mure\u0219|V\u00e9cs]] from one of his sources on Transylvania, the book by Major E.C.

London: Longmans, 1865. Referred to by Marius Cri\u0219an, ''The Models for Castle Dracula in Stoker's Sources on Transylvania'', Journal of Dracula Studies Nr 10 (2008). As indicated by Cri\u015fan, Crosse's book ''Round About the Carpathians'' and Mazuchelli's ''Magyarland'' describe T\u00f6rzburg as well.</ref>\n\nMany of the scenes in [[Whitby]] and London are based on real places that Stoker frequently visited, although he distorts the geography for the sake of the story in some cases.  One scholar has suggested that Stoker chose [[Whitby]] as the site of Dracula's first appearance in England because of the [[Synod of Whitby]], given the novel's preoccupation with timekeeping and calendar disputes.<ref name=\"Killing Time 2014\"/>\n\nDaniel Farson, Leonard Wolf, and Peter Haining have suggested that Stoker received much historical information from [[\u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] professor whom he met at least twice. Miller argues, \"there is nothing to indicate that the conversation included Vlad, vampires, or even Transylvania\", and \"furthermore, there is no record of any other correspondence between Stoker and V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry, nor is V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry mentioned in Stoker's notes for Dracula.\"<ref>Elizabeth Miller, [http://www.blooferland.com/drc/images/Divorce.rtf Filing for Divorce Count Dracula vs Vlad Tepes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708073221/http://www.blooferland.com/drc/images/Divorce.rtf |date=8 July 2011 }} Dracula: The Shade and the Shadow, ed.

It is [[Walpurgis Night]] and the young Englishman foolishly leaves his hotel, in spite of the coachman's warnings, and wanders through a dense forest alone. Along the way, he feels that he is being watched by a tall and thin stranger (possibly Count Dracula).\n\nThe short story climaxes in an old graveyard where the Englishman, caught in a blizzard, takes refuge in the marble tomb of \"Countess Dolingen of Gratz\". Within the tomb, he sees the Countess\u2014apparently asleep and healthy\u2014but before he can investigate further, a mysterious force throws him clear of the tomb. A lightning bolt then strikes the tomb, destroying it and incinerating the undead screaming countess. The Englishman then loses consciousness.  He awakens to find a \"gigantic\" wolf lying on his chest and licking at his throat; however, the wolf merely keeps him warm and protects him until help arrives.\n\nWhen the Englishman is finally taken back to his hotel, a telegram awaits him from his expectant host Dracula, with a warning about \"dangers from snow and wolves and night\".\n\n===''Dracula the Un-dead''===\n{{main|Dracula the Un-dead}}\nIn 2009, an official sequel was published, written by Bram Stoker's great grand-nephew [[Dacre Stoker]] and Ian Holt.\n\n===''Dracul''<!-- NOT a typo.

Stoker himself wrote the first theatrical adaptation, which was presented at the Lyceum Theatre on 18 May 1897 under the title ''Dracula, or The Undead'' shortly before the novel's publication and performed only once, in order to establish his own copyright for such adaptations.

Galeen transplanted the action of the story from 1890s England to 1830s Germany and reworked several characters, dropping some (such as Lucy and all three of her suitors), and renaming others (Dracula became [[Count Orlok|Orlok]], Jonathan Harker became Thomas Hutter, Mina became Ellen, and so on). This attempt failed to avoid a court case, however; Florence Stoker sued Prana Film, and all copies of the film were ordered to be destroyed. However, the company was bankrupt, and Stoker only recovered her legal fees in damages. Some copies survived and found their way into theatres. Eventually, Florence Stoker gave up the fight against public displays of the film.<ref name=\"StokerHolt2009\" /> Subsequent rereleases of the film have typically undone some of the changes, such as restoring the original character names (a practice also followed by [[Werner Herzog]] in his 1979 remake of Murnau's film ''[[Nosferatu the Vampyre]]'').{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nFlorence Stoker licensed the story to playwright [[Hamilton Deane]], whose [[Dracula (1924 play)|1924 stage play adaptation]] toured England for several years before settling down in London.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In 1927, American stage producer [[Horace Liveright]] hired [[John L. Balderston]] to revise Deane's script in advance of its American premiere. Balderston significantly compressed the story, most notably consolidating or removing several characters. The Deane play and its Balderston revisions introduced an expanded role and history for Renfield, who now replaced Jonathan Harker as Dracula's solicitor in the first part of the story; combined [[Mina Harker]] and [[Lucy Westenra]] into a single character (named Lucy); and omitted both [[Arthur Holmwood]] and [[Quincey Morris]] entirely. When the play premiered in New York, it was with [[Bela Lugosi]] in the title role, and with [[Edward van Sloan]] as [[Abraham Van Helsing]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} roles which both actors (as well as [[Herbert Bunston]] as [[John Seward|Dr. Seward]]) reprised for the English-language version of the 1931 [[Universal Studios]] [[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|film production]]. The 1931 film was one of the most commercially successful adaptations of the story to date; it and the Deane/Balderston play that preceded it set the standard for film and television adaptations of the story, with the alterations to the novel becoming standard for later adaptations for decades to come.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Universal Studios continued to feature the character of Dracula in many of their [[Universal monsters|horror films from the 1930s and 1940s]].\n\n[[File:Dracula 1958 c.jpg|thumb|right|[[Christopher Lee]] as the title character in ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (1958)]]\nIn 1958, British film company [[Hammer Film Productions]] followed the success of its ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' from the previous year with ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'', released in the US as ''Horror of Dracula'', directed by [[Terence Fisher]]. Fisher's production featured [[Christopher Lee]] as Dracula and [[Peter Cushing]] as Van Helsing.

Christopher Lee also took on the role of Dracula in ''[[Count Dracula (1970 film)|Count Dracula]]'', a 1970 Spanish-Italian-German coproduction notable for its adherence to the plot of the original novel. Playing the part of Renfield in that version was [[Klaus Kinski]], who later played Dracula himself in 1979's ''Nosferatu the Vampyre''.\n\nIn 1977, the [[BBC]] made ''[[Count Dracula (1977 film)|Count Dracula]]'', a 155-minute adaptation for television starring [[Louis Jourdan]]. Later film adaptations include [[John Badham]]'s 1979 ''[[Dracula (1979 film)|Dracula]]'', starring [[Frank Langella]] and inspired by the [[Dracula (1977 play)|1977 Broadway revival]] of the Deane/Hamilton play, and [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s 1992 ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'', starring [[Gary Oldman]]. The character of Count Dracula has remained popular over the years, and many films have used the character as a villain, while others have named him in their titles, including ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'' and ''[[The Brides of Dracula]]''. As of 2009, an estimated 217 films feature Dracula in a major role, a number second only to [[Sherlock Holmes]] (223 films).

Against philosophical [[rationalism|rationalists]], Hume held that passion rather than reason governs human behaviour. Hume argued against the existence of [[innatism|innate ideas]], positing that all human knowledge is founded solely in [[experience]]; Hume thus held that genuine knowledge must either be directly traceable to objects perceived in experience, or result from abstract reasoning about [[Relation of Ideas|relations between ideas]] which are derived from experience, calling the rest \"nothing but sophistry and illusion\",{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=166}} a [[dichotomy]] later given the name ''[[Hume's fork]]''.\n\nIn what is sometimes referred to as [[Hume's problem of induction]], he argued that [[inductive reasoning]] and belief in [[causality]] cannot be justified rationally; instead, our trust in causality and induction result from custom and mental habit, and are attributable only to the experience of \"[[constant conjunction]]\" of events.  This is because we can never actually perceive that one event causes another, but only that the two are always conjoined.  Accordingly, to draw any causal inferences from past experience it is necessary to presuppose that the future will resemble the past, a presupposition which cannot itself be grounded in prior experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9980.html|title=Berlin, I.; Hardy, H.,: The Roots of Romanticism (Second edition) (eBook and Paperback).|work=princeton.edu}}</ref>\n\nHume's opposition to the [[teleological argument]] for God's existence, the argument from design, is generally regarded as the most intellectually significant attempt to rebut the argument prior to [[Darwinism]].\n\nHume was also a [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalist]] who held that ethics are based on emotion or sentiment rather than abstract moral principle, famously proclaiming that [[Fact\u2013value distinction|\"Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions\"]]. Hume's moral theory has been seen as a unique attempt to synthesise the modern sentimentalist moral tradition to which Hume belonged, with the [[virtue ethics]] tradition of [[ancient philosophy]], with which Hume concurred in regarding traits of character, rather than [[deontological ethics|acts]] or their [[consequentialism|consequences]], as ultimately the proper objects of moral evaluation.<ref name=\"books.google.com.au\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Hume.html?id=2_FiLAAACAAJ|title=Hume|work=google.com.au}}</ref> Hume maintained an early commitment to naturalistic explanations of moral phenomena, and is usually taken to have first clearly expounded the [[is\u2013ought problem]], or the idea that a statement of fact alone can never give rise to a [[norm (philosophy)|normative]] conclusion of what ''ought'' to be done.<ref name=\"books.google.com.au\"/> Hume also denied that humans have an actual conception of the self, positing that we experience only  a [[bundle theory|bundle of sensations]], and that the self is nothing more than this bundle of causally-connected perceptions. Hume's [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] theory of [[free will]] takes [[determinism|causal determinism]] as fully compatible with human freedom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-freewill/|title=Hume on Free Will|work=stanford.edu}}</ref>\n\nHume influenced [[utilitarianism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Immanuel Kant]], the [[philosophy of science]], early [[analytic philosophy]], [[cognitive science]], [[theology]], and other movements and thinkers. Kant himself credited Hume as the spur to his philosophical thought who had awakened him from his \"dogmatic slumbers\".\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and education===\nHume was the second of two sons born to Joseph Home of [[Chirnside#Ninewells House|Ninewells]], an advocate, and his wife The Hon. Katherine (''n\u00e9e'' Falconer), daughter of Sir David Falconer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/humelife.html|title=David Hume, \"My Own Life\"|author=|date=|website=andromeda.rutgers.edu}}</ref> He was born on 26 April 1711 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]) in a tenement on the north side of the [[Lawnmarket]] in [[Edinburgh]].  Hume's father died when Hume was a child, just after his second birthday, and he was raised by his mother, who never remarried.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humesociety.org/about/HumeBiography.asp|title=David Hume Biography|work=humesociety.org}}</ref> He changed the spelling of his name in 1734, because of the fact that his surname ''Home,'' pronounced ''Hume,'' was not known in England. Throughout his life Hume, who never married, spent time occasionally at his family home at Ninewells in [[Berwickshire]], which had belonged to his family since the sixteenth century. His finances as a young man were very \"slender\". His family was not rich, and, as a younger son, he had little [[wikt:patrimony|patrimony]] to live on. He was therefore forced to make a living somehow.{{sfn|Hume|1778|p=3}}\n\nHume attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] at the unusually early age of 12 (possibly as young as 10) at a time when 14 was normal. At first, because of his family, he considered a career in [[Scots law|law]], but came to have, in his words, \"an insurmountable aversion to everything but the pursuits of Philosophy and general Learning; and while [my family] fanceyed I was poring over [[Johannes Voet|Voet]] and [[Arnold Vinnius|Vinnius]], [[Cicero]] and [[Virgil]] were the Authors which I was secretly devouring\".{{sfn|Hume|1778|p=3}} He had little respect for the professors of his time, telling a friend in 1735 that \"there is nothing to be learnt from a Professor, which is not to be met with in Books\".{{sfn|Mossner|1958|pp=30\u201333|ps=, quoted in {{harvtxt|Wright|2009|p=10}}}} Hume did not graduate.{{sfn|Harris|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=K2ygCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=Hume+did+not+graduate&source=bl&ots=sc4E8eb4Ij&sig=4SSQXHoO4QmiGKJuz-dyzgGSxxU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxp769u4vKAhUIhhoKHSs9BqcQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&q=Hume%20did%20not%20graduate&f=false p. 35]}}\n\nAged around 18, he made a philosophical discovery that opened up to him \"a new Scene of Thought\", which inspired him \"to throw up every other Pleasure or Business to apply entirely to it\".{{sfn|Hume|1993|p=346}} He did not recount what this scene was, and commentators have offered a variety of speculations.{{Sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=8\u20139}} One popular interpretation, prominent in contemporary Hume scholarship, is that the new \"scene of thought\" was Hume's realization that [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson's]] \"moral sense\" theory of morality could be applied to the understanding as well. Due to this inspiration, Hume set out to spend a minimum of 10 years reading and writing. He soon came to the verge of a [[mental breakdown]], suffering from what a doctor diagnosed as the \"Disease of the Learned\". Hume wrote that it started with a coldness, which he attributed to a \"Laziness of Temper\", that lasted about nine months. Later, some [[scurvy]] spots broke out on his fingers. This was what persuaded Hume's physician to make his diagnosis. Hume wrote that he \"went under a Course of Bitters and Anti-Hysteric Pills\", taken along with a pint of claret every day. Hume also decided to have a more active life to better continue his learning.{{sfn|Mossner|1950|p=193}} His health improved somewhat, but, in 1731, he was afflicted with a ravenous appetite and palpitations of the heart. After eating well for a time, he went from being \"tall, lean and raw-bon'd\" to being \"sturdy, robust [and] healthful-like\".{{sfn|Hume|2011|pp=13\u201315}} Indeed, Hume would become well known in his time for his \"corpulence\", and his fondness for good port and cheese.\n\n===Career===\nAt 25 years of age, Hume, although of noble ancestry, had no source of income and no learned profession. As was common at his time, he became a merchant's assistant, but he had to leave his native Scotland. He travelled via [[Bristol]] to [[La Fl\u00e8che]] in Anjou, France. There he had frequent discourse with the [[Jesuits]] of the [[College of La Fl\u00e8che]].{{sfn|Huxley|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=eH67vOxyjEYC&pg=PA7&dq=hume+travelling+tutorship&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eBOIVMH_K4nvUvflg-gG&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=hume%20travelling%20tutorship&f=false pp. 7\u20138]}}\n\nWhile Hume was derailed in his attempts to start a university career by protests over his \"[[atheism]]\" and bemoaned that his literary debut, ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', 'fell dead-born from the press',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://davidhume.org/texts/mol.html|title=Texts - My Own Life (1777)|work=davidhume.org}}</ref> he found literary success in his lifetime as an essayist, and a career as a librarian at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. His tenure there, and the access to research materials it provided, ultimately resulted in Hume's writing the massive six-volume ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]'', which became a bestseller and the standard history of England in its day. Hume described his \"love for literary fame\" as his \"ruling passion\"<ref name=\"davidhume.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.davidhume.org/texts/mol.html|title=Texts - My Own Life (1777)|work=davidhume.org}}</ref> and judged his two late works, the so-called \"first\" and \"second\" enquiries, ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'' and ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'', respectively, as his greatest literary and philosophical achievements,<ref name=\"davidhume.org\" /> asking his contemporaries to judge him on the merits of the later texts alone, rather than the more radical formulations of his early, youthful work, dismissing his philosophical debut as [[juvenilia]]: \"A work which the Author had projected before he left College.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidhume.org/texts/etv2.html|title=Texts - Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects, vol. 2 (1777)|work=davidhume.org}}</ref> Despite Hume's protestations, a general consensus exists today that Hume's most important arguments and philosophically distinctive doctrines are found in the original form they take in the ''Treatise''. Hume was just 23 years old when he started this work and it is now regarded as one of the most important in the history of [[Western philosophy]].<ref name=\"books.google.com.au\" />\n\nHe worked for four years on his first major work, ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', subtitled \"Being an Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects\", completing it in 1738 at the age of 28. Although many scholars today consider the ''Treatise'' to be Hume's most important work and one of the most important books in Western philosophy, the critics in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the time did not agree, describing it as \"abstract and unintelligible\".{{sfn|Mossner|1950|p=195}} As Hume had spent most of his savings during those four years,{{sfn|Mossner|1950|p=193}} he resolved \"to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every object as contemptible except the improvements of my talents in literature\".{{sfn|Hume|1993|p=352}} Despite the disappointment, Hume later wrote, \"Being naturally of a cheerful and [[Humorism|sanguine]] temper, I soon recovered from the blow and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country.\"{{sfn|Hume|1993|p=352}} There, in an attempt to make his larger work better known and more intelligible, he published the ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature (Abstract)|An Abstract of a Book lately Published]]'' as a summary of the main doctrines of the ''Treatise'', without revealing its authorship.{{sfn|Hume|1740}} Although there has been some academic speculation as to who actually wrote this pamphlet{{sfn|Norton|1993|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vv5ERpFQBCoC&pg=PA31&dq=hume+abstract+author&hl=en&sa=X&ei=70ODVLXoM4r_UIDpgNgP&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=hume%20abstract%20author&f=false p. 31]}} it is generally regarded as Hume's creation.{{sfn|Redman|1997|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=1faeMedY8k8C&pg=PA175&dq=An+Abstract+of+a+Book+lately+Published;+Entitled&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XRryVP6yCYX6ygPViYDABg&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=An%20Abstract%20of%20a%20Book%20lately%20Published%3B%20Entitled&f=false p. 175, footnote 19]}}\n\nAfter the publication of ''Essays Moral and Political'' in 1741, which was included in the later edition called ''[[Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary]]'', Hume applied for the Chair of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. However, the position was given to [[William Cleghorn]]{{sfn|Nobbs|1965|p=575}} after Edinburgh ministers petitioned the town council not to appoint Hume because he was seen as an [[atheism|atheist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-rel/ |title=Hume, David: Religion &#124; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |accessdate=16 March 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:David Hume 1754.jpeg|thumb|left|An engraving of Hume from the first volume of his ''The History of England'', 1754]]\nDuring the 1745 [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite rising]], Hume tutored the [[George Vanden-Bempde, 3rd Marquess of Annandale|Marquess of Annandale]] (1720\u201392), who was \"judged to be a lunatic\".{{sfn|Mossner|1950|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7HXJAqqNl4QC&pg=PA378&dq=annandale+lunatic+hume&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bxWIVPykIYHtUtevgvAI&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=annandale%20lunatic%20hume&f=false p. 172]}} This engagement ended in disarray after about a year. However, it was then that Hume started his great historical work ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]''. This took him fifteen years and ran to over a million words. During this time he was also involved with the Canongate Theatre through his friend [[John Home]], a preacher.{{sfn|Fieser|2005|loc=[https://www.google.co.uk/search?tbm=bks&hl=en&q=canongate+theatre&gws_rd=ssl#hl=en&tbm=bks&q=canongate+theatre+hume+fieser p. xxii]}}\n\nIn this context, he associated with [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo|Lord Monboddo]] and other [[Scottish Enlightenment]] luminaries in Edinburgh. From 1746, Hume served for three years as secretary to General [[James St Clair]], who was envoy to the courts of [[Turin]] and [[Vienna]]. At that time Hume also wrote ''Philosophical Essays Concerning Human Understanding'', later published as ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''. Often called the ''First Enquiry'', it proved little more successful than the ''Treatise'', perhaps because of the publishing of his short autobiography, ''My Own Life'', which \"made friends difficult for the first Enquiry\".{{sfn|Buckle|1999|p= ?}}\nIn 1749 he went to live with his brother in the countryside.\n\nHume's religious views were often suspect. It was necessary in the 1750s for his friends to avert a trial against him on the charge of [[heresy in Christianity|heresy]]. However, he \"would not have come and could not be forced to attend if he said he was not a member of the Established Church\".{{sfn|Emerson|2009|p=244}} Hume failed to gain the [[Professor of Moral Philosophy (Glasgow)|chair of philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] for his religious views, too. He had published the ''[[Philosophical Essays]]'' by this time which were decidedly anti-religious. Even [[Adam Smith]], his personal friend who had vacated the Glasgow philosophy chair, was against his appointment out of concern public opinion would be against it.{{sfn|Rivers|2000|p=255}}\n\nHume returned to Edinburgh in 1751. In the following year \"the Faculty of Advocates chose me their Librarian, an office from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the command of a large library\".{{sfn|Hume|1778|p=11}} This resource enabled him to continue historical research for ''The History of England''. Hume's volume of ''Political Discourses'', written in 1749 and published by Kincaid & [[Alexander Donaldson (bookseller)|Donaldson]] in 1752,{{sfn|Sher|2008|p=312}} was the only work he considered successful on first publication.{{sfn|Hume|1778|p=10}}\n\nEventually, with the publication of his six volume ''The History of England'' between 1754 and 1762, Hume achieved the fame that he coveted.{{sfn|Emerson|2009|p=98}}  The volumes traced events from the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Invasion of Julius Caesar]] to the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], and was a bestseller in its day.\n\nHume was also a longtime friend of bookseller [[Andrew Millar]], who sold Hume's ''History (''after acquiring the rights from Scottish bookseller Gavin Hamilton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/2.html|title=The manuscripts, Letter from David Hume to Andrew Millar, 12 April, 1755.|website=www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref>), although the relationship was sometimes complicated.

Perhaps most notable is Hume's revelation of his own retrospective judgment that his philosophical debut's apparent failure \"had proceeded more from the manner than the matter.\" Hume thus suggests that  \"I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in going to the press too early.\" Hume provides an unambiguous self-assessment of the relative value of his works: \"my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject) is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best.\"  Hume also makes a number of self-assessments in the essay, writing of his social relations that \"My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary\", noting of his complex relation to religion, as well as the state, that \"though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury\", and professing of his character that \"My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct.\" Hume concludes the essay with the frank admission: \" I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained.\"<ref name=\"andromeda.rutgers.edu\"/>\n\nDiarist and biographer [[James Boswell]] saw Hume a few weeks before his death, which was from some form of abdominal cancer. Hume told him he sincerely believed it a \"most unreasonable fancy\" that there might be life after death.{{sfn|Boswell|1970|p= ?}} This meeting was dramatised in semi-fictional form for the [[BBC]] by [[Michael Ignatieff]] as ''Dialogue in the Dark''.{{sfn|Bassett|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MkTSD5UHu8AC&pg=PA272&dq=dark+hume+Michael+Ignatieff&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YEuIVIzbEseqUbzng_gP&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=dark%20hume%20Michael%20Ignatieff&f=false p. 272]}} Hume asked that his body be interred in a \"simple Roman tomb\". In his will he requests that it be inscribed only with his name and the year of his birth and death, \"leaving it to Posterity to add the Rest\".{{sfn|Mossner|1980|p=591}} It stands, as he wished it, on the southwestern slope of [[Calton Hill]], in the [[Old Calton Cemetery]]. Adam Smith later recounted Hume's amusing speculation that he might ask [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] to allow him a few more years of life in order to see \"the downfall of some of the prevailing systems of superstition.\" The ferryman replied, \"You loitering rogue, that will not happen these many hundred years&nbsp;... Get into the boat this instant\".{{sfn|Hume|1789|p=xxi}}\n\n==Writings==\nIn the introduction to ''A Treatise of Human Nature'', Hume wrote, \"'Tis evident, that all the sciences have a relation, more or less, to human nature&nbsp;... Even Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some measure dependent on the science of Man.\" He also wrote that the [[science of man]] is the \"only solid foundation for the other sciences\" and that the method for this science requires both experience and observation as the foundations of a logical argument.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=7}} On this aspect of Hume's thought, philosophical historian [[Frederick Copleston]] wrote that it was Hume's aim to apply to the science of man the method of experimental philosophy (the term that was current at the time to imply [[Natural philosophy]]), and that \"Hume's plan is to extend to philosophy in general the methodological limitations of [[classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]\".{{sfn|Copleston|1999|pp=405\u2013406}}\n\nUntil recently, Hume was seen as a forerunner of [[logical positivism]]; a form of anti-[[metaphysics|metaphysical]] empiricism. According to the logical positivists, unless a statement could be verified by experience, or else was true or false by definition (i.e. either [[tautology (logic)|tautological]] or [[contradiction|contradictory]]), then it was meaningless (this is a summary statement of their [[verificationism|verification principle]]). Hume, on this view, was a proto-positivist, who, in his philosophical writings, attempted to demonstrate how ordinary propositions about objects, causal relations, the self, and so on, are [[logical equivalence|semantically equivalent]] to propositions about one's experiences.{{sfn|Ayer|1946|p=40}}{{failed verification|date=March 2015}}\n\nMany commentators have since rejected this understanding of Humean empiricism, stressing an [[epistemology|epistemological]] (rather than a [[semantics|semantic]]) reading of his project.<ref name=CSW>See e.g. {{harvtxt|Craig|1987|loc=Ch. 2}}, {{harvtxt|Strawson|2014|p= ?}}, and {{harvtxt|Wright|1983|p= ?}}</ref> According to this opposing view, Hume's empiricism consisted in the idea that it is our knowledge, and not our ability to conceive, that is restricted to what can be experienced. Hume thought that we can form beliefs about that which extends beyond any possible experience, through the operation of faculties such as custom and the imagination, but he was sceptical about claims to knowledge on this basis.\n\n===Impressions and ideas===\n\nOne of the most central doctrines of Hume's philosophy, stated in the very first lines of the ''Treatise'', is his notion that the mind consists of its mental perceptions, or the mental objects which are present to it, and which divide into two categories: ''impressions'' and ''ideas''. Hume's Treatise thus opens with the words: 'All the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into two distinct kinds, which I shall call IMPRESSIONS and IDEAS.\"  Hume states that \"I believe it will not be very necessary to employ many words in explaining this distinction\" and commentators have generally taken Hume to mean the distinction between [[feeling]] and [[thinking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cognition-and-commitment-in-humes-philosophy-9780195159592?cc=us&lang=en&|title=Cognition and Commitment in Hume's Philosophy|work=oup.com}}</ref> Controversially, Hume may regard the difference as in some sense a matter of degree, as he takes \"impressions\" to be distinguished from ideas, on the basis of their force, liveliness, and vivacity, or what Henry Allison calls the \"FLV criterion\" in his book on Hume.<ref name=\"global.oup.com\">{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/custom-and-reason-in-hume-9780199532889?cc=us&lang=en&|title=Custom and Reason in Hume|work=oup.com}}</ref> Ideas are therefore \"faint\" impressions. For example, experiencing the painful sensation of touching the handle of a hot pan is more forceful than simply thinking about touching a hot pan.  According to Hume, impressions are meant to be the original form of all our ideas, and Don Garret has thus coined the term \"the copy principle\" to refer to Hume's doctrine that all ideas are ultimately all copied from some original impression, whether it be a passion or sensation, from which they derive.<ref name=\"global.oup.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/products/9780415283342|title=Hume|date=30 October 2014|work=routledge.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter establishing the forcefulness of impressions and ideas, these two categories are further broken down into simple and complex: simple impressions and ideas, and complex impressions and ideas. Hume states that \u201csimple perceptions or impressions and ideas are such as admit of no distinction nor separation,\u201d while \u201cthe complex are the contrary to these, and may be distinguished into parts.\u201d<ref>Hume, D. (1896). A Treatise of Human Nature (L. A. Selby-Bigge, Ed.). Wotton-under-Edge: Oxford: Clarendon Press. Retrieved May 4, 2017, from Center for Security Studies.</ref> When looking at an apple, a person experiences a variety of color-sensations, which Hume sees as a complex impression. Similarly, a person experiences a variety of taste-sensations, tactile-sensations, and smell-sensations when biting into an apple, with the overall sensation again being a complex impression. Thinking about an apple allows a person to form complex ideas, which are made of similar parts as the complex impressions they were developed from, but which are also less forceful. Hume believes that complex perceptions can be broken down into smaller and smaller parts until perceptions are reached that have no parts of their own, and these perceptions are thereby referred to as being simple.\n                 \nA person\u2019s imagination, regardless of how boundless it may seem, is confined to the mind\u2019s ability to recombine the information it has already acquired from the body\u2019s sensory experience (the ideas that have been derived from impressions). In addition, \u201cas our imagination takes our most basic ideas and leads us to form new ones, it is directed by three principles of association, namely, resemblance, contiguity, and cause and effect.\"<ref>Fieser, J. (2011, July 1). David Hume (1711-1776). In Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Retrieved March 8, 2017, from http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume/</ref> The principle of resemblance refers to the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent resemble one another. For example, a person looking at an illustration of a flower can conceive of an idea of the physical flower because the idea of the illustrated object is associated with the idea of the physical object. The principle of contiguity describes the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent are near to each other in time or space, such as when the thought of one crayon in a box leads a person to think of the crayon contiguous to it. Finally, the principle of cause and effect refers to the tendency of ideas to become associated if the objects they represent are causally related, which explains how remembering a broken window can make someone think of the baseball that caused the window to shatter.\n  \nHume elaborates more on this last principle of cause and effect. When a person observes that one object or event consistently produces the same object or event, it results in \u201can expectation that a particular event (a 'cause') will be followed by another event (an 'effect') previously and constantly associated with it.\"<ref>Norton, D.

(1990). An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. New York, NY: Anchor/Doubleday.</ref> However, even though custom can serve as a guide in life, it still only represents an expectation.

(2010). Masterplots, Fourth Edition, 1\u20133.</ref> He uses this skepticism to reject metaphysics and many theological views on the basis that they are not grounded in fact and observations, and are therefore beyond the reach of human understanding.\n\n===Induction and causation<!--linked from 'Problem of induction'-->===\nThe cornerstone of Hume's epistemology is the [[problem of induction]]. This may be the area of Hume's thought where his scepticism about human powers of reason is most pronounced.{{sfn| Kenyon|Craig|1985|p= ?}} The problem revolves around the plausibility of [[inductive reasoning]], that is, reasoning from the observed behaviour of objects to their behaviour when unobserved. As Hume wrote, induction concerns how things behave when they go \"beyond the present testimony of the senses, or the records of our memory\".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p= 26}} Hume argues that we tend to believe that things behave in a regular manner, meaning that patterns in the behaviour of objects seem to persist into the future, and throughout the unobserved present.{{sfn|Atherton|1999|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=9u56iKhWQu4C&pg=PA202&dq=hume+Uniformity+of+Nature&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DVOIVKTQAon4UojxgJgL&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=hume%20Uniformity%20of%20Nature&f=false pp. 202\u2013203]}} Hume's argument is that we cannot rationally justify the claim that nature will continue to be uniform, as justification comes in only two varieties\u2014demonstrative reasoning and probable reasoning{{refn|These are Hume's terms. In modern parlance, ''demonstration'' may be termed ''[[deductive reasoning]]'', while ''probability'' may be termed ''[[inductive reasoning]]''.{{sfn|Millican|1996|p= ?}}|group=note}}\u2014and both of these are inadequate. With regard to demonstrative reasoning, Hume argues that the uniformity principle cannot be demonstrated, as it is \"consistent and conceivable\" that nature might stop being regular.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p= 111}} Turning to probable reasoning, Hume argues that we cannot hold that nature will continue to be uniform because it has been in the past. As this is using the very sort of reasoning (induction) that is under question, it would be [[circular reasoning]].{{sfn|Hume|1777|p= 115}} Thus, no form of justification will rationally warrant our inductive inferences.\n\nHume's solution to this problem is to argue that, rather than reason, natural instinct explains the human practice of making inductive inferences. He asserts that \"Nature, by an absolute and uncontroulable necessity has determin'd us to judge as well as to breathe and feel.\" Agreeing, philosopher [[John D. Kenyon]] writes: \"Reason might manage to raise a doubt about the truth of a conclusion of natural inductive inference just for a moment&nbsp;... but the sheer agreeableness of animal faith will protect us from excessive caution and sterile suspension of belief.\"{{sfn|Kenyon|Craig|1985|p= 254}} Commentators such as [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] have demurred from Hume's solution,{{sfn|Harris|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=uBbfizzKTDoC&lpg=PA42&pg=PA42&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 42]}} while, some, such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Karl Popper]], saw that Hume's analysis \"had posed a most fundamental challenge to all human knowledge claims.\"{{sfn|Popkin|2014}}\n\nThe notion of [[Causality|causation]] is closely linked to the problem of induction. According to Hume, we reason inductively by associating constantly conjoined events. It is the mental act of association that is the basis of our concept of causation. There are at least three interpretations of Hume's theory of causation represented in the literature: (1) the logical positivist; (2) the sceptical realist; and (3) the quasi-realist.{{sfn|Read|Richman|2002|pp=13\u201314 and 69}}\n\nHume acknowledged that there are events constantly unfolding, humanity cannot guarantee that these events are caused by events prior or if they are independent instances. Hume opposed the widely accepted theory of Causation that 'all events have a specific course or reason.' Therefore Hume crafted his own theory of causation, which he formed through his empiricist and skeptic beliefs. He split Causation, into two realms \u201cAll the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact\u201d.<ref>. \"Davidhume.org.\" Texts - An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (1748, 1777). Web. 19 Mar. 2017.</ref> Relations of Ideas are a priori, and represent universal bonds between ideas that mark the cornerstones of human thought. Matters of Fact are dependent on the observer and experience. They are often not universally held to be true among multiple persons. Hume was an Empiricist, meaning he believed \u201ccauses and effects are discoverable not by reason, but by experience\u201d.<ref>.\"Davidhume.org.\" Texts - An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (1748, 1777). Web. 19 Mar. 2017.</ref> Hume later goes on to say that even with the perspective of the past, humanity cannot dictate future events because thoughts of the past are limited, compared to the possibilities for the future. Hume's separation between Matters of Fact and Relations of Ideas is often referred to as \"[[Hume's fork]]\".<ref name=SEP>William Edward Morris, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ \"David Hume\"], [[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (May 21, 2014), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)</ref>\n\nHume explains his theory of Causation and causal inference by division into three different parts. In these three branches he explains his ideas, in addition to comparing and contrasting his views to his predecessors. These branches are the Critical Phase, the Constructive Phase, and Belief.<ref name=\"Davidhume 1748\">\"Davidhume.org.\" Texts - An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (1748, 1777). Web. 19 Mar. 2017.</ref> In the Critical Phase, Hume denies his predecessors' theories of causation. Next, Hume uses the Constructive Phase to resolve any doubts the reader may have while observing the Critical Phase. \u201cHabit or Custom\u201d mend the gaps in reasoning that occur without the human mind even realizing it. Associating ideas has become second nature to the human mind. It \u201cmakes us expect for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past\u201d <ref name=\"Davidhume 1748\"/> However, Hume says that this association cannot be trusted because the span of the human mind to comprehend the past is not necessarily applicable to the wide and distant future. This leads Hume to the third branch of causal inference, Belief. Belief is what drives the human mind to hold that expectancy of the future based on past experience. Throughout his explanation of causal inference, Hume is arguing that the future is not certain to be repetition of the past and the only way to justify induction is through uniformity.\n\nThe [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] interpretation is that Hume analyses causal propositions, such as \"A caused B\", in terms of regularities in perception: \"A causes B\" is equivalent to \"Whenever A-type events happen, B-type ones follow\", where \"whenever\" refers to all possible perceptions.<ref>For this account of Hume's views on causation cf. {{harvtxt|Ayer|1946|pp=40\u201342}}</ref> In his ''Treatise of Human Nature'', Hume wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\npower and necessity&nbsp;... are&nbsp;... qualities of perceptions, not of objects&nbsp;... felt by the soul and not perceiv'd externally in bodies.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=167}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThis view is rejected by skeptical [[Philosophical realism|realists]], who argue that Hume thought that causation amounts to more than just the regular succession of events.<ref name=CSW /> Hume said that when two events are causally conjoined, a necessary connection underpins the conjunction:\n\n<blockquote>\nShall we rest contented with these two relations of contiguity and succession, as affording a complete idea of causation? By no means&nbsp;... there is a ''necessary connexion'' to be taken into consideration.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=78|ps=, original emphasis}}\n</blockquote>\n\nPhilosopher Angela Coventry writes that, for Hume, \"there is nothing in any particular instance of cause and effect involving external objects which suggests the idea of power or necessary connection\" and that \"we are ignorant of the powers that operate between objects\".{{sfn|Coventry|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gq348MmuojAC&dq=hume+coventry&q=%22effect+involving%22#v=snippet&q=%22effect%20involving%22&f=false pp. 91\u201392]}} However, while denying the possibility of knowing the powers between objects, Hume accepted the causal principle, writing, \"I never asserted so absurd a proposition as that something could arise without a cause.\"{{sfn|Hume|2011|p=187}}\n\nIt has been argued that, while Hume did not think causation is reducible to pure regularity, he was not a fully fledged realist either. Philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] calls this a [[quasi-realism|quasi-realist]] reading.{{sfn|Blackburn|1990|p= ?}} Blackburn writes that \"Someone talking of cause is voicing a distinct mental set: he is by no means in the same state as someone merely describing regular sequences.<ref>Quoted by {{harvtxt|Dauer|2010|p=97}}</ref> In Hume's words, \"nothing is more usual than to apply to external bodies every internal sensation, which they occasion\".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=78, fn 17}}\n\n===The self===\n[[File:DavidHume.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Hume by [[Alexander Stoddart]] on the [[Royal Mile]] in Edinburgh]]\nEmpiricist philosophers, such as Hume and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], favoured the [[bundle theory]] of [[personal identity]].{{sfn|Dicker|2002|p=15}} In this theory, \"the mind itself, far from being an independent power, is simply 'a bundle of perceptions' without unity or cohesive quality\".{{sfn|Maurer|2013}} The self is nothing but a bundle of experiences linked by the relations of causation and resemblance; or, more accurately, that the empirically warranted idea of the self is just the idea of such a bundle. This view is forwarded by, for example, positivist interpreters, who saw Hume as suggesting that terms such as \"self\", \"person\", or \"mind\" referred to collections of \"sense-contents\".{{sfn|Ayer|1946|pp=135\u2013136}} A modern-day version of the bundle theory of the mind has been advanced by [[Derek Parfit]] in his ''[[Reasons and Persons]]''.{{sfn|Parfit|1984|p= ?}}\n\nHowever, some philosophers have criticised Hume's bundle-theory interpretation of personal identity. They argue that distinct selves can have perceptions that stand in relations of similarity and causality with one another. Thus, perceptions must already come parcelled into distinct \"bundles\" before they can be associated according to the relations of similarity and causality. In other words, the mind must already possess a unity that cannot be generated, or constituted, by these relations alone. Since the bundle-theory interpretation portrays Hume as answering an [[ontology|ontological]] question, philosophers, like [[Galen Strawson]], who see Hume as not very concerned with such questions have queried whether the view is really Hume's. Instead, it is suggested by Strawson that Hume might have been answering an epistemological question about the causal origin of our concept of the self.{{sfn|Strawson|2011|p= ?}} In the Appendix to the ''Treatise'', Hume declares himself dissatisfied with his earlier account of personal identity in Book 1. Philosopher Corliss Swain notes that \"Commentators agree that if Hume did find some new problem\" when he reviewed the section on personal identity, \"he wasn't forthcoming about its nature in the Appendix.\"{{sfn|Swain|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qoh7_nZbBjYC&pg=PA143&dq=hume+blackwell+new+problem&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SmODVNGVG8G9UeJV&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=hume%20blackwell%20new%20problem&f=false p. 142]}} One interpretation of Hume's view of the self has been argued for by philosopher and psychologist [[James Giles (philosopher)|James Giles]]. According to his view, Hume is not arguing for a bundle theory, which is a form of reductionism, but rather for an eliminative view of the self. That is, rather than reducing the self to a bundle of perceptions, Hume is rejecting the idea of the self altogether. On this interpretation, Hume is proposing a \"[[Personal identity#The no-self theory|no-self theory]]\" and thus has much in common with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] thought.{{sfn|Giles|1993|p= ?}} On this point, psychologist [[Alison Gopnik]] has argued that Hume was in a position to learn about Buddhist thought during his time in France in the 1730s.{{sfn|Gopnik|2009|p= ?}}\n\n===Practical reason===\nAn essential question of practical reason for Hume was whether or not standards or principles exist (and if they do, what they are) for practical reason, that are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people\u2019s intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist, denying the possibility for practical reason as a principle to exist, although other philosophers such as [[Christine Korsgaard]], [[Jean Hampton]], and [[Elijah Millgram]] claim that Hume is not so much of an anti-rationalist as he is just a skeptic of practical reason.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=Michelle |authorlink= Michelle Mason |volume= 31 |issue= 2 |date=September 2005 |title=Hume and Humeans on Practical Reason |url=http://www.humesociety.org/hs/issues/v31n2/mason/mason-v31n2.pdf |publisher= [[Hume Studies]] |accessdate=2016-05-27 }}</ref>\n\nHume denied the existence of practical reason as a principle because he claimed reason does not have any effect on morality, since morality is capable of producing effects in people that reason alone cannot create. As Hume explains in ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1740): \u201cMorals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=Hume |first=David|date=1740 |edition=1978|title=A Treatise of Human Nature |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon P |page=457}}</ref>\n\nSince practical reason is supposed to regulate our actions (in theory), Hume denied practical reason on the grounds that reason cannot directly oppose passions. As Hume puts it, \u201cReason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.\u201d Reason is less significant than any passion because reason has no original influence, while \"A passion is an original existence, or, if you will, modification of existence\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hume |first=David|date=1740 |edition=1978 |title=A Treatise of Human Nature |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon P |page=415}}</ref>\n\nPractical reason is also concerned with the value of actions rather than the truth of propositions,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=practical-reason |title=Practical Reason |last=Wallace |first=Jay |date=2014 | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=29 April 2016}}</ref> so Hume believed that reason\u2019s shortcoming of affecting morality proved that practical reason could not be authoritative for all rational beings, since morality was essential for dictating people\u2019s intentions and actions.\n\n===Ethics===\n{{see also|is\u2013ought problem}}\nHume's writings on ethics began in the ''Treatise'' and were refined in his ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (1751). His views on ethics are that \"[m]oral decisions are grounded in moral sentiment.\" It is not knowing that governs ethical actions, but feelings.{{sfn|Cranston|2014|p=4}} Arguing that reason cannot be behind morality, he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nMorals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=458}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHume's [[moral sentimentalism]] about morality was shared by his close friend Adam Smith,{{sfn|Hume|2013|p=548}}{{failed verification|date=March 2015}} and Hume and Smith were mutually influenced by the moral reflections of their older contemporary [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].{{sfn|Taylor|1965|p= ?}} [[Peter Singer]] claims that Hume's argument that morals cannot have a rational basis alone \"would have been enough to earn him a place in the history of ethics\".{{sfn|Singer|2015}}\n\nHume also put forward the [[is\u2013ought problem]], later called ''Hume's Law'',{{sfn|Singer|2015}} denying the possibility of logically deriving what ''ought'' to be from what ''is''. He wrote in the ''Treatise'' that in every system of morality he has read, the author begins with stating facts about the world, but then suddenly is always referring to what ought to be the case. Hume demands that a reason should be given for inferring what ought to be the case, from what is the case. This because it \"seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others\".{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=470}}\n\nHume's theory of ethics has been influential in modern day [[Meta-ethics|meta-ethical theory]],{{sfn|Edwards|2002|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=0pGKAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA44&dq=Hume++meta-ethics+influence&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zrmIVL_FE4iBUc-JgIAG&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Hume%20%20meta-ethics%20influence&f=false p. 44]}} helping to inspire [[emotivism]],{{sfn|Humber|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dh-E6oIlCkAC&pg=PA136&dq=Hume+emotivism+influence&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9LuIVIfhIIW1UaCIg_AM&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Hume%20emotivism%20influence&f=false p. 136]}} and ethical [[expressivism]] and [[non-cognitivism]],{{sfn|Brown|2005|pp=97\u2013100}}{{failed verification|date=March 2015}} as well as [[Allan Gibbard]]'s general theory of moral judgment and judgments of rationality.{{sfn|Angier|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ndyMavMbiZMC&pg=PA114&dq=Hume++influence+gibbard&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0r-IVKLZF4PwUJbrgLAJ&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Hume%20%20influence%20gibbard&f=false p. 114]}}\n\n===Aesthetics===\nHume's ideas about [[aesthetics]] and the [[theory of art]] are spread throughout his works, but are particularly connected with his ethical writings, and also the essays ''[[Of the Standard of Taste]]'' and ''[[Of Tragedy]]''. His views are rooted in the work of [[Joseph Addison]] and Francis Hutcheson.{{sfn|Gracyk|2011|loc= ch. 1}} In the ''Treatise'' he wrote of the connection between beauty and deformity and vice and virtue,{{sfn|Hume|1739|loc=Sect.

However, a reliable critic of taste can be recognised as being objective, sensible and unprejudiced, and having extensive experience.{{sfn|Harris|2013|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=zWMBAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA401&dq=hume+aesthetics&hl=en&sa=X&ei=AxaGVPzBHcjsUsjwgOAP&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=hume%20aesthetics&f=false p. 401]}} ''Of Tragedy'' addresses the question of why humans enjoy [[tragedy|tragic drama]]. Hume was concerned with the way spectators find pleasure in the sorrow and anxiety depicted in a tragedy. He argued that this was because the spectator is aware that he is witnessing a dramatic performance.

Hume, to this end, was influenced greatly by the scientific revolution and by in particular Sir Isaac Newton.{{sfn|Wright|2010|p= ?}} Hume argued that the dispute about the compatibility of freedom and determinism has been continued over two thousand years by ambiguous terminology. He wrote: \"From this circumstance alone, that a controversy has been long kept on foot&nbsp;... we may presume that there is some ambiguity in the expression\", and that different disputants use different meanings for the same terms.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=81}}{{sfn|Passmore|2013||loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vZRtAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA73&dq=hume+presume+that+there+is+some+ambiguity&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3zSMVOvlJYnyULWZhPgP&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=hume%20presume%20that%20there%20is%20some%20ambiguity&f=false p. 73]}}\n\nHume defines the concept of necessity as \"the uniformity, observable in the operations of nature; where similar objects are constantly conjoined together\",{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=82}} and [[liberty]] as \"a power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the will\".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=95}} He then argues that, according to these definitions, not only are the two compatible, but liberty ''requires'' necessity. For if our actions were not necessitated in the above sense, they would \"have so little in connexion with motives, inclinations and circumstances, that one does not follow with a certain degree of uniformity from the other\". But if our actions are not thus connected to the will, then our actions can never be free: they would be matters of \"chance; which is universally allowed to have no existence\".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=96}} Australian philosopher [[John Passmore]] writes that confusion has arisen because \"necessity\" has been taken to mean \"necessary connexion\". Once this has been abandoned, Hume argues that \"liberty and necessity will be found not to be in conflict one with another\".{{sfn|Passmore|2013||loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vZRtAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA73&dq=hume+presume+that+there+is+some+ambiguity&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3zSMVOvlJYnyULWZhPgP&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=hume%20presume%20that%20there%20is%20some%20ambiguity&f=false p. 73]}}\n\nMoreover, Hume goes on to argue that in order to be held [[morally responsible]], it is required that our behaviour be caused or necessitated, for, as he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Actions are, by their very nature, temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some ''cause'' in the character and disposition of the person who performed them, they can neither redound to his honour, if good; nor infamy, if evil.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=98|ps=, original emphasis}}</blockquote>\n\nHume describes the link between causality and our capacity to rationally make a decision from this an inference of the mind. Human beings assess a situation based upon certain predetermined events and from that form a choice. Hume believes that this choice is made spontaneously. Hume calls this form of decision making the liberty of spontaneity.{{sfn|Mounce|Mounce|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qyepEVWo0v8C&pg=PA66&dq=hume+liberty+of+spontaneity&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bjeMVOKlG4L6UJe1gNgL&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=hume%20liberty%20of%20spontaneity&f=false p. 66]}}\n\nEducation writer Richard Wright considers that Hume's position rejects a famous moral puzzle attributed to French philosopher [[Jean Buridan]]. The [[Buridan's ass]] puzzle describes a donkey that is hungry. This donkey has on both sides of him separate bales of hay, which are of equal distances from him. The problem concerns which bale the donkey chooses. Buridan was said to believe that the donkey would die, because he has no [[autonomy]]. The donkey is incapable of forming a rational decision as there is no motive to choose one bale of hay over the other. However, human beings are different, because a human who is placed in a position where he is forced to choose one loaf of bread over another will make a decision to take one in lieu of the other. For Buridan, humans have the capacity of autonomy, and he recognises the choice that is ultimately made will be based on chance, as both loaves of bread are exactly the same. However, Wright says that Hume completely rejects this notion, arguing that a human will spontaneously act in such a situation because he is faced with impending death if he fails to do so. Such a decision is not made on the basis of chance, but rather on necessity and spontaneity, given the prior predetermined events leading up to the predicament.{{sfn|Wright|2010|p= ?}}\n\nHume's argument is supported by modern day compatibilists such as [[R. E. Hobart]], a pseudonym of philosopher Dickinson S. Miller.<ref>See e.g. {{harvtxt|Hobart|1934|p=?}} and {{harvtxt|Carroll|Markosian|2010|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=f6bcZq4_4gUC&pg=PA54&dq=hume+hobart+Free+Will+as+Involving&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vjiMVJalEcjzUIu6gdgL&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=hume%20hobart%20Free%20Will%20as%20Involving&f=false p. 54, note 11]}}</ref> However, [[P.

All of these aspects were discussed in Hume's 1757 dissertation, ''The Natural History of Religion''. Here he argued that the [[monotheistic]] religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam all derive from earlier [[polytheistic]] religions. He also suggested that all religious belief \"traces, in the end, to dread of the unknown.\"{{sfn|O'Connor|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ntygPAezQJUC&pg=PA7&dq=hume+religion&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1s_GU_r3KPPH7Abi94GgAg&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=hume%20religion&f=false pp. 7\u20138]}} Hume had also written on religious subjects in the first ''Enquiry'', as well as later in the ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion''.{{sfn|Russell|2014|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/ Ch. 1]}}\n\n====Religious views====\nAlthough he wrote a great deal about religion, Hume's personal views are unclear, and there has been much discussion concerning his religious position.<ref>E.g in {{harvtxt|Russell|2010}}, {{harvtxt|O'Connor|2013}}, and {{harvtxt|Norton|1993}}</ref> Contemporaries considered him to be an atheist, or at least un-Christian, and the [[Church of Scotland]] seriously considered bringing charges of infidelity against him.{{sfn|Mossner|1980|p=206}} The fact that contemporaries thought that he may have been an atheist is exemplified by a story Hume liked to tell:\n\n<blockquote>The best theologian he ever met, he used to say, was the old Edinburgh fishwife who, having recognized him as Hume the atheist, refused to pull him out of the bog into which he had fallen until he declared he was a Christian and repeated the Lord's prayer.{{sfn|Scharfstein|1998|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iZQy2lu70bwC&pg=PA454&dq=hume++fishwives&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wi3KU6jOGMaM7AaRoIDYBQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=hume%20%20fishwives&f=false p. 454, footnote]}}</blockquote>\n\nHowever, in works such as ''Of Superstition and Enthusiasm'', Hume specifically seems to support the standard religious views of his time and place. This still meant that he could be very critical of the [[Catholic Church]], dismissing it with the standard [[Protestant]] accusations of superstition and idolatry,{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=51}}{{sfn|Hume|1741|p=70}} as well as dismissing as idolatry what his compatriots saw as uncivilised beliefs.{{sfn|Hume|1757|p=34}} He also considered extreme Protestant sects, the members of which he called \"enthusiasts\", to be corrupters of religion.{{sfn|Hume|1741|pp=73\u201376}} By contrast, in his ''[[The Natural History of Religion]]'', Hume presented arguments suggesting that [[polytheism]] had much to commend it over [[monotheism]].{{sfn|Hume|1757|p=63}}\n\nPhilosopher [[Paul Russell (philosopher)|Paul Russell]] writes that it is likely that Hume was sceptical about religious belief, but not to the extent of complete atheism.  He suggests that perhaps Hume's position is best characterised by the term \"irreligion\",{{sfn|Russell|2010|pp=202, 204\u2013205, and 284}} while philosopher David O'Connor argues that Hume's final position was \"weakly [[deistic]]\". For O'Connor, Hume's \"position is deeply ironic. This is because, while inclining towards a weak form of [[deism]], he seriously doubts that we can ever find a sufficiently favourable balance of evidence to justify accepting any religious position.\" He adds that Hume \"did not believe in the God of standard theism&nbsp;... but he did not rule out all concepts of deity\", and that \"ambiguity suited his purposes, and this creates difficulty in definitively pinning down his final position on religion\".{{sfn|O'Connor|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ntygPAezQJUC&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=%22but+he+did+not+rule+out+all+concepts+of+deity%22&source=bl&ots=ulLs4-GWED&sig=XcJNdJXP3jP-N0ynFZ8wroDbAUg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CtwmVd-BKueP7AbA14CYDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22but%20he%20did%20not%20rule%20out%20all%20concepts%20of%20deity%22&f=false pp.11, 19]}}\n\n====Design argument====\nOne of the traditional topics of [[natural theology]] is that of the [[existence of God]], and one of the ''[[a posteriori]]'' arguments for this is the ''argument from design'' or the [[teleological argument]]. The argument is that the existence of God can be proved by the design that is obvious in the complexity of the world. ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' states that this is \"the most popular, because [it is] the most accessible of the theistic arguments&nbsp;... which identifies evidences of design in nature, inferring from them a divine designer&nbsp;... The fact that the universe as a whole is a coherent and efficiently functioning system likewise, in this view, indicates a divine intelligence behind it.\"<ref name = RE>[[#{{harvid|RE}}|RE]]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Hume wrote that the design argument seems to depend upon our experience, and its proponents \"always suppose the universe, an effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be the proof of a Deity, a cause no less singular and unparalleled\".{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=148}} Philosopher Louise E. Loeb notes that Hume is saying that only experience and observation can be our guide to making inferences about the conjunction between events. However, according to Hume, \"we observe neither God nor other universes, and hence no conjunction involving them. There is no observed conjunction to ground an inference either to extended objects or to God, as unobserved causes.\"{{sfn|Loeb|2010|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6ECxW_2tAf0C&pg=PA118&dq=companion+hume+observe+neither+God+nor+other+universes&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Z0OMVMfjJob1UvykgLAN&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=companion%20hume%20observe%20neither%20God%20nor%20other%20universes&f=false p. 118]}}\n\nHume also criticised the argument in his ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion'' (1779). In this, he suggested that, even if the world is a more or less smoothly functioning system, this may only be a result of the \"chance permutations of particles falling into a temporary or permanent self-sustaining order, which thus has the appearance of design.\"<ref name=RE />\n\nA century later, the idea of order without design was rendered more plausible by Charles Darwin's discovery that the adaptations of the forms of life are a result of the [[natural selection]] of inherited characteristics.<ref name=RE /> For philosopher James D. Madden, it is \"Hume, rivaled only by Darwin, [who] has done the most to undermine in principle our confidence in arguments from design among all figures in the Western intellectual tradition.\"{{sfn|Madden|2005|loc= [https://books.google.com/books?id=UKSZeRnuyjAC&pg=PA150&dq=teleological+god+hume+darwin&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FvrIU4uBMYOu7AaV1oGQCw&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=teleological%20god%20hume%20darwin&f=false p. 150, emphasis removed.]}}\n\nFinally, Hume discussed a version of the [[anthropic principle]], which is the idea that theories of the universe are constrained by the need to allow for man's existence in it as an observer. Hume has his sceptical mouthpiece Philo suggest that there may have been many worlds, produced by an incompetent designer, whom he called a \"stupid mechanic\". In his ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion'', Hume wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Many worlds might have been botched and bungled throughout an eternity, ere this system was struck out: much labour lost: many fruitless trials made: and a slow, but continued improvement carried on during infinite ages in the art of world-making.{{sfn|Hume|1779|p=167}}\n</blockquote>\n\nAmerican philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] has suggested that this mechanical explanation of teleology, although \"obviously&nbsp;... an amusing philosophical fantasy\", anticipated the notion of natural selection, the 'continued improvement' being like \"any Darwinian selection algorithm.\"{{sfn|Dennett|2009|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=i1tNI9646Q4C&pg=PA620&dq=hume++anthropic+principle&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4zXKU_nGCqaw7Aa-w4GAAg&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=hume%20%20anthropic%20principle&f=false pp. 620\u2013621]}}\n\n====Problem of miracles====\n{{main|Of Miracles}}\n\nIn his discussion of [[miracle]]s, Hume argues that we should not believe that miracles have occurred and that they do not therefore provide us with any reason to think that God exists.{{sfn|Bailey|O'Brien|2006|p=101}} In ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'' (Section 10), Hume defines a miracle as \"a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent\". Hume says that we believe an event that has frequently occurred is likely to occur again, but we also take into account those instances where the event did not occur. Hume wrote:\n\n<blockquote>A wise man [...] considers which side is supported by the greater number of experiments [...] A hundred instances or experiments on one side, and fifty on another, afford a doubtful expectation of any event; though a hundred uniform experiments, with only one that is contradictory, reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance. In all cases, we must balance the opposite experiments [...] and deduct the smaller number from the greater, in order to know the exact force of the superior evidence.{{sfn|Hume|1777|pp=110\u2013111}}</blockquote>\n\nHume discusses the testimony of those who report miracles. He wrote that testimony might be doubted even from some great authority in case the facts themselves are not credible. \"[T]he evidence, resulting from the testimony, admits of a diminution, greater or less, in proportion as the fact is more or less unusual.\"{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=113}}\n\nAlthough Hume leaves open the possibility for miracles to occur and be reported, he offers various arguments against this ever having happened in history:{{sfn|Hume|1777|pp=116\u2013131|ps=, Part II of Section X}} He points out that people often lie, and they have good reasons to lie about miracles occurring either because they believe they are doing so for the benefit of their religion or because of the fame that results. Furthermore, people by nature enjoy relating miracles they have heard without caring for their veracity and thus miracles are easily transmitted even where false. Also, Hume notes that miracles seem to occur mostly in \"ignorant and barbarous nations\"{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=119}} and times, and the reason they do not occur in the civilised societies is such societies are not awed by what they know to be natural events. Finally, the miracles of each religion argue against all other religions and their miracles, and so even if a proportion of all reported miracles across the world fit Hume's requirement for belief, the miracles of each religion make the other less likely.{{sfn|Bailey|O'Brien|2006|pp=105\u2013108}}\n\nHume was extremely pleased with his argument against miracles in his ''Enquiry''. He states \"I flatter myself, that I have discovered an argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures.\"{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=110}} Thus, Hume's argument against miracles had a more abstract basis founded upon the scrutiny, not just primarily of miracles, but of all forms of belief systems. It is a common sense notion of veracity based upon epistemological evidence, and founded on a principle of rationality, proportionality and reasonability.{{sfn|Bailey|O'Brien|2006|pp=105\u2013108}}\n\nThe criterion for assessing a belief system for Hume is based on the balance of probability whether something is more likely than not to have occurred. Since the weight of empirical experience contradicts the notion for the existence of miracles, such accounts should be treated with scepticism. Further, the myriad of accounts of miracles contradict one another, as some people who receive miracles will aim to prove the authority of Jesus, whereas others will aim to prove the authority of Muhammad or some other religious prophet or deity. These various differing accounts weaken the overall evidential power of miracles.{{sfn| Ahluwalia|2008|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-PCV11VQ8PYC&pg=PA104&dq=%22Understanding+Philosophy+of+Religion%22+hume&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6qs4Vbe4EofXPeywgbgN&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Understanding%20Philosophy%20of%20Religion%22%20hume&f=false pp.104\u2013106]}}{{failed verification|date=April 2015}}\n\nDespite all this, Hume observes that belief in miracles is popular, and that \"The gazing populace [...] receive greedily, without examination, whatever soothes superstition, and promotes wonder.\"{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=126}}\n\nCritics have argued that Hume's position assumes the character of miracles and [[natural law]]s prior to any specific examination of miracle claims, thus it amounts to a subtle form of [[begging the question]]. To assume that testimony is a homogeneous reference group seems unwise- to compare private miracles with public miracles, unintellectual observers with intellectual observers and those who have little to gain and much to lose with those with much to gain and little to lose is not convincing to many. Indeed, many have argued that miracles not only do not contradict the laws of nature, but require the laws of nature to be intelligible as miraculous, and thus subverting the law of nature. For example, William Adams remarks that \"there must be an ordinary course of nature before anything can be extraordinary. There must be a stream before anything can be interrupted\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/essayinanswertom00adamiala#page/14/mode/2up |title=An essay in answer to Mr. Hume's Essay on miracles |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=16 March 2017}}</ref> They have also noted that it requires an appeal to inductive inference, as none have observed every part of nature nor examined every possible miracle claim, for instance those in the future.

Such natural laws are codified as a result of past experiences. Therefore, a miracle is a violation of all prior experience and thus incapable on this basis of reasonable belief. However, the probability that something has occurred in contradiction of all past experience should always be judged to be less than the probability that either ones senses have deceived one, or the person recounting the miraculous occurrence is lying or mistaken. Hume would say, all of which he had past experience of. For Hume, this refusal to grant credence does not guarantee correctness. He offers the example of an Indian Prince, who, having grown up in a hot country, refuses to believe that water has frozen. By Hume's lights, this refusal is not wrong and the Prince \"reasoned justly\"; it is presumably only when he has had extensive experience of the freezing of water that he has warrant to believe that the event could occur.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=113}}\n\nSo for Hume, either the miraculous event will become a recurrent event or else it will never be rational to believe it occurred. The connection to religious belief is left unexplained throughout, except for the close of his discussion where Hume notes the reliance of Christianity upon testimony of miraculous occurrences. He makes an ironic remark that anyone who \"is moved by faith to assent\" to revealed testimony \"is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person, which subverts all principles of his understanding, and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience.\"{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=131|ps=, emphasis removed}}{{sfn|MacKie|1982|p=29}} Hume writes that \"All the testimony which ever was really given for any miracle, or ever will be given, is a subject of derision.\"{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=113}}\n\n===As historian of England===\n[[File:David Hume 2.jpg|thumb| David Hume by [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], 1766]]\nFrom 1754 to 1762 Hume published ''The History of England'', a 6-volume work, which extends, says its subtitle, \"From the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688\". Inspired by [[Voltaire]]'s sense of the breadth of history, Hume widened the focus of the field away from merely kings, parliaments, and armies, to literature and science as well. He argued that the quest for liberty was the highest standard for judging the past, and concluded that after considerable fluctuation, England at the time of his writing had achieved \"the most entire system of liberty that was ever known amongst mankind\".<ref>Hume's History of England, vol, 6, p. 531 cited in {{harvtxt|Kenyon|1984|p=42}}</ref> It \"must be regarded as an event of cultural importance. In its own day, moreover, it was an innovation, soaring high above its very few predecessors.\"{{sfn|Jessop|2015}}\n\nHume's coverage of the political upheavals of the 17th century relied in large part on the [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon]]'s ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England'' (1646\u201369). Generally, Hume took a moderate [[royalist]] position and considered revolution unnecessary to achieve necessary reform. Hume was considered a Tory historian, and emphasised religious differences more than constitutional issues. Laird Okie explains that \"Hume preached the virtues of political moderation, but&nbsp;... it was moderation with an anti-Whig, pro-royalist coloring.\"{{sfn|Okie|1985|p=16}} For \"Hume shared the&nbsp;... Tory belief that the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] were no more high-handed than their Tudor predecessors\".{{sfn|Okie|1985|p=25}} \"Even though Hume wrote with an anti-Whig animus, it is, paradoxically, correct to regard the ''History'' as an establishment work, one which implicitly endorsed the ruling oligarchy\".{{sfn|Okie|1985|p=27}}\nHistorians have debated whether Hume posited a universal unchanging human nature, or allowed for evolution and development.{{sfn|Wertz|1975|p=?}}\n\nRobert Roth argues that Hume's histories display his biases against [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]s and [[Puritan]]s. Roth says his anti-Whig pro-monarchy position diminished the influence of his work, and that his emphasis on politics and religion led to a neglect of social and economic history.{{sfn|Roth|1991|p=?}}\n\nHume was an early cultural [[history of science|historian of science]]. His short biographies of leading scientists explored the process of scientific change. He developed new ways of seeing scientists in the context of their times by looking at how they interacted with society and each other. He covers over forty scientists, with special attention paid to [[Francis Bacon]], [[Robert Boyle]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. Hume particularly praised [[William Harvey]], writing about his treatise of the circulation of the blood: \"Harvey is entitled to the glory of having made, by reasoning alone, without any mixture of accident, a capital discovery in one of the most important branches of science\".{{sfn|Wertz|1993|p=?}}\n\nThe ''History'' became a best-seller and made Hume a wealthy man who no longer had to take up salaried work for others.{{sfn|Morris|Brown|2011|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/hume/#LifWor Chapter Life and Works]}} It was influential for nearly a century, despite competition from imitations by [[Tobias Smollett|Smollett]] (1757), [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith]] (1771) and others. By 1894, there were at least 50 editions as well as abridgements for students, and illustrated pocket editions, probably produced specifically for women.{{sfn|Phillipson|2012|p=131}}\n\n===Political theory===\n{{Utilitarianism}}\nIt is difficult to categorise Hume's political affiliations. His writings contain elements that are, in modern terms, both conservative and liberal,{{sfn|Dees|2010|p=403}} although these terms are anachronistic. [[Thomas Jefferson]] banned the ''History'' from [[University of Virginia]], feeling that it had \"spread universal toryism over the land\".<ref>so quoted in {{harvtxt|Livingston|1965}}</ref> By comparison, [[Samuel Johnson]] thought Hume \"a Tory by chance&nbsp;... for he has no principle. If he is anything, he is a Hobbist\", a follower of [[Thomas Hobbes]].{{sfn|Hume|1888|loc=note 13 to letter LXXXIV}} A major concern of Hume's political philosophy is the importance of the rule of law. He also stresses throughout his political essays the importance of moderation in politics: public spirit and regard to the community.{{sfn|Forbes|1985|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PX86AAAAIAAJ&dq=politics+moderation+hume&q=politics+moderation+hume+detested#v=snippet&q=politics%20moderation%20hume%20detested&f=false p. 150]}}\n\nThis outlook needs to be seen within the historical context of 18th-century Scotland. Here, the legacy of religious civil war, combined with the relatively recent memory of the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings, fostered in a historian such as Hume a distaste for enthusiasm and factionalism. These appeared to threaten the fragile and nascent political and social stability of a country that was deeply politically and religiously divided.{{sfn|Wiley|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q94tuawjdYUC&pg=PA211&dq=hume+enthusiasm&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r6vjU73yDKbD7AaP54GYAQ&ved=0CDwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=hume%20enthusiasm&f=false p. 211]}}{{failed verification|date=August 2015}} Hume thought that society is best governed by a general and impartial system of laws; he is less concerned about the form of government that administers these laws, so long as it does so fairly. However, he does write that a republic must produce laws, while \"monarchy, when absolute, contains even something repugnant to law.\"{{sfn|Hume|1741|p=119}}\n\nHume expressed suspicion of attempts to reform society in ways that departed from long-established custom, and he counselled peoples not to resist their governments except in cases of the most egregious tyranny.{{sfn|Hume|1739|p=550}} However, he resisted aligning himself with either of Britain's two political parties, the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and the [[Tory|Tories]]. Hume wrote:\n\n<blockquote>My views of ''things'' are more conformable to Whig principles; my representations of ''persons'' to Tory prejudices.<ref>so quoted in {{harvtxt|Mossner|1980|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7HXJAqqNl4QC&q=whig#v=snippet&q=whig&f=false p. 311]}}, original emphasis</ref></blockquote>\n\nCanadian philosopher Neil McArthur writes that Hume believed that we should try to balance our demands for liberty with the need for strong authority, without sacrificing either. McArthur characterises Hume as a \"precautionary conservative\",{{sfn|McArthur|2007|p=124}} whose actions would have been \"determined by prudential concerns about the consequences of change, which often demand we ignore our own principles about what is ideal or even legitimate.\"{{sfn|McArthur|2007}}{{failed verification|date=October 2015}} Hume supported the [[freedom of the press|liberty of the press]], and was sympathetic to democracy, when suitably constrained. American historian [[Douglass Adair]] has argued that Hume was a major inspiration for [[James Madison]]'s writings, and the essay \"[[Federalist No. 10]]\" in particular.{{sfn|Adair|1957|p=?}}\n\nHume offered his view on the best type of society in an essay titled \"Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth\", which lays out what he thought was the best form of government. He hoped that, \"in some future age, an opportunity might be afforded of reducing the theory to practice, either by a dissolution of some old government, or by the combination of men to form a new one, in some distant part of the world\". He defended a strict [[separation of powers]], [[decentralization|decentralisation]], extending the [[Suffrage|franchise]] to anyone who held property of value and limiting the power of the clergy. The system of the [[military of Switzerland|Swiss militia]] was proposed as the best form of protection. Elections were to take place on an annual basis and representatives were to be unpaid.{{sfn|Hume|1987}} Political philosophers [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Joseph Cropsey]], writing of Hume's thoughts about \"the wise statesman\", note that he \"will bear a reverence to what carries the marks of age\". Also, if he wishes to improve a constitution, his innovations will take account of the \"ancient fabric\", in order not to disturb society.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7mScxst9UoC&dq=History+of+Political+Philosophy&q=%22limits+of+human+foresight%22#v=snippet&q=%22limits%20of%20human%20foresight%22&f=false |title=Strauss, L. and Cropsey, J., '&#39;History of Political Philosophy'&#39;, University of Chicago Press, 2012, p. 556 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2012-06-15 |accessdate=16 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the political analysis of philosopher [[George Holland Sabine|George Sabine]], the scepticism of Hume extended to the doctrine of [[consent of the governed|government by consent]]. He notes that \"allegiance is a habit enforced by education and consequently as much a part of human nature as any other motive.\"<ref>[[George Sabine|Sabine, GH.]], ''A History of Political Theory'', Dryden Press, 1973 (1937), p. 603.</ref>\n\nIn the 1770s, Hume was critical of British policies toward the American colonies and advocated for American independence.

In his autobiography, ''Unended Quest'', he wrote: \"Knowledge&nbsp;... is ''objective''; and it is hypothetical or conjectural.

From north to south, they are [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]], [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]], and [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]]. While the southern two counties have historically been predominantly agricultural, New Castle County is more industrialized.\n\nBefore its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century, Delaware was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans, including the [[Lenape]] in the north and [[Nanticoke Indian Tribe|Nanticoke]] in the south. It was initially colonized by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] traders at [[Zwaanendael Colony|Zwaanendael]], near the present town of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]], in 1631.<ref>{{cite book|title=Narratives of Early Pennsylvania, West New Jersey and Delaware, 1630\u20131707, Volume 13|author=Myers, Albert Cook|publisher=C.

On December&nbsp;7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]], and has since been known as \"The First State\".<ref>\"The First to Ratify\" would be more accurate, as the beginnings of the states themselves date back to the Declaration of Independence, celebrated July 4, 1776, when what was to become the State of Delaware was still the three lower counties of Pennsylvania with the governor in Philadelphia, and not establishing independence from that body until [[Delaware Constitution of 1776#Background|September 20, 1776]]. According to Delaware's own website, \"Delaware became a state in 1776, just two months after the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\" (ref-[http://delaware.gov/facts/DelawareFactsandSymbols.pdf pdf])  Therefore Delaware was actually the ''last'' of the thirteen colonies to establish itself as a state. Additionally, the [[50 State Quarters#Designs|Delaware State Quarter]] is minted with this nickname, yet shows [[Caesar Rodney#American Revolution|Caesar Rodney]] on horseback in commemoration of how he was the ''last'' delegate to show up to the Continental Congress for the historic vote for independence. And with regard to the original Articles of Confederation, Delaware was the [[Articles of Confederation#Ratification|12th of the 13 states to ratify]].</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe state was named after the [[Delaware River#Origin of the name|Delaware River]], which in turn derived its name from [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]] (1577\u20131618) who was the ruling governor of the [[Colony of Virginia]] at the time Europeans first explored the river. The [[Delaware Indians]], a name used by [[Europeans]] for [[Lenape]] people indigenous to the Delaware Valley, also derive their name from the same source.\n\nThe surname ''de La Warr'' comes from [[Sussex]] and is of [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] origin.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ware DeGidio |first=Wanda |year=2011 |title=Ware Family History: Descendants from Ancient, Medieval, and Modern Kings and Queens, and Presidents of the United States |editor-first=Wanda |editor-last=Ware DeGidio |location= |edition=|volume= |page=10 |ref= |isbn=978-1-4010-9930-5 }}</ref> It came probably from a Norman [[lieu-dit]] ''La Guerre''. This [[toponymic]] could derive from the Latin word ''[[wikt:ager#Latin|ager]]'', from the Breton ''[[wikt:gwern#Breton|gwern]]'' or from the [[Late Latin]] ''varectum'' ([[fallow]]). The toponyms Gara, Gare, Gaire (the sound [[Open central unrounded vowel|[\u00e4]]] often mutated in [[Near-open front unrounded vowel|[\u00e6]]]) also appear in old texts cited by [[Lucien Musset]], where the word ''ga(i)ra'' means [[Gore (road)|gore]]. It could also be linked with a [[patronymic]] from the Old Norse ''[[wikt:verr#Old Norse|verr]]''.\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Twelve-Mile Circle|Wedge (border)|Mason\u2013Dixon Line|Transpeninsular Line}}\n{{See also|#Counties|l1=\"Counties\" section below}}[[File:National-atlas-delaware.png|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Map of Delaware]]\n[[File:Twelve-mile-circle.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|right|The Twelve-Mile Circle]]\n[[File:Delaware-wedge.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of the Twelve-Mile Circle, the Mason\u2013Dixon line and \"[[The Wedge (border)|The Wedge]]\".

Delaware is bounded to the north by [[Pennsylvania]]; to the east by the [[Delaware River]], [[Delaware Bay]], [[New Jersey]] and the Atlantic Ocean; and to the west and south by [[Maryland]]. Small portions of Delaware are also situated on the eastern side of the Delaware River sharing land boundaries with New Jersey. The state of Delaware, together with the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore counties of Maryland]] and [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|two counties of Virginia]], form the [[Delmarva Peninsula]], which stretches down the Mid-Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe definition of the northern boundary of the state is unusual. Most of the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania was originally defined by an arc extending {{convert|12|mi|km|sigfig=3}} from the [[cupola]] of the courthouse in the city of [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]].{{citation needed|reason=Need supporting reference for this claim|date=March 2016}} This boundary is often referred to as the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]].{{Efn | Because of surveying errors, the actual line is several compound arcs with centers at different points in New Castle.}}  This is the only nominally circular state boundary in the United States.{{citation needed|reason=Need supporting reference for this claim|date=March 2016}}\n\nThis border extends all the way east to the low-tide mark on the New Jersey shore, then continues south along the shoreline until it again reaches the {{convert|12|mi|adj=on}} arc in the south; then the boundary continues in a more conventional way in the middle of the main channel ([[thalweg]]) of the Delaware River. To the west, a portion of the arc extends past the easternmost edge of Maryland. The remaining western border runs slightly east of due south from its intersection with the arc. [[The Wedge (border)|The Wedge]] of land between the northwest part of the arc and the Maryland border was claimed by both Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921, when Delaware's claim was confirmed.\n\n===Topography===\nDelaware is on a level plain, with the lowest mean elevation of any state in the nation.<ref name=census>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/04statab/geo.pdf|format=PDF|page=216|title=Extreme and Mean Elevations by State and Other Area|website=Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2004\u20132005| publisher=United States Census Bureau| accessdate=March 16, 2011}}</ref> Its highest elevation, located at [[Ebright Azimuth]], near [[Concord High School (Wilmington, Delaware)|Concord High School]], is less than {{convert|450|ft}} above sea level.<ref name=census/> The northernmost part of the state is part of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Plateau]] with hills and rolling surfaces. The [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]] approximately follows the [[Delaware Route 2|Robert Kirkwood Highway]] between [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]; south of this road is the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]] with flat, sandy, and, in some parts, swampy ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dgs.udel.edu/delaware-geology/summary-geologic-history-delaware|title=A Summary of the Geologic History of Delaware|publisher= The Delaware Geological Survey}}</ref> A ridge about {{convert|75|to|80|ft}} in elevation extends along the western boundary of the state and separates the [[drainage basin|watershed]]s that feed Delaware River and Bay to the east and the [[Chesapeake Bay]] to the west.\n\n===Climate===\nSince almost all of Delaware is a part of the [[Atlantic coastal plain]], the effects of the ocean moderate its climate. The state lies in the [[humid subtropical climate]] zone. Despite its small size (roughly {{convert|100|mi|km}} from its northernmost to southernmost points), there is significant variation in mean temperature and amount of snowfall between Sussex County and New Castle County. Moderated  by the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay, the southern portion of the state has a milder climate and a longer growing season than the northern portion of the state. Delaware's all-time record high of {{convert|110|F|C}} was recorded at [[Millsboro, Delaware|Millsboro]] on July 21, 1930. The all-time record low of {{convert|-17|F|C}} was also recorded at Millsboro on January 17, 1893.\n\n===Environment===\nThe transitional climate of Delaware supports a wide variety of vegetation. In the northern third of the state are found [[Northeastern coastal forests]] and mixed [[Quercus|oak]] forests typical of the northeastern United States.<ref name=\"ecoregions\">{{cite journal|author=Olson |title=Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World: A New Map of Life on Earth |journal=[[BioScience]] |year=2001 |volume=51 |issue=11 |pages=933\u2013938 |url=http://gis.wwfus.org/wildfinder/ |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0933:TEOTWA]2.0.CO;2 |author2=D.

John Smith also shows two Iroquoian tribes, the Kuskarawock & [[Tockwogh]], living north of the Nanticoke & they may have held small portions of land in the western part of the state before migrating across the Chesapeake Bay.<ref>http://www.sonofthesouth.net/revolutionary-war/maps/captain-smith-virginia-map.jpg</ref> The Kuskarawocks were most likely the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]].\n\nThe Unami Lenape in the Delaware Valley were closely related to [[Munsee]] Lenape tribes along the [[Hudson River]]. They had a settled hunting and agricultural society, and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy, the Minqua or [[Susquehannock]]. With the loss of their lands on the Delaware River and the destruction of the Minqua by the [[Iroquois]] of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the [[Alleghany Mountains]] by the mid-18th century. Generally, those who did not relocate out of the state of Delaware were baptized, became Christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their non-Native American neighbors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Colonial Delaware===\n[[File:NouvSuede.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|New Sweden \u2013 encounter between Swedish colonists and the natives of Delaware.]]\nThe [[Dutch people|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle in present-day Delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at [[Zwaanendael, Delaware|Zwaanendael]], near the site of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]] in 1631. Within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with [[Native Americans in the United States|area Native American tribes]]. In 1638 [[New Sweden]], a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] trading post and colony, was established at [[Fort Christina]] (now in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]) by [[Peter Minuit]] at the head of a group of Swedes, [[Finnish people|Finns]] and Dutch. The colony of New Sweden lasted for 17 years. In 1651 the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of [[Peter Stuyvesant]], established a fort at present-day [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]], and in 1655 they conquered the New Sweden colony, annexing it into the Dutch [[New Netherland]].<ref name=hod>{{cite book|title=History of Delaware|first =John A |last = Munroe|edition = 5th, illustrated|publisher= University of Delaware Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-87413-947-1|page=45|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vs7NcOKnlNUC&lpg=PA45&dq=%22Lower%20counties%22%20%22on%20the%20delaware%22&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q=%22Lower%20counties%22%20%22on%20the%20delaware%22&f=false | chapter = 3.

Fighting off a prior claim by [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]], [[Province of Maryland|Proprietor of Maryland]], the Duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to [[William Penn]] in 1682. Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania province]] and leased what then came to be known as the \"Lower Counties on the Delaware\"<ref name = hod /> from the Duke.\n\nPenn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one General Assembly in 1682. However, by 1704 the Province of Pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the Lower Counties and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own, one at [[Philadelphia]], and the other at New Castle. Penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person Governor for their Province of Pennsylvania and their territory of the Lower Counties. The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique. From 1703 to 1738 New York and New Jersey shared a governor.<ref>{{Citation |last = Lurie |first = Mappen M |title = Encyclopedia of New Jersey |publisher = Rutgers University Press |year = 2004 |isbn = 978-0-8135-3325-4 |page = 327}}</ref> Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for some time.<ref>{{Citation |last = Mayo |first = LS |title = John Wentworth, Governor of New Hampshire: 1767\u20131775 |publisher = Harvard University Press |year = 1921 |page = 5}}</ref>\n\nDependent in early years on indentured labor, Delaware imported more slaves as the number of English [[immigrants]] decreased with better economic conditions in England. The colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop, although English immigrants continued to arrive.\n\n===American Revolution===\nLike the other middle colonies, the Lower Counties on the Delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]. The citizenry had a good relationship with the Proprietary government, and generally were allowed more independence of action in their Colonial Assembly than in other colonies. Merchants at the port of Wilmington had trading ties with the British.\n\nSo it was that New Castle lawyer [[Thomas McKean]] denounced the [[Stamp Act]] in the strongest terms, and Kent County native [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] became the \"Penman of the Revolution.\"  Anticipating the Declaration of Independence, [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] leaders Thomas McKean and [[Caesar Rodney]] convinced the Colonial Assembly to declare itself separated from British and Pennsylvania rule on June 15, 1776. The person best representing Delaware's majority, [[George Read (signer)|George Read]], could not bring himself to vote for a Declaration of Independence. Only the dramatic overnight ride of Caesar Rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast Delaware's vote for independence.\n\nInitially led by [[John Haslet]], Delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the [[Continental Army]], known as the \"Delaware Blues\" and nicknamed the \"[[Blue Hen Chicken|Blue Hen's Chicks]].\" In August 1777 [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|General Sir William Howe]] led a British army through Delaware on his way to a victory at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] and capture of the city of Philadelphia. The only real engagement on Delaware soil was the [[Battle of Cooch's Bridge]], fought on September 3, 1777, at [[Cooch's Bridge]] in New Castle County, although there was a [[Clow Rebellion|minor Loyalist rebellion]] in 1778.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Brandywine, Wilmington was occupied by the British, and [[Governor of Delaware|State President]] [[John McKinly]] was taken prisoner. The British remained in control of the Delaware River for much of the rest of the war, disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] portion of the population, particularly in Sussex County. Because the British promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them, escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines.<ref>{{Citation | first = Simon | last = Schama | author-link = Simon Schama | title = Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves, and the American Revolution | place = New York | publisher = Harper Collins | year = 2006| title-link = Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves, and the American Revolution }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[American Revolution]], statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central United States with equal representation for each state.\n\n===Slavery and race===\nMany colonial settlers came to Delaware from Maryland and Virginia, where the population had been increasing rapidly. The economies of these colonies were chiefly based on tobacco culture and were increasingly dependent on slave labor for its labor-intensive cultivation because of a decline in working class immigrants from England. Most of the English colonists had arrived as [[indentured servant]]s, under contracts to work as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage. In the early years the line between indentured servants and African [[slave]]s or laborers was fluid, and the working classes often lived closely together. \n\nMost of the free African-American families in Delaware before the Revolution had migrated from Maryland to find more affordable land. They were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between white servant women and enslaved, servant or free African or African-American men.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ | first = Paul | last = Heinegg | title = Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware | accessdate = February 15, 2008}}</ref> Under slavery law, children took the social status of their mothers, so children born to white women were free, regardless of their paternity, just as children born to enslaved women were born into slavery. As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England, more slaves were imported for labor and the caste lines hardened.\n\nBy the end of the colonial period, the number of enslaved people in Delaware began to decline. Shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming resulted in less need for slaves' labor. In addition local [[Methodist]]s and [[Quaker]]s encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the American Revolution, and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons. By 1810 three-quarters of all blacks in Delaware were free. When John Dickinson freed his slaves in 1777, he was Delaware's largest slave owner with 37 slaves. By 1860, the largest slaveholder owned 16 slaves.{{Sfn |Kolchin |1994 |pp = 78, 81\u201382}}\n\nAlthough attempts to abolish slavery failed by narrow margins in the legislature, in practical terms, the state had mostly ended the practice. By the [[United States Census, 1860|1860 census]] on the verge of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], 91.7% of the black population were free;{{Sfn |Kolchin |1994 |pp = 81\u201382}} 1,798 were slaves, as compared to 19,829 \"free colored persons\".<ref>{{Citation |url = http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |title = Historical Census Browser |contribution = 1860 Federal Census |publisher = University of Virginia Library |accessdate = November 30, 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141011024040/http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |archivedate = October 11, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAn independent black denomination was chartered in 1813 by freed slave [[Peter Spencer (religious leader)|Peter Spencer]] as the \"[[Spencer Churches|Union Church of Africans]]\".

While most Delaware citizens who fought in the war served in the regiments of the state, some served in companies on the Confederate side in [[Maryland Civil War Confederate units|Maryland]] and [[List of Virginia Civil War units|Virginia]] Regiments. Delaware is notable for being the only slave state from which no Confederate regiments or militia groups were assembled. Delaware essentially freed the few slaves that were still in bondage shortly after the Civil War, but rejected the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]], and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th]] Amendments to the Constitution; the 13th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1865, the 14th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1867, and the 15th Amendment was rejected on March 18, 1869. Delaware officially ratified the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments on February 12, 1901.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{see also|Largest municipalities in Delaware}}\n[[File:Delaware population map.png|thumb|right|Delaware population density map]]\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 59096\n|1800= 64273\n|1810= 72674\n|1820= 72749\n|1830= 76748\n|1840= 78085\n|1850= 91532\n|1860= 112216\n|1870= 125015\n|1880= 146608\n|1890= 168493\n|1900= 184735\n|1910= 202322\n|1920= 223003\n|1930= 238380\n|1940= 266505\n|1950= 318085\n|1960= 446292\n|1970= 548104\n|1980= 594338\n|1990= 666168\n|2000= 783600\n|2010= 897934\n|estimate= 961939\n|estyear= 2017\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=Source: 1910\u20132010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |title=Resident Population Data |year=2010 |publisher=Census |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019160532/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |archivedate=October 19, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref><br />2015 estimate<ref name=\"PopEstUS\"/>}}\n\nThe [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Delaware was 952,065 people on July 1, 2016, a 6.0% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]].<ref name=\"PopEstUS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2015/tables/NST-EST2015-01.csv |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223235718/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2015/tables/NST-EST2015-01.csv |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 23, 2015 |title=Table 1.

The state also operates two toll highways, the Delaware Turnpike, which is I-95, between Maryland and New Castle and the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, which is DE&nbsp;1, between Wilmington and Dover.\n\nA bicycle route, [[Delaware Bicycle Route&nbsp;1]], spans the north-south length of the state from the Maryland border in [[Fenwick Island, Delaware|Fenwick Island]] to the Pennsylvania border north of [[Montchanin, Delaware|Montchanin]].

About 30 percent of all Delaware bridges were built before 1950, and about 60 percent of the number are included in the [[National Bridge Inventory]]. Some bridges not under DelDOT supervision includes the four bridges on the [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]], which are under the jurisdiction of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], and the [[Delaware Memorial Bridge]], which is under the bi-state [[Delaware River and Bay Authority]].\n\nIt has been noted that the [[tar and chip]] composition of secondary roads in Sussex County make them more prone to [[Road surface#Surface deterioration|deterioration]] than [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]] roadways found in almost the rest of the state.<ref name=nj20110417>{{cite news |location=Wilmington, Delaware |title=Anything Once: On the road, taking plenty of pot shots |author=Justin Williams |url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110417/NEWS02/304170008/-1/NLETTER01/On-the-road--taking-plenty-of-pot-shots |newspaper=News Journal |publisher=Gannett |date=April 17, 2011 |at=DelawareOnline |accessdate=April 17, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Among these roads, Sussex (county road) 236 is among the most problematic.<ref name=nj20110417/>\n\n===Ferries===\n[[File:MVDelaware.jpg|thumb|right|Cape May\u2013Lewes Ferry]]\nThere are three ferries that operate in the state of Delaware:\n* [[Cape May\u2013Lewes Ferry]] crosses the mouth of the Delaware Bay between Lewes, Delaware and [[Cape May, New Jersey]].\n* [[Woodland Ferry]] is a cable ferry that crosses the [[Nanticoke River]] southwest of [[Seaford, Delaware|Seaford]].\n* [[Forts Ferry Crossing]] connects [[Delaware City]] with [[Fort Delaware]] and [[Fort Mott (New Jersey)|Fort Mott]], New Jersey\n\n===Rail and bus===\n[[File:Wilmington Station from parking garage, July 2014.JPG|thumb|left|Wilmington Station]]\n[[Amtrak]] has two stations in Delaware along the [[Northeast Corridor]]; the relatively quiet [[Newark Rail Station (Delaware)|Newark Rail Station]] in Newark, and the busier [[Wilmington station (Delaware)|Wilmington Rail Station]] in Wilmington. The Northeast Corridor is also served by [[SEPTA]]'s [[Wilmington/Newark Line]] of [[SEPTA Regional Rail|Regional Rail]], which serves [[Claymont, Delaware|Claymont]], Wilmington, [[Churchmans Crossing, Delaware|Churchmans Crossing]], and Newark.\n\nTwo [[Class I railroad]]s, [[Norfolk Southern]] and [[CSX]], provide freight rail service in northern New Castle County. Norfolk Southern provides freight service along the Northeast Corridor and to industrial areas in [[Edgemoor, Delaware|Edgemoor]], [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]], and [[Delaware City, Delaware|Delaware City]]. CSX's [[Philadelphia Subdivision]] passes through northern New Castle County parallel to the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. Multiple [[short-line railroad]]s provide freight service in Delaware. The [[Delmarva Central Railroad]] operates the most trackage of the short-line railroads, running from an interchange with Norfolk Southern in [[Porter, Delaware|Porter]] south through [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]], [[Harrington, Delaware|Harrington]], and [[Seaford, Delaware|Seaford]] to [[Delmar, Delaware|Delmar]], with another line running from Harrington to [[Frankford, Delaware|Frankford]].

Coverage of the system is broad within northern New Castle County with close association to major highways in Kent and Sussex counties. The system includes bus, subsidized passenger rail operated by Philadelphia transit agency SEPTA, and subsidized taxi and [[paratransit]] modes. The paratransit system, consisting of a statewide door-to-door bus service for the elderly and disabled, has been described by a Delaware state report as \"the most generous paratransit system in the United States.\"<ref name=montgomery2012nj/> {{As of|2012}}, fees for the paratransit service have not changed since 1988.<ref name=montgomery2012nj/>\n\n===Air===\n{{see also|Aviation in Delaware}}\n{{As of|2016}}, there is no scheduled air service from any Delaware airport, as has been the case in various years since 1991.

Therefore, Delaware [[commercial airline]] passengers most frequently use [[Philadelphia International Airport]] (PHL), [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport]] (BWI) and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] (IAD) for domestic and international transit. Residents of Sussex County will also use [[Wicomico Regional Airport]] (SBY), as it is located less than {{convert|10|mi|km}} from the Delaware border. [[Atlantic City International Airport]] (ACY),  [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] (EWR), and [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] (DCA) are also within a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of New Castle County.\n\nThe [[Dover Air Force Base]] of the Air Mobility Command is in the central part of the state, and it is the home of the [[436th Airlift Wing]] and the [[512th Airlift Wing]].\n\nOther general aviation airports in Delaware include [[Summit Airport (Delaware)|Summit Airport]] near [[Middletown, Delaware|Middletown]], [[Delaware Airpark]] near [[Cheswold, Delaware|Cheswold]], and [[Delaware Coastal Airport]] near [[Georgetown, Delaware|Georgetown]].\n\n==Law and government==\nDelaware's fourth and current constitution, adopted in 1897, provides for executive, judicial and legislative branches.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Delaware Constitution of 1897 as amended|url=http://delcode.delaware.gov/constitution/|website=State of Delaware|accessdate=22 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Legislative branch===\n[[File:Delaware State Capitol.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Delaware General Assembly]] meets in the [[Delaware State Capitol|Legislative Hall]] in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]].]]\nThe [[Delaware General Assembly]] consists of a [[Delaware House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] with 41 members and a [[Delaware Senate|Senate]] with 21 members. It sits in Dover, the state capital. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, while senators are elected to four-year terms. The Senate confirms judicial and other nominees appointed by the governor.\n\nDelaware's U.S. Senators are [[Tom Carper]] (Democrat) and [[Chris Coons]] (Democrat). Delaware's single U.S. Representative is [[Lisa Blunt Rochester]] (Democrat).\n\n===Judicial branch===\nThe Delaware Constitution establishes a number of courts:\n* The [[Delaware Supreme Court]] is the state's highest court.\n* The [[Delaware Superior Court]] is the state's trial court of general jurisdiction.\n* The [[Delaware Court of Chancery]] deals primarily in corporate disputes.\n* The Family Court handles domestic and custody matters.\n* The [[Delaware Court of Common Pleas]] has jurisdiction over a limited class of civil and criminal matters.\n\nMinor non-constitutional courts include the [[Justice of the Peace]] Courts and Aldermen's Courts.\n\nSignificantly, Delaware has one of the few remaining Courts of [[Court of equity|Chancery]] in the nation, which has jurisdiction over [[Equity (law)|equity]] cases, the vast majority of which are corporate disputes, many relating to [[mergers and acquisitions]]. The [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]] and the Delaware Supreme Court have developed a worldwide reputation for rendering concise opinions concerning [[corporate law]] which generally (but not always) grant broad discretion to corporate boards of directors and officers. In addition, the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], which forms the basis of the Courts' opinions, is widely regarded as giving great flexibility to corporations to manage their affairs. For these reasons, Delaware is considered to have the most business-friendly legal system in the United States; therefore a great number of companies are [[incorporated in Delaware]], including 60% of the companies listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].<ref name=\"divcorpabout\">{{cite web|url= http://www.corp.delaware.gov/aboutagency.shtml |title= About Agency|accessdate= July 23, 2008 |publisher =Delaware Division of Corporations|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070228002805/http://www.state.de.us/corp/aboutagency.shtml |archivedate=February 28, 2007}}</ref> Delaware was the last U.S. state to use [[judicial corporal punishment]], in 1952.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pleck|first=Elizabeth Hefkin|title=Domestic tyranny: the making of American social policy against family|publisher=University of Illinois Press |year =2004|page=120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zN2A2shTz6YC&pg=PA120|isbn= 978-0-252-07175-1}}</ref>\n\n===Executive branch===\n{{See also|List of Governors of Delaware}}\nThe executive branch is headed by the [[Governor of Delaware]].

This is the fewest among all states. Each county elects its own legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as '''County Council''', and in Kent County as '''Levy Court'''), which deal primarily in zoning and development issues. Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states \u2013 such as court and law enforcement \u2013 have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government. The counties were historically divided into [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundreds]], which were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s, but now serve no administrative role, their only current official legal use being in real-estate title descriptions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.delaware.gov/museums/vc/vc_hundreds.shtml |title=The Hundreds of Delaware |website=Department of State: Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs |publisher=Delaware State Archives |accessdate=September 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617061234/http://history.delaware.gov/museums/vc/vc_hundreds.shtml |archivedate=June 17, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Politics===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:1em; font-size:95%;\"\n|+ Delaware vote|Gubernatorial election results<ref name=\"Leip, David\">{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|title=General Election Results \u2013 Delaware|publisher=[[Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections]]|accessdate=August 4, 2018|author=Leip, David}}</ref>\n|- style=\"background:lightgrey;\"\n!

Until the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], the state tended to be a Presidential [[bellwether]], sending its three [[electoral votes]] to the winning candidate since 1952. This trend ended in 2000 when Delaware's electoral votes went to [[Al Gore]] by 20-percentage points. In 2004, [[John Kerry]] won Delaware by eight-percentage points. In 2008, Democrat [[Barack Obama]] defeated Republican [[John McCain]] in Delaware by 25-percentage points. Obama's [[running mate]] was [[Joe Biden]], who had represented Delaware in the [[United States Senate]] since 1973. Obama carried Delaware by 19-percentage points in 2012. In 2016, Delaware's electoral votes went to [[Hillary Clinton]] by 11-percentage points.\n\nDelaware's swing to the Democrats is in part due to a strong Democratic trend in New Castle County, home to 55 percent of Delaware's population (the two smaller counties have only 359,000 people between them to New Castle's 535,000). New Castle has not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1988. In 1992, 2000, 2004, and 2016, the Republican presidential candidate carried both Kent and Sussex but lost by double-digits each time in New Castle, which was a large enough margin to swing the state to the Democrats. New Castle also elects a substantial majority of the legislature; 27 of the 41 state house districts and 14 of the 21 state senate districts are based in New Castle.\n\nThe Democrats have held the governorship since 1993, having won the last seven gubernatorial elections in a row. Democrats presently hold seven of the nine statewide elected offices, while the Republicans hold only two statewide offices, [[State Auditor]] and [[State Treasurer]].\n\n===Freedom of information===\n{{see also|Freedom of information in the United States#State legislation}}\nEach of the 50 states of the United States has passed some form of freedom of information legislation, which provides a mechanism for the general public to request information of the government.{{citation needed|date = April 2011}} In 2011 Delaware passed legislation placing a 15 business day time limit on addressing freedom-of-information requests, to either produce information or an explanation of why such information would take longer than this time to produce.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Bennett | first1 = Rep. | first2 = Sen. | last2 = Peterson | first3 = Sen. | last3 = Katz|date=January 6, 2011|publication-date=April 15, 2011|contribution= An Act to Amend Title 29 of the Delaware Code Relating to the Freedom of Information Act|accessdate=April 22, 2011 | contribution-url = http://legis.delaware.gov/lis/lis146.nsf/vwlegislation/HB+5| edition = online | title = Delaware Code | volume = 78| at = 10| id = House Bill # 5| url = http://legis.delaware.gov/LIS/lis146.nsf/vwLegislation/HB+5/}}</ref>\n\n===Government revenue===\nDelaware has six different [[income tax]] brackets, ranging from 2.2% to 5.95%. The state does not assess [[sales tax]] on consumers. The state does, however, impose a tax on the gross receipts of most businesses. Business and occupational license tax rates range from 0.096% to 1.92%, depending on the category of business activity.\n\nDelaware does not assess a state-level tax on real or personal property. Real estate is subject to county [[property tax]]es, school district property taxes, vocational school district taxes, and, if located within an incorporated area, municipal property taxes.\n\n[[Gambling in the United States#Authorized types|Gambling]] provides significant revenue to the state.

Specialized dictionaries include words in specialist fields, rather than a complete range of words in the language. Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually called terms instead of words, although there is no consensus whether [[lexicology]] and [[terminology]] are two different fields of study. In theory, general dictionaries are supposed{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} to be [[Semasiology|semasiological]], mapping word to [[definition]], while specialized dictionaries are supposed to be [[Onomasiology|onomasiological]], first identifying [[concept]]s and then establishing the terms used to designate them.

The ''[[Catholicon (1286)|Catholicon]]'' (1287) by [[John of Genoa|Johannes Balbus]], a large grammatical work with an alphabetical lexicon, was widely adopted. It served as the basis for several bilingual dictionaries and was one of the earliest books (in 1460) to be printed. In 1502 [[Ambrogio Calepino]]'s ''Dictionarium'' was published, originally a monolingual Latin dictionary, which over the course of the 16th century was enlarged to become a multilingual glossary. In 1532 [[Robert Estienne]] published the ''Thesaurus linguae latinae'' and in 1572 his son [[Henri Estienne]] published the ''[[Thesaurus linguae graecae]]'', which served up to the 19th century as the basis of Greek lexicography. The first monolingual dictionary written in Europe was the Spanish, written by [[Sebasti\u00e1n Covarrubias]]' ''[[Tesoro de la lengua castellana o espa\u00f1ola]]'', published in 1611 in Madrid, Spain.<ref>''Tesoro de la lengua castellana o espa\u00f1ola'', edici\u00f3n integral e ilustrada de Ignacio Arellano y Rafael Zafra, Madrid, Iberoamericana-Vervuert, 2006, pg.

It served as the model for similar works in French and English. In 1690 in [[Rotterdam]] was published, posthumously, the ''Dictionnaire Universel'' by [[Antoine Fureti\u00e8re]] for [[french language|French]]. In 1694 appeared the first edition of the ''[[Dictionnaire de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]]''. Between 1712 and 1721 was published the ''Vocabulario portughez e latino'' written by Raphael Bluteau. The [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]] published the first edition of the ''[[Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola]]'' in 1780, but their ''Diccionario de Autoridades'', which included quotes taken from literary works, was published in 1726. The ''Totius Latinitatis lexicon'' by [[Egidio Forcellini]] was firstly published in 1777; it has formed the basis of all similar works that have since been published.\n\nThe first edition of ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' by [[Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] appeared in 1843; this work remained the basic dictionary of Greek until the end of the 20th century. And in 1858 was published the first volume of the [[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]] by the [[Brothers Grimm]]; the work was completed in 1961. Between 1861 and 1874 was published the ''Dizionario della lingua italiana'' by [[Niccol\u00f2 Tommaseo]].

[[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield]] was still lamenting in 1754, 150 years after Cawdrey's publication, that it is \"a sort of disgrace to our nation, that hitherto we have had no\u2026 standard of our language; our dictionaries at present being more properly what our neighbors the Dutch and the Germans call theirs, word-books, than dictionaries in the superior sense of that title.\" <ref>[http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Papers/firstdict.html Jack Lynch, \u201cHow Johnson's Dictionary Became the First Dictionary\u201d (delivered 25 August 2005 at the Johnson and the English Language conference, Birmingham)] Retrieved July 12, 2008,</ref>\n\nIn 1616, John Bullokar described the history of the dictionary with his \"English Expositor\".

Johnson's masterwork could be judged as the first to bring all these elements together, creating the first \"modern\" dictionary.<ref name = \"wblqfm\"/>\n\nJohnson's dictionary remained the English-language standard for over 150 years, until the [[Oxford University Press]] began writing and releasing the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in short [[wikt:fascicle|fascicles]] from 1884 onwards. It took nearly 50 years to complete this huge work, and they finally released the complete ''OED'' in twelve volumes in 1928. It remains the most comprehensive and trusted English language dictionary to this day, with revisions and updates added by a dedicated team every three months. One of the main contributors to this modern dictionary was an ex-army surgeon, [[William Chester Minor]], a convicted murderer who was confined to an asylum for the criminally insane.<ref>[[Simon Winchester]], ''[[The Surgeon of Crowthorne]]''.</ref>\n\n===American English dictionaries===\nIn 1806, American [[Noah Webster]] published his first dictionary, ''[[s:A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language|A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language]]''. In 1807 Webster began compiling an expanded and fully comprehensive dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language;'' it took twenty-seven years to complete. To evaluate the etymology of words, Webster learned twenty-six languages, including [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon), German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Arabic, and [[Sanskrit]].\n\nWebster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in 1825 in Paris, France, and at the [[University of Cambridge]]. His book contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before. As a [[spelling reform]]er, Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, so his dictionary introduced [[American English]] spellings, replacing \"colour\" with \"color\", substituting \"wagon\" for \"waggon\", and printing \"center\" instead of \"centre\". He also added American words, like \"skunk\" and \"squash\", that did not appear in British dictionaries. At the age of seventy, Webster published his dictionary in 1828; it sold 2500 copies. In 1840, the second edition was published in two volumes.\n\n==Types==\n\nIn a general dictionary, each word may have multiple meanings. Some dictionaries include each separate meaning in the order of most common usage while others list definitions in historical order, with the oldest usage first.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ld/pubs/corereference/internal/chd.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425064041/http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ld/pubs/corereference/internal/chd.html |archivedate=2010-04-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn many languages, words can appear in many different forms, but only the [[lemma (morphology)|undeclined or unconjugated]] form appears as the [[headword]] in most dictionaries. Dictionaries are most commonly found in the form of a book, but some newer dictionaries, like [[StarDict]] and the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' are dictionary software running on [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDAs]] or [[computer]]s. There are also many [[List of online dictionaries|online dictionaries]] accessible via the [[Internet]].\n\n===Specialized dictionaries===\n{{main|Specialized dictionary}}\nAccording to the ''Manual of Specialized Lexicographies'', a [[specialized dictionary]], also referred to as a technical dictionary, is a dictionary that focuses upon a specific subject field. Following the description in ''The Bilingual LSP Dictionary'', [[lexicographers]] categorize specialized dictionaries into three types: A [[multi-field dictionary]] broadly covers several subject fields (e.g. a [[business dictionary]]), a [[single-field dictionary]] narrowly covers one particular subject field (e.g. law), and a [[sub-field dictionary]] covers a more specialized field (e.g. constitutional law). For example, the 23-language [[Inter-Active Terminology for Europe]] is a multi-field dictionary, the [[American National Biography]] is a single-field, and the [[African American National Biography Project]] is a sub-field dictionary. In terms of the coverage distinction between \"minimizing dictionaries\" and \"maximizing dictionaries\", multi-field dictionaries tend to minimize coverage across subject fields (for instance, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of World Religions]]'' and ''[[Yadgar Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms]]'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesindhtimes.com/education/the-first-english-to-einglis-and-sindh-dictionary-of-computer-and-internet-terms-published/|title=The first English to Einglish and Sindhi Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms published - The Sindh Times|first=The Sindh|last=Times|date=24 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011021439/http://www.thesindhtimes.com/education/the-first-english-to-einglis-and-sindh-dictionary-of-computer-and-internet-terms-published/|archive-date=11 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> whereas single-field and sub-field dictionaries tend to maximize coverage within a limited subject field (''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'').\n\nAnother variant is the [[glossary]], an alphabetical list of defined terms in a specialized field, such as medicine ([[medical dictionary]]).\n\n===Defining dictionaries===\nThe simplest dictionary, a [[defining dictionary]], provides a [[core glossary]] of the simplest meanings of the simplest concepts. From these, other concepts can be explained and defined, in particular for those who are first learning a language. In English, the commercial defining dictionaries typically include only one or two meanings of under 2000 words. With these, the rest of English, and even the 4000 most common English [[idiom]]s and [[metaphor]]s, can be defined.\n\n===Prescriptive vs. descriptive===\nLexicographers apply two basic philosophies to the defining of words: [[Prescription and description|''prescriptive'' or ''descriptive'']]. [[Noah Webster]], intent on forging a distinct identity for the American language, altered spellings and accentuated differences in meaning and pronunciation of some words. This is why [[American English]] now uses the spelling ''color'' while the rest of the English-speaking world prefers ''colour''. (Similarly, [[British English]] subsequently underwent a few spelling changes that did not affect American English; see further at [[American and British English spelling differences]].)<ref name=\"Benson2002\">{{cite book|author=Phil Benson|title=Ethnocentrism and the English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WeuW7oy7-58C&pg=PA8|year=2002|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=8\u201311}}</ref>\n\nLarge 20th-century dictionaries such as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) and ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary|Webster's Third]]'' are descriptive, and attempt to describe the actual use of words. Most dictionaries of English now apply the descriptive method to a word's definition, and then, outside of the definition itself, and information alerting readers to attitudes which may influence their choices on words often considered vulgar, offensive, erroneous, or easily confused.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ingrid Tieken-Boon van Ostade|author2=Wim van der Wurff|title=Current Issues in Late Modern English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x91EUnnWwR8C&pg=PA41|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|pages=41\u201342}}</ref> ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' is subtle, only adding italicized notations such as, ''sometimes offensive'' or ''stand'' (nonstandard). ''[[American Heritage Dictionary|American Heritage]]'' goes further, discussing issues separately in numerous \"usage notes.\" ''[[Encarta Webster's Dictionary|Encarta]]'' provides similar notes, but is more prescriptive, offering warnings and admonitions against the use of certain words considered by many to be offensive or illiterate, such as, \"an offensive term for...\" or \"a taboo term meaning...\".\n\nBecause of the widespread use of dictionaries in schools, and their acceptance by many as language authorities, their treatment of the language does affect usage to some degree, with even the most descriptive dictionaries providing conservative continuity. In the long run, however, the meanings of words in English are primarily determined by usage, and the language is being changed and created every day.<ref>Ned Halley, ''The Wordsworth Dictionary of Modern English Grammar'' (2005), p. 84</ref> As [[Jorge Luis Borges]] says in the prologue to \"El otro, el mismo\": \"''It is often forgotten that (dictionaries) are artificial repositories, put together well after the languages they define. The roots of language are irrational and of a magical nature.''\"\n\nSometimes the same dictionary can be descriptive in some domains and prescriptive in others. For example, according to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], the ''Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary'' is \"at war with itself\": whereas its coverage (lexical items) and glosses (definitions) are descriptive and colloquial, its [[Niqqud|vocalization]] is prescriptive. This internal conflict results in absurd sentences such as ''hi tahar\u00f3g ot\u00ed kshetir\u00e9 me as\u00edti lamkhon\u00edt'' (she'll tear me apart when she sees what I've done to the car). Whereas ''hi tahar\u00f3g ot\u00ed'', literally 'she will kill me', is colloquial, me (a variant of ma 'what') is archaic, resulting in a combination that is unutterable in real life.<ref>[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (1999). [http://www.professorzuckermann.com/review-of-the-oxford-english-hebrew- Review of the Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary], ''[[International Journal of Lexicography]]'' 12.4, pp. 325-346.</ref>\n\n=== Historical dictionaries ===\nA [[historical dictionary]] is a specific kind of descriptive dictionary which describes the development of words and senses over time, usually using citations to original source material to support its conclusions.\n\n===Dictionaries for natural language processing===\nIn contrast to traditional dictionaries, which are designed to be used by human beings, dictionaries for [[natural language processing]] (NLP) are built to be used by computer programs. The final user is a human being but the direct user is a program. Such a dictionary does not need to be able to be printed on paper. The structure of the content is not linear, ordered entry by entry but has the form of a complex network (see [[Diathesis alternation]]). Because most of these dictionaries are used to control [[machine translation]]s or [[cross-lingual information retrieval]] (CLIR) the content is usually multilingual and usually of huge size. In order to allow formalized exchange and merging of dictionaries, an ISO standard called [[Lexical Markup Framework]] (LMF) has been defined and used among the industrial and academic community.\n\n{{further|Machine-readable dictionary}}\n\n===Other types===\n\n* [[Bilingual dictionary]]\n* [[Collegiate dictionary]] (American) \n* [[Learner's dictionary]] (mostly British)\n* [[Electronic dictionary]]\n* [[Encyclopedic dictionary]]\n* [[Monolingual learner's dictionary]]\n** [[Advanced learner's dictionary]]\n* By sound\n** [[Rhyming dictionary]]\n* [[Reverse dictionary]] ([[Conceptual dictionary]])\n* [[Visual dictionary]]\n* [[The Devil's Dictionary|Satirical dictionary]]\n* [[Phonetic dictionary]]\n\n==Pronunciation==\n{{Main|International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects|Pronunciation respelling for English}}\nIn many languages, such as the English language, the pronunciation of some words is not consistently  apparent from their spelling. In these languages, dictionaries usually provide the pronunciation. For example, the definition for the word ''dictionary'' might be followed by the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] spelling {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d|\u026a|k|\u0283|\u0259|n|\u025br|i}}. American English dictionaries often use their own[[pronunciation respelling]] systems with [[diacritic]]s, for example ''dictionary''  is respelled as \"d\u012dk'''\u2032'''sh\u0259-n\u0115r\u2032\u0113\" in the [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]].{{refn|{{Cite American Heritage Dictionary|dictionary}}}} The IPA is more commonly used within the British Commonwealth countries. Yet others use their own pronunciation respelling systems without diacritics: for example, ''dictionary'' may be respelled as {{respell|DIK|sh\u0259|nerr|ee}}. Some online or electronic dictionaries provide audio recordings of words being spoken.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Major English dictionaries===\n<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

This differs from the version proposed by [[Murray Rothbard]], where a legal code would first be consented to by the parties involved in setting up the anarcho-capitalist society. Friedman advocates an incrementalist approach to achieve anarcho-capitalism by gradual [[privatization]] of areas that government is involved in, ultimately privatizing law and order itself. In the book, he states his opposition to violent [[anarcho-capitalist revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Machinery of Freedom|pages=149\u2013150|chapter=Revolution Is the Hell of It|author=Friedman, David D|isbn=0-8126-9069-9}}</ref>\n\nHe advocates a [[Consequentialist libertarianism|consequentialist]] version of anarcho-capitalism, arguing for anarchism on a [[cost-benefit analysis]] of state versus no state.<ref>Morris, Christopher. 1992.

As a consequence, confusion existed regarding atomic weights and molecular formulas for about half a century.\n\nAs early as 1805, [[Gay-Lussac]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt|von Humboldt]] showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen, and by 1811 [[Amedeo Avogadro]] had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called [[Avogadro's law]] and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules. However, these results were mostly ignored until 1860, partly due to the belief that atoms of one element would have no [[chemical affinity]] toward atoms of the same element, and also partly due to apparent exceptions to Avogadro's law that were not explained until later in terms of dissociating molecules.\n\nAt the 1860 [[Karlsruhe Congress]] on atomic weights, [[Cannizzaro]] resurrected Avogadro's ideas and used them to produce a consistent table of atomic weights, which mostly agree with modern values. These weights were an important prerequisite for the discovery of the [[periodic law]] by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] and [[Lothar Meyer]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Ihde, Aaron J. |title= The Karlsruhe Congress: A centennial retrospective |journal= Journal of Chemical Education |year= 1961 |volume= 38 |pages= 83\u201386 |url= http://search.jce.divched.org:8081/JCEIndex/FMPro?-db=jceindex.fp5&-lay=wwwform&combo=karlsruhe&-find=&-format=detail.html&-skip=0&-max=1&-token.2=0&-token.3=10 |accessdate=2007-08-24 |doi= 10.1021/ed038p83 |issue= 2 |bibcode= 1961JChEd..38...83I}}</ref>\n\n==Excited electronic states==\nDiatomic molecules are normally in their lowest or ground state, which conventionally is also known as the <math>X</math> state. When a gas of diatomic molecules is bombarded by energetic electrons, some of the molecules may be excited to higher electronic states, as occurs, for example, in the natural aurora; high-altitude nuclear explosions; and rocket-borne electron gun experiments.<ref name=gilmore1992/> Such excitation can also occur when the gas absorbs light or other electromagnetic radiation. The excited states are unstable and naturally relax back to the ground state. Over various short time scales after the excitation (typically a fraction of a second, or sometimes longer than a second if the excited state is [[metastability|metastable]]), transitions occur from higher to lower electronic states and ultimately to the ground state, and in each transition results a [[photon]] is emitted. This emission is known as [[fluorescence]]. Successively higher electronic states are conventionally named <math>A</math>, <math>B</math>, <math>C</math>, etc. (but this convention is not always followed, and sometimes lower case letters and alphabetically out-of-sequence letters are used, as in the example given below). The excitation energy must be greater than or equal to the energy of the electronic state in order for the excitation to occur.\n\nIn quantum theory, an electronic state of a diatomic molecule is represented by\n:<math>^{2S+1} \\Lambda (v)</math>\n\nwhere <math>S</math> is the total electronic spin quantum number, <math>\\Lambda</math> is the total electronic angular momentum quantum number along the internuclear axis, and <math>v</math> is the vibrational quantum number. <math>\\Lambda</math> takes on values 0, 1, 2, \u2026, which are represented by the electronic state symbols <math>\\Sigma</math>, <math>\\Pi</math>, <math>\\Delta</math>,\u2026.\nFor example, the following table lists the common electronic states (without vibrational quantum numbers) along with the energy of the lowest vibrational level (<math>v=0</math>) of diatomic nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere.<ref name=laher1991/> In the table, the subscripts and superscripts after <math>\\Lambda</math> give additional quantum mechanical details about the electronic state.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The actual energy can be found by multiplying the given statistic by the product of ''c'' (the speed of light) and ''h'' (Planck's constant), i.e., about 1.99 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221225</sup> Joule metres, and then multiplying by a further factor of 100 to convert from cm<sup>\u22121</sup> to m<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThe aforementioned [[fluorescence]] occurs in distinct regions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], called \"[[emission bands]]\": each band corresponds to a particular transition from a higher electronic state and vibrational level to a lower electronic state and vibrational level (typically, many vibrational levels are involved in an excited gas of diatomic molecules). For example, N<sub>2</sub> <math>A</math>-<math>X</math> emission bands (a.k.a. Vegard-Kaplan bands) are present in the spectral range from 0.14 to 1.45 \u03bcm (micrometres).<ref name=gilmore1992/> A given band can be spread out over several nanometers in electromagnetic wavelength space, owing to the various transitions that occur in the molecule's rotational quantum number, <math>J</math>. These are classified into distinct sub-band branches, depending on the change in <math>J</math>.<ref name=levine1975/> The <math>R</math> branch corresponds to <math>\\Delta J = +1</math>, the <math>P</math> branch to <math>\\Delta J = -1</math>, and the <math>Q</math> branch to <math>\\Delta J = 0</math>. Bands are spread out even further by the limited [[spectral resolution]] of the [[spectrometer]] that is used to measure the [[spectrum]]. The spectral resolution depends on the instrument's [[point spread function]].\n\n==Energy levels==\nThe [[molecular term symbol]] is a shorthand expression of the angular momenta that characterize the electronic quantum states of a diatomic molecule, which are [[eigenstate]]s of the electronic molecular [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. It is also convenient, and common, to represent a diatomic molecule as two point masses connected by a massless spring. The energies involved in the various motions of the molecule can then be broken down into three categories: the translational, rotational, and vibrational energies.\n\n===Translational energies===\nThe translational energy of the molecule is given by the [[kinetic energy]] expression:\n:<math>E_{trans}=\\frac{1}{2}mv^2</math>\n\nwhere <math>m</math> is the mass of the molecule and <math>v</math> is its velocity.\n\n===Rotational energies===\nClassically, the kinetic energy of rotation is\n::<math>E_{rot} = \\frac{L^2}{2 I} \\,</math>\n:where\n::<math>L \\,</math> is the [[angular momentum]]\n::<math>I \\,</math> is the [[moment of inertia]] of the molecule\n\nFor microscopic, atomic-level systems like a molecule, angular momentum can only have specific discrete values given by\n::<math>L^2 = l(l+1) \\hbar^2 \\,</math>\n:where <math>l</math> is a non-negative integer and <math>\\hbar</math> is the [[reduced Planck constant]].\n\nAlso, for a diatomic molecule the moment of inertia is\n::<math>I = \\mu r_{0}^2 \\,</math>\n:where\n::<math>\\mu \\,</math> is the [[reduced mass]] of the molecule and\n::<math>r_{0} \\,</math> is the average distance between the centers of the two atoms in the molecule.\n\nSo, substituting the angular momentum and moment of inertia into E<sub>rot</sub>, the rotational energy levels of a diatomic molecule are given by:\n::<math style>E_{rot} = \\frac{l(l+1) \\hbar^2}{2 \\mu r_{0}^2} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ l=0,1,2,... \\,</math>\n\n===Vibrational energies===\nAnother type of motion of a diatomic molecule is for each atom to oscillate\u2014or [[vibration|vibrate]]\u2014along the line connecting the two atoms. The vibrational energy is approximately that of a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]:\n\n::<math>E_{vib} = \\left(n+\\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\hbar \\omega \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ n=0,1,2,.... \\,</math>\n:where\n::<math>n</math> is an integer\n::<math>\\hbar</math> is the [[reduced Planck constant]] and\n::<math>\\omega</math> is the [[angular frequency]] of the vibration.\n\n===Comparison between rotational and vibrational energy spacings===\nThe spacing, and the energy of a typical spectroscopic transition, between vibrational energy levels is about 100 times greater than that of a typical transition between [[rotational energy]] levels.\n\n==Hund's cases==\n{{Main|Hund's cases}}\nThe [[good quantum number]]s for a diatomic molecule, as well as good approximations of rotational energy levels, can be obtained by modeling the molecule using [[Hund's cases]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Symmetry of diatomic molecules]]\n* [[AXE method]]\n*[[Octatomic element]]\n*[[Covalent bond]]\n*[[Industrial gas]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2|refs=\n\n<ref name=levine1975>{{citation |first1=Ira N. |last1=Levine |title=Molecular Spectroscopy |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=1975 |isbn=0-471-53128-6 |pages=508\u20139}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=gilmore1992>\n{{cite journal\n| last = Gilmore\n| first = Forrest R.\n| last2 = Laher\n| first2 = Russ R.\n| last3 = Espy\n| first3 = Patrick J.\n| year = 1992\n| title = Franck-Condon Factors, r-Centroids, Electronic Transition Moments, and Einstein Coefficients for Many Nitrogen and Oxygen Band Systems\n| journal = [[Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data]]\n| volume = 21\n| issue = 5\n| pages = 1005\u20131107\n| doi=10.1063/1.555910\n|bibcode = 1992JPCRD..21.1005G | url = http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA246065\n}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=laher1991>\n{{cite journal\n| last = Laher\n| first = Russ R.\n| last2 = Gilmore\n| first2 = Forrest R.\n| year = 1991\n| title = Improved Fits for the Vibrational and Rotational Constants of Many States of Nitrogen and Oxygen\n| journal = [[Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data]]\n| volume = 20\n| issue = 4\n| pages = 685\u2013712\n| doi=10.1063/1.555892\n|bibcode = 1991JPCRD..20..685L | url = http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA229996\n}}\n</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |author1=Huber, K.

These are abbreviated by a 'd' followed by the number of sides. Shown counter-clockwise from the bottom are: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20 dice. A pair of d10 can be used together to represent percentile dice, or d100.]]\n\nBefore the game begins, each player [[character creation|creates]] their player character and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's [[Game mechanics (Dungeons & Dragons)#Ability scores|ability scores]], which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each edition of the game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics.<ref>The original game used 3d6 in the order rolled (Gygax, Arneson; ''Dungeons & Dragons''). Variants have since been included (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 11) and the standard for 3rd edition is \"rolling four six-sided dice, ignoring the lowest die, and totaling the other three\" (Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' [3.0], p. 4), arranging the results in any order desired. 4th edition allows for a \"point buy\" system.</ref> The player then chooses a [[Character race (Dungeons & Dragons)|race]] (species) such as human or elf, a [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character class]] (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]] (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.\n\nDuring the game, players describe their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response.<ref>Tweet; ''Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game'' p. 24</ref> Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice.<ref name=\"Culture chapter\"/> Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills and the difficulty of the task.<ref>Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 62</ref> In circumstances where a character does not have control of an event, such as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a [[saving throw]] can be used to determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided.<ref name=\"PHB p.136\">Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 136</ref><ref>\"Generally, when you are subject to an unusual or magical attack, you get a saving throw to avoid or reduce the effect.\" There is identical language in sections titled 'Saving Throws' in (Tweet 2000:119).</ref> In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores.<ref name=\"PHB p.136\"/><ref>Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' (3.0), pp. 119\u2013120</ref>\n\nAs the game is played, each PC changes over time and generally increases in capability.

They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game.<ref>Tweet, Cook, Williams; ''Player's Handbook'' v3.5, p. 145</ref> Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 289</ref> or character levels.<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 296</ref> When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 41</ref>\n\n===Adventures, campaigns, and modules===\n{{Main|Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons)}}\n\nA typical ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game consists of an \"adventure\", which is roughly equivalent to a single story.<ref>Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 43</ref> The DM can either design an adventure on their own, or follow one of the many pre-made adventures (also known as \"modules\") that have been published throughout the history of ''Dungeons & Dragons''. Published adventures typically include a background story, illustrations, maps and goals for PCs to achieve. Some include location descriptions and handouts. Although a small adventure entitled \"[[Temple of the Frog]]\" was included in the ''[[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]]'' rules supplement in 1975, the first stand-alone ''D&D'' module published by TSR was 1978's ''[[Steading of the Hill Giant Chief]]'', written by Gygax.\n\nA linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a \"[[campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]]\".<ref>\"A ''D&D'' campaign is an organized framework... to provide a realistic setting for a series of fantastic adventures.\" ([[Aaron Allston|Allston]]; ''Rules Cyclopedia'', p. 256)</ref> The locations where these adventures occur, such as a city, country, planet or an entire [[fictional universe]], are referred to as \"[[campaign setting]]s\" or \"world\".<ref>\"It is important to distinguish between a campaign and a world, since the terms often seem to be used interchangeably&nbsp;... A world is a fictional place in which a campaign is set. It's also often called a campaign setting.\" (Cook, Williams, Tweet; ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' v3.5., p. 129)</ref> ''D&D'' settings are based in various fantasy genres and feature different levels and types of magic and technology.<ref>Williams ; ''Dungeon Master Option: High Level Campaigns'', p. 45</ref> Popular commercially published [[Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings|campaign settings for ''Dungeons & Dragons'']] include [[Greyhawk]], [[Dragonlance]], [[Forgotten Realms]], [[Mystara]], [[Spelljammer]], [[Ravenloft]], [[Dark Sun]], [[Planescape]], [[Birthright (campaign setting)|Birthright]], and [[Eberron]]. Alternatively, DMs may develop their own fictional worlds to use as campaign settings.\n\n===Miniature figures===\n{{Main|Miniature figure (gaming)}}\n[[File:Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures 2.jpg|thumb|300px|''Dungeons & Dragons'' miniature figures. The grid mat underneath uses one-inch squares.]]\n\nThe [[wargaming|wargames]] from which ''Dungeons & Dragons'' evolved used miniature figures to represent combatants. ''D&D'' initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original ''D&D'' set of 1974 required the use of the ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'' miniatures game for combat resolution.<ref>Johnson, ''et al.''; ''30 Years of Adventure'', p. 23</ref> By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus miniatures were no longer required for game play, although some players continued to use them as a visual reference.<ref>The first ''Dungeon Masters Guide'' gave only a quarter of a page out of a total 240 pages to discussing the option use of miniatures. (Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 10)</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and similar games. Licensed miniature manufacturers who produced official figures include [[Grenadier Miniatures]] (1980\u20131983),<ref>Pope; Grenadier Models</ref> [[Citadel Miniatures]] (1984\u20131986),<ref>Scott; Otherworld</ref> [[Ral Partha]],<ref>Pope; Ral Partha</ref> and TSR itself.<ref>Pope; TSR</ref> Most of these miniatures used the 25&nbsp;mm scale.\n\nPeriodically, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming. Supplements such as ''[[Battlesystem]]'' (1985 & 1989) and a new edition of ''Chainmail'' (2001)<ref>Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design; List of Winners (2002)</ref> provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures.\n\n==Game history==\n\n===Sources and influences===\n{{Main|Sources and influences on the development of Dungeons & Dragons}}\n\nAn immediate predecessor of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was a set of medieval miniature rules written by [[Jeff Perren]]. These were expanded by [[Gary Gygax]], whose additions included a fantasy supplement, before the game was published as ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]''. When [[Dave Wesely]] entered the Army in 1970, his friend and fellow Napoleonics wargamer [[Dave Arneson]] began a medieval variation of Wesely's [[Braunstein (wargame)|Braunstein]] games, where players control individuals instead of armies.<ref name=\"DW3\">Arneson; \"My Life and Role Playing\" in ''Different Worlds'' #3</ref> Arneson used ''Chainmail'' to resolve combat.<ref name=\"Banshee_Gygax\">{{Harvnb|Birnbaum|2004}}</ref> As play progressed, Arneson added such innovations as character classes, experience points, level advancement, armor class, and others.<ref name=\"DW3\"/> Having partnered previously with Gygax on ''[[Don't Give Up the Ship!]]'', Arneson introduced Gygax to his Blackmoor game and the two then collaborated on developing \"The Fantasy Game\", the role-playing game (RPG) that became ''Dungeons & Dragons'', with the final writing and preparation of the text being done by Gygax.<ref name=\"D&Dfaq\"/><ref name=\"Wired\">Kushner; Dungeon Master: The Life and Legacy of Gary Gygax</ref><ref name=\"history\">Wizards of the Coast; The History of TSR</ref> The name was chosen by Gygax's two-year-old daughter Cindy \u2014 upon being presented with a number of choices of possible names, she exclaimed, \"Oh Daddy, I like Dungeons and Dragons best!\", although less prevalent versions of the story gave credit to his wife Mary Jo.<ref name=witwer>{{cite book | last = Witwer | first = Michael | title = Empire of the Imagination: Gary Gygax and the Birth of Dungeons & Dragons | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing | date = 2015 | location = New York | isbn = 978-1-63286-279-2}}</ref>{{rp|101}}\n\nMany ''Dungeons & Dragons'' elements appear in hobbies of the mid-to-late 20th century. For example, character-based role playing can be seen in [[improvisational theatre]].<ref>Grigg; Albert Goes Narrative Contracting</ref> Game-world simulations were well developed in wargaming. Fantasy milieux specifically designed for gaming could be seen in [[Glorantha]]'s board games among others.<ref name=\"Schick 17-34\">Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp. 17\u201334</ref> Ultimately, however, ''Dungeons & Dragons'' represents a unique blending of these elements.\n\nThe world of ''D&D'' was influenced by world mythology, history, [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], and contemporary fantasy novels. The importance of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as an influence on ''D&D'' is controversial. The presence in the game of [[Halfling (Dungeons & Dragons)|halflings]], [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], [[Half-elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|half-elves]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]], [[Orc (Dungeons & Dragons)|orcs]], [[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|rangers]], and the like, draw comparisons to these works. The resemblance was even closer before the threat of copyright action from [[Middle-earth Enterprises|Tolkien Enterprises]] prompted the name changes of [[hobbit]] to 'halfling', [[ent]] to '[[treant]]', and [[balrog]] to '[[Balor (Dungeons & Dragons)|balor]]'. For many years, Gygax played down the influence of Tolkien on the development of the game.<ref>Kuntz; \"Tolkien in Dungeons & Dragons\" in ''Dragon'' #13</ref><ref name=\"Dragon95\">Gygax; \"On the Influence of J. R. R. Tolkien on the D&D and AD&D games\" in ''Dragon'' #95</ref><ref>Drout; \"J.R.R.

(Gygax; ''Dungeon Masters Guide'', p. 224)</ref> Monsters, spells, and magic items used in the game have been inspired by hundreds of individual works such as [[Van vogt|A. E. van Vogt's]] \"Black Destroyer\", [[Coeurl]] (the [[Displacer Beast]]), [[Lewis Carroll]]'s \"[[Jabberwocky]]\" ([[vorpal]] sword) and the [[Book of Genesis]] (the clerical spell 'Blade Barrier' was inspired by the \"[[Flaming sword (mythology)|flaming sword]] which turned every way\" at the gates of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]).<ref name=\"lit_source\">DeVarque; Literary Sources of D&D</ref>\n\n===Edition history===\n{{Main|Editions of Dungeons & Dragons}}\n\n''Dungeons & Dragons'' has gone through several revisions.

It was amateurish in production and assumed the player was familiar with wargaming. Nevertheless, it grew rapidly in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold in the first year followed by 3,000 in 1975, and much more in the following years.<ref>{{cite book | first=Jon | last=Peterson | year=2012 | title=Playing at the World | page=496 | publisher=Unreason| isbn=978-0-615-64204-8 }}</ref> This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions, such as the original [[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]] and Blackmoor supplements (both 1975),<ref>Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', pp.&nbsp;132\u2013153</ref> as well as magazine articles in TSR's official publications and many [[fanzine]]s.\n\n====Two-pronged strategy====\n[[File:DungeonMasterGuide4Cover.jpg|thumb|right|150px|First edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Masters Guide''.]]\nIn early 1977, TSR created the first element of a two-pronged strategy that would divide ''D&D'' for nearly two decades. A ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set]]'' boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up the presentation of the essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores.<ref name=\"history\"/> Later in 1977, the first part of ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' (''AD&D'') was published,<ref name=\"history\" /> which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the ''Basic Set'' directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.\n\nAs a result of this parallel development, the basic game included many rules and concepts which contradicted comparable ones in ''AD&D''. [[John Eric Holmes]], the editor of the basic game, preferred a lighter tone with more room for personal improvisation. ''AD&D'', on the other hand, was designed to create a tighter, more structured game system than the loose framework of the original game.<ref name=\"Dragon 26 Gygax\"/> Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the \"core rulebooks\", were released: the ''[[Player's Handbook]]'' (PHB), the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' (DMG), and the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (MM). Several supplementary books were published throughout the 1980s, notably ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (1985) that included a large number of new rules.<ref name=\"history\"/> Confusing matters further, the original ''D&D'' boxed set remained in publication until 1979, since it remained a healthy seller for TSR.<ref name=\"Schick 17-34\" />\n\n====Revised editions====\nIn the 1980s, the rules for ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' and \"basic\" ''Dungeons & Dragons'' remained separate, each developing along different paths.\n\nIn 1981, the basic version of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' was revised by [[Tom Moldvay]] to make it even more novice-friendly. It was promoted as a continuation of the original ''D&D'' tone, whereas ''AD&D'' was promoted as advancement of the mechanics.<ref name=\"Dragon 26 Gygax\"/> An accompanying ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Expert Set|Expert Set]]'', originally written by [[David Cook (game designer)|David \"Zeb\" Cook]], allowed players to continue using the simpler ruleset beyond the early levels of play. In 1983, revisions of those sets by [[Frank Mentzer]] were released, revising the presentation of the rules to a more tutorial format. These were followed by ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Companion Set|Companion]]'' (1983), ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Master Rules|Master]]'' (1985), and ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Immortals Rules|Immortals]]'' (1986) sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/basic.html|title=Basic set|work=Acaeum.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624215519/http://acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/basic.html|archivedate=June 24, 2011|df=}}</ref><ref name=\"Schick 133\">Schick; ''Heroic Worlds'', p. 133</ref> Each set covered game play for more powerful characters than the previous.<ref>Gygax; \"Dungeons & Dragons: What Is It and Where Is It Going\" in ''The Dragon'' #21</ref> The first four sets were compiled in 1991 as a single hardcover book, the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]'', which was released alongside a new [[Dungeons & Dragons Game (1991 boxed set)|introductory boxed set]].\n\n''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition'' was published in 1989,<ref name=\"history\"/> again as three core rulebooks; the primary designer was David \"Zeb\" Cook.

In part as a response to this, some publishers (such as [[Paizo Publishing]] with its ''[[Pathfinder Roleplaying Game]]'') who previously produced materials in support of the ''D&D'' product line, decided to continue supporting the 3rd Edition rules, thereby competing directly with Wizards of the Coast.

This was confirmed in the case of ''[[R v Carroll]]'', where the police found new evidence convincingly disproving Carroll's sworn [[alibi]] two decades after he had been acquitted of murder charges in the death of [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] child Deidre Kennedy, and successfully prosecuted him for perjury. Public outcry following the overturn of his conviction (for perjury) by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] has led to widespread calls for reform of the law along the lines of the England and Wales legislation.\n\nDuring a [[COAG|Council of Australian Governments (COAG)]] meeting of 2007, model legislation to rework double jeopardy laws was drafted,<ref name=\"premier.vic.gov.au\">{{cite web|title=Coalition Government to introduce double jeopardy reforms|url=http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/2427-coalition-government-to-introduce-double-jeopardy-reforms.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322221443/http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/2427-coalition-government-to-introduce-double-jeopardy-reforms.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 March 2012|work=Victoria's double jeopardy laws to be reworked|accessdate=4 February 2012}}</ref> but there was no formal agreement for each state to introduce it.

A \"tainted acquittal\" requires a conviction for an administration of justice offence, such as perjury, that led to the original acquittal. Unlike reforms in the United Kingdom, New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, this law does not have a retrospective effect, which is unpopular with some advocates of the reform.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/double-jeopardy-changes-insufficient/2007/04/20/1176697080260.html|title=Double Jeopardy Changes Insufficient|newspaper=The Brisbane Times|date=20 April 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nThe [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] includes provisions such as [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11(h)]] prohibiting double jeopardy. However, this prohibition applies only after an accused person has been \"finally\" convicted or acquitted. [[Law of Canada|Canadian law]] allows the prosecution to appeal an acquittal: if the acquittal is thrown out, the new trial is not considered to be double jeopardy, as the verdict of the first trial would have been annulled. In rare circumstances, a [[court of appeal]] might also substitute a conviction for an acquittal. This is not considered to be double jeopardy, either \u2013 in this case, the appeal and subsequent conviction are deemed to be a continuation of the original trial.\n\nFor an appeal from an acquittal to be successful, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] requires that the [[Crown of Canada|Crown]] show that an error in law was made during the trial and that the error contributed to the verdict. It has been suggested that this test is unfairly beneficial to the prosecution. For instance, lawyer [[Martin Friedland]], in his book ''My Life in Crime and Other Academic Adventures'', contends that the rule should be changed so that a retrial is granted only when the error is shown to be ''responsible'' for the verdict, not just a factor.\n\nA notable example of this is [[Guy Paul Morin]], who was wrongfully convicted in his second trial after the acquittal in his first trial was vacated by the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nIn the [[Guy Turcotte]] case, for instance, the Quebec Court of Appeal overturned Turcotte's [[insanity defense|not criminally responsible]] verdict and ordered a second trial after it found that the judge committed an error in the first trial while giving instructions to the jury. Turcotte was later convicted of second-degree murder in the second trial.\n\n===France===\nOnce all appeals have been exhausted on a case, the judgement is final and the action of the prosecution is closed (code of penal procedure, art. 6), except if the final ruling was [[forgery|forged]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006574827&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154|title=Code of penal procedure, article 6|publisher=Legifrance|accessdate=2 January 2012|language=fr}}</ref> Prosecution for a crime already judged is impossible even if incriminating evidence has been found.

This means the prosecution and/or the defendants can appeal against a judgement if they do not agree with it. In this case the trial starts again in the second instance, the court of appeal (''Berufungsgericht''), which considers the facts and reasons again and delivers the final judgement then.\n\nIf one of the parties disagrees with the judgement of the second instance, he or she can appeal it, but only on formal judicial reasons. The case will checked in the third instance (''Revisionsgericht''), whether all laws are applied correctly.\n\nThe rule applies to the whole \"historical event, which is usually considered a single historical course of actions the separation of which would seem unnatural\". This is true even if new facts occur that indicate other and/or much serious crimes.\n\nThe Penal Procedural Code (''Strafprozessordnung'') permits a retrial (''Wiederaufnahmeverfahren''), if it is in favor of the defendant or if following events had happened:\n\n{{quotation|A retrial not in favour of the defendant is permissible after a final judgement,\n#if a document that was considered authentic during the trial was actually not authentic or forged,\n#if a witness or authorised expert wilfully or negligently made a wrong deposition or wilfully gave a wrong simple testimony,\n#if a professional or lay judge, who made the decision, had committed a crime by violating his or her duties as a judge in the case\n#if an acquitted defendant makes a credible confession in court or out of court.|\u00a7 362 StPO}}\n\nIn the case of an order of [[summary punishment]], which can be issued by the court without a trial for lesser misdemeanours, there is a further exception:\n{{quotation|A retrial not in favour of the defendant is also permissible if the defendant has been convicted in a final order of summary punishment and new facts or evidence have been brought forward, which establish grounds for a conviction of a felony by themselves or in combination with earlier evidence.|\u00a7 373a StPO}}\nIn Germany, a felony is defined by \u00a7 12 (1) StGB as a crime which has a minimum of one year of imprisonment.\n\n===India===\nA partial protection against double jeopardy is a [[Fundamental Rights in India|Fundamental Right]] guaranteed under Article 20 (2) of the [[Constitution of India]], which states \"No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once\".<ref name=\"constitution\">{{cite journal |url=http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/fullact1.asp?tfnm=00%2023 |title=Article 20, Section 2 |work=Constitution of India |quote=No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124001157/http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/fullact1.asp?tfnm=00%2023 |archivedate=24 November 2010}}</ref> This provision enshrines the concept of ''autrefois convict'', that no one convicted of an offence can be tried or punished a second time.

Only the acquittal in the Supreme Court is the final acquittal which prevents any further retrial. This process sometimes takes decades.\n\nThe above is not considered a violation of the constitution.

New evidence can be brought to bear during a retrial at a district court. Thus one can be tried twice for the same alleged crime. If one is convicted at the district court, the defence can make an appeal on procedural grounds to the supreme court. The supreme court might admit this complaint, and the case will be reopened yet again, at another district court. Again, new evidence might be introduced by the prosecution.\n\nOn 9 April 2013 the Dutch senate voted 36 \"yes\" versus 35 \"no\" in favor of a new law that allows the prosecutor to re-try a person who was found not guilty in court.

However, in 2016, the Supreme Court [[Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle|held]] that [[Puerto Rico]] is not a separate sovereign for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.<ref>''[[Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle]]'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-108_k4mp.pdf 579 U.S. ___ (2016)]</ref> The dual sovereignty doctrine has been the subject of substantial scholarly criticism.<ref>Adler, Adam J. \"Dual Sovereignty, Due Process, and Duplicative Punishment: A New Solution to an Old Problem.\" ''Yale Law Journal''.

Bretz]]'', 437 U.S. 28 (1978).</ref>\n\n====Prosecution after acquittal====\nWith two exceptions, the government is not permitted to appeal or retry the defendant once jeopardy attaches to a trial unless the case does not conclude. Conditions which constitute \"conclusion\" of a case include\n* After the entry of an acquittal,\n** whether a directed verdict before the case is submitted to the jury,<ref>''[[Fong Foo v.

United States]]'', 557 U.S. 110 (2009).</ref> In such a situation, the government is barred by [[collateral estoppel]].\nIn these cases the trial is concluded and the prosecution is precluded from appealing or retrying the defendant over the offense to which they were acquitted.\n\nThis principle does not prevent the government from appealing a pre-trial motion to dismiss<ref>''[[Serfass v. United States]]'', 420 U.S. 377 (1973).</ref> or other non-merits dismissal,<ref>''[[United States v.

Florida]]'', 457 U.S. 31 (1982).</ref> on the principle that jeopardy has not \"terminated.\"\n\nThe \"dual sovereignty\" doctrine allows a federal prosecution of an offense to proceed regardless of a previous state prosecution for that same offense<ref>''Abbate v. United States'', 359 U.S. 187 (1959).</ref> and vice versa<ref>''Bartkus v. Illinois'', 359 U.S. 121 (1959).</ref> because \"an act denounced as a crime by both national and state sovereignties is an offense against the peace and dignity of both and may be punished by each.\"<ref>''United States v. Lanza'', 260 U.S. 377 (1922).</ref>  The doctrine is solidly entrenched in the law, but there has been a traditional reluctance in the federal executive branch to gratuitously wield the power it grants, due to public opinion being generally hostile to such action.<ref>Wayne R.

United States]]'' (1932), the Supreme Court announced the following test: the government may separately try and punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element that the other does not.<ref>''[[Blockburger v. United States]]'', 284 U.S. 299 (1932). See, e.g., ''[[Brown v. Ohio]]'', 432 U.S. 161 (1977).</ref> ''Blockburger'' is the default rule, unless the governing statute legislatively intends to depart; for example, [[Continuing Criminal Enterprise]] (CCE) may be punished separately from its predicates,<ref>''[[Garrett v.

Felix]]'', 503 U.S. 378 (1992).</ref>\n\nThe ''Blockburger'' test, originally developed in the multiple punishments context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction.<ref>''[[Missouri v. Hunter]]'', 459 U.S. 359 (1983).</ref> In ''[[Grady v. Corbin]]'' (1990), the Court held that a double jeopardy violation could lie even where the ''Blockburger'' test was not satisfied,<ref>''[[Grady v. Corbin]]'', 495 U.S. 508 (1990).</ref> but ''Grady'' was overruled in ''[[United States v. Dixon]]'' (1993).<ref>''[[United States v. Dixon]]'', 509 U.S. 688 (1993).</ref>\n\n====Prosecution after mistrial====\nThe rule for [[mistrial]]s depends upon who sought the mistrial. If the defendant moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial, unless the prosecutor acted in \"bad faith,\" i.e. goaded the defendant into moving for a mistrial because the government specifically wanted a mistrial.<ref>''[[Oregon v. Kennedy]]'', 456 U.S. 667 (1982).</ref> If the prosecutor moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial if the trial judge finds \"manifest necessity\" for granting the mistrial.<ref>''[[Arizona v. Washington]]'', 434 U.S. 497 (1978).</ref> The same standard governs mistrials granted [[sua sponte]].\n\nRetrials are not common, due to the legal expenses to the government. However, in the mid-1980s Georgia antiques dealer [[James Arthur Williams]] was tried a record four times for the murder of Danny Hansford and (after three mistrials) was finally acquitted on the grounds of self-defense. The case is recounted in the book ''[[Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil]]'' which was adapted into a film directed by [[Clint Eastwood]] (the movie omits the first three murder trials). {{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Non bis in idem]]''\n*[[Sam Sheppard]]\n*U.S. law: [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n\n===Australia===\n; In favour of current rule prohibiting retrial after acquittal\n*[http://www.agd.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/pdo/ll_pdo.nsf/pages/PDO_ruleagainstdoublejeopardy NSW Public Defenders Office]\n\n; Opposing the rule that prohibits retrial after acquittal\n*[http://www.autrefoisacquit.info/index.html Questioning Double Jeopardy]\n*[http://www.doublejeopardyreform.org DoubleJeopardyReform.Org]\n\n===United Kingdom===\nResearch and Notes produced for the UK Parliament, summarising the history of legal change, views and responses, and analyses:\n* {{cite web|last=Broadbridge |first=Sally |title=Research paper 02/74: The Criminal Justice Bill: Double jeopardy and prosecution appeals |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2002/rp02-074.pdf |publisher=UK parliament |accessdate=5 January 2012 |date=2 December 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120235713/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2002/rp02-074.pdf |archivedate=20 November 2006 |df=dmy }}\n* {{cite web|last=Broadbridge|first=Sally|title=Double jeopardy|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN01082|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=5 January 2012|date=28 January 2009}} ([http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN01082.pdf direct download link])\n\n===United States===\n*[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment05/ FindLaw Annotation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060110030555/http://www.uscourts.gov/outreach/DJ/index.htm Double Jeopardy Game on uscourts.gov] (archived from [http://www.uscourts.gov/outreach/DJ/index.htm the original] on 2006-01-10)\n*[[Jack McCall]] (famous murder case involving a claim of double jeopardy)\n\n===Other countries===\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071119043436/http://www.lawreform.ie/publications/data/lrc119/lrc_119.html Law Reform Commission of Ireland Consultation Paper on Prosecution Appeals Brought on Indictment]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Double Jeopardy}}\n[[Category:Criminal procedure]]\n[[Category:Legal terminology]]", "sha1": "b90efegmb6v7frov0wj4ehmo25kn00e"}}, {"title": "Disbarment", "ns": "0", "id": "7942", "revision": {"id": "849558351", "parentid": "848585233", "timestamp": "2018-07-09T20:32:45Z", "contributor": {"ip": "2600:1:F1A6:B9C3:0:62:4D28:C101"}, "comment": "/* Notable U.S. disbarments */He's against him too.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|Disbarred|the 1939 film|Disbarred (film)}}\n{{globalize/US|date=March 2009}}\n{{Wiktionary|disbarment|disbar}}\n{{Professional responsibility}}\n\n'''Disbarment''' is the removal of a [[lawyer]] from a [[bar association]] or the [[practice of law]], thus revoking his or her [[law license]] or [[admission to practice law]]. Disbarment is usually a punishment for [[Legal ethics|unethical]] or criminal conduct. Procedures vary depending on the [[law society]].\n\n==Germany==\nIn Germany, the ''[[Berufsverbot]]'' is a ban on practicing a profession, which can be issued to a lawyer for misconduct, [[Volksverhetzung]] or for serious mismanagement of personal finances.\n\nIn April 1933, the Nazi government issued a ''Berufsverbot'' forbidding the practice of law by Jews, communists, and other political opponents, except for those protected by the [[Frontk\u00e4mpferprivileg]].\n\n==United States==\n===Overview===\nGenerally disbarment is imposed as a sanction for conduct indicating that an attorney is not fit to practice law, willfully disregarding the interests of a client, or engaging in fraud which impedes the administration of justice. In addition, any lawyer who is convicted of a [[felony]] is automatically disbarred in most{{Where|date=November 2012}} jurisdictions, a policy that, although opposed by the [[American Bar Association]], has been described as a convicted felon's <!-- DON'T \"FIX\" THIS TO JUST DESSERTS -->[[just deserts]]<!-- \"Desert\", from the same French root as deserve, meaning something deserved -->.<ref>{{citation|volume=13|publisher=Hastings Const. L.Q.|pages=433|date=1985\u20131986|title=Automatic Disbarment: A Convicted Felon's Just Deserts|author1=Gentile, Michael A. |author2=McShea, Sarah Diane }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States legal system, disbarment is specific to regions; one can be disbarred from some courts, while still being a member of the [[bar association|bar]] in another jurisdiction. However, under the [[American Bar Association]]'s [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]], which have been adopted in most states, disbarment in one state or court is grounds for disbarment in a jurisdiction which has adopted the Model Rules.\n\nDisbarment is quite rare (in 2011, only 1,046 lawyers were disbarred<ref>https://www.rocketlawyer.com/blog/getting-disbarred-is-harder-than-you-think-915832</ref>). Instead, lawyers are usually sanctioned by their own clients through civil malpractice proceedings, or via fine, censure, suspension, or other punishments from the disciplinary boards. To be disbarred is considered a great embarrassment and shame, even if one no longer wishes to pursue a career in the law.\n\nBecause disbarment rules vary by area, different rules can apply depending on where a lawyer is disbarred. Notably, the majority of US states have no procedure for permanently disbarring a person. Depending on the jurisdiction, a lawyer may reapply to the bar immediately, after five to seven years, or be banned for life.<ref name=\"reapply\">{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3975/is_200707/ai_n19511820/pg_2 | work=The Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics | title=Should Permanent Disbarment be Permanent? | year=2007 | first=Brian | last=Finkelstein }} {{Dead link|date=June 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>\n\n===Notable U.S. disbarments===\n{{main|List of disbarments in the United States}}\nThe 20th and the 21st centuries have seen one former U.S. [[President of the United States|president]] and one former U.S. [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] disbarred, and another president suspended from one bar and caused to resign from another bar rather than face disbarment.\n\nFormer Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], having pleaded [[nolo contendere|no contest]] (which subjects a person to the same criminal penalties as a guilty plea, but is not an admission of guilt for a civil suit) to charges of [[bribery]] and [[tax evasion]], was disbarred from [[Maryland]], the state of which he had previously been [[Governor of Maryland|governor]].\n\nFormer President [[Richard Nixon]] was disbarred from [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1976.<ref>See In re Nixon, 53 A.D.2d 178, 385 N.Y.S.2d 305 (1st Dept. 1976)</ref><ref name=\"nixon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/exhibits/impeach/whthous1.html|date=July 9, 1976 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028075731/http://www.history.com/exhibits/impeach/whthous1.html |archivedate=2007-10-28 |df= }}</ref> for [[obstruction of justice]] related to the [[Watergate scandal]].

The tags are primarily used for the identification of dead and wounded soldiers; they have personal information about the soldiers and convey essential basic medical information, such as [[blood type]]<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Soldiers \"tagged\" for blood transfusion|publisher=Popular Science|date=February 1942|page=71, canned by Google Books |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pScDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA71-IA1}}</ref> and history of [[inoculation]]s. The tags often indicate religious preference as well. Dog tags are usually fabricated from a corrosion-resistant metal. They commonly contain two copies of the information, either in the form of a single tag that can be broken in half or two identical tags on the same chain. This duplication allows one tag (or half-tag) to be collected from a soldier's body for notification and the second to remain with the corpse when battle conditions prevent it from being immediately recovered. The term \"dog tags\" arose because of their resemblance to [[Pet tag|animal registration tags]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Dog tags.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army dogs tags from [[World War II]]]]\n\nThe earliest mention of an identification tag for soldiers comes in Polyaenus ([[Strategemata|Stratagems]] 1.17) where the Spartans wrote their names on sticks tied to their left wrists.

The recruit got the military status only after the oath of allegiance (\"sacramentum\"), at the end of \"probatio\", meaning that from a legal point of view the \"signaculum\" was given to a subject who was no longer a civilian, but not yet in the military.\n\nIn more recent times, dog tags were provided to Chinese soldiers as early as the mid-19th century. During the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping revolt]] (1851\u201366), both the Imperialists (i.e., the Chinese Imperial Army regular servicemen) and those Taiping rebels wearing a uniform wore a wooden dog tag at the belt, bearing the soldier's name, age, birthplace, unit, and date of enlistment.<ref>Heath I., Perry M.

Other soldiers stenciled identification on their knapsacks or scratched it in the soft lead backing of their army belt buckle.\n\nManufacturers of identification badges recognized a market and began advertising in periodicals. Their pins were usually shaped to suggest a branch of service, and engraved with the soldier's name and unit. Machine-stamped tags were also made of [[brass]] or [[lead]] with a hole and usually had (on one side) an eagle or shield, and such phrases as \"War for the Union\" or \"Liberty, Union, and Equality\".  The other side had the soldier's name and unit, and sometimes a list of [[battle]]s in which he had participated.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Franco-Prussian War===\nOn a volunteer basis Prussian soldiers had decided to wear identification tags in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866.<ref>{{ill|Gottfried Friedrich Franz Loeffler|lt=Friedrich Loeffler|de|Friedrich Loeffler (Generalarzt)}}, ''Das Preussische Milit\u00e4r-Sanit\u00e4tswesen und seine Reform nach der Kriegserfahrung von 1866'': 2 parts, Berlin: Hischwald, 1868 and 1869, pt. 1 'Die freiwillige Krankenpflege und die Genfer Convention vom 22.

So until eight months after the [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]], with almost 8,900 Prussian casualties, only 429 of them could be identified. With the formation of the [[North German Confederation]] in 1867 [[Prussia]]n military regulations became binding for the militaries of all North German member states.

The [[Prussian Army]] issued identification tags for its troops at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870. They were nicknamed ''Hundemarken'' (the German equivalent of \"dog tags\") and compared to a similar identification system instituted by the dog licence fee, adding tags to collars of those dogs whose owners paid the fee, in the Prussian capital city of [[Berlin]] at around the same time period.<ref>Law, Clive M.

The first tag, an octagonal green disc, was attached to a long cord around the neck. The second tag, a circular red disc, was threaded on a 6-inch cord suspended from the first tag. The first tag was intended to remain on the body for future identification, while the second tag could be taken to record the death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/westernfrontassociation/4103848556/|title=AO 287 - September 1916|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westernfrontassociation.com/the-great-war/great-war-on-land/weapons-equipment-uniform/1033-identifying-dead-short-study-identification-tags-1914-1918.html|title=Identifying the Dead: a Short Study of the Identification Tags of 1914-1918|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBritish and [[British Empire|Empire]]/[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces (Australia, Canada, and New Zealand) were issued essentially identical identification discs of basic pattern during the Great War, [[Second World War]] and [[Korean War|Korea]], though official identity discs were frequently supplemented by private-purchase items such as identity bracelets, particularly favoured by sailors who rightly believed the official discs were unlikely to survive long immersion in water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/identity-tags|title=Identity tags|first=|last=Catriona|date=11 November 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[U.S. Army]] first authorized identification tags in [[U.S. War Department|War Department]] General Order No. 204, dated December 20, 1906, which essentially prescribes the Kennedy identification tag:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbqgCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA147&dq=War+Department+General+Order+No.+204,+dated+December+20,+1906:&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi6uejm4vfRAhXIz1QKHbh2C7UQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=War%20Department%20General%20Order%20No.%20204,%20dated%20December%2020,%201906:&f=false|title=Delaware in World War I|last=Retired)|first=Brigadier General Kennard R.

It is prescribed as a part of the uniform and when not worn as directed herein will be habitually kept in the possession of the owner. The tag will be issued by the Quartermaster's Department gratuitously to enlisted men and at cost price to officers.</blockquote>\n\nThe army changed regulations on July 6, 1916, so that all soldiers were issued two tags: one to stay with the body and the other to go to the person in charge of the burial for record-keeping purposes. In 1918, the army adopted and allotted the [[serial number]] system, and name and serial numbers were ordered stamped on the identification tags. (Serial number 1 was assigned to enlisted man Arthur B. Crane of Chicago in the course of his fifth enlistment period.)\n\n===World War II \"Notched\" tags===\n[[Image:South African Navy WW2 dogtag.jpg|thumb|One of the two identity discs issued by the [[South African Navy]] during World War II with rank, surname, initials, force number and religious affiliation]]\n\nThere is a recurring myth about the notch situated in one end of the dog tags issued to United States Army personnel during [[World War II]], and up until the [[Vietnam War]] era. It was rumored that the notch's purpose was that, if a soldier found one of his comrades on the battlefield, he could take one tag to the commanding officer and stick the other between the teeth of the soldier to ensure that the tag would remain with the body and be identified.\n\nIn reality, the notch was used with the Model 70 [[Addressograph]] Hand Identification Imprinting Machine (a pistol-type imprinter used primarily by the Medical Department during World War II).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.armydogtags.com/a_PurposeNotch.php|title=Notch Purpose on Army Dog Tags|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Barbara |last=Mikkelson|url=http://www.snopes.com/military/notch.asp |title=Notch for the Faint Hearted|website= [[Snopes.com]]|date= 2 August 2007|accessdate=12 September 2007}}</ref> American dogtags of the 1930s through 1970s were produced using a [[Graphotype (machine)|Graphotype machine]], in which characters are [[debossed]] into metal plates.  Some tags are still debossed, using earlier equipment, and some are embossed (with raised letters) on computer-controlled equipment.\n\nIn the Graphotype process, commonly used commercially from the early 1900s through the 1980s, a debossing machine was used to stamp characters into metal plates; the plates could then be used to repetitively stamp such things as addresses onto paper in the same way that a [[typewriter]] functions, except that a single stroke of the printer could produce a block of text, rather than requiring each character to be printed individually.  The debossing process creates durable, easily legible metal plates, well-suited for military identification tags, leading to adoption of the system by the American military.  It was also realized that debossed tags can function the same way the original Graphotype plates do.\n\nThe Model 70 took advantage of this fact, and was intended to rapidly print all of the information from a soldier's dogtag directly onto medical and personnel forms, with a single squeeze of the trigger.  However, this requires that the tag being inserted with the proper orientation (stamped characters facing down), and it was believed that battlefield stress could lead to errors.  To force proper orientation of the tags, the tags are produced with a notch, and there is a locator tab inside the Model 70 which prevents the printer from operating if the tag is inserted with the notch in the wrong place (as it is if the tag is upside down).\n\nThis feature was not as useful in the field as had been hoped, however, due to adverse conditions such as weather, dirt and dust, water, etc. In addition, the Model 70 resembled a pistol, thus attracting the attention of snipers (who might assume that a man carrying a pistol was an officer).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  As a result, use of the Model 70 hand imprinter by field medics was rapidly abandoned (as were most of the Model 70s themselves), and eventually the specification that tags include the locator notch was removed from production orders. Existing stocks of tags were used until depleted, and in the 1960s it was not uncommon for a soldier to be issued one tag with the notch and one tag without.  Notched tags are still in production, to satisfy the needs of hobbyists, film production, etc., while the Model 70 imprinter has become a rare collector's item.\n\nIt appears instructions that would confirm the notch's mythical use were issued at least unofficially by the [[Graves Registration Service]] during the [[Vietnam War]] to Army troops headed overseas.<ref>Col.

Originally worn as a part of a military uniform by youth wishing to present a tough or militaristic image, dog tags have since seeped out into wider fashion circles.

Numerous companies <!-- do not list examples - not notable --> offer customers the opportunity to create their own personalized dog tags with their own photos, logos, and text.

Both sides contain the same information: the soldier's personal identity code, blood group and the word HUNGARIA. Some may not have the blood group on them. These are only issued to soldiers who are serving outside of the country. If the soldier should die, one side is removed and kept for the army's official records, while the other side is left attached to the body.\n[[File:D\u00f6gc\u00e9dula 1.JPG|thumb|Hungarian 1978M currest issue dog tag]]\n\n===Iraq===\nThe Saddam-era Iraqi Army utilized a single, long, rectangular metal tag with oval ends, inscribed (usually by hand) with Name and Number or Unit, and occasionally Blood Type.\n\n===Israel===\nDog tags of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] are designed to be broken in two. The information appears in three lines (twice):\n*Army identification number (\"mispar ishi\", literally: personal number. A seven-digit number that is different from the nine-digit [[Teudat Zehut|identification number]] for citizens).\n*Last name\n*First Name\n\nAnother two dog tags are kept inside each military boot in order to identify dead soldiers.\n\nOriginally the IDF issued two circular aluminum tags (1948 \u2013 late 1950s) stamped in three lines with serial number, family name, and first name. The tags were threaded together through a single hole onto a cord worn around the neck.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Japan===\nJapan follows a similar system to the US Army for its [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] personnel, and the appearance of the tags is similar, although laser etched.

The term ''wrist tags'' can be used to refer to the [[bracelet]]-like [[wristwatch]]. The additional tags only need to be worn on the wrist, with the main tags still on the neck. All personnel are allowed to attach a small religious [[pendant]] or [[locket]]; this makes a quick identifiable reference for their funeral services.\n\n===Mexico===\nThe Ej\u00e9rcito de Mexico uses a single long, rectangular metal tag with oval ends, embossed with Name, serial number, and blood type plus Rh factor.\n\n===Netherlands===\n[[Military of the Netherlands]] identity tags, like the Canadian and Norwegian ones, are designed to be broken in two in case of a fatality; the lower end is returned to Dutch Defence Headquarters, while the upper half remains on the body. There is a difference in the Army and Airforce service number and the Navy service number:\n*[[Army number]] is made up of the date of birth in YY.MM.DD. format, for example 83.01.15, and a three-digit number, such as 123.\n*Navy number is made up out of random five- or six-digit numbers.\n\nThe tags contain the following information:\n*Upper half:\n**Name and family name\n**Service number\n**Nationality (NL) and religion\n**Blood group with [[Rhesus blood group system|RH]] factor\n*Lower half: identical.\n\n===Norway===\n[[Norway|Norwegian]] dog tags are designed to be broken in two like the Canadian version:\n* The top half contains the nationality, [[National identification number#Norway|the eleven-digit birth number]] and the blood type.\n* The bottom half contains the nationality and birth number and has a hole so the broken-off half can be hung on a ring.\n\n===Poland===\nThe first dog tags were issued in Poland following the order of the General Staff of December 12, 1920. The earliest design (dubbed ''kapala'' in Polish, more properly called \"kapsel legitymacyjny\" - meaning \"identification cap\") consisted of a tin-made 30\u00d750&nbsp;mm rectangular frame and a rectangular cap fitting into the frame. Soldiers' details were filled in a small ID card placed inside the frame, as well as on the inside of the frame itself. The dog tag was similar to the tags used by the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] during [[World War I]]. In case the soldier died, the frame was left with his body, while the lid was returned to his unit together with a note on his death. The ID card was handed over to the chaplain or the rabbi.\n\nIn 1928, a new type of dog tag was proposed by [[genera\u0142 brygady|gen. bryg.]] [[Stanis\u0142aw Rouppert]], Poland's representative at the [[International Red Cross]]. It was slightly modified and adopted in 1931 under the name of Nie\u015bmiertelnik wz. 1931 (literally, Immortalizer mark 1931). The new design consisted of an oval piece of metal (ideally steel, but in most cases aluminum alloy was used), roughly 40 by 50 millimeters.

There is usually a ''resonance head'' on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the [[thumb roll]]. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.<ref name=grove/>\n\nDrums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such as the [[djembe]] are almost always played in this way. Others are normally played in a set of two or more, all played by the one player, such as [[bongo drums]] and [[timpani]]. A number of different drums together with [[cymbal]]s form the basic modern [[drum kit]].\n\n==Uses==\nDrums are usually played by striking with the hand, or with one or two sticks. A wide variety of sticks are used, including wooden sticks and sticks with soft beaters of felt on the end. In jazz, some In many traditional cultures, drums have a symbolic function and are used in religious ceremonies. Drums are often used in [[music therapy]], especially hand drums, because of their tactile nature and easy use by a wide variety of people.<ref>{{Cite news\n | last=Weiss\n | first=Rick\n | title= Music Therapy\n | periodical= The Washington Post\n | issue= Jul 5,1994\n | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72257976.html?dids=72257976:72257976&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=JUL+05%2C+1994&author=Rick+Weiss&pub=The+Washington+Post&desc=MUSIC+THERAPY&pqatl=google\n| date=July 5, 1994\n}}</ref>\n\nIn [[popular music]] and [[jazz]], \"drums\" usually refers to a [[drum kit]] or a set of drums (with some [[cymbals]], or in the case of harder [[rock music]] genres, many cymbals), and \"[[drummer]]\" to the person who plays them.\n\nDrums acquired even divine status in places such as [[Burundi]], where the ''[[karyenda]]'' was a symbol of the power of the king.\n\n==Construction==\n[[Image:DrumMozartRegiment.jpg|thumb|Drum carried by John Unger, Company B, 40th Regiment New York Veteran Volunteer Infantry Mozart Regiment, December 20, 1863]]\n\nThe shell almost invariably has a circular opening over which the drumhead is stretched, but the shape of the remainder of the shell varies widely. In the western musical tradition, the most usual shape is a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], although [[timpani]], for example, use [[bowl (vessel)|bowl]]-shaped shells.<ref name=grove/> Other shapes include a frame design ([[tar (drum)|tar]], [[Bodhr\u00e1n]]), truncated cones ([[bongo drum]]s, [[Ashiko]]), [[Goblet drum|goblet shaped]] ([[djembe]]), and joined truncated cones ([[talking drum]]).\n\nDrums with cylindrical shells can be open at one end (as is the case with [[timbales]]), or can have two drum heads, one head on each end. Single-headed drums typically consist of a skin stretched over an enclosed space, or over one of the ends of a hollow vessel. Drums with two heads covering both ends of a cylindrical shell often have a small hole somewhat halfway between the two heads; the shell forms a [[resonance|resonating]] chamber for the resulting sound. Exceptions include the African [[slit drum]], also known as a log drum as it is made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, and the [[steel drum|Caribbean steel drum]], made from a metal barrel. Drums with two heads can also have a set of wires, called snares, held across the bottom head, top head, or both heads, hence the name [[snare drum]].<ref name=grove/> On some drums with two heads, a hole or [[bass reflex]] port may be cut or installed onto one head, as with some 2010s era [[bass drum]]s in [[rock music]].\n\nOn modern [[band (music)|band]] and [[orchestral]] drums, the drumhead is placed over the opening of the drum, which in turn is held onto the shell by a \"counterhoop\" (or \"rim\"), which is then held by means of a number of tuning screws called \"tension rods\" that screw into lugs placed evenly around the circumference. The head's tension can be adjusted by loosening or tightening the rods. Many such drums have six to ten tension rods. The sound of a drum depends on many variables\u2014including shape, shell size and thickness, shell materials, counterhoop material, drumhead material, drumhead tension, drum position, location, and striking velocity and angle.<ref name=grove/>\n\nPrior to the invention of tension rods, drum skins were attached and tuned by rope systems\u2014as on the [[Djembe]]\u2014or pegs and ropes such as on [[Ewe music|Ewe Drums]]. These methods are rarely used today, though sometimes appear on regimental marching band snare drums.<ref name=grove/> The head of a talking drum, for example, can be temporarily tightened by squeezing the ropes that connect the top and bottom heads. Similarly, the tabla is tuned by hammering a disc held in place around the drum by ropes stretching from the top to bottom head. Orchestral timpani can be quickly tuned to precise pitches by using a foot pedal.\n\n==Sound==\n[[Image:Drums for sale at the National Museum of the American Indian.jpg|thumb|right|Several [[Amerindians|American Indian]]-style drums for sale at the [[National Museum of the American Indian]]]]\n\nSeveral factors determine the sound a drum produces, including the type, shape and construction of the drum shell, the type of [[drum head]]s it has, and the tension of these drumheads. Different drum sounds have different uses in music. Take, for example, the modern [[Tom-tom drum]]. A [[jazz]] drummer may want drums that are high pitched, resonant and quiet whereas a [[Rock music|rock]] drummer may prefer drums that are loud, dry and low-pitched. Since these drummers want different sounds, their drums are constructed and tuned differently.\n\nThe drum head has the most effect on how a drum sounds. Each type of drum head serves its own musical purpose and has its own unique sound. Double-ply drumheads dampen high frequency harmonics because they are heavier and they are suited to heavy playing.<ref>[http://www.drumbook.org Drum Lessons] - Drumbook.org</ref> Drum heads with a white, textured coating on them muffle the [[overtone]]s of the drum head slightly, producing a less diverse [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. Drum heads with central silver or black dots tend to muffle the overtones even more. And drum heads with [[perimeter]] sound rings mostly eliminate overtones (Howie 2005). Some jazz drummers avoid using thick drum heads, preferring single ply drum heads or drum heads with no muffling. Rock drummers often prefer the thicker or coated drum heads.\n\nThe second biggest factor that affects drum sound is head tension against the shell. When the hoop is placed around the drum head and shell and tightened down with tension rods, the tension of the head can be adjusted. When the tension is increased, the [[amplitude]] of the sound is reduced and the [[frequency]] is increased, making the pitch higher and the volume lower.\n\nThe type of shell also affects the sound of a drum. Because the vibrations [[Resonance|resonate]] in the shell of the drum, the shell can be used to increase the volume and to manipulate the type of sound produced. The larger the diameter of the shell, the lower the pitch. The larger the depth of the drum, the louder the volume. Shell thickness also determines the volume of drums. Thicker shells produce louder drums. [[Mahogany]] raises the frequency of low pitches and keeps higher frequencies at about the same speed. When choosing a set of shells, a jazz drummer may want smaller maple shells, while a rock drummer may want larger birch shells.

The talking drums of Africa are used to imitate the tone patterns of spoken language. Throughout [[History of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan history]] drums have been used for communication between the state and the community, and Sri Lankan drums have a history stretching back over 2500 years.\n\n===Drums in art===\nDrumming may be a purposeful expression of emotion for entertainment, spiritualism and communication. Many cultures practice drumming as a spiritual or religious passage and interpret drummed rhythm similarly to spoken language or prayer.  Drumming has developed over millennia to be a powerful art form.  Drumming is commonly viewed as the root of music and is sometimes performed as a kinesthetic dance. As a discipline, drumming concentrates on training the body to punctuate, convey and interpret musical rhythmic intention to an audience and to the performer.\n\n===Military uses===\n{{Further information|Military drums}}\n{{listen\n|filename=Drum - Cadence A.ogg\n|title=Drum - Cadence A\n|filename2=Drum - Cadence B.ogg\n|title2=Drum - Cadence B\n|filename3=Drums - Four Flams.ogg\n|title3=Drum - Four Flams\n|description3=[[Snare drum]] [[drum cadence|cadences]] performed by the [[United States Navy Band]]\n}}\nChinese troops used [[t\u00e0ig\u01d4]] drums to motivate troops, to help set a marching pace, and to call out orders or announcements. For example, during a war between Qi and Lu in 684 BC, the effect of drum on soldier's morale is employed to change the result of a major battle. Fife-and-drum corps of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] mercenary foot soldiers also used drums. They used an early version of the [[snare drum]] carried over the player's right shoulder, suspended by a strap (typically played with one hand using [[traditional grip]]). It is to this instrument that the English word \"drum\" was first used. Similarly, during the [[English Civil War]] rope-tension drums would be carried by junior officers as a means to relay commands from senior officers over the noise of battle. These were also hung over the shoulder of the drummer and typically played with two drum sticks. Different [[regiment]]s and companies would have distinctive and unique drum beats only they recognized. In the mid-19th century, the Scottish military started incorporating [[pipe band]]s into their Highland Regiments.<ref>Chatto, Allan. (1996).

Moreover, the Greeks considered Delphi the [[omphalos|navel]] (or centre) of the world, as represented by the stone monument known as the [[Omphalos of Delphi]].\n\nIt occupies an impressive site on the south-western slope of [[Mount Parnassus]], overlooking the coastal plain to the south and the valley of [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocis]]. It is now an extensive archaeological site with [[Delphi (modern town)|a small modern town of the same name]] nearby. It is recognised by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]] in having had a phenomenal influence in the ancient world, as evidenced by the rich monuments built there by most of the important ancient Greek city-states, demonstrating their fundamental [[Hellenic civilisation|Hellenic]] unity.\n\n==Origins and location==\n[[File:Map greek sanctuaries-en.svg|thumb|400px|Delphi among the main Greek sanctuaries]]\nDelphi is located in upper central Greece, on multiple plateaux along the slope of [[Mount Parnassus]], and includes the Sanctuary of Apollo, the site of the ancient [[Oracle]]. This semicircular spur is known as [[Phaedriades]], and overlooks the Pleistos Valley.\n\nIn myths dating to [[Classical Greece|the classical period of Ancient Greece]] (510-323 BC), Zeus determined the site of Delphi when he sought to find the centre of his \"Grandmother Earth\" ([[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]). He sent two eagles flying from the eastern and western extremities, and the path of the eagles crossed over Delphi where the [[omphalos]], or navel of Gaia was found.<ref>Graves, Robert (1993), \"The Greek Myths: Complete Edition\" (Penguin, Harmondsworth)</ref>\n\nEarlier myths <ref>Pausanias 10.12.1</ref> include traditions that [[Pythia]], or the Delphic oracle, already was the site of an important oracle in the pre-classical Greek world (as early as 1400&nbsp;BC) and, rededicated from about 800&nbsp;BC, when it served as the major site during classical times for the worship of the god [[Apollo]]. Apollo was said to have slain [[Python (mythology)|Python]], a \"drako\" a serpent or a dragon who lived there and protected the [[Omphalos|navel]] of the [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]].<ref>Konstaninou, Ioanna \"Delphi: the Oracle and its Role in the Political and Social Life of the Ancient Greeks\" (Hannibal Publishing House, Athens)</ref> \"Python\" (derived from the verb \u03c0\u03cd\u03b8\u03c9 (''pyth\u014d''),<ref>\nEntry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpu%2Fqw \u03c0\u03cd\u03b8\u03c9] at [[LSJ]]</ref> \"to [[Decomposition|rot]]\") is claimed by some to be the original name of the site in recognition of Python which Apollo defeated.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=95}} The [[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Delphic Apollo]] recalled that the ancient name of this site had been ''Krisa''.<ref>''Hymn to Pythian Apollo'', l. 254&ndash;74: [[Telphousa]] recommends to Apollo to build his oracle temple at the site of \"Krisa below the glades of [[Mount Parnassus|Parnassus]]\".</ref> Others relate that it was named '''Pytho''' (\u03a0\u03c5\u03b8\u03ce) and that Pythia, the priestess serving as the oracle, was chosen from their ranks by a group of priestesses who officiated at the temple.\n\nExcavation at Delphi, which was a post-Mycenaean settlement of the late 9th&nbsp;century, has uncovered artifacts increasing steadily in volume beginning with the last quarter of the 8th century&nbsp;BC. Pottery and bronze as well as tripod dedications continue in a steady stream, in contrast to [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Neither the range of objects nor the presence of prestigious dedications proves that Delphi was a focus of attention for a wide range of worshippers, but the large quantity of valuable goods, found in no other mainland sanctuary, encourages that view.\n\n[[Apollo]]'s sacred precinct in Delphi was a panhellenic [[sanctuary]], where every four years, starting in 586&nbsp;BC{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=96}} athletes from all over the Greek world competed in the [[Pythian Games]], one of the four [[Panhellenic Games]], precursors of the [[Modern Olympics]]. The victors at Delphi were presented with a laurel crown (''stephanos'') which was ceremonially cut from a tree by a boy who re-enacted the slaying of the Python.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=96}} (These competitions are also called stephantic games, after the crown.) Delphi was set apart from the other games sites because it hosted the mousikos agon, musical competitions.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=95}}\n\nThese Pythian Games rank second among the four stephanitic games chronologically and in importance.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=96}} These games, though, were different from the games at Olympia in that they were not of such vast importance to the city of Delphi as the games at Olympia were to the area surrounding Olympia. Delphi would have been a renowned city whether or not it hosted these games; it had other attractions that led to it being labeled the \"omphalos\" (navel) of the earth, in other words, the centre of the world.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=96}}{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=97}}\n\nIn the inner ''hestia'' ([[hearth]]) of the Temple of Apollo, an [[eternal flame]] burned. After the [[battle of Plataea]], the Greek cities extinguished their fires and brought new fire from the hearth of Greece, at Delphi; in the [[foundation story|foundation stories]] of several Greek colonies, the founding colonists were first dedicated at Delphi.<ref>Burkert 1985, pp. 61, 84.</ref>\n\n==Religious significance==\n[[File:Delphi Temple of Apollo.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the ancient Temple of Apollo at Delphi, overlooking the valley of Phocis.]]\n\nThe name ''Delphi'' comes from the same root as \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03cd\u03c2 ''delphys'', \"womb\" and may indicate archaic veneration of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] at the site.<ref>Fontenrose, Joseph, ''The Delphic Oracle: Its Responses and Operations, with a Catalogue of Responses'' (1978). pp. 3\u20134. \"Such was its prestige that most Hellenes after 500&nbsp;BCE placed its foundation in the earliest days of the world: before Apollo took possession, they said, Ge (Earth) (''Gaia'') and her daughter Themis had spoken oracles at Pytho. Such has been the strength of the tradition that many historians and others have accepted as historical fact the ancient statement that Ge and Themis spoke oracles before it became Apollo's establishment. Yet nothing but the myth supports this statement. In the earliest account that we have of the Delphic Oracle's beginnings, the story found in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo (281\u2013374), there was no [[Oracle]] before Apollo came and killed the great she-dragon, Pytho's only inhabitant. This was apparently the Delphic myth of the sixth century\".</ref><ref>Farnell, Lewis Richard, ''The Cults of the Greek States'', v.III, pp. 8\u201310, onwards. \"The earth is the abode of the dead, therefore the earth-deity has power over the ghostly world: the shapes of [[dream]]s, which often foreshadowed the future, were supposed to ascend from the world below, therefore the earth-deity might acquire an oracular function, especially through the process of incubation, in which the consultant slept in a holy shrine with his ear upon the ground. That such conceptions attached to Gaia is shown by the records of her cults at Delphi, Athens, and Aegae. A recently discovered inscription speaks of a temple of Ge at Delphi. ... As regards Gaia, we also can accept it. It is confirmed by certain features in the latter Delphic divination, and also by the story of the Python.\"</ref> Apollo is connected with the site by his [[epithet]] \u0394\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 ''Delphinios'', \"the Delphinian\".

The [[Homer]]ic name of the oracle is ''Pytho'' (\u03a0\u03c5\u03b8\u03ce).<ref>[[Odyssey]], VIII, 80</ref> Another legend held that Apollo walked to Delphi from the north and stopped at [[Vale of Tempe|Tempe]], a city in [[Thessaly]], to pick laurel (also known as [[Bay laurel|bay tree]]) which he considered to be a sacred plant. In commemoration of this legend, the winners at the Pythian Games received a wreath of laurel picked in the Temple.\n\nDelphi became the site of a major temple to [[Apollo|Phoebus Apollo]], as well as the Pythian Games and the famous prehistoric oracle.

According to [[Aeschylus]] in the prologue of the ''[[Oresteia#The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', the oracle had origins in prehistoric times and the worship of [[Gaea (mythology)|Gaea]], a view echoed by H.W. Parke.<ref>Herbert William Parke, ''The Delphic Oracle'', v.1, p.3. \"The foundation of Delphi and its oracle took place before the times of recorded history. It would be foolish to look for a clear statement of origin from any ancient authority, but one might hope for a plain account of the primitive traditions. Actually this is not what we find. The foundation of the oracle is described by three early writers: the author of the ''Homeric Hymn to Apollo'', [[Aeschylus]] in the prologue to the ''Eumenides'', and [[Euripides]] in a chorus in the ''Iphigeneia in Tauris''. All three versions, instead of being simple and traditional, are already selective and tendentious. They disagree with each other basically, but have been superficially combined in the conventional version of late classical times.\" Parke goes on to say, \"This version [Euripides] evidently reproduces in a sophisticated form the primitive tradition which Aeschylus for his own purposes had been at pains to contradict: the belief that Apollo came to Delphi as an invader and appropriated for himself a previously existing oracle of [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]]. The slaying of the serpent is the act of conquest which secures his possession; not as in the ''Homeric Hymn'', a merely secondary work of improvement on the site. Another difference is also noticeable. The ''Homeric Hymn'', as we saw, implied that the method of prophecy used there was similar to that of [[Dodona]]: both Aeschylus and Euripides, writing in the fifth century, attribute to primeval times the same methods as used at Delphi in their own day. So much is implied by their allusions to tripods and prophetic seats.\" Continuing on p.6, \"Another very archaic feature at Delphi also confirms the ancient associations of the place with the Earth goddess. This was the Omphalos, an egg-shaped stone which was situated in the innermost sanctuary of the temple in historic times. Classical legend asserted that it marked the 'navel' (Omphalos) or center of the Earth and explained that this spot was determined by [[Zeus]] who had released two eagles to fly from opposite sides of the earth and that they had met exactly over this place\". On p.7 he writes further, \"So Delphi was originally devoted to the worship of the Earth goddess whom the Greeks called Ge, or Gaia. [[Themis]], who is associated with her in tradition as her daughter and partner or successor, is really another manifestation of the same deity: an identity which Aeschylus himself recognized in another context. The worship of these two, as one or distinguished, was displaced by the introduction of Apollo. His origin has been the subject of much learned controversy: it is sufficient for our purpose to take him as the ''Homeric Hymn'' represents him &#x2013; a northern intruder &#x2013; and his arrival must have occurred in the dark interval between Mycenaean and Hellenic times. His conflict with Ge for the possession of the cult site was represented under the legend of his slaying the serpent.\"</ref>\n\nOne tale of the sanctuary's discovery states that a goatherd, who grazed his flocks on Parnassus, one day observed his goats playing with great agility upon nearing a chasm in the rock; the goatherd noticing this held his head over the chasm causing the fumes to go to his brain; throwing him into a strange trance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|year=1876|page=11|author=William Godwin}}</ref>\n\n[[Apollo]] spoke through his oracle. She had to be an older woman of blameless life chosen from among the peasants of the area. Alone in an enclosed inner sanctum (Ancient Greek ''adyton'' - \"do not enter\") she sat on a tripod seat over an opening in the earth (the \"chasm\"). According to legend, when Apollo slew Python its body fell into this fissure and fumes arose from its decomposing body. Intoxicated by the vapours, the sibyl would fall into a trance, allowing Apollo to possess her spirit. In this state she prophesied. The oracle could not be consulted during the winter months, for this was traditionally the time when Apollo would live among the [[Hyperboreans]]. [[Dionysus]] would inhabit the temple during his absence.<ref>See (e.g.) Fearn 2007, 182.</ref>\n\nThe time to consult pythia for an oracle during the year is determined from astronomical and geological grounds related to the constellations of Lyra and Cygnus but{{clarify|date=June 2018}} the hydrocarbon vapours emitted from the chasm.<ref name=\"Liritzis_Castro\">{{cite journal|last1=Liritzis|first1=I.|last2=Castro|first2=B.|title=Delphi and Cosmovision: Apollo\u2019s absence at the land of the hyperboreans and the time for consulting the oracle|journal=Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage|date=2013|volume=16|issue=2|page=184}}</ref> Similar practice was followed in other Apollo oracles too.<ref name=\"Oracular_Func\">{{cite journal|last1=Castro|first1=Belen|last2=Liritzis|first2=Ioannis|last3=Nyquist|first3=Anne|title=Oracular Functioning And Architecture of Five Ancient Apollo Temples Through Archaeastronomy: Novel Approach And Interpretation|journal=Interpretation Nexus Network Journal, Architecture & Mathematics|date=2015|volume=18|issue=2|page=373|doi=10.1007/s00004-015-0276-2}}</ref>\n\nWhile in a trance the Pythia \"raved\" &ndash; probably a form of ecstatic speech &ndash; and her ravings were \"translated\" by the priests of the temple into elegant hexameters.

That exhalation could have been high in the known anaesthetic and sweet-smelling [[ethylene]] or other hydrocarbons such as [[ethane]] known to produce violent trances.

New York: Harcourt, Brace & World, 1961; p. 140. \"Because the founding of the city was for the Greeks, as it had been for earlier cultures, primarily a religious act, Delphi naturally assumed charge of the new foundations; and especially in the early period of colonization, the Pythian Apollo gave specific advice that dispatched new colonies in every direction, under the aegis of Apollo himself. Few cities would undertake such an expedition without consulting the oracle. Thus at a moment when the growth of population might have led to congestion within the city, to random emigration, or to conflicts for arable land in the more densely populated regions, Delphi, willy-nilly, faced the problem and conducted a program of organized dispersal.\"</ref> She also was respected by the Greek-influenced countries around the periphery of the Greek world, such as [[Lydia]], [[Caria]], and even [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].\n\nThe oracle was also known to the early Romans.

The town started to gain pan-Hellenic relevance as both a shrine and an oracle in the 7th century BC. Initially under the control of [[Phocaea]]n settlers based in nearby [[Kirra, Phocis|Kirra]] (currently [[Itea, Phocis|Itea]]), Delphi was reclaimed by the [[Athens|Athenians]] during the [[First Sacred War]] (597\u2013585 BC). The conflict resulted in the consolidation of the [[Amphictyonic League#The Delphic Amphictyony|Amphictyonic League]], which had both a military and a religious function revolving around the protection of the [[Delphi#Temple of Apollo|Temple of Apollo]]. This shrine was destroyed by fire in 548 BC and then fell under the control of the [[Alcmaeonidae|Alcmaeonids]] banned from Athens. In 449\u2013448 BC, the [[Second Sacred War]] (fought in the wider context of the [[First Peloponnesian War]] between the [[Peloponnesian League]] led by [[Sparta]] and the [[Delian League|Delian-Attic League]] led by Athens) resulted in the [[Phocis|Phocians]] gaining control of Delphi and the management of the [[Pythian Games]].\n\nIn 356 BC the Phocians under Philomelos captured and sacked Delphi, leading to the [[Third Sacred War]] (356\u2013346 BC), which ended with the defeat of the former and the [[rise of Macedon]] under the reign of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]. This led to the [[Rise of Macedon#Fourth Sacred War|Fourth Sacred War]] (339 BC), which culminated in the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] (338 BC) and the establishment of Macedonian rule over Greece.\nIn Delphi, Macedonian rule was superseded by the [[Aetolians]] in 279 BC, when a [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|Gallic invasion]] was repelled, and by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] in 191 BC. The site was sacked by [[Sulla|Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in 86 BC, during the [[Mithridatic Wars]], and by [[Nero]] in 66 AD. Although subsequent Roman emperors of the [[Flavian dynasty]] contributed towards to the restoration of the site, it gradually lost importance. In the course of the 3rd century [[mystery cults]] became more popular than the traditional [[Greek pantheon]]. Christianity, which started as yet one more mystery cult, soon gained ground, and this eventually resulted in the [[persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire]]. The anti-pagan legislation of the Flavian dynasty deprived ancient sanctuaries of their assets. The emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] attempted to reverse this religious climate, yet his \"pagan revival\" was particularly short-lived. When the doctor [[Oreibasius]] visited the oracle of Delphi, in order to question the fate of paganism,he received a pessimistic answer:\n\n{{lang|grc|\u0395\u1f34\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6, \u03c7\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5 \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u03ac,\n\n\u03bf\u1f50\u03ba\u03ad\u03c4\u03b9 \u03a6\u03bf\u1fd6\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03b2\u03b7\u03bd, \u03bf\u1f50 \u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03ac\u03c6\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd,\n\n\u03bf\u1f50 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u1f70\u03bd \u03bb\u03b1\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd, \u1f00\u03c0\u03ad\u03c3\u03b2\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bb\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1.}}\n\n[Tell the king that the flute has fallen to the ground.

Delphi itself remained almost uninhabited for centuries. It seems that one of the first buildings of the early modern era was the monastery of the [[Dormition of Mary]] or of [[Panagia]] (the Mother of God) built above the ancient [[gymnasium at Delphi]]. It must have been towards the end of the 15th or in the 16th century that a settlement started forming there, which eventually ended up forming the village of [[Kastri, Phocis|Kastri]].\n\n[[Ottoman Delphi]] gradually began to be investigated. The first Westerner to describe the remains in Delphi was [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli]] (Cyriacus of Ancona), a 15th-century merchant turned diplomat and antiquarian. He visited Delphi in March 1436 and remained there for six days. He recorded all the visible archaeological remains based on [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] for identification. He described the stadium and the theatre at that date as well as some free standing pieces of sculpture. He also recorded several inscriptions, most of which are now lost. His identifications however were not always correct: for example he described a round building he saw as the [[temple of Apollo (Delphi)|temple of Apollo]] while this was simply the base of the Argives' ex-voto. A severe earthquake in 1500 caused much damage.\n\nIn 1766 an English expedition funded by the [[Society of Dilettanti]] included the Oxford epigraphist [[Richard Chandler]], the architect [[Nicholas Revett]], and the painter [[William Pars]]. Their studies were published in 1769 under the title ''Ionian Antiquities'',<ref>Chandler, R, Revett, N., Pars, W., Ionian Antiquities, London 1769</ref> followed by a collection of inscriptions,<ref>Chandler, R, Revett, N., Pars, W., Inscriptiones antiquae, pleraeque nondum editae, in Asia Minore et Graecia, praesertim Athensis, collectae, Oxford, 1774</ref> and two travel books, one about Asia Minor (1775),<ref>Chandler, R, Revett, N., Pars, W., Travels in Asia Minor, Oxford, 1775.</ref> and one about Greece (1776).<ref>Chandler, R, Revett, N., Pars, W., Travels in Greece, Oxford, 1776.</ref> Apart from the antiquities, they also related some vivid descriptions of daily life in Kastri, such as the crude behaviour of the Turco-Albanians who guarded the mountain passes.\n\nIn 1805 [[Edward Dodwell]] visited Delphi, accompanied by the painter Simone Pomardi.<ref>''A classical and topographical tour through Greece'', London 1819</ref> [[Lord Byron]] visited in 1809, accompanied by his friend [[John Cam Hobhouse]]:\n\nYet there I've wandered by the vaulted rill;<br>\nYes!

These were built by many of the Greek city states to commemorate victories and to thank the oracle for her advice which was thought to have contributed to those victories. These buildings held the rich offerings made to Apollo; these were frequently a \"tithe\" or tenth of the spoils of a battle. The most impressive is the now-restored [[Athenian Treasury]], built to commemorate their victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490&nbsp;BC.\n\nThe [[Siphnian Treasury]] was dedicated by the city of [[Siphnos]] whose citizens gave a tithe of the yield from their silver mines until the mines came to an abrupt end when the sea flooded the workings.\n\nOne of the largest of the treasuries was that of Argos. Built in the late Doric period, the Argives took great pride in establishing their place amongst the other city states. Completed in 380 BC, the treasury draws inspiration mostly from the Temple of Hera located in the Argolis, the acropolis of the city. However, recent analysis of the Archaic elements of the treasury suggest that its founding preceded this.\n\nOther identifiable treasuries are those of the Sikyonians, the Boeotians and the Thebans.\n\n===Altar of the Chians===\nLocated in front of the Temple of Apollo, the main altar of the sanctuary was paid for and built by the people of [[Chios]].

On the support walls of the parodoi are engraved large numbers of [[Manumission inscriptions at Delphi|manumission inscriptions]] recording fictitious sales of the slaves to the god.\nThe koilon was divided horizontally in two zones via a corridor called diazoma. The lower zone had 27 rows of seats and the upper one only 8. Six radially arranged stairs divided the lower part of the koilon in seven tiers. The theatre could accommodate about 4,500 spectators.<ref>Bommelaer, J.-F. \u00abDas Theater\u00bb, in Maas, M. (ed), Delphi. Orakel am Nabel der Welt,Karlsruhe 1996, pp.95-105</ref>\n\nOn the occasion of Nero's visit to Greece in 67 A.D. various alterations took place. The orchestra was paved and delimited by a parapet made of stone. The proscenium was replaced by a low pedestal, the pulpitum; its fa\u00e7ade was decorated with scenes from Hercules' myth in relief. Further repairs and transformations took place in the 2nd century A.D. Pausanias mentions that these were carried out under the auspices of Herod Atticus.\nIn antiquity, the theatre was used for the vocal and musical contests which formed part of the programme of the Pythian Games in the late Hellenistic and Roman period.<ref>Mulliez, D., \u201c\u039f\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c5\u03b8\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u03b1\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2. \u039f\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ce\u03bd\u201d, in \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1, \u03a1.

The building consisted of two levels: a [[stoa]] on the upper level providing open space, and a [[palaestra]], pool and baths on lower floor. These pools and baths were said to have magical powers, and imparted the ability to communicate to Apollo himself.<ref name=\"ministry\"/>\n\n===Stadium===\n[[File:Delphi stadium DSC06305.jpg|thumb|250px|The mountain-top stadium at Delphi, far above the temples/theater below.]]\n{{main|Stadium of Delphi}}\nThe [[stadium]] is located further up the hill, beyond the ''via sacra'' and the theatre. It was originally built in the 5th century&nbsp;BC but was altered in later centuries. The last major remodelling took place in the 2nd century&nbsp;AD under the patronage of [[Herodes Atticus]] when the stone seating was built and (arched) entrance. It could seat 6500 spectators and the track was 177&nbsp;metres long and 25.5&nbsp;metres wide.<ref name=\"d\">[http://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/delphi-stadium.html Delphi Stadium] at Ancient-Greece.org.</ref>\n\n===Hippodrome===\nIt was at the Pythian games that prominent political leaders, such as [[Cleisthenes of Sicyon|Cleisthenes]], tyrant of [[Sikyon]], and [[Hiero I of Syracuse|Hieron]], tyrant of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], competed with their chariots. The hippodrome where these events took place was referred to by [[Pindar]],<ref>Pindar: Pythian 3</ref> and this monument was sought by archaeologists for over two centuries.\n\nIts traces have recently been found at Gonia in the plain of [[Crissa|Krisa]] in the place where the original stadium was sited.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/hippodrome-of-ancient-delphi-located.html#z06LKygAcwlc7Lmv.97|title=Hippodrome of ancient Delphi located|author=|date=|website=archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Polygonal wall===\n[[File:Section of Polygonal Wall at Delphi.jpg|thumb|250px|Section of polygonal wall at Delphi, behind a pillar from the Athenian Stoa.]]\nThe retaining wall was built to support the terrace housing the construction of the second temple of Apollo in 548&nbsp;BC. Its name is taken from the [[polygon]]al masonry of which it is constructed. At a later date, from 200&nbsp;BC onwards, the stones were inscribed with the [[manumission]] contracts of slaves who were consecrated to Apollo. Approximately a thousand manumissions are recorded on the wall.<ref>[http://www.coastal.edu/ashes2art/delphi2/sanctuary/manumission_wall.html Manumission Wall] at ''Ashes2Art''; [http://www.attalus.org/docs/other/inscr_24.html Manumission of female slaves at Delphi] at ''attalus.org''.</ref>\n\n===Castalian spring===\n{{Main article|Castalian Spring}}\nThe sacred spring of Delphi lies in the ravine of the Phaedriades. The preserved remains of two monumental fountains that received the water from the spring date to the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic]] period and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], with the latter cut into the rock.\n\n===Athletic statues===\nDelphi is famous for its many preserved athletic statues. It is known that Olympia originally housed far more of these statues, but time brought ruin to many of them, leaving Delphi as the main site of athletic statues.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=98}} [[Kleobis and Biton]], two brothers renowned for their strength, are modeled in two of the earliest known athletic statues at Delphi. The statues commemorate their feat of pulling their mother's cart several miles to the Sanctuary of Hera in the absence of oxen. The neighbors were most impressed and their mother asked Hera to grant them the greatest gift. When they entered Hera's temple, they fell into a slumber and never woke, dying at the height of their admiration, the perfect gift.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=98}}\n\nThe [[Charioteer of Delphi]] is another ancient relic that has withstood the centuries. It is one of the best known statues from antiquity. The charioteer has lost many features, including his chariot and his left arm, but he stands as a tribute to athletic art of antiquity.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=98}}\n[[Image:AurigaDelfi.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''Charioteer of Delphi'', 478 or 474 BC, Delphi Museum.]]\n\n==Architectural traditions==\n\nAncient tradition accounted for four temples that successively occupied the site before the 548/7&nbsp;BC fire, following which the Alcmaeonids built a fifth. The poet [[Pindar]] celebrated the Alcmaeonid's temple in ''Pythian'' 7.8-9 and he also provided details of the third building (''Paean'' 8. 65-75). Other details are given by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (10.5.9-13) and the Homeric Hymn to Apollo (294 ff.). The first temple was said to have been constructed out of olive branches from [[Vale of Tempe|Tempe]]. The second was made by bees out of wax and wings but was miraculously carried off by a powerful wind and deposited among the [[Hyperboreans]]. The third, as described by Pindar, was created by the gods [[Hephaestus]] and [[Athena]], but its architectural details included [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]-like figures or 'Enchantresses', whose baneful songs eventually provoked the Olympian gods to bury the temple in the earth (according to Pausanias, it was destroyed by earthquake and fire). In Pindar's words, addressed to the [[Muses]]:\n\n::::Muses, what was its fashion, shown\n::::By the skill in all arts\n::::Of the hands of Hephaestus and Athena?\n::::Of bronze the walls, and of bronze\n::::Stood the pillars beneath,\n::::But of gold were six Enchantresses\n::::Who sang above the eagle.\n::::But the sons of [[Cronus]]\n::::Opened the earth with a thunderbolt\n::::And hid the holiest of all things made.\n::::\n::::Away from their children\n::::And wives, when they hung\n::::Their lives on the honey-hearted words.<ref>Pindar, ''Paean'' 8.65-75, translated by C.M.

The museum houses an impressive collection associated with ancient Delphi, including the earliest known notation of a melody, the famous Charioteer, golden treasures discovered beneath the Sacred Way, and fragments of reliefs from the Siphnian Treasury. Immediately adjacent to the exit (and overlooked by most tour guides) is the inscription that mentions the Roman proconsul [[Gallio]].\n\nEntries to the museum and to the main complex are separate and chargeable, and a reduced rate ticket gets entry to both. There is a small cafe, and a post office by the museum.\n\n==Excavations==\n\n{{main article|Excavations at Delphi}}\n\nThe site had been occupied by the village of [[Kastri, Phocis|Kastri]] since medieval times. Before a systematic excavation of the site could be undertaken, the village had to be relocated but the residents resisted. The opportunity to relocate the village occurred when it was substantially damaged by an earthquake, with villagers offered a completely new village in exchange for the old site.<!-- <<== Told by state licenced guide during a tour--> In 1893 the [[French School at Athens|French Archaeological School]] removed vast quantities of soil from numerous landslides to reveal both the major buildings and structures of the sanctuary of Apollo and of Athena Pronoia along with thousands of objects, inscriptions and sculptures.<ref name=\"ministry\"/>\n\nThe site is now an archaeological one, and a very popular tourist destination. It is easily accessible from Athens as a day trip, and is often combined with the [[winter sports]] facilities available on Mount Parnassus, as well as the beaches and summer sports facilities of the nearby coast of [[Phocis]].\n\nThe site is also protected as a site of extraordinary natural beauty, and the views from it are also [[protected view|protected]]: no industrial artefacts are to be seen from Delphi other than roads and traditional architecture residences (for example high voltage power lines and the like are routed so as to be invisible from the area of the sanctuary).\n\n===5th Century Delphi===\nDuring the Great Excavation were discovered architectural members from a 5th-century Christian [[basilica]], when Delphi were a bishopric. Other important Late Roman buildings are the Eastern Baths, the house with the peristyle, the [[Agora of Delphi|Roman Agora]], the large cistern usw. At the outskirts of the city there were located late Roman cemeteries.\n\nTo the Southeast of the precinct of Apollo lay the so-called Southeastern Mansion, a very large building with a 65 meters-long fa\u00e7ade, spread over four levels, with four triclinia and private baths. Large storage jars kept the provisions, whereas other pottery vessels and luxury items were discovered in the rooms. Among the finds stands out a tiny leopard made of mother of pearl, possibly of Sassanian origin, on display in the ground floor gallery of the [[Delphi Archaeological Museum]]. The mansion dates to the beginning of the 5th century and functioned as a private house until 580, later however it was transformed into a potters' workshop.<ref>Petrides, P., 1997, \u00abDelphes dans l\u2019Antiquit\u00e9 tardive : premi\u00e8re approche topographique et c\u00e9ramologique\u00bb, BCH 121, 681-695</ref> It is only then, in the beginning of the 6th century, that the city seems to decline: its size is reduced and its trade contacts seem to be drastically diminished.

The houses were rather spacious and two large cisterns provided running water to them.<ref>Petrides, P., 2005, \u00abUn exemple d\u2019architecture civile en Gr\u00e8ce : les maisons protobyzantines de Delphes (IVe\u2013VIIe s.)\u00bb, M\u00e9langes Jean-Pierre Sodini, Travaux et M\u00e9moires 15, Paris, pp.193-204.</ref>\n\n==Depiction of Delphi in art==\n[[File:Claude Lorrain 027.jpg|thumb|''View of Delphi with Sacrificial Procession'' by [[Claude Lorrain]].]]\n\nFrom the 16th century onwards, West Europe developed an interest in Delphi. In the mid-15th century Strabo was first translated in Latin. The earliest depictions of Delphi were totally imaginary, created by the German N. Gerbel, who published in 1545 a text based on the map of Greece by N. Sofianos. The ancient sanctuary was depicted as a fortified city.\nThe first travelers with archaeological interests, apart from the precursor Cyriacus of Ancona, were the British [[George Wheler (clergyman and scholar)|George Wheler]] and the French [[Jacob Spon]], who visited Greece in a joint expedition in 1675-76. They published their impressions separately. In Wheler's \"Journey into Greece\", published in 1682, a sketch of the region of Dephi appeared, where the settlement of Kastri and some ruins were depicted. The illustrations in Spon's publication \"Voyage d'Italie, de Dalmatie, de Gr\u00e8ce et du Levant, 1678\" are considered original and groundbreaking.\n\nTravelers continued to visit Delphi throughout the 19th century and published their books which contained diaries, sketches, views of the site as well as pictures of coins. The illustrations often reflected the spirit of romanticism, as evident by the works of Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, where, apart from the landscapes (''La Gr\u00e8ce. Vues pittoresques et topographiques'', Paris 1834) are depicted also human types (''Costumes et usages des peuples de la Gr\u00e8ce moderne dessin\u00e9s sur les lieux'', Paris 1828). The philhellene painter W. Williams has comprised the landscape of Delphi in his themes (1829). important personalities such as F.Ch.-H.-L. Pouqueville, W.M. Leake, Chr. Wordsworth and Lord Byron are amongst the most important visitors of Delphi.\n\n[[File:'Delphi' by Edward Lear, watercolor, 12 by 19 cm..jpg|thumb|left|''Delphi'' by [[Edward Lear]] features the [[Phaedriades]].]]\nAfter the foundation of the modern Greek state, the press becomes also interested in these travelers. Thus \"Ephemeris\" writes (17/03/1889):\n\u201cIn the \"Revues des Deux Mondes\" [[Paul Lefaivre]] published his memoirs from an excursion to Delphi. The French author relates in a charming style his adventures on the road, praising particularly the ability of an old woman to put back in its place the dismantled arm of one of his foreign traveling companions, who had fallen off the horse. In [[Arachova]] the Greek type is preserved intact. The men are rather athletes than farmers, built for running and wrestling, particularly elegant and slender under their mountain gear. Only briefly does he refer to the antiquities of Delphi, but he refers to a pelasgian wall 80 meters long, on which innumerable inscriptions are carved, decrees, conventions, manumissions\".\n\nGradually the first travelling guides appeared. The revolutionary \"pocket\" books invented by [[Karl Baedeker]], accompanied by maps useful for visiting archaeological sites such as Delphi (1894) and the informed plans, the guides became practical and popular. The photographic lens revolutionized the way of depicting the landscape and the antiquities, particularly from 1893 onwards, when the systematic excavations of the French Archaeological School started. However, artists such as Vera Willoughby, continued to be inspired by the landscape.\n\nDelphic themes inspired several graphic artists. Besides the landscape, [[Pythia]]/Sibylla become an illustration subject even on Tarot cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/tarot-of-delphi/|title=Tarot of Delphi|author=|date=|website=www.aeclectic.net|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref> A famous example constitutes Michelangelo's Delphic Sibyl (1509),<ref>][https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Michelangelo_-_Delphic_Sibyl.jpg], \u03c4\u03bf Consulting the Oracle \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 John William Waterhouse (1882), the Priestess of Delphi by John Collier (1891), the work Consulting the Oracle \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 John William Waterhouse (1882) [http://www.jwwaterhouse.com/view.cfm?recordid=75]</ref> the 19th-century German engraving Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, as well as the most recent The Oracle of Delphi, inc on paper, by the Swedish Malin Lind.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theshapeshifter.wordpress.com/tag/delphi/|title=Delphi \u2013 Art, creation of life.|author=|date=|website=theshapeshifter.wordpress.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\nModern artists are inspired also by the Delphic Maxims. Examples of such works are displayed in the \"Sculpture park of the European Cultural Center of Delphi\" and in exhibitions taking place at the Archaeological Museum of Delphi.\n\n==Delphi in literature==\nDelphi inspired literature as well. In 1814 W. Haygarth, friend of Lord Byron, refers to Delphi in his work \"Greece, a Poem\". In 1888 [[Charles Marie Ren\u00e9 Leconte de Lisle]] published his lyric drama L\u2019Apollonide, accompanied by music by [[Franz Servais]]. More recent French authors used Delphi as a source of inspiration such as [[Yves Bonnefoy]] (Delphes du second jour) or Jean Sullivan (nickname of [[Joseph Lemarchand]]) in L'Obsession de Delphes (1967), but also [[Rob MacGregor]]'s [[Indiana Jones and the Peril at Delphi]] (1991).\n\nThe presence of Delphi in Greek literature is very intense. Poets such as [[Kostis Palamas]] (The Delphic Hymn, 1894), [[Kostas Karyotakis]] (Delphic festival, 1927), [[Nikephoros Vrettakos]] (return from Delphi, 1957), [[Yannis Ritsos]] (Delphi, 1961\u201362) and [[Kiki Dimoula]] (Gas omphalos and Appropriate terrain 1988), to mention only the most renowned ones. [[Angelos Sikelianos]] wrote The Dedication (of the Delphic speech) (1927), the Delphic Hymn (1927) and the tragedy Sibylla (1940), whereas in the context of the Delphic idea and the Delphic festivals he published an essay titled \"The Delphic union\" (1930). The nobelist [[George Seferis]] wrote an essay under the title \"Delphi\", comprised in the book \"Dokimes\".\n\nThe importance of Delphi for the Greeks is significant. The site has been recorded on the collective memory and have been expressed through tradition. [[Nikolaos Politis]], the famous Greek ethnographer, in his Studies on the life and language of the Greek people - part A, offers two examples from Delphi:\na) the priest of Apollo (176)\nWhen Christ was born a priest of Apollo was sacrificing below the monastery of Panayia, on the road of Livadeia, on a site called Logari. Suddenly he abandoned the sacrifice and says to the people: \"in this moment was born the son of God, who will be very powerful, like Apollo, but then Apollo will beat him\". He didn't have time to finish his speech and a thunder came down and burnt him, opening the rock nearby into two. [p.&nbsp;99]\nb)The Mylords (108)\nThe Mylords are not Christians, because nobody ever saw them cross themselves. They originate from the old pagan inhabitants of Delphi who kept their property in castle called Adelphi, named after the two brother princes who built it. When Christ and his mother came to the site, and all people around converted to Christianity they thought that they should better leave; thus the Mylords left for the West and took all their belongings with them. The Mylords come here now and worship these stones.

Their [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] and successor [[VAX]] products were the most successful of all [[minicomputer]]s in terms of sales.\n\nDEC was acquired in June 1998 by [[Compaq]], in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. The company subsequently merged with [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) in May 2002. {{As of|2007}} some of DEC's product lines were still produced under the HP name.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of Digital Equipment Corporation}}\n\nFrom 1957 until 1992, DEC's headquarters were located in a former wool mill in [[Maynard, Massachusetts]] (since renamed Clock Tower Place, and now home to many companies). DEC was acquired in June 1998 by [[Compaq]], which subsequently merged with [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) in May 2002. Some parts of DEC, notably the compiler business and the [[Hudson, Massachusetts]] facility, were sold to [[Intel]].\n\nInitially focusing on the small end of the computer market allowed DEC to grow without its potential competitors making serious efforts to compete with them. Their PDP series of machines became popular in the 1960s, especially the [[PDP-8]], widely considered to be the first successful [[minicomputer]]. Looking to simplify and update their line, DEC replaced most of their smaller machines with the [[PDP-11]] in 1970, eventually selling over 600,000 units and cementing DEC's position in the industry.\n\nOriginally designed as a follow-on to the PDP-11, DEC's [[VAX|VAX-11]] series was the first widely used [[32-bit]] minicomputer, sometimes referred to as \"[[Superminicomputer|superminis]]\". These systems were able to compete in many roles with larger [[mainframe computer]]s, such as the [[IBM System/370]]. The VAX was a best-seller, with over 400,000 sold, and its sales through the 1980s propelled the company into the second largest computer company in the industry. At its peak, DEC was the second largest employer in Massachusetts, second only to the Massachusetts State Government.\n\nThe rapid rise of the business [[microcomputer]] in the late 1980s, and especially the introduction of powerful 32-bit systems in the 1990s, quickly eroded the value of DEC's systems. DEC's last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly changing market was the [[DEC Alpha]] [[64-bit]] [[RISC]] [[instruction set architecture]]. DEC initially started work on Alpha as a way to re-implement their VAX series, but also employed it in a range of high-performance [[workstations]]. Although the Alpha processor family met both of these goals, and, for most of its lifetime, was the fastest processor family on the market, extremely high asking prices<ref>[http://alasir.com/articles/alpha_history/dec_collapse.shtml Alpha: The History in Facts and Comments - The Collapse of DEC].

DEC's own [[Multinational Character Set]] also had a large influence on [[ISO 8859-1]] (Latin-1) and, by extension, Unicode.\n\nThe first versions of the [[C (programming language)|C]] language and the [[Unix]] operating system ran on DEC's [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] series of computers (first on a PDP-7, then the [[PDP-11]]'s), which were among the first commercially viable [[minicomputer]]s, although for several years DEC itself did not encourage the use of Unix.\n\nDEC produced widely used and influential interactive operating systems, including [[OS/8|OS-8]], [[TOPS-10]], [[TOPS-20]], [[RSTS/E]], [[RSX-11]], [[RT-11]], and [[OpenVMS]]. PDP computers, in particular the [[PDP-11]] model, inspired a generation of programmers and software developers. Some PDP-11 systems more than 25 years old (software and hardware) are still being used to control and monitor factories, transportation systems and nuclear plants. DEC was an early champion of [[time-sharing]] systems.\n\nThe command-line interfaces found in DEC's systems, eventually codified as [[DIGITAL Command Language|DCL]], would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer CLIs; those used in earlier systems, such as [[Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS]], [[IBM]]'s [[Job Control Language|JCL]], or [[Univac]]'s time-sharing systems, would look utterly alien. Many features of the [[CP/M]] and MS-DOS [[Command-line interface|CLI]] show a recognizable family resemblance to DEC's OSes, including command names such as DIR and HELP and the \"name-dot-extension\" file naming conventions.\n\nThe [[MUMPS]] programming language, with its built-in database, was developed on the PDP-7, 9, and 15 series machines. MUMPS is still widely used in [[Health informatics|medical informations systems]], such as those provide by [[Meditech]] and [[Epic Systems]].\n\nVAX and [[MicroVAX]] computers (very widespread in the 1980s) running [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] formed one of the most important proprietary networks, [[DECnet]], which linked business and research facilities. The [[DECnet]] protocols formed one of the first peer-to-peer networking standards, with DECnet phase I being released in the mid-1970s. Email, file sharing, and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market.\n\nDEC, [[Intel]] and [[Xerox]] through their collaboration to create the DIX standard, were champions of [[Ethernet]], but DEC is the company that made Ethernet commercially successful. Initially, Ethernet-based DECnet and [[Local Area Transport|LAT]] protocols interconnected VAXes with [[DECserver]] [[terminal server]]s. Starting with the [[Unibus]] to Ethernet adapter, multiple generations of Ethernet hardware from DEC were the de facto standard. The CI \"computer interconnect\" adapter was the industry's first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive \"rings\".\n\nDEC also invented [[Computer cluster|clustering]], an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity. Clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the HSC50/70/90 and later series of Hierarchical Storage Controllers (HSC). The HSCs delivered the first hardware [[RAID 0]] and [[RAID 1]] capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies. This technology was the forerunner to architectures such as [[Network of Workstations]] which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as web-searches and drug research.\n\nThe LA36 and LA120 [[dot matrix printer]]s became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the [[Teletype Corporation]].\n\nThe [[VT100]] [[computer terminal]] became the industry standard, implementing a useful subset of the [[ANSI X3.64]] standard, and even today terminal emulators such as [[HyperACCESS|HyperTerminal]], [[PuTTY]] and [[Xterm]] still emulate a VT100 (or its more capable successor, the [[VT220]]).\n\nThe [[X Window System]], the network transparent window system used on [[Unix]] and [[Linux]], and also available on other operating systems, was developed at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] jointly between [[Project Athena]] and the [[Laboratory for Computer Science]]. DEC was the primary sponsor for this project, which was a contemporary of the [[GNU Project]] but not associated with it.\n\nIn the period 1994\u201399 [[Linus Torvalds]] developed versions of Linux on early [[AlphaServer]] systems made available to him by the engineering department.{{Disputed inline|Linux_not_DEC-accomplishment|date=August 2014}} Compaq software engineers developed special Linux kernel modules.<ref>[http://www.informatica.co.cr/linux/research/1999/0302-a.htm Compaq was actively participating during the period 1994\u201399 into the Linux development], verified July 2014</ref> A well-known [[Linux distribution]] that ran on AlphaServer systems was [[Red Hat]] 7.2.<ref>[http://www.informatica.co.cr/linux/research/2002/0108.htm Red Hat and Compaq Announce Port of Red Hat Linux 7.2 to Compaq's Alpha Processors (8 January 2002)], verified July 2014</ref> Another distribution that ran on Alpha was [[Gentoo Linux]].\n\n[[Notes-11]] and its follow-on product, {{anchor|VAX_Notes}}[[VAX Notes]], were two of the first examples of online collaboration software, a category that has become to be known as [[Collaborative software|groupware]]. [[Len Kawell]], one of the original Notes-11 developers later joined [[Lotus Development Corporation]] and contributed to their [[Lotus Notes]] product.\n\nDEC was one of the first businesses connected to the Internet, with ''dec.com'', registered in 1985,<ref>[http://research.microsoft.com/Users/gbell/Digital/timeline/1985-6.htm dec.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> being one of the first of the now ubiquitous ''.com'' domains. DEC's ''gatekeeper.dec.com'' was a well-known [[software repository]] during the pre-[[WWW|World Wide Web]] days, and DEC was also the first computer vendor to open a public website, on 1 October 1993.<ref>[http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9402&L=dectei-l&T=0&P=200 DECTEI-L Archives&nbsp;\u2013 February 1994 (#2)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The popular [[AltaVista]], created by DEC, was one of the first comprehensive Internet [[Search engine (computing)|search engines]]. (Although [[Lycos]] was earlier, it was much more limited.)\n\nDEC invented [[Digital Linear Tape]] (DLT), formerly known as CompacTape, which began as a compact backup medium for MicroVAX systems, and later grew to capacities of 800 gigabytes.\n\nWork on the first hard-disk-based MP3-player, the [[Personal Jukebox]], started at the [[DEC Systems Research Center]]. (The project was started about a month before the merger into [[Compaq]] was completed.)\n\nDEC's Western Research Lab created the [[Itsy Pocket Computer]]. This was developed into the Compaq [[iPaq]] line of [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], which replaced the [[Compaq Aero]] PDA.\n\n[[Digital Federal Credit Union]] (DCU) is a [[credit union]] which was chartered in 1979 for employees of DEC. Today its field of membership is open to existing family members, over 900 different sponsors, several communities in Massachusetts and several organizations. DCU has over 700 different sponsors, including the companies that acquired pieces of DEC.\n\nDEC once held the [[Classful network|Class A]] [[IP address]] block 16.0.0.0/8.<ref>[[List of assigned /8 IPv4 address blocks]]</ref>\n\n== User organizations ==\n\nOriginally the [[users' group]] was called [[DECUS]] (Digital Equipment Computer User Society) during the 1960s to 1990s. When [[Compaq]] acquired DEC in 1998, the users group was renamed CUO, the Compaq Users' Organisation. When [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] acquired [[Compaq]] in 2002, CUO became [[HP-Interex]], although there are still DECUS groups in several countries. In the United States, the organization is represented by the [[Encompass]] organization; currently [[Connect (users group)|Connect]].\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* (''Present''), [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/digital/DEC%201957%20to%20Present%201978.pdf \"Digital Equipment Corporation: Nineteen Fifty-Seven to the Present\"], DEC Press, 1978\n* {{cite book| author = David Donald Miller| title = Open Vms Operating System Concepts| url = https://books.google.com/?id=FSX5qUthRL8C| year = 1997| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-1-55558-157-2 }}\n* {{cite book| author = Alan R.

The band was one of the first American hardcore bands to make a significant impact in the United Kingdom.\n\nDead Kennedys' lyrics were usually political in nature, satirizing establishment political figures (liberal and conservative) and authority in general, as well as popular culture and even the punk movement itself. During their initial incarnation between 1978 and 1986, they attracted considerable controversy for their provocative lyrics and artwork. Several stores refused to stock their recordings, provoking debate about censorship in rock music; in the mid 1980s, vocalist and primary lyricist [[Jello Biafra]] became an active campaigner against the [[Parents Music Resource Center]]. This culminated in an obscenity trial between 1985 and 1986, which resulted in a [[hung jury]].\n\nThe group released a total of four studio albums and one EP before disbanding in 1986. Following the band's dissolution, Biafra continued to collaborate and record with other artists including [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]], [[NoMeansNo]] and his own bands [[Lard (band)|Lard]] and the [[Guantanamo School of Medicine]], as well as releasing several spoken word performances.\n\nIn 2000 (upheld on appeal in 2003), Jello Biafra lost an acrimonious legal case initiated by his former Dead Kennedys band mates over songwriting credits and unpaid royalties. In 2001, the band reformed without Biafra; various singers have since been recruited for vocal duties.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation of the band (1978\u201379)===\nDead Kennedys formed in June 1978 in [[San Francisco, California]], when [[East Bay Ray]] (Raymond Pepperell) advertised for bandmates in the newspaper ''[[The Recycler]]'', after seeing a [[ska-punk]] show at [[Mabuhay Gardens]] in San Francisco. The original band lineup consisted of [[Jello Biafra]] (Eric Reed Boucher) on vocals, East Bay Ray on guitar, [[Klaus Flouride]] (Geoffrey Lyall) on bass, [[Carlos Cadona|6025]] (Carlos Cadona) on rhythm guitar and [[Ted (musician)|Ted]] (Bruce Slesinger) on drums and percussion. This lineup recorded their [[The 1978 Demos|first demos]]. Their first live show was on July 19, 1978 at Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco, California. They were the opening act on a bill that included DV8 and Negative Trend with The Offs headlining.\n\nDead Kennedys played numerous shows at local venues afterwards. Due to the provocative name of the band, they sometimes played under pseudonyms, including \"The DK's\", \"The Sharks\", \"The Creamsicles\" and \"The Pink Twinkies\". The band's real name generated controversy. ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' columnist [[Herb Caen]] wrote in November 1978, \"Just when you think tastelessness has reached its [[nadir]], along comes a punk rock group called 'The Dead Kennedys', which will play at Mabuhay Gardens on Nov. 22, the 15th anniversary of [[John F. Kennedy's assassination]].\" Despite mounting protests, the owner of Mabuhay declared, \"I can't cancel them NOW\u2014there's a contract. Not, apparently, the kind of contract some people have in mind.\"<ref>Caen, Herb (November 17, 1978) \"On the Rotunda.\" ''San Francisco Chronicle.''</ref> However, despite popular belief, the name was not meant to insult the Kennedy family, but according to Biafra, \"to bring attention to the end of the American Dream\".<ref>Pfeiffer.</ref>\n\n6025 left the band in March 1979 under somewhat unclear circumstances, generally considered to be musical differences. In June, the band released their first single, \"[[California \u00dcber Alles]]\", on Biafra and East Bay Ray's [[independent label]], [[Alternative Tentacles]]. The band followed with a poorly attended [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] tour, being a new and fairly unknown band at the time, without a full album release.\n\n===''Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables'' (1980\u201381)===\n[[File:Dead-kennedys-live.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A live performance photo.]]\nIn early 1980, they recorded and released the single \"[[Holiday in Cambodia]]\". In June, the band recorded their debut album, ''[[Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables]]'', released in September of that year. The album reached number 33 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].\n\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Pullmystrings.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Dead Kennedys at the Bay Area Music Awards]] -->On March 25, 1980, Dead Kennedys were invited to perform at the [[Bay Area Music Awards]] in an effort to give the event some \"new wave credibility\", in the words of the organizers. The day of the performance was spent practicing the song they were asked to play, the underground hit \"California \u00dcber Alles\". The band became the talking point of the ceremony when after about 15 seconds into the song, Biafra stopped the band\u2014in a manner reminiscent of [[Radio Radio#1977 Saturday Night Live appearance|Elvis Costello's ''Saturday Night Live'' appearance]]\u2014and said, \"Hold it! We've gotta prove that we're adults now. We're not a punk rock band, we're a [[New wave music|new wave]] band.\" The band, all wearing white shirts with a big, black S painted on the front, pulled black ties from around the backs of their necks to form a dollar sign, then started playing a new song titled \"Pull My Strings\", a barbed, [[Satire|satirical]] attack on the ethics of the mainstream music industry, which contained the lyrics, \"Is my cock big enough, is my brain small enough, for you to make me a star?\". The song also referenced [[The Knack]]'s song \"[[My Sharona]]\". \"Pull My Strings\" was never recorded for a studio release, though the performance at the Bay Area Music Awards, which was the only time the song was ever performed, was released on the band's compilation album ''[[Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death]]''.\n\nIn January 1981, Ted announced that he wanted to leave to pursue a career in architecture and would help look for a replacement. He played his last concert in February 1981. His replacement was [[D.H. Peligro]] (Darren Henley). Around the same time, East Bay Ray had tried to pressure the rest of the band to sign to the major record label [[Polydor Records]]; Biafra stated that he was prepared to leave the group if the rest of the band wanted to sign to the label,<ref name=\"polydor\">Nardwuar the Human Serviette, December 2005 interview with Jello Biafra and The Melvins, as reproduced in [http://www.alternativetentacles.com/batcasts/batcast-013-2006_04_25.m4a Alternative Tentacles Batcast No.&nbsp;15, April 25, 2006]</ref> though East Bay Ray asserts that he recommended against signing with Polydor. Polydor decided not to sign the band after they learned that Dead Kennedys' next single was to be entitled \"[[Too Drunk to Fuck]]\".\n\nWhen \"Too Drunk to Fuck\" came out in May 1981, the song caused much controversy in the UK as the BBC feared the single would reach the Top 30; this would require a mention of the song on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. It was never played although it was called \"'Too Drunk' by the Kennedys\" by presenter [[Tony Blackburn]].\n\n===''In God We Trust, Inc.'', ''Plastic Surgery Disasters'' and Alternative Tentacles Records (1981\u201385)===\nAfter Peligro joined the band, the extended play ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]'' (1981) saw them move toward a more aggressive hardcore/thrash sound. In addition to the EP's controversial artwork depicting a gold Christ figure on a cross of dollar bills, the lyrics contained Biafra's most biting social and political commentary yet, and songs such as \"[[Moral Majority]]\", \"[[Nazi Punks Fuck Off!]]\" and \"[[California \u00dcber Alles|We've Got a Bigger Problem Now]]\" placed Dead Kennedys as the spokesmen of social protest, while \"Dog Bite\", a cover version of ''[[Rawhide (song)|Rawhide]]'' and various joke introductions showed a much more whimsical side. In 1982, they released their second studio album, ''[[Plastic Surgery Disasters]]''. The album's cover features a withered starving African child's hand being held and dwarfed by a white man's hand, a picture that had won the World Press Photo award in 1980, taken in Karamoja district in Uganda by Mike Wells.\n\nThe band's music had evolved considerably in a short time, moving away from hardcore formulae toward a more innovative jazz-informed style, featuring musicianship and dynamics far beyond other bands in the genre (thus effectively removing the music from that genre). By now the group had become a de facto political force, pitting itself against rising elements of American social and political life such as the religious right, Ronald Reagan and the idle rich. The band continued touring all over the United States, as well as Europe and Australia, and gained a large underground following. While they continued to play live shows during 1983 and 1984, they took a break from releasing new records to concentrate on the [[Alternative Tentacles]] record label, which would become synonymous with DIY alternative culture. The band continued to write and perform new material during this time, which would appear on their next album (some of these early performances can be seen in the ''[[DMPO's on Broadway]]'' video, originally released by [[Dirk Dirksen]] and later reissued on Rhino).\n\n===''Frankenchrist'' and obscenity trial (1985\u201386)===\nThe release of the album ''[[Frankenchrist]]'' in 1985 showed the band had grown in musical proficiency and lyrical maturity. While there were still a number of loud/fast songs, much of the music featured an eclectic mix of instruments including trumpets and synthesizers. Around this time [[Klaus Flouride]] released the similarly experimental solo EP ''[[Cha Cha Cha With Mr. Flouride]]''. Lyrically, the band continued their trademark social commentary, with songs such as \"MTV Get Off The Air\" and \"Jock-O-Rama (Invasion of the Beef Patrol)\" poking fun at mainstream America.\n\nHowever, the controversy that erupted over H.R. Giger's \"[[Penis Landscape]]\", included as an insert with the album, dwarfed the notoriety of its music. The artwork caused a furor with the newly formed [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (PMRC). In December 1985 a teenage girl purchased the album at the Wherehouse Records store in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]].<ref name=WishniaNation>Wishnia, Steven. \"Of Punk and Pornography: Rockin' With the First Amendment\".

The store where the teen actually purchased the album was never named in the lawsuit.<ref name=WishniaNation/> The criminal charges focused on an illustration by [[H.R. Giger]], titled \"Work 219: Landscape XX\" (also known as ''[[Penis Landscape]]'').

Biafra says that during this time government agents invaded and searched his home. The prosecution tried to present the poster to the jury in isolation for consideration as obscene material, but Judge Susan Isacoff ruled that the poster must be considered along with the music and lyrics.<ref>[http://www.metnews.com/articles/2004/reti052804.htm \"Judge Isacoff, Commissioner Duffey Slate July Retirements\"] ''Metropolitan News-Enterprise''.

Biafra was on the show with [[Tipper Gore]] as part of a panel discussion on the issues of \"controversial music lyrics\" and censorship.<ref>{{Citation|last=North-Eastern Punx|title=Jello Biafra The Oprah Winfrey Show|date=2017-05-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNoEWol1wbg|access-date=2018-08-19}}</ref>\n\n===''Bedtime for Democracy'' and break-up (1986)===\nIn addition to the obscenity lawsuit, the band became increasingly disillusioned with the underground scene as well. The hardcore scene, which had been a haven for free-thinking intellectuals and downtrodden nonconformists, was attracting a more violent audience that imposed an increasing level of brutality on other concertgoers and began to alienate many of the bands and individuals who had helped pioneer the movement in the early 1980s{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. In earlier years the band had criticized neo-Nazi skinheads for trying to ruin the punk scene, but just as big a problem was the popularity of increasingly macho hardcore bands, which brought the group (and their genre) an audience that had little to do with the ideas/ideals they stood for{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. In January 1986, frustrated and alienated from their own scene, Dead Kennedys decided to break up to pursue other interests and played their last concert on February 21. The band continued to work on songs, with Biafra penning songs such as \"[[Bedtime for Democracy|Chickenshit Conformist]]\" and \"[[Bedtime for Democracy|Anarchy for Sale]]\", which articulated their feelings about the \"dumbing down\" of punk rock.\n\nDuring the summer they recorded these songs for their final album, ''[[Bedtime for Democracy]]'', which was released in November. The artwork, depicting a defaced [[Statue of Liberty]] overrun with Nazis, media, opportunists, Klan members, corrupt government officials, and religious zombies, echoed the idea that neither America itself or the punk scene were safe havens any more for \"your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free\". The album contains a number of fast/short songs interspersed with jazz (\"D.M.S.O.\"), spoken word (\"A Commercial\") and psychedelia (\"Cesspools In Eden\"). The lyrical focus is more introspective and earnest (\"Where Do Ya Draw The Line?\"), with an anti-war, anti-violence (\"Rambozo The Clown\") bend, moving away from the violent imagery of their early records, while remaining as subversive as ever (\"I Spy\", \"D.M.S.O.\"). In December, the band announced their split. Biafra went on to speak about his political beliefs on numerous television shows and he released a number of [[spoken-word]] albums. Ray, Flouride, and Peligro also went on to solo careers.\n\n===Reforming of new band line-up===\nIn 2001, Ray, Peligro, and Flouride reformed the Dead Kennedys, with former [[Dr. Know (band)|Dr. Know]] singer [[Brandon Cruz]] replacing Biafra on vocals. The band played under the name \"DK Kennedys\" for a few concerts, but later reverted to \"Dead Kennedys\" permanently. They played across the continental United States, Europe, Asia, South America, and Russia. Brandon Cruz left the band in May 2003 and was replaced by [[Jeff Penalty]]. The band has released two live albums of archival performances on Manifesto Records: ''[[Mutiny on the Bay]]'', compiled from various live shows including a recording from their last show with Biafra in 1986, and ''[[Live at the Deaf Club]]'', a recording of a 1979 performance at the Deaf Club in [[San Francisco]] which was greeted with more enthusiasm.\n\nOn October 9, 2007, a [[greatest hits album|best of album]] titled ''[[Milking the Sacred Cow]]'' was released. It includes two previously unreleased live versions of \"Soup Is Good Food\" and \"Jock-O-Rama\", originally found on ''Frankenchrist''.\n\nJeff Penalty left the band in March 2008 in what he describes as a \"not amicable split.\"<ref name=Penalty>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/28168 |title=Jeff Penalty leaves the Dead Kennedys |work=Punknews.org |date= |accessdate=July 17, 2011}}</ref> In a statement released, Jeff said that, following a series of disputes, the band had secretly recruited a new singer and played a gig in his neighbourhood, although he also stated he was \"really proud of what we were able to accomplish with Dead Kennedys\".<ref name=Penalty/> He was replaced by former [[Wynona Riders]] singer Ron \"Skip\" Greer.

In 2015 and 2016 they toured again, including South America, where they had not played since 2001.\n\nIn 2017, East Bay Ray revealed that the band and Jello Biafra had been approached by the Punk-oriented music festival [[Riot Fest]] about a potential reunion. While Ray and the rest of the band expressed interest in the concept, Biafra refused.\n\n==Conflicts between members==\n=== Royalties lawsuit ===\nIn the late 1990s, former band members discovered problems with the payment of royalties they had received from [[Alternative Tentacles]]. East Bay Ray, Klaus Flouride, and D. H. Peligro claimed that Jello Biafra had conspired to pay lower royalty rates. Although both sides agreed that the failure to pay these royalties was an accounting mistake, the other members were upset that Biafra failed to inform them of the mistake after he and his co-workers discovered it and additionally claimed he intended to use the money against them.<ref>{{cite web |quote=Biafra concealed from the other Decay Music partners an underpayment of royalties (totaling over $110,000, with interest) by ATR to Decay Music dating back to 1989.  When, in early 1998, ATR\u2019s then-General Manager, Kristin Von Till, brought the underpayment directly to his attention, Biafra hid the indebtedness from his partners and embarked on a course intended to prevent them from learning or confirming that ATR owed Decay Music these monies. |url=http://www.deadkennedysnews.com/news082802_2.htm#f |title=Biafra\u2019s Deception About Underpayment of Royalties. |accessdate=February 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nA jury found Biafra and Alternative Tentacles \"guilty of [[malice (legal term)|malice]], oppression and [[fraud]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/jello-biafra-gets-shot-down-by-dead-kennedys/|title=Jello Biafra Gets Shot Down By Dead Kennedys|date=June 19, 2003|work=blabbermouth.net}}</ref> Malice was defined for the jury as \"conduct which is intended to cause injury or despicable conduct which is carried with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights of others\".<ref name=\"bs1\">{{cite web|url=http://mi2n.com/press.php3?press_nb=17130 |title=''Music Industry News Network'' |publisher=Mi2n.com |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref> Biafra's appeal was denied; he had to pay the outstanding royalties and punitive damages,<ref>[http://www.phillaw.com/casepdfs/Dead%20Kennedys%20Superior%20Court.pdf Dead Kennedys v.

The jury and judges also noted, in their words, that Biafra \"lacked credibility\" on the songwriting issue and found from evidence presented by both sides that the songwriting credits were due to the entire band.<ref>FN4, [http://www.phillaw.com/casepdfs/Dead%20Kennedys%20Superior%20Court.pdf Dead Kennedys v.

Biafra claims that East Bay Ray had long expressed displeasure with Alternative Tentacles and with the amount of money he received from them, thus the original incentive for the discovery of the back payments. It was found out that Alternative Tentacles was paying Dead Kennedys less per CD than all the other bands, including Biafra himself, and not informing his other bandmates, which was the fraud. Biafra accused the band of wanting to license the famous Dead Kennedys song \"[[Holiday in Cambodia]]\" for use in a [[Levi's]] jeans commercial, which the band denied.<ref name=\"morphizm.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.morphizm.com/recommends/jello2.html |title=\"I'm Not an Ad Man:\" Interview with Jello Biafra (con.) |publisher=Morphizm.com |date= |accessdate=February 7, 2013}}</ref> However, an instrumental loop from \"Holiday in Cambodia\" was part of the 1981 movie \"Neighbors,\" but wasn't included on the soundtrack.\n\nBiafra's former bandmates maintain that they sued because of Jello Biafra's deliberate withholding of money, though when pressed they have acknowledged that the payment was an accounting mistake, but insist that Biafra was wrong in failing to inform the band directly. Details about this issue remain scarce. The band also maintains that the Levi's story was completely fictitious and invented by Biafra to discredit them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/48637/interviews-jello-biafra |title=''Punk News Network Interviews: Jello Biafra'' |publisher=punknews.org |date=August 24, 2012 |accessdate=August 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Disputes over new commercial activities===\n\nMatters were stirred up even further when the three bandmates invited Jello Biafra to \"bury the hatchet\" in the form of a band reunion. Jello Biafra felt it was unprofessional because no one contacted him directly. In addition, Biafra was disdainful of the reunion, and having long expressed his disdain for nostalgia and rock reunion/oldies tours in particular, argued that the whole affair was motivated by greed.<ref name=\"morphizm.com\"/>\n\nSeveral DVDs, re-issues, and live albums have been released since the departure of Biafra most recently on Manifesto Records. According to Biafra, the live albums are \"cash-ins\" on Dead Kennedys' name and his music. Biafra also accused the releases of the new live material of having poor sound quality. Furthermore he has stated he is not receiving any royalties from the sale of any Manifesto Records releases. Consequently, he has discouraged fans from buying any Dead Kennedy reissues. The other band members denied Biafra's accusations regarding the live releases, and have defended the mixes as an effort of hard work. Biafra dismissed the new group as \"the world's greediest karaoke band.\" Nevertheless, in 2003, [[Klaus Flouride]] said of performances without the band's former frontman: \"There hasn't been a show yet that people didn't really like.\"<ref>[http://www.citizinemag.com/music/music-0309_klausflouride.htm \"Interview with Dead Kennedys' Klaus Flouride\"] by Mark Prindle, ''Citizine'', September 1, 2003</ref>\n\nBiafra further criticized them for advertising shows using his own image taken from the original 1980s incarnation of the band, which he labeled as false advertising. He attacked the reformed Dead Kennedys in a song called \"[[Those Dumb Punk Kids (Will Buy Anything)]]\", which appears on his second collaboration with sludge metal band the [[Melvins]], ''[[Sieg Howdy!]]''.\n\nBiafra told an audience at a speaking gig in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[New Jersey]], that the remaining Dead Kennedys have licensed their single \"Too Drunk to Fuck\" to be used in a rape scene in a [[Robert Rodriguez]] movie. The reference is to a lounge cover of the song, recorded by the band [[Nouvelle Vague (band)|Nouvelle Vague]], played during a scene in the ''[[Planet Terror]]'' segment of ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'', although no rape takes place, and in fact the would-be rapist is killed by the would-be victim. The scene in ''Planet Terror'' has would-be rapist, \"Rapist No.&nbsp;1\" ([[Quentin Tarantino]]) order one-legged stripper \"Cherry Darlin\" ([[Rose McGowan]]) to get up off the floor and dance. At this point Tarantino hits play on a cassette recorder and Nouvelle Vague's cover of \"Too Drunk To Fuck\" plays.\n\nJello, clearly disapproving of the situation, later wrote, \"This is their lowest point since Levi's... This goes against everything the Dead Kennedys stands for in spades... The terrified woman later 'wins' by killing Tarantino, but that excuse does not rescue this at all. I wrote every note of that song and this is not what it was meant for.... Some people will do anything for money. I can't help but think back to how prudish Klaus Flouride was when he objected to H.R. Giger's painting on the \"[[Frankenchrist]]\" (sic) poster, saying he couldn't bear to show it to his parents. I'd sure love to be a fly on the wall when he tries to explain putting a song in a rape scene for money to his teenage daughter... The deal was pushed through by a new business manager the other three hired.\"<ref>[http://www.alternativetentacles.com/news.php?page=3&news_section=JELLO&window_size=15&sd=iIdfyzSpZwkE0A3pVRu \"Greedy ex-DKs okay song for rape scene in new Tarantino Movie\"] Alternative Tentacles news page, March 15, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe reformed Dead Kennedys followed their court victory by releasing reissues of all Dead Kennedys albums (except ''[[Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables]]'', to which they did not have the rights until 2005), releasing several new archival concert DVDs, and licensing several songs to ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (2004 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' remake and the [[Tony Hawk Pro Skater]] video game. [[East Bay Ray]] claims he received a fax from Alternative Tentacles purporting Biafra approved the licensing for the game.<ref>[http://www.deadkennedysnews.com/images/tonyhawk.jpg Fax from Uli Elser], previous manager of Alternative Tentacles, May 5, 1999</ref>\n\nThe band claims on their website that they still pay close attention to an [[anti-corporate]] ideology, despite performing on September 5, 2003 at a festival in Turkey that was sponsored by [[Coca-Cola]], noting that they have since pulled out of a show in Los Angeles when they found that it was being sponsored by [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]].<ref>\"[http://www.deadkennedys.com/news.htm#100605 DKs Pull Out of \"Waking the Dead\" Show]\" ''DeadKennedys.com''. October 6, 2005.</ref> However, Biafra claims the above mentioned licensing deals prove otherwise. Some have found difficulty reconciling this claim when Biafra also licensed to major corporations, approving with the other band members use of Dead Kennedys\u2019 songs in major studio film releases such as ''[[Neighbors (1981 film)|Neighbors]]'', ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'', and ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]''.<ref>{{IMDb name|1389065}}</ref>\n\n==Logo==\n[[File:Dead Kennedys (logo).jpg|thumb|right|70px|\"DK\" logo]]The original logo was created by [[Winston Smith (artist)|Winston Smith]]. He later contributed artwork for the covers of ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]'', ''[[Plastic Surgery Disasters]]'', ''[[Frankenchrist]]'', ''[[Bedtime for Democracy]]'', ''[[Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death]]'', the back cover of the \"[[Kill the Poor]]\" single and the [[Alternative Tentacles]] logo. When asked about the \"DK\" logo in an interview, Jello Biafra explained, \"...I wanted to make sure it was something simple and easy to spray-paint so people would graffiti it all over the place, and then I showed it to Winston Smith. He played around with it, came back with a bunch of designs that had the circle and slightly 3-D looking letters and he had ones with different patterns behind it. I liked the one with bricks, but ultimately I thought simple red behind it was the boldest and the best.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trembleunderboomlights.blogspot.com/2007/05/interview-with-jello-biafra.html |title=Tremble Under Boom Lights: Interview with Jello Biafra |publisher=Trembleunderboomlights.blogspot.com |date=May 6, 2007 |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nDead Kennedys have been described as a [[hardcore punk]] band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dead-kennedys-mn0000786613/biography |title=Dead Kennedys {{!}} Biography & History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref> Dead Kennedys were noted for the harshness of their lyrics, which generally combined biting [[Satire#Juvenalian|Juvenalian]] social satire while expressing a staunchly left-wing view of contemporary America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.msn.com/music/artist/dead-kennedys.1/ |title=Dead Kennedys on MSN Music |publisher=Music.msn.com |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref> Unlike other leftist punk bands who use more direct sloganeering, Dead Kennedys' lyrics were often snide.

DNA and [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA) are [[nucleic acid]]s; alongside [[protein]]s, [[lipids]] and complex carbohydrates ([[polysaccharide]]s), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of [[macromolecule]]s that are essential for all known forms of [[life]].\n\nThe two DNA strands are also known as [[polynucleotide]]s since they are composed of simpler [[monomer]]ic units called [[nucleotide]]s.<ref>{{Cite book |vauthors= Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P |title= Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition= 6th |publisher= Garland |year= 2014 |url= http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815344322 |page= Chapter 4: DNA, Chromosomes and Genomes |isbn= 9780815344322 |deadurl= no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210549/http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815344322 |archive-date= 14 July 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Purcell|first1=Adam|name-list-format=vanc|title=DNA|url=http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna|website=Basic Biology|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105045651/http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna/|archive-date=5 January 2017}}</ref> Each nucleotide is composed of one of four [[nitrogenous base|nitrogen-containing]] [[nucleobase]]s ([[cytosine]] [C], [[guanine]] [G], [[adenine]] [A] or [[thymine]] [T]), a [[monosaccharide|sugar]] called [[deoxyribose]], and a [[Organophosphate|phosphate group]]. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by [[covalent bond]]s between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating [[backbone chain|sugar-phosphate backbone]]. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to [[base pair]]ing rules (A with T and C with G), with [[hydrogen bond]]s to make double-stranded DNA.\n\nThe complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, [[pyrimidine]]s and [[purine]]s. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine; the purines are adenine and guanine.\n\nDNA stores biological [[information]]. The DNA [[Backbone chain|backbone]] is resistant to [[Bond cleavage|cleavage]], and both strands of the double-stranded structure store the same biological information. This information is replicated as and when the two strands separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is [[non-coding DNA|non-coding]], meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences.\n\nThe two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]]. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, ''bases''). It is the [[Nucleic acid sequence|sequence]] of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic information. [[RNA]] strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. Under the [[genetic code]], these [[RNA]] strands are translated to specify the sequence of [[amino acid]]s within proteins in a process called [[translation (genetics)|translation]].\n\nWithin eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into long structures called [[chromosome]]s. Before typical [[cell division]], these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of [[DNA replication]], providing a complete set of chromosomes for each daughter cell. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic organisms]] ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[protist]]s) store most of their DNA inside the [[cell nucleus]] and some of their DNA in [[organelle]]s, such as [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] or [[chloroplast]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last= Russell |first= Peter | name-list-format = vanc | title= iGenetics |publisher= Benjamin Cummings |location= New York |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-8053-4553-1}}</ref> In contrast, [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]) store their DNA only in the [[cytoplasm]]. Within eukaryotic chromosomes, [[chromatin]] proteins, such as [[histone]]s, compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.\n\nDNA was first isolated by [[Friedrich Miescher]] in 1869. Its molecular structure was first identified by [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] within the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by [[X-ray diffraction]] data acquired by [[Raymond Gosling]], who was a post-graduate student of [[Rosalind Franklin]]. DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the [[ergodic theorem]] and the theory of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and nano-fabrication. Among notable advances in this field are [[DNA origami]] and DNA-based hybrid materials.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mashaghi A, Katan A |title=A physicist's view of DNA |journal=De Physicus|volume=24e |issue=3 |pages=59\u201361 |year=2013 |arxiv= 1311.2545v1 |bibcode=2013arXiv1311.2545M}}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n[[File:DNA chemical structure.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Chemical structure of DNA; [[hydrogen bond]]s shown as dotted lines]]\n\nDNA is a long [[polymer]] made from repeating units called [[nucleotide]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last= Saenger |first= Wolfram | name-list-format = vanc |title= Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure |publisher= Springer-Verlag |location= New York |year= 1984 |isbn= 0-387-90762-9}}</ref><ref name=\"Alberts\">{{cite book | last1 = Alberts | first1 = Bruce | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Alexander | last3 = Lewis | first3 = Julian | last4 = Raff | first4 = Martin | last5 = Roberts | first5 = Keith | first6 = Walters | last6 = Peter | name-list-format = vanc | title = Molecular Biology of the Cell | edition = Fourth | publisher = Garland Science | year = 2002 | location = New York and London | isbn = 0-8153-3218-1 | oclc = 145080076 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/ | deadurl = no | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161101022040/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/ | archive-date = 1 November 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The structure of DNA is dynamic along its length, being capable of coiling into tight loops, and other shapes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Irobalieva RN, Fogg JM, Catanese DJ, Catanese DJ, Sutthibutpong T, Chen M, Barker AK, Ludtke SJ, Harris SA, Schmid MF, Chiu W, Zechiedrich L | title = Structural diversity of supercoiled DNA | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 6 | pages = 8440 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26455586 | pmc = 4608029 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms9440 | bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E8440I }}</ref> In all species it is composed of two helical chains, bound to each other by [[hydrogen bonds]].

The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form [[phosphodiester bond]]s between the third and fifth carbon [[atom]]s of adjacent sugar rings, which are known as the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 carbons, the prime symbol being used to distinguish these carbon atoms from those of the base to which the deoxyribose forms a glycosidic bond. When imagining DNA, each phosphoryl is normally considered to \"belong\" to the nucleotide whose 5\u2032 carbon forms a bond therewith. Any DNA strand therefore normally has one end at which there is a phosphoryl attached to the 5\u2032 carbon of a ribose (the 5\u2032 phosphoryl) and another end at which there is a free hydroxyl attached to the 3\u2032 carbon of a ribose (the 3\u2032 hydroxyl). The orientation of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 carbons along the sugar-phosphate backbone confers directionality (sometimes called polarity) to each DNA strand. In a double helix, the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are ''antiparallel''. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a [[directionality (molecular biology)|directionality]] of ''five prime'' (5\u2032) and ''three prime'' (3\u2032), with the 5\u2032 end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3\u2032 end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and [[RNA]] is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar [[ribose]] in RNA.<ref name=berg/>\n\n[[File:DNA orbit animated static thumb.png|thumb|upright|A section of DNA.

The two strands can come apart&nbsp;\u2013 a process known as melting&nbsp;\u2013 to form two single-stranded DNA ('''ssDNA''') molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high [[pH]] (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).\n\nThe stability of the dsDNA form depends not only on the GC-content (% G,C basepairs) but also on sequence (since stacking is sequence specific) and also length (longer molecules are more stable). The stability can be measured in various ways; a common way is the \"melting temperature\", which is the temperature at which 50% of the ds molecules are converted to ss molecules; melting temperature is dependent on ionic strength and the concentration of DNA. As a result, it is both the percentage of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines the strength of the association between the two strands of DNA.

[[Transmission (genetics)|Transmission]] of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing.

Usually, this RNA copy is then used to make a matching [[Peptide sequence|protein sequence]] in a process called [[Translation (biology)|translation]], which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides.

Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a [[messenger RNA]] sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the [[amino acid|amino-acid]] sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of [[Translation (biology)|translation]], known collectively as the [[genetic code]]. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called ''codons'' formed from a sequence of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).\n\nIn transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by [[RNA polymerase]]. This RNA copy is then decoded by a [[ribosome]] that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to [[transfer RNA]], which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (4<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;combinations). These encode the twenty [[list of standard amino acids|standard amino acids]], giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAA, TGA, and TAG codons.\n\n[[File:DNA replication en.svg|thumb|upright=2.05|right|DNA replication. The double helix is unwound by a [[helicase]] and [[topoisomerase]]. Next, one [[DNA polymerase]] produces the [[Replication fork|leading strand]] copy. Another DNA polymerase binds to the [[Replication fork|lagging strand]]. This enzyme makes discontinuous segments (called [[Okazaki fragment]]s) before [[DNA ligase]] joins them together.]]\n\n===Replication===\n{{further|DNA replication}}\n\n[[Cell division]] is essential for an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for [[DNA replication]]. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's [[complementary DNA]] sequence is recreated by an [[enzyme]] called [[DNA polymerase]]. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Alb\u00e0 M | title = Replicative DNA polymerases | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = REVIEWS3002 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11178285 | pmc = 150442 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2001-2-1-reviews3002 | nopp = true }}</ref> In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.\n\n===Extracellular nucleic acids===\nNaked extracellular DNA (eDNA), most of it released by cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment.

The most frequently used nucleases in [[molecular biology]] are the [[restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]], which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5\u2032-GATATC-3\u2032 and makes a cut at the horizontal line.

To preserve biological information, it is essential that the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a [[Proofreading (biology)|proofreading]] activity.

The first Kennedy elected to public office was [[P. J. Kennedy|Patrick Joseph \"P. J.\" Kennedy]] in 1884, 35 years after the family's arrival from [[Ireland]]. He served in the Massachusetts state legislature from 1884 to 1895. At least one Kennedy family member served in federal elective office in every year since 1947 until [[Patrick J. Kennedy]] stepped down from his congressional seat in [[Rhode Island]], a span of time comprising more than a quarter of the United States' existence.<ref name=\"bg021310\">{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/rhode_island/articles/2010/02/13/pondering_a_congress_without_kennedys/|title=Pondering a Congress without Kennedys|last=Levenson|first=Michael|date=February 13, 2010|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]}}</ref>\n\nThe descendants of [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.]] and [[Rose Kennedy]] include a [[president of the United States]] (who had also served in [[United States Congress|both houses of Congress]]), a [[Attorney General of the United States|U.S. attorney general]] (who later served in the U.S. Senate), four other members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] or [[United States Senate|Senate]], and two U.S. ambassadors, a lieutenant governor, three state legislators (one of whom went on to the U.S. House of Representatives), and one mayor.\n\nIn addition, Joseph Sr. and Rose's daughter, [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver|Eunice]], founded the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (a part of the [[National Institutes of Health]]), and founded the [[Special Olympics]]. Eunice's daughter [[Maria Shriver]] served as First Lady of California and helped create the California Museum for History, Women and the Arts (now the [http://www.californiamuseum.org/ California Museum]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://governors.library.ca.gov/firstladies/35-Shriver.html|title=Governors of California - Maria Shriver|first=California State|last=Library|website=governors.library.ca.gov}}</ref> Other descendants of Joseph and Rose Kennedy have been active as lawyers, authors, and activists on behalf of those with physical and intellectual challenges.\n\nKennedy in-laws who have served in public office include [[Sargent Shriver]] (married to Eunice Kennedy), United States Ambassador to France from 1968\u20131970 and Democratic nominee for [[Vice President of the United States]] in 1972; [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] (married to Maria Shriver), actor and bodybuilder who served two terms as [[Governor of California]]; and [[Andrew Cuomo]] (married to Kerry Kennedy, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy), [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]] in the Clinton administration and 56th [[Governor of New York]].\n\n==History==\nAccording to genealogist Brian Kennedy in his work ''JFK's Irish O'Kennedy Ancestors'', the Kennedys who would go on to play a significant role in the [[United States of America]] originated from the \u00d3 Cinn\u00e9ide Fionn (one of the three Irish Gaelic [[\u00d3 Cinn\u00e9ide]] clans who ruled the kingdom of Ormond, along with the \u00d3 Cinn\u00e9ide Donn and \u00d3 Cinn\u00e9ide Ruadh). Their progenitor, Diarmaid \u00d3 Cinn\u00e9ide Fionn held Knigh Castle close to what is today [[Puckane]], [[County Tipperary]] in 1546. From there, having lost out to the [[Anglo-Irish people|New English]] order in the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], they ended up in Dunganstown, [[New Ross]], [[County Wexford]] by 1740. It is here that Patrick Kennedy was born in 1823.\n\nThe first Kennedys to reside in the United States were Patrick Kennedy (1823\u20131858) and Bridget Murphy (1824\u20131888), who sailed from Ireland to [[East Boston]] in 1849; Patrick worked in East Boston as a barrel maker, or cooper.<ref name=\"Maier2003\">{{cite book|title=The Kennedys: America's Emerald Kings |first=Thomas |last=Maier|publisher=Basic Books |year=2003 |p={{page needed|date=April 2015}} | isbn=978-0-465-04317-0|ref=harv}}</ref> Patrick and Bridget had five children; their youngest, [[P. J. Kennedy|Patrick Joseph \"P. J.\" Kennedy]], went into business and served in the state Legislature from 1884\u20131895.\n\nP.J. and Mary Augusta Hickey, were the parents of four children. Their oldest was [[Joseph Patrick Kennedy|Joseph Patrick \"Joe\" Kennedy Sr.]],<ref>[http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/The-Kennedy-Family.aspx The Kennedy Family] The JFK Library, accessed Feb 10, 2016</ref> who amassed a fortune in banking and securities trading, which he further expanded by investing in other growing industries. Joseph Sr. was appointed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] as the first chairman of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]], chairman of the [[United States Maritime Commission|Maritime Commission]], and [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] in the [[Causes of World War II|lead-up to World War II]]. He served on The Hoover Commission, officially named the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, from 1947\u20131949; the commission was appointed by President Harry S Truman to recommend administrative changes in the federal government.\n\n==Continued involvement in public service==\nJoseph Sr. and [[Rose Kennedy|Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald]], were the parents of nine children: [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.|Joseph Jr.]], [[John F. Kennedy|John]], [[Rosemary Kennedy|Rosemary]], [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Kathleen]], [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver|Eunice]], [[Patricia Kennedy Lawford|Patricia]], [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]], [[Jean Kennedy Smith|Jean]], and [[Ted Kennedy|Ted]]. John served as the 35th [[President of the United States]], while Robert and Ted both became prominent [[United States Senate|senators]]. Every Kennedy elected to public office has served as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], while other members of the family have worked for the Democratic Party or held [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] posts in Democratic administrations. Many have attended [[Harvard University]], and the family has contributed greatly to that university's [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]].\n\nJoseph Sr. expected his eldest son, Joseph Jr., to go into politics and to ultimately be elected president. Joseph Jr. was elected as a delegate to the [[1940 Democratic National Convention]], and enlisted in the [[United States Navy|Navy]] after the U.S. entered [[World War II]]. Joseph Jr. was killed in 1944 when the bomber he was piloting exploded in flight. It then fell upon John, who had considered a career as a journalist \u2014 he had authored a book and did some reporting for Hearst Newspapers \u2014 to fulfill his father's desire to see the family involved in politics and government. After returning from Navy service, John served in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] from 1947 to 1953, and then as [[List of United States Senators from Massachusetts|U.S. Senator]] until his election as [[United States presidential election, 1960|President]] in 1960. \n\nDuring [[Timeline of the presidency of John F. Kennedy|John's administration]], Robert served as [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]]; brother-in-law, [[Sargent Shriver]], served as director of the new Peace Corps, and Ted [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 1962|was elected to the Senate]]. Among the Kennedy administration's accomplishments: the [[Alliance for Progress]], the [[Peace Corps]], peaceful resolution to the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the [[Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] of 1963, the [[24th Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment]] ending the poll tax, and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref>https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/john-f-kennedy/</ref> The family was the subject of intense media coverage during and after the Kennedy presidency, often emphasizing their relative youth, allure, education, and future in politics. Ted served in the Senate with his brother Robert, and was serving in the Senate when his nephew, Joseph P. II, and son, Patrick J., served in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nIn November 2012, [[Joseph P. Kennedy III]], son of former Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II and grandson of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Massachusetts' 4th Congressional District.\n\n==Family tragedies==\nFamily tragedies led Ted Kennedy to question in 1968 whether there was a \"[[Kennedy curse]]\". In 1941, Rosemary underwent a lobotomy intended to curb behavioral and emotional issues, but the operation left her incapacitated; Joseph Jr. died in 1944 when the Navy bomber he was piloting during World War II exploded in flight; Kathleen died in a plane crash in [[France]] in 1948; [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|John]] and [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]] were assassinated in 1963 and 1968; and a car driven by Ted [[Chappaquiddick incident|went off a bridge and into a channel]] in 1969, resulting in the drowning death of his passenger, [[Mary Jo Kopechne]]. \n\nOf Joseph Sr. and Rose's grandchildren, [[David A. Kennedy]] died of a drug overdose in 1984; [[Michael LeMoyne Kennedy]] died from injuries sustained in a skiing accident in 1997; [[John F. Kennedy Jr.]] [[John F. Kennedy Jr. plane crash|died in a plane crash]] in 1999. [[Kara Kennedy]] survived a bout with lung cancer, but died of a heart attack in 2011.

The English word dates back to the 16th century, from the older [[Middle French]] and [[Middle Latin]] equivalents.\n\nAccording to American political scientist [[Larry Diamond]], democracy consists of four key elements: a political system for choosing and replacing the government through free and fair [[election]]s; the active participation of the people, as citizens, in politics and civic life; protection of the [[human rights]] of all citizens; a [[rule of law]], in which the laws and procedures apply equally to all citizens.<ref>Diamond, L., Lecture at Hilla University for Humanistic Studies 21 January 2004: [http://web.stanford.edu/~ldiamond/iraq/WhaIsDemocracy012004.htm \"What is Democracy\"]; Diamond, L. and Morlino, L., The quality of democracy (2016).

While theoretically these definitions are in opposition, in practice the distinction has been blurred historically.<ref>Wilson, N. G. (2006). ''Encyclopedia of ancient Greece''. New York: Routledge. p. 511. {{ISBN|0-415-97334-1}}.</ref> The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of an elite class, until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the [[suffrage]] movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nDemocracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by an individual, as in an [[absolute monarchy]], or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an [[oligarchy]]. Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy,<ref>{{cite book|last=Barker|first=Ernest|title=The Political Thought of Plato and Aristotle|year=1906|publisher=G. P.

What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects....

Some representative democracies also incorporate elements of direct democracy, such as [[referendum]]s. A characteristic of representative democracy is that while the representatives are elected by the people to act in the people's interest, they retain the freedom to exercise their own judgement as how best to do so. Such reasons have driven criticism upon representative democracy,<ref>{{cite book| last = K\u00f6chler | first = Hans | title = The Crisis of Representative Democracy | publisher = Frankfurt/M., Bern, New York | isbn = 978-3-8204-8843-2 | year = 1987 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Urbinati | first = Nadia | title  = Representative Democracy: Principles and Genealogy | isbn = 978-0226842790 | date = 1 October 2008 | chapter = 2}}</ref> pointing out the contradictions of representation mechanisms with democracy<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Fenichel Pitkin | first = Hanna | title = Representation and democracy: uneasy alliance | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 335\u201342 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2004.00109.x | date = September 2004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Aristotle | title = Politics | volume = Book 4| chapter = Ch. 9 }}</ref>\n\n=====Parliamentary=====\n{{Main|Parliamentary system}}\nParliamentary democracy is a representative democracy where government is appointed by, or can be dismissed by, representatives as opposed to a \"presidential rule\" wherein the president is both head of state and the head of government and is elected by the voters. Under a parliamentary democracy, government is exercised by delegation to an executive ministry and subject to ongoing review, checks and balances by the legislative parliament elected by the people.<ref>Keen, Benjamin, A History of Latin America. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1980.</ref><ref>Kuykendall, Ralph, Hawaii: A History. New York: Prentice Hall, 1948.</ref><ref>Brown, Charles H., The Correspondents' War.

Chicago: Rand McNally & Company, 1963</ref>\n\nParliamentary systems have the right to dismiss a Prime Minister at any point in time that they feel he or she is not doing their job to the expectations of the legislature. This is done through a Vote of No Confidence where the legislature decides whether or not to remove the Prime Minister from office by a majority support for his or her dismissal.<ref name=\"O'Neil, Patrick H 2010\">O'Neil, Patrick H. Essentials of Comparative Politics. 3rd ed. New York: W. W. Norton 2010. Print</ref> In some countries, the Prime Minister can also call an election whenever he or she so chooses, and typically the Prime Minister will hold an election when he or she knows that they are in good favour with the public as to get re-elected. In other parliamentary democracies extra elections are virtually never held, a minority government being preferred until the next ordinary elections. An important feature of the parliamentary democracy is the concept of the \"loyal opposition\". The essence of the concept is that the second largest political party (or coalition) opposes the governing party (or coalition), while still remaining loyal to the state and its democratic principles.\n\n=====Presidential=====\n{{Main|Presidential system}}\nPresidential Democracy is a system where the public elects the president through free and fair elections. The president serves as both the head of state and head of government controlling most of the executive powers. The president serves for a specific term and cannot exceed that amount of time. Elections typically have a fixed date and aren't easily changed. The president has direct control over the cabinet, specifically appointing the cabinet members.<ref name=\"O'Neil, Patrick H 2010\"/>\n\nThe president cannot be easily removed from office by the legislature, but he or she cannot remove members of the legislative branch any more easily. This provides some measure of [[separation of powers]]. In consequence however, the president and the legislature may end up in the control of separate parties, allowing one to block the other and thereby interfere with the orderly operation of the state. This may be the reason why presidential democracy is not very common outside the Americas, Africa, and Central and Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"O'Neil, Patrick H 2010\"/>\n\nA [[semi-presidential system]] is a system of democracy in which the government includes both a prime minister and a president. The particular powers held by the prime minister and president vary by country.<ref name=\"O'Neil, Patrick H 2010\"/>\n\n====Hybrid or semi-direct====\n{{See also|Politics of Switzerland|Voting in Switzerland}}\nSome modern democracies that are predominantly representative in nature also heavily rely upon forms of political action that are directly democratic.

This creates a hybrid form of government, with a local [[direct democracy]] and a state government which is representative. For example, most [[Vermont]] towns hold annual town meetings in March in which town officers are elected, budgets for the town and schools are voted on, and citizens have the opportunity to speak and be heard on political matters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.state.vt.us/townmeeting/citizens_guide.html |title=A Citizen's Guide To Vermont Town Meeting |date=July 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805023214/http://www.sec.state.vt.us/TownMeeting/citizens_guide.html |archivedate=5 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Variants===\n\n====Constitutional monarchy====\n{{main|Constitutional monarchy}}\n[[File:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Queen [[Elizabeth II]], a constitutional monarch]]\n\nMany countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian countries]], [[Thailand]], [[Japan]] and [[Bhutan]] turned powerful monarchs into constitutional monarchs with limited or, often gradually, merely symbolic roles. For example, in the predecessor states to the United Kingdom, constitutional monarchy began to emerge and has continued uninterrupted since the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and passage of the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].<ref name= Kopstein2014/><ref name=refNARoP />\n\nIn other countries, the monarchy was abolished along with the aristocratic system (as in France, China, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Greece and Egypt). An elected president, with or without significant powers, became the head of state in these countries.\n\nElite upper houses of legislatures, which often had lifetime or hereditary tenure, were common in many nations. Over time, these either had their powers limited (as with the British [[House of Lords]]) or else became elective and remained powerful (as with the [[Australian Senate]]).\n\n====Republic====\n{{Main|Republicanism}}\nThe term ''[[republic]]'' has many different meanings, but today often refers to a representative democracy with an elected [[head of state]], such as a [[president]], serving for a limited term, in contrast to states with a hereditary [[monarch]] as a head of state, even if these states also are representative democracies with an elected or appointed [[head of government]] such as a [[Prime Minister|prime minister]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/republic |title=Republic \u2013 Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=M-w.com |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] rarely praised and often criticised democracy, which in their time tended to specifically mean direct democracy, often without the protection of a constitution enshrining basic rights; [[James Madison]] argued, especially in [[Federalist No. 10|''The Federalist'' No. 10]], that what distinguished a direct ''democracy'' from a ''republic'' was that the former became weaker as it got larger and suffered more violently from the effects of faction, whereas a republic could get stronger as it got larger and combats faction by its very structure.\n\nWhat was critical to American values, [[John Adams]] insisted,<ref>Novanglus, no. 7. 6 March 1775</ref> was that the government be \"bound by fixed laws, which the people have a voice in making, and a right to defend.\" As Benjamin Franklin was exiting after writing the U.S. constitution, a woman asked him \"Well, Doctor, what have we got\u2014a republic or a monarchy?\". He replied \"A republic\u2014if you can keep it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch18I.html |title=''The Founders' Constitution: Volume 1, Chapter 18, Introduction'', \"Epilogue: Securing the Republic\" |publisher=Press-pubs.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Liberal democracy====\n{{main|Liberal democracy}}\nA liberal democracy is a representative democracy in which the ability of the elected representatives to exercise decision-making power is subject to the [[rule of law]], and moderated by a constitution or laws that emphasise the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, and which places constraints on the leaders and on the extent to which the will of the majority can be exercised against the rights of minorities (see [[civil liberties]]).\n\nIn a liberal democracy, it is possible for some large-scale decisions to [[Emergent democracy|emerge]] from the many individual decisions that citizens are free to make. In other words, citizens can \"vote with their feet\" or \"vote with their dollars\", resulting in significant informal government-by-the-masses that exercises many \"powers\" associated with formal government elsewhere.\n\n====Socialist====\n{{See also|Democracy in Marxism}}\n\n[[Socialism|Socialist]] thought has several different views on democracy. [[Social democracy]], [[democratic socialism]], and the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (usually exercised through [[Soviet democracy]]) are some examples. Many democratic socialists and social democrats believe in a form of [[participatory democracy|participatory]], [[industrial democracy|industrial]], [[economic democracy|economic]] and/or [[workplace democracy]] combined with a [[representative democracy]].\n\nWithin [[Democracy in Marxist theory|Marxist orthodoxy]] there is a hostility to what is commonly called \"liberal democracy\", which they simply refer to as parliamentary democracy because of its often centralised nature. Because of their desire to eliminate the political elitism they see in capitalism, [[Marxism|Marxists]], [[Leninism|Leninists]] and [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] believe in direct democracy implemented through a system of [[commune (Socialism)|communes]] (which are sometimes called [[Soviet (council)|soviets]]). This system ultimately manifests itself as council democracy and begins with workplace democracy.\n\n{{quote|Democracy cannot consist solely of elections that are nearly always fictitious and managed by rich landowners and professional politicians.|[[Che Guevara]]|Speech, Uruguay, 1961<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1961/08/08.htm \"Economics Cannot be Separated from Politics\"] speech by Che Guevara to the ministerial meeting of the Inter-American Economic and Social Council (CIES), in Punta del Este, Uruguay on August 8, 1961</ref>}}\n\n====Anarchist====\nAnarchists are split in this domain, depending on whether they believe that a [[Tyranny of the majority|majority-rule is tyrannic or not]]. The only form of democracy considered acceptable to many [[Anarchism|anarchists]] is direct democracy. [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] argued that the only acceptable form of direct democracy is one in which it is recognised that majority decisions are not binding on the minority, even when unanimous.<ref>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ''General Idea of the Revolution'' See also commentary by [[Robert Graham (historian)|Graham, Robert]]. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/ANARCHIST_ARCHIVES/proudhon/grahamproudhon.html ''The General Idea of Proudhon's Revolution'']</ref> However, [[anarcho-communist]] [[Murray Bookchin]] criticised [[individualist anarchists]] for opposing democracy,<ref>Bookchin, Murray. Communalism: The Democratic Dimensions of Social Anarchism. Anarchism, Marxism and the Future of the Left: Interviews and Essays, 1993\u20131998, AK Press 1999, p. 155</ref> and says \"majority rule\" is consistent with anarchism.<ref>Bookchin, Murray. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bookchin/soclife.html Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]</ref>\n\nSome anarcho-communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy, feeling that it can impede individual liberty and opt in favour of a non-majoritarian form of [[consensus democracy]], similar to Proudhon's position on direct democracy.<ref>Graeber, David and Grubacic, Andrej. ''Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century''</ref> [[Henry David Thoreau]], who did not self-identify as an anarchist but argued for \"a better government\"<ref name=\"disobedience\">Thoreau, H. D. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/71/71.txt On the Duty of Civil Disobedience]''</ref> and is cited as an inspiration by some anarchists, argued that people should not be in the position of ruling others or being ruled when there is no consent.\n\n====Sortition====\n{{Main|Sortition}}\nSometimes called \"democracy without elections\", [[sortition]] chooses decision makers via a random process. The intention is that those chosen will be representative of the opinions and interests of the people at large, and be more fair and impartial than an elected official. The technique was in widespread use in [[Athenian Democracy]] and [[Republic of Florence|Renaissance Florence]]<ref name=\"Imprint Academic\">{{cite book|last1=Dowlen|first1=Oliver|title=The Political Potential of Sortition: A study of the random selection of citizens for public office|date=2008|publisher=Imprint Academic}}</ref> and is still used in modern [[jury selection]].\n\n====Consociational====\n{{Main|Consociational democracy}}\nA consociational democracy allows for simultaneous majority votes in two or more ethno-religious constituencies, and policies are enacted only if they gain majority support from both or all of them.\n\n====Consensus democracy====\n{{Main| Consensus democracy}}\nA consensus democracy, in contrast, would not be dichotomous. Instead, decisions would be based on a multi-option approach, and policies would be enacted if they gained sufficient support, either in a purely verbal agreement, or via a consensus vote\u2014a multi-option preference vote. If the threshold of support were at a sufficiently high level, minorities would be as it were protected automatically. Furthermore, any voting would be ethno-colour blind.\n\n====Supranational====\n[[Qualified majority voting]] is designed by the [[Treaty of Rome]] to be the principal method of reaching decisions in the [[European Council of Ministers]]. This system allocates votes to member states in part according to their population, but heavily weighted in favour of the smaller states. This might be seen as a form of representative democracy, but representatives to the Council might be appointed rather than directly elected.\n\n====Inclusive====\n{{Youth rights sidebar}}\n{{Main|Inclusive democracy}}\nInclusive democracy is a political theory and political project that aims for [[direct democracy]] in all fields of social life: political democracy in the form of face-to-face assemblies which are confederated, [[economic democracy]] in a [[Stateless society|stateless]], moneyless and marketless economy, democracy in the social realm, i.e. [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] in places of work and education, and ecological democracy which aims to reintegrate society and nature. The theoretical project of inclusive democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher [[Takis Fotopoulos]] in \"Towards An Inclusive Democracy\" and was further developed in the journal ''[[Democracy & Nature]]'' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy''.\n\nThe basic unit of decision making in an inclusive democracy is the demotic assembly, i.e. the assembly of demos, the citizen body in a given geographical area which may encompass a town and the surrounding villages, or even neighbourhoods of large cities. An inclusive democracy today can only take the form of a confederal democracy that is based on a network of administrative councils whose members or delegates are elected from popular face-to-face democratic assemblies in the various demoi. Thus, their role is purely administrative and practical, not one of policy-making like that of representatives in representative democracy.\n\nThe citizen body is advised by experts but it is the citizen body which functions as the ultimate decision-taker . Authority can be delegated to a segment of the citizen body to carry out specific duties, for example to serve as members of popular courts, or of regional and confederal councils. Such delegation is made, in principle, by lot, on a rotation basis, and is always recallable by the citizen body. Delegates to regional and confederal bodies should have specific mandates.\n\n====Participatory politics====\n{{Main|Participatory politics}}\nA [[Parpolity]] or Participatory Polity is a theoretical form of democracy that is ruled by a [[Parpolity|Nested Council]] structure. The guiding philosophy is that people should have decision making power in proportion to how much they are affected by the decision. Local councils of 25\u201350 people are completely autonomous on issues that affect only them, and these councils send delegates to higher level councils who are again autonomous regarding issues that affect only the population affected by that council.\n\nA council court of randomly chosen citizens serves as a check on the [[tyranny of the majority]], and rules on which body gets to vote on which issue. Delegates may vote differently from how their sending council might wish, but are mandated to communicate the wishes of their sending council. Delegates are recallable at any time. Referendums are possible at any time via votes of most lower-level councils, however, not everything is a referendum as this is most likely a waste of time. A parpolity is meant to work in tandem with a [[participatory economy]].\n\n====Cosmopolitan====\n{{Main|Cosmopolitan democracy}}\nCosmopolitan democracy, also known as ''Global democracy'' or ''World Federalism'', is a political system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale, either directly or through representatives. An important justification for this kind of system is that the decisions made in national or regional democracies often affect people outside the constituency who, by definition, cannot vote. By contrast, in a cosmopolitan democracy, the people who are affected by decisions also have a say in them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/CD_and_critics_A_review.pdf |title=Article on Cosmopolitan democracy by Daniele Archibugi |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220629/http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/CD_and_critics_A_review.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to its supporters, any attempt to solve global problems is undemocratic without some form of cosmopolitan democracy. The general principle of cosmopolitan democracy is to expand some or all of the values and norms of democracy, including the rule of law; the non-violent resolution of conflicts; and equality among citizens, beyond the limits of the state. To be fully implemented, this would require reforming existing [[international organisations]], e.g. the [[United Nations]], as well as the creation of new institutions such as a [[World Parliament]], which ideally would enhance public control over, and accountability in, international politics.\n\nCosmopolitan Democracy has been promoted, among others, by physicist Albert Einstein,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neutrino.aquaphoenix.com/un-esa/ws1997-letter-einstein.html |title=letter by Einstein \u2013 \"To the General Assembly of the United Nations\" |accessdate= 2 July 2013}}, first published in United Nations World New York, Oct 1947, pp13-14</ref> writer Kurt Vonnegut, columnist [[George Monbiot]], and professors [[David Held]] and [[Daniele Archibugi]].<ref>Daniele Archibugi & David Held, eds., ''Cosmopolitan Democracy.

Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy''], Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2008</ref> The creation of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2003 was seen as a major step forward by many supporters of this type of cosmopolitan democracy.\n\n====Creative democracy====\n{{Main|Creative democracy}}\nCreative Democracy is advocated by American philosopher [[John Dewey]]. The main idea about Creative Democracy is that democracy encourages individual capacity building and the interaction among the society. Dewey argues that democracy is a way of life in his work of \"Creative Democracy: The Task Before Us\"<ref>http://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/courses_readings/dewey/dewey_creative_democracy.pdf</ref> and an experience built on faith in human nature, faith in human beings, and faith in working with others. Democracy, in Dewey's view, is a [[Morality|moral ideal]] requiring actual effort and work by people; it is not an institutional concept that exists outside of ourselves. \"The task of democracy\", Dewey concludes, \"is forever that of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and to which all contribute\".\n\n====Guided democracy====\n{{Main|Guided democracy}}\nGuided democracy is a form of democracy which incorporates regular popular elections, but which often carefully \"guides\" the choices offered to the electorate in a manner which may reduce the ability of the electorate to truly determine the type of government exercised over them.  Such democracies typically have only one central authority which is often not subject to meaningful public review by any other governmental authority.  Russian-style democracy has often been referred to as a \"Guided democracy.\"<ref>[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/17149/pdf Ten Years After the Soviet Breakup: From Democratization to \"Guided Democracy\"] Journal of Democracy.

Under ''minimalism'', democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections. According to this minimalist conception, citizens cannot and should not \"rule\" because, for example, on most issues, most of the time, they have no clear views or their views are not well-founded. [[Joseph Schumpeter]] articulated this view most famously in his book ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy''.<ref>[[Joseph Schumpeter]], (1950). ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy''. Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-133008-6}}.</ref> Contemporary proponents of minimalism include [[William H. Riker]], [[Adam Przeworski]], [[Richard Posner]].\n\nAccording to the theory of [[direct democracy]], on the other hand, citizens should vote directly, not through their representatives, on legislative proposals. Proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view. Political activity can be valuable in itself, it socialises and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites. Most importantly, citizens do not really rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies.\n\nGovernments will tend to produce laws and policies that are close to the views of the median voter\u2014with half to their left and the other half to their right. This is not actually a desirable outcome as it represents the action of self-interested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votes. [[Anthony Downs]] suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governments. Downs laid out this view in his 1957 book ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''.<ref>[[Anthony Downs]], (1957). ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''. Harpercollins College. {{ISBN|0-06-041750-1}}.</ref>\n\n[[Robert A. Dahl]] argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that, when it comes to binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision). He uses the term [[polyarchy]] to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy. First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open [[elections]] which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society. However, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation.<ref>[[Robert A. Dahl|Dahl, Robert]], (1989). ''Democracy and its Critics.'' New Haven: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-04938-2}}</ref> Similarly, [[Ronald Dworkin]] argues that \"democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal.\"<ref>Dworkin, Ronald (2006). ''Is Democracy Possible Here?'' Princeton: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|9780691138725}}, p. 134.</ref>\n\n====Deliberative====\n''[[Deliberative democracy]]'' is based on the notion that democracy is government by [[deliberation]]. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. ''Authentic deliberation'' is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups.<ref>Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson (2002).

Democracy's role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference, dissent and antagonisms in decision making processes.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{Main|Criticism of democracy}}\n\n[[File:2011 Wisconsin Budget Protests 1 JO.jpg|thumb|Protests]]\n\n===Inefficiencies===\n\nSome economists have criticized the efficiency of democracy, citing the premise of the irrational voter, or a voter who makes decisions without all of the facts or necessary information in order to make a truly informed decision. Another argument is that democracy slows down processes because of the amount of input and participation needed in order to go forward with a decision. A common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by China (a non-democratic country) as compared to India (a democratic country). According to economists, the lack of democratic participation in countries like China allows for unfettered economic growth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Is Democracy a Pre-Condition in Economic Growth?

This would ultimately lead to a demise of the nation. This was quoted by Plato in book 10 of The Republic, in Socrates' conversation with Adimantus.<ref name=\"Republic\">{{cite book|last1=Conversation of Socrates|first1=Plato|last2=H|first2=Translated by Spens|title=The Republic of Plato - Book ten - A conversation between Socrates and Admimantus}}</ref> Socrates was of the opinion that the right to vote must not be an indiscriminate right (for example by birth or citizenship), but must be given only to people who thought sufficiently of their choice.\n\n===Popular rule as a fa\u00e7ade===\n\nThe 20th-century Italian thinkers [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Gaetano Mosca]] (independently) argued that democracy was illusory, and served only to mask the reality of elite rule. Indeed, they argued that elite oligarchy is the unbendable law of human nature, due largely to the apathy and division of the masses (as opposed to the drive, initiative and unity of the elites), and that democratic institutions would do no more than shift the exercise of power from oppression to manipulation.<ref>Femia, Joseph V. \"Against the Masses\", Oxford 2001</ref> As [[Louis Brandeis]] once professed, \"We may have democracy, or we may have [[wealth]] concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.\"{{clarify|date=March 2018}}<ref>Dilliard, Iriving. \"Mr. Justice Brandeis, Great American\", Modern View Press 1941, p. 42.

Dutton & Co. Inc.), 558-C.</ref> In his work, Plato lists [[Plato's five regimes|5 forms of government]] from best to worst. Assuming that ''the Republic'' was intended to be a serious critique of the political thought in Athens, Plato argues that only Kallipolis, an aristocracy led by the unwilling philosopher-kings (the wisest men), is a just form of government.<ref>The contrast between Plato's theory of philosopher-kings, arresting change, and Aristotle's embrace of change, is the historical tension espoused by [[Karl Raimund Popper]] in his WWII treatise, ''The Open Society and its Enemies'' (1943).</ref>\n\n[[James Madison]] critiqued direct democracy (which he referred to simply as \"democracy\") in [[Federalist No. 10]], arguing that representative democracy\u2014which he described using the term \"republic\"\u2014is a preferable form of government, saying: \"...&nbsp;democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.\" Madison offered that republics were superior to democracies because republics safeguarded against [[tyranny of the majority]], stating in [[Federalist No. 10]]: \"the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic\".\n\n===Political instability===\n\nMore recently, democracy is criticised for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected on and off there tends to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the popular media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea that democracy is undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priorities.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7671283.stm | work=BBC News | title=Head to head: African democracy | date=16 October 2008 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis opportunist alliance not only has the handicap of having to cater to too many ideologically opposing factions, but it is usually short lived since any perceived or actual imbalance in the treatment of coalition partners, or changes to leadership in the coalition partners themselves, can very easily result in the coalition partner withdrawing its support from the government.\n\nBiased media has been accused of causing political instability, resulting in the obstruction of democracy, rather than its promotion.<ref>''The Review of Policy Research, Volume 22, Issues 1\u20133'', Policy Studies Organization, Potomac Institute for Policy Studies.

The implementation of a democratic government within a non-democratic state is typically brought about by [[democratic revolution]].\n\nPost-Enlightenment ideologies such as [[fascism]], [[nazism]], [[communism]] and [[fundamentalism|neo-fundamentalism]] oppose democracy on different grounds, generally citing that the concept of democracy as a constant process is flawed and detrimental to a preferable course of development.\n\n==Development==\n{{main|Democratization}}\nSeveral philosophers and researchers have outlined historical and social factors seen as supporting the evolution of democracy.\n\nOther commentators have mentioned the influence of economic development.<ref>For example: {{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1951731 | author = Lipset, Seymour Martin. | year = 1959 | title = Some Social Requisites of Democracy: Economic Development and Political Legitimacy| journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 69\u2013105 | jstor =  1951731 }}</ref> In a related theory, [[Ronald Inglehart]] suggests that improved living-standards in modern developed countries can convince people that they can take their basic survival for granted, leading to increased emphasis on [[self-expression values]], which correlates closely with democracy.<ref>Inglehart, Ronald.

The [[logical connective]] that represents this operator is typically written as \u2228 or +.\n\n<math>A \\lor B</math> is true if <math>A</math> is true, or if <math>B</math> is true, or if both <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> are true.\n\nIn logic, ''or'' by itself means the ''inclusive'' ''or'', distinguished from an [[exclusive or]], which is false when both of its arguments are true, while an \"or\" is true in that case.\n\nAn operand of a disjunction is called a '''disjunct'''.\n\nRelated concepts in other fields are:\n* In [[natural language]], the [[Grammatical conjunction#Coordinating conjunctions|coordinating conjunction]] \"or\".\n* In programming languages, the [[short-circuit evaluation|short-circuit or]] [[control structure]].\n* In [[set theory]], [[union (set theory)|union]].\n* In [[predicate logic]], [[existential quantification]].\n\n==Notation==\n'''Or''' is usually expressed with an infix operator: in mathematics and logic, '''\u2228'''; in electronics, '''+'''; and in most programming languages, '''|''', '''||''', or '''or'''.   In [[Jan \u0141ukasiewicz]]'s [[Polish notation#Polish notation for logic|prefix notation for logic]], the operator is '''A''', for Polish ''alternatywa'' (English: alternative).<ref>[[J\u00f3zef Maria Boche\u0144ski]] (1959), ''A Pr\u00e9cis of Mathematical Logic'', translated by Otto Bird from the French and German editions, Dordrecht, North Holland:  D. Reidel, passim.</ref>\n\n==Definition==\n'''Logical disjunction''' is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that has a value of ''false'' if and only if both of its operands are false. More generally, a disjunction is a logical formula that can have one or more [[literal (mathematical logic)|literal]]s separated only by 'or's. A single literal is often considered to be a degenerate disjunction.\n\nThe disjunctive [[identity element|identity]] is false, which is to say that the ''or'' of an expression with false has the same value as the original expression. In keeping with the concept of [[vacuous truth]], when disjunction is defined as an operator or function of arbitrary [[arity]], the empty disjunction (OR-ing over an empty set of operands) is generally defined as false.\n\n===Truth table===\n\nThe [[truth table]] of <math>A \\lor B</math>:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; background-color: #ddffdd;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#ddeeff\"\n| <math>A</math> || <math>B</math> || <math>A \\lor B</math>\n|-\n| T || T || T\n|-\n| T || F || T\n|-\n| F || T || T\n|-\n| F || F || F\n|}\n\n==Properties==\n\nThe following properties apply to disjunction:\n\n*[[associativity]]: <math>a \\lor (b \\lor c) \\equiv (a \\lor b) \\lor c </math>\n*[[commutativity]]: <math>a \\lor  b \\equiv b \\lor a </math>\n*[[distributivity]]: <math>(a \\lor (b \\land c)) \\equiv ((a \\lor b) \\land (a \\lor c))</math>\n:::<math>(a \\lor (b \\lor c)) \\equiv ((a \\lor b) \\lor (a \\lor c))</math>\n:::<math>(a \\lor (b \\equiv c)) \\equiv ((a \\lor b) \\equiv (a \\lor c))</math>\n\n*[[idempotency]]: <math>a \\lor a \\equiv a </math>\n*[[monotonicity]]: <math>(a \\rightarrow b) \\rightarrow ((c \\lor a) \\rightarrow (c \\lor b))</math>\n:::<math>(a \\rightarrow b) \\rightarrow ((a \\lor c) \\rightarrow (b \\lor c))</math>\n\n*'''truth-preserving''': The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a [[truth value]] of 'true' produces a truth value of 'true' as a result of disjunction.\n*'''falsehood-preserving''': The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a [[truth value]] of 'false' produces a truth value of 'false' as a result of disjunction.\n\n==Symbol==\nThe mathematical symbol for logical disjunction varies in the literature. In addition to the word \"or\", and the formula \"A''pq''\", the symbol \"<math>\\or</math>\", deriving from the Latin word ''[[wikt:en:vel#Latin|vel]]'' (\u201ceither\u201d, \u201cor\u201d) is commonly used for disjunction. For example: \"''A'' <math>\\or</math> ''B''&nbsp;\" is read as \"''A'' or ''B''&nbsp;\". Such a disjunction is false if both ''A'' and ''B'' are false. In all other cases it is true.\n\nAll of the following are disjunctions:\n: <math>A \\lor B</math>\n: <math>\\neg A \\lor B</math>\n: <math>A \\lor \\neg B \\lor \\neg C \\lor D \\lor \\neg E.</math>\n\nThe corresponding operation in set theory is the [[union (set theory)|set-theoretic union]].\n\n==Applications in computer science==\n[[File:Or-gate-en.svg|thumb|150px|OR [[logic gate]]]]\n[[Operator (programming)|Operators]] corresponding to logical disjunction exist in most [[programming language]]s.\n\n===Bitwise operation===\nDisjunction is often used for bitwise operations. Examples:\n* 0 or 0 = 0\n* 0 or 1 = 1\n* 1 or 0 = 1\n* 1 or 1 = 1\n* 1010 or 1100 = 1110\n\nThe <code>or</code> operator can be used to set bits in a [[bit field]] to 1, by <code>or</code>-ing the field with a constant field with the relevant bits set to 1. For example, <code>x = x | 0b00000001</code> will force the final bit to 1 while leaving other bits unchanged.\n\n===Logical operation===\nMany languages distinguish between bitwise and logical disjunction by providing two distinct operators; in languages following C, bitwise disjunction is performed with the single pipe (<code>|</code>) and logical disjunction with the double pipe (<code>||</code>) operators.\n\nLogical disjunction is usually [[Short-circuit evaluation|short-circuited]]; that is, if the first (left) operand evaluates to <code>true</code> then the second (right) operand is not evaluated. The logical disjunction operator thus usually constitutes a [[sequence point]].\n\n{{anchor|parallel-or}}\nIn a parallel (concurrent) language, it is possible to short-circuit both sides: they are evaluated in parallel,\nand if one terminates with value true, the other is interrupted. This operator is thus called the '''parallel or'''.\n\nAlthough in most languages the type of a logical disjunction expression is boolean and thus can only have the value <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, in some (such as [[Python programming language|Python]] and [[JavaScript]]) the logical disjunction operator returns one of its operands: the first operand if it evaluates to a true value, and the second operand otherwise.\n\n===Constructive disjunction===\nThe [[Curry\u2013Howard correspondence]] relates a [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] form of disjunction to [[tagged union]] types.\n\n==Union==\nThe [[Element (mathematics)|membership]] of an element of a [[union (set theory)|union set]] in [[set theory]] is defined in terms of a logical disjunction: ''x'' \u2208 ''A'' \u222a ''B'' if and only if (''x'' \u2208 ''A'') \u2228 (''x'' \u2208 ''B''). Because of this, logical disjunction satisfies many of the same identities as set-theoretic union, such as associativity, commutativity, distributivity, and [[de Morgan's laws]], identifying [[logical conjunction]] with [[set intersection]], [[logical negation]] with [[set complement]].\n\n==Natural language==\nAs with other notions formalized in [[mathematical logic]], the [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] of the natural-language [[Grammatical conjunction#Coordinating conjunctions|coordinating conjunction]] ''or'' is closely related to but different from the logical ''or''. For example, \"Please ring me or send an email\" likely means \"do one or the other, but not both\". On the other hand, \"Her grades are so good that either she's very bright or she studies hard\" does not exclude the possibility of both.

''If P, Then Q: Conditionals and the Foundations of Reasoning''. London, UK: Routledge: 39</ref><ref>Hurley</ref><ref>Copi and Cohen</ref><ref>Moore and Parker</ref> is a valid [[rule of inference]]. If we are told that at least one of two statements is true; and also told that it is not the former that is true; we can [[inference|infer]] that it has to be the latter that is true. If ''P'' is true or ''Q'' is true and ''P'' is false, then ''Q'' is true. The reason this is called \"disjunctive syllogism\" is that, first, it is a syllogism, a three-step [[argument]], and second, it contains a logical disjunction, which simply means an  \"or\" statement.  \"P or Q\" is a disjunction; P and Q are called the statement's ''disjuncts''.  The rule makes it possible to eliminate a [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] from a [[formal proof|logical proof]]. It is the rule that:\n\n:<math>\\frac{P \\lor Q, \\neg P}{\\therefore Q}</math>\n\nwhere the rule is that whenever instances of \"<math>P \\lor Q</math>\", and \"<math>\\neg P</math>\" appear on lines of a proof, \"<math>Q</math>\" can be placed on a subsequent line.\n\nDisjunctive syllogism is closely related and similar to [[hypothetical syllogism]], in that it is also type of syllogism, and also the name of a rule of inference. It is also related to the [[law of noncontradiction]], one of the [[Law of thought#Three traditional laws: identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle|three traditional laws of thought]].\n\n== Formal notation ==\nThe ''disjunctive syllogism'' rule may be written in [[sequent]] notation:\n\n: <math> P \\lor Q, \\lnot P \\vdash Q </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\vdash</math> is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning that <math>Q</math> is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] of <math>P \\lor Q</math>, and <math>\\lnot P</math> in some [[formal system|logical system]];\n\nand expressed as a truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[theorem]] of propositional logic:\n\n:<math> ((P \\lor Q) \\land \\neg P) \\to Q</math>\n\nwhere <math>P</math>, and <math>Q</math> are propositions expressed in some [[formal system]].\n\n== Natural language examples ==\nHere is an example:\n:I will choose soup or I will choose salad.\n:I will not choose soup.\n:Therefore, I will choose salad.\n\nHere is another example:\n:It is red or it is blue.\n:It is not blue.\n:Therefore, it is red.\n\n== Inclusive and exclusive disjunction ==\nPlease observe that the disjunctive syllogism works whether 'or' is considered 'exclusive' or 'inclusive' disjunction. See below for the definitions of these terms.\n\nThere are two kinds of logical disjunction:\n\n* ''[[logical disjunction|inclusive]]'' means \"and/or\"  - at least one of them is true, or maybe both.\n* ''[[Exclusive or|exclusive]]'' (\"xor\") means exactly one must be true, but they cannot both be.\n\nThe widely used English language concept of ''or'' is often ambiguous between these two meanings, but the difference is pivotal in evaluating disjunctive arguments.\n\nThis argument:\n:P or Q.\n:Not P.\n:Therefore, Q.\n\nis valid and indifferent between both meanings. However, only in the ''exclusive'' meaning is the following form valid:\n\n:Either (only) P or (only) Q.\n:P.\n:Therefore, not Q.\n\nHowever, if the fact is true it does not commit the fallacy.\n\nWith the ''inclusive'' meaning you could draw no conclusion from the first two premises of that argument. See [[affirming a disjunct]].\n\n==Related argument forms==\nUnlike ''[[modus ponendo ponens]]'' and ''[[modus ponendo tollens]]'', with which it should not be confused, disjunctive syllogism is often not made an explicit rule or axiom of [[logical system]]s, as the above arguments can be proven with a (slightly devious) combination of [[reductio ad absurdum]] and [[disjunction elimination]].\n\nOther forms of syllogism include:\n*[[hypothetical syllogism]]\n*[[categorical syllogism]]\n\nDisjunctive syllogism holds in classical propositional logic and [[intuitionistic logic]], but not in some [[paraconsistent logic]]s.<ref>Chris Mortensen, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathematics-inconsistent/ Inconsistent Mathematics], ''Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy'', First published Tue Jul 2, 1996; substantive revision Thu Jul 31, 2008</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Stoic logic]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Rules of inference]]\n[[Category:Theorems in propositional logic]]\n[[Category:Classical logic]]\n[[Category:Paraconsistent logic]]", "sha1": "4ho00nwlt4nagmp1twcgtrpl028vjds"}}, {"title": "Definition", "ns": "0", "id": "7964", "revision": {"id": "864207235", "parentid": "864206929", "timestamp": "2018-10-15T19:51:19Z", "contributor": {"username": "Escape Orbit", "id": "4788526"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/108.48.163.2|108.48.163.2]] ([[User talk:108.48.163.2|talk]]) to last version by ClueBot NG", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{hatnote|For the definition of another word, try using [[wikt:Main Page|Wiktionary]]}}\n{{for|other uses of the word \"definition\" itself}}\n\n[[File:Blacks-Law-Dictionary.jpg|thumb|right|340px|A definition states the meaning of a word using other words.

John Wiley & Sons p.4</ref>\n\n==Basic terminology==\n{{redirect|definiens|the company|Definiens (company)}}\nIn modern usage, a ''definition'' is something, typically expressed in words, that attaches a meaning to a word or group of words. The word or group of words that is to be defined is called the ''definiendum'', and the word, group of words, or action that defines it is called the ''definiens''. In the definition ''\"An elephant is a large gray animal native to Asia and Africa\"'', the word \"elephant\" is the ''definiendum'', and everything after the word \"is\" is the ''definiens''.<ref name=\"hurley9\">{{cite book |last=Hurley |first1=Patrick J. |title=A Concise Introduction to Logic |chapter=Language: Meaning and Definition |edition=9 |publisher=Wadsworth |year=2006 |pages=86\u201391 |accessdate=2016-02-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe ''definiens'' is not ''the meaning'' of the word defined, but is instead something that ''conveys the same meaning'' as that word.<ref name=\"hurley9\"/>\n\nThere are many sub-types of definitions, often specific to a given field of knowledge or study. These include, among many others, '''lexical definitions''', or the common dictionary definitions of words already in a language; '''demonstrative definitions''', which define something by pointing to an example of it (''\"This,\" [said while pointing to a large grey animal], \"is an Asian elephant.\"''); and '''precising definitions''', which reduce the vagueness of a word, typically in some special sense (''\"'Large', among female Asian elephants, is any individual weighing over 5,500 pounds.\"'').<ref name=\"hurley9\"/>\n\n==Intensional definitions vs extensional definitions==\n{{Main article|Intension|Extension (semantics)}}\n\nAn ''[[intensional definition]]'', also called a ''connotative'' definition, specifies the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for a thing being a member of a specific [[Set (mathematics)|set]].<ref name=Lyons/> Any definition that attempts to set out the essence of something, such as that by [[Genus-differentia definition|genus and differentia]], is an intensional definition.\n\nAn ''[[extensional definition]]'', also called a ''denotative'' definition, of a concept or term specifies its ''[[extension (semantics)|extension]]''. It is a list naming every [[object (philosophy)|object]] that is a member of a specific [[Set (mathematics)|set]].<ref name=Lyons/>\n\nThus, the \"[[seven deadly sins]]\" can be defined ''intensionally'' as those singled out by [[Pope Gregory I]] as particularly destructive of the life of grace and charity within a person, thus creating the threat of eternal damnation. An ''extensional'' definition would be the list of wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony. In contrast, while an intensional definition of \"[[Prime Minister]]\" might be \"the most senior minister of a cabinet in the executive branch of government in a parliamentary system\", an extensional definition is not possible since it is not known who future prime ministers will be.\n\n===Classes of intensional definitions===\n{{Main article|Genus\u2013differentia definition}}\nA '''genus\u2013differentia definition''' is a type of [[intensional definition]] that takes a large category (the '''genus''') and narrows it down to a smaller category by a distinguishing characteristic (i.e. the differentia).<ref>Bussler, Christoph, and Dieter Fensel, eds. Artificial Intelligence: Methodology, Systems and Applications: 11th International Conference, AIMSA 2004: Proceedings. Springer-Verlag, 2004. p.6</ref>\n\nMore formally, a genus-differentia definition consists of:\n# '''a [[genus]]''' (or family): An existing definition that serves as a portion of the new definition; all definitions with the same genus are considered members of that genus.\n# '''the differentia''': The portion of the new definition that is not provided by the genus.\n\nFor example, consider the following genus-differentia definitions:\n* ''a [[triangle]]'': A plane figure that has three straight bounding sides.\n* ''a [[quadrilateral]]'': A plane figure that has four straight bounding sides.\n\nThose definitions can be expressed as a genus (\"a plane figure\") and two differentiae (\"that has three straight bounding sides\" and \"that has four straight bounding sides\", respectively).\n\nIt is possible to have two different genus-differentia definitions that describe the same term, especially when the term describes the overlap of two large categories. For instance, both of these genus-differentia definitions of \"square\" are equally acceptable:\n* ''a square'': a [[rectangle]] that is a [[rhombus]].\n* ''a square'': a [[rhombus]] that is a [[rectangle]].\n\nThus, a \"square\" is a member of both the genus \"rectangle\" and the genus \"rhombus\".\n\n===Classes of extensional definitions===\nOne important form of the extensional definition is ''[[ostensive definition]]''. This gives the meaning of a term by pointing, in the case of an individual, to the thing itself, or in the case of a class, to examples of the right kind. So one can explain who ''Alice'' (an individual) is by pointing her out to another; or what a ''rabbit'' (a class) is by pointing at several and expecting another to understand. The process of ostensive definition itself was critically appraised by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].<ref>''Philosophical investigations'', Part 1 \u00a727\u201334</ref>\n\nAn ''[[enumerative definition]]'' of a concept or term is an ''[[extensional definition]]'' that gives an explicit and exhaustive listing of all the [[object (philosophy)|objects]] that fall under the concept or term in question. Enumerative definitions are only possible for finite sets and only practical for relatively small sets.\n\n===''Divisio'' and ''partitio''===\n''Divisio'' and ''partitio'' are [[Classics|classical]] terms for definitions. A ''partitio'' is simply an intensional definition. A ''divisio'' is not an extensional definition, but an exhaustive list of [[subset]]s of a set, in the sense that every member of the \"divided\" set is a member of one of the subsets. An extreme form of ''divisio'' lists all sets whose only member is a member of the \"divided\" set. The difference between this and an extensional definition is that extensional definitions list ''members'', and not subsets.<ref>Katerina Ierodiakonou, \"The Stoic Division of Philosophy\", in ''Phronesis: A Journal for Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 38, Number 1, 1993, pp. 57\u201374.</ref>\n\n===Nominal definitions vs real definitions===\n{{Main article|Essence}}\nIn classical thought, a definition was taken to be a statement of the essence of a thing. [[Aristotle]] had it that an object's essential attributes form its \"essential nature\", and that a definition of the object must include these essential attributes.<ref>[[Posterior Analytics]], Bk 1 c. 4</ref>\n\nThe idea that a definition should state the essence of a thing led to the distinction between ''nominal'' and ''real'' essence, originating with Aristotle. In a passage from the [[Posterior Analytics]],<ref>[[Posterior Analytics]] Bk 2 c. 7</ref> he says that the meaning of a made-up name can be known (he gives the example \"goat stag\"), without knowing what he calls the \"essential nature\" of the thing that the name would denote, if there were such a thing. This led medieval logicians to distinguish between what they called the ''quid nominis'' or \"whatness of the name\", and the underlying nature common to all the things it names, which they called the ''quid rei'' or \"whatness of the thing\". (Early modern philosophers like Locke used the corresponding English terms \"nominal essence\" and \"real essence\"). The name \"[[hobbit]]\", for example, is perfectly meaningful. It has a ''quid nominis''. But one could not know the real nature of hobbits, and so the real nature or ''quid rei'' of hobbits cannot be known. By contrast, the name \"man\" denotes real things (men) that have a certain ''quid rei''. The meaning of a name is distinct from the nature that thing must have in order that the name apply to it.\n\nThis leads to a corresponding distinction between ''nominal'' and ''real'' definitions. A nominal definition is the definition explaining what a word means, i.e. which says what the \"nominal essence\" is, and is definition in the classical sense as given above. A real definition, by contrast, is one expressing the real nature or ''quid rei'' of the thing.\n\nThis preoccupation with essence dissipated in much of modern philosophy. [[Analytic philosophy]] in particular is critical of attempts to elucidate the essence of a thing. [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] described essence as \"a hopelessly muddle-headed notion\".<ref>''A history of Western Philosophy'', p. 210</ref>\n\nMore recently [[Kripke semantics|Kripke's]] formalisation of [[possible world]] semantics in [[modal logic]] led to a new approach to [[essentialism]]. Insofar as the essential properties of a thing are ''necessary'' to it, they are those things it possesses in all possible worlds. Kripke refers to names used in this way as [[rigid designator]]s.\n\n==Operational Versus Theoretical Definitions==\nA definition may also be classified as an [[operational definition]] or [[theoretical definition]].\n\n==Terms with multiple definitions==\n\n===Homonyms===\n{{main article|Homonym}}\nA [[homonym]] is, in the strict sense, one of a group of words that share the same spelling and pronunciation but have different  meanings.<ref name=\"RHUD\">[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/homonym homonym], ''Random House Unabridged Dictionary'' at dictionary.com</ref>  Thus homonyms are simultaneously [[homograph]]s (words that share the same spelling, regardless of their pronunciation) ''and'' [[homophone]]s (words that share the same pronunciation, regardless of their spelling).  The state of being a homonym is called '''''homonymy'''''. Examples of homonyms are the pair ''stalk'' (part of a plant) and ''stalk'' (follow/harass a person) and the pair ''left'' (past tense of leave) and ''left'' (opposite of right).  A distinction is sometimes made between \"true\" homonyms, which are unrelated in origin, such as ''skate'' (glide on ice) and ''skate'' (the fish), and polysemous homonyms, or [[Polysemy|polysemes]], which have a shared origin, such as ''mouth'' (of a river) and ''mouth'' (of an animal).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pandora.cii.wwu.edu/vajda/ling201/test3materials/semanticsHANDOUT.htm |title=Linguistics 201: Study Sheet for Semantics |publisher=Pandora.cii.wwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AefSOW9MW5UC&pg=PA123 Semantics: a coursebook, p. 123], James R. Hurford and Brendan Heasley, Cambridge University Press, 1983</ref>\n\n===Polysemes===\n{{main article|Polysemy}}\n[[Polysemy]]  is the capacity for a [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] (such as a [[word]], [[phrase]], or [[symbol]]) to have multiple meanings (that is, multiple [[seme (semantics)|semes]] or [[sememe]]s and thus multiple [[word sense|senses]]), usually related by contiguity of [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] within a [[semantic field]]. It is thus usually regarded as distinct from [[homonymy]], in which the multiple meanings of a word may be unconnected or unrelated.\n\n==In logic and mathematics==\nIn mathematics, definitions are generally not used to describe existing terms, but to give meaning to a new term.<ref>David Hunter (2010) Essentials of Discrete Mathematics. Jones & Bartlett Publishers, Section 14.1</ref> The meaning of a mathematical statement changes if definitions change. The precise meaning of a term given by a mathematical definition is often different than the English definition of the word used,<ref>Kevin Houston\n (2009) How to Think Like a Mathematician: A Companion to Undergraduate Mathematics. Cambridge University Press, p. 104</ref> which can lead to confusion for students who do not pay close attention to the definitions given.\n\n===Classification of mathematical definitions===\nAuthors have used different terms to classify definitions used in formal languages like mathematics.  [[Norman Swartz]] classifies a definition as \"stipulative\" if it is intended to guide a specific discussion.   A stipulative definition might be considered a temporary, working definition, and can only be disproved by showing a logical contradiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/philosophy/swartz/definitions.htm#part5.1|title=Norman Swartz - Biography|work=sfu.ca}}</ref> In contrast, a \"descriptive\" definition can be shown to be \"right\" or \"wrong\" with reference to general usage.\n\nSwartz defines a ''[[precising definition]]'' as one that extends the descriptive dictionary definition (lexical definition) for a specific purpose by including additional criteria. A precising definition narrows the set of things that meet the definition.\n\n[[Charles Stevenson|C.L. Stevenson]] has identified ''[[persuasive definition]]'' as a form of stipulative definition which purports to state the \"true\" or \"commonly accepted\" meaning of a term, while in reality stipulating an altered use (perhaps as an argument for some specific belief). Stevenson has also noted that some definitions are \"legal\" or \"coercive\"&nbsp;\u2013 their object is to create or alter rights, duties, or crimes.<ref>Stevenson, C.L., ''Ethics and Language'', Connecticut 1944</ref>\n\n===Recursive definitions===\nA [[recursive definition]], sometimes also called an ''inductive'' definition, is one that defines a word in terms of itself, so to speak, albeit in a useful way. Normally this consists of three steps:\n# At least one thing is stated to be a member of the set being defined; this is sometimes called a \"base set\".\n# All things bearing a certain relation to other members of the set are also to count as members of the set. It is this step that makes the definition [[Recursion|recursive]].\n# All other things are excluded from the set\n\nFor instance, we could define a [[natural number]] as follows (after [[Peano axioms|Peano]]): \n# \"0\" is a natural number.\n# Each natural number has a unique successor, such that:\n#* the successor of a natural number is also a natural number;\n#* distinct natural numbers have distinct successors;\n#* no natural number is succeeded by \"0\".\n# Nothing else is a natural number.\n\nSo \"0\" will have exactly one successor, which for convenience can be called \"1\". In turn, \"1\" will have exactly one successor, which could be called \"2\", and so on. Notice that the second condition in the definition itself refers to natural numbers, and hence involves [[self-reference]]. Although this sort of definition involves a form of [[Circular definition|circularity]], it is not [[Vicious circle principle|vicious]], and the definition has been quite successful.\n\nIn the same way, we can define [[ancestor]] as follows:\n#A parent is an ancestor.\n#A parent of an ancestor is an ancestor.\n#Nothing else is an ancestor.\nOr simply: an ancestor is a parent or a parent of an ancestor.\n\n==In medicine==\nIn [[medical dictionaries]], definitions should to the greatest extent possible be:\n*simple and easy to understand,<ref name=McPherson1998>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1542/peds.102.1.137 \n| last1 = McPherson | first1 = M. \n| last2 = Arango | first2 = P. \n| last3 = Fox | first3 = H. \n| last4 = Lauver | first4 = C. \n| last5 = McManus | first5 = M. \n| last6 = Newacheck | first6 = P.

To define a horse as \"a member of the species ''equus''\" would convey no information whatsoever. For this reason, Locking{{specify|date=November 2010}} adds that a definition of a term must not consist of terms which are synonymous with it. This would be a circular definition, a ''circulus in definiendo''. Note, however, that it is acceptable to define two relative terms in respect of each other. Clearly, we cannot define \"antecedent\" without using the term \"consequent\", nor conversely.\n#The definition must not be too wide or too narrow. It must be applicable to everything to which the defined term applies (i.e. not miss anything out), and to nothing else (i.e. not include any things to which the defined term would not truly apply).\n#The definition must not be obscure. The purpose of a definition is to explain the meaning of a term which may be obscure or difficult, by the use of terms that are commonly understood and whose meaning is clear. The violation of this rule is known by the Latin term ''obscurum per obscurius''. However, sometimes scientific and philosophical terms are difficult to define without obscurity.\n#A definition should not be negative where it can be positive. We should not define \"wisdom\" as the absence of folly, or a healthy thing as whatever is not sick. Sometimes this is unavoidable, however.

The [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophers]] claimed that the highest genera (the so-called ten ''generalissima'') cannot be defined, since a higher genus cannot be assigned under which they may fall. Thus [[being]], unity and similar concepts cannot be defined.<ref name=\"Joyce, Ch. X\"/> [[John Locke|Locke]] supposes in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''<ref>Locke, ''Essay'', Bk. III, Ch. iv</ref> that the names of simple concepts do not admit of any definition. More recently [[Bertrand Russell]] sought to develop a formal language based on [[Logical atomism|logical atoms]]. Other philosophers, notably [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], rejected the need for any undefined simples. Wittgenstein pointed out in his ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' that what counts as a \"simple\" in one circumstance might not do so in another.<ref>See especially ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' Part 1 \u00a748</ref> He rejected the very idea that every explanation of the meaning of a term needed itself to be explained: \"As though an explanation hung in the air unless supported by another one\",<ref>He continues: \"Whereas an explanation may indeed rest on another one that has been given, but none stands in need of another&nbsp;\u2013 unless ''we'' require it to prevent a misunderstanding. One might say: an explanation serves to remove or to avert a misunderstanding&nbsp;\u2013 one, that is, that would occur but for the explanation; not every one I can imagine.\" [[Philosophical Investigations]], Part 1 \u00a787, italics in original</ref> claiming instead that explanation of a term is only needed to avoid misunderstanding.\n\nLocke and [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] also argued that [[Principle of individuation|individuals]] cannot be defined. Names are learned by connecting an idea with a sound, so that speaker and hearer have the same idea when the same word is used.<ref>This theory of meaning is one of the targets of the [[private language argument]]</ref> This is not possible when no one else is acquainted with the particular thing that has \"fallen under our notice\".<ref>Locke, ''Essay'', Bk. III, Ch. iii, 3</ref> Russell offered his [[theory of descriptions]] in part as a way of defining a proper name, the definition being given by a [[definite description]] that \"picks out\" exactly one individual. [[Saul Kripke]] pointed to difficulties with this approach, especially in relation to [[modal logic|modality]], in his book ''Naming and Necessity''.\n\nThere is a presumption in the classic example of a definition that the ''definiens'' can be stated. Wittgenstein argued that for some terms this is not the case.<ref>''Philosophical Investigations</ref> The examples he used include ''game'', ''number'' and ''family''. In such cases, he argued, there is no fixed boundary that can be used to provide a definition. Rather, the items are grouped together because of a [[family resemblance]]. For terms such as these it is not possible and indeed not necessary to state a definition; rather, one simply comes to understand the ''use'' of the term.{{efn|Note that one learns inductively, from [[ostensive definition]], in the same way, as in the [[Ramsey\u2013Lewis method]].}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Analytic proposition]]\n*[[Circular definition]]\n*[[Definable set]]\n*[[Definitionism]]\n*[[Extensional definition]]\n*[[Fallacies of definition]]\n*[[Indeterminacy (Philosophy)|Indeterminacy]]\n*[[Intensional definition]]\n*[[Lexical definition]]\n*[[Operational definition]]\n*[[Ostensive definition]]\n*[[Ramsey\u2013Lewis method]]\n*[[Semantics]]\n*[[Synthetic proposition]]\n*[[Theoretical definition]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n<!--\nThese templates can be copied for additional references.

Disco can be seen as a reaction to both the dominance of [[rock music]] and the stigmatization of dance music by the [[counterculture]] during this period. Several dance styles were also developed during this time, including the [[Bump (dance)|Bump]] and the [[Hustle (dance)|Hustle]].\n\nThe disco sound is typified by [[four-on-the-floor (music)|\"four-on-the-floor\"]] beats, [[syncopated]] basslines, and [[string section]]s, horns, [[electric piano]], [[synthesizer]]s, and electric [[rhythm guitar]]s. [[Lead guitar]] features less frequently in disco than in [[Rock music|rock]]. Well-known disco artists include [[Donna Summer]], the [[Bee Gees]], [[Gloria Gaynor]], [[KC and the Sunshine Band]], the [[Village People]], [[Thelma Houston]], and [[Chic (band)|Chic]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-best-disco-songs-of-all-time-20120523|title=Readers' Poll: The Best Disco Songs of All Time|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref> and many at the height of the genre's popularity, many non-disco artists recorded disco songs. While performers and singers garnered public attention, [[record producer]]s working behind the scenes played an important role in developing the genre. Films such as ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977) and ''[[Thank God It's Friday (film)|Thank God It's Friday]]'' (1978) contributed to disco's mainstream popularity.\n\nBy the late 1970s, most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes, and [[DJ]]s would [[audio console|mix]] dance records at clubs such as [[Studio 54]] in New York City, a venue popular among [[celebrity|celebrities]]. Discoth\u00e8que-goers often wore expensive, extravagant and sexy fashions. There was also a thriving [[club drug|drug]] [[subculture]] in the disco scene, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as [[cocaine]] and [[Quaaludes]], the latter being so common in disco subculture that they were nicknamed \"disco biscuits\". Disco clubs were also associated with [[promiscuity]] as a reflection of the sexual revolution of this era in popular history. \n\nDisco was the last popular music movement driven by the [[baby boom generation]]. It began to decline in the United States during 1979-80, and by 1982 it had lost nearly all popularity there. [[Disco Demolition Night]], an anti-disco protest held in [[Chicago]] on July 12, 1979, remains the most well-known of several \"backlash\" incidents across the country that symbolized disco's declining fortune.\n\nDisco was a key influence in the development of [[electronic dance music]] and [[house music]]. It has had several revivals, such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s highly successful 2005 album ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'', and again in the 2010s, entering the pop charts in the US and the UK.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins of the term and type of nightclub===\nThe term disco is derived from ''discoth\u00e8que'' (French for \"library of phonograph records\", but it was subsequently used as a term for nightclubs in Paris). By the early 1940s, the terms ''[[disc jockey]]'' and ''DJ'' were in use to describe radio presenters. During WWII, because of restrictions set in place by the Nazi occupiers, jazz dance halls in [[Occupied France]] played records instead of using live music. Eventually more than one of these jazz venues had the proper name ''[[discoth\u00e8que]]''. By 1959, the term was used in Paris to describe any of these type of nightclubs. That year, a young reporter named Klaus Quirini started to select and introduce records at the Scotch-Club in [[Aachen, Germany|Aachen, West Germany]]. By the following year the term was being used in the United States to describe that type of club, and a type of dancing in those clubs. By 1964, ''discoth\u00e8que'' and the shorthand ''disco'' were used to describe a type of sleeveless dress worn when going out to nightclubs. In September 1964, ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' magazine used the word ''disco'' as a shorthand for a discoth\u00e8que-styled nightclub.<ref name=Oxford>{{cite web|title=The birth of disco|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/10/the-birth-of-disco/|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|date = October 2012|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== Usage in the United Kingdom in the early to mid-1970s ====\nIn 1974 there were an estimated 25,000 mobile discos and 40,000 professional disc jockeys in the United Kingdom.

Early songs with disco elements include \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" ([[the Supremes]], 1966), \"[[Soul Makossa]]\" ([[Manu Dibango]], 1972), \"[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]\" by [[Stevie Wonder]] (1972) [[Eddie Kendricks]]' \"[[Keep on Truckin' (song)|Keep on Truckin']]\" (1973) and \"[[The Love I Lost]]\" by [[Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes]] (1973). \"[[Love Train]]\" by [[the O'Jays]] (1972), with M.F.S.B. as the backup band, topped the ''Billboard'' pop chart in March 1973, and has been called \"disco\".\n\nIn 1972, [[The Four Seasons (band)|The Four Seasons]] released ''\"[[The Night (Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons song)|The Night]]\"'', a song with disco elements which appealed to the [[Northern Soul]] scene.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n[[File:Dance floor 2 by harmon.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Major disco clubs had lighted dance floors, with the lights flashing to complement the beat.]]\nEarly disco was dominated by record producers and labels such as [[Salsoul Records]] (Ken, Stanley, and [[Joseph Cayre]]), [[West End Records]] ([[Mel Cheren]]), [[Casablanca Records|Casablanca]] (Neil Bogart), and [[Prelude Records (record label)|Prelude]] (Marvin Schlachter), to name a few.

DJs would select songs and grooves according to what the dancers wanted, transitioning from one song to another with a [[DJ mixer]] and using a [[microphone]] to introduce songs and speak to the audiences.

Even the ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' theme was not spared from being disco-ized.

Also by this time the economic prosperity of the previous decade had declined, and unemployment, inflation and crime rates had soared. Disco music and disco dancing provided an escape from these negative economic issues. As well, in the 1970s, the key [[counterculture of the 1960s]], the hippie movement, was fading away. The disco movement was far more than just music. It was also a subculture based around nightclubs, dance clubs, and DJs. In ''Beautiful Things in Popular Culture'', [[Simon Frith]] highlights the sociability of disco and its roots in 1960s counterculture. \"The driving force of the New York underground dance scene in which disco was forged was not simply that city's complex ethnic and sexual culture but also a 1960s notion of community, pleasure and generosity that can only be described as hippie,\" he says. \"The best disco music contained within it a remarkably powerful sense of collective euphoria.\"<ref>Alan McKee, ''Beautiful Things in Popular Culture''.

The event, which involved exploding disco records, ended with a riot, during which the raucous crowd tore out seats and pieces of turf, and caused other damage. The [[Chicago Police Department]] made numerous arrests, and the extensive damage to the field forced the White Sox to forfeit the second game to the [[Detroit Tigers]], who had won the first game.\n\nSix months prior to the chaotic event (in December 1978), popular progressive rock radio station WDAI ([[WLS-FM]]) had suddenly switched to an all-disco format, disenfranchising thousands of Chicago rock fans and leaving Dahl unemployed. WDAI, who despite surviving the backlash and still had good ratings at this point, continued to play Disco until it flipped to a short-lived hybrid Top 40/Rock format in May 1980. Another Disco outlet that also competed against WDAI at the time, [[WGCI-FM]], would later incorporate R&B and Pop Songs into the format, eventually evolving into an Urban Contemporary outlet that it continues with today. The latter also helped bring the [[house music|house]] music genre to the airwaves, ending the backlash somewhat with Chicago emerging as the birthplace of house.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nOn July 21, 1979, the top six records on the U.S. music charts were disco songs.<ref name=\"ComiskyThriller\">[http://www.wnyc.org/shows/soundcheck/2009/jul/14/disco-demolition-night/ From Comiskey Park to Thriller: The Effect of \"Disco Sucks\" on Pop] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119085207/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/soundcheck/2009/jul/14/disco-demolition-night/ |date=November 19, 2011 }} by [[Steve Greenberg (record producer)|Steve Greenberg]] founder and CEO of [[S-Curve Records]] July 10, 2009.</ref> By September 22, there were no disco songs in the US Top 10 chart, with the exception of [[Herb Alpert]]'s instrumental \"[[Rise (instrumental)|Rise]],\" a [[smooth jazz]] composition with some disco overtones.<ref name=\"ComiskyThriller\"/> Some in the media, in celebratory tones, declared disco \"dead\" and rock revived.<ref name=\"ComiskyThriller\"/> [[Karen Mixon Cook]], the first female disco DJ, stated that people still pause every July 12 for a moment of silence in honor of Disco.

Starting in the 1980s, [[country music]] began a slow rise in American main pop charts. Emblematic of country music's rise to mainstream popularity was the commercially successful 1980 movie ''[[Urban Cowboy]]''. The continued popularity of [[power pop]] and the revival of [[oldies]] in the late 1970s was also related to the disco backlash; the 1978 film ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' was emblematic of this trend. Somewhat paradoxically, the star of both films was [[John Travolta]], who in 1977 had starred in ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', which remains one of the most iconic disco films of the era.\n\nDuring this period of decline in disco's popularity, several record companies folded, were reorganized, or were sold. In 1979, [[MCA Records]] purchased [[ABC Records]], absorbed some of its artists, and then shut the label down. [[Midsong International Records]] ceased operations in 1980. [[RSO Records]] founder [[Robert Stigwood]] left the label in 1981 and [[TK Records]] closed in the same year. [[Salsoul Records]] continues to exist in the 2000s, but primarily is used as a reissue brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/salsoul.shtml|title=Salsoul Records @ Disco-Disco.com|website=www.disco-disco.com|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}</ref> [[Casablanca Records]] had been releasing fewer records in the 1980s, and was shut down in 1986 by parent company [[PolyGram]].\n\nMany groups that were popular during the disco period subsequently struggled to maintain their success\u2014even those that tried to adapt to evolving musical tastes. The [[Bee Gees]], for instance, had only one top-10 entry (1989's \"[[One (Bee Gees song)|One]]\") and three more top-40 songs (despite recording and releasing far more than that and completely abandoning disco in their 1980s and 1990s songs) in the United States after the 1970s, even though numerous songs they wrote and had ''other'' artists perform were successful. Of the handful of groups ''not'' taken down by disco's fall from favor, [[Kool and the Gang]], [[Donna Summer]], [[the Jacksons]]\u2014and [[Michael Jackson]] in particular\u2014stand out: In spite of having helped define the disco sound early on,<ref>''[[Jackson 5: The Ultimate Collection]]'' (1996), liner notes.</ref> they continued to make popular and danceable, if more refined, songs for yet another generation of music fans in the 1980s and beyond. [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] also survived the disco backlash and continued to produce successful singles at roughly the same pace for several more years, in addition to an even longer string of R&B chart hits that lasted into the 1990s.\n\n====Factors contributing to disco's decline====\n[[File:Village People in Sydney.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[Village People]] group were created to target disco's gay audience by featuring popular gay fantasy personae.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2008/05/ymca-oral-history/ |title=Spin Magazine Online: Y.M.C.A.

Record producer [[Giorgio Moroder]]'s soundtracks to ''[[American Gigolo]]'', ''[[Flashdance]]'' and ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' (which also had a heavy disco influence) proved that the style was still very much embraced. [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s 1982 album, ''[[Hot Space]]'' was inspired by the genre as well.\n\nIn the 1990s, disco and its legacy became more accepted by music artists and listeners alike, as more songs and films were released that referenced disco. Examples of songs during this time that were influenced by disco included [[Deee-Lite]]'s \"[[Groove Is in the Heart]]\" (1990), [[U2 (band)|U2]]'s \"[[Lemon (U2 song)|Lemon]]\" (1993), [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s \"[[Girls & Boys (Blur song)|Girls & Boys]]\" (1994) & \"Entertain Me\" (1995), [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]]'s \"[[Disco 2000 (song)|Disco 2000]]\" (1995), and [[Jamiroquai]]'s \"[[Canned Heat (song)|Canned Heat]]\" (1999), while films such as ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Last Days of Disco]]'' (1998) featured primarily disco soundtracks.\n\n===2000\u2013present: Success of nu-disco and disco revival===\n[[File:04232012dae jpg semana de la cultura159.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Students from [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City]] dancing to disco during a cultural event on campus]]\nIn the early 2000s, an updated genre of disco called \"nu-disco\" began breaking into the mainstream. A few examples like [[Daft Punk]]'s \"[[One More Time (Daft Punk song)|One More Time]]\" and [[Kylie Minogue]]'s \"[[Love at First Sight (Kylie Minogue song)|Love At First Sight]]\" became club favorites and commercial successes. Several nu-disco songs were crossovers with [[funky house]], such as [[Spiller]]'s \"[[Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)]]\" and [[Modjo]]'s \"[[Lady (Hear Me Tonight)]]\", both songs sampling older disco songs and both reaching number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 2000. [[Robbie Williams]]' disco single \"[[Rock DJ]]\" was the UK's fourth best-selling single the same year. Rock band [[Manic Street Preachers]] released a disco song, \"Miss Europa Disco Dancer\", in 2001. The song's disco influence, which appears on ''[[Know Your Enemy (Manic Street Preachers album)|Know Your Enemy]]'', was described as being \"much-discussed\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/mar/16/shopping.culture1|title=Condemned to rock'n'roll|first=Garry|last=Mulholland|date=March 16, 2001|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> In 2005, Madonna immersed herself in the disco music of the 1970s, and released her album ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' to rave reviews. In addition to that, her song \"[[Hung Up]]\" became a major top-10 song and club staple, and sampled [[ABBA]]'s 1970s song \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\". In addition to her disco-influenced attire to award shows and interviews, her [[Confessions Tour]] also incorporated various elements of the 1970s, such as disco balls, a mirrored stage design, and the [[roller derby]].\n\nThe success of the \"nu-disco\" revival of the early 2000s was described by music critic Tom Ewing as more interpersonal than the pop music of the 1990s: \"The revival of disco within pop put a spotlight on something that had gone missing over the 90s: a sense of music not just for dancing, but for dancing with someone.

Other Motown artists who scored disco hits include: Robinson's former group, the Miracles, with [[Love Machine (The Miracles song)|\"Love Machine\"]] (1975), [[Eddie Kendricks]] with [[Keep on Truckin' (song)|\"Keep On Truckin'\"]] (1973), [[The Originals (band)|the Originals]] with \"[[Down to Love Town]]\" (1976) and [[Thelma Houston]] with her cover of the [[Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes]] song \"[[Don't Leave Me This Way]]\" (1976). The label continued to release successful disco songs into the 1980s with [[Rick James]]' \"[[Super Freak]]\" (1981), and the [[Commodores]]' \"[[Lady (You Bring Me Up)]]\" (1981).\n\nSeveral of Motown's solo artists who left the label went on to have successful disco songs. [[Mary Wells]], Motown's first female superstar with her signature song \"[[My Guy]]\" (written by Smokey Robinson), abruptly left the label in 1964. She briefly reappeared on the charts with the disco song [[Gigolo (Mary Wells song)|\"Gigolo\"]] in 1980. [[Jimmy Ruffin]], the elder brother of [[the Temptations]] lead singer [[David Ruffin]], was also signed to Motown, and released his most successful and well-known song \"[[What Becomes of the Brokenhearted]]\" as a single in 1966. Ruffin eventually left the record label in the mid-1970s, but saw success with the 1980 disco song \"[[Hold On (To My Love)]]\", which was written and produced by [[Robin Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]], for his album ''[[Sunrise (Jimmy Ruffin album)|Sunrise]]''. [[Edwin Starr]], known for his Motown protest song \"[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]\" (1970), reentered the charts in 1979 with a pair of disco songs, \"[[Contact (Edwin Starr song)|Contact]]\" and \"[[H.A.P.P.Y. Radio (song)|H.A.P.P.Y. Radio]]\".\n\n[[Kiki Dee]] became the first white British singer to sign with Motown in the US, and released one album, ''Great Expectations'' (1970), and two singles \"The Day Will Come Between Sunday and Monday\" (1970) and \"Love Makes The World Go Round\" (1971), the latter giving her first ever chart entry (number 87 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|US Chart]]). She soon left the company and signed with [[Elton John]]'s [[The Rocket Record Company]], and in 1976 had her biggest and best-known single, \"[[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]]\", a disco duet with John. The song was intended as an affectionate disco-style pastiche of the Motown sound, in particular the various duets recorded by Marvin Gaye with [[Tammi Terrell]] and [[Kim Weston]]. [[Michael Jackson]] released many successful solo singles under the Motown label, like [[Got to Be There (song)|\"Got To Be There\"]] (1971), [[Ben (song)|\"Ben\"]] (1972) and a cover of [[Bobby Day]]'s [[Rockin' Robin (song)|\"Rockin' Robin\"]] (1972). He went on to score hits in the disco genre with \"[[Rock with You]]\" (1979), \"[[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]]\" (1979) and \"[[Billie Jean]]\" (1983) for [[Epic Records]].\n\nMany Motown groups who had left the record label charted with disco songs. Michael Jackson was the lead singer of [[the Jackson 5]], one of Motown's premier acts in the early 1970s. They left the record company in 1975 ([[Jermaine Jackson]], however, remained with the label) after successful songs like \"[[I Want You Back]]\" (1969) and \"[[ABC (The Jackson 5 song)|ABC]]\" (1970), and even the disco song \"[[Dancing Machine]]\" (1974). Renamed as 'the Jacksons' (as Motown owned the name 'the Jackson 5'), they went on to find success with disco songs like \"[[Blame It on the Boogie]]\" (1978), \"[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]\" (1979) and [[Can You Feel It (The Jacksons song)|\"Can You Feel It?\"]] (1981) on the Epic label. [[the Isley Brothers]], whose short tenure at the company had produced the song \"[[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)]]\" in 1966, went on release successful disco songs like [[That Lady (song)|\"That Lady\"]] (1973) and \"[[It's a Disco Night (Rock Don't Stop)]]\" (1979). [[Gladys Knight and the Pips]], who recorded the most successful version of \"[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]\" (1967) before Marvin Gaye, scored commercially successful singles such as \"Baby, Don't Change Your Mind\" (1977) and \"Bourgie, Bourgie\" (1980) in the disco era.\n\n[[The Detroit Spinners]] were also signed to the Motown label and saw success with the Stevie Wonder-produced song \"[[It's a Shame (The Spinners song)|It's a Shame]]\" in 1970. They left soon after, on the advice of fellow [[Detroit]] native [[Aretha Franklin]], to [[Atlantic Records]], and there had disco songs like \"[[The Rubberband Man]]\" (1976). In 1979, they released a successful cover of Elton John's \"[[Are You Ready for Love]]\", as well as a medley of [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]]' song \"[[Working My Way Back to You]]\" and Michael Zager's \"Forgive Me, Girl\". The Four Seasons themselves were briefly signed to Motown's MoWest label, a short-lived subsidiary for R&B and soul artists based on the West Coast, and there the group produced one album, ''[[Chameleon (The Four Seasons album)|Chameleon]]'' (1972) \u2013 to little commercial success in the US. However, one single, [[The Night (Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons song)|\"The Night\"]], was released in Britain in 1975, and thanks to popularity from the [[Northern Soul]] circuit, reached number seven on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The Four Seasons left Motown in 1974 and went on to have a disco hit with their song \"[[December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)]]\" (1975) for [[Warner Curb Records]].\n\n[[Norman Whitfield]] was a producer at Motown, renowned for creating innovative \"[[psychedelic soul]]\" songs. The genre later developed into [[funk]], and from there into disco. [[The Undisputed Truth]], a Motown recording act assembled by Whitfield to experiment with his psychedelic soul production techniques, found success with their 1971 song \"[[Smiling Faces Sometimes]]\". The disco single \"You + Me = Love\" (number 43) in 1976, which also made number 2 on the [[Dance Club Songs|US Dance Charts]]. In 1977, singer, songwriter and producer [[Willie Hutch]] signed with Whitfield's new label. He had been signed to Motown since 1970, scored a successful disco single with his song [[In and Out (Willie Hutch song)|\"In and Out\"]].  The group [[Rose Royce]] produced the [[Car Wash: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|album soundtrack]] to the 1976 film [[Car Wash (film)|''Car Wash'']], which contained the commercially successful [[Car Wash (song)|song of the same name]].\n\nSinger [[Stacy Lattisaw]] signed with Motown ''after'' achieving success in the disco genre. In 1980, she released her album [[Let Me Be Your Angel (album)|''Let Me Be Your Angel'']], which spawned the disco singles \"[[Dynamite! (Stacy Lattisaw song)|Dynamite]]\" and \"[[Jump to the Beat]]\" on the [[Cotillion Records|Cotillion]] label. Lattisaw continued to enjoy success as a contemporary R&B/pop artist throughout the 1980s. She signed with Motown in 1986, and achieved most success when teaming up with [[Johnny Gill]], releasing the 1989 song [[Where Do We Go from Here (Stacy Lattisaw song)|\"Where Do We Go From Here?\"]] from her last ever album, ''What You Need'', before retiring. In addition, her first ever single, back in 1979, was a disco cover of \"[[When You're Young and in Love]]\", which was most famously recorded by Motown female group [[the Marvelettes]] in 1967.\n\nAdditionally, the debut single of [[Shalamar]], the group originally created as a disco-driven vehicle by ''[[Soul Train]]'' creator [[Don Cornelius]], was \"[[Uptown Festival]]\" (1977), a medley of 10 classic Motown songs sung over a 1970s disco beat.\n\n==Euro disco==\n{{Main|Euro disco}}\n{{Listen\n|filename = Donna Summer I Feel Love.ogg\n|title = Donna Summer \u2013 \"I Feel Love\" (1977)\n|description = [[Donna Summer]]'s \"[[I Feel Love]]\" (1977), produced by [[Giorgio Moroder]], was a seminal Euro disco song.\n}}\n\nAs disco's popularity sharply declined in the United States, abandoned by major U.S. record labels and producers, European disco continued evolving within the broad mainstream pop music scene.<ref>{{cite news|title=ARTS IN AMERICA; Here's to Disco, It Never Could Say Goodbye|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/10/arts/arts-in-america-here-s-to-disco-it-never-could-say-goodbye.html?pagewanted=3&src=pm|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 10, 2002}}</ref>  European acts [[Silver Convention]], [[Love & Kisses|Love and Kisses]], Munich Machine, and American acts Donna Summer and the [[Village People]], were acts that defined the late 1970s Euro disco sound.

This Swedish quartet, which sang in English, found success with singles such as \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\" (1974), \"[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]\" (1976), \"[[Take a Chance on Me]]\" (1978), \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\" (1979), and their signature smash \"[[Dancing Queen]]\" (1976)\u2014ranks as the [[List of best-selling music artists|eighth best-selling act of all time]]. Other prominent European [[Pop music|pop]] and disco groups were [[Luv']] from the Netherlands and [[Boney M.]], a group of four West Indian singers and dancers masterminded by West German record producer [[Frank Farian]]. Boney M. charted worldwide with such songs as \"[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)|Daddy Cool]]\", \"[[Ma Baker]]\" and \"[[Rivers Of Babylon]]\". Another Euro disco act was the French [[Amanda Lear]], where Euro-disco sound is most heard in [[Enigma (Give A Bit Of Mmh To Me)|Enigma (\"Give A Bit Of Mmh To Me\")]] song (1978).\n\nIn France, [[Dalida]] released \"[[J'attendrai]]\" (\"I Will Wait\"), which also became successful in Canada, Europe and Japan. [[Dalida]] successfully adjusted herself to disco era and released at least a dozen of songs that charted among top number 10 in whole Europe and wider.\n[[Claude Fran\u00e7ois]], who re-invented himself as the king of French disco, released \"La plus belle chose du monde\", a French version of the [[Bee Gees]] song \"[[Massachusetts (Bee Gees song)|Massachusetts]]\", which became successful in Canada and Europe and \"Alexandrie Alexandra\" was posthumously released on the day of his burial and became a worldwide success. [[Cerrone]]'s early songs, \"Love in C Minor\", \"Give Me Love\" and \"[[Supernature (Cerrone song)|Supernature]]\" were successful in the US and Europe.\n\n[[File:Fotothek df n-15 0000413 Disko.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Dancers at a German discoth\u00e8que in 1977]]\n\nIn Italy [[Raffaella Carr\u00e0]] is the most successful disco act.

The song is also known under its Spanish title \"Para hacer bien el amor hay que venir al sur\" (which refers to Southern Europe, since the song was recorded and taped in Spain). The Estonian version of the song \"J\u00e4tke v\u00f5tmed v\u00e4ljapoole\" was performed by [[Anne Veski]]. \"[[A far l'amore comincia tu]]\" (\"To make love, your move first\") was another success for her internationally, known in Spanish as \"En el amor todo es empezar\", in German as \"Liebelei\", in French as \"Puisque tu l'aimes dis le lui\", and in English as \"Do It, Do It Again\".

[[Synthesizer]]s are also fairly common in disco, especially in the late 1970s.\n\nThe [[rhythm section|rhythm]] is laid down by prominent, syncopated [[bassline]]s (with heavy use of broken [[octave]]s, that is, octaves with the notes sounded one after the other) played on the [[bass guitar]] and by drummers using a [[drum kit]], African/[[Latin percussion]], and [[electronic drum]]s such as Simmons and [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[sound module|drum modules]]. The sound was enriched with solo lines and [[harmony part]]s played by a variety of orchestral instruments, such as [[harp]], [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], [[trumpet]], [[saxophone]], [[trombone]], [[clarinet]], [[flugelhorn]], [[French horn]], [[tuba]], [[English horn]], [[oboe]], [[flute]] (sometimes especially the [[alto flute]] and occasionally [[bass flute]]), [[piccolo]], [[timpani]] and [[synthesizer|synth strings]], [[string section]] or a full [[string orchestra]].\n\nMost disco songs have a steady [[four-on-the-floor (music)|four-on-the-floor]] beat, a [[quaver]] or semi-quaver [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat, and a heavy, syncopated bass line. Other Latin rhythms such as the rhumba, the samba and the cha-cha-cha are also found in disco recordings, and Latin [[polyrhythm]]s, such as a rhumba beat layered over a merengue, are commonplace. The quaver pattern is often supported by other instruments such as the [[rhythm guitar]] and may be implied rather than explicitly present.\n\nSongs often use [[syncopation]], which is the accenting of unexpected beats. In general, the difference between a disco, or any dance song, and a rock or popular song is that in dance music the [[bass drum]] hits ''four to the floor'', at least once a beat (which in 4/4 time is 4 beats per measure), whereas in rock the bass hits on one and three and lets the snare take the lead on two and four (the \"[[backbeat]]\"). Disco is further characterized by a 16th note division of the quarter notes as shown in the second drum pattern below, after a typical rock drum pattern.\n\nThe orchestral sound usually known as \"disco sound\" relies heavily on [[string section]]s and horns playing linear phrases, in unison with the soaring, often reverberated vocals or playing instrumental fills, while electric pianos and chicken-scratch guitars create the background \"pad\" sound defining the [[chord progression|harmony progression]]. Typically, all of the doubling of parts and use of additional instruments creates a rich \"[[wall of sound]]\". There are, however, more minimalist flavors of disco with reduced, transparent instrumentation, pioneered by [[Chic (band)|Chic]].\n\nIn 1977, [[Giorgio Moroder]] again became responsible for a development in disco. Alongside Donna Summer and [[Pete Bellotte]] he wrote the song \"[[I Feel Love]]\" for Summer to perform. It became the first well-known disco song to have a completely synthesized backing track. The song is still considered to have been well ahead of its time. Other disco producers, most famously [[Tom Moulton]], grabbed ideas and techniques from [[dub music]] (which came with the increased [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] migration to New York City in the 1970s) to provide alternatives to the \"four on the floor\" style that dominated. DJ [[Larry Levan]] utilized styles from [[Dub music|dub]] and [[jazz]] and remixing techniques to create early versions of [[house music]] that sparked the genre.<ref>{{cite book\n| last =Shapiro\n| first =Peter\n| title =Modulations: A History of Electronic Music\n| publisher =Caipirinha Productions, Inc.\n|year=2000\n| location =\n| pages =254 pages\n| isbn =978-0-8195-6498-6 }} see p.45, 46</ref>\n\n===Production===\nThe \"disco sound\" was much more costly to produce than many of the other popular music genres from the 1970s. Unlike the simpler, four-piece band sound of the [[funk]], soul of the late 1960s, or the small [[jazz]] [[organ trio]]s, disco music often included a large pop band, with several chordal instruments (guitar, keyboards, synthesizer), several drum or percussion instruments (drumkit, Latin percussion, electronic drums), a [[horn section]], a [[string orchestra]], and a variety of \"classical\" solo instruments (for example, flute, piccolo, and so on).\n\nDisco songs were [[arrangement|arranged]] and composed by experienced arrangers and [[orchestration|orchestrators]], and [[record producer]]s added their creative touches to the overall sound using [[multitrack recording]] techniques and [[effects unit]]s. Recording complex arrangements with such a large number of instruments and sections required a team that included a [[Conductor (music)|conductor]], [[copyist]]s, [[record producer]]s, and [[audio engineering|mixing engineers]]. Mixing engineers had an important role in the disco production process, because disco songs used as many as 64 [[sound recording|tracks]] of vocals and instruments. Mixing engineers and record producers, under the direction of arrangers, compiled these tracks into a fluid composition of verses, bridges, and refrains, complete with [[orchestral build]]s and [[break (music)|breaks]]. Mixing engineers and record producers helped to develop the \"disco sound\" by creating a distinctive-sounding, sophisticated [[disco mix]].\n\nEarly records were the \"standard\" 3&nbsp;minute version until [[Tom Moulton]] came up with a way to make songs longer. Moulton wanted to make longer songs, so that he could take a crowd of dancers at a club to another level and keep them dancing longer. He found that was impossible to make the 45-RPM vinyl discs of the time longer, as they could usually hold no more than 5&nbsp;minutes of good-quality music. With the help of Jos\u00e9 Rodriguez, his remaster/mastering engineer, he pressed a single on a 10\" disc instead of 7\". They cut the next single on a 12\" disc, the same format as a standard album. Moulton and Rodriguez discovered that these larger records could have much longer songs and remixes. Twelve-inch records, even for singles, fast became the standard format for all DJs of the disco genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/disco/history.shtml|title=DISCO History @ Disco-Disco.com|website=www.disco-disco.com|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBecause record sales were often dependent on dance floor play by DJs in leading nightclubs, [[disc jockey|DJs]] were also important to the development and popularization of disco music. By selecting and playing disco songs, DJs helped to make certain songs more or less popular. Notable disco DJs include the first female disco DJ in the US, [[Karen Mixon Cook]], and many other DJs, such as [[Jim Burgess (producer)|Jim Burgess]], [[Walter Gibbons]], [[John \"Jellybean\" Benitez]], Richie Kaczar of [[Studio 54]], Rick Gianatos, [[Francis Grasso]] of Sanctuary, [[Larry Levan]], [[Ian Levine]] and [[David Mancuso]]. DJs not only played songs in clubs; they also remixed, looped and live-mixed these songs from the DJ booth, changing the ways songs sounded. For example, a DJ might use the intro or bassline from a popular disco track and [[beatmatching|beatmatch]] and layer the vocals from a second song over top. As well, some DJs were also [[record producer]]s who created and produced disco songs in the [[recording studio]]. [[Larry Levan]], for example, is as well known for his prolific record producer work as for his contributions as a DJ.\n\n==Disco clubs and culture==\n{{See also|Circuit parties}}\n[[File:Blue disco quad roller skates.jpg|thumb|Blue disco quad [[roller skates]].]]\nBy the late 1970s most major US cities had thriving disco club scenes, but the largest scenes were in [[San Francisco]], [[Miami]], and most notably [[New York City]]. The scene was centered on [[discotheque]]s, nightclubs, and private loft parties where [[DJ]]s would play disco tracks from discs and records through [[PA system]]s for the patrons who came to dance. Powerful, bass-heavy, [[hi-fi]] [[Sound reinforcement system|sound systems]] were viewed as a key part of the disco club experience. \"Mancuso introduced the technologies of tweeter arrays (clusters of small loudspeakers, which emit high-end frequencies, positioned above the floor) and bass reinforcements (additional sets of [[subwoofer]]s positioned at ground level) at the start of the 1970s in order to boost the treble and bass at opportune moments, and by the end of the decade [[sound engineer]]s such as Richard Long had multiplied the effects of these innovations in venues such as the Garage.\"<ref name=\"timlawrence.info\"/> The DJs played \"...&nbsp;a smooth mix of long single records to keep people 'dancing all night long'\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/doss13.htm|title=The Body and soul of club culture|website=unesco.org|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}</ref> Some of the most prestigious clubs had elaborate lighting systems that throbbed to the beat of the music.\n\nIn the 1970s, notable discos included \"Artemis\" in Philadelphia, \"Studio One\" in Los Angeles, \"Leviticus\" in New York, \"Dugan's Bistro\" in Chicago, and \"The Library\" in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phillymag.com/property/2016/05/18/once-a-hot-disco-now-a-cool-opportunity/|title=Once a Hot Disco, Now a Cool Opportunity \u2013 Philadelphia Magazine|date=May 18, 2016|website=Phillymag.com|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}</ref><ref name=Disco197510/> In the late 70s, [[Studio 54]] in [[New York City]] was arguably the most well known nightclub in the world. This club played a major formative role in the growth of disco music and [[nightclub]] culture in general. The [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]], another New York nightclub dating to the 1940s, had a revival in the late 1970s when it embraced disco; it would become the setting of a [[Barry Manilow]] [[Copacabana (At the Copa)|song of the same name]].\n\n===Disco dancing===\n[[File:04232012dae jpg semana de la cultura162.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Disco dancers typically wore loose slacks for men and flowing dresses for women, which enabled ease of movement on the dance floor.]]\nIn the early years, dancers in discos danced in a \"hang loose\" or \"freestyle\" approach. At first, many dancers improvised their own dance styles and dance steps. Later in the disco era, popular dance styles were developed, including the \"Bump\", \"Penguin\", \"Boogaloo\", \"Watergate\" and the \"Robot\". By October 1975 [[Hustle (dance)|The Hustle]] reigned. It was highly stylized, sophisticated and overtly sexual. Variations included the Brooklyn Hustle, [[New York Hustle]] and [[Latin Hustle]].<ref name=\"Disco197510\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gQQ1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=Fk8KAAAAIBAJ&pg=840,3518488&dq=disco+music&hl=en Everybody's Doing The hustle], Associated Press, October 16, 1975</ref>\n\nDuring the disco era, many nightclubs would commonly host disco dance competitions or offer free dance lessons. Some cities had disco dance instructors or dance schools, which taught people how to do popular disco dances such as ''\"touch dancing'', ''\"the hustle'', and ''[[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|the cha cha]]''. The pioneer of disco dance instruction was Karen Lustgarten in San Francisco in 1973. Her book ''The Complete Guide to Disco Dancing'' (Warner Books, 1978) was the first to name, break down and codify popular disco dances as dance forms and distinguish between disco freestyle, partner and line dances. The book topped the ''New York Times'' bestseller list for 13 weeks and was translated into Chinese, German and French.\n\nIn Chicago, the ''Step By Step'' disco dance TV show was launched with the sponsorship support of the Coca-Cola company. Produced in the same studio that [[Don Cornelius]] used for the nationally syndicated dance/music television show, ''[[Soul Train]]'', ''Step by Step'''s audience grew and the show became a success. The dynamic dance duo of Robin and Reggie led the show. The pair spent the week teaching disco dancing to dancers in the disco clubs. The instructional show which aired on Saturday mornings had a following of dancers who would stay up all night on Fridays so they could be on the set the next morning, ready to return to the disco on Saturday night knowing with the latest personalized dance steps. The producers of the show, John Reid and Greg Roselli, routinely made appearances at disco functions with Robin and Reggie to scout out new dancing talent and promote upcoming events such as \"Disco Night at White Sox Park\".\n\nSome notable professional dance troupes of the 1970s included [[Pan's People]] and [[Hot Gossip]]. For many dancers, a key source of inspiration for 1970s disco dancing was the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977). This developed into the music and dance style of such films as ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' (1980), ''[[Disco Dancer]]'' (1982), ''[[Flashdance]]'' (1983), and ''[[The Last Days of Disco]]'' (1998). Interest in disco dancing also helped spawn [[Reality TV|dance competition TV shows]] such as ''[[Dance Fever]]'' (1979).\n\n===Disco fashion===\nDisco fashions were very trendy in the late 1970s. Discoth\u00e8que-goers often wore glamorous, expensive and extravagant fashions for nights out at their local disco club. Some women would wear sheer, flowing dresses, such as [[Halston]] dresses or loose, flared pants. Other women wore tight, revealing, sexy clothes, such as backless [[halter top]]s, \"hot pants\" or body-hugging [[spandex]] bodywear or \"catsuits\".<ref name=\"ultimatehistoryproject.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatehistoryproject.com/disco-fashion.html|title=Disco Fashion:  That's the way They Liked It|website=The Ultimate History Project|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}</ref> Men would wear shiny polyester [[Qiana]] shirts with colorful patterns and pointy, extra wide collars, preferably open at the chest. Men often wore [[Pierre Cardin]] suits, [[three piece suit]]s with a vest and [[Double knitting|double-knit]] polyester shirt jackets with matching trousers known as the [[leisure suit]]. Men's leisure suits were typically form-fitted in some parts of the body, such as the waist and bottom, but the lower part of the pants were flared in a [[bell bottom]] style, to permit freedom of movement.<ref name=\"ultimatehistoryproject.com\"/>\n\nDuring the disco era, men engaged in elaborate grooming rituals and spent time choosing fashion clothing, both activities that would have been considered \"feminine\" according to the gender stereotypes of the era.<ref name=\"ultimatehistoryproject.com\"/> Women dancers wore [[glitter]] makeup, [[sequin]]s or [[gold lam\u00e9]] clothing that would shimmer under the lights.<ref name=\"ultimatehistoryproject.com\"/> Bold colors were popular for both genders.

While the dance floor was the central arena of [[seduction]], actual sex usually took place in the nether regions of the disco: bathroom stalls, exit [[stairwell]]s, and so on.

Studio 54 was notorious for the [[hedonism]] that went on within; the balconies were known for [[sexual encounters]], and drug use was rampant. Its dance floor was decorated with an image of the \"[[Man in the Moon]]\" that included an animated [[cocaine spoon]].\n\n==Influence on other music==\n===1982\u20131990: Post-disco and dance {{Anchor|1982\u20131990: Post disco and dance}}===\n{{Main|Post-disco|Electronic dance music}}\nThe transition from the late-1970s disco styles to the early-1980s dance styles was marked primarily by the change from complex arrangements performed by [[big band|large ensembles]] of studio [[session musician]]s (including a [[horn section]] and an orchestral [[string section]]), to a leaner sound, in which one or two singers would perform to the accompaniment of [[synthesizer]] [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[drum machine]]s.\n\nIn addition, [[dance music]] during the 1981\u201383 period borrowed elements from [[blues]] and [[jazz]], creating a style different from the disco of the 1970s. This emerging music was still known as disco for a short time, as the word had become associated with any kind of dance music played in [[discoth\u00e8que]]s. Examples of early-1980s' dance sound performers include [[D Train (music group)|D. Train]], [[Kashif (musician)|Kashif]], and [[Patrice Rushen]]. These changes were influenced by some of the notable R&B and jazz musicians of the 1970s, such as Stevie Wonder, Kashif and [[Herbie Hancock]], who had pioneered \"[[Multi-instrumentalist|one-man-band]]\"-type keyboard techniques. Some of these influences had already begun to emerge during the mid-1970s, at the height of disco's popularity.\n\nDuring the first years of the 1980s, the disco sound began to be phased out, and faster tempos and synthesized effects, accompanied by guitar and simplified backgrounds, moved dance music toward the [[funk]] and pop genres. This trend can be seen in singer [[Billy Ocean]]'s recordings between 1979 and 1981. Whereas Ocean's 1979 song ''American Hearts'' was backed with an orchestral arrangement played by the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra, his 1981 song ''\"One of Those Nights (Feel Like Gettin' Down)\"'' had a more bare, stripped-down sound, with no orchestration or [[Symphony|symphonic]] arrangements. This drift from the original disco sound is called [[post-disco]]. In this music scene there are rooted subgenres, such as [[Italo disco]], [[techno]], [[house music|house]], [[dance-pop]], [[boogie (genre)|boogie]], and early [[alternative dance]].<ref name=\"AMG1\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d13417|pure_url=yes}}|title=Explore music&nbsp;... Genre: Post-disco |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=April 11, 2009}}</ref> During the early 1980s, dance music dropped the complicated song structure and orchestration that typified the disco sound.\n\n===TV themes===\nDuring the 1970s, many TV theme songs were produced (or older themes updated) with disco influenced music. Examples include ''[[S.W.A.T. (1975 TV series)|S.W.A.T.]]'' (1975), ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' (1975), ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (1976), ''NBC Saturday Night At The Movies'' (1976), ''[[The Love Boat]]'' (1977), ''[[The Donahue Show]]'' (1977), ''[[CHiPs]]'' (1977), ''[[The Professionals (TV series)|The Professionals]]'' (1977), ''[[Three's Company]]'' (1977), ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' (1978), [[NBC Sports]] broadcasts (1978), ''[[Kojak]]'' (1977), ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]'' (1979). The British science fiction program ''[[Space: 1999]]'' (1975) also featured a soundtrack strongly influenced by disco, especially in the show's second season.\n\n===DJ culture===\n{{See also|List of DJ Magazine's Top 100 DJs}}[[File:Plattenspieler Technics SL-1200MK2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The precise variable [[pitch control]] on the Technics SL-1200 MK2, first sold in 1978, helped DJs to develop better [[beatmatching]], a crucial skill for creating a seamless transition from one song to another.]]\n\nThe rising popularity of disco came in tandem with developments in the role of the [[DJ]]. DJing developed from the use of multiple record turntables and [[DJ mixer]]s to create a continuous, seamless mix of songs, with one song transitioning to another with no break in the music to interrupt the dancing. The resulting [[DJ mix]] differed from previous forms of dance music in the 1960s, which were oriented towards live performances by musicians. This in turn affected the arrangement of dance music, since songs in the disco era typically contained beginnings and endings marked by a simple beat or riff that could be easily used to transition to a new song. The development of DJing was also influenced by new [[turntablism]] techniques, such as [[beatmatching]], a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the [[Technics SL-1200|Technics SL-1200 MK 2]], first sold in 1978, which had a precise variable [[pitch control]] and a [[direct drive]] motor. DJs were often avid record collectors, who would hunt through used record stores for obscure [[soul music|soul]] records and vintage [[funk]] recordings. DJs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences.\n\nIn the 1970s, individual DJs became more prominent, and some DJs, such as [[Larry Levan]], the resident at [[Paradise Garage]], [[Jim Burgess (producer)|Jim Burgess]], [[Tee Scott]] and [[Francis Grasso]] became famous in the disco scene. Levan, for example, developed a [[cult following]] among club-goers, who referred to his DJ sets as \"[[Mass (liturgy)|Saturday Mass]]\". Some DJs would use [[reel to reel tape recorder]]s to make [[remix]]es and tape edits of songs. Some DJs who were making remixes made the transition from the DJ booth to becoming a [[record producer]], notably Burgess. Scott developed several innovations. He was the first disco DJ to use three turntables as sound sources, the first to simultaneously play two beat matched records, the first user of electronic [[effects unit]]s in his mixes and an innovator in mixing dialogue in from well-known movies into his mixes, typically over a percussion break. These mixing techniques were also applied to radio DJs, such as Ted Currier of [[WKTU]] and [[WBLS]]. Grasso is particularly notable for taking the DJ \u201cprofession out of servitude and [making] the DJ the musical head chef\u201d.<ref>Brewster, Bill and Broughton, Frank (1999). Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey. Headline Book Publishing Ltd.</ref> Once he entered the scene, the DJ was no longer responsible for waiting on the crowd hand and foot, meeting their every song request. Instead, with increased agency and visibility, the DJ was now able to use his own technical and creative skills to whip up a nightly special of innovative mixes, refining his personal sound and aesthetic, and building his own reputation. Known as the first DJ to create a take his audience on a narrative, musical journey, Grasso discovered that music could effectively shift the energy of the crowd, and even more, that he had all this power at his fingertips.\n\n===Rave culture===\n{{main|Rave}}\n[[File:RaveOn.jpg|thumb|right|Strobing lights flash at a [[rave]] dance event in [[Vienna]], 2005]]\nAbout five years after the disco era came to a close in the late 1970s, [[rave]] culture began to emerge from the [[acid house]] scene.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://music.hyperreal.org/library/history_of_house.html |title = The History Of House |accessdate = August 13, 2013 | author = Phil Cheeseman-fu |publisher=''[[DJ Magazine]]''}}</ref> Rave culture incorporated disco culture's same love of dance music played by [[DJ]]s over powerful [[PA system|sound systems]], [[recreational drug]] and [[club drug]] exploration, sexual promiscuity, and [[hedonism]]. Although disco culture started out underground, it eventually thrived in the mainstream by the late 1970s, and major labels commodified and packaged the music for [[mass consumption]]. In contrast, the rave culture started out underground and stayed underground. In part this was to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music. The rave scene also stayed underground to avoid [[law enforcement]] attention that was directed at the rave culture due to its use of secret, unauthorized warehouses for some dance events and its association with illegal club drugs like [[Ecstasy (drug)|Ecstasy]].\n\n===Hip hop and electro===\n{{main|Hip hop music|Electro (music)}}\n\nThe disco sound had a strong influence on early [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Most of the early hip hop songs were created by isolating existing disco bass-guitar lines and dubbing over them with MC rhymes. [[The Sugarhill Gang]] used [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s \"[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]\" as the foundation for their 1979 song \"[[Rapper's Delight]]\", generally considered to be the song that first popularized rap music in the United States and around the world. In 1982, [[Afrika Bambaataa]] released the single \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]\", which incorporated [[electronica]] elements from [[Kraftwerk]]'s \"[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]\" and \"Numbers\" as well as [[Yellow Magic Orchestra|YMO]]'s \"Riot in Lagos\".\n\nThe Planet Rock sound also spawned a [[hip hop]] [[Electronic dance music|electronic dance]] trend, [[electro music]], which included songs such as [[Planet Patrol]]'s \"Play at Your Own Risk\" (1982), C Bank's \"One More Shot\" (1982), [[Cerrone]]'s \"Club Underworld\" (1984), [[Shannon (singer)|Shannon]]'s \"[[Let the Music Play (song)|Let the Music Play]]\" (1983), [[Freeez]]'s \"I.O.U.\" (1983), [[Midnight Star]]'s \"Freak-a-Zoid\" (1983), [[Chaka Khan]]'s \"[[I Feel For You]]\" (1984).\n\n===House music===\n{{Main|House music}}\n[[File:Miguel Migs by Peter Chiapperino.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Like disco, house music was based around [[DJ]]s creating mixes for dancers in clubs.

It was initially popularized in Chicago, circa 1984. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, and Newark \u2013 all of which developed their own regional scenes. In the mid- to late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia.<ref name=unesco_4>{{cite journal | url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001201/120152e.pdf | title=The club DJ: a brief history of a cultural icon | publisher=UNESCO | date=July\u2013August 2000 | last=Fikentscher | first=Kai | journal=UNESCO Courier | page=47 | quote=Around 1986/7, after the initial explosion of house music in [[Chicago]], it became clear that the major recording companies and media institutions were reluctant to market this genre of music, associated with gay African Americans, on a mainstream level.

Since the early to mid-1990s, house music has been infused in mainstream [[Pop music|pop]] and [[dance music]] worldwide.\n\nEarly house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive [[four on the floor (music)|four on the floor]] beats, rhythms mainly provided by [[drum machine]]s,<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/house-ma0000002651 |title=House : Significant Albums, Artists and Songs, Most Viewed |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=October 12, 2012}}</ref> off-beat [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalist,<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. As well, house did not use the lush [[string section]]s that were a key part of the disco sound. House music in the 2010s, while keeping several of these core elements, notably the prominent [[kick drum]] on every beat, varies widely in style and influence, ranging from the soulful and atmospheric [[deep house]] to the more minimalist [[microhouse]].

For example, in addition to the standard tune types such as Jigs and Reels, the Donegal tradition also has Highlands (influenced by the Scottish [[Strathspey (dance)|Strathspey]]). The distinctiveness of the Donegal tradition led to some conflict between Donegal players and representatives of the mainstream tradition when Irish traditional music was organised in the 1960s.\n\nThe tradition has several distinguishing traits compared to other fiddle traditions such as the [[Sliabh Luachra]] style of southern ireland, most of which involves styles of [[Bow (music)|bowing]] and the [[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]] of the music, and rhythm. Due to the frequency of double stops and the strong bowing it is often compared to the [[Cape Breton fiddling|Cape Breton]] tradition.<ref>June Skinner Sawyers. 2001. Celtic music: a complete guide.

Donegal]] in 2007.]]\nThe fiddle has ancient roots in Ireland, the first report of bowed instruments similar to the violin being in the [[Book of Leinster]] (ca. 1160). The modern violin was ubiquitous in Ireland by the early 1700s. However the first mention of the fiddle being in use in Donegal is from the blind harper [[Artur O'Neill (harpist)|Arthur O'Neill]] who in his 1760 memoirs described a wedding in [[Ardara, County Donegal|Ardara]] as having \"plenty of pipers and fiddlers\".<ref name=\"ReferenceACh2\">Between the Jigs and the Reels: The Donegal Fiddle Tradition C Mac Aoidh \u2013 1994 \u2013 Drumlin Publications</ref><ref name=\"Music D McLaughlin pp. 22\">Donegal and Shetland Fiddle Music D McLaughlin, Irish Traditional Music Society \u2013 1992 \u2013 Irish Traditional Music Society, University College, Cork.

However, Donegal musicians, many of them being fishermen, also frequently travelled to Scotland, where they acquired tune types from the [[Traditional music of Scotland|Scottish repertoire]] such as the [[Strathspey (dance)|Strathspey]] which was integrated into the Donegal tradition as \"Highland\" tunes. The Donegal tradition derives much of its unique character from the synthesis of Irish and Scottish stylistic features and repertoires.<ref name=\"ReferenceACh2\"/><ref name=\"Music D McLaughlin pp. 22\"/> Aoidh notes however that while different types of art music were commonly played among the upper classes of Scottish society in the 18th century, the Donegal tradition drew exclusively from the popular types of Scottish music.<ref name=\"ReferenceACh2\"/><ref>Donegal and Shetland Fiddle Music D McLaughlin, Irish Traditional Music Society \u2013 1992 \u2013 Irish Traditional Music Society, University College, Cork</ref><ref name = \"jrqigj\">Changing cultural landscapes: the co-existence of musical genres in Irish culture and education.

Describing the musical life of Arranmore Island in the late 19th century singer R\u00f3ise Rua Nic Gr\u00edanna describes the most popular dances: \"The Sets, the Lancers, the Maggie Pickie [i.e., Maggie Pickins] the Donkey, the [[Mazurka]] and the [[Barn dance]]s\". Among the travelling fiddlers of the late 19th century players such as John Mhosa\u00ed McGinley, Anthony Hilferty, the McConnells and the Dohertys are best known. As skill levels increased through apprenticeships several fiddle masters appeared such as the Cassidy's, Connie Haughey, Jimmy Lyons and Miock McShane of Teelin and Francie Dearg and Mickey B\u00e1n Byrne of Kilcar. These virtuosos played unaccompanied listening pieces in addition to the more common dance music.<ref name=\"ReferenceACh2\"/>\n\nThe influences between Scotland and Donegal went both ways and were furthered by a wave of immigration from Donegal to Scotland in the 19th century<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indigo.ie/~donances/FrameSet3.html|title=Some Donegal Surnames|accessdate=8 March 2008|publisher=Donegal Ancestry}}</ref> (the regions share common names of dances), as can be heard in the volume of strathspeys, [[schottische]]s, [[march (music)|marches]], and Donegal's own strong piping tradition, has influenced and been influenced by music, and by the sounds, ornaments, and repertoire of the [[Piob Mhor|P\u00edob Mh\u00f3r]], the traditional bagpipes of Ireland and Scotland.<ref name=\"ss\">{{cite web|url=http://www.standingstones.com/donegalf.html|title=The Fiddle Music of Donegal|accessdate=8 March 2008|author=Michael Robinson|publisher=The Standing Stones}}</ref> There are other differences between the Donegal style and the rest of Ireland. Instruments such as the tin whistle, flute, concertina and accordion were very rare in Donegal until modern times.<ref name=\"ReferenceACh2\"/> Traditionally the p\u00edob m\u00f3r and the fiddle were the only instruments used and the use of pipe or fiddle music was common in old wedding customs. Migrant workers carried their music to Scotland and also brought back a number of tunes of Scottish origin.<ref name = \"jrqigj\"/> The Donegal fiddlers may well have been the route by which Scottish tunes such as Lucy Campbell, Tarbolton Lodge (Tarbolton) and The Flagon (The Flogging Reel), that entered the Irish repertoire.<ref name = \"jrqigj\"/> These players prided themselves on their technical abilities, which included playing in higher positions (fairly uncommon among traditional Irish fiddlers), and sought out material which would demonstrate their skills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irishfiddle.com/mcguireinterview.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011125053708/http://www.irishfiddle.com/mcguireinterview.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 November 2001 |title=Sean McGuire: Master of The Irish Violin |accessdate=8 March 2008 |author=Ken Perlman |publisher=The Irish Fiddle |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAs Irish music was consolidated and organised under the [[Comhaltas Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed \u00c9ireann]] movement in the 1960s, both strengthened the interest in traditional music but sometimes conflicted with the Donegal tradition and its social conventions. The rigidly organised sessions of the Comhaltas reflected the traditions of Southern Ireland and Donegal fiddlers like John Doherty considered the National repertoire with its strong focus on reels to be less diverse than that of Donegal with its varied rhythms. Other old fiddlers dislike the ways comhaltas sessions were organised with a committee player, often not himself a musician, in charge. Sometimes Comhaltas representatives would even disparage the Donegal tradition, with its Scottish flavour, as being un-Irish, and prohibit them from playing local tunes with Scottish genealogies such as the \"Highlands\" at Comhaltas sessions. This sometimes cause antagonism between Donegal players and the main organisation of traditional music in ireland.<ref name=\"ReferenceACh2\"/><ref name=\"Music D McLaughlin pp. 22\"/>\n\nOutside of the Comhaltas movement however, Donegal fiddling stood strong with [[Paddy Glackin]] of Ceoltor\u00ed Laighean and the [[Bothy Band]] and later [[Tommy Peoples]] also with the Bothy Band and Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh with [[Altan (band)|Altan]], who all drew attention and prestige to the Donegal tradition within folk music circles throughout Ireland.\n\n==Description of style==\n[[File:Donegalfiddle.PNG|thumb|right|450px|An example of the described musical styles.]]\nThe Donegal style of fiddling is a label often applied to music from this area, though one also might plausibly identify several different, but related, styles within the county.<ref name=\"ss\"/> To the extent to which there is one common style in the county, it is characterised by a rapid pace; a tendency to be more un-[[Swung note|swung]] in the playing of the fast dance tune types ([[reel (dance)|reel]] and [[jig]]s); short (non-[[Slur (music)|slurred]]), aggressive bowing, sparse ornamentation, the use of bowed [[Tuplet|triplets]] more often than [[Trill consonant|trills]] as [[musical ornament|ornaments]], the use of [[double stop]]s and droning; and the occurrence of \"playing the octave\", with one player playing the melody and the other playing the melody an octave lower. None of these characteristics are universal, and there is some disagreement as to the extent to which there is a common style at all. In general, however, the style is rather aggressive.<ref name=\"intro\"/>\n\nAnother feature of Donegal fiddling that makes it distinctive among Irish musical traditions is the variety of rare tune types that are played. [[Highland (Irish)|Highlands]], a type of tune in [[4/4 time]] with some similarities to Scottish [[strathspey (dance)|strathspeys]], which are also played in Donegal, are one of the most commonly played types of tune in the county. Other tune types common solely in the county include barndances, also called \"Germans,\" and [[mazurka]]s.<ref name=\"ma\" />\n\n==Fiddlers of the Donegal tradition==\n[[File:James-Byrne.jpg|thumb|right|300px|James Byrne \u2013 Glencolumbkille 2 August 2007 <br /> Photo: Rik Walton]]\n\n===Historical===\n[[File:Donegalmap.jpg|alt=Map of County Donegal showing mountainous regions and lowlands adjacent to the water.|right|thumb|Map showing the geography and some of the different regions of Donegal.]]There are a number of different strands to the history of fiddle playing in County Donegal.<ref name=\"ma\">{{Cite journal|title=Between the Jigs and the Reels: The Donegal Fiddle Tradition|first=C. |last=MacAoidh|year=1994|publisher=Drumlin Publications|page=125|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Perhaps the best-known and, in the last half of the twentieth century, the most influential has been that of the Doherty family.<ref name=\"mustrad\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiddlesessions.com/oct06/mccarrick.html |title=Famous Fiddlers, General Knowledge and Where to Get It Part Three |accessdate=8 March 2008 |author=Tim McCarrick |publisher=Mel Bay Publications, Inc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825211725/http://www.fiddlesessions.com/oct06/McCarrick.html |archivedate=25 August 2007 }}</ref> [[Hugh Doherty (musician)|Hugh Doherty]] is the first known musician of this family.

The lever and the [[Safety (firearms)|safety catch]] can also be clearly seen.]]\n\nA '''double-barreled shotgun''' is a [[shotgun]] with two parallel [[Gun barrel|barrels]], allowing two shots to be fired in quick succession.\n\n==Construction==\nModern double-barreled shotguns, often known as ''doubles'', are almost universally [[Break action|break open]] actions, with the barrels tilting up at the rear to expose the breech ends of the barrels for unloading and reloading.  Since there is no reciprocating action needed to eject and reload the [[shotgun shell|shells]], doubles are more compact than repeating designs such as [[pump action]] or [[lever-action]] shotguns.\n\n===Barrel configuration===\n{{see also|coach gun|sawed-off shotgun}}\nDouble-barreled shotguns come in two basic configurations: the '''side-by-side shotgun''' (SxS) and the '''over/under shotgun''' (\"over and under\", O/U, etc.), indicating the arrangement of barrels.  The original double-barreled guns were nearly all SxS designs, which was a more practical design  of [[muzzle-loading]] [[firearm]]s.  Early [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] shotguns also used the SxS action, because they kept the exposed hammers of the earlier muzzle-loading shotguns from which they evolved.  When [[hammerless]] designs started to become common, the O/U design was introduced, and most modern sporting doubles are O/U designs.<ref name=\"tbm\">{{citation|title=Twin barrel myths: side-by-side vs. over-under |work=Guns Magazine |date=July 2010 |author=John Barsness |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_7_56/ai_n56222158/ }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOne significant advantage that doubles have over single barrel repeating shotguns is the ability to provide access to more than one choke at a time.  Some shotgun sports, such as [[Skeet shooting|skeet]], use crossing targets presented in a narrow range of distance, and only require one level of choke. Others, like [[sporting clays]], give the shooter targets at differing ranges, and targets that might approach or recede from the shooter, and so must be engaged at differing ranges.  Having two barrels lets the shooter use a more open choke for near targets, and a tighter choke for distant targets, providing the optimal shot pattern for each distance.\n\nTheir disadvantage lies in the fact that the barrels of a double-barreled shotgun, whether ''O/U'' or ''SxS'', are not parallel, but slightly angled, so that shots from the barrels converge, usually at \"40 yards out\". For the ''SxS'' configuration, the shotstring continues on its path to the opposite side of the rib after the converging point; for example, the left barrel's discharge travels on the left of the rib till it hits dead center at 40 yards out, after that, the discharge continues on to the right. In the ''O/U'' configuration with a parallel rib, both barrels' discharges will keep to the dead center, but the discharge from the \"under\" barrel will shoot higher than the discharge from the \"over\" barrel after 40 yards. Thus, double-barreled shotguns are accurate only at practical shotgun ranges, though the range of their ammunition easily exceeds four to six times that distance.\n\n''SxS'' shotguns are often more expensive, and may take more practice to aim effectively than a ''O/U''. The off-center nature of the recoil in a ''SxS'' gun may make shooting the body-side barrel slightly more painful by comparison to an ''O/U'', single-shot, or pump/lever action shotgun. Gas-operated, and to a lesser extent recoil-operated, designs will recoil less than either. More ''SxS'' than ''O/U'' guns have traditional 'cast-off' stocks, where the end of the buttstock veers slightly to the right, allowing a right-handed user to point the gun more easily.<ref name=\"tbm\"/>\n\nDouble shotguns are also inherently more safe, as whether the shotgun is loaded or can be fired can be ascertained by anyone present if the action is broken open, for instance on a skeet, trap or hunting clays course when another shooter is firing; if the action is open, the gun cannot fire. Similarly, doubles are more easily examined to see if loaded than pump or semi-automatic shotguns, whose bolt must be opened and chamber closely examined or felt to make sure it is unloaded; with a double gun (or a break-action single gun), whether the gun is loaded, i.e., has cartridges in any chamber, is easily and immediately seen with a glance (and just as easily unloaded).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Trigger mechanism===\nThe early doubles used two triggers, one for each barrel.  These were located front to back inside the trigger guard, the index finger being used to pull either trigger, as having two fingers inside the trigger guard can cause a very undesirable recoil induced double-discharge. Double trigger designs are typically set up for right-handed users.<ref name=\"tbm\"/> In double trigger designs, it is often possible to pull both triggers at once, firing both barrels simultaneously, though this is generally not recommended as it doubles the recoil, battering both shotgun and shooter, particularly if it was unanticipated or unintended. Discharging both barrels at the same time has long been a hunting trick employed by hunters using 8 gauge \"elephant\" shotguns, firing the two two-ounce slugs for sheer stopping power at close range.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nLater models use a single trigger that alternately fires both barrels, called a ''single selective trigger'' or ''SST''.  The SST does not allow firing both barrels at once, since the single trigger must be pulled twice in order to fire both barrels.  The change from one barrel to the other may be done by a [[clockwork]] type system, where a cam alternates between barrels, or by an [[inertia]]l system where the recoil of firing the first barrel toggles the trigger to the next barrel. A double-barreled shotgun with an inertial trigger works best with full power shotshells; shooting low recoil shotshells often will not reliably toggle the inertial trigger, causing an apparent failure to fire occasionally when attempting to depress the trigger a second time to fire the second barrel (this also can happen if the first shell fails to fire).  Generally there is a method of selecting the order in which the barrels of an SST shotgun fire; commonly this is done through manipulation of the [[Safety (firearms)|safety]], pushing to one side to select top barrel first and the other side to select bottom barrel first.  In the event that an inertial trigger does not toggle to the second barrel when firing low recoil shotshells, manually selecting the order to the second barrel will enable the second barrel to fire when the trigger is depressed again.\n\nOne of the advantages of the double, with double triggers or SST, is that a second shot can be taken almost immediately after the first, without removing the gun from the firing position on the shoulder and without any other action than a second trigger pull, utilizing different chokes for the two shots. (Assuming, of course, that full power shotshells are fired, at least for a double-barreled shotgun with an inertial type SST, as needed to toggle the inertial trigger.) This can be noticeably faster than a pump shotgun, which requires pumping to eject and reload for the second shot, and may be faster, or not slower, than a semi-automatic action. Note, however, in neither the pump or semi-automatic will the second shot be a different choke pattern from the first shot, whereas for a double, the two shots are usually with different chokes.  Thus, depending on the nature of the hunt, the appropriate choke for the shot is always at hand.  For example, while field hunting flushing birds, the first shot is usually closer than the second because the bird flies away from the shooter; so, the more open choke (and barrel) would be better for the first shot, and if a second shot is needed, as the bird is flying away, the more closed (and thus longer distance of an effective shot pattern) choke (and barrel) is then appropriate.  Conversely, on a driven hunt, where the birds are driven towards the shooter, the closed (longer effective distance) choke (and barrel) should be fired first, saving the open (closer effective distance) choke (and barrel) for the now-closer incoming bird. None of this is possible with single-barrel shotguns, only with a double, whether SxS or O/U.\n\n===Regulation===\n''Regulation'' is a term used for multi-barreled firearms that indicates how close to the same point of aim the barrels will shoot.  Regulation is very important, because a poorly regulated gun may hit consistently with one barrel, but miss consistently with the other, making the gun nearly useless for anything requiring two shots.  However, the short ranges and spread of shot provide a significant overlap, so a small error in regulation in a double is often too small to be noticed.  Generally the shotguns are regulated to hit the point of aim at a given distance, usually the maximum expected range since that is the range at which a full choke is used, and where precise regulation matters most.\n\n==Regional use==\nThe double-barreled shotgun is seen as a weapon of prestige and authority in rural parts of [[India]],{{cn|date=September 2013}} where it is known as ''Dunali''<ref>{{cite book|title=The Popular Dictionary in English and Hindustani and Hindustani and English: With a Number of Useful Tables|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMcvAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA48|accessdate=1 September 2013|year=1881|publisher=Methodist Episcopal Church Press|page=48}}</ref> (literally \"two pipes\").

The proportions of these ingredients, along with the preparation methods, play a major part in the consistency, texture, and flavor of the end product.\n\nSugars contribute moisture and tenderness to baked goods. Flour or starch components serves as a protein and gives the dessert structure. Fats contribute moisture and can enable the development of flaky layers in pastries and pie crusts.  The dairy products in baked goods keep the desserts moist. Many desserts also contain eggs, in order to form custard or to aid in the rising and thickening of a cake-like substance. Egg yolks specifically contribute to the richness of desserts.  Egg whites can act as a leavening agent<ref name=\"Flour Facts\">{{cite web|title=Baking Flour Facts|url=http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/tools-and-techniques/baking-flour-facts.htm|work=TLC|publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> or provide structure.  Further innovation in the healthy eating movement has led to more information being available about vegan and gluten-free substitutes for the standard ingredients, as well as replacements for refined sugar. \n\nDesserts can contain many spices and extracts to add a variety of flavors.

[[Pudding]]s are thickened with starches such as [[cornstarch]] or [[tapioca pudding|tapioca]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Carole|title=The essential baker : the comprehensive guide to baking with fruits, nuts, spices, chocolate, and other ingredients|date=2006|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-7645-7645-4|pages=672|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cyR9VsqMvJsC&pg=PA12}}</ref>  Custards and puddings are often used as ingredients in other desserts, for instance as a filling for pastries or pies.\n\n=== Deep-fried desserts ===\n{{See also|List of doughnut varieties}}\nMany cuisines include a dessert made of deep-fried starch-based batter or dough.  In many countries a [[doughnut]] is a flour-based batter that has been deep-fried. It is sometimes filled with custard or jelly. [[Fritter]]s are fruit pieces in a thick batter that have been deep fried. [[Gulab jamun]] is an Indian dessert made of milk solids kneaded into a dough, deep-fried, and soaked in honey. [[Churro]]s are a deep-fried and sugared dough that is eaten as dessert or a snack in many countries. Doughnuts are most famous for being a trademark favorite of fictional character [[Homer Simpson]] from the [[List of American animated television series|animated]] television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cnet.com/google-amp/news/national-donut-day-why-homer-simpsons-pink-treat-is-the-sweet-ring-to-rule-them-all/|title=Why Homer Simpson's pink doughnut is the ring to rule them all - CNET|publisher=|accessdate=7 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Frozen desserts ===\n[[File:Strawbeerry kulfi.JPG|thumb|[[Kulfi]], a type of ice cream]]\n{{Main article|Ice cream|Gelato|Sorbet|Shave ice}}\nIce cream, gelato, sorbet and shaved-ice desserts fit into this category.  Ice cream is a cream base that is churned as it is frozen to create a creamy consistency.  Gelato uses a milk base and has less air whipped in than ice cream, making it denser. Sorbet is made from churned fruit and is not dairy based. Shaved-ice desserts are made by shaving a block of ice and adding flavored syrup or juice to the ice shavings.\n\n=== Jellied desserts ===\n{{See also|Gelatin desserts}}\nJellied desserts are made with a sweetened liquid thickened with gelatin or another thickening agent.  They are traditional in many cultures. [[Grass jelly]] and [[annin tofu]] are Chinese jellied desserts. [[Y\u014dkan]] is a Japanese jellied dessert.  In English-speaking countries, many dessert recipes are [[gelatin dessert|based on gelatin]] with fruit or whipped cream added.\n\n=== Pastries ===\n[[File:Croissants au beurre (18953292873).jpg|thumb|upright|Croissants au beurre]]\n{{Main article|Pastry}} Pastries are sweet baked pastry products. Pastries can either take the form of light and flaky bread with an airy texture, such as a [[croissant]] or unleavened dough with a high fat content and crispy texture, such as [[shortbread]].  Pastries are often flavored or filled with fruits, chocolate, nuts, and spices. Pastries are sometimes eaten with tea or coffee as a breakfast food.\n\n=== Pies, cobblers, and clafoutis ===\n{{Main article|Pie|Cobbler (food)|Clafouti}}\nPies and cobblers are a crust with a filling.  The crust can be either made from either a pastry or crumbs.  Pie fillings range from fruits to puddings; cobbler fillings are generally fruit-based.  Clafoutis are a batter with fruit-based filling poured over the top before baking.\n\n=== Sweet soups ===\n[[File:Eggtongsui.jpg|thumb|[[Egg tong sui]]]]\n{{Main article|Tong sui}}\nTong sui, literally translated as \"sugar water\" and also known as tim tong, is a collective term for any sweet, warm [[soup]] or [[custard]] served as a dessert at the end of a meal in [[Cantonese cuisine]]. ''Tong sui'' are a Cantonese specialty and are rarely found in other [[Chinese cuisine|regional cuisines of China]].  Outside of Cantonese-speaking communities, soupy desserts generally are not recognized as a distinct category, and the term ''tong sui'' is not used.\n\n=== Dessert wines ===\n[[Dessert wine]]s are sweet [[wine]]s typically served with dessert. There is no simple definition of a dessert wine. In the UK, a dessert wine is considered to be any sweet wine drunk with a meal, as opposed to the white<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchscout.com/types-of-white-wines|title=The 7 major types of white wines - French Scout|first=F\u00e9licien|last=Breton|publisher=}}</ref> [[fortified wines]] (fino and amontillado sherry) drunk before the meal, and the red fortified wines ([[port wine|port]] and [[Madeira wine|madeira]]) drunk after it. Thus, most fortified wines are regarded as distinct from dessert wines, but some of the less strong fortified white wines, such as [[Pedro Xim\u00e9nez]] sherry and [[Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise AOC|Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise]], are regarded as honorary dessert wines. In the United States, by contrast, a dessert wine is legally defined as any wine over 14% [[alcohol by volume]], which includes all fortified wines - and is taxed at higher rates as a result. Examples include [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]] and [[Tokaji|Tokaji Asz\u00fa]].\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Dessert examples\">\nFile:Baked Alaska (5097717743).jpg|[[Baked Alaska]], ice cream and cake topped with browned meringue\nFile:Baklava - Turkish special, 80-ply.JPEG|[[Baklava]], a pastry comprising layers of filo with chopped nuts, sweetened and held together with syrup or honey\nFile:Brennan's Bananas Foster.jpg|[[Bananas Foster]], made from bananas and vanilla ice cream with a sauce made from butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, dark rum and banana liqueur\nFile:Plain cheesecake.jpg|[[Cheesecake]], a type of dessert with a layer of a mixture of soft, fresh cheese, eggs and sugar\nFile:Cannoli siciliani (7472226896).jpg|[[Cannoli|Cannolis]] with Pistachio Grain, Candied  and Chocolate Drops\nFile:Chocolate mousse.jpg|[[Chocolate mousse]], a chocolate variety of a dessert incorporating air bubbles to give it a light and airy texture\nFile:Coconutbar.jpg|[[Coconut bar]], made with coconut milk and set with either [[Wheat starch|tang flour]] and corn starch, or [[agar agar]] and gelatin\nFile:Creme brulee.jpg|Preparation of [[cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e]], a rich custard base topped with a contrasting layer of hard caramel\nFile:Egg custard tart by Stu Spivack.jpg|[[Custard tart|Egg custard tarts]], a pastry originating from Guangzhou, China.\nFile:Hwangnam bread (cropped).JPG|[[Gyeongju bread]], a small pastry with a filling of [[red bean paste]]\nFile:\uc528\uc557\ud638\ub5a1.jpg|[[Hotteok]] (a variety of filled Korean pancake) with edible seeds, sugar, and cinnamon\nFile:Kkultarae, Korean court cake.jpg|[[Kkultarae]], fine strands of [[honey]] and [[maltose]], often with a sweet [[nut (fruit)|nut]] filling\nFile:Jell-o cream cheese square.jpg|Jell-o cream cheese square\nFile:Besan laddu photo.JPG|[[Gulab jamun]] decorated with silver foil and almond chips.\nFile:Lemon tart (cropped).jpg|[[Lemon tart]], a pastry shell with a lemon-flavored filling\nFile:Pastry assortment.jpg|An assortment of [[pastries]]\nFile:Rum cake.jpg|[[Rum cake]], a type of cake containing rum\nFile:King of Spotted Dicks.jpg|[[Spotted Dick]]\nFile:Tiramisu with blueberries and raspberries, July 2011.jpg|[[Tiramisu]]\nFile:Banana pudding, homemade.jpg|Homemade banana [[pudding]]\n</gallery>\n\n== By continent ==\n{{expand section|date=July 2015}}[[File:GrassJellyBlocks.jpg|thumb|[[Grass jelly]] is a [[Gelatin|jelly-like]] dessert eaten in several Asian countries.]]\n=== Africa ===\nThroughout much of central and western Africa, there is no tradition of a dessert course following a meal.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Ellen Gibson|title=A West African cook book|date=1971|publisher=M.

As of 2008, the best analytical attack is [[linear cryptanalysis]], which requires 2<sup>43</sup> [[known plaintext]]s and has a time complexity of 2<sup>39\u201343</sup> (Junod, 2001).}}\n\nThe '''Data Encryption Standard''' ('''DES''' {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|d|i\u02d0|\u02cc|i\u02d0|\u02c8|\u025b|s|,_|d|\u025b|z}}) is a [[symmetric-key algorithm]] for the [[encryption]] of electronic data. Although insecure, it was highly influential in the advancement of modern [[cryptography]].\n\nDeveloped in the early 1970s at [[IBM]] and based on an earlier design by [[Horst Feistel]], the algorithm was submitted to the [[National Bureau of Standards]] (NBS) following the agency's invitation to propose a candidate for the protection of sensitive, unclassified electronic government data. In 1976, after consultation with the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), the NBS eventually selected a slightly modified version (strengthened against [[differential cryptanalysis]], but weakened against [[brute-force attack]]s), which was published as an official [[Federal Information Processing Standard]] (FIPS) for the United States in 1977.\n\nThe publication of an NSA-approved encryption standard simultaneously resulted in its quick international adoption and widespread academic scrutiny. Controversies arose out of [[classified information|classified]] design elements, a relatively short [[key length]] of the [[symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric-key]] [[block cipher]] design, and the involvement of the NSA, nourishing suspicions about a [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor]].  Today it is known that the [[S-box]]es that had raised those suspicions were in fact designed by the NSA to actually remove a backdoor they secretly knew (differential cryptanalysis). However, the NSA also ensured that the key size was drastically reduced such that they could break it by brute force attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/10/the_legacy_of_d.html |website=www.schneier.com |date=October 6, 2004 |title=The Legacy of DES - Schneier on Security}}</ref> The intense academic scrutiny the algorithm received over time led to the modern understanding of block ciphers and their [[cryptanalysis]].\n\nDES, as stated above, is insecure. This is mainly due to the [[56-bit encryption|56-bit key size]] being too small. In January 1999, [[distributed.net]] and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes (see [[Data Encryption Standard#Chronology|chronology]]). There are also some analytical results which demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher, although they are infeasible to mount in practice. The algorithm is believed to be practically secure in the form of [[Triple DES]], although there are theoretical attacks. This cipher has been superseded by the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES). Furthermore, DES has been withdrawn as a standard by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].\n\nSome documentation makes a distinction between DES as a standard and as an algorithm, referring to the algorithm as the '''DEA''' ('''Data Encryption Algorithm''').\n\n== History of DES ==\nThe origins of DES go back to the early 1970s. In 1972, after concluding a study on the US government's [[computer security]] needs, the US standards body NBS (National Bureau of Standards)\u2014now named [[NIST]] (National Institute of Standards and Technology)\u2014identified a need for a government-wide standard for encrypting unclassified, sensitive information.<ref>It was created by IBM's (International Business Machines) {{cite conference|author=Walter Tuchman|title=A brief history of the data encryption standard|booktitle=Internet besieged: countering cyberspace scofflaws|publisher=\nACM Press/Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. New York, NY, USA|pages=275\u2013280|year=1997}}</ref> Accordingly, on 15 May 1973, after consulting with the NSA, NBS solicited proposals for a cipher that would meet rigorous design criteria. None of the submissions, however, turned out to be suitable. A second request was issued on 27 August 1974. This time, [[International Business Machines|IBM]] submitted a candidate which was deemed acceptable\u2014a cipher developed during the period 1973\u20131974 based on an earlier algorithm, [[Horst Feistel]]'s [[Lucifer (cipher)|Lucifer]] cipher. The team at IBM involved in cipher design and analysis included Feistel, [[Walter Tuchman]], [[Don Coppersmith]], Alan Konheim, Carl Meyer, Mike Matyas, [[Roy Adler]], [[Edna Grossman]], Bill Notz, Lynn Smith, and [[Bryant Tuckerman]].\n\n=== NSA's involvement in the design ===\nOn 17 March 1975, the proposed DES was published in the ''[[Federal Register]]''.

The S-boxes of DES were much more resistant to the attack than if they had been chosen at random, strongly suggesting that IBM knew about the technique in the 1970s. This was indeed the case; in 1994, Don Coppersmith published some of the original design criteria for the S-boxes.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Konheim|title=Computer Security and Cryptography|page=301}}</ref> According to [[Steven Levy]], IBM Watson researchers discovered differential cryptanalytic attacks in 1974 and were asked by the NSA to keep the technique secret.<ref name=Levy>Levy, ''Crypto'', p. 55</ref> Coppersmith explains IBM's secrecy decision by saying, \"that was because [differential cryptanalysis] can be a very powerful tool, used against many schemes, and there was concern that such information in the public domain could adversely affect national security.\" Levy quotes Walter Tuchman: \"[t]hey asked us to stamp all our documents confidential... We actually put a number on each one and locked them up in safes, because they were considered U.S. government classified. They said do it.

It was subsequently reaffirmed as the standard in 1983, 1988 (revised as FIPS-46-1), 1993 (FIPS-46-2), and again in 1999 (FIPS-46-3), the latter prescribing \"[[Triple DES]]\" (see below). On 26 May 2002, DES was finally superseded by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), following [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|a public competition]]. On 19 May 2005, FIPS 46-3 was officially withdrawn, but [[NIST]] has approved [[Triple DES]] through the year 2030 for sensitive government information.<ref name=SP800-67>[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-67-Rev1/SP-800-67-Rev1.pdf NIST Special Publication 800-67 ''Recommendation for the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) Block Cipher'', Version 1.1]</ref>\n\nThe algorithm is also specified in [[ANSI]] X3.92 (Today X3 is known as [[INCITS]] and ANSI X3.92 as ANSI [[INCITS]] 92),<ref>[[American National Standards Institute]], ANSI X3.92-1981 (now known as ANSI [[INCITS]] 92-1981)''American National Standard, Data Encryption Algorithm''</ref> NIST SP 800-67<ref name=SP800-67/> and ISO/IEC 18033-3<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=54531 |title=ISO/IEC 18033-3:2010 Information technology\u2014Security techniques\u2014Encryption algorithms\u2014Part 3: Block ciphers |publisher=Iso.org |date=2010-12-14 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref> (as a component of [[TDEA]]).\n\nAnother theoretical attack, linear cryptanalysis, was published in 1994, but it was the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]'s [[EFF DES cracker|DES cracker]] in 1998 that demonstrated that DES could be attacked very practically, and highlighted the need for a replacement algorithm. These and other methods of [[cryptanalysis]] are discussed in more detail later in this article.\n\nThe introduction of DES is considered to have been a catalyst for the academic study of cryptography, particularly of methods to crack block ciphers. According to a NIST retrospective about DES,\n:The DES can be said to have \"jump-started\" the nonmilitary study and development of encryption algorithms. In the 1970s there were very few cryptographers, except for those in military or intelligence organizations, and little academic study of cryptography. There are now many active academic cryptologists, mathematics departments with strong programs in cryptography, and commercial information security companies and consultants. A generation of cryptanalysts has cut its teeth analyzing (that is, trying to \"crack\") the DES algorithm. In the words of cryptographer [[Bruce Schneier]],<ref>Bruce Schneier, Applied Cryptography, Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C, Second edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York (1996) p. 267</ref> \"DES did more to galvanize the field of cryptanalysis than anything else. Now there was an algorithm to study.\" An astonishing share of the open literature in cryptography in the 1970s and 1980s dealt with the DES, and the DES is the standard against which every [[symmetric key algorithm]] since has been compared.<ref>William E.

In the case of DES, the [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] is 64 bits. DES also uses a [[key (cryptography)|key]] to customize the transformation, so that decryption can supposedly only be performed by those who know the particular key used to encrypt. The key ostensibly consists of 64 bits; however, only 56 of these are actually used by the algorithm. Eight bits are used solely for checking [[parity bit|parity]], and are thereafter discarded. Hence the effective [[key length]] is 56 bits.\n\nThe key is nominally stored or transmitted as 8 [[byte]]s, each with odd parity. According to ANSI X3.92-1981 (Now, known as ANSI [[INCITS]] 92-1981), section 3.5:\n\n{{quote|One bit in each 8-bit byte of the ''KEY'' may be utilized for error detection in key generation, distribution, and storage. Bits 8, 16,..., 64 are for use in ensuring that each byte is of odd parity.}}\n\nLike other block ciphers, DES by itself is not a secure means of encryption, but must instead be used in a [[block cipher mode of operation|mode of operation]]. FIPS-81 specifies several modes for use with DES.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips81/fips81.htm |title=FIPS 81 - Des Modes of Operation |publisher=csrc.nist.gov |accessdate=2009-06-02}}</ref> Further comments on the usage of DES are contained in FIPS-74.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip74.htm |title=FIPS 74 - Guidelines for Implementing and Using the NBS Data |publisher=Itl.nist.gov |accessdate=2009-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103013152/http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip74.htm |archive-date=2014-01-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nDecryption uses the same structure as encryption, but with the keys used in reverse order. (This has the advantage that the same hardware or software can be used in both directions.)\n\n=== Overall structure ===\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2009}}\nThe algorithm's overall structure is shown in Figure 1: there are 16 identical stages of processing, termed ''rounds''. There is also an initial and final [[permutation]], termed ''IP'' and ''FP'', which are [[inverse function|inverses]] (IP \"undoes\" the action of FP, and vice versa). IP and FP have no cryptographic significance, but were included in order to facilitate loading blocks in and out of mid-1970s 8-bit based hardware.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schneier|title=Applied Cryptography|edition=1st|page=271}}</ref>\n\nBefore the main rounds, the block is divided into two 32-bit halves and processed alternately; this criss-crossing is known as the [[Feistel scheme]]. The Feistel structure ensures that decryption and encryption are very similar processes\u2014the only difference is that the subkeys are applied in the reverse order when decrypting. The rest of the algorithm is identical. This greatly simplifies implementation, particularly in hardware, as there is no need for separate encryption and decryption algorithms.\n\nThe \u2295 symbol denotes the [[XOR|\nexclusive-OR]] (XOR) operation. The ''F-function'' scrambles half a block together with some of the key. The output from the F-function is then combined with the other half of the block, and the halves are swapped before the next round. After the final round, the halves are swapped; this is a feature of the Feistel structure which makes encryption and decryption similar processes.\n\n=== The Feistel (F) function ===\nThe F-function, depicted in Figure 2, operates on half a block (32 bits) at a time and consists of four stages:\n<imagemap>\nFile:Data_Encription_Standard_Flow_Diagram.svg|thumb|250px|''[[:File:DES-f-function.png|Figure 2]]''\u2014The Feistel function (F-function) of DES\nrect 10 88 322 170 [[DES supplementary material#Expansion function (E)|Expansion function]]\nrect 9 340 77 395 [[DES supplementary material#Substitution boxes (S-boxes)|Substitution box 1]]\nrect 89 340 157 395 [[DES supplementary material#Substitution boxes (S-boxes)|Substitution box 2]]\nrect 169 340 237 395 [[DES supplementary material#Substitution boxes (S-boxes)|Substitution box 3]]\nrect 247 340 315 395 [[DES supplementary material#Substitution boxes (S-boxes)|Substitution box 4]]\nrect 327 340 395 395 [[DES supplementary material#Substitution boxes (S-boxes)|Substitution box 5]]\nrect 405 340 473 395 [[DES supplementary material#Substitution boxes (S-boxes)|Substitution box 6]]\nrect 485 340 553 395 [[DES supplementary material#Substitution boxes (S-boxes)|Substitution box 7]]\nrect 565 340 633 395 [[DES supplementary material#Substitution boxes (S-boxes)|Substitution box 8]]\nrect 9 482 630 565 [[DES supplementary material#Permutation (P)|Permutation]]\ncircle 319 232 21 [[Exclusive or|XOR]]\n</imagemap>\n# ''Expansion'': the 32-bit half-block is expanded to 48 bits using the ''expansion permutation'', denoted ''E'' in the diagram, by duplicating half of the bits. The output consists of eight 6-bit (8 * 6 = 48 bits) pieces, each containing a copy of 4 corresponding input bits, plus a copy of the immediately adjacent bit from each of the input pieces to either side.\n# ''Key mixing'': the result is combined with a ''subkey'' using an XOR operation. Sixteen 48-bit subkeys\u2014one for each round\u2014are derived from the main key using the ''[[key schedule]]'' (described below).\n# ''Substitution'': after mixing in the subkey, the block is divided into eight 6-bit pieces before processing by the ''[[Substitution box|S-boxes]]'', or ''substitution boxes''. Each of the eight S-boxes replaces its six input bits with four output bits according to a non-linear transformation, provided in the form of a [[lookup table]]. The S-boxes provide the core of the security of DES\u2014without them, the cipher would be linear, and trivially breakable.\n# ''Permutation'': finally, the 32 outputs from the S-boxes are rearranged according to a fixed [[permutation]], the ''P-box''. This is designed so that, after permutation, the bits from the output of each S-box in this round are spread across four different S-boxes in the next round.\n\nThe alternation of substitution from the S-boxes, and permutation of bits from the P-box and E-expansion provides so-called \"[[confusion and diffusion]]\" respectively, a concept identified by [[Claude Shannon]] in the 1940s as a necessary condition for a secure yet practical cipher.\n\n=== Key schedule ===\n<imagemap>\nFile:DES-key-schedule.png|thumb|250px|''[[:File:DES-key-schedule.png|Figure 3]]''\u2014 The key-schedule of DES\nrect 96 28 298 58 [[DES supplementary material#Permuted choice 1 (PC-1)|Permuted choice 1]]\nrect 127 122 268 155 [[DES supplementary material#Permuted choice 2 (PC-2)|Permuted choice 2]]\nrect 127 216 268 249 [[DES supplementary material#Permuted choice 2 (PC-2)|Permuted choice 2]]\nrect 127 357 268 390 [[DES supplementary material#Permuted choice 2 (PC-2)|Permuted choice 2]]\nrect 127 451 268 484 [[DES supplementary material#Permuted choice 2 (PC-2)|Permuted choice 2]]\nrect 96 91 127 116 [[DES supplementary material#Rotations in the key-schedule|Left shift by 1]]\nrect 268 91 299 116 [[DES supplementary material#Rotations in the key-schedule|Left shift by 1]]\nrect 96 185 127 210 [[DES supplementary material#Rotations in the key-schedule|Left shift by 1]]\nrect 268 185 299 210 [[DES supplementary material#Rotations in the key-schedule|Left shift by 1]]\nrect 96 326 127 351 [[DES supplementary material#Rotations in the key-schedule|Left shift by 2]]\nrect 268 326 299 351 [[DES supplementary material#Rotations in the key-schedule|Left shift by 2]]\nrect 96 419 127 444 [[DES supplementary material#Rotations in the key-schedule|Left shift by 1]]\nrect 268 419 299 444 [[DES supplementary material#Rotations in the key-schedule|Left shift by 1]]\n</imagemap>\nFigure 3 illustrates the ''key schedule'' for encryption\u2014the algorithm which generates the subkeys. Initially, 56 bits of the key are selected from the initial 64 by ''Permuted Choice 1'' (''PC-1'')\u2014the remaining eight bits are either discarded or used as [[parity bit|parity]] check bits. The 56 bits are then divided into two 28-bit halves; each half is thereafter treated separately. In successive rounds, both halves are rotated left by one or two bits (specified for each round), and then 48 subkey bits are selected by ''Permuted Choice 2'' (''PC-2'')\u201424 bits from the left half, and 24 from the right. The rotations (denoted by \"<<<\" in the diagram) mean that a different set of bits is used in each subkey; each bit is used in approximately 14 out of the 16 subkeys.\n\nThe key schedule for decryption is similar\u2014the subkeys are in reverse order compared to encryption. Apart from that change, the process is the same as for encryption. The same 28 bits are passed to all rotation boxes.\n\n== Security and cryptanalysis ==\nAlthough more information has been published on the cryptanalysis of DES than any other block cipher, the most practical attack to date is still a brute-force approach. Various minor cryptanalytic properties are known, and three theoretical attacks are possible which, while having a theoretical complexity less than a brute-force attack, require an unrealistic number of [[known plaintext|known]] or [[chosen plaintext]]s to carry out, and are not a concern in practice.\n\n=== Brute-force attack ===\nFor any cipher, the most basic method of attack is [[brute-force attack|brute force]]\u2014trying every possible key in turn. The [[key length|length of the key]] determines the number of possible keys, and hence the feasibility of this approach. For DES, questions were raised about the adequacy of its key size early on, even before it was adopted as a standard, and it was the small key size, rather than theoretical cryptanalysis, which dictated a need for a replacement algorithm. As a result of discussions involving external consultants including the NSA, the key size was reduced from 128 bits to 56 bits to fit on a single chip.<ref name=\"stallings-2006\">Stallings, W.

In 1977, Diffie and Hellman proposed a machine costing an estimated US$20 million which could find a DES key in a single day.<ref name=\"dh-exh\"/><ref>http://hamburgsteak.sandwich.net/writ/bruting_des.html</ref> By 1993, Wiener had proposed a key-search machine costing US$1 million which would find a key within 7 hours. However, none of these early proposals were ever implemented\u2014or, at least, no implementations were publicly acknowledged. The vulnerability of DES was practically demonstrated in the late 1990s. In 1997, [[RSA Security]] sponsored a series of contests, offering a $10,000 prize to the first team that broke a message encrypted with DES for the contest. That contest was won by the [[DESCHALL Project]], led by Rocke Verser, [[Matt Curtin]], and Justin Dolske, using idle cycles of thousands of computers across the Internet. The feasibility of cracking DES quickly was demonstrated in 1998 when a custom DES-cracker was built by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), a cyberspace civil rights group, at the cost of approximately US$250,000 (see [[EFF DES cracker]]). Their motivation was to show that DES was breakable in practice as well as in theory: \"''There are many people who will not believe a truth until they can see it with their own eyes. Showing them a physical machine that can crack DES in a few days is the only way to convince some people that they really cannot trust their security to DES.''\" The machine brute-forced a key in a little more than 2 days' worth of searching.\n\nThe next confirmed DES cracker was the COPACOBANA machine built in 2006 by teams of the [[Ruhr University|Universities of Bochum]] and [[University of Kiel|Kiel]], both in [[Germany]]. Unlike the EFF machine, COPACOBANA consists of commercially available, reconfigurable integrated circuits. 120 of these [[field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs) of type XILINX Spartan-3 1000 run in parallel. They are grouped in 20 DIMM modules, each containing 6 FPGAs. The use of reconfigurable hardware makes the machine applicable to other code breaking tasks as well.<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Getting Started, COPACOBANA \u2014 Cost-optimized Parallel Code-Breaker\n | url = http://www.copacobana.org/paper/copacobana_gettingstarted.pdf\n | date = December 12, 2006\n | accessdate = March 6, 2012\n}}</ref>  One of the more interesting aspects of COPACOBANA is its cost factor. One machine can be built for approximately $10,000.<ref>{{cite book\n | author = Reinhard Wobst\n | title = Cryptology Unlocked\n | date = October 16, 2007\n | publisher = John Wiley & Sons\n}}</ref> The cost decrease by roughly a factor of 25 over the EFF machine is an example of the continuous improvement of [[digital hardware]]\u2014see [[Moore's law]]. Adjusting for inflation over 8 years yields an even higher improvement of about 30x. Since 2007, [[SciEngines GmbH]], a spin-off company of the two project partners of COPACOBANA has enhanced and developed successors of COPACOBANA. In 2008 their COPACOBANA RIVYERA reduced the time to break DES to less than one day, using 128 Spartan-3 5000's. SciEngines RIVYERA held the record in brute-force breaking DES, having utilized 128 Spartan-3 5000 FPGAs.<ref>[http://www.sciengines.com/company/news-a-events/74-des-in-1-day.html Break DES in less than a single day] [Press release of Firm, demonstrated on 2009 Workshop]</ref> Their 256 Spartan-6 LX150 model has further lowered this time.\n\nIn 2012, David Hutton and Moxie Marlinspike announced a system with 48 Xilinx Virtex-6 LX240T FPGAs, each FPGA containing 40 fully pipelined DES cores running at 400&nbsp;MHz, for a total capacity of  768 gigakeys/sec.

Most of these designs kept the 64-bit [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] of DES, and could act as a \"drop-in\" replacement, although they typically used a 64-bit or 128-bit key. In the [[Soviet Union]] the [[GOST 28147-89]] algorithm was introduced, with a 64-bit block size and a 256-bit key, which was also used in [[Russia]] later.\n\nDES itself can be adapted and reused in a more secure scheme. Many former DES users now use [[Triple DES]] (TDES) which was described and analysed by one of DES's patentees (see [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] Pub 46-3); it involves applying DES three times with two (2TDES) or three (3TDES) different keys. TDES is regarded as adequately secure, although it is quite slow. A less computationally expensive alternative is [[DES-X]], which increases the key size by XORing extra key material before and after DES. [[GDES]] was a DES variant proposed as a way to speed up encryption, but it was shown to be susceptible to differential cryptanalysis.\n\nOn January 2, 1997, NIST announced that they wished to choose a successor to DES.<ref>http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/pre-round1/aes_9701.txt</ref> In 2001, after an international competition, NIST selected a new cipher, the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES), as a replacement.<ref>http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf November 26, 2001.</ref> The algorithm which was selected as the AES was submitted by its designers under the name [[Rijndael]]. Other finalists in the NIST [[AES competition]] included [[RC6]], [[Serpent (cipher)|Serpent]], [[MARS (cryptography)|MARS]], and [[Twofish]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Cryptography}}\n* ''[[Brute Force: Cracking the Data Encryption Standard]]''\n* [[DES supplementary material]]\n* [[Skipjack (cipher)]]\n* [[Triple DES]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Cite journal| author=[[Eli Biham|Biham, Eli]] and [[Adi Shamir|Shamir, Adi]] |title=Differential Cryptanalysis of DES-like Cryptosystems |journal=[[Journal of Cryptology]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |year=1991 |pages=3\u201372 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k54h077np8714058/ |doi=10.1007/BF00630563}} ([http://nfotemple.free.fr/site_cryptokg/site_roy/differential%20cryptanalysis%20of%20des-like%20cryptosystems.pdf preprint])\n*[[Eli Biham|Biham, Eli]] and [[Adi Shamir|Shamir, Adi]], Differential Cryptanalysis of the Data Encryption Standard, Springer Verlag, 1993. {{ISBN|0-387-97930-1}}, {{ISBN|3-540-97930-1}}.\n*[[Eli Biham|Biham, Eli]] and [[Alex Biryukov]]: An Improvement of Davies' Attack on DES.

In addition to their basic function of satisfying [[thirst]], drinks play important roles in human [[culture]]. Common types of drinks include plain [[drinking water]], [[milk]], [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[hot chocolate]] and [[soft drink]]s. In addition, [[alcoholic drink]]s such as [[wine]], [[beer]], and [[liquor]], which contain the drug [[ethanol]], have been part of human culture result and development for more than 8,000 years.\n\nNon-alcoholic drinks often signify drinks that would normally contain alcohol, such as [[beer]] and [[wine]], but are made with less than .5 percent alcohol by volume. The category includes drinks that have undergone an alcohol removal process such as non-alcoholic beers and de-alcoholized wines.\n\n== Biology ==\nWhen the human body becomes dehydrated, it experiences [[thirst]]. This craving of fluids results in an instinctive need to drink. Thirst is regulated by the [[hypothalamus]] in response to subtle changes in the body's [[electrolyte]] levels, and also as a result of changes in the volume of blood circulating.

Citrus products such as [[orange juice]] and [[tangerine]] juice are familiar breakfast drinks, while [[grapefruit juice]], pineapple, apple, grape, lime, and lemon juice are also common. [[Coconut water]] is a highly nutritious and refreshing juice. Many kinds of berries are crushed; their juices are mixed with water and sometimes sweetened. Raspberry, blackberry and currants are popular juices drinks but the percentage of water also determines their nutritive value. Grape juice allowed to ferment produces [[wine]].\n\nFruits are highly perishable so the ability to extract juices and store them was of significant value. Some fruits are highly acidic and mixing them with water and sugars or honey was often necessary to make them palatable. Early storage of fruit juices was labor-intensive, requiring the crushing of the fruits and the mixing of the resulting pure juices with sugars before bottling.\n\nVegetable juices are usually served warm or cold. Different types of vegetables can be used to make vegetable juice such as [[carrot]]s, tomatoes, [[cucumber]]s, [[celery]] and many more. Some vegetable juices are mixed with some fruit juice to make the vegetable juice taste better. Many popular vegetable juices, particularly ones with high tomato content, are high in sodium, and therefore consumption of them for health must be carefully considered. Some vegetable juices provide the same health benefits as whole vegetables in terms of reducing risks of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[cancer]].\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This includes caf\u00e9s and [[coffeehouse]]s, focus on providing hot drinks as well as light snacks. Many coffee houses in the [[Middle East]], and in [[West Asia]]n immigrant districts in the [[Western world]], offer ''shisha'' (''nargile'' in Turkish and Greek), flavored tobacco smoked through a [[hookah]]. [[coffeehouse#Espresso bars|Espresso bars]] are a type of coffeehouse that specialize in serving [[espresso]] and espresso-based drinks.\n\nIn China and Japan, the establishment would be a [[tea house]], were people would socialise whilst drinking tea. Chinese scholars have used the teahouse for places of sharing ideas.\n\nAlcoholic drinks are served in [[drinking establishments]], which have different cultural connotations. For example, [[pub]]s are fundamental to the culture of [[British culture|Britain]],<ref name=\"EB\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482410/public-house Public House] Britannica.com; Subscription Required.

In many places, especially in villages, a pub can be the focal point of the community. The writings of [[Samuel Pepys]] describe the pub as the heart of England. Many pubs are controlled by breweries, so [[cask ale]] or [[keg beer]] may be a better value than wines and spirits.\n\nIn contrast, types of bars range from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed \"dive bars\",<ref>Todd Dayton, {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LpUSVjBPHRwC&pg=PT7&dq=the+ideal+dive&hl=en&ei=HcZITNrrE4HNjAeu5IDDDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=the%20ideal%20dive&f=false |title=''San Francisco's Best Dive Bars'', page 4 |publisher=Ig Publishing, 2009, {{ISBN|0-9703125-8-X}} |accessdate=2010-07-22 }}</ref> to elegant places of entertainment for the elite. Bars provide [[Bar stool|stools]] or chairs that are placed at tables or counters for their patrons. The term \"bar\" is derived from the [[bar (counter)|specialized counter]] on which drinks are served. Some bars have entertainment on a stage, such as a live band, comedians, [[Go-Go dancing|go-go dancers]], or [[striptease|strippers]]. Patrons may sit or stand at the bar and be served by the [[bartender]], or they may sit at tables and be served by cocktail servers.\n\n=== Matching with food ===\n{{Main|Wine and food matching}}\n[[File:Champagne flute and bottle.jpg|thumb|upright|Champagne flute and bottle]]\n[[Food]] and drink are often paired together to enhance the taste experience. This primarily happens with wine and a culture has grown up around the process. Weight, flavors and textures can either be contrasted or complemented.<ref name=\"Oldman pg 219-235\">M.

This is sometimes purely for presentations purposes, such as for cocktails. In other situations, the drinkware has practical application, such as coffee cups which are designed for insulation or [[snifter|brandy snifters]] which are designed to encourage evaporation but trap the aroma within the glass.\n\nMany glasses include a stem, which allows the drinker to hold the glass without affecting the temperature of the drink. In champagne glasses, the bowl is designed to retain champagne's signature [[carbonation]], by reducing the [[surface area]] at the opening of the bowl. Historically, champagne has been served in a [[champagne coupe]], the shape of which allowed carbonation to dissipate even more rapidly than from a standard [[wine glass]].\n\n== Commercial trade ==\n\n=== International exports and imports ===\n\nAn important export commodity, coffee was the top agricultural export for twelve countries in 2004,<ref>{{cite web |title=FAO Statistical Yearbook 2004 Vol. 1/1 Table C.10: Most important imports and exports of agricultural products (in value terms) (2004) |publisher=FAO Statistics Division |year=2006 |url=http://www.fao.org/statistics/yearbook/vol_1_1/pdf/c10.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625174054/http://www.fao.org/statistics/yearbook/vol_1_1/pdf/c10.pdf |archivedate=2008-06-25 |accessdate=September 13, 2007 |format=PDF}}</ref>\nand it was the world's seventh-largest legal agricultural export by value in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=FAOSTAT Core Trade Data (commodities/years) |publisher=FAO Statistics Division |year=2007 |url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/343/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=343| accessdate=October 24, 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014183239/http://faostat.fao.org/site/343/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=343| archivedate = October 14, 2007}} To retrieve export values: Select the \"commodities/years\" tab.

Dill is widely grown in Eurasia where its leaves and seeds are used as a herb or spice for flavouring food.\n\n==Growth==\nDill grows up to {{convert|40|-|60|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, with slender hollow stems and alternate, finely divided, softly delicate [[leaf|leaves]] {{convert|10|-|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long. The ultimate leaf divisions are {{convert|1|-|2|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} broad, slightly broader than the similar leaves of [[fennel]], which are threadlike, less than {{convert|1|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} broad, but harder in texture. The [[flower]]s are white to yellow, in small [[umbel]]s {{convert|2|-|9|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} diameter. The [[seed]]s are {{convert|4|-|5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, and straight to slightly curved with a longitudinally ridged surface.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"dill\" and its close relatives are found in most of the Germanic languages; its ultimate origin is unknown.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1896, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/52792 ''s.v.''] (subscription)</ref> The generic name ''Anethum'' is the [[Latin language|Latin]] form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u1f04\u03bd\u1fd1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd / \u1f04\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd / \u1f04\u03bd\u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd / \u1f04\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, which meant both \"dill\" and \"[[anise]]\". The form ''an\u012bsum'' came to be used for anise, ''an\u0113thum'' for dill. The Latin word is the origin of dill's names in the [[Western Romance languages]] (''anet'', ''aneldo'', etc.), and also of the obsolete English ''anet''.<ref>[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/7811 ''s.v.''

Fresh, finely cut dill leaves are used as topping in soups, especially the hot red [[borsht]] and the cold borsht mixed with curds, kefir, yoghurt, or sour cream, which is served during hot summer weather and is called [[okroshka]]. It is also popular in summer to drink fermented milk (curds, kefir, yoghurt, or buttermilk) mixed with dill (and sometimes other herbs).\n\nIn the same way, prepared dill is used as a topping for boiled potatoes covered with fresh butter&nbsp;\u2013 especially in summer when there are so-called \"new\", or young, potatoes. The dill leaves can be mixed with butter, making a dill butter, which can serve the same purpose. Dill leaves mixed with [[tvorog]] form one of the traditional cheese spreads used for sandwiches. Fresh dill leaves are used all year round as an ingredient in salads, ''e.g.'', one made of lettuce, fresh cucumbers and tomatoes, the way [[basil]] leaves are used in Italy and Greece.\n\n[[Russian cuisine]] is noted for liberal use of dill.  Its supposed [[antiflatulent]] activity caused some Russian cosmonauts to recommend it for [[manned spaceflight]] due to the confined quarters and closed air supply.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kelly|first1=Scott|title=Endurance: A Year in Space, a Lifetime of Discovery|date=October 2017|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|isbn=1524731595}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Polish cuisine]], fresh dill leaves mixed with sour cream are the basis for dressings. It is especially popular to use this kind of sauce with freshly cut cucumbers, which practically are wholly immersed in the sauce, making a salad called \"mizeria\". The dill leaves serve as a basis for cooking dill sauce, used hot for baked freshwater fish and for chicken or turkey breast, or used hot or cold for hard-boiled eggs.  A dill-based soup (zupa koperkowa), served with potatoes and hard-boiled eggs, is also popular in Poland.  Whole stems including roots and flower buds are traditionally used to prepare Polish-style pickled cucumbers ([[og\u00f3rki kiszone]]), especially the so-called low-salt cucumbers (\"og\u00f3rki ma\u0142osolne\"). Whole stems of dill (often including the roots) are also cooked with potatoes, especially the potatoes of autumn and winter, so they resemble the flavor of the newer potatoes found in summer. Some kinds of fish, especially trout and salmon, are traditionally baked with the stems and leaves of dill.\n\nIn the [[Czech Republic]], white dill sauce made of cream (or milk), butter, flour, vinegar and dill is called ''koprov\u00e1 om\u00e1\u010dka'' (also ''koprovka'' or ''kopra\u010dka'') and is served either with boiled eggs and potatoes or with dumplings and boiled beef. Another Czech dish with dill is a soup called ''kulajda'' that contains mushrooms (traditionally wild ones).\n\nIn Germany, dill is popular as a seasoning for fish and many other dishes, chopped as a garnish on potatoes, and a flavoring in pickles.\n\nIn the UK, dill can be used in [[fish pie]]\n\nIn [[Bulgaria]] dill is widely used in traditional vegetable salads, and most notably the yogurt-based cold soup [[Tarator]]. It is also used in the preparation of sour pickles, cabbage and other dishees.\n\nIn [[Romania]] dill (''m\u0103rar'') is widely used as an ingredient for soups such as ''bor\u015f'' (pronounced \"borsh\"), pickles and other dishes, especially those based on peas, beans and cabbage. It is popular for dishes based on potatoes and mushrooms and can be found in many summer salads (especially cucumber salad, cabbage salad and lettuce salad). During springtime, it is used with spring onions in omelets. It often complements sauces based on sour cream or yogurt and is mixed with salted cheese and used as a filling. Another popular dish with dill as a main ingredient is dill sauce, which is served with eggs and fried sausages.\n\nIn [[Hungary]], dill is very widely used. It is popular as a sauce or filling, and mixed with a type of cottage cheese. Dill is also used for [[pickling]] and in salads. The Hungarian name for dill is ''kapor''.\n\nIn [[Serbia]], dill is known as ''mirodjija'' and is used as an addition to soups, potato and cucumber salads and French fries. It features in the Serbian proverb \"\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0452\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0443 \u0441\u0432\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0458 \u0447\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0438\" /biti mirodjija u svakoj \u010dorbi/ (to be a dill in every soup) which corresponds to the English proverb \"to have a finger in every pie\".\n\nIn [[Greece]], dill is known as '\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2' (anithos). In antiquity it was used as an add-in in wines, which they were called \"anithites oinos\" (wine with anithos-dill). In modern days, dill is used in salads, soups, sauces, and fish and vegetable dishes.\n\nIn [[Santa Maria Island (Azores)|Santa Maria]], [[Azores]], dill (''endro'') is the most important ingredient of the traditional Holy Ghost soup (''sopa do Esp\u00edrito Santo''). Dill is found practically everywhere in Santa Maria and is curiously rare in the other Azorean Islands.\n\nIn [[Sweden]], dill is a common spice or herb. The top of fully grown dill is called ''krondill'' (English: Crown dill); this is used when cooking [[crayfish]]. The ''krondill'' is put into the water after the crayfish is boiled, but still in hot and salt water. Then the entire dish is stored in refrigerator for at least 24 hours before eating (with toasted bread and butter). ''Krondill'' is also used for [[cucumber]] [[pickled cucumber|pickles]]. Small cucumbers, sliced or not, are put into a solution of hot water, mild acetic vinegar (not made from wine and without colour), sugar and ''krondill''. After a month or two, the cucumber pickles are ready to eat, for instance, with pork, brown sauce and potatoes, as a \"sweetener\". The thinner part of dill and young plants may be used with boiled fresh potatoes (as the first potatoes for the year, which usually are small and have a very thin skin). It is used together with, or instead of other green herbs, like [[parsley]], [[chives]] and [[basil]], in salads. It is also often paired up with chives when used in food. Dill is often used to flavour fish and seafood in Sweden, for example gravlax and various herring pickles, among them the traditional sill i dill (literally \"herring in dill\"). In contrast to the various fish dishes flavoured with dill, there is also a traditional Swedish dish called dillk\u00f6tt, which is a meaty stew flavoured with dill. The dish commonly contains either pieces of veal or lamb that are boiled until tender and then served together with a vinegary dill sauce. Dill seeds may be used in breads or [[akvavit]]. A newer, non-traditional use of dill is paired up with chives as a flavouring of potato chips. This flavour of potato chips called \"dillchips\" is quite popular in Sweden.\n\n===Asian and Middle Eastern cooking===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Country !! Language !! Name !!

It is also used in Iranian ''aash'' recipes, and is also called ''sheved'' in [[Persian Language|Persian]].\n\nIn [[India]], dill is known as \"Sholpa\" in Bengali, ''shepu'' (\u0936\u0947\u092a\u0942) in Marathi and Konkani, ''savaa'' in Hindi or ''soa'' in Punjabi. In Telugu, it is called ''Soa-kura'' (for herb greens).

In [[Tamil language|Tamil]] it is known as ''sada kuppi''(\u0b9a\u0ba4\u0b95\u0bc1\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bbf). In [[Malayalam]], it is \u0d1a\u0d24\u0d15\u0d41\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a (''chathakuppa'') or \u0d36\u0d24\u0d15\u0d41\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a (''sathakuppa''). In Sanskrit, this herb is called ''shatapushpa''. In Gujarati, it is known as ''suva''(\u0ab8\u0ac2\u0ab5\u0abe). In India, dill is prepared in the manner of yellow ''moong dal'' as a main-course dish. It is considered to have very good antigas properties, so it is used as ''mukhwas'', or an after-meal digestive. It is also traditionally given to mothers immediately after childbirth. In the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, a smaller amount of fresh dill is cooked along with cut potatoes and fresh fenugreek leaves (Hindi \u0906\u0932\u0942-\u092e\u0947\u0925\u0940-\u0938\u094b\u092f\u093e).\nIn [[Manipur]], dill, locally known as ''pakhon'', is an essential ingredient of ''chagem pomba'' \u2013 a traditional Manipuri dish made with fermented soybean and rice.

It is a common filling in [[baozi]] and [[bing (bread)|xianbing]] and can be used vegetarian, with rice vermicelli, or combined with either meat or eggs. Vegetarian dill baozi are a common part of a Beijing breakfast. In baozi and xianbing, it is often interchangeable with non-bulbing [[fennel]] and the term {{lang|zh|\u8334\u9999}} can also refer to fennel, like caraway and coriander leaf share a name in Chinese as well. Dill is also stir fried as a potherb, often with egg, in the same manner as [[Chinese chives]]. It is commonly used in [[Taiwan]] as well. In Northern China, [[Beijing]], [[Inner-Mongolia]], [[Ningxia]], [[Gansu]], [[Xinjiang]], dill seeds commonly called ''z\u012br\u00e1n'' ({{lang|zh|\u5b5c\u7136}}), but also ''k\u016bm\u00edng'' ({{lang|zh|\u67af\u8317}}), ''k\u016bm\u00edngzi'' ({{lang|zh|\u67af\u8317\u5b50}}), ''sh\u00edlu\u00f3zi'' ({{lang|zh|\u83b3\u841d\u5b50}}), ''xi\u01ceohu\u00edxi\u0101ngzi'' ({{lang|zh|\u5c0f\u8334\u9999\u5b50}})  are used with pepper for lamb meat.

When defined for a [[topological vector space]], there is a subspace of the dual space, corresponding to continuous linear functionals, called the ''continuous dual space''.\n\nDual vector spaces find application in many branches of mathematics that use vector spaces, such as in [[tensor]] analysis with finite-dimensional vector spaces. When applied to vector spaces of functions (which are typically infinite-dimensional), dual spaces are used to describe [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]], [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], and [[Hilbert space]]s. Consequently, the dual space is an important concept in [[functional analysis]].\n\n== Algebraic dual space ==\nGiven any [[vector space]] ''V'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'', the '''(algebraic) dual space''' ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup> (alternatively denoted by <math>V^\\vee</math> or <math>V'</math>)<ref>For <math>V^\\vee</math> used in this way, see p.&nbsp;19 of ''[https://archive.org/details/TuL.W.AnIntroductionToManifolds2e2010Springer An Introduction to Manifolds]'' (2nd edition, 2011, Springer) by Loring Tu.  This notation is sometimes used when <math>(\\cdot)^*</math> is reserved for some other meaning.  For instance, in the above text, <math>F^*</math> is frequently used to denote the codifferential of ''F'', so that <math>F^*\\omega</math> represents the pullback of the form \u03c9.\n\nHalmos's ''[https://archive.org/details/HalmosP.R.FiniteDimensionalVectorSpaces.SpringerVerlag205s_201703 Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces]'' (2nd edition, 1958, Van Nostrand) uses <math>V'</math> to denote the algebraic dual of ''V'' ; see p.&nbsp;20.  However, other authors use <math>V'</math> for the continuous dual, while reserving <math>V^*</math> for the algebraic dual.\n</ref> is defined as the set of all [[linear map]]s {{nowrap|''\u03c6'': ''V'' \u2192 ''F''}} ([[linear functional]]s).  Since linear maps are vector space [[homomorphism]]s, the dual space is also sometimes denoted by Hom(''V'', ''F'').  The dual space ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup> itself becomes a vector space over ''F'' when equipped with an addition and scalar multiplication satisfying:\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n  (\\varphi + \\psi)(x) &= \\varphi(x) + \\psi(x) \\\\\n       (a \\varphi)(x) &= a \\left(\\varphi(x)\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\nfor all ''\u03c6'' and {{nowrap|''\u03c8'' \u2208 ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup>}}, {{nowrap|''x'' \u2208 ''V''}}, and {{nowrap|''a'' \u2208 ''F''}}. Elements of the algebraic dual space ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup> are sometimes called '''covectors''' or '''[[one-form]]s'''.\n\nThe pairing of a functional ''\u03c6'' in the dual space ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup> and an element ''x'' of ''V'' is sometimes denoted by a bracket: {{nowrap|1=''\u03c6''(''x'') = [''x'',''\u03c6'']}} <ref>{{harvtxt|Halmos|1974}}</ref>\nor {{nowrap|1=''\u03c6''(''x'') = {{langle}}''\u03c6'',''x''{{rangle}}}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973}}</ref> This pairing defines a nondegenerate [[bilinear mapping]]<ref>In many areas, such as [[quantum mechanics]], {{nowrap|{{langle}}\u00b7,\u00b7{{rangle}}}} is reserved for a [[sesquilinear form]] defined on {{nowrap|''V'' \u00d7 ''V''}}.</ref> {{nowrap|{{langle}}\u00b7,\u00b7{{rangle}} : ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup> \u00d7 ''V'' \u2192 ''F''}} called the [[natural pairing]].\n\n=== Finite-dimensional case ===\n\nIf ''V'' is [[finite-dimensional]], then ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup> has the same dimension as ''V''. Given a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] {{nowrap|{'''e'''<sub>1</sub>, ..., '''e'''<sub>''n''</sub>} }} in ''V'', it is possible to construct a specific basis in ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup>, called the '''[[dual basis]]'''. This dual basis is a set {{nowrap|{'''e'''<sup>1</sup>, ..., '''e'''<sup>''n''</sup>} }} of linear functionals on ''V'', defined by the relation\n: <math> \\mathbf{e}^i(c^1 \\mathbf{e}_1+\\cdots+c^n\\mathbf{e}_n) = c^i, \\quad i=1,\\ldots,n </math>\nfor any choice of coefficients {{nowrap|''c<sup>i</sup>'' \u2208 ''F''}}. In particular, letting in turn each one of those coefficients be equal to one and the other coefficients zero, gives the system of equations\n: <math> \\mathbf{e}^i(\\mathbf{e}_j) = \\delta^{i}_{j} </math>\nwhere <math>\\delta^{i}_{j}</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]] symbol. For example, if ''V'' is '''R'''<sup>2</sup>, and its basis chosen to be {{nowrap|1={'''e'''<sub>1</sub> = (1, 0), '''e'''<sub>2</sub> = (0, 1)} }}, then '''e'''<sup>1</sup> and '''e'''<sup>2</sup> are [[one-form]]s (functions that map a vector to a scalar) such that {{nowrap|1='''e'''<sup>1</sup>('''e'''<sub>1</sub>) = 1}}, {{nowrap|1='''e'''<sup>1</sup>('''e'''<sub>2</sub>) = 0}}, {{nowrap|1='''e'''<sup>2</sup>('''e'''<sub>1</sub>) = 0}}, and {{nowrap|1='''e'''<sup>2</sup>('''e'''<sub>2</sub>) = 1}}. (Note: The superscript here is the index, not an exponent).\n\nIn particular, if we interpret '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> as the space of columns of ''n'' [[real number]]s, its dual space is typically written as the space of ''rows'' of ''n'' real numbers. Such a row acts on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> as a linear functional by ordinary [[matrix multiplication]]. One way to see this is that a functional maps every ''n''-vector ''x'' into a real number ''y''. Then, seeing this functional as a matrix ''M'', and ''x'', ''y'' as a {{nowrap|1=''n'' \u00d7 1}} matrix and a {{nowrap|1 \u00d7 1}} matrix (trivially, a real number) respectively, if we have {{nowrap|1=''Mx'' = ''y''}}, then, by dimension reasons, ''M'' must be a {{nowrap|1 \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix, i.e., ''M'' must be a row vector.\n\nIf ''V'' consists of the space of geometrical [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]s in the plane, then the level curves of an element of ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup> form a family of parallel lines in ''V'', because the range is 1-dimensional, so that every point in the range is a multiple of any one nonzero element. So an element of ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup> can be intuitively thought of as a particular family of parallel lines covering the plane. To compute the value of a functional on a given vector, one needs only to determine which of the lines the vector lies on. Or, informally, one \"counts\" how many lines the vector crosses. More generally, if ''V'' is a vector space of any dimension, then the level sets of a linear functional in ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup> are parallel hyperplanes in ''V'', and the action of a linear functional on a vector can be visualized in terms of these hyperplanes.<ref>{{harvtxt|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=\u00a72.5}}</ref>\n\n=== Infinite-dimensional case ===\nIf ''V'' is not finite-dimensional but has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]<ref name=\"choice\">Several assertions in this article require the [[axiom of choice]] for their justification. The axiom of choice is needed to show that an arbitrary vector space has a basis: in particular it is needed to show that '''R<sup>N</sup>''' has a basis.

The dual space of '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup> is (isomorphic to) '''R<sup>N</sup>''', the space of ''all'' sequences of real numbers: such a sequence (''a<sub>n</sub>'') is applied to an element (''x<sub>n</sub>'') of '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup> to give the number \u2211''a<sub>n</sub>x<sub>n</sub>'', which is a finite sum because there are only finitely many nonzero ''x<sub>n</sub>''. The [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]] of '''R'''<sup>\u221e</sup> is countably infinite, whereas '''R<sup>N</sup>''' does not have a countable basis.\n\nThis observation generalizes to any<ref name=\"choice\"/> infinite-dimensional vector space ''V'' over any field ''F'': a choice of basis {{nowrap|{'''e'''<sub>''\u03b1''</sub> : ''\u03b1'' \u2208 ''A''} }} identifies ''V'' with the space (''F<sup>A</sup>'')<sub>0</sub> of functions {{nowrap|''f'' : ''A \u2192 F''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''f<sub>\u03b1</sub>'' = ''f''(''\u03b1'')}} is nonzero for only finitely many {{nowrap|''\u03b1'' \u2208 ''A''}}, where such a function ''f'' is identified with the vector\n: <math>\n    \\sum_{\\alpha\\in A} f_\\alpha\\mathbf{e}_\\alpha\n  </math>\nin ''V'' (the sum is finite by the assumption on ''f'', and any {{nowrap|''v'' \u2208 ''V''}} may be written in this way by the definition of the basis).\n\nThe dual space of ''V'' may then be identified with the space ''F<sup>A</sup>'' of ''all'' functions from ''A'' to ''F'': a linear functional ''T'' on ''V'' is uniquely determined by the values {{nowrap|1=''\u03b8<sub>\u03b1</sub>'' = ''T''('''e'''<sub>''\u03b1''</sub>)}} it takes on the basis of ''V'', and any function {{nowrap|''\u03b8'' : ''A'' \u2192 ''F''}} (with {{nowrap|1=''\u03b8''(''\u03b1'') = ''\u03b8<sub>\u03b1</sub>''}}) defines a linear functional ''T'' on ''V'' by\n: <math>\n    T\\biggl(\\sum_{\\alpha\\in A} f_\\alpha \\mathbf{e}_\\alpha\\biggr) = \\sum_{\\alpha \\in A} f_\\alpha T(e_\\alpha) = \\sum_{\\alpha\\in A} f_\\alpha \\theta_\\alpha.\n  </math>\nAgain the sum is finite because ''f<sub>\u03b1</sub>'' is nonzero for only finitely many ''\u03b1''.\n\nNote that (''F<sup>A</sup>'')<sub>0</sub> may be identified (essentially by definition) with the [[Direct sum of modules|direct sum]]\nof infinitely many copies of ''F'' (viewed as a 1-dimensional vector space over itself) indexed by ''A'', i.e., there are linear isomorphisms\n: <math>\n    V\\cong (F^A)_0\\cong\\bigoplus_{\\alpha\\in A} {F}.\n  </math>\n\nOn the other hand, ''F<sup>A</sup>'' is (again by definition), the [[direct product]] of infinitely many copies of ''F'' indexed by ''A'', and so the identification\n: <math>\n    V^* \\cong\n    \\biggl(\\bigoplus_{\\alpha\\in A}F\\biggr)^* \\cong\n    \\prod_{\\alpha\\in A}F^* \\cong\n    \\prod_{\\alpha\\in A}F \\cong\n    F^A\n  </math>\nis a special case of a [[Direct sum of modules#Properties|general result]] relating direct sums (of modules) to direct products.\n\nThus if the basis is infinite, then the algebraic dual space is ''always'' of larger dimension (as a [[cardinal number]]) than the original vector space.

Conversely, any isomorphism <math>\\Phi</math> from ''V'' to a subspace of ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup> (resp., all of ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup> if ''V'' is finite dimensional) defines a unique nondegenerate bilinear form {{nowrap|<math> \\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_{\\Phi} </math>}} on ''V'' by\n\n:<math> \\langle v,w \\rangle_\\Phi = (\\Phi (v))(w) = [\\Phi (v),w].\\,</math>\n\nThus there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphisms of ''V'' to subspaces of (resp., all of) ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup> and nondegenerate bilinear forms on ''V''.\n\nIf the vector space ''V'' is over the [[complex numbers|complex]] field, then sometimes it is more natural to consider [[sesquilinear form]]s instead of bilinear forms.

Note that infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are not a counterexample to this, as they are isomorphic to their continuous duals, not to their algebraic duals.\n\n=== Transpose of a linear map ===\n<!-- [[matrix (mathematics)]] and [[transpose]] link here -->\n{{Main|Transpose of a linear map}}\nIf {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''W''}} is a [[linear map]], then the ''[[Transpose#Transpose of linear maps|transpose]]'' (or ''dual'') {{nowrap|''f''{{i sup|\u2217}} : ''W''{{i sup|\u2217}} \u2192 ''V''{{i sup|\u2217}}}} is defined by\n: <math>\n    f^*(\\varphi) = \\varphi \\circ f \\,\n  </math>\nfor every {{nowrap|''\u03c6'' \u2208 ''W''{{i sup|\u2217}}}}. The resulting functional ''f''{{i sup|\u2217}}(''\u03c6'') in ''V''{{i sup|\u2217}} is called the ''[[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]]'' of ''\u03c6'' along ''f''.\n\nThe following identity holds for all {{nowrap|''\u03c6'' \u2208 ''W''<sup>\u2217</sup>}} and {{nowrap|''v'' \u2208 ''V''}}:\n: <math>\n    [f^*(\\varphi),\\, v] = [\\varphi,\\, f(v)],\n  </math>\nwhere the bracket [\u00b7,\u00b7] on the left is the natural pairing of ''V'' with its dual space, and that on the right is the natural pairing of ''W'' with its dual.  This identity characterizes the transpose,<ref>{{harvtxt|Halmos|1974|loc=\u00a744}}</ref> and is formally similar to the definition of the [[adjoint of an operator|adjoint]].\n\nThe assignment {{nowrap|''f'' \u21a6 ''f''{{i sup|\u2217}}}} produces an [[injective]] linear map between the space of linear operators from ''V'' to ''W'' and the space of linear operators from ''W''{{i sup|\u2217}} to ''V''{{i sup|\u2217}}; this homomorphism is an [[isomorphism]] if and only if ''W'' is finite-dimensional. If {{nowrap|1=''V'' = ''W''}} then the space of linear maps is actually an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] under [[composition of maps]], and the assignment is then an [[antihomomorphism]] of algebras, meaning that {{nowrap|1=(''fg''){{sup|\u2217}} = ''g''{{i sup|\u2217}}''f''{{i sup|\u2217}}}}. In the language of [[category theory]], taking the dual of vector spaces and the transpose of linear maps is therefore a [[contravariant functor]] from the category of vector spaces over ''F'' to itself. Note that one can identify  (''f''{{i sup|\u2217}}){{sup|\u2217}} with ''f'' using the natural injection into the double dual.\n\nIf the linear map ''f'' is represented by the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] ''A'' with respect to two bases of ''V'' and ''W'', then ''f''{{i sup|\u2217}} is represented by the [[transpose]] matrix ''A''<sup>T</sup> with respect to the dual bases of ''W''{{i sup|\u2217}} and ''V''{{i sup|\u2217}}, hence the name. Alternatively, as ''f'' is represented by ''A'' acting on the left on column vectors, ''f''{{i sup|\u2217}} is represented by the same matrix acting on the right on row vectors. These points of view are related by the canonical inner product on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, which identifies the space of column vectors with the dual space of row vectors.\n\n=== Quotient spaces and annihilators ===\nLet ''S'' be a subset of ''V''. The '''[[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]]''' of ''S'' in ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup>, denoted here ''S''{{sup|0}}, is the collection of linear functionals {{nowrap|''f'' \u2208 ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup>}} such that {{nowrap|1=[''f'', ''s''] = 0}} for all {{nowrap|''s'' \u2208 ''S''}}. That is, ''S''{{sup|0}} consists of all linear functionals {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''F''}} such that the restriction to ''S'' vanishes: {{nowrap|1=''f''{{!}}<sub>''S''</sub> = 0}}.\n\nThe annihilator of a subset is itself a vector space. In particular, {{nowrap|1=\u2205{{sup|0}} = ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is all of ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup> ([[vacuously true|vacuously]]), whereas {{nowrap|1=''V''{{sup|0}} = 0}} is the zero subspace. Furthermore, the assignment of an annihilator to a subset of ''V'' reverses inclusions, so that if {{nowrap|''S'' \u2282 ''T'' \u2282 ''V''}}, then\n: <math>\n    0 \\subset T^0 \\subset S^0 \\subset V^* .\n  </math>\n\nMoreover, if ''A'' and ''B'' are two subsets of ''V'', then\n: <math>\n    (A \\cap B)^0 \\supseteq A^0 + B^0,\n  </math>\nand equality holds provided ''V'' is finite-dimensional. If ''A<sub>i</sub>'' is any family of subsets of ''V'' indexed by ''i'' belonging to some index set ''I'', then\n: <math>\n    \\left(\\bigcup_{i\\in I} A_i\\right)^0 = \\bigcap_{i\\in I} A_i^0 .\n  </math>\nIn particular if ''A'' and ''B'' are subspaces of ''V'', it follows that\n: <math>\n    (A + B)^0 = A^0 \\cap B^0 .\n  </math>\n\nIf ''V'' is finite-dimensional, and ''W'' is a [[vector subspace]], then\n: <math>\n    W^{00} = W\n  </math>\nafter identifying ''W'' with its image in the second dual space under the double duality isomorphism {{nowrap|''V'' \u2248 ''V''<sup>\u2217\u2217</sup>}}.  Thus, in particular, forming the annihilator is a [[Galois connection]] on the lattice of subsets of a finite-dimensional vector space.\n\nIf ''W'' is a subspace of ''V'' then the [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] ''V''/''W'' is a vector space in its own right, and so has a dual.  By the [[first isomorphism theorem]], a functional {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''F''}} factors through ''V''/''W'' if and only if ''W'' is in the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ''f''.  There is thus an isomorphism\n: <math> (V/W)^* \\cong W^0 .</math>\nAs a particular consequence, if ''V'' is a [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of two subspaces ''A'' and ''B'', then ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup> is a direct sum of ''A''{{sup|0}} and ''B''{{sup|0}}.\n\n== Continuous dual space ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Reflexive space]] -->\nWhen dealing with [[topological vector space]]s, one is typically only interested in the [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] linear functionals from the space into the base field <math>{\\mathbb F}={\\mathbb C}</math> (or <math>{\\mathbb R}</math>). This gives rise to the notion of the \"continuous dual space\" or \"topological dual\" which is a linear subspace of the algebraic dual space <math>V^*</math>, denoted by <math>V'</math>. For any ''finite-dimensional'' normed vector space or topological vector space, such as [[Euclidean space|Euclidean ''n-''space]], the continuous dual and the algebraic dual coincide. This is however false for any infinite-dimensional normed space, as shown by the example of [[discontinuous linear map]]s. Nevertheless, in the theory of [[topological vector space]]s the terms \"continuous dual space\" and \"topological dual space\" are often replaced by \"dual space\", since there is no serious need to consider discontinuous maps in this field.\n\nFor a [[topological vector space]] <math>V</math> its ''continuous dual space'',<ref name=\"A.P.Robertson, W.Robertson 1964 loc=II.2\">{{harvtxt|A.P.Robertson, W.Robertson|1964|loc=II.2}}</ref> or ''topological dual space'',<ref name=\"H.Schaefer 1966 loc=II.4\">{{harvtxt|H.Schaefer|1966|loc=II.4}}</ref> or just ''dual space''<ref name=\"A.P.Robertson, W.Robertson 1964 loc=II.2\"/><ref name=\"H.Schaefer 1966 loc=II.4\"/><ref>{{harvtxt|W.Rudin|1973|loc=3.1}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Nicolas Bourbaki|2003|loc=II.42}}</ref> (in the sense of the theory of topological vector spaces) <math>V'</math> is defined as the space of all continuous linear functionals <math>\\varphi:V\\to{\\mathbb F}</math>.\n\nThere is a standard construction for introducing a topology on the continuous dual <math>V'</math> of a topological vector space <math>V</math>. Fix a collection <math>{\\mathcal A}</math> of [[Bounded set (topological vector space)|bounded subsets]] of <math>V</math>. Then one has the topology on <math>V</math> of uniform convergence on sets from <math>{\\mathcal A}</math>, or what is the same thing, the topology generated by [[norm (mathematics)|seminorms]] of the form \n: <math>\n    \\|\\varphi\\|_A = \\sup_{x\\in A} |\\varphi(x)|, \n  </math>\nwhere <math>\\varphi</math> is a continuous linear functional on <math>V</math>, and <math>A</math> runs over the class <math>{\\mathcal A}</math>.\n\nThis means that a net of functionals <math>\\varphi_i</math> tends to a functional <math>\\varphi</math> in <math>V'</math> if and only if \n: <math>\n\\forall A\\in{\\mathcal A}\\qquad  \\|\\varphi_i-\\varphi\\|_A = \\sup_{x\\in A} |\\varphi_i(x)-\\varphi(x)|\\underset{i\\to\\infty}{\\longrightarrow}0. \n  </math>\nUsually (but not necessarily) the class <math>{\\mathcal A}</math> is supposed to satisfy the following conditions:\n* each point <math>x</math> of <math>V</math> belongs to some set <math>A\\in{\\mathcal A}</math>\n: <math>\n    \\forall x\\in V\\qquad \\exists A\\in {\\mathcal A}\\qquad x\\in A,\n  </math>\n* each two sets <math>A\\in{\\mathcal A}</math> and <math>B\\in{\\mathcal A}</math> are contained in some set <math>C\\in{\\mathcal A}</math>:\n: <math>\n    \\forall A,B\\in {\\mathcal A}\\qquad \\exists C\\in {\\mathcal A}\\qquad A\\cup B\\subseteq C,\n  </math>\n* <math>{\\mathcal A}</math> is closed under the operation of multiplication by scalars:  \n: <math>\n    \\forall A\\in {\\mathcal A}\\qquad \\forall\\lambda\\in{\\mathbb F}\\qquad \\lambda\\cdot A\\in {\\mathcal A},\n  </math>\n\nIf these requirements are fulfilled then the corresponding topology on <math>V'</math> is Hausdorff and the sets \n: <math>\n    U_A=\\{\\varphi\\in V':\\quad ||\\varphi||_A<1\\},\\qquad A\\in {\\mathcal A}, \n  </math>\nform its local base.\n\nHere are the three most important special cases.\n\n* The [[Strong topology (polar topology)|strong topology]] on <math>V'</math> is the topology of uniform convergence on [[Bounded set (topological vector space)|bounded subsets]] in <math>V</math> (so here <math>{\\mathcal A}</math> can be chosen as the class of all bounded subsets in <math>V</math>). If <math>V</math> is a [[normed vector space]] (e.g., a [[Banach space]] or a [[Hilbert space]]) then the strong topology on <math>V'</math> is normed (in fact a Banach space if the field of scalars is complete), with the norm \n: <math>\n    \\|\\varphi\\| = \\sup_{\\|x\\| \\le 1 } |\\varphi(x)|.\n  </math>\n\n* The [[stereotype space|stereotype topology]] on <math>V'</math>  is the topology of uniform convergence on [[Totally bounded space|totally bounded sets]] in <math>V</math> (so here <math>{\\mathcal A}</math>  can be chosen as the class of all totally bounded subsets in <math>V</math>).\n* The [[weak topology]] on <math>V'</math> is the topology of uniform convergence on finite subsets in <math>V</math> (so here <math>{\\mathcal A}</math>  can be chosen as the class of all finite subsets in <math>V</math>).\n\nEach of these three choices of topology on <math>V'</math> leads to a variant of [[Reflexive space|reflexivity property]] for topological vector spaces.\n\n=== Examples ===\nLet 1 < ''p'' < \u221e be a real number and consider the Banach space ''[[Lp space#The p-norm in countably infinite dimensions|\u2113<sup>&thinsp;p</sup>]]'' of all [[sequence]]s {{nowrap|'''a''' {{=}} (''a''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} for which\n: <math>\n    \\|\\mathbf{a}\\|_p = \\left ( \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty |a_n|^p \\right) ^{1/p}\n  </math>\nis finite. Define the number ''q'' by {{nowrap|1/''p'' + 1/''q'' {{=}} 1}}.  Then the continuous dual of ''\u2113<sup>&thinsp;p</sup>'' is naturally identified with ''\u2113<sup>&thinsp;q</sup>'': given an element {{nowrap|''\u03c6'' \u2208 (''\u2113<sup>&thinsp;p</sup>'')\u2032}}, the corresponding element of {{nowrap|''\u2113<sup>&thinsp;q</sup>''}} is the sequence (''\u03c6''('''e'''<sub>''n''</sub>)) where '''e'''<sub>''n''</sub> denotes the sequence whose ''n-''th term is 1 and all others are zero. Conversely, given an element {{nowrap|'''a''' {{=}} (''a<sub>n</sub>'') \u2208 ''\u2113<sup>&thinsp;q</sup>''}}, the corresponding continuous linear functional ''\u03c6'' on {{nowrap|''\u2113<sup>&thinsp;p</sup>''}} is defined by {{nowrap|''\u03c6''('''b''') {{=}} \u2211<sub>''n''</sub> ''a<sub>n</sub>b<sub>n</sub>''}} for all {{nowrap|'''b''' {{=}} (''b<sub>n</sub>'') \u2208 ''\u2113<sup>&thinsp;p</sup>''}} (see [[H\u00f6lder's inequality]]).\n\nIn a similar manner, the continuous dual of {{nowrap|''\u2113''<sup>&thinsp;1</sup>}} is naturally identified with {{nowrap|''\u2113''<sup>&thinsp;\u221e</sup>}} (the space of bounded sequences). Furthermore, the continuous duals of the Banach spaces ''c'' (consisting of all [[limit of a sequence|convergent]] sequences, with the [[supremum norm]]) and ''c''<sub>0</sub> (the sequences converging to zero) are both naturally identified with {{nowrap|''\u2113''<sup>&thinsp;1</sup>}}.\n\nBy the [[Riesz representation theorem]], the continuous dual of a Hilbert space is again a Hilbert space which is [[antiisomorphic|anti-isomorphic]] to the original space. This gives rise to the [[bra\u2013ket notation]] used by physicists in the mathematical formulation of [[quantum mechanics]].\n\nBy the [[Riesz\u2013Markov\u2013Kakutani representation theorem]], the continuous dual of certain spaces of continuous functions can be described using measures.\n\n=== Transpose of a continuous linear map ===\nIf {{nowrap|''T'' : ''V \u2192 W''}} is a continuous linear map between two topological vector spaces, then the (continuous) transpose  {{nowrap|''T\u2032'' : ''W\u2032 \u2192 V\u2032''}} is defined by the same formula as before:\n: <math>\n    T'(\\varphi) = \\varphi \\circ T, \\quad \\varphi \\in W'. \\,\n  </math>\nThe resulting functional {{nowrap|''T\u2032''(''\u03c6'')}} is in{{nowrap| ''V\u2032''}}.

When ''T'' and ''U'' are composable continuous linear maps, then\n: <math>\n    (U \\circ T)' = T' \\circ U'. \\,\n  </math>\n\nWhen ''V'' and ''W'' are normed spaces, the norm of the transpose in{{nowrap| ''L''(''W\u2032'', ''V\u2032'')}} is equal to that of ''T'' in{{nowrap| ''L''(''V'', ''W'')}}. Several properties of transposition depend upon the [[Hahn\u2013Banach theorem]]. For example, the bounded linear map ''T'' has dense range if and only if the transpose {{nowrap|''T\u2032''}} is injective.\n\nWhen ''T'' is a [[Compact operator|compact]] linear map between two Banach spaces ''V'' and ''W'', then the transpose {{nowrap|''T\u2032''}} is compact. This can be proved using the [[Arzel\u00e0\u2013Ascoli theorem]].\n\nWhen ''V'' is a Hilbert space, there is an antilinear isomorphism ''i<sub>V</sub>'' from ''V'' onto its continuous dual{{nowrap| ''V\u2032''}}. For every bounded linear map ''T'' on ''V'', the transpose and the [[Hermitian adjoint|adjoint]] operators are linked by\n: <math>\n    i_V \\circ T^* = T' \\circ i_V. \\,\n  </math>\n\nWhen ''T'' is a continuous linear map between two topological vector spaces ''V'' and ''W'', then the transpose {{nowrap|''T\u2032''}} is continuous when {{nowrap|''W\u2032''}} and {{nowrap|''V\u2032''}} are equipped with\"compatible\" topologies: for example when, for {{nowrap|''X'' {{=}} ''V''}} and {{nowrap|''X'' {{=}} ''W''}}, both duals {{nowrap|''X\u2032''}} have the [[Strong topology (polar topology)|strong topology]] {{nowrap|''\u03b2''(''X\u2032'', ''X'')}} of uniform convergence on bounded sets of ''X'', or both have the weak-\u2217 topology {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(''X\u2032'', ''X'')}} of pointwise convergence on&nbsp;''X''.  The transpose {{nowrap|''T\u2032''}} is continuous from {{nowrap|''\u03b2''(''W\u2032'', ''W'')}} to {{nowrap|''\u03b2''(''V\u2032'', ''V'')}}, or from {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(''W\u2032'', ''W'')}} to {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(''V\u2032'', ''V'')}}.\n\n=== Annihilators ===\nAssume that ''W'' is a closed linear subspace of a normed space&nbsp;''V'', and consider the annihilator of ''W'' in{{nowrap| ''V\u2032''}},\n: <math>\n    W^\\perp = \\{ \\varphi \\in V' : W \\subset \\ker \\varphi\\}. \\,\n  </math>\nThen, the dual of the quotient {{nowrap|''V''&thinsp;/&thinsp;''W''&thinsp;}} can be identified with ''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup>, and the dual of ''W'' can be identified with the quotient {{nowrap|''V\u2032''&thinsp;/&thinsp;''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Rudin|1991|loc=chapter 4}}</ref> Indeed, let ''P'' denote the canonical [[surjection]] from ''V'' onto the quotient {{nowrap|''V''&thinsp;/&thinsp;''W''&thinsp;}}; then, the transpose {{nowrap|''P\u2032''}} is an isometric isomorphism from {{nowrap|(''V''&thinsp;/&thinsp;''W''&thinsp;)\u2032}} into{{nowrap| ''V\u2032''}}, with range equal to ''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup>. If ''j'' denotes the injection map from ''W'' into ''V'', then the kernel of the transpose {{nowrap|''j\u2032''}} is the annihilator of ''W'':\n:<math>\\ker (j') = W^\\perp</math>\nand it follows from the [[Hahn\u2013Banach theorem]] that {{nowrap|''j\u2032''}} induces an isometric isomorphism\n{{nowrap|''V\u2032''&thinsp;/&thinsp;''W''<sup>\u22a5</sup> \u2192 ''W\u2032''}}.\n\n=== Further properties ===\nIf the dual of a normed space ''V'' is [[separable space|separable]], then so is the space ''V'' itself. The converse is not true: for example the space {{nowrap|''\u2113''<sup>&thinsp;1</sup>}} is separable, but its dual {{nowrap|''\u2113''<sup>&thinsp;\u221e</sup>}} is not.\n\n===Topologies on the dual===\nThe topology of ''V'' and the topology of real or complex numbers can be used to induce on ''V\u2032'' a [[Space of linear maps#G-topologies on X induced by the continuous dual|dual space topology]].\n\n=== Double dual ===\n[[File:Double dual nature.svg|thumbnail|This is a [[natural transformation]] of vector addition from a vector space to its double dual. {{nowrap|{{langle}}''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>{{rangle}}}} denotes the [[ordered pair]] of two vectors. The addition + sends ''x''<sub>1</sub> and ''x''<sub>2</sub> to {{nowrap|''x''<sub>1</sub> + ''x''<sub>2</sub>}}. The addition +\u2032 induced by the transformation can be defined as {{nowrap|(\u03a8(''x''<sub>1</sub>) +\u2032 \u03a8(''x''<sub>2</sub>))(''\u03c6'')}} {{nowrap|1== ''\u03c6''(''x''<sub>1</sub> + ''x''<sub>2</sub>)}} {{nowrap|1== ''\u03c6''(''x'')}} for any ''\u03c6'' in the dual space.]]\nIn analogy with the case of the algebraic double dual, there is always a naturally defined continuous linear operator {{nowrap|\u03a8 : ''V'' \u2192 ''V\u2032\u2032''}} from a normed space ''V'' into its continuous double dual {{nowrap|''V\u2032\u2032''}}, defined by\n: <math> \\Psi(x)(\\varphi) = \\varphi(x), \\quad x \\in V, \\ \\varphi \\in V' .</math>\n\nAs a consequence of the [[Hahn\u2013Banach theorem]], this map is in fact an [[isometry]], meaning {{nowrap|1=\u2016 \u03a8(''x'') \u2016 = \u2016 ''x'' \u2016}} for all ''x'' in&nbsp;''V''. Normed spaces for which the map \u03a8 is a [[bijection]] are called [[reflexive space|reflexive]].\n\nWhen ''V'' is a [[topological vector space]], one can still define \u03a8(''x'') by the same formula, for every {{nowrap|''x'' \u2208 ''V''}}, however several difficulties arise. First, when ''V'' is not [[Locally convex topological vector space|locally convex]], the continuous dual may be equal to {0} and the map \u03a8 trivial.  However, if ''V'' is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] and locally convex, the map \u03a8 is injective from ''V'' to the algebraic dual {{nowrap|''V\u2032''<sup>\u2217</sup>}} of the continuous dual, again as a consequence of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem.<ref>If ''V'' is locally convex but not Hausdorff, the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of \u03a8 is the smallest closed subspace containing {0}.</ref>\n\nSecond, even in the locally convex setting, several natural vector space topologies can be defined on the continuous dual {{nowrap|''V\u2032''}}, so that the continuous double dual {{nowrap|''V\u2032\u2032''}} is not uniquely defined as a set. Saying that \u03a8 maps from ''V'' to {{nowrap|''V\u2032\u2032''}}, or in other words, that \u03a8(''x'') is continuous on {{nowrap|''V\u2032''}} for every {{nowrap|''x'' \u2208 ''V''}}, is a reasonable minimal requirement on the topology of {{nowrap|''V\u2032''}}, namely that the evaluation mappings\n: <math> \\varphi \\in V' \\mapsto \\varphi(x), \\quad x \\in V , </math>\nbe continuous for the chosen topology on {{nowrap|''V\u2032''}}. Further, there is still a choice of a topology on {{nowrap|''V\u2032\u2032''}}, and continuity of \u03a8 depends upon this choice. As a consequence, defining [[Reflexive space#Locally convex spaces|reflexivity]] in this framework is more involved than in the normed  case.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Duality (mathematics)]]\n*[[Duality (projective geometry)]]\n*[[Pontryagin duality]]\n*[[Reciprocal lattice]] \u2013 dual space basis, in crystallography\n*[[Covariance and contravariance of vectors]]\n*[[Dual norm]]\n*[[Dual module]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*  {{citation|authorlink = Nicolas Bourbaki|last=Bourbaki|first=Nicolas| title = Elements of mathematics, Algebra I| publisher = Springer-Verlag | year = 1989|isbn=3-540-64243-9}}\n* {{citation\n | authorlink = Nicolas Bourbaki \n | last = Bourbaki\n | first = Nicolas.\n | year = 2003\n | title = Elements of mathematics, Topological vector spaces\n | publisher = Springer-Verlag\n | location = \n | isbn = \n}}\n* {{citation|last=Halmos|first=Paul|title=Finite-dimensional Vector Spaces|url=https://archive.org/details/HalmosP.R.FiniteDimensionalVectorSpaces.SpringerVerlag205s_201703|year=1974|authorlink=Paul Halmos|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-387-90093-4}}\n* {{Lang Algebra|edition=3r}}\n* {{citation|first1=Saunders|last1=MacLane|authorlink1=Saunders MacLane|first2=Garrett|last2=Birkhoff|authorlink2=Garrett Birkhoff|title=Algebra|edition=3rd|publisher=AMS Chelsea Publishing|year=1999|isbn=0-8218-1646-2}}.\n* {{Citation\n | first1=Charles W.\n | last1=Misner\n | authorlink1=Charles W.

Many enthusiasts emerged to form groups to study and practice Dianetics. The atmosphere from which Dianetics was written about in this period was one of \"excited experimentation\". Roy Wallis writes that Hubbard's work was regarded as an \"initial exploration\" for further development.<ref>{{cite journal |title=SCIENTOLOGY: THERAPEUTIC CULT TO RELIGIOUS SECT |journal=Sociology |year=1975 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=89\u2013100 |jstor=42851574|doi=10.1177/003803857500900105}}</ref> Hubbard wrote an additional six books in 1951, drawing the attention of a significant fan base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/l-ron-hubbard-publishes-dianetics|title=L.

By his own account,<ref name=\"urban2006\">Urban, Hugh B. \"Fair Game: Secrecy, Security, and the Church of Scientology in Cold War America.\" ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'' '''74''':2 (2006)</ref> LRH had been injured by the premature detonation of a primer mechanism on a small depth charge that had become stuck in the launch rack aboard the navy ship he was assigned to in 1941. His injuries were mainly flash burns to his eyes and so was despatched ashore and he spent a great deal of his recovery time in the [[Naval Hospital Oakland|Oak Knoll Naval Hospital's]] library, (despite claiming in his authorised biography that he was blinded). LRH encountered the work of Thompson, Korzybski, Jung, Freud, Perls and other [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]].\n\nIn his 1955 Phoenix Lectures Series, Hubbard himself, explains that he took the opportunity to enter an office where research papers on the US Naval Medical Research Division's work on PTSD were kept in a filing cabinet and he spent the lunch hour free to read the notes left lying on the desk of the Naval Medical Officer involved. Much of what he learned then, along with his recent mastery of hypnotherapy technique by mail order, was influential in his later development of ideas and concepts for Dianetics Therapy from 1947 onwards. All he needed was medical and scientific testing and approval from any source. However, his several attempts were blocked by several luminaries of the (AMA) American Medical Association in the years 1948\u20131958, such as Professors Duncan Cameron and Allan Whyte (White), who both were senior authorities within the AMA-funded Psychiatric Research Department, then conducting their own research into drug therapies and controversial psycho-surgical techniques on severely traumatised war veterans.\n\nHubbard claimed in his several public lectures during the 1950s to have \"undertaken clinical research at several of the institutions\" they, Cameron and Whyte, had directed. Historical AMA records show that LRH was never officially involved in any approved clinical trials or research into PTSD. It is thought that Hubbard simply privately visited patients and conducted unauthorised interviews with several war veterans suffering from Trauma, Psychosomatic illness and practiced some of the newly identified PTSD techniques being clinically tested by several AMA medical institutions after WW2. (from personal Interviews with Joseph A. Winter, in Peoria,1959).\n\nIn April 1950, Hubbard, and several others, (Marjorie Cameron, De Mille, Art Ceppos, AE Van Vogt, Joseph A. Winter, MD.), established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] to coordinate work related to the forthcoming publication of DMSMH by Random House in May 1950 in NYC. Through the marketing efforts of Hubbard's friend and mentor John W. Campbell Jnr., (editor of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'' of Street and Smith fame), Hubbard's articles on Dianetics hit the newsstands in NYC and became an overnight sensation among the usual readers with almost 350,000 copies sold of the May 1950 issue. (See interviews with John Campbell in his published 1978 biography.)\n\n=== Publication ===\nHubbard first introduced Dianetics to the public in the article ''[[Dianetics: The Evolution of a Science]]'' published in the May 1950 issue of the magazine ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]''.<ref name=\"Creation\">{{cite web | url = http://www.solitarytrees.net/pubs/skent/creation.htm?FACTNet#txtref02 | title = The Creation of 'Religious' Scientology | publisher = Religious Studies and Theology | accessdate = 8 May 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070312004725/http://www.solitarytrees.net/pubs/skent/creation.htm?FACTNet#txtref02 | archivedate = 12 March 2007 | df = dmy-all }} Originally published by Stephen A.

He stated, \"Dianetics is a science which applies to man, a living organism; and Scientology is a religion.\"<ref name=\"Urban 2011\"/> When Hubbard morphed Dianetics therapy into the religion of Scientology, Jesper Aagaard Petersen of Oxford University surmises that it could have been for the benefits from establishing it is a religion as much as it could have been from the result of Hubbard's \"discovery of past life experiences and his exploration of the thetan.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Petersen |first1=Jesper Aagaard |title=Controversial New Religions |publisher=Oxford University |year=2014 }}</ref> The reason being to avoid copyright infringement issues with use of the name Dianetics then held by Don Purcell.

Scientologists refer to the book ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'' as \"Book One.\" In 1952, Hubbard published a new set of teachings as \"Scientology, a religious philosophy.\" Scientology did not replace Dianetics but extended it to cover new areas: Where the goal of Dianetics is to rid the individual of his [[reactive mind]] [[engram (Dianetics)|engrams]], the stated goal of Scientology is to rehabilitate the individual's spiritual nature so that he may reach his full potential.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lebron |first1=Robyn E. |title=Searching for Spiritual Unity...can There Be Common Ground?: A Basic Internet Guide to Forty World Religions & Spiritual Practices |publisher=Crossbooks |year=2012 |isbn=1462712614 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1963 and again in May 1969, Hubbard reorganized the material in Dianetics, the auditing commands, and original Volney Mathieson invented [[E-meter]] use, naming the package \"Standard Dianetics.\"  In a 1969 bulletin, \"This bulletin combines HCOB 27 April 1969 'R-3-R Restated' with those parts of HCOB 24 June 1963 'Routine 3-R' used in the new Standard Dianetic Course and its application.

A basic idea in Dianetics is that the mind consists of two parts: the \"analytical mind\" and the \"[[reactive mind]].\" The \"reactive mind\", the mind which operates when a person is physically unconscious, acts as a record of shock, trauma, pain, and otherwise harmful memories. Experiences such as these, stored in the \"reactive mind\" are dubbed \"[[engram (Dianetics)|engrams]]\". Dianetics is proposed as a method to erase these engrams in the reactive mind to achieve a state of [[Clear (Scientology)|clear]].<ref name=\"James R. Lewis 1997, page 287\"/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = Pat | year = 1971 | title = Scientology and Dianetics | journal = The Journal of Education | volume = 153 | issue = 4| pages = 58\u201361 | jstor=42773008}}</ref>\n\nHubbard described Dianetics as \"an organized science of thought built on definite axioms: statements of [[natural law]]s on the order of those of the physical sciences\".<ref>Winter, J.A. ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 18 (Julian Press, 1987 reprint)</ref> In April 1950, before the public release of Dianetics, he wrote: \"To date, over two hundred patients have been treated; of those two hundred, two hundred cures have been obtained.\"<ref>Hubbard, \"Dianetics\". ''Astounding Science Fiction'', May 1950.</ref>\n\nIn Dianetics, the unconscious or reactive mind is described as a collection of \"mental image pictures,\" which contain the recorded experience of past moments of unconsciousness, including all sensory perceptions and feelings involved, ranging from [[pre-natal]] experiences, infancy and childhood, to even the traumatic feelings associated with events from past lives and extraterrestrial cultures. The type of mental image picture created during a period of [[unconsciousness]] involves the exact recording of a painful experience. Hubbard called this phenomenon an [[engram (Dianetics)|engram]], and defined it as \"a complete recording of a moment of unconsciousness containing physical pain or painful emotion and all perceptions.\"<ref>[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]] page 79 and Glossary</ref>\n\nHubbard said that in Dianetics, it was the analytical mind and not the reactive mind that was the most important because the analytical mind \"computes decisions\" even when these are dictated by the reactive mind. The damage and aberration caused by the reactive mind would not be possible without the analytic mind. Hubbard stated, \"the analytical is so important to the intelligent being and the somatic mind so important to the athlete that Dianetics processing can be said to consist of deintensifying the reactive mind so that the analytical and somatic minds can be free to function properly.\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rethinking Scientology A Thorough Analysis of L.

When the analytical (conscious) mind shut down during these moments, events and perceptions of this period were stored as engrams in the unconscious or reactive mind.  (In Hubbard's earliest publications on the subject, engrams were variously referred to as \"Norns\",<ref name=\"Creation\"/> \"Impediments,\" and \"comanomes\" before \"engram\" was adapted from its existing usage at the suggestion of Joseph Augustus Winter, MD.)<ref name=\"Blue Sky\">{{cite book | last = Atack | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Atack | year = 1990 | title = A Piece of Blue Sky | publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-8184-0499-X| page=109}}</ref> Some commentators noted Dianetics's blend of science fiction and [[occult]] orientations at the time.<ref name=\"Creation\"/>\n\nHubbard claimed that these engrams are the cause of almost all psychological and physical problems. In addition to physical pain, engrams could include words or phrases spoken in the vicinity while the patient was unconscious. For instance, Winter cites the example of a patient with a persistent headache supposedly tracing the problem to a doctor saying, \"Take him now,\" during the patient's birth.<ref>Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 165</ref>  Hubbard similarly claimed that [[leukemia]] is traceable to \"an engram containing the phrase 'It turns my blood to water.'\"<ref>Hubbard, ''A History of Man'', p.20. American Saint Hill Organization, 1968</ref>  While it is sometimes claimed that the Church of Scientology no longer stands by Hubbard's claims that Dianetics can treat physical conditions, it still publishes them:  \"... when the knee injuries of the past are located and discharged, the [[arthritis]] ceases, no other injury takes its place and the person is finished with arthritis of the knee.\"<ref>Hubbard, L.

When a person is \"aberrated,\" the reactive mind controls the somatic mind.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rethinking Scientology A Thorough Analysis of L.

Basic concepts, including [[conversion disorder]], are derived from [[Sigmund Freud]], whom Hubbard credited as an inspiration and source.<ref>Letter from John W. Campbell, cited in Winter, p. 3 - \"His approach is, actually, based on some very early work of Freud\"</ref> Freud had speculated 40 years previously that traumas with similar content join together in \"chains,\" embedded in the unconscious mind, to cause irrational responses in the individual. Such a chain would be relieved by inducing the patient to remember the earliest trauma, \"with an accompanying expression of emotion.\"<ref>Joseph Breuer and Sigmund Freud, \"Studies in Hysteria\", Vol II of the ''Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Hogarth Press, London (1955).</ref><ref>L. Ron Hubbard ''A Critique of Psychoanalysis'', PAB 92, 10 July 1956.</ref>\n\nAccording to Bent Corydon, Hubbard created the illusion that Dianetics was the first [[psychotherapy]] to address [[traumatic experience]]s in their own time, but others had done so as standard procedure.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130613033101/http://anonireland.com/content/wppdfcontent/books/messiahormadmen.pdf</ref>\n\nOne treatment method Hubbard drew from in developing Dianetics was [[abreaction therapy]].  [[Abreaction]] is a [[psychoanalytical]] [[technical terminology|term]] that means bringing to [[consciousness]], and thus adequate expression, material that has been unconscious. \"It includes not only the recollection of forgotten memories and [[experience]], but also their reliving with appropriate emotional display and discharge of effect. This process is usually facilitated by the patient's gaining awareness of the [[causal relationship]] between the previously undischarged [[emotion]] and his [[symptom]]s.\"<ref>Bent Corydon ''L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman?'', pp. 283-4, Barricade Books Inc., 1992 {{ISBN|0-942637-57-7}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Hubbard, before Dianetics psychotherapists had dealt with very light and superficial incidents (e.g. an incident that reminds the patient of a moment of loss), but with Dianetic therapy, the patient could actually erase moments of pain and unconsciousness. He emphasized: \"The discovery of the engram is entirely the property of Dianetics. Methods of its erasure are also owned entirely by Dianetics...\"<ref>''A Critique of Psychoanalysis'', ibid. Pab 92</ref>\n\nWhile 1950 style Dianetics was in some respects similar to older therapies, with the development of New Era Dianetics in 1978, the similarity vanished.

The central technique was \"auditing,\" a two-person [[talk therapy|question-and-answer therapy]] designed to isolate and dissipate engrams (or \"mental masses\"). An auditor addresses questions to a subject, observes and records the subject's responses, and returns repeatedly to experiences or areas under discussion that appear painful until the troubling experience has been identified and confronted. Through repeated applications of this method, the reactive mind could be \"cleared\" of its content having outlived its usefulness in the [[Process (science)|process]] of [[evolution]]; a person who has completed this process would be \"Clear\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Wright |first1=Lawrence |title=Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4IDPV2hZL0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=l.+ron+hubbard+dianetics+reactive+mind+clear&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwibg9vpoZrRAhVD0oMKHdhfAKEQ6AEINDAD#v=onepage&q=reactive%20mind&f=false |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |year=2013 |isbn=9780385350273 |accessdate=2016-01-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe benefits of going Clear, according to Hubbard, were dramatic. A Clear would have no compulsions, repressions, [[psychosis|psychoses]] or [[neurosis|neuroses]], and would enjoy a near-perfect memory as well as a rise in [[IQ]] of as much as 50 points. He also claimed that \"the atheist is activated by engrams as thoroughly as the zealot\".<ref>Hubbard, \"Dianetics and Religion,\" ''Dianetic Auditor's Bulletin'' vol. 1 no. 4, October 1950</ref> He further claimed that widespread application of Dianetics would result in \"A world without [[insanity]], without criminals and without war.\"<ref>Hubbard, ''Science of Survival: Prediction of Human Behavior'' p. 1, Bridge Publications, 1990 (reissue).</ref>\n\nOne of the key ideas of Dianetics, according to Hubbard, is the fundamental existential command to survive. According to Hugh B. Urban, this would serve as the foundation of a big part of later Scientology.<ref>{{cite book |last=Urban |first1=Hugh B. |title=The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=22 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Scientology journal ''The Auditor'', the total number of \"Clears\" as of May 2006 stands at 50,311.<ref>\"The Auditor,\" The Monthly Journal of Scientology, published by the American Saint Hill Organization, 1413 L.

Hubbard wrote, \u201cDianetics is an adventure. It is an exploration of terra incognita, the human mind, the vast and hitherto unknown realm half an inch back of our foreheads.\" According to ''Scientology in Popular Culture,'' Hubbard set out to colonize terra incognita, where in the \u201cpractice of empire was auditing, the new technology of empire was the E-meter. This exploration of the human mind \u201cwould become a defining feature of Scientology because it provided the portal through which he could conquer many enemy thetans.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=Kent |first1=Stephen A. |last2=Raine |first2=Susan |title=Scientology in Popular Culture: Influences and Struggles for Legitimacy |location=Santa Barbara, California |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2017 |isbn= 978-1440832499 }}</ref>\n\n==Procedure in practice==\n[[File:Dianetics demo at Union Station.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Scientologist]]s promoting Dianetics at [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] in Washington, D.C.]]\nThe procedure of Dianetics therapy (known as ''auditing'') is a two-person activity. One person, the \"auditor\", guides the other person, the \"pre-clear\". The pre-Clear's job is to look at the mind and talk to the auditor. The auditor acknowledges what the pre-Clear says and controls the process so the pre-Clear may put his full attention on his work.\n\nThe auditor and pre-Clear sit down in chairs facing each other. The process then follows in eleven distinct steps:<ref>This description is based on \"[http://www.rehabilitatenz.co.nz/pages/dianetics-auditing-steps.html The Dianetics Procedure - 10 Simple Steps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030226223940/http://www.rehabilitatenz.co.nz/pages/dianetics-auditing-steps.html |date=26 February 2003 }}\"</ref>\n\n*1. The auditor assures the pre-Clear that he will be fully aware of everything that happens during the session.\n*2. The pre-Clear is instructed to close his eyes for the session, entering a state of \"dianetic reverie\", signified by \"a tremble of the lashes\". During the session, the preclear remains in full possession of his will and retains full recall thereafter.\n*3. The auditor installs a \"canceller\", an instruction intended to absolutely cancel any form of positive suggestion that could accidentally occur. This is done by saying \"In the future, when I utter the word 'cancelled,' everything I have said to you while you are in a therapy session will be cancelled and will have no force with you. Any suggestion I may have made to you will be without force when I say the word 'cancelled.' Do you understand?\"\n*4. The auditor then asks the pre-Clear to locate an exact record of something that happened to the pre-Clear in his past: \"Locate an incident that you feel you can comfortably face.\"\n*5. The pre-Clear is invited by the auditor to \"Go through the incident and say what is happening as you go along.\"\n*6a. The auditor instructs the pre-Clear to recall as much as possible of the incident, going over it several times \"until the pre-Clear is cheerful about it\".\n*6b. When the pre-Clear is cheerful about an incident, the auditor instructs the pre-Clear to locate another incident: \"Let's find another incident that you feel you can comfortably face.\" The process outlined at steps 5 and 6a then repeats until the auditing session's time limit (usually two hours or so) is reached.\n*7. The pre-Clear is then instructed to \"return to present time\".\n*8. The auditor checks to make sure that the pre-Clear feels himself to be in \"present time\", i.e., not still recalling a past incident.\n*9. The auditor gives the pre-Clear the canceller word: \"Very good. Cancelled.\"\n*10. The auditor tells the pre-Clear to feel alert and return to full awareness of his surroundings: \"When I count from five to one and snap my fingers you will feel alert. Five, four, three, two, one.\" (snaps fingers)\n\nAuditing sessions are supposedly kept confidential. A few transcripts of auditing sessions with [[Sanitization (classified information)|confidential information removed]] have been published as demonstration examples. Some extracts can be found in J.A. Winter's book ''[[Dianetics: A Doctor's Report]]''. Other, more comprehensive, transcripts of auditing sessions carried out by Hubbard himself can be found in volume 1 of the ''Research & Discovery Series'' (Bridge Publications, 1980). Examples of public group processing sessions can be found throughout the ''Congresses'' lecture series.\n\nAccording to Hubbard, auditing enables the pre-Clear to \"contact\" and \"release\" engrams stored in the reactive mind, relieving him of the physical and mental aberrations connected with them. The pre-Clear is asked to inspect and familiarize himself with the exact details of his own experience; the auditor may not tell him anything about his case or evaluate any of the information the pre-Clear finds.\n\n==Scientific evaluation==\n\nHubbard's original book on Dianetics attracted highly critical reviews from science and medical writers and organizations. The [[American Psychological Association]] passed a resolution in 1950 calling \"attention to the fact that these claims are not supported by [[empiricism|empirical]] evidence of the sort required for the establishment of scientific generalizations.\"<ref>\"Psychologists Act Against Dianetics\", ''New York Times'', 9 September 1950</ref><ref name=timeapa>{{cite news | title = Tests & Poison | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,813284,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] | date = 18 September 1950 | accessdate = 10 February 2008 }}</ref> Subsequently, Dianetics has achieved no acceptance as a [[scientific theory]], and scientists cite Dianetics as an example of a [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=\":0\">See e.g. Gardner, ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''; Bauer, ''Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method'' and ''Science Or Pseudoscience: Magnetic Healing, Psychic Phenomena, and Other Heterodoxies''; Corsini ''et al.'', ''The Dictionary of Psychology''.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|chapter=Demise of the Dogmatic Universe|title=Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences|author=Ari Ben-Menahem|isbn=978-3-540-68831-0|year=2009|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-68832-7|pages=4301\u20134302}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1950, amidst the success of ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health|Dianetics]]'', Hubbard held a demonstration in Los Angeles' [[Shrine Auditorium]] where he presented a young woman called Sonya Bianca (a pseudonym) to a large audience including many reporters and photographers as 'the world's first [[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]].\"  Despite Hubbard's claim that she had \"full and perfect recall of every moment of her life\", Bianca proved unable to answer questions from the audience testing her memory and analytical abilities, including the question of the color of Hubbard's tie.

Professor [[John A. Lee (professor)|John A.

''Sectarian Healers and Hypnotherapy'', 1970, Ontario</ref>}}\n\nThe [[MEDLINE]] database records two independent scientific studies on Dianetics, both conducted in the 1950s under the auspices of [[New York University]]. Harvey Jay Fischer tested Dianetics therapy against three claims made by proponents and found it does not effect any significant changes in intellectual functioning, mathematical ability, or the degree of personality conflicts;<ref>Fischer, Harvey Jay. \"Dianetic therapy: an experimental evaluation.

''Psychological Newsletter'', New York University. 10 1959, 131-134</ref>\n\nHubbard claimed, in an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' in November 1950, that \"he had already submitted proof of claims made in the book to a number of scientists and associations.\" He added that the public as well as proper organizations were entitled to such proof and that he was ready and willing to give such proof in detail.<ref>\"Psychologists Act Against Dianetics\", New York Times, 9 September 1950</ref> In January 1951, the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation of [[Elizabeth, NJ]] published ''Dianetic Processing: A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results'', a booklet providing the results of psychometric tests conducted on 88 people undergoing Dianetics therapy. It presents case histories and a number of [[X-ray]] plates to support claims that Dianetics had cured \"aberrations\" including [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]], asthma, [[arthritis]], [[colitis]] and \"overt homosexuality,\" and that after Dianetic processing, test subjects experienced significantly increased scores on a standardized IQ test. The report's subjects are not identified by name, but one of them is clearly Hubbard himself (\"Case 1080A, R. L.\").<ref>Benton, Peggy; Ibanex, Dalmyra.; Southon, Gordon; Southon, Peggy. ''Dianetic Processing: A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results'', Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation, 1951</ref>\n\nThe authors provide no qualifications, although they are described in Hubbard's book ''Science of Survival'' (where some results of the same study were reprinted) as psychotherapists. Critics of Dianetics are skeptical of this study, both because of the bias of the source and because the researchers appear to ascribe all physical benefits to Dianetics without considering possible outside factors; in other words, the report lacks any [[scientific control]]s. J.A. Winter, M.D., originally an associate of Hubbard and an early adopter of Dianetics, had by the end of 1950 cut his ties with Hubbard and written an account of his personal experiences with Dianetics. He described Hubbard as \"absolutistic and authoritarian\",<ref name=departure/> and criticized the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for failing to undertake \"precise scientific research into the functioning of the mind\".<ref>Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 40</ref> He also recommended that auditing be done by experts only and that it was dangerous for laymen to audit each other.<ref name=departure>{{cite news | title = Departure in Dianetics | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,821638,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] | date = 3 September 1951 | accessdate = 14 February 2008 }}</ref> Hubbard writes: \"Again, Dianetics is not being released to a profession, for no profession could encompass it.\"<ref>L.

For example, [[philosophy]] professor [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert Carroll]] points to Dianetics' lack of empirical evidence:\n\n{{quote|What Hubbard touts as a science of mind lacks one key element that is expected of a science: empirical testing of claims. The key elements of Hubbard's so-called science don't seem testable, yet he repeatedly claims that he is asserting only scientific facts and data from many experiments. It isn't even clear what such \"data\" would look like. Most of his data is in the form of anecdotes and speculations ... Such speculation is appropriate in fiction, but not in science.<ref>[[Robert Todd Carroll|Carroll, Robert T.]] [http://skepdic.com/dianetic.html \"Dianetics\"], ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]''</ref>}}\n\n[[W. Sumner Davis]] similarly comments that\n\n{{quote|Dianetics is nothing more than an example of pseudoscience trying to legitimize itself ... Hubbard, had he indeed been a scientist, would have known that truth is not built on axioms, and facts cannot be found from some a-priori knowledge. A true science is constructed on [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], which are arrived at by the virtue of observed phenomena. Scientific knowledge is gained by observation and testing, not believing from some [[subconscious]] stipulation, as Hubbard would have us believe.<ref>Davis, W. Sumner. ''Just Smoke and Mirrors: Religion, Fear and Superstition in Our Modern World'', Writers Club Press, 2001 ({{ISBN|0-595-26523-5}})</ref>}}\n\nThe validity and practice of auditing have been questioned by a variety of non-Scientologist commentators. Commenting on the example cited by Winter, the science writer [[Martin Gardner]] asserts that \"nothing could be clearer from the above dialogue than the fact that the dianetic explanation for the headache existed only in the mind of the therapist, and that it was with considerable difficulty that the patient was maneuvered into accepting it.\"<ref>Gardner, Martin. '' Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science''. Dover, 1957</ref>\n\nOther critics and medical experts have suggested that Dianetic auditing is a form of [[hypnosis]],<ref>\"Never believe a hypnotist - An investigation of L.

Ron Hubbard, p. 461 (2007 edition).</ref> Winter [1950] comments that the leading nature of the questions asked of a pre-Clear \"encourage fantasy\", a common issue also encountered with hypnosis, which can be used to form [[confabulation|false memories]]. The auditor is instructed not to make any assessment of a recalled memory's reality or accuracy, but instead to treat it as if it were objectively real. Professor [[Richard Ofshe|Richard J.

Data marts are often built and controlled by a single department within an organization. The sources could be internal operational systems, a central data warehouse, or external data.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docs.oracle.com/html/E10312_01/dm_concepts.htm |title=Data Mart Concepts |publisher=Oracle |year=2007}}</ref> Denormalization is the norm for data modeling techniques in this system. Given that data marts generally cover only a subset of the data contained in a data warehouse, they are often easier and faster to implement.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Difference between data warehouse and {{nowrap|data mart}}\n|-\n!

Queries are often very complex and involve aggregations. For OLAP systems, response time is an effectiveness measure. OLAP applications are widely used by [[Data Mining]] techniques. OLAP databases store aggregated, historical data in multi-dimensional schemas (usually [[star schema]]s). OLAP systems typically have data latency of a few hours, as opposed to data marts, where latency is expected to be closer to one day. The OLAP approach is used to analyze multidimensional data from multiple sources and perspectives. The three basic operations in OLAP are : Roll-up (Consolidation), Drill-down and Slicing & Dicing.\n\n[[Online transaction processing]] (OLTP) is characterized by a large number of short on-line transactions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). OLTP systems emphasize very fast query processing and maintaining [[data integrity]] in multi-access environments. For OLTP systems, effectiveness is measured by the number of transactions per second. OLTP databases contain detailed and current data. The schema used to store transactional databases is the entity model (usually [[Third normal form|3NF]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://datawarehouse4u.info/OLTP-vs-OLAP.html |title=OLTP vs. OLAP |year=2009 |website=Datawarehouse4u.Info |quote=We can divide IT systems into transactional (OLTP) and analytical (OLAP). In general we can assume that OLTP systems provide source data to data warehouses, whereas OLAP systems help to analyze it.}}</ref> Normalization is the norm for data modeling techniques in this system.\n\n[[Predictive analytics]] is about [[pattern recognition|finding]] and quantifying hidden patterns in the data using complex mathematical models that can be used to [[prediction|predict]] future outcomes. Predictive analysis is different from OLAP in that OLAP focuses on historical data analysis and is reactive in nature, while predictive analysis focuses on the future. These systems are also used for [[customer relationship management]] (CRM).\n\n==History==\nThe concept of data warehousing dates back to the late 1980s<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/databasetopics/data/story/0,10801,70102,00.html |title=The Story So Far |date=2002-04-15 |accessdate=2008-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708182105/http://www.computerworld.com/databasetopics/data/story/0%2C10801%2C70102%2C00.html |archivedate=2008-07-08 |df= }}</ref> when IBM researchers Barry Devlin and Paul Murphy developed the \"business data warehouse\". In essence, the data warehousing concept was intended to provide an architectural model for the flow of data from operational systems to [[decision support system|decision support environments]]. The concept attempted to address the various problems associated with this flow, mainly the high costs associated with it. In the absence of a data warehousing architecture, an enormous amount of redundancy was required to support multiple decision support environments. In larger corporations, it was typical for multiple decision support environments to operate independently. Though each environment served different users, they often required much of the same stored data. The process of gathering, cleaning and integrating data from various sources, usually from long-term existing operational systems (usually referred to as [[legacy system]]s), was typically in part replicated for each environment. Moreover, the operational systems were frequently reexamined as new decision support requirements emerged. Often new requirements necessitated gathering, cleaning and integrating new data from \"[[data mart]]s\" that was tailored for ready access by users.\n\nKey developments in early years of data warehousing were:\n\n* 1960s \u2013 [[General Mills]] and [[Dartmouth College]], in a joint research project, develop the terms ''dimensions'' and ''facts''.<ref name=\"kimball16\">Kimball 2002, pg. 16</ref>\n* 1970s \u2013 [[ACNielsen]] and IRI provide dimensional data marts for retail sales.<ref name=\"kimball16\" />\n* 1970s \u2013 [[Bill Inmon]] begins to define and discuss the term: Data Warehouse.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n* 1975 \u2013 [[Sperry Univac]] introduces [[MAPPER]] (MAintain, Prepare, and Produce Executive Reports) is a database management and reporting system that includes the world's first [[Fourth-generation programming language|4GL]].

Textual disambiguation applies context to raw text and reformats the raw text and context into a standard data base format. Once raw text is passed through textual disambiguation, it can easily and efficiently be accessed and analyzed by standard business intelligence technology. Textual disambiguation is accomplished through the execution of textual ETL. Textual disambiguation is useful wherever raw text is found, such as in documents, Hadoop, email, and so forth.\n\n==Information storage==\n\n===Facts===\nA fact is a value or measurement, which represents a fact about the managed entity or system.\n\nFacts, as reported by the reporting entity, are said to be at raw level. E.g. in a mobile telephone system, if a BTS ([[base transceiver station]]) received 1,000 requests for traffic channel allocation, it allocates for 820, and rejects the remaining, it would report three '''facts''' or measurements to a management system:\n* tch_req_total = 1000\n* tch_req_success = 820\n* tch_req_fail = 180\n\nFacts at the raw level are further aggregated to higher levels in various [[Dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]] to extract more service or business-relevant information from it. These are called aggregates or summaries or aggregated facts.\n\nFor instance, if there are three BTS in a city, then the facts above can be aggregated from the BTS to the city level in the network dimension. For example:\n\n* tch_req_success_city = tch_req_success_bts1 + tch_req_success_bts2 + tch_req_success_bts3\n* avg_tch_req_success_city = (tch_req_success_bts1 + tch_req_success_bts2 + tch_req_success_bts3) / 3\n\n===Dimensional versus normalized approach for storage of data===\nThere are three or more leading approaches to storing data in a data warehouse&nbsp;\u2014 the most important approaches are the dimensional approach and the normalized approach.\n\n====Dimensional approach====\nThe dimensional approach refers to [[Ralph Kimball]]'s approach in which it is stated that the data warehouse should be modeled using a Dimensional Model/[[star schema]]. The normalized approach, also called the [[Third normal form|3NF]] model (Third Normal Form) refers to Bill Inmon's approach in which it is stated that the data warehouse should be modeled using an E-R model/normalized model.\n\nIn a [[Star schema|dimensional approach]], [[transaction data]] are partitioned into \"facts\", which are generally numeric transaction data, and \"[[dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]]\", which are the reference information that gives context to the facts. For example, a sales transaction can be broken up into facts such as the number of products ordered and the total price paid for the products, and into dimensions such as order date, customer name, product number, order ship-to and bill-to locations, and salesperson responsible for receiving the order.\n\nA key advantage of a dimensional approach is that the data warehouse is easier for the user to understand and to use. Also, the retrieval of data from the data warehouse tends to operate very quickly.<ref name=\":0\" /> Dimensional structures are easy to understand for business users, because the structure is divided into measurements/facts and context/dimensions. Facts are related to the organization's business processes and operational system whereas the dimensions surrounding them contain context about the measurement (Kimball, Ralph 2008). Another advantage offered by dimensional model is that it does not involve a relational database every time. Thus, this type of modeling technique is very useful for end-user queries in data warehouse.\n\nThe model of facts and dimensions can also be understood as [http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~dbd/cs831/notes/dcubes/dcubes.html data cube]. Where the dimensions are the categorical coordinates in a multi-dimensional cube, while the fact is a value corresponding to the coordinates.\n\nThe main disadvantages of the dimensional approach are the following:\n# To maintain the integrity of facts and dimensions, loading the data warehouse with data from different operational systems is complicated.\n# It is difficult to modify the data warehouse structure if the organization adopting the dimensional approach changes the way in which it does business.\n\n====Normalized approach====\nIn the normalized approach, the data in the data warehouse are stored following, to a degree, [[database normalization]] rules. Tables are grouped together by ''subject areas'' that reflect general data categories (e.g., data on customers, products, finance, etc.). The normalized structure divides data into entities, which creates several tables in a relational database. When applied in large enterprises the result is dozens of tables that are linked together by a web of joins. Furthermore, each of the created entities is converted into separate physical tables when the database is implemented (Kimball, Ralph 2008).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.svrtechnologies.com/datastage-training/data-warehouse-online-training |title=Data Warehouse kimball |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref>\nThe main advantage of this approach is that it is straightforward to add information into the database. Some disadvantages of this approach are that, because of the number of tables involved, it can be difficult for users to join data from different sources into meaningful information and to access the information without a precise understanding of the sources of data and of the [[data structure]] of the data warehouse.\n\nBoth normalized and dimensional models can be represented in entity-relationship diagrams as both contain joined relational tables. The difference between the two models is the degree of normalization (also known as [[Database normalization#Normal forms|Normal Forms]]). These approaches are not mutually exclusive, and there are other approaches. Dimensional approaches can involve normalizing data to a degree (Kimball, Ralph 2008).\n\nIn ''Information-Driven Business'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Hillard|first=Robert|title=Information-Driven Business|year=2010|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-62577-4}}</ref> Robert Hillard proposes an approach to comparing the two approaches based on the information needs of the business problem. The technique shows that normalized models hold far more information than their dimensional equivalents (even when the same fields are used in both models) but this extra information comes at the cost of usability. The technique measures information quantity in terms of [[Entropy (information theory)|information entropy]] and usability in terms of the Small Worlds data transformation measure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mike2.openmethodology.org/wiki/Small_Worlds_Data_Transformation_Measure |title=Information Theory & Business Intelligence Strategy - Small Worlds Data Transformation Measure - MIKE2.0, the open source methodology for Information Development |publisher=Mike2.openmethodology.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref>\n\n==Design methods==\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}\n\n===Bottom-up design===\nIn the ''bottom-up'' approach, [[data mart]]s are first created to provide reporting and analytical capabilities for specific [[business process]]es. These data marts can then be integrated to create a comprehensive data warehouse. The data warehouse bus architecture is primarily an implementation of \"the bus\", a collection of [[Dimension (data warehouse)#Types|conformed dimension]]s and [[Facts (data warehouse)#Types|conformed fact]]s, which are dimensions that are shared (in a specific way) between facts in two or more data marts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://decisionworks.com/2003/09/the-bottom-up-misnomer/|title=The Bottom-Up Misnomer - DecisionWorks Consulting|website=DecisionWorks Consulting|language=en-US|accessdate=2016-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===Top-down design===\nThe ''top-down'' approach is designed using a normalized enterprise [[data model]]. [[Data element|\"Atomic\" data]], that is, data at the greatest level of detail, are stored in the data warehouse. Dimensional data marts containing data needed for specific business processes or specific departments are created from the data warehouse.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Gartner, Of Data Warehouses, Operational Data Stores, Data Marts and Data Outhouses, Dec 2005</ref>\n\n===Hybrid design===\nData warehouses (DW) often resemble the [[hub and spokes architecture]]. [[Legacy system]]s feeding the warehouse often include [[customer relationship management]] and [[enterprise resource planning]], generating large amounts of data. To consolidate these various data models, and facilitate the [[extract transform load]] process, data warehouses often make use of an [[operational data store]], the information from which is parsed into the actual DW. To reduce data redundancy, larger systems often store the data in a normalized way. Data marts for specific reports can then be built on top of the data warehouse.\n\nA hybrid DW database is kept on [[third normal form]] to eliminate [[data redundancy]]. A normal relational database, however, is not efficient for business intelligence reports where dimensional modelling is prevalent. Small data marts can shop for data from the consolidated warehouse and use the filtered, specific data for the fact tables and dimensions required. The DW provides a single source of information from which the data marts can read, providing a wide range of business information. The hybrid architecture allows a DW to be replaced with a [[master data management]] repository where operational, not static information could reside.\n\nThe [[data vault modeling]] components follow hub and spokes architecture. This modeling style is a hybrid design, consisting of the best practices from both third normal form and [[star schema]]. The data vault model is not a true third normal form, and breaks some of its rules, but it is a top-down architecture with a bottom up design. The data vault model is geared to be strictly a data warehouse. It is not geared to be end-user accessible, which when built, still requires the use of a data mart or star schema based release area for business purposes.\n\n==Data warehouse characteristics==\nThere are basic features that define the data in the data warehouse that include subject orientation, data integration, time-variant, nonvolatile data, and data granularity.\n\n===Subject-Oriented===\nUnlike the operational systems, the data in the data warehouse revolves around subjects of the enterprise ([[database normalization]]). Subject orientation can be really useful for decision making.\nGathering the required objects is called subject oriented.\n\n===Integrated===\nThe data found within the data warehouse is integrated. Since it comes from several operational systems, all inconsistencies must be removed. Consistencies include naming conventions, measurement of variables, encoding structures, physical attributes of data, and so forth.\n\n===Time-variant===\nWhile operational systems reflect current values as they support day-to-day operations, data warehouse data represents data over a long time horizon (up to 10 years) which means it stores historical data. It is mainly meant for data mining and forecasting, If a user is searching for a buying pattern of a specific customer, the user needs to look at data on the current and past purchases.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/662453070|title=Data warehousing fundamentals for IT professionals|last=Paulraj.|first=Ponniah,|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|others=Ponniah, Paulraj.|isbn=9780470462072|edition= 2nd |location=Hoboken, N.J.|oclc=662453070}}</ref>\n\n===Nonvolatile===\nThe data in the data warehouse is read-only which means it cannot be updated, created, or deleted.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61762085|title=Building the data warehouse|last=H.|first=Inmon, William|date=2005|publisher=Wiley Pub|isbn=9780764599446|edition= 4th |location=Indianapolis, IN|oclc=61762085}}</ref>\n\n===Summarized===\nIn the data warehouse, data is summarized at different levels.The user may start looking at the total sale units of a product in an entire region. Then the user looks at the states in that region. Finally, they may examine the individual stores in a certain state. Therefore, typically, the analysis starts at a higher level and moves down to lower levels of details.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Data warehouse architecture==\nThe different methods used to construct/organize a data warehouse specified by an organization are numerous. The hardware utilized, software created and data resources specifically required for the correct functionality of a data warehouse are the main components of the data warehouse architecture. All data warehouses have multiple phases in which the requirements of the organization are modified and fine tuned.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=Satinder Bal|last2=Mittal|first2=Aditya|title=Introduction to Database Management System|year=2009|publisher=Laxmi Publications|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Database_Management_Syst.html?id=fyQTae6c9l4C}}</ref>\n\n==Versus operational system==\nOperational systems are optimized for preservation of [[data integrity]] and speed of recording of business transactions through use of [[database normalization]] and an [[entity-relationship model]]. Operational system designers generally follow [[Codd's 12 rules]] of [[database normalization]] to ensure data integrity. Fully normalized database designs (that is, those satisfying all Codd rules) often result in information from a business transaction being stored in dozens to hundreds of tables. [[Relational database]]s are efficient at managing the relationships between these tables. The databases have very fast insert/update performance because only a small amount of data in those tables is affected each time a transaction is processed. To improve performance, older data are usually periodically purged from operational systems.\n\nData warehouses are optimized for analytic access patterns. Analytic access patterns generally involve selecting specific fields and rarely if ever 'select *' as is more common in operational databases. Because of these differences in access patterns, operational databases (loosely, OLTP) benefit from the use of a row-oriented DBMS whereas analytics databases (loosely, OLAP) benefit from the use of a [[column-oriented DBMS]]. Unlike operational systems which maintain a snapshot of the business, data warehouses generally maintain an infinite history which is implemented through ETL processes that periodically migrate data from the operational systems over to the data warehouse.\n\n==Evolution in organization use==\nThese terms refer to the level of sophistication of a data warehouse:\n\n; Offline operational data warehouse: Data warehouses in this stage of evolution are updated on a regular time cycle (usually daily, weekly or monthly) from the operational systems and the data is stored in an integrated reporting-oriented data\n; Offline data warehouse: Data warehouses at this stage are updated from data in the operational systems on a regular basis and the data warehouse data are stored in a data structure designed to facilitate reporting.\n; On time data warehouse: Online Integrated Data Warehousing represent the real time Data warehouses stage data in the warehouse is updated for every transaction performed on the source data\n; Integrated data warehouse: These data warehouses assemble data from different areas of business, so users can look up the information they need across other systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tech-faq.com/data-warehouse.html |title=Data Warehouse }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Thomas H.

According to the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] ([[#References|Ogg, 2004]]), the Devonian extends from the end of the Silurian {{Period end|Silurian}} [[annum|Mya]], to the beginning of the [[Carboniferous]] {{Period start|Carboniferous}} Mya (in [[North America]], the beginning of the [[Mississippian (geology)|Mississippian subperiod]] of the Carboniferous).<ref name=\"ICS 2004\"/>\n\nIn nineteenth-century texts the Devonian has been called the \"Old Red Age\", after the red and brown terrestrial deposits known in the United Kingdom as the [[Old Red Sandstone]] in which early fossil discoveries were found. Another common term is \"Age of the Fishes\",<ref>[http://www.ageoffishes.org.au Age of Fishes Museum]</ref> referring to the evolution of several major groups of [[fish]] that took place during the period. Older literature on the Anglo-Welsh basin divides it into the Downtonian, Dittonian, Breconian and Farlovian stages, the latter three of which are placed in the Devonian.<ref>Barclay, W.J. 1989. ''Geology of the South Wales Coalfield Pt II, the country around Abergavenny'', 3rd edn. Memoir of the British Geological Survey Sheet 232 (Eng & Wales) pp18-19</ref>\n\nThe Devonian has also erroneously been characterised as a \"greenhouse age\", due to [[sampling bias]]: most of the early Devonian-age discoveries came from the [[stratum|strata]] of [[western Europe]] and eastern [[North America]], which at the time straddled the [[Equator]] as part of the supercontinent of Euramerica where [[fossil]] signatures of widespread reefs indicate tropical [[climate]]s that were warm and moderately humid but in fact the climate in the Devonian differed greatly during its [[geologic time scale|epochs]] and between geographic regions. For example, during the Early Devonian, arid conditions were prevalent through much of the world including Siberia, Australia, North America, and China, but Africa and [[South America]] had a warm [[temperate climate]]. In the Late Devonian, by contrast, arid conditions were less prevalent across the world and [[temperate climate]]s were more common.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Subdivisions{{anchor|subdivisions}}==\nThe Devonian Period is formally broken into Early, Middle and Late subdivisions. The rocks corresponding to those [[series (stratigraphy)|epoch]]s are referred to as belonging to the Lower, Middle and Upper parts of the Devonian System.\n\n;Early Devonian\nThe Early Devonian lasted from {{period span|Early devonian}} and began with the [[Lochkovian]] stage, which lasted until the [[Pragian]]. It spanned from {{period span|Pragian}}, and was followed by the [[Emsian]], which lasted until the Middle Devonian began, {{ma|middle devonian|error=show}}.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  \nDuring this time, the first [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]] appeared, descending from [[Bactritida|bactritoid]] [[Nautiloidea|nautiloids]]. Ammonoids during this time period were simple and differed little from their nautiloid counterparts. These ammonoids belong to the order [[Agoniatitida]], which in later epochs evolved to new ammonoid orders, for example [[Goniatite|Goniatitida]] and [[Clymeniida]]. This class of [[cephalopod]] molluscs would dominate the marine fauna until the beginning of the [[Mesozoic]] era.\n\n;Middle Devonian\nThe Middle Devonian comprised two subdivisions: first the [[Eifelian]], which then gave way to the [[Givetian]] {{Mya|Givetian|error=show}}.\nDuring this time the jawless [[agnathan]] fishes began to decline in diversity in freshwater and marine environments partly due to drastic environmental changes and partly due to the increasing competition, predation and diversity of [[gnathostomata|jawed fishes]]. The shallow, warm, oxygen-depleted waters of Devonian inland lakes, surrounded by primitive plants, provided the environment necessary for certain early fish to develop such essential characteristics as well developed lungs, and the ability to crawl out of the water and onto the land for short periods of time.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n;Late Devonian\nFinally, the Late Devonian started with the [[Frasnian]], {{period span|Frasnian}}, during which the first forests took shape on land. The first tetrapods appeared in the fossil record in the ensuing [[Famennian]] subdivision, the beginning and end of which are marked with extinction events. This lasted until the end of the Devonian, {{Mya|Carboniferous|error=show}}.{{citation needed|reason=these values differ from those published by the International Commission of Stratigraphy|date=May 2014}}\n\n==Climate==\nThe Devonian was a relatively warm period, and probably lacked any [[glacier]]s. The temperature gradient from the equator to the poles was not as large as it is today. The weather was also very arid, mostly along the equator where it was the driest.<ref name=Joachimskia2009/> Reconstruction of tropical sea surface temperature from [[conodont]] [[apatite]] implies an average value of {{convert|30|C|4=0|abbr=on}} in the Early Devonian.<ref name=Joachimskia2009/> {{Co2}} levels dropped steeply throughout the Devonian period as the burial of the newly evolved forests drew carbon out of the atmosphere into sediments; this may be reflected by a Mid-Devonian cooling of around {{convert|5|C-change|4=0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Joachimskia2009/> The Late Devonian warmed to levels equivalent to the Early Devonian; while there is no corresponding increase in {{co2}} concentrations, continental weathering increases (as predicted by warmer temperatures); further, a range of evidence, such as plant distribution, points to a Late Devonian warming.<ref name=Joachimskia2009>{{Cite journal| first1 = M.

Marine faunas continued to be dominated by [[bryozoa]], diverse and abundant [[brachiopod]]s, the enigmatic [[hederellid]]s, [[microconchida|microconchids]] and [[coral]]s. Lily-like [[crinoid]]s (animals, their resemblance to flowers notwithstanding) were abundant, and [[trilobite]]s were still fairly common. Among vertebrates, jawless armored fish ([[ostracoderm]]s) declined in diversity, while the jawed fish (gnathostomes) simultaneously increased in both the sea and [[fresh water]]. Armored placoderms were numerous during the lower stages of the Devonian Period and became extinct in the Late Devonian, perhaps because of competition for food against the other fish species. Early cartilaginous ([[Chondrichthyes]]) and bony fishes ([[Osteichthyes]]) also become diverse and played a large role within the Devonian seas. The first abundant genus of shark, ''[[Cladoselache]]'', appeared in the oceans during the Devonian Period. The great diversity of fish around at the time has led to the Devonian being given the name \"The Age of Fish\" in popular culture.\n\nThe first ammonites also appeared during or slightly before the early Devonian Period around 400 Mya.<ref>[http://www.palaeos.com/Paleozoic/Devonian/Devonian.2.htm#Life Palaeos Paleozoic: Devonian: The Devonian Period - 2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Reefs===\nA now dry barrier reef, located in present-day [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley Basin]] of northwest [[Australia]], once extended a thousand kilometres, fringing a Devonian continent.

A second strong pulse closed the Devonian period. The Late Devonian extinction was one of five major extinction events in the history of the Earth's biota, and was more drastic than the familiar extinction event that closed the Cretaceous.\n\nThe Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group to be affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef systems.\n\nAmongst the severely affected marine groups were the brachiopods, trilobites, ammonites, [[conodont]]s, and [[acritarch]]s, as well as [[agnatha|jawless fish]], and all placoderms. Land plants as well as freshwater species, such as our tetrapod ancestors, were relatively unaffected by the Late Devonian extinction event (there is a counterargument that the Devonian extinctions nearly wiped out the tetrapods<ref>McGhee, George R. (2013). When the Invasion of Land Failed.

When Thompson was two, his father died. Due to the financial hardship with his mother without resources, Thompson and his older brother were placed in the [[Grey Coat Hospital]], a school for the disadvantaged of Westminster.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/people/explorers/david-thompson |title=David Thompson |publisher=Hudson's Bay Company History Foundation |access-date=9 January 2013}}</ref> Thompson graduated to the Grey Coat mathematical school, where he was introduced to basic navigation skills. He later built on these to make his career. In 1784, at the age of 14, he entered a seven-year apprenticeship with the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. He set sail on 28 May of that year, and left England for North America.<ref name=\"vanherk\">{{cite magazine |url=https://secure.indas.on.ca/canadiangeo/store/index.php?site=default&feature=CG-200704|first=Aritha |last=Van Herk |title=Travels with Charlotte |website=canadiangeographic.ca|publisher=Canadian Geographic Magazine |year=2007|series=July/August|subscription=yes|access-date=March 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Hudson's Bay Company (HBC)==\nThompson arrived in [[Churchill, Manitoba|Churchill]] (now in [[Manitoba]]) and was put to work as a secretary, copying the personal papers of the governor of Fort Churchill, [[Samuel Hearne]]. The next year he was transferred to nearby [[York Factory, Manitoba|York Factory]], and over the next few years spent time as a secretary at [[Cumberland House, Saskatchewan]], and [[South Branch House]] before arriving at [[Manchester House]] in 1787. During those years he learned to keep accounts and other records, calculate values of furs (It was noted that he also had several expensive beaver pelts at that time even when a secretary's job would not pay terribly well), track supplies and other duties.\n\nOn 23 December 1788, Thompson seriously fractured his leg, forcing him to spend the next two winters at Cumberland House convalescing. It was during this time that he greatly refined and expanded his mathematical, astronomical, and surveying skills under the tutelage of Hudson's Bay Company surveyor [[Philip Turnor]]. It was also during this time that he lost sight in his right eye.<ref name=\"gottfred\">J. & A. Gottfred, \"Art. I. The Life of David Thompson\"</ref>\n\nIn 1790, with his apprenticeship nearing its end, Thompson requested a set of surveying tools in place of the typical parting gift of fine clothes offered by the company to those completing their indenture. He received both. He entered the employ of the Hudson's Bay Company as a [[fur trader]]. In 1792 he completed his first significant survey, mapping a route to [[Lake Athabasca]] (where today's [[Alberta]]/[[Saskatchewan]] border is located). In recognition of his map-making skills, the company promoted Thompson to surveyor in 1794. He continued working for the Hudson's Bay Company until 23 May 1797 when, frustrated with the Hudson's Bay Company's policies over promoting the use of alcohol with indigenous people in the fur trade, he left. He walked {{convert|80|mi|km|order=flip}} in the snow in order to enter the employ of the competition, the [[North West Company]]. There he continued to work as a [[fur trader]] and surveyor.\n\n==North West Company==\n[[File:David Thompson (explorer).jpg|thumb|200px|An artist's impression of Thompson based on historical accounts]]Thompson's decision to defect to the [[North West Company]] in 1797 without providing the customary one-year notice was not well received by his former employers. But the North West Company was more supportive of Thompson pursuing his interest in surveying and work on mapping the interior of what was to become Canada, as they judged it in the company's long-term interest. In 1797, Thompson was sent south by his employers to survey part of the Canada-US boundary along the water routes from [[Lake Superior]] to [[Lake of the Woods]] to satisfy unresolved questions of territory arising from the [[Jay Treaty]] between Great Britain and the United States after the American Revolutionary War.\n\nBy 1798 Thompson had completed a survey of {{convert|6750|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Grand Portage]], through [[Lake Winnipeg]], to the [[River source|headwaters]] of the [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers, as well as two sides of [[Lake Superior]].<ref name=\"vanherk\"/> In 1798, the company sent him to Red Deer Lake ([[Lac la Biche (Alberta)|Lac La Biche]] in present-day Alberta) to establish a trading post. (The English translation of Lac la Biche: Red Deer Lake, was first recorded on the Mackenzie map of 1793.)<ref name=AlbertaAtlas>{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.ualberta.ca/Projects/Alberta-Lakes/view/?region=Peace%20and%20Athabasca%20Region&basin=Athabasca%20River%20Basin&lake=Lac%20La%20Biche&number=1|publisher=University of Alberta|location=Edmonton, Alberta|title=Lac La Biche|series=Atlas of Alberta Lakes|year=2004|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610064531/http://sunsite.ualberta.ca/Projects/Alberta-Lakes/view/?region=Peace%20and%20Athabasca%20Region&basin=Athabasca%20River%20Basin&lake=Lac%20La%20Biche&number=1|archive-date=10 June 2015|access-date=March 27, 2018}}</ref> Thompson spent the next few seasons trading based in [[Buckingham House (fur-trade post)#Fort George|Fort George]] (now in Alberta), and during this time led several expeditions into the [[Rocky Mountains]].\n\nIn 1804, at the annual meeting of the North West Company in [[Fort Kaministiquia|Kaministiquia]], Thompson was made a full partner of the company. He spent the next few seasons based there managing the fur trading operations but still finding time to expand his surveys of the waterways around Lake Superior. At the 1806 company meeting, officers decided to send Thompson back out into the interior. Concern over the American-backed expedition of [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]] prompted the North West Company to charge Thompson with the task of finding a route to the Pacific to open up the lucrative trading territories of the [[Pacific Northwest]].\n\n==Columbia River travels==\nAfter the general meeting in 1806, Thompson travelled to [[Rocky Mountain House]] and prepared for an expedition to follow the [[Columbia River]] to the Pacific. In June 1807 Thompson crossed the Rocky Mountains and spent the summer surveying the [[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia basin]]; he continued to survey the area over the next few seasons. Thompson mapped and established trading posts in Northwestern [[Montana]], [[Idaho]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Western Canada]]. Trading posts he founded included [[Kootenae House]], [[Kullyspell House]] and [[Saleesh House]]; the latter two were the first trading posts west of the Rockies in Idaho and Montana, respectively.<ref name=\"gottfred\"/> These posts established by Thompson extended North West Company fur trading territory into the Columbia Basin drainage area. The maps he made of the Columbia River basin east of the [[Cascade Mountains]] were of such high quality and detail that they continued to be regarded as authoritative well into the mid-20th century. [[File:Columbiarivermap.png|thumb|400px|David Thompson navigated the entire length of Columbia River in 1811. This map of the Columbia and its tributaries shows modern political boundaries.]]\n\nIn early 1810, Thompson was returning eastward toward [[Montreal]] but, while en route at [[Rainy Lake]], received orders to return to the Rocky Mountains and establish a route to the mouth of the Columbia. The North West Company was responding to the plans of American [[John Jacob Astor]] to send a ship around the Americas to establish a fur trading post of the Pacific Fur Company on the Pacific Coast. During his return, Thompson was delayed by an angry group of [[Northern Peigan|Peigan]] natives at [[Howse Pass]]. He was ultimately forced to seek a new route across the [[Rocky Mountains]] and found one through the [[Athabasca Pass]].\n\nDavid Thompson was the first European to navigate the full length of the Columbia River. During Thompson's 1811 voyage down the Columbia River, he camped at the junction with the [[Snake River]] on 9 July 1811. There he erected a pole and a notice claiming the country for Great Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a [[trading post]] at the site. This notice was found later that year by Astor company workers looking to establish an inland fur post, contributing to their selection of a more northerly site at [[Fort Okanogan]]. The North West Company established its post of [[Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s]] near the Snake River confluence several years later. Continuing down the Columbia, Thompson passed the barrier of [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]] with much less difficulty than that undergone by [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]], as high water carried his boat over [[Celilo Falls]] and many of the rapids. On 14 July 1811, Thompson reached the partially constructed [[Fort Astoria]] at the mouth of the Columbia, arriving two months after the [[Pacific Fur Company]]'s ship, the ''[[Tonquin (1807)|Tonquin]]''.<ref>{{cite book| last = Meinig| first = D.W.| authorlink = D.W.

Naukane, known as Coxe to Thompson, accompanied Thompson across the continent to [[Lake Superior]] before journeying on to England.\n\nThompson wintered at Saleesh House before beginning his final journey back to Montreal in 1812, where the North West Company was based.\n\nIn his published journals, Thompson recorded seeing large footprints near what is now [[Jasper, Alberta]], in 1811. It has been suggested that these prints were similar to what has since been called the [[sasquatch]]. However, Thompson noted that these tracks showed \"a small Nail at the end of each [toe]\", and stated that these tracks \"very much resembles a large Bear's Track\".<ref>Thompson, David.

[[William McGillivray]] at his home, Chateau St. Antoine, one of the early estates in [[Montreal]]'s [[Golden Square Mile]]. He describes the party and some of the guests in his entertaining book ''The Shoe and Canoe'', giving an excellent description of David Thompson:\n\n{{quote|text=I was well placed at table between one of the Miss McGillivray's and a singular-looking person of about fifty. He was plainly dressed, quiet, and observant. His figure was short and compact, and his black hair was worn long all round, and cut square, as if by one stroke of the shears, just above the eyebrows. His complexion was of the gardener's ruddy brown, while the expression of his deeply-furrowed features was friendly and intelligent, but his cut-short nose gave him an odd look. His speech betrayed the [[Wales|Welshman]], although he left his native hills when very young.

He and Charlotte had 13 children together{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}; five of them were born before he left the fur trade. The family did not adjust easily to life in [[Eastern Canada]]; they lived in Montreal while he was traveling. Two of the children, John (aged 5) and Emma (aged 7), died of [[Ascariasis|round worms]], a common parasite.<ref name=\"vanherk\"/> By the time of Thompson's death, the couple had been married 57 years, the longest marriage known in Canada pre-[[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].<ref name=\"vanherk\"/>\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:1814ThompsonMap.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the North-West Territory of the Province of Canada, stretching from the [[Fraser River]] on the west to [[Lake Superior]] on the east. By David Thompson, 1814.]]\nUpon his arrival back in Montreal, Thompson retired with a generous pension from the North West Company. He settled in nearby [[Terrebonne, Quebec|Terrebonne]] and worked on completing his great map, a summary of his lifetime of exploring and surveying the interior of North America. The map covered the wide area stretching from Lake Superior to the Pacific, and was given by Thompson to the North West Company. Thompson's 1814 map, his greatest achievement, was so accurate that 100 years later it was still the basis for many of the maps issued by the Canadian government. It now resides in the [[Archives of Ontario]].<ref>[https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/exhibits/thompson/records.htm{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} David Thompson Records Held by the [[Archives of Ontario]]</ref>\n\nIn 1815, Thompson moved his family to [[Williamstown, Ontario|Williamstown, Upper Canada]], and a few years later was employed to survey the newly established borders with the United States from Lake of the Woods to the [[Eastern Townships]] of [[Quebec]], established by [[Treaty of Ghent]] after the [[War of 1812]]. In 1843 Thompson completed his atlas of the region from [[Hudson Bay]] to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAfterwards, Thompson returned to a life as a land owner, but soon financial misfortune would ruin him. By 1831 he was so deeply in debt he was forced to take up a position as a surveyor for the British American Land Company to provide for his family. His luck continued to worsen and he was forced to move in with his daughter and son-in-law in 1845. He began work on a manuscript chronicling his life exploring the continent, but this project was left unfinished when his sight failed him completely in 1851.\n\n==Death and afterward==\n[[File:Stamp-Thompson-1957.jpg|thumb|250px|right|upright|Postage stamp commemorating David Thompson's life]]\nThe land mass mapped by Thompson amounted to {{convert|3.9|e6km2|e6sqmi|abbr=off}} of wilderness (one-fifth of the continent).

Within the monocots Dioscoreales are grouped in the [[lilioid monocots]] where they are in a [[sister group]] relationship with the [[Pandanales]]. Of necessity the Dioscoreales contain the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Dioscoreaceae]] which includes the [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] (''[[Dioscorea]]'') that is used as an important food source in many regions around the globe. Older systems tended to place all lilioid monocots with [[reticulate veined]] leaves (such as [[Smilacaceae]] and [[Stemonaceae]] together with Dioscoraceae) in Dioscoreales. As currently [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscribed]] by [[phylogenetic analysis]] using combined [[plant morphology|morphology]] and [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] methods, Dioscreales contains many reticulate veined [[vines]] in Dioscoraceae, it also includes the [[myco-heterotrophic]] [[Burmanniaceae]] and the [[autotrophic]] [[Nartheciaceae]]. The order consists of three families, 22 [[genera]] and about 850 [[species]].\n\n==Description==\nDioscoreales are [[vines]] or [[herbaceous]] forest floor  plants. They may be [[achlorophyllous]] or [[saprophytic]]. [[Synapomorphies]] include tuberous roots, glandular hairs, [[seed coat]] characteristics and the presence of [[calcium oxalate]] [[crystals]].{{sfn|Caddick et al|2002a}} Other characteristics of the order include the presence of [[saponin]] [[steroids]], annular [[vascular bundles]] that are found in both the [[Plant stem|stem]] and [[leaf]]. The leaves are often unsheathed at the base, have a distinctive [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] and [[reticulate veined]] lamina. Alternatively they may be small and scale-like with a sheathed base. The [[flowers]] are [[actinomorphic]], and may be [[Plant reproductive morphology|bisexual]] or [[dioecious]], while the flowers or [[inflorescence]] bear glandular hairs. The [[perianth]] may be conspicuous or reduced and the [[stigma (botany)#Style|style]] is short with well developed style branches. The [[tepals]] persist in the development of the [[fruit]], which is a dry [[capsule (botany)|capsule]] or [[berry]]. In the seed, the [[seed#seed coat|endotegmen]]  is [[tannin|tanniferous]] and the [[embryo#Plant embryos|embryo]] short.<ref name=apwdioscoreales/>\n\nAll of the species except the genera placed in [[Nartheciaceae]] express simultaneous [[microsporogenesis]]. Plants in [[Nartheciaceae]] show successive [[microsporogenesis]] which is one of the traits indicating that the family is sister to all the other members included in the order.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n=== Pre-Darwinian ===\nFor the early history from [[John Lindley|Lindley]] (1853){{sfn|Lindley|1853}} onwards, see Caddick ''et al.'' (2000) Table 1,{{sfn|Caddick et al|2000}} Caddick et al. (2002a) Table 1{{sfn|Caddick et al|2002a}} and Table 2 in Bouman (1995).{{sfn|Bouman|1995}} The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] classification of Dioscoreales has been complicated by the presence of a number of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] features reminiscent of the [[dicotyledons]], leading some authors to place the order as intermediate between the monocotyledons and the dicotyledons.{{sfn|Bouman|1995}}\n\n[[File:Dioscorea - Hooker.jpg|thumb|Male ''Dioscorea batatas'' ([[Dioscorea polystachya|''D. polystachya'']]) in Hooker's ''A General System of Botany'' 1873 ]]\nWhile Lindley did not use the term \"Dioscoreales\", he placed the family Dioscoraceae together with four other families in what he referred to as an Alliance (the equivalent of the modern Order) called Dictyogens. He reflected the uncertainty as to the place of this Alliance by placing it as a class of its own between Endogens (monocots) and Exogens (dicots)<ref name=Lindleydictyogens/> The [[botanical authority]] is given to [[von Martius]] (1835) by APG for his description of the Dioscoreae family or ''Ordo'',<ref name=martius/> while other sources<ref name=taxonomicon/> cite Hooker (Dioscoreales [[Hook.f.]]) for his use of the term \"Dioscorales\" in 1873<ref name=hooker/> with a single family, Dioscoreae.<ref name=hookerdioscoreae/> However, in his more definitive work, the ''Genera plantara'' (1883), he simply placed Dioscoraceae in the Epigynae \"Series\".<ref name=bhdiosc/>\n\n===Post-Darwinian===\nAlthough [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Origin of Species]] (1859) preceded Bentham and Hooker's publication, the latter project was commenced much earlier and [[George Bentham]] was initially sceptical of [[Darwinism]].<ref name=Stuessy/> The new [[phyletic]] approach changed the way that taxonomists considered plant classification, incorporating [[evolutionary]] information into their schemata, but this did little to further define the [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of Dioscoreaceae. The major works in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century employing this approach were in the [[German language|German]] literature. Authors such as [[August Eichler|Eichler]],<ref name=Eichler/> [[Adolf Engler|Engler]]<ref name=Engler/> and [[Richard Wettstein|Wettstein]]<ref name=Wettstein/>  placed this family in the [[Liliiflorae]], a major subdivision of monocotyledons. it remained to [[John Hutchinson (botanist)|Hutchinson]] (1926){{sfn|Hutchinson|1959}} to resurrect the Dioscoreales to group Dioscoreaceae and related families together. Hutchinson's circumscription of Dioscoreales included three other families in addition to Dioscoreaceae, [[Stenomeridaceae]], [[Trichopodaceae]] and [[Roxburghiaceae]]. Of these only Trichopodaceae was included in the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] (APG) classification (see below), but was subsumed into Dioscoraceae. Stenomeridaceae, as ''[[Stenomeris]]'' was also included in Dioscoreaceae as subfamily Stenomeridoideae, the remaining genera being grouped in [[subfamily]] Dioscoreoideae.{{sfn|Bouman|1995}} Roxburghiaceae on the other hand was segregated in the [[sister group|sister order]] [[Pandanales]] as [[Stemonaceae]]. Most taxonomists in the twentieth century (the exception was the 1981 [[Cronquist system]] which  placed most such plants in order [[Liliales]], subclass [[Liliidae]], class [[Liliopsida]]=monocotyledons, division [[Magnoliophyta]]=angiosperms) recognised Dioscoreales as a distinct order, but demonstrated wide variations in its composition.{{sfn|Caddick et al|2002a}}{{sfn|Bouman|1995}}\n\n[[Rolf Dahlgren|Dahlgren]], in the second version of his taxonomic classifiacation (1982){{sfn|Dahlgren|Clifford|1982}} raised the Liliiflorae to a [[superorder]] and placed Dioscoreales as an order within it. In [[Dahlgren system|his system]], Dioscoreales contained only three families, Dioscoreaceae, [[Stemonaceae]] (''i.e.'' Hutchinson's Roxburghiaceae) and [[Trilliaceae]]. The latter two families had been treated as a separate order ([[Stemonales]], or Roxburghiales) by other authors, such as [[Herbert Huber (botanist)|Huber]] (1969).{{sfn|Huber|1969}} The APG would later assign these to Pandanales and [[Liliales]] respectively. Dahlgren's construction of Dioscoreaceae included the Stenomeridaceae and Trichopodaceae, doubting these were distinct, and Croomiaceae in Stemonaceae. Furthermore, he expressed doubts about the order's homogeneity, especially Trilliaceae. The Dioscoreales at that time were marginally distinguishable from the [[Asparagales]]. In his examination of Huber's Stemonales, he found that the two constituent families had as close an affinity to Dioscoreaceae as to each other, and hence included them. He also considered closely related families and their relationship to Dioscoreales, such as the [[monogeneric]] Taccaceae, then in its own order, Taccales. Similar considerations were discussed with respect to two Asparagales families, Smilacaceae and Petermanniaceae.{{sfn|Dahlgren|Clifford|1982}}\n\nIn Dahlgren's third and final version (1985){{sfn|Dahlgren|Clifford|Yeo|1985}} that broader circumscription of Dioscoreales was created within the superorder [[Lilianae]], subclass [[Liliidae]] (monocotyledons), class [[Magnoliopsida]] (angiosperms) and comprised the seven families [[Dioscoreaceae]], [[Petermanniaceae]], [[Smilacaceae]], [[Stemonaceae]], [[Taccaceae]], [[Trichopodaceae]] and [[Trilliaceae]]. [[Thismiaceae]] has either been treated as a separate family closely related to [[Burmanniaceae]] or as a [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] (Thismieae) within a more broadly defined Burmanniaceae, forming a separate [[Burmanniales]] order in the Dahlgren system.{{sfn|Merckx|Smets|2014}} The related [[Nartheciaceae]] were treated as tribe Narthecieae within the [[Melanthiaceae]] in a third order, the [[Melanthiales]], by Dahlgren.{{sfn|Dahlgren|Clifford|Yeo|1985}} Dahlgren considered the Dioscoreales to most strongly resemble the ancestral monocotyledons, and hence sharing \"dicotyledonous\" characteristics, making it the most central monocotyledon order.{{sfn|Bouman|1995}} Of these seven families, Bouman considered Dioscoreaceae, Trichopodaceae, Stemonaceae and Taccaceae to represent the \"core\" families of the order. However, that study also indicated both a clear delineation of the order from other orders particularly Asparagales, and a lack of homogeneity within the order.{{sfn|Bouman|1995}}\n\n=== Molecular phylogenetics and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group ===\nThe increasing availability of [[molecular phylogenetics]] methods in addition to mophological characteristics in the 1990s led to major reconsiderations of the relationships within the monocotyledons.{{sfn|Chase et al|1993}} In that large multi-institutional examination of the [[seed plants]] using the [[plastid]] [[gene]] [[Rubisco|''rbc''L]] the authors used [[Dahlgren's system]] as their basis, but followed [[Robert F Thorne|Thorne]] (1992){{sfn|Thorne|1992}} in altering the [[suffixes]] of the superorders from \"''-iflorae''\" to \"''-anae''\".{{efn|name=suffix}} This demonstrated that the Lilianae comprised three lineages corresponding to Dahlgren's\nDioscoreales, Liliales, and Asparagales orders.\n\nUnder the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] [[APG system|system]] of 1998,{{sfn|APG I|1998}} which took Dahlgren's system as a basis, the order was placed in the [[monocot]] [[clade]]  and comprised the five families [[Burmanniaceae]], Dioscoreaceae, Taccaceae, [[Thismiaceae]] and Trichopodaceae.\n\nIn [[APG II]] (2003),{{sfn|APG II|2003}} a number of changes were made to Dioscoreales, as a result of an extensive study by Caddick and colleagues (2002),{{sfn|Caddick et al|2002a}}{{sfn|Caddick et al|2002b}} using an analysis of three [[genes]], [[RuBisCO|''rbc''L]], ''atp''B and [[18S rDNA]], in addition to [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. These studies resulted in a re-examination of the relationships between most of the genera within the order. Thismiaceae was shown to be a [[sister group]] to Burmanniaceae, and so was included in it. The [[monotypic]] families Taccaceae and Trichopodaceae were included in Dioscoreaceae, while [[Nartheciaceae]] could also be grouped within Dioscoreales. [[APG III system|APG III]] (2009){{sfn|APG III|2009}} did not change this, so the order now comprises three families Burmanniaceae, Dioscoreaceae and Nartheciaceae.\n\nAlthough further research on the deeper relationships within Dioscoreales continues,{{sfn|Merckx et al|2009}}{{sfn|Merckx et al|2010}}{{sfn|Merckx|Smets|2014}} the [[APG IV]] (2016) authors felt it was still premature to propose a restructuring of the order. Specifically these issues involve conflicting information as to the relationship between ''[[Thismia]]'' and Burmanniaceae,{{sfn|Hertweck et al|2015}} and hence whether Thismiaceae should be subsumed in the latter, or reinstated.{{sfn|APG IV|2016}}\n\n=== Phylogeny ===\n[[Molecular phylogenetics]] in Dioscoreales poses special problems due to the absence of [[plastid]] [[genes]] in mycoheterotrophs.{{sfn|Merckx et al|2009}} Dioscoreales is [[monophyletic]] and is placed as a [[sister group|sister order]] to [[Pandanales]], as shown in Cladogram I.{{sfn|Hertweck et al|2015}}{{sfn|APG IV|2016}}\n\n{{cladogram\n| title={{anchor|Clad2}}Cladogram I: The [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] composition of the monocots.{{sfn|APG IV|2016}}\n| align=center\n| cladogram={{clade|style=font-size:92%;line-height:100%;;width:500px;\n\n        | label1=monocots\n        | 1={{clade\n           |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Acorales]]\n            |2={{clade\n               |1=[[Alismatales]]\n               |2={{clade\n                 |1=[[Petrosaviales]]\n                 |2={{clade\n                   |1={{clade\n                     |1='''Dioscoreales'''\n                     |2=[[Pandanales]]\n                     }}\n                  |2={{clade\n                   |1=[[Liliales]]\n                   |2={{clade\n                     |1=[[Asparagales]]\n                     |label2= [[commelinids]]\n                     |2= {{clade\n                        |1=[[Arecales]]\n                        |2=[[Poales]]\n                        |3={{clade\n                           |1=[[Zingiberales]]\n                           |2=[[Commelinales]]\n                           }}\n                        }}\n                      }}\n                    }}\n                   }}\n                 }}\n               }}\n             }}\n            }}\n\n         }}\n     }}\n\n=== Evolution ===\nThe data for the evolution of the order is collected from molecular analyses since there are no such fossils found. It is estimated that Dioscoreales and its sister clade [[Pandanales]] split up around 121 millions of years ago during Early Cretaceous when the [[stem group]] was formed. Then it took 3 to 6 millions of years for the [[crown group]] to differentiate in Mid [[Cretaceous]].\n\n=== Subdivision ===\nThe three families of Dioscreales constitutes about 22 genera and about 849 species{{sfn|Christenhusz|Byng|2016}} making it one of the smaller monocot orders.{{sfn|Merckx et al|2010}} Of these, the largest group is ''[[Dioscorea]]'' (yams) with about 450 species. By contrast the second largest genus is ''[[Burmannia (plant)|Burmannia]]'' with about 60 species, and most have only one or two.{{sfn|Merckx et al|2010}}\n\nSome authors,{{sfn|Merckx|Smets|2014}} preferring the original APG (1998)families, continue to treat Thismiaceae separately from Burmanniaceae and Taccaceae from Dioscoreaceae.{{sfn|Merckx et al|2010}} But in the 2015 study of Hertwerk and colleagies, seven genera representing all three families were examined with an eight gene dataset. Dioscoreales was monophyletic and three subclades were represented corresponding to the APG families. Dioscoreaceae and Burmanniaceae were in a sister group relationship.{{sfn|Hertweck et al|2015}}\n\n{{cladogram\n| title={{anchor|Clad2}}Cladogram II: Relationship of Dioscoreales families{{sfn|Hertweck et al|2015}} (number of genera){{sfn|Christenhusz|Byng|2016}}\n| align=center\n| cladogram={{clade|style=font-size:92%;line-height:100%;;width:500px;\n\n| label1=Dioscoreales\n        |1={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n             |1= [[Dioscoreaceae]] (9)\n             |2= [[Burmanniaceae]] (8)\n              }}\n         |2= [[Nartheciaceae]] (5)\n               }}\n             }}\n            }}\n\n=== Etymology ===\nNamed after the [[type genus]] ''[[Dioscorea]]'', which in turn was named by [[Linnaeus]] in 1753 to honour the Greek physician and botanist [[Dioscorides]].{{sfn|Bouman|1995}}\n\n== Distribution and habitat==\nSpecies from this order are distributed across all of the continents except [[Antarctica]]. They are mainly [[tropical]] or [[subtropical]] representatives but however there are members of [[Dioscoreaceae]] and [[Nartheciaceae]] families found in cooler regions of [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. Order Dioscoreales contains plants that are able to form an underground organ for reservation of [[nutrition]]s as many other [[monocot]]s. An exception is the family [[Burmanniaceae]] which is entirely myco-heterotrophic and contains species that lack [[photosynthetic]] abilities.\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Bog Asphodel - geograph.org.uk - 1402752.jpg|thumb|''[[Narthecium ossifragum]]'' - bog asphodel]]\nThe three families included in order Dioscoreales also represent three different ecological groups of plants. [[Dioscoreaceae]] contains mainly vines (''[[Dioscorea]]'') and other crawling species (''[[Epipetrum]]''). [[Nartheciaceae]] on the other hand is a family composed of herbeceous plants with a rather lily-like appearance (''[[Aletris]]'') while [[Burmanniaceae]] is entirely [[myco-heterotrophic]] group.\n\n== Uses ==\nMany members of [[Dioscoreaceae]] produce [[tuberous]] [[starch]]y [[Root|roots]] ([[yam (vegetable)|yams]]) which form [[staple foods]] in tropical regions. They have also been the source of [[steroids]] for the [[pharmaceutical industry]], including the production of [[oral contraceptive pill|oral]] [[contraceptives]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist |2| refs=\n\n{{efn|name = suffix|For a detailed discussion on this nomenclature, see [[Lilianae]]}}}}\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist|20em|refs=\n\n<ref name=apwdioscoreales>{{harvnb|Stevens|2016|loc=[http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/orders/dioscorealesweb.htm#Dioscoreales Dioscoreales]}}</ref>\n<ref name=bhdiosc>{{harvnb|Bentham|Hooker|1862\u20131883|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/14690#page/302/mode/1up vol.&nbsp;3 part 2 Ordo Dioscoreaceae p.&nbsp;741]}}</ref>\n<ref name=Eichler>{{harvnb|Eichler|1886|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XE0bAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA35 Dioscoreaceae p.&nbsp;35]}}</ref>\n<ref name=Engler>{{harvnb|Engler|1903|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/63778#page/133/mode/1up Dioscoreaceae p.&nbsp;99]}}</ref>\n<ref name=hooker>{{harvnb|Le Maout|Decaisne|1873|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924001400484#page/n1035/mode/2up Cohort VI.

This schooling is followed by four years of dental school to qualify as a \"[[Doctor of Dental Surgery]]\" (DDS) or \"[[Doctor of Dental Medicine]]\" (DMD).

The English physician [[Thomas Browne]] in his ''[[A Letter to a Friend]]'' ({{circa|1656}} pub. 1690) made an early dental observation with characteristic humour:\n\n{{Quote|quote=The Egyptian Mummies that I have seen, have had their Mouths open, and somewhat gaping, which affordeth a good opportunity to view and observe their Teeth, wherein 'tis not easie to find any wanting or decayed: and therefore in Egypt, where one Man practised but one Operation, or the Diseases but of single Parts, it must needs be a barren Profession to confine unto that of drawing of Teeth, and little better than to have been Tooth-drawer unto King Pyrrhus, who had but two in his Head.}}\n\nThe French surgeon [[Pierre Fauchard]] became known as the \"father of modern dentistry\". Despite the limitations of the primitive surgical instruments during the late 17th and early 18th century, Fauchard was a highly skilled [[surgeon]] who made remarkable improvisations of dental instruments, often adapting tools from [[watchmaker]]s, [[jeweler]]s and even [[barber]]s, that he thought could be used in dentistry. He introduced [[dental filling]]s as treatment for [[dental cavities]]. He asserted that [[sugar]] derivate acids like [[tartaric acid]] were responsible for [[caries|dental decay]], and also suggested that tumors surrounding the teeth and in the [[Gingiva|gums]] could appear in the later stages of tooth decay.<ref name=\"Besombes\">{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2RRqAAAAMAAJ |title = Pierre Fauchard (1678\u20131761): The First Dental Surgeon, His Work, His Actuality |author = Andr\u00e9 Besombes |author2 = Phillipe de Gaillande |publisher = Pierre Fauchard Academy |date = 1993 }}</ref><ref name=\"Weinberger\">{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2wtqAAAAMAAJ |title = Pierre Fauchard, Surgeon-dentist: A Brief Account of the Beginning of Modern Dentistry, the First Dental Textbook, and Professional Life Two Hundred Years Ago |author = Bernhard Wolf Weinberger |date = 1941 |publisher = Pierre Fauchard Academy }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Panoramic radiograph of historic dental implants.jpg|thumb|Panoramic radiograph of historic dental implants, made 1978]]\n\nFauchard was the pioneer of [[Prosthodontics|dental prosthesis]], and he discovered many methods to replace lost teeth.

He also introduced [[dental braces]], although they were initially made of gold, he discovered that the teeth position could be corrected as the teeth would follow the pattern of the wires. Waxed [[linen]] or [[silk]] threads were usually employed to fasten the braces. His contributions to the world of dental science consist primarily of his 1728 publication Le chirurgien dentiste or The Surgeon Dentist.  The French text included \"basic oral anatomy and function, dental construction, and various operative and restorative techniques, and effectively separated dentistry from the wider category of surgery\".<ref name=\"Besombes\" /><ref name=\"Weinberger\" />\n\n[[File:Dental office.jpg|thumb|left|A modern Dentist's chair]]\n\nAfter Fauchard, the study of dentistry rapidly expanded. Two important books, ''Natural History of Human Teeth'' (1771) and ''Practical Treatise on the Diseases of the Teeth'' (1778), were published by British surgeon [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]]. In 1763 he entered into a period of collaboration with the London-based dentist James Spence. He began to theorise about the possibility of tooth transplants from one person to another. He realised that the chances of an (initially, at least) successful tooth transplant would be improved if the donor tooth was as fresh as possible and was matched for size with the recipient.  These principles are still used in the transplantation of [[internal organ]]s. Hunter conducted a series of pioneering operations, in which he attempted a tooth transplant. Although the donated teeth never properly bonded with the recipients' gums, one of Hunter's patients stated that he had three which lasted for six years, a remarkable achievement for the period.<ref>{{cite book |author = Moore, Wendy |authorlink = Wendy Moore |title = The Knife Man |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DKInoTPFrBoC |accessdate = 8 March 2012 |date = 30 September 2010 |publisher = Transworld |pages = 223\u2013224 |isbn = 978-1-4090-4462-8 }}</ref>\n\nMajor advances were made in the 19th century, and dentistry evolved from a trade to a profession. The profession came under government regulation by the end of the 19th century. In the UK the Dentist Act was passed in 1878 and the British Dental Association formed in 1879. In the same year, [[Francis Brodie Imlach]] was the first ever dentist to be elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh), raising dentistry onto a par with clinical surgery for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://historyofdentistry.co.uk/index_htm_files/2004Apr2.pdf |format=PDF |title=A pioneering history: dentistry and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh |first=Helen |last=Dingwall |date=April 2004 |work=History of Dentistry Newsletter |issue=14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201191323/http://historyofdentistry.co.uk/index_htm_files/2004Apr2.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Hazards in modern dentistry===\n{{main|Occupational hazards in dentistry}}\nLong term occupational noise exposure can contribute to permanent hearing loss, which is referred to as [[noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL) and [[tinnitus]]. Noise exposure can cause excessive stimulation of the hearing mechanism, which damages the delicate structures of the inner ear.<ref>{{cite web|title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/noise-induced-hearing-loss|website=NIDCD|language=en|date=18 August 2015}}</ref> NIHL can occur when an individual is exposed to sound levels above 90 dBA according to the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA). Regulations state that the permissible noise exposure levels for individuals is 90 dBA.<ref>{{cite web|title=Occupational Safety and Health Standards {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owastand.display_standard_group?p_toc_level=1&p_part_number=1910|website=Osha.gov|language=en-us}}</ref> For the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ([[NIOSH]]), exposure limits are set to 85 dBA. Exposures below 85 dBA are not considered to be hazardous. Time limits are placed on how long an individual can stay in an environment above 85 dBA before it causes hearing loss. OSHA places that limitation at 8 hours for 85 dBA. The exposure time becomes shorter as the dBA level increases.\n\nWithin the field of dentistry, a variety of cleaning tools are used including piezoelectric and sonic scalers, and ultrasonic scalers and cleaners.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stevens|first1=M|title=Is someone listening to the din of occupational noise exposure in dentistry|journal=RDH|date=1999|issue=19|pages=34-85}}</ref> While a majority of the tools do not exceed 75 dBA,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Merrel|first1=HB|title=Noise pollution and hearing loss in the dental office|journal=Dental Assisting Journal|date=1992|volume=61|issue=3|pages=6-9}}</ref> prolonged exposure over many years can lead to hearing loss or complaints of tinnitus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=J.D.|title=Effects of occupational ultrasonic noise exposure on hearing of dental hygienists: A pilot study|journal=Journal of Dental Hygiene|date=2002|volume=76|issue=4|pages=262-269}}</ref> Few dentists have reported using personal hearing protective devices,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Leggat|first1=P.A.|title=Occupational Health Problems in Modern Dentistry: A Review|journal=Industrial Health|date=2007|volume=45|issue=5|pages=611-621|doi=10.2486/indhealth.45.611}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Leggat|first1=P.A.|title=Occupational hygiene practices of dentists in southern Thailand|journal=International Dentistry Journal|date=2001|issue=51}}</ref> which could offset any potential hearing loss or tinnitus.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|Dentistry|Health and fitness|Medicine}}\n\n* [[List of dental organizations]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{wikiversity|School:Dentistry}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{dmoz|/Health/Dentistry/|Dentistry}}\n<!--======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

It can also be defined as the longest [[chord (geometry)|chord]] of the circle. Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a [[sphere]].\n\nIn more modern usage, the length of a diameter is also called the diameter. In this sense one speaks of ''the'' diameter rather than ''a'' diameter (which refers to the line itself), because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length, this being twice the [[radius]] '''r'''.\n\n: <math>d = 2r \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r = \\frac{d}{2}.</math>\n\nFor a [[convex set|convex shape]] in the plane, the diameter is defined to be the largest distance that can be formed between two opposite [[parallel lines]] tangent to its boundary, and the ''width'' is often defined to be the smallest such distance. Both quantities can be calculated efficiently using [[rotating calipers]].<ref>{{cite journal\n| author = Toussaint, Godfried T.\n| title = Solving geometric problems with the rotating calipers\n| publisher=Proc.

A diameter of an ellipse is any [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] passing through the center of the ellipse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/ConjugateDiameters.shtml|title=Conjugate Diameters in Ellipse|first=Alexander|last=Bogomolny|website=www.cut-the-knot.org}}</ref> For example, [[conjugate diameters]] have the property that a tangent line to the ellipse at the endpoint of one of them is parallel to the other one. The longest diameter is called the [[major axis]].\n\nThe word \"diameter\" is derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''diametros''), \"diameter of a circle\", from \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac (''dia''), \"across, through\" and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (''metron''), \"measure\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=diameter|title=diameter - Origin and meaning of diameter by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref> It is often abbreviated '''DIA''', '''dia''', '''d''', or '''\u2300'''.\n\n==Generalizations==\nThe definitions given above are only valid for circles, spheres and convex shapes. However, they are special cases of a more general definition that is valid for any kind of ''n''-dimensional convex or non-convex object, such as a [[hypercube]] or a set of scattered points. The '''diameter''' of a [[subset]] of a [[metric space]] is the [[supremum|least upper bound]] of the set of all distances between pairs of points in the subset. So, if ''A'' is the subset, the diameter is\n:[[supremum|sup]] { d(''x'', ''y'') | ''x'', ''y'' \u2208 ''A'' } .\nIf the [[distance function]] d is viewed here as having [[codomain]] '''R''' (the set of all [[real number]]s), this implies that the diameter of the [[empty set]] (the case {{nowrap|1=''A'' = \u2205}}) equals \u2212\u221e ([[negative infinity]]). Some authors prefer to treat the empty set as a special case, assigning it a diameter equal to 0,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://at.yorku.ca/cgi-bin/bbqa?forum=ask_a_topologist_2004;task=show_msg;msg=0860.0002|title=Re: diameter of an empty set|website=at.yorku.ca}}</ref> which corresponds to taking the codomain of d to be the set of nonnegative reals.\n\nFor any solid object or set of scattered points in n-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], the diameter of the object or set is the same as the diameter of its [[convex hull]]. In medical [[Idiom#Parlance|parlance]] concerning a lesion or in geology concerning a rock, the diameter of an object is the supremum of the set of all distances between pairs of points in the object.\n\nIn [[differential geometry]], the diameter is an important global [[Riemannian geometry|Riemannian]] [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]].\n\nIn plane geometry, a diameter of a [[conic section]] is typically defined as any chord which passes through the conic's centre; such diameters are not necessarily of uniform length, except in the case of the circle, which has [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]]&nbsp;''e''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.\n\n==Symbol==\n[[Image:Technical Drawing Hole 01.svg|thumb|122px|Sign \u2300 in a technical drawing]]\n[[Image:Sign diameter.png|thumb|150px|Sign \u2300 from an [[AutoCAD]] drawing]]\n{{distinguish|text=the Scandinavian letter \"[[\u00d8]]\", the [[empty set]] symbol {{italics correction|\"}}''\u2205''\" or the greek letter [[phi]] (\u03a6)}}\n\nThe [[symbol]] or [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] for diameter, \u2300, is [[Homoglyph|similar in size and design]] to [[\u00f8]], the Latin small letter o with stroke.

[[Law enforcement officer]]s in the [[United States]] and other countries often use [[breathalyzer]] units and [[field sobriety test]]s as more convenient and rapid alternatives to blood tests.<ref>{{cite web |title=Random breath testing - Data by country |url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.54620 |website=apps.who.int |accessdate=25 June 2018}}</ref> There are also various models of breathalyzer units that are available for consumer use. Because these may have varying reliability and may produce different results than the tests used for law-enforcement purposes, the results from such devices should be conservatively interpreted.\n\nMany informal intoxication tests exist, which, in general, are unreliable and not recommended as deterrents to excessive intoxication or as indicators of the safety of activities such as motor vehicle driving, heavy equipment operation, machine tool use, etc.\n\nFor determining whether someone is intoxicated by alcohol by some means other than a blood-alcohol test, it is necessary to rule out other conditions such as [[hypoglycemia]], [[stroke]], usage of other intoxicants, mental health issues, and so on. It is best if his / her behavior has been observed while the subject is sober to establish a baseline. Several well-known criteria can be used to establish a probable diagnosis. For a physician in the acute-treatment setting, acute alcohol intoxication can mimic other acute neurological disorders, or is frequently combined with other [[recreational drug]]s that complicate diagnosis and treatment.\n\n== Management ==\nAcute alcohol poisoning is a [[medical emergency]] due to the risk of death from [[respiratory depression]] or [[aspiration pneumonia|aspiration of vomit]] if [[vomiting]] occurs while the person is unresponsive. Emergency treatment strives to stabilize and maintain an open airway and sufficient breathing, while waiting for the alcohol to metabolize. This can be done by removal of any vomitus or, if the person is unconscious or has impaired gag reflex, intubation of the trachea.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Devi G. |author2=Castro V.

Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating [[Redundancy (information theory)|statistical redundancy]]. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information.<ref name=\"PujarKadlaskar\"/>\n\nThe process of reducing the size of a [[data file]] is often referred to as data compression. In the context of [[data transmission]], it is called source coding; encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted.<ref name=\"Salomon\"/> Source coding should not be confused with [[channel coding]], for error detection and correction or [[line coding]], the means for mapping data onto a signal.\n\nCompression is useful because it reduces resources required to store and transmit data. [[Computational resource]]s are consumed in the compression process and, usually, in the reversal of the process (decompression). Data compression is subject to a [[Space\u2013time tradeoff|space\u2013time complexity trade-off]]. For instance, [[#video|a compression scheme for video]] may require expensive [[Electronic hardware|hardware]] for the video to be decompressed fast enough to be viewed as it is being decompressed, and the option to decompress the video in full before watching it may be inconvenient or require additional storage. The design of data compression schemes involves trade-offs among various factors, including the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced (when using [[lossy data compression]]), and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data.<ref name=\"MittalVetter\"/><ref name=\"Tank\"/>\n\n== Lossless ==\n[[Lossless data compression]] [[algorithm]]s usually exploit [[Redundancy (information theory)|statistical redundancy]] to represent data without losing any [[Self-information|information]], so that the process is reversible. Lossless compression is possible because most real-world data exhibits statistical redundancy. For example, an image may have areas of color that do not change over several pixels; instead of coding \"red pixel, red pixel, ...\" the data may be encoded as \"279 red pixels\". This is a basic example of [[run-length encoding]]; there are many schemes to reduce file size by eliminating redundancy.\n\nThe [[Lempel\u2013Ziv]] (LZ) compression methods are among the most popular algorithms for lossless storage.<ref name=\"Optimized LZW\"/>  [[DEFLATE]] is a variation on LZ optimized for decompression speed and compression ratio, but compression can be slow. In the mid-1980s, following work by [[Terry Welch]], the [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch]] (LZW) algorithm rapidly became the method of choice for most general-purpose compression systems. LZW is used in [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] images, programs such as PKZIP, and hardware devices such as modems.<ref name=\"Wolfram\"/> LZ methods use a table-based compression model where table entries are substituted for repeated strings of data. For most LZ methods, this table is generated dynamically from earlier data in the input. The table itself is often [[Huffman coding|Huffman encoded]]. [[Grammar-based codes]] like this can compress highly repetitive input extremely effectively, for instance, a biological data collection of the same or closely related species, a huge versioned document collection, internet archival, etc. The basic task of grammar-based codes is constructing a context-free grammar deriving a single string. Other practical grammar compression algorithms include [[Sequitur algorithm|Sequitur]] and Re-Pair.\n\nThe strongest modern lossless compressors use [[Randomized algorithm|probabilistic]] models, such as [[prediction by partial matching]]. The [[Burrows\u2013Wheeler transform]] can also be viewed as an indirect form of statistical modelling.<ref name=\"mahmud2\"/> In a further refinement of the direct use of [[probabilistic model]]ling, statistical estimates can be coupled to an algorithm called [[arithmetic coding]]. Arithmetic coding is a more modern coding technique that uses the mathematical calculations of a [[finite-state machine]] to produce a string of encoded bits from a series of input data symbols. It can achieve superior compression compared to other techniques such as the better-known Huffman algorithm. It uses an internal memory state to avoid the need to perform a one-to-one mapping of individual input symbols to distinct representations that use an integer number of bits, and it clears out the internal memory only after encoding the entire string of data symbols. Arithmetic coding applies especially well to adaptive data compression tasks where the statistics vary and are context-dependent, as it can be easily coupled with an adaptive model of the [[probability distribution]] of the input data. An early example of the use of arithmetic coding was in an optional (but not widely used) feature of the [[JPEG]] image coding standard.<ref name=TomLane/> It has since been applied in various other designs including [[H.263]], [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] and [[HEVC]] for video coding.<ref name=\"HEVC\"/><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n== Lossy ==\n[[Lossy data compression]] is the converse of [[lossless data compression]]. In the late 1980s, digital images became more common, and standards for compressing them emerged. In the early 1990s, lossy compression methods began to be widely used.<ref name=\"Wolfram\"/> In these schemes, some loss of information is acceptable. Dropping nonessential detail from the data source can save storage space. Lossy data compression schemes are designed by research on how people perceive the data in question. For example, the human eye is more sensitive to subtle variations in [[luminance]] than it is to the variations in color. [[JPEG]] [[image compression]] works in part by rounding off nonessential bits of information.<ref name=\"Arcangel\"/>  There is a corresponding [[trade-off]] between preserving information and reducing size. A number of popular compression formats exploit these perceptual differences, including [[Psychoacoustics|those used in music]] files, images, and video.\n\nLossy [[image compression]] can be used in [[digital camera]]s, to increase storage capacities with minimal degradation of picture quality. Similarly, [[DVD]]s use the lossy [[MPEG-2]] [[video coding format]] for [[video compression]].\n\nIn lossy [[audio compression (data)|audio compression]], methods of [[psychoacoustics]] are used to remove non-audible (or less audible) components of the [[Audio signal processing|audio signal]]. Compression of human speech is often performed with even more specialized techniques; [[speech coding]], or voice coding, is sometimes distinguished as a separate discipline from ''audio compression''. Different audio and speech compression standards are listed under [[audio coding format]]s. ''Voice compression'' is used in [[internet telephony]], for example, audio compression is used for CD ripping and is decoded by the audio players.<ref name=\"mahmud2\"/>\n\n== Theory ==\nThe theoretical background of compression is provided by [[information theory]] (which is closely related to [[algorithmic information theory]]) for lossless compression and [[rate\u2013distortion theory]] for lossy compression. These areas of study were essentially created by [[Claude Shannon]], who published fundamental papers on the topic in the late 1940s and early 1950s. [[Coding theory]] is also related to this. The idea of data compression is also deeply connected with [[statistical inference]].<ref name=\"Marak\"/>\n\n=== Machine learning ===\n{{see also|Machine learning}}\nThere is a close connection between [[machine learning]] and compression: a system that predicts the [[posterior probabilities]] of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using [[arithmetic coding]] on the output distribution) while an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence.\"<ref name=\"Mahoney\"/><ref name=\"Market Efficiency\"/><ref name=\"Ben-Gal\"/>\n\n==== Feature space vectors ====\nHowever a new, alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit [[feature space vector]]s, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space \u2135, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponds to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM.<ref name=\"ScullyBrodley\"/>\n\n=== Data differencing ===\n{{main|Data differencing}}\nData compression can be viewed as a special case of [[data differencing]]:<ref name=\"RFC 3284\"/><ref name=\"Vdelta\"/> Data differencing consists of producing a ''difference'' given a ''source'' and a ''target,'' with patching producing a ''target'' given a ''source'' and a ''difference,'' while data compression consists of producing a compressed file given a target, and decompression consists of producing a target given only a compressed file. Thus, one can consider data compression as data differencing with empty source data, the compressed file corresponding to a \"difference from nothing.\" This is the same as considering absolute [[entropy (information theory)|entropy]] (corresponding to data compression) as a special case of [[relative entropy]] (corresponding to data differencing) with no initial data.\n\nWhen one wishes to emphasize the connection, one may use the term ''differential compression'' to refer to data differencing.\n\n== Uses ==\n=== Audio ===\n{{see also|Audio codec|Audio coding format}}\nAudio data compression, not to be confused with [[dynamic range compression]], has the potential to reduce the transmission [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and storage requirements of audio data. [[List of codecs#Audio|Audio compression algorithms]] are implemented in [[software]] as audio [[codec]]s. Lossy audio compression algorithms provide higher compression at the cost of fidelity and are used in numerous audio applications. These algorithms almost all rely on [[psychoacoustics]] to eliminate or reduce fidelity of less audible sounds, thereby reducing the space required to store or transmit them.<ref name=\"mahdi53\"/>\n\nIn both lossy and lossless compression, [[Redundancy (information theory)|information redundancy]] is reduced, using methods such as [[Coding theory|coding]], [[pattern recognition]], and [[linear prediction]] to reduce the amount of information used to represent the uncompressed data.\n\nThe acceptable trade-off between loss of audio quality and transmission or storage size depends upon the application. For example, one 640 MB [[compact disc]] (CD) holds approximately one hour of uncompressed [[high fidelity]] music, less than 2 hours of music compressed losslessly, or 7 hours of music compressed in the [[MP3]] format at a medium [[bit rate]]. A digital sound recorder can typically store around 200 hours of clearly intelligible speech in 640 MB.<ref name=\"Olympus WS-120\"/>\n\nLossless audio compression produces a representation of digital data that decompress to an exact digital duplicate of the original audio stream, unlike playback from lossy compression techniques such as [[Vorbis]] and [[MP3]]. Compression ratios are around 50\u201360 % of original size,<ref name=\"FLAC\"/> which is similar to those for generic lossless data compression. Lossless compression is unable to attain high compression ratios due to the complexity of [[waveform]]s and the rapid changes in sound forms. Codecs like [[FLAC]], [[Shorten (file format)|Shorten]], and [[TTA (codec)|TTA]] use [[linear prediction]] to estimate the spectrum of the signal. Many of these algorithms use [[convolution]] with the filter [-1 1] to slightly [[white noise|whiten]] or [[decorrelation|flatten]] the spectrum, thereby allowing traditional lossless compression to work more efficiently. The process is reversed upon decompression.\n\nWhen audio files are to be processed, either by further compression or for [[Audio editing|editing]], it is desirable to work from an unchanged original (uncompressed or losslessly compressed). Processing of a lossily compressed file for some purpose usually produces a final result inferior to the creation of the same compressed file from an uncompressed original. In addition to sound editing or mixing, lossless audio compression is often used for archival storage, or as master copies.\n\nA number of lossless audio compression formats exist. [[Shorten (file format)|Shorten]] was an early lossless format. Newer ones include [[Free Lossless Audio Codec]] (FLAC), Apple's [[Apple Lossless]] (ALAC), [[MPEG-4 ALS]], Microsoft's [[Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless]] (WMA Lossless), [[Monkey's Audio]], [[TTA (codec)|TTA]], and [[WavPack]]. See [[List of codecs#Lossless data compression|list of lossless codecs]] for a complete listing.\n\nSome [[audio file format|audio formats]] feature a combination of a lossy format and a lossless correction; this allows stripping the correction to easily obtain a lossy file. Such formats include [[MPEG-4 SLS]] (Scalable to Lossless), [[WavPack]], and [[OptimFROG DualStream]].\n\nOther formats are associated with a distinct system, such as:\n* [[Direct Stream Transfer]], used in [[Super Audio CD]]\n* [[Meridian Lossless Packing]], used in [[DVD-Audio]], [[Dolby TrueHD]], [[Blu-ray]] and [[HD DVD]]\n\n==== Lossy audio compression ====\n[[File:AudiodatenkompressionManowarThePowerOfThySword.jpg|thumb|Comparison of [[spectrogram]]s of audio in an uncompressed format and several lossy formats. The lossy spectrograms show [[bandlimiting]] of higher frequencies, a common technique associated with lossy audio compression.]]\n\nLossy audio compression is used in a wide range of applications. In addition to the direct applications (MP3 players or computers), digitally compressed audio streams are used in most video DVDs, digital television, streaming media on the [[internet]], satellite and cable radio, and increasingly in terrestrial radio broadcasts. Lossy compression typically achieves far greater compression than lossless compression (data of 5 percent to 20 percent of the original stream, rather than 50 percent to 60 percent), by discarding less-critical data.<ref name=\"Jaiswal\"/>\n\nThe innovation of lossy audio compression was to use [[psychoacoustics]] to recognize that not all data in an audio stream can be perceived by the human [[auditory system]]. Most lossy compression reduces perceptual redundancy by first identifying perceptually irrelevant sounds, that is, sounds that are very hard to hear. Typical examples include high frequencies or sounds that occur at the same time as louder sounds. Those sounds are coded with decreased accuracy or not at all.\n\nDue to the nature of lossy algorithms, [[audio quality]] suffers when a file is decompressed and recompressed ([[digital generation loss]]). This makes lossy compression unsuitable for storing the intermediate results in professional audio engineering applications, such as sound editing and multitrack recording. However, they are very popular with end users (particularly [[MP3]]) as a megabyte can store about a minute's worth of music at adequate quality.\n\n===== Coding methods =====\nTo determine what information in an audio signal is perceptually irrelevant, most lossy compression algorithms use transforms such as the [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) to convert [[time domain]] sampled waveforms into a transform domain. Once transformed, typically into the [[frequency domain]], component frequencies can be allocated bits according to how audible they are. Audibility of spectral components calculated using the [[absolute threshold of hearing]] and the principles of [[simultaneous masking]]\u2014the phenomenon wherein a signal is masked by another signal separated by frequency\u2014and, in some cases, [[temporal masking]]\u2014where a signal is masked by another signal separated by time. [[Equal-loudness contour]]s may also be used to weight the perceptual importance of components. Models of the human ear-brain combination incorporating such effects are often called [[psychoacoustic model]]s.<ref name=\"faxin47\"/>\n\nOther types of lossy compressors, such as the [[linear predictive coding]] (LPC) used with speech, are source-based coders. These coders use a model of the sound's generator (such as the human vocal tract with LPC) to whiten the audio signal (i.e., flatten its spectrum) before [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]]. LPC may be thought of as a basic perceptual coding technique: reconstruction of an audio signal using a linear predictor shapes the coder's quantization noise into the spectrum of the target signal, partially masking it.<ref name=\"Jaiswal\"/>\n\nLossy formats are often used for the distribution of streaming audio or interactive applications (such as the coding of speech for digital transmission in cell phone networks). In such applications, the data must be decompressed as the data flows, rather than after the entire data stream has been transmitted. Not all audio codecs can be used for streaming applications, and for such applications a codec designed to stream data effectively will usually be chosen.<ref name=\"Jaiswal\"/>\n\nLatency results from the methods used to encode and decode the data. Some codecs will analyze a longer segment of the data to optimize efficiency, and then code it in a manner that requires a larger segment of data at one time to decode. (Often codecs create segments called a \"frame\" to create discrete data segments for encoding and decoding.) The inherent [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] of the coding algorithm can be critical; for example, when there is a two-way transmission of data, such as with a telephone conversation, significant delays may seriously degrade the perceived quality.\n\nIn contrast to the speed of compression, which is proportional to the number of operations required by the algorithm, here latency refers to the number of samples that must be analysed before a block of audio is processed. In the minimum case, latency is zero samples (e.g., if the coder/decoder simply reduces the number of bits used to quantize the signal). Time domain algorithms such as LPC also often have low latencies, hence their popularity in speech coding for telephony. In algorithms such as MP3, however, a large number of samples have to be analyzed to implement a psychoacoustic model in the frequency domain, and latency is on the order of 23 ms (46 ms for two-way communication)).\n\n===== Speech encoding =====\n[[Speech encoding]] is an important category of audio data compression. The perceptual models used to estimate what a human ear can hear are generally somewhat different from those used for music. The range of frequencies needed to convey the sounds of a human voice are normally far narrower than that needed for music, and the sound is normally less complex. As a result, speech can be encoded at high quality using a relatively low bit rate.\n\nIf the data to be compressed is analog (such as a voltage that varies with time), quantization is employed to digitize it into numbers (normally integers). This is referred to as analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion. If the integers generated by quantization are 8 bits each, then the entire range of the analog signal is divided into 256 intervals and all the signal values within an interval are quantized to the same number. If 16-bit integers are generated, then the range of the analog signal is divided into 65,536 intervals.\n\nThis relation illustrates the compromise between high resolution (a large number of analog intervals) and high compression (small integers generated). This application of quantization is used by several speech compression methods. This is accomplished, in general, by some combination of two approaches:\n* Only encoding sounds that could be made by a single human voice.\n* Throwing away more of the data in the signal\u2014keeping just enough to reconstruct an \"intelligible\" voice rather than the full frequency range of human [[hearing (sense)|hearing]].\n\nPerhaps the earliest algorithms used in speech encoding (and audio data compression in general) were the [[A-law algorithm]] and the [[\u00b5-law algorithm]].\n\n==== History ====\n[[File:Placa-audioPC-925.jpg|size100px|right|thumb|Solidyne 922: The world's first commercial audio bit compression card for PC, 1990]]\n\nA literature compendium for a large variety of audio coding systems was published in the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC), February 1988. While there were some papers from before that time, this collection documented an entire variety of finished, working audio coders, nearly all of them using perceptual (i.e. masking) techniques and some kind of frequency analysis and back-end noiseless coding.<ref name=\"Possibilities\"/> Several of these papers remarked on the difficulty of obtaining good, clean digital audio for research purposes. Most, if not all, of the authors in the JSAC edition were also active in the MPEG-1 Audio committee.\n\nThe world's first commercial [[broadcast automation]] audio compression system was developed by Oscar Bonello, an engineering professor at the [[University of Buenos Aires]].<ref name=\"Solidyne\"/> In 1983, using the psychoacoustic principle of the masking of critical bands first published in 1967,<ref name=\"Zwicker\"/> he started developing a practical application based on the recently developed [[IBM PC]] computer, and the broadcast automation system was launched in 1987 under the name [[Audicom]]. Twenty years later, almost all the radio stations in the world were using similar technology manufactured by a number of companies.\n\n=== Video ===\n{{see also|Video coding format|Video codec}}\nVideo compression is a practical implementation of source coding in information theory. In practice, most video codecs are used alongside audio compression techniques to store the separate but complementary data streams as one combined package using so-called ''[[digital container format|container format]]s''.<ref name=\"CSIP\"/>\n\n[[Uncompressed video]] requires a very high [[Uncompressed video#Storage and Data Rates for Uncompressed Video|data rate]]. Although [[List of codecs#Lossless video compression|lossless video compression]] codecs perform at a compression factor of 5 to 12, a typical [[MPEG-4]] lossy compression video has a compression factor between 20 and 200.<ref name=\"MSU2007\"/>\n\n==== Encoding theory ====\nVideo data may be represented as a series of still image frames. Such data usually contains abundant amounts of spatial and temporal [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]]. Video compression algorithms attempt to reduce redundancy and store information more compactly. \n\nMost [[video compression formats]] and [[video codec|codecs]] exploit both spatial and temporal redundancy (e.g. through difference coding with [[motion compensation]]). Similarities can be encoded by only storing differences between e.g. temporally adjacent frames (inter-frame coding) or spatially adjacent pixels (intra-frame coding).\n[[inter frame|Inter-frame]] compression (a temporal [[delta encoding]]) is one of the most powerful compression techniques. It (re)uses data from one or more earlier or later frames in a sequence to describe the current frame. [[Intra-frame coding]], on the other hand, uses only data from within the current frame, effectively being still-[[image compression]].<ref name=\"faxin47\"/> And the intra-frame coding always uses lossy compression algorithms. \n\nA [[Video coding format#Intra-frame video coding formats|class of specialized formats]] used in camcorders and video editing use less complex compression schemes that restrict their prediction techniques to intra-frame prediction.\n\nUsually video compression additionally employs [[lossy compression]] techniques like [[quantization (image processing)|quantization]] that reduce aspects of the source data that are (more or less) irrelevant to the human visual perception by exploiting perceptual features of human vision. For example, small differences in color are more difficult to perceive than are changes in brightness. Compression algorithms can average a color across these similar areas to reduce space, in a manner similar to those used in [[JPEG]] image compression.<ref name=\"TomLane\"/> As in all lossy compression, there is a [[trade-off]] between [[video quality]], cost of processing the compression and decompression, and system requirements. Highly compressed video may present visible or distracting [[compression artifact|artifacts]].\n\nOther methods than the prevalent DCT-based transform formats, such as [[fractal compression]], [[matching pursuit]] and the use of a [[discrete wavelet transform]] (DWT), have been the subject of some research, but are typically not used in practical products (except for the use of [[wavelet compression|wavelet coding]] as still-image coders without motion compensation). Interest in fractal compression seems to be waning, due to recent theoretical analysis showing a comparative lack of effectiveness of such methods.<ref name=\"faxin47\"/>\n\n===== Inter-frame coding =====\n{{main article|inter frame}}\nInter-frame coding works by comparing each frame in the video with the previous one. Individual frames of a video sequence are compared from one frame to the next, and the [[video codec|video compression codec]] sends only the [[residual frame|differences]] to the reference frame. If the frame contains areas where nothing has moved, the system can simply issue a short command that copies that part of the previous frame into the next one. If sections of the frame move in a simple manner, the compressor can emit a (slightly longer) command that tells the decompressor to shift, rotate, lighten, or darken the copy. This longer command still remains much shorter than intraframe compression. Usually the encoder will also transmit a residue signal which describes the remaining more subtle differences to the reference imagery. Using entropy coding, these residue signals have a more compact representation than the full signal. In areas of video with more motion, the compression must encode more data to keep up with the larger number of pixels that are changing. Commonly during explosions, flames, flocks of animals, and in some panning shots, the high-frequency detail leads to quality decreases or to increases in the [[variable bitrate]].\n\n==== Hybrid block-based transform formats ====\n[[File:Hybrid video encoder processing stages.svg|thumb|upright=2|Processing stages of a typical video encoder]]\nToday, nearly all commonly used video compression methods (e.g., those in standards approved by the [[ITU-T]] or [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]) share the same basic architecture that dates back to [[H.261]] which was standardized in 1988 by the ITU-T. They mostly rely on the DCT, applied to rectangular blocks of neighboring pixels, and temporal prediction using [[motion vector]]s, as well as nowadays also an in-loop filtering step.\n\nIn the prediction stage, various deduplication and difference-coding techniques are applied that help decorrelate data and describe new data based on already transmitted data.\n\nThen rectangular blocks of (residue) [[pixel]] data are transformed to the frequency domain to ease targeting irrelevant information in quantization and for some spatial redundancy reduction. The [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) that is widely used in this regard was introduced by [[N. Ahmed]], T. Natarajan and [[K. R. Rao]] in 1974.<ref name=\"DCT\"/>\n\nIn the main lossy processing stage that data gets quantized in order to reduce information that is irrelevant to human visual perception.\n\nIn the last stage statistical redundancy gets largely eliminated by an [[entropy encoding|entropy coder]] which often applies some form of arithmetic coding.\n\nIn an additional in-loop filtering stage various filters can be applied to the reconstructed image signal. By computing these filters also inside the encoding loop they can help compression because they can be applied to reference material before it gets used in the prediction process and they can be guided using the original signal. The most popular example are [[deblocking filter]]s that blur out blocking artefacts from quantization discontinuities at transform block boundaries.\n\n==== History ====\nAll basic algorithms of today's dominant video codec architecture have been invented before 1979.\nIn 1950, the [[Bell Labs]] filed the patent on DPCM<ref name=\"DPCM\"/> which soon was applied to video coding. Entropy coding started in the 1940s with the introduction of [[Shannon\u2013Fano coding]]<ref name=\"Shannon\"/> on which the widely used [[Huffman coding]] is based that was developed in 1950;<ref name=\"Huffman\"/> the more modern [[context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding]] (CABAC) was published in the early 1990s.<ref name=\"CABAC\"/> Transform coding (using the [[Hadamard transform]]) was introduced in 1969,<ref name=\"Hadamard\"/> the popular discrete cosine transform (DCT) appeared in 1974 in scientific literature.<ref name=\"DCT\"/><ref name=\"patents\"/>\nThe ITU-T's standard [[H.261]] from 1988 introduced the prevalent basic architecture of video compression technology.\n\n===Genetics===\n{{see also|Compression of Genomic Re-Sequencing Data}}\n[[Compression of Genomic Re-Sequencing Data|Genetics compression algorithms]] are the latest generation of lossless algorithms that compress data (typically sequences of nucleotides) using both conventional compression algorithms and genetic algorithms adapted to the specific datatype. In 2012, a team of scientists from Johns Hopkins University published a genetic compression algorithm that does not use a reference genome for compression. HAPZIPPER was tailored for [[International HapMap Project|HapMap]] data and achieves over 20-fold compression (95% reduction in file size), providing 2- to 4-fold better compression and in much faster time than the leading general-purpose compression utilities. For this, Chanda, Elhaik, and Bader introduced MAF based encoding (MAFE), which reduces the heterogeneity of the dataset by sorting SNPs by their minor allele frequency, thus homogenizing the dataset.<ref name=\"HapZipper\"/> Other algorithms in 2009 and 2013 (DNAZip and GenomeZip) have compression ratios of up to 1200-fold\u2014allowing 6 billion basepair diploid human genomes to be stored in 2.5 megabytes (relative to a reference genome or averaged over many genomes).<ref name=\"genome email\"/><ref name=\"genome contracts\"/>. For a benchmark in genetics/genomics data compressors, see <ref name=\"Morteza\"/>\n\n== Outlook and currently unused potential ==\nIt is estimated that the total amount of data that is stored on the world's storage devices could be further compressed with existing compression algorithms by a remaining average factor of 4.5:1.{{citation needed | date = January 2017 | reason = 1,300 exabytes of worldwide data storage capacity appears to be a calculated value (4.5 x 295).

The [[Kingdom of Congo]] remained present in the region between the 14th and the early 19th centuries. [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian colonization]] began when [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] founded the [[Congo Free State]], a corporate state run solely by King Leopold. Reports of widespread murder and torture in the rubber plantations led the Belgian government to seize the Congo from Leopold II and establish the [[Belgian Congo]]. Under Belgian rule numerous [[Christianity|Christian organizations]] attempted to Westernize the Congolese people.\n\nAfter an uprising by the Congolese people, Belgium surrendered to the [[Congo Crisis|independence of the Congo]] in 1960. However, the Congo remained unstable because tribal leaders had more power than the central government. [[Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Prime Minister]] [[Patrice Lumumba]] tried to restore order with the aid of the [[Soviet Union]] as part of the [[Cold War]], causing the [[United States]] to support a coup led by Colonel [[Mobuto Sese Seko|Joseph Mobutu]] in 1965. Mobutu quickly seized complete power of the Congo and renamed the country [[Zaire]]. He sought to [[Africanization|Africanize]] the country, changing his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko, and demanded that African citizens change their Western names to traditional African names. Mobutu sought to repress any opposition to his rule, in which he successfully did throughout the 1980s. However, with his regime weakened in the 1990s, Mobutu was forced to agree to a power-sharing government with the opposition party. Mobutu remained the [[List of Presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|head of state]] and promised elections within the next two years that never took place.\n\nIn the [[First Congo War]], [[Rwanda]] invaded Zaire; Mobutu lost his power during this process. [[Laurent-Desire Kabila]] took power and renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo. After a disappointing rule under Kabila, the [[Second Congo War]] broke out, resulting in a regional war in which different African nations took part. Kabila was assassinated by his bodyguard in 2001, and his son, [[Joseph Kabila|Joseph]], succeeded him and was later [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006|elected president by the Congolese government]] in 2006. Kabila quickly sought peace. Foreign soldiers remained in the Congo for a few years and a power-sharing government between Kabila and the opposition party was set up. Kabila later resumed complete control over the Congo and was [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2011|re-elected in a disputed election]] in 2011. Today, the Congo remains dangerously unstable.\n\n==Early history==\n{{Main|Early Congolese history}}\n[[File:Mercator Congo map.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of the Kingdom of Kongo]]\nThe area now known as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] was populated as early as 80,000 years ago, as shown by the 1988 discovery of the [[Semliki harpoon]] at [[Katanda Territory|Katanda]], one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found, which is believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/katanda-bone-harpoon-point |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302062128/http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/katanda-bone-harpoon-point |archivedate=2 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1021659928822 | title=Barbed Bone Points: Tradition and Continuity in Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa | doi=10.1023/A:1021659928822 | volume=15 | year=1998 | journal=African Archaeological Review | pages=173\u2013198 | last1 = Yellen | first1 = John E. | accessdate=4 May 2018 }}</ref> During its recorded history, the area has also been known as ''Congo'', ''Congo Free State'', ''Belgian Congo'', and ''Zaire''. \n\nThe [[Kingdom of Kongo]] existed from the 14th to the early 19th century. Until the arrival of the Portuguese it was the dominant force in the region along with the [[Kingdom of Luba]], the [[Kingdom of Lunda]], the [[Mongo people]] and the [[Anziku Kingdom]].\n\n==Colonial rule==\n{{See also| Belgian overseas colonies}}\n===Congo Free State (1885\u20131908)===\n{{Main|Congo Free State}}\n[[File:MutilatedChildrenFromCongo.jpg|thumb|200px|Children mutilated during King Leopold II's rule]]\nThe Congo Free State was a [[corporate state]] privately controlled by [[Leopold II of Belgium]] through the ''[[International African Association|Association internationale africaine]]'', a non-governmental organization. Leopold was the sole shareholder and chairman. The state included the entire area of the present [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Under Leopold II, the Congo Free State became one of the most infamous international scandals of the turn of the twentieth century. The report of the British Consul [[Roger Casement]] led to the arrest and punishment of white officials who had been responsible for cold-blooded killings during a rubber-collecting expedition in 1900, including a Belgian national who caused the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives. Estimates of the total death toll vary considerably. The first census was only done in 1924, so it is even more difficult to quantify the population loss of the period. Roger Casement's famous 1904 report estimated ten million people. According to Casement's report, indiscriminate \"war\", starvation, reduction of births and [[tropical diseases]] caused the country's depopulation.<ref>[http://www.urome.be/fr2/reflexions/casemrepo.pdf Report of the British Consul, Roger Casement, on the Administration of the Congo Free State]</ref> European and U.S. press agencies exposed the conditions in the Congo Free State to the public in 1900. By 1908 public and diplomatic pressure had led Leopold II to annex the Congo as the [[Belgian Congo]] colony.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ewans|first1=Sir Martin|title=European atrocity, African catastrophe : Leopold II, the Congo Free State and its aftermath|date=2001|publisher=Curzon|location=Richmond|isbn=0700715894}}</ref>\n\n===Belgian Congo (1908\u201360)===\n{{Main|Belgian Congo}}\nOn 15 November 1908 [[L\u00e9opold II of Belgium|King L\u00e9opold II of Belgium]] formally relinquished personal control of the Congo Free State. The renamed Belgian Congo was put under the direct administration of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] government and its Ministry of Colonies.\n\nBelgian rule in the Congo was based around the \"colonial trinity\" (''trinit\u00e9 coloniale'') of [[Forms of government|state]], [[Christianity|missionary]] and [[Privately held company|private company]] interests.{{sfn|Turner|2007|p=28}} The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that large amounts of  [[Capital (economics)|capital]] flowed into the Congo and that individual regions became [[economic specialization|specialised]]. The interests of the government and private enterprise became closely tied; the state helped companies break strikes and remove other barriers imposed by the indigenous population.{{sfn|Turner|2007|p=28}} The country was split into nesting, hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions, and run uniformly according to a set \"native policy\" (''politique indig\u00e8ne'')\u2014in contrast to the British and the French, who generally favoured the system of [[indirect rule]] whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight. There was also a high degree of [[racial segregation]]. Large numbers of white immigrants who moved to the Congo after the end of [[World War II]] came from across the social spectrum, but were nonetheless always treated as superior to blacks.{{sfn|Turner|2007|p=29}}\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, the Congo experienced an unprecedented level of [[urbanisation]] and the colonial administration began various [[International development|development]] programmes aimed at making the territory into a \"model colony\".{{sfn|Freund|1998|pp=198\u20139}} Notable advances were made in treating diseases such as [[African trypanosomiasis]]. One of the results of these measures was the development of a new middle class of Europeanised African ''[[\u00e9volu\u00e9]]s'' in the cities.{{sfn|Freund|1998|pp=198\u20139}} By the 1950s the Congo had a [[wage labour]] force twice as large as that in any other African colony.{{sfn|Freund|1998|p=198}} The Congo's rich natural resources, including uranium\u2014[[Belgian Congo in World War II#Uranium|much of the uranium]] used by the U.S. nuclear programme during World War II was Congolese\u2014led to substantial interest in the region from both the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States as the [[Cold War]] developed.{{sfn|Borstelmann|1993|pp=92\u20133}}\n\n=== Rise in Congolese political activity ===\n{{see also|Belgian Congo in World War II}}\nDuring the latter stages of World War II a new social stratum emerged in the Congo, known as the ''[[\u00e9volu\u00e9]]''s. Forming an African middle class in the colony, they held skilled positions (such as clerks and nurses) made available by the economic boom. While there were no universal criteria for determining ''\u00e9volu\u00e9 status'', it was generally accepted that one would have \"a good knowledge of French, adhere to Christianity, and have some form of post-primary education.\"{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=70}} Early on in their history, most ''\u00e9volu\u00e9''s sought to use their unique status to earn special privileges in the Congo.{{sfn|Willame|1972|p=24}} Since opportunities for upward mobility through the colonial structure were limited, the ''\u00e9volu\u00e9'' class institutionally manifested itself in elite clubs through which they could enjoy trivial privileges that made them feel distinct from the Congolese \"masses\".{{sfn|Willame|1972|p=25}} Additional groups, such as labour unions, alumni associations, and ethnic syndicates, provided other Congolese the means of organisation.{{sfn|Young|1965|p=291}} Among the most important of these was the [[Alliance des Bakongo]] (ABAKO), representing the [[Kongo people]] of the Lower Congo.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=22}} However, they were restricted in their actions by the administration. While white settlers were consulted in the appointment of certain officials, the Congolese had no means of expressing their beliefs through the governing structures.{{sfn|Young|1965|p=29}} Though native chiefs held legal authority in some jurisdictions, in practice they were used by the administration to further its own policies.{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=51}}\n\nUp into the 1950s most ''\u00e9volu\u00e9''s were concerned only with social inequalities and their treatment by the Belgians. Questions of self-government were not considered until 1954, when ABAKO requested that the administration consider a list of suggested candidates for a L\u00e9opoldville municipal post.{{sfn|Young|1965|pp=274\u2013275}} That year the association was taken over by [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]], and under his leadership it became increasingly hostile to the colonial authority and sought autonomy for the Kongo regions in the Lower Congo.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=22\u201323}} In 1956 a group of Congolese intellectuals under the tutelage of several European academics issued a manifesto calling for a transition to independence over the course of 30 years. The ABAKO quickly responded with a demand for \"immediate independence\".{{sfn|Young|1965|p=276}} The Belgian government was not prepared to grant the Congo independence and even when it started realising the necessity of a plan for decolonisation in 1957, it was assumed that such a process would be solidly controlled by Belgium.{{sfn|Young|1965|pp=36\u201337}} In December 1957 the colonial administration instituted reforms that permitted municipal elections and the formation of political parties. Some Belgian parties attempted to establish branches in the colony, but these were largely ignored by the population in favour of Congolese-initiated groups.{{sfn|Young|1965|pp=296\u2013297}} [[Nationalism]] fermented in 1958 as more ''\u00e9volu\u00e9''s began interacting with others outside of their own locales and started discussing the future structures of a post-colonial Congolese state.{{sfn|Young|1965|p=277}} Nevertheless, most political mobilisation occurred along tribal and regional divisions.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2002|p=84}} In Katanga, various tribal groups came together to form the [[CONAKAT|Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des associations tribales du Katanga]] (CONAKAT) under the leadership of [[Godefroid Munongo]] and [[Mo\u00efse Tshombe]]. Hostile to immigrant peoples, it advocated provincial autonomy and close ties with Belgium. Most of its support was rooted in individual chiefs, businessmen, and European settlers of southern Katanga.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=25\u201327}} It was opposed by [[Jason Sendwe]]'s Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba de Katanga (BALUBAKAT).{{sfn|Lemarchand|1964|p=241}}\n\n[[File:Patrice Lumumba in 1958.jpg|thumb|[[Patrice Lumumba]], founding member and leader of the MNC]]\nIn October 1958 a group of L\u00e9opoldville ''\u00e9volu\u00e9''s including [[Patrice Lumumba]], [[Cyrille Adoula]] and [[Joseph Il\u00e9o]] established the [[Mouvement National Congolais]] (MNC). Diverse in membership, the party sought to peacefully achieve Congolese independence, promote the political education of the populace, and eliminate regionalism.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=27}} The MNC drew most of its membership from the residents of the eastern city of [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]], where Lumumba was well known, and from the population of the [[Kasai region|Kasai Province]], where efforts were directed by a [[Luba people|Muluba]] businessman, [[Albert Kalonji]].{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=29}} Belgian officials appreciated its moderate and anti-separatist stance and allowed Lumumba to attend the [[All-African Peoples' Conference]] in [[Accra]], Ghana, in December 1958 (Kasa-Vubu was informed that the documents necessary for his travel to the event were not in order and was not permitted to go{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=23}}). Lumumba was deeply impressed by the [[Pan-Africanist]] ideals of Ghanaian President [[Kwame Nkrumah]] and returned to the Congo with a more radical party programme.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=28}} He reported on his trip during a widely-attended rally in L\u00e9opoldville and demanded the country's \"genuine\" independence.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2002|p=84}}\n\nFearing that they were being overshadowed by Lumumba and the MNC, Kasa-Vubu and the ABAKO leadership announced that they would be hosting their own rally in the capital on 4 January 1959.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2002|p=84}} The municipal government (under Belgian domination) was given short notice, and communicated that only a \"private meeting\" would be authorised. On the scheduled day of the rally the ABAKO leadership told the crowd that had gathered that the event was postponed and that they should disperse. The mass was infuriated and instead began hurling stones at the police and pillaging European property, initiating three days of [[L\u00e9opoldville riots|violent and destructive riots]].{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2002|p=85}} The [[Force Publique]], the colonial army, was called into service and suppressed the revolt with considerable brutality.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=10}} In wake of the riots Kasa-Vubu and his lieutenants were arrested. Unlike earlier expressions of discontent, the grievances were conveyed primarily by uneducated urban residents, not ''\u00e9volu\u00e9''s.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2002|p=86}} Popular opinion in Belgium was one of extreme shock and surprise. An investigative commission found the riots to be the culmination of racial discrimination, overcrowding, unemployment, and wishes for more political self-determination. On 13 January the administration announced several reforms, and the Belgian King, [[Baudouin of Belgium|Baudouin]], declared that independence would be granted to the Congo in the future.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=10}}\n\nMeanwhile, discontent surfaced among the MNC leadership, who were bothered by Lumumba's domination over the party's politics. Relations between Lumumba and Kalonji also grew tense, as the former was upset with how the latter was transforming the Kasai branch into an exclusively Luba group and antagonising other tribes. This culminated into the split of the party into the MNC-Lumumba/MNC-L under Lumumba and the MNC-Kalonji/MNC-K under Kalonji and Il\u00e9o. The latter began advocating federalism. Adoula left the organisation.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=29}} Alone to lead his own faction and facing competition from ABAKO, Lumumba became increasingly strident in his demands for independence. Following an October riot in Stanleyville he was arrested. Nevertheless, the influence of himself and the MNC-L continued to grow rapidly. The party advocated for a strong unitary state, nationalism, and the termination of Belgian rule and began forming alliances with regional groups, such as the Kivu-based Centre du Regroupement Africain (CEREA).{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=30}} Though the Belgians supported a unitary system over the federal models suggested by ABAKO and CONAKAT, they and more moderate Congolese were unnerved by Lumumba's increasingly extremist attitudes. With the implicit support of the colonial administration, the moderates formed the Parti National du Progr\u00e8s (PNP) under the leadership of [[Paul Bolya]] and [[Albert Delvaux]]. It advocated centralisation, respect for traditional elements, and close ties with Belgium.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=31}} In southern L\u00e9opoldville Province, a socialist-federalist party, the [[Parti Solidaire Africain]] (PSA) was founded. [[Antoine Gizenga]] served as its president, and [[Cl\u00e9ophas Kamitatu]] was in charge of the L\u00e9opoldville Province chapter.{{sfn|Merriam|1961|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\n==Independence and the Congo Crisis (1960\u201365)==\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\nFollowing the riots in Leopoldville 4\u20137 January 1959, and in Stanleyville on 31 October 1959, the Belgians realised they could not maintain control of such a vast country in the face of rising demands for independence. Belgian and Congolese political leaders held a [[Round Table Conference]] in Brussels beginning on 18 January 1960. \n\nAt the end of the conference, on 27 January 1960, it was announced that [[Belgian Congo general election, 1960|elections would be held in the Congo on 22 May 1960]], and full independence granted on 30 June 1960. The elections produced the nationalist [[Patrice Lumumba]] as prime minister, and [[Joseph Kasavubu]] as president.\nOn independence the country adopted the name \"[[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]]\" (R\u00e9publique du Congo). The French colony of [[Republic of the Congo|Middle Congo]] (Moyen Congo) also chose the name Republic of Congo upon its independence, so the two countries are more commonly known as [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Congo-L\u00e9opoldville]] and [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]], after their capital cities. \n\nIn 1960, the country was very unstable\u2014regional tribal leaders held far more power than the central government\u2014and with the departure of the Belgian administrators, almost no skilled bureaucrats remained in the country. The first Congolese graduated university only in 1956, and very few in the new nation had any idea how to manage a country of such size.\n\nOn 5 July 1960, [[Mutiny of the Force Publique|a military mutiny by Congolese soldiers against their European officers]] broke out in the capital and rampant looting began. On 11 July 1960 the richest province of the country, [[State of Katanga|Katanga]], seceded under [[Moise Tshombe]]. The [[United Nations]] sent 20,000 peacekeepers to protect Europeans in the country and try to restore order. Western paramilitaries and mercenaries, often hired by mining companies to protect their interests, also began to pour into the country. In this period Congo's second richest province, [[South Kasai|Kasai]], also announced its independence on 8 August 1960.\n\nAfter trying to get help from the United States and the United Nations, Prime Minister Lumumba turned to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] for assistance. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] agreed to help, offering advanced weaponry and technical advisors.  The [[United States]] viewed the Soviet presence as an attempt to take advantage of the situation and gain a proxy state in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. UN forces were ordered to block any shipments of arms into the country. The United States also looked for a way to replace Lumumba as leader. President Kasavubu had clashed with Prime Minister Lumumba and advocated an alliance with the West rather than the Soviets. The U.S. sent weapons and CIA personnel to aid forces allied with Kasavubu and combat the Soviet presence. On 14 September 1960, with U.S. and [[CIA]] support, Colonel Joseph Mobutu [[1960 Democratic Republic of the Congo coup d'\u00e9tat|overthrew the government]] and arrested Lumumba. A technocratic government, the [[College of Commissioners-General]], was established.\n\nOn 17 January 1961 Mobutu sent Lumumba to \u00c9lisabethville (now [[Lubumbashi]]), capital of Katanga. In full view of the press he was beaten and forced to eat copies of his own speeches. For three weeks afterward, he was not seen or heard from. Then Katangan radio announced implausibly that he had escaped and been killed by  villagers. It was soon clear that in fact he had been tortured and killed along with two others shortly after his arrival. In 2001, a Belgian inquiry established that he had been shot by Katangan gendarmes in the presence of Belgian officers, under Katangan command. Lumumba was beaten, placed in front of a firing squad with two allies, cut up, buried, dug up and what remained was dissolved in acid.<ref>De Witte, Ludo: ''The Assassination of Lumumba'', Verso, 2001.</ref>\n\nIn [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]], those loyal to the deposed Lumumba set up a rival government under [[Antoine Gizenga]] which lasted from 31 March 1961 until it was reintegrated on 5 August 1961. After some reverses, UN and Congolese government forces succeeded in recapturing the breakaway provinces of [[South Kasai]] on 30 December 1961, and [[State of Katanga|Katanga]] on 15 January 1963.\n\nA new crisis erupted in the [[Simba Rebellion]] of 1964-1965 which saw half the country taken by the rebels. European mercenaries, US, and Belgian troops were called in by the Congolese government to defeat the rebellion.\n\n==Zaire (1965\u201397)==\n[[File:Mobutu.jpg|thumb|200px|Mobutu Sese Seko]]\nUnrest and rebellion plagued the government until November 1965, when [[Mobuto Sese Seko|Lieutenant General Joseph-Desire Mobutu]], by then commander in chief of the national army, [[1965 Democratic Republic of the Congo coup d'\u00e9tat|seized control of the country]] and declared himself president for five years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/world/africa/651125kasavubu.html|title=Kasavubu Regime Ousted By Army Coup in Congo|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2018-09-25}}</ref> Mobutu quickly consolidated his power, despite the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] of 1966 and 1967,<ref>Anthony Mockler, 'The New Mercenaries,' Corgi Books, 1985, {{ISBN|0-552-12558-X}}</ref> and was elected unopposed as president in 1970. \n\nEmbarking on a campaign of cultural awareness, President Mobutu renamed the country the Republic of [[Zaire]] in 1971 and required citizens to adopt African names and drop their French-language ones. The name comes from Portuguese, adapted from the Kongo word nzere or nzadi (\"river that swallows all rivers\").<ref>Forbath, Peter (1977).

These rebels were driven out with the aid of French and Belgian paratroopers plus Moroccan troops. An [[Inter-African Force]] remained in the region for some time afterwards.\n\nZaire remained a one-party state in the 1980s. Although Mobutu successfully maintained control during this period, opposition parties, most notably the [[Union for Democracy and Social Progress (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|Union pour la D\u00e9mocratie et le Progr\u00e8s Social]] (UDPS), were active. Mobutu's attempts to quell these groups drew significant international criticism.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zeilig|first1=Leo|last2=Dwyer|first2=Peter|title=African Struggles Today: Social Movements Since Independence|date=2012|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=978-1608461202|page=170}}</ref>\n\nAs the [[Cold War]] came to a close, internal and external pressures on Mobutu increased. In late 1989 and early 1990, Mobutu was weakened by a series of domestic protests, by heightened international criticism of his regime's human rights practices, by a faltering economy, and by government corruption, most notably his own massive [[embezzlement]] of government funds for personal use.\n\nIn April 1990, Mobutu declared the Third Republic, agreeing to a limited multi-party system with elections and a constitution. As details of the reforms were delayed, soldiers in September 1991 began looting [[Kinshasa]] to protest their unpaid wages. Two thousand French and Belgian troops, some of whom were flown in on [[U.S. Air Force]] planes, arrived to evacuate the 20,000 endangered foreign nationals in Kinshasa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/1991/10/23/world/new-riots-in-zaire-300-are-evacuated.html|title=New Riots in Zaire: 300 Are Evacuated |date=October 23, 1991 |agency=Reuters |publisher=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, after previous similar attempts, the long-promised Sovereign National Conference was staged, encompassing over 2,000 representatives from various political parties. The conference gave itself a legislative mandate and elected Archbishop [[Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya]] as its chairman, along with [[\u00c9tienne Tshisekedi wa Mulumba]], leader of the UDPS, as prime minister. By the end of the year Mobutu had created a rival government with its own prime minister. The ensuing stalemate produced a compromise merger of the two governments into the [[High Council of Republic-Parliament of Transition]] (HCR-PT) in 1994, with Mobutu as head of state and [[Kengo Wa Dondo]] as prime minister. Although presidential and legislative elections were scheduled repeatedly over the next two years, they never took place.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\n==Civil Wars (1996-2003)==\n===First Congo War (1996\u201397)===\n{{Main|First Congo War|Great Lakes refugee crisis}}\nBy 1996, tensions from the war and [[genocide]] in neighboring [[Rwanda]] had spilled over into [[Zaire]]. Rwandan [[Hutu]] militia forces ([[Interahamwe]]) who had fled Rwanda following the ascension of a [[Tutsi]]-led government had been using Hutu refugee camps in eastern Zaire as bases for incursions into Rwanda. In October 1996\nRwandan forces attacked refugee camps in the [[Rusizi River]] plain near the intersection of the Congolese, Rwandan and Burundi borders meet, scattering refugees. They took [[Uvira]], then [[Bukavu]], [[Goma]] and Mugunga.<ref>{{cite book|via=Google Books \n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAHGTnNu8KIC\n|page=23\n|title=Dancing in the Glory of Monsters: The Collapse of the Congo and the Great War of Africa\n|author=Jason Stearns\n|publisher=PublicAffairs |year=2012\n|ISBN=1610391594}}</ref>\n\nHutu militia forces soon allied with the Zairian armed forces (FAZ) to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaire. In turn, these Tutsis formed a militia to defend themselves against attacks. When the Zairian government began to escalate the massacres in November 1996, Tutsi militias erupted in rebellion against Mobutu.\n\nThe Tutsi militia was soon joined by various opposition groups and supported by several countries, including Rwanda and Uganda. This coalition, led by [[Laurent-Desire Kabila]], became known as the [[Alliance des Forces D\u00e9mocratiques pour la Lib\u00e9ration du Congo-Za\u00efre]] (AFDL). The AFDL, now seeking the broader goal of ousting Mobutu, made significant military gains in early 1997. Various Zairean politicians who had unsuccessfully opposed the dictatorship of Mobutu for many years now saw an opportunity for them in the invasion of Zaire by two of the region's strongest military forces. Following failed peace talks between Mobutu and Kabila in May 1997, Mobutu left the country, and Kabila marched unopposed to Kinshasa on 20 May. Kabila named himself president, consolidated power around himself and the AFDL, and reverted the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n===Second Congo War (1998\u20132003)===\n{{Main|Second Congo War|International Criminal Court investigation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}\nKabila demonstrated little ability to manage the problems of his country, and lost his allies. To counterbalance the power and influence of Rwanda in DRC, Ugandan troops created another rebel movement called the [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] (MLC), led by the Congolese warlord [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]]. They attacked in August 1998, backed by Rwandan and Ugandan troops. Soon afterwards, Angola, Namibia, and Zimbabwe became involved militarily in the Congo, with Angola and Zimbabwe supporting the government. While the six African governments involved in the war signed a ceasefire accord in [[Lusaka]] in July 1999, the Congolese rebels did not and the ceasefire broke down within months. \n\nKabila was assassinated in 2001 by  a bodyguard called Rashidi Kasereka, 18, who was then shot dead, according to Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo. Another account of the assassination says that the real killer escaped.<ref>{{cite web|title=Revealed: how Africa's dictator died at the hands of his boy soldiers: President Laurent Kabila's blind faith in his teenage warriors was a fatal error |author=Stuart Jeffries | date=10 February 2001 |publisher=Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/11/theobserver}}</ref>\n\nKabila was succeeded by his son, [[Joseph Kabila|Joseph]]. Upon taking office, Kabila called for multilateral peace talks to end the war. Kabila partly succeeded when a further peace deal was brokered between him, Uganda, and Rwanda leading to the apparent withdrawal of foreign troops.\n\nCurrently,{{when|date=June 2018}} the Ugandans and the MLC still hold a {{convert|200|mi|km|adj=on}} wide section of the north of the country; Rwandan forces and its front, the [[Rassemblement Congolais pour la D\u00e9mocratie]] (RCD) control a large section of the east; and government forces or their allies hold the west and south of the country. There were reports that the conflict is being prolonged as a cover for extensive looting of the substantial natural resources in the country, including [[diamond]]s, [[copper]], [[zinc]], and [[coltan]]. The conflict was reignited in January 2002 by ethnic clashes in the northeast and both Uganda and Rwanda then halted their withdrawal and sent in more troops. Talks between Kabila and the rebel leaders, held in [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]], lasted a full six weeks, beginning in April 2002. In June, they signed a peace accord under which Kabila would share power with former rebels. By June 2003, all foreign armies except those of Rwanda had pulled out of Congo. \n\nFew people in the Congo  have been unaffected by the conflict. A survey conducted in 2009 by the ICRC and Ipsos shows that three quarters (76%) of the people interviewed have been affected in some way\u2013either personally or due to the wider consequences of armed conflict.<ref>[http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/views-from-field-report-240609/$File/Our-World-Views-from-DRC-I-ICRC.pdf DRC, Opinion survey 2009], by ICRC and Ipsos</ref>\n\nThe response of the international community has been incommensurate with the scale of the disaster resulting from the war in the Congo. Its support for political and diplomatic efforts to end the war has been relatively consistent, but it has taken no effective steps to abide by repeated pledges to demand accountability for the war crimes and crimes against humanity that were routinely committed in Congo. \nThe [[United Nations Security Council]] and the U.N. Secretary-General have frequently denounced human rights abuses and the humanitarian disaster that the war unleashed on the local population, but have shown little will to tackle the responsibility of occupying powers for the atrocities taking place in areas under their control, areas where the worst violence in the country took place. In particular Rwanda and Uganda have escaped any significant sanction for their role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2002/08/20/war-crimes-kisangani-0 |title=Human Rights Watch: War Crimes in Kisangani |publisher=Hrw.org |date=20 August 2002 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Joseph Kabila period==\n===Transitional government (2003\u201306)===\n{{Main|Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006}}\nDR Congo had a [[Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|transitional government]] in July 2003 until the election was over.

[[Joseph Kabila]] took 45% of the votes and his opponent Jean-Pierre Bemba 20%. That was the origin of a fight between the two parties from  20\u201322 August 2006 in the streets of the capital, [[Kinshasa]]. Sixteen people died before policemen and  MONUC took control of the city. A new election was held on 29 October 2006, which Kabila won with 70% of the vote.

There are over 200 ethnic languages.\n\nFrench is generally the medium of instruction in schools. English is taught as a compulsory foreign language in Secondary and High School around the country. It is a required subject in the Faculty of Economics at major universities around the country and there are numerous language schools in the country that teach it. In the town of Beni, for instance, there is a Bilingual University that offer courses in both French and English. President Kabila himself is fluent in both English and French, as was his father.\n\n==Religions==\nA survey conducted by the [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] program in 2013-2014 indicated that Christians constituted 93.7% of the population (Catholics 29.7%, Protestants 26.8%, and other Christians 37.2%).

Immigration is seen to be very diverse in nature, with refugees and asylum-seekers - products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the Great Lakes Region - constituting an important subset of the population in the country.<ref name=\"IOMProfile\"/>\n\nAdditionally, the country\u2019s large mine operations attract migrant workers from Africa and beyond and there is considerable migration for commercial activities from other African countries and the rest of the world, but these movements are not well studied. Transit migration towards South Africa and Europe also plays a role. Immigration in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]] has decreased steadily over the past two decades, most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced.<ref name=\"IOMProfile\"/>\n\nAccording to the [[International Organization for Migration]], the number of [[immigration|immigrants]] in the DRC has declined from just over 1 million in 1960, to 754,000 in 1990, to 480,000 in 2005, to an estimated 445,000 in 2010. Valid figures are not available on migrant workers in particular, partly due to the predominance of the [[informal economy]] in the DRC. Data are also lacking on irregular immigrants, however given neighbouring country ethnic links to nationals of the DRC, irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon in the country.<ref name=\"IOMProfile\">{{Cite document|url=http://publications.iom.int/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=41_42&products_id=592|publisher=International Organization for Migration|title=Migration en R\u00e9publique D\u00e9mocratique du Congo: Profil national 2009|year=2009|accessdate=2010-08-17}}</ref>\n\nFigures on the number of Congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source, from 3 to 6 million. This discrepancy is due to a lack of official, reliable data.

Political agendas have worsened the economy, as in times of crisis, the elite benefit while the general populace suffers. This is worsened as a result of corrupt national and international corporations. The corporations instigate and allow the fighting for resources because they benefit from it. A large proportion of fatalities in the country are attributed to a lack of basic services, which is a reflection of the treatment of the citizens of the DRC. The influx of refugees since the war in 1998 only serves to worsen the issue of poverty. Money of the taxpayers in the DRC is often misappropriated by the corrupt leaders of the country, who often use the money to benefit themselves instead of the citizens of the DRC.

The corporations that dominated the economy were mostly owned by [[Belgium]], but [[United Kingdom|British]] capital also played an important role. Independence caused the Congo to become the most industrialized country in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], after [[South Africa]]. The 1950s were a period of rising income and expectations. Congo was said to have the best public health system in Africa, but there was also a huge wealth disparity. Belgian companies favored workers in certain areas more and exported them to work in different areas, restricting opportunities for others. Favored groups also received better education and were able to secure jobs for people in the same ethnic group which increased tensions. In 1960 there were only 16 university graduates out of a population of 20 million. [[Belgium]] still had economic power and independence gave little opportunity for improvement. Common refrains included \"no elite, no trouble\" and \"before independence = after independence\". When the Belgians left, most of the government officials and educated residents left with them. Before independence there were just 3 out of 5000 government jobs held by Congolese people.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Joe Trapido: Africa\u2019s Leaky Giant.

Phase I was the precursor to the actual investment in the Special Economic Zone where policymakers agreed to the framework, the framework was studied for its establishment, and to predict the potential market demand for the land. Stage one of Phase II involved submitting laws for the Special Economic Zone, finding good sites for businesses, and currently there is an effort to help the government attract foreign investment. Stage two of Phase II hasn\u2019t been started yet and it involves assisting the government in creating framework for the country, creating an overall plan for the site, figuring out what the environmental impact of the project will be, and guessing how much it will cost and what the return can be made on the investment. Phase III involves the World Bank creating a transaction phase that will keep everything competitive. The program is looking for options to hand over the program to the World Bank which could be very beneficial for the western part of the country.\n\n== Data ==\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=79&pr.y=9&sy=1980&ey=2023&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=636&s=NGDP_RPCH,PPPGDP,PPPPC,PCPIPCH,GGXWDG_NGDP&grp=0&a=|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-08-25|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=en-US|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Year\n!1980\n!1985\n!1990\n!1995\n!2000\n!2005\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n|-\n|GDP in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|19.62 Bln.\n|27.16 Bln.\n|31.58 Bln.\n|24.37 Bln.\n|20.34 Bln.\n|27.55 Bln.\n|29.90 Bln.\n|32.61 Bln.\n|35.33 Bln.\n|36.62 Bln.\n|39.70 Bln.\n|43.30 Bln.\n|47.22 Bln.\n|52.05 Bln.\n|58.01 Bln.\n|62.70 Bln.\n|65.02 Bln.\n|68.45 Bln.\n|-\n|GDP per capita in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|683\n|804\n|795\n|522\n|388\n|453\n|478\n|506\n|532\n|535\n|563\n|597\n|632\n|676\n|732\n|768\n|773\n|790\n|-\n|GDP growth<br /><small>(real)</small>\n|2.4 %\n|0.5 %\n|\u22126.6 %\n|2.8 %\n|\u22128.1 %\n|6.1 %\n|5.3 %\n|6.3 %\n|6.2 %\n|2.9 %\n|7.1 %\n|6.9 %\n|7.1 %\n|8.5 %\n|9.5 %\n|6.9 %\n|2.4 %\n|3.4 %\n|-\n|Inflation<br /><small>(in Percent)</small>\n|40.0 %\n|23.5 %\n|81.3 %\n|541.8 %\n|550.0 %\n|21.5 %\n|12.8 %\n|16.7 %\n|18.0 %\n|46.1 %\n|23.5 %\n|15.0 %\n|0.9 %\n|0.9 %\n|1.2 %\n|1.0 %\n|18.2 %\n|41.5 %\n|-\n|Unemployment rate<br /><small>(in Percent)</small>\n|...\n|...\n|...\n|...\n|135 %\n|101 %\n|104 %\n|87 %\n|74 %\n|85 %\n|31 %\n|25 %\n|23 %\n|20 %\n|18 %\n|16 %\n|17 %\n|16 %\n|}\n\n==Economic implications of instability==\nOngoing conflicts dramatically reduced government [[revenue]] and increased external debt. As Reyntjens wrote, \"Entrepreneurs of insecurity are engaged in extractive activities that would be impossible in a stable state environment. The criminalization context in which these activities occur offers avenues for considerable factional and personal enrichment through the trafficking of arms, illegal drugs, toxic products, mineral resources and dirty money.\" Ethnic rivalries were made worse because of economic interests and [[looting]] and coltan smuggling took place. Illegal [[monopoly|monopolies]] formed in the country where they used forced labor for children to mine or work as soldiers. National parks were overrun with people looking to exploit minerals and resources. Increased poverty and hunger from the war and that increased the hunting of rare wildlife. Education was denied when the country was under foreign control and very few people make money off the minerals in the country. The national resources are not the root cause for the continued fighting in the region, however, the competition has become an incentive to keep fighting.[1] The DRC\u2019s level of economic freedom is one of the lowest in the world, putting it in the repressed category. The armed militias fight with the government in the eastern section of the country over the mining sector or the corruption of the government, and weak policies lead to the instability of the economy. [[Human rights]] abuses also ruin economic activity; the DRC has a 7% unemployment rate, but still has one of the lowest GDP\u2019s per capita in the world. A major problem for people trying to start their own companies is that the minimum amount of capital needed to launch the company is 5 times the average annual income, and prices are regulated by the government, which almost forces people to have to work for the larger, more corrupt businesses; otherwise, they won\u2019t have work. It is hard for the DRC to encourage foreign trade because of the regulatory barriers.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Democratic Republic of Congo  Economy: Population, GDP, Inflation, Business, Trade, FDI, Corruption|url = http://www.heritage.org/index/country/democraticrepubliccongo|website = www.heritage.org|accessdate = 2017-02-24}}</ref>\n\n==International Relations==\n[[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IBRD) Trust Fund for the Congo.\nPoor [[infrastructure]], an uncertain legal framework, corruption, and lack of openness in government economic policy and financial operations remain a brake on investment and growth. A number of [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[World Bank]] missions have met with the new government to help it develop a coherent economic plan but associated reforms are on hold.\n\nFaced with continued currency depreciation, the government resorted to more drastic measures and in January 1999 banned the widespread use of U.S. dollars for all domestic commercial transactions, a position it later adjusted. The government has been unable to provide foreign exchange for economic transactions, while it has resorted to printing money to finance its expenditure. Growth was negative in 2000 because of the difficulty of meeting the conditions of international donors, continued low prices of key exports, and post-coup instability. 125 companies in 2003 contributed to the conflict in DRC showing the corruption.\n\n===World Bank===\nWith the help of the International Development Association the DRC has worked toward the reestablishment of social services. This is done by giving 15 million people access to basic health services and giving bed nets to prevent malaria from spreading to people. With the Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Program more than 107,000 adults and 34,000 child soldiers stood down their militarized posture. The travel time from Lubumbashi to Kasomeno in Katanga went down from seven days to two hours because of the improved roads which led to the decrease of prices of main goods by 60%. With the help of the IFC, KfW, and the EU the DRC improved its businesses by reducing the time it took to create a business by 51%, reducing the time it took to get construction permits by 54%, and reducing the number of taxes from 118 to 30. Improvements in health have been noticeable specifically that deliveries attended by trained staff jumped from 47 to 80%. In education 14 million textbooks were provided to children, completion rates of school have increased, and higher education was made available to students that chose to pursue it.<ref>{{Cite web|title = News & Broadcast - Democratic Republic of Congo: Country Results Profile|url = http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:23169309~menuPK:141310~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html|website = web.worldbank.org|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}</ref>\n\n====Ease of Doing Business Rank (EDBR)====\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo ranks 183 on the low end of the ease of doing business scale as ranked by the World Bank.

Food crops include [[cassava]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[maize]], [[Bambara groundnut|groundnuts]], and [[rice]]. In 1996, agriculture employed 66% of the work force.\n\n===Fishing===\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo also possesses 50 percent of Africa\u2019s forests and a river system that could provide [[hydro-electric]] power to the entire continent, according to a [[United Nations]] report on the country\u2019s strategic significance and its potential role as an economic power in [[central Africa]].<ref>[http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=69718 Democratic Republic of the Congo economic and strategic significance]</ref> Fish are the single most important source of animal protein in the DRC. Total production of marine, river, and lake fisheries in 2003 was estimated at 222,965 tons, all but 5,000 tons from inland waters. PEMARZA, a state agency, carries on marine fishing.\n\n===Forestry===\n{{See also|Deforestation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}\n\nForests cover 60 percent of the total land area. There are vast [[timber]] resources, and commercial development of the country\u2019s 61 million hectares (150 million acres) of exploitable wooded area is only beginning. The [[Mayumbe area]] of [[Bas-Congo]] was once the major center of timber exploitation, but forests in this area were nearly\ndepleted. The more extensive forest regions of the central cuvette and of the [[Ubangi River]] valley have increasingly been tapped.\n\nRoundwood removals were estimated at 72,170,000 m<sup>2</sup> in 2003, about 95 percent for fuel. Some 14 species are presently being harvested. Exports of forest products in 2003 totalled $25.7 million. Foreign capital is necessary in order for forestry to expand, and the government recognizes that changes in tax structure and export procedures will be needed to facilitate economic growth.\n\n===Mining===\n{{Main|Mining industry of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}\n\n[[File:Tree map exports 2009 DRCongo.jpeg|thumb|350px|Graphical depiction of DRCongo's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]\nRich in minerals, the DRC has a difficult history of predatory [[Mining industry of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|mineral extraction]], which has been at the heart of many struggles within the country for many decades, but particularly in the 1990s.

The voting process, though technically difficult due to the lack of [[infrastructure]], was facilitated and organized by the Congolese Independent Electoral Commission with support from the UN mission to the Congo (MONUC). Early UN reports indicate that the voting was for the most part peaceful, but spurred violence in many parts of the war-torn east and the Kasais.\n\nIn 2006, many Congolese complained that the constitution was a rather ambiguous document and were unaware of its contents. This is due in part to the high rates of illiteracy in the country. However, interim President Kabila urged Congolese to vote 'Yes', saying the constitution is the country's best hope for peace in the future. 25 million Congolese turned out for the two-day balloting.<ref> [http://allafrica.com/stories/200512200142.html]</ref><ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/200512190746.html]</ref> According to results released in January 2006, the constitution was approved by 84% of voters.<ref> [http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/01/12/congo.constitution.ap/]</ref> The new constitution also aims to decentralize authority, dividing the vast nation into 25 semi-autonomous provinces, drawn along ethnic and cultural lines.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/africa/01/12/congo.constitution.ap/]</ref>\n\nThe country's first democratic elections in four decades were held on 30 July 2006.\n\n==Political history==\n{{See also|History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}\n\nFrom the day of the arguably ill-prepared independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the tensions between the powerful leaders of the political elite, such as [[Joseph Kasa Vubu]], [[Patrice Lumumba]], [[Moise Tshombe]], [[Joseph Mobutu]] and others, jeopardize the political stability of the new state. From Tshombe's secession of the Katanga, to the assassination of Lumumba, to the two [[coups d'\u00e9tat]] of Mobutu, the country has known periods of true nationwide peace, but virtually no period of genuine democratic rule.\n\n===The Mobutu era===\nThe Regime of '''[[Mobutu|Marshall Mobutu Sese Seko]]''' lasted 32 years (1965\u20131997), during which all but the first seven years the country was named [[Zaire]]. The dictatorial regime operated as a one-party-state, which saw most of the powers concentrated between President Mobutu, who was simultaneously the head of the state-party ([[Popular Movement of the Revolution]]), and a series of essentially rubber-stamping institutions.\n\nOne particularity of the Regime was the claim to be thriving for an ''authentic'' system, different from Western, or Soviet influences. This lasted roughly between the establishment of Zaire in 1971, and the official beginning of the transition towards democracy, on 24 April 1990. This was true at the regular people's level as everywhere else. People were ordered by law to drop their Western Christian names; the titles Mr. and Mrs. were abandoned for the male and female versions of the French word for \"citizen\"; Men were forbidden to wear suits, and women to wear pants. At the institutional level, many of the institutions also changed denominations, but the end result was a system that borrowed from both systems:\n\n*The party '''Central Committee''': The country being a one-party-state, this committee had a higher position in the institutional make-up than the government or cabinet. It had both executive oversight authority, and in practice, binding legislative authority, as it dictated the party platform. The committee was headed by Mobutu. The Vice-President of the committee was essentially the country's Vice-President, without the succession rights.\n*The '''Executive Council''': known elsewhere as the Government or the Cabinet. This was the executive authority in the country, made of '''State Commissioners''' (known elsewhere as ministers). For a long period of time, Mobutu was the sole leader of the Executive Council. He eventually started appointing '''[[Heads of government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|First State Commissioners]]''' (known elsewhere as [[Prime ministers]]), with largely coordinating powers, and very little executive power. The last \"First State Commissioner\" was [[Kengo Wa Dondo]].\n*The '''Legislative Council''': essentially the rubber-stamp Parliament, it was made up of '''People Commissioners''' (known elsewhere as [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s), who were sometimes elected, as individual members of the party, and always on the party platform.\n*The '''Supreme Court''': The only seemingly independent branch was the judiciary. But in effect, it was subordinate to a '''Judicial Council''' over which the regime had a very strong influence.\n\nEvery corporation, whether financial or union, as well as every division of the administration, were set up as branches of the party, the CEOs, Union leaders, and division directors being sworn-in as section presidents of the party. Every aspect of life was regulated to some degree by the party, and the will of its founding-president, Mobutu Sese Seko.\n\nMost of the petty aspects of the regime disappeared after 1990, and the beginning of the democratic transition. The latter was intended to be fairly short-lived, but Mobutu's power plays dragged it in length, to ultimately 1997, when the forces-led by [[Laurent Kabila]] eventually toppled the regime, after a 9-month-long successful military campaign.\n\n===The Kabilas' governments and war===\nThe government of former president [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] was toppled by a rebellion led by [[Laurent Kabila]] in May 1997, with the support of [[Rwanda]] and [[Uganda]]. They were later to turn against Kabila and backed a rebellion against him in August 1998. Troops from [[Zimbabwe]], [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], [[Chad]], and [[Sudan]] intervened to support the [[Kinshasa]] regime. A cease-fire was signed on 10 July 1999 by the DROC, Zimbabwe, Angola, Uganda, Namibia, Rwanda, and Congolese armed rebel groups, but fighting continued.\n\nUnder Laurent Kabila's regime, all executive, legislative, and military powers were first vested in the President, [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]]. The judiciary was independent, with the president having the power to dismiss or appoint. The president was first head of a 26-member cabinet dominated by the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]] (ADFL). Towards the end of the 90s, Laurent Kabila created and appointed a Transitional Parliament, with a seat in the buildings of the former [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] Parliament, in the southern town of Lubumbashi, in a move to unite the country, and to legitimate his regime. Kabila was assassinated on 16 January 2001 and his son [[Joseph Kabila]] was named head of state ten days later.\n\nThe younger Kabila continued with his father's Transitional Parliament, but overhauled his entire cabinet, replacing it with a group of technocrats, with the stated aim of putting the country back on the track of development, and coming to a decisive end of the [[Second Congo War]]. In October 2002, the new president was successful in getting occupying Rwandan forces to withdraw from eastern Congo; two months later, an agreement was signed by all remaining warring parties to end the fighting and set up a Transition Government, the make-up of which would allow representation for all negotiating parties. Two founding documents emerged from this: The [[wikisource:fr:Constitution de la transition de la R\u00e9publique d\u00e9mocratique du Congo (2003)|Transition Constitution]], and the [[Global and Inclusive Agreement]], both of which describe and determine the make-up and organization of the Congolese institutions, until planned elections in July 2006, at which time the provisions of the new constitution, democratically approved by referendum in December 2005, will take full effect and that is how it happened.\n\nUnder the Global and All-Inclusive Agreement, signed on 17 December 2002, in Pretoria, there was to be one President and [[Vice-Presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|four Vice-Presidents]], one from the government, one from the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]], one from the [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo|MLC]], and one from civil society. The position of Vice-President expired after the 2006 elections.\n\n===Present situation===\nAfter being for three years (2003\u201306) in the [[interregnum]] between two constitutions, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is now under the regime of the [[Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Constitution of the Third Republic]]. The constitution, adopted by referendum in 2005, and promulgated by President Joseph Kabila in February 2006, establishes a decentralized semi-presidential republic, with a separation of powers between the three branches of government - executive, legislative and judiciary, and a distribution of prerogatives between the central government and the provinces.\n\nAs of 8 August 2017 there are 54 political parties legally operating in the Congo.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.digitalcongo.net/article/59c9067634b97800049500e8| title = L\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame de justice a tranch\u00e9 : Abako ; Gu\u00e9guerre entre Matusila et Kimpiatu enterr\u00e9e| last = Kungu| first = Kl\u00e9ber| date = 25 September 2017| website = Digital Congo| publisher = Multimedia Congo sprl| access-date = 30 September 2017| location = Kinshasa}}</ref>\n\n==Executive branch==\nSince the July 2006 elections, the country is led by a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]], strongly-[[decentralized]] state. The executive at the central level, is divided between the [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]], and a [[Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Prime Minister]] appointed by him/her from the party having the majority of seats in Parliament. Should there be no clear majority, the President can appoint a \"government former\" that will then have the task to win the confidence of the National Assembly. The President appoints the government members (ministers) at the proposal of the Prime Minister. In coordination, the President and the government have the charge of the executive. The Prime minister and the government are responsible to the lower-house of Parliament, the National Assembly.\n\nAt the [[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|province]] level, the Provincial legislature (Provincial Assembly) elects a governor, and the governor, with his government of up to 10 ministers, is in charge of the provincial executive. Some domains of government power are of the exclusive provision of the Province, and some are held concurrently with the Central government. This is not a Federal state however, simply a decentralized one, as the majority of the domains of power are still vested in the Central government. The governor is responsible to the Provincial Assembly.\n\n===Criticisms===\nThe semi-presidential system has been described by some as \"conflictogenic\" and \"dictatogenic\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20060103192600/http://lepartidurenouveau.free.fr/profmampuya003.htm], as it ensures frictions, and a reduction of pace in government life, should the President and the Prime Minister be from different sides of the political arena. This was seen several times in [[France]], a country that shares the semi-presidential model. It was also, arguably, in the first steps of the Congo into independence, the underlying cause of the crisis between Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]] and President [[Joseph Kasa Vubu]], who ultimately dismissed each other, in 1960.\n\nIn January 2015 the [[2015 Congolese protests]] broke out in the country's capital following the release of a draft law that would extend the presidential term limits and allow [[Joseph Kabila]] to run again for office.\n\n==Legislative branch==\n[[File:Palais du peuple de la RDC.jpg|thumb|[[Palais du Peuple (Kinshasa)|Palais du Peuple]], seat of the [[Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|parliament]] in [[Kinshasa]]]]\n\n=== Under the Transition Constitution ===\nThe Inter-Congolese dialogue, that set-up the transitional institutions, created a bicameral parliament, with a National Assembly and Senate, made up of appointed representatives of the parties to the dialogue.  These parties included the preceding government, the rebel groups that were fighting against the government, with heavy Rwandan and Ugandan support, the internal opposition parties, and the Civil Society.  At the beginning of the transition, and up until recently, the National Assembly is headed by the [[Movement for the Liberation of the Congo|MLC]] with Speaker Hon. [[Olivier Kamitatu]], while the Senate is headed by a representative of the Civil Society, namely the head of the Church of Christ in Congo, Mgr.  [[Pierre Marini Bodho]]. Hon. Kamitatu has since left both the MLC and the Parliament to create his own party, and ally with current President Joseph Kabila.  Since then, the position of Speaker is held by Hon. [[Thomas Luhaka]], of the MLC.\n\nAside from the regular legislative duties, the Senate had the charge to draft a new constitution for the country.  That constitution was adopted by referendum in December 2005, and decreed into law on 18 February 2006.\n\n===Under the New Constitution===\nThe Parliament of the third republic is also bicameral, with a National Assembly and a Senate. Members of the National Assembly, the lower - but the most powerful - house, are elected by [[Universal direct suffrage|direct suffrage]]. Senators are elected by the legislatures of the 26 provinces.\n\n==Judicial branch==\n===Under the Transition Constitution===\n{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Under the New Constitution===\nThe Congolese Judicial Branch Consists of a Supreme Court, which handles federal crimes.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{Main|Subdivisions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}\n\n===Under the Transition Constitution===\n10 provinces (provinces, singular -

The terrain and climate of the [[Congo Basin]] present serious barriers to road and rail construction, and the distances are enormous across this vast country. Furthermore, chronic economic mismanagement and internal conflict has led to serious under-investment over many years.\n\nOn the other hand, the [[Democratic Republic of Congo|DRC]] has thousands of kilometres of [[navigable]] [[waterway]]s, and traditionally water transport has been the dominant means of moving around approximately two-thirds of the country.\n\n==Transport problems==\nAs an illustration of transport difficulties in the DRC, even before wars damaged the infrastructure, the so-called \"national\" route, used to get supplies to [[Bukavu]] from the seaport of [[Matadi]], consisted of the following:\n*Matadi to [[Kinshasa]] \u2013 rail\n*Kinshasa to [[Kisangani]] \u2013 [[Riverboat|river boat]]\n*Kisangani to [[Ubundu]] \u2013 rail\n*Ubundu to [[Kindu]] \u2013 river boat\n*Kindu to [[Kalemie]] \u2013 rail\n*Kalemie to Kalundu (the lake port at [[Uvira]]) \u2013 boat on [[Lake Tanganyika]]\n*Kalundu to Bukavu \u2013 road\nIn other words, goods had to be loaded and unloaded eight times and the total journey would take many months.\n\nMany of the routes listed below are in poor condition and may be operating at only a fraction of their original capacity (if at all), despite recent attempts to make improvements. Up to 2006 the [[United Nations Joint Logistics Centre]] (UNJLC) had an operation in Congo to support [[humanitarian relief]] agencies working there, and its bulletins and maps about the transport situation are archived on [[ReliefWeb]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://reliefweb.int/country/cod?source=1497|title=Democratic Republic of the Congo: results from United Nations Joint Logistics Centre|publisher=[[ReliefWeb]]|accessdate=2018-07-09}}</ref>\n\nThe [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s saw great destruction of transport infrastructure from which the country has not yet recovered. Many vehicles were destroyed or commandeered by [[militia]]s, especially in the north and east of the country, and the fuel supply system was also badly affected. Consequently, outside of [[Kinshasa]], [[Matadi]] and [[Lubumbashi]], private and commercial road transport is almost non-existent and traffic is scarce even where roads are in good condition. The few vehicles in use outside these cities are run by the [[MONUC|United Nations]], aid agencies, the DRC government, and a few larger companies such as those in the mining and energy sectors. High-resolution satellite photos on the Internet show large cities such as [[Bukavu]], [[Butembo]] and [[Kikwit]] virtually devoid of traffic, compared to similar photos of towns in neighbouring countries.<ref>[http://earth.google.com Google Earth] retrieved 24 September 2007.</ref>\n\nAir transport is the only effective means of moving between many places within the country. The Congolese government, the United Nations, aid organisations and large companies use air rather than ground transport to move personnel and freight. The UN operates a large fleet of aircraft and helicopters, and compared to other African countries the DRC has a large number of small domestic airlines and air charter companies. The transport (and smuggling) of minerals with a high value for weight is also carried out by air, and in the east, some stretches of paved road isolated by destroyed bridges or impassable sections have been turned into airstrips.\n\nFor the ordinary citizen though, especially in rural areas, often the only options are to cycle, walk or go by dugout canoe.\n\nSome parts of the DRC are more accessible from neighbouring countries than from [[Kinshasa]]. For example, Bukavu itself and [[Goma]] and other north-eastern towns are linked by paved road from the DRC border to the [[Kenya]]n port of [[Mombasa]], and most goods for these cities have been brought via this route in recent years. Similarly, [[Lubumbashi]] and the rest of [[Katanga Province]] is linked to [[Zambia]], through which the paved highway and rail networks of Southern Africa can be accessed. Such links through neighbouring countries are generally more important for the east and south-east of the country, and are more heavily used, than surface links to the capital.\n\n==Major infrastructure programs==\nIn 2007 [[China]] agreed to lend the DRC US$5bn for two major transport infrastructure projects to link mineral-rich Katanga, specifically Lubumbashi, by rail to an ocean port ([[Matadi]]) and by road to the Kisangani river port, and to improve its links to the transport network of Southern Africa in Zambia. The two projects would also link the major parts of the country not served by water transport, and the main centres of the economy. Loan repayments will be from concessions for raw materials which China desperately needs: copper, cobalt, gold and nickel, as well as by toll revenues from the road and railway. In the face of reluctance by the international business community to invest in DRC, this represents a revitalisation of DRC's infrastructure much needed by its government.<ref>[http://www.moneyweb.co.za/mw/view/mw/en/page149519?oid=170139&sn=Blog%20detail%20back%20button Felicity Duncan: \"Turning Chinese?\"] ''Moneyweb Undictated'' website (South Africa), 12 November 2007.</ref>\n\nThe [[China Railway Seventh Group Co. Ltd]] will be in charge of the contract, under signed by the [[China Railway Engineering Corporation]], with construction to be started from June 2008.\n\n==Railways==\n{{Main|Rail transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}\n[[File:First train in Kindu, DRC.jpg|thumb|Train from [[Lubumbashi]] arriving in [[Kindu]] on newly refurbished line]]\n\n==Highways==\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo has fewer all-weather paved highways than any country of its population and size in Africa \u2014 a total of 2250&nbsp;km, of which only 1226&nbsp;km is in good condition (see below). To put this in perspective, the road distance across the country in any direction is more than 2500&nbsp;km (e.g. Matadi to Lubumbashi, 2700&nbsp;km by road). The figure of 2250&nbsp;km converts to 35&nbsp;km of paved road per 1,000,000 of population. Comparative figures for Zambia  and Botswana  are 721&nbsp;km and 3427&nbsp;km respectively.<ref>The figures are obtained by dividing the population figures in the Wikipedia country articles by the paved roads figure in the 'Transport in [country]' articles.</ref>\n\n===Categories===\nThe road network is theoretically divided into four categories (national roads, priority regional roads, secondary regional roads and local roads), however, the [[United Nations Joint Logistics Centre]] (UNJLC) reports that this classification is of little practical use because some roads simply do not exist. For example, National Road 9 is not operational and cannot be detected by [[remote sensing]] methods.<ref name=UNJLC/>\n\nThe two principal highways are:\n* [[National Road No. 1 (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|National Road No. 1]] connecting the Atlantic seaports with Kinshasa and southeast Katanga, the most important economic area of the country due to its copper and other mines.\n* [[National Road No. 2 (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|National Road No. 2]], [[Kisangani]]-[[Bukavu]]\u2013[[Goma]], connecting the principal waterway systems of the country, namely Kinshasa-Kisangani on the Congo River and the Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika systems on the eastern edge of the country. This road was cut during the war and as of July 2007 was not in use south of Walikale. Note that the so-called [[Kinshasa Highway]] is not a physical road but a metaphor applied to the route by which [[AIDS]] is believed to have been spread east through Uganda and Kenya and neighbouring countries by truck drivers from the Congo. In the DR Congo the only highway which physically matches the route is National Road No. 2, and most passengers and freight moving between Kinshasa and that road go by boat along the Congo River.\n\n===Inventory===\n[[File:Torday Congo Expedition 03.jpg|thumb|250px|The road between [[Kikwit]] and [[Idiofa]].]]\nThe total road network in 2005, according to the UNJLC, consisted of:\n\n*''paved:'' 2,250&nbsp;km\n*''unpaved:'' 15,000&nbsp;km\n*''tracks'' 43,000&nbsp;km\n*''country roads'' 21,000&nbsp;km\n*''local roads or footpaths'' 90,000&nbsp;km\n*''total:'' 171,250&nbsp;km<ref name=UNJLC>[https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/dr-congo-snapshot-roads-dr-congo UNJLC (2006): DRC Snapshot \u2013 Roads in DRC.]</ref>\n\nThe UNJLC also points out that the pre-[[Second Congo War]] network no longer exists, and is dependent upon 20,000 [[bridge]]s and 325 [[ferries]], most of which are in need of repair or replacement. In contrast, a Democratic Republic of the Congo government document shows that, also in 2005, the network of main highways in good condition was as follows:\n* ''paved: 1,226&nbsp;km''\n*''unpaved: 607&nbsp;km''<ref>[https://archive.is/20120914164227/http://www.unjlc.org/DRC/land/UNJLC_DRC_Ministrypublicworks_Land_rehabilitationprogram_fr_051130.xls/view UNJLC: DRC Ministry of Public Works: Land rehabilitation program] </ref>\n\nThe 2000 Michelin ''Motoring and Tourist Map 955 of Southern and Central Africa'', which categorizes roads as \"surfaced\", \"improved\" (generally unsurfaced but with gravel added and graded), \"partially improved\" and \"earth roads\" and \"tracks\" shows that there were 2694&nbsp;km of paved highway in 2000. These figures indicate that, compared to the more recent figures above,  there has been a deterioration this decade, rather than improvement.\n\n===International highways===\nThree routes in the [[Trans-African Highway network]] pass through DR Congo:\n* [[Tripoli-Cape Town Highway]]: this route crosses the western extremity of the country on National Road No. 1 between Kinshasa and [[Matadi]], a distance of 285&nbsp;km on one of the only paved sections in fair condition.\n* [[Lagos-Mombasa Highway]]: the DR Congo is the main missing link in this east-west highway and requires a new road to be constructed before it can function.\n* [[Beira-Lobito Highway]]: this east-west highway crosses [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] and requires re-construction over most of its length, being an earth track between the [[Angola]]n border and [[Kolwezi]], a paved road in very poor condition between Kolwezi and [[Lubumbashi]], and a paved road in fair condition over the short distance to the [[Zambia]]n border.\n\n==Waterways==\nThe DRC has more navigable rivers and moves more passengers and goods by [[boat]] and [[ferry]] than any other country in Africa. Kinshasa, with 7&nbsp;km of river frontage occupied by [[wharf]]s and [[jetties]],<ref>Measured on Google Earth which has high-resolution aerial photos of Kinshasa at coordinates -4.2978 15.3171, showing hundreds of barges and vessels, many apparently derelict ones choking some wharfs.</ref> is the largest [[inland port|inland waterways port]] on the continent. However, much of the infrastructure \u2014 vessels and port handling facilities \u2014 has, like the railways, suffered from poor maintenance and internal conflict.\n\nThe total length of waterways is estimated at 15,000&nbsp;km including the [[Congo River]], its tributaries, and unconnected [[lake]]s.\n\nThe 1000-kilometre Kinshasa-[[Kisangani]] route on the Congo River is the longest and best-known. It is operated by river tugs pushing several barges lashed together, and for the hundreds of passengers and traders these function like small floating towns. Rather than mooring at riverside communities along the route, traders come out by canoe and small boat alongside the river barges and transfer goods [[Lightering|on the move]].\n\nMost waterway routes do not operate to regular schedules. It is common for an operator to moor a barge at a riverside town and collect freight and passengers over a period of weeks before hiring a river tug to tow or push the barge to its destination.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110809065420/http://www.logcluster.org/ops/sudan/DRC/rivers/unjlcarticle.2005-10-19.0866864829/view Description of Inland Waterways in the Congo from the UN Joint Logistics Centre]\n\n===International links via inland waterways===\n* Kinshasa is linked to [[Brazzaville]] ([[Republic of the Congo]]) by regular boat and ferry services 3.5&nbsp;km across the Congo River.\n* Kinshasa and other river ports via the [[Ubangui River]] to [[Bangui]] ([[Central African Republic]]).\n* Goma and Bukavu on [[Lake Kivu]] to [[Gisenyi]], [[Kibuye, Rwanda|Kibuye]] and [[Cyangugu]] in [[Rwanda]].\n* Kalemie, Kulundu-Uvira and Moba on Lake Tanganyika to Kigoma (Tanzania), Bujumbura (Burundi) and Mpulungu (Zambia).\n* [[Kasenga]] and [[Pweto]] on the [[Luapula River]]-[[Lake Mweru]] system to [[Nchelenge]], [[Kashikishi]] and Kashiba in [[Zambia]].\n*[[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]]: two small ports on the DRC side, [[Kisenye]] near [[Bunia]] and [[Mahadi-Port]] in the north can link to [[Uganda]]n ports at [[Butiaba]] and [[Pakwach]] (served by [[Uganda Railways]]) on the [[Albert Nile]], which is navigable as far as [[Nimule]] in southern [[Sudan]].

The FARDC was rebuilt patchily as part of the peace process which followed the end of the [[Second Congo War]] in July 2003.\n\nThe majority of FARDC members are land forces, but it also has a small air force and an even smaller navy.

Its principal tasks are to provide security in key areas, such as the [[South Kivu]] and [[North Kivu]] in the east, and to assist the government in reconstruction. Foreign rebel groups are also in the Congo, as they have been for most of the last half-century. The most important is the [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR), against which [[Laurent Nkunda]]'s troops were fighting, but other smaller groups such as the anti-Ugandan [[Lord's Resistance Army]] are also present.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">[[International Crisis Group]], Congo: Consolidating the Peace, ''Africa Report'' No. 128, 5 July 2007.</ref>\n\nThe legal standing of the FARDC was laid down in the Transitional Constitution, articles 118 and 188.

It remained under the command of a Belgian officer corps through to the independence of the colony in 1960. The ''Force Publique'' saw combat in [[Cameroun]], and successfully invaded and conquered areas of [[German East Africa]], notably present day [[Rwanda]], during World War I. Elements of the ''Force Publique'' were also used to form Belgian colonial units that fought in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] during World War II.\n\n===Independence and revolt===\n{{main|Mutiny of the Force Publique}}\nAt independence on 30 June 1960, the army suffered from a dramatic deficit of trained leaders, particularly in the officer corps. This was because the ''Force Publique'' had always only been officered by Belgian or other expatriate whites. The Belgian Government made no effort to train Congolese commissioned officers until the very end of the colonial period, and in 1958, only 23 African cadets had been admitted even to the military secondary school.{{sfn|Meditz|Merrill|1993|p=285}} The highest rank available to Congolese was [[adjutant]], which only four soldiers achieved before independence.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=192}}{{efn|Willame states that 10 adjutants were nominated before shortly independence due to intense political pressure.{{sfn|Willame|1972|p=62}}}} Though 14 Congolese cadets were enrolled in the [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)|Royal Military Academy]] in Brussels in May, they were not scheduled to graduate as second lieutenants until 1963.{{sfn|Young|1966|p=35}} Ill-advised actions by Belgian officers led to an enlisted ranks' rebellion on 5 July 1960, which helped spark the [[Congo Crisis]]. Lieutenant General [[\u00c9mile Janssens]], the ''Force Publique'' commander, wrote during a meeting of soldiers that 'Before independence=After Independence', pouring cold water on the soldiers' desires for an immediate raise in their status.{{sfn|Meditz|Merrill|1993|p=285}}\n\nVanderstraeten says that on the morning of 8 July 1960, following a night during which all control had been lost over the soldiers, numerous ministers arrived at Camp Leopold with the aim of calming the situation.{{sfn|Vanderstraeten|1985}} Both Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]] and President [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] eventually arrived, and the soldiers listened to Kasa-Vubu \"religiously.\" After his speech, Kasa-Vubu and the ministers present retired into the camp canteen to hear a delegation from the soldiers. Vanderstraeten says that, according to [[Joseph Ileo]], their demands (''revendications'') included the following:\n*that the defence portfolio not be given to the Prime Minister\n*that the name ''Force Publique'' be changed to ''Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise'' (ANC)\n*and that the commander-in-chief and chief of staff should not necessarily be Belgians\nThe \"laborious\" discussions which then followed were later retrospectively given the label of an \"extraordinary ministerial council.\"{{sfn|Vanderstraeten|1985|p=236}} G\u00e9rald-Libois writes that '..the special meeting of the council of ministers took steps for the immediate Africanisation of the officer corps and named [[Victor Lundula]], who was born in [[Kasai region|Kasai]] and was burgomaster of [[Jadotville]], as Commander-in-Chief of the ANC; Colonel [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]] as chief of staff; and the Belgian, Colonel Henniquiau, as chief advisor to the ANC.'{{sfn|Libois|1966|p=95}} Thus General Janssens was dismissed. Both Lundula and Mobutu were former sergeants of the ''Force Publique''. \n\nOn 8\u20139 July 1960, the soldiers were invited to appoint black officers, and 'command of the army passed securely into the hands of former sergeants,' as the soldiers in general chose the most-educated and highest-ranked Congolese army soldiers as their new officers.<ref>Jean-Claude Williame in Kitchen, ed, ''Footnotes to the Congo Story'', New York: Walker & Co., 1967, pp. 166\u2013167.</ref> Most of the Belgian officers were retained as advisors to the new Congolese hierarchy, and calm returned to the two main garrisons at [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]] and [[Mbanza-Ngungu|Thysville]].{{sfn|DeWitte|Wright|2002|p=7}} The ''Force Publique'' was renamed the ''Arm\u00e9e nationale congolaise'' (ANC), or Congolese National Armed Forces.{{sfn|Vanderstraeten|1985|p=235\u2013260}} However, in Katanga Belgian officers resisted the Africanisation of the army.\n\nOn 9 July 1960, there was a ''Force Publique'' mutiny at Camp Massart at Elizabethville;{{sfn|DeWitte|Wright|2002|p=212}} five or seven Europeans were killed.{{sfn|Libois|1966|p=96}} The army revolt and resulting rumours caused severe panic across the country, and Belgium despatched troops and the naval Task Group 218.2 to protect its citizens.<ref>Task Group 218.2 under ''Capitaine de vaisseau'' Petitjean, comprised nine vessels: the troop transport A957 ''Kamina'', the alg\u00e9rines F901 Lecointe, F903 Dufour, F904 De Brouwer and F905 Demoor, and the vedettes Semois, Rupel, Dender, and Ourthe.

Large numbers of Belgian colonists fled the country. At the same time, on 11 July, [[Moise Tshombe]] declared the independence of [[Katanga Province]] in the south-east, closely backed by remaining Belgian administrators and soldiers.\n\n[[File:ANC armoured vehicles during the Congo Crisis.jpg|thumb|Arm\u00e9e nationale congolaise (ANC) armoured vehicles during the Congo Crisis]]\nOn 14 July 1960, in response to requests by Prime Minister Lumumba, the UN Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 143]]. This called upon Belgium to remove its troops and for the UN to provide 'military assistance' to the Congolese forces to allow them 'to meet fully their tasks'. Lumumba demanded that Belgium remove its troops immediately, threatening to seek help from the Soviet Union if they did not leave within two days. The UN reacted quickly and established the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC). The first UN troops arrived the next day but there was instant disagreement between Lumumba and the UN over the new force's [[Mandate (international law)|mandate]]. Because the Congolese army had been in disarray since the mutiny, Lumumba wanted to use the UN troops to subdue Katanga by force. Lumumba became extremely frustrated with the UN's unwillingness to use force against Tshombe and his secession.<ref>Oliver Ramsbotham, Tom Woodhouse, Encyclopedia of international peacekeeping operations, (ABC-CLIO: 1999), p. 54 {{ISBN|0-87436-892-8}}.</ref> He cancelling a scheduled meeting with Secretary General Hammarskj\u00f6ld on August 14 and wrote a series of angry letters instead.<ref>Hobbs, Nicole, \"The UN and the Congo Crisis of 1960\" (2014).

Following assurances that contingents of the Force would arrive in sufficient numbers, the Belgian authorities agreed to withdraw all their forces from the Leopoldville area by 23 July. The last Belgian troops left the country by 23 July, as United Nations forces continued to deploy throughout the Congo. The build of ONUC continued, its strength increasing to over 8,000 by 25 July and to over 11,000 by 31 July 1960. A basic agreement between the United Nations and the Congolese Government on the operation of the Force was agreed by 27 July. On 9 August, [[Albert Kalonji]] proclaimed the independence of [[South Kasai]].\n\n[[File:Colonel Kokolo funeral 02.jpg|thumb|ANC parade in 1960]]\nDuring the crucial period of July\u2013August 1960, Mobutu built up \"his\" national army by channeling foreign aid to units loyal to him, by exiling unreliable units to remote areas, and by absorbing or dispersing rival armies. He tied individual officers to him by controlling their promotion and the flow of money for payrolls.

The MPLA, then, acting ostensibly at least as the [[Front for Congolese National Liberation]], occupied Zaire's southeastern [[Katanga Province]], then known as Shaba, in March 1977, facing little resistance from the FAZ. This invasion is sometimes known as [[Shaba I]]. Mobutu had to request assistance, which was provided by [[Morocco]] in the form of regular troops who routed the MPLA and their [[Cuba]]n advisors out of Katanga. Also important were Egyptian pilots who flew Zaire's [[Mirage 5]] combat aircraft.{{sfn|Meditz|Merrill|1993|p=292\u20133}} The humiliation of this episode led to civil unrest in Zaire in early 1978, which the FAZ had to put down.<ref>[[John Keegan]], World Armies, New York: Facts on File, 1979, pp. 822\u2013823.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mobutu in 1978.jpg|thumb|President Mobutu in military fatigues, 1978|left]]\nThe poor performance of Zaire's military during [[Shaba I]] gave evidence of chronic weaknesses.{{sfn|Meditz|Merrill|1993}} One problem was that some of the Zairian soldiers in the area had not received pay for extended periods. Senior officers often kept the money intended for the soldiers, typifying a generally disreputable and inept senior leadership in the FAZ. As a result, many soldiers simply deserted rather than fight. Others stayed with their units but were ineffective. During the months following the Shaba invasion, Mobutu sought solutions to the military problems that had contributed to the army's dismal performance. He implemented sweeping reforms of the command structure, including wholesale firings of high-ranking officers. He merged the military general staff with his own presidential staff and appointed himself chief of staff again, in addition to the positions of minister of defence and supreme commander that he already held. He also redeployed his forces throughout the country instead of keeping them close to Kinshasa, as had previously been the case. The [[Kamanyola Division]], at the time considered the army's best formation, and considered the president's own, was assigned permanently to [[Katanga Province|Shaba]]. In addition to these changes, the army's strength was reduced by 25 percent. Also, Zaire's allies provided a large influx of military equipment, and Belgian, French, and American advisers assisted in rebuilding and retraining the force.\n\nDespite these improvements, a second invasion by the former Katangan gendarmerie, known as [[Shaba II]] in May\u2013June 1978, was only dispersed with the despatch of the French [[2e r\u00e9giment \u00e9tranger de parachutistes]] and a battalion of the Belgian [[Paracommando Brigade (Belgium)|Paracommando Regiment]].

For example, the tanks of the 1st Armoured Brigade often have a nonoperational rate approaching 70 to 80 percent. After a visit by a Chinese technical team in 1985, most of the tanks operated, but such an improved status generally has not lasted long beyond the departure of the visiting team. Several factors complicate maintenance in Zairian units. Maintenance personnel often lack the training necessary to maintain modern military equipment. Moreover, the wide variety of military equipment and the staggering array of spare parts necessary to maintain it not only clog the logistic network but also are expensive.\n\nThe most important factor that negatively affects maintenance is the low and irregular pay that soldiers receive, resulting in the theft and sale of spare parts and even basic equipment to supplement their meager salaries. When not stealing spare parts and equipment, maintenance personnel often spend the better part of their duty day looking for other ways to profit. American maintenance teams working in Zaire found that providing a free lunch to the work force was a good, sometimes the only, technique to motivate personnel to work at least half of the duty day.\n\nThe army's logistics corps [was tasked].. to provide logistic support and conduct direct, indirect, and depot-level maintenance for the FAZ. But because of Zaire's lack of emphasis on maintenance and logistics, a lack of funding, and inadequate training, the corps is understaffed, underequipped, and generally unable to accomplish its mission. It is organised into three battalions assigned to [[Mbandaka]], [[Kisangani]], and [[Kamina]], but only the battalion at Kamina is adequately staffed; the others are little more than skeleton\" units.\n\nThe poor state of discipline of the Congolese forces became apparent again in 1990. Foreign military assistance to Zaire ceased following the end of the [[Cold War]] and Mobutu deliberately allowed the military's condition to deteriorate so that it did not threaten his hold on power.<ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Jane's Sentinel Security Assessment\u2014Central Africa.

These units were deployed throughout the country, with the main concentrations in Shaba Region (approximately half the force). The Kamanyola Division, consisting of three infantry brigades operated generally in western Shaba Region; the 21st Infantry Brigade was located in [[Lubumbashi]]; the 13th Infantry Brigade was deployed throughout eastern Shaba; and at least one battalion of the 31st Airborne Brigade stayed at [[Kamina]]. The other main concentration of forces was in and around Kinshasa: the 31st Airborne Brigade was deployed at [[N'djili Airport]] on the outskirts of the capital; the [[Special Presidential Division]] (DSP) resided adjacent to the presidential compound; and the 1st Armoured Brigade was at [[Mbanza-Ngungu]] (in [[Bas-Congo]], approximately {{convert|120|km|mi}} southwest of Kinshasa). Finally the 41st Commando Brigade was at [[Kisangani]].\n\nThis superficially impressive list of units overstates the actual capability of the armed forces at the time. Apart from privileged formations such as the Presidential Division and the 31st Airborne Brigade, most units were poorly trained, divided and so badly paid that they regularly resorted to looting. What operational abilities the armed forces had were gradually destroyed by politicisation of the forces, tribalisation, and division of the forces, included purges of suspectedly disloyal groups, intended to allow Mobutu to divide and rule.{{sfn|Ebenga|N'Landu|2005|pp=66\u201370,73\u201374}} All this occurred against the background of increasing deterioration of state structures under the kleptocratic Mobutu regime.\n\n===Mobutu's overthrow and after===\nMuch of the origins of the recent conflict in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo stems from the turmoil following the [[Rwandan Genocide]] of 1994, which then led to the [[Great Lakes refugee crisis]]. Within the largest refugee camps, beginning in [[Goma]] in Nord-Kivu, were Rwandan [[Hutu]] fighters, who were eventually organised into the [[Rassemblement D\u00e9mocratique pour le Rwanda]], who launched repeated attacks into Rwanda. Rwanda eventually backed [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]] and his quickly organised [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]] (AFDL) in invading Zaire, aiming to stop the attacks on Rwanda in the process of toppling Mobutu's government. When the militias rebelled, backed by Rwanda, the FAZ, weakened as is noted above, proved incapable of mastering the situation and preventing [[First Congo War|the overthrow of Mobutu]] in 1997.<ref>''Jane's Sentinel Security Assessment\u2014Central Africa.

Allying themselves with the Sudanese government which was fighting [[Second Sudanese Civil War|its own civil war]] at the time, these FAZ troops were destroyed by the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] during a major ambush near [[Yei, South Sudan|Yei]] in March 1997.{{sfnp|Prunier|2004|pp=376\u2013377}}\n\nWhen Kabila took power in 1997, the country was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo and so the name of the national army changed once again, to the ''Forces arm\u00e9es congolaises'' (FAC). [[Tanzania]] sent six hundred military advisors to train Kabila's new army in May 1997. (Prunier says that the instructors were still at the [[Kitona]] base when the [[Second Congo War]] broke out, and had to be quickly returned to Tanzania.

[[G\u00e9rard Prunier]] writes that \"there was no minister of defence, no known chief of staff, and no ranks; all officers were Cuban-style 'commanders' called 'Ignace', 'Bosco', Jonathan', or 'James', who occupied connecting suites at the [[Intercontinental Hotel]] and had presidential list cell-phone numbers. None spoke French or Lingala, but all spoke Kinyarwanda, Swahili, and, quite often, English.\" On being asked by Belgian journalist [[Colette Braeckman]] what was the actual army command structure apart from himself, Kabila answered 'We are not going to expose ourselves and risk being destroyed by showing ourselves openly... . We are careful so that the true masters of the army are not known. It is strategic. Please, let us drop the matter.'{{sfn|Prunier|2009|p=150}}<ref>Colette Braeckman interview with Kabila in [[Le Soir]], 31 October \u2013 2 November 1997, at Prunier p. 150.</ref> Kabila's new ''Forces arm\u00e9es congolaises'' were riven with internal tensions.

[the mostly] [[Lunda people|Lunda]] Katangese Tigers of the former [[Front for Congolese National Liberation|FNLC]], and former FAZ personnel.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|p=176}} Mixing these disparate and formerly warring elements together led to mutuny.

As well as providing [[expeditionary warfare|expeditionary forces]], these countries unsuccessfully attempted to retrain the DRC Army. [[North Korea]] and Tanzania also provided assistance with training. During the first year of the war the Allied forces defeated the [[Rwanda]]n force which had landed in [[Bas-Congo]] and the rebel forces south-west of Kinshasa and eventually halted the rebel and Rwandan offensive in the east of the DRC.

An intermediate mechanism for physical identification of the soldiers, and their origin, date of enrolment, and unit was also called for (VII(c)). It also provided for the creation of a Conseil Superieur de la Defense (Superior Defence Council) which would declare states of siege or war and give advice on security sector reform, disarmament/demobilization, and national defence policy.\n\nA decision on which factions were to name chiefs of staff and military regional commanders was announced on 19 August 2003 as the first move in military reform, superimposed on top of the various groups of fighters, government and former rebels.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3168927.stm |title=New military command for DR Congo |date=20 August 2003|work= |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=17 November 2009}}.

Kabila was able to name the air force commander ([[John Numbi]]), the RCD-Goma received the Land Force commander's position (Sylvain Buki) and the MLC the navy ([[Dieudonne Amuli Bahigwa]]). Three military regional commanders were nominated by the former Kinshasa government, two commanders each by the [[RCD-Goma]] and the MLC, and one region commander each by the RCD-K/ML and RCD-N. However these appointments were announced for Kabila's ''Forces arm\u00e9es congolaises'' (FAC), not the later FARDC. Another report however says that the military region commanders were only nominated in January 2004, and that the troop deployment on the ground did not change substantially until the year afterward.\n\n[[File:Congolese troops at Camp Base, Kisangani 2010-05-05 2.JPG|thumb|Congolese troops raise the [[flag of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in 2010]]\nOn 24 January 2004, a decree created the ''Structure Militaire d'Int\u00e9gration'' (SMI, Military Integration Structure). Together with the SMI, CONADER also was designated to manage the combined ''tronc commun'' DDR element and military reform programme. The first post-Sun City military law appears to have been passed on 12 November 2004, which formally created the new national Forces Arm\u00e9es de la R\u00e9publique D\u00e9mocratique du Congo (FARDC). Included in this law was article 45, which recognised the incorporation of a number of armed groups into the FARDC, including the former government army Forces Arm\u00e9es Congolaises (FAC), ex-FAZ personnel also known as former President Mobutu's 'les tigres', the RCD-Goma, RCD-ML, RCD-N, MLC, the Mai-Mai, as well as other government-determined military and paramilitary groups.\n\nTurner writes that the two most prominent opponents of military integration (''brassage'') were Colonel [[Jules Mutebusi]], a Munyamulenge from South Kivu, and [[Laurent Nkunda]], a Rwandaphone Tutsi who Turner says was allegedly from [[Rutshuru]] in North Kivu. In May\u2013June 2004 Mutebusi led a revolt against his superiors from Kinshasa in South Kivu.<ref>Thomas Turner, ''The Congo Wars: Conflict, Myth, and Reality'', 2007, 96\u2013101.</ref> Nkunda began his long series of revolts against central authority by helping Mutebusi in May\u2013June 2004. In November 2004 a Rwandan government force entered North Kivu to attack the FDLR, and, it seems, reinforced and resupplied RCD-Goma (ANC) at the same time. Kabila despatched 10,000 government troops to the east in response, launching an attack that was called \"Operation Bima\".<ref>Turner, 2007, 131\u2013132.</ref> In the midst of this tension, Nkunda's men launched attacks in North Kivu in December 2004.\n\nThere was another major personnel reshuffle on 12 June 2007.

Then they are sent to orientation centres, run by CONADER, where fighters take the choice of either returning to civilian society or remaining in the armed forces. Combatants who choose demobilisation receive an initial cash payment of US $110. Those who choose to stay within the FARDC are then transferred to one of six integration centres for a 45-day training course, which aims to build integrated formations out of factional fighters previously heavily divided along ethnic, political and regional lines. The centres are spread out around the country at [[Kitona]], [[Kamina]], [[Kisangani]], [[Rumangabo]] and Nyaleke (within the [[Virunga National Park]]) in [[Nord-Kivu]], and [[Luberizi]] (on the border with Burundi) in South Kivu. The process has suffered severe difficulties due to construction delays, administration errors, and the amount of travel former combatants have to do, as the three stages' centres are widely separated. Following the first 18 integrated brigades, the second goal is the formation of a ready reaction force of two to three brigades, and finally, by 2010 when MONUC is anticipated to have withdrawn, the creation of a Main Defence Force of three divisions.\n\nIn February 2008, then Defence Minister Chikez Diemu described the reform plan at the time as:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssrnetwork.net/ssrbulletin/dr_congo.php|title=Report on the DRC SSR Roundtable talks: Kinshasa, 25-26 February 2008|work=SSR Case Study: The Democratic Republic of Congo|accessdate=1 November 2008|archivedate=30 July 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730103418/http://www.ssrnetwork.net/ssrbulletin/dr_congo.php|publisher=Global Facilitation Network for Security Sector Reform|year=2008}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\"The short term, 2008\u20132010, will see the setting in place of a Rapid Reaction Force; the medium term, 2008\u20132015, with a Covering Force; and finally the long term, 2015\u20132020, with a Principal Defence Force.\" Diemu added that the reform plan rests on a programme of synergy based on the four pillars of dissuasion, production, reconstruction and excellence. \"The Rapid Reaction Force is expected to focus on dissuasion, through a Rapid Reaction Force of 12 battalions, capable of aiding MONUC to secure the east of the country and to realise constitutional missions.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nAmid the other difficulties in building new armed forces for the DRC, in early 2007 the integration and training process was distorted as the DRC government under Kabila attempted to use it to gain more control over the dissident general [[Laurent Nkunda]]. A hastily negotiated verbal agreement in Rwanda saw three government FAC brigades integrated with Nkunda's former ANC 81st and 83rd Brigades in what was called ''mixage''. ''Mixage'' brought multiple factions into composite brigades, but without the 45-day retraining provided by ''brassage'', and it seems that actually, the process was limited to exchanging [[battalion]]s between the FAC and Nkunda brigades in North Kivu, without further integration. Due to Nkunda's troops having greater cohesion, Nkunda effectively gained control of all five brigades, which was not the intention of the DRC central government.<ref>Henri Boshoff, The DDR Process in the DRC: a never-ending story, [[Institute for Security Studies]], Pretoria, 2 July 2007.</ref> However, after Nkunda used the ''mixage'' brigades to fight the [[FDLR]], strains arose between the FARDC and Nkunda-loyalist troops within the brigades and they fell apart in the last days of August 2007. The International Crisis Group says that \"by 30 August [2007] Nkunda's troops had left the mixed brigades and controlled a large part of the [[Masisi Territory|Masisi]] and [[Rutshuru Territory|Rutshuru]] territories\" (of [[North Kivu]]).<ref>International Crisis Group, Bringing Peace to North Kivu, Africa Report No.133, 31 October 2007, p .13.</ref>\n\nBoth formally integrated brigades and the non-integrated units continue to conduct arbitrary arrests, rapes, robbery, and other crimes<ref>[[Amnesty International]], {{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAFR620012007?open%26of%3DENG-COD |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821150102/http://www.web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAFR620012007?open&of=ENG-COD |archivedate=21 August 2007 |df=dmy }} Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) and the Reform of the Army, 25 January 2007, AI Index: AFR 62/001/2007</ref> and these human rights violations are \"regularly\" committed by both officers and members of the rank and file.

Denmark is a net exporter of food. The center-left coalition government (1993\u20132001) concentrated on reducing the unemployment rate and turning the budget deficit into a surplus, as well as following the previous government's policies of maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus. The coalition also committed itself to maintaining a stable currency. The coalition lowered marginal income tax rates while maintaining overall tax revenues; boosted industrial competitiveness through labor market and tax reforms, increased research and development funds. The availability and duration of unemployment benefit has been restricted to four years and because of rapidly rising prices on housing this has led to an increase in poverty from below 4% in 1995 to 5% in 2006 according to the Danish Economic Council [http://politiken.dk/debat/article215345.ece]. Despite these cuts, the part of the public sector in Denmark which buys goods and services from the private sector and provides the public sector administration and direct service to the public - nursing institutions for the young or old, hospitals, schools, police, and so on. - has risen from 25.5% of GDP during the former government to 26% today and is projected to be at 26.5% in 2015 if current policies continue [http://nyhederne-dyn.tv2.dk/article.php/id-8042192.html].\n\nDenmark chose not to join the 11 other European Union members who launched the [[euro]] on 1 January 1999. Especially from 2006, economists and political pundits have expressed concern that the lack of skilled labour will result in higher pay increases and an overheating of the economy, which would repeat the boom-and-bust cycle in 1986, when government introduced a tax reform and restricted the private loan market because of a record balance-of-payments deficit. As a consequence, the trade balance showed a surplus in 1987, and the balance-of-payments in 1990 (first surplus since 1963). They have remained in surplus since, except for the balance of payments in 1998. Denmark's economy has prospered until 2008, when the financial crisis caused a deterrence to the continuing trend of prosperity. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/da.html|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref>\n\n==Welfare state==\n{{Main|Welfare state}}\n[[File:Labour productivity levels in Europe.

Within animal husbandry, it includes dairy and beef cattle, pigs, poultry and fur animals \u2013 primarily mink -, all sectors with a major export. Regarding vegetable production, Denmark is a leading producer of grass-, clover- and horticultural seeds.\n\nThe Danish agricultural industry is characterized by freehold and family ownership but due to structural development farms have become fewer and larger. With modern trade patterns the profitability increasingly depends on global market trends. The arable land in Denmark is approximately 2,646,000 hectares, and the number of farms approximately 40,000, out of which approximately one third is owned by full-time farmers.\n\nThe agriculture is intensive with 64 per cent of the land area being used for production. This equals production of food for 15 million people. The value of Danish agricultural export, including the agribusiness sector, has risen steadily in recent years and accounted for 16 billion Euros in 2011. The agriculture and food sector as a whole represents 25 per cent of total Danish commodity exports (2015).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/dnk/all/show/2015/|title=Products exported by Denmark (2015)|website=The Observatory of Economic Complexity|language=en|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==== Animal production ====\nThe tendency towards fewer and larger farms has been accompanied by an increase in animal production, using fewer resources per produced unit.\n\nThe number of dairy farmers has reduced to about 3,800 with an average herd size of 150 cows. The milk quota is 1,142 tonnes. Danish dairy farmers are among the largest and most modern producers in Europe. More than half of the cows live in new loose-housing systems. Export of dairy products accounts for more than 20 per cent of the total Danish agricultural export. The total number of cattle in 2011 was approximately 1.5 million. Of these, 565,000 were dairy cows and 99,000 were suckler cows. The yearly number of slaughtering of beef cattle is around 550,000.\n\nFor more than 100 years the production of pigs and pig meat has been a major source of income in Denmark. The Danish pig industry is among the world\u2019s leaders in areas such as breeding, quality, food safety, animal welfare and traceability creating the basis for Denmark being among the world\u2019s largest pig meat exporters. Approximately 90 per cent of the production is exported. This accounts for almost half of all agricultural exports and for more than 5 per cent of Denmark\u2019s total exports. About 4,200 farmers produce 28 million pigs annually. Of these, 20.9 million are slaughtered in Denmark.\n\n[[Fur farming|Fur animal production]] on an industrial scale started in the 1930s in Denmark. Denmark is now the world\u2019s largest producer of [[mink]] furs, with 1,400 mink farmers fostering 17.2 million mink and producing around 14 million furs of the highest quality every year.<ref name=\"L&F\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lf.dk/lf/Viden%20om/Landbrugsproduktion/Husdyr/Mink |title=Mink |publisher=Landbrug & F\u00f8devarer |language=Danish|date= |accessdate=25 January 2016}} \"Langbrug & F\u00f8devarer\" is the largest interest organization for the Danish agricultural and food industry.</ref> Approximately 98 per cent of the skins sold at Kopenhagen Fur Auction are exported.

Chickens for slaughter are often produced in units with 40,000 broilers. In 2012, 100 million chickens were slaughtered. In the minor productions of poultry, 13 million ducks, 1.4 million geese and 5.0 million turkeys were slaughtered in 2012.\n\n==== Organic production ====\n[[Organic farming]] and production has increased dramatically in Denmark in the last 25 years and continues to expand with more than a quadrupling of exports since 2006. In 2012 the export of organic products reached DK 1.2 billion, a 12.3% increase from 2011. This figure should be seen in the context of a DK 360 billion global market for organic products and a total export from the Danish food and agriculture sector at DK 148 billion that same year. The import of organic products has always been higher than the exports though and reached DK 1.5 billion in 2012. 7% of the cultivated land is now categorized as organically farmed and 10% for the dairy industry as of 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.fvm.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/ENGLISH_FVM.DK/Themes/Organic_production/Organic_consumption_and_production_in_Denmark.pdf|title=Organic consumption and production in Denmark|publisher=The Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries of Denmark|accessdate=2 January 2015}}</ref> Denmark has a high consumption of organic products per capita compared to other European countries, only surpassed by Switzerland.

A tight fiscal policy by the Greenland Home Rule Government since the late 1980s helped create a low inflation rate and surpluses in the public budget, but at the cost of rising foreign debt in the Home Rule Government's commercial entities. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign trade deficit.\n\nFollowing the closure of Greenland's last lead and zinc mine in 1989, Greenland's economy is solely dependent on the fishing and tourism and financial transfers from the Danish central government. Despite resumption of several interesting hydrocarbon and [[mineral]] exploration activities, it will take several years before production will begin. Greenland's shrimp fishery is by far the largest source of income, since cod catches have dropped to historically low levels. Greenland also has a prominent whaling industry, Greenlandic Inuit whalers catch around 175 whales per year, making them the third largest hunt in the world after Japan and Norway, though their take is small compared to those nations, who annually averaged around 730 and 590 whales respectively in 1998\u20132007. \n\nThe IWC treats the west and east coasts of Greenland as two separate population areas and sets separate quotas for each coast. The far more densely populated west coast accounts for over 90 percent of the catch. In a typical year around 150 minke and 10 fin whales are taken from west coast waters and around 10 minkes are from east coast waters. Since the fishing industry is in decline including whaling, tourism is the only sector offering any near-term potential, and even this is limited due to the short season and high costs. The public sector plays a dominant role in Greenland's economy. Grants from mainland Denmark and EU fisheries payments make up about one-half of the home-rule government's revenues. Recently,{{When|date=October 2016}} Greenland has seen interest from other countries due to the possibilities of large amounts of natural resources, which include: coal, iron ore, lead, zinc, molybdenum, diamonds, gold, platinum, niobium, tantalite, uranium, fish, seals, whales, hydropower, possible oil and gas.\n\nThe Faroe Islands also depend almost entirely on fisheries, salmon farming, tourism and related exports. Without Danish Government bailouts in 1992 and 1993, the Faroese economy would have gone bankrupt. Since 1995, the Faroese economy has seen a noticeable upturn, but remains vulnerable. Recent off-shore oil finds close to the Faroese area give hope for Faroese deposits, too, which may form the basis for an economic rebound over the longer term. Like Greenland, the Faroe Islands are also known for its [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands|whale hunting]], around 950 [[long-finned pilot whale]]s (Globicephala melaena) are caught each year, mainly during the summer. This should be seen in the context of an estimated local pilot whale population of more than 100,000. Other species are not hunted, though occasionally Atlantic white-sided dolphin can be found among the pilot whales. The Faroese whale slaughter has recently been under attack by the media because of the way it is generally perceived. The whale hunting is not a commercial industry, of no significance to the economy other than the fact that the Faroes need to import less meat from other animals because people get meat for free from the pilot whales, and the whales are for local consumption only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo|title=Whales and Whaling in the Faroe Islands|website=whaling.fo|publisher=Whales and Whaling in the Faroe Islands|accessdate=23 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nNeither Greenland nor the Faroe Islands are members of the European Union.

However, public opposition to increases in defence spending\u2014during a period when economic constraints require reduced spending for social welfare\u2014has created differences among the political parties regarding a broadly acceptable level of new defence expenditure.\n\nThe latest Defence agreement (\"[[Danish Defence agreement 2005-2009|Defence agreement 2005\u20132009]]\") was signed June 10, 2004, and calls for a significant re-construction of the entire military. From now about 60% support structure and 40% combat operational capability, it is to be 40% support structure and 60% combat operational capability, i.e. more combat soldiers and fewer \"paper\"-soldiers.\nThe reaction speed is increased, with an entire [[brigade]] on standby readiness; the military retains the capability to continually deploy 2,000 soldiers in international service or 5,000 over a short time span. The standard mandatory [[conscription]] is modified. Generally this means fewer conscripts, less service time for them and only those who choose so, will continue into the reaction force system.\n\n===Expenditures===\nIn 2006 the Danish military budget was the fifth largest single portion of the Danish Government's total budget, significantly less than that of the [[Ministry of Social Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry of Social Affairs]] (~110 billion [[Danish krone|DKK]]), [[Ministry of Economic and Business Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry of Employment]] (~67 billion DKK), [[Ministry of the Interior and Health of Denmark|Ministry of the Interior and Health]] (~66 billion DKK) and [[Ministry of Education of Denmark|Ministry of Education]] (~30 billion DKK) and only slightly larger than that of the [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Denmark|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]] (~14 billion DKK). This list lists the complete expenditures for the Danish [[Ministry of Defence of Denmark|Ministry of Defence]].\n\nThe Danish Defence Force, counting all branches and all departments, itself has an income equal to about 1&ndash;5% of its expenditures, depending on the year. They are not deducted in this listing.\n\nApproximately 95% of the budget goes directly to running the Danish military including the Home guard. Depending on year, 50&ndash;53% accounts for payment to personnel, roughly 14&ndash;21% on acquiring new material, 2&ndash;8% for larger ships, building projects or infrastructure and about 24&ndash;27% on other items, including purchasing of goods, renting, maintenance, services and taxes.\n\nThe remaining 5% is special expenditures to NATO, branch shared expenditures, special services and civil structures, here in including running the [[Danish Maritime Safety Administration]], [[Danish National Rescue Preparedness|Danish national rescue preparedness]] and the Administration of Conscientious Objectors ([http://militaernaegter.dk Milit\u00e6rn\u00e6gteradministrationen]).\n\n'''Danish Defence expenditures (1949\u20131989)'''<ref name=\"[[Danish Agency for Governmental Management]]\">(\"''[http://www.oes.dk/ \u00d8konomi-styrelsen]''\") ([http://www.oes-cs.dk/bevillingslove/] Finance law 1996 to 2006])</ref><ref name=\"[[Danmarks Statistik]]\">(1976&ndash;1989)</ref>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"1\" |1940s\n! colspan=\"10\"|1950s\n! colspan=\"10\"|1960s\n! colspan=\"10\"|1970s\n! colspan=\"10\"|1980s\n|-\n!49 ||50 ||51 ||52 ||53 ||54 ||55 ||56 ||57 ||58 ||59 ||60 ||61 ||62 ||63 ||64 ||65 ||66 ||67 ||68 ||69 ||70 ||71 ||72 ||73 ||74 ||75 ||76 ||77 ||78 ||79 ||80 ||81 ||82 ||83 ||84 ||85 ||86 ||87 ||88 ||89\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |'''Total Budget (Billions) Kr.'''\n|0.36 ||0.36 ||0.48 ||0.68 ||0.89 ||0.89 ||0.92 ||0.94 ||1.01 ||0.99 ||0.99 ||1.11 ||1.18 ||1.55 ||1.65 ||1.76 ||1.97 ||2.08 ||2.25 ||2.60 ||2.64 ||2.97 ||3.20 ||3.39 ||3.52 ||4.46 ||5.36 ||5.71 ||6.38 ||7.29 ||8.05 ||9.12 ||10.30 ||11.67 ||12.57 ||13.05 ||13.34 ||13.33 ||14.65 ||15.62 ||15.96\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |'''Percentage of [[Measures of national income and output#Gross National Product|GNP]]'''\n|2.0 ||1.7 ||2.1 ||2.7 ||3.4 ||3.2 ||3.2 ||3.0 ||3.1 ||2.9 ||2.6 ||2.7 ||1.6 ||3.0 ||3.0 ||2.8 ||2.8 ||2.6 ||2.6 ||2.7 ||2.4 ||2.4 ||2.4 ||2.2 ||2.0 ||2.2 ||2.4 ||2.2 ||2.2 ||2.3 ||2.3 ||2.4 ||2.4 ||2.4 ||2.4 ||2.2 ||2.1 ||1.9 ||2.0 ||2.1 ||2.0\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |'''Defense Spending % Change'''\n| ||-0.3 ||+0.4 ||+0.6 ||+0.7 ||-0.2 ||0.0 ||-0.2 ||+0.1 ||-0.2 ||-0.3 ||+0.1 ||-0.9 ||+1.4 ||0.0 ||-0.2 ||0.0 ||-0.2 ||0.0 ||+0.1 ||-0.3 ||0.0 ||0.0 ||-0.2 ||-0.2 ||+0.2 ||+0.2 ||-0.2 ||0.0 ||+0.1 ||0.0 ||+0.1 ||0.0 ||0.0 ||0.0||-0.2 ||-0.1 ||-0.2 ||+0.1 ||+0.1 ||-0.1\n|}\n\n'''Danish Defence expenditures (1990\u2013)'''<ref name=\"[[Danish Agency for Governmental Management]]\" /><ref name=\"[[Danmarks Statistik]]\" /><ref>{{cite web|author1=Danish Ministry of Defence|authorlink1=Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|title=Defence Economy|url=http://www.fmn.dk/videnom/Pages/ministeromraadetsoekonomi.aspx|website=fmn.dk|accessdate=13 May 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028232520/http://www.fmn.dk/videnom/Pages/ministeromraadetsoekonomi.aspx|archivedate=28 October 2017|language=Danish|date=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" align=\"center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"10\" |1990s\n! colspan=\"10\" |2000s\n! colspan=\"10\" |2010s\n! colspan=\"4\" |2020s\n|-\n!90 ||91 ||92 ||93||94 ||95 ||96 ||97 ||98 ||99 ||00 ||01 ||02 ||03 ||04 ||05 ||06 ||07 ||08 ||09 ||10 ||11 ||12 ||13 ||14 ||15 ||16 ||17 ||18 ||19 ||20 ||21 ||22 ||23\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |'''Total Budget (Billions) Kr.'''\n|16.4 ||17.09 ||17.13 ||17.39 ||17.29 ||17.47 ||17.90 ||18.52 ||19.07 ||19.43 ||19.34 ||21.02 ||21.27 ||21.08 ||21.44 ||20.80 ||23.17 ||22.73 ||24.41 ||23.25 ||25.33 ||24.26 ||25.62 ||23.72 ||25.02 ||22.633 ||24.190 ||25.165 || || || || || ||\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |'''Percentage of [[Measures of national income and output#Gross National Product|GNP]]'''\n|2.0 ||2.0 ||1.9 ||1.9 ||1.8 ||1.7 ||1.7 ||1.6 ||1.6 ||1.6 ||1.5 ||1.6 ||1.5 ||1.5 ||1.5 ||1.3 ||1.4 ||1.3 ||1.4 ||1.4 ||1.4 ||1.4 ||1.4 ||1.3 ||1.3 ||1.1 ||1.16 ||1.17 || || || || || ||\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |'''Defense Spending % Change'''\n|0.0 ||0.0 ||-0.1 ||0.0 ||-0.1 ||-0.1 ||0.0 ||-0.1 ||0.0. ||0.0 ||-0.1 ||+0.1 ||-0.1 ||0.0. ||0.0 ||-0.2 ||+0.1 ||-0.1 ||+0.1 ||0.0 ||0.0 ||0.0 ||0.0 ||-0.1 ||0.0 ||-0.2 ||+0.06 ||+0.01 || || || || || ||\n|}\n\nBecause Denmark has a small and highly specialized military industry, the vast majority of the Danish Defence's equipment is imported from NATO and the [[Nordic countries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cms.polsci.ku.dk/pdf/dk_nato_omdoemme.pdf|title=Danmarks NATO omd\u00f8mme|author=Jens Ringsmose|website=cms.polsci.ku.dk|date=November 2007|publisher=Dansk Institut for Milit\u00e6re Studier}}</ref>\n\n==Branches==\n===Royal Army===\n{{main|Royal Danish Army}}\n[[File:Jydske Dragonregiment (8108898747).jpg|thumb|[[Leopard 2#Leopard 2A5|Leopard 2 A5]] main battle tank]]\nThe Danish Royal Army ({{lang-da|H\u00e6ren}}) consists of 2 brigades, organised into 3 regiments, and a number of support centres, all commanded through the [[Army Staff (Denmark)|Army Staff]].
