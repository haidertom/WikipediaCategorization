These organizations exist on local, national, and international scales. Environmental NGOs vary widely in political views and in the amount they seek to influence the [[environmental policy of the United States]] and other governments. The environmental movement today consists of both large national groups and also many smaller local groups with local concerns. Some resemble the old U.S. conservation movement - whose modern expression is The Nature Conservancy, Audubon Society and National Geographic Society - American organizations with a worldwide influence.\n\n==Scope of the movement==\n* The early [[Conservation movement]], which began in the late 19th century, included [[fisheries]] and [[wildlife management]], water, [[soil]] conservation and [[sustainable forestry]]. Today it includes sustainable yield of natural resources, preservation of [[wilderness]] areas and [[biodiversity]].\n* The modern Environmental movement, which began in the 1960s with concern about air and water pollution, became broader in scope to including all landscapes and human activities. See [[List of environmental issues]].\n* Environmental health movement dating at least to [[Progressive Era]] (1890s - 1920s) urban reforms including clean water supply, more efficient removal of raw sewage and reduction in crowded and unsanitary living conditions. Today Environmental health is more related to nutrition, preventive medicine, aging well and other concerns specific to the human body's well-being.\n* [[Sustainable living|Sustainability movement]] which started in the 1980s focused on [[Gaia theory]], [[value of Earth]] and other interrelations between human sciences and human responsibilities. Its spinoff [[deep ecology]] was more spiritual but often claimed to be science.\n* [[Environmental justice]] is a movement that began in the U.S. in the 1980s and seeks an end to [[environmental racism]]. Often, low-income and minority communities are located close to highways, garbage dumps, and factories, where they are exposed to greater pollution and environmental health risk than the rest of the population. The Environmental Justice movement seeks to link \"social\" and \"ecological\" environmental concerns, while at the same time keeping environmentalists conscious of the dynamics in their own movement, i.e. racism, sexism, homophobia, classicism, and other malaises of dominant culture.\n\nAs public awareness and the environmental sciences have improved in recent years, [[List of environmental issues|environmental issues]] have broadened to include key concepts such as \"[[sustainability]]\" and also new emerging concerns such as [[ozone depletion]], [[global warming]], [[acid rain]], [[land use]] and biogenetic pollution.\n\nEnvironmental movements often interact or are linked with other social movements, e.g. for [[peace]], [[human rights]], and [[animal rights]]; and [[Anti-nuclear movement in the United States|against nuclear weapons and/or nuclear power]], endemic diseases, [[poverty]], [[hunger]], etc.\n\nSome US colleges are now going green by signing the \"President's Climate Commitment,\" a document that a college President can sign to enable said colleges to practice environmentalism by switching to solar power, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidentsclimatecommitment.org/|title=Homepage - Second Nature|website=Second Nature|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Membership of selected US environmental organizations (thousands)<ref>Bosso (2005:54; Bosso and Guber 2006:89), as adapted by Carter (2007:145).</ref>\n|-\n!  !! 1971 !! 1981 !! 1992 !! 1997 !! 2004\n|-\n| [[Sierra Club]] (1892) || 124 || 246 || 615 || 569 || 736\n|-\n| [[National Audubon Society]] (1905) || 115 || 400 || 600 || 550 || 550\n|-\n| [[National Parks Conservation Association]] (1919)  || 49 || 27 || 230 || 375 || 375 \n|-\n| [[Izaak Walton League]] (1922) || 54 || 48 || 51 || 42 || 45 \n|-\n| [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|Wilderness Society]] (1935) || 62 || 52 || 365 || 237 || 225 \n|-\n| [[National Wildlife Federation]] (1936) || 540 || 818 || 997 || 650 || 650 \n|-\n| [[Defenders of Wildlife]] (1947) || 13 || 50 || 77 || 215 || 463 \n|-\n| [[The Nature Conservancy]] (1951) || 22 || 80 || 545 || 865 || 972\n|-\n| [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF-US]] (1961) || n.a. || n.a. || 970 || 1,200 || 1,200\n|-\n| [[Environmental Defense Fund]] (1967) || 20 || 46 || 175 || 300 || 350 \n|-\n| [[Friends of the Earth (US)]] (1969) || 7 || 25 || 30 || 20 || 35\n|-\n| [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (1970) || 5 || 40 || 170 || 260 || 450\n|-\n| [[Greenpeace USA]] (1972) || n.a. || n.a. || 2,225 || 400 || 250\n|}\n\n==History==\nEarly European settlers came to the United States brought from Europe the concept of the [[commons]]. In the colonial era, access to natural resources was allocated by individual towns, and disputes over fisheries or land use were resolved at the local level. Changing technologies, however, strained traditional ways of resolving disputes of resource use, and local governments had limited control over powerful special interests. For example, the damming of rivers for mills cut off upriver towns from fisheries; logging and clearing of forest in watersheds harmed local fisheries downstream. In New England, many farmers became uneasy as they noticed clearing of forest changed stream flows and a decrease in bird population which helped control insects and other pests. These concerns become widely known with the publication of [[Man and Nature]] (1864) by [[George Perkins Marsh]]. The environmental impact method of analysis is generally the main mode for determining what issues the environmental movement is involved in. This model is used to determine how to proceed in situations that are detrimental to the environment by choosing the way that is least damaging and has the fewest lasting implications.<ref name=\"Diversity\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/law/lwsch/journals/bcealr/28_2-3/07_TXT.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 23, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212123120/http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/law/lwsch/journals/bcealr/28_2-3/07_TXT.htm |archive-date=December 12, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Conservation movement===\nConservation first became a national issue during the [[progressive era]]'s [[conservation movement]] (1890s - 1920s). The early national conservation movement shifted emphasis to scientific management which favored larger enterprises and control began to shift from local governments to the states and the federal government.(Judd) Some writers credit sportsmen, hunters and fishermen with the increasing influence of the conservation movement. In the 1870s sportsman magazines such as American Sportsmen, Forest and Stream, and [[Field and Stream]] are seen as leading to the growth of the conservation movement.(Reiger) This conservation movement also urged the establishment of state and national parks and forests, wildlife refuges, and national monuments intended to preserve noteworthy natural features.\nConservation groups focus primarily on an issue that's origins are routed in general expansion. As [[Industrialization]] became more prominent as well as the increasing trend towards [[Urbanization]] the conservative environmental movement began. Contrary to popular belief conservation groups are not against expansion in general, instead they are concerned with efficiency with resources and land development.<ref name=\"Diversity\"/>\n\n===Progressive era===\n[[File:TR-Enviro.JPG|thumb|325px|The conservation policies of [[Theodore Roosevelt]].]]\n[[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his close ally [[George Bird Grinnell]], were motivated by the wanton waste that was taking place at the hand of market hunting. This practice resulted in placing a large number of North American game species on the edge of extinction. Roosevelt recognized that the laissez-faire approach of the U.S. Government was too wasteful and inefficient. In any case, they noted, most of the natural resources in the western states were already owned by the federal government. The best course of action, they argued, was a long-term plan devised by national experts to maximize the long-term economic benefits of natural resources. To accomplish the mission, Roosevelt and Grinnell formed the [[Boone and Crockett Club]] in 1887. The Club was made up of the best minds and influential men of the day. The [[Boone and Crockett Club]]'s contingency of conservationists, scientists, politicians, and intellectuals became Roosevelt's closest advisers during his march to preserve wildlife and habitat across North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdm16013.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p16013coll13/id/1220/rec/1|title=Documents from the February 9, 1888 meeting of the Boone and Crockett Club :: Boone and Crockett Club Records|website=cdm16013.contentdm.oclc.org|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref> As president, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] became a prominent [[conservation movement|conservationist]], putting the issue high on the national agenda.<ref>Douglas Brinkley, ''The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America'' (2009) ch 15-26</ref> He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief advisor on the matter, [[Gifford Pinchot]].  Roosevelt was deeply committed to conserving natural resources, and is considered to be the nation's first [[conservation biology|conservation]] President. He encouraged the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230 million acres (360,000&nbsp;mi\u00b2 or 930,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more Federal land for [[national park]]s and [[nature preserve]]s than all of his predecessors combined.<ref>W. Todd Benson, ''President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservations Legacy'' (2003)</ref>\n\nRoosevelt established the [[United States Forest Service]], signed into law the creation of five [[National parks (United States)|National Parks]], and signed the 1906 [[Antiquities Act]], under which he proclaimed 18 new [[U.S. National Monument]]s. He also established the first 51 [[Bird Reserve]]s, four [[Game Preserve]]s, and 150 [[United States National Forest|National Forests]], including [[Shoshone National Forest]], the nation's first. The area of the United States that he placed under public protection totals approximately {{convert|230000000|acre|km2}}.\n\n[[Gifford Pinchot]] had been appointed by McKinley as chief of Division of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture. In 1905, his department gained control of the national forest reserves.  Pinchot promoted private use (for a fee) under federal supervision. In 1907, Roosevelt designated 16 million acres (65,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of new national forests just minutes before a deadline.\n\nIn May 1908, Roosevelt sponsored the [[Conference of Governors]] held in the White House, with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use. Roosevelt delivered the opening address: \"Conservation as a National Duty.\"\n\nIn 1903 Roosevelt toured the Yosemite Valley with [[John Muir]], who had a very different view of conservation, and tried to minimize commercial use of water resources and forests.  Working through the [[Sierra Club]] he founded, Muir succeeded in 1905 in having Congress transfer the [[Mariposa Grove]] and Yosemite Valley to the [[National Park Service]]. While Muir wanted nature preserved for the sake of pure beauty, Roosevelt subscribed to Pinchot's formulation, \"to make the forest produce the largest amount of whatever crop or service will be most useful, and keep on producing it for generation after generation of men and trees.\"<ref>Gifford Pinchot, ''Breaking New Ground,'' (1947) p. 32.</ref> Muir and the Sierra Club vehemently opposed the damming of the [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]] in Yosemite in order to provide water to the city of San Francisco.  Roosevelt and Pinchot supported the dam, as did President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. The [[Hetch Hetchy]] dam was finished in 1923 and is still in operation, but the Sierra Club still wants to tear it down.<ref>Robert W. Righter, ''The Battle over Hetch Hetchy: America's Most Controversial Dam and the Birth of Modern Environmentalism'' (2005)</ref>\n\nOther influential conservationists of the [[Progressive Era]] included [[George Bird Grinnell]] (a prominent sportsmen who founded the [[Boone and Crockett Club]]), the [[Izaak Walton League]] and [[John Muir]], the founder of the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892. Conservationists organized the [[National Parks Conservation Association]], the [[Audubon Society]], and other groups that still remain active.\n\n===New Deal===\n[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] (1933\u201345), like his cousin Theodore Roosevelt, was an ardent conservationist.  He used numerous programs of the departments of Agriculture and Interior<ref>T.H. Watkins, ''Righteous Pilgrim: The Life and Times of Harold L. Ickes, 1874-1952'' (1990)</ref> to end wasteful land-use, mitigate the effects of the [[Dust Bowl]], and efficiently develop natural resources in the West.<ref>David B. Woolner and Henry L. Henderson, eds. ''FDR and the Environment'' (2009)</ref> One of the most popular of all [[New Deal]] programs was the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (1933\u20131943), which sent two million poor young men to work in rural and wilderness areas, primarily on conservation projects.<ref>Neil M. Maher, ''Nature's New Deal: The Civilian Conservation Corps and the Roots of the American Environmental Movement'' (2007)</ref>\n\n===Post 1945===\nAfter World War II increasing encroachment on wilderness land evoked the continued resistance of conservationists, who succeeded in blocking a number of projects in the 1950s and 1960s, including the proposed [[Bridge Canyon Dam]] that would have backed up the waters of the Colorado River into the [[Grand Canyon National Park]].\n\nThe Inter-American Conference on the Conservation of Renewable Natural Resources met in 1948 as a collection of nearly 200 scientists from all over the Americans forming the trusteeship principle that:\n\n\"No generation can exclusively own the renewable resources by which it lives.  We hold the commonwealth in trust for prosperity, and to lessen or destroy it is to commit treason against the future\"<ref>''New York Times'', September 18, 1948 in Fairchild, W.B. (1949) \"Renewable Resources: A World Dilemma: Recent Publications on Conservation\", ''Geographical Review'' 39 (1) pp. 86 - 98</ref>\n\n====Beginning of the modern movement====\n[[File:Earth Day Flag.png|thumb|200px|right|Earth Day Flag]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, several events occurred which raised the public awareness of harm to the environment caused by man. In 1954, the 23 man crew of the Japanese fishing vessel ''[[Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru|Lucky Dragon]]'' was exposed to radioactive fallout from a hydrogen bomb test at [[Bikini Atoll]], in 1969, an ecologically [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill|catastrophic oil spill]] from an offshore well in California's Santa Barbara Channel, Barry Commoner's protest against nuclear testing, [[Rachel Carson]]'s book [[Silent Spring]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich]]'s [[The Population Bomb]] all added anxiety about the environment. Pictures of Earth from space emphasized that the earth was small and fragile. {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nAs the public became more aware of environmental issues, concern about [[Air pollution in the United States|air pollution]], [[water pollution in the United States|water pollution]], solid waste disposal, dwindling energy resources, radiation, pesticide poisoning (particularly as described in Rachel Carson's influential Silent Spring, 1962), noise pollution, and other environmental problems engaged a broadening number of sympathizers. That public support for environmental concerns was widespread became clear in the [[Earth Day]] demonstrations of 1970. {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nUnlike the [[Progressive Era]]'s conservation movement (1890s - 1920s), which was largely elitist consisting of largely of wealthy, politically powerful men, the modern environmental movement was a social movement with more popular support. The environmental movement borrowed tactics from both the successful [[civil rights movement]] and the protests against the [[Vietnam war]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n====Wilderness preservation====\nIn the modern wilderness preservation movement, important philosophical roles are played by the writings of [[John Muir]] who had been activist in the late 19th and early 20th century. Along with Muir perhaps most influential in the modern movement is [[Henry David Thoreau]] who published [[Walden]] in 1854.  Also important was [[forester]] and [[ecologist]] [[Aldo Leopold]], one of the founders of the Wilderness Society in 1935, who wrote a classic of nature observation and ethical philosophy, ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'', [[1949 in literature|published in 1949]]. Other philosophical foundations were established by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]].\n\nThere is also a growing movement of campers and other people who enjoy outdoor recreation activities to help preserve the environment while spending time in the wilderness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truenorthathletics.com/minimize-the-impacts-of-camping/|title=13 Ways to Minimize the Impacts of Camping & Other Outdoor Activities - True North Athletics|date=November 14, 2015|website=Truenorthathletics.com|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Anti-nuclear movement====\n{{Main|Anti-nuclear movement in the United States}}\nThe anti-nuclear movement in the United States consists of more than 80 [[anti-nuclear]] groups which have acted to oppose [[nuclear power]] or [[nuclear weapons]], or both, in the United States. These groups include the [[Abalone Alliance]], [[Clamshell Alliance]], [[Institute for Energy and Environmental Research]], [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service]], and [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]]. The anti-nuclear movement has delayed construction or halted commitments to build some new nuclear plants,<ref name=protest/> and has pressured the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] to enforce and strengthen the safety regulations for nuclear power plants.<ref>Jerry Brown and [[Rinaldo Brutoco]] (1997).

David Freeman]], [[John Gofman]], [[Arnold Gundersen]], [[Mark Z. Jacobson]], [[Amory Lovins]], [[Arjun Makhijani]], [[Gregory Minor]], [[Joseph Romm]] and [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]]. Scientists who have opposed nuclear weapons include [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Eugene Rabinowitch]].\n\n[[File:Love Canal protest.jpg|thumb|200px|Protest about the Love Canal contamination by a resident, ca. 1978]]\n\n====Antitoxics groups====\n\nAntitoxics groups are a subgroup that is affiliated with the Environmental Movement in the United States, that is primarily concerned with the effects that cities and their by products have on humans. This aspect of the movement is a self-proclaimed \"movement of housewives\".<ref name=\"Diversity\"/> Concern around the issues of ground water contamination and air pollution rose in the early 1980s and individuals involved in antitoxics groups claim that they are concerned for the health of their families.<ref name=\"Diversity\"/>\nA prominent case can be seen in the Love Canal Homeowner's association (LCHA); in this case a housing development was built on a site that had been used for toxic dumping by the Hooker Chemical Company. As a result of this dumping the residents had symptoms of skin irritation, [[Lois Gibbs]], a resident of the development, started a grassroots campaign for reparations. Eventual success led to the government having to purchase homes that were sold in the development.<ref name=\"Diversity\"/>\n\n====Federal legislation in the 1970s====\nPrior to the 1970s the protection of basic air and water supplies was a matter mainly left to each state. During the 1970s, primary responsibility for clean air and water shifted to the federal government. Growing concerns, both environmental and economic, from cities and towns as well as sportsman and other local groups, and senators such as Maine's [[Edmund S. Muskie]], led to passage of extensive legislation, notably the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] of 1970 and the [[Water Pollution Control Act]] Amendments of 1972. Other legislation included the 1970 [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA), which established the [[Council on Environmental Quality]]; the [[Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972]]; the [[Endangered Species Act]] of 1973, the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (1974), the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (1976), the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1977, which became known as the [[Clean Water Act]], and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as the [[Superfund|Superfund Act]] (1980). These laws regulated public drinking water systems, toxic substances, pesticides, and ocean dumping; and protected wildlife, wilderness, and wild and scenic rivers. Moreover, the new laws provide for pollution research, standard setting, contaminated site cleanup, monitoring, and enforcement.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe creation of these laws led to a major shift in the environmental movement. Groups such as the Sierra Club shifted focus from local issues to becoming a lobby in Washington and new groups, for example, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense, arose to influence politics as well. (Larson){{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Renewed focus on local action===\nIn the 1980s President [[Ronald Reagan]] sought to curtail scope of environmental protection taking steps such as appointing [[James G. Watt]] who was called one of the most \"blatantly anti-environmental political appointees\". The major environmental groups responded with mass mailings which led to increased membership and donations.  The large environmental organization increasingly relied on ties within Washington, D.C. to advance their environmental agenda. At the same time membership in environmental groups became more suburban and urban. Groups such as animal rights, and the gun control lobby became linked with environmentalism while sportsmen, farmers and ranchers were no longer influential in the movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nWhen industry groups lobbied to weaken regulation and a backlash against environmental regulations, the so-called [[wise use]] movement gained importance and influence. The wise use movement and anti-environmental groups were able to portray environmentalist as out of touch with mainstream values. (Larson){{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===\"Post-environmentalism\"===\nIn 2004, with the environmental movement seemingly stalled, some environmentalists started questioning whether \"environmentalism\" was even a useful political framework.  According to a controversial essay titled \"[http://www.thebreakthrough.org/images/Death_of_Environmentalism.pdf The Death of Environmentalism ]\" ([[Michael Shellenberger]] and [[Ted Nordhaus]], 2004) American environmentalism has been remarkably successful in protecting the air, water, and large stretches of wilderness in [[North America]] and Europe, but these environmentalists have stagnated as a vital force for cultural and political change.\n\nShellenberger and Nordhaus wrote, \"Today environmentalism is just another special interest. Evidence for this can be found in its concepts, its proposals, and its reasoning. What stands out is how arbitrary environmental leaders are about what gets counted and what doesn't as 'environmental.' Most of the movement's leading thinkers, funders, and advocates do not question their most basic assumptions about who we are, what we stand for, and what it is that we should be doing.\" Their essay was followed by a speech in San Francisco called \"Is Environmentalism Dead?\" by former Sierra Club President, [[Adam Werbach]], who argued for the evolution of environmentalism into a more expansive, relevant and powerful progressive politics. Werbach endorsed building an environmental movement that is more relevant to average Americans, and controversially chose to lead Wal-Mart's effort to take sustainability mainstream.\n\nThese \"post-environmental movement\" thinkers argue that the ecological crises the human species faces in the 21st century are qualitatively different from the problems the environmental movement was created to address in the 1960s and 1970s. They argue that climate change and [[habitat destruction]] are global and more complex, therefore demanding far deeper transformations of the economy, the culture and political life. The consequence of environmentalism's outdated and arbitrary definition, they argue, is political irrelevancy.\n\nThese \"politically neutral\" groups tend to avoid global conflicts and view the settlement of inter-human conflict as separate from regard for nature - in direct contradiction to the ecology movement and peace movement which have increasingly close links: while Green Parties, [[Greenpeace]], and groups like the ACTivist Magazine regard ecology, biodiversity, and an end to non-human extinction as an absolute basis for peace, the local groups may not, and see a high degree of global competition and conflict as justifiable if it lets them preserve their own local uniqueness. However, such groups tend not to \"burn out\" and to sustain for long periods, even generations, protecting the same local treasures.\n\nLocal groups increasingly find that they benefit from collaboration, e.g. on consensus decision making methods, or making [[simultaneous policy]], or relying on common legal resources, or even sometimes a common glossary. However, the differences between the various groups that make up the modern environmental movement tend to outweigh such similarities, and they rarely co-operate directly except on a few major global questions. In a notable exception, over 1,000 local groups from around the country united for a single day of action as part of the [[Step It Up 2007]] campaign for real solutions to global warming.\n\nGroups such as The Bioregional Revolution are calling on the need to bridge these differences, as the converging problems of the 21st century they claim compel the people to unite and to take decisive action. They promote [[bioregionalism]], [[permaculture]], and local economies as solutions to these problems, [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[global warming]], [[epidemics|global epidemics]], and [[water scarcity]], but most notably to \"[[peak oil]]\"\u2014the prediction that the country is likely to reach a maximum in global oil production which could spell drastic changes in many aspects of the residents' everyday lives.\n\n==Environmental rights==\nMany environmental lawsuits turn on the question of who has standing; are the legal issues limited to property owners, or does the general public have a right to intervene? Christopher D. Stone's 1972 essay, \"Should trees have standing?\" seriously addressed the question of whether natural objects themselves should have [[legal rights]], including the right to participate in lawsuits. Stone suggested that there was nothing absurd in this view, and noted that many entities now regarded as having legal rights were, in the past, regarded as \"things\" that were regarded as legally rightless; for example, aliens, children and women. His essay is sometimes regarded as an example of the [[Reification (fallacy)|fallacy of hypostatization]].\n\nOne of the earliest lawsuits to establish that citizens may sue for environmental and aesthetic harms was Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission, decided in 1965 by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The case helped halt the construction of a power plant on Storm King Mountain in New York State. See also [[United States environmental law]] and [[David Sive]], an attorney who was involved in the case.\n\n==Role of science==\nConservation biology is an important and rapidly developing field.\n\nOne way to avoid the stigma of an \"ism\" was to evolve early anti-nuclear groups into the more scientific Green Parties, sprout new NGOs such as Greenpeace and Earth Action, and devoted groups to protecting global biodiversity and preventing global warming and climate change. But in the process, much of the emotional appeal, and many of the original aesthetic goals were lost.  Nonetheless, these groups have well-defined ethical and political views, backed by science.\n\n==Criticisms{{anchor|Criticisms_of_the_environmental_movement}}==\nSome people are [[environmental skepticism|skeptical of the environmental movement]] and feel that it is more deeply rooted in politics than science. Although there have been serious [[global warming controversy|debates about climate change]] and effects of some [[endocrine disruptors|pesticides and herbicides that mimic animal sex steroids]], science has shown that some of the claims of environmentalists have credence.\n\nClaims made by environmentalists may be perceived as veiled attacks on industry and globalization rather than legitimate environmental concerns. Detractors note that a significant number of environmental theories and predictions have been inaccurate{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and suggest that the regulations recommended by environmentalists will more likely harm society rather than help nature.\n\n===DDT===\n{{main|DDT}}\nSpecific examples include when [[Rachel Carson]], in her book ''Silent Spring'', suggested that the pesticide [[DDT]] caused cancer and drastically harmed ecosystems. DDT is highly toxic to aquatic life, including crawfish, daphnids, sea shrimp and many species of fish. However, [[DDT#Use against malaria|DDT is also used to control malaria]].\n\nProminent novelist and Harvard Medical School graduate [[Michael Crichton]] appeared before the U.S. [[Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works]] to address such concerns and recommended the employment of [[double-blind experiment]]ation in environmental research.  Crichton suggested that because environmental issues are so political in nature, policy makers need neutral, conclusive data to base their decisions on, rather than conjecture and rhetoric, and double-blind experiments are the most efficient way to achieve that aim.\n\nA consistent theme acknowledged by both supporters and critics (though more commonly vocalized by critics) of the environmental movement is that we know very little about the Earth we live in. Most fields of environmental studies are relatively new, and therefore what research we have is limited and does not date far enough back for us to completely understand long-term environmental trends. This has led a number of environmentalists to support the use of the [[precautionary principle]] in policy making, which ultimately asserts that we don't know how certain actions may affect the environment, and because there is reason to believe they may cause more harm than good we should refrain from such actions.\n\n===Elitist===\n{{see also|Environmental justice#Initial barriers to minority participation}}\nIn the December 1994 ''Wild Forest Review,'' Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair wrote \"The mainstream environmental movement was elitist, highly paid, detached from the people, indifferent to the working class, and a firm ally of big government.\u2026The environmental movement is now accurately perceived as just another well-financed and cynical special interest group, its rancid infrastructure supported by Democratic Party operatives and millions in grants from corporate foundations.\"\n\n===Wilderness myth===\nHistorian and President of the American Historical Association [[William Cronon]] has criticized the modern environmental movement for having a romantic idealizations of [[wilderness]]. Cronon writes \"wilderness serves as the unexamined foundation on which so many of the quasi-religious values of modern environmentalism rest.\" Cronon claims that \"to the extent that we live in an urban-industrial civilization but at the same time pretend to ourselves that our real home is in the wilderness, to just that extent we give ourselves permission to evade responsibility for the lives we actually lead.\"\n\nSimilarly [[Michael Pollan]] has argued that the wilderness ethic leads people to dismiss areas whose wildness is less than absolute. In his book Second Nature, Pollan writes that \"once a landscape is no longer 'virgin' it is typically written off as fallen, lost to nature, irredeemable.\"\n\n===Debates within the movement===\nWithin the environmental movement an ideological debate has taken place between those with an [[ecocentric]] view point and an [[anthropocentric]] view point. The anthropocentric view has been seen as the conservationist approach to the environment with nature viewed, at least in part, as resource to be used by man. In contrast to the conservationist approach the ecocentric view, associated with [[John Muir]], [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[William Wordsworth]] referred to as the preservationist movement.  This approach sees nature in a more spiritual way. Many environmental historians consider the split between John Muir and [[Gifford Pinchot]]. During the preservation / conservation debate the term preservationist become to be seen as a pejorative term.\n\nWhile the ecocentric view focused on biodiversity and wilderness protection the anthropocentric view focus on urban pollution and social justice. Some environmental writers, for example [[William Cronon]] have criticized the ecocentric view as have a dualist view as man being separate from nature. Critics of the anthropocentric view point contend that the environmental movement has been taken over by so-called [[leftist]] with an agenda beyond environmental protection.\n\nSeveral books after the middle of the 20th century contributed to the rise of American environmentalism (as distinct from the longer-established conservation movement), especially among college and university students and the more literate public.  One was the publication of the first textbook on [[ecology]], ''[[Fundamentals of Ecology]],'' by [[Eugene Odum]] and [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]], in 1953.  Another was the appearance of the best-seller ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by [[Rachel Carson]], in 1962. Her book brought about a whole new interpretation on pesticides by exposing their harmful effects in nature. From this book many began referring to Carson as the \"mother of the environmental movement\".  Another influential development was a 1965 lawsuit, Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission, opposing the construction of a power plant on [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]], which is said to have given birth to modern [[United States environmental law]]. The wide popularity of ''The [[Whole Earth Catalog]]s'', starting in 1968, was quite influential among the younger, hands-on, activist generation of the 1960s and 1970s. Recently, in addition to opposing environmental degradation and protecting wilderness, an increased focus on coexisting with natural biodiversity has appeared, a strain that is apparent in the movement for [[sustainable agriculture]] and in the concept of [[Reconciliation Ecology]].\n\n==Environmentalism and politics==\n{{Repetition section|date=February 2018}}\nEnvironmentalists became much more influential in American politics after the creation or strengthening of numerous U.S. environmental laws, including the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] and [[Clean Water Act]] and the formation of the US Environmental Protection Agency, or [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] in 1970. These successes were followed by the enactment of a whole series of laws regulating [[waste]] ([[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]]), [[Toxin|toxic substances]] ([[Toxic Substances Control Act]]), [[pesticides]] (FIFRA: [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]]), clean-up of polluted sites ([[Superfund]]), protection of [[endangered species]] ([[Endangered Species Act]]), and more.\n\nFewer environmental laws have been passed in the last decade as corporations and other [[American conservatism|conservative]] interests have increased their influence over [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  Corporate cooperation against environmental lobbyists has been organized by the [[Wise use|Wise Use]] group.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} At the same time, many environmentalists have been turning toward other means of persuasion, such as working with business, community, and other partners to promote [[sustainable development]].\n\nMuch environmental activism is directed towards [[conservation movement|conservation]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} as well as the prevention or elimination of pollution. However, [[conservation movement]]s, [[ecology movement]]s, [[peace movement]]s, [[green parties]], [[green anarchism|green-]] and [[eco-anarchism|eco-anarchists]] often subscribe to very different ideologies, while supporting the same goals as those who call themselves \"environmentalists\".  To outsiders, these groups or factions can appear to be indistinguishable.\n\nAs [[World population|human population]] and industrial activity continue to increase, environmentalists often find themselves in serious conflict with those who believe that human and industrial activities should not be overly regulated or restricted, such as some [[Libertarianism|libertarians]].\n\nEnvironmentalists often clash with others, particularly \"corporate interests,\" over issues of the management of [[natural resources]], like in the case of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] as a \"carbon dump\", the focus of [[climate change]], and [[global warming]] controversy.  They usually seek to protect commonly owned or unowned resources for future generations.\n\n===Radical environmentalism===\n{{main|Radical environmentalism}}\nWhile most environmentalists are mainstream and peaceful, a small minority are more radical in their approach. Adherents of [[radical environmentalism]] and [[green anarchism|ecological anarchism]] are involved in [[direct action]] campaigns to protect the environment.  Some campaigns have employed controversial tactics including [[sabotage]], [[blockade]]s, and [[arson]], while most use peaceful protests such as marches, tree-sitting, and the like.  There is substantial debate within the environmental movement as to the acceptability of these tactics, but almost all environmentalists condemn [[Violence|violent]] actions that can harm [[humans]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Environmental issues in the United States]]\n* ''[[Earth Days]]'', a 2009 documentary feature film about the start of the environmental movement in the United States.\n* [[Environmentalism (Critique of George W.

From ancient times through the first millennium, Greek was the most prevalent shared language in the demographic regions where the [[Byzantine Empire]] flourished, and Greek, being the language in which the New Testament was written, was the primary liturgical language of the church. For this reason, the eastern churches were sometimes identified as \"Greek\" (in contrast to the \"Roman\" or \"Latin\" church, which used a Latin translation of the Bible), even before the great schism. After 1054, \"Greek Orthodox\" or \"Greek Catholic\" marked a church as being in communion with Constantinople, much as \"Catholic\" did for communion with Rome. This identification with Greek, however, became increasingly confusing with time. Missionaries brought Orthodoxy to many regions without ethnic Greeks, where the Greek language was not spoken. In addition, struggles between Rome and Constantinople to control parts of southeastern Europe resulted in the conversion of some churches to Rome, which then also used \"Greek Catholic\" to indicate their continued use of the Byzantine rites. Today, many of those same churches remain, while a very large number of Orthodox are not of Greek national origin, and do not use Greek as the language of worship.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Brittanica Online || loc=[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/177174/Eastern-Orthodoxy \"Eastern Orthodoxy\"] \"Because of the use of the name \"Greek Catholics\" by the Eastern churches of the Catholic Church and the historical links of the Orthodox Catholic church with the Eastern Roman Empire and Byzantium (Constantinople), however, the [[exonym]]s in American English usage referred to it as the \"Eastern\" or \"Greek Orthodox\" Church. These terms are sometimes misleading, especially when applied to Russian or Slavic churches and to the Orthodox communities in western Europe and America.\"}} \"Eastern\", then, indicates the geographical element in the Church's origin and development, while \"Orthodox\" indicates the faith, as well as communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.<ref name=Calivas1983 /> There are additional Christian churches in the east that are in communion with neither Rome nor Constantinople, who tend to be distinguished by the category named \"Oriental Orthodox\". While the Church continues officially to call itself \"Catholic\", for reasons of universality, the common title of \"Eastern Orthodox Church\" avoids casual confusion with the Catholic Church.\n\n===Orthodoxy===\n[[File:Byzantinischer Mosaizist um 1000 002.jpg|thumb|[[Emperor Constantine]] presents a representation of the city of [[Constantinople]] as tribute to an enthroned Mary and baby Jesus in this church mosaic. [[Hagia Sophia]], c. 1000).]]\n\nThe first known use of the phrase \"the catholic church\" (''he katholike ekklesia'') occurred in a letter written about 110 AD from one Greek church to another ([[Saint Ignatius of Antioch]] to the [[Smyrna]]eans) The letter states: \"Wheresoever the bishop shall appear, there let the people be, even as where Jesus may be, there is the universal [katholike] Church.\"<ref name=\"CathEnc1910_Catholic\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03449a.htm|work=The Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Catholic|last=Thurston |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Thurston|place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company|date=1908 |accessdate=17 August 2012|editor-first=Kevin |editor-last=Knight |editor-link=Knight |volume=3}}</ref> Thus, almost from the very beginning, Christians referred to the Church as the \"One, Holy, [[Catholic (term)|Catholic]] (from the Greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, or \"according to the whole, universal\") and Apostolic Church\".{{sfn|Hardon|1981|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=3Ke37zpSv3gC&pg=PA217 217]}} The Eastern Orthodox Church claims that it is today the continuation and preservation of that same Church.\n\nA number of other Christian churches also make a similar claim: the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian Church]] and the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]]. In the Eastern Orthodox view, the Assyrians and Orientals left the Orthodox Church in the years following the Third Ecumenical [[Council of Ephesus]] (431) and the Fourth Ecumenical [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451), respectively, in their refusal to accept those councils' [[Christology|Christological]] definitions. Similarly, the churches in Rome and Constantinople separated in an event known as the [[East\u2013West Schism]], traditionally dated to the year 1054, although it was more a gradual process than a sudden break. The [[Church of England]] separated from the Catholic Church, not directly from the Eastern Orthodox Church, for the first time in the 1530s (and, after a brief reunion in 1555, again finally in 1558). Thus, though it was united to Orthodoxy when established through the work of [[Saint Augustine of Canterbury]] in the early 7th century, its separation from Orthodoxy came about indirectly through the See of Rome.\n\nTo all these churches, the claim to catholicity (universality, oneness with the ancient church) is important for multiple doctrinal reasons that have more bearing internally in each church than in their relation to the others, now separated in faith. The meaning of holding to a faith that is true is the primary reason why anyone's statement of which church split off from which other has any significance at all; the issues go as deep as the schisms. The depth of this meaning in the Eastern Orthodox Church is registered first in its use of the word \"[[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]]\" itself, a union of [[Greek language|Greek]] ''orthos'' (\"straight\", \"correct\", \"true\", \"right\") and ''[[doxa]]'' (\"common belief\", from the ancient verb \u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03ad\u03c9-\u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u1ff6 which is translated \"to believe\", \"to think\", \"to consider\", \"to imagine\", \"to assume\").<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddoke%2Fw \u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03ad\u03c9] in Liddell and Scott</ref>\n\nThe dual meanings of ''doxa'', with \"glory\" or \"glorification\" (of God by the Church and of the Church by God), especially in worship, yield the pair \"correct belief\" and \"true worship\". Together, these express the core of a fundamental teaching about the inseparability of belief and worship and their role in drawing the Church together with Christ.{{sfn|Ware|1991|pp=16, 271}}{{sfn|Hierotheos|1998|pp=69-72}} The [[Bulgaria]]n and all the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] churches use the title ''Pravoslavie'' ([[Cyrillic alphabets|Cyrillic]]: \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0435), meaning \"correctness of glorification\", to denote what is in English ''Orthodoxy'', while the Georgians use the title ''Martlmadidebeli''. Several other churches in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]] also came to use ''Orthodox'' in their titles, but are still distinct from the Eastern Orthodox Church as described in this article.\n\nThe term \"Eastern Church\" (the geographic east in the East\u2013West Schism) has been used to distinguish it from western [[Christendom]] (the geographic West, which at first came to designate the Catholic communion, later also the various Protestant and Anglican branches). \"Eastern\" is used to indicate that the highest concentrations of the Eastern Orthodox Church presence remain in the eastern part of the Christian world, although it is growing worldwide. Orthodox Christians throughout the world use various ethnic or national jurisdictional titles, or more inclusively, the title \"Eastern Orthodox\", \"Orthodox Catholic\", or simply \"Orthodox\".<ref name=\"Calivas1983\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7052/|title=The Orthodox Church: An Introduction|date=9 January 1996|website=[[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=Thomas|accessdate=11 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603103953/http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7052|archivedate=3 June 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\nWhat unites Orthodox Christians is the catholic faith as carried through Holy Tradition. That faith is expressed most fundamentally in Scripture and in worship,{{sfn|Ware|1991|pp=212-213}} and the latter most essentially through the Mystery of Baptism and in the Divine Liturgy.{{sfn|Ware|1991|p=282}} The faith lives and breathes by God's energies in communion with the Church. Inter-communion is the litmus test by which all can see that two churches share the same faith; lack of inter-communion (excommunication, literally \"out of communion\") is the sign of different faiths, even though some central theological points may be shared. The sharing of beliefs can be highly significant, but it is not the full measure of the faith.\n\nThe lines of even this test can blur, however, when differences that arise are not due to doctrine, but to recognition of jurisdiction. As the Eastern Orthodox Church has spread into the west and over the world, the church as a whole has yet to sort out all the inter-jurisdictional issues that have arisen in the expansion, leaving some areas of doubt about what is proper church governance.{{sfn|Ware|1991|pp=180-199}} And as in the ancient church persecutions, the aftermath of modern persecutions of Christians in communist nations has left behind both some governance and some faith issues that have yet to be completely resolved.{{sfn|Ware|1991|pp=152-179}}\n\nAll members of the Eastern Orthodox Church profess the same faith, regardless of race or nationality, jurisdiction or local custom, or century of birth. Holy Tradition encompasses the understandings and means by which that unity of faith is transmitted across boundaries of time, geography, and culture. It is a continuity that exists only inasmuch as it lives within Christians themselves.{{sfn|Ware|1991|pp=203-204}} It is not static, nor an observation of rules, but rather a sharing of observations that spring both from within and also in keeping with others, even others who lived lives long past. The Holy Spirit maintains the unity and consistency of the Holy Tradition to preserve the integrity of the faith within the Church, as given in the Scriptural promises.<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|John|14:17|NKJV}}; {{Bibleverse|John|14:26|NKJV}}</ref>\n\nThe shared beliefs of Orthodoxy, and its theology, exist within Holy Tradition and cannot be separated from it, for their meaning is not expressed in mere words alone.{{sfn|Ware|1991|p=215}} Doctrine cannot be understood unless it is prayed.<ref>{{citation |last1=Evagrius the Solitary |authorlink1=Evagrius Ponticus |chapter=On Prayer, 60 |origyear=4th century|editor1-last=Migne |editor1-first=J.

The doctrine of [[Catholicity of the Church]], as derived from the [[Nicene Creed]], is essential to Eastern Orthodox [[ecclesiology]]. The term ''Catholicity of the Church'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f18\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}) is used in its original sense, as a designation for the [[Universality of the Church]], centered around Christ. Therefore, the Eastern Orthodox notion of [[catholicity]] is not centered around any singular see, unlike Catholicism, that has one earthly center.\n\nDue to the influence of the Catholic Church in the west, where the English language itself developed, the words \"catholic\" and \"catholicity\" are sometimes used to refer to that church specifically. However, the more prominent dictionary sense given for general use is still the one shared by other languages, implying breadth and universality, reflecting comprehensive scope.{{sfn|American Heritage Dict|5th ed|p=294 [http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=catholicity \"catholicity\"]}} In a Christian context, the Christian Church, as identified with the original church founded by Christ and his apostles, is said to be catholic (or universal) in regard to its union with Christ in faith. Just as Christ is indivisible, so are union with Him and faith in him, whereby the church is \"universal\", unseparated, and comprehensive, including all who share that faith. Orthodox bishop [[Kallistos Ware]] has called that \"simple Christianity\".{{sfn|Ware|1991|p=16}} That is the sense of early and [[patristic]] usage wherein the church usually refers to itself as the \"Catholic Church\",{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Christianity|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=7ly4DgtT3LkC&pg=PA867 867]}}{{sfn|Leith|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=saFgJRjaPwcC&pg=PA486 486]}} whose faith is the \"Orthodox faith\". It is also the sense within the phrase \"[[One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church]]\", found in the [[Nicene Creed]], and referred to in Orthodox worship, e.g. in the litany of the catechumens in the [[divine liturgy]].\n\nWith the mutual excommunications of the [[East\u2013West Schism]] in 1054, the churches in Rome and Constantinople each viewed the other as having departed from the [[One true church|true church]], leaving a smaller but still-catholic church in place. Each retained the \"Catholic\" part of its title, the \"[[Catholic Church]]\" (or the \"Roman Catholic Church\") on the one hand, and the \"Orthodox Catholic Church\" on the other, each of which was defined in terms of inter-communion with either Rome or Constantinople. While the Eastern Orthodox Church recognizes what it shares in common with other churches, including the Catholic Church, it sees catholicity in terms of complete union in communion and faith, with the church throughout all time, and the sharing remains incomplete when not shared fully.\n\n==Organization and leadership==\n{{Main|Orthodox Church organization}}\n[[File:Stgeorgeistanbul3.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|left|The exterior of the [[Church of St. George, Istanbul|Patriarchal Basilica of St. George]], of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Patriarchate of Constantinople]], located in the Fener (''Fanari'') district of Istanbul.]]\n\nThe religious authority for Eastern Orthodoxy is not a Patriarch or the Pope as in Catholicism, nor the Bible as in [[Protestantism]], but the scriptures as interpreted by the seven ecumenical councils of the Church. The Eastern Orthodox Church is a fellowship of \"[[Autocephaly|autocephalous]]\" ([[Greek language|Greek]] for self-headed) Churches, with the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] being the only autocephalous head who holds the title ''[[first among equals|primus inter pares]]'', meaning \"first among equals\" in [[Latin language|Latin]]. The Patriarch of Constantinople has the honor of primacy, but his title is only first among equals and has no real authority over Churches other than the Constantinopolitan.<ref name=brit /><ref name=bbc>{{cite web|title=Eastern Orthodox Church|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/easternorthodox_1.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=religionfacts>{{cite web|title=Eastern Ortthodoxy|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/orthodox-christianity|website=www.religionfacts.com|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref> The Eastern Orthodox Church considers [[Jesus]] Christ to be the head of the Church and the Church to be his body. It is believed that authority and the [[Divine grace|grace of God]] is directly passed down to Orthodox [[bishop]]s and [[clergy]] through the [[laying on of hands]]\u2014a practice started by the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]], and that this unbroken historical and physical link is an essential element of the true Church (Acts 8:17, 1 Tim 4:14, Heb 6:2). However, the Church asserts that apostolic succession also requires apostolic faith, and bishops without apostolic faith, who are in [[heresy]], forfeit their claim to apostolic succession.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Fr.

These include the fourteen autocephalous churches of [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East|Antioch]], [[Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgia]], [[Church of Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgaria]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbia]], [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]], [[Church of Greece|Greece]], [[Polish Orthodox Church|Poland]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romania]], [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albania]], and [[Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church|Czech Republic and Slovakia]], which were officially invited to the [[Pan-Orthodox Council]] of 2016,<ref name=council2016>{{cite web|url=https://www.holycouncil.org/churches|title=The Orthodox Churches - The Holy and Great Council of the Orthodox Church|website=www.holycouncil.org}}</ref> as well as a number of autonomous Churches.<ref name=bbc /> Each church has a ruling [[bishop]] and a [[Holy Synod]] to administer its jurisdiction and to lead the Orthodox Church in the preservation and teaching of the apostolic and [[wikt:patristic|patristic]] traditions and church practices.\n\nEach bishop has a territory ([[episcopal see|see]]) over which he governs.<ref name=religionfacts /> His main duty is to make sure the traditions and practices of the Orthodox Church are preserved. Bishops are equal in authority and cannot interfere in the jurisdiction of another bishop. Administratively, these bishops and their territories are organized into various [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] groups or [[synod]]s of [[bishop]]s who gather together at least twice a year to discuss the state of affairs within their respective sees. While bishops and their autocephalous synods have the ability to administer guidance in individual cases, their actions do not usually set precedents that affect the entire Eastern Orthodox Church. Bishops are almost always chosen from the monastic ranks and must remain unmarried.\n\n=== Church councils ===\nThere have been a number of times when alternative theological ideas arose to challenge the Orthodox faith. At such times the Orthodox communion deemed it necessary to convene a general or [[Ecumenical council|\"great\" council]] of all available bishops throughout the world. The Orthodox Church holds that [[first seven Ecumenical Councils|seven ecumenical councils]], held between the 4th and the 8th centuries, are authoritative.\n\n[[File:Rylands Nicene Creed papyrus.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Oldest extant manuscript of the [[Nicene Creed]], dated to the 5th Century]]\n\nThe ecumenical councils followed a democratic form, with each bishop having one vote. Though present and allowed to speak before the council, members of the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]]/[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] court, abbots, priests, deacons, monks and laymen were not allowed to vote. The primary goal of these Great Synods was to verify and confirm the fundamental beliefs of the Great Christian Church as truth, and to remove as heresy any false teachings that would threaten the Church. The [[Pope|Pope of Rome]] at that time held the position of \"[[Primus inter pares|first among equals]]\" and, while he was not present at any of the councils, he continued to hold this title until the [[East\u2013West Schism]] of 1054.\n\nOther councils have helped to define the Eastern Orthodox position, specifically the [[Quinisext Council]], the Synods of [[Constantinople]], [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|879\u2013880]], [[Fifth Council of Constantinople|1341, 1347, 1351]], 1583, 1819, and [[Phyletism|1872]], the [[Synod of Jassy]] (Ia\u0219i), 1642, and the Pan-Orthodox [[Synod of Jerusalem (1672)|Synod of Jerusalem]], 1672; the [[Pan-Orthodox Council]], held in Greece in 2016, was the only such Eastern Orthodox council in modern times.\n\nAccording to Orthodox teaching the position of \"First Among Equals\" gives no additional power or authority to the bishop that holds it, but rather that this person sits as organizational head of a council of equals (like a president). His words and opinions carry no more insight or wisdom than any other bishop. It is believed that the Holy Spirit guides the Eastern Orthodox Church through the decisions of the entire council, not one individual. Additionally it is understood that even the council\u2019s decisions must be accepted by the entire Orthodox Church in order for them to be valid.\n\nOne of the decisions made by the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (the second ecumenical council, meeting in 381) and supported by later such councils was that the Patriarch of Constantinople should be given equal honor to the Pope of Rome since Constantinople was considered to be the \"[[New Rome]]\". According to the third Canon of the second ecumenical council: \"Because it is new Rome, the bishop of Constantinople is to enjoy the privileges of honor ''after'' the bishop of Rome.\" This means that both enjoy the same privileges because they are both bishops of the imperial capitals, but the bishop of Rome will precede the bishop of Constantinople since Old Rome precedes New Rome.\n\nThe 28th canon of the fourth ecumenical council clarified this point by stating: \"For the Fathers rightly granted privileges to the throne of Old Rome because it was the royal city. And the One Hundred and Fifty most religious Bishops (i.e. the second ecumenical council in 381) actuated by the same consideration, gave equal privileges to the most holy throne of New Rome, justly judging that the city which is honored with the Sovereignty and the Senate, and enjoys equal privileges with the old imperial Rome, should in ecclesiastical matters also be magnified as she is.\"\n\nBecause of the schism the Eastern Orthodox no longer recognize the primacy of the Pope of Rome. The Patriarch of Constantinople therefore, like the Pope before him, now enjoys the title of \"first among equals\".\n\n===Adherents===\n{{Further|Eastern Orthodoxy by country}}\n[[File:Eastern Orthodoxy by country.png|thumb|upright=2.05|'''Distribution <!-- among who? -->of Eastern Orthodox Christians in the world by country:'''\n{{legend|#000055|More than 75%}}\n{{legend|#0000aa|50\u201375%}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|20\u201350%}}\n{{legend|#5555ff|5\u201320%}}\n{{legend|#aaaaff|1\u20135%}}\n{{legend|#b4c8ff|Below 1%, but has local [[autocephaly]]}}\n]]\n<!---This article and hence this section is about Eastern Orthodoxy.

(philosophy)|hypostases]]''), without overlap or [[Sabellianism|modality]] among them, who share one divine [[essence]] (''ousia'' Greek \u03bf\u1f50\u03c3\u03af\u03b1)\u2014uncreated, immaterial and [[eternity|eternal]].{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=208\u2013211}} These three persons are typically distinguished by their relation to each other. The Father is eternal and not begotten and does not proceed from any, the Son is eternal and begotten of the Father, and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] is eternal and proceeds from the Father. Orthodox doctrine regarding the Holy Trinity is summarised in the [[Nicene Creed#Niceno\u2013Constantinopolitan Creed|Nicene Creed]].{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=202}}\n\nIn discussing God's relationship to His creation, Orthodox theology [[Essence\u2013Energies distinction|distinguishes]] between God's eternal essence, which is totally transcendent, and His ''uncreated energies'', which is how He reaches us. The God who is transcendent and the God who touches us are one and the same. That is, these energies are not something that proceed from God or that God produces, but rather they are God himself: distinct, yet inseparable from, God's inner being.{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=67\u201369}}\n\nIn understanding the Holy Trinity as \"one God in three persons\", \"three persons\" is not to be emphasized more than \"one God\", and vice versa. While the three persons are distinct, they are united in one divine essence, and their oneness is expressed in community and action so completely that they cannot be considered separately. For example, their salvation of mankind is an activity engaged in common: \"Christ became man by the good will of the Father and by the cooperation of the Holy Spirit. Christ sends the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father, and the Holy Spirit forms Christ in our hearts, and thus God the Father is glorified.\" Their \"communion of essence\" is \"indivisible\". Trinitarian terminology\u2014essence, hypostasis, etc.\u2014are used \"philosophically\", \"to answer the ideas of the heretics\", and \"to place the terms where they separate error and truth.\"{{sfn|Hierotheos|1998|pp=128\u2013130}} The words do what they can do, but the nature of the Trinity in its fullness remains beyond man's comprehension and expression, a Holy Mystery that can only be experienced.\n\n===Sin, salvation, and the incarnation===\n[[File:SanGiovanniDamasceno.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[John of Damascus]]]]\n\nAccording to the Eastern Orthodox faith, at some point in the beginnings of human existence, humanity was faced with a choice: to learn the difference between good and evil through observation or through participation. The biblical story of [[Adam and Eve]] relates this choice by mankind to participate in evil, accomplished through disobedience to God's command. Both the intent and the action were separate from God's will; it is that separation that defines and marks any operation as sin. The separation from God caused the loss of (fall from) his grace, a severing of mankind from his creator and the source of his life. The end result was the diminishment of human nature and its subjection to death and corruption, an event commonly referred to as the \"fall of man\".\n\nWhen Orthodox Christians refer to Fallen Nature they are not saying that human nature has become evil in itself. Human nature is still formed in the image of God; we are still God's creation, and God has never created anything evil. But our fallen nature remains open to evil intents and actions. It is sometimes said that we are \"inclined to sin\"; that is, we find some sinful things attractive. It is the nature of temptation to make sinful things seem the more attractive, and it is the fallen nature of humans that seeks or succumbs to the attraction. Orthodox Christians reject the Augustinian position that the descendants of Adam and Eve are actually guilty of the original sin of their ancestors.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Matusiak |first1=Fr. John |title=Original Sin |publisher=Orthodox Church in America |url=http://www.oca.org/QA.asp?ID=3&SID=3 |accessdate=23 May 2014 |ref=none }}</ref> But just as any species begets its own kind, so fallen humans beget fallen humans, and from the beginning of our existence we lie open to sinning by our own choice.\n\nSince the fall of man, then, it has been mankind's dilemma that no human can restore his nature to union with God's grace; it was necessary for God to effect another change in human nature. Orthodox Christians believe that Christ Jesus was both God and Man absolutely and completely, having two natures indivisibly: eternally begotten of the Father in his divinity, he was born in his humanity of a woman, Mary, by her consent, through descent of the Holy Spirit. He lived on earth, in time and history, as a man. As a man he also died, and went to the place of the dead, which is Hades. But being God, neither death nor Hades could contain him, and he rose to life again, in his humanity, by the power of the Holy Spirit, thus destroying the power of Hades and of death itself.{{sfn|Chrysostom|400|loc=[[Paschal Homily]]}} Through God's participation in humanity, Christ's human nature, perfected and unified with his divine nature, ascended into heaven, there to reign in communion with the Father and Holy Spirit.\n\nBy these acts of salvation, Christ provided fallen mankind with the path to escape its fallen nature. The Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that through baptism into Christ's death, and our death unto sin in repentance, with God's help we can also rise with Christ into heaven, healed of the breach of our fallen nature and restored to God's grace. To Orthodox Christians, this process is what is meant by \"salvation,\" which consists of the Christian life. The ultimate goal is [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]] \u2013 an even closer union with God and closer likeness to God than existed in the [[Garden of Eden]]. This process is called [[Divinization (Christian)|Deification]] or \"God became man that man might become 'god'\". However, it must be emphasized that Orthodox Christians do not believe that man becomes God in His essence, or a god in his own nature. More accurately, Christ's salvific work enables man in his human nature to become \"partakers of the Divine nature\" (2 Peter 1:4); that is to say, man is united to God in Christ.\n\nThrough Christ's destruction of Hades' power to hold humanity hostage, he made the path to salvation effective for all the righteous who had died from the beginning of time \u2013 saving many, including Adam and Eve, who are remembered in the Church as saints.{{sfn|St. Athanasius|1982|loc=Ch. 2-3, p=318}}\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox reject the idea that Christ died to give God \"satisfaction\" as taught by [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], or as a punitive substitute as taught by the Reformers. Sin (separation from God, who is the source of all life) is its own punishment, capable of imprisoning the soul in an existence without life, without anything good, and without hope: hell by any measure. Life on earth is God's gift, to give us opportunity to make our choice real: separation or union.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Resurrection of Christ===\n[[File:1678. \u0421\u0430\u0448\u044d\u0441\u0446\u0435 \u045e \u043f\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A 17th-century [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] icon of the Resurrection.]]\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church understands the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus to be real historical events, as described in the gospels of the [[New Testament]]. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was in his humanity (that is, in history) crucified, and died, descending into Hades ([[Sheol]]), the place of the dead, as all humans do. But He, alone among humans, has two natures, one human, one divine, which are indivisible and inseparable from each other through the Mystery of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]]. Hades could not restrain the infinite God. Christ in His divine nature [[Harrowing of Hell|captured the keys of Hades]] and broke the bonds which had imprisoned the human souls who had been held there through their separation from God.\n\nNeither could death contain the Son of God, the Fountain of Life, who arose from death even in his human nature. Not only this, but he opened the gates of Hades to all the righteous dead of past ages, rescuing them from their fallen human nature and restoring them to a nature of grace with God, bringing them back to life, this time in God's heavenly kingdom. And this path he opened to all who choose to follow him in time yet to come, thus saving the human race. Thus the Eastern Orthodox proclaim each year at the time of Pascha (Easter), that Christ \"trampled down death by death, and on those in the tombs bestowed life.\"\n\nThe celebration of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] of Christ at Pascha is the central event in the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical year]] of the Eastern Orthodox Church. According to Orthodox tradition, each human being may partake of this immortality, which would have been impossible without the Resurrection; it is the main promise held out by God in the [[New Testament]]. Every holy day of the Eastern Orthodox [[liturgical]] year relates to the Resurrection directly or indirectly. Every Sunday is especially dedicated to celebrating the Resurrection and the triune God, representing a mini-Pascha. In the liturgical commemorations of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]] during [[Holy Week]] there are frequent allusions to the ultimate victory at its completion.\n\n===Christian life===\nChurch teaching is that Orthodox Christians, through baptism, enter a new life of salvation through repentance whose purpose is to share in the life of God through the work of the Holy Spirit. The Eastern Orthodox Christian life is a spiritual pilgrimage in which each person, through the [[imitation of Christ]] and ''[[hesychasm]]'',{{sfn|Hierotheos|1998|pp=234-237,(241=Glossary)}} cultivates the practice of unceasing prayer. Each life occurs within the life of the Church as a member of the [[body of Christ]].{{sfn|George|2006|p=[http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/theosis-english.pdf 34]}} It is then through the fire of God's love in the action of the Holy Spirit that each member becomes more holy, more wholly unified with Christ, starting in this life and continuing in the next.{{sfn|Oxford Dict Christian Church|3rd ed}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fitzgerald |first1=Fr. Thomas |title=Spirituality |publisher=Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America |year=2014 |url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7114 |accessdate=15 May 2014 |ref=none }}</ref> The Church teaches that everyone, being born in God's image, is called to theosis, fulfillment of the image in likeness to God. God the creator, having divinity by nature, offers each person participation in divinity by cooperatively accepting His gift of grace.{{sfn|George|2006|p=[http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/theosis-english.pdf 21]}}\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church, in understanding itself to be the Body of Christ, and similarly in understanding the Christian life to lead to the unification in Christ of all members of his body, views the church as embracing all Christ's members, those now living on earth, and also all those through the ages who have passed on to the heavenly life. The church includes the Christian saints from all times, and also judges, prophets and righteous Jews of the first covenant, Adam and Eve, even the angels and heavenly hosts.{{sfn|Hierotheos|1998|pp=25\u201330}} In Orthodox services, the earthly members together with the heavenly members worship God as one community in Christ, in a union that transcends time and space and joins heaven to earth. This unity of the Church is sometimes called the ''communion of the saints''.{{sfn|Hierotheos|1998|p=23}}\n\n===Mother of God and saints===\n[[File:Tinos panagia evangelistria 200707 04.jpg|thumb|[[Our Lady of Tinos]] is the major [[Marian shrine]] in [[Greece]]]]\n[[File:Vladimirskaya.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|The [[Theotokos of Vladimir]], one of the most venerated of Orthodox Christian icons of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]].]]\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church believes death and the separation of body and soul to be unnatural\u2014a result of the [[Fall of Man]]. They also hold that the congregation of the Church comprises both the living and the dead. All persons currently in heaven are considered to be [[saint]]s, whether their names are known or not. There are, however, those saints of distinction whom God has revealed as particularly good examples. When a saint is revealed and ultimately recognised by a large portion of the Church a service of official recognition ([[canonization]]) is celebrated.\n\nThis does not 'make' the person a saint; it merely recognizes the fact and announces it to the rest of the Church. A day is prescribed for the saint\u2019s celebration, hymns composed and icons created. Numerous saints are celebrated on each day of the year. They are venerated (shown great respect and love) but not worshiped, for worship is due God alone. In showing the saints this love and requesting their prayers, the Eastern Orthodox manifest their belief that the saints thus assist in the process of salvation for others.\n\nPre-eminent among the saints is the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], the [[Mother of God]]. In Orthodox theology, the Mother of God is the fulfillment of the Old Testament archetypes revealed in the [[Ark of the Covenant]] (because she carried the New Covenant in the person of Christ) and the [[burning bush]] that appeared before [[Moses]] (symbolizing the Mother of God's carrying of God without being consumed<ref>{{cite book|last=Meyendorff|first=Gregory of Nyssa; transl., introduction and notes by Abraham J. Malherbe and Everett Ferguson ; preface by John|title=The life of Moses|year=1978|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0809121120|page=59|url=http://academic.mu.edu/phil/jonesj/courses/P222/p22220062NyssaMoses.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref>). Accordingly, the Eastern Orthodox consider Mary to be the Ark of the New Covenant and give her the respect and reverence as such. The Theotokos was chosen by God and she freely co-operated in that choice to be the Mother of Jesus Christ, the God-man.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox believe that the Christ Child from the moment of conception was both fully God and fully human. Mary is thus called the 'Theotokos' or 'Bogoroditsa' as an affirmation of the divinity of the one to whom she gave birth. It is also believed that her virginity was not compromised in conceiving God-incarnate, that she was not harmed and that she remained forever a virgin. Scriptural references to \"brothers\" of Christ are interpreted as kin, given that the word 'brother' was used in multiple ways, as was the term 'father'. Due to her unique place in salvation history, Mary is honored above all other saints and especially venerated for the great work that God accomplished through her.{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=257-258}}\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church regards the bodies of all saints as holy, made such by participation in the Holy Mysteries, especially the communion of Christ's holy body and blood, and by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit within the Church. Indeed, that persons and physical things can be made holy is a cornerstone of the doctrine of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], made manifest also directly by God in Old Testament times through his dwelling in the Ark of the Covenant. Thus, physical items connected with saints are also regarded as holy, through their participation in the earthly works of those saints. God himself bears witness to this holiness of saints' [[relic]]s through the many miracles connected with them that have been reported throughout history since Biblical times, often including healing from disease and injury.{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=234}}\n\n===Eschatology===\n{{main|Christian eschatology}}\n[[File:Torcello - Santa Maria Assunta.Last Judgement.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''Last Judgment'': 12th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] mosaic from [[Torcello]] Cathedral.]]\n\nOrthodox Christians believe that when a person dies the soul is temporarily separated from the body.

Orthodox do not accept the doctrine of [[Purgatory]], which is held by Catholicism.

Likewise it is often painted on the walls of the Trapeza (refectory) in a monastery where monks may be inspired to sobriety and detachment from worldly things while they eat.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox believe that [[Hell in Christianity|Hell]], though often described in metaphor as punishment inflicted by God, is in reality the soul's rejection of God's infinite love which is offered freely and abundantly to everyone.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox believe that after the Final Judgment:\n* All souls will be reunited with their [[Resurrection of the Dead|resurrected bodies]].\n* All souls will fully experience their spiritual state.\n* Having been perfected, the saints will forever progress towards a deeper and fuller love of God, which equates with eternal happiness.<ref name=soulafterdeath />\n\n===Bible===\nThe official Bible of the Eastern Orthodox Church contains the [[Septuagint]] text of the [[Old Testament]], with the [[Book of Daniel]] given in the translation by [[Theodotion]].

Holy Scripture forms the primary and authoritative written witness of [[Sacred Tradition|Holy Tradition]] and is essential as the basis for all Orthodox teaching and belief.{{sfn|Ware|1991|p=209, (quoting [[John Chrysostom|St. John Chrysostom]]): \"It is impossible for a man to be saved if he does not read the Scriptures.\"}} The Bible provides the only texts held to be suitable for reading in Orthodox worship services. Through the many scriptural quotations embedded in the worship service texts themselves, it is often said that the Eastern Orthodox pray the Bible as well as read it.\n[[File:Paris psaulter gr139 fol5v.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''David glorified by the women of Israel'' from the [[Paris Psalter]], example of the [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)]] (sometimes called the [[Macedonian Renaissance]])]]\n\n[[St. Jerome]] completed the well-known [[Vulgate]] Latin translation only in the early 5th century, around the time the accepted lists of scripture were resolved in the west. The east took up to a century longer to resolve the lists in use there, and ended by accepting a few additional writings from the Septuagint that did not appear in the lists of the west. The differences were small and were not considered to compromise the unity of the faith shared between east and west. They did not play a role in the eventual [[East-West Schism|schism in the 11th century]] that separated the See of Rome and the West from the See of Constantinople and the other apostolic Orthodox Churches, and remained as defined essentially without controversy in the East or West for at least one thousand years. It was only in the 16th century that [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation Protestants]] challenged the lists, proclaiming a [[Biblical canon|canon]] that rejected those Old Testament books that did not appear in the 3rd-century [[Hebrew Bible]]. In response, the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches reaffirmed their accepted scriptural lists in more formal canons of their own.\n\nOnce established as Holy Scripture, there has never been any question that the Eastern Orthodox Church holds the full list of books to be venerable and beneficial for reading and study,<ref>Pomazansky, Michael, Orthodox Dogmatic Theology, pp. 33\u201334</ref> even though it informally holds some books in higher esteem than others, the four gospels highest of all. Of the subgroups significant enough to be named, the \"[[Anagignoskomena]]\" (\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1, \"things that are read\") comprises ten of the Old Testament books rejected in the Protestant canon,<ref>including the [[deuterocanonical books]]</ref> but deemed by the Eastern Orthodox worthy to be read in worship services, even though they carry a lesser esteem than the 39 books of the Hebrew canon.<ref>{{cite book| author = S.

Though it is a psalm, and is in the book of psalms, it is not classified as being within the Psalter (the first 150 psalms),<ref>Orthodox Study Bible, St. Athanasius Academy of Theology, 2008, p778, commentary</ref> and hence does not participate in the various liturgical and prayer uses of the Psalter.\n\nIn a very strict sense, it is not entirely orthodox to call the Holy Scriptures the \"Word of God\". That is a title the Eastern Orthodox Church reserves for Christ, as supported in the scriptures themselves, most explicitly in the first chapter of the gospel of John. God's Word is not hollow, like human words. \"God said, 'let there be light'; and there was light.\"<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:3|NKJV}}</ref> This is the Word which spoke the universe into being, and resonates in creation without diminution throughout all history, a Word of divine power.\n\nAs much as the Eastern Orthodox Church reveres and depends on the scriptures, they cannot compare to the Word of God's manifest action. But the Eastern Orthodox do believe that the Holy Scriptures testify to God's manifest actions in history, and that through its divine inspiration God's Word is manifested both in the scriptures themselves and in the cooperative human participation that composed them. It is in that sense that the Eastern Orthodox refer to the scriptures as \"God's Word\".\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church does not subscribe to the Protestant doctrine of ''[[sola scriptura]]''. The Church has defined what Scripture is; it also interprets what its meaning is.<ref>Ware, Bishop Kallistos (Timothy), [http://orthodoxinfo.com/phronema/ware_howto.aspx ''How to Read the Bible''], retrieved 11 June 2013</ref> Christ promised: \"When He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth\".<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|John|16:13|NKJV}}</ref> The Holy Spirit, then, is the infallible guide for the Church to the interpretation of Scripture. The Church depends upon those saints who, by lives lived in [[imitation of Christ]], achieving [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], can serve as reliable witnesses to the Holy Spirit's guidance. Individual interpretation occurs within the Church and is informed by the Church. It is rational and reasoned, but is not arrived at only by means of deductive reasoning.\n\nScriptures are understood to contain historical fact, poetry, idiom, metaphor, simile, moral fable, parable, prophecy and [[wisdom literature]], and each bears its own consideration in its interpretation. While divinely inspired, the text stills consists of words in human languages, arranged in humanly recognizable forms. The Eastern Orthodox Church does not oppose honest critical and historical study of the Bible.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\">{{harvnb|Ware|1991|pp=210\u2013215}}</ref> In biblical interpretation, it does not use speculations, suggestive theories, or incomplete indications, not going beyond what is fully known.\n\n===Holy tradition and the patristic consensus===\n\"That faith which has been believed everywhere, always, and by all\", the faith taught by Jesus to the apostles, given life by the [[Holy Spirit]] at [[Pentecost]], and passed down to future generations without additions and without subtractions, is known as [[Holy Tradition]].{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=195-196}}<ref>Letter of 1718, in [[George Williams (priest)|George Williams]], ''The Orthodox Church of the East in the 18th Century'', p. 17</ref> Holy Tradition does not change in the Eastern Orthodox Church because it encompasses those things that do not change: the nature of the one God in Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the history of God's interactions with his peoples, the Law as given to the Israelites, all Christ's teaching as given to the disciples and Jews and recorded in scripture, including the parables, the prophecies, the miracles, and His own example to humanity in His extreme humility. It encompasses also the worship of the church, which grew out of the worship of the synagogue and temple and was extended by Christ at the last supper, and the relationship between God and His people which that worship expresses, which is also evidenced between Christ and his disciples. It includes the authority that Christ bestowed on his disciples when he made them apostles,<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|Matthew|16:19|NKJV}}</ref> for the preserving and teaching of the faith, and for governing the organization and conduct of the church (in its administration by bishops).\n\nHoly Tradition is firm, even unyielding, but not rigid or legalistic; instead, it lives and breathes within the Church.<ref>[[Vladimir Lossky]], \"''Tradition is the life of the Holy Spirit in the Church.''\"</ref> For example, the New Testament was entirely written by the early church (mostly the apostles). The whole Bible was accepted as scripture by means of Holy Tradition practiced within the early church. The writing and acceptance took five centuries, by which time the Holy Scriptures themselves had become in their entirety a part of Holy Tradition.{{sfn|Ware|1991|p=205}} But Holy Tradition did not change, because \"that faith which has been believed everywhere, always, and by all\" remained consistent, without additions, and without subtractions. The historical development of the Divine Liturgy and other worship services and devotional practices of the church provide a similar example of extension and growth \"without change\".{{sfn|Ware|1991|p=213}}\n\nThe continuity and stability of Orthodox worship throughout the centuries is one means by which Holy Tradition expresses the unity of the whole church throughout time. Not only can the Eastern Orthodox of today visit a church in a place that speaks a language unknown to the visitors yet have the service remain familiar and understandable to them, but the same would hold true were any able to visit past eras. The church strives to preserve Holy Tradition \"unchanging\" that it may express the one unchanging faith for all time to come as well.\n\nBesides these, Holy Tradition includes the doctrinal definitions and statements of faith of the seven ecumenical councils, including the [[Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed]], and some later local councils, patristic writings, canon law, and icons.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\" /> Not all portions of Holy Tradition are held to be equally strong. Some, the Holy Scriptures foremost, certain aspects of worship, especially in the Divine Liturgy, the doctrines of the ecumenical councils, the [[Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed]], possess a verified authority that endures forever, irrevocably.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\" /> But with local councils and patristic writings, the Church applies a selective judgement. Some councils and writers have occasionally fallen into error, and some contradict each other.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\" />\n\nIn other cases, opinions differ, no consensus is forthcoming, and all are free to choose. With agreement among the Fathers, though, the authority of interpretation grows, and full patristic consensus is very strong. With canon law (which tends to be highly rigorous and very strict, especially with clergy) an unalterable validity also does not apply, since canons deal with living on earth, where conditions are always changing and each case is subject to almost infinite variation from the next.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\" /> Even when and where they were once used with full strictness, their application was not absolute, and was carried out for individuals under the pastoral care of their bishop, who had the authority to decide when individual discipline had been satisfied. This too is a part of the Holy Tradition.\n\nBy tradition, the Eastern Orthodox Church, when faced with issues that are larger than a single bishop can resolve, holds a local council. The bishops and such others as may attend convene (as St. Paul called the Corinthians to do) to seek the ''mind of the church''.<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|1 Cor|1:10|NKJV}}</ref> A council's declarations or edicts then reflect its consensus (if one can be found). An ecumencial council is only called for issues of such import or difficulty or pervasiveness that smaller councils are insufficient to address them. Ecumenical councils' declarations and canons carry binding weight by virtue of their representation across the whole church, by which the mind of the church can be readily seen. However, not all issues are so difficult as to require an ecumenical council to resolve. Some doctrines or decisions, not defined in a formal statement or proclaimed officially, nevertheless are held by the Church unshakably and unanimously without internal disturbance, and these, also reflecting the mind of the church, are just as firmly irrevocable as a formal declaration of an ecumenical council. Lack of formality does not imply lack of authority within Holy Tradition.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\" /> An example of such unanimity can be found in the acceptance in the 5th century of the lists of books that comprise Holy Scripture, a true canon without official stamp.\n\n===Territorial expansion and doctrinal integrity===\nDuring the course of the early church, there were numerous followers who attached themselves to the Christ and His mission here on Earth, as well as followers who retained the distinct duty of being commissioned with preserving the quality of life and lessons revealed through the experience of Jesus living, dying, resurrecting and ascending among them. As a matter of practical distinction and logistics, people of varying gifts were accorded stations within the community structure \u2013 ranging from the host of agape meals (shared with brotherly and fatherly love), to prophecy and the reading of Scripture, to preaching and interpretations and giving aid to the sick and the poor. Sometime after Pentecost the Church grew to a point where it was no longer possible for the Apostles to minister alone. Overseers (bishops)<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|Acts|14:23|NKJV}}</ref> and assistants (deacons and deaconesses)<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|Acts|6:1-6|NKJV}}</ref> were appointed to further the mission of the Church.\n\nThe ecclesia recognised the gathering of these early church communities as being greatest in areas of the known world that were famous for their significance on the world stage \u2013 either as hotbeds of intellectual discourse, high volumes of trade, or proximity to the original sacred sites. These locations were targeted by the early apostles, who recognised the need for humanitarian efforts in these large urban centers and sought to bring as many people as possible into the ecclesia \u2013 such a life was seen as a form of deliverance from the decadent lifestyles promoted throughout the eastern and western Roman empire.\n\nAs the Church increased in size through the centuries, the logistic dynamics of operating such large entities shifted: patriarchs, metropolitans, archimandrites, abbots and abbesses, all rose up to cover certain points of administration.<ref>[http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/walther/deacon.asc Concordia Theological Seminary \u2013 Content Not Found] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403033050/http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/walther/deacon.asc |date=April 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAs a result of heightened exposure and popularity of the philosophical schools (haereseis) of Greco-Roman society and education, Synods and Councils were forced to engage such schools that sought to co-opt the language and pretext of the Christian faith in order to gain power and popularity for their own political and cultural expansion. As a result, ecumenical councils were held to attempt to rebuild solidarity by using the strength of distant orthodox witnesses to dampen the intense local effects of particular philosophical schools within a given area.\n\nWhile originally intended to serve as an internal check and balance for the defense of the doctrine developed and spread by the apostles to the various sees against faulty local doctrine, at times the church found its own bishops and emperors falling prey to local conventions. At these crucial moments in the history of the church, it found itself able to rebuild on the basis of the faith as it was kept and maintained by monastic communities, who subsisted without reliance on the community of the state or popular culture and were generally unaffected by the materialism and rhetoric that often dominated and threatened the integrity and stability of the urban churches.\n\nIn this sense, the aim of the councils was not to expand or fuel a popular need for a clearer or relevant picture of the original apostolic teaching. Rather, the theologians spoke to address the issues of external schools of thought who wished to distort the simplicity and neutrality of the apostolic teaching for personal or political gain. The consistency of the Eastern Orthodox faith is entirely dependent on the Holy Tradition of the accepted corpus of belief \u2013 the decisions ratified by the fathers of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|seven ecumenical councils]], and this is only done at the beginning of a consecutive council so that the effects of the decisions of the prior council can be audited and verified as being both conceptually sound and pragmatically feasible and beneficial for the church as a whole.\n\n==Worship==\n{{Main|Byzantine Rite|Eastern Orthodox worship|Western Rite Orthodoxy}}\n[[File:Meister der Sophien-Kathedrale von Ohrid 001.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Fresco]] of [[Basil the Great]] in the [[cathedral]] of [[Ohrid]].

The fixed annual cycle begins on 1 September and establishes the times for all annual observances that are fixed by date, such as Christmas. The annual Paschal cycle is established relative to the varying date of Pascha each year and affects the times for such observances as [[Easter|Pascha]] itself, [[Great Lent]], [[Holy Week]], and the feasts of [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension]] and [[Pentecost]].\n\nLesser cycles also run in tandem with the annual ones. A weekly cycle of days prescribes a specific focus for each day in addition to others that may be observed.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Five Cycles |work=Orthodox Worship |publisher=The Diocese of Eastern Pennsylvania, Orthodox Church in America |url=http://doepa.org/about_orthodoxy.html |accessdate=24 June 2015 }}</ref>{{quote|text=Each day of the Weekly Cycle is dedicated to certain special memorials.

Parts of each service remain fixed, while others change depending on the observances prescribed for the specific day in the various cycles, ever providing a flow of constancy within variation. Services are conducted in the church and involve both the clergy and faithful. Services cannot properly be conducted by a single person, but must have at least one other person present (i.e. a Priest cannot celebrate alone, but must have at least a Chanter present and participating).\n\nUsually, all of the services are conducted on a daily basis only in monasteries and cathedrals, while parish churches might only do the services on the weekend and major feast days. On certain [[Great Feasts]] (and, according to some traditions, every Sunday) a special [[All-Night Vigil]] (''Agrypnia'') will be celebrated from late at night on the eve of the feast until early the next morning. Because of its festal nature it is usually followed by a breakfast feast shared together by the congregation.\n\n{{quote|The journey is to the Kingdom.

[[Basil the Great]] (left) and [[John Chrysostom]], ascribed authors of the two most frequently used [[Eastern Orthodox]] Divine Liturgies, c. 1150 ([[mosaic]] in the [[Cappella Palatina|Palatine Chapel]], [[Palermo]]).]]\n\nServices, especially the [[Divine Liturgy]], may only be celebrated once a day on a single altar (some churches have multiple altars in order to accommodate large congregations). Each priest may only celebrate the Divine Liturgy once a day.\n\nFrom its Jewish roots, the liturgical day begins at sundown. The traditional daily cycle of services is as follows:\n* [[Vespers]] \u2013 (Greek ''Hesperinos'') Sundown, the beginning of the liturgical day.\n* [[Compline]] (Greek ''Apodeipnon'', lit. \"After-supper\") \u2013 After the evening meal, and before sleeping.\n* [[Midnight Office]] \u2013 Usually served only in monasteries.\n* [[Matins]] (Greek ''Orthros'') \u2013 First service of the morning. Prescribed to start before sunrise.\n* [[Canonical Hours|Hours]] \u2013 First, Third, Sixth, and Ninth \u2013 Sung either at their appropriate times, or in aggregate at other customary times of convenience. If the latter, The First Hour is sung immediately following Orthros, the Third and Sixth before the Divine Liturgy, and the Ninth before Vespers.\n* [[Divine Liturgy]] \u2013 The [[Eucharist]] service. (Called [[Holy Mass]] in the Western Rite)\nThe Divine Liturgy is the celebration of the Eucharist. Although it is usually celebrated between the Sixth and Ninth Hours, it is not considered to be part of the daily cycle of services, as it occurs outside the normal time of the world. The Divine Liturgy is not celebrated on weekdays during [[Great Lent]], and in some places during the lesser fasting seasons either; however, reserve communion is prepared on Sundays and is distributed during the week at the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]].\n\nOther items brought to the altar during the Divine Liturgy include a gold or silver chalice with red wine, a small metallic urn of warm water, a metallic communion spoon, a little metallic spear, a sponge, a metal disk with cut pieces of bread upon it, and a star, which is a star-shaped piece of metal over which the priest places a cloth covering when transporting the holy gifts to and from the altar. Also found on the altar table is the [[Antimension|antimins]]. The antimins is a silk cloth, signed by the appropriate diocesan bishop, upon which the sanctification of the holy gifts takes place during each Divine Liturgy. The antimins contain the relics of a saint. When a church is consecrated by a bishop, there is a formal service or prayers and sanctification in the name of the Saint that the church is named after. The bishop will also often present a small relic of a saint to place in or on the altar as part of the consecration of a new church.\n\nThe book containing liturgically read portions of the four gospels is permanently \"enthroned\" on the altar table. The Eastern Orthodox bishops, priests, deacons and readers sing/chant specific verses from this Gospel Book on each different day of the year.\n\nThis daily cycle services is conceived of as both the sanctification of time (''[[chronos]]'', the specific times during which they are celebrated), and entry into eternity (''[[kairos]]''). They consist to a large degree of litanies asking for God's mercy on the living and the dead, readings from the [[Psalms|Psalter]] with introductory prayers, [[troparion|troparia]], and other prayers and hymns surrounding them. The Psalms are so arranged that when all the services are celebrated the entire [[Psalter]] is read through in their course once a week, and twice a week during [[Great Lent]] when the services are celebrated in an extended form.\n\n====Music and chanting====\n[[File:Patriarchate Constantinopolis.jpg|thumb|Chanters singing on the [[kliros]] at the [[Church of St. George, Istanbul|Church of St. George]], [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]].]]\n\nOrthodox services are sung nearly in their entirety. Services consist in part of a dialogue between the clergy and the people (often represented by the choir or the Psaltis [[Cantor (church)|Cantor]]). In each case the prayers are sung or chanted following a prescribed musical form. Almost nothing is read in a normal speaking voice, with the exception of the [[homily]] if one is given.\n\nBecause the human voice is seen as the most perfect instrument of praise, musical instruments ([[organ (music)|organs]], guitars, etc.) are not generally used to accompany the choir.\n\nThe church has developed eight modes or tones (see [[Octoechos]]) within which a chant may be set, depending on the time of year, feast day, or other considerations of the [[Typikon]]. There are numerous versions and styles that are traditional and acceptable and these vary a great deal between cultures.{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=238}} It is common, especially in the United States, for a choir to learn many different styles and to mix them, singing one response in Greek, then English, then Russian, etc.\n\nIn the Russian tradition there have been some famous composers of \"unaccompanied\" church music, such as [[Tchaikovsky]] ([[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Tchaikovsky)|Liturgy of St John Chrysostom]], op. 41, 1878, and [[All-Night Vigil (Tchaikovsky)|All-Night Vigil]], op. 52, 1882) and [[Rachmaninoff]] ([[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Rachmaninoff)|Liturgy of St John Chrysostom]], op. 31, 1910, and [[All-Night Vigil (Rachmaninoff)|All-Night Vigil]], op. 37, 1915); and many church tones can likewise be heard influencing their music.\n\n====Incense====\n[[File:\u0415\u0432\u0445\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Russian Orthodox [[deacon]] and [[priest]]]]\nAs part of the legacy handed down from its Judaic roots, [[incense]] is used during all services in the Eastern Orthodox Church as an offering of worship to God as it was done in the Jewish First and Second Temples in Jerusalem (Exodus chapter 30). Incense is also prophesied in the book of {{bibleverse || Malachi|1:11|KJV}} as a \"pure offering\" in the glorification of God by the Gentiles in \"every place\" where the name of God is regarded as \"great\". Traditionally, the base of the incense used is the resin of [[Boswellia sacra]], also known as frankincense, but the resin of fir trees has been used as well. It is usually mixed with various floral essential oils giving it a sweet smell.\n\nIncense represents the sweetness of the prayers of the saints rising up to God ({{bibleverse || Psalm|141:2|KJV}}, {{bibleverse || Revelation|5:8|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb || Revelation|8:4|KJV}}). The incense is burned in an ornate golden censer that hangs at the end of three chains representing the Trinity. Two chains represent the human and Godly nature of the Son, one chain for the Father and one chain for the Holy Spirit. The lower cup represents the earth and the upper cup the heaven. In the Greek, Slavic, and Syrian traditions there are 12 bells hung along these chains representing the 12 apostles. There are also 72 links representing 72 evangelists.\n\nThe charcoal represents the sinners. Fire signifies the Holy Spirit and frankincense the good deeds. The incense also represents the grace of the Holy Trinity. The censer is used (swung back and forth) by the priest/deacon to venerate all four sides of the altar, the holy gifts, the clergy, the icons, the congregation, and the church structure itself. Incense is also used in the home where the individual will go around the house and \"cross\" all of the icons saying in Greek: \u1f0d\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f0d\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f30\u03c3\u03c7\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f0d\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \u1f10\u03bb\u03ad\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd \u1f21\u03bc\u1fb6\u03c2, or in English: Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us.\n\n===Fasting===\n{{See also|Fasting#Orthodoxy & Eastern Catholicism|l1=Fasting: Orthodoxy & Eastern Catholicism}}\n\n[[File:Cross being thrown at Theophany.jpg|thumb|Blessing of the waters and throwing cross; [[Theophany]]]]\n\nThe number of fast days varies from year to year, but in general the Eastern Orthodox Christian can expect to spend a little over half the year [[fasting]] at some level of strictness. There are spiritual, symbolic, and even practical reasons for fasting. In the [[Fall of man|Fall from Paradise]] mankind became possessed by a carnal nature; that is to say, became inclined towards the [[Passion (Christianity)|passions]]. Through fasting, Orthodox Christians attempt to return to the relationship of love and obedience to God enjoyed by Adam and Eve in [[Paradise]] in their own lives, by refraining from carnal practices, by bridling the tongue ({{bibleverse || James|3:5\u20136|KJV}}), confession of sins, prayer and almsgiving.\n\nFasting is seen as purification and the regaining of innocence. It is a practice of learning to temper the body's primary desire for food. By learning to temper this basic desire of the body, the practitioner can more readily temper other worldly desires, and thus, become better enabled to draw closer to [[Christian God|God]] in the hope of becoming more [[Deification#In Eastern Christianity|Christ-like]]. Through obedience to the Church and its ascetic practices the Eastern Orthodox Christian seeks to rid himself or herself of the ''passions'' (The desires of our fallen carnal nature). All Orthodox Christians are provided with a prescribed set of guidelines. They do not view fasting as a hardship, but rather as a privilege and joy. The teaching of the Church provides both the time and the amount of fasting that is expected as a minimum for every member who chooses to participate. For greater ascesis, some may choose to go without food entirely for a short period of time. A complete three-day fast at the beginning and end of a fasting period is not unusual, and some fast for even longer periods, though this is usually practiced only in monasteries.\n\nIn general, fasting means abstaining from meat and meat products, dairy (eggs and cheese) and dairy products, fish, olive oil, and wine. Wine and oil\u2014and, less frequently, fish\u2014are allowed on certain feast days when they happen to fall on a day of fasting; but animal products and dairy are forbidden on fast days, with the exception of \"Cheese Fare\" week which precedes Great Lent, during which dairy products are allowed. Wine and oil are usually also allowed on Saturdays and Sundays during periods of fast. In some Orthodox traditions, caviar is permitted on [[Lazarus Saturday]], the Saturday before Palm Sunday, although the day is otherwise a fast day. Married couples also abstain from sexual activity on fast days so that they may devote themselves fulsomely to prayer ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7:5|KJV}}).\n\nWhile it may seem that fasting in the manner set forth by the Church is a strict rule, there are circumstances where a person's spiritual guide may allow an [[Economy (Eastern Christianity)|Economy]] because of some physical necessity (e.g. those who are pregnant or infirm, the very young and the elderly, or those who have no control over their diet, such as prisoners or soldiers).\n\nThe time and type of fast is generally uniform for all Orthodox Christians; the times of fasting are part of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|ecclesiastical calendar]], and the method of fasting is set by the [[Canon law|Holy Canons]] and [[Sacred Tradition]]. There are four major fasting periods during the year:\n* The [[Nativity Fast]] (Advent or \"Winter Lent\") which is the 40 days preceding the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity of Christ]] (Christmas), beginning on 15 November and running through 24 December.\n* [[Great Lent]] which consists of the 6 weeks (40 Days) preceding [[Palm Sunday]], and [[Holy Week|Great Week]] which precedes [[Easter]].\n* The [[Apostles' Fast]] which varies in length from 8 days to 6 weeks. It begins on the Monday following [[All Saints' Day|All Saints Sunday]] and extends to the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]] on 29 June.\n* The [[Dormition Fast]], a two-week-long Fast preceding the ''[[Dormition of the Theotokos]]'', lasting from 1 August through 15 August.\n\nIn addition to these fasting seasons, Orthodox Christians fast on every Wednesday (in commemoration of Christ's betrayal by [[Judas Iscariot]]), and Friday (in commemoration of Christ's [[Crucifixion]]) throughout the year. Monastics often fast on Mondays (in imitation of the [[Angels]], who are commemorated on that day in the weekly cycle, since monastics are striving to lead an angelic life on earth, and angels neither eat nor drink).\n\nOrthodox Christians who are preparing to receive the [[Eucharist]] do not eat or drink at all from vespers (sunset) until after taking [[Holy Communion]]. A similar total fast is expected to be kept on the [[Christmas Eve|Eve of Nativity]], the Eve of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Theophany]] (Epiphany), [[Good Friday|Great Friday]] and [[Holy Saturday]] for those who can do so. There are other individual days observed as fasts (though not as days of total fasting) no matter what day of the week they fall on, such as the [[Beheading of St. John the Baptist]] on 29 August and the [[Feast of the Cross#September 14|Exaltation of the Holy Cross]] on 14 September.\n\n===Almsgiving===\n\"[[Almsgiving]]\", more comprehensively described as \"acts of mercy\", refers to any giving of oneself in charity to someone who has a need, such as material resources, work, assistance, counsel, support, or kindness. Along with ''prayer'' and ''fasting'', it is considered a pillar of the personal spiritual practices of the Eastern Orthodox Christian tradition. Almsgiving is particularly important during periods of fasting, when the Eastern Orthodox believer is expected to share with those in need the monetary savings from his or her decreased consumption. As with fasting, mentioning to others one's own virtuous deeds tends to reflect a sinful pride, and may also be considered extremely rude.\n\n==Traditions==\n===Monasticism===\n{{Main|Degrees of Orthodox monasticism}}\n[[File:Katharinenkloster Sinai BW 2.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] (6th century), [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Egypt]]]]\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church places heavy emphasis and awards a high level of prestige to traditions of monasticism and asceticism with roots in [[Early Christianity]] in the [[Near East]] and Byzantine [[Anatolia]]. The most important centres of Christian Orthodox monasticism are [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] ([[Egypt]]) and [[Mount Athos]] in [[Northern Greece]].\n\nAll Orthodox Christians are expected to participate in at least some ascetic works, in response to the [[Law of Christ|commandment of Christ]] to \"come, take up the cross, and follow me.\" ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 10:21 and elsewhere) They are therefore all called to imitate, in one way or another, Christ himself who denied himself to the extent of literally taking up the cross on the way to his voluntary self-sacrifice. However, laypeople are not expected to live in extreme [[asceticism]] since this is close to impossible while undertaking the normal responsibilities of worldly life.\n\nThose who wish to do this therefore separate themselves from the world and live as [[monasticism|monastics]]: monks and nuns. As ascetics ''par excellence'', using the allegorical weapons of prayer and fasting in spiritual warfare against their passions, monastics hold a very special and important place in the Church. This kind of life is often seen as incompatible with any kind of worldly activity including that which is normally regarded as virtuous. Social work, school teaching, and other such work is therefore usually left to laypeople. Ascetics of the Eastern Orthodox Church are recognised by their long hair, and in case of male monks, long beards.\n\n[[File:megaloschema.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.55|Schema worn by monks]]\n\nThere are three main types of monastics. Those who live in monasteries under a common rule are ''coenobitic''. Each monastery may formulate its own rule, and although there are no [[religious order]]s in Orthodoxy some respected monastic centers such as [[Mount Athos]] are highly influential. ''Eremitic'' monks, or [[hermit]]s, are those who live solitary lives. It is the yearning of many who enter the monastic life to eventually become solitary hermits. This most austere life is only granted to the most advanced monastics and only when their superiors feel they are ready for it.\n\nHermits are usually associated with a larger monastery but live in seclusion some distance from the main compound. Their local monastery will see to their physical needs, supplying them with simple foods while disturbing them as little as possible. In between are those in ''semi-eremitic'' communities, or ''sketes'', where one or two monks share each of a group of nearby dwellings under their own rules and only gather together in the central chapel, or ''katholikon'', for liturgical observances.\n\nThe spiritual insight gained from their ascetic struggles make monastics preferred for missionary activity. Bishops are almost always chosen from among monks, and those who are not generally receive the monastic tonsure before their consecrations.\n\nMany (but not all) Orthodox [[seminary|seminaries]] are attached to monasteries, combining academic preparation for [[Holy Orders|ordination]] with participation in the community's life of prayer. Monks who have been ordained to the priesthood are called ''hieromonk'' (priest-monk); monks who have been ordained to the diaconate are called ''hierodeacon'' (deacon-monk). Not all monks live in monasteries, some hieromonks serve as priests in parish churches thus practicing \"monasticism in the world\".\n\nCultural practices differ slightly, but in general ''Father'' is the correct form of address for monks who have been tonsured, while Novices are addressed as ''Brother''. Similarly, ''Mother'' is the correct form of address for nuns who have been tonsured, while Novices are addressed as ''Sister''. Nuns live identical ascetic lives to their male counterparts and are therefore also called ''monachoi'' (monastics) or the feminine plural form in Greek, ''monachai'', and their common living space is called a monastery.\n\n=== Icons and symbols ===\n{{See also|Christian symbolism}}\n[[File:Rom, Calixtus-Katakomben, Steintafel mit Christussymbol \"Chi Rho\".jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|The \"[[Chi-Rho]]\" symbol, [[Catacomb of Callixtus|Catacombs of San Callisto]], [[Rome]]]]\n[[File:Chrisme Constantinople.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|\"IX\" (Jesus Christ) monogram from a 4th-century [[sarcophagus]] from [[Constantinople]]]]\n[[File:Easter friday in Greek Orthodox church.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Easter eggs in front of altar, symbol of Resurrection.]]\n\nEverything in the Eastern Orthodox Church has a purpose and a meaning revealing God's revelation to man. At the front, or eastern end of the church, is a raised dais with an icon-covered screen or wall ([[iconostasis]] or [[templon]]) separating the nave from the sanctuary. In the center of this wall is the entrance to the altar known as the \"Royal Doors\" through which only the clergy may pass.\n\nThere is a right and left side door on the front of the iconostasis, one depicting the archangel, Michael and the other Gabriel. The priest and altar boys enter and exit through these doors during appropriate parts of the Divine Liturgy. Immediately to the right of the main gate you will always find an icon of Jesus Christ, on the left, an icon of the [[Theotokos]] (Mother of God). Other icons depicted on the iconostasis are Saint John the Forerunner and the Saint after which the church is named.\n\nIn front of the iconostasis is the bishop's chair, a place of honor where a visiting bishop or metropolitan will often sit when visiting the church. An Orthodox priest, when standing at the altar during the Divine Liturgy, faces toward the altar (typically facing east) and properly leads his congregation while together they perform the mystical sacrifice and pray to God.\n\nThe sanctuary contains the Holy Altar, representing the place where Orthodox Christians believe that Christ was born of the virgin Mary, crucified under Pontius Pilate, laid in the tomb, descended into hell, rose from the dead on the third day, ascended into heaven, and will return again at his second coming. A free-standing cross, bearing the body of Christ, may stand behind the altar. On the altar are a cloth covering, a large book containing the gospel readings performed during services, an ark containing presanctified divine gifts (bread and wine) distributed by the deacon or priest to those who cannot come to the church to receive them, and several white beeswax candles.\n\n====Icons====\n{{Main|Icon}}\nThe term 'icon' comes from the Greek word ''eikon'', which simply means image. The Eastern Orthodox believe that the first icons of Christ and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|the Virgin Mary]] were painted by [[Luke the Evangelist]]. Icons are filled with symbolism designed to convey information about the person or event depicted. For this reason, icons tend to be formulaic, following a prescribed methodology for how a particular person should be depicted, including hair style, body position, clothing, and background details.\n\nIcon painting, in general, is not an opportunity for artistic expression, though each iconographer brings a vision to the piece. It is far more common for an icon to be copied from an older model, though with the recognition of a new saint in the church, a new icon must be created and approved. The personal and creative traditions of [[Catholic Church art|Catholic religious art]] were largely lacking in Orthodox icon painting before the 17th century, when Russian icons began to be strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from both Protestant and Catholic Europe. Greek icons also began to take on a strong western influence for a period and the difference between some Orthodox icons and western religious art began to vanish. More recently there has been a trend of returning to the more traditional and symbolic representations.\n\n[[File:Fedorovskaya3.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|[[Our Lady of St. Theodore]] (12th century), the protector of [[Kostroma]] and patron icon of the [[Romanov]] family, following the Byzantine \"Tender Mercy\" type.]]\n[[File:ConstantinoXI.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Modern icon depicting [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]], last emperor of the Roman (Byzantine) empire]]\n\nAspects of the [[iconography]] borrow from the pre-Christian [[Roman art|Roman]] and [[Hellenistic art]].  [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]] wrote, \"In this instinct there was a measure of truth. The representations of Christ as the Almighty Lord on his judgment throne owed something to pictures of Zeus. Portraits of the Mother of God were not wholly independent of a pagan past of venerated mother-goddesses. In the popular mind the saints had come to fill a role that had been played by heroes and deities.\"<ref>Henry Chadwick, The Early Church, 283.</ref>\n\nLarge free-standing statues (three-dimensional depictions) are almost non-existent in the Eastern Orthodox Church. This is partly because [[cult image]]s of the Greek gods were a focus of the [[ancient Greek religion]] and its Roman equivalent, and much criticised by Early Christian writers, and partly because icons are meant to show the spiritual nature of man, not the sensual earthly body. [[Relief]]s, however, were used in [[Byzantine art]].\n\nIcons are not considered by the Eastern Orthodox to be idols or objects of worship. The parameters of their usage were clearly spelled out by the [[Second Council of Nicaea|7th ecumenical council]]. Justification for their usage utilises the following logic: before God took human form in Christ, no material depiction was possible and therefore blasphemous even to contemplate. Once God became incarnate, depiction was possible.\n\nAs Christ is believed to be God, it is justified to hold in one's mind the image of God-incarnate. Likewise, when one venerates an icon, it is not the wood or paint that are venerated but rather the individual shown, just as it is not the paper one loves when one might kiss the photograph of a loved one. As [[Saint Basil]] famously proclaimed, honour or veneration of the icon always passes to its archetype. Following this reasoning, the veneration of the glorified human saint made in God's image, is always a veneration of the divine image, and hence God as foundational archetype.\n\nIcons can be found adorning the walls of churches and often cover the inside structure completely.{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=271}} Most Orthodox homes have an area set aside for family prayer, usually an eastern facing wall, where are hung many icons. Icons have been part of Orthodox Christianity since the beginning of the church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/things/icons.htm |title=Icons \u2013 Orthodox Christianity \u2013 Religion Facts |publisher= |accessdate=5 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322064748/http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/things/icons.htm |archivedate=March 22, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIcons are often illuminated by a candle or oil lamp. (Beeswax for candles and olive oil for lamps are preferred because they are natural and burn cleanly.) Besides the practical purpose of making icons visible in an otherwise dark church, both candles and oil lamps symbolise the Light of the World, who is Christ.\n\nTales of miraculous icons are not uncommon, though it has always been considered that the message of such an event was for the immediate faithful involved and therefore does not usually attract crowds. Some miraculous icons whose reputations span long periods of time nevertheless become objects of pilgrimage along with the places where they are kept. As several Orthodox theologians and saints have explored in the past, the icon's miraculous nature is found not in the material, but in the glory of the saint who is depicted. The icon is a window, in the words of [[Pavel Florensky|Paul Florensky]], that actually participates in the glory of what it represents.\n\n====Iconostasis====\n{{Main|Iconostasis}}\n[[File:Main iconostasis of Annunciation Cathedral in Moscow 01 by shakko.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Iconostasis]] in the Cathedral of the Annunciation in the [[Moscow Kremlin]].]]\n\nAn ''iconostasis'', also called the ''templon'', is a wall of [[icons]] and religious paintings, separating the [[nave]] from the [[sanctuary]] in a [[church (building)|church]]. ''Iconostasis'' also refers to a portable icon stand that can be placed anywhere within a church. The modern iconostasis evolved from the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] [[templon]] in the 11th century. The evolution of the iconostasis probably owes a great deal to 14th-century [[Hesychasm|Hesychast]] [[mysticism]] and the wood-carving genius of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n\nThe first ceiling-high, five-leveled Russian iconostasis was designed by [[Andrey Rublyov]] in the [[cathedral of the Dormition]] in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] in 1408. The separation between sanctuary and nave accomplished by the iconostasis is not mandatory, though it is common practice. Depending on circumstance, the role of the iconostasis can be played by masonry, carved panels, screens, curtains, railings, a cord or rope, plain icons on stands, steps, or nothing at all.\n\n====Cross====\n[[File:OrthodoxCross.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.4|A three-bar cross.]]\n\nDepictions of the [[Christian cross|cross]] within the Eastern Orthodox Church are numerous and often highly ornamented, but its use does not extend to all Orthodox traditions.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Some carry special significance.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The Tri-Bar Cross, popular in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, but common throughout the Eastern Orthodox world, seen to the left, has three bars. Its origins are in the early Byzantine Church of the 4th century AD.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe small top crossbar represents the sign that [[Pontius Pilate]] nailed above Christ's head. It often is inscribed with an acronym, \"INRI\", Latin, meaning \"[[INRI|Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews]]\" or \"INBI\", Greek, \"[[INBI|Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews]]\"; however, it is often replaced or amplified by the phrase \"The King of Glory\" in order to answer Pilate's statement with Christ's affirmation, \"My Kingdom is not of this world\".{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThere is also a bottom slanting bar which has several explanations. Claims of evidence indicate that there was a small wooden platform for the crucified to stand on in order to support his weight; in Jesus' case his feet were nailed side by side to this platform with one nail each in order to prolong the torture of the cross.\n\nImplied evidence for this comes mainly from two sources, namely, the Bible (in order to cause the victim to die faster, his legs were broken so they could not support his weight and he would suffocate){{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and iconography (all early depictions of the crucifixion show this arrangement, not the later with feet on top with single nail).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} It has also been pointed out by some experts that the nailed hands of a body crucified in the manner often shown in modern secular art would not support the weight of the body and would tear through. A platform for the feet would relieve this problem.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThat the bottom bar is slanted has two explanations, to represent the very real agony which Christ experienced on the cross (a refutation of [[Docetism]]){{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and to signify that the thief on Christ's right chose the right path while the thief on the left did not.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nOther crosses associated with the Eastern Orthodox Church are the more traditional single-bar crosses, budded designs, the [[Greek cross]], the [[Latin cross]], the [[Jerusalem cross]] (cross patt\u00e9e), [[Celtic cross]]es, and others.<ref>A good explanation of the 3-bar cross was written by Orthodox symbologist Dr Alexander Roman and can be found at http://www.ukrainian-orthodoxy.org/questions/2010/threeBarCross.php</ref> A common symbolism of the slanted foot stool is The foot-rest points up, toward Heaven, on Christ\u2019s right hand-side, and downward, to Hades, on Christ\u2019s left. \"Between two thieves Thy Cross did prove to be a balance of\nrighteousness: wherefore one of them was dragged down to Hades by the\nweight of his blasphemy ''[the balance points downward],'' whereas the other was lightened of his transgressions unto the comprehension of theology ''[the balance points upward].''

The inscription Jesus Christ in Greek: IC (Iesous) on the left side bar and XC (Xhristos) on the right side bar, with a sun on the top of the cross. There is also typically an inscription on the back in [[Church Slavonic]]: \"\u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\", \"''Spasi i Sokhrani''\", \"''Save and Protect''\". This cross is known as the Saint Olga Cross.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gallerybyzantium.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=9_25&products_id=205 | title=St. Olga Cross (10kt Gold) (Large) (High Quality Gauge)}}</ref>\n\n===Art and architecture===\n{{Main|Eastern Orthodox church architecture}}\n[[File:Orthodox-Church-interior.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|An illustration of the traditional interior of an Orthodox church.]]\nThe church building has many symbolic meanings; perhaps the oldest and most prominent is the concept that the Church is the Ark (as in [[Noah's Ark|Noah]]'s) in which the world is saved from the flood of temptations; therefore, most Orthodox Churches are rectangular in design. Another popular configuration, especially for churches with large choirs is [[cruciform]] or cross-shaped or what is called the \"Greek-cross.\"\n\nArchitectural patterns vary in shape and complexity, with chapels sometimes added around the main church, or triple altars; but in general, the symbolic layout of the church remains the same. Each church is created with specified qualifications based on what the apostles said in the Bible.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} These qualifications include how big the temple should be.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n[[File:\u0395\u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03b7\u03bd\u03ac 3604 hdr.jpg|thumb|Interior of [[Agios Minas Cathedral]], [[Heraklion]]]]\nThe Church building is divided into three main parts: the [[narthex]] ([[Vestibule (Architecture)|vestibule]]), the [[nave]] and the [[sanctuary]] (also called the ''altar'' or ''holy place''). The narthex is where catechumens and non-Orthodox visitors were traditionally asked to stand during services. It is separated from the nave by \"The Royal Gate\". On each side of this gate are candle stands (menalia) representing the pillars of fire that went before the [[Hebrews|Hebrew people]] escaping from Egypt.\n\nThe nave is where most of the congregation stand during services. Traditionally, men stand on the right and women on the left. This is for a number of reasons: (1) Considering the family unit of past centuries the husband was dominant; thus, standing the same distance from the altar, equality is emphasised. (2) The idea of separating the sexes was inherited from the Jewish tradition of doing so within synagogues (3) Separation of sexes also followed the practice of choirs in which different levels of voice are placed in groups to facilitate harmony.\n\nIn general, men and women dress respectfully, typically wearing their \"Sunday best\" to enter the church. Often, women cover their heads as prescribed by Paul (1 Cor. 11:13). Children are considered full members of the Church and stand attentively and quietly during services. There is often a choir area at the side or in a loft in back. In addition to the Choir, a Chanter is always present at the front of the church to chant responses and hymns that are part of the Divine Liturgy offered by the Priest. There is usually a dome in the ceiling with an icon of Christ depicted as [[Christ Pantocrator|Ruler of the Universe]] (Pantocrator).\n\nThe [[Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity]] on New York City's [[Upper East Side]] is the largest [[Orthodox Christian]] church in the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_F5yntZocGIC&pg=PA147&dq=%22holy+trinity%22+cathedral+greek++74#v=onepage&q=%22holy%20trinity%22%20cathedral%20greek%20%2074&f=false |title=The Orthodox Church: Student Edition |author=Thomas E. FitzGerald |publisher= |accessdate=5 January 2013|isbn=9780275964382 |year=1998 }}</ref>\n\nApart from the icons, the Eastern Orthodox churches and monasteries are often decorated with [[fresco]]s and [[mosaic]]s.\n\n===Local customs===\n[[File:Broken vases on Holy Saturday in Corfu.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Shards of pottery vases on the street, after being thrown from the windows of nearby houses. A [[Holy Saturday]] tradition in [[Corfu]].]]\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church also has many associated traditions (sometimes referred to simply as customs), compatible with its life and function, but not necessarily tied so closely to the faith itself. These are not generally regarded as a part of Holy Tradition, though no strict dividing line is drawn. As long as compatibility is maintained, general practice often tends to the permissive rather than the restrictive, with the local priest or bishop resolving questions.\n\nMany of these customs are local or cultural, and some are not even especially religious, but form a part of the church's relationship with the people in the time and place where it exists. Where outside customs affect church practices such as worship, a closer watch is kept for guarding the integrity of worship, but suitable local differences are welcomed and celebrated joyfully. The local church customs, especially liturgical ones, are referred to as differences in [[typica]] (Style).\n\nLocality is also expressed in regional terms of churchly jurisdiction, which is often also drawn along national lines. Many Orthodox churches adopt a national title (e.g. [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania|Albanian Orthodox]], [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian Orthodox]], [[Antiochian Orthodox Church|Antiochian Orthodox]], [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian Orthodox]], [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]], [[Montenegrin Orthodox Church|Montenegrin Orthodox]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]], [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]], [[Ukrainian Orthodox]], etc.) and this title can identify which language is used in services, which bishops preside, and which of the typica is followed by specific [[wikt:congregation|congregations]]. In the Middle East, Orthodox Christians are usually referred to as ''Rum'' (\"Roman\") Orthodox, because of their historical connection with the [[Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]].{{sfn|Binns|2002|p=3}}\n\nDifferences in ''[[Praxis (Eastern Orthodoxy)|praxis]]'' (\"practice\") tend to be slight, involving things such as the order in which a particular set of hymns are sung or what time a particular service is celebrated. But observances of the saints' days of local saints are more often celebrated in special services within a locality, as are certain national holidays, like Greek Independence Day. In North America, observances of Thanksgiving Day are increasing.\n\nMembers of the Church are fully united in faith and the [[Sacred Mysteries]] with all Orthodox congregations, regardless of nationality or location. In general, Orthodox Christians could travel the globe and feel familiar with the services even if they did not know the language being used.\n\nIn the [[Levant]], Christian Orthodox services and identity often combine both the Byzantine Greek and indigenous (Arabic and [[Aramaic]]) traditions. Other Orthodox communities can identify with two Eastern Orthodox churches simultaneously, for example [[Caucasus Greeks]] and [[Pontic Greeks]] in [[Greeks in Russia|Russia]] often identify with both the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and [[Russian Orthodox Church]], as a result of centuries of assimilation and intermarriage with ethnic Russians and other Christian Orthodox communities in mainly southern [[Russia]].\n\n==Holy mysteries (sacraments)==\nAccording to Orthodox theology, the purpose of the Christian life is to attain ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'', the mystical union of mankind with God. This union is understood as both collective and individual. St. [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] wrote concerning the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] that, \"He (Jesus) was made man that we might be made god (\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03b8\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd).\"<ref>Athanasius of Alexandria, ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.i.html On the Incarnation of the Word]'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html \u00a7&nbsp;54].  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QWCtlc7G?url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html |date=July 22, 2007 }}</ref> See {{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:4|KJV}}, {{bibleverse || John|10:34\u201336|KJV}}, {{bibleverse || Psalm|82:6|KJV}}. The entire life of the church is oriented towards making this possible and facilitating it.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church the terms \"mystery\" or \"the mysteries\" refer to the process of ''theosis''. While it is understood that God theoretically can do anything instantly and invisibly, it is also understood that he generally chooses to use material substance as a medium in order to reach people. The limitations are those of mankind, not God. Matter is not considered to be evil by the Eastern Orthodox. Water, oil, bread, wine, etc., all are means by which God reaches out to allow people to draw closer to him. How this process works is a \"mystery\" and cannot be defined in human terms. These mysteries are surrounded by prayer and symbolism so that their true meaning will not be forgotten.\n\nThose things which in the West are often termed [[sacraments]] or [[sacramentals]] are known among the Eastern Orthodox as the \"sacred mysteries\". While the Catholic Church numbers seven sacraments, and many Protestant groups list two (Baptism and the Eucharist) or even none, the Eastern Orthodox do not limit the number. However, for the sake of convenience, [[catechism]]s will often speak of the seven Great Mysteries. Among these are [[Holy Communion]] (the most direct connection), [[Baptism]], [[Chrismation]], [[Confession (religion)|Confession]], [[Unction]], [[Matrimony]], and [[Ordination]]. But the term also properly applies to other sacred actions such as monastic [[tonsure]] or the blessing of [[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|holy water]], and involves fasting, almsgiving, or an act as simple as lighting a candle, burning incense, praying or asking God's blessing on food.{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=274-277}}\n\n===Baptism===\n[[File:GreekOrthodoxBaptism1.jpg|thumb|right|An Orthodox baptism]]\n\n[[Baptism]] is the Mystery which transforms the old and sinful person into a new and pure one; the old life, the sins, any mistakes made are gone and a clean slate is given. Through Baptism a person is united to the [[Body of Christ]] by becoming a member of the Orthodox Church. During the service, [[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|water]] is blessed. The catechumen is fully immersed in the water three times in the name of the Holy Trinity. This is considered to be a death of the \"old man\" by participation in the crucifixion and burial of Christ, and a rebirth into new life in Christ by participation in his resurrection.{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=277-278}} Properly a new name is given, which becomes the person's name.\n\nChildren of Orthodox families are normally baptized shortly after birth. Converts to Orthodoxy are usually formally baptized into the Orthodox Church, though exceptions are sometimes made. Those who have left Orthodoxy and adopted a new religion, if they return to their Orthodox roots, are usually received back into the church through the Mystery of Chrismation.\n\nProperly, the Mystery of Baptism is administered by bishops and priests; however, in emergencies any Orthodox Christian can baptize.{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=278}} In such cases, should the person survive the emergency, it is likely that the person will be properly baptized by a priest at some later date. This is not considered to be a second baptism, nor is it imagined that the person is not already Orthodox, but rather it is a fulfillment of the proper form.\n\nThe service of Baptism used in Orthodox churches has remained largely unchanged for over 1500 years. This fact is witnessed to by St. [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (d. 386), who, in his ''Discourse on the Sacrament of Baptism'', describes the service in much the same way as is currently in use.\n\n===Chrismation===\n[[Chrismation]] (sometimes called [[confirmation]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oca.org/OCchapter.asp?SID=2&ID=52 |title=The Orthodox Faith |author=Fr.

(Some autocephalous churches get their chrism from others.) Anointing with it substitutes for the laying-on of hands described in the New Testament, even when an instrument such as a brush is used.{{sfn|Harakas|1987|p=57}}\n\n===Holy Communion (Eucharist)===\n[[File:Liturgy St James 1.jpg|thumb|left|Eucharistic elements prepared for the Divine Liturgy]]\n[[File:\u039a\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a0\u03ac\u03c3\u03c7\u03b1 - \u00ab\u03a3\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5\u00bb.JPG|upright=0.8|thumb|An icon of Holy Communion: \"Receive the Body of Christ; taste the Fountain of Immortality.\"]]\n\nThe [[Eucharist]] is at the center of Orthodox Christianity. In practice, it is the partaking of the [[Body of Christ|Body]] and [[Blood of Jesus Christ]] in the midst of the [[Divine Liturgy]] with the rest of the church. The bread and wine are believed to become the genuine Body and Blood of the Christ [[Jesus]] through the operation of the Holy Spirit. The Orthodox Church has never{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} described exactly how this occurs, or gone into the detail that the Catholic Church has in the West.\n\nCommunion is given only to baptized and chrismated Orthodox Christians who have prepared by fasting, prayer and confession. The priest will administer the gifts with a spoon, called a \"cochlear\", directly into the recipient's mouth from the chalice.{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=287}} From baptism young infants and children are carried to the chalice to receive holy communion.<ref name=ware1993p279 />\n\nBecause of the Orthodox understanding of mankind's fallen nature in general those who wish to commune prepare themselves in a way that reflects mankind in paradise. First, they prepare by having their confession heard and the prayer of repentance read over them by a priest. They will increase their prayer rule, adding the prescribed prayers in preparation for communing. Finally, they will fast completely from food and drink from the evening of the previous day (usually sunset on Saturday if communing on Sunday).\n\n===Repentance (Confession)===\n{{Main|Confession (religion)}}\n\nOrthodox Christians who have committed sins but repent of them, and who wish to reconcile themselves to God and renew the purity of their original [[baptism]]s, confess their sins to God before a spiritual guide who offers advice and direction to assist the individual in overcoming their sin. Parish priests commonly function as spiritual guides, but such guides can be any person, male or female, who has been given a blessing to hear confessions. Spiritual guides are chosen very carefully as this is a mandate that once chosen must be obeyed. Having confessed, the penitent then has his or her parish priest read the prayer of repentance over them.\n\nSin is not viewed by the Orthodox as a stain on the soul that needs to be wiped out, or a legal transgression that must be set right by a punitive sentence, but rather as a mistake made by the individual with the opportunity for spiritual growth and development. An act of [[Penance]] (''epitemia''), if the spiritual guide requires it, is never formulaic, but rather is directed toward the individual and their particular problem, as a means of establishing a deeper understanding of the mistake made, and how to effect its cure. Because full participatory membership is granted to infants, it is not unusual for even small children to confess; though the scope of their culpability is far less than an older child, still their opportunity for spiritual growth remains the same.\n\n===Marriage===\n{{further|Marriage in the Eastern Orthodox Church}}\n[[File:Wedding of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna by Laurits Tuxen (1895, Hermitage).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The wedding of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]].]]\nFrom the Orthodox perspective, marriage is one of the holy mysteries or sacraments.

For the Orthodox, to say that marriage is indissoluble means that it should not be broken, the violation of such a union, perceived as holy, being an offense resulting from either adultery or the prolonged absence of one of the partners. Thus, permitting remarriage is an act of compassion of the Church towards sinful man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/liturgics/athenagoras_remarriage.htm|title=Marriage, Divorce and Remarriage in the Orthodox Church: Economia and Pastoral Guidance|publisher=The Orthodox research Institute|author=Mgr.

Widows are permitted to remarry without repercussion and their second marriage is considered just as valid as the first. One exception to this rule is the clergy and their wives. Should a married priest die, it is normal that his wife will retire to a monastery once their children are out of the house. Widowed priests are not allowed to remarry (no priest may be married after his ordination) and also frequently end up in monasteries.\n\nThe service of Marriage in the Orthodox Church has two distinct parts: the Betrothal and the Crowning. There is no exchange of vows. There is a set expectation of the obligations incumbent on a married couple, and whatever promises they may have privately to each other are their responsibility to keep.\n\n===Holy Orders===\n[[File:Orthodox clergy.jpg|thumb|Clergy at All Saints' Antiochian Orthodox Church, Raleigh, United States (L to R): priest, two deacons, bishop.]]\nSince its founding, the Church spread to different places and its leaders in each region came to be known as ''episkopoi'' (overseers, plural of ''episkopos'', overseer\u2014Gr. \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2), which became \"[[bishop]]\" in English. The other [[Holy Orders|ordained]] roles are ''presbyter'' (Gr. {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b2\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}}, elder), which became \"prester\" and then \"[[priest]]\" in English, and ''diakonos'' (Gr. {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}}, servant), which became \"[[deacon]]\" in English (see also [[subdeacon]]). There are numerous administrative positions among the clergy that carry additional titles.\n\nIn the Greek tradition, bishops who occupy an ancient see are called metropolitans, while the lead bishop in Greece is the archbishop. (In the Russian tradition, however, the usage of the terms \"metropolitan\" and \"archbishop\" is reversed.) Priests can be archpriests, archimandrites or protopresbyters. Deacons can also be archdeacons or protodeacons. The position of deacon is often occupied for life. The deacon also acts as an assistant to a bishop.\n\nWith the exception of bishops, who remain [[Celibacy|celibate]], the Orthodox Church has always allowed priests and deacons to be married, provided the marriage takes place before [[Holy Orders|ordination]]. In general it is considered preferable for parish priests to be married as they often act as counsel to married couples and thus can draw on their own experience. Unmarried priests usually are monks and live in monasteries, though there are occasions when, because of a lack of married priests, a monk-priest is temporarily assigned to a parish.\n\nWidowed priests and deacons may not remarry and it is common for such members of the clergy to retire to a monastery (see [[clerical celibacy]]). This is also true of widowed wives of clergy, who do not remarry and become nuns when their children are grown. Only men are allowed to take holy orders, although deaconesses had both liturgical and pastoral functions within the church.<ref name=\"Karras\">{{cite journal\n| doi = 10.1017/S000964070010928X\n| last = Karras\n| first = Valerie A.\n| date=June 2004\n| title = Female Deacons in the Byzantine Church\n| journal = Church History\n| volume = 73\n| issue = 2\n| pages = 272\u2013316\n| issn = 0009-6407\n| quote =\n}}</ref> However, it has fallen out of practice (the last deaconess was ordained in the 19th century).\n\nIn 2017, Patriarch Theodoros II and the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Alexandria decided to reinstate the order of deaconesses in the Greek Orthodox Church.  In February, he appointed six nuns to be subdeacons within the church.

In Greece, during the Ottoman occupation, it became the custom to administer this Mystery annually on [[Holy Wednesday|Great Wednesday]] to all believers; in recent decades, this custom has spread to many other locations. It is often distributed on major feast days, or any time the clergy feel it necessary for the spiritual welfare of its congregation.\n\nAccording to Orthodox teaching unction is based on the [[Epistle of James]]:\n\n<blockquote>Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.\u2014{{bibleverse || James|5:14\u201315|KJV}}</blockquote>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Orthodox Church}}\n\n===Early Church===\n[[File:Ephesus IchthysCrop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|An early Christian \"[[Ichthys]]\" (''fish'') inscription from ancient [[Ephesus]]]]\n\nFollowing Jesus Christ's [[Great Commission]] to the apostles, Christianity spread rapidly throughout the Roman Empire.

A number of influential schools of thought had arisen, particularly the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria|Alexandrian]] and [[School of Antioch|Antiochian]] philosophical approaches. Other groups, such as the [[Arians]], had also managed to gain influence. However, their positions caused theological conflicts within the Church, thus prompting the Emperor Constantine to call for a great ecumenical synod in order to define the Church's position against the growing, often widely diverging, philosophical and theological interpretations of Christianity. He made it possible for this council to meet not only by providing a location, but by offering to pay for the transportation of all the existing bishops of the Church. Most modern Christian Churches regard this synod, commonly called the [[First Council of Nicaea]] or more generally the [[First Ecumenical Council]],<ref name=ware1993 /><ref>{{cite book| author = Tom\u00e1\u0161 \u0160pidl\u00edk\n| title = The spirituality of the Christian East: a systematic handbook| year = 1986\n| isbn = 978-0-87907-879-9 }}</ref> as of major importance.\n\n=== Ecumenical councils ===\n{{Main|First seven Ecumenical Councils}}\n{{See also|State church of the Roman Empire}}\n[[File:Nicaea icon.jpg|thumb|Icon depicting [[Constantine I|the Emperor Constantine]] and the [[bishop]]s of the First Council of Nicaea (325) holding the [[Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed|Niceno\u2013Constantinopolitan Creed of 381]].]]\n\nSeveral doctrinal disputes from the 4th century onwards led to the calling of [[Ecumenical council]]s. In the Orthodox Church, an Ecumenical council is the supreme authority that can be invoked to resolve contested issues of the faith. As such, these councils have been held to resolve the most important theological matters that came to be disputed within the Church. Many lesser disagreements were resolved through local councils in the areas where they arose, before they grew significant enough to require an Ecumenical council.\n\nThere are seven councils authoritatively recognised as Ecumenical:\n# The [[First Council of Nicaea|First Ecumenical Council]] was convoked by the Roman Emperor Constantine at [[Nicaea]] in 325 and presided over by the Patriarch [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]], with over 300 bishops condemning the view of [[Arius]] that the Son is a created being inferior to the Father.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8062|title=The First Ecumenical Council \u2014 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n# The [[First Council of Constantinople|Second Ecumenical Council]] was held at Constantinople in 381, presided over by the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch, with 150 bishops, defining the nature of the Holy Spirit against those asserting His inequality with the other persons of the Trinity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8065|title=The Second Ecumenical Council \u2014 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n# The [[First Council of Ephesus|Third Ecumenical Council]] is that of Ephesus in 431, presided over by the Patriarch of Alexandria, with 250 bishops, which affirmed that Mary is truly \"Birthgiver\" or \"Mother\" of God (''[[Theotokos]]''), contrary to the teachings of [[Nestorius]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8066|title=The Third Ecumenical Council \u2014 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n# The [[Council of Chalcedon|Fourth Ecumenical Council]] is that of Chalcedon in 451, Patriarch of Constantinople presiding, 500 bishops, affirmed that Jesus is truly God and truly man, without mixture of the two natures, contrary to [[Monophysite]] teaching.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8067|title=The Fourth Ecumenical Council \u2014 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n# The [[Second Council of Constantinople|Fifth Ecumenical Council]] is the second of Constantinople in 553, interpreting the decrees of Chalcedon and further explaining the relationship of the two natures of Jesus; it also condemned the alleged teachings of [[Origen]] on the pre-existence of the soul, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8068|title=The Fifth Ecumenical Council \u2014 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n# The [[Third Council of Constantinople|Sixth Ecumenical Council]] is the third of Constantinople in 681; it declared that Christ has two wills of his two natures, human and divine, contrary to the teachings of the [[Monothelites]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8069|title=The Sixth Ecumenical Council \u2014 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n# The [[Second Council of Nicaea|Seventh Ecumenical Council]] was called under the Empress Regent [[Irene of Athens]] in 787, known as the second of Nicaea.

All Orthodox agree that the decisions of these further councils are valid; the disagreement is only whether they carry sufficient importance to be considered truly ''Ecumenical:''\n:8. The [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|Fourth Council of Constantinople]] was called in 879. It restored St. [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] to his See in Constantinople and condemned any alteration of the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381.\n\n:9. The [[Fifth Council of Constantinople]] was actually a series of councils held between 1341 and 1351. It affirmed the [[Hesychasm|hesychastic]] theology of St. [[Gregory Palamas]] and condemned the philosopher [[Barlaam of Calabria]].\n\nIn addition to these councils there have been a number of other significant councils meant to further define the Orthodox position. They are the Synods of Constantinople, in [[Synod of Constantinople (1484)|1484]], 1583, [[Oros of the Holy Great Church of Christ|1755]], 1819, and 1872, the [[Synod of Jassy]] (Ia\u0219i) in 1642, and the Pan-Orthodox [[Synod of Jerusalem (1672)|Synod of Jerusalem in 1672]].

Eventually this led to each group [[Anathema#Religious usage|anathematizing]] the other. Those that remained in communion with the other patriarchs (by accepting the Council of Chalcedon) are known today as the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], where the adjective \"Greek\" refers to their ties to the Greek-speaking culture of the Byzantine Empire. However, those who disagreed with the findings of the Council of Chalcedon were the majority in Egypt, and today they are known as the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], having maintained a separate patriarchate. The Coptic Orthodox Church is currently the largest Christian church in Egypt and in the whole Middle East. There was also a similar, albeit smaller scale, split in [[Syria]] ([[Patriarchate of Antioch]]), which resulted in the separation of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] from the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Byzantine Patriarchate of Antioch]].\n\nThose who disagreed with the Council of Chalcedon are sometimes called \"[[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]]\" to distinguish them from the \"[[Eastern Orthodox]]\", who accepted the Council of Chalcedon. Oriental Orthodox are also sometimes referred to as \"non-Chalcedonians\", or \"anti-Chalcedonians\". The Oriental Orthodox Church denies that it is monophysite and prefers the term \"[[miaphysite]]\", to denote the \"united\" nature of Jesus (two natures united into one) consistent with St. Cyril's theology: \"The term union...signifies the concurrence in one reality of those things which are understood to be united\" and \"the Word who is ineffably united with it in a manner beyond all description\" ([[St. Cyril of Alexandria]], ''On the Unity of Christ''). Both the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches formally believe themselves to be the continuation of the true church, although over the last several decades there has been considerable reconciliation and the prospect of reunification has been discussed.\n\nAs well, there are the \"[[Nestorianism|Nestorian]]\" churches, which are Eastern Christian churches that keep the faith of only the first two ecumenical councils, i.e., the First Council of Nicaea and the First Council of Constantinople. \"Nestorian\" is an outsider's term for a tradition that predated the influence of [[Nestorius]], the origin of which might lay in certain sections of the [[School of Antioch]] or via Nestorius' teachers [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] or [[Diodore of Tarsus]]. The \"[[Nestorian Church]]\" is commonly referred to as \"the Assyrian Church\" or fully as the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].\n\n===Conversion of East and South Slavs===\n{{Further|Christianization of Bulgaria|Christianization of the Rus' Khaganate|Christianization of Kievan Rus'}}\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, Christianity made great inroads into pagan Europe, including [[Kievan Rus']]. This work was made possible by the work of the Byzantine-era [[saints Cyril and Methodius]]. When king [[Rastislav of Moravia]] asked Byzantium for teachers who could minister to the Moravians in their own language, [[Michael III|Byzantine emperor Michael III]] chose these two brothers. Cyril and Methodius translated the [[Bible]] and many of the prayer books. As the translations prepared by them were copied by speakers of other dialects, the hybrid literary language [[Old Church Slavonic]] was created. Originally sent to convert the Slavs of [[Great Moravia]], Cyril and Methodius were forced to compete with [[Frankish mythology|Frankish]] missionaries from the Roman diocese. Their disciples were driven out of Great Moravia in AD 886.<ref>A. Avenarius. Christianity in 9th-century Rus. // Beitruge zur byzantinischen Geschichte im 9.-11. Jahrhundert. Prague: V.

In a short time, the disciples of Cyril and Methodius managed to prepare and instruct the future Bulgarian clergy into the biblical texts and in AD 893, proclaimed the first organized Church on the Balkan Peninsula.

There were doctrinal issues like the [[filioque clause]] and the authority of the Roman [[Pope]] involved in the split, but these were greatly exacerbated by political factors of both Church and state, and by cultural and linguistic differences between Latins and Greeks. Regarding [[Papal supremacy]], the Eastern half grew disillusioned with the Pope's centralization of power, as well as his blatant attempts of excluding the Eastern half in regard to Papacy approvals. It used to be that the Emperor would at least have say when a new Pope would be elected, but towards the high Middle Ages, the Christians in Rome were slowly consolidating power and removing Byzantine influence. However, even before this exclusionary tendency from the West, well before 1054, the Eastern and Western halves of the Church were in perpetual conflict, particularly during the periods of Eastern [[iconoclasm]] and the [[Photian schism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodox.org.ph/content/view/211/50/|title=East-West Schism 01|publisher=Orthodox Church in the Philippines|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114151752/http://www.orthodox.org.ph/content/view/211/50/ |archive-date=14 January 2012 |dead-url=yes |access-date=20 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tintoretto.2tomaconstantinopla.jpg|thumb|Latin Crusaders [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sacking the city of Constantinople]], the capital of the Eastern Orthodox controlled [[Byzantine Empire]], in 1204.]]\n\nThe final breach is often considered to have arisen after the capture and sacking of Constantinople by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204; the final break with Rome occurred circa 1450.

The Orthodox trace their bishops back to the apostles through [[apostolic succession]], and continue the ancient Christian practices of veneration of saints, especially Mary the Mother of God as the [[Theotokos]], prayers for the dead, and [[monasticism]]. Orthodoxy does not openly promote [[statuary]], although it is not expressly condemned, instead limiting itself primarily to two-dimensional iconography. Western theological concepts of [[original sin]], [[substitutionary atonement]], [[predestination]], [[purgatory]] and [[particular judgment]] are generally rejected by traditional Orthodox theologians.\n\nThe Orthodox believe themselves to be the [[Four Marks of the Church|One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church]], that is, the true Church established by Jesus Christ and placed into the care of the apostles. As almost all other Christian groups are in indirect schism with the Orthodox Church, mostly as a result of the [[East-West schism|Great Schism]] with the [[Catholic Church]] at the turn of the second Christian millennium (before the schisms of the [[Protestant Reformation]]), these other groups are viewed as being Christian, but who, to varying degrees, lack full theological orthodoxy and [[orthopraxy]]. As such, all groups outside of the Orthodox Church are not seen as being members of the Church proper, but rather separated brethren who have failed to retain the fullness of the Christian faith and theology. These deviations from orthodoxy have traditionally been called [[heresy]], but due to the term's perceived pejorative connotations, some prefer the more technical designation of the term [[heterodoxy]].\n\nIn 1920, the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]], published an encyclical \"addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded [[League of Nations]]\".<ref name=\"Ware1993\">{{cite book|last=Ware|first=Kallistos|title=The Orthodox Church|accessdate=|date=29 April 1993|publisher=Penguin Adult|language=English |isbn=9780140146561|page=322|quote=From the beginning of the twentieth century the Ecumenical Patriarchate has shown a special concern for Christian reconciliation. At his accession in 1902, Patriarch Joachim III sent an encyclical letter to all the autocephalous Orthodox Churches, asking in particular for their opinion on relations with other Christian bodies. In January 1920 the Ecumenical Patriarchate followed this up with a bold and prophetic letter addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded League of Nations. Many of the ideas in this letter anticipate subsequent developments in the WCC. Constantinople, along with several of the other Orthodox Churches, was represented at the Faith and Order Conferences at Lausanne in 1927 and at Edinburgh in 1937.

The main traditional historical communion is divided into two groups - those who use the [[Revised Julian calendar]] for calculating fixed feasts and the Julian calendar for calculating movable feasts, and those who use the Julian calendar for all purposes. This second group may include congregations whose church allows them to choose, with the proviso that the choice remains in effect at least until the end of the church year. Also in communion are the Estonian and Finnish Orthodox churches who have a dispensation to use the [[Gregorian calendar]] for all purposes. Another group are referred to as [[True Orthodoxy]] (also [[Old Calendarists]]), they are those who, without authority from their parent churches, have continued to use the old [[Julian calendar]], claiming that the [[Old Calendarists|calendar reform]] in the 1920s is in contravention of the [[ecumenical councils]]. Similarly, another group called [[Old Believers]], separated in 1666 from the official Russian Orthodox Church as a protest against church rite reforms introduced by [[Patriarch Nikon of Moscow]]. As Eastern Orthodox Christianity is both collegial and local in structure, there is no single organization called the \"True Orthodox Church\" nor is there official recognition among the \"True Orthodox\" as to who is properly included among them. While some unions have taken place even up to the present, the majority of True Orthodox are only secondarily concerned with reunion as opposed to preservation of Eastern Orthodox teaching. The calendar question reflects the dispute between those who wish to use a calendar which is reformed yet not Gregorian (effectively gaining the perceived benefits of the Gregorian calendar without disregarding the three anathemas issued against it in the sixteenth century), something which opponents consider unnecessary and damaging to continuity, and those who wish to maintain the traditional ecclesiastical calendar (which happens to be based on the Julian calendar), arguing that such a modern change goes against 1900 years of Church tradition and was in fact perpetrated without an ecumenical council, which would surely have rejected the idea.\n\n[[File:\u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd \u0395\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u039d. \u039a\u03bf\u03c4\u03b6\u03b9\u03ac \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039f\u03c1\u03b8\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03be\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7, 16-27-6-2016 (27614224782).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Pan-Orthodox Council]], Kolymvari, Crete, Greece, June 2016]]\n\nThe dispute has led to much acrimony, and sometimes even to violence. Following canonical precepts, some adherents of the old calendar have chosen to abstain from clerical intercommunion with those synods which have embraced the new calendar until the conflict is resolved. The monastic communities on [[Mount Athos]] have provided the strongest opposition to the new calendar, and to [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|modernism]] in general, while still maintaining communion with their mother church.\n\nSome latent discontent between different [[national church]]es exists also in part due to different approach towards [[ecumenism]]. While the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]], the Orthodox bishops in North America gathered into the [[Standing Conference of the Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas]] (SCOBA), Romanian bishops, and others are fairly open to dialogue with the [[Catholic Church]], both conservative and moderate Old Calendarists, many of the monks of Mount Athos, several bishops of Russian, Serbian, and some of Greek and Bulgarian churches regard ecumenism as compromising essential doctrinal stands in order to accommodate [[List of Christian denominations|other Christians]], and object to the emphasis on dialogue leading to inter-communion; believing instead that Orthodox must speak the truth with love, in the hope of leading to the eventual conversion to Orthodoxy of [[heterodox]] Christians.{{clarify|reason=please rewrite this overlong sentence to avoid damaging reader's brain|date=April 2014}}\n\nEastern Orthodox Christians are [[American upper class|among the wealthiest]] Christian denominations in the United States.<ref name=\"Leonhardt\">{{cite news|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/faith-education-and-income/|title=Faith, Education and Income|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 May 2011|first=David|last=Leonhardt|date=13 May 2011}}</ref> They also tend to be better educated than most other religious groups in America, having a high number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] (68%) and [[post-graduate]] (28%) degrees per capita.<ref name=\"The Pew Forum\">{{Citation|url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf|title=US Religious Landscape Survey: Diverse and Dynamic|format=PDF|publisher=The Pew Forum|page=85|date=February 2008|accessdate=17 September 2012|ref=refEducationLevel}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] (ROCOR) has recently united with the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Moscow Patriarchate]] (MP); these two branches of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] had separated from each other in the 1920s due to the subjection of the latter to the hostile [[Soviet Union|Soviet regime]] (see [[Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate|Act of Canonical Communion]]).\n\n===Main communion===\nThe Orthodox Church is a [[full communion|communion]] of 14 [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]] (that is, administratively completely independent) regional churches,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ec-patr.org/dioceses.php?lang=en&id=99|title=Ecumenical Patriarchate|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref> plus the [[Orthodox Church in America]].

He was a bishop of Berytus (modern-day [[Beirut]]) in [[Phoenicia]]. He was later made the see of [[Nicomedia]], where the imperial court resided. He lived finally in [[Constantinople]] from 338 up to his death.\n\n==Influence in the Imperial family and the Imperial court==\nDistantly related to the imperial family of [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]], he owed his progression from a less significant [[Levant]]ine bishopric to the most important [[episcopal see]] to his influence at court, and the great power he wielded in the Church was derived from that source. In fact, during his time in the Imperial court, the Eastern court and the major positions in the Eastern Church were held by [[Arians]] or Arian sympathizers.<ref name=\"drake-pp395\">Drake, \"Constantine and the Bishops\", pp.395.</ref> With the exception of a short period of eclipse, he enjoyed the confidence both of Constantine and [[Constantius II]]. He also served as the tutor of the later Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]; and it was he who baptized [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine the Great]] on May 22, 337 owing to his familial relationship with the emperor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05623b.htm|title=Eusebius of Nicomedia|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> Also during his time in the Imperial court, Arianism became more popular with the Royal family.<ref name=\"ellingsen-pp121\">Ellingsen, \"Reclaiming Our Roots: An Inclusive Introduction to Church History, Vol. I, The Late First Century to the Eve of the Reformation\", pp.121.</ref> It can be logically surmised that Eusebius had a huge hand in the acceptance of Arianism in the Constantinian household. The Arian influence grew so strong during his tenure in the Imperial court that it was not until the end of the [[Constantinian dynasty]] and the appointment of [[Theodosius I]] that Arianism lost its influence in the Empire.<ref name=\"young-pp92\">Young, \"From Nicaea to Chalcedon\", pp.92.</ref>\n\nIt was of particular interest that Eusebius was nearly persecuted because of his close relationship to the Emperor [[Flavius Galerius Valerius Licinianus Licinius|Licinius]] while serving as Bishop of Nicomedia during [[Flavius Galerius Valerius Licinianus Licinius|Licinius']] reign.\n\n==Relationship with Arius==\nLike [[Arius]], he was a pupil of [[Lucian of Antioch]], and it is probable that he held the same views as Arius from the very beginning; he was also one of Arius' most fervent supporters who encouraged Arius.<ref name=\"jones-pp121\">Jones, \"Constantine and the Conversion of Europe\", pp.121.</ref> It was also because of this relationship that he was the first person whom Arius contacted after the latter was excommunicated from Alexandria by [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander]].<ref name=\"young-pp59\">Young, \"From Nicaea to Chalcedon\", pp.59.</ref> Apparently, Arius and Eusebius were close enough  and Eusebius powerful enough that Arius was able to put his theology down in writing.<ref name=\"young-pp61\">Young, \"From Nicaea to Chalcedon\", pp.61.</ref> He afterward modified his ideas somewhat, or perhaps he only yielded to the pressure of circumstances; but he was, if not the teacher, at all events the leader and organizer, of the [[Arianism|Arian]] council.\n\nAt the [[First Council of Nicaea]], 325, he signed the Confession, but only after a long and desperate opposition in which he \"subscribe with hand only, not heart\"<ref name=\"amidon-10.5\">Amidon, \"The Church History of Rufinus of Aquileia: Books 10 and 11\", 10.5.</ref> according to ancient sources. It was a huge blow to the Arian party since it was surmised that the participants in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] were evenly split between non-Arians and Arians.<ref name=\"lim-pp183\">Lim, \"Public Disputation, power, and social order in late antiquity\", pp.183.</ref>\nHis defense of Arius angered the emperor, and a few months after the council\nhe was sent into exile due to his continual contacts with Arius and his followers.<ref name=\"drake-pp259\">Drake, \"Constantine and the Bishops\", pp.259.</ref> After the lapse of three years, he succeeded in regaining the imperial favor by convincing Constantine that Arius and his views do not conflict with the  proclaimed Nicene Creed.<ref name=\"roldanus-pp82\">Roldanus, \"The Church in the Age of Constantine: the Theological Challenges\", pp.82.</ref> After his return in 329 he brought the whole machinery of the state government into action in order to impose his views upon the [[Christianity|Church]].\n\n==Political and religious career==\nIn complement to his theological interests, Eusebius was a skilled politician. Upon his return, he regained the lost ground resulted from the [[First Council of Nicaea]], established alliances with other groups such as the [[Meletians]] and expelled many opponents.\n\nHe was described by modern historians as an \"ambitious intriguer\" <ref name=\"roldanus-pp78\">Roldanus, \"The Church in the Age of Constantine: The Theological Challenges\", pp.78.</ref> and a \"consummate political player\".<ref name=\"drake-pp395\"/> He was also described by ancient sources as a high-handed person who was also aggressive in his dealings.;<ref name=\"amidon-10.12\">Amidon, \"The Church History of Rufinus of Aquileia: Books 10 and 11\", 10.12.</ref> he also used his allies to spy on his opponents.\n\nHe was able to dislodge and exile three key opponents who espoused the [[First Council of Nicaea]]: [[Eustathius of Antioch]] in 330, [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] in 335 and [[Marcellus of Ancyra]] in 336. This was no small feat since Athanasius was regarded as a \"man of God\" by Constantine.<ref name=\"roldanus-pp84\">Roldanus, \"The Church in the Age of Constantine: the Theological Challenges\", pp.84.</ref> and both Eustathius and Athanasius held top positions in the church.\n\nAnother major feat was his appointment as the Patriarch of Constantinople by expelling [[Paul I of Constantinople]]; Paul would eventually return as Patriarch after Eusebius' death.\n\nEven outside the empire, Eusebius had great influence. He brought [[Ulfilas]] into the Arian priesthood and sent the latter to convert the heathen Goths.\n\nEusebius baptised [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine the Great]] in his villa in Nicomedia, on May 22, 337 just before the death of the Emperor.\n\n==Death and aftermath==\nHe died at the height of his power in the year 341.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05623b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Eusebius of Nicomedia|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref>\n\nHe was so influential that even after his death, [[Constantius II]] heeded his and Eudoxus of Constantinople's advice to attempt to convert the [[Roman Empire]] to [[Arianism]] by creating Arian Councils and official Arian Doctrines.<ref name=\"guitton-pp86\">Guitton, \"Great Heresies and Church Councils\", pp.86.</ref>\n\nIt was because of Eusebius that \"On the whole, Constantine and his successors made life pretty miserable for Church leaders committed to the Nicene decision and its Trinitarian formula.\"<ref name=\"ellingsen-pp119\">Ellingsen, \"Reclaiming Our Roots: An Inclusive Introduction to Church History, Vol. I, The Late First Century to the Eve of the Reformation\", pp.119.</ref>\n\nEusebius of Nicomedia is not to be confused with his contemporary [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], the author of a well-known early book of Church History.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Amidon\n | first = Philip R.\n | title = The Church History of Rufinus of Aquileia: Books 10 and 11\n |

An estimated 100,000 people died in the fire. During the [[Edo period]], there were about 100 fires mostly begun by accident and often quickly escalating and spreading through neighborhoods of wooden ''[[machiya]]'' which were heated with charcoal fires.

[[Machi-bugy\u014d]] (City Commissioners) were in charge of protecting the citizens and merchants of Edo, and [[Kanj\u014d-bugy\u014d]] (finance commissioners) were responsible for the financial matters of the Shogunate. <ref>{{cite book|last1=Deal|first1=William E.|title=Handbook to life in medieval and early modern Japan|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195331265}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Edo Hibachi.JPG|thumb|left|''Ch\u014dnin''-room exhibit at the Fukagawa Edo Museum|alt=Museum room with wood furniture and cooking utensils in center]]\nThe city was laid out as a [[castle town]] around [[Edo Castle]]. The area surrounding the castle known as ''Yamanote'' consisted largely of ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' mansions, whose families lived in Edo as part of the ''[[sankin k\u014dtai]]'' system; the ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' made journeys in alternating years to Edo, and used the mansions for their entourages. It was this extensive [[samurai|samurai class]] which defined the character of Edo, particularly in contrast to the two major cities of [[Kyoto]] and [[Osaka]] neither of which were ruled by a ''daimy\u014d'' or had a significant samurai population. Kyoto's character was defined by the Imperial Court, the [[kuge|court nobles]], its Buddhist temples and its history; Osaka was the country's commercial center, dominated by the ''[[ch\u014dnin]]'' or the merchant class.\n\nAreas further from the center were the domain of the ''ch\u014dnin'' (\u753a\u4eba, \"townsfolk\"). The area known as [[Shitamachi]] (\u4e0b\u753a, \"lower town\" or \"downtown\"), northeast of the castle, was a center of urban culture. The ancient Buddhist temple of [[Sens\u014d-ji]] still stands in [[Asakusa]], marking the center of an area of traditional Shitamachi culture. Some shops in the streets near the temple have existed continuously in the same location since the Edo period.\n\nThe [[Sumida River]], then called the Great River (\u5927\u5ddd, ''\u014ckawa''), ran along the eastern edge of the city. The shogunate's official rice-storage warehouses,<ref>Taxes, and samurai stipends, were paid not in [[money|coin]], but in rice. See ''[[koku]]''.</ref> other official buildings and some of the city's best-known restaurants were located here.\n\n[[File:Hiroshige le pont Nihonbashi \u00e0 l'aube.jpg|thumb|Nihonbashi in Edo, ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' print by [[Hiroshige]]|alt=Illustration of people crossing the wooden Edo Bridge]]\nThe [[Nihonbashi|\"Japan Bridge\"]] (\u65e5\u672c\u6a4b, ''Nihon-bashi'') marked the center of the city's commercial center, an area also known as ''Kuramae'' (\u8535\u524d, \"in front of the storehouses\"). Fishermen, craftsmen and other producers and retailers operated here. Shippers managed ships known as ''tarubune'' to and from [[Osaka]] and other cities, bringing goods into the city or transferring them from sea routes to river barges or land routes such as the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d (road)|T\u014dkaid\u014d]]. This area remains the center of Tokyo's financial and business district.\n\nThe northeastern corner of the city was considered a dangerous direction in traditional ''[[onmy\u014dd\u014d]]'' (cosmology), and is protected from evil by a number of temples including Sens\u014d-ji and [[Kan'ei-ji]]. Beyond this were the districts of the ''[[burakumin|eta]]'' or outcasts, who performed \"unclean\" work and were separated from the main parts of the city. A path and a canal, a short distance north of the ''eta'' districts, extended west from the riverbank leading along the northern edge of the city to the [[Yoshiwara]] pleasure districts. Previously located near [[Ningyocho]], the districts were rebuilt in this more-remote location after the [[Great Fire of Meireki]] in 1657, as the city expanded.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{wide image|Edo Panorama old Tokyo color photochrom.jpg|750px|Edo, 1865 or 1866.

Each explosive is set on a solid marble base and is initiated by a glowing wooden stick.]]\n\nAn '''explosive material''', also called an '''explosive''', is a reactive substance that contains a great amount of potential energy that can produce an [[explosion]] if released suddenly, usually accompanied by the production of [[light]], [[heat]], [[sound]], and [[pressure]]. An '''explosive charge''' is a measured quantity of explosive material, which may be composed of a single ingredient or a combination of two or more.\n\nThe potential energy stored in an explosive material may, for example, be\n*[[chemical energy]], such as [[nitroglycerin]] or [[grain dust]]\n*[[pressure|pressurized]] [[gas compressor|gas]], such as a [[gas cylinder]] or [[aerosol can]]\n*[[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] energy, such as in the [[fissile]] [[isotope]]s [[uranium-235]] and [[plutonium-239]]\n\nExplosive materials may be categorized by the speed at which they expand. Materials that [[detonate]] (the front of the chemical reaction moves faster through the material than the [[speed of sound]]) are said to be \"high explosives\" and materials that [[deflagration|deflagrate]] are said to be \"low explosives\". Explosives may also be categorized by their [[sensitivity (explosives)|sensitivity]]. Sensitive materials that can be initiated by a relatively small amount of heat or pressure are [[primary explosive]]s and materials that are relatively insensitive are [[secondary explosives|secondary]] or [[tertiary explosive]]s.\n\nA wide variety of chemicals can explode; a smaller number are manufactured specifically for the purpose of being used as explosives. The remainder are too dangerous, sensitive, toxic, expensive, unstable, or prone to decomposition or degradation over short time spans.\n\nIn contrast, some materials are merely [[combustible]] or [[flammable]] if they burn without exploding.\n\nThe distinction, however, is not razor-sharp. Certain materials\u2014dusts, powders, gases, or volatile organic liquids\u2014may be simply combustible or flammable under ordinary conditions, but become explosive in specific situations or forms, such as [[dust explosion|dispersed airborne clouds]], or [[Gas explosion|confinement or sudden release]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of gunpowder}}\nAt its root, the history of chemical explosives lies in the history of gunpowder.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Weapons of Mass Destruction |last= Sastri |first=M.N. |publisher=APH Publishing Corporation |year=2004 |isbn=978-8176487429 |pages=1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Chemistry in Daily Life |last=Singh |first=Kirpal |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=2010 |isbn=978-8120346178 |pages=68}}</ref> During the Tang Dynasty in the 9th century, Taoist Chinese alchemists were eagerly trying to find the elixir of immortality.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://gbtimes.com/chinas-explosive-history-gunpowder-and-fireworks |title=China's explosive history of gunpowder and fireworks |last=Sigur\u00f0sson |first=Albert |date=January 17, 2017 |website=GBTimes |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033748/https://gbtimes.com/chinas-explosive-history-gunpowder-and-fireworks |archivedate=1 December 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the process, they stumbled upon the explosive invention of gunpowder made from coal, saltpeter, and sulfur in 1044.

This material was sensitive to water, and it produced copious amounts of dark smoke. The first useful explosive stronger than black powder was [[nitroglycerin]], developed in 1847. Since nitroglycerin is a liquid and highly unstable, it was replaced by [[nitrocellulose]], trinitrotoluene ([[TNT]]) in 1863, [[smokeless powder]], [[dynamite]] in 1867 and [[gelignite]] (the latter two being sophisticated stabilized preparations of nitroglycerin rather than chemical alternatives, both invented by [[Alfred Nobel]]). World War I saw the adoption of TNT in artillery shells. World War II saw an extensive use of new explosives (see [[List of explosives used during World War II]]). In turn, these have largely been replaced by more powerful explosives such as [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] and [[PETN]]. However, C-4 and PETN react with metal and catch fire easily, yet unlike TNT, C-4 and PETN are waterproof and malleable.<ref name=ankony1>Ankony, Robert C., ''Lurps: A Ranger's Diary of Tet, Khe Sanh, A Shau, and Quang Tri,'' revised ed., Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group, Lanham, MD (2009), p.73.</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Blast Area Security.webm|thumb|A video on safety precautions at blast sites]]\n\n===Commercial===\n[[File:Handling Explosives in Underground Mines.webm|thumb|A video describing how to safely handle explosives in mines.]]\n\nThe largest commercial application of explosives is [[mining]]. Whether the mine is on the surface or is buried underground, the detonation or deflagration of either a high or low explosive in a confined space can be used to liberate a fairly specific sub-volume of a brittle material in a much larger volume of the same or similar material. The mining industry tends to use nitrate-based explosives such as [http://www.idealexplosives.com/emulsion-explosives.html emulsions of fuel oil and ammonium nitrate solutions], mixtures of ammonium nitrate prills (fertilizer pellets) and fuel oil ([[ANFO]]) and [http://www.idealexplosives.com/slurry-explosives.html gelatinous suspensions or slurries] of ammonium nitrate and combustible fuels.\n\nIn Materials Science and Engineering, explosives are used in [[Cladding (metalworking)|cladding]] ([[explosion welding]]). A thin plate of some material is placed atop a thick layer of a different material, both layers typically of metal. Atop the thin layer is placed an explosive. At one end of the layer of explosive, the explosion is initiated. The two metallic layers are forced together at high speed and with great force. The explosion spreads from the initiation site throughout the explosive. Ideally, this produces a metallurgical bond between the two layers.\n\nAs the length of time the shock wave spends at any point is small, we can see mixing of the two metals and their surface chemistries, through some fraction of the depth, and they tend to be mixed in some way. It is possible that some fraction of the surface material from either layer eventually gets ejected when the end of material is reached. Hence, the mass of the now \"welded\" bilayer, may be less than the sum of the masses of the two initial layers.\n\nThere are applications where a shock wave, and electrostatics, can result in high velocity projectiles.\n\n===Military===\n{{Main|Explosive weapon}}\n\n===Civilian===\n{{See also|Explosives engineering}}\n\n===Safety===\n{{Main|Explosives safety}}\n\n==Types==\n\n===Chemical===\n{{Main|Chemical explosive}}\n[[File:GHS-pictogram-explos.svg|thumb|The [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals|international]] [[pictogram]] for explosive substances]]\n\nAn explosion is a type of spontaneous chemical reaction that, once initiated, is driven by both a large exothermic change (great release of heat) and a large positive [[entropy]] change (great quantities of gases are released) in going from reactants to products, thereby constituting a thermodynamically favorable process in addition to one that propagates very rapidly. Thus, explosives are substances that contain a large amount of energy stored in [[chemical bond]]s. The energetic stability of the gaseous products and hence their generation comes from the formation of strongly bonded species like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and (di)nitrogen, which contain strong double and triple bonds having bond strengths of nearly 1 MJ/mole. Consequently, most commercial explosives are organic compounds containing [[nitro compound|-NO<sub>2</sub>]], [[nitrate|-ONO<sub>2</sub>]] and [[nitroamine|-NHNO<sub>2</sub>]] groups that, when detonated, release gases like the aforementioned (e.g., [[nitroglycerin]], [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], [[HMX]], [[PETN]], [[nitrocellulose]]).<ref>W. W. Porterfield, ''Inorganic Chemistry: A Unified Approach'', 2nd ed., Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, pp. 479-480 (1993).</ref>\n\nAn explosive is classified as a low or high explosive according to its rate of [[combustion]]: low explosives burn rapidly (or [[deflagration|deflagrate]]), while high explosives [[detonation|detonate]]. While these definitions are distinct, the problem of precisely measuring rapid decomposition makes practical classification of explosives difficult.\n\nTraditional explosives mechanics is based on the shock-sensitive rapid oxidation of carbon and hydrogen to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water in the form of steam. [[Nitrate]]s typically provide the required oxygen to burn the carbon and hydrogen fuel. High explosives tend to have the oxygen, carbon and hydrogen contained in one organic molecule, and less sensitive explosives like ANFO are combinations of fuel (carbon and hydrogen fuel oil) and [[ammonium nitrate]]. A sensitizer such as powdered aluminum may be added to an explosive to increase the energy of the detonation. Once detonated, the nitrogen portion of the explosive formulation emerges as nitrogen gas and toxic [[NOx|nitric oxides]].\n\n====Decomposition====\nThe [[chemical decomposition]] of an explosive may take years, days, hours, or a fraction of a second. The slower processes of decomposition take place in storage and are of interest only from a stability standpoint. Of more interest are the other two rapid forms besides decomposition: deflagration and detonation.\n\n====Deflagration====\n{{Main|Deflagration}}\nIn deflagration, decomposition of the explosive material is propagated by a flame front which moves slowly through the explosive material at speeds less than the speed of sound within the substance (usually below 1000&nbsp;m/s) <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chem-page.de/publikationen/geschichte-der-sprengstoffe/195-2-wie-unterscheiden-sich-deflagration-detonation-und-explosion.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206104750/http://www.chem-page.de/publikationen/geschichte-der-sprengstoffe/195-2-wie-unterscheiden-sich-deflagration-detonation-und-explosion.html |archivedate=6 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}} |2.1 Deflagration |Retrieved 05 February 2017</ref> in contrast to detonation, which occurs at speeds greater than the speed of sound. Deflagration is a characteristic of [[low explosive]] material.\n\n====Detonation====\n{{Main|Detonation}}\nThis term is used to describe an explosive phenomenon whereby the decomposition is [[wave propagation|propagated]] by an explosive [[shock wave]] traversing the explosive material at speeds greater than the speed of sound within the substance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chem-page.de/publikationen/geschichte-der-sprengstoffe/195-2-wie-unterscheiden-sich-deflagration-detonation-und-explosion.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206104750/http://www.chem-page.de/publikationen/geschichte-der-sprengstoffe/195-2-wie-unterscheiden-sich-deflagration-detonation-und-explosion.html |archivedate=6 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}} |2.2 Detonation |Retrieved 05 February 2017</ref> The shock front is capable of passing through the high explosive material at supersonic speeds, typically thousands of metres per second.\n\n===Exotic===\nIn addition to chemical explosives, there are a number of more exotic explosive materials, and exotic methods of causing explosions. Examples include [[nuclear explosive]]s, and abruptly heating a substance to a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] state with a high-intensity [[laser]] or [[electric arc]].\n\nLaser- and arc-heating are used in laser detonators, [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s, and [[slapper detonator|exploding foil initiators]], where a shock wave and then detonation in conventional chemical explosive material is created by laser- or electric-arc heating. Laser and electric energy are not currently used in practice to generate most of the required energy, but only to initiate reactions.\n\n==Properties of explosive materials==\nTo determine the suitability of an explosive substance for a particular use, its [[physics|physical]] [[properties]] must first be known. The usefulness of an explosive can only be appreciated when the properties and the factors affecting them are fully understood. Some of the more important characteristics are listed below:\n\n===Sensitivity===\n{{Main|Sensitivity (explosives)}}\nSensitivity refers to the ease with which an explosive can be ignited or detonated, i.e., the amount and intensity of [[electric shock|shock]], [[friction]], or [[heat]] that is required. When the term [[wikt:Sensitivity|sensitivity]] is used, care must be taken to clarify what kind of sensitivity is under discussion. The relative sensitivity of a given explosive to impact may vary greatly from its sensitivity to friction or heat. Some of the test methods used to determine sensitivity relate to:\n*'''[[Impact (mechanics)|Impact]]''' \u2014 Sensitivity is expressed in terms of the distance through which a standard weight must be dropped onto the material to cause it to explode.\n*'''[[Friction]]''' \u2014 Sensitivity is expressed in terms of what occurs when a weighted pendulum scrapes across the material (it may snap, crackle, ignite, and/or explode).\n*'''[[Heat]]''' \u2014 Sensitivity is expressed in terms of the temperature at which flashing or explosion of the material occurs.\n\nSpecific explosives (usually but not always highly sensitive on one or more of the three above axes) may be idiosyncratically sensitive to such factors as pressure drop, acceleration, the presence of sharp edges or rough surfaces, incompatible materials, or even\u2014in rare cases\u2014nuclear or electromagnetic radiation. These factors present special hazards that may rule out any practical utility.\n\nSensitivity is an important consideration in selecting an explosive for a particular purpose. The explosive in an armor-piercing projectile must be relatively insensitive, or the shock of impact would cause it to detonate before it penetrated to the point desired. The explosive lenses around nuclear charges are also designed to be highly insensitive, to minimize the risk of accidental detonation.\n\n===Sensitivity to initiation===\nThe index of the capacity of an explosive to be initiated into detonation in a sustained manner. It is defined by the power of the detonator which is certain to prime the explosive to a sustained and continuous detonation. Reference is made to the [[Sellier-Bellot]] scale that consists of a series of 10 detonators, from n. 1 to n. 10, each of which corresponds to an increasing charge weight. In practice, most of the explosives on the market today are sensitive to an n. 8 detonator, where the charge corresponds to 2&nbsp;grams of [[mercury fulminate]].\n\n===Velocity of detonation===\nThe velocity with which the reaction process propagates in the mass of the explosive. Most commercial mining explosives have detonation velocities ranging from 1800&nbsp;m/s to 8000&nbsp;m/s. Today, velocity of detonation can be measured with accuracy. Together with density it is an important element influencing the yield of the energy transmitted for both atmospheric over-pressure and ground acceleration. By definition, a \"low explosive,\" such as black powder, or smokeless gunpowder has a burn rate of 171\u2013631&nbsp;m/s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PmuqCHDC3pwC&pg=PA106&lpg=PA106&dq=speed+of+blackpowder+explosion+m/s&source=bl&ots=ocMDie-r0f&sig=GYtyVdH_c1nsO2gjB4Kps6KGj1g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjos8vqsuLPAhVF0YMKHRTjC7cQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&q=speed%20of%20blackpowder%20explosion%20m/s&f=false|title=History of Shock Waves, Explosions and Impact: A Chronological and Biographical Reference|last=Krehl|first=Peter O.

In the strictest technical sense, the word \"stability\" is a thermodynamic term referring to the energy of a substance relative to a reference state or to some other substance.<!--vague, needs better def--> However, in the context of explosives, stability commonly refers to ease of detonation, which is concerned with [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] (i.e., rate of decomposition). It is perhaps best, then, to differentiate between the terms thermodynamically stable and kinetically stable by referring to the former as \"inert.\" Contrarily, a kinetically unstable substance is said to be \"labile.\" It is generally recognized that certain groups like nitro (\u2013NO<sub>2</sub>), [[nitrate]] (\u2013ONO<sub>2</sub>), and [[azide]] (\u2013N<sub>3</sub>), are intrinsically labile. Kinetically, there exists a low activation barrier to the decomposition reaction. Consequently, these compounds exhibit high sensitivity to flame or mechanical shock. The chemical bonding in these compounds is characterized as predominantly covalent and thus they are not thermodynamically stabilized by a high ionic-lattice energy. Furthermore, they generally have positive enthalpies of formation and there is little mechanistic hindrance to internal molecular rearrangement to yield the more thermodynamically stable (more strongly bonded) decomposition products. For example, in [[lead azide]], Pb(N<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, the nitrogen atoms are already bonded to one another, so decomposition into Pb and N<sub>2</sub><sup>[1]</sup> is relatively easy.\n*'''[[Temperature]] of storage.''' The rate of decomposition of explosives increases at higher temperatures. All standard military explosives may be considered to have a high degree of stability at temperatures from \u201310 to +35&nbsp;\u00b0C, but each has a high temperature at which its rate of [[thermal decomposition|decomposition]] rapidly accelerates and stability is reduced. As a rule of thumb, most explosives become dangerously unstable at temperatures above 70&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n*'''Exposure to [[sunlight]].''' When exposed to the [[ultraviolet]] rays of sunlight, many explosive compounds containing [[nitrogen]] groups rapidly decompose, affecting their stability.\n*'''[[Electrical discharge]].''' [[Electrostatic discharge|Electrostatic]] or [[electric spark|spark]] sensitivity to initiation is common in a number of explosives. Static or other electrical discharge may be sufficient to cause a reaction, even detonation, under some circumstances. As a result, safe handling of explosives and [[pyrotechnics]] usually requires proper [[ground (electricity)|electrical grounding]] of the operator.\n\n===Power, performance, and strength===\n{{Main|Power (physics)|Strength (explosive)}}\nThe term '''power''' or '''performance''' as applied to an explosive refers to its ability to do work. In practice it is defined as the explosive's ability to accomplish what is intended in the way of energy delivery (i.e., fragment projection, air blast, high-velocity jet, underwater shock and bubble energy, etc.). Explosive power or performance is evaluated by a tailored series of tests to assess the material for its intended use. Of the tests listed below, cylinder expansion and air-blast tests are common to most testing programs, and the others support specific applications.\n*'''Cylinder expansion test.''' A standard amount of explosive is loaded into a long hollow [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], usually of copper, and detonated at one end. Data is collected concerning the rate of radial expansion of the cylinder and the maximum cylinder wall velocity. This also establishes the [[Gurney equations|Gurney energy]] or 2''E''.\n*'''Cylinder fragmentation.''' A standard steel cylinder is loaded with explosive and detonated in a sawdust pit. The [[fragmentation (weaponry)|fragments]] are collected and the size distribution analyzed.\n*'''Detonation pressure ([[Chapman\u2013Jouguet condition]]).''' [[Detonation]] pressure data derived from measurements of shock waves transmitted into water by the detonation of cylindrical explosive charges of a standard size.\n*'''Determination of critical diameter.''' This test establishes the minimum physical size a charge of a specific explosive must be to sustain its own detonation wave. The procedure involves the detonation of a series of charges of different diameters until difficulty in detonation wave propagation is observed.\n*'''Massive-diameter detonation velocity.''' Detonation velocity is dependent on loading density (c), charge diameter, and grain size. The hydrodynamic theory of detonation used in predicting explosive phenomena does not include the diameter of the charge, and therefore a detonation velocity, for a massive diameter. This procedure requires the firing of a series of charges of the same density and physical structure, but different diameters, and the extrapolation of the resulting detonation velocities to predict the detonation velocity of a charge of a massive diameter.\n*'''Pressure versus scaled distance.''' A charge of a specific size is detonated and its pressure effects measured at a standard distance. The values obtained are compared with those for TNT.\n*'''Impulse versus scaled distance.''' A charge of a specific size is detonated and its impulse (the area under the pressure-time curve) measured as a function of distance. The results are tabulated and expressed as TNT equivalents.\n*'''Relative bubble energy (RBE).''' A 5 to 50&nbsp;kg charge is detonated in water and piezoelectric gauges measure peak pressure, time constant, impulse, and energy.\n::The RBE may be defined as ''K''<sub>''x''</sub> 3\n::RBE = ''K''<sub>''s''</sub>\n::where ''K'' = the bubble expansion period for an experimental (''x'') or a standard (''s'') charge.\n\n===Brisance===\n{{Main|Brisance}}\nIn addition to strength, explosives display a second characteristic, which is their shattering effect or brisance (from the French meaning to \"break\"), which is distinguished and separate from their total work capacity. This characteristic is of practical importance in determining the effectiveness of an explosion in fragmenting shells, bomb casings, [[grenade]]s, and the like. The rapidity with which an explosive reaches its peak pressure ([[power (physics)|power]]) is a measure of its brisance. Brisance values are primarily employed in France and Russia.\n\nThe sand crush test is commonly employed to determine the relative brisance in comparison to TNT. No test is capable of directly comparing the explosive properties of two or more compounds; it is important to examine the data from several such tests (sand crush, [[trauzl lead block test|trauzl]], and so forth) in order to gauge relative brisance. True values for comparison require field experiments.\n\n===Density===\n[[Density]] of loading refers to the mass of an explosive per unit volume. Several methods of loading are available, including pellet loading, cast loading, and press loading, the choice being determined by the characteristics of the explosive. Dependent upon the method employed, an average density of the loaded charge can be obtained that is within 80\u201399% of the theoretical maximum density of the explosive. High load density can reduce [[sensitivity (explosives)|sensitivity]] by making the [[mass]] more resistant to internal [[friction]]. However, if density is increased to the extent that individual [[crystal]]s are crushed, the explosive may become more sensitive. Increased load density also permits the use of more explosive, thereby increasing the power of the [[warhead]]. It is possible to compress an explosive beyond a point of sensitivity, known also as ''dead-pressing'', in which the material is no longer capable of being reliably initiated, if at all.\n\n===Volatility===\n[[Volatility (chemistry)|Volatility]] is the readiness with which a substance [[vaporization|vaporizes]]. Excessive volatility often results in the development of pressure within rounds of ammunition and separation of mixtures into their constituents. Volatility affects the chemical composition of the explosive such that a marked reduction in stability may occur, which results in an increase in the danger of handling.\n\n===Hygroscopicity and water resistance===\nThe introduction of [[water]] into an explosive is highly undesirable since it reduces the sensitivity, strength, and velocity of detonation of the explosive. [[Hygroscopicity]] is a measure of a material's moisture-absorbing tendencies. Moisture affects explosives adversely by acting as an inert material that absorbs heat when vaporized, and by acting as a solvent medium that can cause undesired chemical reactions. Sensitivity, strength, and velocity of detonation are reduced by inert materials that reduce the continuity of the explosive mass. When the moisture content evaporates during detonation, cooling occurs, which reduces the temperature of reaction. Stability is also affected by the presence of moisture since moisture promotes decomposition of the explosive and, in addition, causes corrosion of the explosive's metal container.\n\nExplosives considerably differ from one another as to their behavior in the presence of water. Gelatin dynamites containing nitroglycerine have a degree of water resistance. Explosives based on [[ammonium nitrate]] have little or no water resistance as ammonium nitrate is highly soluble in water and is hygroscopic.\n\n===Toxicity===\nMany explosives are [[toxicity|toxic]] to some extent. Manufacturing inputs can also be organic compounds or hazardous materials that require special handing due to risks (such as [[carcinogen]]s). The decomposition products, residual solids, or gases of some explosives can be toxic, whereas others are harmless, such as carbon dioxide and water.\n\nExamples of harmful by-products are:\n*Heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, and barium from primers (observed in high-volume firing ranges)\n*Nitric oxides from TNT\n*Perchlorates when used in large quantities\n\n\"Green explosives\" seek to reduce environment and health impacts. An example of such is the lead-free primary explosive copper(I) 5-nitrotetrazolate, an alternative to [[lead azide]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8903-green-explosive-is-a-friend-of-the-earth.html |title=Green explosive is a friend of the Earth |publisher=New Scientist |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=12 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112220348/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8903-green-explosive-is-a-friend-of-the-earth.html |archivedate=12 November 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> One variety of a green explosive is CDP explosives, whose synthesis does not involve any toxic ingredients, consumes carbon dioxide while detonating and does not release any nitric oxides into the atmosphere when used.\n\n===Explosive train===\n{{Main|Explosive train}}\nExplosive material may be incorporated in the [[explosive train]] of a device or system. An example is a pyrotechnic lead igniting a booster, which causes the main charge to detonate.\n\n===Volume of products of explosion===\nThe most widely used explosives are condensed liquids or solids converted to gaseous products by explosive chemical reactions and the energy released by those reactions. The gaseous products of complete reaction are typically [[carbon dioxide]], [[steam]], and [[nitrogen]].<ref name=\"z&k\">{{cite book |title=Theory of Detonation |last=Zel'dovich |first=Yakov |authorlink=Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich|first2=A.S. |last2=Kompaneets |authorlink2= |publisher=Academic Press |year=1960|isbn= |pages=208\u2013210}}</ref> Gaseous volumes computed by the [[ideal gas law]] tend to be too large at high pressures characteristic of explosions.<ref>{{cite book |title=Chemical Process Principles |last=Hougen |first=Olaf A. |authorlink= |first2=Kenneth |last2=Watson |authorlink2= |first3=Roland |last3=Ragatz |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=1954|isbn= |pages=66\u201367}}</ref> Ultimate volume expansion may be estimated at three orders of magnitude, or one liter per gram of explosive.

Rather than produce typical waste gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen and nitric oxides, CDP is different. Instead, the highly energetic reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon vaporizes and pressurizes excess dry ice at the wave front, which is the only gas released from the detonation. The velocity of detonation for CDP formulations can therefore be customized by adjusting the weight percentage of reducing agent and dry ice. CDP detonations produce a large amount of solid materials that can have great commercial value as an abrasive:\n\nExample \u2013 CDP Detonation Reaction with Magnesium: XCO<sub>2</sub> + 2Mg \u2192 2MgO + C + (X-1)CO<sub>2</sub>\n\nThe products of detonation in this example are magnesium oxide, carbon in various phases including diamond, and vaporized excess carbon dioxide that was not consumed by the amount of magnesium in the explosive formulation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2710026/summary.html|title=Canadian Patent Database / Base de donn\u00e9es sur les brevets canadiens|last=Office|first=Government of Canada, Industry Canada, Office of the Deputy Minister, Canadian Intellectual Property|website=brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2016-10-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018221400/http://brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2710026/summary.html|archivedate=18 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Oxygen balance (OB% or ''\u03a9'')===\n{{Main|Oxygen balance}}\n[[Oxygen balance]] is an expression that is used to indicate the degree to which an explosive can be oxidized. If an explosive molecule contains just enough oxygen to convert all of its carbon to carbon dioxide, all of its hydrogen to water, and all of its metal to metal oxide with no excess, the molecule is said to have a zero oxygen balance. The molecule is said to have a positive oxygen balance if it contains more oxygen than is needed and a negative oxygen balance if it contains less oxygen than is needed.<ref>{{cite book |last= Meyer |first= Rudolf |author2=Josef K\u00f6hler|author3=Axel Homburg |title= Explosives, 6th Ed. |publisher= Wiley VCH |year= 2007 |isbn= 3-527-31656-6}}</ref> The sensitivity, [[strength (explosive)|strength]], and [[brisance]] of an explosive are all somewhat dependent upon oxygen balance and tend to approach their maxima as oxygen balance approaches zero.\n\nOxygen balance applies to traditional explosives mechanics with the assumption that carbon is oxidized to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide during detonation. In what seems like a paradox to an explosives expert, Cold Detonation Physics uses carbon in its most highly oxidized state as the source of oxygen in the form of carbon dioxide. Oxygen balance, therefore, either does not apply to a CDP formulation or must be calculated without including the carbon in the carbon dioxide.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n===Chemical composition===\nA chemical explosive may consist of either a chemically pure compound, such as [[nitroglycerin]], or a mixture of a [[fuel]] and an [[oxidizer]], such as [[black powder]] or [[grain dust]] and air.\n\n====Chemically pure compounds====\nSome chemical compounds are unstable in that, when shocked, they react, possibly to the point of detonation.

For example, [[dynamite]] is a mixture of highly sensitive nitroglycerin with [[sawdust]], powdered [[silica]], or most commonly [[diatomaceous earth]], which act as stabilizers. Plastics and polymers may be added to bind powders of explosive compounds; waxes may be incorporated to make them safer to handle; [[aluminium]] powder may be introduced to increase total energy and blast effects.

Some primary explosives are also known as [[contact explosive]]s. A relatively small amount of energy is required for [[initiation (chemistry)|initiation]]. As a very general rule, primary explosives are considered to be those compounds that are more sensitive than [[PETN]]. As a practical measure, primary explosives are sufficiently sensitive that they can be reliably initiated with a blow from a hammer; however, PETN can also usually be initiated in this manner, so this is only a very broad guideline. Additionally, several compounds, such as [[nitrogen triiodide]], are so sensitive that they cannot even be handled without detonating. Nitrogen triiodide is so sensitive that it can be reliably detonated by exposure to [[Alpha particle|alpha radiation]]; it is the only explosive for which this is true. {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nPrimary explosives are often used in [[detonator]]s or to [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]] larger charges of less sensitive [[secondary explosives]]. Primary explosives are commonly used in [[blasting cap]]s and [[percussion cap]]s to translate a physical shock signal. In other situations, different signals such as electrical or physical shock, or, in the case of laser detonation systems, light, are used to initiate an action, i.e., an explosion. A small quantity, usually milligrams, is sufficient to initiate a larger charge of explosive that is usually safer to handle.\n\nExamples of primary high explosives are:\n{{Div col|colwidth=17em}}\n*[[Acetone peroxide]]\n*Alkali metal [[ozonide]]s\n*[[Ammonium permanganate]]\n*[[Ammonium chlorate]]\n*Azidotetrazolates\n*Azoclathrates\n*[[Benzoyl peroxide]]\n*[[Benzvalene]]\n*[[Chlorine oxide]]s\n*[[Copper(I) acetylide]]\n*[[Copper(II) azide]]\n*[[Cumene hydroperoxide]]\n*CXP CycloProp(-2-)enyl Nitrate (or CPN)\n*[[Cyanogen azide]]\n*[[Cyanuric triazide]]\n*[[Diacetyl peroxide]]\n*[[c:File:C2N14.png|1-Diazidocarbamoyl-5-azidotetrazole]]\n*[[Diazodinitrophenol]]\n*[[Diazomethane]]\n*[[Diethyl ether peroxide]]\n*[[4-Dimethylaminophenylpentazole]]\n*[[Disulfur dinitride]]\n*[[Ethyl azide]]\n*[[Explosive antimony]]\n*[[Fluorine perchlorate]]\n*[[Fulminic acid]]\n*Halogen azides:\n**[[Fluorine azide]]\n**[[Chlorine azide]]\n**[[Bromine azide]]\n*[[Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine]]\n*[[Hydrazoic acid]]\n*[[Hypofluorous acid]]\n*[[Lead azide]]\n*[[Lead styphnate]]\n*[[Lead picrate]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powerlabs.org/chemlabs/lead_picrate.htm|title=PowerLabs Lead Picrate Synthesis|author=Sam Barros|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522174456/http://www.powerlabs.org/chemlabs/lead_picrate.htm|archivedate=22 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n*[[Manganese heptoxide]]\n*[[Mercury(II) fulminate]]\n*[[Mercury nitride]]\n*[[Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide]]\n*[[Nickel hydrazine nitrate]]<ref>Robert Maty\u00e1\u0161, Ji\u0159\u00ed Pachman.

Because they are less sensitive, they are usable in a wider variety of applications and are safer to handle and store. Secondary explosives are used in larger quantities in an explosive train and are usually initiated by a smaller quantity of a primary explosive.\n\nExamples of secondary explosives include [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] and [[RDX]].\n\n====Tertiary explosive====\n'''Tertiary explosives''', also called '''blasting agents''', are so insensitive to shock that they cannot be reliably detonated by practical quantities of [[primary explosive]], and instead require an intermediate [[explosive booster]] of [[secondary explosive]]. These are often used for safety and the typically lower costs of material and handling. The largest consumers are large-scale [[mining]] and [[construction]] operations.\n\nMost tertiaries include a fuel and an oxidizer. [[ANFO]] can be a tertiary explosive if its reaction rate is slow.\n\n===By velocity===\n\n====Low explosives====\nLow explosives are compounds where the rate of decomposition proceeds through the material at less than the [[speed of sound]]. The decomposition is propagated by a flame front ([[deflagration]]) which travels much more slowly through the explosive material than a [[shock wave]] of a [[high explosive]]. [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|Under normal conditions]], low explosives undergo [[deflagration]] at rates that vary from a few centimetres per second to approximately 400 metres per second. It is possible for them to deflagrate very quickly, producing an effect similar to a [[detonation]]. This can happen under higher [[pressure]] or [[temperature]], which usually occurs when ignited in a confined space.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nA low explosive is usually a mixture of a [[combustible]] substance and an [[oxidant]] that decomposes rapidly (deflagration); however, they burn more slowly than a [[high explosive]], which has an extremely fast burn rate.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nLow explosives are normally employed as [[propellant]]s. Included in this group are petroleum products such as [[propane]] and [[gasoline]], [[gunpowder]] (including [[smokeless powder]]), and light [[pyrotechnics]], such as [[flare]]s and [[fireworks]], but can replace high explosives in certain applications, see gas pressure blasting.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n====High explosives====\nHigh explosives (HE) are explosive materials that [[detonate]], meaning that the [[explosion|explosive]] [[shock front]] passes through the material at a [[supersonic]] speed. High explosives detonate with [[explosive velocity]] ranging from 3 to 9&nbsp;km/s. For instance, TNT has a detonation (burn) rate of approximately 5.8&nbsp;km/s (19,000 feet per second), Detonating cord of 6.7&nbsp;km/s (22,000 feet per second), and C-4 about 8.5&nbsp;km/s (29,000 feet per second). They are normally employed in mining, demolition, and military applications. They can be divided into two explosives classes differentiated by [[sensitivity (explosives)|sensitivity]]: [[primary explosive]] and [[secondary explosive]]. The term ''high explosive'' is in contrast with the term ''low explosive'', which explodes ([[Deflagration|deflagrates]]) at a lower rate.\n\nCountless high-explosive compounds are chemically possible, but commercially and militarily important ones have included [[nitroglycerin|NG]], [[TNT]], TNX, [[RDX]], [[HMX]], [[pentaerythritol tetranitrate|PETN]], [[TATB]], and [[hexanitrostilbene|HNS]].\n\n===By composition===\n\n====Priming composition====\nPriming compositions are primary explosives mixed with other compositions to control (lessen) the sensitivity of the mixture to the desired property.\n\nFor example, [[primary explosive]]s are so sensitive that they need to be stored and shipped in a wet state to prevent accidental initiation.\n\n===By physical form===\n{{Main|Use forms of explosives}}\nExplosives are often characterized by the physical form that the explosives are produced or used in. These use forms are commonly categorized as:<ref name=\"Cooper\">{{cite book\n|last=Cooper\n|first=Paul W.\n|title=Explosives Engineering\n|year=1996\n|publisher=Wiley-VCH\n|pages=51\u201366\n|chapter=Chapter 4: Use forms of explosives\n|isbn=0-471-18636-8}}</ref>\n*Pressings\n*Castings\n*[[Polymer-bonded explosive|Plastic or polymer bonded]]\n*[[Plastic explosives|Putties]] (AKA [[plastic explosives]])\n*Rubberized\n*Extrudable\n*Binary\n*Blasting agents\n*Slurries and gels\n*Dynamites\n\n===Shipping label classifications===\nShipping labels and tags may include both [[United Nations]] and national markings.\n\nUnited Nations markings include numbered Hazard Class and Division (HC/D) codes and alphabetic Compatibility Group codes. Though the two are related, they are separate and distinct. Any Compatibility Group designator can be assigned to any Hazard Class and Division. An example of this hybrid marking would be a consumer [[firework]], which is labeled as 1.4G or 1.4S.\n\nExamples of national markings would include [[United States Department of Transportation]] (U.S. DOT) codes.\n\n====United Nations Organization (UNO) Hazard Class and Division (HC/D)====\n[[File:Dangclass1.svg|thumb|Explosives warning sign]]\n{{See also|HAZMAT Class 1 Explosives}}\n\nThe Hazard Class and Division (HC/D) is a numeric designator within a hazard class indicating the character, predominance of associated hazards, and potential for causing personnel casualties and property damage. It is an internationally accepted system that communicates using the minimum amount of markings the primary hazard associated with a substance.<ref>[http://www.tpub.com/content/aviation/14313/css/14313_288.htm Table 12-4.\u2014United Nations Organization Hazard Classes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605034021/http://www.tpub.com/content/aviation/14313/css/14313_288.htm |date=5 June 2010}}. Tpub.com. Retrieved on 2010-02-11.</ref>\n\nListed below are the Divisions for Class 1 (Explosives):\n*'''1.1''' Mass Detonation Hazard. With HC/D 1.1, it is expected that if one item in a container or pallet inadvertently detonates, the explosion will [[sympathetic detonation|sympathetically detonate]] the surrounding items. The explosion could propagate to all or the majority of the items stored together, causing a mass detonation. There will also be fragments from the item's casing and/or structures in the blast area.\n*'''1.2''' Non-mass explosion, fragment-producing. HC/D 1.2 is further divided into three subdivisions, HC/D 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3, to account for the magnitude of the effects of an explosion.\n*'''1.3''' Mass fire, minor blast or fragment hazard. Propellants and many pyrotechnic items fall into this category. If one item in a package or stack initiates, it will usually propagate to the other items, creating a mass fire.\n*'''1.4''' Moderate fire, no blast or fragment. HC/D 1.4 items are listed in the table as explosives with no significant hazard. Most small arms ammunition (including loaded weapons) and some pyrotechnic items fall into this category. If the energetic material in these items inadvertently initiates, most of the energy and fragments will be contained within the storage structure or the item containers themselves.\n*'''1.5''' mass detonation hazard, very insensitive.\n*'''1.6''' [[detonation]] hazard without mass detonation hazard, extremely insensitive.\n\nTo see an entire UNO Table, browse Paragraphs 3-8 and 3-9 of NAVSEA OP 5, Vol. 1, Chapter 3.\n\n====Class 1 Compatibility Group====\nCompatibility Group codes are used to indicate storage compatibility for HC/D Class 1 (explosive) materials. Letters are used to designate 13 compatibility groups as follows.\n\n*'''A''': Primary explosive substance (1.1A).\n*'''B''': An article containing a primary explosive substance and not containing two or more effective protective features. Some articles, such as detonator assemblies for blasting and primers, cap-type, are included. (1.1B, 1.2B, 1.4B).\n*'''C''': Propellant explosive substance or other deflagrating explosive substance or article containing such explosive substance (1.1C, 1.2C, 1.3C, 1.4C). These are bulk [[propellant]]s, propelling charges, and devices containing propellants with or without means of ignition. Examples include single-based propellant, double-based propellant, triple-based propellant, and [[composite propellant]]s, [[solid propellant]] [[rocket motor]]s and ammunition with inert projectiles.\n*'''D''': Secondary detonating explosive substance or black powder or article containing a secondary detonating explosive substance, in each case without means of initiation and without a propelling charge, or article containing a primary explosive substance and containing two or more effective protective features. (1.1D, 1.2D, 1.4D, 1.5D).\n*'''E''': Article containing a secondary detonating explosive substance without means of initiation, with a propelling charge (other than one containing flammable liquid, gel or [[hypergolic]] liquid) (1.1E, 1.2E, 1.4E).\n*'''F''' containing a [[secondary explosive|secondary]] [[detonating explosive]] substance with its means of initiation, with a propelling charge (other than one containing flammable liquid, gel or hypergolic liquid) or without a propelling charge (1.1F, 1.2F, 1.3F, 1.4F).\n*'''G''': Pyrotechnic substance or article containing a pyrotechnic substance, or article containing both an explosive substance and an illuminating, incendiary, tear-producing or smoke-producing substance (other than a water-activated article or one containing white phosphorus, phosphide or flammable liquid or gel or hypergolic liquid) (1.1G, 1.2G, 1.3G, 1.4G). Examples include Flares, signals, incendiary or illuminating ammunition and other smoke and tear producing devices.\n*'''H''': Article containing both an explosive substance and white phosphorus (1.2H, 1.3H). These articles will spontaneously combust when exposed to the atmosphere.\n*'''J''': Article containing both an explosive substance and flammable liquid or gel (1.1J, 1.2J, 1.3J). This excludes liquids or gels which are spontaneously flammable when exposed to water or the atmosphere, which belong in group H. Examples include liquid or gel filled incendiary ammunition, fuel-air explosive (FAE) devices, and flammable liquid fueled missiles.\n*'''K''': Article containing both an explosive substance and a toxic chemical agent (1.2K, 1.3K)\n*'''L''' Explosive substance or article containing an explosive substance and presenting a special risk (e.g., due to water-activation or presence of hypergolic liquids, phosphides, or pyrophoric substances) needing isolation of each type (1.1L, 1.2L, 1.3L). Damaged or suspect ammunition of any group belongs in this group.\n*'''N''': Articles containing only extremely insensitive detonating substances (1.6N).\n*'''S''': Substance or article so packed or designed that any hazardous effects arising from accidental functioning are limited to the extent that they do not significantly hinder or prohibit fire fighting or other emergency response efforts in the immediate vicinity of the package (1.4S).\n\n==Regulation==\nThe legality of possessing or using explosives varies by jurisdiction.

Lee is persuaded to attend a high-profile martial arts competition on Han's private island in order to gather evidence that will prove Han's involvement in drug trafficking and prostitution. Shortly before his departure, Lee also learns that his sister's killer, O'Hara, is working as Han's bodyguard on the island. Also fighting in the competition are the indebted gambling addict Roper and fellow Vietnam war veteran Williams.\n\nAt the end of the first day, Han gives strict orders to the competitors not to leave their rooms. Lee makes contact with undercover operative Mei Ling and sneaks into Han's compound, looking for evidence. He is discovered by several guards but manages to escape. The next morning, Han orders his giant guard Bolo to kill the guards in public for failing their duties. After the execution, Lee faces O'Hara in the competition and ends up killing him. With the day's competition over, Han confronts Williams, who had also left his room the previous night to exercise. Han believes Williams to be the intruder and beats him to death when he refuses to co-operate. Han then reveals his drug operation to Roper, hoping that he will join his organization. He also implicitly threatens to imprison Roper, along with all the other martial artists who joined Han's tournaments in the past, if Roper ever refuses. Despite being initially intrigued, Roper refuses after learning of Williams' fate.\n\nLee sneaks out again that night and manages to send a message to Braithwaite, but he is finally captured after a protracted battle with the guards. The next morning, Han arranges for Roper to fight Lee, but Roper refuses. As a punishment, Roper has to fight Bolo instead, whom he manages to overpower and kill after a grueling encounter. Enraged by the unexpected failure, Han commands his remaining men to kill Lee and Roper. Facing insurmountable odds, they are soon aided by the island's prisoners, who had been freed by Mei Ling. Han escapes and is pursued by Lee, who finally corners him in a hidden mirror room. The mirrors give Han an advantage, but Lee breaks all the room's mirrors to reveal Han's location, and eventually kills him. Lee returns outside to the main battle, which is now over. A bruised and bloodied Roper sits victorious while the military finally arrive to take control of the island.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Bruce Lee]] as Lee\n* [[John Saxon]] as Roper\n* [[Jim Kelly (martial artist)|Jim Kelly]] as Williams<ref>{{cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/10/entertainment/la-ca-secondlook10-2010jan10/2|title= DVD set is devoted to '70s martial arts star Jim Kelly |publisher= Los Angeles Times|date= 10 January 2010|accessdate=28 January 2011 | first=Steve | last=Ryfle}}</ref>\n* [[Ahna Capri]] as Tania<ref>{{cite news |title=Car Accident Claims Ahna Capri |publisher=[[Inside Kung Fu]] |date= |url=http://www.insidekung-fu.com/content/view/212/37/ |accessdate=10 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311115341/http://www.insidekung-fu.com/content/view/212/37 |archivedate=11 March 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n* [[Shih Kien]] as Han (voice dubbed by [[Keye Luke]])<ref>{{cite news|title= Lee's Dragon co-star dies at 96 |work= [[BBC]]|date=5 June 2009|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8085659.stm|accessdate=31 January 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Robert Wall]] as O'Hara (as Bob Wall)<ref>{{cite news|title= Bob Wall Interview: \"Pulling No Punches\"|publisher= [[Black Belt Magazine|Black Belt]]|date=|url= http://www.blackbeltmag.com/archives/564|accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Angela Mao]] as Su Lin, Lee's sister (as Angela Mao Ying) \n* [[Betty Chung]] as Mei Ling\n* [[Geoffrey Weeks]] as Braithwaite\n* [[Bolo Yeung]] as Bolo (as Yang Sze)\n* [[Peter Archer (actor)|Peter Archer]] as Parsons\n* Ho Lee Yan as Old Man \n* [[Marlene Clark]] as Secretary\n* Allan Kent as Golfer\n* William Keller as L.A.

Its etymology stems from the Greek prefix ''\u03ad\u03be\u03c9'' (ex\u014d, which means \"outwards\") and the Greek word ''\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2'' (thermik\u03ccs, which means \"thermal\").<ref>[http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/lexica/search.html?lq=%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82&dq= \"Gate for the Greek language\" on-line dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205235500/http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/lexica/search.html?lq=%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82&dq= |date=2017-12-05 }}. greek-language.gr</ref> The term ''exothermic'' was first coined by [[Marcellin Berthelot]]. The opposite of an exothermic process is an [[endothermic]] process, one that absorbs energy in the form of heat.\n\nThe concept is frequently applied in the [[Outline of physical science|physical sciences]] to [[chemical reaction]]s, where as in chemical [[bond energy]] that will be converted to [[thermal energy]] (heat).\n\nExothermic (and endothermic) describe two types of chemical reactions or systems found in nature, as follows.\n\nSimply stated, after an [[exothermic reaction]], more energy has been released to the surroundings than was absorbed to initiate and maintain the reaction. An example would be the burning of a candle, wherein the sum of calories produced by combustion (found by looking at radiant heating of the surroundings and visible light produced, including increase in temperature of the fuel (wax) itself, which with oxygen, have become hot CO<sub>2</sub> and water vapor,) exceeds the number of calories absorbed initially in lighting the flame and in the flame maintaining itself. (i.e. some energy produced by combustion is reabsorbed and used in melting, then vaporizing the wax, etc. but is (far) outstripped by the energy produced in breaking carbon-hydrogen bonds and combination of oxygen with the resulting carbon and hydrogen).\n\nOn the other hand, in an [[Endothermic process|endothermic reaction]] or system, energy is taken from the surroundings in the course of the reaction. An example of an endothermic reaction is a first aid cold pack, in which the reaction of two chemicals, or dissolving of one in another, requires calories from the surroundings, and the reaction cools the pouch and surroundings by absorbing heat from them. An endothermic system is seen in the production of wood: trees absorb radiant energy, from the sun, use it in endothermic reactions such as taking apart CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O and combining the carbon and hydrogen generated to produce cellulose and other organic chemicals. These products, in the form of wood, say, may later be burned in a fireplace, exothermically, producing CO<sub>2</sub> and water, and releasing energy in the form of heat and light to their surroundings, e.g., to a home's interior and chimney gasses.\n\n==Overview==\nExothermic refers to a transformation in which a system releases energy (heat) to the surroundings, expressed by\n\n:''Q < 0''.\n\nWhen the transformation occurs at constant pressure, one has for the [[enthalpy]]{{what|date=March 2015}}\n\n:''\u2206H < 0'',\n\nand constant volume, one has for the internal energy{{what|date=March 2015}}{{dubious|date=March 2015}}\n\n:''\u2206U < 0''.\n\nIn an [[adiabatic]] system (i.e. a system that does not exchange heat with the surroundings), an exothermic process results in an increase in temperature of the system.<ref>{{cite book | last = Perrot | first = Pierre | title = A to Z of Thermodynamics | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-19-856552-6 }}</ref>\n\nIn exothermic chemical reactions, the heat that is released by the reaction takes the form of electromagnetic energy. The transition of electrons from one quantum energy level to another causes light to be released. This light is equivalent in energy to the stabilization energy of the energy for the chemical reaction, i.e. the bond energy. This light that is released can be absorbed by other molecules in solution to give rise to molecular vibrations or rotations, which gives rise to the classical understanding of heat. In contrast, when endothermic reactions occur, energy is absorbed to place an electron in a higher energy state, such that the electron can associate with another atom to form a chemical complex. Net energy is absorbed by an endothermic reaction. In an exothermic reaction, the energy needed to start the reaction is less than the energy that is subsequently released, so there is a net release of energy. This is the physical understanding of exothermic and endothermic reactions.\n\n==Examples==\n[[Image:ThermiteReaction.jpg|thumb|right|An exothermic [[thermite]] reaction using iron(III) oxide.

He then implemented an order dated 14 January 1685 which required the [[English colonial empire|English]] at Fort St George to make all attempts at procurement of the town of [[Santhome|St Thome]] on lease. To this effect, Chinna Venkatadri was sent to negotiate with the local governor on 4 August 1687. The mission was successful and Chinna Venkatadri assumed sovereignty over St Thome for a period of three years. Notwithstanding the vehement protests of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] inhabitants of St Thome, the English gained absolute control over all lands up to [[St Thomas Mount]] for a period of three years.\n\nIn  September 1688, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] [[Aurangazeb]] took [[Golconda]] after a prolonged battle. The Mughals took Sultan of Golconda prisoner and annexed the state. The newly designated Mughal [[Subedar]] of the province immediately sent a letter to the British authorities at Fort St George demanding that the English at Madras acknowledge the overlordship of the Mughal Emperor. The English complied willingly. Aurangazeb guaranteed the independence of Madras, but in return demanded that the English supply troops in the event of a war against the [[Marathas]]. It was around this time that Yale's three-year-old son David Yale died and was interred in the Madras cemetery.\n\nThe records of this period mention a flourishing slave trade in Madras, a trade in which Yale participated and from which he profited. He enforced a law that at least ten slaves should be carried on every ship bound for Europe. In his capacity as judge he also on several occasions sentenced so-called \"black criminals\" to whipping and enslavement. When the demand began to increase rapidly, the English merchants even began to kidnap young children and deport them to distant parts of the world, very much against their will. At a time when profits from the slave trade were dwindling and pressure from the Mughal government to stop the enslavement was mounting, the administration of Fort St George eventually stepped in and introduced laws to curb enslavement.<ref name=SLA>{{cite web|title=Elihu Yale Was a Slave Trader |url=http://histi3.commons.yale.edu/2014/11/01/elihu-yale-was-a-slave-trader/ |website=Digital Histories at Yale |accessdate=8 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108031612/http://histi3.commons.yale.edu/2014/11/01/elihu-yale-was-a-slave-trader/ |archivedate=8 November 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nDuring Yale's presidency, a plan for setting up a corporation in Madras was conceived by Josiah Child, the President of the Board of Directors of the [[East India Company]], in a letter addressed to the factors at Madras on 28 September 1687. Three months later, Josiah Child and his deputy had an audience with [[James II of England|James II]], and as per the ensuing discussions, a Charter was issued by the king on 30 December 1687 which established the Corporation of Madras. The charter came into effect on 29 September 1688, and a Corporation was established comprising a Mayor, 12 Aldermen, 60-100 Burgesses and sergeants. [[Nathaniel Higginson]], who was then the second member of the Council of Fort St George took office as the Mayor of Madras.\n\nIn August 1689, a French fleet appeared near the coast of [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] compelling the Governor of [[Pulicat]] Lawrence Pitt who was on high seas to seek protection within the bastions of Fort St George. Throughout the year 1690, French naval ships from Pondicherry ravaged the coast in order to drive the English and the Dutch out of the East Indies but were unsuccessful. They eventually withdrew from their enterprise when faced with heavy losses. It was also during this time that the English purchased the town of Tegnapatnam from the Marathas.\n\n=== Accusations of corruption and removal ===\n\nAs president of Fort St. George, Yale purchased territory for private purposes with East India Company funds, including a fort at Tevnapatam (now [[Cuddalore]]). Yale imposed high taxes for the maintenance of the colonial [[garrison]] and town, resulting in an unpopular regime and several revolts by Indians, brutally quelled by garrison soldiers. Yale was also notorious for arresting and trying Indians on his own private authority, including the hanging of a stable boy who had absconded with a Company horse.<ref name=\"hindu20050504\" />\n\nCharges of corruption were brought against Elihu Yale in the last years of his Presidency.

He realised that with most printing telegraphs of the period the line is idle for most of the time, apart from the brief intervals when a character is transmitted. Baudot devised one of the first applications of time-division multiplexing in telegraphy. Using synchronized clockwork-powered switches at the transmitting and receiving ends, he was able to transmit five messages simultaneously; the system was officially adopted by the French Post & Telegraph Administration five years later.\n\nBaudot invented his [[Baudot code|telegraph code]] in 1870{{cn|date=April 2017|reason=We need top-reliable or even primary sources here as multiple other sources are differing in the date.}}  and patented it in 1874.{{cn|date=April 2017|reason=We need top-reliable or even primary sources here as multiple other sources are differing in the date.}} It was a 5-bit code, with equal on and off intervals, which allowed telegraph transmission of the [[Roman alphabet]], punctuation and control signals. By 1874 or 1875 (various sources give both dates) he had also perfected the electromechanical hardware to transmit his code. His inventions were based on the printing mechanism from Hughes' instrument, a distributor invented by [[Bernard Meyer (inventor)|Bernard Meyer]] in 1871, and the five-unit code devised by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]]. Baudot combined these, together with original ideas of his own, to produce a complete [[Multiplexing#Telegraphy|multiplex]] system.\n\n==Baudot system==\n[[File:Clavier Baudot.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Baudot keyboard, ''Journal t\u00e9l\u00e9graphique'' 1884]]\nOn 17 June 1874 Baudot patented his first printing telegraph (Patent no. 103,898 \"Syst\u00e8me de t\u00e9l\u00e9graphie rapide\"), in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Baudot's hardware had three main parts: the keyboard, the distributor, and a paper tape.\n\nEach operator - there were as many as four - was allocated a single sector. The keyboard had just five piano type keys, operated with two fingers of the left hand and three fingers of the right hand. The five unit code was designed to be easy to remember. Once the keys had been pressed they were locked down until the contacts again passed over the sector connected to that particular keyboard, when the keyboard was unlocked ready for the next character to be entered, with an audible click (known as the \"cadence signal\") to warn the operator. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.<ref>{{cite book | last = Beauchamp | first = K.G. | authorlink = | title = History of Telegraphy: Its Technology and Application | publisher = [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] | year = 2001 | location = | pages = 394\u2013395 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-85296-792-6}}</ref>\n\nThe receiver was also connected to the distributor. The signals from the telegraph line were temporarily stored on a set of five [[electromagnet]]s, before being decoded to print the corresponding character on paper tape.\n\nAccurate operation of this system depended on the distributor at the transmitting end keeping in synchronization with the one at the receiving end and operators only sending characters when the contacts passed over their allocated sector. This could be achieved at a speed of 30 wpm by strictly observing the \"cadence\" of rhythm of the system when the distributor gave the operator the use of the line.\n\n==First use==\nThe Baudot system was accepted by the French Telegraph Administration in 1875, with the first online tests of his system occurring between Paris and Bordeaux on 12 November 1877. At the end of 1877, the Paris-Rome line, which was about {{convert|1700|km|mi}}, began operating a duplex Baudot.\n\nThe Baudot apparatus was shown at the Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1878)]] and won him the Exposition's gold medal, as well as bringing his system to worldwide notice.\n\n==Later career==\nAfter the first success of his system, Baudot was promoted to Controller in 1880, and was named Inspector-Engineer in 1882.\n\nIn July 1887 he conducted successful tests on the Atlantic telegraph cable between [[Weston-super-Mare]] and [[Waterville, Nova Scotia]] operated by the Commercial Company, with a double Baudot installed in duplex, the Baudot transmitters and receivers substituted for the recorder.\n\nOn 8 August 1890 he established communications between Paris, [[Vannes]], and [[Lorient]] over a single wire. On 3 January 1894 he installed a triplex apparatus on the telegraph between Paris and Bordeaux that had previously been operating with some difficulty on the Hughes telegraph system. On 27 April 1894 he established communications between the Paris stock exchange and the Milan stock exchange, again over a single wire, using his new invention, the retransmitter.\n\nIn 1897 the Baudot system was improved by switching to [[punched tape]], which was prepared offline like the Morse tape used with the [[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone]] and [[Frederick George Creed|Creed]] systems. A tape reader, controlled by the Baudot distributor, then replaced the manual keyboard. The tape had five rows of holes for the code, with a sixth row of smaller holes for transporting the tape through the reader mechanism. Baudot\u2019s code was later standardised as International Telegraph Alphabet Number One.\n\nBaudot received little help from the French Telegraph Administration for his system, and often had to fund his own research, even having to sell the gold medal awarded by the 1878 Exposition Universelle in 1880.\n\nThe Baudot telegraph system was employed progressively in France, and then was adopted in other countries, Italy being the first to introduce it, in its inland service, in 1887. The Netherlands followed in 1895, Switzerland in 1896, and Austria and Brazil in 1897. The British Post Office adopted it for a simplex circuit between London and Paris during 1897, then used it for more general purposes from 1898. In 1900 it was adopted by Germany, by Russia in 1904, the British West Indies in 1905, Spain in 1906, Belgium in 1909, Argentina in 1912, and Romania in 1913.\n\n==Final years==\nBaudot married Marie Josephine Adelaide Langrognet on 15 January 1890.  She died only three months later, on 9 April 1890.\n\nSoon after starting work with the telegraph service, Baudot began to suffer physical discomfort and was frequently absent from work for this reason, for as long as a month on one occasion. His condition affected him for the rest of his life, until he died on 28 March 1903, at [[Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine]], near Paris, at the age of 57.\n\n==Mimault patent suit==\nIn 1874, French telegraph operator Louis Victor Mimault patented a telegraph system using five separate lines to transmit. After his patent was rejected by the Telegraph Administration, Mimault modified his device to incorporate features from the [[Bernard Meyer (inventor)|Meyer]] telegraph and obtained a new patent which was also rejected. In the meantime, Baudot had patented his prototype telegraph a few weeks earlier.\n\nMimault claimed priority of invention over Baudot and brought a patent suit against him in 1877. The Tribunal Civil de la Seine, which reviewed testimony from three experts unconnected with the Telegraph Administration, found in favor of Mimault and accorded him priority of invention of the Baudot code and ruled that Baudot's patents were simply improvements of Mimault's. Neither inventor was satisfied with this judgment, which was eventually rescinded with Mimault being ordered to pay all legal costs.\n\nMimault became unnerved because of the decision, and after an incident where he shot at and wounded two students of the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]] (charges for which were dropped), he demanded a special act to prolong the duration of his patents, 100,000 Francs, and election to the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur#Third Republic|L\u00e9gion d'honneur]]. A commission directed by [[Jules Raynaud]] (head of telegraph research) rejected his demands. Upon hearing the decision, Mimault shot and killed Raynaud, and was sentenced to 10 years forced labour and 20 years of exile.<ref name=froehlich/>\n\n==Honors==\n*1881 - Diploma of Honor from the International Electrical Exposition.\n*1882 - Gold medal from the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Encouragement pour l'Industrie Nationale]] (SEIN)\n*1889 - Ampere Medal from SEIN\n*1878 - Knight's Cross of the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur#Third Republic|L\u00e9gion d'honneur]]\n*1882 - Knight of the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]]\n*1884 - Knight of the [[Order of Franz Joseph]] of Austria.\n*1891 - Cross of the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]]\n*1898 - Promoted to Officier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur\n*1900 - Knight of the [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus]] (Italy)\n*1901 - Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy\n*A street in the [[17th arrondissement of Paris]] was named after Baudot, but it no longer exists.<ref>[http://parisemantique.fr/ Paris S\u00e9mantique]: [http://parisemantique.fr/entities/OldWay/rue_baudot former street: rue Baudot]: \"Disappeared following the development of the [[Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique]] in 1971.

A variant, so called Compact-EDGE, was developed for use in a portion of [[Digital AMPS]] network spectrum.<ref>ETSI SMG2 99/872</ref>\n\nThrough the introduction of sophisticated methods of coding and transmitting data, EDGE delivers higher bit-rates per radio channel, resulting in a threefold increase in capacity and performance compared with an ordinary GSM/GPRS connection.\n\nEDGE can be used for any [[packet switching|packet switched]] application, such as an [[Internet]] connection.\n\nEvolved EDGE continues in Release 7 of the [[3GPP]] standard providing reduced latency and more than doubled performance e.g. to complement High-Speed Packet Access ([[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]]). Peak bit-rates of up to 1 Mbit/s and typical bit-rates of 400 kbit/s can be expected.\n\n== Technology ==\nEDGE/EGPRS is implemented as a bolt-on enhancement for [[2G#2.5G (GPRS)|2.5G]] GSM/GPRS networks, making it easier for existing GSM carriers to upgrade to it. EDGE is a superset to GPRS and can function on any network with GPRS deployed on it, provided the carrier implements the necessary upgrade.\nEDGE requires no hardware or software changes to be made in GSM core networks. EDGE-compatible transceiver units must be installed and the base station subsystem needs to be upgraded to support EDGE. If the operator already has this in place, which is often the case today, the network can be upgraded to EDGE by activating an optional software feature. Today EDGE is supported by all major chip vendors for both GSM and [[WCDMA]]/[[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]].\n\n=== Transmission techniques ===\nIn addition to  [[Gaussian minimum-shift keying]] (GMSK), EDGE uses [[phase shift keying#Higher-order PSK|higher-order PSK/8 phase shift keying]] (8PSK) for the upper five of its nine modulation and coding schemes. EDGE produces a 3-bit word for every change in carrier phase. This effectively triples the gross data rate offered by GSM. EDGE, like [[GPRS]], uses a rate adaptation algorithm that adapts the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) according to the quality of the radio channel, and thus the bit rate and robustness of data transmission. It introduces a new technology not found in GPRS, [[Hybrid ARQ|Incremental Redundancy]], which, instead of retransmitting disturbed packets, sends more redundancy information to be combined in the receiver. This increases the probability of correct decoding.\n\nEDGE can carry a bandwidth up to 236&nbsp;kbit/s (with end-to-end latency of less than 150&nbsp;ms) for 4 [[timeslot]]s (theoretical maximum is 473.6&nbsp;kbit/s for 8 timeslots) in packet mode. This means it can handle four times as much traffic as standard GPRS. EDGE meets the [[International Telecommunications Union]]'s requirement for a [[3G]] network, and has been accepted by the ITU as part of the [[IMT-2000]] family of 3G standards.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> It also enhances the circuit data mode called [[HSCSD]], increasing the data rate of this service.\n\n=== EDGE modulation and coding scheme (MCS) ===\nThe channel encoding process in GPRS as well as EGPRS/EDGE consists of two steps: first, a cyclic code is used to add parity bits, which are also referred to as the Block Check Sequence, followed by coding with a possibly punctured [[convolutional code]].<ref name=TS45001>{{cite web |url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/45001.htm |title=3GGP TS45.001: Technical Specification Group GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network; Physical layer on the radio path; General description |author=3rd Generation Partnership Project |date=September 2012 |accessdate=2013-07-20}}</ref> In GPRS, the Coding Schemes CS-1 to CS-4 specify the number of parity bits generated by the cyclic code and the puncturing rate of the convolutional code.<ref name=TS45001/> In GPRS Coding Schemes CS-1 through CS-3, the convolutional code is of rate 1/2, i.e. each input bit is converted into two coded bits.<ref name=TS45001/> In Coding Schemes CS-2 and CS-3, the output of the convolutional code is [[puncturing|punctured]] to achieve the desired code rate.<ref name=TS45001/> In GPRS Coding Scheme CS-4, no convolutional coding is applied.<ref name=TS45001/>\n\nIn EGPRS/EDGE, the [[Modulation]] and Coding Schemes MCS-1 to MCS-9 take the place of the Coding Schemes of GPRS, and additionally specify which modulation scheme is used, GMSK or 8PSK.<ref name=TS45001/> MCS-1 through MCS-4 use GMSK and have performance similar (but not equal) to GPRS, while MCS-5 through MCS-9 use 8PSK.<ref name=TS45001/> In all EGPRS Modulation and Coding Schemes, a convolutional code of rate 1/3 is used, and puncturing is used to achieve the desired code rate.<ref name=TS45001/> In contrast to GPRS, the [[Radio Link Control]] (RLC) and [[Media Access Control]] (MAC) headers and the payload data are coded separately in EGPRS.<ref name=TS45001/> The headers are coded more robustly than the data.<ref name=TS45001/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=center\n!

Latencies are reduced by lowering the [[Transmission Time Interval]] by half (from 20 ms to 10 ms). Bit rates are increased up to 1 Mbit/s peak bandwidth and latencies down to 80 ms using dual carrier, higher symbol rate and [[higher-order modulation]] (32QAM and 16QAM instead of 8PSK), and [[turbo code]]s to improve error correction. This results in real world downlink speeds of up to 600kbit/s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://developer.att.com/devcentral/tools_technologies/network/docs/DataCapabilities_GPRS__to_HSDPA.pdf |title=EDGE, HSPA and LTE: The Mobile Broadband Advantage |publisher=Rysavy Research and 3G Americas |pages=58\u201365 |date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2010-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007091901/http://developer.att.com/devcentral/tools_technologies/network/docs/DataCapabilities_GPRS__to_HSDPA.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-07 |df= }}</ref> Further the signal quality is improved using dual antennas improving average bit-rates and spectrum efficiency.\n\nThe main intention of increasing the existing EDGE throughput is that many operators would like to upgrade their existing infrastructure rather than invest on new network infrastructure. Mobile operators have invested billions in GSM networks, many of which are already capable of supporting EDGE data speeds up to 236.8 kbit/s. With a software upgrade and a new device compliant with Evolved EDGE (like an Evolved EDGE [[smartphone]]) for the user, these data rates can be boosted to speeds approaching 1 Mbit/s (i.e. 98.6 kbit/s per timeslot for 32QAM). Many service providers may not invest on a completely new technology like [[3G]] networks.<ref name=\"engadgetmobile.com\">http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2009/09/14/nokia-siemens-fires-off-first-edge-evolution-downlink-dual-carrier/</ref>\n\nConsiderable research and development happened throughout the world for this new technology. A successful trial by Nokia Siemens and \"one of China's leading operators\" has been achieved in a live environment.<ref name=\"engadgetmobile.com\"/> With the introduction for more advanced wireless technologies like UMTS and LTE, which also focus on a network coverage layer on low frequencies and the upcoming phase-out and shutdown of [[2G]] mobile networks, it is very unlikely that Evolved EDGE will ever see any deployment on live networks. Up to now (as of 2016) there are no [[Wireless network|commercial networks]] which support the Evolved EDGE standard (3GPP Rel-7).\n\n=== Technology ===\n\n==== Reduced Latency ====\nWith Evolved EDGE come three major features designed to reduce latency over the air interface.\n\nIn EDGE, a single RLC data block (ranging from 23 to 148 bytes of data) is transmitted over four frames, using a single time slot. On average, this requires 20 ms for one way transmission. Under the RTTI scheme, one data block is transmitted over two frames in two timeslots, reducing the latency of the air interface to 10 ms.\n\nIn addition, Reduced Latency also implies support of Piggy-backed [[ACK (TCP)|ACK]]/[[NACK]] (PAN), in which a bitmap of blocks not received is included in normal data blocks. Using the PAN field, the receiver may report missing data blocks immediately, rather than waiting to send a dedicated PAN message.\n\nA final enhancement is RLC-non persistent mode. With EDGE, the RLC interface could operate in either acknowledged mode, or unacknowledged mode. In unacknowledged mode, there is no retransmission of missing data blocks, so a single corrupt block would cause an entire upper-layer IP packet to be lost. With non-persistent mode, an RLC data block may be retransmitted if it is less than a certain age. Once this time expires, it is considered lost, and subsequent data blocks may then be forwarded to upper layers.\n\n==== Downlink Dual Carrier ====\nWith Downlink Dual Carrier, the handheld is able to receive on two different frequency channels at the same time, doubling the downlink throughput. In addition, if second receiver is present then the handheld is able to receive on an additional timeslot in single-carrier mode, because it may overlap the tuning of one receiver with other tasks.\n\n==== Higher Modulation Schemes ====\nBoth uplink and downlink throughput is improved by using 16 or 32 QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), along with turbo codes and higher symbol rates.\n\n== Networks ==\n\nThe Global mobile Suppliers Association (GSA) states that,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsacom.com/downloads/pdf/EDGE_Fact_Sheet_030513.php4 |title=GSA \u2013 The Global mobile Suppliers Association EDGE Databank |publisher=Gsacom.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref> as of May 2013, there were 604 GSM/EDGE networks in 213 countries, from a total of 606 mobile network operator commitments in 213 countries.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Computer science|Telecommunication}}\n* [[Broadband Internet access]]\n* [[CDMA2000]]\n* [[Evolution-Data Optimized]]\n* [[List of device bandwidths]]\n* [[Mobile broadband]]\n* [[Spectral efficiency#Comparison table|Spectral efficiency comparison table]]\n* [[UMTS]]\n* [[WiFi]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.gsacom.com/ The Global mobile Suppliers Association]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212257/http://www.3g.co.uk/PR/Nov2006/3897.htm Evolved EDGE as an alternative to 3G]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081021132523/http://www.3gamericas.org/English/About_3G_Americas/ A technical document by the 3G Americas association]\n* [http://mobilesociety.typepad.com/mobile_life/2006/11/evolved_edge_th.html An opinion on evolved EDGE by Martin Sauter]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130306012136/http://www.visantstrategies.com/market_research/edge_evolution_egprs_evolved.html An EDGE Evolution report by Visant Strategies]\n* [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/45912.htm Feasibility study for evolved GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network by 3GPP]\n\n{{Mobile telecommunications standards}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Enhanced Data Rates For Gsm Evolution}}\n[[Category:GSM standard]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications-related introductions in 2003]]\n[[Category:Videotelephony]]", "sha1": "4vap48z1nihoerpmo1yh6ybngbzi6nh"}}, {"title": "EDGE", "ns": "0", "id": "10214", "redirect": {"title": "Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution"}, "revision": {"id": "783862434", "parentid": "709077185", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:48:03Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from merge}}\n{{R from acronym}}\n}}", "sha1": "7i5yzrrb2z58bgpfih30ns26s7sr4rt"}}, {"title": "Eth", "ns": "0", "id": "10216", "revision": {"id": "865469481", "parentid": "857375192", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T04:29:49Z", "contributor": {"username": "Kintetsubuffalo", "id": "487310"}, "comment": "/* Miscellaneous */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about||a list of letters that look similar to '''\u00d0''' in uppercase|D with stroke (disambiguation)|other uses}}\n{{Redirect|Edh}}\n\n[[File:Latin letter \u00d0.svg|thumb|alt=Lower case and upper case of Eth expressed by a sans serif single-stroke-width font and a serif variable-stroke-width font|Eth in [[Arial]] and [[Times New Roman]]]]\n\n'''Eth''' ({{IPAc-en|\u025b|\u00f0|}}, [[uppercase]]: '''\u00d0''', [[lowercase]]: '''\u00f0'''; also spelled '''edh''' or '''e\u00f0''') is a [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] used in [[Old English]], [[Middle English]], [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language#Alphabet|Faroese]] (in which it is called ''edd''), and [[Elfdalian]].

In these texts, written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], the Euphrates is called ''Buranuna'' ([[logogram|logographic]]: UD.KIB.NUN). The name could also be written KIB.NUN.(NA) or <sup>d</sup>KIB.NUN, with the prefix \"<sup>[[Dingir|d]]</sup>\" indicating that the river was a [[divinity]].

These rivers rise in the foothills of the [[Taurus Mountains]] along the Syro\u2013Turkish border and add comparatively little water to the Euphrates. The Sajur is the smallest of these tributaries; emerging from two streams near [[Gaziantep]] and draining the plain around [[Manbij]] before emptying into the [[reservoir]] of the [[Tishrin Dam]]. The Balikh receives most of its water from a [[Karst topography|karstic]] spring near 'Ayn al-'Arus and flows due south until it reaches the Euphrates at the city of [[Raqqa]]. In terms of length, drainage basin and discharge, the Khabur is the largest of these three. Its main karstic springs are located around [[Ras al-Ayn, al-Hasakah|Ra's al-'Ayn]], from where the Khabur flows southeast past [[Al-Hasakah]], where the river turns south and drains into the Euphrates near [[Busayrah]]. Once the Euphrates enters Iraq, there are no more natural tributaries to the Euphrates, although canals connecting the Euphrates basin with the Tigris basin exist.<ref name=hillel95>{{harvnb|Hillel|1994|p=95}}</ref><ref name=holezaitchik>{{harvnb|Hole|Zaitchik|2007}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Although millennia-long human occupation in most parts of the Euphrates basin has significantly degraded the landscape, patches of original vegetation remain. The steady drop in annual rainfall from the sources of the Euphrates toward the Persian Gulf is a strong determinant for the vegetation that can be supported. In its upper reaches the Euphrates flows through the mountains of Southeast Turkey and their southern foothills which support a [[xeric]] [[woodland]]. Plant species in the moister parts of this zone include various [[oak]]s, [[pistacia|pistachio trees]], and ''[[Rosaceae]]'' (rose/plum family). The drier parts of the xeric woodland zone supports less dense oak forest and ''Rosaceae''.

This steppe is characterised by [[Artemisia herba-alba|white wormwood]] (''Artemisia herba-alba'') and ''[[Chenopodiaceae]]''.

It is one of the few [[Languages of Europe]] that is not of an [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] origin. Despite some overlaps in the vocabulary due to borrowings, in terms of its origin, Estonian and Finnish are not related to their nearest geographical neighbours, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], and [[Russian language|Russian]], which are all [[Indo-European languages]].\n\nAlthough the Estonian and [[Germanic language]]s are of very different origins, one can identify many similar words in Estonian and German, for example. This is primarily because the Estonian language has borrowed nearly one third of its vocabulary from [[Germanic languages]], mainly from Low Saxon ([[Middle Low German]]) during the period of [[History of Estonia#Estonian Crusade: The Middle Ages|German rule]], and [[High German]] (including [[standard German]]). The percentage of Low Saxon and High German loanwords can be estimated at 22\u201325 percent, with Low Saxon making up about 15 percent.\n\nEstonian is a predominantly [[agglutinative language]], but unlike Finnish, it has lost [[vowel harmony]], the front vowels occurring exclusively on the first or stressed syllable, although in older texts the vowel harmony can still be recognized. Furthermore, the loss of word-final sounds is extensive, and this has made its inflectional morphology markedly more [[fusional language|fusional]], especially with respect to noun and adjective inflection.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Word order is considerably more flexible than English, but the basic order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]].\n\n==History==\nThe two different historical Estonian languages (sometimes considered [[dialects]]), the North and [[South Estonian language]]s, are based on the ancestors of modern Estonians' migration into the territory of Estonia in at least two different waves, both groups speaking considerably different [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] vernaculars.<ref name=\"Rannut\"/> Modern standard Estonian has evolved on the basis of the dialects of Northern Estonia.\n\n[[File:EstonianGrammar1637.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Estonian grammar]] published in Reval in 1637 by Heinrich Stahl]]\nThe oldest written records of the Finnic languages of Estonia date from the 13th century.

Peterson, who was the first student at the then German-language [[University of Tartu|University of Dorpat]] to acknowledge his Estonian origin, is commonly regarded as a herald of [[Estonian literature|Estonian national literature]] and considered the founder of modern Estonian poetry.

The Russian language was termed as \u2018the language of friendship of nations\u2019 and was taught to Estonian children, sometimes as early as in kindergarten. Although teaching Estonian to non-Estonians in schools was compulsory, in practice learning the language was often considered unnecessary.<ref name=\"Rannut\" />\n\nDuring the [[Perestroika]] era, The Law on the Status of the Estonian Language was adopted in January 1989. The 1991 collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] led to the restoration of the [[Estonia|Republic of Estonia]]'s [[History of Estonia#Regaining independence|independence]].

The letters ''c'', ''q'', ''w'', ''x'' and ''y'' are limited to [[proper names]] of foreign origin, and ''f'', ''z'', ''\u0161'', and ''\u017e'' appear in loanwords and foreign names only. ''\u00d6'' and ''\u00fc'' are pronounced similarly to their equivalents in Swedish and German. Unlike in standard German but like Finnish and Swedish (when followed by 'r'), ''\u00c4'' is pronounced [\u00e6], as in English ''mat''. The vowels \u00c4, \u00d6 and \u00dc are clearly separate [[phonemes]] and inherent in Estonian, although the letter shapes come from German. The letter ''[[\u00f5]]'' denotes {{IPA|/\u0264/}}, unrounded {{IPA|/o/}}, or a [[close-mid back unrounded vowel]]. It is almost identical to the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] [[\u044a]] {{IPA|/\u0264\u031e/}} and the [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] [[\u01a1]], and is also used to transcribe the Russian [[\u044b]].\n\n===Orthography===\nAlthough the Estonian [[orthography]] is generally guided by phonemic principles, with each [[grapheme]] corresponding to one [[phoneme]], there are some historical and morphological deviations from this: for example preservation of the morpheme in [[declension]] of the word (writing b, g, d in places where p, k, t is pronounced)<!--examples needed--> and in the use of 'i' and 'j'.{{Clarify|date=September 2012}} Where it is very impractical or impossible to type ''\u0161'' and ''\u017e'', they are substituted with ''sh'' and ''zh'' in some written texts, although this is considered incorrect. Otherwise, the ''h'' in ''sh'' represents a [[voiceless glottal fricative]], as in ''Pasha'' (''pas-ha''); this also applies to some foreign names.\n\nModern Estonian orthography is based on the ''Newer Orthography'' created by [[Eduard Ahrens]] in the second half of the 19th{{nbsp}}century based on Finnish orthography. The ''Older Orthography'' it replaced was created in the 17th{{nbsp}}century by [[Bengt Gottfried Forselius]] and [[Johann Hornung]] based on [[German language|standard German]] orthography. Earlier writing in Estonian had by and large used an ''ad hoc'' orthography based on [[Latin]] and [[Middle Low German]] orthography. Some influences of the standard German orthography \u2014 for example, writing 'W'/'w' instead of 'V'/'v' \u2014 persisted well into the 1930s.\n\nEstonian words and names quoted in international publications from Soviet sources are often back-transliterations from the Russian transliteration. Examples are the use of \"ya\" for \"\u00e4\" (e.g. Pyarnu instead of [[P\u00e4rnu]]), \"y\" instead of \"\u00f5\" (e.g., Pylva instead of [[P\u00f5lva]]) and \"yu\" instead of \"\u00fc\" (e.g., Pyussi instead of [[P\u00fcssi]]). Even in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' one can find \"ostrov Khiuma\", where \"ostrov\" means \"island\" in Russian and \"Khiuma\" is back-transliteration from Russian instead of \"[[Hiiumaa]]\" (''Hiiumaa'' > \u0425\u0438\u0439\u0443\u043c\u0430(\u0430) > ''Khiuma'').\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Summarize|from|Estonian phonology|date=March 2015}}\n{{main article|Estonian phonology}}There are 9 vowels and 36 diphthongs, 28 of which are native to Estonian.<sup>[[Estonian phonology#cite note-1|[1]]]</sup> All nine vowels can appear as the first component of a diphthong, but only /\u0251 e i o u/ occur as the second component. A vowel characteristic of Estonian is the unrounded back vowel /\u0264/, which may be [[Close-mid back unrounded vowel|close-mid back]], [[Close back unrounded vowel|close back]], or [[Close-mid central unrounded vowel|close-mid central]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Front vowel|Front]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Back vowel|Back]]\n|- style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n![[Unrounded vowel|Unrounded]]\n![[Rounded vowel|Rounded]]\n![[Unrounded vowel|Unrounded]]\n![[Rounded vowel|Rounded]]\n|-\n![[Close vowel|Close]]\n|{{IPA link|i}}\n|{{IPA link|y}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | {{IPA link|\u0264}}\n|{{IPA link|u}}\n|-\n![[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n|{{IPA link|e}}\n|{{IPA link|\u00f8}}\n|{{IPA link|o}}\n|-\n![[Open vowel|Open]]\n|{{IPA link|\u00e6}}\n|\n|{{IPA link|\u0251}}\n|\n|}\n\n==Grammar==\n{{main article|Estonian grammar}}\nTypologically, Estonian represents a transitional form from an [[agglutinating language]] to a [[fusional language]]. The canonical word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]] (subject\u2013verb\u2013object).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.beltranslations.com |title=beltranslations.com |language=ru |access-date=2014-08-23}}</ref>\n\nIn Estonian, nouns and pronouns do not have [[grammatical gender]], but nouns and adjectives decline in fourteen cases: [[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[Partitive case|partitive]], [[illative]], [[inessive]], [[Elative case|elative]], [[allative]], [[adessive]], [[ablative]], [[translative]], [[terminative]], [[essive]], [[abessive]], and [[comitative]], with the case and number of the adjective(s) always agreeing with that of the noun (except in the terminative, essive, abessive and comitative, where there is agreement only for the number, the adjective being in the genitive form). Thus the illative for ''kollane maja'' (\"a yellow house\") is ''kollasesse majja'' (\"into a yellow house\"), but the terminative is ''kollase majani'' (\"as far as a yellow house\"). With respect to the Proto-Finnic language, elision has occurred; thus, the actual case marker may be absent, but the stem is changed, cf. ''maja&nbsp;\u2013 majja'' and the [[Ostrobothnia (language)|Ostrobothnia]] dialect of Finnish ''maja&nbsp;\u2013 majahan''.\n\nThe direct object of the verb appears either in the [[Accusative case|accusative]] (for total objects) or in the partitive (for partial objects). The accusative coincides with the genitive in the singular and with nominative in the plural. Accusative vs. partitive case opposition of the [[Object (grammar)|object]] used with transitive verbs creates a [[telicity]] contrast, just as in Finnish. This is a rough equivalent of the perfective vs. imperfective aspect opposition.<!-- Most books I've seen don't use an accusative case, although I suppose the grammar would make more sense with one. However, when the verb is imperative, the opposition is between nominative and partitive. -->\n\nThe verbal system lacks a distinctive future tense<ref name=\"apj\">{{Cite journal|work=[[American Journal of Political Science]] |title=Language Shapes People's Time Perspective and Support for Future-Oriented Policies |last1=P\u00e9rez |first1=Efr\u00e9n O. |last2=Tavits |first2=Margit |doi=10.1111/ajps.12290 |date=January 24, 2017 |publisher=[[Midwest Political Science Association]]}}</ref> (the present tense serves here) and features special forms to express an action performed by an undetermined [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] (the \"impersonal\").\n\n==Vocabulary==\n\n{{main article|Estonian vocabulary}}\n\nAlthough the Estonian and [[Germanic language]]s are of very different origins, one can identify many similar words in Estonian and English, for example. This is primarily because the Estonian language has borrowed nearly one third of its vocabulary from [[Germanic languages]], mainly from Low Saxon ([[Middle Low German]]) during the period of [[History of Estonia#Estonian Crusade: The Middle Ages|German rule]], and [[High German]] (including [[standard German]]). The percentage of Low Saxon and High German loanwords can be estimated at 22\u201325 percent, with Low Saxon making up about 15 percent.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nOften 'b' & 'p' are interchangeable, for example 'baggage' becomes 'pagas', 'lob' (to throw) becomes 'loopima'. The initial letter 's' before another consonant is often dropped, for example 'skool' becomes 'kool', 'stool' becomes 'tool'.\n\n===''Ex nihilo'' lexical enrichment===\nEstonian [[language planning|language planners]] such as [[Ado Grenzstein]] (a journalist active in Estonia in the 1870s\u201390s) tried to use formation ''[[ex nihilo]]'', [[Ursch\u00f6pfung]];<ref name=\"Zuckermann 2003 p149\">{{Cite book |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |title-link=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |date=2003 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1403917232 |location=New York, N.Y. |pages=149 |author-link=Ghil'ad Zuckermann}}</ref> i.e. they created new words out of nothing.\n\nThe most famous reformer of Estonian, [[Johannes Aavik]] (1880\u20131973), used creations ''ex nihilo'' (cf. \u2018free constructions\u2019, Tauli 1977), along with other sources of lexical enrichment such as derivations, compositions and loanwords (often from Finnish; cf. Saareste and Raun 1965: 76). In Aavik\u2019s dictionary (1921), which lists approximately 4000 words, there are many words which were (allegedly) created ''ex nihilo'', many of which are in common use today. Examples are\n* ''ese'' \u2018object\u2019,\n* ''kolp'' \u2018skull\u2019,\n* ''liibuma'' \u2018to cling\u2019,\n* ''naasma'' \u2018to return, come back\u2019,\n* ''n\u00f5me'' 'stupid, dull.'<ref name=\"Zuckermann 2003 p149\" />\n\nMany of the coinages that have been considered (often by Aavik himself) as words concocted ''ex nihilo'' could well have been influenced by foreign lexical items, for example words from [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[English language|English]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Aavik had a broad classical education and knew [[Ancient Greek]], [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]]. Consider  ''roim'' \u2018crime\u2019 versus [[English language|English]] ''crime'' or ''taunima'' \u2018to condemn, disapprove\u2019 versus [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''tuomita'' \u2018to condemn, to judge\u2019 (these Aavikisms appear in Aavik\u2019s 1921 dictionary).

The essay quickly generated controversy within the general semantics field{{fact|date=November 2016}}, partly because practitioners of general semantics{{who|date=November 2016}} sometimes saw Bourland as attacking the verb '<nowiki/>''to be''' as such, and not just certain usages.{{fact|date=November 2016}}\n\nBourland collected and published three volumes of essays in support of his innovation. The first (1991), co-edited by Paul Dennithorne Johnston, bore the title: ''To Be or Not: An E-Prime Anthology'' <ref>\n{{cite book|editor1-last= Bourland|editor1-first= D.

Bourland and Johnston then edited a third book, ''E-Prime III: a third anthology'', published in 1997.\n\n==Different functions of \"to be\"==\n\nIn the [[English language]], the verb 'to be' (also known as the ''[[copula (linguistics)|copula]]'') has several distinct functions:\n* [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]], of the form \"''noun'' ''copula'' ''definite-noun''\" ''[The cat is my only pet]''; ''[The cat is Garfield]''\n* [[class (philosophy)|class membership]], of the form \"''definite-noun'' ''copula'' ''noun''\" ''[Garfield is a cat]''\n* [[class (philosophy)|class inclusion]], of the form \"''noun'' ''copula'' ''noun''\" ''[A cat is an animal]''\n* [[predicate (grammar)|predication]], of the form \"''noun'' ''copula'' ''adjective''\" ''[The cat is furry]''\n* [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]], of the form \"''noun'' ''copula'' ''verb''\" ''[The cat is sleeping]''; ''[The cat is being bitten by the dog]''. The examples illustrate two different uses of 'be' as an auxiliary. In the first, 'be' is part of the progressive aspect, used with \"-ing\" on the verb; in the second, it is part of the [[English passive voice|passive]], as indicated by the perfect participle of a transitive verb.\n* [[existence]], of the form \"there ''copula'' ''noun''\" ''[There is a cat]''\n* [[Location (geography)|location]], of the form \"''noun'' ''copula'' ''place-phrase''\" ''[The cat is on the mat]''; ''[The cat is here]''\n\nBourland sees specifically the \"identity\" and \"predication\" functions as pernicious, but advocates eliminating all forms for the sake of simplicity. In the case of the \"existence\" form (and less [[idiom]]atically, the \"location\" form), one might (for example) simply substitute the verb \"exists\". Other copula-substitutes in English include ''taste'', ''feel'', ''smell'', ''sound'', ''grow'', ''remain'', ''stay'', and ''turn'', among others a user of E-prime might use instead of ''to be''.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Rationale==\n\nBourland and other advocates also suggest that use of E-Prime leads to a less [[dogma]]tic style of language that reduces the possibility of misunderstanding or conflict.<ref>{{cite journal |first=D.

Spencer-Brown]] (except for one statement)\n\n==Criticisms==\n\nMany authors have questioned E-Prime's effectiveness at improving readability and reducing prejudice (Lakoff, 1992; Murphy, 1992; Parkinson, 1992; Kenyon, 1992; French, 1992, 1993; Lohrey, 1993<!-- which authors questions which points? -->). These authors <!-- all of them? -->observed that a communication under the copula ban can remain extremely unclear and imply prejudice, while losing important speech patterns, such as identities and identification. Further, prejudices and judgments that are made are more difficult to notice or refute. James D. French, a computer programmer at the University of California, Berkeley, summarized ten arguments against E-Prime (in the context of general semantics) as follows:<ref>\nCompare:\n{{cite journal |last=French |first=James D |year=1992 |title=The Top Ten Arguments Against E-Prime |journal=ETC: A Review of General Semantics |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=75\u201379 |publisher=Institute of General Semantics }}\n</ref>\n\n# The elimination of a whole class of sentences results in fewer alternatives and is likely to make writing less, rather than more, interesting. One can improve bad writing more by reducing use of the verb 'to be' than by eliminating it.\n# \"Effective writing techniques\" are not relevant to general semantics as a discipline, and therefore should not be promoted as general semantics practice.\n# The context often ameliorates the possible harmful effects from the use of the is-of-identity and the is-of-predication, so it is not necessary to eliminate all such sentences. For example, \"George is a Judge\" in response to a question of what he does for a living would not be a questionable statement.\n# ''To be'' statements do not only convey identity but also asymmetrical relations (\"X is higher than Y\"); negation (\"A is not B\"); location (\"Berlin is in Germany\"); auxiliary (\"I am going to the store\") etc., forms we would also have to sacrifice.\n# Eliminating ''to be'' from English has little effect on eliminating identity. For example, a statement of apparently equal identification, \"The silly ban on copula continues,\" can be made without the copula assuming an identity rather than asserting it, consequently hampering our awareness of it.\n# Identity-in-the-language is not the same thing as the far more important identity-in-reaction (identification). General semantics cuts the link between the two through the practice of silence on the objective levels, adopting a self-reflexive attitude, e.g., \"as I see it\" \"it seems to me\" etc., and by the use of quotation marks\u2014without using E-Prime.\n# The advocates of E-Prime have not proven that it is easier to eliminate the verb ''to be'' from the English language than it is to eliminate just the is-of-identity and the is-of-predication. It may well be easier to do the latter for many people.\n# One of the best languages for [[General semantics#Important premises in general semantics theory|time-binding]] is mathematics, which relies heavily on the notion of equivalence and equality. For the purposes of time-binding, it may be better to keep ''to be'' in the language while only cutting the link between identity-in-the-language and identification-in-our-reactions.\n# A civilization advances when it can move from the idea of individual trees to that of forest. E-Prime tends to make the expression of higher orders of abstraction more difficult, e.g. \"She is a student\" is rendered in E-Prime, e.g., as \"She attends classes at the university\".\n# E-Prime makes no distinction between statements that cross the principles of general semantics and statements that do not. It lacks consistency with the other tenets of general semantics and should not be included into the discipline.\n\nAccording to an article (written in E-Prime and advocating a role for E-Prime in [[English as a foreign or second language|ESL and EFL]] programs) published by the Office of English Language Programs of the [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]] in the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] of the United States, \"Requiring students to avoid the verb to be on every assignment would deter students from developing other fundamental skills of fluent writing.\"<ref>\n{{cite web |first=John C. |last=Herbert |title=English Prime as an Instructional Tool in Writing Classes |url=http://exchanges.state.gov/forum/vols/vol41/no3/p26.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007112531/http://exchanges.state.gov/forum/vols/vol41/no3/p26.htm |archivedate=2006-10-07 |work=English Teaching Forum Online |publisher=United States Department of State |accessdate=2009-10-06 |quote=When applying the aforementioned ideas to any writing assignment, teachers must make sure their students know that the proposed set of guidelines represents only one means to an end and does not present an end in itself.

Region shown is [\u22123,3]<sup>2</sup> (For (''a'', ''b'') = (0, 0) the function is not smooth and therefore not an elliptic curve.)]]\n{{Group theory sidebar |Algebraic}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], an '''elliptic curve''' is a [[plane algebraic curve]] defined by an equation of the form\n\n:<math>y^2 = x^3 + ax + b</math>\n\nwhich is [[Singular point of a curve|non-singular]]; that is, the curve has no [[cusp (singularity)|cusps]] or self-intersections. (When the [[coefficient field]] has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 2 or 3, the above equation is not quite general enough to comprise all non-singular [[cubic plane curve|cubic curves]]; see {{section link|#Elliptic curves over a general field}} below.)\n\nFormally, an elliptic curve is a [[Nonsingular variety|smooth]], [[Projective variety|projective]], [[algebraic curve]] of [[Genus of an algebraic curve|genus]] one, on which there is a specified point ''O''. An elliptic curve is an [[abelian variety]] \u2013 that is, it has a multiplication defined algebraically, with respect to which it is an [[abelian group]] \u2013 and ''O'' serves as the identity element. Often the curve itself, without ''O'' specified, is called an elliptic curve; the point ''O'' is often taken to be the curve's \"[[point at infinity]]\" in the [[projective plane]].\n\nIf ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''P''(''x''), where ''P'' is any polynomial of degree three in ''x'' with no repeated roots, the solution set is a nonsingular plane curve of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] one, an elliptic curve. If ''P'' has degree four and is [[Square-free polynomial|square-free]] this equation again describes a plane curve of genus one; however, it has no natural choice of identity element. More generally, any algebraic curve of genus one, for example from the intersection of two [[quadric|quadric surfaces]] embedded in three-dimensional projective space, is called an elliptic curve, provided that it has at least one [[rational point]] to act as the identity.\n\nUsing the theory of [[elliptic function]]s, it can be shown that elliptic curves defined over the [[complex number]]s correspond to embeddings of the [[torus]] into the [[complex projective plane]]. The torus is also an [[abelian group]], and in fact this correspondence is also a [[group isomorphism]].\n\nElliptic curves are especially important in [[number theory]], and constitute a major area of current research; for example, they were used in the proof, by [[Andrew Wiles]], of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. They also find applications in [[elliptic curve cryptography]] (ECC) and [[integer factorization]].\n\nAn elliptic curve is ''not'' an [[ellipse]]: see [[elliptic integral]] for the origin of the term.  Topologically, a complex elliptic curve is a [[torus]].\n\n==Elliptic curves over the real numbers==\n[[Image:ECClines-3.svg|frame|right|Graphs of curves ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x'' and ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x'' + 1]]\nAlthough the formal definition of an elliptic curve is fairly technical and requires some background in [[algebraic geometry]], it is possible to describe  some features of elliptic curves over the [[real number]]s using only introductory [[algebra]] and [[geometry]].\n\nIn this context, an elliptic curve is a [[plane curve]] defined by an equation of the form\n\n:<math>y^2 = x^3 + ax + b</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers. This type of equation is called a [[Weierstrass's elliptic functions|Weierstrass equation]].\n\nThe definition of elliptic curve also requires that the curve be [[non-singular]]. Geometrically, this means that the graph has no [[cusp (singularity)|cusps]], self-intersections, or isolated points. Algebraically, this holds if and only if the [[discriminant]]\n\n: <math>\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2)</math>\n\nis not equal to zero. (Although the factor \u221216 is irrelevant to whether or not the curve is non-singular, this definition of the discriminant is useful in a more advanced study of elliptic curves.)\n\nThe (real) graph of a non-singular curve has ''two'' components if its discriminant is positive, and ''one'' component if it is negative. For example, in the graphs shown in figure to the right, the discriminant in the first case is 64, and in the second case is \u2212368.\n\n==The group law==\nWhen working in the [[projective plane]], we can define a group structure on any smooth cubic curve. In Weierstrass normal form, such a curve will have an additional point at infinity, ''O'', at the [[homogeneous coordinates]] [0:1:0] which serves as the identity of the group.\n\nSince the curve is symmetrical about the x-axis, given any point ''P'', we can take \u2212''P'' to be the point opposite it. We take \u2212''O'' to be just ''O''.\n\nIf ''P'' and ''Q'' are two points on the curve, then we can uniquely describe a third point, ''P'' + ''Q'', in the following way. First, draw the line that intersects ''P'' and ''Q''. This will generally intersect the cubic at a third point, ''R''. We then take ''P'' + ''Q'' to be \u2212''R'', the point opposite ''R''.\n\nThis definition for addition works except in a few special cases related to the point at infinity and intersection multiplicity. The first is when one of the points is ''O''. Here, we define ''P'' + ''O'' = ''P'' = ''O'' + ''P'', making ''O'' the identity of the group. Next, if ''P'' and ''Q'' are opposites of each other, we define ''P'' + ''Q'' = ''O''. Lastly, if ''P'' = ''Q'' we only have one point, thus we can't define the line between them. In this case, we use the tangent line to the curve at this point as our line. In most cases, the tangent will intersect a second point ''R'' and we can take its opposite. However, if ''P'' happens to be an [[inflection point]] (a point where the concavity of the curve changes), we take ''R'' to be ''P'' itself and ''P'' + ''P'' is simply the point opposite itself.\n\nFor a cubic curve not in Weierstrass normal form, we can still define a group structure by designating one of its nine inflection points as the identity ''O''. In the projective plane, each line will intersect a cubic at three points when accounting for multiplicity. For a point ''P'', \u2212''P'' is defined as the unique third point on the line passing through ''O'' and ''P''. Then, for any ''P'' and ''Q'', ''P'' + ''Q'' is defined as \u2212''R'' where ''R'' is the unique third point on the line containing ''P'' and ''Q''.\n\nLet ''K'' be a field over which the curve is defined (i.e., the coefficients of the defining equation or equations of the curve are in ''K'') and denote the curve by ''E''. Then the ''K''-[[rational point]]s of ''E'' are the points on ''E'' whose coordinates all lie in ''K'', including the point at infinity. The set of ''K''-rational points is denoted by ''E''(''K'').  It, too, forms a group, because properties of polynomial equations show that if ''P'' is in ''E''(''K''), then \u2212''P'' is also in ''E''(''K''), and if two of ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' are in ''E''(''K''), then so is the third.  Additionally, if ''K'' is a subfield of ''L'', then ''E''(''K'') is a [[subgroup]] of ''E''(''L'').\n\nThe above group can be described algebraically as well as geometrically. Given the curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b'' over the field ''K'' (whose [[Prime subfield|characteristic]] we assume to be neither 2 nor 3), and points ''P'' = (''x<sub>P</sub>'', ''y<sub>P</sub>'') and ''Q'' = (''x<sub>Q</sub>'', ''y<sub>Q</sub>'') on the curve, assume first that ''x<sub>P</sub>'' \u2260 ''x<sub>Q</sub>'' (first pane below). Let ''s'' be the slope of the line containing ''P'' and ''Q''; i.e.,\n\n:<math>s = \\frac{y_P - y_Q}{x_P - x_Q}</math>\n\nSince ''K'' is a field, ''s'' is well-defined. Then we can define ''R'' = (''x<sub>R</sub>'', ''y<sub>R</sub>'') = \u2212(''P'' + ''Q'') by\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  x_R &= s^2 - x_P - x_Q \\\\\n  y_R &= y_P + s(x_R - x_P)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIf ''x<sub>P</sub>'' = ''x<sub>Q</sub>'', then there are two options: if ''y<sub>P</sub>'' = \u2212''y<sub>Q</sub>'' (third and fourth panes below), including the case where ''y<sub>P</sub>'' = ''y<sub>Q</sub>'' = 0 (fourth pane), then the sum is defined as 0; thus, the inverse of each point on the curve is found by reflecting it across the ''x''-axis. If ''y<sub>P</sub>'' = ''y<sub>Q</sub>'' \u2260 0, then ''Q'' = ''P'' and ''R'' = (''x''<sub>''R''</sub>, ''y''<sub>''R''</sub>) = \u2212(''P'' + ''P'') = \u22122''P'' = \u22122''Q'' (second pane below with ''P'' shown for ''R'') is given by\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n    s &= \\frac{3{x_P}^2 + a}{2y_P}\\\\\n  x_R &= s^2 - 2x_P\\\\\n  y_R &= y_P + s(x_R - x_P)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n[[Image:ECClines.svg]]\n</div>\n\n==Elliptic curves over the complex numbers==\n[[Image:Lattice torsion points.svg|right|thumb|300px|An elliptic curve over the complex numbers is obtained as a quotient of the complex plane by a lattice \u039b, here spanned by two fundamental periods \u03c9<sub>1</sub> and \u03c9<sub>2</sub>. The four-torsion is also shown, corresponding to the lattice 1/4 \u039b containing \u039b.]]\nThe formulation of elliptic curves as the embedding of a [[torus]] in the [[complex projective plane]] follows naturally from a curious property of [[Weierstrass's elliptic functions]].  These functions and their first derivative are related by the formula\n\n:<math>\\wp'(z)^2 = 4\\wp(z)^3 -g_2\\wp(z) - g_3</math>\n\nHere, ''g''<sub>2</sub> and ''g''<sub>3</sub> are constants; <math>\\wp(z)</math> is the Weierstrass elliptic function and <math>\\wp'(z)</math> its derivative. It should be clear that this relation is in the form of an elliptic curve (over the [[complex number]]s). The Weierstrass functions are doubly periodic; that is, they are periodic with respect to a [[fundamental pair of periods|lattice]] \u039b; in essence, the Weierstrass functions are naturally defined on a torus  ''T'' = '''C'''/\u039b. This torus may be embedded in the complex projective plane by means of the map\n\n:<math>z \\mapsto [1 :\\wp(z) : \\wp'(z)/2]</math>\n\nThis map is a [[group isomorphism]] of the torus (considered with its natural group structure) with the chord-and-tangent group law on the cubic curve which is the image of this map.  It is also an isomorphism of [[Riemann surface]]s from the torus to the cubic curve, so topologically, an elliptic curve is a torus.  If the lattice \u039b is related by multiplication by a non-zero complex number ''c'' to a lattice ''c''\u039b, then the corresponding curves are isomorphic. Isomorphism classes of elliptic curves are specified by the [[j-invariant]].\n\nThe isomorphism classes can be understood in a simpler way as well. The constants ''g''<sub>2</sub> and ''g''<sub>3</sub>, called the [[j-invariant|modular invariant]]s, are uniquely determined by the lattice, that is, by the structure of the torus. However, the complex numbers form the [[splitting field]] for polynomials with real coefficients, and so the elliptic curve may be written as\n:<math>y^2 = x(x - 1)(x - \\lambda)</math>\n\nOne finds that\n:<math>g_2 = \\frac{4^{\\frac{1}{3}}}{3} (\\lambda^2 - \\lambda + 1)</math>\n\nand\n:<math>g_3 = \\frac{1}{27} (\\lambda + 1)(2\\lambda^2 - 5\\lambda + 2)</math>\n\nso that the [[modular discriminant]] is\n:<math>\\Delta = g_2^3 - 27g_3^2 = \\lambda^2(\\lambda - 1)^2</math>\n\nHere, \u03bb is sometimes called the [[modular lambda function]].\n\nNote that the [[uniformization theorem]] implies that every [[Compact space|compact]] Riemann surface of genus one can be represented as a torus.\n\nThis also allows an easy understanding of the [[torsion subgroup|torsion points]] on an elliptic curve: if the lattice \u039b is spanned by the fundamental periods \u03c9<sub>1</sub> and \u03c9<sub>2</sub>, then the ''n''-torsion points are the (equivalence classes of) points of the form\n:<math> \\frac{a}{n} \\omega_1 + \\frac{b}{n} \\omega_2</math>\n\nfor ''a'' and ''b'' integers in the range from 0 to ''n''\u22121.\n\nOver the complex numbers, every elliptic curve has nine [[inflection point]]s. Every line through two of these points also passes through a third inflection point; the nine points and 12 lines formed in this way form a realization of the [[Hesse configuration]].\n\n==Elliptic curves over the rational numbers==\nA curve ''E'' defined over the field of rational numbers is also defined over the field of real numbers. Therefore, the law of addition (of points with real coordinates) by the tangent and secant method can be applied to ''E''. The explicit formulae show that the sum of two points ''P'' and ''Q'' with rational coordinates has again rational coordinates, since the line joining ''P'' and ''Q'' has rational coefficients.<!--Il en est de m\u00eame pour le sym\u00e9trique par rapport \u00e0 l'axe des abscisses d'un point \u00e0 coordonn\u00e9es rationnelles.--> This way, one shows that the set of rational points of ''E'' forms a subgroup of the group of real points of ''E''. As this group, it is an [[abelian group]], that is, ''P'' + ''Q'' = ''Q'' + ''P''.\n\n===The structure of rational points===\nThe most important result is that all points can be constructed by the method of tangents and secants starting with a ''finite'' number of points. More precisely<ref>{{Harvard citations|author=Silverman|year=1986|nb=yes|loc=Theorem 4.1}}</ref> the [[Mordell\u2013Weil theorem]] states that the group ''E''('''Q''') is a [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] (abelian) group. By the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]] it is therefore a finite direct sum of copies of '''Z''' and finite cyclic groups.\n\nThe proof of that theorem<ref>{{Harvard citations|author=Silverman|year=1986|nb=yes|loc=pp. 199\u2013205}}</ref> rests on two ingredients: first, one shows that for any integer ''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1, the [[quotient group]] ''E''('''Q''')/''mE''('''Q''') is finite (weak Mordell\u2013Weil theorem). Second, introducing a [[height function]] ''h'' on the rational points ''E''('''Q''') defined by ''h''(''P''<sub>0</sub>) = 0 and {{math|''h''(''P'') {{=}} log max(&#124;''p''&#124;, &#124;''q''&#124;)}} if ''P'' (unequal to the point at infinity ''P''<sub>0</sub>) has as abscissa the rational number ''x'' = ''p''/''q'' (with [[coprime]] ''p'' and ''q''). This height function ''h'' has the property that ''h''(''mP'') grows roughly like the square of ''m''. Moreover, only finitely many rational points with height smaller than any constant exist on ''E''.\n\nThe proof of the theorem is thus a variant of the method of [[infinite descent]]<ref>See also J. W. S. Cassels, [[Mordell]]'s Finite Basis Theorem Revisited, ''Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society'' 100, 3\u201341 and the comment of A. Weil on the genesis of his work: A. Weil, ''Collected Papers'', vol. 1, 520\u2013521.</ref> and relies on the repeated application of [[Euclidean algorithm|Euclidean division]]s on ''E'': let ''P'' \u2208 ''E''('''Q''') be a rational point on the curve, writing ''P'' as the sum 2''P''<sub>1</sub> + ''Q''<sub>1</sub> where ''Q''<sub>1</sub> is a fixed representant of ''P'' in ''E''('''Q''')/2''E''('''Q'''), the height of ''P''<sub>1</sub> is about {{sfrac|1|4}} of the one of ''P'' (more generally, replacing 2 by any ''m'' > 1, and {{sfrac|1|4}} by {{sfrac|1|''m''<sup>2</sup>}}). Redoing the same with ''P''<sub>1</sub>, that is to say ''P''<sub>1</sub> = 2''P''<sub>2</sub> + ''Q''<sub>2</sub>, then ''P''<sub>2</sub> = 2''P''<sub>3</sub> + ''Q''<sub>3</sub>, etc. finally expresses ''P'' as an integral linear combination of points ''Q<sub>i</sub>'' and of points whose height is bounded by a fixed constant chosen in advance: by the weak Mordell\u2013Weil theorem and the second property of the height function ''P'' is thus expressed as an integral linear combination of a finite number of fixed points.\n\nSo far, the theorem is not effective since there is no known general procedure for determining the representants of ''E''('''Q''')/''mE''('''Q''').\n\nThe [[Rank of an abelian group|rank]] of ''E''('''Q'''), that is the number of copies of '''Z''' in ''E''('''Q''') or, equivalently, the number of independent points of infinite order, is called the ''rank'' of ''E''. The [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]] is concerned with determining the rank. One conjectures that it can be arbitrarily large, even if only examples with relatively small rank are known. The elliptic curve with biggest exactly known rank is\n:''y''<sup>2</sup> + ''xy'' + ''y'' = ''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x''<sup>2</sup> + {{gaps|31|368|015|812|338|065|133|318|565|292|206|590|792|820|353|345}}''x'' + {{gaps|302|038|802|698|566|087|335|643|188|429|543|498|624|522|041|683|874|493|555|186|062|568|159|847}}\n\nIt has rank 19, found by [[Noam Elkies]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/~duje/tors/rankhist.html|title=History of elliptic curves rank records|last=Dujella|first=Andrej|authorlink=Andrej Dujella|accessdate=|publisher = University of Zagreb}}</ref> Curves of rank at least 28 are known, but their rank is not exactly known.\n\nAs for the groups constituting the [[torsion subgroup]] of ''E''('''Q'''), the following is known:<ref>{{Harvard citations|author=Silverman|year=1986|nb=yes|loc=Theorem 7.5}}</ref> the torsion subgroup of ''E''('''Q''') is one of the 15 following groups ([[Mazur's torsion theorem|a theorem]] due to [[Barry Mazur]]): '''Z'''/''N'''''Z''' for ''N'' = 1, 2, ..., 10, or 12, or '''Z'''/2'''Z''' \u00d7 '''Z'''/2''N'''''Z''' with ''N'' = 1, 2, 3, 4. Examples for every case are known. Moreover, elliptic curves whose Mordell\u2013Weil groups over '''Q''' have the same torsion groups belong to a parametrized family.<ref>{{Harvard citations|author=Silverman|year=1986|nb=yes|loc=Remark 7.8 in Ch. VIII}}</ref>\n\n===The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture===\n{{Main|Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture}}\nThe ''Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture'' (BSD) is one of the [[Millennium problem]]s of the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]]. The conjecture relies on analytic and arithmetic objects defined by the elliptic curve in question.\n\nAt the analytic side, an important ingredient is a function of a complex variable, ''L'', the [[Hasse\u2013Weil zeta function]] of ''E'' over '''Q'''. This function is a variant of the [[Riemann zeta function]] and [[Dirichlet L-function]]s. It is defined as an [[Euler product]], with one factor for every [[prime number]] ''p''.\n\nFor a curve ''E'' over '''Q''' given by a minimal equation\n:<math>y^2 + a_1xy + a_3y = x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_4x + a_6</math>\n\nwith integral coefficients ''a<sub>i</sub>'', reducing the coefficients [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''p'' defines an elliptic curve over the [[finite field]] '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub> (except for a finite number of primes ''p'', where the reduced curve has a [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] and thus fails to be elliptic, in which case ''E'' is said to be of [[bad reduction]] at ''p'').\n\nThe zeta function of an elliptic curve over a finite field '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub> is, in some sense, a [[generating function]] assembling the information of the number of points of ''E'' with values in the finite [[field extension]]s of '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>, '''F'''<sub>''p<sup>n</sup>''</sub>. It is given,<ref>The definition is formal, the exponential of this [[power series]] without constant term denotes the usual development.</ref>\n:<math>Z(E(\\mathbf{F}_p)) = \\exp \\left(\\sum \\mathrm{card} \\left[E({\\mathbf F}_{p^n})\\right]\\frac{T^n}{n}\\right)</math>\n\nThe interior sum of the exponential resembles the development of the [[logarithm]] and, in fact, the so-defined zeta function is a [[rational function]]:\n:<math>Z(E(\\mathbf{F}_p)) = \\frac{1 - a_pT + pT^2}{(1 - T)(1 - pT)}</math>\n\nThe [[Hasse\u2013Weil zeta function]] of ''E'' over '''Q''' is then defined by collecting this information together, for all primes ''p''. It is defined by\n:<math>L(E(\\mathbf{Q}), s) = \\prod_p \\left(1 - a_p p^{-s} + \\varepsilon(p)p^{1 - 2s}\\right)^{-1}</math>\n\nwhere \u03b5(''p'') = 1 if ''E'' has good reduction at ''p'' and 0 otherwise (in which case ''a<sub>p</sub>'' is defined differently than above).\n\nThis product [[absolute convergence|converges]] for Re(''s'') > 3/2 only. Hasse's conjecture affirms that the ''L''-function admits an [[analytic continuation]] to the whole complex plane and satisfies a [[functional equation]] relating, for any ''s'', ''L''(''E'', ''s'') to ''L''(''E'', 2 \u2212 ''s''). In 1999 this was shown to be a consequence of the proof of the Shimura\u2013Taniyama\u2013Weil conjecture, which asserts that every elliptic curve over ''Q'' is a [[modular curve]], which implies that its ''L''-function is the ''L''-function of a [[modular form]] whose analytic continuation is known.\n\nOne can therefore speak about the values of ''L''(''E'', ''s'') at any complex number ''s''. The Birch\u2013Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture relates the arithmetic of the curve to the behavior of its ''L''-function at ''s'' = 1. More precisely, it affirms that the order of the ''L''-function at ''s'' = 1 equals the rank of ''E'' and predicts the leading term of the Laurent series of ''L''(''E'', ''s'') at that point in terms of several quantities attached to the elliptic curve.\n\nMuch like the [[Riemann hypothesis]], this conjecture has multiple consequences, including the following two:\n* Let ''n'' be an odd [[square-free integer]]. Assuming the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, ''n'' is the area of a right triangle with rational side lengths (a [[congruent number]]) if and only if the number of triplets of integers (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') satisfying <math>2x^2 + y^2 + 8z^2 = n</math> is twice the number of triples satisfying <math>2x^2 + y^2 + 32z^2 = n</math>. This statement, due to [[Tunnell's theorem|Tunnell]], is related to the fact that ''n'' is a congruent number if and only if the elliptic curve <math>y^2 = x^3 - n^2x</math> has a rational point of infinite order (thus, under the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, its ''L''-function has a zero at 1). The interest in this statement is that the condition is easily verified.<ref>{{Harvard citations|author=Koblitz|year=1993|nb=yes}}</ref>\n*In a different direction, certain analytic methods allow for an estimation of the order of zero in the center of the [[critical strip]] of families of ''L''-functions. Admitting the BSD conjecture, these estimations correspond to information about the rank of families of elliptic curves in question. For example:<ref>D. R. Heath-Brown, The average analytic rank of elliptic curves, ''Duke Mathematical Journal'' 122\u20133, 591\u2013623 (2004).</ref> suppose the [[generalized Riemann hypothesis]] and the BSD conjecture, the average rank of curves given by <math>y^2=x^3+ax+b</math> is smaller than 2.\n\n===The modularity theorem and its application to Fermat's Last Theorem===\n{{Main|Modularity theorem}}\nThe modularity theorem, once known as the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture, states that every elliptic curve ''E'' over '''Q''' is a [[modular curve]], that is to say, its Hasse\u2013Weil zeta function is the ''L''-function of a [[modular form]] of weight 2 and level ''N'', where ''N'' is the [[Conductor of an abelian variety|conductor]] of ''E'' (an integer divisible by the same prime numbers as the discriminant of ''E'', \u0394(''E'').) In other words, if, for Re(''s'') > 3/2, one writes the ''L''-function in the form\n:<math>L(E(\\mathbf{Q}), s) = \\sum_{n>0}a(n)n^{-s}</math>\n\nthe expression\n:<math>\\sum a(n) q^n, \\qquad q = \\exp(2 \\pi i z)</math>\n\ndefines a parabolic modular [[newform]] of weight 2 and level ''N''. For prime numbers \u2113 not dividing ''N'', the coefficient ''a''(\u2113) of the form equals \u2113 minus the number of solutions of the minimal equation of the curve modulo \u2113.\n\nFor example,<ref>For the calculations, see for example D. Zagier, \u00ab Modular points, modular curves, modular surfaces and modular forms \u00bb, ''Lecture Notes in Mathematics'' 1111, Springer, 1985, 225\u2013248.</ref> to the elliptic curve <math>y^2 - y = x^3 -x</math> with discriminant (and conductor) 37, is associated the form\n:<math>f(z) = q - 2q^2 - 3q^3 + 2q^4 - 2q^5 + 6q^6 + \\cdots, \\qquad q = \\exp(2 \\pi i z)</math>\n\nFor prime numbers \u2113 not equal to 37, one can verify the property about the coefficients. Thus, for \u2113 = 3, there are 6 solutions of the equation modulo 3: (0, 0), (0, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1); thus ''a''(3) = 3 \u2212 6 = \u22123.\n\nThe conjecture, going back to the 1950s, was completely proven by 1999 using ideas of [[Andrew Wiles]], who proved it in 1994 for a large family of elliptic curves.<ref>A synthetic presentation (in French) of the main ideas can be found in [http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/SB/SB_1994-1995__37_/SB_1994-1995__37__319_0/SB_1994-1995__37__319_0.pdf this] [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] article of [[Jean-Pierre Serre]]. For more details see {{Harvard citations |last=Hellegouarch |year=2001 |nb=yes}}</ref>\n\nThere are several formulations of the conjecture. Showing that they are equivalent is difficult and was a main topic of number theory in the second half of the 20th century. The modularity of an elliptic curve ''E'' of conductor ''N'' can be expressed also by saying that there is a non-constant [[rational map]] defined over '''Q''', from the modular curve ''X''<sub>0</sub>(''N'') to ''E''. In particular, the points of ''E'' can be parametrized by [[modular function]]s.\n\nFor example, a modular parametrization of the curve <math>y^2 - y = x^3 - x</math> is given by<ref>D. Zagier, \u00ab Modular points, modular curves, modular surfaces and modular forms \u00bb, ''Lecture Notes in Mathematics'' 1111, Springer, 1985, 225\u2013248.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  x(z) &= q^{-2} + 2q^{-1} + 5 + 9q + 18q^2 + 29q^3 + 51q^4 +\\ldots\\\\\n  y(z) &= q^{-3} + 3q^{-2} + 9q^{-1} + 21 + 46q + 92q^2 + 180q^3 +\\ldots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere, as above, ''q'' = exp(2\u03c0''iz''). The functions ''x(z)'' and ''y(z)'' are modular of weight 0 and level 37; in other words they are [[meromorphic]], defined on the [[upper half-plane]] Im(''z'') > 0 and satisfy\n:<math>x\\!\\left(\\frac{az + b}{cz + d}\\right) = x(z)</math>\n\nand likewise for ''y(z)'' for all integers ''a, b, c, d'' with ''ad'' \u2212 ''bc'' = 1 and 37|''c''.\n\nAnother formulation depends on the comparison of [[Galois representation]]s attached on the one hand to elliptic curves, and on the other hand to modular forms. The latter formulation has been used in the proof the conjecture. Dealing with the level of the forms (and the connection to the conductor of the curve) is particularly delicate.\n\nThe most spectacular application of the conjecture is the proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] (FLT). Suppose that for a prime ''p'' \u2265 5, the Fermat equation\n:<math>a^p + b^p = c^p</math>\n\nhas a solution with non-zero integers, hence a counter-example to FLT. Then the elliptic curve\n:<math>y^2 = x(x - a^p)(x + b^p)</math>\n\nof discriminant\n:<math>\\Delta = \\frac{1}{256}(abc)^{2p}</math>\n\ncannot be modular.<ref name=\"ribet\">{{cite journal|last=Ribet|first=Ken|authorlink=Ken Ribet|title=On modular representations of Gal({{overline|'''Q'''}}/'''Q''') arising from modular forms|journal=Inventiones Mathematicae|volume=100|year=1990|issue=2|pages=431\u2013476|doi=10.1007/BF01231195|mr=1047143|url=http://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/Articles/invent_100.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Thus, the proof of the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture for this family of elliptic curves (called Hellegouarch\u2013Frey curves) implies FLT. The proof of the link between these two statements, based on an idea of [[Gerhard Frey]] (1985), is difficult and technical. It was established by [[Kenneth Ribet]] in 1987.<ref>See the survey of K. Ribet \u00abFrom the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture to Fermat's Last Theorem\u00bb, Annales de la Facult\u00e9 des sciences de Toulouse 11 (1990), 116\u2013139.</ref>\n\n===Integral points===\nThis section is concerned with points ''P'' = (''x'', ''y'') of ''E'' such that ''x'' is an integer.<ref>{{Harvard citations|author=Silverman|year=1986|nb=yes|loc=Chapter IX}}</ref> The following theorem is due to [[C.

In particular, the group ''E(K)'' of ''K''-rational points of an elliptic curve ''E'' defined over ''K'' is finitely generated, which generalizes the Mordell\u2013Weil theorem above. A theorem due to [[Lo\u00efc Merel]] shows that for a given integer ''d'', there are ([[up to]] isomorphism) only finitely many groups that can occur as the torsion groups of ''E''(''K'') for an elliptic curve defined over a number field ''K'' of [[degree of a field extension|degree]] ''d''. More precisely,<ref>{{cite journal |first=L. |last=Merel | authorlink=Lo\u00efc Merel | title=Bornes pour la torsion des courbes elliptiques sur les corps de nombres | language=French | journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]] |volume=124 |year=1996 |issue=1\u20133 |pages=437\u2013449 | zbl=0936.11037 | doi=10.1007/s002220050059 }}</ref> there is a number ''B''(''d'') such that for any elliptic curve ''E'' defined over a number field ''K'' of degree ''d'', any torsion point of ''E''(''K'') is of [[order (group theory)|order]] less than ''B''(''d''). The theorem is effective: for ''d'' > 1, if a torsion point is of order ''p'', with ''p'' prime, then\n:<math>p < d^{3d^2}</math>\n\nAs for the integral points, Siegel's theorem generalizes to the following: Let ''E'' be an elliptic curve defined over a number field ''K'', ''x'' and ''y'' the Weierstrass coordinates. Then there are only finitely many points of ''E(K)'' whose ''x''-coordinate is in the [[ring of integers]] ''O''<sub>''K''</sub>.\n\nThe properties of the Hasse\u2013Weil zeta function and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture can also be extended to this more general situation.\n\n==Elliptic curves over a general field==\nElliptic curves can be defined over any [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K''; the formal definition of an elliptic curve is a non-singular projective algebraic curve over ''K'' with [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] 1 and endowed with a distinguished point defined over ''K''.\n\nIf the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of ''K'' is neither 2 nor 3, then every elliptic curve over ''K'' can be written in the form\n:<math>y^2 = x^3 - px - q</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' and ''q'' are elements of ''K'' such that the right hand side polynomial ''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''px'' \u2212 ''q'' does not have any double roots. If the characteristic is 2 or 3, then more terms need to be kept: in characteristic 3, the most general equation is of the form\n:<math>y^2 = 4x^3 + b_2 x^2 + 2b_4 x + b_6</math>\n\nfor arbitrary constants ''b''<sub>2</sub>, ''b''<sub>4</sub>, ''b''<sub>6</sub> such that the polynomial on the right-hand side has distinct roots (the notation is chosen for historical reasons).  In characteristic 2, even this much is not possible, and the most general equation is\n\n:<math>y^2 + a_1 xy + a_3 y = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_4 x + a_6</math>\n\nprovided that the variety it defines is non-singular. If characteristic were not an obstruction, each equation would reduce to the previous ones by a suitable change of variables.\n\nOne typically takes the curve to be the set of all points (''x'',''y'') which satisfy the above equation and such that both ''x'' and ''y'' are elements of the [[algebraic closure]] of ''K''. Points of the curve whose coordinates both belong to ''K'' are called '''''K''-rational points'''.\n\n==Isogeny==\n{{Further|Isogeny}}\nLet ''E'' and ''D'' be elliptic curves over a field ''k''. An ''isogeny'' between ''E'' and ''D'' is a [[finite morphism]] ''f'' : ''E'' \u2192 ''D'' of [[Abelian variety|varieties]] that preserves basepoints (in other words, maps the given point on ''E'' to that on ''D'').\n\nThe two curves are called ''isogenous'' if there is an isogeny between them. This is an [[equivalence relation]], [[symmetric|symmetry]] being due to the existence of the [[dual isogeny]]. Every isogeny is an algebraic [[homomorphism]] and thus induces homomorphisms of the [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] of the elliptic curves for ''k''-valued points.\n\n==Elliptic curves over finite fields==\n{{Further|arithmetic of abelian varieties}}\n\n[[File:Elliptic curve on Z61.svg|thumb|right|275px|Set of affine points of elliptic curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x'' over finite field '''F'''<sub>61</sub>.]]\n\nLet ''K'' = '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub> be the [[finite field]] with ''q'' elements and ''E'' an elliptic curve defined over ''K''. While the precise [[Counting points on elliptic curves|number of rational points of an elliptic curve]] ''E'' over ''K'' is in general rather difficult to compute, [[Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves]] gives us, including the point at infinity, the following estimate:\n:<math>|\\mathrm{card} E(K) - (q + 1) | \\le 2\\sqrt{q}</math>\n\nIn other words, the number of points of the curve grows roughly as the number of elements in the field. This fact can be understood and proven with the help of some general theory; see [[local zeta function]], [[\u00c9tale cohomology]].\n\n[[File:Elliptic curve on Z89.svg|thumb|left|275px|Set of affine points of elliptic curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x'' over finite field '''F'''<sub>89</sub>.]]\n\nThe set of points ''E''('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>) is a finite abelian group.

The number of points on a specific curve can be computed with [[Schoof's algorithm]].\n\nStudying the curve over the [[field extension]]s of '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub> is facilitated by the introduction of the local zeta function of ''E'' over '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>, defined by a generating series (also see above)\n:<math>Z(E(K), T) \\equiv \\exp \\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{card} \\left[E(K_n)\\right] {T^n\\over n} \\right)</math>\n\nwhere the field ''K<sub>n</sub>'' is the (unique up to isomorphism) extension of ''K'' = '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub> of degree ''n'' (that is,  '''F'''<sub>''q<sup>n</sup>''</sub>). The zeta function is a rational function in ''T''. There is an integer ''a'' such that\n\n:<math>Z(E(K), T) = \\frac{1 - aT + qT^2}{(1 - qT)(1 - T)}</math>\n\nMoreover,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  Z \\left(E(K), \\frac{1}{qT} \\right) &= Z(E(K), T)\\\\\n         \\left(1 - aT + qT^2 \\right) &= (1 - \\alpha T)(1 - \\beta T)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwith complex numbers \u03b1, \u03b2 of [[absolute value]] <math>\\sqrt{q}</math>. This result is a special case of the [[Weil conjectures]]. For example,<ref>{{Harvard citations|last=Koblitz|year=1994|nb=yes|loc=p. 160}}</ref> the zeta function of ''E'' : ''y''<sup>2</sup> + ''y'' = ''x''<sup>3</sup> over the field '''F'''<sub>2</sub> is given by\n:<math>\\frac{1 + 2T^2}{(1 - T)(1 - 2T)}</math>\n\nthis follows from:\n:<math> \\left| E(\\mathbf{F}_{2^r}) \\right| = \\begin{cases} 2^r + 1 & r \\text{ odd} \\\\ 2^r + 1 - 2(-2)^{\\frac{r}{2}} & r \\text{ even} \\end{cases} </math>\n\n[[File:Elliptic curve on Z71.svg|thumb|right|350px|Set of affine points of elliptic curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x'' over finite field '''F'''<sub>71</sub>.]]\n\nThe [[Sato\u2013Tate conjecture]] is a statement about how the error term <math>2\\sqrt{q}</math> in Hasse's theorem varies with the different primes ''q'', if an elliptic curve E over '''Q''' is reduced modulo q. It was proven (for almost all such curves) in 2006 due to the results of Taylor, Harris and Shepherd-Barron,<ref>{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Harris |first2=N. |last2=Shepherd-Barron |first3=R. |last3=Taylor |title=A family of Calabi\u2013Yau varieties and potential automorphy |journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |volume=171 |issue=2 |pages=779\u2013813|year=2010 |doi=10.4007/annals.2010.171.779 }}</ref> and says that the error terms are equidistributed.\n\nElliptic curves over finite fields are notably applied in [[cryptography]] and for the [[factorization]] of large integers. These algorithms often make use of the group structure on the points of ''E''. Algorithms that are applicable to general groups, for example the group of invertible elements in finite fields, '''F'''*<sub>''q''</sub>, can thus be applied to the group of points on an elliptic curve. For example, the [[discrete logarithm]] is such an algorithm. The interest in this is that choosing an elliptic curve allows for more flexibility than choosing ''q'' (and thus the group of units in '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>). Also, the group structure of elliptic curves is generally more complicated.\n<!--{{Voir aussi|Factorisation en courbe elliptique de Lenstra|Cryptologie sur les courbes elliptiques|Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm}}-->\n\n==Applications==\n* [[Elliptic curve cryptography]]\n\n==Algorithms that use elliptic curves==\nElliptic curves over finite fields are used in some [[cryptography|cryptographic]] applications as well as for [[integer factorization]].

It was 15 years before the personal computer became familiar to the general public, and three decades before most people encountered attempts at [[natural language processing]] in Internet services like [[Ask.com]] or PC help systems such as Microsoft Office [[Office Assistant|Clippit]]. Although those programs included years of research and work, ELIZA remains a milestone simply because it was the first time a programmer had attempted such a human-machine interaction with the goal of creating the illusion (however brief) of human-''human'' interaction.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nAt the [[International Conference on Computer Communications|ICCC 1972]] ELIZA met another early artificial intelligence program named [[PARRY]] and had a computer-only conversation. While ELIZA was built to be a \"Doctor\" PARRY was intended to simulate a patient with [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=\"PerryElizaAtlantic\">{{cite web|last1=Megan|first1=Garber|title=When PARRY Met ELIZA: A Ridiculous Chatbot Conversation From 1972|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/when-parry-met-eliza-a-ridiculous-chatbot-conversation-from-1972/372428/|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=19 January 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118165304/http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/when-parry-met-eliza-a-ridiculous-chatbot-conversation-from-1972/372428/|archivedate=2017-01-18|dead-url=no|date=Jun 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n\nWeizenbaum originally wrote ELIZA in MAD-Slip for the IBM 7094, as a program to make natural language conversation possible with a computer. To accomplish this, Weizenbaum identified five \"fundamental technical problems\" for ELIZA to overcome: the identification of critical words, the discovery of a minimal context, the choice of appropriate transformations, the generation of responses appropriate to the transformation or in the absence of critical words and the provision of an ending capacity for ELIZA scripts.<ref name=\":1\" /> Weizenbaum solved these problems in his ELIZA program and made ELIZA such that it had no built in contextual framework or universe of discourse.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, this required ELIZA to have a script of instructions on how to respond to inputs from users.\n\nELIZA starts its process of responding to an input by a user by first examining the text input for a \"keyword\". A \"keyword\" is a word designated as important by the acting ELIZA script, which assigns to each keyword a precedence number, or a RANK, designed by the programmer.<ref name=\":3\" /> If such words are found, they are put into a \"keystack\", with the keyword of the highest RANK at the top. The input sentence is then manipulated and transformed as the rule associated with the keyword of the highest RANK directs.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, when the DOCTOR script encounters words such as \"alike\" or \"same\", it would output a message pertaining to similarity, in this case \u201cIn what way?\u201d,<ref name=\":2\" /> as these words had high precedence number. This also demonstrates how certain words, as dictated by the script, can be manipulated regardless of contextual considerations, such as switching first-person pronouns and second-person pronouns and vice versa, as these too had high precedence numbers. Such words with high precedence numbers are deemed superior to conversational patterns, and are treated independently of contextual patterns.\n\nFollowing the first examination, the next step of the process is to apply an appropriate transformation rule, which includes two parts, the \"decomposition rule\" and the \"reassembly rule\".<ref name=\":1\" /> First, the input is reviewed for syntactical patterns in order to establish the minimal context necessary to respond. Using the keywords and other nearby words from the input, different disassembly rules are tested until an appropriate pattern is found. Using the script's rules, the sentence is then \"dismantled\" and arranged into sections of the component parts as the \"decomposition rule for the highest ranking keyword\" dictates. The example that Weizenbaum gives is the input \"I are very helpful\" (remembering that \"I\" is \"You\" transformed), which is broken into (1) empty (2) I (3) are (4) very helpful. The decomposition rule has broken the phrase into four small segments, that contain both the keywords and the information in the sentence.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe decomposition rule then designates a particular reassembly rule, or set of reassembly rules, to follow when reconstructing the sentence. The reassembly rule then takes the fragments of the input that the decomposition rule had created, rearranges them, and adds in programmed words to create a response. Using Weizenbaum's example previously stated, such a reassembly rule would take the fragments and apply them to the phrase \"What makes you think I am (4)\" which would result in \"What makes you think I am very helpful\". This example is rather simple, since depending upon the disassembly rule, the output could be significantly more complex and use more of the input from the user. However, from this reassembly, ELIZA then sends the constructed sentence to the user in the form of text on the screen.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThese steps represent the bulk of the procedures which ELIZA follows in order to create a response from a typical input, though there are several specialized situations that ELIZA/DOCTOR can respond to. One Weizenbaum specifically wrote about was when there is not a keyword. One solution was to have ELIZA respond with a remark that lacked content, such as \"I see\" or \"Please go on\".<ref name=\":1\" /> The second method was to use a \"MEMORY\" structure, which recorded prior recent inputs, and would use these inputs to create a response referencing a part of the earlier conversation when encountered with no keywords.<ref name=\":5\" /> This was possible due to Slip\u2019s ability to tag words for other usage, which simultaneously allowed ELIZA to examine, store and repurpose words for usage in outputs.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhile these functions were all framed in ELIZA's programming, the exact manner by which the program dismantled, examined, and reassembled inputs is determined by the operating script. However, the script is not static, and can be edited, or a new one created, as is necessary for the operation in the context needed (thus how ELIZA can \"learn\" new information). This also allows the program to be applied in multiple situations, including the well-known DOCTOR script, which simulates a Rogerian psychotherapist, but also a script called \"STUDENT\", which is capable of taking in logical analysis parameters and using it to give the answers to problems of related logic.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0020-7373(77)80016-3 |title=A response to Donald Michie |journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=503\u20135 |year=1977 |last1=Weizenbaum |first1=J. }}</ref>\n\n==Significant implementations==\nWeizenbaum's original [[MAD (programming language)|MAD]]-[[SLIP (programming language)|SLIP]] implementation was re-written in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] by Bernie Cosell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codersatwork.com/bernie-cosell.html|title=Coders at Work: Bernie Cosell|website=www.codersatwork.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://elizagen.org/index.html|title=elizagen.org|website=elizagen.org}}</ref> A [[BASIC]] version appeared in [[Creative Computing]] in 1977 (although it was written in 1973 by Jeff Shrager).<ref>[http://www.atariarchives.org/bigcomputergames/showpage.php?page=20 Big Computer Games: Eliza - Your own psychotherapist] at www.atariarchives.org</ref> This version, which was ported to many of the earliest personal computers, appears to have been subsequently translated into many other versions in many other languages.\n\nAnother version of Eliza popular among software engineers is the version that comes with the default release of [[GNU Emacs]], and which can be accessed by typing <code>[[Meta key|M]]-x doctor</code> from most modern emacs implementations.\n\n==In popular culture==\nELIZA influenced a number of early [[computer games]] by demonstrating additional kinds of [[interface design]]s. [[Don Daglow]] wrote an enhanced version of the program called ''[[Ecala]]'' on a [[DEC PDP-10]] [[minicomputer]] at [[Pomona College]] in 1973 before writing the computer [[role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeon (computer game)|Dungeon]]'' (1975).\n\nIn the 2008 anime RD Sennou Chousashitsu, aka \"[[Real Drive]],\" a character named Eliza Weizenbaum appears, an obvious tribute to ELIZA and [[Joseph Weizenbaum]].

In the independent documentary film ''[[Plug & Pray]]'' (2010) Weizenbaum said that only people who misunderstood ELIZA called it a sensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html|title=Content: Plug & Pray Film - Artificial Intelligence - Robots - [maschafilm]|first=|last=maschafilm|website=www.plugandpray-film.de}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Israel]]i poet [[David Avidan]], who was fascinated with future technologies and their relation to art, desired to explore the use of computers for writing literature.

The 1980 game ''[[The Prisoner (computer game)|The Prisoner]]'' incorporated ELIZA-style interaction within its gameplay. [[George Lucas]] and [[Walter Murch]] incorporated an Eliza-like dialogue interface in their screenplay for the feature film ''[[THX-1138]]'' in 1969. Inhabitants of the underground future world of THX would retreat to \"confession booths\" when stressed, and initiate a one-sided Eliza-formula conversation with a Jesus-faced computer who claimed to be \"Omm\". In 1988 the British artist and friend of Weizenbaum [[Brian Reffin Smith]] created and showed at the exhibition \"Salamandre\", in the Mus\u00e9e du Berry, [[Bourges]], France, two art-oriented ELIZA-style programs written in [[BASIC]], one called \"Critic\" and the other \"Artist\", running on two separate [[Amiga 1000]] computers. The visitor was supposed to help them converse by typing in to \"Artist\" what \"Critic\" said, and vice versa. The secret was that the two programs were identical. [[GNU Emacs]] formerly had a <code>psychoanalyze-pinhead</code> [[Command (computing)|command]] that simulates a session between ELIZA and [[Zippy the Pinhead]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/library/lol/pinhead.html|title=lol:> psychoanalyze-pinhead}}</ref> The Zippyisms were removed due to copyright issues, but the DOCTOR program remains.\n\nELIZA has been referenced in popular culture and continues to be a source of inspiration for programmers and developers focused on Artificial Intelligence. It was also featured in a 2012 exhibit at [[Harvard University]] titled \"Go Ask A.L.I.C.E\", as part of a celebration of mathematician [[Alan Turing]]'s 100th birthday. The exhibit explores Turing's lifelong fascination with the interaction between humans and computers, pointing to ELIZA as one of the earliest realizations of Turing's ideas.<ref name=turing/>.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of chatterbots]]\n* [[ELIZA effect]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{McCorduck 2004}}\n* {{Citation | last = Weizenbaum | first = Joseph | authorlink = Joseph Weizenbaum | year = 1976 | title = [[Computer Power and Human Reason|Computer power and human reason: from judgment to calculation]] | isbn = 0-7167-0463-3 | publisher = [[W.H.

Some variants are commonly referred to as '''square-and-multiply''' algorithms or '''binary exponentiation'''. These can be of quite general use, for example in [[modular arithmetic]] or powering of matrices. For semigroups for which [[Abelian group#Notation|additive notation]] is commonly used, like [[elliptic curve]]s used in [[cryptography]], this method is also referred to as '''double-and-add'''.\n\n==Basic method==\n\nThe method is based on the observation that, for a positive integer ''n'', we have\n:<math> x^n=     \n    \\begin{cases}\n                x \\, ( x^{2})^{\\frac{n - 1}{2}}, & \\mbox{if } n \\mbox{ is odd} \\\\\n                (x^{2})^{\\frac{n}{2}} , & \\mbox{if } n \\mbox{ is even}.\n     \\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThis method uses the bits of the exponent to determine which powers are computed.\n\nThis example shows how to compute <math>x^{13}</math> using this method.\nThe exponent, 13, is 1101 in binary. The bits are used in left to right order.\nThe exponent has 4 bits, so there are 4 iterations.\n\nFirst, initialize the result to 1: <math>r \\leftarrow 1 \\, ( = x^0)</math>.\n: Step 1) <math>r \\leftarrow r^2 \\, ( = x^0)</math>; bit 1 = 1, so compute <math>r \\leftarrow r \\cdot x \\,( = x^1)</math>;\n: Step 2) <math>r \\leftarrow r^2 \\, ( = x^2)</math>; bit 2 = 1, so compute <math>r \\leftarrow r \\cdot x \\, ( = x^3)</math>;\n: Step 3) <math>r \\leftarrow r^2 \\, ( = x^6)</math>; bit 3 = 0, so we are done with this step;\n: Step 4) <math>r \\leftarrow r^2 \\, ( = x^{12})</math>; bit 4 = 1, so compute <math>r \\leftarrow r \\cdot x \\, ( = x^{13})</math>.\n\nThis may be implemented as the following [[recursion (computer science)|recursive algorithm]]: \n<source lang=\"pascal\">\n  Function exp_by_squaring(x, n)\n    if n < 0  then return exp_by_squaring(1 / x, -n);\n    else if n = 0  then return  1;\n    else if n = 1  then return  x ;\n    else if n is even  then return exp_by_squaring(x * x,  n / 2);\n    else if n is odd  then return x * exp_by_squaring(x * x, (n - 1) / 2);\n</source>\n\nAlthough not [[Tail call|tail-recursive]], this algorithm may be rewritten into a tail recursive algorithm by introducing an auxiliary function:\n\n<source lang=\"pascal\">\n  Function exp_by_squaring(x, n)\n    exp_by_squaring2(1, x, n)\n  Function exp_by_squaring2(y, x, n)\n    if n < 0  then return exp_by_squaring2(y, 1 / x, - n);\n    else if n = 0  then return  y;\n    else if n = 1  then return  x * y;\n    else if n is even  then return exp_by_squaring2(y, x * x,  n / 2);\n    else if n is odd  then return exp_by_squaring2(x * y, x * x, (n - 1) / 2).\n</source>\n\nThe iterative version of the algorithm also uses a bounded auxiliary space, and is given by\n\n<source lang=\"pascal\">\n  Function exp_by_squaring_iterative(x, n)\n    if n < 0 then\n      x := 1 / x;\n      n := -n;\n    if n = 0 then return 1\n    y := 1;\n    while n > 1 do\n      if n is even then \n        x := x * x;\n        n := n / 2;\n      else\n        y := x * y;\n        x := x * x;\n        n := (n \u2013 1) / 2;\n    return x * y\n</source>\n\n==Computational complexity==\n\nA brief analysis shows that such an algorithm uses <math>\\lfloor \\log_2n\\rfloor</math> squarings and at most <math>\\lfloor \\log_2n\\rfloor</math> multiplications, where <math>\\lfloor\\;\\rfloor</math> denotes the [[floor function]]. More precisely, the number of multiplications is one less than the number of ones present in the [[binary expansion]] of ''n''. For ''n'' greater than about 4 this is computationally more efficient than naively multiplying the base with itself repeatedly.\n\nEach squaring results in approximately double the number of digits of the previous, and so, if multiplication of two ''d'' digit numbers is implemented in O(''d''<sup>''k''</sup>) operations for some fixed ''k'' then the complexity of computing ''x''<sup>''n''</sup> is given by:\n\n:<math> \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{O(\\log(n))} (2^i O(\\log(x)))^k = O((n \\log(x))^k)  \n</math>\n\n==2<sup>k</sup>-ary method==\nThis algorithm calculates the value of x<sup>n</sup> after expanding the exponent in base  2<sup>k</sup>. It was first proposed by [[Brauer]] in 1939. In the algorithm below we make use of the following function f(0) = (k,0) and f(m) = (s,u) where m = u\u00b72<sup>s</sup>\nwith ''u'' odd.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\n;Input: An element x of G, a parameter k > 0, a non-negative integer {{math|1=''n'' = (''n''<sub>''l''\u22121</sub>, ''n''<sub>''l''\u22122</sub>, ..., ''n''<sub>0</sub>)<sub>2<sup>''k''</sup></sub>}} and the precomputed values <math style=\"vertical-align:baseline;\">x^3, x^5, ... , x^{2^k-1}</math>.\n\n;Output: The element x<sup>n</sup> in ''G''\n\n y := 1; i := l-1\n '''while''' i>=0 do\n     (s,u) := f(n<sub>i</sub>)\n     '''for''' j:=1 '''to''' k-s '''do'''\n         y := y<sup>2</sup> \n     y := y*x<sup>u</sup>\n     '''for''' j:=1 '''to''' s '''do'''\n         y := y<sup>2</sup>\n     i := i-1\n '''return''' y\n\nFor optimal efficiency, ''k'' should be the smallest integer satisfying <ref name=\"frey\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Cohen |editor1-first=H. |editor2-last=Frey, G. |date=2006 |title=Handbook of Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography |series=Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications |publisher=Chapman & Hall/CRC |isbn=9781584885184}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\log(n) < \\frac{k(k+1) \\cdot 2^{2k}}{2^{k+1} - k - 2} + 1.</math>\n\n==Sliding window method==\nThis method is an efficient variant of the 2<sup>k</sup>-ary method.

Namely, an attacker observing the sequence of squarings and multiplications can (partially) recover the exponent involved in the computation.

It can also be used to compute integer powers in a [[group (mathematics)|group]], using the rule\n\n:Power(''x'', \u2212''n'') = (Power(''x'', ''n''))<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThe method works in every [[semigroup]] and is often used to compute powers of [[matrix (math)|matrices]].\n\nFor example, the evaluation of\n\n:13789<sup>722341</sup> (mod 2345)\n\nwould take a very long time and lots of storage space if the na\u00efve method were used: compute 13789<sup>722341</sup> then take the [[remainder]] when divided by 2345. Even using a more effective method will take a long time: square 13789, take the remainder when divided by 2345, multiply the [[result]] by 13789, and so on. This will take less than <math>2\\log_2(722340)\\leq 40</math> modular multiplications.\n\nApplying above ''exp-by-squaring'' algorithm, with \"*\" interpreted as ''x''*''y'' = ''xy'' mod 2345 (that is a multiplication followed by a division with remainder) leads to only 27 multiplications and divisions of integers which may all be stored in a single machine word.\n\n==Example implementations==\n\n===Computation by powers of 2===\nThis is a non-recursive implementation of the above algorithm in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]].\n\nn=n-1 is redundant when n=n/2 implicitly rounds towards zero, as lower level languages would do.\nn[0] is the rightmost bit of the binary representation of n, so if it is 1, the number is odd, if it is zero, the number is even.

Note that a\u00d7b is calculated twice; the result could be stored after the first calculation, which reduces the count of multiplication to 5.\n\nExample with numbers:\n:2<sup>7</sup>\u00d73<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;((2\u00d73)<sup>2</sup>\u00d72)<sup>2</sup>\u00d72\u00d73&nbsp;=&nbsp;(6<sup>2</sup>\u00d72)<sup>2</sup>\u00d76&nbsp;=&nbsp;72<sup>2</sup>\u00d76&nbsp;=&nbsp;31,104\n\nCalculating the powers simultaneously instead of calculating them separately always reduces the\ncount of multiplications if at least two of the exponents are greater than 1.\n\n====Using transformation====\nThe example above a<sup>7</sup>\u00d7b<sup>5</sup> may also be calculated with only 5\nmultiplications if the expression is transformed before calculation:\n\na<sup>7</sup>\u00d7b<sup>5</sup> = a<sup>2</sup>\u00d7(ab)<sup>5</sup> with ab := a\u00d7b\n<dl>\n<dd>ab := a<span style=\"color:red;\">\u00d7</span>b (one multiplication)</dd>\n<dd>a<sup>2</sup>\u00d7(ab)<sup>5</sup> = ((ab)<span style=\"color:red;\"><sup>2</sup>\u00d7</span>a)<span style=\"color:red;\"><sup>2</sup>\u00d7</span>ab (four multiplications)</dd>\n</dl>\n\nGeneralization of transformation shows the following scheme:<br>\nFor calculating a<sup>A</sup>\u00d7b<sup>B</sup>\u00d7...\u00d7m<sup>M</sup>\u00d7n<sup>N</sup><br>\n1st: define ab := a\u00d7b, abc = ab\u00d7c, ...<br>\n2nd: calculate the transformed expression a<sup>A\u2212B</sup>\u00d7ab<sup>B\u2212C</sup>\u00d7...\u00d7abc..m<sup>M\u2212N</sup>\u00d7abc..mn<sup>N</sup>\n\nTransformation before calculation often reduces the count of multiplications\nbut in some cases it also increases the count (see the last one of the examples below),\nso it may be a good idea to check the count of multiplications before using the transformed expression for calculation.\n\n====Examples====\nFor the following expressions the count of multiplications is shown for calculating each power separately,\ncalculating them simultaneously without transformation, and calculating them simultaneously after transformation.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Example \n!

For example, when computing {{math|''x''<sup>2<sup>''k''</sup>\u22121</sup>}} the binary method requires {{math|''k''\u22121}} multiplications and {{math|''k''\u22121}} squarings. However one could perform {{mvar|k}} squarings to get {{math|''x''<sup>2<sup>''k''</sup></sup>}} and then multiply by {{math|''x''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} to obtain {{math|''x''<sup>2<sup>''k''</sup>\u22121</sup>}}.\n\nTo this end we define the [[signed-digit representation]] of an integer {{mvar|n}} in radix {{mvar|b}} as \n:<math>n=\\sum_{i=0}^{l-1}n_ib^i \\text{  with  } |n_i|<b</math>\n\n''Signed binary representation'' corresponds to the particular choice {{math|1=''b''=2}} and <math>n_i \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}</math>. It is denoted by <math>(n_{l-1}\\dots n_0)_s</math>. There are several methods for computing this representation. The representation is not unique, for example take {{math|1=''n''=478}}. Two distinct signed-binary representations are given by <math>(10\\bar 1 1100\\bar 1 10)_s</math> and <math>(100\\bar 1 1000\\bar 1 0)_s</math>, where <math>\\bar 1</math> is used to denote {{math|-1}}. Since the binary method computes a multiplication for every non-zero entry in the base 2 representation of {{mvar|n}}, we are interested in finding the signed-binary representation with the smallest number of non-zero entries, that is, the one with ''minimal'' [[Hamming weight]]. One method of doing this is to compute the representation in [[non-adjacent form]], or NAF for short, which is one that satisfies <math>n_in_{i+1}=0\\text{ for all }i\\geqslant 0</math> and denoted by <math>(n_{l-1}\\dots n_0)_{\\text{NAF}}</math>. For example the NAF representation of 478 is equal to <math>(1000\\bar 1 000\\bar 1 0)_{\\text{NAF}}</math>. This representation always has minimal Hamming weight. A simple algorithm to compute the NAF representation of a given integer <math>n=(n_ln_{l-1}\\dots n_0)_2</math> with <math>n_l=n_{l-1}=0</math> is the following:\n\n {{nowrap|<math>c_0=0</math>}}\n for {{math|1=''i'' = 0}} to {{math|''l'' - 1}} do\n   {{nowrap|<math>c_{i+1}=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1}{2}(c_i+n_i+n_{i+1})\\right\\rfloor</math>}}\n   {{nowrap|<math>n_i'=c_i+n_i-2c_{i+1}</math>}}\n {{nowrap|return <math>(n_{l-1}'\\dots n_0')_{\\text{NAF}}</math>}}\n\nAnother algorithm by Koyama and Tsuruoka does not require the condition that <math>n_i=n_{i+1}=0</math>; it still minimizes the Hamming weight.\n\n==Alternatives and generalizations==\n{{main|Addition-chain exponentiation}}\nExponentiation by squaring can be viewed as a suboptimal [[addition-chain exponentiation]] algorithm: it computes the exponent via an [[addition chain]] consisting of repeated exponent doublings (squarings) and/or incrementing exponents by ''one'' (multiplying by ''x'') only.  More generally, if one allows ''any'' previously computed exponents to be summed (by multiplying those powers of ''x''), one can sometimes perform the exponentiation using fewer multiplications (but typically using more memory).  The smallest power where this occurs is for ''n''=15:\n\n:<math>a^{15} = x \\times (x \\times [x \\times x^2]^2)^2  \\!</math>  (squaring, 6 multiplies)\n:<math>a^{15} = x^3 \\times ([x^3]^2)^2  \\!</math> (optimal addition chain, 5 multiplies if ''x''<sup>3</sup> is re-used)\n\nIn general, finding the ''optimal'' addition chain for a given exponent is a hard problem, for which no efficient algorithms are known, so optimal chains are typically only used for small exponents (e.g. in [[compiler]]s where the chains for small powers have been pre-tabulated).  However, there are a number of [[heuristic]] algorithms that, while not being optimal, have fewer multiplications than exponentiation by squaring at the cost of additional bookkeeping work and memory usage.  Regardless, the number of multiplications never grows more slowly than [[Big-O notation|&Theta;]](log ''n''), so these algorithms only improve asymptotically upon exponentiation by squaring by a constant factor at best.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Modular exponentiation]]\n*[[Vectorial addition chain]]\n*[[Montgomery reduction]]\n*[[Non-adjacent form]]\n*[[Addition chain]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Exponentials]]\n[[Category:Computer arithmetic algorithms]]\n[[Category:Computer arithmetic]]", "sha1": "fa01jazmrxpqe61swb2cf0s17uc5qpe"}}, {"title": "Exon", "ns": "0", "id": "10238", "revision": {"id": "841443428", "parentid": "840548076", "timestamp": "2018-05-15T21:47:12Z", "contributor": {"username": "OAbot", "id": "28481209"}, "minor": "", "comment": "[[Wikipedia:OABOT|Open access bot]]: add pmc identifier to citation with #oabot.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{distinguish|text=[[axon]], the projection of a [[neuron]], or [[Exxon]], a brand of fuel sold by ExxonMobil}}\n{{Other uses}}\n\nAn '''exon''' is any part of a [[gene]] that will encode a part of the final mature [[RNA]] produced by that gene after [[intron]]s have been removed by [[RNA splicing]].

As a result, Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was restricted from using Esso in the U.S., except in those states awarded to it in the [[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States|1911 Standard Oil antitrust settlement]].\n\nIn states where it was restricted from using the Esso name, the company marketed under the Humble or Enco brands. The Humble brand was used at Texas stations for decades, as those operations were under the direction of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey affiliate [[Humble Oil & Refining Company]]. In the middle to late 1950s, use of the Humble brand spread to other southwestern states, including [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Oklahoma]].\n\nIn 1959, Standard Oil Company of New Jersey secured full control of Humble Oil and restructured it into its U.S. marketing and refining division, to market nationwide under the Enco, Esso and Humble brands. Enco was created as an acronym for the phrase \"Energy Company\". Humble introduced the Enco brand in 1960 in [[Oklahoma]] and surrounding states, to replace Humble's subsidiary Oklahoma and Pate brands. Humble also tried marketing under Enco in [[Ohio]], but [[Standard Oil of Ohio|Standard Oil Company of Ohio (Sohio)]] protested that the Enco name and logo (a white oval with blue border and red lettering) too closely resembled that of Esso. Consequently, stations in Ohio were rebranded as Humble, and remained so until the Exxon brand came into use.\n\nAfter the Enco brand was discontinued in Ohio, it was moved to other non-Esso states. In 1961, Humble stations in Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and [[Texas]] were rebranded to Enco. That same year, Enco appeared on former Carter stations in the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest.\n\nIn 1963, Humble Oil and [[Tidewater Oil Company]] began negotiating a sale of Tidewater's West Coast refining and marketing operations. The sale would have given Humble Oil a large number of existing Flying A stations and distributorships, as well as a refinery in [[California]], the nation's fastest-growing gasoline market. However, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] objected to the sale on anti-trust grounds. (In 1966, [[Phillips Petroleum Company]] bought Tidewater's western properties and rebranded all Flying A outlets to [[Phillips 66]].)\n\nHumble Oil continued to expand its West Coast operations, adding California to its marketing territory, building a large number of new Enco stations and rebranding others. In 1967, Humble Oil purchased all remaining Signal stations from [[Standard Oil Company of California]] ([[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]) and rebranded them as Enco outlets, greatly increasing Enco's presence in California. Finally, in 1969, Humble Oil opened a new refinery in [[Benicia, California]].\n\nIn 1966, the U.S. Justice Department ordered Humble Oil to \"[[cease and desist]]\" from using the Esso brand at stations in several southeastern states, following protests from [[Standard Oil of Kentucky]] (Kyso), which was a Standard Oil of California subsidiary in the process of rebranding its Standard stations to Chevron. By 1967, Humble Oil's Esso stations in the Southeast were rebranded to Enco.\n\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, Humble Oil continued to have difficulties promoting itself as a nationwide marketer of petroleum products, despite a number of high-profile marketing strategies. These included the popular \"Put a Tiger in Your Tank\" advertising campaign and accompanying tiger mascot, introduced in 1959,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.exxonmobil.com/Corporate/history/about_who_history_alt.aspx| title=ExxonMobil - Our History| accessdate=2010-02-13}} And see also the fact, that almost at [[Newport Jazz Festival]] 1960 the musician [[Muddy Waters]] performed his hit \"Put a Tiger in Your Tank\", slating the Esso advert by applying the slogan to [[Gender|special masculinity's]] sexual wishes towards a woman, cf. {{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqnXT-Cgr2M| title=Muddy Waters - Tiger In Your Tank| accessdate=2010-02-13}} and its recording on the album ''[[At Newport 1960]]''. 1959 as the year of the final slogan message is also mentioned by: [[Brian Ash (bibliographer)|Brian Ash]], ''Tiger in Your Tank: The Anatomy of an Advertising Campaign'' (1969), p. 32.</ref><!--Different persons are credited with originating the slogan, such as Austrian born American-based psychologist and marketing expert [[Ernest Dichter]], British artist [[List of fictional tigers#Tigers in advertising|John Berry]] or Chicago copywriter Emery Smith, cf. http://www.petcaretips.net/famous_cats_tony_tiger.html--> to promote Enco Extra and Esso Extra gasolines. Humble Oil also used similar logotypes, use of the Humble name in all Enco and Esso advertising, and uniform designs for all stations regardless of brand. In addition, Humble Oil was a major promoter and broadcast sponsor for college football in the Pacific-8 (now [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]]) and Southwestern conferences.\n\nBut Humble Oil still faced stiff competition from national brands such as [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[Texaco]], which at that time was the only company to market under one brand name in all 50 states. By the late 1960s, Humble officials realized that the time had come to develop a new brand name that could be used nationwide.\n[[File:ExxonGasKellerTX.jpg|thumb|220px|left|A Exxon gas station in [[Keller, Texas]] with a [[7-Eleven]] convenience store that opened in 2001.]]\nAt first, consideration was given to simply rebranding all stations as Enco, but that was shelved when it was learned that the word \"Enco\" is similar in pronunciation to the Japanese slang term ''enko'', meaning \"stalled car\" (an abbreviation of ''enjin no kosho'', \"engine breakdown\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879122,00.html|title=On with Exxon|accessdate=2008-12-25|work=TIME|publisher=Time.com|date=1972-05-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Exxon was unveiled as the new, unified brand name for all former Enco and Esso outlets. At the same time, the company changed its corporate name from Standard Oil of New Jersey to Exxon Corporation. The rebranding came after successful test-marketing of the Exxon name, under two experimental logos, in the fall and winter of 1971\u20131972. Along with the new name, Exxon settled on a rectangular logo using red lettering and blue trim on a white background, similar to the familiar color scheme on the old Enco and Esso logos.\n\nThe company initially planned to change its name to \"Exon\", in keeping with the four-letter format of Enco and Esso. However, during the planning process, it was noted that [[j. James Exon|James Exon]] was the governor of Nebraska. Renaming the company after a sitting governor seemed ill-advised. George T. Piercy, a senior member of the board of directors suggested adding an X resulting in the new EXXON name.\n\nThe unrestricted international use of the popular Esso brand prompted Exxon to continue using it outside the U.S. Esso is the only widely used Standard Oil descendant brand left in existence. Others, such as [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], maintain a few Standard-branded stations in specific states in order to retain their trademarks and prevent others from using them.\n\n==Exxon Office Systems==\nUnder the guidance of its paid consultants at Boston Consulting Group, Exxon announced in the 1970s that it would compete against IBM and Xerox.  The mantra was \u2018Information Is the Oil of the 21st Century\u2019.  It launched Exxon Office Systems, which predictably failed, since \"the giant oil company failed to fully realize the subtleties of managing small high-tech companies.\"  In the early 1980's, Exxon retailed its fax machines and software through [[Sears]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=ANDREW POLLACK |title=EXXON CLOSES PLANT AND LAYS OFF 1,100 IN OFFICE COMPANY |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/02/business/exxon-closes-plant-and-lays-off-1100-in-office-company.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=2 December 1981 |quote=To beef up its marketing, Exxon is selling its electronic typewriters through Sears, Roebuck & Company's new business equipment stores.}}</ref>  Exxon announced the closure of the venture at the end of 1984.<ref>{{cite news |last1=By Mark Potts |title=Exxon to Quit Office-Systems Business |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1984/11/28/exxon-to-quit-office-systems-business/16cdefe3-1664-48f9-9e8a-a3b6e51988ed/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.5995c0a71e7f |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Washington Post |date=28 November 1984 |quote=Analysts repeatedly have rapped Exxon for its performance in office systems, saying that the giant oil company failed to fully realize the subtleties of managing small high-tech companies.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e |title=The Exxon Delusion |url=https://mondaynote.com/50-years-intech-part-4-the-exxon-delusion-d92ada84f6e |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=Monday Note |date=16 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Recent years==\nIn 1989, Exxon announced that it was moving its headquarters, including about 300 employees, from [[Manhattan]], New York City to the [[Las Colinas]] area of [[Irving, Texas]].

However, this also displaced and destroyed the microbial populations on the shoreline; many of these organisms (e.g. [[plankton]]) are the basis of the coastal marine food chain, and others (e.g. certain bacteria and fungi) are capable of facilitating the [[biodegradation]] of oil.  At the time, both scientific advice and public pressure was to clean everything, but since then, a much greater understanding of [[bioremediation|natural]] and facilitated [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] processes has developed, due somewhat in part to the opportunity presented for study by the ''Exxon Valdez'' spill. Despite the extensive cleanup attempts, less than ten percent of the oil was recovered and a study conducted by NOAA determined that as of early 2007 more than {{convert|26|e3U.S.gal|m3}} of oil remain in the sandy soil of the contaminated shoreline, declining at a rate of less than 4% per year.<ref name=\"AUTOREF9\" /><ref name=\"guardian\" />\n[[File:EVOSWEB 013 oiled bird3.jpg|thumb|left|Wildlife was severely affected by the oil spill.]]\n\nBoth the long-term and short-term effects of the oil spill have been studied.<ref name=\"AUTOREF11\" /> Immediate effects included the deaths of 100,000 to as many as 250,000 seabirds, at least 2,800 [[sea otter]]s, approximately 12 [[North American river otter|river otters]], 300 [[Common seal|harbor seals]], 247 [[bald eagle]]s, and 22 [[Killer whale|orcas]], and an unknown number of salmon and herring.<ref name=\"scientific american\" /><ref name=\"AUTOREF12\" />\n\nIn 2003, fourteen years after the spill, a team from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] found that the remaining oil was lasting far longer than anticipated, which in turn had resulted in more long-term loss of many species than had been expected.  The researchers found that at only a few parts per billion, [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ]] caused a long-term increase in mortality rates.  They reported that \"species as diverse as sea otters, harlequin ducks and killer whales suffered large, long-term losses and that oiled mussel beds and other tidal shoreline habitats will take an estimated 30 years to recover.\"<ref name=\"williamson\" />\n\nIn 2006, a study done by the National Marine Fisheries Service in [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] found that about {{convert|6|mi|km}} of shoreline around Prince William Sound was still affected by the spill, with 101.6 tonnes of oil remaining in the area. Exxon Mobil denied any concerns over any remaining oil, stating that they anticipated a remaining fraction that they assert will not cause any long-term ecological impacts, according to the conclusions of the studies they had done: \"We've done 350 peer-reviewed studies of Prince William Sound, and those studies conclude that Prince William Sound has recovered, it's healthy and it's thriving.\"<ref name=\"still\" /> However, in 2007 a  [[NOAA]] study concluded that this contamination can produce chronic low-level exposure, discourage subsistence where the contamination is heavy, and decrease the \"wilderness character\" of the area.<ref name=\"guardian\" />\n\nThe effects of the spill continued to be felt for many years afterwards.

To protect itself in case the judgment was affirmed, Exxon obtained a $4.8&nbsp;billion credit line from [[JPMorgan Chase|J.P.

On December 6, 2002, Holland announced that he had reduced the damages to $4&nbsp;billion, which he concluded was justified by the facts of the case and was not grossly excessive.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs contended that Exxon bore responsibility for the accident because the company \"put a drunk in charge of a tanker in Prince William Sound.\"<ref name=\"AUTOREF15\" />\n\nExxon recovered a significant portion of clean-up and legal expenses through insurance claims associated with the grounding of the ''Exxon Valdez''.<ref name=\"hfw\" /><ref name=\"10K\" /> Also, in 1991, Exxon made a quiet, separate financial settlement of damages with a group of seafood producers known as the [[Seattle Seven]] for the disaster's effect on the Alaskan seafood industry. The agreement granted $63.75&nbsp;million to the Seattle Seven, but stipulated that the seafood companies would have to repay almost all of any punitive damages awarded in other civil proceedings. The $5&nbsp;billion in punitive damages was awarded later, and the Seattle Seven's share could have been as high as $750&nbsp;million if the damages award had held. Other plaintiffs have objected to this secret arrangement,<ref name=\"AUTOREF16\" /> and when it came to light, Judge Holland ruled that Exxon should have told the jury at the start that an agreement had already been made, so the jury would know exactly how much Exxon would have to pay.<ref name=\"9th\" />\n\nAs of December 15, 2009, Exxon had paid the entire $507.5 million in punitive damages, including lawsuit costs, plus interest, which were further distributed to thousands of plaintiffs.<ref name=EQSFnews>{{cite web|title=News and Information|url=http://www.exspill.com/News/tabid/1901/Default.aspx|publisher=Exxon Qualified Settlement Fund|accessdate=March 21, 2013|quote=December 15, 2009 [...] Exxon has now paid to the EQSF all monies owed in the EVOS litigation pursuant to the punitive damages judgment}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1989, Exxon filed suit against the State of Alaska, charging that the state had interfered with Exxon's attempts to clean up the spill by refusing to approve the use of dispersant chemicals until the night of the 26th.

In June 1990 the tanker, renamed ''S/R Mediterranean'', left harbor after $30&nbsp;million of repairs.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> It was still sailing as of January 2010, registered in [[Panama]]. The vessel was then owned by a Hong Kong company, who operated it under the name ''Oriental Nicety''. In August 2012, it was beached at Alang, India and dismantled.\n\n===Alaska regulations===\nIn the aftermath of the spill, Alaska governor [[Steve Cowper]] issued an executive order requiring two [[tugboat]]s to escort every loaded tanker from Valdez out through Prince William Sound to Hinchinbrook Entrance. As the plan evolved in the 1990s, one of the two routine tugboats was replaced with a {{convert|210|ft|adj=on}} [[Escort Response Vehicle]] (ERV). Tankers at Valdez are no longer single-hulled.  Congress enacted legislation requiring all tankers to be [[double hull|double-hulled]] as of 2015.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fargo Balliett|first1=James|title=Oceans: Environmental Issues, Global Perspectives|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317463665|page=51}}</ref>\n\n==Economic and personal impact==\nIn 1991, following the collapse of the local marine population (particularly clams, herring and seals) the [[Chugach Alaska Corporation]], an [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations|Alaska Native Corporation]], filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]].

See {{Harvnb|Scarisbrick|1971|pp=548\u2013549}}, and {{Harvnb|Lydon|1998|p=119}}.</ref> Edward was the son of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Jane Seymour]], and England's first monarch to be raised as a [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. During his reign, the realm was governed by a [[regent|regency]] council because he never reached his majority. The council was first led by his uncle [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] (1547\u20131549), and then by [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|John Dudley, 1st Earl of Warwick]] (1550\u20131553), from 1551 Duke of Northumberland.\n\nEdward's reign was marked by economic problems and social unrest that in 1549 erupted into riot and rebellion. An expensive war with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], at first successful, ended with military withdrawal from Scotland and [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] in exchange for peace. The transformation of the [[Church of England]] into a recognisably Protestant body also occurred under Edward, who took great interest in religious matters. Although his father, Henry{{nbsp}}VIII, had severed the link between the Church and [[Catholic Church|Rome]], Henry{{nbsp}}VIII had never permitted the renunciation of [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] doctrine or ceremony. It was during Edward's reign that Protestantism was [[Christian state|established]] for the first time in England with reforms that included the abolition of [[clerical celibacy]] and the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and the imposition of compulsory services in English.\n\nIn February 1553, at age 15, Edward fell ill. When his sickness was discovered to be terminal, he and his Council drew up a \"Devise for the Succession\",  to prevent the country's return to Catholicism. Edward named his [[Cousin#Relationship charts|first cousin once removed]], [[Lady Jane Grey]], as his heir, excluding his half-sisters, [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. This decision was disputed following Edward's death, and Jane was deposed by Mary nine days after becoming queen. During her reign, Mary reversed Edward's Protestant reforms, which nonetheless became the basis of the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] of 1559.\n\n==Early life==\n===Birth===\n[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Edward VI as a Child - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of Prince Edward as a baby, depicted with regal splendour and a kingly gesture.

However, his actual involvement in decisions has long been a matter of debate, and during the 20th century, historians have presented the whole gamut of possibilities, \"balanc[ing] an articulate puppet against a mature, precocious, and essentially adult king\", in the words of Stephen Alford.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alford|2002|p=157}}</ref> A special \"Counsel for the Estate\" was created when Edward was fourteen.

The imperial ambassador, [[Jean Scheyfve]], reported that \"he suffers a good deal when the fever is upon him, especially from a difficulty in drawing his breath, which is due to the compression of the organs on the right side\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|pp=244\u2013245}}</ref> Edward felt well enough in early April to take the air in the park at Westminster and to move to Greenwich, but by the end of the month he had weakened again. By 7 May he was \"much amended\", and the royal doctors had no doubt of his recovery. A few days later the king was watching the ships on the Thames, sitting at his window.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loades|1996|p=238}}</ref> However, he relapsed, and on 11 June Scheyfve, who had an informant in the king's household, reported that \"the matter he ejects from his mouth is sometimes coloured a greenish yellow and black, sometimes pink, like the colour of blood\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=159}}</ref> Now his doctors believed he was suffering from \"a suppurating tumour\" of the lung and admitted that Edward's life was beyond recovery.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=160}}; {{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=254}}</ref> Soon, his legs became so swollen that he had to lie on his back, and he lost the strength to resist the disease. To his tutor [[John Cheke]] he whispered, \"I am glad to die\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=254}}</ref>\n\nEdward made his final appearance in public on 1 July, when he showed himself at his window in Greenwich Palace, horrifying those who saw him by his \"thin and wasted\" condition. During the next two days, large crowds arrived hoping to see the king again, but on 3 July, they were told that the weather was too chilly for him to appear. Edward died at the age of 15 at [[Greenwich Palace]] at 8pm on 6 July 1553. According to [[John Foxe]]'s legendary account of his death, his last words were: \"I am faint; Lord have mercy upon me, and take my spirit\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|p=258}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=167}}. See Foxe's ''Acts and monuments,'' VI, 352.</ref> He was buried in the [[Henry VII Lady Chapel]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 8 August 1553, with reformed rites performed by [[Thomas Cranmer]]. The procession was led by \"a grett company of chylderyn in ther surples\" and watched by Londoners \"wepyng and lamenting\"; the funeral chariot, draped in cloth of gold, was topped by an effigy of Edward, with crown, sceptre, and garter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Loach|1999|pp=167\u2013169}}</ref> Edward's burial place was unmarked until as late as 1966, when an inscribed stone was laid in the chapel floor by [[Christ's Hospital]] school to commemorate their founder. The inscription reads as follows: \"In Memory Of King Edward VI Buried In This Chapel This Stone Was Placed Here By Christ's Hospital In Thanksgiving For Their Founder 7 October 1966\".<ref>Google Images</ref>\n\nThe cause of Edward VI's death is not certain.

In those six years, the Church transferred from an essentially Catholic liturgy and structure to one that is usually identified as Protestant.<ref name =MacPr>The article follows the majority of historians in using the term \"Protestant\" for the Church of England as it stood by the end of Edward's reign. However, a minority prefer the terms \"evangelical\" or \"new\". In this view, as expressed by Diarmaid MacCulloch, it is \"premature to use the label 'Protestant' for the English movement of reform in the reigns of Henry and Edward, even though its priorities were intimately related to what was happening in central Europe. A description more true to the period would be'evangelical', a word which was indeed used at the time in various cognates\". {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|p=2}}</ref> In particular, the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer, the Ordinal of 1550, and Cranmer's [[Thirty-nine Articles|Forty-two Articles]] formed the basis for English Church practices that continue to this day.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elton|1962|p=212}}; {{Harvnb|Skidmore|2007|pp=8\u20139}}</ref> Edward himself fully approved these changes, and though they were the work of reformers such as Thomas Cranmer, [[Hugh Latimer]], and [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Nicholas Ridley]], backed by Edward's determinedly evangelical Council, the fact of the king's religion was a catalyst in the acceleration of the Reformation during his reign.<ref>{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|2002|p=8}}</ref>\n\nQueen Mary's attempts to undo the reforming work of her brother's reign faced major obstacles.

Queen Elizabeth replaced Mary's councillors and bishops with ex-Edwardians, such as [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], Northumberland's former secretary, and [[Richard Cox (bishop)|Richard Cox]], Edward's old tutor, who preached an anti-Catholic sermon at the opening of parliament in 1559.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haigh|1993|p=238}}</ref> Parliament passed an [[Act of Uniformity 1559|Act of Uniformity]] the following spring that restored, with modifications, Cranmer's prayer book of 1552;<ref>{{Harvnb|Somerset|1997|p=101}}</ref> and the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] of 1563 were largely based on Cranmer's Forty-two Articles.

It used [[delay line memory|mercury delay lines]] for memory, and [[derating|derated]] [[vacuum tube]]s for logic.  Power consumption was 11 [[Kilowatt|kW]] of electricity.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXJ-tYqPARg EDSAC Simulator - Computerphile]</ref><ref>[https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/EDSAC99/statistics.html University of Cambridge - Some EDSAC statistics]</ref> Cycle time was 1.5 ms for all ordinary instructions, 6 ms for multiplication.  Input was via five-hole [[punched tape]] and output was via a [[teleprinter]].\n\nInitially registers were limited to an [[Accumulator (computing)|accumulator]] and a multiplier register. In 1953, [[David Wheeler (computer scientist)|David Wheeler]], returning from a stay at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University of Illinois]], designed an [[index register]] as an extension to the original EDSAC hardware.\n\nA magnetic tape drive was added in 1952 but never worked sufficiently well to be of real use.<ref name=\"autogeneratedcl\">[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/EDSAC99/statistics.html Some EDSAC statistics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nUntil 1952, the available main memory (instructions and data) was only 512 18-bit words, and there was no backing store.<ref>[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/EDSAC99/reminiscences/#EDSAC%201%20applications EDSAC 1 and after<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The delay lines (or \"tanks\") were arranged in two batteries providing 512 words each.

Each contained 18 bits, but the topmost bit was always unavailable due to timing problems, so only 17 bits were used. An instruction consisted of a five-bit instruction code, one spare bit, a ten bit operand (usually a memory address), and a length bit to control whether the instruction used a 17-bit or a 35-bit operand (two consecutive words, [[Endianness|little-endian]]).  All instruction codes were by design represented by one mnemonic letter, so that the ''Add'' instruction, for example, used the EDSAC character code for the letter A.\n\nInternally, the EDSAC used [[two's complement]], [[Binary number|binary]] numbers.  Numbers were either 17 bits (one word) or 35 bits (two words) long.  Unusually, the [[Binary multiplier|multiplier]] was designed to treat numbers as [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] fractions in the range \u22121 \u2264 ''x'' &lt; 1, i.e. the binary point was immediately to the right of the sign.  The [[Accumulator (computing)|accumulator]] could hold 71 bits, including the sign, allowing two long (35-bit) numbers to be multiplied without losing any precision.\n\nThe instructions available were: \n* Add\n* Subtract \n* Multiply-and-add\n* AND-and-add (called \"Collate\")\n* Shift Left\n* Arithmetic shift Right\n* Load multiplier register\n* Store (and optionally clear) accumulator\n* Conditional Goto\n* Read Input tape\n* Print character\n* Round accumulator\n* No-op\n* Stop.  \nThere was no division instruction (but various division subroutines were supplied) and no way to directly load a number into the accumulator (a \"sTore and zero accumulator\" instruction followed by an \"Add\" instruction were necessary for this).  There was no unconditional jump instruction, nor was there a procedure call instruction&nbsp;- it had not yet been invented.\n\n[[Maurice Wilkes]] discussed relative addressing modes for the [[Electronic_delay_storage_automatic_calculator|EDSAC]] in a paper published in 1953. He was making the proposals to facilitate the use of [[subroutine|subroutines]].<ref>Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosphical Society, Vol 49, Pt 1, pgs 84-9</ref>\n\n===System software===\nThe ''initial orders'' were hard-wired on a set of [[Stepping switch|uniselector switches]] and loaded into the low words of memory at startup. By May 1949, the initial orders provided a primitive relocating [[Assembly language assembler|assembler]] taking advantage of the mnemonic design described above, all in 31 words. This was the world's first assembler, and arguably the start of the global software industry. There is a simulation of EDSAC available and a full description of the initial orders and first programs.\n\nThe machine was used by other members of the University to solve real problems, and many early techniques were developed that are now included in operating systems.\nUsers prepared their programs by punching them (in assembler) onto a paper tape. They soon became good at being able to hold the paper tape up to the light and read back the codes. When a program was ready it was hung on a length of line strung up near the paper tape reader. The machine operators, who were present during the day, selected the next tape from the line and loaded it into EDSAC. This is of course well known today as job queues. If it printed something then the tape and the printout were returned to the user, otherwise they were informed at which memory location it had stopped. Debuggers were some time away, but a CRT screen could be set to display the contents of a particular piece of memory. This was used to see if a number was converging, for example. A loudspeaker was connected to the accumulator's sign bit; experienced users knew healthy and unhealthy sounds of programs, particularly programs 'hung' in a loop.  After office hours certain \"Authorised Users\" were allowed to run the machine for themselves, which went on late into the night until a valve blew \u2013 which usually happened according to one such user.<ref>Professor David Barron, Emeritus Professor of the University of Southampton at a Cambridge Computer Lab seminar to mark the 60th anniversary 6 May 2009.</ref>\n\n===Programming technique===\n[[File:EDSAC (23).jpg|thumb|EDSAC monitoring desk]]\nThe early programmers had to make use of techniques frowned upon today\u2014especially altering the code. As there was no index register until much later, the only way of accessing an array was to alter which memory location a particular instruction was referencing.\n\n[[David Wheeler (computer scientist)|David Wheeler]], who earned the world's first Computer Science PhD working on the project, is credited with inventing the concept of a subroutine. Users wrote programs that called a routine by jumping to the start of the subroutine with the return address (i.e. the location-plus-one of the jump itself) in the accumulator (a Wheeler jump). By convention the subroutine expected this and the first thing it did was to modify its concluding jump instruction to that return address. Multiple and nested subroutines could be called so long as the user knew the length of each one in order to calculate the location to jump to; [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive calls]] were forbidden. The user then copied the code for the subroutine from a master tape onto their own tape following the end of their own program.\n\n===Application software===\nThe subroutine concept led to the availability of a substantial subroutine library. By 1951, 87 subroutines in the following categories were available for general use: [[floating point|floating point arithmetic]]; arithmetic operations on [[complex number]]s; checking; division; [[exponentiation]]; routines relating to functions; [[differential equation]]s; special functions; [[power series]]; [[logarithm]]s; miscellaneous; print and layout; [[Numerical integration|quadrature]]; read (input); ''n''th root; [[trigonometric functions]]; counting operations (simulating [[do while loop|repeat until loops]], [[while loop]]s and [[for loop]]s); [[probability vector|vectors]]; and [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].\n\n==Applications of EDSAC==\n* In 1950, M. V. Wilkes and Wheeler used EDSAC to solve a differential equation relating to gene frequencies in a paper by [[Ronald Fisher]].<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3001780 Gene Frequencies in a Cline Determined by Selection and Diffusion], R. A. Fisher, ''Biometrics'', Vol. 6, No. 4 (Dec. 1950), pp. 353\u2013361</ref> This represents the first use of a computer for a problem in the field of biology.\n* In 1951, Miller and Wheeler used the machine to discover a 79-digit prime<ref>[http://primes.utm.edu/notes/by_year.html Caldwell \u2013 largest known primes by year] One reference gives Miller, J. C.

He exhibited at the Royal Society of Artists, Birmingham\u2014a traditional venue for generic painters\u2014as well as in the more radical atmosphere of Glasgow's Institute of Fine Arts, where some of the most innovative artists were on show. He was twice an exhibitor at the prestigious [[Walker Art Gallery]] in Liverpool, one of the largest and most important provincial galleries in the country, and another at the [[Manchester Art Gallery]], a Victorian institution now part of the public libraries. But at heart, Shepard was a Londoner, showing sixteen times at the Royal Academy on Piccadilly.

A. Milne]] in 1923 by another ''Punch'' staffer, [[E. V. Lucas]]. Milne initially thought Shepard's style was not what he wanted, but used him to illustrate the book of poems ''[[When We Were Very Young]]''. Happy with the results, Milne then insisted Shepard illustrate ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]''. Realising his illustrator's contribution to the book's success, the writer arranged for Shepard to receive a share of his royalties. Milne also inscribed a copy of ''Winnie-the-Pooh'' with the following personal verse:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/winnie-the-pooh/features/eh-shepard-the-man-who-drew-pooh-in-progress|title=EH Shepard: The Man Who Drew Pooh - Winnie-the-Pooh - Icons of England|date=2010-04-20|access-date=2018-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420084401/http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/winnie-the-pooh/features/eh-shepard-the-man-who-drew-pooh-in-progress|archivedate=20 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n''When I am gone,<br>\n''Let Shepard decorate my tomb,<br>\n''And put (if there is room)<br>\n''Two pictures on the stone:<br>\n''Piglet from page a hundred and eleven,<br>\n''And Pooh and Piglet walking (157) ...<br>\n''And Peter, thinking that they are my own,<br>\n''Will welcome me to Heaven.''\n</blockquote>\n\nEventually Shepard came to resent \"that silly old bear\" as he felt that the Pooh illustrations overshadowed his other work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://via.hypothes.is/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4772370.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} UK {{!}} Magazine {{!}} The man who hated Pooh|website=via.hypothes.is|access-date=2018-01-16}}</ref>\n\nShepard modelled Pooh not on the toy owned by Milne's son [[Christopher Robin Milne|Christopher Robin]] but on \"Growler\", a stuffed bear owned by his own son.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/04/real-winnie-the-pooh-revealed-to-have-been-growler|last=Flood|first=Alison|title=The real Winnie-the-Pooh revealed to have been 'Growler'|work=The Guardian|date=4 September 2017|accessdate=4 September 2017}} With sketch based on Growler.</ref> (Growler no longer exists, having been given to his granddaughter Minnie Hunt and subsequently destroyed by a neighbour's dog.)<ref>Chandler (2000), p. 92.</ref> His Pooh work is so famous that 300 of his preliminary sketches were exhibited at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 1969, when he was 90 years old.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Howard|first1=Philip|title=Show at Pooh Corner|issue=57744 |newspaper=The Times |date=16 December 1969}}</ref>\n\nA Shepard painting of Winnie the Pooh, believed to have been painted in the 1930s for a Bristol teashop,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://via.hypothes.is/https://archive.today/20071009211837/http://www.pooh-corner.com/bioshepard.html|title=Pooh Corner: BIOGRAPHIES: E.H.

In fact, the etymology of the family is enterobacterium with the suffix to designate a family (aceae)\u2014not after the [[genus]] ''[[Enterobacter]]'' (which would be \"Enterobacteraceae\")\u2014and the type genus is ''[[Escherichia]]''.\n\n==Characteristics==\nMembers of the Enterobacteriaceae are [[bacillus (shape)|bacilli]] (rod-shaped), and are typically 1\u20135 \u03bcm in length. They typically appear as medium to large-sized grey colonies on blood agar, although some can express pigments (such as Serratia marcescens). Like other proteobacteria, enterobactericeae have [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] stains,<ref name=\"urlDorlands Medical Dictionary:Enterobacteriaceae\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/three/000035660.htm |title=Dorlands Medical Dictionary:Enterobacteriaceae |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> and they are [[facultative anaerobe]]s, [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermenting]] sugars to produce [[lactic acid]] and various other end products.  Most also reduce [[nitrate]] to [[nitrite]], although exceptions exist (e.g. ''[[Photorhabdus]]'').  Unlike most similar bacteria, enterobacteriaceae generally lack [[Cytochrome c oxidase|cytochrome C oxidase]], although there are exceptions (e.g. ''[[Plesiomonas shigelloides]]'').  Most have many [[flagella]] used to move about, but a few genera are nonmotile.  They are not [[endospore|spore]]-forming.  Catalase reactions vary among Enterobacteriaceae.\n\nMany members of this family are normal members of the [[gut flora|gut microbiota]] in humans and other animals, while others are found in water or soil, or are [[parasitism|parasites]] on a variety of different animals and plants.  ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' is one of the most important [[model organism]]s, and its [[genetics]] and [[biochemistry]] have been closely studied.\n\nMost members of Enterobacteriaceae have peritrichous, type I [[fimbria (bacteriology)|fimbriae]] involved in the adhesion of the bacterial cells to their hosts.\nSome enterobacteria produce [[endotoxin]]s. Endotoxins reside in the cell wall and are released when the cell dies and the cell wall disintegrates. Some members of the Enterobacteriaceae produce endotoxins that, when released into the bloodstream following cell lysis, cause a systemic inflammatory and vasodilatory response. The most severe form of this is known as endotoxic shock, which can be rapidly fatal.\n\n==Genera==\n\n===Accepted===\n{{div col|colwidth=200px}}\n*''[[Arsenophonus]]''\n*''[[Brenneria]]''\n*''[[Buchnera (bacterium)|Buchnera]]''\n*''[[Budvicia]]''\n*''[[Buttiauxella]]''\n<!-- Calymmatobacterium was reclassified as Klesbsiella. -->\n*''[[Cedecea]]''\n*''[[Citrobacter]]''\n*''[[Cosenzaea]]''\n*''[[Cronobacter]]''\n*''[[Dickeya]]''\n*''[[Edwardsiella (bacterium)|Edwardsiella]]''\n*''[[Enterobacillus]]''\n*''[[Enterobacter]]''\n*''[[Erwinia]]''\n*''[[Escherichia]]''\n*''[[Ewingella]]''\n*''[[Franconibacter]]''\n*''[[Gibbsiella]]''\n*''[[Hafnia (bacterium)|Hafnia]]''\n*''[[Izhakiella]]''\n*''[[Kosakonia]]''\n*''[[Klebsiella]]''\n*''[[Kluyvera]]''\n*''[[Leclercia]]''\n*''[[Lelliottia]]''\n*''[[Leminorella]]''\n*''[[Levinea]]''\n*''[[Lonsdalea]]''\n*''[[Mangrovibacter]]''\n*''[[Moellerella]]''\n*''[[Morganella (bacterium)|Morganella]]''\n*''[[Obesumbacterium]]''\n*''[[Pantoea]]''\n*''[[Pectobacterium]]''\n*''[[Phaseolibacter]]''\n*''[[Photorhabdus]]''\n*''[[Phytobacter]]''\n*''[[Plesiomonas]]''\n*''[[Pluralibacter]]''\n*''[[Pragia]]''\n*''[[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]]''\n*''[[Providencia (bacterium)|Providencia]]''\n*''[[Pseudocitrobacter]]''\n*''[[Rahnella]]''\n*''[[Raoultella]]''\n*''[[Rosenbergiella]]''\n*''[[Rouxiella]]''\n*''[[Saccharobacter]]''\n*''[[Salmonella]]''\n*''[[Samsonia]]''\n*''[[Serratia]]''\n*''[[Shigella]]''\n*''[[Shimwellia]]''\n*''[[Siccibacter]]''\n*''[[Sodalis]]''\n*''[[Tatumella]]''\n*''[[Thorsellia]]''\n*''[[Trabulsiella]]''\n*''[[Wigglesworthia]]''\n*''[[Xenorhabdus]]''\n*''[[Yersinia]]''\n*''[[Yokenella]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n===''[[Candidatus]]''===\n{{div col|colwidth=200px}}\n*[[Candidatus Annandia|\"''Candidatus'' Annandia\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Aschnera|\"''Candidatus'' Aschnera\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Benitsuchiphilus|\"''Candidatus'' Benitsuchiphilus\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Curculioniphilus|\"''Candidatus'' Curculioniphilus\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Cuticobacterium|\"''Candidatus'' Cuticobacterium\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Gillettellia|\"''Candidatus'' Gillettellia\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Hamiltonella|\"''Candidatus'' Hamiltonella\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Hartigia|\"''Candidatus'' Hartigia\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Ishikawaella|\"''Candidatus'' Ishikawaella\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Kleidoceria|\"''Candidatus'' Kleidoceria\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Macropleicola|\"''Candidatus'' Macropleicola\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Moranella|\"''Candidatus'' Moranella\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Phlomobacter|\"''Candidatus'' Phlomobacter\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Profftia|\"''Candidatus'' Profftia\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Purcelliella|\"''Candidatus'' Purcelliella\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Regiella|\"''Candidatus'' Regiella\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Riesia|\"''Candidatus'' Riesia\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Rohrkolberia|\"''Candidatus'' Rohrkolberia\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Rosenkranzia|\"''Candidatus'' Rosenkranzia\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Schneideria|\"''Candidatus'' Schneideria\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Stammerula|\"''Candidatus'' Stammerula\"]]\n*[[Candidatus Tachikawaea|\"''Candidatus'' Tachikawaea\"]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Provisional===\n{{div col|colwidth=200px}}\n*''Aquamonas''\n*''Aranicola''\n*''Atlantibacter''\n*''Chania''\n*''Grimontella''\n*''Guhaiyinggella''\n*''Margalefia''\n*''Tiedjeia''\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Identification==\nTo identify different [[genera]] of Enterobacteriaceae, a microbiologist may run a series of tests in the lab.

The club played a senior club in the Victorian Football Association in 1878, one year after the VFA formed.  It is historically associated with [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]], a suburb in the north-west of [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Since 2013, the club has been headquartered at The Hangar, [[Melbourne Airport, Victoria|Melbourne Airport]], and plays its home games at either [[Docklands Stadium]] or the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]; throughout most of its history the club's home ground and headquarters was [[Windy Hill, Essendon|Windy Hill]], Essendon, where it played from 1922 until 1991.

The team became universally known as \"the Dons\" (from Essen'''DON'''); it was not until much later, during the War years of the early 1940s, that they became known as \"The Bombers\" \u2014 due to Windy Hill's proximity to the [[Essendon Airport|Essendon Aerodrome]].<ref>Hutchinson, 1996, p.159.</ref>\n\nIn the [[1922 VFL season|1922 season]], playing in Essendon for the first time in decades, Essendon reached the final four for the first time since 1912, finishing in third place. In the [[1923 VFL season|1923 season]] the club topped the ladder with 13 wins from 16 games. After a 17-point second semi final loss to South Melbourne defeated Fitzroy (who had beaten South Melbourne) in the challenge final: Essendon 8.15 (63) to Fitzroy 6.10 (46). Amongst Essendon's best players were half forward flanker [[George Shorten|George \"Tich\" Shorten]], centre half forward [[Justin McCarthy (footballer)|Justin McCarthy]], centre half back [[Tom Fitzmaurice]], rover [[Frank Maher (footballer)|Frank Maher]] and wingman [[Jack Garden]].\n\nThis was one of Essendon's most famous sides, dubbed the \"Mosquito Fleet\", due to the number of small, very fast players in the side. Six players were 5'6\" (167&nbsp;cm) or smaller.\n\nThe [[1924 VFL season|1924 season]] proved to be arguably the strangest year in Essendon's entire history. For the first time since 1897 there was no ultimate match \u2014 either \"Challenge Final\" or \"Grand Final\" \u2014 to determine the premiers; instead, the top four clubs after the home and away season played a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] to determine the premiers. Essendon, having previously defeated both Fitzroy (by 40 points) and South Melbourne (by 33 points), clinched the premiership by means of a 20-point loss to Richmond. With the Tigers having already lost a match to Fitzroy by a substantial margin, the Dons were declared premiers by virtue of their superior percentage, meaning that Essendon again managed to win successive premierships. But the poor crowds for the finals meant this was never attempted again, resulting in Essendon having the unique record of winning the only two premierships without a grand final.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nProminent contributors to Essendon's 1924 Premiership success included back pocket [[Clyde Donaldson]], follower [[Norm Beckton]], half back flanker [[Roy Laing]], follower [[Charlie May (footballer)|Charlie May]] and rover [[Charlie Hardy]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe 1924 season was not without controversy, with rumours of numerous players accepting bribes. Regardless of the accuracy of these allegations, the club's image was tarnished, and the side experienced its lowest period during the decade that followed, with poor results on the field and decreased support off it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThere was worse to follow, with various Essendon players publicly blaming each other for the poor performance against Richmond, and then, with dissension still rife in the ranks, the side plummeted to an humiliating 28-point loss to VFA premiers [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]] in a [[Dame Nellie Melba's Limbless Soldiers' Appeal match|special charity match]] played a week later in front of 46,100 people, in aid of ''[[Dame Nellie Melba's Limbless Soldiers' Appeal match|Dame Nellie Melba's Limbless Soldiers' Appeal Fund]]'', purportedly (but not officially) for the championship of Victoria.<ref>{{cite web|last=Frost|first= Lionel|title=Did the 1924 Bombers throw their last game|date=25 September 2006|publisher=AFL Official Website|url=http://afl.com.au/Season2007/News/NewsArticle/tabid/208/Default.aspx?newsId=32977|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308092128/http://afl.com.au/Season2007/News/NewsArticle/tabid/208/Default.aspx?newsId=32977|archivedate=8 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nWhile it is always difficult to assess the damage caused by events such as these, the club's fortunes dipped alarmingly, and persistently. Indeed, after finishing third in the [[1926 VFL season|1926 season]], it was to be 14 years before Essendon would even contest a finals series.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Dick Reynolds years (1933\u20131960)===\n[[File:Dick_reynolds.jpg|thumb|upright|Dick Reynolds is regarded as one of Essendon's greatest players.]]\nThe [[1933 VFL season|1933 season]], was probably the start of the Essendon revival, seeing the debut of the player regarded as one of Essendon's greatest players [[Dick Reynolds]]. His impact was immediate. He won his first Brownlow Medal aged 19. His record of three Brownlow victories (1934, 1937, 1938), equalled [[Haydn Bunton, Sr]] (1931, 1932, 1935), and later equalled by [[Bob Skilton]] (1959, 1963, 1968), and [[Ian Stewart (Australian rules footballer)|Ian Stewart]] (1965, 1966, 1971).\n\nReynolds went on to arguably even greater achievements as a coach, a position to which he was first appointed, jointly with Harry Hunter, in 1939 (this was while Reynolds was still a player). A year later he took the reins on a solo basis and was rewarded with immediate success (at least in terms of expectations at the time which, after so long in the wilderness, were somewhat modest). He was regarded as having a sound tactical knowledge of the game and being an inspirational leader, as he led the side into the finals in 1940 for the first time since 1926, when the side finished 3rd. Melbourne, which defeated Essendon by just 5 points in the preliminary final, later went on to trounce Richmond by 39 points in the grand final.\n\nThe Essendon Football Club adopted the nickname '''''The Bombers''''' in April 1940.<ref>[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/12444967 Bombing to Victory, ''The Argus'', (Wednesday, 10 April 1940), p.17.]</ref>\n\n1941 brought Essendon's first grand final appearance since 1923, but the side again lowered its colours to Melbourne. A year later war broke out and the competition was considerably weakened, with Geelong being forced to pull out of the competition due to travel restrictions as a result of petrol rationing. Attendances at games also declined dramatically, whilst some clubs had to move from their normal grounds due to them being used for military purposes. Many players were lost to football due to their military service. Nevertheless, Essendon went on to win the 1942 Premiership with Western Australian [[Wally Buttsworth]] in irrepressible form at centre half back. Finally, the long-awaited premiership was Essendon's after comprehensively outclassing Richmond in the grand final, 19.18 (132) to 11.13 (79). The match was played at Carlton in front of 49,000 spectators.\n\nIn any case, there could be no such reservations about Essendon's next premiership, which came just four years later. Prior to that Essendon lost a hard fought grand final to Richmond in 1943 by 5 points, finished 3rd in 1944, and dropped to 8th in 1945.\n\nAfter World War II, Esssendon enjoyed great success. In the five years immediately after the war, Essendon won 3 premierships (1946, 1949, 1950) and were runners up twice (1947, 1948). In 1946, Essendon were clearly the VFL's supreme force, topping the ladder after the roster games and surviving a drawn second semi final against Collingwood to win through to the grand final a week later with a 10.16 (76) to 8.9 (57). Then, in the grand final against Melbourne, Essendon set a grand final record score of 22.18 (150) to Melbourne 13.9 (87), with 7 goal centre half forward [[Gordon Lane]]. Rover Bill Hutchinson, and defenders Wally Buttsworth, Cec Ruddell and Harold Lambert among the best players.\n\nThe 1947 Grand Final has to go down in the ledger as 'one of the ones that got away', Essendon losing to Carlton by a single point despite managing 30 scoring shots to 21. As if to prove that lightning does occasionally strike twice, the second of the 'ones that got away' came just a year later, the Dons finishing with a lamentable 7.27, to tie with Melbourne (who managed 10.9) in the 1948 grand final. A week later Essendon waved the premiership good-bye, as Melbourne raced to a 13.11 (89) to 7.8 (50) triumph. The club's Annual Report made an assessment that was at once restrained and, as was soon to emerge, tacitly and uncannily prophetic:\n\n<blockquote>It is very apparent that no team is complete without a spearhead and your committee has high hopes of rectifying that fault this coming season.</blockquote>\n\nThe 1949 season heralded the arrival on the VFL scene of [[John Coleman (Australian footballer)|John Coleman]], arguably the greatest player in Essendon's history, and, in the view of some, the finest player the game has known. In his first ever appearance for the Dons, against [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] in Round 1 1949, he booted 12 of his side's 18 goals to create an opening round record which was to endure for forty five years. More importantly, however, he went on to maintain the same high level of performance throughout the season, kicking precisely 100 goals for the year to become the first player to top the ton since Richmond's Jack Titus in 1940.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe Coleman factor was just what Essendon needed to enable them to take that vital final step to premiership glory, but even so it was not until the business end of the season that this became clear. Essendon struggled to make the finals in 4th place, but once there they suddenly ignited to put in one of the most consistently devastating September performances in VFL history.\n\n[[File:742692-john-coleman.jpg|thumb|upright|John Coleman kicked 537 goals in 98 matches.]]\nCollingwood succumbed first as the Dons powered their way to an 82-point first semi final victory, and a fortnight later it was the turn of the [[North Melbourne Football Club]] as Essendon won the preliminary final a good deal more comfortably than the ultimate margin of 17 points suggested. In the grand final, Essendon were pitted against Carlton and in a match that was a total travesty as a contest they overwhelmed the Blues to the tune of 73 points, 18.17 (125) to 6.16 (52). Best for the Dons included pacy aboriginal half back flanker Norm McDonald, ruckman Bob McLure, and rovers Bill Hutchinson and Ron McEwin. John Coleman also did well, registering 6 majors.\n\nA year later Essendon were if anything even more dominant, defeating the [[North Melbourne Football Club]] in both the second semi final and the grand final to secure consecutive VFL premierships for the third time. Best afield in the grand final in what was officially his swansong as a player was captain-coach Dick Reynolds, who received sterling support from the likes of Norm McDonald, ruckman/back pocket Wally May, back pocket Les Gardiner, and big Bob McLure.\n\nWith 'King Richard' still holding court as coach in 1951, albeit now in a non-playing capacity, Essendon seemed on course for a third consecutive flag but a controversial four-week suspension dished out to John Coleman on the eve of the finals effectively put paid to their chances. Coleman was reported for retaliation after twice being struck by his Carlton opponent, Harry Caspar, and without him the Dons were rated a 4 goals poorer team. Nevertheless, they still managed to battle their way to a 6th successive grand final with wins over Footscray by 8 points in the first semi final and Collingwood by 2 points in the preliminary final.\n\nThe Dons sustained numerous injuries in the preliminary final and the selectors sprang a surprise on grand final day by naming the officially retired Dick Reynolds as 20th man. 'King Richard' was powerless to prevent the inevitable, although leading at half time, the Geelong kicked five goals to two points in the third quarter to set up victory by 11 points.\n\nEssendon slumped to 8th in 1952 but John Coleman was in irrepressible form managing 103 goals for the year. Hugh Buggy noted in ''The Argus'': \"It was the wettest season for twenty two years and Coleman showed that since the war he was without peer in the art of goal kicking.\"\n\nTwo seasons later Coleman's career was ended after he dislocated a knee during the Round 8 clash with the [[North Melbourne Football Club]] at Essendon. Aged just twenty five, he had kicked 537 goals in only 98 VFL games in what was generally a fairly low scoring period for the game. His meteoric rise and fall were clearly the stuff of legend, and few if any players, either before or since, have had such an immense impact over so brief a period.\n\nAccording to Alf Brown, football writer for ''The Herald'':\n::(Coleman) had all football's gifts. He was courageous, a long, straight kick, he had a shrewd football brain and, above all, he was a spectacular, thrilling mark.\n\nSomewhat more colourful, R.S. Whittington suggested,\n::\"Had he been a trapeze artist in a strolling circus, Coleman could have dispensed with the trapeze.\"\n\nWithout Coleman, Essendon's fortunes plummeted, and there were to be no further premierships in the 1950s. The nearest miss came in 1957 when the Bombers (as they were popularly known by this time) earned premiership favouritism after a superb 16 point second semi final defeat of Melbourne, only to lose by over 10 goals against the same side a fortnight later.\n\n1959 saw another grand final loss to Melbourne, this time by 37 points, but the fact that the average age of the Essendon side was only 22 was seen as providing considerable cause for optimism. However, it was to take another three years, and a change of coach, before the team's obvious potential was translated into tangible success.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Post-Reynolds era and the \"Slugging Seventies\" (1961\u20131980)===\nJohn Coleman started his coaching career at Essendon in 1961, thus ending the [[Dick Reynolds]] era at the club. In the same year Essendon finished the season mid table and supporters were not expecting too much for the following season. However, the club blitzed the opposition in this year, losing only two matches and finishing top of the table. Both losses were to the previous year's grand finalists. The finals posed no problems for the resurgent Dons, easily accounting for Carlton in the season's climax, winning the 1962 Premiership. This was a remarkable result for Coleman who in his second season of coaching pulled off the ultimate prize in Australian football. As so often is the case after a flag, the following two years were below standard. A further premiership in 1965 (won from 4th position on the ladder), was also unexpected due to periods of poor form during the season. The Bombers were a different club when the finals came around, but some of the credit for the improvement was given to the influence of [[Brian Sampson (footballer)|Brian Sampson]] and [[Ted Fordham]] during the finals. Coleman's time as coach turned out to be much like his playing career: highly successful but cut short when he had to stand down due to health problems in 1967. Only six years later, on the eve of the 1973 season, he would be dead of a heart-attack at just 44 years of age.\n\nFollowing Coleman's retirement, the club experienced tough times on and off the field. Finals appearances were rare for the side, which was often in contention for the [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]]. Essendon did manage to make the [[1968 VFL Grand Final]], but lost to Carlton by just three points and would not make it back to the big stage for a decade-and-a-half.\n\nDuring the period from 1968 until 1980, five different coaches were tried, with none lasting longer than four years. Off the field the club went through troubled times as well. In 1970 [[Don McKenzie (footballer, born 1939)#Dispute over player payments|five players went on strike]] before the season even began, demanding higher payments. Essendon did make the finals in 1972 and 1973 under the autocratic direction of [[Des Tuddenham]] (Collingwood) but they were beaten badly in successive elimination finals by St. Kilda and would not taste finals action again until the very end of the decade. The 70s Essendon sides were involved in many rough and tough encounters under Tuddenham, who himself came to logger heads with Ron Barassi at a quarter time huddle where both coaches exchanged heated words. Essendon had tough, but talented players with the likes of \"Rotten Ronnie\" [[Ron Andrews]] and experienced players such as [[Barry Davis (footballer)|Barry Davis]], [[Ken Fletcher (Australian footballer)|Ken Fletcher]], [[Geoff Blethyn]], [[Neville Fields]] and West Australian import [[Graham Moss]]. In May 1974, a controversial half time all-in-brawl with Richmond at Windy Hill and a 1975 encounter with Carlton were testimony of the era. Following the Carlton match, the 'Herald' described Windy Hill as \"Boot Hill\", because of the extent of the fights and the high number of reported players (eight in all \u2013 four from Carlton and four from Essendon). The peak of these incidents would occur in 1980 with new recruit [[Phil Carman]] making headlines for head-butting an umpire. The tribunal suspended him for sixteen weeks, and although most people thought this was a fair (or even lenient) sentence, he took his case to the supreme court, gathering even more unwanted publicity for the club. Despite this, the club had recruited many talented young players in the late 70s who would emerge as club greats. Three of those young players were [[Simon Madden]], [[Tim Watson]] and [[Paul Van Der Haar]]. [[Terry Daniher]] and his brother [[Neale Daniher|Neale]] would come via a trade with [[South Melbourne Swans|South Melbourne]], and [[Roger Merrett]] joined soon afterwards to form the nucleus of what would become the formidable Essendon sides of the 1980s. This raw but talented group of youngsters took Essendon to an elimination final in 1979 under Barry Davis but were again thrashed in an Elimination Final, this time at the hands of Fitzroy. Davis resigned at the end of the 1980 season after missing out on a finals appearance.\n\nOne of the few highlights for Essendon supporters during this time was when Graham Moss won the 1976 [[Brownlow Medal]]; he was the only Bomber to do so in a 40-year span from 1953\u20131993. Even that was bittersweet as he quit VFL football to move back to his native Western Australia, where Moss finished out his career as a player and coach at [[Claremont Football Club]]. In many ways, Moss' career reflects Essendon's mixed fortunes during the decade.\n\n===Kevin Sheedy era (1981\u20132007)===\n[[File:Essendon80s.png|frame|right|175px|Essendon 1980s shield logo]]\n\nFormer [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] player [[Kevin Sheedy (Australian footballer)|Kevin Sheedy]] started as head coach in 1981.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2007/s1846155.htm|title=Sheedy still promoting Indigenous football talent|work=abc.net.au|date=12 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nEssendon reached the Grand Final in 1983, the first time since 1968.

The club played, and beat, Hawthorn in the [[1984 VFL Grand Final]] to win their 13th premiership\u2014their first since 1965. The teams met again in the [[1985 VFL Grand Final|1985 Grand Final]], which Essendon also won. At the start of [[1986 VFL season|1986]], Essendon were considered unbackable for three successive flags, but a succession of injuries to key players [[Paul Van der Haar]] (only fifteen games from 1986 to 1988), [[Tim Watson]], [[Darren Williams (Australian rules footballer)|Darren Williams]], [[Roger Merrett]] and [[Simon Madden]] led the club to win only eight of its last eighteen games in 1986 and only nine games (plus a draw with [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]) in 1987.<ref>Rogers, Stephen; '''Every Game Ever Played; VFL/AFL Results 1897\u20131995'''; pp.687\u2013689. {{ISBN|0-670-90794-4}}</ref> In July 1987, the Bombers suffered a humiliation at the hands of [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]], who fell two points short of scoring the then highest score in VFL history.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qytWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=c-QDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1838%2C9041467|title=A record win puts Swans on target for flag|first=Michael|last=Cockerill|work= Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 July 1987|page=50}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Essendon made a rebound to sixth place with twelve wins, including a 140-point thrashing of Brisbane where they had a record sixteen individual goalkickers.<ref>Rogers; Every game Ever Played; p. 711</ref> In 1989, they rebounded further to second on the ladder with only five losses and thrashed Geelong in the Qualifying Final. However, after a fiery encounter with Hawthorn ended in a convincing defeat, the Bombers were no match for Geelong next week.\n\nIn 1990, Essendon were pace-setters almost from the start, but a disruption from the Qualifying Final draw between Collingwood and [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]] was a blow from which they never recovered. The Magpies comprehensively thrashed them in both the second semi final and the grand final.\n\nFollowing the 1991 season, Essendon moved its home games from its traditional home ground at [[Windy Hill, Essendon|Windy Hill]] to the larger and newly renovated [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]. This move generated large increases in game attendance, membership and revenue for the club. The club's training and administrative base remained at Windy Hill until 2013.\n\nFollowing the retirement of [[Tim Watson]] and [[Simon Madden]] in the early 1990s, the team was built on new players such as [[Gavin Wanganeen]], [[Joe Misiti]], [[Mark Mercuri]], [[Michael Long (footballer)|Michael Long]], [[Dustin Fletcher]] (son of Ken) and [[James Hird]], who was taken at #79 in the 1992 draft.  This side became known as the \"Baby Bombers\", as the core of the side was made up of young players early in their careers.\n\nThe team won the [[1993 AFL Grand Final|1993 Grand Final]] against Carlton and that same year, Gavin Wanganeen won the [[Brownlow Medal]], the first awarded to an Essendon player since 1976. Three years later, James Hird was jointly awarded the medal with [[Michael Voss]] of Brisbane.\n\nIn 2000, Essendon won 20 consecutive matches before they lost to the [[Western Bulldogs]] in round 21. The team went on to win their 16th premiership, defeating {{AFL Mel}}, thereby completing the most dominant single season in AFL/VFL history. The defeat to the Bulldogs was the only defeat for Essendon throughout the entire calendar year (Essendon also won the 2000 pre-season competition).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/01/sports/01iht-rules.2.t.html|title=Essendon Is on Brink of Sporting History : Bombers Bid to Exorcise The Melbourne Demons|work=The New York Times|date=1 September 2000}}</ref>\n\nEssendon was less successful after 2001.

This is the first time a red sash as part of the club jumper and by 1878 there are newspaper reports referring to Essendon players as 'the men in the sash'.\n\nGiven that blue and navy blue were the most popular colours at the time it is thought that Essendon adopted a red sash in 1877 to distinguish its players from others in similar coloured jumpers.\n\n====Clash jumpers====\n\nIn 2007, the AFL Commission laid down the requirement that all clubs must produce an alternative jumper for use in matches where jumpers are considered to clash.

However, this version is occasionally played at club functions.\n\n===Mascot===\nThe club's mascot is named \"Skeeta Reynolds\". Named after Dick Reynolds, he is a mosquito and was created in honour of the team's back-to-back premiership sides in the 1920s known as the \"Mosquito Fleet\". He was first named through a competition run in the Bomber magazine with \"Skeeta\" being the winning entry. This was later changed to \"Skeeta Reynolds\". He appears as a red mosquito in an Essendon jumper and wears a red and black scarf.\n\n==Membership==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n! Year !!

Matches between the clubs are often close regardless of form and ladder positions. If out of the race themselves, all four have the desire to deny the others a finals spot or a premiership. Essendon also has a fierce rivalry with Hawthorn stemming from the 1980s.\n\n* '''{{AFL Car}}''' \u2013 The rivalry between Essendon and Carlton is considered one of the strongest in the league. With the teams sharing the record of 16 premierships, both sides are keen to become outright leader, or if out of the finals race, at least ensure the other doesn't. In recent years, the rivalry has thickened, with Carlton beating the 1999 Minor Premiers and premiership favourites by 1 point in the [[1999 AFL First Preliminary Final|Preliminary Final]]. Other notable meetings between the two clubs include the [[1908 VFL Grand Final|1908]], [[1947 VFL Grand Final|1947]], [[1949 VFL season|1949]], [[1962 VFL Grand Final|1962]] and [[1968 VFL Grand Final]]s and [[1993 AFL Grand Final]], with some decided by small margins.\n* '''{{AFL Col}}''' \u2013 In the early days of the VFL, this rivalry grew out of several Grand Final meetings \u2013 [[1901 VFL season|1901]], [[1902 VFL season|1902]] and [[1911 VFL season|1911]]. The teams didn't meet again in a Grand Final until [[1990 AFL Grand Final|1990]] when Collingwood won to draw level with the Bombers on 14 premierships and denying the Bombers a chance to join Carlton on 15. Since 1995 the rivalry has been even more fierce with the clubs facing off against each other in the [[Anzac Day clash]], a match which is described as the second biggest of the season, behind only the Grand Final. Being possibly the two biggest football clubs in Victoria, regardless of their position on the ladder, this game always attracts a huge crowd and it is a match both teams have a desire to win even if it is their only win for the season.\n* '''{{AFL Ric}}''' \u2013 This rivalry stems out of the 1942 Grand Final which Essendon won. In 1974, a half time brawl took place involving trainers, officials and players at Windy Hill and has become infamous as one of the biggest ever. The teams didn't meet in the finals between 1944 and 1995, but there have been many close margins in home and away season matches as a result of each team's \"never say die\" attitude and ability to come back from significant margins in the dying stages of matches. Having met in the AFL's ''Rivalry Round'' in ([[2006 AFL Season|2006]] and [[2009 AFL season|2009]]) and meeting in the [[Dreamtime at the 'G]] match since 2005, the rivalry and passion between the clubs and supporters has re-ignited. In recent years the rivalry has been promoted as the \"Clash of the Sash.\" <ref>http://www.essendonfc.com.au/news/2014-08-06/clash-of-the-sash</ref>\n[[File:Ball is in dispute in Hawthorn-Essendon AFL match.jpg|thumb|The rivalry with archrival Hawthorn stemmed from their meetings in a number of grand finals in the mid-1980s]]\n\n* '''{{AFL Haw}}''' \u2013 The two sides had a number of physical encounters in the mid-1980s when they were the top two sides of the competition. The rivalry was exacerbated when [[Dermott Brereton]] ran through Essendon's three-quarter time huddle during a match in 1988 and again by an all in brawl during a match in 2004 allegedly instigated by Brereton (now known as the [[Line in the Sand Match]] after the direction allegedly given by Brereton for the Hawthorn players to make a physical stand). This was reminiscent of the 1980s when battles with Hawthorn were often hard and uncompromising affairs. During round 22 of the 2009 season Essendon and Hawthorn played for the last finals spot up for grabs. The teams played out an extremely physical game and despite being 22 points down at half time Essendon went on to win by 17 points. The game included a brawl shortly after half time sparked by Essendon's captain [[Matthew Lloyd]] knocking out Hawthorn midfielder [[Brad Sewell]], which led Hawthorn's [[Campbell Brown (footballer)|Campbell Brown]] to label Lloyd a 'sniper', and promised revenge if Lloyd played on in 2010.\n* '''{{AFL Nor}}''' \u2013 One of the most fierce rivalries in the AFL can be traced back to 1896, when several clubs including Essendon, broke away from the Victorian Football Association to form the Victorian Football League. North were a contender to join in the breakaway competition, but Essendon rejected North mainly due Essendon feeling threatened by North's proximity and the fact their inclusion could drain Essendon of vital talent. North supporters have not forgiven Essendon for the decision and have blamed the Bombers on their small supporter base and gate revenue. North were finally admitted into the VFL in 1925 alongside Footscray and Hawthorn. In 1950, the two sides met in their first and only grand final meeting to date, which Essendon won by 38 points. The rivalry was re-ignited in the 1990s due to the on field success of the two sides and continues to this day. A meeting of the two rivals at the MCG in the [[2014 AFL finals series]] in the 2nd elimination final resulted in North winning by 12 points.\n\n==Organisation and finance==\n\n===Board===\n: ''For the full list, see [[List of VFL/AFL presidents#Essendon FC|List of VFL/AFL presidents]]''\n[[Lindsay Tanner]] has served as chairman of the board since late 2015.\n\nEssendon's board members are Paul Brasher, Melissa Verner Green, [[Sean Wellman]], David Barham, Catherine Lio, [[Ken Lay (police officer)|Ken Lay]], [[Simon Madden]], Andrew Muir and [[Lindsay Tanner]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Essendon chairman Paul Little has the support of Labor MP Lindsay Tanner, who was touted as possible boardroom challenger|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/essendon-chairman-paul-little-has-the-support-of-labor-mp-lindsay-tanner-who-was-touted-as-possible-boardroom-challenger/story-fni5f6kv-1227435794389|publisher=The Herald Sun|date=9 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Major sponsor===\nOn 25 August 2008, Samsung was announced as major sponsor of the Essendon Football Club in a three-year deal touted as the biggest individual annual club sponsorship in AFL history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Samsung announced as 2009 major partner |date=25 August 2008 |url=http://www.essendonfc.com.au/news/news.asp?nid=6035 |publisher=Essendon Football Club |location=Melbourne |accessdate=22 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106201728/http://www.essendonfc.com.au/news/news.asp?nid=6035 |archivedate=6 January 2009 }}</ref> The deal included Samsung having naming rights on the front and back of the club jumper and signage.

League]]'s reserves competition when the competition was established in 1919. The team enjoyed success in the form of eight premierships between 1919 and 1999, including the last [[Victorian State Football League]] year in 1999. From 2000 until 2002, the club's reserves team competed in the new [[Victorian Football League]] competition.\n\nAt the end of 2002, the club dissolved its reserves team and established a [[Australian Football League reserves affiliations|reserves affiliation]] with the [[Bendigo Football Club]] in the VFL. The affiliation ran for ten years from 2003 until 2012, allowing reserves players from the Essendon list to play with Bendigo.\n\nThe club re-established its reserves team in 2013, seeking greater developmental autonomy. The reserves team has since competed in the VFL. The team plays its home games at [[Windy Hill, Essendon|Windy Hill]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Landsberger|first=Sam|title=Josh Toy and Matthew Bate set to play on with Essendon|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/afl/more-news/josh-toy-and-matthew-bate-set-to-play-on-with-essendon/story-e6frf9jf-1226550441122|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=9 January 2013}}</ref> The team is made up of AFL senior listed players and VFL contracted players.\n\n{{Div col}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"6\"|'''Premierships (8)'''\n|-\n!Year \n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Venue\n|-\n| [[1921 VFL season|1921]] || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] || '''10.9 (69) \u2013 8.13 (61)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1941 VFL season|1941]] || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] || '''12.16 (88) \u2013 9.17 (71)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1950 VFL season|1950]] || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] || '''12.8 (80) \u2013 8.7 (55)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1952 VFL season|1952]] || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] || '''7.14 (56) \u2013 4.5 (29)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1968 VFL season|1968]] || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] || '''15.7 (97) \u2013 13.14 (92)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1983 VFL season|1983]] || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] || '''19.14 (128) \u2013 15.9 (99)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1992 AFL season|1992]] || [[Victorian State Football League|VSFL]]|| [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] || '''18.19 (127) \u2013 14.10 (94)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1999 AFL season|1999]] || [[Victorian State Football League|AFL Reserves (VSFL)]]|| [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] || '''20.13 (133) \u2013 11.10 (76)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"6\"|'''Runners-up (10)'''\n|-\n!Year \n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Venue\n|-\n| [[1922 VFL season|1922]] || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] || '''1.9 (15) \u2013 8.10 (58)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1924 VFL season|1924]] || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] || '''Did Not Play'''{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Kardinia Park]]<!-- Match was moved from Geelong's home ground at Corio Oval to the then-neutral Kardinia Park -->\n|-\n| [[1932 VFL season|1932]] || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] || '''4.10 (34) \u2013 8.12 (60)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1949 VFL season|1949]] || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] || '''9.14 (68) \u2013 17.10 (112)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1951 VFL season|1951]] || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] || '''7.9 (51) \u2013 8.15 (63)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1953 VFL season|1953]] || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] || '''11.7 (73) \u2013 15.7 (97)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1971 VFL season|1971]] || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] || '''8.18 (66) \u2013 14.14 (98)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1981 VFL season|1981]] || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] || '''18.6 (114) \u2013 21.14 (140)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1996 AFL season|1996]] || [[Victorian State Football League|AFL Reserves (VSFL)]]|| [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] || '''7.10 (52) \u2013 23.18 (156)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1998 AFL season|1998]] || [[Victorian State Football League|AFL Reserves (VSFL)]]|| [[Footscray Football Club|Footscray]] || '''12.8 (80) \u2013 20.16 (136)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|}\n{{Div col end}}\n{{note label|1|a}} Essendon refused to play the Grand Final in Geelong, so the premiership was awarded to Geelong.\n\n==Other ventures==\nEssendon also has a women's team that competes in the women's VFL.

Blyton's books are still enormously popular, and have been translated into 90 languages; her first book, ''[[Child Whispers]]'', a 24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922. She wrote on a wide range of topics including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her [[Noddy (character)|Noddy]], [[The Famous Five (novel series)|Famous Five]], [[The Secret Seven|Secret Seven]] and [[Malory Towers]] series.\n\nFollowing the commercial success of her early novels such as ''[[The Wishing-Chair (series)|Adventures of the Wishing-Chair]]'' (1937) and ''[[The Enchanted Wood (novel)|The Enchanted Wood]]'' (1939), Blyton went on to build a literary empire, sometimes producing fifty books a year in addition to her prolific magazine and newspaper contributions. Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind; she typed her stories as events unfolded before her. The sheer volume of her work and the speed with which it was produced led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of [[ghost writer]]s, a charge she vigorously denied.\n\nBlyton's work became increasingly controversial among literary critics, teachers and parents from the 1950s onwards, because of the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and the themes of her books, particularly the Noddy series. Some libraries and schools banned her works, which the [[BBC]] had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they were perceived to lack literary merit. Her books have been criticised as being [[elitism|elitist]], [[sexism|sexist]], [[racism|racist]], [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] and at odds with the more liberal environment emerging in post-war Britain, but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968.\n\nBlyton felt she had a responsibility to provide her readers with a strong moral framework, so she encouraged them to support worthy causes. In particular, through the clubs she set up or supported, she encouraged and organised them to raise funds for animal and [[paediatric]] charities. The story of Blyton's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled ''[[Enid (film)|Enid]]'', featuring [[Helena Bonham Carter]] in the title role and first broadcast in the United Kingdom on [[BBC Four]] in 2009. There have also been several adaptations of her books for stage, screen and television.\n\n==Early life and education==\nEnid Blyton was born on 11 August 1897 in [[East Dulwich]], South London, the oldest of the three children, to Thomas Carey Blyton (1870\u20131920), a [[cutlery]] salesman, and his wife Theresa Mary ({{n\u00e9e}} Harrison; 1874\u20131950). Enid's younger brothers, Hanly (1899\u20131983) and Carey (1902\u20131976), were born after the family had moved to a semi-detached villa in [[Beckenham]], then a village in [[Kent]].{{r|EBSChrono}} A few months after her birth Enid almost died from [[whooping cough]], but was nursed back to health by her father, whom she adored.{{sfnp|Baverstock|1997|p=5|ps=none}} Thomas Blyton ignited Enid's interest in nature; in her autobiography she wrote that he \"loved flowers and birds and wild animals, and knew more about them than anyone I had ever met\".{{sfnp|Blyton|1952|p=54|ps=none}} He also passed on his interest in gardening, art, music, literature and the theatre, and the pair often went on nature walks, much to the disapproval of Enid's mother, who showed little interest in her daughter's pursuits.{{r|EBSBio}} Enid was devastated when he left the family shortly after her thirteenth birthday to live with another woman. Enid and her mother did not have a good relationship, and she did not attend either of her parents' funerals.{{sfnp|Thompson|Keenan|2006|p=77|ps=none}}\n\nFrom 1907 to 1915 Blyton attended St Christopher's School in Beckenham, where she enjoyed physical activities and became school tennis champion and captain of [[lacrosse]].{{sfnp|Druce|1992|p=9|ps=none}} She was not so keen on all the academic subjects but excelled in writing, and in 1911 she entered [[Arthur Mee]]'s children's poetry competition. Mee offered to print her verses, encouraging her to produce more.{{r|EBSChrono}} Blyton's mother considered her efforts at writing to be a \"waste of time and money\", but she was encouraged to persevere by Mabel Attenborough, the aunt of a school friend.{{r|EBSBio}}\n[[File:Seckford Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1000225.jpg|thumb|right|[[Seckford Hall]] in [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]], Suffolk, was an inspiration to Blyton with its haunted room, secret passageway and sprawling gardens.]]\n\nBlyton's father taught her to play the piano, which she mastered well enough for him to believe that she might follow in his sister's footsteps and become a professional musician.{{sfnp|Druce|1992|p=9|ps=none}} Blyton considered enrolling at the [[Guildhall School of Music]], but decided she was better suited to becoming a writer.{{r|ODNB}} After finishing school in 1915 as [[Head girl and head boy|head girl]], she moved out of the family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough, before going to stay with George and Emily Hunt at [[Seckford Hall]] near [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]] in [[Suffolk]]. Seckford Hall, with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway provided inspiration for her later writing.{{r|EBSChrono}} At Woodbridge Congregational Church Blyton met Ida Hunt, who taught at [[Ipswich High School (Suffolk)|Ipswich High School]], and suggested that she train as a teacher.{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 377|ps=none}} Blyton was introduced to the children at the nursery school, and recognising her natural affinity with them she enrolled in a [[National Froebel Foundation|National Froebel Union]] teacher training course at the school in September 1916.{{r|ODNB}}{{r|BhimaniEdu}} By this time she had almost ceased contact with her family.{{r|EBSChrono}}\n\nBlyton's manuscripts had been rejected by publishers on many occasions, which only made her more determined to succeed: \"it is partly the struggle that helps you so much, that gives you determination, character, self-reliance&nbsp;\u2013 all things that help in any profession or trade, and most certainly in writing\". In March 1916 her first poems were published in ''Nash's Magazine''.{{r|EBSWriter}} She completed her teacher training course in December 1918, and the following month obtained a teaching appointment at Bickley Park School, a small independent establishment for boys in [[Bickley]], Kent. Two months later Blyton received a teaching certificate with distinctions in zoology and principles of education, 1st class in botany, geography, practice and history of education, child hygiene and class teaching and 2nd class in literature and elementary mathematics.{{r|EBSChrono}} In 1920 she moved to Southernhay in Hook Road [[Surbiton]] as nursery governess to the four sons of architect Horace Thompson and his wife Gertrude,{{r|ODNB}} with whom Blyton spent four happy years. Owing to a shortage of schools in the area her charges were soon joined by the children of neighbours, and a small school developed at the house.{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 552|ps=none}}\n\n==Early writing career==\n{{details|topic=works by Enid Blyton|Enid Blyton bibliography}}\nIn 1920 Blyton relocated to [[Chessington]], and began writing in her spare time. The following year she won the ''Saturday Westminster Review'' writing competition with her essay \"On the Popular Fallacy that to the Pure All Things are Pure\".{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 624\u2013630|ps=none}} Publications such as ''[[The Londoner]]'', ''Home Weekly'' and ''[[The Bystander]]'' began to show an interest in her short stories and poems.{{r|EBSChrono}}\n\n[[File:ChildWhispers.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Child Whispers]]'' (1922)]]\nBlyton's first book, ''[[Child Whispers]]'', a 24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922.{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 624\u2013630|ps=none}} It was illustrated by a schoolfriend, [[Phyllis Chase]], who collaborated on several of her early works.{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 645|ps=none}} Also in that year Blyton began writing in annuals for [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell]] and [[George Newnes]], and her first piece of writing, \"Peronel and his Pot of Glue\", was accepted for publication in ''[[Teachers' World]]''. Her success was boosted in 1923 when her poems were published alongside those of [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Walter de la Mare]] and [[G. K. Chesterton]] in a special issue of ''Teachers' World''. Blyton's educational texts were quite influential in the 1920s and '30s, her most sizeable being the three-volume ''The Teacher's Treasury'' (1926), the six-volume ''Modern Teaching'' (1928), the ten-volume ''Pictorial Knowledge'' (1930), and the four-volume ''Modern Teaching in the Infant School'' (1932).{{sfnp|Rudd|2004|p=112|ps=none}}\n\nIn July 1923 Blyton published ''Real Fairies'', a collection of thirty-three poems written especially for the book with the exception of \"Pretending\", which had appeared earlier in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine.{{r|RealFairies}} The following year she published ''The Enid Blyton Book of Fairies'',  illustrated by Horace J. Knowles,{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 944\u2013951|ps=none}} and in 1926 the ''[[Book of Brownies]]''.{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 3804|ps=none}} Several books of plays appeared in 1927, including ''A Book of Little Plays'' and ''The Play's the Thing'' with the illustrator [[Alfred Bestall]].{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 3810|ps=none}}\n\nIn the 1930s Blyton developed an interest in writing stories related to various myths, including those of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]]; ''The Knights of the Round Table'', ''Tales of Ancient Greece'' and ''Tales of Robin Hood'' were published in 1930. In ''Tales of Ancient Greece'' Blyton retold sixteen well-known ancient Greek myths, but used the Latin rather than the Greek names of deities and invented conversations between the characters.{{sfnp|Brazouski|Klatt|1994|p=25|ps=none}} ''The Adventures of Odysseus'', ''Tales of the Ancient Greeks and Persians'' and ''Tales of the Romans'' followed in 1934.{{sfnp|Commire|1981|p=57|ps=none}}\n\n==Commercial success==\n\n===New series: 1934\u20131948===\nThe first of twenty-eight books in Blyton's [[Old Thatch series]], ''The Talking Teapot and Other Tales'', was published in 1934, the same year as the first book in her [[Brer Rabbit]] series, ''Brer Rabbit Retold'';{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 3910|ps=none}} (note that Brer Rabbit originally featured in [[Uncle Remus]] stories by [[Joel Chandler Harris]]), her first serial story and first full-length book, ''[[The Wishing-Chair (series)|Adventures of the Wishing-Chair]]'', followed in 1937. ''[[The Enchanted Wood (novel)|The Enchanted Wood]]'', the first book in the [[The Faraway Tree|Faraway Tree series]], published in 1939, is about a magic tree inspired by the [[Norse mythology]] that had fascinated Blyton as a child.{{r|ODNB}} According to Blyton's daughter Gillian the inspiration for the magic tree came from \"thinking up a story one day and suddenly she was walking in the enchanted wood and found the tree. In her imagination she climbed up through the branches and met Moon-Face, Silky, the Saucepan Man and the rest of the characters. She had all she needed.\"{{r|Herald06}} As in the Wishing-Chair series, these fantasy books typically involve children being transported into a magical world in which they meet [[fairy|fairies]], [[goblins]], [[elves]], [[pixie]]s and other mythological creatures.\n\nBlyton's first full-length adventure novel, ''The Secret Island'', was published in 1938, featuring the characters of Jack, Mike, Peggy and Nora.{{r|SecretIsland}} Described by ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Glasgow Herald]]'' as a \"[[Robinson Crusoe]]-style adventure on an island in an English lake\", ''The Secret Island'' was a lifelong favourite of Gillian's and spawned the [[The Secret Series (Enid Blyton)|Secret series]].{{r|Herald06}} The following year Blyton released her first book in the [[The Circus Series|Circus series]]{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 4096|ps=none}} and her initial book in the [[Amelia Jane]] series, ''Naughty Amelia Jane!''{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 4102|ps=none}} According to Gillian the main character was based on a large handmade doll given to her by her mother on her third birthday.{{r|Herald06}}\n\nDuring the 1940s Blyton became a prolific author, her success enhanced by her \"marketing, publicity and branding that was far ahead of its time\".{{r|Telegraph09}} In 1940 Blyton published two books&nbsp;\u2013 ''Three Boys and a Circus'' and ''Children of Kidillin''&nbsp;\u2013 under the pseudonym of Mary Pollock (middle name plus first married name),{{sfnp|Bluemel|2009|p=209|ps=none}} in addition to the eleven published under her own name that year. So popular were Pollock's books that one reviewer was prompted to observe that \"Enid Blyton had better look to her laurels\".{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 1937\u20131944|ps=none}} But Blyton's readers were not so easily deceived and many complained about the subterfuge to her and her publisher,{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 1937\u20131944|ps=none}} with the result that all six books published under the name of Mary Pollock&nbsp;\u2013 two in 1940 and four in 1943&nbsp;\u2013 were reissued under Blyton's name.{{r|MaryPollock}} Later in 1940 Blyton published the first of her [[boarding school story]] books and the first novel in the [[The Naughtiest Girl|Naughtiest Girl]] series, ''[[The Naughtiest Girl in the School]]'', which followed the exploits of the mischievous schoolgirl Elizabeth Allen at the fictional Whyteleafe School. The first of her six novels in the [[St. Clare's (series)|St. Clare's]] series, ''[[The Twins at St. Clare's]]'', appeared the following year, featuring the twin sisters Patricia and Isabel O'Sullivan.{{sfnp|Rudd|2004|p=112|ps=none}}\n\nIn 1942 Blyton released the first book in the [[Mary Mouse]] series, ''Mary Mouse and the Dolls' House'', about a mouse exiled from her mousehole who becomes a maid at a dolls' house.

Blyton rewrote the stories so they could be adapted into cartoons, which appeared in ''Mickey Mouse Weekly'' in 1951 with illustrations by George Brook. The French author [[Evelyne Lallemand]] continued the series in the 1970s, producing an additional twelve books, nine of which were translated into English by [[Anthea Bell]] between 1983 and 1987.{{sfnp|Blyton|2013b|p=66|ps=none}}\n\n[[File:Beaconsfield Themed Fencing - geograph.org.uk - 1386378.jpg|thumb|right|Blyton's characters [[Noddy (character)|Noddy]] and [[Big Ears (character)|Big Ears]]]]\nBlyton's [[Noddy (character)|Noddy]], about a little wooden boy from Toyland, first appeared in the ''Sunday Graphic'' on 5 June 1949, and in November that year ''[[Noddy Goes to Toyland]]'', the first of at least two dozen books in the series, was published. The idea was conceived by one of Blyton's publishers, Sampson, Low, Marston and Company, who in 1949 arranged a meeting between Blyton and the Dutch illustrator [[Harmsen van der Beek]]. Despite having to communicate via an interpreter, he provided some initial sketches of how Toyland and its characters would be represented. Four days after the meeting Blyton sent the text of the first two Noddy books to her publisher, to be forwarded to van der Beek.{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 2444\u20132463|ps=none}} The Noddy books became one of her most successful and best-known series, and were hugely popular in the 1950s.{{sfnp|Palmer|2013|p=130|ps=none}} An extensive range of sub-series, spin-offs and strip books were produced throughout the decade, including ''Noddy's Library'', ''Noddy's Garage of Books'', ''Noddy's Castle of Books'', ''Noddy's Toy Station of Books'' and ''Noddy's Shop of Books''.{{r|Noddy books}}\n\nIn 1950 Blyton established the company Darrell Waters Ltd to manage her affairs.

In 1962 many of her books were among the first to be published by [[Armada Books]] in paperback, making them more affordable to children.{{r|EBSChrono}}\n\nAfter 1963 Blyton's output was generally confined to short stories and books intended for very young readers, such as ''Learn to Count with Noddy'' and ''Learn to Tell Time with Noddy'' in 1965, and ''Stories for Bedtime'' and the Sunshine Picture Story Book collection in 1966. Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal reasons for this change in trend.{{sfnp|Briggs|Butts|Orville Grenby|2008|p=265|ps=none}} Blyton published her last book in the Noddy series, ''Noddy and the Aeroplane'', in February 1964.

She rarely left England, preferring to holiday by the English coast, almost invariably in Dorset,{{sfnp|Druce|1992|p=29|ps=none}} where she and her husband took over the lease of an 18-hole golf course at [[Studland|Studland Bay]] in 1951.{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 2154|ps=none}}}} according to Druce almost inevitably presented the danger that she might unconsciously, and clearly did, plagiarise the books she had read, including her own.{{sfnp|Druce|1992|p=29|ps=none}} Gillian has recalled that her mother \"never knew where her stories came from\", but that she used to talk about them \"coming from her 'mind's eye{{'}}\", as did [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Charles Dickens]]. Blyton had \"thought it was made up of every experience she'd ever had, everything she's seen or heard or read, much of which had long disappeared from her conscious memory\" but never knew the direction her stories would take.  Blyton further explained in her biography that \"If I tried to think out or invent the whole book, I could not do it. For one thing, it would bore me and for another, it would lack the 'verve' and the extraordinary touches and surprising ideas that flood out from my imagination.\"{{r|Herald06}}\n\nBlyton's daily routine varied little over the years. She usually began writing soon after breakfast, with her portable typewriter on her knee and her favourite red Moroccan shawl nearby; she believed that the colour red acted as a \"mental stimulus\" for her. Stopping only for a short lunch break she continued writing until five o'clock, by which time she would usually have produced 6,000\u201310,000 words.{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 1859|ps=none}}\n\nA 2000 article in ''[[The Malay Mail]]'' considers Blyton's children to have \"lived in a world shaped by the realities of post-war austerity\", enjoying freedom without the political correctness of today, which serves modern readers of Blyton's novels with a form of escapism.{{r|MM00}} Brandon Robshaw of ''The Independent'' refers to the Blyton universe as  \"crammed with colour and character\", \"self-contained and internally consistent\", noting that Blyton exemplifies a strong mistrust of adults and figures of authority in her works, creating a world in which children govern.{{r|Ind04}} Gillian noted that in her mother's adventure, detective and school stories for older children, \"the hook is the strong storyline with plenty of cliffhangers, a trick she acquired from her years of writing serialised stories for children's magazines. There is always a strong moral framework in which bravery and loyalty are (eventually) rewarded\".{{r|Herald06}} Blyton herself wrote that \"my love of children is the whole foundation of all my work\".{{r|NoddyBBC}}\n\nVictor Watson, Assistant Director of Research at [[Homerton College, Cambridge]], believes that Blyton's works reveal an \"essential longing and potential associated with childhood\", and notes how the opening pages of ''The Mountain of Adventure'' present a \"deeply appealing ideal of childhood\".{{sfnp|Watson|2000|p=88|ps=none}} He argues that Blyton's work differs from that of many other authors in its approach, describing the narrative of The Famous Five series for instance as \"like a powerful spotlight, it seeks to illuminate, to explain, to demystify. It takes its readers on a roller-coaster story in which the darkness is always banished; everything puzzling, arbitrary, evocative is either dismissed or explained\". Watson further notes how Blyton often used minimalist visual descriptions and introduced a few careless phrases such as \"gleamed enchantingly\" to appeal to her young readers.{{sfnp|Watson|2000|p=89|ps=none}}\n\nFrom the mid-1950s rumours began to circulate that Blyton had not written all the books attributed to her, a charge she found particularly distressing. She published an appeal in her magazine asking children to let her know if they heard such stories and, after one mother informed her that she had attended a parents' meeting at her daughter's school during which a young librarian had repeated the allegation,{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 2625\u20132645|ps=none}} Blyton decided in 1955 to begin legal proceedings.{{r|EBSChrono}} The librarian was eventually forced to make a public apology in open court early the following year, but the rumours that Blyton operated \"a 'company' of ghost writers\" persisted, as some found it difficult to believe that one woman working alone could produce such a volume of work.{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 2645|ps=none}}\n\n==Charitable work==\nBlyton felt a responsibility to provide her readers with a positive moral framework, and she encouraged them to support worthy causes.{{r|BiographicalEncyclopedia}} Her view, expressed in a 1957 article, was that children should help animals and other children rather than adults:\n{{quote|[children] are not interested in helping adults; indeed, they think that adults themselves should tackle adult needs. But they are intensely interested in animals and other children and feel compassion for the blind boys and girls, and for the spastics who are unable to walk or talk.{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 2219\u20132225|ps=none}}}}\n\nBlyton and the members of the children's clubs she promoted via her magazines raised a great deal of money for various charities; according to Blyton, membership of her clubs meant \"working for others, for no reward\". The largest of the clubs she was involved with was the Busy Bees, the junior section of the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]], which Blyton had actively supported since 1933. The club had been set up by [[Maria Dickin]] in 1934,{{r|Timeline}} and after Blyton publicised its existence in the ''Enid Blyton Magazine'' it attracted 100,000 members in three years.{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 2228\u20132234|ps=none}} Such was Blyton's popularity among children that after she became Queen Bee in 1952 more than 20,000 additional members were recruited in her first year in office.{{r|Timeline}} The Enid Blyton Magazine Club was formed in 1953.{{r|EBSChrono}} Its primary objective was to raise funds to help those children with [[cerebral palsy]] who attended a centre in [[Cheyne Walk]], in Chelsea, London, by furnishing an on-site hostel among other things.{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 2262\u20132268|ps=none}}\n\nThe Famous Five series gathered such a following that readers asked Blyton if they might form a fan club.

The baby would have been Darrell Waters's first child and it would also have been the son for which both of them longed.{{r|EBSBio}}\n\nHer love of tennis included playing [[naked]], with nude tennis \"a common practice in those days among the more louche members of the middle classes\".{{sfnp|Naismith|Garden|2013|p=116|ps=none}}{{r|Naturism}}\n\nBlyton's health began to deteriorate in 1957, when during a round of golf she started to complain of feeling faint and breathless,{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 2683|ps=none}} and by 1960 she was displaying signs of [[dementia]].{{sfnp|Greenfield|1995|p=127|ps=none}} Her agent George Greenfield recalled that it was \"unthinkable\" for the \"most famous and successful of children's authors with her enormous energy and computer-like memory\" to be losing her mind and suffering from what is now known as [[Alzheimer's disease]] in her mid-sixties.{{sfnp|Greenfield|1995|p=127|ps=none}} Blyton's situation was worsened by her husband's declining health throughout the 1960s; he suffered from severe [[arthritis]] in his neck and hips, deafness, and became increasingly ill-tempered and erratic until his death on 15 September 1967.{{sfnp|Matthew|1999|p=70|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Greenfield|1995|p=129|ps=none}}\n\nThe story of Blyton's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled ''[[Enid (film)|Enid]]'', which aired in the United Kingdom on [[BBC Four]] on 16 November 2009.{{r|DigitalSpy}} [[Helena Bonham Carter]], who played the title role, described Blyton as \"a complete workaholic, an achievement junkie and an extremely canny businesswoman\" who \"knew how to brand herself, right down to the famous signature\".{{r|Telegraph09}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Blyton blue plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Blue plaque on Blyton's childhood home in Ondine Street, [[East Dulwich]]]]\nDuring the months following her husband's death Blyton became increasingly ill, and moved into a nursing home three months before her death. She died at the Greenways Nursing Home, Hampstead, North London, on 28 November 1968, aged 71. A memorial service was held at [[St James's Church, Piccadilly]],{{r|EBSChrono}} and she was cremated at [[Golders Green Crematorium]], where her ashes remain. Blyton's home, Green Hedges, was auctioned on 26 May 1971 and demolished in 1973;{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 117|ps=none}} the site is now occupied by houses and a street named Blyton Close. An [[English Heritage]] [[blue plaque]] commemorates Blyton at Hook Road in [[Chessington]], where she lived from 1920 to 1924.{{r|EngHet}} In 2014 a plaque recording her time as a Beaconsfield resident from 1938 until her death in 1968 was unveiled in the town hall gardens, next to small iron figures of Noddy and Big Ears.{{r|BeaconsfieldPlaque}}\n\nSince her death and the publication of her daughter Imogen's 1989 autobiography, ''A Childhood at Green Hedges'', Blyton has emerged as an emotionally immature, unstable and often malicious figure.{{r|Telegraph09}} Imogen considered her mother to be \"arrogant, insecure, pretentious, very skilled at putting difficult or unpleasant things out of her mind, and without a trace of maternal instinct. As a child, I viewed her as a rather strict authority. As an adult I pitied her.\"{{r|Brandreth}} Blyton's eldest daughter Gillian remembered her rather differently however, as \"a fair and loving mother, and a fascinating companion\".{{r|Brandreth}}\n\nThe Enid Blyton Trust for Children was established in 1982 with Imogen as its first chairman,{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 2910\u20132916|ps=none}} and in 1985 it established the National Library for the Handicapped Child.{{r|ODNB}} ''Enid Blyton's Adventure Magazine'' began publication in September 1985, and on 14 October 1992 the BBC began publishing ''Noddy Magazine'' and released the Noddy CD-Rom in October 1996.{{r|EBSChrono}}\n\nThe first Enid Blyton Day was held at [[Rickmansworth]] on 6 March 1993, and in October 1996 the Enid Blyton award, The Enid, was given to those who have made outstanding contributions towards children.{{r|EBSChrono}} The [[Enid Blyton Society]] was formed in early 1995, to provide \"a focal point for collectors and enthusiasts of Enid Blyton\" through its thrice-annual ''Enid Blyton Society Journal'', its annual Enid Blyton Day, and its website.{{r|Welcome}} On 16 December 1996 [[Channel 4]] broadcast a documentary about Blyton, ''Secret Lives''. To celebrate her centenary in 1997 exhibitions were put on at the London Toy & Model Museum (now closed), [[Hereford and Worcester County Museum]] and Bromley Library, and on 9 September the [[Royal Mail]] issued centenary stamps.{{r|EBSChrono}}\n\nThe London-based entertainment and retail company Trocadero plc purchased Blyton's Darrell Waters Ltd in 1995 for \u00a314.6 million and established a subsidiary, Enid Blyton Ltd, to handle all intellectual properties, character brands and media in Blyton's works.{{r|EBSChrono}}{{r|ODNB}} The group changed its name to [[Chorion (company)|Chorion]] in 1998, but after financial difficulties in 2012 sold its assets. [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette UK]] acquired from Chorion world rights in the Blyton estate in March 2013, including The Famous Five series{{r|Bookseller}} but excluding the rights to Noddy, which had been sold to [[DreamWorks Classics]] (formerly Classic Media, now a subsidiary of DreamWorks Animation){{r|HollywoodReporter}} in 2012.\n\nBlyton's granddaughter, Sophie Smallwood, wrote a new Noddy book to celebrate the character's 60th birthday, 46 years after the last book was published; ''Noddy and the Farmyard Muddle'' (2009) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall.{{r|Noddys60th}} In February 2011, the manuscript of a previously unknown Blyton novel, ''Mr Tumpy's Caravan'', was discovered by the archivist at [[Seven Stories]], National Centre for Children's Books in a collection of papers belonging to Blyton's daughter Gillian, purchased by [[Seven Stories]] in 2010 following her death.{{r|StoryFound}}{{r|BBCTumpy}} It was initially thought to belong to a comic strip collection of the same name published in 1949, but it appears to be unrelated and is believed to be something written in the 1930s, which had been rejected by a publisher.{{r|BBCTumpy}}{{r|Unseen}}\n\nIn a 1982 survey of 10,000 eleven-year-old children Blyton was voted their most popular writer.{{r|EBSChrono}} She is the [[list of most-translated individual authors|world's fourth most-translated author]], behind [[Agatha Christie]], [[Jules Verne]] and [[William Shakespeare]]{{r|UNESCOTranslation}} with her books being translated into 90 languages.{{r|Times2012}} From 2000 to 2010, Blyton was listed as a Top Ten author, selling almost 8 million copies (worth \u00a331.2 million) in the UK alone.{{r|MacArthur}} In 2003 ''[[The Magic Faraway Tree]]'' was voted 66 in the BBC's [[Big Read]].{{r|BigRead}}  In the 2008 Costa Book Awards, Blyton was voted Britain's best-loved author.{{r|MostLoved}}{{r|BestLoved}} Her books continue to be very popular among children in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations such as India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malta, New Zealand, and Australia, and around the world.{{r|SundayObserver}} They have also seen a surge of popularity in China, where they are \"big with every generation\".{{r|MM00}} In March 2004 Chorion and the Chinese publisher Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press negotiated an agreement over the Noddy franchise, which included bringing the character to an animated series on television, with a potential audience of a further 95 million children under the age of five.{{r|NoddyInChina}}{{r|Mirror}} Chorion spent around \u00a310 million digitising Noddy, and as of 2002 had made television agreements with at least 11 countries worldwide.{{r|Scotsman2002}}\n\nNovelists influenced by Blyton include the crime writer [[Denise Danks]], whose fictional detective Georgina Powers is based on George from the Famous Five. [[Peter Hunt (literary critic)|Peter Hunt]]'s ''A Step off the Path'' (1985) is also influenced by the Famous Five, and the St. Clare's and Malory Towers series provided the inspiration for [[Jacqueline Wilson]]'s ''Double Act'' (1996) and [[Ad\u00e8le Geras]]'s Egerton Hall trilogy (1990\u201392) respectively.{{sfnp|Rudd|2004|p=114|ps=none}}\n\n==Critical backlash==\nBlyton's range of plots and settings has been described as limited and continually recycled.{{sfnp|Druce|1992|p=29|ps=none}} Responding to claims that her moral views were \"dependably predictable\",{{sfnp|Druce|1992|p=213|ps=none}} Blyton commented that \"most of you could write down perfectly correctly all the things that I believe in and stand for&nbsp;\u2013 you have found them in my books, and a writer's books are always a faithful reflection of himself\".{{sfnp|Blyton|1952|p=104|ps=none}} Many of her books were critically assessed by teachers and librarians, deemed unfit for children to read, and removed from syllabuses and public libraries.{{r|ODNB}}\n\nFrom the 1930s to the 1950s the BBC operated a ''de facto'' ban on dramatising Blyton's books for radio, considering her to be a \"second-rater\" whose work was without literary merit.{{r|AdamsTelegraph}}{{r|SmallBeer}}{{efn|Blyton submitted her first proposal to the BBC in 1936.{{r|SmallBeer}}}} The children's literary critic [[Margery Fisher]] likened Blyton's books to \"slow poison\",{{r|ODNB}} and Jean E. Sutcliffe of the BBC's schools broadcast department wrote of Blyton's ability to churn out \"mediocre material\", noting that \"her capacity to do so amounts to genius&nbsp;... anyone else would have died of boredom long ago\".{{r|SutcliffeMemo}} [[Michael Rosen]], Children's Laureate from 2007 until 2009, wrote that \"I find myself flinching at occasional bursts of snobbery and the assumed level of privilege of the children and families in the books.\"{{r|Times2012}} The children's author [[Anne Fine]] presented an overview of the concerns about Blyton's work and responses to them on [[BBC Radio 4]] in November 2008, in which she noted the \"drip, drip, drip of disapproval\" associated with the books.{{r|Fine}} Blyton's response to her critics was that she was uninterested in the views of anyone over the age of 12, claiming that half the attacks on her work were motivated by jealousy and the rest came from \"stupid people who don't know what they're talking about because they've never read any of my books\".{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 2567\u20132573|ps=none}}\n\nAlthough Blyton's works have been banned from more public libraries than those of any other author, there is no evidence that the popularity of her books ever suffered, and by 1990 she was still described as being very widely read.{{sfnp|Tucker|1990|p=7|ps=none}} Although some criticised her in the 1950s for the volume of work she produced, Blyton astutely capitalised on being considered a more \"savoury\" English alternative to what was seen by contemporaries as an invasion by American culture in the form of Disney and comics.{{sfnp|Rudd|2004|p=112|ps=none}}\n\n===Simplicity===\nSome librarians felt that Blyton's restricted use of language, a conscious product of her teaching background, was prejudicial to an appreciation of more literary qualities. In a scathing article published in ''Encounter'' in 1958, the journalist [[Colin Welch]] remarked that it was \"hard to see how a diet of Miss Blyton could help with the [[Eleven-Plus exam|11-plus]] or even with the Cambridge English [[Tripos]]\",{{r|ODNB}} but reserved his harshest criticism for Blyton's Noddy, describing him as an \"unnaturally priggish&nbsp;... sanctimonious&nbsp;... witless, spiritless, snivelling, sneaking doll.\"{{sfnp|Briggs|Butts|Orville Grenby|2008|p=265|ps=none}}\n\nThe author and educational psychologist [[Nicholas Tucker]] notes that it was common to see Blyton cited as people's favourite or least favourite author according to their age, and argues that her books create an \"encapsulated world for young readers that simply dissolves with age, leaving behind only memories of excitement and strong identification\".{{sfnp|Tucker|1990|p=116|ps=none}} Fred Inglis considers Blyton's books to be technically easy to read, but to also be \"emotionally and cognitively easy\". He mentions that the psychologist Michael Woods believed that Blyton was different from many other older authors writing for children in that she seemed untroubled by presenting them with a world that differed from reality. Woods surmised that Blyton \"was a child, she thought as a child, and wrote as a child&nbsp;... the basic feeling is essentially pre-adolescent&nbsp;... Enid Blyton has no moral dilemmas&nbsp;... Inevitably Enid Blyton was labelled by rumour a child-hater. If true, such a fact should come as no surprise to us, for as a child herself all other children can be nothing but rivals for her.\"{{sfnp|Inglis|1982|p=189|ps=none}} Inglis argues though that Blyton was clearly devoted to children and put an enormous amount of energy into her work, with a powerful belief in \"representing the crude moral diagrams and garish fantasies of a readership\".{{sfnp|Inglis|1982|p=189|ps=none}} Blyton's daughter Imogen has stated that she \"loved a relationship with children through her books\", but real children were an intrusion, and there was no room for intruders in the world that Blyton occupied through her writing.{{r|Blight}}\n\n===Racism, xenophobia and sexism===\nAccusations of racism in Blyton's books were first made by [[Lena Jeger]] in a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article published in 1966, in which she was critical of Blyton's ''The Little Black Doll'', published a few months earlier. Sambo, the black doll of the title, is hated by his owner and the other toys owing to his \"ugly black face\", and runs away. A shower of rain washes his face clean, after which he is welcomed back home with his now pink face.{{sfnp|Druce|1992|p=43|ps=none}} [[Jamaica Kincaid]] also considers the Noddy books to be \"deeply racist\" because of the blonde children and the black [[golliwog]]s.{{sfnp|Bouson|2012|p=207|ps=none}} In Blyton's 1944 novel ''[[The Island of Adventure]]'', a black servant named Jo-Jo is very intelligent, but is particularly cruel to the children.{{sfnp|Edwards|2007|p=257|ps=none}}\n\nAccusations of xenophobia were also made. As George Greenfield observed, \"Enid was very much part of that between-the-wars middle class which believed that foreigners were untrustworthy or funny or sometimes both\".{{sfnp|Greenfield|1995|p=113|ps=none}} The publisher [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] conducted an internal assessment of Blyton's ''The Mystery That Never Was'', submitted to them at the height of her fame in 1960. The review was carried out by the author and books editor [[Phyllis Hartnoll]], in whose view \"There is a faint but unattractive touch of old-fashioned xenophobia in the author's attitude to the thieves; they are 'foreign'&nbsp;... and this seems to be regarded as sufficient to explain their criminality.\" Macmillan rejected the manuscript,{{r|MorningHerald2005}} but it was published by [[William Collins, Sons|William Collins]] in 1961,{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=loc. 5879|ps=none}} and then again in 1965 and 1983.{{r|MorningHerald2005}}\n\nBlyton's depictions of boys and girls are considered by many critics to be sexist.{{r|Dixon}}{{sfnp|Fisher|1986|p=233}} In a ''Guardian'' article published in 2005 Lucy Mangan proposed that The Famous Five series depicts a power struggle between Julian, Dick and George (Georgina), in which the female characters either act like boys or are talked down to, as when Dick lectures George: \"it's really time you gave up thinking you're as good as a boy\".{{r|Mangan}}\n\n===Revisions to later editions===\nTo address criticisms levelled at Blyton's work some later editions have been altered to reflect more liberal attitudes towards issues such as race, gender and the treatment of children; modern reprints of the Noddy series substitute teddy bears or goblins for [[golliwogs]], for instance.{{r|Geoghegan}} The golliwogs who steal Noddy's car and dump him naked in the Dark Wood in ''Here Comes Noddy Again'' are replaced by goblins in the 1986 revision, who strip Noddy only of his shoes and hat and return at the end of the story to apologise.{{sfnp|Druce|1992|p=230|ps=none}}\n\n''[[The Faraway Tree]]'''s Dame Slap, who made regular use of corporal punishment, was changed to Dame Snap who no longer did so, and the names of Dick and Fanny in the same series were changed to Rick and Frannie.{{r|BradburyTelegraph}} Characters in the [[Malory Towers]] and [[St. Clare's (series)|St. Clare's]] series are no longer [[spanking|spanked]] or threatened with a spanking, but are instead scolded. References to George's short hair making her look like a boy were removed in revisions to ''[[Five on a Hike Together]]'', reflecting the idea that girls need not have long hair to be considered feminine or normal.{{r|MorningHerald2012}} Anne of ''The Famous Five'' stating that boys cannot wear pretty dresses or like girl's dolls was removed.{{r|Spectator}} In ''[[The Adventurous Four]]'', the names of the young twin girls were changed from Jill and Mary to Pippa and Zoe.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7591648.stm</ref>\n\nIn 2010 [[Hodder & Stoughton|Hodder]], the publisher of the Famous Five series, announced its intention to update the language used in the books, of which it sold more than half a million copies a year. The changes, which Hodder described as \"subtle\", mainly affect the dialogue rather than the narrative. For instance, \"school tunic\" becomes \"uniform\", \"mother and father\" and \"mother and daddy\" (this one used by young female characters and deemed sexist) becomes \"mum and dad\",{{r|Horn2010}} \"bathing\" is replaced by \"swimming\", and \"jersey\" by \"jumper\".{{r|BradburyTelegraph}} Some commentators see the changes as necessary to encourage modern readers,{{r|Horn2010}} whereas others regard them as unnecessary and patronising.{{r|BradburyTelegraph}} In 2016 Hodder's parent company [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]] announced that they would abandon the revisions as, based on feedback, they had not been a success.{{r|Guardian Sept 2016}}\n\n==Stage, film and television adaptations==\nIn 1954 Blyton adapted Noddy for the stage, producing the ''Noddy in Toyland'' pantomime in just two or three weeks. The production was staged at the 2660-seat [[Stoll Theatre]] in [[Kingsway (London)|Kingsway]], London at Christmas.{{sfnp|Greenfield|1995|p=118|ps=none}} Its popularity resulted in the show running during the Christmas season for five or six years.{{sfnp|Greenfield|1995|p=119|ps=none}} Blyton was delighted with its reception by children in the audience, and attended the theatre three or four times a week.{{sfnp|Greenfield|1995|p=125|ps=none}} [[Noddy (character)#Television productions and incarnations|TV adaptations of Noddy]] since 1954 include one in the 1970s narrated by [[Richard Briers]].{{r|NoddyTV}} In 1955 a stage play based on the Famous Five was produced, and in January 1997 the [[King's Head Theatre]] embarked on a six-month tour of the UK with ''The Famous Five Musical'', to commemorate Blyton's centenary. On 21 November 1998 ''The Secret Seven Save the World'' was first performed at the [[Sherman Cymru|Sherman Theatre]] in Cardiff.{{r|EBSChrono}}\n\nThere have also been several film and television adaptations of the Famous Five: by the [[Children's Film Foundation]] in [[Five on a Treasure Island (film)|1957]] and [[Five Have a Mystery to Solve (film)|1964]], [[Southern Television]] in [[The Famous Five (1970s TV series)|1978\u201379]], and [[Zenith Productions]] in [[The Famous Five (1990s TV series)|1995\u201397]].{{r|ODNB}} The series was also adapted for the German film ''[[Famous Five (film)|F\u00fcnf Freunde]]'', directed by Mike Marzuk and released in 2011.{{r|FestivalFocus}}\n\n[[The Comic Strip]], a group of British comedians, produced two extreme parodies of the Famous Five for [[Channel 4]] television: ''[[Five Go Mad in Dorset]]'', broadcast in 1982,{{efn|The Comic Strip's ''Five Go Mad in Dorset'' contains the first occurrence of a phrase wrongly attributed to Blyton, \"lashings of ginger beer\".{{sfnp|Rudd|2004|p=114|ps=none}}}} and ''Five Go Mad on Mescalin'', broadcast the following year.{{r|EBSChrono}} A third in the series, ''Five Go to Rehab'', was broadcast on [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] in 2012.{{r|TelegraphRehab}}\n\nBlyton's ''The Faraway Tree'' series of books has also been adapted to television and film. On 29 September 1997 the BBC began broadcasting an animated series called ''The Enchanted Lands'', based on the series.{{r|EnchantedLands}} It was announced in October 2014 that a deal had been signed with publishers [[Hachette Book Group USA|Hachette]] for \"The Faraway Tree\" series to be adapted into a live-action film by director [[Sam Mendes]]\u2019 production company. Marlene Johnson, head of children\u2019s books at Hachette, said: \"Enid Blyton was a passionate advocate of children\u2019s storytelling, and The Magic Faraway Tree is a fantastic example of her

By the end of the Aurignacian, gradual changes took place in stone industries. Small stone tools called [[microlith]]s and retouched bladelets can be found for the first time. The microliths of this culture period differ greatly from the Aurignacian artifacts.\n\nBy 18,000&nbsp;BP the climate and environment had changed, starting a period of transition. The Levant became more arid and the forest vegetation retreated, to be replaced by steppe. The cool and dry period ended at the beginning of Mesolithic 1. The hunter-gatherers of the Aurignacian would have had to modify their way of living and their pattern of settlement to adapt to the changing conditions. The crystallization of these new patterns resulted in Mesolithic 1. New types of settlements and new stone industries developed.\n\nThe inhabitants of a small Mesolithic 1 site in the Levant left little more than their chipped stone tools behind. The industry was of small tools made of bladelets struck off single-platform cores. Besides bladelets, [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s and end-[[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]]s were found. A few bone tools and some ground stone have also been found. These so-called Mesolithic sites of Asia are far less numerous than those of the Neolithic and the archeological remains are very poor.\n\nThe type site is  [[Kebara Cave]] south of [[Haifa]]. \nThe Kebaran was characterized by small, [[geometric microliths]], and were thought to lack the specialized grinders and pounders found in later [[Near Eastern]] cultures.\n\nThe Kebaran is preceded by the Athlitian phase of the [[Antelian]] and followed by the proto-agrarian [[Natufian culture]] of the [[Epipalaeolithic]]. The appearance of the [[Kebarian]] culture, of [[microlith]]ic type implies a significant rupture in the cultural continuity of Levantine Upper Paleolithic.  The Kebaran culture, with its use of microliths, is associated with the use of the bow and arrow and the domestication of the dog.<ref>Dayan, Tamar (1994), \"Early Domesticated Dogs of the Near East\" (Journal of Archaeological Science Volume 21, Issue 5, September 1994, Pages 633\u2013640)</ref>  The Kebaran is also characterised by the earliest collecting of wild cereals, known due to the uncovering of grain grinding tools. It was the first step towards the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. The Kebaran people are believed to have practiced dispersal to upland environments in the summer, and aggregation in caves and rockshelters near lowland lakes in the winter. This diversity of environments may be the reason for the variety of tools found in their toolkits.\n\nThe Kebaran is generally thought to have been ancestral to the later [[Natufian]] culture that occupied much of the same range.<ref>[[James Mellaart|Mellaart, James]] (1976), ''Neolithic of the Near East'' ([[Macmillan Publishers]])</ref>\n\n===Late Epipaleolithic===\n{{main|Natufian culture}}\n{{see|Khiamian}}{{Infobox archaeological culture\n|name        = Natufian culture\n|map         = NatufianSpread.svg\n|mapalt      = A map of the Levant with Natufian regions across present-day Israel, Palestine, and a long arm extending into Lebanon and Syria\n|region      = [[Levant]]\n|period      = [[Epipaleolithic]]\n|dates       = c. 14,500\u201311,500 BP\n|typesite    = [[Shuqba cave]] (Wadi an-Natuf)\n|majorsites  = Shuqba cave, [[Ain Mallaha]], [[Ein Gev]], [[Tell Abu Hureyra]]\n|precededby  = [[Kebaran]]\n|followedby  = [[Khiamian]], [[Shepherd Neolithic]]\n}}\nThe Late Epipaleolithic is also called the [[Natufian culture]].

The site is located in the Jubbah basin, a [[Paleolake|palaeolake]] which retained water in the otherwise dry conditions of the Terminal Pleistocene. The stone tools found bore a close resemblance to the [[Geometric Kebaran]], a Levantine industry associated with the Middle Epipalaeolithic. The excavators of the site therefore proposed that northern Arabia was colonised by foragers from the Levant around 15,000 years ago.

The most prevalent animal food sources in the Levant during this period were: deer, gazelle, and [[ibex]] of various species,  and smaller animals including birds, lizard, fox, tortoise, and hare.  Less common were [[aurochs]], wild [[equid]]s, wild boar, wild cattle, and [[hartebeest]].<ref name=\"Simmons, 48\">Simmons, 48</ref>  At [[Neve David]] near [[Haifa]], 15 mammal species were found, and two reptile species. Despite then being very close to the coast, the rather small number of seashells found (7 genera) and the piercing of many, suggests these may have been collected as ornaments rather than food.<ref>Bar-Oz, 71-73</ref>\n\nHowever the period seems to be marked by an increase in plant foods and a decrease in meat eating. Over 40 plant species have been found by analysing one site in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], and some grains were processed and baked. Stones with evidence of grinding have been found.<ref name=\"Simmons, 48\"/>  These were most likely the main food sources throughout the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A, which introduced the widespread agricultural growing of crops. <!--Of these animals, it is likely that only the equids were migrational. <sup>2</sup> ??seems to be Byrnes/Burns again-->\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of archaeological periods (Levant)]]\n*[[Levantine archaeology]]\n*[[Caucasian Epipalaeolithic]]\n*[[Mesolithic Europe]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* Bar-Oz, Guy; Dayan, Tamar; Kaufman, Daniel, [http://www.tau.ac.il/lifesci/zoology/members/dayan_files/articles/Neve-David.pdf The Epipalaeolithic Faunal Sequence in Israel: A View from Neve David (PDF)], Journal of Archaeological Science, 1999, 26, 67\u201382\n* Simmons, Alan H., ''The Neolithic Revolution in the Near East: Transforming the Human Landscape'', 2007, University of Arizona Press, {{ISBN|978-0816529667}}, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BLZbLtmEJ68C&pg=PA47 google books]\n*M.

The executive executes and enforces [[law]].\n\nIn [[political system]]s based on the principle of [[separation of powers]], [[authority]] is distributed among several branches (executive, [[Legislature|legislative]], [[Judiciary|judicial]])\u2014an attempt to prevent the concentration of power in the hands of a small group of people. In such a system, the executive does not pass laws (the role of the legislature) or interpret them (the role of the judiciary). Instead, the executive enforces the law as written by the legislature and interpreted by the judiciary. The executive can be the source of certain types of law, such as a [[decree]] or [[executive order]].  Executive bureaucracies are commonly the source of [[regulation]]s.\n\nIn the [[Westminster system|Westminster political system]], the principle of separation of powers is not as entrenched. Members of the executive, called [[Minister (government)|ministers]], are also members of the legislature, and hence play an important part in both the writing and enforcing of law.\n\nIn this context, the executive consists of a leader(s) of an office or multiple offices.  Specifically, the top leadership roles of the executive branch may include:\n\n*[[head of state]] \u2013 often the [[supreme leader]], the [[president]] or [[monarch]], the chief public representative and living symbol of national unity. \n**[[head of government]] \u2013 often the ''[[de facto]]'' leader, [[prime minister]], overseeing the administration of all affairs of state.\n***[[defence

overseeing the treasury, determining [[fiscal policy]] and managing [[national budget]].\n***[[justice minister]] \u2013 overseeing criminal prosecutions, corrections, enforcement of court orders.\n

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{IPA-it|en\u02c8ri\u02d0ko \u02c8fermi|lang}}; 29 September 1901&nbsp;\u2013 28 November 1954) was an Italian and naturalized-American physicist and the creator of the world's first [[nuclear reactor]], the [[Chicago Pile-1]]. He has been called the \"architect of the [[nuclear age]]\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/enrico-fermi-architect-of-the-nuclear-age-dies|title=Enrico Fermi, architect of the nuclear age, dies|date=Autumn 1954}}</ref> and the \"architect of the atomic bomb\".<ref name=\"obit\" /> He was one of the very few physicists in history to excel both [[theoretical physics|theoretically]] and [[experimental physics|experimentally]]. Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power, and was awarded the 1938 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on [[induced radioactivity]] by neutron bombardment and the discovery of [[Transuranium element|transuranic elements]].  He made significant contributions to the development of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]], and [[statistical mechanics]].\n\nFermi's first major contribution was to statistical mechanics. After [[Wolfgang Pauli]] announced his [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] in 1925, Fermi followed with a paper in which he applied the principle to an [[ideal gas]], employing a statistical formulation now known as [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]]. Today, particles that obey the exclusion principle are called \"[[fermion]]s\". Later Pauli postulated the existence of an uncharged invisible particle emitted along with an electron during [[beta decay]], to satisfy the law of [[conservation of energy]]. Fermi took up this idea, developing a model that incorporated the postulated particle, which he named the \"[[neutrino]]\". His theory, later referred to as [[Fermi's interaction]] and still later as [[weak interaction]], described one of the [[fundamental interaction|four fundamental forces of nature]]. Through experiments inducing radioactivity with recently discovered [[neutron]]s, Fermi discovered that [[slow neutron]]s were more easily [[neutron capture|captured]] than fast ones, and developed the [[Fermi age equation]] to describe this. After bombarding [[thorium]] and [[uranium]] with slow neutrons, he concluded that he had created new elements; although he was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery, the new elements were subsequently revealed to be [[Nuclear fission product|fission products]].\n\nFermi left Italy in 1938 to escape new [[Italian Racial Laws]] that affected his Jewish wife [[Laura Capon]]. He emigrated to the United States where he worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] during World War II. Fermi led the team that designed and built Chicago Pile-1, which went [[Nuclear reactor physics#Criticality|critical]] on 2 December 1942, demonstrating the first artificial self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]]. He was on hand when the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], went critical in 1943, and when the [[B Reactor]] at the [[Hanford Site]] did so the next year. At [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] he headed F Division, part of which worked on [[Edward Teller]]'s [[Thermonuclear fusion|thermonuclear]] \"[[History of the Teller\u2013Ulam design|Super]]\" bomb. He was present at the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] on 16 July 1945, where he used his [[Fermi problem|Fermi method]] to estimate the bomb's yield.\n\nAfter the war, Fermi served under [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] on the General Advisory Committee, which advised the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] on nuclear matters and policy. Following the detonation of the first Soviet [[fission bomb]] in August 1949, he strongly opposed the development of a hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. He was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the 1954 [[Oppenheimer security hearing|hearing]] that resulted in the denial of the latter's security clearance. Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to [[pion]]s and [[muon]]s, and he speculated that [[cosmic ray]]s arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space. Many awards, concepts, and institutions are [[list of things named after Enrico Fermi|named after Fermi]], including the [[Enrico Fermi Award]], the [[Enrico Fermi Institute]], the [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]], the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]], the [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station]], and the synthetic element [[fermium]], making him one of 16 scientists who have [[List of scientists whose names are used in chemical element names|elements named after them]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:BirthHouseOfEnricoFermi01.jpg|thumb|right|Via Gaeta 19, Rome, where Fermi was born]]\nEnrico Fermi was born in Rome, Italy, on 29 September 1901. He was the third child of Alberto Fermi, a division head (''{{lang|it|Capo Divisione}}'') in the Ministry of Railways, and Ida de Gattis, an elementary school teacher.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|pp=3\u20134, 8}}{{sfn|Amaldi|2001|p=23}} His sister, Maria, was two years older than him, and his brother Giulio was a year older. After the two boys were sent to a rural community to be [[wet nurse]]d, Enrico rejoined his family in Rome when he was two and a half.{{sfn|Cooper|1999|p=19}}  Although he was baptised a [[Roman Catholic]] in accordance with his grandparents' wishes, his family was not particularly religious; Enrico was an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] throughout his adult life. As a young boy he shared the same interests as his brother Giulio, building [[electric motor]]s and playing with electrical and mechanical toys.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|pp=5\u20136}} Giulio died during the administration of an anesthetic for an operation on a throat [[abscess]] in 1915.{{sfn|Fermi|1954|pp=15\u201316}} Maria died in an airplane crash near [[Milan|Milano]] in 1959.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olgiateolona26giugno1959.org/10_lives/Sac.html |title=Maria Fermi Sacchetti (1899-1959) |website=www.OlgiateOlona26giugno1959.org |access-date=6 May 2017 |language=Italian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830153427/http://www.olgiateolona26giugno1959.org/10_lives/Sac.html |archivedate=30 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOne of Fermi's first sources for his study of physics was a book he found at the local market at ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' in Rome. Published in 1840, the 900-page ''Elementorum physicae mathematicae'', was written in Latin by [[Jesuit]] Father [[Andrea Caraffa]], a professor at the [[Collegio Romano]]. It covered [[mathematics]], [[classical mechanics]], [[astronomy]], [[optics]], and [[acoustics]], insofar as these disciplines were understood when the book was written.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|p=7}}{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=315}} Fermi befriended another scientifically inclined student, [[Enrico Persico]],{{sfn|Amaldi|2001|p=24}} and together the two worked on scientific projects such as building [[gyroscope]]s and trying to accurately measure the acceleration of Earth's [[gravity]].{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|pp=11-12}} Fermi's interest in physics was further encouraged by his father's colleague Adolfo Amidei, who gave him several books on physics and mathematics, which he read and assimilated quickly.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|pp=8\u201310}}\n\n== ''Scuola Normale Superiore'' in Pisa ==\n[[File:Enrico Fermi giovane.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Enrico Fermi as a student in Pisa]]\nFermi graduated from high school in July 1918 and, at Amidei's urging, applied to the ''[[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa|Scuola Normale Superiore]]'' in [[Pisa]]. Having lost one son, his parents were reluctant to let him move away from home for four years while attending it, but in the end they acquiesced. The school provided free lodging for students, but candidates had to take a difficult entrance exam that included an essay. The given theme was \"Specific characteristics of Sounds\". The 17-year-old Fermi chose to derive and solve the [[partial differential equation]] for a vibrating rod, applying [[Fourier analysis]] in the solution. The examiner, Professor Giulio Pittarelli from the Sapienza University of Rome, interviewed Fermi and praised him, saying that he would become an outstanding physicist in the future. Fermi achieved first place in the classification of the entrance exam.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|pp=11\u201313}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mathematica.sns.it/autori/1173/ |title=Edizione Nazionale Mathematica Italiana - Giulio Pittarelli |publisher=Scuola Normale Superiore |language=Italian |access-date=6 May 2017 }}</ref>\n\nDuring his years at the ''Scuola Normale Superiore'', Fermi teamed up with a fellow student named [[Franco Rasetti]] with whom he would indulge in light-hearted pranks and who would later become Fermi's close friend and collaborator. In Pisa, Fermi was advised by the director of the physics laboratory, [[Luigi Puccianti]], who acknowledged that there was little that he could teach Fermi, and frequently asked Fermi to teach him something instead. Fermi's knowledge of quantum physics reached such a high level that Puccianti asked him to organize seminars on the topic.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|pp=15\u201318}} During this time Fermi learned [[tensor calculus]], a mathematical technique invented by [[Gregorio Ricci]] and [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] that was needed to demonstrate the principles of [[general relativity]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=320}} Fermi initially chose mathematics as his major, but soon switched to physics. He remained largely self-taught, studying general relativity, [[quantum mechanics]], and [[atomic physics]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=317\u2013319}}\n\nIn September 1920, Fermi was admitted to the Physics department. Since there were only three students in the department\u2014Fermi, Rasetti, and [[Nello Carrara]]\u2014Puccianti let them freely use the laboratory for whatever purposes they chose. Fermi decided that they should research [[X-ray crystallography]], and the three worked to produce a Laue photograph\u2014an X-ray photograph of a crystal.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|p=20}} During 1921, his third year at the university, Fermi published his first scientific works in the Italian journal ''[[Nuovo Cimento]]''. The first was entitled \"On the dynamics of a rigid system of electrical charges in translational motion\" (''{{Lang|it|Sulla dinamica di un sistema rigido di cariche elettriche in moto traslatorio}}''). A sign of things to come was that the [[mass]] was expressed as a [[tensor]]\u2014a mathematical construct commonly used to describe something moving and changing in three-dimensional space. In classical mechanics, mass is a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity, but in relativity it changes with velocity. The second paper was \"On the electrostatics of a uniform gravitational field of electromagnetic charges and on the weight of electromagnetic charges\" (''{{lang|it|Sull'elettrostatica di un campo gravitazionale uniforme e sul peso delle masse elettromagnetiche}}''). Using general relativity, Fermi showed that a charge has a weight equal to U/c<sup>2</sup>, where U was the electrostatic energy of the system, and c is the [[speed of light]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=317\u2013319}}\n\nThe first paper seemed to point out a contradiction between the electrodynamic theory and the relativistic one concerning the calculation of the electromagnetic masses, as the former predicted a value of 4/3 U/c<sup>2</sup>. Fermi addressed this the next year in a paper \"Concerning a contradiction between [[electrodynamic]] and the relativistic theory of electromagnetic mass\" in which he showed that the apparent contradiction was a consequence of relativity. This paper was sufficiently well-regarded that it was translated into German and published in the German scientific journal ''[[Physikalische Zeitschrift]]'' in 1922.<ref>{{cite journal |title=\u00dcber einen Widerspruch zwischen der elektrodynamischen und relativistischen Theorie der elektromagnetischen Masse |language=German |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=23 |pages=340\u2013344 |url=https://en.wikisource.org/?curid=1059488 |accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref> That year, Fermi submitted his article \"On the phenomena occurring near a [[world line]]\" (''{{lang|it|Sopra i fenomeni che avvengono in vicinanza di una linea oraria}}'') to the Italian journal ''[[I Rendiconti dell'Accademia dei Lincei]]''. In this article he examined the [[Principle of Equivalence]], and introduced the so-called \"[[Fermi coordinates]]\". He proved that on a world line close to the time line, space behaves as if it were a [[Euclidean space]].{{sfn|Bertotti|2001|p=115}}{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=321}}\n\n[[File:World line2.svg|left|thumb|A [[light cone]] is a three-dimensional surface of all possible light rays arriving at and departing from a point in [[spacetime]]. Here, it is depicted with one spatial dimension suppressed. The time line is the vertical axis.]]\nFermi submitted his thesis, \"A theorem on probability and some of its applications\" (''{{lang|it|Un teorema di calcolo delle probabilit\u00e0 ed alcune sue applicazioni}}''), to the ''Scuola Normale Superiore'' in July 1922, and received his [[Laurea#Former status of the Laurea degree|laurea]] at the unusually young age of 20. The thesis was on [[X-ray diffraction]] images. [[Theoretical physics]] was not yet considered a discipline in Italy, and the only thesis that would have been accepted was one on [[experimental physics]]. For this reason, Italian physicists were slow in embracing the new ideas like relativity coming from Germany. Since Fermi was quite at home in the lab doing experimental work, this did not pose insurmountable problems for him.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=321}}\n\nWhile writing the appendix for the Italian edition of the book ''Fundamentals of Einstein Relativity'' by [[August Kopff]] in 1923, Fermi was the first to point out that hidden inside the famous [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|Einstein equation]] ({{nowrap|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}) was an enormous amount of [[nuclear potential energy]] to be exploited. \"It does not seem possible, at least in the near future\", he wrote, \"to find a way to release these dreadful amounts of energy\u2014which is all to the good because the first effect of an explosion of such a dreadful amount of energy would be to smash into smithereens the physicist who had the misfortune to find a way to do it.\"{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=321}}\n\nIn 1924 Fermi was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] in the [[Masonic Lodge]] \"Adriano Lemmi\" of the [[Grand Orient of Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goilombardia.it/massoni-illustri/enrico-fermi|title=Enrico Fermi L\u2019Uomo, lo Scienziato e il Massone|language=Italian |accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nFermi decided to travel abroad, and spent a semester studying under [[Max Born]] at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], where he met [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Pascual Jordan]]. Fermi then studied in [[Leiden]] with [[Paul Ehrenfest]] from September to December 1924 on a fellowship from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] obtained through the intercession of the mathematician [[Vito Volterra]]. Here Fermi met [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Albert Einstein]], and became good friends with [[Samuel Goudsmit]] and [[Jan Tinbergen]].  From January 1925 to late 1926, Fermi taught [[mathematical physics]] and [[theoretical mechanics]] at the [[University of Florence]], where he teamed up with Rasetti to conduct a series of experiments on the effects of magnetic fields on mercury vapour. He also participated in seminars at the Sapienza University of Rome, giving lectures on quantum mechanics and [[solid state physics]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=321\u2013324}} While giving lectures on the new quantum mechanics based on the remarkable accuracy of predictions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, the Italian physicist would often say, \"It has no business to fit so well!\"{{sfn|Hey|Walters|2003|p=61}}\n\nAfter [[Wolfgang Pauli]] announced his [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] in 1925, Fermi responded with a paper \"On the quantisation of the perfect monoatomic gas\" (''{{lang|it|Sulla quantizzazione del gas perfetto monoatomico}}''), in which he applied the exclusion principle to an ideal gas. The paper was especially notable for Fermi's statistical formulation, which  describes the distribution of particles in [[physical system|systems]] of many [[identical particles]] that obey the exclusion principle. This was independently developed soon after by the British physicist [[Paul Dirac]], who also showed how it was related to the [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]]. Accordingly, it is now known as [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]].{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=329\u2013330}} Following Dirac, particles that obey the exclusion principle are today called \"[[fermion]]s\", while those that do not are called \"[[boson]]s\".{{sfn|Cooper|1999|p=31}}\n\n== Professor in Rome ==\n[[File:Ragazzi di via Panisperna.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|Fermi and his students (the [[Via Panisperna boys]]) in the courtyard of Rome University's Physics Institute in Via Panisperna, about 1934.

Fermi applied for a chair of mathematical physics at the [[University of Cagliari]] on [[Sardinia]], but was narrowly passed over in favour of [[Giovanni Giorgi]].{{sfn|Fermi|1954|pp=37\u201338}} In 1926, at the age of 24, he applied for a professorship at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]]. This was a new chair, one of the first three in theoretical physics in Italy, that had been created by the Minister of Education at the urging of Professor [[Orso Mario Corbino]], who was the University's professor of experimental physics, the Director of the Institute of Physics, and a member of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s cabinet. Corbino, who also chaired the selection committee, hoped that the new chair would raise the standard and reputation of physics in Italy.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|p=45}} The committee chose Fermi ahead of Enrico Persico and [[Aldo Pontremoli]],{{sfn|Fermi|1954|p=38}} and Corbino helped Fermi recruit his team, which was soon joined by notable students such as [[Edoardo Amaldi]], [[Bruno Pontecorvo]], [[Ettore Majorana]] and [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]], and by Franco Rasetti, whom Fermi had appointed as his assistant.{{sfn|Alison|1957|p=127}} They were soon nicknamed the \"[[Via Panisperna boys]]\" after the street where the Institute of Physics was located.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phys.uniroma1.it/DipWeb/museo/fermi.html |title=Enrico Fermi e i ragazzi di via Panisperna |language=Italian |publisher=University of Rome |accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nFermi married [[Laura Capon]], a science student at the University, on 19 July 1928.{{sfn|Segr\u00e8|1970|p=61}} They had two children: Nella, born in January 1931, and Giulio, born in February 1936.{{sfn|Cooper|1999|pp=38\u201339}} On 18 March 1929, Fermi was appointed a member of the [[Royal Academy of Italy]] by  Mussolini, and on 27 April he joined the [[Fascist Party]]. He later opposed Fascism when the 1938 [[Italian Racial Laws|racial laws]] were promulgated by Mussolini in order to bring Italian Fascism ideologically closer to German [[National Socialism]]. These laws threatened Laura, who was Jewish, and put many of Fermi's research assistants out of work.{{sfn|Alison|1957|p=130}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fermi.lib.uchicago.edu/fermibiog.htm |publisher=[[University of Chicago]] |title=About Enrico Fermi |accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2001/ottobre/02/Cosi_Fermi_scopri_natura_vessatoria_co_0_0110022882.shtml |authorlink=Paolo Mieli |first=Paolo |last=Mieli |title=''Cos\u00ec Fermi scopr\u00ec la natura vessatoria del fascismo'' |language=Italian |newspaper=[[Corriere della Sera]] |date=2 October 2001 |accessdate=20 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019204537/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2001/ottobre/02/Cosi_Fermi_scopri_natura_vessatoria_co_0_0110022882.shtml |archivedate=19 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archivi.beniculturali.it/DGA-free/Strumenti/Strumenti_CLXVII.pdf |author=Direzione generale per gli archivi |title=''Reale accademia d'Italia:inventario dell'archivio'' |language=Italian |year=2005 |publisher=Ministero per i beni culturali e ambientali |location=Rome |page=xxxix |accessdate=20 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907065146/http://www.archivi.beniculturali.it/DGA-free/Strumenti/Strumenti_CLXVII.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A Legal Examination of Mussolini\u2019s Race Laws|url=http://primolevicenter.org/printed-matter/a-legal-examination-of-mussolinis-race-laws/|website=Printed Matter|publisher=Centro Primo Levi|accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring their time in Rome, Fermi and his group made important contributions to many practical and theoretical aspects of physics. In 1928, he published his ''Introduction to Atomic Physics'' (''{{Lang|it|Introduzione alla fisica atomica}}''), which provided Italian university students with an up-to-date and accessible text. Fermi also conducted public lectures and wrote popular articles for scientists and teachers in order to spread knowledge of the new physics as widely as possible.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=333\u2013335}} Part of his teaching method was to gather his colleagues and graduate students together at the end of the day and go over a problem, often from his own research.{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=333\u2013335}}{{sfn|Amaldi|2001|p=38}} A sign of success was that foreign students now began to come to Italy. The most notable of these was the German physicist [[Hans Bethe]],{{sfn|Fermi|1954|p=217}} who came to Rome as a Rockefeller Foundation fellow, and collaborated with Fermi on a 1932 paper \"On the Interaction between Two Electrons\" ({{Lang-de|\u00dcber die Wechselwirkung von Zwei Elektronen}}).{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|pp=333\u2013335}}\n\nAt this time, physicists were puzzled by [[beta decay]], in which an [[electron]] was emitted from the [[atomic nucleus]]. To satisfy the law of [[conservation of energy]], Pauli postulated the existence of an invisible particle with no charge and little or no mass that was also emitted at the same time. Fermi took up this idea, which he developed in a tentative paper in 1933, and then a longer paper the next year that incorporated the postulated particle, which Fermi called a \"[[neutrino]]\".{{sfn|Amaldi|2001|pp=50\u201351}}{{sfn|Bonolis|2001|p=346}}<ref name=\"Beta decay\">{{cite journal | last = Fermi | first = E.| title = Fermi's Theory of Beta Decay (English translation by Fred L.

Wilson noted that:{{quote|Fermi's theory, aside from bolstering Pauli's proposal of the neutrino, has a special significance in the history of modern physics. One must remember that only the naturally occurring \u03b2 emitters were known at the time the theory was proposed. Later when positron decay was discovered, the process was easily incorporated within Fermi's original framework. On the basis of his theory, the capture of an orbital electron by a nucleus was predicted and eventually observed. With time much experimental data has accumulated. Although peculiarities have been observed many times in \u03b2 decay, Fermi's theory always has been equal to the challenge.<br />The consequences of the Fermi theory are vast. For example, \u03b2 spectroscopy was established as a powerful tool for the study of nuclear structure. But perhaps the most influential aspect of this work of Fermi is that his particular form of the \u03b2 interaction established a pattern which has been appropriate for the study of other types of interactions.

The cooling water was investigated to see if there was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor suddenly started up again, only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to [[neutron poison]]ing from [[xenon-135]], a fission product with a half-life of 9.2 hours. DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners.

In answer to such question[s] I may venture a fairly safe prediction.\n\nHistory of science and technology has consistently taught us that scientific advances in basic understanding have sooner or later led to technical and industrial applications that have revolutionized our way of life. It seems to me improbable that this effort to get at the structure of matter should be an exception to this rule.

He was extraordinarily vigorous and loved games and sport. On such occasions his ambitious nature became apparent. He played tennis with considerable ferocity and when climbing mountains acted rather as a guide. One might have called him a benevolent dictator. I remember once at the top of a mountain Fermi got up and said: \"Well, it is two minutes to two, let's all leave at two o'clock\"; and of course, everybody got up faithfully and obediently. This leadership and self-assurance gave Fermi the name of \"The Pope\" whose pronouncements were infallible in physics. He once said: \"I can calculate anything in physics within a factor 2 on a few sheets; to get the numerical factor in front of the formula right may well take a physicist a year to calculate, but I am not\ninterested in that.\" His leadership could go so far that it was a danger to the independence of the person working with him. I recollect once, at a party at his house when my wife cut the bread, Fermi came along and said he had a different philosophy on bread-cutting and took the knife out of my wife's hand and proceeded with the job because he was convinced that his own method was superior. But all this did not offend at all, but rather charmed everybody into liking Fermi. He had very few interests outside physics and when he once heard me play on Teller's piano he confessed that his interest in music was restricted to simple tunes.\n|source=Egon Bretscher<ref name=\"frs\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Bretscher | first1 = E. | last2 = Cockcroft | first2 = J.

The historian of physics, [[C. P.

He disliked complicated theories, and while he had great mathematical ability, he would never use it when the job could be done much more simply. He was famous for getting quick and accurate answers to problems that would stump other people. Later on, his method of getting approximate and quick answers through back-of-the-envelope calculations became informally known as the \"[[Fermi problem|Fermi method]]\", and is widely taught.{{sfn|Von Baeyer|1993|pp=3\u20138}}\n\nFermi was fond of pointing out that [[Alessandro Volta]], working in his laboratory, could have had no idea where the study of electricity would lead.{{sfn|Fermi|1954|p=242}} Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics.

between users of the [[Emacs]] and [[vi]] (usually [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]]) [[text editor]]s. The rivalry has become a lasting part of [[hacker culture]] and the [[free software movement|free software community]].\n\nThe Emacs vs vi debate was one of the original \"holy wars\" conducted on [[Usenet]] groups,<ref>[https://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~joern/jargon/holywars.HTML Holy War (Hacker Jargon)]</ref> with many [[Flaming (Internet)|flame wars]] fought between those insisting that their editor of choice is the [[Wiktionary:paragon|paragon]] of editing [[perfection]], and insulting the other, since at least 1985.<ref name=emacsvsvi>[https://www.linux.com/news/emacs-vs-vi-endless-geek-holy-war EMACS vs. vi: The endless geek 'holy war']</ref> Related battles have been fought over [[operating system advocacy|operating systems]], [[programming language]]s, [[version control]] systems, and even source code [[indent style]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/just-let-me-code/240168735|title=Just Let Me Code}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/25/why-coding-style-matters/|title=Why Coding Style Matters}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison==\nThe most important differences between vi and Emacs are presented in the following table:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !! vi !! Emacs \n|-\n! Keystroke execution\n| vi retains each [[permutation]] of typed keys. This creates a path in the [[decision tree]] which unambiguously identifies any command. <!--There has to be mentioned that certain keys represent text-objects, others repetition, and others movement ... Permutation of such keys can be very effective, while keeping the user thinking about what is he doing.-->\n| Emacs commands are [[key combination]]s for which [[modifier key]]s are held down while other keys are pressed; a command gets executed once completely typed. This still forms a decision tree of commands, but not one of individual keystrokes. A vim-inspired Emacs package (<tt>undo-tree</tt>) provides a [[user interface]] to the tree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/undo-tree-readme.txt|title=undo-tree-readme.txt|quote=The only downside to this more advanced yet simpler undo system is that it was inspired by Vim. But, after all, most successful religions steal the best ideas from their competitors!}}</ref>\n|-\n! Memory usage and customizability\n| vi is a smaller and faster program, but with less capacity for customization.  The [[vim (text editor)|vim]] version of vi has evolved to provide significantly more functionality and customization than vi, making it comparable to Emacs{{refn|group=notes|As of 2013, vim has 1731 [[Source lines of code|kLOC]] of code (1142 in C + 506 stock distro vimScript + 83 makefile-related), whereas GNU Emacs has 1623 (just 299 in C + 1270 stock distro Emacs Lisp + 54 makefile-related).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohloh.net/p/emacs/analyses/latest/languages_summary|title=The GNU Emacs Open Source Project on Open Hub : Languages Page|publisher=Ohloh.net|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohloh.net/p/vim/analyses/latest/languages_summary|title=The Vim Open Source Project on Open Hub : Languages Page|publisher=Ohloh.net|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref>  There are many optional Emacs Lisp (and Vimscript) packages available; the numbers here refer to only code which is actually included in the main download of the respective editor.}}. vi start-up time is near instantaneous for small text files, while vim is almost as fast.\n| Emacs executes many actions on startup, many of which may execute arbitrary user code.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Startup-Summary.html|title=Startup Summary}}</ref> This makes Emacs take longer to start up (even compared to vim) and require more [[Random access memory|memory]]. However, it is highly customizable and includes a large number of features, as it is essentially an execution environment for a [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] program designed for text-editing. Emacs 18 (released in 1987) introduced a server mode<ref>{{cite web|url=https://searchcode.com/codesearch/view/364358/|title=NEWS.18|quote=Programs such as mailers that invoke \"the editor\" as an inferior to edit some text can now be told to use an existing Emacs process instead of creating a new editor.}}</ref> designed to run continuously in the background. Various instances of Emacs can then be started in client mode, attaching to this server and sharing state. Emacs client startup time is practically instantaneous as all it does is provoke the existing Emacs process to redraw the display.\n|-\n! User environment\n| vi was originally exclusively used inside of a text-mode console, offering no [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). Most modern vi derivatives, e.g. MacVim and gVim, include GUIs. However, support for [[Proportional font#Proportional font|proportionally spaced fonts]] remains absent. Also lacking is support for different sized fonts in the same document.<ref>{{cite web|quote=All fonts used, except for Menu and Tooltip, should be of the same character size as the default font!  Otherwise redrawing problems will occur.|url=ftp://ftp.tuwien.ac.at/.vhost/www.vim.org/vim/doc/syntax.txt|title=syntax.txt}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n| Emacs, while also initially designed for use on a console, grew a [[Text User Interface|TUI]] fairly early on due to its [[Lisp machine]] heritage. [[X11]] GUI support was added in Emacs 18, and made the default in version 19. Current Emacs GUIs include full support for [[Proportional font#Proportional font|proportionate spacing]] and font-size variation. Emacs also supports embedded images and [[hypertext]].\n|-\n! Function/navigation interface\n| vi uses distinct editing [[Mode (computer interface)|mode]]s. Under \"insert mode\", keys insert characters into the document. Under \"normal mode\" (also known as \"command mode\"), bare keypresses execute vi commands.\n| Emacs uses [[metakey]] chords.{{refn|group=notes|Emacs also has something called \"modes\"; however, in Emacs these generally refer to long-term interaction states that apply for entire time one works with a given file or dataset, and do not imply a modal interface ''per se''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryModes|title=EmacsWiki: Category Modes|publisher=Emacswiki.org|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref>}} Keys or key chords can be defined as [[prefix key]]s, which put Emacs into a mode where it waits for additional [[key press]]es that constitute a [[key binding]]. Key bindings can be mode-specific, further customizing the interaction style. Emacs provides a [[command line]] accessed by M-x that can be configured to [[autocomplete]] in various ways. Emacs also provides a <tt>defalias</tt> macro, allowing alternate names for commands.\n|-\n! Keyboard\n|vi uses no <Alt> key and seldom uses the <Ctrl> key. vi's keyset is mainly restricted to the [[alphanumeric]] keys, and the [[esc key|escape]] key. This is an enduring relic of its [[teletype]] heritage, but has the effect of making most of vi's functionality accessible without frequent awkward finger reaches.\n|The expansion of one of Emacs' [[backronyms]] is ''Escape, Meta, Alt, Control, Shift'', which neatly summarizes most of the modifier keys it uses, only leaving out [[Super key (keyboard button)|Super]]. Emacs was developed on [[Lisp Machine]]s with [[Space-cadet keyboard]]s that were more ergonomic with respect to modifiers than modern layouts. There are multiple emacs packages, such as spacemacs<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs|title=spacemacs}}</ref> or ergoemacs<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ergoemacs.org/|title=Ergoemacs}}</ref> that replace these key combinations with ones easier to type, or customization can be done ''[[ad hoc]]'' by the user.\n|-\n! Language and script support\n|vi has rudimentary support for languages other than English. Modern Vim supports Unicode if run in a shell that supports Unicode.\n|Emacs has full support for all Unicode-compatible writing systems and allows multiple scripts to be freely intermixed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/International-Chars.html#International-Chars|title=International Chars|quote=Internally, Emacs uses its own multibyte character encoding, which is a superset of the Unicode standard. This internal encoding allows characters from almost every known script to be intermixed in a single buffer or string. Emacs translates between the multibyte character encoding and various other coding systems when reading and writing files, and when exchanging data with subprocesses.}}</ref>\n|}\n\n=== Benefits of Emacs ===\n* Emacs has a non-modal interface\n* One of the most [[porting|ported]] computer programs.

Unix systems, both free and proprietary, frequently provide Emacs bundled with the [[operating system]].\n* Emacs server architecture allows multiple clients to attach to the same Emacs instance and share the buffer list, [[kill ring]], [[undo]] history and other state.\n* Pervasive [[online help]] system with keybindings, functions and commands documented on the fly.\n* Extensible and customizable [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp programming language]] variant ([[Emacs Lisp]]), with features that include:\n** Ability to [[emulator|emulate]] vi and vim (using Evil,<ref name=\"C4WDefault-8519296\">{{cite web |url=https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home |title=Evil - Home - Open wiki |date=May 29, 2014 |accessdate=September 16, 2014 |work=gitorious.org |author1= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916073328/https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home |archivedate=September 16, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Viper or Vimpulse).\n** A powerful and extensible file manager ([[dired]]), integrated debugger, and a large set of development and other tools.\n** Having every command be an Emacs Lisp function enables commands to [[DWIM]] (Do What I Mean) by programmatically responding to past actions and document state. For example, a <code>switch-or-split-window</code> command could switch to another window if one exists, or create one if needed. This cuts down on the number of keystrokes and commands a user must remember.\n** \"An OS inside an OS\". Emacs Lisp enables Emacs to be programmed far beyond editing features. Even a base install contains several dozen applications, including two [[web browser]]s, news readers, several mail agents, four [[IRC]] clients, a version of [[ELIZA]], and a variety of games. All of these applications are available anywhere Emacs runs, with the same user interface and functionality. Starting with version 24, Emacs includes a [[package manager]], making it easy to install additional applications including alternate web browsers, EMMS ([[Emacs Multimedia System]]), and more. Also available are numerous packages for programming, including some targeted at specific language/library combinations or coding styles.\n\n=== Benefits of vi ===\n* Edit commands are composable<ref>{{cite web|last=Kozlowski|first=Mike|title=Why Atom Can\u2019t Replace Vim|url=https://medium.com/p/433852f4b4d1|accessdate=7 May 2014}}</ref>\n* Vi has a modal interface\n* Vi loads faster than Emacs.\n* Being deeply associated with UNIX tradition, it runs on all systems that can implement the standard [[C (programming language)|C]] library, including [[UNIX]], [[Linux]], [[AmigaOS]], [[DOS]], [[Windows]], [[Macintosh|Mac]], [[BeOS]], [[OpenVMS]], [[IRIX]], [[AIX]], [[HP-UX]], [[BSD]] and [[POSIX]]-compliant systems.\n* Extensible and customizable through [[Vim script]] or APIs for interpreted languages such as Python, Ruby, Perl, and Lua\n* Ubiquitous. Essentially all Unix and Unix-like systems come with vi (or a variant) built-in. Vi (and ex, but not vim) is specified in the [[POSIX]] standard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/vi.html|title=vi|website=pubs.opengroup.org|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref>\n* System rescue environments, embedded systems (notably those with [[BusyBox]]) and other constrained environments often include vi, but not emacs.\n* Generally editing itself requires fewer keystrokes and is faster.\n\n==Evolution==\nIn the past, many small editors modeled after or derived from vi flourished. This was due to the importance of conserving memory with the comparatively minuscule amount available at the time. As computers have become more powerful, many vi clones, [[vim (text editor)|Vim]] in particular, have grown in size and code complexity. These vi variants of today, as with the old lightweight Emacs variants, tend to have many of the perceived benefits and drawbacks of the opposing side.

The term \"Western Orthodox Church\" is disfavored by members of that vicariate.\n\nIn the 5th century, [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] separated from [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedonian]] Christianity (and is therefore separate from both the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Church), well before the 11th century [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]]. It should not be confused with Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\n==Church governance==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2015}}\nThe Orthodox Church is a [[full communion|communion]] comprising the fifteen separate [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] hierarchical churches that recognize each other as \"canonical\" [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christian]] churches. Each constituent church is self-governing; its highest-ranking bishop (a patriarch, a metropolitan or an archbishop) reports to no higher earthly authority. Each regional church is composed of constituent eparchies (or dioceses) ruled by bishops. Some autocephalous churches have given an eparchy or group of eparchies varying degrees of autonomy (self-government). Such autonomous churches maintain varying levels of dependence on their mother church, usually defined in a Tomos or other document of autonomy. In many cases, autonomous churches are almost completely self-governing, with the mother church retaining only the right to appoint the highest-ranking bishop (an archbishop or metropolitan) of the autonomous church.\n\nNormal governance is enacted through a [[synod]] of bishops within each church. In case of issues that go beyond the scope of a single church, multiple self-governing churches send representatives to a wider synod, sometimes wide enough to be called an Orthodox \"[[ecumenical council]]\". Such councils are deemed to have authority superior to that of any autocephalous church or its ranking bishop.\n\nThe Orthodox Church is decentralised, having no central authority, earthly head or a single [[Bishop]] in a leadership role. Thus, the Orthodox Church uses a [[synod]]ical system [[canon law|canonically]], which is significantly different from the hierarchically organised Catholic Church that follows the doctrine of [[papal supremacy]]. References to the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] as a leader are an erroneous interpretation of his title (\"[[first among equals]]\").<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Katherine |title=Orthodox Church - Simple Guides |date=2009 |publisher=Bravo Ltd |location=London |isbn=978-1-85733-640-5 |edition=v3.1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zbc-AQAAQBAJ&pg=PT23&dq=eastern+orthodox+central+authority&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CFIQ6AEwCWoVChMI8_bmgpWGxwIVFy6ICh0iWQRJ#v=onepage&q=authority&f=false |accessdate=1 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Autocephaly ( 6 of 20) |url=http://oca.org/questions/autocephaly/autocephaly-06 |accessdate=2 August 2015 }}</ref> His title is of honor rather than authority and in fact the Ecumenical Patriarch has no real authority over Churches other than the Constantinopolitan.<ref name=brit>{{cite web|title=Eastern Orthodoxy|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Eastern-Orthodoxy#toc59581|website=www.britannica,com|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref> His unique role often sees the Ecumenical Patriarch referred to as the \"spiritual leader\" of the Orthodox Church in some sources, though this is not an official title of the patriarch nor is it usually used in scholarly sources on the patriarchate.\n\nThe autocephalous churches are in [[full communion]] with each other, so any priest of any of those churches may lawfully minister to any member of any of them, and no member of any is excluded from any form of worship in any of the others, including reception of the [[Eucharist]].\n\nIn the early Middle Ages, the [[One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church]] was ruled by five patriarchs: the bishops of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem; these were collectively referred to as the [[Pentarchy]]. Each patriarch had jurisdiction over bishops in a specified geographic region. This continued until 927, when the autonomous [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian Archbishopric]] became the first newly promoted patriarchate to join the original five.\n\nThe patriarch of Rome was \"first in place of honor\" among the five patriarchs.  Disagreement about the limits of his authority was one of the causes of the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]], conventionally dated to the year 1054, which split the church into the Catholic Church in the West, headed by the Bishop of Rome, and the Orthodox Church, led by the four eastern patriarchs (Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch and Alexandria).

The vibration occurs when a [[guitarist|guitar player]] [[Strumming|strums]], [[plectrum|plucks]], [[fingerpicking|fingerpicks]], or [[tapping|taps]] the strings. The pickup used to sense the vibration generally uses [[electromagnetic induction]] to do so, though other technologies exist. In any case, the signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a [[loudspeaker]], so it is fed to a [[guitar amplifier]] before being sent to the speaker(s), which converts it into audible [[sound]].\n\nSince the output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, it can be electronically altered to change the [[timbre]] of the sound. Often, the signal is modified using [[Effects unit|effect]]s such as [[reverb]], and [[Distortion (music)|distortion and \"overdrive\"]]; the latter effect is considered to be a key element of electric [[blues]] guitar music and [[rock music|rock]] guitar playing.\n\nInvented in 1931, the amplified electric guitar was adopted by [[jazz guitar]] players, who wanted to play single-note [[guitar solo]]s in large [[big band]] ensembles. Early proponents of the electric guitar on record include [[Les Paul]], [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], [[T-Bone Walker]], and [[Charlie Christian]]. During the 1950s and 1960s, the electric guitar became the most important instrument in [[popular music]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of 20th-Century Technology, Volume 2 |first1=Colin |last1=Hempstead |first2=William E. |last2=Worthington |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2005 |isbn=1-57958-464-0|page=793 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wkIlnNjDWcC&pg=PA793}}</ref> It has evolved into an instrument that is capable of a multitude of sounds and styles in genres ranging from [[popular music|pop and rock]] to [[country music]], [[blues]] and [[jazz]]. It served as a major component in the development of [[electric blues]], [[rock and roll]], [[rock music]], [[heavy metal music]] and many other genres of music.\n\nElectric guitar design and construction vary greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of the neck, bridge, and pickups. Guitars may have a fixed [[bridge (guitar)|bridge]] or a spring-loaded hinged bridge, which lets players \"bend\" the pitch of notes or chords up or down, or perform [[vibrato]] effects. The sound of an electric guitar can be modified by [[extended technique|new playing techniques]] such as [[string bending]], [[tapping]], and [[Hammer-on|hammering-on]], using [[audio feedback]], or [[slide (guitar technique)|slide guitar]] playing. There are several types of electric guitar, including: the [[solid-body]] guitar; various types of [[hollow-body guitar]]s; the [[six-string guitar]] (the most common type), which is usually tuned E, A, D, G, B, E, from lowest to highest strings; the [[seven-string guitar]], which typically adds a low B string below the low E; and the [[twelve-string guitar]], which has six pairs of strings.\n\nIn pop and rock music, the electric guitar is often used in two roles: as a [[rhythm guitar]], which plays the [[Chord (music)|chord]] sequences or [[Chord progression|progressions]], and [[riff (music)|riff]]s, and sets the [[Beat (music)|beat]] (as part of a [[rhythm section]]); and as a [[lead guitar]], which provides instrumental [[melody]] lines, melodic [[Fill (music)|instrumental fill]] passages, and [[guitar solo|solos]]. In a small group, such as a [[power trio]], one guitarist switches between both roles. In large rock and metal bands, there is often a rhythm guitarist and a lead guitarist.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\nMany experiments at electrically amplifying the vibrations of a string instrument were made dating back to the early part of the 20th century. Patents from the 1910s show telephone transmitters were adapted and placed inside violins and [[banjo]]s to amplify the sound. Hobbyists in the 1920s used [[Carbon microphone|carbon button microphones]] attached to the [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]]; however, these detected vibration from the bridge on top of the instrument, resulting in a weak signal.<ref name=Wheelwright>Wheelwright, Lynn; Carter, Walter (28 April 2010).

Brewer publicized his new instruments in an article in the ''Wichita Beacon'' of 2 October 1932 and through performances that month. The first recordings using the electric guitar were by [[Music of Hawaii|Hawaiian-style]] players, in 1933. Bob Dunn of [[Milton Brown]]'s Musical Brownies introduced the electric [[Hawaiian guitar]] to [[Western swing]] with his January 1935 [[Decca Records|Decca]] recordings, departing almost entirely from the Hawaiian musical influence and heading towards jazz and [[blues]]. Alvino Rey was an artist who took this instrument to a wide audience in a large orchestral setting and later developed the [[pedal steel guitar]] for Gibson. An early proponent of the electric Spanish guitar was jazz guitarist [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]], who used the instrument in two songs recorded in Chicago on 1 March 1938, \"Sweetheart Land\" and \"It's a Low-Down Dirty Shame\". Some incorrectly attribute the first recording to [[Eddie Durham]], but his recording with the [[Kansas City Five]] was made 15 days later.<ref>[[#Broadbent|Broadbent]], p. 59</ref> Durham introduced the instrument to a young [[Charlie Christian]], who made the instrument famous in his brief life and would be a major influence on jazz guitarists for decades thereafter.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.timegoesby.net/weblog/2011/03/elder-music-on-charlie-christians-shoulders.html\n|title=Elder MusIc: On Charlie Christian's Shoulders\n|author=Bennett, Ronni \n|publisher=Time Goes By\n|date=20 March 2011\n|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> \n-->\nGibson's first production electric guitar, marketed in 1936, was the [[Gibson ES-150|ES-150]] model (\"ES\" for \"Electric Spanish\", and \"150\" reflecting the $150 price of the instrument, along with matching amplifier). The ES-150 guitar featured a single-coil, hexagonally shaped \"bar\" pickup, which was designed by Walt Fuller. It became known as the \"Charlie Christian\" pickup (named for the great jazz guitarist who was among the first to perform with the ES-150 guitar). The ES-150 achieved some popularity but suffered from unequal loudness across the six strings.\n\n<!--\nI've comment this out.

A possibly apocryphal story relates that Dunn hooked his guitar up to a car battery during an outdoor dance so he could be heard. However, historian Kevin Reed Coffey indicates that Dunn wanted to accomplish more than volume with electrification. He writes, \"Not content with just being louder, Dunn experimented with ways to capture the brassy resonance of jazz horns. According to surviving contemporaries, he emulated musicians such as Texas trombonist Jack Teagarden and the great trumpeter Louis Armstrong, and his approach to the steel was based on their styles, their tone, their phrasing and attack.\"<ref>Lost Chords, Richard M. Sudhalter, Oxford University Press</ref> Bill C. Malone in Country Music USA writes, \"Dunn converted a standard round-hole Martin guitar into an electric instrument by magnetizing the strings and raising them high off the box. He then attached an electric pickup to the guitar, which in turn was connected to a Vol-U-Tone amplifier.\" Dunn's first use of the electric guitar on a recording was in 1935.\n\nThe first recording of an electric Spanish guitar west of the Mississippi was in Dallas, in September 1935, during a session with Roy Newman and His Boys, an early [[Western swing]] dance band.

However, the feedback associated with hollow-bodied electric guitars was understood long before Paul's \"log\" was created in 1940; Gage Brewer's Ro-Pat-In of 1932 had a top so heavily reinforced that it essentially functioned as a solid-body instrument.<ref name=Wheelwright/> In 1945, Richard D.

At the neck joint (2.4), the neck is either glued or bolted to the body. The body (3) is typically made of wood with a hard, polymerized finish. Strings vibrating in the magnetic field of the [[Pickup (music technology)|pickups]] (3.1, 3.2) produce an electric current in the pickup winding that passes through the tone and volume [[potentiometer|controls]] (3.8) to the output jack. Some guitars have [[Piezoelectric pickup#Piezoelectric pickups|piezo]] pickups, in addition to or instead of magnetic pickups.\n\nSome guitars have a fixed [[bridge (guitar)|bridge]] (3.4). Others have a spring-loaded hinged bridge called a ''[[whammy bar|vibrato bar]]'', ''tremolo bar'', or ''whammy bar'', which lets players bend notes or chords up or down in pitch or perform a [[vibrato]] embellishment. A plastic [[pickguard]] on some guitars protects the body from scratches or covers the control cavity, which holds most of the wiring.\nThe degree to which the choice of woods and other materials in the solid-guitar body (3) affects the sonic character of the amplified signal is disputed. Many believe it is highly significant, while others think the difference between woods is subtle. In acoustic and archtop guitars, wood choices more clearly affect tone.\n\nWoods typically used in solid-body electric guitars include [[alder]] (brighter, but well rounded), swamp ash (similar to alder, but with more pronounced highs and lows), mahogany (dark, bassy, warm), poplar (similar to alder), and basswood (very neutral).<ref name=Warmoth>[http://www.warmoth.com/guitar/bodies/options/bodywoodoptions.aspx Warmoth Custom Guitars], (retrieved 16 December 2013)</ref> Maple, a very bright tonewood,<ref name=Warmoth/> is also a popular body wood, but is very heavy. For this reason it is often placed as a \"cap\" on a guitar made primarily of another wood. Cheaper guitars are often made of cheaper woods, such as plywood, pine or [[agathis]]\u2014not true hardwoods\u2014which can affect durability and tone. Though most guitars are made of wood, any material may be used. Materials such as plastic, metal, and even cardboard have been used in some instruments.\n\nThe guitar output jack typically provides a monaural signal. Many guitars with active electronics use a jack with an extra contact normally used for stereo. These guitars use the extra contact to break the ground connection to the on-board battery to preserve battery life when the guitar is unplugged. These guitars require a mono plug to close the internal switch and connect the battery to ground. Standard guitar cables use a high-impedance {{convert|1/4|in|mm|2}} mono plug. These have a tip and sleeve configuration referred to as a [[Phone connector (audio)|TS phone connector]]. The voltage is usually around 1 to 9 millivolts.\n\nA few guitars feature stereo output, such as [[Rickenbacker]] guitars equipped with ''Rick-O-Sound''. There are a variety of ways the \"stereo\" effect may be implemented. Commonly, but not exclusively, stereo guitars route the neck and bridge pickups to separate output buses on the guitar. A stereo cable then routes each pickup to its own signal chain or amplifier. For these applications, the most popular connector is a high-impedance {{convert|1/4|in|mm|2}} plug with a tip, ring and sleeve configuration, also known as a [[Phone connector (audio)|TRS phone connector]]. Some studio instruments, notably certain [[Gibson Les Paul]] models, incorporate a low-impedance three-pin [[XLR connector]] for [[balanced audio]]. Many exotic arrangements and connectors exist that support features such as midi and [[Guitar synthesizer#Roland GK interface|hexaphonic]] pickups.\n\n=== Bridge and tailpiece systems ===\nThe bridge and [[tailpiece]], while serving separate purposes, work closely together to affect playing style and tone. There are four basic types of bridge and tailpiece systems on electric guitars. Within these four types are many variants.\n\n==== Hard-tail ====\nA [[stoptail bridge|hard-tail]] guitar bridge anchors the strings at or directly behind the bridge and is fastened securely to the top of the instrument.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qkVMAgAAQBAJ|title=The Electric Guitar Sourcebook: How to Find the Sounds You Like|date=2006|publisher=Backbeat|year=|isbn=0879308869|edition=1.|location=San Francisco|page=20|pages=|last1=Hunter|first1=Dave}}</ref> These are common on carved-top guitars, such as the [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson Les Paul]] and the [[PRS Guitars|Paul Reed Smith models]], and on slab-body guitars, such as the [[Music Man (company)|Music Man Albert Lee]] and [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender guitars]] that are not equipped with a vibrato arm.\n\n==== Floating tailpiece ====\nA ''floating'' or ''trapeze'' [[tailpiece]] (similar to a violin's) fastens to the body at the base of the guitar. These appear on [[Rickenbacker]]s, [[Gretsch]]es, [[Epiphone]]s, a wide variety of [[archtop guitar]]s, particularly [[Jazz guitar]]s, and the 1952 Gibson Les Paul.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orgs.usd.edu/nmm/PluckedStrings/Guitars/Gibson/5916/LesPaulGuitar.html |title=Electric Guitar (Les Paul model) by Gibson, Inc., Kalamazoo, 1952 |publisher=Orgs.usd.edu |date= |accessdate=8 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Vibrato arms ====\nPictured is a ''[[tremolo arm]]'' or ''[[Vibrato systems for guitar|vibrato tailpiece]]'' style bridge and tailpiece system, often called a ''whammy bar'' or ''trem''. It uses a lever (\"vibrato arm\") attached to the bridge that can temporarily slacken or tighten the strings to alter the [[musical pitch|pitch]]. A player can use this to create a vibrato or a [[portamento]] effect. Early vibrato systems were often unreliable and made the guitar go out of tune easily. They also had a limited pitch range. Later Fender designs were better, but Fender held the patent on these, so other companies used older designs for many years. [[File:Stratocaster detail DSC06937.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of a Squier-made Fender Stratocaster. Note the vibrato arm, the 3 single-coil pickups, the volume and tone knobs.]]\n\nWith expiration of the Fender patent on the [[Stratocaster]]-style vibrato, various improvements on this type of internal, multi-spring vibrato system are now available. [[Floyd Rose]] introduced one of the first improvements on the vibrato system in many years when, in the late 1970s, he experimented with \"locking\" nuts and bridges that prevent the guitar from losing tuning, even under heavy vibrato bar use.\n\n==== String-through body ====\n[[File:Bridge string thru body.jpg|thumb|Tune-o-matic with \"strings through the body\" construction (without stopbar)]]\nThe fourth type of system employs string-through body anchoring. The strings pass over the bridge saddles, then through holes through the top of the guitar body to the back. The strings are typically anchored in place at the back of the guitar by metal [[ferrule]]s. Many believe this design improves a guitar's [[sustain]] and [[timbre]]. \nA few examples of string-through body guitars are the [[Fender Telecaster Thinline]], the [[Fender Telecaster Deluxe]], the [[B.C. Rich]] IT Warlock and Mockingbird, and the [[Schecter Guitar Research|Schecter]] Omen 6 and 7 series.\n\n===Pickups===\n{{Main|Pickup (music technology)}}\nCompared to an acoustic guitar, which has a hollow body, electric guitars make much less audible sound when their strings are plucked, so electric guitars are normally plugged into a guitar amplifier and speaker. When an electric guitar is played, string movement produces a signal by generating (i.e., [[inductance|inducing]]) a small electric current in the magnetic pickups, which are [[magnet]]s wound with coils of very fine wire. \nThe signal passes through the tone and volume circuits to the output jack, and through a cable to an [[Guitar amplifier|amplifier]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vassilis Lembessis|first=Dr.|date=1 July 2001|title=Physics... in action|url=http://www.europhysicsnews.org/10.1051/epn:2001402|journal=Europhysics News|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=125\u2013125|doi=10.1051/epn:2001402|issn=0531-7479}}</ref> The current induced is proportional to such factors as string density and the amount of movement over the pickups.<!--That vibration is, in turn, affected by several factors, such as the composition and shape of the body. ALREADY COVERED-->\n[[File:Pickups Humb 2Single.jpg|thumb|Pickups on a Fender Squier \"Fat Strat\" guitar\u2014a \"humbucker\" pickup on the left and two single-coil pickups on the right.]]\n\nBecause in most cases it is desirable to isolate coil-wound pickups from the unintended sound of internal vibration of loose coil windings, a guitar's magnetic pickups are normally embedded or \"potted\" in wax, [[lacquer]], or [[epoxy]] to prevent the pickup from producing a [[Microphonics|microphonic]] effect. Because of their natural inductive qualities, all magnetic pickups tend to pick up ambient, usually unwanted [[electromagnetic interference]] or EMI.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lemme|first1=Helmuth|title=The Secrets of Electric Guitar Pickups|url=https://www.princeton.edu/ssp/joseph-henry-project/electric-guitar-pickup/Guitar-Pickup-Theory.pdf|website=Build Your Guitar|publisher=Electronic Musician|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref> The resulting [[Hum (sound)|hum]] is particularly strong with single-coil pickups, and it is aggravated by the fact that many vintage guitars are insufficiently shielded against electromagnetic interference. The most common source is 50- or 60-[[Hertz|Hz]] hum from [[Electric power transmission|power transmission]] systems (house wiring, etc.). Since nearly all amplifiers and audio equipment associated with electric guitars must be plugged in, it is a continuing technical challenge to reduce or eliminate unwanted hum.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guitarmesh.com/best-distortion-guitar-pedal-reviews/#Donner_Morpher_High_Degree_Distortion_Guitar_Effects_Pedal|title=Donner Morpher High Degree Distortion Guitar Effects Pedal|last=|first=|date=7 October 2016|work=Guitar Mesh|access-date=6 April 2017|dead-url=|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDouble-coil or \"[[humbucker]]\" pickups were invented as a way to reduce or counter the unwanted ambient hum sounds (known as 60-cycle hum). Humbuckers have two coils of opposite magnetic and electric polarity to produce a [[Differential signaling|differential]] signal. Electromagnetic noise that hits both coils equally tries to drive the pickup signal toward positive on one coil and toward negative on the other, which cancels out the noise. The two coils are wired in phase, so their signal adds together. This high combined [[inductance]] of the two coils leads to the richer, \"fatter\" tone associated with humbucking pickups.\n\n[[Pick up (music technology)#Piezoelectric pickups|Piezoelectric pickups]] use a \"sandwich\" of quartz crystal or other piezoelectric material, typically placed beneath the string saddles or nut. These devices respond to pressure changes from all vibration at these specific points.\n\n[[Pick up (music technology)#Optical|Optical pickups]] are a type of pickup that sense string and body vibrations using infrared [[LED]] light. These pickups are not sensitive to EMI.\n\nSome \"hybrid\" electric guitars are equipped with additional [[microphone]], piezoelectric, optical, or other types of [[transducer]]s to approximate an acoustic instrument tone and broaden the sonic palette of the instrument.\n\n===Guitar necks===\nElectric guitar necks vary in composition and shape. The primary metric of guitar necks is the ''scale length'', which is the vibrating length of the strings from nut to bridge. A typical Fender guitar uses a {{convert|25.5|in|cm|adj=on}} scale length, while Gibson uses a {{convert|24.75|in|cm|adj=on}} scale length in their ''[[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]]''. While the scale length of the Les Paul is often described as 24.75&nbsp;inches, it has varied through the years by as much as a half inch.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nFrets are positioned proportionally to scale length\u2014the shorter the scale length, the closer the fret spacing. Opinions vary regarding the effect of scale length on tone and feel. Popular opinion holds that longer scale length contributes to greater [[amplitude]]. Reports of playing feel are greatly complicated by the many factors involved in this perception. String gauge and design, neck construction and relief, guitar setup, playing style and other factors contribute to the subjective impression of playability or feel.\n[[File:1966 Fender Telecaster (SN159266) neck joint plate.jpg|thumb|A bolt-on neck]]\nNecks are described as ''[[bolt-on neck|bolt-on]]'', ''[[set-in neck|set-in]]'', or ''[[neck-through]]'', depending on how they attach to the body. Set-in necks are glued to the body in the factory. They are said to have a warmer tone and greater sustain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} This is the traditional type of joint. [[Leo Fender]] pioneered bolt-on necks on electric guitars to facilitate easy adjustment and replacement. Neck-through instruments extend the neck the length of the instrument, so that it forms the center of the body, and are known for long sustain and for being particularly sturdy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} While a set-in neck can be carefully unglued by a skilled [[luthier]], and a bolt-on neck can simply be unscrewed, a neck-through design is difficult or even impossible to repair, depending on the damage. Historically, the bolt-on style has been more popular for ease of installation and adjustment. Since bolt-on necks can be easily removed, there is an after-market in replacement bolt-on necks from companies such as Warmoth and Mighty Mite. Some instruments\u2014notably most Gibson models\u2014continue to use set-in glued necks. Neck-through bodies are somewhat more common in bass guitars.\n\nMaterials for necks are selected for dimensional stability and rigidity, and some allege that they influence tone. Hardwoods are preferred, with [[maple]], [[mahogany]], and [[ash (tree)|ash]] topping the list. The neck and fingerboard can be made from different materials; for example, a guitar may have a maple neck with a [[rosewood]] or [[ebony]] fingerboard. In the 1970s, designers began to use exotic man-made materials such as [[6061 aluminium alloy|aircraft-grade aluminum]], [[carbon fiber]], and [[Ebonol (material)|ebonol]]. Makers known for these unusual materials include [[Veleno (guitar)|John Veleno]], [[Travis Bean]], [[Modulus Guitars|Geoff Gould]], and [[Alembic Inc|Alembic]].\n\nAside from possible engineering advantages, some feel that in relation to the rising cost of rare [[tonewood]]s, man-made materials may be economically preferable and more ecologically sensitive. However, wood remains popular in production instruments, though sometimes in conjunction with new materials. [[Vigier Guitars|Vigier guitars]], for example, use a wooden neck reinforced by embedding a light, carbon fiber rod in place of the usual heavier steel bar or adjustable steel truss rod. After-market necks made entirely from carbon fiber fit existing bolt-on instruments. Few, if any, extensive formal investigations have been widely published that confirm or refute claims over the effects of different woods or materials on electric guitar sound.\n[[File:MataoArtistBass Black 2 tone-rear 2.JPG|thumb|left|upright= 1.5|A neck-through bass guitar]]\nSeveral neck shapes appear on guitars, including shapes known as C necks, U necks, and V necks. These refer to the cross-sectional shape of the neck (especially near the nut). Several sizes of fret wire are available, with traditional players often preferring thin frets, and metal shredders liking thick frets. Thin frets are considered better for playing chords, while thick frets allow lead guitarists to bend notes with less effort.\n\nAn electric guitar with a folding neck called the \"Foldaxe\" was designed and built for Chet Atkins by [[Roger C. Field]].<ref>Cochran, Russ and Atkins, Chet (2003). ''Chet Atkins: Me and My Guitars'', Hal Leonard, p. 124, {{ISBN|0-634-05565-8}}.</ref> [[Steinberger]] guitars developed a line of exotic, carbon fiber instruments without headstocks, with tuning done on the bridge instead.\n\nFingerboards vary as much as necks. The fingerboard surface usually has a cross-sectional radius that is optimized to accommodate finger movement for different playing techniques. Fingerboard radius typically ranges from nearly flat (a very large radius) to radically arched (a small radius). The vintage [[Fender Telecaster]], for example, has a typical small radius of approximately {{convert|7.25|in|cm}}. Some manufacturers have experimented with fret profile and material, fret layout, number of frets, and modifications of the fingerboard surface for various reasons. Some innovations were intended to improve playability by ergonomic means, such as Warmoth Guitars' compound radius fingerboard. Scalloped fingerboards added enhanced [[Microtonal music|microtonality]] during fast legato runs. Fanned frets intend to provide each string with an optimal playing tension and enhanced musicality. Some guitars have no frets\u2014and others, like the [[Gittler guitar]], have no neck in the traditional sense.\n\n==Sound and effects==\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}}\nWhile an [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]]'s sound depends largely on the vibration of the guitar's body and the air inside it, the sound of an electric guitar depends largely on the signal from the pickups. The signal can be \"[[Timbre|shaped]]\" on its path to the [[amplifier]] via a range of effect devices or circuits that modify the tone and characteristics of the signal. Amplifiers and speakers also add coloration to the final sound.\n\n===Built-in sound shaping===\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\n{{POV section|date=May 2018}}\n}}\n{{Main|Pickup (music technology)}}\nModern electric guitars most commonly have two or three magnetic pickups. Identical pickups produce different tones depending on location between the neck and bridge. Bridge pickups produce a bright or trebly timbre, and neck pickups are warmer{{when defined as|date=November 2017}} or more bassy. The type of pickup also affects tone. Dual-coil pickups sound {{citation needed span|text=warm, thick, perhaps even muddy|date=April 2018|reason=Useless list of undefined terms}}; single-coil pickups sound {{citation needed span|text=clear, bright, perhaps even biting|date=April 2018|reason=Another useless list of undefined terms}}.\n\nGuitars don't require a uniform pickup type: a common mixture is the \"fat Strat\" arrangement of one dual-coil at the bridge position and single coils in the middle and neck positions, known as HSS (humbucker/single/single).\n\nSome guitars have a piezoelectric pickup in addition to electromagnetic pickups. Piezo pickups produce a more acoustic sound. The piezo runs through a built-in [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer (EQ)]] to improve similitude and control tone. A blend knob controls the mix between electromagnetic and piezoelectric sounds.\n\nWhere there is more than one pickup, a switch selects between the outputs of individual pickups or some combination; two-pickup guitars have three-way switches, and three-pickup guitars have five-way switches. Further circuitry sometimes combines pickups in different ways. For instance, phase switching places one pickup out of [[phase (waves)|phase]] with the other(s), leading to {{citation needed span|text=a \"honky\", \"nasal\", or \"[[funky]]\" sound|date=April 2018|reason=One more useless list of undefined terms}}. Individual pickups can also have their timbre altered by switches, typically [[coil tap]] switches that effectively short-circuit some of a dual-coil pickup's windings{{vague|date=November 2017}} to produce a tone similar to a single-coil pickup (usually done with push-pull volume knobs).\n\nThe final stages of on-board sound-shaping circuitry are the volume control ([[potentiometer]]) and tone control (a low-pass filter which \"rolls off\" the treble frequencies). Where there are individual volume controls for different pickups, and where pickup signals can be combined, they would affect the timbre of the final sound by adjusting the balance between pickups from a straight 50:50.\n\nThe strings fitted to the guitar also have an influence on tone. Rock musicians often{{when|date=April 2018}} prefer the lightest gauge of [[roundwound]] [[String (music)|string]], which is easier to [[string bending|bend]], while jazz musicians go for heavier, [[flatwound]] strings, which have a rich, dark sound. Steel, nickel, and cobalt are common string materials, and each gives a slightly different tone color.\n\n===Guitar amplifier===\n[[File:Bassman15.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Fender Bassman amp head with a 15\" speaker cabinet.]]\n{{Main|Guitar amplifier}}\nThe solid-body electric guitar does not produce enough sound for an audience to hear it in a performance setting unless it's electronically amplified\u2014plugged into an [[guitar amplifier|amplifier]], [[mixing console]], or [[public address system|PA]].\n\nGuitar amplifier design uses a different approach than [[sound reinforcement system]] [[power amplifier]]s and home [[High fidelity|\"hi-fi\"]] stereo systems. Audio amplifiers generally are intended to accurately reproduce the source signal without adding unwanted tonal coloration (i.e., they have a flat frequency response) or unwanted distortion. In contrast, most guitar amplifiers provide tonal coloration and overdrive or distortion of various types. A common tonal coloration sought by guitarists is rolling off some of the high frequencies.\n\nGuitarists in some musical genres (e.g., blues, rock) intentionally choose amplifiers or [[effects unit]]s that [[Distortion (guitar)|distort]] or otherwise alter the sound to some degree. This was not actually a new development in the musical instrument or its supporting gear, but rather a shift of [[aesthetics]], such sounds not having been thought desirable previously.\n\nGuitar amplifiers generally incorporate at least a few [[effect unit|effects]], the most basic being tone controls for bass and treble. There may be some form of \"overdrive\" control, where the preamplifier's output is increased to the point where the amplitude overloads the input of the power amplifier stage, causing [[Clipping (audio)|clipping]]. In the 1970s, as effects pedals proliferated, their sounds were combined with tube amp distortion at lower, more controlled volumes by using [[Attenuator (electronics)|power attenuators]], such as [[Tom Scholz]]'s Power Soak, as well as re-amplified dummy loads, such as [[Eddie Van Halen]]'s use of dummy-load power resistor, post-power-tube effects, and a final solid-state amp driving the guitar speakers.\n\nAmong the first actual on-board effects were a [[tremolo]] system (sometimes incorrectly labeled and marketed as [[vibrato]]), or a mechanical [[spring reverb]] unit. In the 2010s, guitar amps often contain multiple effects, such as [[distortion (music)|distortion]], chorus, flanger, phaser, or octave shift.\n\nRecent amplifiers may include digital technology similar to effects pedals, up to the ability to [[Amplifier modeling|model]] or emulate a variety of classic amplifiers. Some modeling systems also emulate the tonal characteristics of different speaker configurations, cabinets, and microphones. Nearly all amp and speaker cabinet modeling is done digitally, using computer techniques (e.g., Digital Signal Processing or [[Digital signal processing|DSP]] circuitry and software).\n\n===Effects units===\n{{Main|Effects unit}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:DS 1 Distortion.jpg|thumb|right| A Boss distortion pedal in use]]\nIn the 1960s, the [[timbre|tonal palette]] of the electric guitar was further modified by introducing [[effect unit]]s in its signal path, before the guitar amp, of which one of the earliest units was the [[Maestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone|fuzz pedal]]. Effects units come in several formats, the most common of which are the [[stompbox]] \"pedal\" and the [[rackmount]] unit. A stomp box (or pedal) is a small metal or plastic box containing the circuitry, which is placed on the floor in front of the musician and connected in line with the patch cord connected to the instrument. The box is typically controlled by one or more foot-pedal on-off switches and it typically contains only one or two effects. Pedals are smaller than rackmount effects and usually less expensive. \"[[Guitar pedalboard]]s\" are used by musicians who use multiple stomp-boxes; these may be a [[DIY]] project made with [[plywood]] or a commercial stock or custom-made pedalboard.\n\nA rackmount effects unit may contain an electronic circuit nearly identical to a stompbox-based effect, but it is mounted in a standard 19\" equipment rack, which is usually mounted in a [[road case]] that is designed to protect the equipment during transport. More recently, as signal-processing technology continuously becomes more feature-dense, rack-mount effects units frequently contain several types of effects. They are typically controlled by knobs or switches on the front panel, and often by a [[MIDI]] digital control interface.\n\nTypical effects include:\n* Effects such as [[chorus effect|stereo chorus]], [[phaser (effect)|phaser]]s and [[flanger]]s, which shift the pitch of the signal by a small and varying amount, creating swirling, shimmering and whooshing noises\n* Effects such as [[octaver]]s, which displace pitch by an exact musical interval\n* Distortion, such as [[transistor]]-style [[fuzz (electric guitar)|fuzz]], effects incorporating, emulating [[vacuum tube]] distortion or overdrive\n* [[Electronic filter|Filter]]s, such as [[Wah-wah pedal|wah-wah]]\n* Envelope shapers, such as [[compression (electric guitar)|compression/sustain]] or [[swell pedal|volume/swell]]\n* Time-shift effects, such as [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]] and [[reverberation|reverb]]\n\n===Digital and software-based effects===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:P\u00e9dale multi-effets.jpg|Description Zoom 505 II multi-effect|thumb|right|150px|The Zoom 505 multi-effect pedal]]\nA '''multi-effects device''' (also called a \"multi-FX\" device) is a single electronics effects pedal or rack-mount device that contains many electronic effects. In the late 1990s and throughout the 2000s, multi-FX manufacturers such as [[Zoom Corporation|Zoom]] and [[Korg]] produced devices that were increasingly feature-laden. Multi-FX devices combine several effects together, and most devices allow users to use preset combinations of effects, including distortion, chorus, reverb, compression, and so on. This allows musicians to have quick on-stage access to different effects combinations. Some multi-FX pedals contain modelled versions of well-known effects pedals or amplifiers.\n[[File:Pedaleira Boss GT-8.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Boss GT-8, a higher-end multi-effect processing pedal; note the preset switches and patch bank foot switches and built-in expression pedal.]]\nMulti-effects devices have garnered a large share of the effects device market, because they offer the user such a large variety of effects in a single package. A low-priced multi-effects pedal may provide 20 or more effects for the price of a regular single-effect pedal. More expensive multi-effect pedals may include 40 or more effects, amplifier modelling, and the ability to combine effects or modelled amp sounds in different combinations, as if the user was using multiple guitar amps. More expensive multi-effects pedals may also include more input and output jacks (e.g., an auxiliary input or a \"dry\" output), MIDI inputs and outputs, and an expression pedal, which can control volume or modify effect parameters (e.g., the rate of the simulated rotary speaker effect).\n\nBy the 1980s and 1990s, software effects became capable of replicating the analog effects used in the past. These new digital effects attempt to model the sound produced by analog effects and tube amps, with varying degrees of quality. There are many free guitar effects computer programs that can be downloaded from the Internet. Now, computers with sound cards can be used as digital guitar effects processors. Although digital and software effects offer many advantages, many guitarists still use analog effects.\n\n===Synthesizer and digital guitars===\n{{Main|Guitar synthesizer}}\n\n==Playing techniques==\n{{multiple issues|\n{{howto section|date=April 2018}}\n{{original research section|date=April 2018}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n{{POV section|date=April 2018}}\n}}\n[[File:myprepguitar.jpg|thumb|A [[prepared guitar]]]]\nThe sound of a guitar can not only be adapted by electronic sound effects but is also heavily affected by various new techniques developed or becoming possible in combination with electric amplification. This is called [[extended technique]].\n\nExtended techniques include:\n* [[String bending]]. This is not unique to the electric instrument, but it is greatly facilitated by the light strings typically used on solid-body guitars.\n* Neck bending, by holding the upper arm on the guitar body and bending the neck either to the front or pulling it back. This is used as a substitute for a tremolo bar, although not as effective, and the use of too much force could snap the guitar neck.\n* The use of the [[Vibrato systems for guitar|vibrato bar]] (whammy bar or tremolo arm), including the extreme technique of [[dive bomb]]ing. The tremolo arm varies string tension to raise or lower pitch. Instead of bending individual notes, this lets the player bend all notes at once to sound lower or higher.\n* [[Tapping]], in which both hands are applied to the fretboard. Tapping may be performed either one-handed or two-handed. It is an extended technique, executed by using one hand to tap the strings against the fingerboard, thus producing legato notes. Tapping usually incorporates pull-offs or hammer-ons as well, where the fingers of the left hand play a sequence of notes in synchronization with the tapping hand.\n* [[Hammer-on|Hammering on]] the string with the fretting hand.\n[[File:Hammer on.gif|thumb|right|200px|The hammer-on technique]]\n* [[Pinch harmonic]]s or [[artificial harmonic]]s, sometimes called \"squealies\". This technique involves adding the edge of the thumb or the tip of the index finger on the picking hand to the regular picking action, resulting in a high-pitched sound.\n* [[Volume swell]], in which the volume knob is repeatedly rolled to create a violin-like sound. The same result can also be accomplished through the use of an external [[swell pedal]], although the knob technique can enhance showmanship and conveniently eliminate the need for another pedal.\n* Use of [[audio feedback]] to enhance sustain and change timbre. Feedback has become a striking characteristic of rock music, as electric guitar players such as [[Jeff Beck]], [[Pete Townshend]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] deliberately induced feedback by holding their guitars close to the [[Guitar amplifier|amplifier]]. [[Lou Reed]] created his 1975 album ''[[Metal Machine Music]]'' entirely from loops of feedback played at various speeds. A good example of feedback can be heard on [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s performance of \"Can You See Me?\" at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]]. The entire guitar solo was created using amplifier feedback.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS8NcNnwl9U Hendrix's live performance of \"Can You See Me?\"]. Youtube. Feedback begins at the 1:39 mark in the video.</ref>\n* Substitution of another device for the [[plectrum]], for instance the cello bow (as famously used by [[Jimmy Page]]) and the [[e-bow]], a device using electromagnetic [[feedback]] to vibrate strings without direct contact. Like feedback, these techniques increase sustain, bring out [[harmonics]] and change the acoustic [[envelope (waves)|envelope]].\n* [[Fernandes Sustainer|Sustainers]] built into the guitar itself.\n[[File:Palm mute by punkettaro.gif|thumb|left|200px|Palm muting of the strings using the picking hand]]\n* Use of a [[slide (guitar technique)|slide]] or [[Slide guitar|bottleneck]]. The term ''slide'' refers to the motion of the slide against the strings, while ''bottleneck'' refers to the material originally used for such slides: the necks of glass bottles. Instead of altering the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of a string in the normal manner (by pressing the string against a fret), a slide is placed upon the string to vary its vibrating length and thus its pitch. The slide can be moved along the string without lifting, creating continuous transitions in pitch.\n* Sometimes guitars are even adapted with extra modifications to alter the sound, such as [[prepared guitar]] and [[#3rd bridge|3rd bridge]].\n[[File:Slide guitar 1.jpg|thumb|right |200px |Slide guitar]]\nOther techniques, such as axial [[finger vibrato]], [[pull-off]]s, [[hammer-on]]s, [[palm muting]], [[Guitar harmonic|harmonics]] and [[altered guitar tuning|altered tunings]], are also used on the [[classical guitar|classical]] and acoustic guitar. [[Shred guitar]] is a genre involving a number of extended techniques.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:PRS Platinum.jpg|thumb|Paul Reed Smith Standard 22]]\n\n[[File:Gittler (electric guitar) (1970-1985) - MIM PHX.jpg|thumb|150px|Gittler electric guitar, a bodyless guitar without fingerboard or neck]]\n\n===Solid-body===\n[[File:1954 Fender Esquire ($27,000), Vintage Guitar show, SXSW2009 (clip).jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Fender Esquire]]]]\nUnlike acoustic guitars, [[solid-body]] electric guitars have no vibrating soundboard to amplify string vibration. Instead, solid-body instruments depend on electric pickups and an [[amplifier]] (or amp) and [[Computer speaker|speaker]]. The solid body ensures that the amplified sound reproduces the string vibration alone, thus avoiding the [[wolf tone]]s and unwanted [[Audio feedback|feedback]] associated with amplified acoustic guitars. These guitars are generally made of hardwood covered with a hard [[polymer]] finish, often polyester or lacquer. In large production facilities, the wood is stored for three to six months in a wood-drying [[kiln]] before being cut to shape. Premium custom-built guitars are frequently made with much older, hand-selected wood.\n\nOne of the first solid-body guitars was invented by [[Les Paul]]. [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] did not present their [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar prototypes to the public, as they did not believe the solid-body style would catch on. Another early solid-body Spanish style guitar, resembling what would become Gibson's Les Paul guitar a decade later, was developed in 1941 by O.W. Appleton, of Nogales, Arizona.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.owappleton.com/ |title=O. W.

These hollows are designed specifically not to interfere with the critical bridge and string anchor point on the solid body. In the case of Gibson and PRS, these are called chambered bodies. The motivation for this may be to reduce weight, to achieve a semi-acoustic tone (see below) or both.<ref>Hunter, Dave (19 October 2007) [http://www.gibson.com/en-us/lifestyle/productspotlight/gearandinstruments/chambering%20the%20les%20paul_%20a%20mar/ Chambering the Les Paul: A Marriage of Weight and Tone].

Building the Ergonomic Guitar.</ref>\n\n===Semi-acoustic {{anchor|Hollow body}}===\n{{Main|Semi-acoustic guitar}}\n[[File:Guitard Epiphone 03.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|Epiphone semi-acoustic hollow-body guitar]]\nSemi-acoustic guitars have a hollow body (similar in depth to a solid-body guitar) and electronic pickups mounted on the body. They work in a similar way to solid-body electric guitars except that, because the hollow body also vibrates, the pickups convert a combination of string and body vibration into an electrical signal. Whereas chambered guitars are made, like solid-body guitars, from a single block of wood, semi-acoustic and full-hollowbody guitars bodies are made from thin sheets of wood. They do not provide enough acoustic volume for live performance, but they can be used unplugged for quiet practice. Semi-acoustics are noted for being able to provide a sweet, plaintive, or funky tone. They are used in many genres, including blues, [[funk]], sixties pop, and [[indie rock]]. They generally have cello-style [[F-shaped sound hole]]s. These can be blocked off to prevent feedback, as in [[B. B. King]]'s famous [[Lucille (guitar)|Lucille]]. Feedback can also be reduced by making them with a solid block in the middle of the soundbox.\n\n===Full hollow-body===\n{{Main|Archtop guitar}}\nFull hollow-body guitars have large, deep bodies made of glued-together sheets, or \"plates\", of wood. They can often be played at the same volume as an acoustic guitar and therefore can be used unplugged at intimate gigs. They qualify as electric guitars inasmuch as they have fitted pickups. Historically, archtop guitars\nwith [[retrofit]]ted pickups were among the very earliest electric guitars. The instrument originated during the [[Jazz Age]], in the 1920s and 1930s, and are still considered the classic [[jazz guitar]] (nicknamed \"jazzbox\"). Like semi-acoustic guitars, they often have [[f-shaped sound hole]]s.\n\nHaving humbucker pickups (sometimes just a neck pickup) and usually strung heavlly, jazzboxes are noted for their warm, rich tone. A variation with single-coil pickups, and sometimes with a [[Bigsby vibrato tailpiece|Bigsby tremolo]], has long been popular in [[country music|country]] and [[rockabilly]]; it has a distinctly more twangy, biting tone than the classic jazzbox. The term ''[[archtop]]'' refers to a method of construction subtly different from the typical acoustic (or [[steel string guitar|\"folk\" or \"western\" or \"steel-string\" guitar]]): the top is formed from a moderately thick ({{convert|1|in|cm}}) piece of wood, which is then carved into a thin ({{convert|0.1|in|cm}}) domed shape, whereas conventional acoustic guitars have a thin, flat top.\n\n=== Electric acoustic ===\n{{Main|Acoustic-electric guitar}}\nSome [[steel-string acoustic guitar]]s are fitted with [[Pick up (music technology)|pickups]] purely as an alternative to using a separate microphone. They may also be fitted with a [[piezoelectric]] pickup under the bridge, attached to the bridge mounting plate, or with a low-mass [[microphone]] (usually a condenser mic) inside the body of the guitar that converts the vibrations in the body into electronic signals. Combinations of these types of pickups may be used, with an integral mixer/preamp/graphic equalizer. Such instruments are called [[electric acoustic guitar]]s. They are regarded as acoustic guitars rather than electric guitars, because the pickups do not produce a signal directly from the vibration of the strings, but rather from the vibration of the guitar top or body.\n\nElectric acoustic guitars should not be confused with [[semi-acoustic guitar]]s, which have pickups of the type found on solid-body electric guitars, or solid-body [[hybrid guitar]]s with piezoelectric pickups.\n\n===String, bridge, and neck variants===\n\n====One-string====\nThe one-string guitar is also known as the [[Unitar]]. Although rare, the one-string guitar is sometimes heard, particularly in [[Delta blues]], where improvised folk instruments were popular in the 1930s and 1940s. [[Eddie \"One String\" Jones]] had some regional success.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Mississippi [[blues]] musician [[Lonnie Pitchford]] played a similar, homemade instrument. In a more contemporary style, Little Willie Joe, the inventor of the [[Unitar]], had a [[rhythm and blues]] [[instrumental]] hit in the 1950s with \"Twitchy\", recorded with the Rene Hall Orchestra.\n\n====Four-string====\nThe four-string guitar is better known as the [[tenor guitar]]. One of its best-known players was [[Tiny Grimes]], who played on [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]] with the [[bebop]]pers and played a major role in the Prestige Blues Swingers. Multi-instrumentalist [[Warren Ellis (musician)]] of [[Dirty Three]] and [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]] is a contemporary player who includes a tenor guitar in his repertoire.\n\nThe four-string guitar is normally tuned CGDA, but some players, such as Tiny Grimes, tune to DGBE to preserve familiar 6-string guitar chord fingerings. The tenor guitar can also be tuned like a soprano, concert, or tenor ukulele, using versions of GCEA tuning.\n\n==== Seven-string ====\n{{Main|Seven-string guitar}}\n[[File:Stephen Carpenter 2009.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stephen Carpenter playing a 7-string electric guitar in 2009]]\nMost seven-string guitars add a low B string below the low E. Both electric and [[classical guitar]]s exist designed for this tuning. A high A string above the high E instead of the low B string is sometimes used. Another less common seven-string arrangement is a second G string situated beside the standard G string and tuned an octave higher, in the same manner as a twelve-stringed guitar (see below). [[Jazz guitarist]]s using a seven-string include [[George Van Eps]], [[Lenny Breau]], [[Bucky Pizzarelli]] and his son [[John Pizzarelli]].\n\nSeven-string electric guitars were popularized among rock players in the 1980s by [[Steve Vai]]. Along with the Japanese guitar company [[Ibanez]], Vai created the [[Ibanez Universe|Universe]] series seven-string guitars in the 1980s, with a double locking tremolo system for a seven-string guitar. These models were based on Vai's six-string signature series, the [[Ibanez Jem]]. Seven-string guitars experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 2000s, championed by [[Deftones]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[Slayer]], [[KoRn]], [[Fear Factory]], [[Strapping Young Lad]], [[Nevermore]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]] and other [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|metal]] bands. Metal musicians often prefer the seven-string guitar for its extended lower range. The seven-string guitar has also played an essential role in [[progressive metal]] rock and is commonly used in bands such as [[Dream Theater]] and [[Pain of Salvation]] and by experimental guitarists such as Ben Levin.\n\n====Eight- and nine-string====\n{{Main|Eight-string guitar}}\nEight-string electric guitars are rare but not unused. One is played by [[Charlie Hunter]], which was manufactured by [[Novax Guitars]]. The largest manufacturer of eight- to 14-string instruments is Warr Guitars. Their models are used by [[Trey Gunn]] (ex [[King Crimson]]), who has his own ''signature'' line from the company. Similarly, [[M\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m]] and [[Fredrik Thordendal]] of [[Meshuggah]] used 8-string guitars made by Nevborn Guitars and now guitars by [[Ibanez]]. [[Munky]] of the [[nu metal]] band [[KoRn]] is also known to use seven-string Ibanez guitars, and it is rumored that he is planning to release a K8 eight-string guitar similar to his K7 seven-string guitar. Another Ibanez player is [[Tosin Abasi]], lead guitarist of the [[progressive metal]] band [[Animals as Leaders]], who uses an Ibanez RG2228 to mix bright chords with very heavy low riffs on the seventh and eighth strings. [[Stephen Carpenter]] of [[Deftones]] also switched from a seven-string to an eight-string in 2008 and released his signature STEF B-8 with [[ESP Guitars]]. In 2008, Ibanez released the Ibanez RG2228-GK, which is the first mass-produced eight-string guitar. [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]'s first album uses a nine-string guitar. [[Bill Kelliher]], guitarist for the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] group [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]], worked with [[First Act]] on a custom mass-produced nine-string guitar.\n\n==== Ten-string ====\n{{Main|Ten-string guitar}}\n\n[[B.C. Rich]] manufactured a ten-string six-[[course (music)|course]] electric guitar, the Bich, whose radical shape positioned the machine heads for the four secondary strings onto the body, avoiding the head-heaviness of many electric twelve-string guitars. However, many players bought it for the body shape or electrics and simply removed the extra strings. The company recognized this and released six-string models of the Bich, a shape now generally incorporated into their standard Warlock.\n\n==== Twelve-string ====\n{{Main|Twelve-string guitar}}\nTwelve-string electric guitars feature six pairs of strings, usually with each pair tuned to the same note. The extra E, A, D, and G strings add a note one octave above, and the extra B and E strings are in unison. The pairs of strings are played together as one, so the technique and tuning are the same as a conventional guitar, but they create a much fuller tone, with the additional strings adding a natural [[chorus effect]]. They are used almost solely to play harmony and rhythm parts, rather than for [[guitar solo]]s. They are relatively common in [[folk rock]] music. [[Lead Belly]] is the folk artist most identified with the twelve-string guitar, usually acoustic with a pickup.\n\n[[George Harrison]] of the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] and [[Roger McGuinn]] of the [[The Byrds|Byrds]] brought the electric twelve-string to notability in [[rock and roll]]. During the Beatles' first trip to the United States, in February 1964, Harrison received a new [[Rickenbacker 360/12|360/12]] model guitar from the [[Rickenbacker]] company, a twelve-string electric made to look onstage like a six-string. He began using the 360 in the studio on Lennon's \"You Can't Do That\" and other songs. McGuinn began using electric twelve-string guitars to create the jangly, ringing sound of the Byrds. Both [[Jimmy Page]], the guitarist with [[Led Zeppelin]], and [[Leo Kottke]], a solo artist, are well known as twelve-string guitar players.\n\n====Third-bridge====\n{{Main|3rd bridge}}\n\nThe third-bridge guitar is an electric [[prepared guitar]] with an additional, third bridge. This can be a normal guitar with, for instance, a screwdriver placed under the strings, or it can be a [[Experimental musical instrument|custom-made instrument]]. [[Lee Ranaldo]] of [[Sonic Youth]] plays with a third bridge.\n\n====Double-neck====\n{{Main|Double neck guitar}}\n[[File:Gibson EDS1275.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Gibson EDS-1275]]]]\n[[Multi-neck guitar|Double-neck]] (or, less commonly, \"twin-neck\") guitars enable guitarists to play both guitar and bass guitar or, more commonly, both a six-string and a [[twelve-string guitar|twelve-string]]. In the mid-1960s, one of the first players to use this type of guitar was [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]]' guitarist [[Drake Levin]]. Another early user was [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]. The double-neck guitar was popularized by [[Jimmy Page]], who used a custom-made, cherry-finished [[Gibson EDS-1275]] to perform \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\", \"[[The Song Remains the Same (song)|The Song Remains the Same]]\" and \"[[The Rain Song]]\", although for the recording of \"Stairway to Heaven\" he used a Fender Telecaster and a Fender XII electric twelve-string. [[Mike Rutherford]] of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Mike + the Mechanics]] is also famous for his use of a double-neck guitar during live shows. [[Don Felder]] of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] used the Gibson EDS-1275 during the [[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]] tour. Muse guitarist and vocalist [[Matthew Bellamy]] uses a silver Manson double-neck on his band's [[The Resistance Tour|Resistance Tour]]. [[Rush (band)|Rush]] guitarist [[Alex Lifeson]] is also known for using double-neck guitars in the live performance of several songs. In performances of the song \"Xanadu\" during the band's 2015 R40 anniversary tour, Lifeson played a white Gibson EDS-1275 double-neck guitar with six-string and twelve-string necks, while bassist [[Geddy Lee]] performed with a double-neck Rickenbacker guitar with four-string bass and twelve-string guitar necks.\n\n==Genres==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{original research section|date=April 2018}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n{{POV section|date=April 2018}}\n}}\n\n===Popular music===\n[[Popular music]] typically uses the electric guitar in two roles: as a rhythm guitar to provide the basic [[chord progression]] and [[rhythm]], and a ''lead guitar'' that plays [[melody]] lines, melodic [[fill (music)|instrumental fill passages]], and [[guitar solo|solos]]. In some bands with two guitarists, both may play in tandem, and trade off rhythm and lead roles. In bands with a single guitarist, the guitarist may switch between these roles, playing chords to accompany the singer's lyrics, and a solo.\n[[File:Gibson_Custom_50th_Anniversary_1959_Les_Paul_Standard_(2009)_brighten.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Gibson Les Paul]] has been used in many genres, including [[rock music|rock]], [[country music|country]], [[pop music|pop]], [[soul music|soul]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[reggae]], [[punk music|punk]], and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]]]\nIn the most commercially available and consumed pop and rock genres, electric guitars tend to dominate their [[Acoustic guitar|acoustic]] cousins in both the recording studio and live venues, especially in the \"harder\" genres such as [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hard rock]]. However the acoustic guitar remains a popular choice in [[country music|country]], [[Western music (North America)|western]] and especially [[bluegrass music]], and it is widely used in [[folk music]]. Even metal and hard rock guitarists play acoustic guitars for some [[ballad]]s and for [[MTV unplugged]] acoustic performances.\n\n===Jazz and other more complex styles===\n[[Jazz guitar]] playing styles include rhythm guitar-style \"[[comping]]\" (accompanying) with jazz chord [[voicing (music)|voicings]] (and in some cases, [[walking bass]]lines) and \"blowing\" (improvising solos) over jazz [[chord progression]]s with jazz-style phrasing and ornaments. The accompanying style for electric guitar in most [[jazz]] styles differs from the way chordal instruments accompany in many popular styles of music. In rock and pop, the rhythm guitarist typically performs chords in dense and regular fashion to define a tune's rhythm. Simpler music tends to use chord voicings focused on the first, third, and fifth notes of the chord. In contrast, more complex music styles of pop might intermingle periodic chords and delicate voicings into pauses in the melody or solo. Complex guitar chord voicings are often have no [[root (chord)|root]], especially in chords that have more than six notes. Such chords typically emphasize the third and seventh notes of the chord. These chords also often include the 9th, 11th and 13th notes of the chord, which are called ''extensions'', or ''color notes''.\n\nWhen guitarists who play jazz and other more complex styles [[improvisation|improvise]], they use scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chord progression. The must learn how to use scales (whole tone scale, chromatic scale, etc.) to solo over chord progressions. Soloists try to imbue melodic phrasing with the sense of natural breathing and legato phrasing used by players of other instruments. Jazz guitarists are influenced by trumpet, saxophone, and other horn players. Celtic fingerstyle players are influenced [[bagpipes|pipes]] and [[violin|fiddles]].\n\nJazz guitarists typically play hollow-body instruments, but also use solid-body guitars. Hollow-body instruments were the first guitars used in jazz in the 1930s and 1940s. During the 1970s [[jazz fusion]] era, many jazz guitarists switched to the solid body guitars that dominated the rock world, using powerful guitar amps for volume.\n\n===Contemporary classical music===\nUntil the 1950s, the acoustic, nylon-stringed classical guitar was the only type of guitar favored by classical, or [[art music]] composers. In the 1950s a few [[Contemporary classical music|contemporary classical]] composers began to use the electric guitar in their compositions. Examples of such works include [[Luciano Berio]]'s ''[[Nones (Berio)|Nones]]'' (1954) [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s ''[[Gruppen (Stockhausen)|Gruppen]]'' (1955\u201357); [[Donald Erb]]'s ''String Trio'' (1966), [[Morton Feldman]]'s ''The Possibility of a New Work for Electric Guitar'' (1966); [[George Crumb]]'s ''Songs, Drones, and Refrains of Death'' (1968); [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s ''Versuch \u00fcber Schweine'' (1968); [[Francis Thorne]]'s ''Sonar Plexus'' (1968) and ''Liebesrock'' (1968\u201369), [[Michael Tippett]]'s ''[[The Knot Garden]]'' (1965\u201370); [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[Mass (Bernstein)|MASS]]''<!--Note: the composer titled this work in ALL CAPS--> (1971) and ''Slava!'' (1977); [[Louis Andriessen]]'s ''De Staat'' (1972\u201376); [[Helmut Lachenmann]]'s ''Fassade, f\u00fcr grosses Orchester'' (1973, rev. 1987), [[Valery Gavrilin]] ''Anyuta'' (1982), [[Steve Reich]]'s ''[[Electric Counterpoint]]'' (1987), [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]]'s ''Miserere'' (1989/92), [[Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g]]'s ''Grabstein f\u00fcr Stephan'' (1989), and countless works composed for the quintet of [[\u00c1stor Piazzolla]].\n[[Alfred Schnittke]] also used electric guitar in several works, like the \"Requiem\", \"Concerto Grosso N\u00b02\" and \"Symphony N\u00b01\".\n\nIn the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, a growing number of composers (many of them composer-performers who had grown up playing the instrument in rock bands) began writing contemporary classical music for the electric guitar. These include [[Frank Zappa]], [[Shawn Lane]], [[Steven Mackey]], [[Nick Didkovsky]], [[Scott Johnson (composer)|Scott Johnson]], [[Lois V Vierk]], [[Tim Brady (composer)|Tim Brady]], [[Tristan Murail]], [[Brian May]] and Randall Woolf.\n\n[[Yngwie Malmsteen]] released his [[Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra]] in 1998, and [[Steve Vai]] released a double-live CD entitled ''[[Sound Theories]]'', of his work with the Netherlands Metropole Orchestra in June 2007. The American composers [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] have written \"symphonic\" works for large ensembles of electric guitars, in some cases numbering up to 100 players, and the instrument is a core member of the [[Bang on a Can]] All-Stars (played by [[Mark Stewart (guitarist)|Mark Stewart]]). Still, like many electric and electronic instruments, the electric guitar remains primarily associated with rock and jazz music, rather than with classical compositions and performances.<ref>For more on this subject see {{cite journal|doi=10.1080/09298219408570664|title=Contemporary compositional techniques for the electric guitar in United States concert music|year=1994|last1=Tomaro|first1=Robert|journal=Journal of New Music Research|volume=23|issue=4|pages=349}}</ref> [[Guitar Prasanna|R.

Probably the most ambitious and perhaps significant work to date is ''Ingwe'' (2003\u20132009) by [[Georges Lentz]] (written for Australian guitarist [[Zane Banks]]), a 60-minute work for solo electric guitar, exploring that composer's existential struggles and taking the instrument into realms previously unknown in a concert music setting.\n\n=== Vietnamese traditional music ===\n\nIn [[Vietnam]], electric guitars are often used as an instrument in [[c\u1ea3i l\u01b0\u01a1ng]] music (traditional southern Vietnamese folk opera), sometimes as a substitute for certain traditional stringed instruments like the [[\u0110\u00e0n nguy\u1ec7t]] (two-stringed lute) when they are not available.

From [[Gray's Anatomy]].]]\n'''Embryo drawing''' is the [[illustration]] of [[embryo]]s in their [[Embryogenesis|developmental sequence]]. In plants and animals, an embryo develops from a [[zygote]], the single cell that results when an [[Egg (biology)|egg]] and [[sperm]] fuse during [[fertilization]].  In animals, the zygote divides repeatedly to form a ball of cells, which then forms a set of tissue layers that migrate and fold to form an early embryo. Images of embryos provide a means of comparing embryos of different ages, and [[species (biology)|species]]. To this day, embryo drawings are made in [[undergraduate]] [[developmental biology]] lessons.\n\nComparing different embryonic stages of different animals is a tool that can be used to infer relationships between species, and thus [[biological evolution]]. This has been a source of quite some controversy, both now and in the past. [[Ernst Haeckel]] pioneered in this field. By comparing different embryonic stages of different [[vertebrate]] species, he formulated the [[recapitulation theory]]. This [[theory]] states that an animal's embryonic development follows exactly the same sequence as the sequence of its evolutionary ancestors. Haeckel's work and the ensuing controversy linked the fields of [[developmental biology]] and [[comparative anatomy]] into comparative [[embryology]]. From a more modern perspective, Haeckel's drawings were the beginnings of the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo).\n\nThe study of comparative embryology aims to prove or disprove that vertebrate embryos of different [[class (biology)|classes]] (e.g. mammals vs. fish) follow a similar developmental path due to their common ancestry. Such developing vertebrates have similar [[gene]]s, which determine the basic body plan. However, further development allows for the distinguishing of distinct characteristics as adults.\n\n==Use of embryo drawings and photography in contemporary biology==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nIn current biology, fundamental research in developmental biology and evolutionary developmental biology is no longer driven by [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] comparisons between embryos, but more by [[molecular biology]]. This is partly because Haeckel's drawings were very inaccurate.\n\n==Controversy==\nThe exactness of [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s drawings of embryos has caused much controversy among [[Intelligent Design]] proponents recently and Haeckel's intellectual opponents in the past.  Although the early embryos of different species exhibit similarities, Haeckel apparently exaggerated these similarities in support of his [[Recapitulation theory]], sometimes known as the [[Biogenetic Law]] or \"[[Ontogeny]] recapitulates [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]]\". Furthermore, Haeckel even proposed theoretical life-forms to accommodate certain stages in embryogenesis. A recent review concluded that the \"biogenetic law is supported by several recent studies - if applied to single characters only\".<ref>Michael K.

Hist. 109 (March 2000): 42-49.</ref> have objected to the continued use of Haeckel's embryo drawings in textbooks.\n\nOn the other hand, Michael K. Richardson, Professor of Evolutionary Developmental Zoology, [[Leiden University]], while recognizing that some criticisms of the drawings are legitimate (indeed, it was he and his co-workers who began the modern criticisms in 1998), has supported the drawings as teaching aids,<ref>\"Haeckel's much-criticized drawings are important as phylogenetic hypotheses, teaching aids, and evidence for evolution.

(2002) '''77''', 495-528 (quote from abstract)</ref> and has said that \"on a fundamental level, Haeckel was correct\"<ref>Letter to ''Science'', '''280''', (15 May 1998), 983-984.</ref>\n\n==Famous embryo illustrators==\n\n===Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919)===\n[[Image:Haeckel drawings.jpg|thumb|250px|Romanes' 1892 copy of [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s allegedly fraudulent embryo drawings (this version of the figure is often attributed incorrectly to Haeckel).<ref>Richardson and Keuck, \"Haeckel\u2019s ABC of evolution and development,\" p. 516</ref>]]\n\nHaeckel's illustrations show vertebrate embryos at different stages of development, which exhibit embryonic resemblance as support for evolution, recapitulation as evidence of the Biogenetic Law, and phenotypic divergence as evidence of [[Karl Ernst von Baer#Baer's laws|von Baer's laws]]. The series of twenty-four embryos from the early editions of Haeckel's ''Anthropogenie'' remain the most famous. The different species are arranged in columns, and the different stages in rows. Similarities can be seen along the first two rows; the appearance of specialized characters in each species can be seen in the columns and a diagonal interpretation leads one to Haeckel's idea of recapitulation.\n\nHaeckel's embryo drawings are primarily intended to express his theory of embryonic development, the Biogenetic Law, which in turn assumes (but is not crucial to) the evolutionary concept of [[common descent]]. His postulation of embryonic development coincides with his understanding of evolution as a developmental process.<ref>Nyhart, ''Biology Takes Form'', pp. 132-133</ref>  In and around 1800, embryology fused with comparative anatomy as the primary foundation of [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]].<ref>Hopwood, \"Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud\", p. 264</ref> Ernst Haeckel, along with Karl von Baer and Wilhelm His, are primarily influential in forming the preliminary foundations of \u2018phylogenetic embryology\u2019 based on principles of evolution.<ref>Richardson and Keuck, \"Haeckel\u2019s ABC of evolution and development,\" p. 497</ref>  Haeckel's \u2018Biogenetic Law\u2019 portrays the parallel relationship between an embryo's development and phylogenetic history.  The term, \u2018recapitulation,\u2019 has come to embody Haeckel's Biogenetic Law, for embryonic development is a recapitulation of evolution.<ref>Nyhart, ''Biology Takes Form'', p. 9</ref>  Haeckel proposes that all classes of vertebrates pass through an evolutionarily conserved \u201c[[Phylotype|phylotypic]]\u201d stage of development, a period of reduced phenotypic diversity among higher embryos.<ref name=\"Keuck p. 506\">Richardson and Keuck, \"Haeckel\u2019s ABC of evolution and development,\" p. 506</ref>  Only in later development do particular differences appear.  Haeckel portrays a concrete demonstration of his Biogenetic Law through his ''[[Gastrea]]'' theory, in which he argues that the early cup-shaped [[gastrula]] stage of development is a universal feature of multi-celled animals.  An ancestral form existed, known as the gastrea, which was a common ancestor to the corresponding gastrula.<ref>Nyhart, ''Biology Takes Form'', p. 159</ref>\n\nHaeckel argues that certain features in embryonic development are conserved and [[Palingenesis|palingenetic]], while others are [[Caenogenesis|caenogenetic]]. Caenogenesis represents \u201cthe blurring of ancestral resemblances in development,\u201d which are said to be the result of certain adaptations to embryonic life due to environmental changes.<ref>Richardson and Keuck, \"Haeckel\u2019s ABC of evolution and development,\" p. 499</ref>  In his drawings, Haeckel cites the [[notochord]], [[Branchial arch|pharyngeal arches]] and clefts, [[pronephros]] and [[neural tube]] as palingenetic features.  However, the [[yolk sac]], extra-embryonic membranes, egg membranes and [[Endocardium|endocardial]] tube are considered caenogenetic features.<ref>Richardson and Keuck, \"Haeckel\u2019s ABC of evolution and development,\" p. 500</ref>  The addition of terminal adult stages and the telescoping, or driving back, of such stages to descendant's embryonic stages are likewise representative of Haeckelian embryonic development.  In addressing his embryo drawings to a general audience, Haeckel does not cite any sources, which gives his opponents the freedom to make assumptions regarding the originality of his work.<ref>Hopwood, \"Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud\", p. 270</ref>\n\n===Karl Ernst von Baer (1792-1876)===\nHaeckel was not the only one to create a series of drawings representing embryonic development.  [[Karl Ernst von Baer|Karl E. von Baer]] and Haeckel both struggled to model one of the most complex problems facing embryologists at the time: the arrangement of general and special characters during development in different species of animals.  In relation to developmental timing, von Baer's scheme of development differs from Haeckel's scheme.  Von Baer's scheme of development need not be tied to developmental stages defined by particular characters, where recapitulation involves [[heterochrony]].  Heterochrony represents a gradual alteration in the original phylogenetic sequence due to embryonic adaptation.<ref>Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, \"Haeckel's ABC of Evolution and Development,\" p. 506</ref>\nAs well, von Baer early noted that embryos of different species could not be easily distinguished from one another as in adults.\n\n[[Karl Ernst von Baer#Baer's laws|Von Baer's laws]] governing embryonic development are specific rejections of recapitulation.<ref name=\"Keuck p. 506\"/>   As a response to Haeckel's theory of recapitulation, von Baer enunciates his most notorious laws of development.  Von Baer's laws state that general features of animals appear earlier in the embryo than special features, where less general features stem from the most general, each embryo of a species departs more and more from a predetermined passage through the stages of other animals, and there is never a complete morphological similarity between an embryo and a lower adult.<ref>Gould, ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'', p. 56</ref>  Von Baer's embryo drawings<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sites.hps.cam.ac.uk/visibleembryos/s3_1.html|title=Histories of development|series=Making Visible Embryos}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|authors=Erki Tammiksaar and Sabine Brauckmann|volume=26|number=3/4|journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences\n|title=Karl Ernst von Baer's '\u00dcber Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere II' and its Unpublished Drawings|year=2004|pages=291\u2013308, 471\u2013474|jstor=23333718}}</ref> display that individual development proceeds from general features of the developing embryo in early stages through differentiation into special features specific to the species, establishing that linear evolution could not occur.<ref>Richards, ''The Meaning of Evolution'', p. 57-59</ref>  Embryological development, in von Baer's mind, is a process of differentiation, \"a movement from the more [[wikt:homogeneous|homogeneous]] and universal to the more [[heterogeneous]] and individual.\"<ref>Richards, ''The Meaning of Evolution'', p. 59-60</ref>\n\nVon Baer argues that embryos will resemble each other before attaining characteristics differentiating them as part of a specific [[family (biology)|family]], [[genus]] or [[species]], but embryos are not the same as the final forms of lower organisms.\n\n===Wilhelm His (1831-1904)===\nWilhelm His was one of Haeckel's most authoritative and primary opponents advocating physiological embryology.<ref>Gould, ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'', p. 189</ref>  His ''Anatomie menschlicher Embryonen'' (Anatomy of human embryos) employs a series of his most important drawings chronicling developing embryos from the end of the second week through the end of the second month of pregnancy.  His, in opposition to Haeckel, seeks to take human embryos out of the hands of Darwinist proponents.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}  In 1878, His begins to engage in serious study of the anatomy of human embryos for his drawings.  During the 19th century, embryologists often obtained early human embryos from abortions and miscarriages, postmortems of pregnant women and collections in anatomical museums.<ref>Hopwood, \"Producing Development\", p. 38</ref>  In order to construct his series of drawings, His collected specimens which he manipulated into a form that he could operate with.\n\nIn His\u2019 ''Normentafel'', he displays specific individual embryos rather than ideal types.<ref>Hopwood, \"Producing Development\", p. 36</ref>   His does not produce norms from aborted specimens, but rather visualizes the embryos in order to make them comparable and specifically subjects his embryo specimens to criticism and comparison with other cases.  Ultimately, His\u2019 critical work in embryonic development comes with his production of a series of embryo drawings of increasing length and degree of development.<ref>Hopwood, \"Producing Development\", p. 50</ref>  His\u2019 depiction of embryological development strongly differs from Haeckel's depiction, for His argues that the phylogenetic explanation of ontogenetic events is unnecessary.  His argues that all ontogenetic events are the \u201cmechanical\u201d result of differential cell growth.<ref>Di Gregorio, ''From Here to Eternity'', p. 277</ref>  His\u2019 embryology is not explained in terms of ancestral history.\n\nThe debate between Haeckel and His ultimately becomes fueled by the description of an embryo that [[Wilhelm Krause (anatomist)|Wilhelm Krause]] propels directly into the ongoing feud between Haeckel and His.  Haeckel speculates that the [[allantois]] is formed in a similar way in both humans and other mammals.  His, on the other hand, accuses Haeckel of altering and playing with the facts.  Although Haeckel is proven right about the allantois, the utilization of Krause's embryo as justification turns out to be problematic, for the embryo is that of a bird rather than a human.  The underlying debate between Haeckel and His derives from differing viewpoints regarding the similarity or dissimilarity of vertebrate embryos.  In response to Haeckel's evolutionary claim that all vertebrates are essentially identical in the first month of embryonic life as proof of common descent, His responds by insisting that a more skilled observer would recognize even sooner that early embryos can be distinguished.  His also counteracts Haeckel's sequence of drawings in the ''Anthropogenie'' with what he refers to as \u201cexact\u201d drawings, highlighting specific differences.  Ultimately, His goes so far as to accuse Haeckel of \u201cfaking\u201d his embryo illustrations to make the vertebrate embryos appear more similar than in reality.  His also accuses Haeckel of creating early human embryos that he conjured in his imagination rather than obtained through [[empirical]] observation.  His completes his denunciation of Haeckel by pronouncing that Haeckel had \u201c\u2018relinquished the right to count as an equal in the company of serious researchers.\u2019\u201d<ref>Hopwood, \"Producing Development\", p. 61</ref>\n\n==Opposition to Haeckel==\nHaeckel encountered numerous oppositions to his artistic depictions of embryonic development during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Haeckel\u2019s opponents believe that he de-emphasizes the differences between early embryonic stages in order to make the similarities between embryos of different species more pronounced.<ref name=\"Hopwood p. 282\">Hopwood, \"Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud\", p. 282</ref>\n\n===Early opponents: Ludwig Rutimeyer, Theodor Bischoff and Rudolf Virchow===\nThe first suggestion of fakery against Haeckel was made in late 1868 by Ludwig Rutimeyer in the ''Archiv f\u00fcr Anthropogenie''.<ref name=\"Hopwood p. 282\"/>  Rutimeyer was a professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the [[University of Basel]], who rejected natural selection as simply mechanistic and proposed an anti-materialist view of nature.  Rutimeyer claimed that Haeckel \u201chad taken to kinds of liberty with established truth.\u201d<ref>Hopwood, \"Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud\", p. 283</ref>  Rutimeyer claimed that Haeckel presented the same image three consecutive times as the embryo of the dog, the chicken, and the turtle.<ref>Hopwood, \"Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud\", p. 275</ref>\n\n[[Theodor Ludwig Wilhelm Bischoff|Theodor Bischoff]] (1807\u20131882), was a strong opponent of [[Darwinism]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  As a pioneer in mammalian embryology, he was one of Haeckel's strongest critics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Although Bischoff's 1840 surveys depict how similar the early embryos of man are to other vertebrates, he later demanded that such [[hasty generalization]] was inconsistent with his recent findings regarding the dissimilarity between hamster embryos and those of rabbits and dogs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Nevertheless, Bischoff's main argument was in reference to Haeckel's drawings of human embryos, for Haeckel is later accused of miscopying the dog embryo from him.<ref name=\"Hopwood p. 282\"/> Throughout Haeckel's time, criticism of his embryo drawings was often due in part to his critics' belief in his representations of embryological development as \u201ccrude schemata.\u201d<ref>Hopwood, \"Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud\", p. 273</ref>\n\n===Contemporary criticism of Haeckel: Michael Richardson and Stephen Jay Gould===\nMichael Richardson and his colleagues in a July 1997 issue of ''Anatomy and Embryology'',<ref>Richardson, M.K., Hanken, J., Gooneratne, M.L., Pieau, C., Raynaud. A., Selwood, L. and Wright, G.M. (1997): There is no highly conserved embryonic stage in the vertebrates: implications for current theories of evolution and development. Anatomy and Embryology 196(2): 91-106.</ref> demonstrated that Haeckel falsified his drawings in order to exaggerate the similarity of the phylotypic stage.\nIn a March 2000 issue of ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'', Stephen Jay Gould argued that Haeckel \"exaggerated the similarities by idealizations and omissions.\" As well, Gould argued that Haeckel's drawings are simply inaccurate and falsified.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|title=Abscheulich! - Atrocious! - the precursor to the theory of natural selection\n|author=Stephen Jay Gould\n|date=March 2000\n|journal=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]\n}}</ref>  On the other hand, one of those who criticized Haeckel's drawings, Michael Richardson, has argued that \"Haeckel's much-criticized drawings are important as phylogenetic hypotheses, teaching aids, and evidence for evolution\".<ref>Richardson and Keuck, \"Haeckel's ABC of evolution and development\", ''Biol.

(2002) '''77''', 495-528</ref>\nBut even Richardson admitted in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' Magazine in 1997 that his team's investigation of Haeckel's drawings were showing them to be \"one of the most famous fakes in biology.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pennisi, Elizabeth|title=Haeckel's Embryos: Fraud Rediscovered|year=1997|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.277.5331.1435a}}</ref>\n\nSome version of Haeckel's drawings can be found in many modern biology textbooks in discussions of the history of embryology, with clarification that these are no longer considered valid .<ref>Futuyma, Douglas, \"Evolutionary Biology,\" p. 652-653</ref>\n\n==Haeckel's proponents (past and present)==\nAlthough Charles Darwin accepted Haeckel's support for natural selection, he was tentative in using Haeckel's ideas in his writings; with regard to embryology, Darwin relied far more on von Baer's work.  Haeckel's work was published in 1866 and 1874, years after Darwin's \"The Origin of Species\" (1859).\n\nDespite the numerous oppositions, Haeckel has influenced many disciplines in science in his drive to integrate such disciplines of taxonomy and embryology into the Darwinian framework and to investigate phylogenetic reconstruction through his Biogenetic Law.  As well, Haeckel served as a mentor to many important scientists, including [[Anton Dohrn]], [[Richard Hertwig|Richard]] and [[Oscar Hertwig]], [[Wilhelm Roux]], and [[Hans Driesch]].<ref>Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, \"Haeckel's ABC of evolution and development,\" p. 496</ref>\n\nOne of Haeckel's earliest proponents was [[Carl Gegenbaur]] at the University of Jena (1865\u20131873), during which both men were absorbing the impact of Darwin's theory.  The two quickly sought to integrate their knowledge into an evolutionary program.  In determining the relationships between \"phylogenetic linkages\" and \"evolutionary laws of form,\" both Gegenbaur and Haeckel relied on a method of comparison.<ref>Nyhart, Lynn K., ''Biology Takes Form'', p. 150</ref>  As Gegenbaur argued, the task of comparative anatomy lies in explaining the form and organization of the animal body in order to provide evidence for the continuity and evolution of a series of organs in the body.  Haeckel then provided a means of pursuing this aim with his biogenetic law, in which he proposed to compare an individual's various stages of development with its ancestral line.  Although Haeckel stressed comparative embryology and Gegenbaur promoted the comparison of adult structures, both believed that the two methods could work in conjunction to produce the goal of evolutionary morphology.<ref>Nyhart, Lynn K., ''Biology Takes Form'', p. 153</ref>\n\nThe philologist and anthropologist, [[Max M\u00fcller|Friedrich M\u00fcller]], used Haeckel's concepts as a source for his ethnological research, involving the systematic comparison of the folklore, beliefs and practices of different societies.  M\u00fcller's work relies specifically on theoretical assumptions that are very similar to Haeckel's and reflects the German practice to maintain strong connections between empirical research and the philosophical framework of science.  Language is particularly important, for it establishes a bridge between natural science and philosophy.<ref>Di Gregorio, Mario A., ''From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith'', p. 253</ref>  For Haeckel, language specifically represented the concept that all phenomena of human development relate to the laws of biology.<ref>Di Gregorio, Mario A., ''From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith'', p. 252</ref>  Although M\u00fcller did not specifically have an influence in advocating Haeckel's embryo drawings, both shared a common understanding of development from lower to higher forms, for M\u00fcller specifically saw humans as the last link in an endless chain of evolutionary development.<ref>Di Gregorio, Mario A., ''From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith'', p. 254</ref>\n\nModern acceptance of Haeckel's Biogenetic Law, despite current rejection of Haeckelian views, finds support in the certain degree of parallelism between ontogeny and phylogeny.  A. M. Khazen, on the one hand, states that \"ontogeny is obliged to repeat the main stages of phylogeny.\"<ref name=\"Richardson, Michael K p. 501\">Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, \"Haeckel's ABC of Evolution and Development,\" p. 501</ref>  A. S. Rautian, on the other hand, argues that the reproduction of ancestral patterns of development is a key aspect of certain biological systems.  Dr. Rolf Siewing acknowledges the similarity of embryos in different species, along with the laws of von Baer, but does not believe that one should compare embryos with adult stages of development.<ref name=\"Richardson, Michael K p. 501\"/>  According to M. S. Fischer, reconsideration of the Biogenetic Law is possible as a result of two fundamental innovations in biology since Haeckel's time: [[cladistics]] and developmental genetics.<ref>Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, \"Haeckel's ABC of Evolution and Development,\" p. 502</ref>\n\nIn defense of Haeckel's embryo drawings, the principal argument is that of \"schematisation.\"<ref name=\"Richardson, Michael K p. 519\">Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, \"Haeckel's ABC of Evolution and Development,\" p. 519</ref>  Haeckel's drawings were not intended to be technical and scientific depictions, but rather schematic drawings and reconstructions for a specifically lay audience.<ref name=\"Richardson, Michael K p. 519\"/>  Therefore, as R. Gursch argues, Haeckel's embryo drawings should be regarded as \"reconstructions.\"  Although his drawings are open to criticism, his drawings should not be considered falsifications of any sort.  Although modern defense of Haeckel's embryo drawings still considers the inaccuracy of his drawings, charges of fraud are considered unreasonable.  As [[Erland Nordenski\u00f6ld]] argues, charges of fraud against Haeckel are unnecessary.  R. Bender ultimately goes so far as to reject His's claims regarding the fabrication of certain stages of development in Haeckel's drawings, arguing that Haeckel's embryo drawings are faithful representations of real stages of embryonic development in comparison to published embryos.<ref>Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, \"Haeckel's ABC of Evolution and Development,\" p. 520</ref>\n\n==The survival and reproduction of Haeckel's embryo drawings==\nHaeckel's embryo drawings, as comparative plates, were at first only copied into biology textbooks, rather than texts on the study of embryology.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Even though Haeckel's program in comparative embryology virtually collapsed after the First World War,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} his embryo drawings have often been reproduced and redrawn with increased precision and accuracy in works that have kept the study of [[comparative embryology]] alive.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Nevertheless, neither His-inspired human embryology nor developmental biology are concerned with the comparison of vertebrate embryos.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Although Stephen Jay Gould's 1977 book ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'' helps to reassess Haeckelian embryology, it does not address the controversy over Haeckel's embryo drawings.

It is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] quantity.\n\nEnthalpy is the preferred expression of system energy changes in many chemical, biological, and physical measurements at constant pressure, because it simplifies the description of [[energy transfer]]. At constant pressure, the enthalpy change equals the energy transferred from the environment through heating or work other than expansion work.\n\nThe total enthalpy, ''H'', of a system cannot be measured directly. The same situation exists in classical mechanics: only a change or difference in energy carries physical meaning. Enthalpy itself is a thermodynamic potential, so in order to measure the enthalpy of a system, we must refer to a defined reference point; therefore what we measure is the change in enthalpy, \u0394''H''. The \u0394''H'' is a positive change in [[endothermic]] reactions, and negative in heat-releasing [[exothermic]] processes.\n\n'''For processes under constant pressure''', \u0394''H'' is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system, plus the [[Work (thermodynamics)#Pressure-volume work|pressure-volume work]] p \u0394V done by the system on its surroundings (which is > 0 for an expansion and < 0 for a contraction).<ref>{{cite book|first1=G.

Enthalpies for chemical substances at constant pressure usually refer to [[standard state]]: most commonly 1 bar pressure. Standard state does not, strictly speaking, specify a temperature (see [[standard state]]), but expressions for enthalpy generally reference the standard heat of formation at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nEnthalpy of [[ideal gas]]es and incompressible solids and liquids does not depend on pressure, unlike [[entropy]] and [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs energy]]. Real materials at common temperatures and pressures usually closely approximate this behavior, which greatly simplifies enthalpy calculation and use in practical designs and analyses.\n\n==History==\nThe word ''enthalpy'' was coined relatively late, in the early 20th century, in analogy with the 19th-century terms ''[[energy]]'' (introduced in its modern sense by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1802) and ''[[entropy]]'' (coined in analogy to ''energy'' by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1865).\nIt uses the root of Greek {{lang|grc|\u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2}} \"warmth, heat\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=qa%2Flpos&la=greek&can=qa%2Flpos0&prior=qalpno/s#lexicon \u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2] in ''[[A Greek\u2013English Lexicon]]''.</ref> \nwhere ''energy'' has {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd}} \"work\" and ''entropy'' {{lang|grc|\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae}} \"transformation\", by analogy expressing the idea of \"heat-content\" where energy refers to \"work-content\" and entropy to \"transformation-content\".\nThe term does in fact stand in for the older term \"heat content\",<ref>Howard (2002) quotes [[J.

This means that, for homogeneous systems, the enthalpy is proportional to the size of the system. It is convenient to introduce the [[specific enthalpy]] ''h''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|''H''|''m''}}, where ''m'' is the mass of the system, or the molar enthalpy ''H''<sub>m</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|''H''|''n''}}, where ''n'' is the number of moles (''h'' and ''H''<sub>m</sub> are [[intensive properties]]). For inhomogeneous systems the enthalpy is the sum of the enthalpies of the composing subsystems:\n\n:<math>H = \\sum_k H_k,</math>\n\nwhere the label ''k'' refers to the various subsystems. In case of continuously varying ''p'', ''T'' or composition, the summation becomes an integral:\n\n:<math>H = \\int \\rho h \\, dV,</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c1'' is the density.\n\nThe enthalpy of homogeneous systems can be viewed as function ''H''(''S'',''p'') of the entropy ''S'' and the pressure ''p'', and a differential relation for it can be derived as follows. We start from the [[first law of thermodynamics]] for closed systems for an infinitesimal process:\n\n:<math>dU = \\delta Q - \\delta W.</math>\n\nHere, ''\u03b4Q''  is a small amount of heat added to the system, and ''\u03b4W'' a small amount of work performed by the system. In a homogeneous system only reversible processes can take place, so the [[second law of thermodynamics]] gives {{nowrap|''\u03b4Q'' {{=}} ''T&thinsp;dS''}}, with ''T'' the [[absolute temperature]] of the system. Furthermore, if only ''pV'' work is done, {{nowrap|1=''\u03b4W'' = ''p&thinsp;dV''}}. As a result,\n\n:<math>dU = T\\,dS - p\\,dV.</math>\n\nAdding ''d''(''pV'') to both sides of this expression gives\n\n:<math>dU + d(pV) = T\\,dS - p\\,dV + d(pV),</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>d(U + pV) = T\\,dS + V\\,dp.</math>\n\nSo\n\n:<math>dH(S,p) = T\\,dS + V\\,dp.</math>\n\n==Other expressions==\nThe above expression of ''dH'' in terms of entropy and pressure may be unfamiliar to some readers.

The differential statement for ''dH'' then becomes\n\n:<math>dH = T\\,dS + V\\,dp + \\sum_i \\mu_i\\,dN_i,</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03bc''<sub>''i''</sub> is the chemical potential per particle for an ''i''-type particle, and ''N''<sub>''i''</sub> is the number of such particles. The last term can also be written as {{nowrap|''\u03bc<sub>i</sub>''&thinsp;''dn''<sub>''i''</sub>}} (with ''dn''<sub>''i''</sub> the number of moles of component ''i'' added to the system and, in this case, ''\u03bc''<sub>''i''</sub> the molar chemical potential) or as {{nowrap|''\u03bc''<sub>''i''</sub>&thinsp;''dm''<sub>''i''</sub>}} (with ''dm''<sub>''i''</sub> the mass of component ''i'' added to the system and, in this case, ''\u03bc''<sub>''i''</sub> the specific chemical potential).\n\n==Physical interpretation==\nThe ''U'' term can be interpreted as the energy required to create the system, and the ''pV'' term as the [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] that would be required to \"make room\" for the system if the pressure of the environment remained constant. When a system, for example, ''n'' [[Mole (unit)|moles]] of a gas of [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] ''V'' at [[pressure]] ''p'' and [[temperature]] ''T'', is created or brought to its present state from [[absolute zero]], energy must be supplied equal to its internal energy ''U'' plus ''pV'', where ''pV'' is the [[Work (physics)|work]] done in pushing against the ambient (atmospheric) pressure.\n\nIn basic [[physics]] and [[statistical mechanics]] it may be more interesting to study the internal properties of the system and therefore the internal energy is used.<ref>{{cite book|first=F. |last=Reif |title=Statistical Physics |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=London |date=1967}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first1=C. |last1=Kittel |first2=H. |last2=Kroemer |title=Thermal Physics |publisher=Freeman |location=London |date=1980}}</ref> In basic [[chemistry]], experiments are often conducted at constant [[atmospheric pressure]], and the pressure-volume work represents an energy exchange with the atmosphere that cannot be accessed or controlled, so that \u0394''H'' is the expression chosen for the [[heat of reaction]].\n\nFor a [[heat engine]] a change in its internal energy is the difference between the heat input and the [[Work (thermodynamics)#Pressure-volume work|pressure-volume work]] done by the working substance while a change in its enthalpy is the difference between the heat input and the work done by the engine:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Theoretische Physik|last=Bartelmann|first=Matthias|publisher=Springer Spektrum|year=2015|isbn=978-3-642-54617-4|location=|pages=1106\u20131108|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n:<math>dH=\\delta Q-\\delta W</math> \nwhere the work W done by the engine is: \n:<math>W=-\\oint pdV</math>\n\n== Relationship to heat ==\nIn order to discuss the relation between the enthalpy increase and heat supply, we return to the first law for closed systems: {{nowrap|1=''dU'' = ''\u03b4Q'' \u2212 ''\u03b4W''}}. We apply it to the special case with a uniform pressure at the surface. In this case the work term can be split into two contributions, the so-called ''pV'' work, given by {{nowrap|''p&thinsp;dV''}} (where here ''p'' is the pressure at the surface, ''dV'' is the increase of the volume of the system) and all other types of work ''\u03b4W\u2032'', such as by a shaft or by electromagnetic interaction. So we write {{nowrap|1=''\u03b4W'' = ''p&thinsp;dV'' + ''\u03b4W\u2032''}}. In this case the first law reads:\n\n:<math>dU = \\delta Q - p\\,dV - \\delta W',</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>dH = \\delta Q + V\\,dp - \\delta W'.</math>\n\nFrom this relation we see that the increase in enthalpy of a system is equal to the added [[heat]]:\n\n:<math>dH = \\delta Q,</math>\n\nprovided that the system is under [[isobaric system|constant pressure]] (''dp''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0) and that the only work done by the system is expansion work (''\u03b4W'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ebbing|first1=Darrel|last2=Gammon|first2=Steven|title=General Chemistry|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2010|isbn=978-0-538-49752-7|page=231|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_7iGj4QLR4C&pg=PA231|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114033110/http://books.google.com/books?id=8_7iGj4QLR4C&pg=PA231|archivedate=2013-11-14|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nIn thermodynamics, one can calculate enthalpy by determining the requirements for creating a system from \"nothingness\"; the mechanical work required, ''pV'', differs based upon the conditions that obtain during the creation of the [[thermodynamic system]].\n\n[[Energy]] must be supplied to remove particles from the surroundings to make space for the creation of the system, assuming that the pressure ''p'' remains constant; this is the ''pV'' term. The supplied energy must also provide the change in internal energy, ''U'', which includes [[activation energy|activation energies]], ionization energies, mixing energies, vaporization energies, chemical bond energies, and so forth. Together, these constitute the change in the enthalpy ''U''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''pV''. For systems at constant pressure, with no external work done other than the ''pV'' work, the change in enthalpy is the heat received by the system.\n\nFor a simple system, with a constant number of particles, the difference in enthalpy is the maximum amount of thermal energy derivable from a thermodynamic process in which the pressure is held constant.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rathakrishnan|title=High Enthalpy Gas Dynamics|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Singapore Pte.

In a similar manner, for an [[endothermic]] reaction, the system's change in enthalpy is equal to the energy ''absorbed'' in the reaction, including the energy ''lost by'' the system and ''gained'' from compression from its surroundings. If \u0394''H'' is positive, the reaction is endothermic, that is heat is absorbed by the system due to the products of the reaction having a greater enthalpy than the reactants.  On the other hand, if \u0394''H'' is negative, the reaction is exothermic, that is the overall decrease in enthalpy is achieved by the generation of heat.<ref>{{cite book|first=Keith J. |last=Laidler |first2=John H.|last2=Meiser|date=1982 |title=Physical Chemistry |page=53 |isbn=978-0-8053-5682-3 |publisher=Benjamin/Cummings}}</ref>\n\nFrom the definition of enthalpy as <math>H = U + pV,</math> the enthalpy change at constant pressure <math>\\Delta H = \\Delta U + p \\Delta V.</math> However for most chemical reactions, the work term <math>p \\Delta V</math> is much smaller than the internal energy change <math>\\Delta U</math> which is approximately equal to <math>\\Delta H.</math>  As an example, for the combustion of carbon monoxide 2 CO(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) \u2192 2 CO<sub>2</sub>(g), <math>\\Delta H</math> = \u2013566.0 kJ and <math>\\Delta U</math> = \u2013563.5 kJ.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ralph H. |last=Petrucci |first2=William S.|last2=Harwood |first3=F.

It is the difference between the enthalpy after the process has completed, i.e. the enthalpy of the [[Product (chemistry)|products]], and the initial enthalpy of the system, i.e. the reactants. These processes are reversible{{why|date=March 2015}} and the enthalpy for the reverse process is the negative value of the forward change.\n\nA common standard enthalpy change is the [[enthalpy of formation]], which has been determined for a large number of substances. Enthalpy changes are routinely measured and compiled in chemical and physical reference works, such as the [[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]]. The following is a selection of enthalpy changes commonly recognized in thermodynamics.\n\nWhen used in these recognized terms the qualifier ''change'' is usually dropped and the property is simply termed ''enthalpy of 'process'''. Since these properties are often used as reference values it is very common to quote them for a standardized set of environmental parameters, or [[standard conditions]], including: \n* A [[temperature]] of 25&nbsp;\u00b0C or 298.15&nbsp;K,\n* A [[pressure]] of one atmosphere (1&nbsp;atm or 101.325&nbsp;kPa),\n* A [[concentration]] of 1.0&nbsp;M when the element or compound is present in solution,\n* Elements or compounds in their normal physical states, i.e. [[standard state]].\nFor such standardized values the name of the enthalpy is commonly prefixed with the term ''standard'', e.g. ''standard enthalpy of formation''.\n\nChemical properties:\n* [[Enthalpy of reaction]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of substance reacts completely.\n* [[Enthalpy of formation]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a compound is formed from its elementary antecedents.\n* [[Enthalpy of combustion]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a substance burns completely with oxygen.\n* [[Enthalpy of hydrogenation]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of an unsaturated compound reacts completely with an excess of hydrogen to form a saturated compound.\n* [[Enthalpy of atomization]], defined as the enthalpy change required to atomize one mole of compound completely.\n*[[Enthalpy of neutralization]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of water is formed when an acid and a base react.\n* Standard [[Enthalpy of solution]], defined as the enthalpy change observed in a constituent of a thermodynamic system when one mole of a solute is dissolved completely in an excess of solvent, so that the solution is at infinite dilution.\n* Standard enthalpy of [[Denaturation (biochemistry)]], defined as the enthalpy change required to denature one mole of compound.\n* [[Hydration energy|Enthalpy of hydration]], defined as the enthalpy change observed when one mole of gaseous ions are completely dissolved in water forming one mole of aqueous ions.\n\nPhysical properties:\n* [[Enthalpy of fusion]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between solid and liquid states.\n* [[Enthalpy of vaporization]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between liquid and gaseous states.\n* [[Enthalpy of sublimation]], defined as the enthalpy change required to completely change the state of one mole of substance between solid and gaseous states.\n* [[Lattice enthalpy]], defined as the energy required to separate one mole of an ionic compound into separated gaseous ions to an infinite distance apart (meaning no force of attraction).\n* [[Enthalpy of mixing]], defined as the enthalpy change upon mixing of two (non-reacting) chemical substances.\n\n===Open systems===\nIn [[thermodynamic]] [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]], matter may flow in and out of the system boundaries. The first law of thermodynamics for open systems states: The increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by matter flowing in and by heating, minus the amount lost by matter flowing out and in the form of work done by the system:\n\n:<math>dU = \\delta Q + dU_\\text{in} - dU_\\text{out} - \\delta W,</math>\n\nwhere ''U''<sub>in</sub> is the average internal energy entering the system, and ''U''<sub>out</sub> is the average internal energy leaving the system.\n\n[[Image:First law open system.svg|250px|thumb|right|During [[Steady-state (chemical engineering)|steady, continuous]] operation, an energy balance applied to an open system equates shaft work performed by the system to heat added plus net enthalpy added]]\n\nThe region of space enclosed by the boundaries of the open system is usually called a [[control volume]], and it may or may not correspond to physical walls.  If we choose the shape of the control volume such that all flow in or out occurs perpendicular to its surface, then the flow of matter into the system performs work as if it were a piston of fluid pushing mass into the system, and the system performs work on the flow of matter out as if it were driving a piston of fluid.  There are then two types of work performed: ''flow work'' described above, which is performed on the fluid (this is also often called ''pV work''), and ''shaft work'', which may be performed on some mechanical device.\n\nThese two types of work are expressed in the equation\n\n: <math>\\delta W = d(p_\\text{out}V_\\text{out}) - d(p_\\text{in}V_\\text{in}) + \\delta W_\\text{shaft}.</math>\n\nSubstitution into the equation above for the control volume (cv) yields:\n\n: <math>dU_\\text{cv} = \\delta Q + dU_\\text{in} + d(p_\\text{in}V_\\text{in}) - dU_\\text{out} - d(p_\\text{out}V_\\text{out}) - \\delta W_\\text{shaft}.</math>\n\nThe definition of enthalpy, ''H'', permits us to use this [[thermodynamic potential]] to account for both internal energy and ''pV'' work in fluids for open systems:\n\n: <math>dU_\\text{cv} = \\delta Q + dH_\\text{in} - dH_\\text{out} - \\delta W_\\text{shaft}.</math>\n\nIf we allow also the system boundary to move (e.g. due to moving pistons), we get a rather general form of the first law for open systems.<ref>{{cite book|first1=M. J. |last1=Moran |first2=H. N. |last2=Shapiro |title=Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics |edition=5th |date=2006 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=129}}</ref> In terms of time derivatives it reads:\n\n: <math>\\frac{dU}{dt} = \\sum_k \\dot Q_k + \\sum_k \\dot H_k - \\sum_k p_k\\frac{dV_k}{dt} - P,</math>\n\nwith sums over the various places ''k'' where heat is supplied, matter flows into the system, and boundaries are moving. The ''\u1e22<sub>k</sub>'' terms represent enthalpy flows, which can be written as\n\n:<math>\\dot H_k = h_k\\dot m_k = H_m\\dot n_k,</math>\n\nwith ''\u1e41<sub>k</sub>'' the mass flow and ''\u1e45<sub>k</sub>'' the molar flow at position ''k'' respectively. The term {{sfrac|''dV''<sub>''k''</sub>|''dt''}} represents the rate of change of the system volume at position ''k'' that results in ''pV'' power done by the system. The parameter ''P'' represents all other forms of power done by the system such as shaft power, but it can also be e.g. electric power produced by an electrical power plant.\n\nNote that the previous expression holds true only if the kinetic energy flow rate is conserved between system inlet and outlet.{{clarify|reason=This new type of energy, kinetic energy, was not mentioned before. Is it part of U? Does it need to be conserved, or just the net flow across boundary be zero?|date=March 2015}} Otherwise, it has to be included in the enthalpy balance. During [[Steady-state (chemical engineering)|steady-state]] operation of a device (''see [[turbine]], [[pump]], and [[engine]]''), the average {{sfrac|''dU''|''dt''}} may be set equal to zero. This yields a useful expression for the average [[Power (physics)|power]] generation for these devices in the absence of chemical reactions:\n\n:<math> P = \\sum_k \\left\\langle \\dot Q_k \\right\\rangle\n+ \\sum_k \\left\\langle \\dot H_k \\right\\rangle\n- \\sum_k \\left\\langle p_k\\frac{dV_k}{dt} \\right\\rangle,</math>\n\nwhere the [[angle bracket]]s denote time averages. The technical importance of the enthalpy is directly related to its presence in the first law for open systems, as formulated above.\n\n==Diagrams==\n[[File:Ts diagram of N2 02.jpg|500px|thumb|right|''T''\u2013''s'' diagram of nitrogen.<ref>Figure composed with data obtained with RefProp, NIST Standard Reference Database 23.</ref> The red curve at the left is the melting curve. The red dome represents the two-phase region with the low-entropy side the saturated liquid and the high-entropy side the saturated gas. The black curves give the ''T''\u2013''s'' relation along isobars. The pressures are indicated in bar. The blue curves are isenthalps (curves of constant enthalpy). The values are indicated in blue in kJ/kg. The specific points '''a''', '''b''', etc., are treated in the main text.]]\n\nThe enthalpy values of important substances can be obtained using commercial software. Practically all relevant material properties can be obtained either in tabular or in graphical form. There are many types of diagrams, such as ''h''\u2013''T'' diagrams, which give the specific enthalpy as function of temperature for various pressures, and ''h''\u2013''p'' diagrams, which give ''h'' as function of ''p'' for various ''T''. One of the most common diagrams is the temperature\u2013specific entropy diagram (''T''\u2013''s''-diagram). It gives the melting curve and saturated liquid and vapor values together with isobars and isenthalps. These diagrams are powerful tools in the hands of the thermal engineer.\n\n===Some basic applications===\nThe points '''a''' through '''h''' in the figure play a role in the discussion in this section.\n:'''a''': ''T'' = 300&nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 6.85&nbsp;kJ/(kg&nbsp;K), ''h'' = 461&nbsp;kJ/kg;\n:'''b''': ''T'' = 380&nbsp;K, ''p'' = 2&nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 6.85&nbsp;kJ/(kg&nbsp;K), ''h'' = 530&nbsp;kJ/kg;\n:'''c''': ''T'' = 300&nbsp;K, ''p'' = 200&nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 5.16&nbsp;kJ/(kg&nbsp;K), ''h'' = 430&nbsp;kJ/kg;\n:'''d''': ''T'' = 270&nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 6.79&nbsp;kJ/(kg&nbsp;K), ''h'' = 430&nbsp;kJ/kg;\n:'''e''': ''T'' = 108&nbsp;K, ''p'' = 13&nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 3.55&nbsp;kJ/(kg&nbsp;K), ''h'' = 100&nbsp;kJ/kg (saturated liquid at 13&nbsp;bar);\n:'''f''': ''T'' = 77.2&nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 3.75&nbsp;kJ/(kg&nbsp;K), ''h'' = 100&nbsp;kJ/kg;\n:'''g''': ''T'' = 77.2&nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 2.83&nbsp;kJ/(kg&nbsp;K), ''h'' = 28&nbsp;kJ/kg (saturated liquid at 1&nbsp;bar);\n:'''h''': ''T'' = 77.2&nbsp;K, ''p'' = 1&nbsp;bar, ''s'' = 5.41&nbsp;kJ/(kg&nbsp;K), ''h'' = 230&nbsp;kJ/kg (saturated gas at 1&nbsp;bar);\n\n===Throttling===\n{{main|Joule\u2013Thomson effect}}\n[[File:Schematic of throttling.png|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of a throttling in the steady state. Fluid enters the system (dotted rectangle) at point 1 and leaves it at point 2. The mass flow is ''\u1e41''.]]\n\nOne of the simple applications of the concept of enthalpy is the so-called throttling process, also known as [[Joule\u2013Thomson effect|Joule-Thomson expansion]]. It concerns a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance (valve, porous plug, or any other type of flow resistance) as shown in the figure. This process is very important, since it is at the heart of domestic refrigerators, where it is responsible for the temperature drop between ambient temperature and the interior of the refrigerator. It is also the final stage in many types of liquefiers.\n\nFor a steady state flow regime, the enthalpy of the system (dotted rectangle) has to be constant. Hence\n\n:<math>0 = \\dot m h_1 - \\dot m h_2.</math>\n\nSince the mass flow is constant, the specific enthalpies at the two sides of the flow resistance are the same:\n\n:<math>h_1 = h_2,</math>\n\nthat is, the enthalpy per unit mass does not change during the throttling. The consequences of this relation can be demonstrated using the ''T''\u2013''s'' diagram above. Point '''c''' is at 200&nbsp;bar and room temperature (300&nbsp;K). A Joule\u2013Thomson expansion from 200&nbsp;bar to 1&nbsp;bar follows a curve of constant enthalpy of roughly 425&nbsp;kJ/kg (not shown in the diagram) lying between the 400 and 450&nbsp;kJ/kg isenthalps and ends in point '''d''', which is at a temperature of about 270&nbsp;K. Hence the expansion from 200&nbsp;bar to 1&nbsp;bar cools nitrogen from 300&nbsp;K to 270&nbsp;K. In the valve, there is a lot of friction, and a lot of entropy is produced, but still the final temperature is below the starting value!\n\nPoint '''e''' is chosen so that it is on the saturated liquid line with {{nowrap|1=''h'' = 100 kJ/kg}}. It corresponds roughly with {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 13 bar}} and {{nowrap|1=''T'' = 108 K}}. Throttling from this point to a pressure of 1&nbsp;bar ends in the two-phase region (point '''f'''). This means that a mixture of gas and liquid leaves the throttling valve. Since the enthalpy is an extensive parameter, the enthalpy in '''f''' (''h''<sub>'''f'''</sub>) is equal to the enthalpy in '''g''' (''h''<sub>'''g'''</sub>) multiplied by the liquid fraction in '''f''' (''x''<sub>'''f'''</sub>) plus the enthalpy in '''h''' (''h''<sub>'''h'''</sub>) multiplied by the gas fraction in '''f''' {{nowrap|(1 \u2212 ''x''<sub>'''f'''</sub>)}}. So\n\n:<math> h_\\mathbf{f} = x_\\mathbf{f} h_\\mathbf{g} + (1 - x_\\mathbf{f})h_\\mathbf{h}.</math>\n\nWith numbers: {{nowrap|1=100 = ''x''<sub>'''f'''</sub> \u00d7 28 + (1 \u2212 ''x''<sub>'''f'''</sub>) \u00d7 230}}, so ''x''<sub>'''f'''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.64. This means that the mass fraction of the liquid in the liquid\u2013gas mixture that leaves the throttling valve is 64%.\n\n===Compressors===\n{{main|Gas compressor}}\n[[File:Schematic of compressor.png|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of a compressor in the steady state. Fluid enters the system (dotted rectangle) at point 1 and leaves it at point 2. The mass flow is ''\u1e41''. A power ''P'' is applied and a heat flow ''Q\u0307'' is released to the surroundings at ambient temperature ''T''<sub>a</sub>.]]\n\nA power ''P'' is applied e.g. as electrical power. If the compression is [[adiabatic]], the gas temperature goes up. In the reversible case it would be at constant entropy, which corresponds with a vertical line in the ''T''\u2013''s'' diagram. For example, compressing nitrogen from 1 bar (point '''a''') to 2 bar (point '''b''') would result in a temperature increase from 300 K to 380 K. In order to let the compressed gas exit at ambient temperature ''T''<sub>a</sub>, heat exchange, e.g. by cooling water, is necessary. In the ideal case the compression is isothermal. The average heat flow to the surroundings is ''Q\u0307''. Since the system is in the steady state the first law gives\n\n:<math>0 = -\\dot Q + \\dot m h_1 - \\dot m h_2 + P.</math>\n\nThe minimal power needed for the compression is realized if the compression is reversible. In that case the [[second law of thermodynamics]] for open systems gives\n\n:<math>0 = -\\frac{\\dot Q}{T_\\mathrm{a}} + \\dot m s_1 - \\dot m s_2.</math>\n\nEliminating ''Q\u0307'' gives for the minimal power\n\n:<math>\\frac{P_\\text{min}}{\\dot m} = h_2 - h_1 - T_\\mathrm{a}(s_2 - s_1).</math>\n\nFor example, compressing 1&nbsp;kg of nitrogen from 1&nbsp;bar to 200&nbsp;bar costs at least {{nowrap|1=(''h''<sub>'''c'''</sub> \u2212 ''h''<sub>'''a'''</sub>) \u2212 ''T''<sub>a</sub>(''s''<sub>'''c'''</sub> \u2212 ''s''<sub>'''a'''</sub>)}}. With the data, obtained with the ''T''\u2013''s'' diagram, we find a value of {{nowrap|1=(430 \u2212 461) \u2212 300 \u00d7 (5.16 \u2212 6.85) =}} 476&nbsp;kJ/kg.\n\nThe relation for the power can be further simplified by writing it as\n\n:<math>\\frac{P_\\text{min}}{\\dot m} = \\int_1^2(dh - T_\\mathrm{a}\\,ds).</math>\n\nWith {{nowrap|1=''dh'' = ''T''&thinsp;''ds'' + ''v''&thinsp;''dp''}}, this results in the final relation\n\n:<math>\\frac{P_\\text{min}}{\\dot m} = \\int_1^2 v\\,dp.</math>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Standard enthalpy change of formation (data table)]]\n* [[Calorimetry]]\n* [[Calorimeter]]\n* [[Departure function]]\n* [[Hess's law]]\n* [[Isenthalpic process]]\n* [[Stagnation enthalpy]]\n* [[Thermodynamic databases for pure substances]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite journal|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/DL/publications/PU00013601.pdf |first=J.P. |last=Dalton |title=Researches on the Joule\u2013Kelvin effect, especially at low temperatures.

He occasionally adopted Anglicized pseudonyms, such as '''Dan Savio''' and '''Leo Nichols'''.\n\nIn 1959, Morricone was the conductor (and uncredited co-composer) for [[Mario Nascimbene]]'s score to ''Morte Di Un Amico'' (Death of a Friend), an Italian drama directed by [[Franco Rossi (director)|Franco Rossi]]. In the same year, he composed music for the theatre show ''Il Lieto Fine'' by [[Luciano Salce]].\n\nThe 1960s began on a positive note: 1961 marked in fact his real film debut with Luciano Salce's ''[[The Fascist|Il Federale (The Fascist)]]''. In an interview with American composer [[Fred Karlin]], Morricone discussed his beginnings, stating, ''My first films were light comedies or costume movies that required simple musical scores that were easily created, a genre that I never completely abandoned even when I went on to much more important films with major directors''.<ref name=\"Biography of Ennio Morricone\">{{cite web|url=http://ennio-morricone.com/#/biography.html|title= Biography of Ennio Morricone|publisher=ennio-morricone.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-22}}</ref>\n\n''Il Federale'' marked the beginning of a long-run collaboration with Luciano Salce. In 1962 Morricone composed the jazz-influenced score for Salce's comedy ''[[Crazy Desire|La voglia matta (Crazy Desire)]]''.

Perhaps the most famous of these is their album entitled ''The Feed-back'', which combines [[free jazz]] and avant-garde classical music with [[funk]]; the album is frequently sampled by [[hip hop]] DJs and is considered to be one of the most collectable records in existence, often fetching over $1,000 at auction.<ref>Alvin Lucia, liner notes, ''Niente''.

During the sixties and seventies he composed the scores for comedies such as ''[[Eighteen in the Sun|Diciottenni al sole]]'' (1962), ''[[Il Successo]]'' (1963), [[Lina Wertm\u00fcller]]'s ''[[I basilischi]]'' (1963),<ref name=\"Biography of Ennio Morricone\"/> ''[[Slalom (film)|Slalom]]'' (1965), ''[[Menage all'italiana]]'' (1965), ''[[How I Learned to Love Women]]'' (1966), ''[[Her Harem|L'harem]]'' (1967), ''[[A Fine Pair]]'' (1968), ''[[Alibi (1969 film)|L'Alibi]]'' (1969), ''[[This Kind of Love (film)|Questa specie d'amore]]'' (1972), ''[[Winged Devils|Forza \"G\"]]'' (1972) and ''[[Fiorina la vacca]]'' (1972).\n\nHis best-known scores for comedies includes ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' (1978) and ''[[La Cage aux Folles II]]'' (1980), both directed by [[\u00c9douard Molinaro]], ''[[Il ladrone]]'' (1980), [[Georges Lautner]]'s ''[[La Cage aux Folles 3: The Wedding]]'' (1985), [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]]'s ''[[Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!]]'' (1990) and Warren Beatty's ''Bulworth'' (1998). Morricone has never ceased to arrange and write music for comedies. In 2007, he composed a lighthearted score for the Italian romantic comedy ''Tutte le Donne della mia Vita'' by Simona Izzo, the director who co-wrote the Morricone-scored religious mini-series ''Il Papa Buono''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Nick Vivarelli International Correspondent @NickVivarelli |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/morricone-i-can-do-anything-1117959621/ |title=Morricone: 'I can do anything' |publisher=Variety.com |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref>\n\n==== Westerns ====\nThough his first films were undistinguished, Morricone's arrangement of an American folk song intrigued director and former schoolmate Sergio Leone. Before being associated with Leone, Morricone had already composed some music for less-known western movies such as ''[[Duello nel Texas]]'' (aka ''Gunfight at Red Sands'') (1963). In 1962, Morricone met American folksinger [[Peter Tevis]], who is credited with singing the lyrics of Morricone's songs such as \"A Gringo Like Me\" (from ''Gunfight at Red Sands'') and \"Lonesome Billy\" (from ''Bullets Don't Argue'').<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=z9Tjh55dlDUC&pg=PA147#v=onepage&q=morricone%20first%20western%20films Christopher Frayling, ''Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone''], I. B. Tauris, 2 April 2006.</ref>\n\n===== Association with Sergio Leone =====\n\nThe turning point in Morricone's career took place in 1964, the year in which his third child, [[Andrea Morricone]], who would also become a film composer, was born. Film director Sergio Leone hired Morricone, and together they created a distinctive score to accompany Leone's [[Spaghetti Western|different version]] of the [[Western (genre)|Western]], ''A Fistful of Dollars'' (1964).\n\n'''The ''Dollars'' trilogy'''\n{{main|The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (soundtrack)}}\n\nBecause budget strictures limited Morricone's access to a full orchestra, he used gunshots, cracking whips, whistle, voices, [[jew's harp]], trumpets, and the new Fender electric guitar, instead of orchestral arrangements of Western standards \u00e0 la [[John Ford]]. Morricone used his special effects to punctuate and comically tweak the action\u2014cluing in the audience to the [[silence|taciturn]] man's ironic stance. Though sonically bizarre for a movie score, Morricone's music was [[wikt:viscerally|viscerally]] true to Leone's vision.\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Ennio_Morricone-The_Good,_The_Bad_And_The_Ugly.ogg\n|title=The Good, The Bad and The Ugly main theme\n|description=From [[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]] film score\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nAs memorable as Leone's [[close-up]]s, harsh violence, and black comedy, Morricone's work helped to expand the musical possibilities of film scoring. Morricone was initially billed on the film as Dan Savio. ''A Fistful of Dollars'' came out in Italy in 1964 and was released in America three years later, greatly popularizing the so-called [[Spaghetti Western]] genre. For the American release, Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone decided to adopt American-sounding names, so they called themselves respectively Bob Robertson and Dan Savio. Over the film's theatrical release, it grossed more than any other Italian film up to that point.<ref name=\"Hughes7\">Hughes, p. 7.</ref> The film debuted in the United States in January 1967, where it grossed {{USD|4.5&nbsp;million|link=yes}} for the year.<ref name=\"Hughes7\"/> It eventually grossed $14.5&nbsp;million in its American release,<ref name=\"Hughes7\"/> against its budget of {{USD}}200\u2013250,000.<ref name=\"Hughes4\">Hughes, p. 4.</ref><ref name=\"Munn48\">Munn, p. 48.</ref>\n\nWith the score of ''A Fistful of Dollars'', Morricone began his 20-year collaboration with his childhood friend [[Alessandro Alessandroni]] and his Cantori Moderni.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Ennio-Morricone-Bianco-Rosso-E-Morricone-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtracks-From-Un-Sacco-Bello-Bia/release/3609543 Ennio Morricone Bianco, Rosso E Morricone \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtracks From \"Un Sacco Bello\" & \"Bianco, Rosso E Verdone\"], retrieved 28 January 2013</ref> Alessandroni provided the whistling and the twanging guitar on the film scores, while his Cantori Moderni were a flexible troupe of modern singers. Morricone specifically exploited the solo [[soprano]] of the group, [[Edda Dell'Orso]], at the height of her powers \"an extraordinary voice at my disposal\".\n\nThe composer subsequently scored Leone's other two ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' (or ''[[Man with No Name|Man With No Name Trilogy]]'') spaghetti westerns: ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' (1965) and ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' (1966). All three films starred the American actor [[Clint Eastwood]] as ''The Man With No Name'' and depicted Leone's own intense vision of the mythical West. Some of the music was written before the film, which was unusual. Leone's films were made like that because he wanted the music to be an important part of it; he kept the scenes longer because he did not want the music to end. According to Morricone this explains why the films are so slow.\n\nDespite the small film budgets, the ''Dollars Trilogy'' was a box-office success. The available budget for ''The Good, the Bad and The Ugly'' was about {{USD}}1.2&nbsp;million, but it became the most successful film of the ''Dollars Trilogy'', grossing {{USD}}25.1&nbsp;million in the United States and over 2,3&nbsp;billion [[Italian lira|lire]] (1,2&nbsp;million EUR) in Italy alone. Morricone's score became a major success and sold over three million copies worldwide. On 14 August 1968 the original score was certified by the [[RIAA]] with a golden record for the sale of 500,000 copies in the United States only.<ref>[https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database RIAA, Gold and Platinum \u2013 The Good, the Bad & the Ugly], Retrieved 24 January 2013  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5z4wMKGT4?url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database |date=30 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe main theme of ''For a Few Dollars More'' (\"[[For a Few Dollars More#Music|Per Qualche Dollaro in Pi\u00f9]]\") was covered by [[Hugo Montenegro]] (\"For a Few Dollars More\"),<ref>{{cite web|title = Hugo Montenegro And His Orchestra \u2013 Music From 'A Fistful of Dollars', 'For A Few Dollars More' & 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly'|url = http://www.discogs.com/Hugo-Montenegro-And-His-Orchestra-Music-From-A-Fistful-Of-Dollars-For-A-Few-Dollars-More-The-GoodBad/master/107581|website = Discogs|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref> [[Babe Ruth (band)|Babe Ruth]] (\"Theme From a Few Dollars More\"),<ref>{{cite web|title = Babe Ruth \u2013 Wells Fargo / Theme From \"For A Few Dollars More\"|url = http://www.discogs.com/Babe-Ruth-Wells-Fargo-Theme-From-For-A-Few-Dollars-More/release/3355344|website = Discogs|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref> [[The Golden Palominos|Golden Palominos]] (\"For A Few Dollars More\"),<ref>{{cite web|title = Golden Palominos, The \u2013 Omaha|url = http://www.discogs.com/Golden-Palominos-Omaha/release/835660|website = Discogs|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref> [[Material (band)|Material]] (\"For a Few Dollars More\"),<ref>{{cite web|title = Material \u2013 For A Few Dollars More|url = http://www.discogs.com/Material-For-A-Few-Dollars-More/master/9753|website = Discogs|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref> and Matti Heinivaho (\"Arosusi\").<ref>{{cite web|title = Matti Heinivaho \u2013 Arosusi / Tarzan|url = http://www.discogs.com/Matti-Heinivaho-Arosusi-Tarzan/release/2442322|website = Discogs|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref> More recently, a [[Techno-Industrial]] cover was done by [[Sebastian Komor#as Komor Kommando|Komor Kommando]] (\"Hasta Luego\").

Most of Morricone's film scores of the 1960s were composed outside the Spaghetti Western genre, while still using Alessandroni's team. Their music included the themes for ''Il Malamondo'' (1964), ''Slalom'' (1965) and ''Listen, Let's Make Love'' (1967). In 1968, Morricone reduced his work outside the movie business and wrote scores for 20 films in the same year. The scores included psychedelic accompaniment for [[Mario Bava]]'s superhero romp ''[[Danger: Diabolik]]'' (1968).\n[[File:Ennio Morricone Cannes 2007.jpg|left|Morricone in 2007|thumb|150px]]\nHis talent and creativity were such that many other directors were soon keen to collaborate with him, and in the next few years Morricone scored a lot of films by politically committed directors: collaborating with [[Marco Bellocchio]] (''[[Fists in the Pocket]]'', 1965), [[Gillo Pontecorvo]] (''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'' (1966) and ''[[Burn! (1969 film)|Queimada!]]'' (1969) with [[Marlon Brando]]), [[Roberto Faenza]] (H2S, 1968), Giuliano Montaldo (''[[Sacco e Vanzetti (1971 film)|Sacco e Vanzetti]]'', 1971), [[Giuseppe Patroni Griffi]] (''[['Tis Pity She's a Whore (film)|'Tis Pity She's a Whore]]'', 1971), Mauro Bolognini (''[[Drama of the Rich]]'', 1974), [[Umberto Lenzi]] (''[[Almost Human (1974 film)|Almost Human]]'', 1974), [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] (''[[Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'', 1975), Bernardo Bertolucci (''[[1900 (film)|Novecento]]'', 1976) and [[Tinto Brass]] (''[[The Key (1983 film)|The Key]]'', 1983).\n\nIn 1970, Morricone wrote the score for ''Violent City''. That same year, he received his first [[Nastro d'Argento]] for the music in ''[[Metti, una sera a cena]]'' ([[Giuseppe Patroni Griffi]], 1969) and his second only a year later for ''[[Sacco e Vanzetti (1971 film)|Sacco e Vanzetti]]'' (Giuliano Montaldo, 1971), in which he had made a memorable collaboration with the legendary American folk singer and activist [[Joan Baez]]. His soundtrack for ''Sacco e Vanzetti'' contains another well-known composition by Morricone, the folk song \"[[Here's to You (song)|Here's to You]]\", sung by [[Joan Baez]]. For the writing of the lyrics, Baez was inspired by a letter from Bartolomeo Vanzetti: ''\"Father, yes, I am a prisoner / Fear not to relay my crime\"''.

The American release gave Morricone an exposure in America and his film music became quite popular in the United States.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=G2lqIuCFJ_MC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q=days%20of%20heaven%20terrence%20malick%20ennio%20morricone ''Ennio Morricone's The Good, The Bad And The Ugly: A Film Score Guide''], Charles Leinberger, Scarecrow Press, 1 September 2004</ref>\n\nOne of Morricone's first contributions to an American director concerned his music for the religious epic film ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning...]]'' by [[John Huston]]. According to Sergio Miceli's book ''Morricone, la musica, il cinema'', Morricone wrote about 15 or 16&nbsp;minutes of music, which were recorded for a screen test and conducted by [[Franco Ferrara]]. At first Morricone's teacher [[Goffredo Petrassi]] had been engaged to write the score for the great big budget epic, but Huston preferred another composer. [[RCA Records]] then proposed Morricone who was under contract with them, but a conflict between the film's producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and RCA occurred. The producer wanted to have the exclusive rights for the soundtrack, while RCA still had the monopoly on Morricone at that time and did not want to release the composer. Subsequently, Morricone's work was rejected because he did not get the ok by RCA to work for Dino De Laurentiis alone. The composer reused the parts of his unused score for ''The Bible: In the Beginning'' in such films as ''[[The Return of Ringo]]'' (1965) by [[Duccio Tessari]] and Alberto Negrin's ''[[The Secret of the Sahara]]'' (1987).\n\nMorricone never left Rome to compose his music and never learned to speak English. But given that the composer has always worked in a wide field of composition genres, from absolute music, which he has always produced, to applied music, working as orchestrator as well as conductor in the recording field, and then as a composer for theatre, radio and cinema, the impression arises that he never really cared that much about his standing in the eyes of Hollywood.<ref>[http://thequietus.com/articles/04050-ennio-morricone-interview-a-fistful-of-dollars-for-a-few-dollars-more-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-once-upon-a-time-in-the-west-the-thing Ennio Morricone Interviewed: John Doran, \"Compared To Bach, I'm Practically Unemployed\"], Quietus interview, 8 April 2010.</ref>\n\n====1970\u20131985: from ''Two Mules'' to ''Red Sonja''====\n\nIn 1970, Morricone composed the music for [[Don Siegel]]'s ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'', an American-Mexican western film starring [[Shirley MacLaine]] and Clint Eastwood.

Two years later he composed the score for the sequel to [[William Friedkin]]'s 1973 film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', directed by [[John Boorman]]: ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]''. The horror film was a major disappointment at the box office.

The same year he scored the [[Dino De Laurentiis]] produced adventure film ''[[Orca (film)|Orca]]'', starring [[Richard Harris]], which was also only a minor hit but later developed a cult following.\n\nIn 1978, the composer worked with [[Terrence Malick]] for ''[[Days of Heaven]]'', starring [[Richard Gere]]. During the lengthy editing process of the romantic drama, which won an [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]] with an additional three nominations for the score, Terrence Malick and Billy Weber made use of a temporary score dominated by Morricone's music for the Bernardo Bertolucci film ''Novecento''. Malick also chose the ethereal Aquarium music from [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]] (\"[[The Carnival of the Animals]]\") to frame the film. When Malick decided he wanted Morricone to score his movie, the director sent a version of it to Italy with the Novecento temp track in place. Morricone agreed to the assignment and Malick flew to Italy because the composer did not fly, so would not travel to the United States. Malick took the movie over to Morricone in Italy and Morricone was writing for ''Days of Heaven'' the whole time. Afterwards they scored the music in Italy. In ''Days of Heaven'', Morricone's elegiac music coexists with pre-existing selections.\n\nDespite the fact that Morricone had produced some of the most popular and widely imitated film music ever written throughout the 1960s and '70s, ''Days of Heaven'' earned him his first [[Academy Awards|Oscar nomination]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], with his score up against [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s ''[[The Boys from Brazil (film)|The Boys from Brazil]]'', [[Dave Grusin]]'s ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'', [[Giorgio Moroder]]'s ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'' (the eventual winner) and [[John Williams]]'s ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'' at the [[51st Academy Awards|Oscar ceremonies]] in 1979.<ref name=\"Oscars1979\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1979 |title=The 51st Academy Awards (1979) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-10-06 |work=oscars.org |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DRWJTeY1?url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/51st-winners.html |archivedate=5 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, Morricone provided the music for the thriller ''[[Bloodline (1979 film)|Bloodline]]'', directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], best known for directing the [[James Bond]] films ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962), ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' (1963), and ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965).

Morricone received a [[BAFTA]] award with his son [[Andrea Morricone|Andrea]], and a [[David di Donatello]] for his score. In 2002, the [[director's cut]] 173-minute version was released (known in the U.S. as '''''Cinema Paradiso: The New Version''''').\n\nAfter the success of ''Cinema Paradiso'', the composer wrote the music for all subsequent films by Tornatore: the drama film ''[[Everybody's Fine (1990 film)|Everybody's Fine]]'' (Stanno Tutti Bene, 1990), ''[[A Pure Formality]]'' (1994) starring [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] and Roman Polanski, ''[[The Star Maker (1995 film)|The Star Maker]]'' (1995), ''[[The Legend of 1900]]'' (1998) starring [[Tim Roth]], the 2000 romantic drama ''[[Mal\u00e8na (soundtrack)|Mal\u00e8na]]'' (which featured [[Monica Bellucci]]) and the psychological thriller mystery film ''[[La sconosciuta]]'' (2006).\n\nMore recently, Morricone composed the scores for ''[[Baar\u00eca - La porta del vento]]'' (2009), ''[[The Best Offer]]'' (2013) starring [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Jim Sturgess]] and [[Donald Sutherland]] and the romantic drama ''[[The Correspondence]]'' (2015) starring [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Olga Kurylenko]].\n\nThe composer won several music awards for his scores to Tornatore's movies. So, Morricone received a fifth Academy Award nomination and a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for ''Mal\u00e8na''. For ''Legend of 1900'', he won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]].\n\n=== Television series and recent works ===\nMorricone has worked for television, from a single title piece to variety shows and documentaries to TV series, including ''[[Moses the Lawgiver]]'' (1974), ''[[The Life and Times of David Lloyd George]]'' (1981), ''[[Marco Polo (miniseries)|Marco Polo]]'' (1982) (which won two Primetime Emmys), ''[[The Secret of the Sahara]]'' (1987), [[The Betrothed (miniseries)|I Promessi Sposi]] and ''[[Nostromo]]'' (1996).\n\nHe wrote the score for [[the Mafia]] television series ''[[La piovra]]'' seasons 2 to 10 from 1985 to 2001, including the themes \"Droga e sangue\" (\"Drugs and Blood\"), \"La Morale\", and \"L'Immorale\". Morricone worked as the conductor of seasons 3 to 5 of the series. He also worked as the music supervisor for the television project ''La bibbia'' (\"The Bible\").\n\nIn the late 1990s, he collaborated with his son Andrea on the ''Ultimo'' crime dramas, resulting in ''Ultimo'' (1998), ''Ultimo 2 \u2013 La sfida'' (1999), ''Ultimo 3 \u2013 L'infiltrato'' (2004) and ''Ultimo 4 \u2013 L'occhio del falco'' (2013).\n\nIn the 2000s, Morricone continued to compose music for successful television series such as ''[[Il Cuore nel Pozzo]]'' (2005), ''[[Karol: A Man Who Became Pope]]'' (2005), ''La provinciale'' (2006), ''[[Giovanni Falcone]]'' (2007), ''Pane e libert\u00e0'' (2009) and ''Come Un Delfino 1\u20132'' (2011\u20132013).\n\nWith an estimated 13 million viewers, ''[[Karol: A Man Who Became Pope]]'' became an incredible success. Morricone wrote additional music for the sequel, ''[[Karol: The Pope, The Man]]'' (2006), which portrayed Karol's life as Pope from his [[papal inauguration]] to his death. Both scores were originally released respectively in 2005 and 2006. One year later, a double disc album with both scores is released.\n\nIn 2003, Morricone scored another epic, for Japanese television, called ''Musashi'' and was the [[Taiga drama]] about [[Miyamoto Musashi]], Japan's legendary [[warrior]]. A part of his \"applied music\" is now applied to Italian television films.\n\nMorricone provided the string arrangements on Morrissey's \"Dear God Please Help Me\" from the album ''[[Ringleader of the Tormentors]]'' in 2006.<ref>Goddard, S. ''Mozipedia'', p. 272. London: Ebury Press, 2009.</ref>\n\nSince 2004, Morricone wrote music for almost exclusively Italian television movies and mini-series, especially for directors such as Giuseppe Tornatore, [[Alberto Negrin]], [[Giuliano Montaldo]], and Franza Di Rosa.\n\nIn 2008, the composer recorded music for a [[Lancia]] commercial, featuring [[Richard Gere]] and directed by [[Harald Zwart]] (known for directing ''[[The Pink Panther 2]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mixonline.com/post/features/interview-film-music-maestro-ennio-morricone//index.html|title=Interview: Film Music Maestro Ennio Morricone|date=1 October 2008|accessdate=31 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108022353/http://mixonline.com/post/features/interview-film-music-maestro-ennio-morricone/|archivedate=8 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nTarantino originally wanted Morricone to compose the soundtrack for his film, ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]''.

Rather than single pieces, which would require the audience to applaud every few minutes, Morricone thought the best idea was to create a series of suites lasting from 15 to 20 minutes, which form a sort of [[symphony]] in various [[Movement (music)|movements]] \u2013 alternating successful pieces with personal favorites.

On 2 March 2012 he conducted the [[Adelaide Symphony Orchestra]] at Elder Park, [[Adelaide]] as part of the [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]].\n\nOn 22 December 2012 Morricone conducted the 85-piece Belgian orchestra \"Orkest der Lage Landen\" and a 100-piece choir during a two-hour concert in the [[Sportpaleis]] in Antwerp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://focus.knack.be/entertainment/film/filmnieuws/ennio-morricone-komt-dirigeren-in-sportpaleis/article-4000167056971.htm |title=Ennio Morricone komt dirigeren in Sportpaleis, 24 August 2012 |publisher=Focus.knack.be |date=17 June 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2013 Morricone began a world tour to coincide with the 50th anniversary of his film music career and performed in locations such as the [[Crocus City Hall]] in Moscow, [[Santiago, Chile]], Berlin, Germany (O2 World), Budapest, Hungary, and Vienna (Stadhalle).

A single [[cord circuit]] has the capacity to be used for 60 minutes in one hour. Full utilization of that capacity, 60 minutes of traffic, constitutes 1 erlang.<ref>{{cite book | title = Fundamentals of Telecommunications | page = 57 | first = Roger L. | last = Freeman | publisher = John Wiley | year = 2005 | isbn = 0471710458}}</ref> \n\n<!--Traffic measurements of a telephone circuit-->Carried traffic in erlangs is the average number of concurrent calls measured over a given period (often one hour), while offered traffic is the traffic that would be carried if all call-attempts succeeded. How much offered traffic is carried in practice will depend on what happens to unanswered calls when all servers are busy.\n\n<!--Erlang's analysis-->The [[CCITT]] named the international unit of telephone traffic the erlang in 1946 in honor of [[Agner Krarup Erlang]].<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Erlang}}</ref> In Erlang's analysis of efficient telephone line usage he derived the formulae for two important cases, Erlang-B and Erlang-C, which became foundational results in [[teletraffic engineering]] and [[queueing theory]]. His results, which are still used today, relate quality of service to the number of available servers. <!--Calculating offered traffic-->Both formulae take offered load as one of their main inputs (in erlangs), which is often expressed as call arrival rate times average call length. \n\n<!--Erlang B formula-->A distinguishing assumption behind the Erlang B formula is that there is no queue, so that if all service elements are already in use then a newly arriving call will be blocked and subsequently lost. The formula gives the probability of this occurring. <!--Erlang C formula-->In contrast, the Erlang C formula provides for the possibility of an unlimited queue and it gives the probability that a new call will need to wait in the queue due to all servers being in use. <!--Limitations of the Erlang formulae-->Erlang's formulae apply quite widely, but they may fail when congestion is especially high causing unsuccessful traffic to repeatedly retry. <!--Extended Erlang B-->One way of accounting for retries when no queue is available is the Extended Erlang B method.\n\n==Traffic measurements of a telephone circuit==\nWhen used to represent '''carried traffic''', a value (which can be a non-integer such as 43.5) followed by \u201cerlangs\u201d represents the average number of concurrent calls carried by the circuits (or other service-providing elements), where that average is calculated over some reasonable period of time.  The period over which the average is calculated is often one hour, but shorter periods (e.g., 15 minutes) may be used where it is known that there are short spurts of demand and a traffic measurement is desired that does not mask these spurts.\nOne erlang of carried traffic refers to a single resource being in continuous use, or two channels each being in use fifty percent of the time, and so on.  For example, if an office has two telephone operators who are both busy all the time, that would represent two erlangs (2 E) of traffic; or a radio channel that is occupied continuously during the period of interest (eg. one hour) is said to have a load of 1 erlang.\n\nWhen used to describe '''offered traffic''', a value followed by \u201cerlangs\u201d represents the average number of concurrent calls that would have been carried if there were an unlimited number of circuits (that is, if the call-attempts that were made when all circuits were in use had not been rejected).  The relationship between offered traffic and carried traffic depends on the design of the system and user behavior.  Three common models are (a) callers whose call-attempts are rejected go away and never come back, (b) callers whose call-attempts are rejected try again within a fairly short space of time, and (c) the system allows users to wait in queue until a circuit becomes available.\n\nA third measurement of traffic is '''instantaneous traffic''', expressed as a certain number of erlangs, meaning the exact number of calls taking place at a point in time.  In this case the number is an integer.  Traffic-level-recording devices, such as moving-pen recorders, plot instantaneous traffic.\n\n==Erlang's analysis==\n\nThe concepts and mathematics introduced by [[A. K. Erlang|Agner Krarup Erlang]] have broad applicability beyond telephony.  They apply wherever users arrive more or less at random to receive exclusive service from any one of a group of service-providing elements without prior reservation, for example, where the service-providing elements are ticket-sales windows, toilets on an airplane, or motel rooms.  (Erlang\u2019s models do not apply where the service-providing elements are shared between several concurrent users or different amounts of service are consumed by different users, for instance, on circuits carrying data traffic.)\n\nThe goal of Erlang\u2019s traffic theory is to determine exactly how many service-providing elements should be provided in order to satisfy users, without wasteful over-provisioning.  To do this, a target is set for the [[grade of service]] (GoS) or [[quality of service]] (QoS).  For example, in a system where there is no queuing, the GoS may be that no more than 1 call in 100 is blocked (i.e., rejected) due to all circuits being in use (a GoS of 0.01), which becomes the target probability of call blocking, ''P<sub>b</sub>'', when using the Erlang B formula.\n\nThere are several resulting formulae, including [[Erlang (unit)#Erlang B formula|Erlang B]], [[Erlang (unit)#Erlang C formula|Erlang C]] and the related [[Engset formula]], based on different models of user behavior and system operation. These may each be derived by means of a special case of [[continuous-time Markov process]]es known as a [[birth-death process]]. The more recent [[Erlang (unit)#Extended Erlang B|Extended Erlang B]] method provides a further traffic solution that draws on Erlang's results.\n\n==Calculating offered traffic==\n\nOffered traffic (in erlangs) is related to the '''call arrival rate''', \u03bb, and the '''average call-holding time''' (the average time of a phone call), ''h'', by:\n\n:<math> E = \\lambda h </math>\n\nprovided that ''h'' and \u03bb are expressed using the same units of time (seconds and calls per second, or minutes and calls per minute).\n\nThe practical measurement of traffic is typically based on continuous observations over several days or weeks, during which the instantaneous traffic is recorded at regular, short intervals (such as every few seconds).  These measurements are then used to calculate a single result, most commonly the '''busy hour traffic''' (in erlangs).  This is the average number of concurrent calls during a given one-hour period of the day, where that period is selected to give the highest result. (This result is called the time-consistent busy hour traffic).  An alternative is to calculate a busy hour traffic value separately for each day (which may correspond to slightly different times each day) and take the average of these values. This generally gives a slightly higher value than the time-consistent busy hour value.\n\nWhere the existing busy-hour carried traffic, ''E''<sub>c</sub>, is measured on an already-overloaded system, with a significant level of blocking, it is necessary to take account of the blocked calls in estimating the busy-hour offered traffic ''E''<sub>o</sub> (which is the traffic value to be used in the Erlang formulae). The offered traffic can be estimated by ''E''<sub>o</sub> = ''E''<sub>c</sub>/(1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''P''<sub>b</sub>).  For this purpose, where the system includes a means of counting blocked calls and successful calls, ''P''<sub>b</sub> can be estimated directly from the proportion of calls that are blocked.  Failing that, ''P''<sub>b</sub> can be estimated by using ''E''<sub>c</sub> in place of ''E''<sub>o</sub> in the Erlang formula and the resulting estimate of ''P''<sub>b</sub> can then be used in ''E''<sub>o</sub> = ''E''<sub>c</sub>/(1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''P''<sub>b</sub>) to provide a first estimate of ''E''<sub>o</sub>.\n\nAnother method of estimating ''E''<sub>o</sub> in an overloaded system is to measure the busy-hour call arrival rate, ''\u03bb'' (counting successful calls and blocked calls), and the average call-holding time (for successful calls), ''h'', and then estimate ''E<sub>o</sub>'' using the formula ''E'' = ''\u03bbh''.\n\nFor a situation where the traffic to be handled is completely new traffic, the only choice is to try to model expected user behavior. For example, one could estimate active user population, ''N'', expected level of use, ''U'' (number of calls/transactions per user per day), busy-hour concentration factor, ''C'' (proportion of daily activity that will fall in the busy hour), and average holding time/service time, ''h'' (expressed in minutes).  A projection of busy-hour offered traffic would then be ''E''<sub>o</sub> = (NUC/60)''h'' erlangs.  (The division by 60 translates the busy-hour call/transaction arrival rate into a per-minute value, to match the units in which ''h'' is expressed.)\n\n==Erlang B formula==\nThe '''Erlang B formula''' (or '''Erlang-B''' with a hyphen), also known as the '''Erlang loss formula''', is a formula for the '''blocking probability''' that describes the probability of call losses for a group of identical parallel resources (telephone lines, circuits,  traffic channels, or equivalent), sometimes referred to as an [[M/M/c queue#Finite capacity|M/M/c/c queue]].<ref>{{cite book | isbn = 0120510502 | title = Probability, statistics, and queueing theory : with computer science applications | last1 = Allen | first1 = Arnold | year = 1978 | publisher = Academic Press | location = New York | page = 184}}</ref>  It is, for example, used to dimension a telephone network's links. The formula was derived by [[Agner Krarup Erlang]] and is not limited to telephone networks, since it describes a probability in a queuing system (albeit a special case with a number of servers but no queueing space for incoming calls to wait for a free server). Hence, the formula is also used in certain inventory systems with lost sales.\n\nThe formula applies under the condition that an unsuccessful call, because the line is busy, is not queued or retried, but instead really vanishes forever. It is assumed that call attempts arrive following a [[Poisson process]], so call arrival instants are independent. Further, it is assumed that the message lengths (holding times) are exponentially distributed (Markovian system), although the formula turns out to apply under general holding time distributions.\n\nThe Erlang B formula assumes an infinite population of sources (such as telephone subscribers), which jointly offer traffic to ''N'' servers (such as telephone lines).  The rate expressing the frequency at which new calls arrive, \u03bb, (birth rate, traffic intensity, etc.) is constant, and does ''not'' depend on the number of active sources.  The total number of sources is assumed to be infinite. \nThe Erlang B formula calculates the blocking probability of a buffer-less loss system, where a request that is not served immediately is aborted, causing that no requests become queued.  Blocking occurs when a new request arrives at a time where all available servers are currently busy.  The formula also assumes that blocked traffic is cleared and does not return.\n\nThe formula provides the GoS ([[grade of service]]) which is the probability ''P<sub>b</sub>'' that a new call arriving to the resources group is rejected because all resources (servers, lines, circuits) are busy:  ''B''(''E'', ''m'') where ''E'' is the total offered traffic in erlang, offered to ''m'' identical parallel resources (servers, communication channels, traffic lanes).  \n:<math>P_b = B(E,m) = \\frac{\\frac{E^m}{m!}} { \\sum_{i=0}^m \\frac{E^i}{i!}} </math>\n\nwhere:\n* <math>P_b</math> is the probability of blocking\n* ''m'' is the number of identical parallel resources such as servers, telephone lines, etc.\n* ''E'' = ''\u03bbh'' is the normalised ingress load (offered traffic stated in erlang).\n\nNote: The ''erlang'' is a dimensionless load unit calculated as the mean arrival rate, \u03bb, multiplied by the mean call holding time, ''h''. \nSee [[Little's law]] to prove that the erlang unit has to be dimensionless for Little's Law to be dimensionally sane.\n\nThis may be expressed recursively<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895717703900409 |title=Two common properties of the erlang-B function, erlang-C function, and Engset blocking function |author=Guoping Zeng |date=June 2003 |publisher=Elsevier Science |accessdate=2011-02-03}}</ref> as follows, in a form that is used to simplify the calculation of tables of the Erlang B formula:\n\n:<math>B(E,0) = 1. \\,</math>\n:<math>B(E,j) = \\frac{E B(E,j - 1)}{E B(E,j - 1) + j} \\ \\forall{j} = 1,2,\\ldots,m. </math>\n\nTypically, instead of ''B''(''E'', ''m'') the inverse 1/''B''(''E'', ''m'') is calculated in numerical computation in order to ensure [[numerical stability]]:\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{B(E,0)} = 1</math>\n:<math>\\frac{1}{B(E,j)} = 1 + \\frac{j}{E}\\frac{1}{B(E,j - 1)} \\ \\forall{j} = 1,2,\\ldots,m. </math>\n<source lang=\"vb\">\n Function ErlangB (E As Double, m As Integer) As Double\n Dim InvB As Double\n Dim j As Integer\n \n   InvB = 1.0\n   For j = 1 To m\n     InvB = 1.0 + InvB * j / E \n   Next j\n   ErlangB = 1.0 / InvB\n End Function\n</source>\nThe Erlang B formula is decreasing and [[convex function|convex]] in ''m''.<ref>Messerli, E.J., 1972.

Calculate the probability of a caller being blocked on their first attempt\n:<math>P_b = B(E_k,m)\\,</math>\nas above for Erlang B.\n\n2.

However, if all the servers are busy when a request arrives from a source, the request is queued.  An unlimited number of requests may be held in the queue in this way simultaneously.  This formula calculates the probability of queuing offered traffic, assuming that blocked calls stay in the system until they can be handled.  This formula is used to determine the number of agents or customer service representatives needed to staff a [[call centre]], for a specified desired probability of queuing.  However, the Erlang C formula assumes that callers never hang up while in queue, which makes the formula predict that more agents should be used than are really needed to maintain a desired service level.\n\n:<math>P_w = {{\\frac{E^m}{m!} \\frac{m}{m - E}} \\over \\left ( \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{m-1} \\frac{E^i}{i!} \\right ) + \\frac{E^m}{m!} \\frac{m}{m - E}} \\,</math>\n\nwhere:\n* <math>E</math> is the total traffic offered in units of erlangs\n* <math>m</math> is the number of servers\n* <math>P_w</math> is the probability that a customer has to wait for service.\n\nIt is assumed that the call arrivals can be modeled by a [[Poisson process]] and that call holding times are described by an [[exponential distribution]].\n\n==<span id=\"Limitations\"></span>Limitations of the Erlang formula==\n<!--Redirected from [[High-loss calculation]] using id=\"Limitations\".-->\nWhen Erlang developed the Erlang-B and Erlang-C traffic equations, they were developed on a set of assumptions. These assumptions are accurate under most conditions; however in the event of extremely high traffic congestion, Erlang's equations fail to accurately predict the correct number of circuits required because of re-entrant traffic. This is termed a '''high-loss system''', where congestion breeds further congestion at peak times. In such cases, it is first necessary for many additional circuits to be made available so that the high loss can be alleviated. Once this action has been taken, congestion will return to reasonable levels and Erlang's equations can then be used to determine how exactly many circuits are really required.<ref name=\"Kennedy\">[http://dept.ee.wits.ac.za/~kennedy Kennedy I., School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of the Witwatersrand, Personal Communication]</ref>\n\nAn example of an instance which would cause such a High Loss System to develop would be if a TV-based advertisement were to announce a particular telephone number to call at a specific time. In this case, a large number of people would simultaneously phone the number provided. If the service provider had not catered for this sudden peak demand, extreme traffic congestion will develop and Erlang's equations cannot be used.<ref name=\"Kennedy\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Spectral efficiency#System spectral efficiency|System spectral efficiency]] (discussing cellular network capacity in Erlang/MHz/cell)\n* [[Agner Krarup Erlang|A.

If the pass is received by a non-eligible receiver, it is \"illegal touching\" (five yards and loss of down).

Specifically, any players on offense wearing numbers between 50 and 79 are always ineligible. All defensive players are eligible receivers and offensive players who are not wearing an ineligible number are eligible receivers if they meet one of the following three criteria:\n* Player is at either end of the group of players on the line of scrimmage (usually the [[wide receiver]]s and [[tight end]])\n* Player is lined up at least one yard behind the line of scrimmage ([[running back]]s, [[fullback (American football)|fullback]]s, [[American football positions#Offense|etc.]])\n* Player is positioned to receive a hand-to-hand snap from the center (almost always the [[quarterback]])\n\nPlayers may only wear eligible numbers at an ineligible position when it is obvious that a [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] or [[field goal (American football)|field goal]] is to be attempted.\n\nIf a player is to change between eligible and ineligible positions, they must physically change jersey numbers to reflect the position.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2015/01/watch_baylors_390-pound_linema.html | title=Watch Baylor's 390-pound lineman LaQuon McGowan catch TD pass in Cotton Bowl against Michigan State | publisher=Alabama Media Group | work=AL.com | date=January 1, 2015 | accessdate=February 1, 2015 | author=Stephenson, Creg}}</ref>\n\nA receiver loses his eligibility by leaving the field of play unless he was forced out by a defensive player and immediately attempts to get back inbounds (Rule 7-3-4). All players on the field become eligible as soon as the ball is touched by a defensive player or an official during play (Rule 7-3-5).\n\n==Professional football==\nIn both American and Canadian professional football, every player on the defensive team is considered eligible. The offensive team must have at least seven players lined up on the line of scrimmage. Of the players on the line of scrimmage, only the two players on the ends of the line of scrimmage are eligible receivers.  The remaining players are in the backfield (four in American football, five in Canadian football), including the [[quarterback]].  These backfield players are also eligible receivers.  In the [[National Football League]], a quarterback who takes his stance behind center as a T-formation quarterback is not eligible unless, before the ball is snapped, he legally moves to a position at least one yard behind the line of scrimmage or on the end of the line, and is stationary in that position for at least one second before the snap, but is nonetheless not counted toward the seven men required on the line of scrimmage.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/rulebook/pdfs/11_Rule8_ForwardPass_BackPass_Fumble.pdf | title=Eligible Receivers | publisher=NFL | work=Official NFL Playing Rules | accessdate=May 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIf, for example, eight men line up on the line of scrimmage, the team loses an eligible receiver. This can often happen when a [[Flanker (American football)|flanker]] or [[slot receiver]], who is supposed to line up behind the line of scrimmage, instead lines up on the line of scrimmage between the [[offensive line]] and a [[split end]]. In most cases where a pass is caught by an ineligible receiver, it is usually because the quarterback was under pressure and threw it to an [[offensive lineman]] out of desperation.\n\nIn many leagues eligible receivers must wear certain [[uniform number (American football)|uniform number]]s, so that the [[Official (American football)|officials]] can more easily distinguish between eligible and ineligible receivers. In the NFL running backs must wear numbers 20 to 49, tight ends must wear numbers 80 to 89 (or 40 to 49 if the numbers 80 to 89 have been exhausted), and wide receivers must wear numbers 10 to 19 or 80 to 89. In the CFL ineligible receivers must wear numbers 50 to 69; all other numbers (including 0 and 00) may be worn by eligible receivers. A player who is not wearing a number that corresponds to an eligible receiver is ineligible even if he lines up in an eligible position. However, a player who reports to the [[referee]] that he intends to be eligible in the following play is allowed to line up and act as an eligible receiver. An example of this was a 1985 NFL game in which [[William Perry (American football)|William Perry]], wearing number 72 and normally a defensive lineman, was made an eligible receiver on an offensive play, and successfully caught a touchdown pass attempt. A more recent example, and more commonly used, has been former [[New England Patriots]] [[linebacker]] [[Mike Vrabel]] lining up as a [[tight end]] in goal line situations.\n\nBefore the snap of the ball, in the American game, backfield players may only move parallel to the line of scrimmage, only one back may be in motion at any given time, and if forward motion has occurred, the back must be still for a full second before the snap. The receiver may be in motion laterally or away from the line of scrimmage at the snap. A breach of this rule results in a penalty for [[illegal procedure]] (five yards). However, in the Canadian game, eligible receivers may move in any direction before the snap, any number may be in motion at any one time, and there is no need to be motionless before the snap.\n\nThe rules on eligible receivers only apply to forward passes. Any player may legally catch a backwards or lateral pass. \n\nIn the American game, once the play has started, eligible receivers can become ineligible depending on how the play develops.  Any eligible receiver that goes out of bounds is no longer an eligible receiver and cannot receive a forward pass, unless that player re-establishes by taking three steps in bounds.  Also, if a pass is touched by any defensive player or eligible offensive receiver (tipped by a defensive lineman, slips through a receiver's hands, etc.), every offensive player immediately becomes eligible. In the CFL all players become eligible receivers if a pass is touched by a member of the defensive team.\n\n==High school==\nIn [[high school football]], the rules of eligibility are roughly the same as in the college game. However, as of February 1999, at least five players must wear numbers between 50 and 79 on first, second, or third down, which by rule would make them ineligible receivers. This was because of a change in the definition of a scrimmage-kick formation made by the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS).<ref name=\"hsban\">{{cite press release | url=http://www.nfhs.org/web/2009/02/horsecollar_tackle_to_be_penali.aspx | title=Horse-collar Tackle To Be Penalized in High School Football | publisher=NFHS | date=February 13, 2009 | accessdate=February 1, 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219202557/http://nfhs.org/web/2009/02/horsecollar_tackle_to_be_penali.aspx | archivedate=February 19, 2009 |author=Colgate, Bob}}</ref> The change was intended to close a loophole in the rules which allowed teams to run an [[A-11 offense]], in which a team could legally be exempted from eligibility numbering restrictions if the player receiving the snap was at least seven yards behind the line of scrimmage.<ref name=\"espn\">{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=weinreb/080811&lpos=spotlight&lid=tab4pos1 | title=The A-11 offense: Ridiculous, or genius? | publisher=The Walt Disney Company | work=[[ESPN.com]] [[Page 2]] | date=August 28, 2008 | accessdate=February 1, 2015 | author=Weinreb, Michael | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080903131422/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=weinreb%2F080811&lpos=spotlight&lid=tab4pos1 | archivedate=September 3, 2008 | deadurl=yes | df= }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Glossary of American football]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2007}}\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n{{American football positions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eligible Receiver}}\n[[Category:American football terminology]]\n[[Category:Canadian football terminology]]", "sha1": "6wab5cm5ve9tu20w41wzmyuzqaakxm1"}}, {"title": "Enver Hoxha", "ns": "0", "id": "10286", "revision": {"id": "863104970", "parentid": "862686871", "timestamp": "2018-10-08T19:00:53Z", "contributor": {"username": "TheParliamentofOwls", "id": "33522701"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Grammar and word choice", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{For|the Kosovar Foreign Minister|Enver Hoxhaj}} \n{{pp-move-indef|small=yes}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2015}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| name          = Enver Hoxha\n| image         = HOD\u017dA druh\u00e1 m\u00edza.jpg \n| office2       = [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Albania)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]\n| term_start2   = 22 March 1946\n| term_end2     = 23 July 1953\n| primeminister2= Himself\n| predecessor2  = [[Omer Nishani]]\n| successor2    = [[Behar Shtylla]]\n| office1       = 22nd [[Prime Minister of Albania]]\n| term_start1   = 22 October 1944\n| term_end1     = 19 July 1954\n| president1    = [[Omer Nishani]]<br />[[Haxhi Lleshi]]\n| deputy1       = [[Myslim Peza]]<br />[[Ko\u00e7i Xoxe]]<br />[[Mehmet Shehu]]\n| predecessor1  = [[Ibrahim Bi\u00e7ak\u00e7iu]]\n| successor1    = [[Mehmet Shehu]]\n| office       = [[First Secretary of the Party of Labour of Albania]]\n| term_start   = 8 November 1941\n| term_end     = 11 April 1985\n| predecessor  = Position established\n| successor    = [[Ramiz Alia]]\n| birth_name    = Enver Halil Hoxha\n| birth_date    = {{birth date|1908|10|16|df=yes}}\n| birth_place   = [[Gjirokast\u00ebr|Ergiri (Gjirokast\u00ebr)]], [[Janina Vilayet]], [[Ottoman Empire]]\n| death_date    = {{death date and age|1985|4|11|1908|10|16|df=yes}}\n| death_place   = [[Tirana]], [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]]\n| death_cause   = [[Ventricular fibrillation]]\n| resting_place = People's Cemetery, Tirana, Albania\n| nationality   = Albanian\n| party         = [[Party of Labour of Albania]]\n| spouse        = {{marriage|[[Nexhmije Hoxha|Nexhmije Xhuglini]]|1 January 1945|11 April 1985|end=his death}}\n| children      = {{hlist|[[Ilir Hoxha|Ilir]]|Sokol|Pranvera}}\n| alma_mater    = [[University of Montpellier]]<br />[[Free University of Brussels]]\n| signature     = Signature of Enver Hoxha.png\n}}\n\n'''Enver Halil Hoxha''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|h|\u0254\u02d0|d\u0292|\u0251\u02d0}};<ref>[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hoxha \"Hoxha\"].

He was chairman of the [[Democratic Front of Albania]] and commander-in-chief of the armed forces from 1944 until his death. He served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Albania|22nd]] [[Prime Minister of Albania]] from 1944 to 1954 and at various times served as foreign minister and defence minister as well.\n\nBorn in [[Gjirokast\u00ebr]] in 1908, Hoxha became a teacher in grammar school in 1936. Following Italy's [[Italian invasion of Albania|invasion of Albania]], he entered into the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] at its creation in 1941. Hoxha was elected First Secretary in March 1943 at the age of 34. The [[Yugoslav Partisans]] assisted the Albanians. Less than two years after [[Liberation Day (Albania)|the liberation of the country]], the monarchy was abolished, [[Zog I of Albania|King Zog]] was deposed and Hoxha rose to power as the head of state of Albania.\n\nDuring his 40-year-rule, he focused on rebuilding the country, which was left in ruins after World War II, building Albania's first [[railway line]], raising the adult literacy rate from 5% to 98%, and leading Albania towards becoming agriculturally self-sufficient.<ref>''40 Years of Socialist Albania'', Dhimiter Picani<!-- publishing info, ISSN/ISBN, page(s), year(s) needed --></ref> However, detractors criticize him for a series of [[political repression]]s which included the establishment and use of [[Forced labour camps in Communist Albania|forced labor camps]], [[extrajudicial killing]]s and [[Capital punishment|executions]] that targeted and eliminated [[anti-communism|anti-communists]], a large number of which was carried out by the [[Sigurimi]] [[secret police]].\n\nHoxha's government was characterized by his proclaimed firm adherence to [[anti-revisionism|anti-revisionist]] [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] from the mid-1970s onwards.

The [[Yugoslav Partisans]] had a much more practical role, helping to plan attacks and exchanging supplies, but communication between them and the Albanians was limited and letters would often arrive late, sometimes well after a plan had been agreed upon by the National Liberation Army without consultation from the Yugoslav partisans.\n\nWithin Albania, repeated attempts were made during the war to remedy the communications difficulties which faced partisan groups. In August 1943, a secret meeting, the [[Mukje Conference]], was held between the anti-communist [[Balli Komb\u00ebtar]] (National Front) and the Communist Party of Albania. The result of this was an agreement to:\n\n# Unite in a single struggle against the fascist invader.\n# Cease all attacks between the two parties signing the agreement.\n# Form a joint operational staff to coordinate military actions within Albania.\n# Recognize that the democratically elected national liberations councils are the state power in Albania.\n# Recognize that the goal for the post-war era is an independent, democratic Albania where the people themselves will decide the form of government.\n# Recognize and respect the [[Atlantic Charter]], the London and Washington Treaties between the USSR, Great Britain and the United States in connection with the question of Kosovo and \u00c7am\u00ebria.

After judging the Communists as an immediate threat, the Balli Komb\u00ebtar sided with [[Nazi Germany]], fatally damaging its image among those fighting the Fascists. The Communists quickly added to their ranks many of those disillusioned with the Balli Komb\u00ebtar and took centre stage in the fight for liberation.<ref>{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|pp=10\u20131}}</ref><ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Jacques|1995|pp=491\u2013493}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Partisans in Tirana.jpg|thumb|right|Enver Hoxha following the liberation of Tirana in 1944]]\nThe Permet National Congress held during that time called for a \"new democratic Albania for the people\". Although the monarchy was not formally abolished, King Zog was barred from returning to the country, which further increased the Communists' control. The Anti-Fascist Committee for National Liberation was founded, chaired by Hoxha. On 22 October 1944, the Committee became the [[Democratic Government of Albania]] after a meeting in [[Berat]] and Hoxha was chosen as interim Prime Minister. Tribunals were set up to try alleged war criminals who were designated \"[[enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]\"<ref>{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|p=12}}.</ref> and were presided over by [[Ko\u00e7i Xoxe]].\n\nAfter liberation on 29 November 1944, several Albanian partisan divisions crossed the border into German-occupied Yugoslavia, where they fought alongside Tito's partisans and the Soviet [[Red Army]] in a joint campaign which succeeded in driving out the last pockets of German resistance. Marshal Tito, during a Yugoslavian conference in later years, thanked Hoxha for the assistance that the Albanian partisans had given during the War for National Liberation (''Lufta Nacional\u00e7lirimtare''). The [[Democratic Front of Albania|Democratic Front]], dominated by the Albanian Communist Party, succeeded the National Liberation Front in August 1945 and the first post-war election was the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1945|held on 2 December]]. The Front was the only legal political organisation allowed to stand in the elections, and the government reported that 93% of Albanians voted for it.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Jacques|1995|p=433}}</ref><ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Vickers|1999|p=164}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 January 1946, Zog was officially deposed and Albania was proclaimed the People's Republic of Albania (renamed the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]] in 1976).

During the period of 1945\u20131950, the government adopted policies which were intended to consolidate power. The Agrarian Reform Law was passed in August 1945. It confiscated land from [[beys]] and large landowners, giving it without compensation to peasants. 52% of all land was owned by large landowners before the law was passed; this declined to 16% after the law's passage.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Marmullaku|1975|pp=93\u201394}}</ref> Illiteracy, which was 90\u201395% in rural areas in 1939 went down to 30% by 1950 and by 1985 it was equal to that of a Western country.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+al0059) Library of Congress Country Studies]</ref>\n\nThe [[State University of Tirana]] was established in 1957, which was the first of its kind in Albania. The [[Medieval]] [[Gjakmarrja]] (blood feud) was banned. [[Malaria]], the most widespread disease,<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Gjon\u00e7a|2001|p=15}} \"20.1% of the population was infected.\"</ref> was successfully fought through advances in health care, the use of [[DDT]], and through the draining of swamplands.

[[Albanian Subversion|Guerrilla units entered Albania in 1950 and 1952]], but they were killed or captured by Albanian security forces. [[Kim Philby]], a Soviet double agent working as a liaison officer between the British intelligence service and the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]], had leaked details of the infiltration plan to Moscow, and the security breach claimed the lives of about 300 infiltrators.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Jacques|1995|p=473}}</ref>\n\n=== Relations with Yugoslavia ===\n[[File:Miladin Popovi\u0107 i Enver Hod\u017ea.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Miladin Popovi\u0107]], an unknown partisan, and Enver Hoxha]]\nAt this point, relations with [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] had begun to change. The roots of the change began on 20 October 1944 at the Second Plenary Session of the Communist Party of Albania. The Session considered the problems that the post-independence Albanian government would face. However, the Yugoslav delegation led by Velimir Stoini\u0107 accused the party of \"sectarianism and opportunism\" and blamed Hoxha for these errors. He also stressed the view that the Yugoslav Communist partisans spearheaded the Albanian partisan movement.<ref name=\"O'Donnell, p. 19\">{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|p=19}}.</ref>\n\nAnti-Yugoslav members of the Albanian Communist Party had begun to think that this was a plot by Tito who intended to destabilize the Party. [[Ko\u00e7i Xoxe]], [[Sejfulla Mal\u00ebshova]] and others who supported Yugoslavia were looked upon with deep suspicion. Tito's position on Albania was that it was too weak to stand on its own and that it would do better as a part of Yugoslavia. Hoxha alleged that Tito had made it his goal to get Albania into Yugoslavia, firstly by creating the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and Mutual Aid in 1946. In time, Albania began to feel that the treaty was heavily slanted towards Yugoslav interests, much like the Italian agreements with Albania under Zog that made the nation dependent upon Italy.<ref name=\"O'Donnell, p. 19\" />\n\nThe first issue was that the [[Albanian lek]] became revalued in terms of the [[Yugoslav dinar]] as a [[customs union]] was formed and Albania's economic plan was decided more by Yugoslavia.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Pano|1968|p=101}}</ref> Albanian economists H. Banja and V. To\u00e7i stated that the relationship between Albania and Yugoslavia during this period was exploitative and that it constituted attempts by Yugoslavia to make the Albanian economy an \"appendage\" to the Yugoslav economy.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Banja|To\u00e7i|1979|p=66}} \"...&nbsp;Albania didn't need to create its national industry, but should limit her production to agricultural and mineral raw materials, which were to be sent for industrial processing to Yugoslavia. In other words, they wanted the Albanian economy to be a mere appendage of the Yugoslav economy.\"</ref> Hoxha then began to accuse Yugoslavia of misconduct:\n{{Quote\n| text = We [Albania] were expected to produce for the Yugoslavs all the raw materials which they needed. These raw materials were to be exported to the metropolitan Yugoslavia to be processed there in Yugoslav factories. The same applied to the production of cotton and other industrial crops, as well as oil, bitumen, asphalt, chrome, etc. Yugoslavia would supply its 'colony', Albania, with exorbitantly priced consumer goods, including even items such as needles and thread, and would provide us with petrol and oil, as well as glass for the lamps in which we burn the fuel extracted from our subsoil, processed in Yugoslavia and sold to us at high prices&nbsp;... The aim of the Yugoslavs was, therefore, to prevent our country from developing either its industry or its working class, and to make it forever dependent on Yugoslavia.<ref>Ranko Petkovi\u0107, \"Yugoslavia and Albania,\" in ''Yugoslav-Albanian Relations'', trans.

They tried to do this in a very secretive manner. In reality, their aim in this direction was utterly hostile, for they intended to overturn the situation in Albania.\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1981|p=92}}.</ref> By June 1947, the Central Committee of Yugoslavia began publicly condemning Hoxha, accusing him of talking an individualistic and anti-Marxist line. When Albania responded by making agreements with the Soviet Union to purchase a supply of agricultural machinery, Yugoslavia said that Albania could not enter into any agreements with other countries without Yugoslav approval.<ref name=\"O'Donnell, p. 22\">{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|p=22}}.</ref>\n\n[[Ko\u00e7i Xoxe]] tried to stop Hoxha from improving relations with [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], reasoning that Albania would be more stable with one trading partner rather than with many. [[Nako Spiru]], an anti-Yugoslav member of the Party, condemned Xoxe and vice versa. With no one coming to Spiru's defense, he viewed the situation as hopeless and feared that Yugoslav domination of his nation was imminent, which caused him to commit suicide in November.<ref name=\"O'Donnell, p. 22\" />\n\nAt the Eighth Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party which lasted from 26 February to 8 March 1948, Xoxe was implicated in a plot to isolate Hoxha and consolidate his own power. He accused Hoxha of being responsible for the decline in relations with Yugoslavia and stated that a Soviet military mission should be expelled in favor of a Yugoslav counterpart. Hoxha managed to remain firm and his support had not declined. When Yugoslavia publicly broke with the Soviet Union, Hoxha's support base grew stronger. Then, on 1 July 1948, Tirana called on all Yugoslav technical advisors to leave the country and unilaterally declared all treaties and agreements between the two countries null and void. Xoxe was expelled from the party and on 13 June 1949, he was executed by hanging.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Jacques|1995|p=467}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Relations with the Soviet Union ===\nAfter the break with Yugoslavia, Hoxha aligned himself with the Soviet Union, for which he had a great admiration. From 1948 to 1960, $200 million in Soviet aid was given to Albania for technical and infrastructural expansion. Albania was admitted to the [[Comecon]] on 22 February 1949 and remained important both as a way to pressure Yugoslavia and to serve as a pro-Soviet force in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. A submarine base was built on the island of [[Sazan]] near [[Vlor\u00eb]], posing a possible threat to the [[United States Sixth Fleet]]. Relations remained close until the death of Stalin on 5 March 1953. His death was met with 14 days of national mourning in Albania\u2014more than in the Soviet Union.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fevziu|2016|p=146}}.</ref> Hoxha assembled the entire population in the capital's largest square featuring a statue of Stalin, requested that they kneel, and made them take a two-thousand word oath of \"eternal fidelity\" and \"gratitude\" to their \"beloved father\" and \"great liberator\" to whom the people owed \"everything\".<ref>''The Economist'' 179 (16 June 1956): 110.</ref>\n\nUnder [[Nikita Khrushchev]], Stalin's successor, aid was reduced and Albania was encouraged to adopt Khrushchev's specialization policy. Under this policy, Albania would develop its agricultural output in order to supply the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Warsaw Pact]] nations while these nations would be developing specific resource outputs of their own, which would, in theory, strengthen the Warsaw Pact by greatly reducing the lack of certain resources that many of the nations faced. However, this also meant that Albanian industrial development, which was stressed heavily by Hoxha, would have to be significantly reduced.<ref>On the \"socialist division of labor\" see: [http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=1163 The International Socialist Division of Labor (7 June 1962)], German History in Documents and Images.</ref>\n\n[[File:Partia e Pun\u00ebs e Shqip\u00ebris\u00eb.svg|thumb|Symbol of the Party of Labour of Albania]]\nFrom 16 May to 17 June 1955, [[Nikolai Bulganin]] and [[Anastas Mikoyan]] visited Yugoslavia and Khrushchev renounced the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the Communist bloc. Khrushchev also began making references to [[Palmiro Togliatti]]'s [[wikt:polycentric|polycentrism]] theory. Hoxha had not been consulted on this and was offended. Yugoslavia began asking for Hoxha to rehabilitate the image of [[Ko\u00e7i Xoxe]], which Hoxha steadfastly rejected. In 1956 at the [[Twentieth Party Congress]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], Khrushchev [[Secret Speech|condemned]] the [[Stalin's cult of personality|cult of personality]] that had been built up around [[Joseph Stalin]] and also denounced him for many grave mistakes. Khrushchev then announced the theory of [[peaceful coexistence]], which angered Hoxha greatly. The Institute of Marxist\u2013Leninist Studies, led by Hoxha's wife [[Nexhmije Hoxha|Nexhmije]], quoted [[Vladimir Lenin]]: \"The fundamental principle of the foreign policy of a socialist country and of a Communist party is [[proletarian internationalism]]; not peaceful coexistence.\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|The Institute of Marxist\u2013Leninist Studies at the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania|1982|p=296}}</ref> Hoxha now took a more active stand against perceived [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]].\n\nUnity within the [[Albanian Party of Labour]] began to decline as well, with a special delegate meeting held in Tirana in April 1956, composed of 450 delegates and having unexpected results. The delegates \"criticized the conditions in the party, the negative attitude toward the masses, the absence of party and socialist democracy, the economic policy of the leadership, etc.\" while also calling for discussions on the cult of personality and the Twentieth Party Congress.<ref>{{Harvnb|Griffith|1963|p=22}}</ref>\n\n==== Movement towards China and Maoism ====\n[[File:Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha.jpg|thumb|[[Mao Zedong]] and Hoxha in 1956]]\nIn 1956, Hoxha called for a [[conflict resolution|resolution]] which would uphold the current leadership of the Party. The resolution was accepted, and all of the delegates who had spoken out were expelled from the party and imprisoned. Hoxha stated that this was yet another of many attempts to overthrow the leadership of Albania which had been organized by Yugoslavia. This incident further consolidated Hoxha's power, effectively making Khrushchev-esque reforms nearly impossible. In the same year, Hoxha traveled to the [[People's Republic of China]], which was then enduring the [[Sino-Soviet split]], and met [[Mao Zedong]]. Relations with China improved, as evidenced by Chinese aid to Albania being 4.2% in 1955 before the visit, and rising to 21.6% in 1957.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biberaj|1986|p=27}}.</ref>\n\nIn an effort to keep Albania in the Soviet sphere, increased aid was given but the Albanian leadership continued to move closer towards China. Relations with the Soviet Union remained at the same level until 1960, when Khrushchev met [[Sofoklis Venizelos]], a left-wing Greek politician. Khrushchev sympathized with the concept of an autonomous Greek [[North Epirus]] and he hoped to use Greek claims to keep the Albanian leadership in line with Soviet interests.<ref>{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|p=46}}.</ref> Hoxha reacted by only sending [[Hysni Kapo]], a member of the Albanian Political Bureau, to the Third Congress of the [[Romanian Workers' Party]] in [[Bucharest]], an event that heads of state were normally expected to attend.<ref>{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|pp=46\u201347}}</ref> As relations between the two countries continued to deteriorate in the course of the meeting, Khrushchev said:\n{{Quote\n| text = Especially shameless was the behavior of that agent of Mao Zedong, Enver Hoxha.

After his speech, Comrade [[Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri]] [a Spanish Communist], an old revolutionary and a devoted worker in the Communist movement, got up indignantly and said, very much to the point, that Hoxha was like a dog who bites the hand that feeds it.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Talbott|1970|pp=475\u2013476}}</ref>\n}}\n<!-- [[File:Enver & Mao Tse Dung.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Hoxha and Mao shaking hands in a Chinese Communist propaganda poster]] -->\n\n==== Friction with the Soviet Union ====\nRelations with the Soviet Union began to decline rapidly.

It was to be organized by Soviet-trained Rear Admiral [[Teme Sejko]]. After this, two pro-Soviet members of the Party, [[Liri Belishova]] and [[Ko\u00e7o Tashko]], were expelled, with a humorous incident involving Tashko pronouncing ''[[Wiktionary:\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430#Russian|tochka]]'' (Russian for \"[[full stop]]\").<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1976|pp=109 note 2, 110,\"This ridiculous action of Ko\u00e7o Tashko made it quite evident that the text of his contribution had been dictated by an official of the Soviet Embassy and during the translation he had become confused, failing to distinguish between the text and the punctuation marks.\"}}</ref>\n\nIn August, the Party's Central Committee sent a letter of protest to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, stating its displeasure at having an anti-Albanian Soviet Ambassador in Tirana. The Fourth Congress of the Party, held from 13 to 20 February 1961, was the last meeting that the Soviet Union or other Eastern European nations attended in Albania. During the congress, the Soviet Union was condemned while China was praised. [[Mehmet Shehu]] stated that while many members of the Party were accused of [[tyranny]], this was a baseless charge and unlike the Soviet Union, Albania was led by genuine Marxists.\n\nThe Soviet Union retaliated by threatening \"dire consequences\" if the condemnations were not retracted. Days later, Khrushchev and [[Anton\u00edn Novotn\u00fd]], [[President of Czechoslovakia]] (which was Albania's largest source of aid besides the Soviets), threatened to cut off economic aid. In March, Albania was not invited to attend the meeting of the [[Warsaw Pact]] nations (Albania had been one of its founding members in 1955) and in April all Soviet technicians were withdrawn from the nation. In May nearly all Soviet troops on the [[Orikum]] naval base were withdrawn, leaving the Albanians with 4 submarines and other military equipment.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|The Institute of Marxist\u2013Leninist Studies at the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania|1982|pp=451\u2013474|Chapter 13: The Final Act}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 November 1961, Hoxha made a speech in which he called Khrushchev a \"revisionist, an anti-Marxist and a defeatist\".

Albania was unofficially excluded (by not being invited) from both the [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[Comecon]]. The Soviet Union also attempted to claim control of the [[Vlor\u00eb]] port due to a lease agreement; the Albanian Party then passed a law prohibiting any other nation from owning an Albanian port through lease or otherwise. The [[Soviet\u2013Albanian split]] was now complete.\n\n== Later rule ==\n[[File:Albania bunkers.jpg|thumb|[[Bunkers in Albania]] built during Hoxha's rule to avert the possibility of external invasions.

O'Donnell, ''A Coming of Age: Albania under Enver Hoxha'', Tape recording, Tirana, 12 April 1994.</ref> The Party honored him with titles such as Supreme Comrade, Sole Force and Great Teacher.\n\nHoxha's governance was also distinguished by his encouragement of a high birthrate policy.

The caption at the bottom reads, \"Long live the great union between the Parties of Albania and China!\" Despite what the painting may suggest, the two leaders met only twice\u2014first in 1956 during Hoxha's visit to China, and again in 1957 at the Moscow meeting of communist and workers' parties\u2014before the Sino-Albanian alliance.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hoxha|1980b|pp=231-234, 240-250, \"My First and Last Visit to China\"}}</ref>]]\n\nIn Albania's [[Third Five Year Plan]], China promised a loan of $125&nbsp;million to build twenty-five chemical, electrical and metallurgical plants called for under the Plan. However, the nation experienced a difficult transition period, because Chinese technicians were of a lower quality than Soviet ones and the great distance between the two nations, plus the poor relations which Albania had with its neighbors, further complicated matters. Unlike Yugoslavia or the USSR, China had less economic influence on Albania during Hoxha's leadership. The previous fifteen years (1946\u20131961) had at least 50% of the economy under foreign commerce.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biberaj|1986|p=40}}.</ref>\n\nBy the time the 1976 Constitution which prohibited foreign debt was promulgated, aid and investments, Albania had basically become self-sufficient although it was lacking in modern technology. Ideologically, Hoxha found Mao's initial views to be in line with [[Marxism-Leninism]]. Mao condemned [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s alleged [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]] and he was also critical of Yugoslavia. Aid given from China was interest-free and it did not have to be repaid until Albania could afford to do so.<ref name=\"Hamm, 45\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hamm|1963|p=45}}</ref>\n\nChina never intervened in what Albania's economic output should be, and Chinese technicians worked for the same wages as Albanian workers, unlike Soviet technicians who sometimes made more than three times the pay of Hoxha.<ref name=\"Hamm, 45\" /> Albanian newspapers were reprinted in Chinese newspapers and read on Chinese radio. Finally, Albania led the movement [[China and the United Nations|to give the People's Republic of China a seat]] on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]], an effort which would prove successful in 1971 when it replaced the [[Taiwan|Republic of China's]] seat.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Pearson|2006|p=628}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period, Albania became the second largest producer of [[chromium]] in the world, which was considered an important export for Albania. Strategically, the [[Adriatic Sea]] was also attractive to China, and the Chinese leadership had hoped to gain more allies in [[Eastern Europe]] with Albania's help, although this effort failed. [[Zhou Enlai]] visited Albania in January 1964. On 9 January, \"The 1964 Sino-Albanian Joint Statement\" was signed in Tirana.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biberaj|1986|p=48}}.</ref> The statement said of relations between socialist countries:\n{{Quote\n| text = Both [Albania and China] hold that the relations between socialist countries are international relations of a new type. Relations between socialist countries, big or small, economically more developed or less developed, must be based on the principles of complete equality, respect for territorial sovereignty and independence, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and must also be based on the principles of mutual assistance in accordance with proletarian internationalism. It is necessary to oppose great-nation chauvinism and national egoism in relations between socialist countries. It is absolutely impermissible to impose the will of one country upon another, or to impair the independence, sovereignty and interests of the people, of a fraternal country on the pretext of 'aid' or 'international division of labour.'<ref>\"Sino-Albanian Joint Statement,\" ''Peking Review'' (17 January 1964) 17.</ref>}}\n\nLike Albania, China defended the \"purity\" of [[Marxism]] by attacking both [[American imperialism|US imperialism]] and \"Soviet and Yugoslav revisionism\", both equally as part of a \"dual adversary\" theory.<ref name=\"O'Donnell, p. 68\">{{Harvnb|O'Donnell|1999|p=68}}.</ref> Yugoslavia was viewed as both a \"special detachment of U.S. imperialism\" and a \"saboteur against world revolution.\"<ref name=\"O'Donnell, p. 68\" /> These views, however, began to change in China, which was one of the major issues which Albania had with the alliance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Biberaj|1986|p=49}}.</ref> Also unlike Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, the Sino-Albanian alliance lacked \"...&nbsp;an organizational structure for regular consultations and policy coordination, and it was also characterized by an informal relationship which was conducted on an ''ad hoc'' basis.\" Mao made a speech on 3 November 1966 in which he claimed that Albania was the only [[Marxist-Leninist]] state in Europe and in the same speech, he also stated that \"an attack on Albania will have to reckon with great People's China. If the U.S. imperialists, the modern Soviet revisionists or any of their lackeys dare to touch Albania in the slightest, nothing lies ahead for them but a complete, shameful and memorable defeat.\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Hamm|1963|p=43}}</ref> Likewise, Hoxha stated that \"You may rest assured, comrades, that come what may in the world at large, our two parties and our two peoples will certainly remain together. They will fight together and they will win together.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Biberaj|1986|p=58}}.</ref>\n\n==== Shift in Chinese foreign policy after the Cultural Revolution ====\nChina entered into a four-year period of relative diplomatic isolation following the [[Cultural Revolution]] and at this point relations between China and Albania reached their zenith. On 20 August 1968, the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] was condemned by Albania, as was the [[Brezhnev doctrine]]. Albania then officially withdrew from the Warsaw Pact on 5 September. Relations with China began to deteriorate on 15 July 1971, when United States President [[Richard Nixon]] agreed to visit China to meet with [[Zhou Enlai]]. Hoxha felt betrayed and the government was in a state of shock. On 6 August a letter was sent from the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, calling Nixon a \"frenzied anti-Communist\". The letter stated:\n{{Quote\n| text = We trust you will understand the reason for the delay in our reply.

That is why on this major problem which you put before us, we inform you that we consider your decision to receive Nixon in Beijing as incorrect and undesirable, and we do not approve or support it.

Hoxha viewed this as a way for China to justify having the U.S. as the \"secondary enemy\" while viewing the Soviet Union as the main one, thus allowing China to trade with the U.S. \"the Chinese plan of the 'third world' is a major diabolical plan, with the aim that China should become another superpower, precisely by placing itself at the head of the 'third world' and the 'non-aligned world'.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Hoxha|1979b|p=656}}</ref> From 30 August to 7 September 1977, [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] visited [[Beijing]] and was welcomed by the Chinese leadership. At this point, the Albanian Party of Labour had declared that China was now a revisionist state akin to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and that Albania was the only Marxist\u2013Leninist state on Earth. Hoxha stated:\n\n{{Quote\n| text = The Chinese leaders are acting like the leaders of a 'great state'. They think, 'The Albanians fell out with the Soviet Union because they had us, and if they fall with us, too, they will go back to the Soviets,' therefore they say, 'Either with us or the Soviets, it is all the same, the Albanians are done for.'

Another was detained in a cell one meter by eight meters large in the local police station and kept in [[solitary confinement]] for a five-day period punctuated by two beating sessions until he signed a confession; he was taken to ''Sigurimi'' headquarters, where he was again tortured and questioned, despite his prior confession, until his three-day trial. Still another witness was confined underground for more than a year in a three-meter square cell. During this time he was interrogated at irregular intervals and subjected to various forms of physical and psychological torture. He was chained to a chair, beaten, and subjected to electric shocks. He was shown a bullet that was supposedly meant for him and told that car engines starting within his earshot were driving victims to their executions, the next of which would be his.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Minnesota Lawyers International Human Rights Committee|1990|pp=46\u201347}}</ref></blockquote>During Hoxha's rule, \"[t]here were six institutions for political prisoners and fourteen labour camps where political prisoners and common criminals worked together.

The area between the fence and the actual border is seeded with booby traps such as coils of wire, noise makers consisting of thin pieces of metal strips on top of two wooden slats with stones in a tin container which rattle if stepped on, and flares that are triggered by contact, thus illuminating would-be escapees during the night.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Minnesota Lawyers International Human Rights Committee|1990|pp=50\u201353}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{Further|State atheism#Albania|Religion in Albania#Communist Albania}}\nAlbania, the only predominantly [[Muslim]] country in Europe at that time, largely owing to Turkish influence in the region, had not, like the [[Ottoman Empire]], identified religion with ethnicity. In the Ottoman Empire, Muslims were viewed as Turks, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] were viewed as Greeks, and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] were viewed as Latins. Hoxha believed this was a serious issue, feeling that it both fueled Greek separatists in southern Albania and that it also divided the nation in general. The Agrarian Reform Law of 1945 confiscated much of the church's property in the country. Catholics were the earliest religious community to be targeted since the [[Holy See|Vatican]] was seen as being an agent of [[Fascism]] and [[anti-Communism]].<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Logoreci|1978}}</ref> In 1946 the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]] was banned and the [[Franciscans]] were banned in 1947. ''Decree No. 743'' (On religion) sought a [[State religion|national church]] and forbade religious leaders to associate with foreign powers.\n\nThe Party focused on atheist education in schools. This tactic was effective, primarily due to the high birthrate policy encouraged after the war. During what the religious consider \"holy periods,\" such as [[Lent]] and [[Ramadan]], many foods which are scorned by them (dairy products, meat, etc.) were distributed in schools and factories, and those who refused to eat those foods were denounced.\n\nStarting on 6 February 1967, the Party began to promote [[secularism]] over [[Abrahamic religions]]. Hoxha, who had declared a \"Cultural and Ideological Revolution\" after being partly inspired by China's [[Cultural Revolution]], encouraged communist students and workers to use more forceful tactics to discourage religious practices, although violence was initially condemned.<ref>Enver Hoxha, \"The Communists Lead by Means of Example, Sacrifices, Abnegation: Discussion in the Organization of the Party, Sector C, of the 'Enver' Plant\", 2 March 1967, in Hoxha, E., Vepra, n. 35, Tirana, 1982, pp. 130\u20131. \"In this matter violence, exaggerated or inflated actions must be condemned. Here it is necessary to use persuasion and only persuasion, political and ideological work, so that the ground is prepared for each concrete action against religion.\"</ref>\n\nAccording to Hoxha, the surge in [[Antitheism|anti-theist]] activity began with the youth. The result of this \"spontaneous, unprovoked movement\" was the closing of all 2,169 [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[mosque]]s in Albania. [[State atheism]] became official policy, and Albania was declared the world's first atheist state. Town and city names which echoed Abrahamic religious themes were abandoned for neutral secular ones, as well as personal names. During this period religiously based names were also made illegal. The ''Dictionary of People's Names'', published in 1982, contained 3,000 approved, secular names. In 1992, Monsignor Dias, the Papal Nuncio for Albania appointed by [[Pope John Paul II]], said that of the three hundred Catholic priests present in Albania prior to the Communists coming to power, only thirty were still active.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/27/world/albania-s-clerics-lead-a-rebirth.html|title=ALBANIA'S CLERICS LEAD A REBIRTH|last=Kamm|first=Henry|date=1992-03-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-29|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Promotion of religion was banned and all clerics were outlawed as reactionaries.

At the same time, he was formally commissioned in both the army and navy as a second lieutenant and ensign, respectively, and was also decorated with the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]]. In 1914, he was promoted to the ranks of lieutenant in the army and sub-lieutenant in the navy, then to captain and lieutenant in 1916.

In 1923, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the army and Commander in the navy, and to army Colonel and Navy Captain in 1925.\n\nDuring Hirohito's regency, a number of important events occurred:\n\nIn the [[Four-Power Treaty]] on Insular Possessions signed on 13 December 1921, Japan, the United States, Britain, and France agreed to recognize the status quo in the Pacific, and Japan and Britain agreed to terminate formally the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]]. The [[Washington Naval Treaty]] was signed on 6 February 1922. Japan withdrew troops from the [[Siberian Intervention]] on 28 August 1922. The [[Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] devastated Tokyo on 1 September 1923. On 27 December 1923, [[Daisuke Namba]] attempted to assassinate Hirohito in the [[Toranomon Incident]] but his attempt failed.

In writing, the Emperor was also referred to formally as \"The Reigning Emperor\".\n\nIn November 1928, the Emperor's ascension was confirmed in [[Enthronement of the Japanese Emperor|ceremonies]] (''sokui'')<ref name=\"varley44\"/> which are conventionally identified as \"enthronement\" and \"coronation\" (''Sh\u014dwa no tairei-shiki''); but this formal event would have been more accurately described as a public confirmation that his Imperial Majesty possesses the Japanese [[Imperial Regalia of Japan|Imperial Regalia]],<ref>Ponsonby-Fane, p. 349.</ref> also called the [[Three Sacred Treasures]], which have been handed down through the centuries.<ref>Ponsonby-Fane, pp. 136\u2013137.</ref>\n\n==Early reign==\n[[Image:Emperor Showa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Emperor Hirohito after his enthronement ceremony in 1928, dressed in [[sokutai]]]]\n[[Image:Hirohito in dress uniform.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Hirohito in his early years as Emperor]]\n\nThe first part of Hirohito's reign took place against a background of [[Sh\u014dwa financial crisis|financial crisis]] and increasing military power within the government, through both legal and extralegal means. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] held [[veto]] power over the formation of cabinets since 1900, and between 1921 and 1944 there were no fewer than 64 incidents of political violence.\n\nHirohito narrowly missed assassination by a [[hand grenade]] thrown by a [[Korean independence movement|Korean independence]] activist, [[Lee Bong-chang]], in Tokyo on 9 January 1932, in the [[Sakuradamon Incident (1932)|Sakuradamon Incident]].\n\nAnother notable case was the assassination of moderate [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Inukai Tsuyoshi]] in 1932, which marked the end of [[civilian control of the military]]. This was followed by an attempted [[coup|military coup]] in February 1936, the [[February 26 incident]], mounted by junior Army officers of the ''[[K\u014dd\u014dha]]'' faction who had the sympathy of many high-ranking officers including [[Prince Chichibu]] (Yasuhito), one of the Emperor's brothers. This revolt was occasioned by a loss of political support by the militarist faction in [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] elections. The coup resulted in the murders of a number of high government and Army officials.\n\nWhen Chief [[Aide-de-camp to the Emperor of Japan|Aide-de-camp]] [[Shigeru Honj\u014d]] informed him of the revolt, the Emperor immediately ordered that it be put down and referred to the officers as \"rebels\" (''b\u014dto''). Shortly thereafter, he ordered [[Ministry of War of Japan|Army Minister]] [[Yoshiyuki Kawashima]] to suppress the rebellion within the hour, and he asked reports from Honj\u014d every thirty minutes. The next day, when told by Honj\u014d that little progress was being made by the high command in quashing the rebels, the Emperor told him \"I Myself, will lead the [[Imperial Guard of Japan|Konoe Division]] and subdue them.\" The rebellion was suppressed following his orders on [[February 26 incident#Events of February 29, 1936|29 February]].<ref>Mikiso Hane, ''Emperor Hirohito and His Chief Aide-de-camp, The Honj\u014d Diary'', 1983; ''Honj\u014d Nikki'', Hara Shob\u014d, 1975.</ref>\n\n==Second Sino-Japanese War ==\n[[Image:Hirohito Sirayuki.jpg|thumb|The Emperor and the Imperial stallion Shirayuki (literally: 'white-snow')]]\n\nStarting from the [[Mukden Incident]] in 1931, Japan occupied Chinese territories and established [[puppet state|puppet governments]]. Such \"aggression was recommended to Hirohito\" by his chiefs of staff and prime minister [[Fumimaro Konoe]], and Hirohito never personally objected to any invasion of China.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wakabayashi | first1 = Bob Tadashi | year = 1991 | title = Emperor Hirohito on Localized Aggression in China | url = http://chinajapan.org/articles/04.1/04.1wakabayashi4-27.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Sino-Japanese Studies | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 4\u201327 }}</ref> His main concern seems to have been the possibility of an attack by the Soviet Union in the north. His questions to his chief of staff, [[Prince Kan'in]], and minister of the army, [[Hajime Sugiyama]], were mostly about the time it could take to crush Chinese resistance.\n\nAccording to Akira Fujiwara, Hirohito endorsed the policy of qualifying the invasion of China as an \"incident\" instead of a \"war\"; therefore, he did not issue any notice to observe international law in this conflict (unlike what his predecessors did in previous conflicts officially recognized by Japan as wars), and the Deputy Minister of the Japanese Army instructed the Chief of staff of Japanese China Garrison Army on August 5 to not use the term \"prisoners of war\" for Chinese captives. This instruction led to the removal of the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners.<ref>Fujiwara, ''Nitch\u016b Sens\u014d ni Okeru Horyo Gyakusatsu'', Kikan Sens\u014d Sekinin Kenky\u016b 9, 1995, pp. 20-21.</ref> And the works of [[Yoshiaki Yoshimi]] and Seiya Matsuno show that the Emperor authorized, by specific orders (rinsanmei), the use of chemical weapons against the Chinese.<ref>''Dokugasusen Kankei Shiry\u014d II, Kaisetsu'', 1997, pp. 25\u201329.</ref> During [[Battle of Wuhan|the invasion of Wuhan]], from August to October 1938, the Emperor authorized the use of toxic gas on 375 separate occasions,<ref>Dokugasusen Kankei Shiry\u014d II, Kaisetsu'', 1997, p. 28.</ref> despite the resolution adopted by the [[League of Nations]] on May 14 condemning Japanese use of toxic gas.\n\n==World War II==\n===Preparations===\nOn September 27, 1940, ostensibly under Hirohito's leadership, Japan was a contracting partner of the [[Tripartite Pact]] with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] forming the [[Axis Powers]]. Before that, in July 1939, the Emperor quarrelled with his brother, [[Prince Chichibu]], who was visiting him three times a week to support the treaty, and reprimanded the army minister [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki]].<ref>Hidenari, pp. 106\u2013108, Wetzler, pp. 25, 231.</ref> But after the success of the [[Wehrmacht]] in Europe, the Emperor consented to the alliance.\n\nOn September 4, 1941, the [[Cabinet of Japan|Japanese Cabinet]] met to consider war plans prepared by [[Imperial General Headquarters]], and decided that:\n\n{{quote\n|[[Empire of Japan|Our Empire]], for the purpose of self-defence and self-preservation, will complete preparations for war ... [and is] ... resolved to go to war with the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], and the [[Vichy France|French]] if necessary. Our Empire will concurrently take all possible diplomatic measures vis-\u00e0-vis the United States and Great Britain, and thereby endeavor to obtain our objectives ... In the event that there is no prospect of our demands being met by the first ten days of October through the diplomatic negotiations mentioned above, we will immediately decide to commence hostilities against the United States, Britain and the French.}}\n\nThe objectives to be obtained were clearly defined: a free hand to continue with the conquest of China and Southeast Asia, no increase in US or British military forces in the region, and cooperation by the West \"in the acquisition of goods needed by our Empire\".\n\nOn September 5, Prime Minister Konoe informally submitted a draft of the decision to the Emperor, just one day in advance of the Imperial Conference at which it would be formally implemented. On this evening, the Emperor had a meeting with the chief of staff of the army, Sugiyama, chief of staff of the navy, [[Osami Nagano]], and Prime Minister Konoe. The Emperor questioned Sugiyama about the chances of success of an open war with [[Western world|the Occident]]. As Sugiyama answered positively, the Emperor scolded him:\n\n{{quote\n|\u2014At the time of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|China Incident]], the army told me that we could achieve peace immediately after dealing them one blow with three divisions... but you can't still beat Chiang Kai-shek even today!

At the Imperial Conference on the following day, the Emperor directly questioned the chiefs of the Army and Navy general staffs, which was quite an unprecedented action.\n\nNevertheless, all speakers at the Imperial Conference were united in favor of war rather than diplomacy.<ref name=\"Reports of General MacArthur\">{{cite web|last1=MacArthur|title=Chapter III: Politico-Military Evolution Toward War|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/macarthur%20v2%20p1/ch3.htm|website=www.history.army.mil|accessdate=September 17, 2016}}</ref> Baron [[Yoshimichi Hara]], President of the Imperial Council and the Emperor's representative, then questioned them closely, producing replies to the effect that war would be considered only as a last resort from some, and silence from others.\n\nAt this point, the Emperor astonished all present by addressing the conference personally, and in breaking the tradition of Imperial silence left his advisors \"struck with awe.\" (Prime Minister Konoe's description of the event.) Hirohito stressed the need for peaceful resolution of international problems, expressed regret at his ministers' failure to respond to Baron Hara's probings, and recited a poem written by his grandfather, Emperor Meiji which, he said, he had read \"over and over again\":\n\n{{quote\n|<poem>''The seas of the four directions\u2014''\n''all are born of one womb:''\n''why, then, do the wind and waves rise in discord?''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://this-is-japan.com/en/blognews/item/215.html |title=Historical Events Today: 1867 \u2013 Prince Mutsuhito, 14, becomes Emperor Meiji of Japan (1867\u20131912) |publisher=This-is-japan.com |date=2002-07-22 |accessdate=2016-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229035026/http://this-is-japan.com/en/blognews/item/215.html |archivedate=December 29, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref></poem>}}\n\nRecovering from their shock, the ministers hastened to express their profound wish to explore all possible peaceful avenues. The Emperor's presentation was in line with his practical role as leader of the [[State Shinto]] religion.\n\nAt this time, Army Imperial Headquarters was continually communicating with the Imperial household in detail about the military situation. On October 8, Sugiyama signed a 47-page report to the Emperor (s\u014dj\u014dan) outlining in minute detail plans for the advance into Southeast Asia. During the third week of October, Sugiyama gave the Emperor a 51-page document, \"Materials in Reply to the Throne\", about the operational outlook for the war.<ref>Wetzler, pp. 52\u201354.</ref>\n\nAs war preparations continued, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Fumimaro Konoe]] found himself more and more isolated and gave his resignation on October 16. He justified himself to his chief cabinet secretary, Kenji Tomita, by stating:\n\n{{quote|Of course His Majesty is a pacifist, and there is no doubt he wished to avoid war. When I told him that to initiate war was a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: \"You were worried about it yesterday, but you do not have to worry so much.\" Thus, gradually, he began to lean toward war. And the next time I met him, he leaned even more toward. In short, I felt the Emperor was telling me: my prime minister does not understand military matters, I know much more. In short, the Emperor had absorbed the view of the army and navy high commands.<ref>Fujiwara, ''Sh\u014dwa tenn\u014d no j\u016bgo-nen sens\u014d'', 1991, p. 126, citing Kenji Tomita's diary.</ref>}}\n\nThe army and the navy recommended the candidacy of [[Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni]], one of the Emperor's uncles. According to the Sh\u014dwa \"Monologue\", written after the war, the Emperor then said that if the war were to begin while a member of the imperial house was prime minister, the imperial house would have to carry the responsibility and he was opposed to this.<ref>Hidenari, p. 118.</ref>\n[[File:Imperial general headquaters meeting.jpg|thumb|\nThe Emperor as head of the [[Imperial General Headquarters]] on April 29, 1943]]\nInstead, the Emperor chose the hard-line General [[Hideki Tojo|Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]], who was known for his devotion to the imperial institution, and asked him to make a policy review of what had been sanctioned by the Imperial Conferences. On November 2, T\u014dj\u014d, Sugiyama and Nagano reported to the Emperor that the review of eleven points had been in vain.

On November 25 [[Henry L. Stimson]], United States Secretary of War noted in his diary that he had discussed with US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] the severe likelihood that Japan was about to launch a surprise attack, and that the question had been \"how we should maneuver them [the Japanese] into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves\".\n\nOn the following day, November 26, 1941, [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] [[Cordell Hull]] presented the Japanese ambassador with the [[Hull note]], which as one of its conditions demanded the complete withdrawal of all Japanese troops from [[French Indochina]] and China. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Hideki said to his cabinet, \"this is an ultimatum\". On December 1, an Imperial Conference sanctioned the \"War against the United States, United Kingdom and the Kingdom of the Netherlands\".\n\n===War: advance and retreat===\nOn December 8 (December 7 in Hawaii), 1941, in simultaneous attacks, Japanese forces struck at the Hong Kong Garrison, the US Fleet in [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] and in the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]] and began the [[invasion of Malaya]].\n\nWith the nation fully committed to the war, the Emperor took a keen interest in military progress and sought to boost morale. According to Akira Yamada and Akira Fujiwara, the Emperor made major interventions in some military operations. For example, he pressed Sugiyama four times, on January 13 and 21 and February 9 and 26, to increase troop strength and launch an attack on [[Bataan]]. On February 9, March 19 and May 29, the Emperor ordered the Army Chief of staff to examine the possibilities for an attack on [[Chungking]], which led to Operation Gogo.<ref>Yamada, pp. 180, 181, 185; Fujiwara, pp. 135\u2013138.</ref>\n\nAs the tide of war began to turn against Japan (around late 1942 and early 1943), some people{{who|date=November 2014}} argue that the flow of information to the palace gradually began to bear less and less relation to reality, while others suggest that the Emperor worked closely with [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Hideki Tojo|Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]], continued to be well and accurately briefed by the military, and knew Japan's military position precisely right up to the point of surrender. The chief of staff of the General Affairs section of the Prime Minister's office, Shuichi Inada, remarked to T\u014dj\u014d's private secretary, Sadao Akamatsu:\n{{quote|There has never been a cabinet in which the prime minister, and all the ministers, reported so often to the throne.

Japanese advances were stopped in the summer of 1942 with the [[battle of Midway]] and the landing of the American forces on [[Guadalcanal]] and [[Tulagi]] in August. The Emperor recognized the potential danger and pushed the navy and the army for greater efforts. In September 1942, Emperor Hirohito signed an Imperial Rescript condemning to death American fliers Lieutenants Dean E. Hallmark and William G. Farrow and Corporal Harold A. Spatz and commuting to life sentences Lieutenants [[Robert J. Meder]], [[Chase Nielsen]], Robert L. Hite and George Barr and Corporal [[Jacob DeShazer]]. All had participated in the [[Doolittle Raid]] and had been captured.\n\nWhen informed in August 1943 by [[Hajime Sugiyama|Sugiyama]] that the American advance through the [[Solomon Islands]] could not be stopped, the Emperor asked his chief of staff to consider other places to attack: \"When and where are you ever going to put up a good fight? And when are you ever going to fight a decisive battle?\"<ref>Bix, p. 466, citing the Sugiyama memo, p. 24.</ref> On August 24, the Emperor reprimanded Nagano and on September 11, he ordered Sugiyama to work with the Navy to implement better military preparation and give adequate supply to soldiers fighting in [[Rabaul]].<ref>Yamada, pp. 240\u2013242.</ref>\n\nThroughout the following years from 1943 to 1945, the sequence of drawn and then decisively lost naval and land engagements was reported to the public as a series of great victories. Only gradually did it become apparent to the Japanese people that the situation was very grim due to growing shortages of food, medicine, and fuel as U.S submarines began wiping out Japanese shipping. Starting in mid 1944, U.S. air raids on the cities of Japan made a mockery of the unending tales of victory. Later that year, with the downfall of Hideki T\u014dj\u014d's government, two other prime ministers were appointed to continue the war effort, [[Kuniaki Koiso]] and [[Kantar\u014d Suzuki]]\u2014each with the formal approval of the Emperor. Both were unsuccessful and Japan was nearing defeat.\n\n===Surrender===\n{{Main article|Surrender of Japan}}\n{{refimprove|section|date=December 2017}}<!--3 paragraphs have no citations-->\n\nIn early 1945, in the wake of the losses in [[Battle of Leyte]], Emperor Hirohito began a series of individual meetings with senior government officials to consider the progress of the war. All but ex-Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe advised continuing the war. Konoe feared a communist revolution even more than defeat in war and urged a negotiated surrender. In February 1945, during the first private audience with the Emperor which he had been allowed in three years,<ref>Bix, p. 756.</ref> Konoe advised Hirohito to begin negotiations to end the war. According to Grand Chamberlain [[Hisanori Fujita]], the Emperor, still looking for a ''tennozan'' (a great victory) in order to provide a stronger bargaining position, firmly rejected Konoe's recommendation.<ref>Fujita Hisanori, ''Jij\u00fbch\u00f4 no kais\u00f4'', Ch\u00fb\u00f4 K\u00f4ronsha, 1987, pp. 66\u201367, Bix, p. 489.</ref>\n\nWith each passing week victory became less likely. In April the Soviet Union issued notice that it would not renew its neutrality agreement. Japan's ally Germany surrendered in early May 1945. In June, the cabinet reassessed the war strategy, only to decide more firmly than ever on a fight to the last man. This strategy was officially affirmed at a brief Imperial Council meeting, at which, as was normal, the Emperor did not speak.\n\nThe following day, [[Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan|Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal]] [[K\u014dichi Kido]] prepared a draft document which summarized the hopeless military situation and proposed a negotiated settlement. Extremists in Japan were also calling for a death-before-dishonor mass suicide, modeled on the \"[[Forty-seven Ronin|47 Ronin]]\" incident. By mid-June 1945, the cabinet had agreed to approach the Soviet Union to act as a mediator for a negotiated surrender, but not before Japan's bargaining position had been improved by repulse of the anticipated Allied invasion of mainland Japan.\n\nOn June 22, the Emperor met with his ministers, saying \"I desire that concrete plans to end the war, unhampered by existing policy, be speedily studied and that efforts be made to implement them.\" The attempt to negotiate a peace via the Soviet Union came to nothing. There was always the threat that extremists would carry out a coup or foment other violence. On July 26, 1945, the Allies issued the [[Potsdam Declaration]] demanding [[unconditional surrender]]. The Japanese government council, the Big Six, considered that option and recommended to the Emperor that it be accepted only if one to four conditions were agreed upon, including a guarantee of the Emperor's continued position in [[Culture of Japan|Japanese society]]. The Emperor decided not to surrender.\n\nThat changed after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and the Soviet declaration of war. On August 9, Emperor Hirohito told [[K\u014dichi Kido]]: \"the Soviet Union has declared war and today began hostilities against us.\"<ref>Kido K\u014dichi Nikki, p. 1223.</ref> On August 10, the cabinet drafted an \"[[Imperial Rescript ending the War]]\" following the Emperor's indications that the declaration did not compromise any demand which prejudiced the prerogatives of His Majesty as a Sovereign Ruler.\n\nOn August 12, 1945, the Emperor informed the imperial family of his decision to surrender. One of his uncles, [[Prince Yasuhiko Asaka]], asked whether the war would be continued if the ''[[kokutai]]'' (national polity) could not be preserved. The Emperor simply replied \"of course.\"<ref>Hidenari, p. 129.</ref> On August 14, the Suzuki government notified the Allies that it had accepted the [[Potsdam Declaration]].\n\nOn August 15, a recording of the Emperor's surrender speech ([[Jewel Voice Broadcast|''\"Gyokuon-h\u014ds\u014d\"'', literally ''\"Jewel Voice Broadcast\"'']]) was broadcast over the radio (the first time the Emperor was heard on the radio by the Japanese people) announcing Japan's acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration. During the historic broadcast the Emperor stated: \"Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.\" The speech also noted that \"the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage\" and ordered the Japanese to \"endure the unendurable\". The speech, using formal, archaic Japanese, was not readily understood by many commoners. According to historian Richard Storry in ''A History of Modern Japan'', the Emperor typically used \"a form of language familiar only to the well-educated\" and to the more traditional [[samurai]] families.<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Storry |title=A History of Modern Japan |year=1991 |publisher=Penguin}}</ref>\n\nA faction of the army opposed to the surrender attempted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] on the evening of 14 August. They seized the Imperial Palace (the [[Ky\u016bj\u014d incident]]), but the physical recording of the emperor's speech was hidden and preserved overnight. The coup was crushed by the next morning, and the speech was broadcast.\n\nIn his first ever press conference given in Tokyo in 1975, when he was asked what he thought of the bombing of Hiroshima, the Emperor answered: \"It's very regrettable that nuclear bombs were dropped and I feel sorry for the citizens of Hiroshima but it couldn't be helped because that happened in wartime\" ([[shikata ga nai]]).<ref>Bix, p. 676; Dower, p. 606.</ref>\n\n===Accountability for Japanese war crimes===\nSome historians believe Emperor Hirohito was directly responsible for [[Japanese war crimes|the atrocities committed by the imperial forces]] in the Second Sino-Japanese War and in World War II. They feel that he, and some members of the imperial family such as his brother [[Prince Chichibu]], his cousins [[Prince Takeda Tsuneyoshi|Prince Takeda]] and [[Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu|Prince Fushimi]], and his uncles [[Prince Kan'in]], [[Prince Asaka]], and [[Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko|Prince Higashikuni]], should have been tried for [[war crime]]s.<ref>Dower.</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Bix.</ref>\n\nThe debate over Hirohito's responsibility for war crimes concerns how much real control the Emperor had over the Japanese military during the two wars. Officially, the imperial constitution, adopted under [[Emperor Meiji]], gave full power to the Emperor. Article 4 prescribed that, \"The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution\", while, according to article 6, \"The Emperor gives sanction to laws and orders them to be promulgated and executed\", and article 11, \"The Emperor has the supreme command of the Army and the Navy.\" The Emperor was thus the leader of the [[Imperial General Headquarters]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/1889con.html |title=The Constitution of the Empire of Japan(1889) }}</ref>\n\nPoison gas weapons, such as [[phosgene]], were produced by [[Unit 731]] and authorized by specific orders given by Hirohito himself, transmitted by the chief of staff of the army. For example, Hirohito authorised the use of toxic gas 375 times during [[Battle of Wuhan|the battle of Wuhan]] from August to October 1938.<ref name=matsuno2729/>\n\nHistorians such as [[Herbert Bix]], [[Akira Fujiwara]], Peter Wetzler, and [[Akira Yamada]] assert that the post-war view focusing on imperial conferences misses the importance of numerous \"behind the chrysanthemum curtain\" meetings where the real decisions were made between the Emperor, his chiefs of staff, and the cabinet. Historians such as Fujiwara<ref>{{cite book |title=Sh\u014dwa Tenn\u014d no J\u016b-go Nen Sens\u014d (The Sh\u014dwa Emperor fifteen years war)|year=1991 |first=Akira |last=Fujiwara}}</ref> and Wetzler,<ref>Wetzler.</ref> based on the primary sources and the monumental work of Shir\u014d Hara,{{efn|Former member of section 20 of War operations of the Army high command, Hara has made a detailed study of the way military decisions were made, including the Emperor's involvement published in five volumes in 1973\u201374 under the title ''Daihon'ei senshi; Dait\u014da Sens\u014d kaisen gaishi; Kaisen ni itaru seisentyaku shid\u014d'' (Imperial Headquarters war history; General history of beginning hostilities in the Greater East Asia War; Leadership and political strategy with respect to the beginning of hostilities).}} have produced evidence suggesting that the Emperor worked through intermediaries to exercise a great deal of control over the military and was neither bellicose nor a pacifist, but an opportunist who governed in a pluralistic decision-making process. American historian [[Herbert P. Bix]] argues that Emperor Hirohito might have been the prime mover of most of the events of the two wars.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe view promoted by both the Japanese Imperial Palace and the American occupation forces immediately after World War II portrayed Emperor Hirohito as a powerless [[figurehead (metaphor)|figurehead]] behaving strictly according to protocol, while remaining at a distance from the decision-making processes. This view was endorsed by Prime Minister [[Noboru Takeshita]] in a speech on the day of Hirohito's death, in which Takeshita asserted that the war \"had broken out against [Hirohito's] wishes\". Takeshita's statement provoked outrage in nations in East Asia and Commonwealth nations such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.<ref name=\"Chira1989\" /> According to historian Fujiwara \"the thesis that the Emperor, as an organ of responsibility, could not reverse cabinet decision, is a [[myth]] fabricated after the war\".<ref>''Sh\u014dwa tenn\u014d no J\u016b-go nen sens\u014d'', Aoki Shoten, 1991, p. 122.</ref>\n\nIn Japan, debate over the Emperor's responsibility was taboo while he was still alive.

Many members of the imperial family, such as Princes Chichibu, Takamatsu and Higashikuni, pressured the Emperor to abdicate so that one of the Princes could serve as regent until Crown Prince [[Akihito]] came of age.<ref>Bix, pp. 571\u2013573.</ref> On February 27, 1946, the Emperor's youngest brother, [[Prince Mikasa]] (Takahito), even stood up in the privy council and indirectly urged the Emperor to step down and accept responsibility for Japan's defeat. According to Minister of Welfare Ashida's diary, \"Everyone seemed to ponder Mikasa's words. Never have I seen His Majesty's face so pale.\"<ref>''Ashida Hitoshi Nikki, Dai Ikkan'', Iwanami Shoten, 1986, p. 82.</ref>\n\nU.S. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] insisted that Emperor Hirohito retain the throne. MacArthur saw the Emperor as a symbol of the continuity and cohesion of the Japanese people. Some historians criticize the decision to exonerate the Emperor and all members of the imperial family who were implicated in the war, such as [[Prince Chichibu]], [[Prince Asaka]], Prince Higashikuni and Prince [[Hiroyasu Fushimi]], from criminal prosecutions.<ref>Dower, Bix.</ref>\n\nBefore the war crime trials actually convened, the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|SCAP]], the [[International Peace and Security|IPS]], and Japanese officials worked behind the scenes not only to prevent the Imperial family from being indicted, but also to influence the testimony of the defendants to ensure that no one implicated the Emperor. High officials in court circles and the Japanese government collaborated with Allied GHQ in compiling lists of prospective war criminals, while the individuals arrested as ''Class A'' suspects and incarcerated solemnly vowed to protect their sovereign against any possible taint of war responsibility.<ref>Dower, p. 325.</ref> Thus, \"months before the [[Tokyo tribunal]] commenced, MacArthur's highest subordinates were working to attribute ultimate responsibility for [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] to [[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]]\"<ref>Dower, p. 585.</ref> by allowing \"the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment.\"<ref>Dower, p. 583.</ref> According to [[John W. Dower]], \"This successful campaign to absolve the Emperor of war responsibility knew no bounds. Hirohito was not merely presented as being innocent of any formal acts that might make him culpable to indictment as a war criminal, he was turned into an almost saintly figure who did not even bear moral responsibility for the war.\"<ref>Dower, p. 326.</ref> According to Bix, \"MacArthur's truly extraordinary measures to save Hirohito from trial as a war criminal had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on Japanese understanding of the lost war.\"<ref>Bix, p. 585.</ref>\n\n===Imperial status===\n[[File:Emperor Showa visit to Hiroshima in 1947.JPG|thumb|Emperor Hirohito visiting [[Hiroshima]] in 1947]]\n\nHirohito was not put on trial, but he was forced{{sfn|Dower|1999|p=308\u2013318}} to [[Humanity Declaration|explicitly reject]] the quasi-official claim that the Emperor of Japan was an ''[[arahitogami]]'', i.e., an incarnate divinity. This was motivated by the fact that, according to the [[Meiji Constitution|Japanese constitution of 1889]], the Emperor had a divine power over his country, which was derived from the [[Shinto]] belief that the Japanese Imperial Family was the offspring of the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]]. Hirohito was however persistent in the idea that the Emperor of Japan should be considered a descendant of the gods. In December 1945, he told his vice-grand-chamberlain Michio Kinoshita: \"It is permissible to say that the idea that the Japanese are descendants of the gods is a false conception; but it is absolutely impermissible to call [[wiktionary:chimerical|chimerical]] the idea that the Emperor is a descendant of the gods.\"<ref>Wetzler, p. 3.</ref> In any case, the \"renunciation of divinity\" was noted more by foreigners than by Japanese, and seems to have been intended for the consumption of the former.{{efn|Many foreigners, including those from the occupying power, were from [[Western civilization|Western countries]] steeped in [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic traditions]].}} The theory of a constitutional monarchy had already had some proponents in Japan. In 1935, when Tatsukichi Minobe advocated the theory that sovereignty resides in the state, of which the Emperor is just an organ (the ''tenn\u014d kikan setsu''), it caused a furor. He was forced to resign from the House of Peers and his post at the Tokyo Imperial University, his books were banned and an attempt was made on his life.<ref>Large, Stephen S.; ''Emperor Hirohito and Showa Japan: A Political Biography'', p. 60; Routledge, 1992.</ref> Not until 1946 was the tremendous step made to alter the Emperor's title from \"imperial sovereign\" to \"[[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]]\".\n\n[[File:Ford and Emperor1975.jpg|thumb|left|The Empress, First Lady [[Betty Ford]], the Emperor, and [[President Gerald Ford]] at the [[White House]] before a state dinner held in honor of the Japanese head of state for the first time. October 2, 1975.]]\n\nAlthough the Emperor had supposedly repudiated claims to divinity, his public position was deliberately left vague, partly because [[Douglas MacArthur|General MacArthur]] thought him probable to be a useful partner to get the Japanese to accept the occupation, and partly due to behind-the-scenes maneuverings by [[Shigeru Yoshida]] to thwart attempts to cast him as a European-style monarch.\n\nNevertheless, Hirohito's status as a limited constitutional monarch status was formalized with the enactment of the [[Constitution of Japan|1947 Constitution]]\u2013officially, an amendment to the Meiji Constitution. It defined the Emperor as \"the symbol of the state and the unity of the people,\" and stripped him of even nominal power in government matters. His role was limited to matters of state as delineated in the Constitution, and in most cases his actions in that realm were carried out in accordance with the binding instructions of the Cabinet.\n\n[[File:Photograph of The Reagans and Japanese Emperor Hirohito, Tokyo, Japan - NARA - 198544 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Emperor Hirohito and U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], Tokyo, November 9, 1983]]\n\nFor the rest of his life, Hirohito was an active figure in Japanese life, and performed many of the duties commonly associated with a constitutional [[head of state]]. He and his family maintained a strong public presence, often holding public walkabouts, and making public appearances on special events and ceremonies. He also played an important role in rebuilding Japan's diplomatic image, traveling abroad to meet with many foreign leaders, including Queen [[Elizabeth II]] (1971) and President [[Gerald Ford]] (1975).\n\nHis status and image became strongly positive in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brands | first1 = Hal | year = 2006 | title = The Emperor's New Clothes: American Viewsof Hirohito after World War II | url = | journal = Historian | volume = 68 | issue = 1| pages = 1\u201328 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-6563.2006.00133.x}}</ref> However, partially as a result of intense economic rivalry between British and Japanese manufacturers in the 1970s, the image of Hirohito was seen as widely seen as negative amid a growing racism against the Japanese.

This boycott lasted from 1978 until his death. This boycott has been maintained by his son [[Akihito]].\n\nOn July 20, 2006, ''[[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]]'' published a front-page article about the discovery of a memorandum detailing the reason that the Emperor stopped visiting Yasukuni. The memorandum, kept by former chief of [[Imperial Household Agency]] Tomohiko Tomita, confirms for the first time that the enshrinement of 14 [[Class-A war criminal]]s in Yasukuni was the reason for the boycott. Tomita recorded in detail the contents of his conversations with the Emperor in his diaries and notebooks. According to the memorandum, in 1988, the Emperor expressed his strong displeasure at the decision made by Yasukuni Shrine to include Class-A war criminals in the list of war dead honored there by saying, \"At some point, Class-A criminals became enshrined, including [[Y\u014dsuke Matsuoka|Matsuoka]] and [[Toshio Shiratori|Shiratori]]. I heard Tsukuba acted cautiously.\" Tsukuba is believed to refer to Fujimaro Tsukuba, the former chief Yasukuni priest at the time, who decided not to enshrine the war criminals despite having received in 1966 the list of war dead compiled by the government. \"What's on the mind of Matsudaira's son, who is the current head priest?\" \"Matsudaira had a strong wish for peace, but the child didn't know the parent's heart. That's why I have not visited the shrine since. This is my heart.\" Matsudaira is believed to refer to Yoshitami Matsudaira, who was the grand steward of the Imperial Household immediately after the end of World War II. His son, Nagayoshi, succeeded Fujimaro Tsukuba as the chief priest of Yasukuni and decided to enshrine the war criminals in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20060721a1.html |title=Hirohito visits to Yasukuni stopped over war criminals &#124; The Japan Times Online |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref> Nagayoshi Matsudaira died in 2006, which some commentators have speculated is the reason for release of the memo.\n\n==Death and state funeral==\n{{Main article|Death and funeral of Hirohito}}\n[[File:Showa Shrine.jpg|thumb|Hirohito's tomb in the [[Musashi Imperial Graveyard]], [[Hachi\u014dji, Tokyo]]]]\n\nOn September 22, 1987, the Emperor underwent surgery on his [[pancreas]] after having digestive problems for several months. The doctors discovered that he had [[duodenal cancer]]. The Emperor appeared to be making a full recovery for several months after the surgery. About a year later, however, on September 19, 1988, he collapsed in his palace, and his health worsened over the next several months as he suffered from continuous internal bleeding. On January 7, 1989, at 7:55 AM, the grand steward of Japan's Imperial Household Agency, Shoichi Fujimori, officially announced the death of Emperor Hirohito, and revealed details about his cancer for the first time.

The town has a basin for small yachts and fishing boats, which fills at high [[tide]] and can be emptied through a sluice at low tide.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early Emsworth===\nEmsworth began as a Saxon village. At first it was linked to the settlement of [[Warblington]] nearby. People from Emsworth worshipped at St Peter's Chapel or in the church at Warblington. Emsworth was not mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, as it was included with Warblington.<ref name=bho1 />\n\nEmsworth's name came from [[Old English language|Anglo Saxon]] ''\u00c6meles wor\u00fe'' = \"a man called \u00c6mele's enclosure\".\n\nEmsworth grew to be larger and more important: in 1239 Emsworth was granted the right to hold a [[market (place)|market]], and there was also an annual fair<ref name=bho1>{{Cite web|title=Warblington in A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 3, ed.|last= Page|first=William|location=London|publisher= Victoria County History|year=1908|pages= 134\u2013139|url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol3/pp134-139|accessdate=2 November 2015}}</ref> In 1332 Emsworth (''Empnesworth'') was one of Hampshire's four Customs Ports.<ref>[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1879204 The National Archives, Kew (UK), E 122/189/5]</ref>\n\n[[File:St James' Church, Emsworth, Hampshire.JPG|thumb|left|St James' Church]]\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, Emsworth was still a port. Emsworth was known for [[shipbuilding]], [[boat building]] and [[rope]] making. Grain from the area was ground into flour by [[Tide mill|tidal mills]] and transported by ship to places such as London and [[Portsmouth]]. Timber from the area was also exported in the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref name=bho1/> The [[River Ems (Chichester Harbour)|River Ems]], which is named after the town (not, as often believed, the town being named after the river), flows into the Slipper millpond. The mill itself is now used as offices.\n\n[[File:Emsworth's old flour mill. - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|The Old Flour Mill]]\nIn the 19th century Emsworth had as many as 30 pubs and beer houses; today, only nine remain.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Emsworth had a population of less than 1,200 but it was still considered a large village for the time. By the end of the 18th century, it became fashionable for wealthy people to spend the summer by the sea. In 1805 a [[Public bathing#United Kingdom|bathing house]] was built where people could have a bath in seawater.\n\nThe parish Church of St James was built in 1840. [[Queen Victoria]] visited Emsworth in 1842, resulting in Queen Street and Victoria Road being named after her. In 1847 the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (now the [[West Coastway line]]) came to Emsworth, with a [[Emsworth railway station|railway station]] built to serve the town.<ref name=bho1/>\n\n[[File:Emsworth6.JPG|thumb|left|The Promenade]]\n\n===Modern Emsworth===\nBy 1901 the population of Emsworth was about 2,000. It grew rapidly during the 20th century to about 5,000 by the middle of the century. In 1906 construction began on the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|post office]], with local [[cricket]]er [[George Wilder (cricketer)|George Wilder]] laying an inscribed brick. The renamed Emsworth Recreation Ground dates from 1909 and is the current home of Emsworth Cricket Club, which was founded in 1811. Cricket in Emsworth has been played at the same ground, Cold Harbour Lawn, since 1761.\n\nIn 1902 the once famous Emsworth [[oyster]] industry went into rapid decline. This was after many of the guests at mayoral banquets in Southampton and Winchester became seriously ill and four died after consuming oysters. The infection was due to oysters sourced from Emsworth, as the oyster beds had been contaminated with raw sewage.<ref name=oyster1>{{cite web |title=Emsworth Oysters |publisher=Emsworth Business Association |date=3 February 2016 |url=http://www.emsworth.org.uk/news/emsworths-oysters-video-now-online |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6f14bMVrY?url=http://www.emsworth.org.uk/news/emsworths-oysters-video-now-online |archivedate=3 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{Cite paper|last=Bulstrode|first=H.

Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-phase systems of [[matter]] called [[colloid]]s. Although the terms ''colloid'' and ''emulsion'' are sometimes used interchangeably, ''emulsion'' should be used when both phases, dispersed and continuous, are liquids. In an emulsion, one liquid (the dispersed [[phase (matter)|phase]]) is [[dispersion (chemistry)|dispersed]] in the other (the continuous phase). Examples of emulsions include [[vinaigrette]]s, homogenized [[milk]], [[mayonnaise]], and some [[cutting fluid]]s for [[metal working]]. [[Graphene]] and its modified forms are also a good example of recent unconventional [[surfactant]]s helping in stabilizing emulsion systems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Harish V.|last2=Woltornist|first2=Steven J.|last3=Adamson|first3=Douglas H.|date=2016-03-01|title=Fractionation and characterization of graphene oxide by oxidation extent through emulsion stabilization|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008622315303936|journal=Carbon|volume=98|pages=491\u2013495|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2015.10.083}}</ref>\n\nThe word \"emulsion\" comes from the Latin mulgeo, mulgere \"to milk\",{{Specify|reason=What is the Latin word?|date=August 2017}} as milk is an emulsion of fat and water, along with other components.\n\nTwo liquids can form different types of emulsions. As an example, oil and water can form, first, an oil-in-water emulsion, wherein the oil is the dispersed phase, and water is the dispersion medium. ([[Lipoproteins]], used by all complex living organisms, are one example of this.) Second, they can form a water-in-oil emulsion, wherein water is the dispersed phase and oil is the external phase. Multiple emulsions are also possible, including a \"water-in-oil-in-water\" emulsion and an \"oil-in-water-in-oil\" emulsion.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17076645 |year=2006 |author1=Khan |first1=A.

The droplets dispersed in the liquid matrix (called the \u201cdispersion medium\u201d) are usually assumed to be [[Probability distribution|statistically distributed]].\n\nThe term \"emulsion\" is also used to refer to the photo-sensitive side of [[photographic film]]. Such a [[photographic emulsion]] consists of [[silver halide]] colloidal particles dispersed in a [[gelatin]] matrix. [[Nuclear emulsion]]s are similar to photographic emulsions, except that they are used in particle physics to detect high-energy [[elementary particle]]s.\n\n==Appearance and properties==\nEmulsions contain both a dispersed and a continuous phase, with the boundary between the phases called the \"interface\".{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} Emulsions tend to have a cloudy appearance because the many [[phase boundary|phase interfaces]] [[scattering|scatter]] light as it passes through the emulsion. Emulsions appear [[white]] when all light is scattered equally. If the emulsion is dilute enough, higher-frequency (low-wavelength) light will be scattered more, and the emulsion will appear [[blue]]r&nbsp;\u2013 this is called the \"[[Tyndall effect]]\". {{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}If the emulsion is concentrated enough, the color will be distorted toward comparatively longer wavelengths, and will appear more [[yellow]]. This phenomenon is easily observable when comparing [[skimmed milk]], which contains little fat, to [[cream]], which contains a much higher concentration of milk fat. One example would be a mixture of water and oil.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\nTwo special classes of emulsions&nbsp;\u2013 [[microemulsion]]s and nanoemulsions, with droplet sizes below 100&nbsp;nm&nbsp;\u2013 appear translucent.<ref name=\"Mason\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Mason TG, Wilking JN, Meleson K, Chang CB, Graves SM |title=Nanoemulsions: Formation, structure, and physical properties|journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter|volume=18|issue=41|pages=R635\u2013R666|doi=10.1088/0953-8984/18/41/R01|url=http://www.firp.ula.ve/archivos/pdf/06_JPCM_Mason.pdf|year=2006|bibcode=2006JPCM...18R.635M}}</ref> This property is due to the fact that light waves are scattered by the droplets only if their sizes exceed about one-quarter of the wavelength of the incident light. Since the [[visible spectrum]] of light is composed of wavelengths between 390 and 750 [[nanometer]]s (nm), if the droplet sizes in the emulsion are below about 100&nbsp;nm, the light can penetrate through the emulsion without being scattered.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Leong TS, Wooster TJ, Kentish SE, Ashokkumar M |title=Minimising oil droplet size using ultrasonic emulsification|journal=Ultrasonics Sonochemistry|volume=16|issue=6|pages=721\u20137|pmid=19321375|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.ultsonch.2009.02.008}}</ref> Due to their similarity in appearance, translucent nanoemulsions and [[microemulsions]] are frequently confused. Unlike translucent nanoemulsions, which require specialized equipment to be produced, microemulsions are spontaneously formed by \u201csolubilizing\u201d oil molecules with a mixture of [[surfactant]]s, co-surfactants, and co-[[solvent]]s.<ref name=\"Mason\" /> The required surfactant concentration in a [[microemulsion]] is, however, several times higher than that in a translucent nanoemulsion, and significantly exceeds the concentration of the dispersed phase. Because of many undesirable side-effects caused by surfactants, their presence is disadvantageous or prohibitive in many applications. In addition, the stability of a microemulsion is often easily compromised by dilution, by heating, or by changing pH levels.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\nCommon emulsions are inherently unstable and, thus, do not tend to form spontaneously.

Over time, emulsions tend to revert to the stable state of the phases comprising the emulsion. An example of this is seen in the separation of the oil and vinegar components of [[vinaigrette (food)|vinaigrette]], an unstable emulsion that will quickly separate unless shaken almost continuously. There are important exceptions to this rule&nbsp;\u2013 [[microemulsions]] are [[thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] stable, while translucent nanoemulsions are [[Kinetics (physics)|kinetically]] stable.<ref name=\"Mason\" />\n\nWhether an emulsion of oil and water turns into a \"water-in-oil\" emulsion or an \"oil-in-water\" emulsion depends on the volume fraction of both phases and the type of emulsifier (surfactant) (see ''Emulsifier'', below) present.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} In general, the [[Bancroft rule]] applies. Emulsifiers and emulsifying particles tend to promote dispersion of the phase in which they do not dissolve very well. For example, proteins dissolve better in water than in oil, and so tend to form oil-in-water emulsions (that is, they promote the dispersion of oil droplets throughout a continuous phase of water).{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\nThe geometric structure of an emulsion mixture of two lyophobic liquids with a large concentration of the secondary component is fractal: Emulsion particles unavoidably form dynamic inhomogeneous structures on small length scale. The geometry of these structures is fractal. The size of elementary irregularities is governed by a universal function which depends on the volume content of the components. The fractal dimension of these irregularities is 2.5.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ozhovan M.I. |title=Dynamic uniform fractals in emulsions|journal= J. Exp. Theor.

Flocculation occurs when there is an attractive force between the droplets, so they form flocs, like bunches of grapes. Coalescence occurs when droplets bump into each other and combine to form a larger droplet, so the average droplet size increases over time. Emulsions can also undergo [[creaming (chemistry)|creaming]], where the droplets rise to the top of the emulsion under the influence of [[buoyancy]], or under the influence of the [[centripetal force]] induced when a [[centrifuge]] is used.<ref name=\":0\" /> Creaming is a common phenomenon in dairy and non-dairy beverages (i.e. milk, coffee milk, almond milk, soy milk) and usually does not change the droplet size.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Loi|first=Chia Chun|last2=Eyres|first2=Graham T.|last3=Birch|first3=E.

Each method has advantages and disadvantages.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\n===Accelerating methods for shelf life prediction===\nThe kinetic process of destabilization can be rather long&nbsp;\u2013 up to several months, or even years for some products.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} Often the formulator must accelerate this process in order to test products in a reasonable time during product design. Thermal methods are the most commonly used \u2013 these consist of increasing the emulsion temperature to accelerate destabilization (if below critical temperatures for phase inversion or chemical degradation).{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} Temperature affects not only the viscosity but also the inter-facial tension in the case of non-ionic surfactants or, on a broader scope, interactions of forces inside the system. Storing an emulsion at high temperatures enables the simulation of realistic conditions for a product (e.g., a tube of sunscreen emulsion in a car in the summer heat), but also to accelerate destabilization processes up to 200 times.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\nMechanical methods of acceleration, including vibration, centrifugation, and agitation, can also be used.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\nThese methods are almost always empirical, without a sound scientific basis.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\n==Emulsifiers==\nAn '''emulsifier''' (also known as an \"emulgent\") is a substance that stabilizes an emulsion by increasing its [[chemical kinetics|kinetic stability]]. One class of emulsifiers is known as \"surface active agents\", or [[surfactant]]s.  Emulsifiers are compounds that typically have a polar or hydrophilic (i.e. water-soluble) part and a non-polar (i.e. hydrophobic or lipophilic) part.  Because of this, emulsifiers tend to have more or less solubility either in water or in oil.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}  Emulsifiers that are more soluble in water (and conversely, less soluble in oil) will generally form oil-in-water emulsions, while emulsifiers that are more soluble in oil will form water-in-oil emulsions.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\nExamples of food emulsifiers are:\n* [[Egg yolk]]&nbsp;\u2013 in which the main emulsifying agent is [[lecithin]]. In fact, ''lecithos'' is the Greek word for egg yolk.\n* [[Mustard seed|Mustard]]&nbsp;\u2013 where a variety of chemicals in the [[mucilage]] surrounding the seed hull act as emulsifiers\n* [[Soy lecithin]] is another emulsifier and thickener\n* [[Pickering emulsion|Pickering stabilization]]&nbsp;\u2013 uses particles under certain circumstances\n* [[Sodium phosphates]]\n*[[Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids|Mono- and diglycerides]] - a common emulsifier found in many food products (coffee creamers, ice-creams, spreads, breads, cakes)\n* [[Sodium stearoyl lactylate]]\n* [[DATEM]] (Diacetyl Tartaric (Acid) Ester of Monoglyceride)&nbsp;\u2013 an emulsifier used primarily in baking\n\n[[Detergent]]s are another class of surfactant, and will interact physically with both [[cooking oil|oil]] and [[water]], thus stabilizing the interface between the oil and water droplets in suspension. This principle is exploited in [[soap]], to remove [[yellow grease|grease]] for the purpose of [[cleaning agent|cleaning]]. Many different emulsifiers are used in [[pharmacy]] to prepare emulsions such as [[cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]] and [[lotion]]s. Common examples include [[emulsifying wax]], [[polysorbate 20]], and [[ceteareth|ceteareth 20]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teachsoap.com/emulsifywax.html|title=Using Emulsifying Wax|accessdate=2008-07-22|author=Anne-Marie Faiola|date=2008-05-21|website=TeachSoap.com|publisher=TeachSoap.com}}</ref> \n\nSometimes the inner phase itself can act as an emulsifier, and the result is a '''nanoemulsion''', where the inner state disperses into \"[[nano-]]size\" droplets within the outer phase. A well-known example of this phenomenon, the \"[[Ouzo effect]]\", happens when water is poured into a strong alcoholic [[anise]]-based beverage, such as [[ouzo]], [[pastis]], [[absinthe]], [[Arak (distilled beverage)|arak]], or [[Rak\u0131|raki]]. The anisolic compounds, which are soluble in [[ethanol]], then form nano-size droplets and emulsify within the water. The resulting color of the drink is opaque and milky white.\n\n''See also: '''[[:simple:Emulsifier|food emulsifiers]]''' explained, in the Simple English Wikipedia''\n\n==Mechanisms of emulsification==\nA number of different chemical and physical processes and mechanisms can be involved in the process of emulsification:{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\n* Surface tension theory \u2013 according to this theory, emulsification takes place by reduction of interfacial tension between two phases\n* Repulsion theory \u2013 the emulsifying agent creates a film over one phase that forms globules, which repel each other. This repulsive force causes them to remain suspended in the dispersion medium\n* Viscosity modification \u2013 emulgents like [[Gum arabic|acacia]] and [[tragacanth]], which are hydrocolloids, as well as PEG (or [[polyethylene glycol]]), glycerine, and other polymers like CMC ([[carboxymethyl cellulose]]), all increase the viscosity of the medium, which helps create and maintain the suspension of globules of dispersed phase\n\n==Uses==\n\n===In food===\nOil-in-water emulsions are common in food products:\n* Crema (foam) in [[espresso]] \u2013 coffee oil in water (brewed coffee), unstable emulsion\n* [[Mayonnaise]] and [[Hollandaise sauce]]s \u2013 these are oil-in-water emulsions  stabilized with egg yolk [[lecithin]], or with other types of food additives, such as [[sodium stearoyl lactylate]]\n* [[Homogenized milk]] \u2013 an emulsion of milk fat in water, with milk proteins as the emulsifier\n* [[Vinaigrette]] \u2013 an emulsion of vegetable oil in vinegar, if this is prepared using only oil and vinegar (i.e., without an emulsifier), an unstable emulsion results\n\nWater-in-oil emulsions are less common in food, but still exist:\n* [[Butter]] \u2013 an emulsion of water in butterfat\n* [[Margarine]]\n\nOther foods can be turned into products similar to emulsions, for example [[meat emulsion]] is a suspension of meat in liquid that is similar to true emulsions.\n\n===Health care===\nIn [[pharmaceutics]], [[Hairstyling product|hairstyling]], [[personal hygiene]], and [[cosmetics]], emulsions are frequently used.

The smaller the droplet the greater the [[surface tension]] and thus the greater the force required to merge with other [[lipids]]. The oil is emulsified with detergents using a [[high-shear mixer]] to stabilize the emulsion so, when they encounter the lipids in the [[cell membrane]] or envelope of [[Cell envelope|bacteria]] or [[virus]]es, they force the lipids to merge with themselves. On a mass scale, in effect this disintegrates the membrane and kills the pathogen. The soybean oil emulsion does not harm normal human cells, or the cells of most other [[higher organisms]], with the exceptions of [[Spermatozoon|sperm cells]] and [[blood cells]], which are vulnerable to nanoemulsions due to the peculiarities of their membrane structures. For this reason, these nanoemulsions are not currently used [[intravenous]]ly (IV). The most effective application of this type of nanoemulsion is for the [[disinfection]] of surfaces. Some types of nanoemulsions have been shown to effectively destroy [[HIV-1]] and [[tuberculosis]] pathogens on non-[[porous]] surfaces.\n\n===In firefighting===\nEmulsifying agents are effective at extinguishing fires on small, thin-layer spills of flammable liquids ([[Fire classes|class B fire]]s). Such agents encapsulate the fuel in a fuel-water emulsion, thereby trapping the flammable vapors in the water phase. This emulsion is achieved by applying an [[Aqueous solution|aqueous]] surfactant solution to the fuel through a high-pressure nozzle. Emulsifiers are not effective at extinguishing large fires involving bulk/deep liquid fuels, because the amount of emulsifier agent needed for extinguishment is a function of the volume of the fuel, whereas other agents such as [[Fire-fighting foam|aqueous film-forming foam]] <!-- (AFFF) --> need cover only the surface of the fuel to achieve vapor mitigation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Principles of Fire Protection Chemistry and Physics |author=Friedman, Raymond |isbn= 978-0-87765-440-7|year=1998|publisher=[[Jones & Bartlett Learning]]}}</ref>\n\n===Chemical synthesis===\n{{main|Emulsion polymerization}}\nEmulsions are used to manufacture polymer dispersions \u2013 polymer production in an  emulsion 'phase' has a number of process advantages, including prevention of coagulation of product. Products produced by such polymerisations may be used as the emulsions \u2013 products including primary components for glues and paints.

During the [[Second World War]], he was [[Supreme Allied Commander]], [[South East Asia Command]] (1943\u20131946). He was the last [[Viceroy of India]] (1947) and the first Governor-General of independent [[Dominion of India|India]] (1947\u20131948).\n\nFrom 1954 to 1959, Mountbatten was [[First Sea Lord]], a position that had been held by his father, [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]], some forty years earlier. Thereafter he served as [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] until 1965, making him the longest-serving professional head of the British Armed Forces to date. During this period Mountbatten also served as [[Chairman of the NATO Military Committee]] for a year.\n\nIn 1979, Mountbatten, his grandson Nicholas, and two others were assassinated by a bomb set by members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], hidden aboard his fishing boat in [[Mullaghmore, County Sligo]], Ireland.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Mountbatten familia.jpg|left|thumbnail|Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, Prince Louis of Battenberg and their four children Princess Alice, Princess Louise, Prince George and Prince Louis.]]\nFrom the time of his birth at [[Frogmore House]] in the [[Home Park, Windsor|Home Park]], [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], [[Berkshire]] until 1917, when he and several other relations of [[King George V|King George&nbsp;V]] dropped their [[German Empire|German]] [[Royal and noble styles|styles and titles]], Mountbatten was known as [[His Serene Highness]] Prince Louis of [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]]. He was the youngest child and the second son of [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]] and his wife [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine]]. His maternal grandparents were [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse]], and [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]], who was a daughter of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].

His siblings were [[Princess Alice of Battenberg]] (mother of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]), [[Louise Mountbatten|Queen Louise of Sweden]], and [[George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven]].<ref name=burke/>\n\nYoung Mountbatten's nickname among family and friends was \"Dickie\", although \"Richard\" was not among his given names. This was because his great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, had suggested the nickname of \"Nicky\", but to avoid confusion with the many Nickys of the Russian Imperial Family (\"Nicky\" was particularly used to refer to [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], the last Tsar), \"Nicky\" was changed to \"Dickie\".{{r|life1942081763}}\n\nHe was baptised in the large drawing room of Frogmore House on 17 July 1900 by the [[Dean of Windsor]], [[Philip Eliot (priest)|Philip Eliot]].

As a [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] he served as the fifth [[Vice President of the United States]] from March 1813 until his death in November 1814.  He is known best for being the namesake of [[gerrymandering]], a process by which electoral districts are drawn with the aim of aiding the party in power, although its initial \"g\" has softened to {{IPAslink|d\u0292}} rather than the hard {{IPAslink|\u0261}} of his name.<ref>Elster, p. 224</ref>\n\nBorn into a wealthy merchant family, Gerry vocally opposed British colonial policy in the 1760s, and was active in the early stages of organizing the resistance in the [[American Revolutionary War]].  Elected to the [[Second Continental Congress]], Gerry signed both the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Articles of Confederation]].  He was one of three men who attended the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787 who refused to sign the [[United States Constitution]] because it did not then include a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].  After its ratification he was elected to the inaugural [[United States Congress]], where he was actively involved in drafting and passage of the Bill of Rights as an advocate of individual and state liberties.\n\nGerry was at first opposed to the idea of [[political parties]], and cultivated enduring friendships on both sides of the political divide between [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] and Democratic-Republicans.  He was a member of a diplomatic delegation to [[France]] that was treated poorly in the [[XYZ Affair]], in which Federalists held him responsible for a breakdown in negotiations.  Gerry thereafter became a Democratic-Republican, running unsuccessfully for [[Governor of Massachusetts]] several times before winning the office in 1810.  During his second term, the legislature approved new state senate districts that led to the coining of the word \"gerrymander\"; he lost the next election, although the state senate remained Democratic-Republican.  Chosen by Madison as his vice presidential candidate in 1812, Gerry was elected, but died a year and a half into his term.  He is the only signer of the Declaration of Independence who is buried in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\n==Early life==\nElbridge Gerry was born on July 17, 1744, in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]].  His father, Thomas Gerry, was a merchant operating ships out of Marblehead, and his mother, Elizabeth (Greenleaf) Gerry, was the daughter of a successful Boston merchant.<ref name=Purcell46>Purcell, p. 46</ref>  Gerry's first name came from John Elbridge, one of his mother's ancestors.<ref>Greenleaf, p. 77</ref>  Gerry's parents had eleven children in all, although only five survived to adulthood.  Of these, Elbridge was the third.<ref>Billias, p. 5</ref>  He was first educated by private tutors, and entered [[Harvard College]] shortly before turning fourteen.  After receiving a B.A. in 1762 and an M.A. in 1765, he entered his father's merchant business.  By the 1770s the Gerrys numbered among the wealthiest Massachusetts merchants, with trading connections in [[Spain]], the [[West Indies]], and along the North American coast.<ref name=Purcell46/><ref>Billias, p. 4</ref>  Gerry's father, who had emigrated from England in 1730, was active in local politics and had a leading role in the local militia.<ref>Billias, p. 3</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nGerry was from an early time a vocal opponent of [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliamentary]] efforts to tax the colonies after the [[French and Indian War]] ended in 1763.  In 1770 he sat on a Marblehead committee that sought to enforce importation bans on taxed British goods.  He frequently communicated with other Massachusetts opponents of British policy, including [[Samuel Adams]], [[John Adams]], [[Mercy Otis Warren]], and others.<ref name=Purcell46/>\n\nIn May 1772 he won election to the Great and General Court of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] (its legislative assembly).  There he worked closely with Samuel Adams to advance colonial opposition to Parliamentary colonial policies.  He was responsible for establishing Marblehead's [[committee of correspondence]], one of the first to be set up after that of [[Boston]].<ref>Austin, pp. 6\u201327</ref>  However, an incident of mob action prompted him to resign from the committee the next year.  Gerry and other prominent Marbleheaders had [[Essex Hospital|established a hospital]] for performing [[smallpox]] inoculations on [[Cat Island (Massachusetts)|Cat Island]]; because the means of transmission of the disease were not known at the time, fears amongst the local population led to protests which escalated into violence that wrecked the facilities and threatened the proprietors' other properties.<ref>Gilje, pp. 44\u201345</ref>\n\nGerry reentered politics after the [[Boston Port Act]] closed that city's port in 1774, and Marblehead became a port to which relief supplies from other colonies could be delivered.  As one of the town's leading merchants and Patriots, Gerry played a major role in ensuring the storage and delivery of supplies from Marblehead to Boston, interrupting those activities only to care for his dying father.  He was elected as a representative to the [[First Continental Congress]] in September 1774, but refused, still grieving the loss of his father.<ref>Billias, pp. 42\u201344</ref>\n\n==Congress and Revolution==\nGerry was elected to the provincial assembly, which reconstituted itself as the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]] after Governor [[Thomas Gage]] dissolved the body in October 1774.<ref>Billias, p. 46</ref>  He was assigned to its committee of safety, responsible for assuring that the province's limited supplies of weapons and gunpowder remained out of [[British Army]] hands.  His actions were partly responsible for the storage of weapons and ammunition in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]]; these stores were the target of the British raiding expedition that sparked the start of the [[American Revolutionary War]] with the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775.<ref>Billias, p. 49</ref>  (Gerry was staying at an inn at Menotomy, now [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Arlington]], when the British marched through on the night of April 18.)<ref>Billias, p. 52</ref>  During the [[Siege of Boston]] that followed, Gerry continued to take a leading role in supplying the nascent [[Continental Army]], something he would continue to do as the war progressed.<ref>Billias, pp. 55\u201356</ref>  He leveraged business contacts in [[France]] and Spain to acquire not just munitions, but supplies of all types, and was involved in the transfer of financial subsidies from Spain to Congress.  He sent ships to ports all along the American coast, and dabbled in financing [[privateering]] operations.<ref>Billias, pp. 124\u201330</ref>\n\n[[File:John Trumbull - John Adams - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Adams]] (portrait by [[John Trumbull]]) held Gerry in high regard.]]\nUnlike some merchants, there is no evidence that Gerry profiteered from this activity (he spoke out against it, and in favor of price controls), although his war-related merchant activities notably increased the family's wealth.<ref>Billias, pp. 56, 123</ref>  His gains were tempered to some extent by the precipitous decline in the value of paper currencies, which he held in large quantities and speculated in.<ref>Billias, pp. 134\u201335</ref>\n\nGerry served in the [[Second Continental Congress]] from February 1776 to 1780, when matters of the ongoing war occupied the body's attention.  He was influential in convincing a number of delegates to support passage of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in the debates held during the summer of 1776; John Adams wrote of him, \"If every Man here was a Gerry, the Liberties of America would be safe against the Gates of Earth and Hell.\"<ref name=SenateBio/>  He was implicated as a member of the so-called \"[[Conway Cabal]]\", a group of Congressmen and military officers who were dissatisfied with the performance of General [[George Washington]] during the [[Philadelphia campaign|1777 military campaign]].  However, Gerry took Pennsylvania leader [[Thomas Mifflin]], one of Washington's critics, to task early in the episode, and specifically denied knowledge of any sort of conspiracy against Washington in February 1778.<ref>Billias, pp. 76\u201377</ref>\n\nGerry's political philosophy was one of limited central government, and he regularly advocated for the maintenance of civilian control of the military. He held these positions fairly consistently throughout his political career (wavering principally on the need for stronger central government in the wake of the 1786\u201387 [[Shays's Rebellion]]) and was well known for his personal integrity.<ref>Billias, pp. 140, 152, 192</ref>  In later years he was against the idea of political parties, remaining somewhat distant from the developing [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] and [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] parties until later in his career.  It was not until 1800 that he would formally associate with the Democratic-Republicans in opposition to what he saw as attempts by the Federalists to centralize too much power in the national government.<ref>Billias, p. 105</ref>  In 1780 he resigned from the Continental Congress over the issue, and refused offers from the state legislature to return to the Congress.<ref>Billias, p. 101</ref>  He also refused appointment to the state senate, claiming he would be more effective in the state's lower chamber, and also refused appointment as a county judge, comparing the offer by Governor [[John Hancock]] to those made by royally appointed governors to benefit their political allies.<ref>Billias, p. 102</ref> He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1781.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter G|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterG.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116114129/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/Chapterg.pdf|archive-date=2014-01-16|dead-url=no|df=}}</ref>\n\nGerry was convinced to rejoin the [[Confederation Congress]] in 1783, when the state legislature agreed to support his call for needed reforms.<ref>Billias, p. 103</ref>  He served in that body until September 1785, during which time it met in [[New York City]].

In 1787 he purchased the [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] estate of the last royal lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, [[Thomas Oliver (Lieutenant Governor)|Thomas Oliver]], which had been confiscated by the state.  This {{convert|100|acre|ha|adj=on}} property, known as [[Elmwood (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Elmwood]], became the family home for the rest of Gerry's life.<ref name=Elmwood_NRHP>{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=66000364}}|title=National Register Nomination for Elmwood|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref>  He continued to own property in Marblehead, and bought a number of properties in other Massachusetts communities.  He also owned shares in the [[Ohio Company of Associates|Ohio Company]], prompting some political opponents to characterize him as an owner of vast tracts of western lands.<ref>Billias, p. 137</ref>\n\n==Constitutional Convention==\nGerry played a major role in the [[U.S. Constitutional Convention]], held in [[Philadelphia]] during the summer of 1787.<ref>Billias, p. 158</ref>  In its deliberations he consistently advocated for a strong delineation between state and federal government powers, with state legislatures shaping the membership of federal government positions.  Gerry's opposition to popular election of representatives was rooted in part by the events of Shays's Rebellion, a populist uprising in western Massachusetts in the year preceding the convention.  Despite this position, he also sought to maintain individual liberties by providing checks on government power that might abuse or limit those freedoms.<ref>Billias, pp. 153\u201354</ref>  He supported the idea that the [[United States Senate|Senate]] composition should not be determined by population; the view that it should instead be composed of equal numbers of members for each state prevailed in the [[Connecticut Compromise]].  The compromise was adopted on a narrow vote in which the Massachusetts delegation was divided, Gerry and [[Caleb Strong]] voting in favor.<ref>Billias, p. 178</ref>  Gerry further proposed that senators of a state, rather than casting a single vote on behalf of the state, instead vote as individuals.<ref>Billias, p. 182</ref>  Gerry was also vocal in opposing the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], which counted [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] as 3/5 of a person for the purposes of apportionment in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and gave southern states a decided advantage.<ref>Billias, p. 168</ref>\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30%\n|quote=Gerry's preference for a more highly centralized government throughout most of the Convention was not motivated by a desire for great social changes, but was intended rather to restrain such popular excesses as were evidenced in Shays's Rebellion. ...

Although he was unsuccessful in obtaining them for the lower house of Congress, Gerry did obtain such indirect elections for the U.S. Senate, whose members were to be elected by the state legislatures. Gerry also advanced numerous proposals for indirect elections of the President of the United States, most of them involving limiting the right to vote to the state governors and electors.<ref>https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2006/spring/gerry.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719195339/https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2006/spring/gerry.html |date=2017-07-19 }} \"A Founding Father in Dissent Elbridge Gerry Helped Inspire Bill of Rights in His Opposition to the Constitution\". National Archives.</ref>\n\n===Voting against proposed constitution===\nGerry was also unhappy about the lack of expression of any sort of individual liberties in the proposed constitution, and generally opposed proposals that strengthened the central government.  He was one of only three delegates who voted against the proposed constitution in the convention (the others were [[George Mason]] and [[Edmund Randolph]]), citing a concern about the convention's lack of authority to enact such major changes to the nation's system of government, and to the constitution's lack of \"[[federation|federal features]]\".<ref>Billias, p. 159, 200</ref>\n\n===State ratification; Bill of Rights===\nDuring the ratification debates that took place in the states following the convention, Gerry continued his opposition, publishing a widely circulated letter documenting his objections to the proposed constitution.<ref name=Billias209>Billias, p. 209</ref>  In this document he cited the lack of a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as his primary objection, but also expressed qualified approval of the constitution, indicating that he would accept it with some amendment.<ref>Billias, pp. 207\u201308</ref>  Strong pro-Constitution forces attacked him in the press, comparing him unfavorably to the Shaysites.  [[Henry Jackson (general)|Henry Jackson]] was particularly vicious: \"[Gerry has] done more injury to this country by that infamous Letter than he will be able to make atonement in his whole life\",<ref name=Billias209/> and [[Oliver Ellsworth]], a convention delegate from [[Connecticut]], charged him with deliberately courting the Shays faction.<ref>Billias, p. 212</ref>  One consequence of the furor over his letter was that he was not selected as a delegate to the Massachusetts ratifying convention,<ref>Billias, p. 211</ref> although he was later invited to attend by the convention's leadership.  The convention leadership was dominated by Federalists, and Gerry was not given any formal opportunity to speak; he left the convention after a shouting match with convention chair [[Francis Dana]].<ref>Billias, p. 213</ref>  The state ratified the constitution by a vote of 187 to 168.<ref>Billias, p. 214</ref>  The debate had the result of estranging Gerry from a number of previously friendly politicians, including chairman Dana and [[Rufus King]].<ref>Billias, pp. 207\u201308, 213</ref>\n\n==United States House of Representatives==\nAnti-Federalist forces nominated Gerry for governor in 1788, but he was predictably defeated by the popular incumbent John Hancock.<ref>Billias, p. 215</ref>  Following ratification, Gerry recanted his opposition to the Constitution, noting that a number of state ratifying conventions had called for amendments that he supported.<ref>Billias, p. 207</ref>  He was nominated by friends (over his own opposition to the idea) for a seat in the inaugural House of Representatives, where he then served two terms.<ref>Billias, pp. 216, 243</ref>\n\n[[File:Alexander Hamilton portrait by Ezra Ames-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gerry supported the economic policies of Federalist [[Alexander Hamilton]] (portrait by [[Ezra Ames]]).]]\nIn June 1789 Gerry proposed that Congress consider all of the proposed constitutional amendments that various state ratifying conventions had called for (notably those of [[Rhode Island]] and [[North Carolina]], which had at the time still not ratified the constitution).<ref>Billias, p. 229</ref>  In the debate that followed, he led opposition to some of the proposals, arguing that they did not go far enough in ensuring individual liberties.  He successfully lobbied for inclusion of [[freedom of assembly]] in the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and was a leading architect of the [[Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] protections against search and seizure.<ref>Billias, p. 231</ref>  He sought unsuccessfully to insert the word \"expressly\" into the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]], which might have more significantly limited the federal government's power.<ref>Billias, pp. 233\u201334</ref>  He was successful in efforts to severely limit the federal government's ability to control state militias.<ref>Billias, p. 232</ref> In tandem, with this protection, he had once argued against the idea of the federal government controlling a large [[standing army]], comparing it \u2013 most memorably and mischievously \u2013 to a standing [[human penis|penis]]: \"An excellent assurance of domestic tranquility, but a dangerous temptation to foreign adventure.\"<ref name=Isaacson>{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=Benjamin Franklin: An American Life|year=2003|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-684-80761-0|page=456|url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Benjamin-Franklin/Walter-Isaacson/9780684807614|access-date=2013-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519095515/http://books.simonandschuster.com/Benjamin-Franklin/Walter-Isaacson/9780684807614|archive-date=2013-05-19|dead-url=no|df=}}</ref>\n\nGerry vigorously supported [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s reports on public credit, including the assumption at full value of state debts, and supported Hamilton's new [[First Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]], positions consistent with earlier calls he had made for economic centralization.<ref>Billias, pp. 223, 237</ref>  Although he speculated in depreciated Continental bills of credit (the [[IOU (debt)|IOUs]] at issue), there is no evidence he participated in large-scale speculation that attended the debate when it took place in 1790, and he became a major investor in the new bank.<ref>Billias, pp. 240, 242</ref>  He used the floor of the House to speak out against aristocratic and monarchical tendencies he saw as threats to [[Republicanism in the United States|republican ideals]], and generally opposed laws and their provisions that he perceived as limiting individual and state liberties.  He opposed any attempt to give officers of the executive significant powers, specifically opposing establishment of the [[United States Treasury Department|Treasury Department]] because its head might gain more power than the President.<ref>Billias, p. 225</ref>  He opposed measures that strengthened the Presidency (such as the ability to fire cabinet officers), seeking instead to give the legislature more power over appointments.<ref>Billias, p. 226</ref>\n\nGerry did not stand for re-election in 1792, returning home to raise his children and care for his sickly wife.<ref>Billias, p. 243</ref>  He agreed to serve as a presidential elector for John Adams in the [[United States presidential election, 1796|1796 election]].<ref>Billias, p. 245</ref>  During Adams' term in office, Gerry maintained good relations with both Adams and Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]], hoping that the divided executive might lead to less friction.

It was seen by French leaders as signs of an Anglo-American alliance, and France had consequently stepped up seizures of American ships.<ref>Elkins and McKitrick, pp. 537\u201338</ref>  Adams chose Gerry, over his cabinet's opposition (on political grounds that Gerry was insufficiently Federalist), because of their long-standing relationship; Adams described Gerry as one of the \"two most impartial men in America\" (Adams himself being the other).<ref name=Ferling345>Ferling, p. 345</ref>\n\nGerry joined co-commissioners [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] and [[John Marshall]] in France in October 1797 and met briefly with Foreign Minister [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]].<ref>Stinchcombe, pp. 596\u201397</ref>  Some days after that meeting, the delegation was approached by three French agents (at first identified as \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\" in published papers, leading the controversy to be called the \"XYZ Affair\") who demanded substantial bribes from the commissioners before negotiations could continue.<ref>Billias, pp. 268\u201369</ref>  The commissioners refused, and sought unsuccessfully to engage Talleyrand in formal negotiations.<ref>Billias, pp. 272\u201375</ref>  Believing Gerry to be the most approachable of the commissioners, Talleyrand successively froze first Pinckney and then Marshall out of the informal negotiations, and they left France in April 1798.<ref>Stinchcombe, pp. 598\u2013613</ref>  Gerry, who sought to leave with them, stayed behind because Talleyrand threatened war if he left.<ref>Billias, p. 280</ref>  Gerry refused to make any significant negotiations afterward and left Paris in August.<ref>Billias, p. 283</ref>  By then dispatches describing the commission's reception had been published in the United States, raising calls for war.<ref>Ferling, pp. 354\u201357</ref> The undeclared naval [[Quasi-War]] (1798\u20131800) followed.<ref>Smith, p. 130</ref>  Federalists, notably Secretary of State [[Timothy Pickering]], accused Gerry of supporting the French and abetting the breakdown of the talks, while Adams and Republicans such as Thomas Jefferson supported him.<ref>Billias, pp. 289\u201393</ref>  The negative press damaged Gerry's reputation, and he was burned in effigy by protestors in front of his home.  He was only later vindicated, when his correspondence with Talleyrand was published.<ref name=P51_52/>  In response to the Federalist attacks on him, and because of his perception that the Federalist-led military buildup threatened republican values, Gerry formally joined the Democratic-Republican Party in early 1800, standing for election as [[Governor of Massachusetts]].<ref>Billias, pp. 289, 301</ref>\n\n==Governor of Massachusetts==\nFor four years Gerry unsuccessfully sought the governorship of Massachusetts.  His opponent in these races, Caleb Strong, was a popular moderate Federalist, whose party dominated the state's politics despite a national shift toward the Republicans.<ref>Buel, pp. 39\u201344</ref>  In 1803 Republicans in the state were divided, and Gerry only had regional support of the party.  He decided not to run in 1804, returning to semi-retirement<ref>Billias, pp. 304\u2013305</ref> and to deal with a personal financial crisis.  His brother Samuel Russell had mismanaged his own business affairs, and Gerry had propped him up by guaranteeing a loan that was due.  The matter ultimately ruined Gerry's finances for his remaining years.<ref>Billias, pp. 305\u201306</ref>\n\nRepublican [[James Sullivan (governor)|James Sullivan]] won the governor's seat from Strong in 1807, but his successor was unable to hold the seat in the 1809 election, which went to Federalist [[Christopher Gore]].<ref>Buel, pp. 73\u201382, 103\u201304</ref>  Gerry stood for election again in 1810 against Gore, and won a narrow victory.  Republicans cast Gore as an ostentatious British-loving [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] who wanted to restore the monarchy (his parents had remained [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyal]] during the Revolution), and Gerry as a patriotic American, while Federalists described Gerry as a \"French partizan\" and Gore as an honest man devoted to ridding the government of foreign influence.<ref>Billias, p. 313</ref>  A temporary lessening in the threat of war with Britain aided Gerry.<ref>Buel, pp. 104\u201307</ref>  The two battled again in 1811, with Gerry once again victorious in a highly acrimonious campaign.<ref>Buel, pp. 116\u201317</ref><ref>Formisano, p. 74</ref>\n\n[[File:The Gerry-Mander Edit.png|thumb|The word gerrymander (originally written Gerry-mander) was used for the first time in the ''[[Boston Gazette]]'' newspaper on March 26, 1812.<ref name=\"Griffith 1907 72\u201373\">Griffith, pp. 72\u201373</ref> Appearing with the term, and helping spread and sustain its popularity, was this political cartoon, which depicts a state senate district in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]] as a strange animal with claws, wings and a dragon-type head, satirizing the district's odd shape.]]\nGerry's first year as governor was less controversial than his second, because the Federalists controlled the state senate.  He preached moderation in the political discourse, noting that it was important that the nation present a unified front in its dealings with foreign powers.<ref>Buel, pp. 107\u201308</ref>  In his second term, with full Republican control of the legislature, he became notably more partisan, purging much of the state government of Federalist appointees. The legislature also enacted \"reforms\" of the court system that resulted in an increase in the number of judicial appointments, which Gerry filled with Republican partisans.  Infighting within the party and a shortage of qualified candidates, however, played against Gerry, and the Federalists scored points by complaining vocally about the partisan nature of the reforms.<ref>Buel, pp. 144\u201347</ref>\n\nOther legislation passed during Gerry's second year included a bill broadening the membership of Harvard's Board of Overseers to diversify its religious membership, and another that liberalized religious taxes.  The Harvard bill had significant political slant because the recent split between orthodox [[Congregationalist]]s and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] also divided the state to some extent along party lines, and Federalist Unitarians had recently gained control over the Harvard board.<ref>Formisano, p. 76</ref>\n\nIn 1812 the state adopted new constitutionally mandated electoral district boundaries.  The Republican-controlled legislature had created district boundaries designed to enhance their party's control over state and national offices, leading to some oddly shaped legislative districts.<ref name=\"Hart_3_458\">Hart, p. 3:458</ref>  Although Gerry was unhappy about the highly partisan districting (according to his son-in-law, he thought it \"highly disagreeable\"), he signed the legislation.  The shape of one of the state senate districts in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]] was compared to a [[Salamanders_in_folklore_and_legend|salamander]] by a local Federalist newspaper in a political cartoon, calling it a \"Gerry-mander\".<ref>Billias, p. 317</ref>  Ever since, the creation of such districts has been called [[gerrymander]]ing.<ref name=\"Hart_3_458\"/>  Gerry also engaged in partisan investigations of potential libel against him by elements of the Federalist press, further damaging his popularity with moderates.  The redistricting controversy, along with the libel investigation and the impending [[War of 1812]], contributed to Gerry's defeat in 1812 (once again at the hands of Caleb Strong, whom the Federalists had brought out of retirement).<ref>Buel, pp. 148\u201349</ref><ref name=\"Billias, p. 323\">Billias, p. 323</ref>  The gerrymandering of the state senate was a notable success in the 1812 election: the body was thoroughly dominated by Republicans, even though the house and the governor's seat went to Federalists by substantial margins.<ref name=\"Griffith 1907 72\u201373\"/>\n\n==Vice Presidency and death==\nGerry's financial difficulties prompted him to ask President [[James Madison]] for a federal position after his loss in the 1812 election (which was held early in the year).<ref name=\"Billias, p. 323\"/>  He was chosen by the Democratic-Republican party congress to be Madison's vice presidential running mate in the [[United States presidential election, 1812|1812 presidential election]], although the nomination was first offered to [[John Langdon (politician)|John Langdon]].  He was viewed as a relatively safe choice who would attract Northern votes but not pose a threat to James Monroe, who was thought likely to succeed Madison.  Madison easily won reelection, and Gerry took the oath of office at Elmwood in March 1813.<ref>Billias, p. 324</ref>  At that time the office of vice president was largely a sinecure; Gerry's duties included advancing the administration's agenda in Congress and dispensing patronage positions in New England.<ref>Billias, p. 327</ref> Gerry's actions in support of the [[War of 1812]] had a partisan edge: he expressed concerns over a possible Federalist seizure of Fort Adams (as Boston's [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Fort Independence]] was then known) as a prelude to Anglo-Federalist cooperation, and sought the arrest of printers of Federalist newspapers.<ref>Morison, p. 2:57</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Death}}\nOn November 23, 1814, he fell seriously ill while visiting [[Joseph Nourse]] of the Treasury Department,<ref>{{cite web|title=To John Adams from Rufus King, 23 November 1814|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-6352|website=archive.gov|accessdate=12 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518081248/http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-6352|archive-date=2015-05-18|dead-url=no|df=}}</ref> and died not long after returning to his home in the [[Seven Buildings]].<ref name=Billias329>Billias, p. 329</ref>  He is buried in the [[Congressional Cemetery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]],<ref>Purcell, p. 53</ref> with a memorial by [[John Frazee (sculptor)|John Frazee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?q=Frazee+John&start=20|title=Search results for: Frazee John, page 2 - Collections Search Center, Smithsonian Institution|website=collections.si.edu|access-date=2013-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000150/http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?q=Frazee+John&start=20|archive-date=2013-12-31|dead-url=no|df=}}</ref>  He is the only signer of the Declaration buried in the nation's capital.<ref>Roberts and Schmidt, p. 47</ref> The estate he left his wife and children was rich in land and poor in cash; he had managed to repay his brother's debts with his pay as vice president.<ref name=Billias329/> Aged 68 at the start of his Vice Presidency, he would be the oldest person to become Vice President until [[Charles Curtis]] in 1929.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Elbridge Gerry House.jpg|thumb|right|[[Elbridge Gerry House]] in Marblehead]]\nGerry is generally remembered for the use of his name in the word ''[[Gerrymandering|gerrymander]]'', for his refusal to sign the United States Constitution, and for his role in the XYZ Affair.

Encryption does not itself prevent interference, but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor. In an encryption scheme, the intended information or message, referred to as [[plaintext]], is encrypted using an encryption algorithm \u2013 a [[cipher]] \u2013 generating [[ciphertext]] that can be read only if decrypted. For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a [[pseudo-random]] encryption key generated by an algorithm. It is in principle possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key, but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the [[Key (cryptography)|key]] provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users.\n\n==Types==\n\n=== Symmetric key / Private key ===\n\nIn [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric-key]] schemes,<ref>[http://iaktueller.de/Collatz.py Symmetric-key encryption software]</ref> the encryption and decryption keys are the same. Communicating parties must have the same key in order to achieve secure communication.\n\n=== Public key ===\n[[File:Public key encryption keys.png|thumb|Illustration of how encryption is used within servers [[Public key encryption]].]]\n\nIn [[public-key encryption]] schemes, the encryption key is published for anyone to use and encrypt messages. However, only the receiving party has access to the decryption key that enables messages to be read.<ref>Bellare, Mihir. \"Public-Key Encryption in a Multi-user Setting: Security Proofs and Improvements.\" Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2000.

Standards for [[cryptographic software]] and [[Hardware encryption|hardware to perform encryption]] are widely available, but successfully using encryption to ensure security may be a challenging problem. A single error in system design or execution can allow successful attacks. Sometimes an adversary can obtain unencrypted information without directly undoing the encryption. See, e.g., [[traffic analysis]], [[TEMPEST]], or [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa.kaspersky.com/internet-security-center/threats/trojans#.VV3oaWDTvfY|title=What is a Trojan Virus - Malware Protection - Kaspersky Lab US|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[Digital signature]] and encryption must be applied to the ciphertext when it is created (typically on the same device used to compose the message) to avoid tampering; otherwise any node between the sender and the encryption agent could potentially tamper with it. Encrypting at the time of creation is only secure if the encryption device itself has not been tampered with.\n\n=== Data erasure ===\nConventional methods for [[data erasure|deleting data permanently]] from a storage device involve overwriting its whole content with zeros, ones or other patterns \u2013 a process which can take a significant amount of time, depending on the capacity and the type of the medium. Cryptography offers a way of making the erasure almost instantaneous. This method is called [[crypto-shredding]]. An example implementation of this method can be found on [[iOS]] devices, where the cryptographic key is kept in a dedicated 'Effaceable Storage'.<ref>[https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf iOS Security Guide]</ref> Because the key is stored on the same device, this setup on its own does not offer full confidentiality protection in case an unauthorised person gains physical access to the device.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Cryptography}}\n{{div col |colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Substitution cipher]]\n* [[Rotor machine|Rotor cipher machines]]\n<!--* [[MicroTokenization]]-->\n* [[Brute-force attack]]\n* [[Cold boot attack]]\n* [[Export of cryptography]]\n* [[Cyberspace Electronic Security Act]] (US)\n* [[Disk encryption]]\n* [[Key management]]\n* [[Information-theoretic security#Physical layer encryption|Physical Layer Encryption]]\n* [[Geo-blocking]]\n* [[Television encryption]]\n* [[Active Defense|Active defense]]\n* [[Cryptography]]\n* [[Tokenization (data security)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation | last = Fouch\u00e9 Gaines | first = Helen | author-link = Helen Fouch\u00e9 Gaines | title = Cryptanalysis: A Study of Ciphers and Their Solution | place = New York | publisher = Dover Publications Inc | year = 1939 | isbn = 978-0486200972 }}\n* [[David Kahn (writer)|Kahn, David]], ''The Codebreakers - The Story of Secret Writing'' ({{ISBN|0-684-83130-9}}) (1967)\n* [[Bart Preneel|Preneel, Bart]], \"Advances in Cryptology \u2014 EUROCRYPT 2000\", Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2000, {{ISBN|978-3-540-67517-4}}\n* [[Abraham Sinkov|Sinkov, Abraham]], ''Elementary Cryptanalysis: A Mathematical Approach'', Mathematical Association of America, 1966. {{ISBN|0-88385-622-0}}\n* {{Citation | last1 =Yehuda | first1 = Lindell|last2=Jonathan|first2=Katz | title = Introduction to modern cryptography | publisher =  Hall/CRC | year = 2014 | isbn =  978-1466570269 }}\n \n\n{{Wiktionary|encryption}}\n{{Commons category|Cryptographic algorithms|position=}}\n\n{{Cryptography navbox}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cryptography]]\n[[Category:Data protection]]\n\n[[es:Cifrado]]", "sha1": "jm7g3r76njraoak77j59xuv5ybmv8qo"}}, {"title": "EPR paradox", "ns": "0", "id": "10296", "revision": {"id": "866120540", "parentid": "864471729", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T11:19:50Z", "contributor": {"username": "Metaquanta", "id": "29673319"}, "comment": "/* Einstein's opposition */ added jstor link to reference", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n\n{{quantum}}\nThe '''Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen paradox''' or '''the EPR paradox'''<ref name=\"EPR\">{{cite journal | title = Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete? | date = 1935-05-15 | first = A | last = Einstein |author2=B Podolsky |author3=N Rosen  | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 47 | issue = 10 | pages = 777\u2013780 | url=http://www.drchinese.com/David/EPR.pdf |bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.47.777 }}</ref>\nof 1935 is a [[thought experiment]] in Physics which yields a dichotomy that explanation of physical reality according to Quantum Mechanics is Incomplete. In the article ''Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete?'', [[Albert Einstein]] and his colleagues [[Boris Podolsky]] and [[Nathan Rosen]] (EPR) attempted to mathematically show that the [[wave function]] does not contain complete information about physical reality, and hence the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is unsatisfactory; resolutions of the paradox have important implications for the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]].\n\nThe work was done at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton University in 1934, which Einstein [[Albert_Einstein#1933:_Emigration_to_the_US|had joined the prior year]] after he had fled Nazi Germany.\n\n[[File:Einstein.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Albert Einstein]]]] The essence of the paradox is that particles can interact in such a way that it is possible to measure both their position and their momentum more accurately than [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] allows, unless measuring one particle instantaneously affects the other to prevent this accuracy, which would involve information being transmitted faster than light as forbidden by the [[theory of relativity]] (\"[[action at a distance (physics)|spooky action at a distance]]\"). This consequence had not previously been noticed and seemed unreasonable at the time; the phenomenon involved is now known as [[quantum entanglement]].\n\nPer EPR, the paradox demonstrated that quantum theory was incomplete, and needed to be extended with [[hidden variable theory|hidden variables]]. One modern resolution is as follows: for two \"entangled\" particles created at once (e.g. an electron-positron pair from a photon), measurable properties have well-defined meaning only for the ensemble system. Properties of constituent subsystems (e.g. the individual electron or positron), considered individually, remain undefined. Therefore, if analogous measurements are performed on the two entangled subsystems, there will always be a correlation between the outcomes, and a well-defined global outcome for the ensemble. However, the outcomes for each subsystem, considered separately, at each repetition of the experiment, will not be well defined or predictable. This correlation does not imply that measurements performed on one particle influence measurements on the other. This modern resolution eliminates the need for hidden variables, action at a distance, or other schemes introduced over time, in order to explain the phenomenon.\n\nAccording to quantum mechanics, under some conditions, a pair of quantum systems may be described by a single [[wave function]], which encodes the probabilities of the outcomes of experiments that may be performed on the two systems, whether jointly or individually. At the time the EPR article discussed below was written, it was known from experiments that the outcome of an experiment sometimes cannot be uniquely predicted. An example of such indeterminacy can be seen when a beam of light is incident on a [[half-silvered mirror]]. One half of the beam will reflect, and the other will pass. If the intensity of the beam is reduced until only one photon is in transit at any time, whether that photon will reflect or transmit cannot be predicted quantum mechanically.\n\nThe routine explanation of this effect was, at that time, provided by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Physical quantities come in pairs called [[conjugate quantities]]. Examples of such conjugate pairs are (Position, momentum), (Time, energy), and (Angular position, angular momentum). When one quantity was measured, and became determined, the conjugated quantity became indeterminate. Heisenberg explained this uncertainty as due to the quantization of the disturbance from measurement.\n\nThe EPR paper, written in 1935, was intended to illustrate that this explanation is inadequate. It considered two [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles, referred to as A and B, and pointed out that measuring a quantity of a particle A will cause the conjugated quantity of particle B to become undetermined, even if there was no contact, no classical disturbance. The basic idea was that the quantum states of two particles in a system cannot always be decomposed from the joint state of the two, as is the case for the [[Bell state]], <math>|\\Phi^+\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|00\\rangle+|11\\rangle\\right).</math>\n\nHeisenberg's principle was an attempt to provide a classical explanation of a quantum effect sometimes called [[Quantum nonlocality|non-locality]]. According to EPR there were two possible explanations.  Either there was some interaction between the particles (Even though they were separated) or the information about the outcome of all possible measurements was already present in both particles.\n\nThe EPR authors preferred the second explanation according to which that information was encoded in some '[[Hidden variable theory#EPR paradox|hidden parameters]]'. The first explanation of an effect propagating instantly across a distance is in conflict with the [[theory of relativity]]. They then concluded that quantum mechanics was incomplete since its formalism does not permit hidden parameters.\n\nViolations of the conclusions of Bell's theorem are generally understood to have demonstrated that the hypotheses of Bell's theorem, also assumed by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, do not apply in our world.<ref name=Gaasbeek2010>{{cite arXiv |eprint= 1007.3977v1 |class=quant-ph|last= Gaasbeek |first= Bram |title= Demystifying the Delayed Choice Experiments |date= Jul 22, 2010}}</ref> Most physicists who have examined the issue concur that experiments, such as those of [[Alain Aspect]] and his group, have confirmed that physical probabilities, as predicted by quantum theory, do exhibit the phenomena of Bell-inequality violations that are considered to invalidate EPR's preferred \"local hidden-variables\" type of explanation for the correlations to which EPR first drew attention.<ref name=Bell1964>Bell, John.

Einstein had been skeptical of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the role of chance in quantum theory.  But the crux of this debate was not about chance, but something even deeper: Is there one objective physical reality, which every observer sees from his own vantage? (Einstein's view)  Or does the observer co-create physical reality by the questions he poses with experiments? (Bohr's view)\n\nEinstein struggled to the end of his life for a theory that could better comply with his idea of [[Causality (physics)|causality]], protesting against the view that there exists no objective physical reality other than that which is revealed through measurement interpreted in terms of quantum mechanical formalism. However, since Einstein's death, experiments analogous to the one described in the EPR paper have been carried out, starting in 1976 by French scientists Lamehi-Rachti and Mittig<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dkaCKHKLo3gC&pg=PA330&lpg=PA330&dq=%22Saclay%22+%22Bell%27s+inequality%22&source=bl&hl=en&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2 Advances in atomic and molecular physics, Volume 14 By David Robert Bates]</ref>  at the [[Saclay Nuclear Research Centre]].

Although disputed especially in the early twentieth century, it has yet to be seriously challenged. Philosophical interpretations of quantum phenomena, however, are another matter: the question of how to ''interpret'' the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics has given rise to a variety of different answers from people of different philosophical persuasions (see [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]]).\n\nQuantum theory and quantum mechanics do not provide single measurement outcomes in a deterministic way. According to the understanding of quantum mechanics known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], measurement causes an instantaneous collapse of the [[wave function]] describing the quantum system into an [[eigenstate]] of the [[observable]] that was measured. Einstein characterized this imagined collapse in the [[Solvay conference#Fifth Conference|1927 Solvay Conference]]. He presented a thought experiment in which electrons are introduced through a small hole in a sphere whose inner surface serves as a detection screen. The electrons will contact the spherical detection screen in a widely dispersed manner. Those electrons, however, are all individually described by wave fronts that expand in all directions from the point of entry. A wave as it is understood in everyday life would paint a large area of the detection screen, but the electrons would be found to impact the screen at single points and would eventually form a pattern in keeping with the probabilities described by their identical wave functions. Einstein asks what makes each electron's wave front \"collapse\" at its respective location. Why do the electrons appear as single bright scintillations rather than as dim washes of energy across the surface? Why does any single electron appear at one point rather than some alternative point? The behavior of the electrons gives the impression of some signal having been sent to all possible points of contact that would have nullified all but one of them, or, in other words, would have preferentially selected a single point to the exclusion of all others.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-epr/ The Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen Argument in Quantum Theory (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Einstein's opposition==\nEinstein was the most prominent opponent of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]]. In his view, quantum mechanics was incomplete. Commenting on this, other writers (such as [[John von Neumann]]<ref>von Neumann, J. (1932/1955).

The authors claim that given a specific experiment, in which the outcome of a measurement is known before the measurement takes place, there must exist something in the real world, an \"element of reality\", that determines the measurement outcome. They postulate that these elements of reality are [[principle of locality|local]], in the sense that each belongs to a certain point in [[spacetime]]. Each element may only be influenced by events which are located in the backward [[light cone]] of its point in spacetime (i.e., the past). These claims are founded on assumptions about nature that constitute what is now known as [[local realism]].\n\nThough the EPR paper has often been taken as an exact expression of Einstein's views, it was primarily authored by Podolsky, based on discussions at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] with Einstein and Rosen. Einstein later expressed to [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] that, \"it did not come out as well as I had originally wanted; rather, the essential thing was, so to speak, smothered by the formalism.\"<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Kaiser\n | first = David\n | title = Bringing the human actors back on stage: the personal context of the Einstein-Bohr debate\n | journal = British Journal for the History of Science\n | volume = 27\n | year = 1994\n | jstor = 4027432\n | p = 147\n}}</ref> In 1936, Einstein presented an individual account of his [[Principle of locality|local realist]] ideas.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Einstein |first1=Albert |year=1936 |title=Physik und realit\u00e4t |journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute |volume=221 |issue=3 |pages=313\u2013347 |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/S0016-0032(36)91045-1 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016003236910451 |accessdate=9 December 2012}} English translation by Jean Piccard, pp 349\u2013382 in the same issue, doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0016-0032(36)91047-5 10.1016/S0016-0032(36)91047-5]).</ref>\n\n== Description of the paradox ==\nThe original EPR paradox challenges the prediction of quantum mechanics that it is impossible to know both the position and the momentum of a quantum particle.

However, it is possible to measure the exact position of particle A. By calculation, therefore, with the exact position of particle A known, the exact position of particle B can be known. Alternatively, the exact momentum of particle A can be measured, so the exact momentum of particle B can be worked out. Kumar writes: \"EPR argued that they had proved that ... [particle] B can have simultaneously exact values of position and momentum. ... Particle B has a position that is real and a momentum that is real.\"<blockquote> EPR appeared to have contrived a means to establish the exact values of ''either'' the momentum ''or'' the position of B due to measurements made on particle A, without the slightest possibility of particle B being physically disturbed.<ref name=Kumar2011/>\n</blockquote>\nEPR tried to set up a paradox to question the range of true application of Quantum Mechanics: Quantum theory predicts that both values cannot be known for a particle, and yet the EPR thought experiment purports to show that they must all have determinate values. The EPR paper says: \"We are thus forced to conclude that the quantum-mechanical description of physical reality given by wave functions is not complete.\"<ref name=Kumar2011/>\n\nThe EPR paper ends by saying: <blockquote>While we have thus shown that the wave function does not provide a complete description of the physical reality, we left open the question of whether or not such a description exists. We believe, however, that such a theory is possible.</blockquote>\n\n=== Measurements on an entangled state ===\nWe have a source that emits electron\u2013positron pairs, with the electron sent to destination ''A'', where there is an observer named [[Alice and Bob|Alice]], and the positron sent to destination ''B'', where there is an observer named [[Alice and Bob|Bob]]. According to quantum mechanics, we can arrange our source so that each emitted pair occupies a quantum state called a [[spin singlet]]. The particles are thus said to be [[quantum entanglement|entangled]]. This can be viewed as a [[quantum superposition]] of two states, which we call state I and state II. In state I, the electron has [[spin (physics)|spin]] pointing upward along the ''z''-axis (''+z'') and the positron has spin pointing downward along the ''z''-axis (\u2212''z''). In state II, the electron has spin \u2212''z'' and the positron has spin +''z''. Because it is in a superposition of states it is impossible without measuring to know the definite state of spin of either particle in the spin singlet.<ref name=Griffiths2004>{{citation| author=Griffiths, David J.|title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (2nd ed.) | publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2004 |isbn= 0-13-111892-7}}</ref>{{rp|421\u2013422}}\n\n[[Image:EPR illustration.svg|thumb|500px|center|The EPR thought experiment, performed with electron\u2013positron pairs. A source (center) sends particles toward two observers, electrons to Alice (left) and positrons to Bob (right), who can perform spin measurements.]]\n\nAlice now measures the spin along the ''z''-axis. She can obtain one of two possible outcomes: +''z'' or \u2212''z''. Suppose she gets +''z''. According to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, the quantum state of the system [[wavefunction collapse|collapses]] into state I. The quantum state determines the probable outcomes of any measurement performed on the system. In this case, if Bob subsequently measures spin along the ''z''-axis, there is 100% probability that he will obtain \u2212''z''. Similarly, if Alice gets \u2212''z'', Bob will get +''z''.\n\nThere is, of course, nothing special about choosing the ''z''-axis: according to quantum mechanics the spin singlet state may equally well be expressed as a superposition of spin states pointing in the ''x'' direction.<ref name=Laloe>{{citation|last=Laloe|first=Franck|title=Do We Really Understand Quantum Mechanics| publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012| isbn = 978-1-107-02501-1|arxiv=quant-ph/0209123|bibcode=2002quant.ph..9123L}}</ref>{{rp|318}} Suppose that Alice and Bob had decided to measure spin along the ''x''-axis. We'll call these states Ia and IIa. In state Ia, Alice's electron has spin +''x'' and Bob's positron has spin \u2212''x''. In state IIa, Alice's electron has spin \u2212''x'' and Bob's positron has spin +''x''. Therefore, if Alice measures +''x'', the system 'collapses' into state Ia, and Bob will get \u2212''x''. If Alice measures \u2212''x'', the system collapses into state IIa, and Bob will get +''x''.\n\nWhatever axis their spins are measured along, they are always found to be opposite. This can only be explained if the particles are linked in some way.

Moreover, if the two particles have their spins measured about ''different'' axes, once the electron's spin has been measured about the ''x''-axis (and the positron's spin about the ''x''-axis deduced), the positron's spin about the ''z''-axis will no longer be certain, as if (a) it knows that the measurement has taken place, or (b) it has a definite spin already, about a ''second'' axis\u2014a hidden variable. However, it turns out that the predictions of Quantum Mechanics, which have been confirmed by experiment, cannot be explained by any local hidden variable theory. This is demonstrated in [[Bell's theorem]].<ref>George Greenstein and Arthur G. Zajonc, ''The Quantum Challenge'', p. \"[Experiments in the early 1980s] have conclusively shown that quantum mechanics is indeed orrect, and that the EPR argument had relied upon incorrect assumptions.\"</ref>\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the ''x''-spin and ''z''-spin are \"incompatible observables\", meaning the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] applies to alternating measurements of them: a quantum state cannot possess a definite value for both of these variables. Suppose Alice measures the ''z''-spin and obtains ''+z'', so that the quantum state collapses into state I. Now, instead of measuring the ''z''-spin as well, Bob measures the ''x''-spin. According to quantum mechanics, when the system is in state I, Bob's ''x''-spin measurement will have a 50% probability of producing +''x'' and a 50% probability of -''x''. It is impossible to predict which outcome will appear until Bob actually ''performs'' the measurement.\n\n'''Here is the crux of the matter:'''{{editorializing|date=November 2017}}\n\nYou might imagine that, when Bob measures the ''x''-spin of his positron, he would get an answer with absolute certainty, since prior to this he hasn't disturbed his particle at all.  <!-- Why would I imagine that? There seems to be no obvious link between the ''z''-axis and the ''x''-axis, hence no reason for the ''x''-axis to favour one direction over another. -->   But it turns out that Bob's positron has a 50% probability of producing +''x'' and a 50% probability of \u2212''x'', meaning the outcome is not certain. It's as if Bob's positron \"knows\" that Alice has measured the ''z''-spin of her electron, and hence his positron's own ''z''-spin must also be set, but its ''x''-spin remains uncertain.\n\nPut another way, how does Bob's positron know which way to point if Alice decides (based on information unavailable to Bob) to measure x (i.e., to be the opposite of Alice's electron's spin about the ''x''-axis) and ''also'' how to point if Alice measures z, since it is only supposed to know one thing at a time?  <!-- Is it too obvious to point out that in a spin singlet both particles have opposite spin? Therefore, Bob's particle will have the opposite ''x''-spin to Alice's. -->    The Copenhagen interpretation rules that say the wave function \"collapses\" at the time of measurement, so there must be action at a distance (entanglement) or the positron must know more than it's supposed to know (hidden variables).  <!-- To make the mixed part-quantum and part-classical descriptions of this experiment local, we have to say that the notebooks (and experimenters) are entangled and have linear combinations of + and \u2013 written in them, like [[Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat]]. -->\n\n'''Here is the paradox summed up:'''{{editorializing|date=November 2017}}\n\nIt is one thing to say that physical measurement of the first particle's momentum affects uncertainty in its ''own'' position, but to say that measuring the first particle's momentum affects the uncertainty in the position of the ''other'' is another thing altogether. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen asked how can the second particle \"know\" to have precisely defined momentum but uncertain position? Since this implies that one particle is communicating with the other instantaneously across space, i.e., faster than light, this is the \"paradox\".\n\nIncidentally, Bell used spin as his example, but many types of physical quantities\u2014referred to as \"observables\" in quantum mechanics\u2014can be used. The EPR paper used [[momentum]] for the observable. Experimental realisations of the EPR scenario often use [[photon polarization]], because polarized photons are easy to prepare and measure.\n\n=== Locality in the EPR experiment ===\nThe   principle of locality states that physical processes occurring at one place should have no immediate effect on the elements of reality at another location. At first sight, this appears to be a reasonable assumption to make, as it seems to be a consequence of [[special relativity]], which states that [[information]] can never be transmitted faster than the [[speed of light]] without violating [[causality (physics)|causality]]. It is generally believed that any theory which violates causality would also be internally inconsistent, and thus useless.<ref name=Griffiths2004/>{{rp|427\u2013428}}<ref name=Blaylock>{{Cite journal\n  | last =Blaylock\n  | first = Guy\n  | title = The EPR paradox, Bell's inequality, and the question of locality\n  | journal = American Journal of Physics\n  | volume = 78\n  | issue = 1\n  | pages = 111\u2013120\n  | date=January 2010\n  | arxiv = 0902.3827\n  | bibcode = 2010AmJPh..78..111B\n  | doi = 10.1119/1.3243279\n }}</ref>\n\nIt turns out that the usual rules for combining quantum mechanical and classical descriptions violate the principle of locality without violating causality.<ref name=Griffiths2004/>{{rp|427\u2013428}}<ref name=Blaylock/> Causality is preserved because there is no way for Alice to transmit messages (i.e., information) to Bob by manipulating her measurement axis. Whichever axis she uses, she has a 50% probability of obtaining \"+\" and 50% probability of obtaining \"\u2212\", completely at [[randomness|random]]; according to quantum mechanics, it is fundamentally impossible for her to influence what result she gets. Furthermore, Bob is only able to perform his measurement ''once'': there is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics, known as the \"[[no cloning theorem]]\", which makes it impossible for him to make a million copies of the electron he receives, perform a spin measurement on each, and look at the statistical distribution of the results. Therefore, in the one measurement he is allowed to make, there is a 50% probability of getting \"+\" and 50% of getting \"\u2212\", regardless of whether or not his axis is aligned with Alice's.\n\nHowever, the principle of locality appeals powerfully to physical intuition, and Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen were unwilling to abandon it. Einstein derided the quantum mechanical predictions as \"[[action at a distance (physics)|spooky action at a distance]]\". The conclusion they drew was that quantum mechanics is not a complete theory.<ref name=Bell1981>{{cite journal\n | last =Bell\n | first =John\n | title =Bertlmann's socks and the nature of reality\n | journal =J.

The word [[principle of locality|locality]] has several different meanings in physics. For example, in [[quantum field theory]] \"locality\" means that quantum fields at different points of space do not interact with one another. However, quantum field theories that are \"local\" in this sense ''appear'' to violate the [[principle of locality]] as defined by EPR, but they nevertheless do not violate locality in a more general sense.  [[Wavefunction collapse]] can be viewed as an epiphenomenon of [[quantum decoherence]], which in turn is nothing more than an effect of the underlying local time evolution of the wavefunction of a system and ''all'' of its environment.  Since the ''underlying'' behaviour doesn't violate local causality, it follows that neither does the additional effect of wavefunction collapse, whether real ''or'' apparent.  Therefore, as outlined in the example above, neither the EPR experiment nor any quantum experiment demonstrates that [[faster-than-light]] signaling is possible.\n\n== Resolving the paradox ==\n\n=== Hidden variables ===\nThere are several ways to resolve the EPR paradox. The one suggested by EPR is that quantum mechanics, despite its success in a wide variety of experimental scenarios, is actually an incomplete theory. In other words, there is some yet undiscovered theory of nature to which quantum mechanics acts as a kind of statistical approximation (albeit an exceedingly successful one). Unlike quantum mechanics, the more complete theory contains variables corresponding to all the \"elements of reality\". There must be some unknown mechanism acting on these variables to give rise to the observed effects of \"non-commuting quantum observables\", i.e. the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. Such a theory is called a [[hidden variable theory]].<ref name=Kumar2011/>{{rp|334}}<ref name=\"WheelerZurek2014\">{{cite book|author1=John Archibald Wheeler|author2=Wojciech Hubert Zurek|title=Quantum Theory and Measurement|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5455-4}}</ref>{{rp|357\u2013358}}\n\nTo illustrate this idea, we can formulate a very simple hidden variable theory for the above thought experiment. One supposes that the quantum spin-singlet states emitted by the source are actually approximate descriptions for \"true\" physical states possessing definite values for the ''z''-spin and ''x''-spin. In these \"true\" states, the positron going to Bob always has spin values opposite to the electron going to Alice, but the values are otherwise completely random. For example, the first pair emitted by the source might be \"(+''z'', \u2212''x'') to Alice and (\u2212''z'', +''x'') to Bob\", the next pair \"(\u2212''z'', \u2212''x'') to Alice and (+''z'', +''x'') to Bob\", and so forth. Therefore, if Bob's measurement axis is aligned with Alice's, he will necessarily get the opposite of whatever Alice gets; otherwise, he will get \"+\" and \"\u2212\" with equal probability.<ref name=Sakurai>{{Citation  | last1 = Sakurai  | first1 = J.

In reality, there may be an infinite number of axes along which Alice and Bob can perform their measurements, so there would have to be an infinite number of independent hidden variables. However, this is not a serious problem; we have formulated a very simplistic hidden variable theory, and a more sophisticated theory might be able to patch it up. It turns out that there is a much more serious challenge to the idea of hidden variables.\n\n==== Bell's inequality ====\n{{Main article|Bell's theorem}}\nIn 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that the predictions of quantum mechanics in the EPR thought experiment are significantly different from the predictions of a particular class of hidden variable theories (the ''local'' hidden variable theories). Roughly speaking, quantum mechanics has a much stronger statistical [[correlation]] with measurement results performed on different axes than do these hidden variable theories. These differences, expressed using [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality relations]] known as \"Bell's inequalities\", are in principle experimentally detectable. After the publication of Bell's paper, a variety of experiments to test Bell's inequalities were devised. These generally relied on measurement of [[photon polarization]]. All experiments conducted to date have found behavior in line with the predictions of standard quantum mechanics theory.\n\nLater work by [[Henry Stapp]] showed that a key property of local hidden variable theories which lead to Bell's inequalities was [[counter-factual definiteness]]. Building on Stapp's observations, P.H. Eberhard showed that any local counter-factual model results in Bell's inequality even without the assumption of there being hidden variables unknown to physics upon which the relevant observables depend. [[Arthur Fine]] subsequently showed that any theory satisfying the inequalities can be modeled by a local hidden variable theory. (Although Eberhard referred to his result as \"Bell's theorem without hidden variables\", Fine used a more general definition of \"hidden variables\" that includes the possibility of the observables being elementary.) Fine went on to show that any stochastic factorizable model leads to Bell's inequality. Itamar Pitowsky showed that Bell's inequality was a special case of an inequality discovered by George Boole which provides a consistency check on whether data can be represented by variables on a single classical probability space. He interpreted this to be an indication that the locality assumption prevented the data from being represented as events on such a space.<ref name=\"Pitowsky1989\">{{cite book | last=Pitowsky | first=Itamar | title=Bell\u2019s Theorem, Quantum Theory and Conceptions of the Universe | chapter=From George Boole To John Bell \u2014 The Origins of Bell\u2019s Inequality | publisher=Springer Netherlands | publication-place=Dordrecht | year=1989 | isbn=978-90-481-4058-9 | doi=10.1007/978-94-017-0849-4_6 | pages=37\u201349}}</ref>\n\nAs Eberhard's proof made use of both locality and counter-factual definiteness it was assumed that an interpretation could reject either one of these to escape Bell's inequality. Violation of locality is difficult to reconcile with [[special relativity]], and is thought to be incompatible with the principle of causality, nevertheless there was renewed interest in the [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics which keeps counter-factual definiteness while introducing a conjectured non-local mechanism in the form of the '[[quantum potential]]' that is defined as one of the terms of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Mainstream physics preferred to keep locality and reject counter-factual definiteness. Fine's work showed that, taking locality as a given, there exist scenarios in which two statistical variables are correlated in a manner inconsistent with counter-factual definiteness, and that such scenarios are no more mysterious than any other, despite the fact that the inconsistency with counter-factual definiteness may seem 'counter-intuitive'.\n\nFurther insights resulted from the work of Lawrence J. Landau. Landau showed that if it is assumed that there is a single classical probability space underlying all the observables under consideration in the EPR experiment, Bell's inequality will result.<ref name=landau87>{{cite journal |first=L. J.|last=Landau|title=On the violation of Bell\u2019s inequality in quantum theory|journal=[[Physics Letters]]|volume=120|issue=2|pages=4\u20136|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0375-9601(87)90075-2|year=1987|doi=10.1016/0375-9601(87)90075-2|bibcode=1987PhLA..120...54L}}</ref> Thus the fundamental issue is that Quantum mechanical probabilities cannot be modeled using classical (Kolmogorovian) probability regardless of whether Quantum Mechanics is considered a complete description of reality or not. Regarding Landau's proof [[Ray Streater]] notes that it shows that Bohmian mechanics is inconsistent with Quantum mechanics and succumbs to Bell's inequality despite claims to the contrary by its proponents. Streater notes that Landau's proof only requires the assumption of a single classical probability space (a condition still satisfied by Bohm's theory) and the fact that Bohmian mechanics additionally postulates the existence of a non-local mechanism, cannot prevent Bell's inequality from applying to it.<ref name=\"streater2007lost\">{{cite book|author1=Streater, R.F.|title=Lost Causes in and beyond Physics|date=2017|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540365822}}</ref>{{rp|99\u2013102}}\n\nSimilar observations have been made by Karl Hess, Walter, Philipp, Hans de Raedt and Kristel Michielsen, who note that in Bell's proof, Bell's assumption of a space of hidden variables behaving as a classical probability space is sufficient to produce a contradiction with the predications of Quantum mechanics via a consistency theorem of N.

It is a common misconception that quantum mechanics is inconsistent with all notions of philosophical realism. Realist interpretations of quantum mechanics are possible, although as discussed above, such interpretations must reject counter-factual definiteness. Examples of such realist interpretations are the [[consistent histories]] interpretation and the [[transactional interpretation]] (first proposed by [[John G. Cramer]] in 1986). Griffiths notes that it is not \"local realism\" that is ruled out by quantum mechanics but \"classical realism\".<ref name=\"Griffiths\"/>  Some workers in the field have also attempted to formulate hidden variable theories that exploit [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments|loopholes in actual experiments]], such as the assumptions made in interpreting experimental data, although no theory has been proposed that can reproduce all the results of quantum mechanics.\n\nAlternatives are still possible. A recent review article based on the [[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory|Wheeler\u2013Feynman time-symmetric theory]] rewrites the entire theory in terms of retarded [[Li\u00e9nard\u2013Wiechert potential]]s only, which becomes manifestly causal, and, establishes a conservation law for total generalized momenta held instantaneously for any closed system.<ref name=scott15>{{cite journal |first=T.

Examples have been suggested by [[David Bohm]] and by [[Lucien Hardy]].\n\n===Einstein's hope for a purely algebraic theory===\nThe [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics hypothesizes that the state of the universe evolves smoothly through time with no collapsing of quantum wavefunctions. One problem for the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is to precisely define wavefunction collapse. Einstein maintained that quantum mechanics is physically incomplete and logically unsatisfactory. In \"The Meaning of Relativity\", Einstein wrote, \"One can give good reasons why reality cannot at all be represented by a continuous field. From the quantum phenomena it appears to follow with certainty that a finite system of finite energy can be completely described by a finite set of numbers (quantum numbers). This does not seem to be in accordance with a continuum theory and must lead to an attempt to find a purely [[Local quantum field theory|algebraic theory]] for the representation of reality. But nobody knows how to find the basis for such a theory.\"\nIf time, space, and energy are secondary features derived from a substrate below the [[Planck scale]], then Einstein's hypothetical algebraic system might resolve the EPR paradox (although Bell's theorem would still be valid). If physical reality is totally finite, then the Copenhagen interpretation might be an approximation to an information processing system below the Planck scale.\n\n===\"Acceptable theories\" and the experiment===\nAccording to the present view of the situation, quantum mechanics flatly contradicts Einstein's philosophical postulate that any acceptable physical theory must fulfill  \"local realism\".\n\nIn the EPR paper (1935), the authors realised that quantum mechanics was inconsistent with their assumptions, but Einstein nevertheless thought that quantum mechanics might simply be augmented by hidden variables (i.e., variables which were, at that point, still obscure to him), without any other change, to achieve an acceptable theory. He pursued these ideas for over twenty years until the end of his life, in 1955.\n\nIn contrast, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]], in his 1964 paper, showed that quantum mechanics and the class of hidden variable theories Einstein favored<ref>{{cite journal | title = Clearing up mysteries: the original goal | url = http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmystery.pdf}}</ref> would lead to different experimental results: different by a factor of {{sfrac|3|2}} for certain correlations. So the issue of \"acceptability\", up to that time mainly concerning theory, finally became experimentally decidable.\n\nThere are many [[Bell test experiments]], e.g., those of [[Alain Aspect]] and others. They support the predictions of quantum mechanics rather than the class of hidden variable theories supported by Einstein.<ref name=Aspect1999/>\n\n=== Implications for quantum mechanics ===\nMost physicists today believe that quantum mechanics is correct, and that the EPR paradox is a \"paradox\" only because classical intuitions do not correspond to physical reality. How EPR is interpreted regarding locality depends on the [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] one uses.  In the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], it is usually understood that instantaneous [[wave function collapse]] does occur.  However, the view that there is no ''causal'' instantaneous effect has also been proposed within the Copenhagen interpretation: in this alternative view, measurement affects our ability to define (and measure) quantities in the physical system, not the system itself. In the [[many-worlds interpretation]], locality is strictly preserved, since the effects of operations such as measurement affect only the state of the particle that is measured.<ref name=Blaylock/>  However, the results of the measurement are not unique\u2014every possible result is obtained.\n\nThe EPR paradox has deepened our understanding of quantum mechanics by exposing the fundamentally non-classical characteristics of the [[measurement (quantum mechanics)|measurement]] process. Before the publication of the EPR paper, a measurement was often visualized as a physical disturbance that had to be inflicted ''directly'' upon the measured subsystem. For instance, when measuring the position of an electron, one imagines shining a light on it, thus disturbing the electron and producing the quantum mechanical uncertainties in its position. Such pat and convenient but unhelpful explanations of quantum mechanics remain commonplace today,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Furuta|first1=Aya|title=One Thing Is Certain: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle Is Not Dead|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heisenbergs-uncertainty-principle-is-not-dead/|accessdate=16 January 2017|work=Scientific American|quote=Yet the uncertainty principle comes in two superficially similar formulations that even many practicing physicists tend to confuse.

This follows from the principles of [[measurement in quantum mechanics]]. When ''S''<sub>z</sub> is measured, the system state \u03c8 collapses into an eigenvector of ''S''<sub>z</sub>.  If the measurement result is ''+z'', this means that immediately after measurement the system state undergoes an orthogonal projection of \u03c8 onto the\nspace of states of the form\n\n:<math> \\left| +z \\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left| \\phi\\right\\rangle \\quad \\phi \\in V </math>\n\nFor the spin singlet, the new state is\n\n:<math> \\left| +z \\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left| -z \\right\\rangle </math>\n\nSimilarly, if Alice's measurement result is \u2212''z'', the system undergoes an orthogonal projection onto\n\n:<math> \\left| -z \\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left| \\phi\\right\\rangle \\quad \\phi \\in V </math>\n\nwhich means that the new state is\n\n:<math> \\left|-z\\right\\rangle \\otimes \\left|+z\\right\\rangle </math>\n\nThis implies that the measurement for ''S''<sub>z</sub> for Bob's positron is now determined.  It will be \u2212''z'' in the first case or +''z'' in the second case.\n\nIt remains only to show that ''S<sub>x</sub>'' and ''S<sub>z</sub>'' cannot simultaneously possess definite values in quantum mechanics. One may show in a straightforward manner that no possible vector can be an [[eigenvector]] of both matrices. More generally, one may use the fact that the operators do not [[commutation relation|commute]],\n\n:<math>\\left[S_x, S_z\\right] = -i\\hbar S_y \\ne 0</math>\n\nalong with the Heisenberg uncertainty relation\n\n:<math>\n \\left\\langle {\\Delta S_x}^2 \\right\\rangle \\left\\langle {\\Delta S_z}^2 \\right\\rangle \\ge\n   \\frac{1}{4} \\left|\\left\\langle \\left[S_x, S_z\\right] \\right\\rang\\right|^2\n</math><!-- Yet, for the given state, $\\langle\\left[S_x,S_z\\right]\\rangle=\u2212i\\hbar\\langle S_y\\rangle=0$ and thus this relation will always be fulfilled!     -->\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bell test experiments]]\n* [[Bell's theorem]]\n* [[Bra\u2013ket notation]]\n* [[CHSH Bell test]]\n* [[Coherence (physics)]]\n* [[Correlation does not imply causation]]\n* [[Counter-factual definiteness]]\n* [[Einstein's thought experiments]]\n* [[ER=EPR]]\n* [[Ghirardi\u2013Rimini\u2013Weber theory]]\n* [[GHZ experiment]]\n* [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]]\n* [[Local hidden variable theory]]\n* [[Many-worlds interpretation]]\n* [[Measurement in quantum mechanics]]\n* [[Measurement problem]]\n* [[Penrose interpretation]]\n* [[Philosophy of information]]\n* [[Philosophy of physics]]\n* [[Popper's experiment]]\n* [[Quantum decoherence]]\n* [[Quantum entanglement]]\n* [[Quantum gravity]]\n* [[Quantum information]]\n* [[Quantum pseudo-telepathy]]\n* [[Quantum teleportation]]\n* [[Quantum Zeno effect]]\n* [[Sakurai's Bell inequality]]\n* [[Synchronicity]]\n* [[Wave function collapse]]\n* [[John Clive Ward|Ward's probability amplitude]]\n* [[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]]\n* [[Zero-point field]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Selected papers ===\n* P.

Also included are any names that have been commonly referenced historically, regardless of whether a name is considered official, politically correct or offensive; this allows more complete historic research to be done. These lists of names are not necessarily complete.\n\n==History==\nIn 1984, ''Ethnologue'' released a three-letter coding system, called an 'SIL code', to identify each language that it described. This set of codes significantly exceeded the scope of other standards, e.g. [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 639-2]].{{sfn|Everaert|2009|p=204}} The 14th edition, published in 2000, included 7,148 language codes.\n\nIn 2002, ''Ethnologue'' was asked to work with the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) to integrate its codes into a draft international standard. The 15th edition of ''Ethnologue'' was the first edition to use this standard, called [[ISO 639-3]]. This standard is now administered separately from Ethnologue (though still by SIL according to rules established by ISO, and since then ''Ethnologue'' relies on the standard to determine what is listed as a language).<ref name=\"ELL\">{{cite book | contribution = Ethnologue | first1 = Gary F. | last1 = Simons | first2 = Raymond G. | last2 = Gordon | volume = 4 | pages = 250\u2013253 | title = Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics | editor-first = Edward Kenneth | editor-last = Brown | edition = 2nd | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-08-044299-0|url=http://www-01.sil.org/~simonsg/preprint/ELL2%20Ethnologue.pdf}}</ref> In only one case, ''Ethnologue'' and the ISO standards treat languages slightly differently.  ISO 639-3 considers [[Akan language|Akan]] to be a [[ISO 639 macrolanguage|macrolanguage]] consisting of two distinct languages, [[Twi]] and [[Fante dialect|Fante]], whereas ''Ethnologue'' considers Twi and Fante to be dialects of a single language (Akan), since they are mutually intelligible. This anomaly resulted because the ISO 639-2 standard has separate codes for Twi and Fante, which have separate literary traditions, and all 639-2 codes for individual languages are automatically part of 639\u20133, even though 639-3 would not normally assign them separate codes.\n\nIn 2014, with the 17th edition, ''Ethnologue'' introduced a numerical code for language status using a framework called EGIDS (Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale), an elaboration of [[Joshua Fishman|Fishman's]] GIDS ([[Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale]]). It ranks a language from 0 for an [[World language|international language]] to 10 for an [[extinct language]], i.e. a language with which no-one retains a sense of ethnic identity.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/about/language-status |title=Language status |publisher=Ethnologue |date=2014 |accessdate=2015-01-24}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2015, ''Ethnologue'' launched a metered [[paywall]]; users in [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income countries]] who want to refer to more than seven pages of data per month must buy a [[paid subscription]].<ref>M.

The evaporation will continue until an equilibrium is reached when the evaporation of the liquid is the equal to its condensation. In an enclosed environment, a liquid will evaporate until the surrounding air is saturated.\n\nEvaporation is an essential part of the [[water cycle]]. The sun (solar energy) drives evaporation of water from oceans, lakes, [[soil moisture|moisture]] in the soil, and other sources of water. In [[hydrology]], evaporation and [[transpiration]] (which involves evaporation within plant [[stomata]]) are collectively termed [[evapotranspiration]]. Evaporation of water occurs when the surface of the liquid is exposed, allowing molecules to escape and form water vapor; this vapor can then rise up and form clouds. With sufficient energy, the liquid will turn into vapor.\n\n== Theory ==\n{{See also|Kinetic theory of gases}}\n\nFor [[molecule]]s of a liquid to evaporate, they must be located near the surface, they have to be moving in the proper direction, and have sufficient [[kinetic energy]] to overcome liquid-phase [[intermolecular force]]s.<ref name=\"Silberberg\">{{cite book |first=Martin A. |last=Silberberg |title=Chemistry |edition=4th |pages=431\u2013434 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-07-296439-1}}</ref> When only a small proportion of the molecules meet these criteria, the rate of evaporation is low. Since the kinetic energy of a molecule is proportional to its temperature, evaporation proceeds more quickly at higher temperatures. As the faster-moving molecules escape, the remaining molecules have lower average kinetic energy, and the temperature of the liquid decreases. This phenomenon is also called [[evaporative cooling]]. This is why evaporating [[sweat]] cools the human body.\nEvaporation also tends to proceed more quickly with higher flow rates between the gaseous and liquid phase and in liquids with higher [[vapor pressure]]. For example, laundry on a clothes line will dry (by evaporation) more rapidly on a windy day than on a still day. Three key parts to evaporation are heat, [[atmospheric pressure]] (determines the percent humidity), and air movement.\n\nOn a molecular level, there is no strict boundary between the liquid state and the vapor state. Instead, there is a [[Knudsen layer]], where the phase is undetermined. Because this layer is only a few molecules thick, at a macroscopic scale a clear phase transition interface cannot be seen. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nLiquids that do not evaporate visibly at a given temperature in a given gas (e.g., cooking oil at room [[temperature]]) have molecules that do not tend to transfer energy to each other in a pattern sufficient to frequently give a molecule the heat energy necessary to turn into vapor. However, these liquids ''are'' evaporating. It is just that the process is much slower and thus significantly less visible.\n\n=== Evaporative equilibrium ===\n\n[[Image:Water vapor pressure graph.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Vapor pressure of water vs. temperature. 760&nbsp;[[Torr]] = 1&nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]].]]\n\nIf evaporation takes place in an enclosed area, the escaping molecules accumulate as a [[vapor]] above the liquid. Many of the [[molecules]] return to the liquid, with returning molecules becoming more frequent as the [[density]] and [[pressure]] of the vapor increases. When the process of escape and return reaches an [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]],<ref name=\"Silberberg\" /> the vapor is said to be \"saturated\", and no further change in either [[vapor pressure]] and density or liquid temperature will occur. For a system consisting of vapor and liquid of a pure substance, this equilibrium state is directly related to the vapor pressure of the substance, as given by the [[Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relation]]:\n\n: <math>\\ln \\left( \\frac{ P_2 }{ P_1 } \\right) = - \\frac{ \\Delta H_{ vap } }{ R } \\left( \\frac{ 1 }{ T_2 } - \\frac{ 1 }{ T_1 }  \\right)</math>\n\n<!-- ## Original Equation ## ## DO NOT DELETE UNLESS THE ABOVE EQUATION IS VERIFIED TO BE CORRECT ## [[Natural logarithm|ln]] P<sub>2</sub>/P<sub>1</sub> = \u2212[[standard enthalpy change of vaporization|\u0394H<sub>vap</sub>]]/[[Universal gas constant|R]]((1/T<sub>2</sub>)-(1/T<sub>1</sub>)) -->\n\nwhere ''P''<sub>1</sub>, ''P''<sub>2</sub> are the vapor pressures at temperatures ''T''<sub>1</sub>, ''T''<sub>2</sub> respectively, \u0394''H''<sub>vap</sub> is the [[enthalpy of vaporization]], and ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]]. The rate of evaporation in an open system is related to the vapor pressure found in a closed system. If a liquid is heated, when the vapor pressure reaches the ambient pressure the liquid will [[boiling|boil]].\n\nThe ability for a molecule of a liquid to evaporate is based largely on the amount of [[kinetic energy]] an individual particle may possess. Even at lower temperatures, individual molecules of a liquid can evaporate if they have more than the minimum amount of kinetic energy required for vaporization.\n\n== Factors influencing the rate of evaporation ==\nNote: Air used here is a common example; however, the vapor phase can be other gases.\n\n;[[Concentration]] of the substance evaporating in the air: If the air already has a high concentration of the substance evaporating, then the given substance will evaporate more slowly.\n;Concentration of other substances in the air: If the air is already saturated with other substances, it can have a lower capacity for the substance evaporating.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n;Flow rate of air: This is in part related to the concentration points above. If \"fresh\" air (i.e., air which is neither already saturated with the substance nor with other substances) is moving over the substance all the time, then the concentration of the substance in the air is less likely to go up with time, thus encouraging faster evaporation. This is the result of the [[boundary layer]] at the evaporation surface decreasing with flow velocity, decreasing the diffusion distance in the stagnant layer.\n;The amount of minerals dissolved in the liquid\n;Inter-molecular forces: The stronger the forces keeping the molecules together in the liquid state, the more energy one must get to escape.  This is characterized by the [[enthalpy of vaporization]].\n;[[Pressure]]: Evaporation happens faster if there is less exertion on the surface keeping the molecules from launching themselves.\n;[[Surface area]]: A substance that has a larger surface area will evaporate faster, as there are more surface molecules per unit of volume that are potentially able to escape.\n;[[Temperature]] of the substance: the higher the temperature of the substance the greater the kinetic energy of the molecules at its surface and therefore the faster the rate of their evaporation.\n\nIn the US, the National Weather Service measures the actual rate of evaporation from a standardized \"pan\" open water surface outdoors, at various locations nationwide. Others do likewise around the world. The US data is collected and compiled into an annual evaporation map. The measurements range from under 30 to over {{convert|120|in|mm}} per year.\n\n==Thermodynamics==\n\nEvaporation is an [[endothermic process]], in that heat is absorbed during evaporation.\n\n== Applications ==\n* Industrial applications include many [[printing]] and [[coating]] processes; recovering salts from solutions; and drying a variety of materials such as lumber, paper, cloth and chemicals.\n* The use of evaporation to dry or concentrate samples is a common preparatory step for many laboratory analyses such as [[spectroscopy]] and [[chromatography]]. Systems used for this purpose include [[rotary evaporator]]s and [[centrifugal evaporator]]s.\n* When clothes are hung on a laundry line, even though the ambient temperature is below the boiling point of water, water evaporates. This is accelerated by factors such as low [[humidity]], heat (from the sun), and wind. In a [[clothes dryer]], hot air is blown through the clothes, allowing water to evaporate very rapidly.\n* The [[Matki (earthen pot)|Matki/Matka]], a traditional Indian porous clay container used for storing and cooling water and other liquids.\n* The [[botijo]], a traditional Spanish porous clay container designed to cool the contained water by evaporation.\n* [[Evaporative cooler]]s, which can significantly cool a building by simply blowing dry air over a filter saturated with water.\n\n=== Combustion vaporization ===\n\nFuel [[droplet]]s vaporize as they receive heat by mixing with the hot gases in the combustion chamber. Heat (energy) can also be received by radiation from any hot refractory wall of the combustion chamber.\n\n=== Pre-combustion vaporization ===\n\nInternal combustion engines rely upon the vaporization of the fuel in the cylinders to form a fuel/air mixture in order to burn well.\nThe chemically correct air/fuel mixture for total burning of gasoline has been determined to be 15 parts air to one part gasoline or 15/1 by weight. Changing this to a volume ratio yields 8000 parts air to one part gasoline or 8,000/1 by volume.\n\n=== Film deposition ===\n{{Main|Evaporation (deposition)}}\n\n[[Thin film]]s may be [[Thin-film deposition|deposited]] by evaporating a substance and condensing it onto a substrate, or by dissolving the substance in a solvent, spreading the resulting solution thinly over a substrate, and evaporating the solvent. The [[Hertz\u2013Knudsen equation]] is often used to estimate the rate of evaporation in these instances.\n\n== See also ==\n{{NSRW Poster}}\n* [[Atmometer]] (evaporation)\n* [[Boiling point]]\n* [[Cryophorus]]\n* [[Crystallisation]]\n* [[Desalination]]\n* [[Distillation]]\n* [[Drying]]\n* [[Eddy covariance]] flux (a.k.a. eddy correlation, eddy flux)\n* [[Evaporator]]\n* [[Evapotranspiration]]\n* [[Flash evaporation]]\n* [[Heat of vaporization]]\n* [[Hertz\u2013Knudsen equation]]\n* [[Hydrology (agriculture)]]\n* [[Latent heat]]\n* [[Latent heat flux]]\n* [[Pan evaporation]]\n* [[Sublimation (phase transition)]] (phase transfer from solid directly to gas)\n* [[Transpiration]]\n\n{{Table of phase transitions}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=Semiconductor Devices: Physics and Technology |first=Simon Min |last=Sze |isbn=0-471-33372-7}} Has an especially detailed discussion of film deposition by evaporation.\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|evaporation}}\n{{commonscatinline}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Atmospheric thermodynamics]]\n[[Category:Meteorological phenomena]]\n[[Category:Materials science]]\n[[Category:Phase transitions]]\n[[Category:Thin film deposition]]\n[[Category:Gases]]", "sha1": "e8c3zewq0t6g7hu2k05rz7y635uyjdi"}}, {"title": "Esbat", "ns": "0", "id": "10304", "revision": {"id": "852439024", "parentid": "780421314", "timestamp": "2018-07-29T00:50:42Z", "contributor": {"username": "Editor2020", "id": "6046894"}, "comment": "removed [[Category:Wicca]] using [[WP:HC|HotCat]] already in subcategory", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "An '''esbat''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u025b|s|b|\u00e6|t}} is a [[coven]] meeting at a time other than one of the [[Sabbats]]<ref name=\"Farrar\">{{cite book|last=Farrar|first=Janet and Stewart|title=The Witches' Way: Principles, Rituals and Beliefs of Modern Witchcraft|year=1984|isbn=0-919345-71-9|pages=320}}</ref> within [[Wicca]] and other Wiccan-influenced forms of [[contemporary Paganism]].

In other words, the ratios of the [[frequency|frequencies]] of any adjacent pair of notes is the same, and, as [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] is perceived roughly as the [[logarithm]] of frequency,<ref>{{cite web |last1=O'Donnell |first1=Michael |title=Perceptual Foundations of Sound |url=http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~odonnell/Scholar/Work_in_progress/Digital_Sound_Modelling/lectnotes/node4.html |accessdate=2017-03-11}}</ref> equal perceived \"distance\" from every note to its nearest neighbor.\n\nIn equal temperament tunings, the generating interval is often found by dividing some larger desired interval, often the [[octave]] (ratio 2:1), into a number of smaller equal steps (equal frequency ratios between successive notes).\n\nIn [[classical music]] and Western music in general, the most common tuning system since the [[18th century]] has been '''twelve-tone equal temperament''' (also known as '''12 equal temperament''', '''12-TET''' or '''12-ET'''), which divides the octave into 12 parts, all of which are equal on a [[logarithmic scale]], with a ratio equal to the 12th root of 2 ({{radic|2|12}} \u2248 1.05946). That resulting smallest interval, {{frac|12}} the width of an octave, is called a [[semitone]] or half step. In modern times, 12TET is usually tuned relative to a [[standard pitch]] of 440&nbsp;Hz, called [[A440 (pitch standard)|A440]], meaning one note, [[A (musical note)|A]], is tuned to 440 [[hertz]] and all other notes are defined as some multiple of semitones apart from it, either higher or lower in [[frequency]]. The standard pitch has not always been 440&nbsp;Hz. It has varied and generally risen over the past few hundred years.<ref>The History of Musical Pitch in Europe p493-511 Herman Helmholtz, Alexander J. Ellis ''On The Sensations of Tone'', Dover Publications, Inc., New York</ref>\n\nOther equal temperaments divide the octave differently. For example, some music has been written in [[19 equal temperament|19-TET]] and [[31 equal temperament|31-TET]].  Arabic music uses [[Arab tone system|24-TET]] as a notational convention. In [[Western world|Western countries]] the term ''equal temperament'', without qualification, generally means 12-TET. To avoid ambiguity between equal temperaments that divide the octave and those that divide some other interval (or that use an arbitrary generator without first dividing a larger interval), the term '''equal division of the octave''', or '''EDO''' is preferred for the former. According to this naming system, ''12-TET'' is called ''12-EDO'', ''31-TET'' is called ''31-EDO'', and so on.\n\nAn example of an equal temperament that finds its smallest interval by dividing an interval other than the octave into equal parts is the equal-tempered version of the [[Bohlen\u2013Pierce scale]], which divides the just interval of an octave and a fifth (ratio 3:1), called a \"tritave\" or a \"[[pseudo-octave]]\" in that system, into 13 equal parts.\n\nUnfretted [[string ensemble]]s, which can adjust the tuning of all notes except for [[Open string (music)|open strings]], and vocal groups, who have no mechanical tuning limitations, sometimes use a tuning much closer to [[just intonation]] for acoustic reasons. Other instruments, such as some [[Wind instruments|wind]], [[Keyboard instruments|keyboard]], and [[fret]]ted instruments, often only approximate equal temperament, where technical limitations prevent exact tunings. Some wind instruments that can easily and spontaneously bend their tone, most notably [[trombone]]s, use tuning similar to string ensembles and vocal groups.\n\n== History ==\nThe two figures frequently credited with the achievement of exact calculation of equal temperament are [[Zhu Zaiyu]] (also romanized as Chu-Tsaiyu. Chinese: {{lang|zh|\u6731\u8f09\u5809}}) in 1584 and [[Simon Stevin]] in 1585. According to Fritz A. Kuttner, a critic of the theory,<ref name=Kuttner163 /> it is known that \"Chu-Tsaiyu presented a highly precise, simple and ingenious method for arithmetic calculation of equal temperament mono-chords in 1584\" and that \"Simon Stevin offered a mathematical definition of equal temperament plus a somewhat less precise computation of the corresponding numerical values in 1585 or later.\" The developments occurred independently.<ref>Fritz A. Kuttner. \"Prince Chu Tsai-Y\u00fc's Life and Work: A Re-Evaluation of His Contribution to Equal Temperament Theory\", p.200, ''Ethnomusicology'', Vol. 19, No. 2 (May 1975), pp. 163\u2013206.</ref>\n\nKenneth Robinson attributes the invention of equal temperament to Zhu Zaiyu<ref name=Robinson>Kenneth Robinson: ''A critical study of Chu Tsai-y\u00fc's contribution to the theory of equal temperament in Chinese music''.

Among the 17th-century keyboard composers [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]] advocated equal temperament.

It is possible that when composers and theoreticians of earlier times wrote of the moods and \"colors\" of the keys, they each described the subtly different dissonances made available within a particular tuning method. However, it is difficult to determine with any exactness the actual tunings used in different places at different times by any composer.

It was a convenient fit for the existing keyboard design, and permitted total harmonic freedom at the expense of just a little impurity in every interval. This allowed greater expression through [[Modulation (music)|enharmonic modulation]], which became extremely important in the 18th century in music of such composers as [[Francesco Geminiani]], [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach]], [[Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach]] and [[Johann Gottfried M\u00fcthel]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe progress of equal temperament from the mid-18th century on is described with detail in quite a few modern scholarly publications: it was already the temperament of choice during the Classical era (second half of the 18th century),{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} and it became standard during the Early Romantic era (first decade of the 19th century),{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} except for organs that switched to it more gradually, completing only in the second decade of the 19th century.

Because the perceived identity of an interval depends on its [[ratio]], this scale in even steps is a [[geometric sequence]] of multiplications. (An [[arithmetic sequence]] of intervals would not sound evenly spaced, and would not permit transposition to different keys.) Specifically, the smallest [[Interval (music)|interval]] in an equal-tempered scale is the ratio:\n\n:''r''{{sup|''n''}} = ''p''\n:''r'' = {{radic|''p''|''n''}}\n\nwhere the ratio ''r'' divides the ratio ''p'' (typically the [[octave]], which is 2:1) into ''n'' equal parts. (''See [[#Twelve-tone equal temperament|Twelve-tone equal temperament]] below.'')\n\nScales are often measured in [[Cent (music)|cents]], which divide the octave into 1200 equal intervals (each called a cent). This [[logarithm]]ic scale makes comparison of different tuning systems easier than comparing ratios, and has considerable use in [[Ethnomusicology]]. The basic step in cents for any equal temperament can be found by taking the width of ''p'' above in cents (usually the octave, which is 1200 cents wide), called below ''w'', and dividing it into ''n'' parts:\n:''c'' = {{sfrac|''w''|''n''}}\n\nIn musical analysis, material belonging to an equal temperament is often given an [[Musical notation#Integer notation|integer notation]], meaning a single integer is used to represent each pitch. This simplifies and generalizes discussion of pitch material within the temperament in the same way that taking the [[logarithm]] of a multiplication reduces it to addition. Furthermore, by applying the [[modular arithmetic]] where the modulus is the number of divisions of the octave (usually 12), these integers can be reduced to [[pitch class]]es, which removes the distinction (or acknowledges the similarity) between pitches of the same name, e.g. ''c'' is 0 regardless of octave register. The [[MIDI]] encoding standard uses integer note designations.\n\n=== General formulas for the equal-tempered interval ===\n\n== Twelve-tone equal temperament ==\n{{anchor|12TET}}\n\nIn twelve-tone equal temperament, which divides the octave into 12 equal parts, the width of a [[semitone]], i.e. the [[Interval ratio|frequency ratio]] of the interval between two adjacent notes, is the [[twelfth root of two]]:\n\n:{{radic|2|12}} = 2{{sup|{{frac|1|12}}}} \u2248 1.059463\n\nThis interval is divided into 100 [[cent (music)|cents]].\n\nFrequency ratio can also be calculated by:\n\nExp(Ln(2)\u00f712)\u2248 1.059463\n\n=== Calculating absolute frequencies ===\n{{See also|Piano key frequencies}}\nTo find the frequency, ''P<sub>n</sub>'', of a note in 12-TET, the following definition may be used:\n\n:''P''{{sub|''n''}} = ''P''{{sub|''a''}}({{radic|2|12}}){{sup|(''n'' \u2212 ''a'')}}\n\nIn this formula ''P<sub>n</sub>'' refers to the pitch, or frequency (usually in [[hertz]]), you are trying to find. ''P<sub>a</sub>'' refers to the frequency of a reference pitch (usually [[A440 (pitch standard)|440Hz]]). ''n'' and ''a'' refer to numbers assigned to the desired pitch and the reference pitch, respectively. These two numbers are from a list of consecutive integers assigned to consecutive semitones. For example, A<sub>4</sub> (the reference pitch) is the 49th key from the left end of a piano (tuned to 440&nbsp;Hz), and C<sub>4</sub> ([[middle C]]) is the 40th key. These numbers can be used to find the frequency of C<sub>4</sub>:\n\n:''P''{{sub|40}} = 440({{radic|2|12}}){{sup|(40 \u2212 49)}} \u2248 261.626&nbsp;Hz\n\n=== Historical comparison ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

Because a perfect fifth is in 3:2 relation with its base tone, and this interval is covered in 7 steps, each tone is in the ratio of {{radic|{{frac|3|2}}|7}} to the next (100.28 cents), which provides for a perfect fifth with ratio of 3:2 but a slightly widened octave with a ratio of \u2248 517:258 or \u2248 2.00388:1 rather than the usual 2:1 ratio, because twelve perfect fifths do not equal seven octaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aredem.online.fr/aredem/page_cordier.html |title=Le temp\u00e9rament \u00e9gal \u00e0 quintes justes |last=Cordier |first=Serge |publisher=Association pour la Recherche et le D\u00e9veloppement de la Musique |language=French |accessdate=2010-06-02}}</ref> During actual play, however, the violinist chooses pitches by ear, and only the four unstopped pitches of the strings are guaranteed to exhibit this 3:2 ratio.\n\n==Other equal temperaments==<!--[[10 equal temperament]], etc. redirect directly here-->\n{{See also|Sonido 13}}\n\n=== 5 and 7 tone temperaments in ethnomusicology ===<!--[[7 equal temperament]] and [[5 equal temperament]] redirect directly here-->\n[[File:7-tet scale on C.png|thumb|300px|Approximation of 7-tet]]\n\nFive and seven tone equal temperament ('''5-TET''' {{audio|5-tet scale on C.mid|Play}} and '''7-TET'''{{audio|7-tet scale on C.mid|Play}} ), with 240 {{Audio|1 step in 5-et on C.mid|Play}} and 171 {{Audio|1 step in 7-et on C.mid|Play}} cent steps respectively, are fairly common.\n\nA [[Thai music|Thai]] xylophone measured by Morton (1974) \"varied only plus or minus 5 cents,\" from 7-TET.

It is now well-accepted that of the two primary tuning systems in gamelan music, [[slendro]] and [[pelog]], only slendro somewhat resembles five-tone equal temperament while pelog is highly unequal; however, Surjodiningrat et al. (1972) has analyzed pelog as a seven-note subset of nine-tone equal temperament (133-cent steps {{Audio|Semitone Maximus on C.mid|Play}}).\n\nA South American Indian scale from a pre-instrumental culture measured by Boiles (1969) featured 175-cent seven-tone equal temperament, which stretches the octave slightly as with instrumental gamelan music.\n\n5-TET and 7-TET mark the endpoints of the [[syntonic temperament]]'s valid tuning range, as shown in [[#Figure 1|Figure 1]].\n* In 5-TET the tempered perfect fifth is 720 cents wide (at the top of the tuning continuum), and marks the endpoint on the tuning continuum at which the width of the minor second shrinks to a width of 0 cents.\n* In 7-TET the tempered perfect fifth is 686 cents wide (at the bottom of the tuning continuum), and marks the endpoint on the tuning continuum, at which the minor second expands to be as wide as the major second (at 171 cents each).\n\n=== Various Western equal temperaments ===\n[[File:16-tet scale on C.png|400px|thumb|[[Easley Blackwood, Jr.|Easley Blackwood]]'s notation system for 16 equal temperament: intervals are notated similarly to those they approximate and there are fewer [[enharmonic]] equivalents.<ref>Myles Leigh Skinner (2007).

Because 24-EDO contains all of the pitches of 12-EDO plus new pitches halfway between each adjacent pair of 12-EDO pitches, they could employ the additional colors without losing any tactics available in 12-tone harmony. The fact that 24 is a multiple of 12 also made 24-EDO easy to achieve instrumentally by employing two traditional 12-EDO instruments purposely tuned a quarter-tone apart, such as two pianos, which also allowed each performer (or one performer playing a different piano with each hand) to read familiar 12-tone notation. Various composers including Charles Ives experimented with music for quarter-tone pianos.\n\n27-EDO is the smallest EDO that uniquely represents all intervals involving the first eight harmonics. It tempers out the [[septimal comma]] but not the [[syntonic comma]].\n\n[[58 equal temperament|29-TET]] is the lowest number of equal divisions of the octave that produces a better perfect fifth than 12-TET. Its major third is roughly as inaccurate as 12-TET; however, it is tuned 14 cents flat rather than 14 cents sharp. It tunes the 7th, 11th, and 13th harmonics flat as well, by roughly the same amount. This means intervals such as 7:5, 11:7, 13:11, etc., are all matched extremely well in 29-TET.\n\n31 tone equal temperament was advocated by [[Christiaan Huygens]] and [[Adriaan Fokker]]. 31-TET has a slightly less accurate fifth than 12-TET, but provides near-just major thirds, and provides decent matches for harmonics up to at least 13, of which the seventh harmonic is particularly accurate.\n\n[[34 equal temperament|34 EDO]] gives slightly less total combined errors of approximation to the 5-limit just ratios 3:2, 5:4, 6:5, and their inversions than 31 EDO does, although the approximation of 5:4 is worse. 34 EDO doesn't approximate ratios involving prime 7 well. It contains a 600-cent tritone, since it is an even-numbered EDO.\n\n[[41 equal temperament|41-TET]] is the second lowest number of equal divisions that produces a better perfect fifth than 12-TET. Its major third is more accurate than 12-ET and 29-ET, about 6 cents flat. It's not meantone, so it distinguishes 10:9 and 9:8, unlike 31edo. It is more accurate in 13-limit than 31edo.\n\n[[53 equal temperament|53-TET]] is better at approximating the traditional [[just intonation|just]] consonances than 12, 19 or 31-TET, but has had only occasional use. Its extremely good [[perfect fifth]]s make it interchangeable with an extended [[Pythagorean tuning]], but it also accommodates [[schismatic temperament]], and is sometimes used in [[Turkish music]] theory. It does not, however, fit the requirements of meantone temperaments, which put good thirds within easy reach via the cycle of fifths. In 53-TET, the very consonant thirds would be reached instead by using a Pythagorean diminished fourth (C-F{{music|b}}), as it is an example of [[schismatic temperament]], just like 41edo. \n\n[[72 equal temperament|72-TET]] approximates many [[just intonation]] intervals well, even into the 7-limit and 11-limit, such as 7:4, 9:7, 11:5, 11:6 and 11:7. 72-TET has been taught, written and performed in practice by [[Joe Maneri]] and his students (whose atonal inclinations typically avoid any reference to [[just intonation]] whatsoever). It can be considered an extension of 12 EDO because 72 is a multiple of 12. 72 EDO has a smallest interval that is six times smaller than the smallest interval of 12 EDO and therefore contains six copies of 12 EDO starting on different pitches. It also contains three copies of 24 EDO and two copies of 36 EDO, which are themselves multiples of 12 EDO. 72 EDO has also been criticized for its redundancy by retaining the poor approximations contained in 12-TET, despite not needing them for any lower limits of just intonation (e.g. 5-limit).\n\nOther equal divisions of the octave that have found occasional use include, [[15 equal temperament|15-TET]], [[17 equal temperament|17-TET]], [[19 equal temperament|19-TET]] and [[22 equal temperament|22-TET]].\n\n2, 5, 12, 41, 53, 306, 665 and 15601 are [[denominator]]s of first [[convergent (continued fraction)|convergents]] of log{{sub|2}}(3), so 2, 5, 12, 41, 53, 306, 665 and 15601 [[twelfth (disambiguation)#Music|twelfths]] (and [[fifth (disambiguation)#Music|fifths]]), being in correspondent equal temperaments equal to an integer number of octaves, are better approximation of 2, 5, 12, 41, 53, 306, 665 and 15601 [[just intonation|just]] twelfths/fifths than for any equal temperaments with less tones.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/665edo |title=665edo |publisher=xenoharmonic (microtonal wiki) |accessdate=2014-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=convergents%28log2%283%29%2C+10%29 |title=convergents(log2(3), 10) |publisher=[[WolframAlpha]] |accessdate=2014-06-18}}</ref>\n\n1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 29, 41, 53, 200... {{OEIS|A060528}} is the sequence of divisions of octave that provide better and better approximations of the perfect fifth.

Let the number of steps in a semitone be ''s'', and the number of steps in a tone be ''t''.\n\nThere is exactly one family of equal temperaments that fixes the semitone to any [[proper fraction]] of a whole tone, while keeping the notes in the right order (meaning that, for example, C, D, E, F, and F{{music|#}} are in ascending order if they preserve their usual relationships to C). That is, fixing ''q'' to a proper fraction in the relationship ''qt'' = ''s'' also defines a unique family of one equal temperament and its multiples that fulfil this relationship.\n\nFor example, where ''k'' is an integer, 12''k''-EDO sets ''q'' = {{frac|2}}, and 19''k''-EDO sets ''q'' = {{frac|3}}. The smallest multiples in these families (e.g. 12 and 19 above) has the additional property of having no notes outside the [[circle of fifths]]. (This is not true in general; in 24-EDO, the half-sharps and half-flats are not in the circle of fifths generated starting from C.) The extreme cases are 5''k''-EDO, where ''q'' = 0 and the semitone becomes a unison, and 7''k''-EDO, where ''q'' = 1 and the semitone and tone are the same interval.\n\nOnce one knows how many steps a semitone and a tone are in this equal temperament, one can find the number of steps it has in the octave. An equal temperament fulfilling the above properties (including having no notes outside the circle of fifths) divides the octave into 7''t'' \u2212 2''s'' steps, and the perfect fifth into 4''t'' \u2212 ''s'' steps. If there are notes outside the circle of fifths, one must then multiply these results by ''n'', which is the number of nonoverlapping circles of fifths required to generate all the notes (e.g. two in 24-EDO, six in 72-EDO). (One must take the small semitone for this purpose: 19-EDO has two semitones, one being {{frac|3}} tone and the other being {{frac|2|3}}.)\n\nThe smallest of these families is 12''k''-EDO, and in particular, 12-EDO is the smallest equal temperament that has the above properties. Additionally, it also makes the semitone exactly half a whole tone, the simplest possible relationship. These are some of the reasons why 12-EDO has become the most commonly used equal temperament. (Another reason is that 12-EDO is the smallest equal temperament to closely approximate 5-limit harmony, the next-smallest being 19-EDO.)\n\nEach choice of fraction ''q'' for the relationship results in exactly one equal temperament family, but the converse is not true: 47-EDO has two different semitones, where one is {{frac|7}} tone and the other is {{frac|8|9}}, which are not complements of each other like in 19-EDO ({{frac|3}} and {{frac|2|3}}). Taking each semitone results in a different choice of perfect fifth.\n\n== Related tuning systems ==\n\n=== Regular diatonic tunings ===\n\n{{anchor|Figure 1}}[[File:Rank-2 temperaments with the generator close to a fifth and period an octave.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Figure 1: The [[regular diatonic tuning]]s continuum, which include many notable \"equal temperament\" tunings (Milne 2007).<ref>Milne, A., Sethares, W.A. and Plamondon, J.,[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 \"Isomorphic Controllers and Dynamic Tuning: Invariant Fingerings Across a Tuning Continuum\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109143142/http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/comj.2007.31.4.15 |date=2016-01-09 }}, ''Computer Music Journal'', Winter 2007, Vol. 31, No. 4, Pages 15-32.</ref>]]\nThe diatonic tuning in twelve equal can be generalized to any regular diatonic tuning dividing the octave as a sequence of steps TTSTTTS (or a rotation of it) with all the T's and all the S's the same size and the S's smaller than the T's. In twelve equal the S is the semitone and is exactly half the size of the tone T. When the S's reduce to zero the result is TTTTT or a five-tone equal temperament, As the semitones get larger, eventually the steps are all the same size, and the result is in seven tone equal temperament. These two endpoints are not included as regular diatonic tunings.\n\nThe notes in a regular diatonic tuning are connected together by a cycle of seven tempered fifths. The twelve-tone system similarly generalizes to a sequence CDCDDCDCDCDD (or a rotation of it) of chromatic and diatonic semitones connected together in a cycle of twelve fifths. In this case, seven equal is obtained in the limit as the size of C tends to zero and five equal is the limit as D tends to zero while twelve equal is of course the case C = D.\n\nSome of the intermediate sizes of tones and semitones can also be generated in equal temperament systems. For instance if the diatonic semitone is double the size of the chromatic semitone, i.e. D = 2*C the result is nineteen equal with one step for the chromatic semitone, two steps for the diatonic semitone and three steps for the tone and the total number of steps 5*T + 2*S = 15 + 4 = 19 steps. The resulting twelve-tone system closely approximates to the historically important 1/3 comma meantone.\n\nIf the chromatic semitone is two-thirds of the size of the diatonic semitone, i.e. C = (2/3)*D, the result is thirty one equal, with two steps for the chromatic semitone, three steps for the diatonic semitone, and five steps for the tone where 5*T + 2*S = 25 + 6 = 31 steps. The resulting twelve-tone system closely approximates to the historically important 1/4 comma meantone.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Musical acoustics]] (the physics of music)\n* [[Music and mathematics]]\n* [[Microtuner]]\n* [[Microtonal music]]\n* [[Piano tuning]]\n* [[List of meantone intervals]]\n* [[Diatonic and chromatic]]\n* [[Electronic tuner]]\n* [[Musical tuning]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Cho, Gene Jinsiong.

His most important work, ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', was published in six volumes between 1776 and 1788 and is known for the quality and irony of its prose, its use of primary sources, and its open criticism of organised religion.<ref>The most recent and also the first critical edition, in three volumes, is that of David Womersley. For commentary on Gibbon's irony and insistence on primary sources whenever available, see Womersley, \"Introduction\". While the larger part of Gibbon's caustic view of Christianity is declared within the text of chapters XV and XVI, Gibbon rarely neglects to note its baleful influence throughout the remaining volumes of the ''Decline and Fall''.</ref>\n\n==Early life: 1737\u20131752==\nEdward Gibbon was born in 1737, the son of Edward and Judith Gibbon at Lime Grove, in the town of [[Putney]], [[Surrey]]. He had six siblings: five brothers and one sister, all of whom died in infancy. His grandfather, also named Edward, had lost all of his assets as a result of the [[South Sea Company|South Sea Bubble]] stock market collapse in 1720, but eventually regained much of his wealth. Gibbon's father was thus able to inherit a substantial estate.<ref>D. M. Low, ''Edward Gibbon. 1737\u20131794'' (London: Chatto & Windus, 1937), p. 7.</ref> One of his grandparents, Catherine Acton, descended from [[Sir Walter Acton, 2nd Baronet]].\n\nAs a youth, Gibbon's health was under constant threat. <!--this out til we find out where it is; he described himself as \"a weakly child.\" --> He described himself as \"a puny child, neglected by my Mother, starved by my nurse\". At age nine, he was sent to Dr. Woddeson's school at [[Kingston upon Thames]] (now [[Kingston Grammar School]]), shortly after which his mother died.  He then took up residence in the [[Westminster School]] boarding house, owned by his adored \"Aunt Kitty\", Catherine Porten.  Soon after she died in 1786, he remembered her as rescuing him from his mother's disdain, and imparting \"the first rudiments of knowledge, the first exercise of reason, and a taste for books which is still the pleasure and glory of my life\".<ref>Norton, ''Letters'', vol. 3, 10/5/[17]86, 45\u201348.</ref> By 1751, Gibbon's reading was already extensive and certainly pointed toward his future pursuits: [[Laurence Echard]]'s ''Roman History'' (1713), William Howel(l)'s ''An Institution of General History'' (1680\u201385), and several of the 65 volumes of the acclaimed ''[[Universal History (Sale et al)|Universal History from the Earliest Account of Time]]'' (1747\u20131768).<ref>Stephen, ''DNB'', p. 1130; Pocock, ''Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon'', 29\u201340. At age 14, Gibbon was \"a prodigy of uncontrolled reading\"; Gibbon himself admitted an \"indiscriminate appetite\". p. 29.</ref>\n\n==Oxford, Lausanne, and a religious journey: 1752\u20131758==\nFollowing a stay at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 1752 to improve his health, at the age of 15 Gibbon was sent by his father to [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he was enrolled as a [[gentleman-commoner]]. He was ill-suited, however, to the college atmosphere and later rued his 14 months there as the \"most idle and unprofitable\" of his life.  Because he himself says so in his autobiography, it used to be thought that his penchant for \"theological controversy\" (his aunt's influence) fully bloomed when he came under the spell of the deist or rationalist theologian [[Conyers Middleton]] (1683\u20131750), the author of ''Free Inquiry into the Miraculous Powers'' (1749). In that tract, Middleton denied the validity of such powers; Gibbon promptly objected, or so the argument used to run. The product of that disagreement, with some assistance from the work of Catholic Bishop [[Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet]] (1627\u20131704), and that of the Elizabethan Jesuit [[Robert Parsons (priest)|Robert Parsons]] (1546\u20131610), yielded the most memorable event of his time at Oxford: his conversion to Roman Catholicism on 8 June 1753.  He was further \"corrupted\" by the 'free thinking' deism of the playwright/poet couple [[David Mallet (writer)|David and Lucy Mallet]];<ref>Pocock, ''Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon''. for Middleton, see pp. 45\u201347; for Bossuet, p. 47; for the Mallets, p. 23; Robert Parsons [or Persons], ''A Christian directory: The first booke of the Christian exercise, appertaining to resolution'', (London, 1582). In his 1796 edition of Gibbon's ''Memoirs'', Lord Sheffield claims that Gibbon directly connected his Catholic conversion to his reading of Parsons.&nbsp; Womersley, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', p. 9.</ref> and finally Gibbon's father, already \"in despair,\" had had enough. David Womersley has shown, however, that Gibbon's claim to having been converted by a reading of Middleton is very unlikely, and was introduced only into the final draft of the \"Memoirs\" in 1792\u201393.<ref>Womersley, ''Gibbon and the 'Watchmen of the Holy City': The Historian and His Reputation, 1776\u20131815'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), as cited by G. M. Bowersock in ''The New York Review of Books'', 25 November 2010, p.&nbsp;56.</ref> Bowersock suggests that Gibbon fabricated the Middleton story retrospectively in his anxiety about the impact of the [[French Revolution]] and [[Edmund Burke]]'s claim that it was provoked by the French ''philosophes'', so influential on Gibbon.\n\nWithin weeks of his conversion, the adolescent was removed from Oxford and sent to live under the care and tutelage of Daniel Pavillard, Reformed pastor of [[Lausanne, Switzerland]]. It was here that he made one of his life's two great friendships, that of [[Jacques Georges Deyverdun]] (the French-language translator of [[Goethe]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''), and that of [[John Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield|John Baker Holroyd (later Lord Sheffield)]]. Just a year and a half later, after his father threatened to disinherit him, on Christmas Day, 1754, he reconverted to Protestantism. \"The various articles of the Romish creed,\" he wrote, \"disappeared like a dream\".<ref>John Murray (ed.). ''[https://archive.org/stream/autobiographies00gibbgoog?ref=ol#page/n12 The Autobiographies of Edward Gibbon]''.  (London: John Murray, 1896), p. 137.</ref> He remained in Lausanne for five intellectually productive years, a period that greatly enriched Gibbon's already immense aptitude for scholarship and erudition: he read Latin literature; travelled throughout Switzerland studying its cantons' constitutions; and studied the works of [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], [[John Locke]], [[Pierre Bayle]], and [[Blaise Pascal]].\n\n==Thwarted romance==\n[[File:Edward Gibbon by Henry Walton cleaned.jpg|thumb|upright|Edward Gibbon, by [[Henry Walton (English painter)|Henry Walton]]]]\nHe also met the one romance in his life: the daughter of the pastor of Crassy, a young woman named [[Suzanne Curchod]], who was later to become the wife of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s finance minister [[Jacques Necker]], and the mother of [[Anne Louise Germaine de Sta\u00ebl|Madame de Sta\u00ebl]]. The two developed a warm affinity; Gibbon proceeded to propose marriage,<ref>Norton, ''Biblio'', p. 2; &nbsp; ''Letters'', vol. 1, p. 396. a concise summary of their relationship is found at 396\u2013401.</ref> but ultimately wedlock was out of the question, blocked both by his father's staunch disapproval and Curchod's equally staunch reluctance to leave Switzerland. Gibbon returned to England in August 1758 to face his father. There could be no refusal of the elder's wishes. Gibbon put it this way: \"I sighed as a lover, I obeyed as a son.\"<ref>Murray, p. 239. The phrase, \"sighed [etc.]\" alludes to the play ''Polyeucte'' by \"the father of French tragedy,\" [[Pierre Corneille]]. Womersley, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', p. 11.</ref> He proceeded to cut off all contact with Curchod, even as she vowed to wait for him. Their final emotional break apparently came at [[Ferney]], France in early 1764, though they did see each other at least one more time a year later.<ref>Womersley, 11\u201312.</ref>\n\n==First fame and the grand tour: 1758\u20131765==\n[[File:Keep of Portchester Castle, 2008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Portchester Castle]] came under Gibbon's command for a brief period while he was an officer in the Hampshire militia.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodall|2008|p=38}}</ref>]]\nUpon his return to England, Gibbon published his first book, ''Essai sur l'\u00c9tude de la Litt\u00e9rature'' in 1761, which produced an initial taste of celebrity and distinguished him, in Paris at least, as a man of letters.<ref>In the ''Essai'', the 24-year-old boldly braved the reigning philosoph[e]ic fashion to uphold the studious values and practices of the ''\u00e9rudits'' (antiquarian scholars). Womersley, p. 11; and ''[[Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon#The Miscellaneous Works|The Miscellaneous Works]]'', First edition, vol. 2.</ref> From 1759 to 1770, Gibbon served on active duty and in reserve with the South Hampshire militia, his deactivation in December 1762 coinciding with the militia's dispersal at the end of the [[Seven Years' War]].<ref>Womersley, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', pp. 11, 12. Gibbon was commissioned a captain and resigned a lieutenant colonel, later crediting his service with providing him \"a larger introduction into the English world.\" There was further, the matter of a vast utility: \"The discipline and evolutions of a modern battalion gave me a clearer notion of the phalanx and the legion; and the captain of the Hampshire grenadiers (the reader may smile) has not been useless to the historian of the Roman empire.\" Murray, p. 190.</ref> The following year he embarked on the [[Grand Tour]], which included a visit to Rome. In his autobiography Gibbon vividly records his rapture when he finally neared \"the great object of [my] pilgrimage\":\n\n<blockquote>...at the distance of twenty-five years I can neither forget nor express the strong emotions which agitated my mind as I first approached and entered the ''eternal City''.  After a sleepless night, I trod, with a lofty step the ruins of the Forum; each memorable spot where Romulus ''stood'', or [[Cicero|Tully]] spoke, or Caesar fell, was at once present to my eye; and several days of intoxication were lost or enjoyed before I could descend to a cool and minute investigation.<ref>Murray, pp. 266\u2013267.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnd it was here that Gibbon first conceived the idea of composing a history of the city, later extended to the entire [[Roman Empire|empire]], a moment known to history as the \"Capitoline vision\":<ref>Pocock, \"Classical History,\" \u00b6 #2.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It was at Rome, on the fifteenth of October 1764, as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]], while the barefooted fryars were singing [[Vespers]] in the [[Santa Maria Aracoeli|temple]] of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the City first started to my mind.<ref>Murray, p. 302.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWomersley (''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', p.&nbsp;12) notes the existence of \"good reasons\" to doubt the statement's accuracy. Elaborating, Pocock (\"Classical History,\" \u00b6 #2) refers to it as a likely \"creation of memory\" or a \"literary invention\", given that Gibbon, in his autobiography, claimed that his journal dated the reminiscence to 15 October, when in fact the journal gives no date.\n\n==Early career: 1765\u20131776==\nIn June 1765, Gibbon returned to his father's house, and remained there until the latter's death in 1770.<ref>Cecil, Algernon. ''Six Oxford thinkers: Edward Gibbon, John Henry Newman, R.W. Church, James Anthony Froude, Walter Pater, Lord Morley of Blackburn.'' London: John Murray, 1909, p. 59.</ref> These years were considered by Gibbon as the worst five of his life, but he tried to remain busy by making early attempts towards writing full histories. His first historical narrative known as the ''History of Switzerland'', which represented Gibbon's love for Switzerland, was never published nor finished. Even under the guidance of Deyverdun (a German translator for Gibbons), Gibbon became too critical of himself, and completely abandoned the project, only writing 60 pages of text.<ref>Cecil, Algernon. ''Six Oxford thinkers: Edward Gibbon, John Henry Newman, R.W. Church, James Anthony Froude, Walter Pater, Lord Morley of Blackburn.'' London: John Murray, 1909, p. 60.</ref> However, after Gibbon's death, his writings on Switzerland's history were discovered and published by Lord Sheffield in 1815. Soon after abandoning his ''History of Switzerland'', Gibbon made another attempt towards completing a full history.\n\nHis second work, ''Memoires Litteraires de la Grande Bretagne'', was a two-volume set which described the literary and social conditions of England at the time, such as [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|Lord Lyttelton]]'s history of Henry II and [[Nathaniel Lardner]]'s ''The Credibility of the Gospel History''.<ref>Cecil, Algernon. ''Six Oxford thinkers: Edward Gibbon, John Henry Newman, R.W. Church, James Anthony Froude, Walter Pater, Lord Morley of Blackburn.'' London: John Murray, 1909, p. 61.</ref> Gibbon's ''Memoires Litteraires'' failed to gain any notoriety, and was considered a flop by fellow historians and literary scholars.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:Blue Plaque - Edward Gibbon.jpg|thumb|left|Blue plaque to Gibbon on [[Bentinck Street]], London]]\n\nAfter tending to his father's estate\u2014which was by no means in good condition\u2014there remained quite enough for Gibbon to settle fashionably in London at 7 [[Bentinck Street]], free of financial concern. By February 1773, he was writing in earnest, but not without the occasional self-imposed distraction. He took to London society quite easily, joined the better social clubs, including [[Samuel Johnson|Dr. Johnson]]'s [[The Club (dining club)|Literary Club]], and looked in from time to time on his friend Holroyd in Sussex. He succeeded [[Oliver Goldsmith]] at the Royal Academy as 'professor in ancient history' (honorary but prestigious). In late 1774, he was initiated as a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] of the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]].<ref>i.e., in London's ''Lodge of Friendship No. 3''. see [http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/gibbon_e/gibbon_e.html Gibbon's freemasonry].</ref>\n\nHe was also, perhaps least productively in that same year, 1774, returned to the House of Commons for [[Liskeard (UK Parliament constituency)|Liskeard]], Cornwall through the intervention of his relative and patron, [[Edward Craggs-Eliot, 1st Baron Eliot|Edward Eliot]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/gibbon-edward-1737-94|title= GIBBON, Edward (1737-94), of Bentinck St., London; Buriton, Hants; and Lenborough, Bucks|publisher= History of Parliament Online|accessdate = 10 May 2016}}</ref>  He became the archetypal back-bencher, benignly \"mute\" and \"indifferent,\" his support of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] ministry invariably automatic. Gibbon's indolence in that position, perhaps fully intentional, subtracted little from the progress of his writing. Gibbon lost the Liskeard seat in 1780 when Eliot joined the opposition, taking with him \"the Electors of Leskeard [who] are commonly of the same opinion as Mr. El[l]iot.\" (Murray, p.&nbsp;322.) The following year, owing to the good grace of Prime Minister [[Lord North]], he was again returned to Parliament, this time for [[Lymington (UK Parliament constituency)|Lymington]] on a by-election.<ref>Gibbon's Whiggery was solidly conservative: in favour of the propertied oligarchy while upholding the subject's rights under the rule of law; though staunchly against ideas such as the natural rights of man and popular sovereignty, what he referred to as \"the wild & mischievous system of Democracy\" (Dickinson, \"Politics,\" 178\u201379). Gibbon also served on the government's Board of Trade and Plantations from 1779 until 1782, when the Board was abolished. The subsequent promise of an embassy position in Paris ultimately aborted, serendipitously leaving Gibbon free to focus on his great project.</ref>\n\n==''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'': 1776\u20131788==\n{{Main|The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire}}\n\nAfter several rewrites, with Gibbon \"often tempted to throw away the labours of seven years,\" the first volume of what was to become his life's major achievement, ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', was published on 17 February 1776. Through 1777, the reading public eagerly consumed three editions, for which Gibbon was rewarded handsomely: two-thirds of the profits, amounting to approximately \u00a31,000.<ref>Norton, ''Biblio'', pp. 37, 45. Gibbon sold the copyrights to the remaining editions of volume 1 and the remaining 5 volumes to publishers Strahan & Cadell for \u00a38000.  The great ''History'' earned the author a total of about \u00a39000.</ref> Biographer [[Sir Leslie Stephen|Leslie Stephen]] wrote that thereafter, \"His fame was as rapid as it has been lasting.\"  And as regards this first volume, \"Some warm praise from [[David Hume]] overpaid the labour of ten years.\"\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=In a distant age and climate the tragic scene of the death of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hosein]] will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader.|source=\u2014 Edward Gibbon, ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gibbon |first1=Edward |title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Volume 5 |date=1911 |location=London |pages=391-392}}</ref>}}\n\nVolumes II and III appeared on 1 March 1781, eventually rising \"to a level with the previous volume in general esteem.\" Volume IV was finished in June 1784;<ref>Norton, ''Biblio'', pp. 49, 57.

By early 1787, he was \"straining for the goal\" and with great relief the project was finished in June. Gibbon later wrote:\n\n{{quote|It was on the day, or rather the night, of 27 June 1787, between the hours of eleven and twelve, that I wrote the last lines of the last page in a summer-house in my garden...I will not dissemble the first emotions of joy on the recovery of my freedom, and perhaps the establishment of my fame. But my pride was soon humbled, and a sober melancholy was spread over my mind by the idea that I had taken my everlasting leave of an old and agreeable companion, and that, whatsoever might be the future date of my history, the life of the historian must be short and precarious.<ref>Murray, [https://archive.org/stream/autobiographies00gibbgoog?ref=ol#page/n366 pp. 333\u2013334]</ref>}}\n\nVolumes IV, V, and VI finally reached the press in May 1788, their publication having been delayed since March so it could coincide with a dinner party celebrating Gibbon's 51st birthday (the 8th).<ref>Norton, ''Biblio'', p. 61.</ref> Mounting a bandwagon of praise for the later volumes were such contemporary luminaries as [[Adam Smith]], [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]], and [[Horace Walpole]]. Smith remarked that Gibbon's triumph had positioned him \"at the very head of [Europe's] literary tribe.\"{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nIn November of that year, he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], the main proposer being his good friend Lord Sheffield.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=2&dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27gibbon%27%29|title= Fellow Details|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate = 10 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Later years: 1789\u20131794==\nThe years following Gibbon's completion of ''The History'' were filled largely with sorrow and increasing physical discomfort. He had returned to London in late 1787 to oversee the publication process alongside [[John Baker-Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield|Lord Sheffield]]. With that accomplished, in 1789 it was back to Lausanne only to learn of and be \"deeply affected\" by the death of Deyverdun, who had willed Gibbon his home, La Grotte. He resided there with little commotion, took in the local society, received a visit from Sheffield in 1791, and \"shared the common abhorrence\" of the [[French Revolution]].\n\nIn a letter to Lord Sheffield on 5 February 1791, Gibbon praised Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'':\n\n{{quote|Burke's book is a most admirable medicine against the French disease, which has made too much progress even in this happy country. I admire his eloquence, I approve his politics, I adore his chivalry, and I can even forgive his superstition...The French spread so many lyes about the sentiments of the English nation, that I wish the most considerable men of all parties and descriptions would join in some public act declaring themselves satisfied with, and resolved to support, our present constitution.<ref>J.

His health began to fail critically in December, and at the turn of the new year, he was on his last legs.\n\nGibbon is believed to have suffered from an extreme case of scrotal swelling, probably a [[hydrocele testis]], a condition which causes the scrotum to swell with fluid in a compartment overlying either testicle.<ref>the term hydrocele specifies that the compartment is not connected to the peritoneal cavity, whereas the term [[inguinal hernia]] specifies a connecting passageway, however narrow. -ed.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1297297/pdf/jrsocmed00007-0052.pdf |title= 'Varnish the business for the ladies': Edward Gibbon's decline and fall|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=16 August 2012 |pmc=1297297 |pmid=10615283 |volume=92 |issue= 7|year=1999 |journal=J R Soc Med |pages=374\u201379 | last1 = Jellinek | first1 = EH}}</ref> In an age when close-fitting clothes were fashionable, his condition led to a chronic and disfiguring inflammation that left Gibbon a lonely figure.<!-- this is out until we find where it is. He was to write, \"I can recall only fourteen truly happy days in my life.\" Gibbon, ''Memoirs''.--><ref>After more than two centuries, the exact nature of Gibbon's ailment remains a bone of contention. [[Patricia Craddock]], in a very full and graphic account of Gibbon's last days, notes that Sir Gavin de Beer's medical analysis of 1949 \"makes it ''certain'' that Gibbon did ''not'' have a true hydrocele...and highly probable that he was suffering both from a 'large and irreducible hernia' and cirrhosis of the liver.\" Also worthy of note are Gibbon's congenial and even joking moods while in excruciating pain as he neared the end. Both authors report this late bit of Gibbonian bawdiness: \"Why is a fat man like a Cornish Borough? Because he never sees his member.\" see Womersley, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', p. 16;  Craddock, ''Luminous Historian'', 334\u2013342; and Beer, \"Malady.\"</ref> As his condition worsened, he underwent numerous procedures to alleviate the condition, but with no enduring success.  In early January, the last of a series of three operations caused an unremitting [[peritonitis]] to set in and spread, from which he died.\n\nThe \"English giant of the Enlightenment\"<ref>so styled by the \"unrivalled master of Enlightenment studies,\" historian Franco Venturi (1914\u20131994) in his ''Utopia and Reform in the Enlightenment'' (Cambridge: 1971), p. 132. See Pocock, ''Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon'', p. 6; x.</ref> finally succumbed at 12:45 pm, 16 January 1794 at age 56. He was buried in the Sheffield Mausoleum attached to the north transept of the Church of St Mary and St Andrew, [[Fletching, East Sussex]],<ref>[http://www.mmtrust.org.uk/mausolea/view/357/Sheffield_Mausoleum Sheffield Mausoleum]</ref> having died in Fletching while staying with his great friend, [[John Baker-Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield|Lord Sheffield]]. Gibbon's estate was valued at approx. \u00a326,000. He left most of his property to cousins. As stipulated in his will, Sheffield oversaw the sale of his library at auction to [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]] for \u00a3950.<ref>Womersley, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', 17\u201318.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nGibbon's work has been criticised for its scathing view of Christianity as laid down in chapters XV and XVI, a situation which resulted in the banning of the book in several countries. Gibbon's alleged crime was disrespecting, and none too lightly, the character of sacred Christian doctrine, by \"treat[ing] the Christian church as a phenomenon of general history, not a special case admitting supernatural explanations and disallowing criticism of its adherents\". More specifically, the chapters excoriated the church for \"supplanting in an unnecessarily destructive way the great culture that preceded it\" and for \"the outrage of [practising] religious intolerance and warfare\".<ref>Craddock, ''Luminous Historian'', p. 60; also see Shelby Thomas McCloy, ''Gibbon's Antagonism to Christianity'' (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1933). Gibbon, however, began chapter XV with what appeared to be a moderately ''positive'' appraisal of the Church's rise to power and authority. Therein he documented one primary and ''five'' secondary causes of the rapid spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire: primarily, \"the convincing evidence of the doctrine itself, and... the ruling providence of its great Author;\"  secondarily, \"exclusive zeal, the immediate expectation of another world, the claim of miracles, the practice of rigid virtue, and the constitution of the primitive church.\" (first quote, Gibbon in Craddock, ''Luminous Historian'', p. 61; second quote, Gibbon in Womersley, ''Decline and Fall'', vol. 1, ch. XV, p. 497.)</ref>\nGibbon, though assumed to be entirely anti-religion, was actually supportive to some extent, insofar as it did not obscure his true endeavour \u2013 a history that was not influenced and swayed by official church doctrine. Although the most famous two chapters are heavily ironical and cutting about religion, it is not utterly condemned, and its purported truth and rightness are upheld however thinly.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nGibbon, in letters to Holroyd and others, expected some type of church-inspired backlash, but the utter harshness of the ensuing torrents far exceeded anything he or his friends could possibly have anticipated. Contemporary detractors such as [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Richard Watson (bishop of Llandaff)|Richard Watson]] stoked the nascent fire, but the most severe of these attacks was an \"acrimonious\" piece by the young cleric, Henry Edwards Davis.<ref>Henry Edwards Davis, ''An Examination of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Chapters of Mr. Gibbon's'' History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (London: J. Dodsley, 1778).  [https://archive.org/details/anexaminationfi00davigoog online].</ref>\nGibbon subsequently published his ''Vindication'' in 1779, in which he categorically denied Davis' \"criminal accusations\", branding him a purveyor of \"servile plagiarism.\"<ref>See [[#Monographs by Gibbon|Gibbon monographs]].</ref> Davis followed Gibbon's ''Vindication'' with yet another reply (1779).\n\nGibbon's apparent antagonism to Christian doctrine spilled over into the Jewish faith, leading to charges of anti-Semitism.<ref>{{cite web|title=CFCA \u2013 The Coordination Forum for Countering Antisemitism|url=http://www.antisemitism.org.il/eng/Anti-Semitism|website=www.antisemitism.org.il}}</ref> For example, he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>From the reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius, the Jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of Rome, which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections. Humanity is shocked at the recital of the horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of Egypt, of Cyprus, and of Cyrene, where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives; and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation which was exercised by the arms of legions against a race of fanatics, whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman government, but also of humankind.<ref>Womersley, ed., ''Decline and Fall'', vol. 1, ch. XVI, p. 516. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/gibbon/02/daf02001.htm see online] Gibbon's first footnote here reveals even more about why his detractors reacted so harshly: ''In Cyrene, [the Jews] massacred 220,000 Greeks; in Cyprus, 240,000; in Egypt, a very great multitude.  Many of these unhappy victims were sawed asunder, according to a precedent to which David had given the sanction of his examples. The victorious Jews devoured the flesh, licked up the blood, and twisted the entrails like a girdle around their bodies. see Dion Cassius l. lxviii, p. 1145.'' As a matter of fact, this is a verbatim citation from [http://cojs.org/cojswiki/Dio_Cassius,_Historia_Romana_LXVIII,_32:1-3:_The_Jewish_Uprising Dio Cassius, Historia Romana LXVIII, 32:1\u20133: The Jewish Uprising]: ''Meanwhile the Jews in the region of Cyrene had put one Andreas at their head and were destroying both the Romans and the Greeks. They would cook their flesh, make belts for themselves of their entrails, anoint themselves with their blood, and wear their skins for clothing. Many they sawed in two, from the head downwards. Others they would give to wild beasts and force still others to fight as gladiators. In all, consequently, two hundred and twenty thousand perished. In Egypt, also, they performed many similar deeds, and in Cyprus under the leadership of Artemio. There, likewise, two hundred and forty thousand perished. For this reason no Jew may set foot in that land, but even if one of them is driven upon the island by force of the wind, he is put to death. Various persons took part in subduing these Jews, one being Lusius, who was sent by Trajan.''</ref></blockquote>\n\nGibbon is considered to be a son of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and this is reflected in his famous verdict on the history of the [[Middle Ages]]: \"I have described the triumph of barbarism and religion.\"<ref>Womersley, ''Decline and Fall'', vol. 3, ch. LXXI, p. 1068.</ref> However, politically, he aligned himself with the conservative Edmund Burke's rejection of the democratic movements of the time as well as with Burke's dismissal of the \"rights of man.\"<ref>Burke supported the ''American'' rebellion, while Gibbon sided with the ministry; but with regard to the ''French'' Revolution they shared a perfect revulsion. Despite their agreement on the FR, Burke and Gibbon \"were not specially close,\" owing to Whig party differences and divergent religious beliefs, not to mention Burke's sponsorship of the [[Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782]] which abolished, and therefore cost Gibbon his place on, the government's Board of Trade and Plantations in 1782. see Pocock, \"The Ironist,\" \u00b6: \"Both the autobiography....\"</ref>\n\nGibbon's work has been praised for its style, his piquant epigrams and its effective irony.  [[Winston Churchill]] memorably noted, \"I set out upon...Gibbon's ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' [and] was immediately dominated both by the story and the style. ...I devoured Gibbon. I rode triumphantly through it from end to end and enjoyed it all.\"<ref>Winston Churchill, ''My Early Life: A Roving Commission'' (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1958), p. 111.</ref> Churchill modelled much of his own literary style on Gibbon's. Like Gibbon, he dedicated himself to producing a \"vivid historical narrative, ranging widely over period and place and enriched by analysis and reflection.\"<ref>Roland Quinault, \"Winston Churchill and Gibbon,\" in ''Edward Gibbon and Empire'', eds. R.  McKitterick and R. Quinault (Cambridge: 1997), 317\u2013332, at p. 331; Pocock, \"Ironist,\" \u00b6: \"Both the autobiography....\"</ref>\n\nUnusually for the 18th century, Gibbon was never content with secondhand accounts when the primary sources were accessible (though most of these were drawn from well-known printed editions). \"I have always endeavoured,\" he says, \"to draw from the fountain-head; that my curiosity, as well as a sense of duty, has always urged me to study the originals; and that, if they have sometimes eluded my search, I have carefully marked the secondary evidence, on whose faith a passage or a fact were reduced to depend.\"<ref>Womersley, ''Decline and Fall'', vol. 2, Preface to Gibbon vol. 4, p. 520.</ref> In this insistence upon the importance of primary sources, Gibbon is considered by many to be one of the first modern historians:\n\n<blockquote>In accuracy, thoroughness, lucidity, and comprehensive grasp of a vast subject, the 'History' is unsurpassable. It is the one English history which may be regarded as definitive...Whatever its shortcomings the book is artistically imposing as well as historically unimpeachable as a vast panorama of a great period.<ref>Stephen, ''DNB'', p. 1134.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe subject of Gibbon's writing, as well as his ideas and style, have influenced other writers. Besides his influence on Churchill, Gibbon was also a model for [[Isaac Asimov]] in his writing of ''[[The Foundation Series|The Foundation Trilogy]]'', which he said involved \"a little bit of cribbin' from the works of Edward Gibbon\".<ref>Groat, Brian. \"[https://medium.com/self-starter/asimov-on-how-to-be-prolific-43ccd8042ccb Asimov on How to Be Prolific]\".

In Waugh's 1950 novel ''[[Helena (1950 novel)|Helena]]'', the early Christian author [[Lactantius]] worried about the possibility of \"'a false historian, with the mind of [[Cicero]] or [[Tacitus]] and the soul of an animal,' and he nodded towards the [[gibbon]] who fretted his golden chain and chattered for fruit.\"<ref>London: Chapman and Hall, 1950.

Stobart]], author of ''The Grandeur that was Rome'' (1911), wrote of Gibbon that \"The mere notion of empire continuing to decline and fall for five centuries is ridiculous...this is one of the cases which prove that History is made not so much by heroes or natural forces as by historians.\"{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Monographs by Gibbon==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''Essai sur l\u2019\u00c9tude de la Litt\u00e9rature'' (London: Becket & De Hondt, 1761).\n* ''Critical Observations on the Sixth Book of [Vergil's] {{'}}The Aeneid{{'}}'' (London: Elmsley, 1770).\n* ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''  (vol.

Its land borders were with [[India]] and [[Myanmar]], with a coastline on the [[Bay of Bengal]].\n\nEast Pakistan was renamed from [[East Bengal]] by the [[One Unit]] scheme of Prime Minister [[Mohammad Ali of Bogra]]. The [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956]] replaced the [[British monarchy]] with an [[Islamic republic]]. Bengali politician [[H. S. Suhrawardy]] served as the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] between 1956 and 1957. A Bengali bureaucrat [[Iskandar Mirza]] became the first [[President of Pakistan]]. The [[1958 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat]] brought general [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]] to power. Khan replaced Mirza as president and launched a crackdown against pro-democracy leaders. Khan enacted the [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962]] which ended universal suffrage. By 1966, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] emerged as the preeminent opposition leader in Pakistan and launched the [[six point movement]] for autonomy and democracy. The [[1969 uprising in East Pakistan]] contributed to Ayub Khan's overthrow. Another general, [[Yahya Khan]], usurped the presidency and enacted [[martial law]]. In 1970, a [[1970 Bhola cyclone|major tropical cyclone]] struck East Pakistan, causing major casualties. In the same year, Yahya Khan organized Pakistan's first federal general election. The [[Awami League]] emerged as the single largest party, followed by the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]]. The military junta stalled in accepting the results, leading to civil disobedience, the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] and the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1359141/special-report-the-breakup-of-pakistan-1969-1971|title=Special report: The Breakup of Pakistan 1969-1971}}</ref> East Pakistan seceded with the help of India.\n\nThe [[East Pakistan Provincial Assembly]] was the legislative body of the territory.\n\nDue to the strategic importance of East Pakistan, the Pakistani union was a member of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]]. The economy of East Pakistan grew at an average of 2.6% between 1960 and 1965. The federal government invested more funds and foreign aid in West Pakistan, even though East Pakistan generated a major share of exports. However, President Ayub Khan did implement significant industrialization in East Pakistan. The [[Kaptai Dam]] was built in 1965. The [[Eastern Refinery]] was established in [[Chittagong]]. [[Dacca]] was declared as the ''second capital'' of Pakistan and planned as the home of the national parliament. The government recruited American architect [[Louis Kahn]] to design the national assembly complex in Dacca.\n\n==History==\n\n===One Unit and Islamic Republic===\n[[File:Map of SEATO member countries - de.svg|thumb|East Pakistan was a key part of [[SEATO]]]]\n[[File:HSS and Eisenhower.jpg|thumb|Suhrawardy (middle) with US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]]]]\nIn 1955, Prime Minister [[Mohammad Ali Bogra]] implemented the [[One Unit]] scheme which merged the four western provinces into a single unit called West Pakistan while East Bengal was renamed as East Pakistan.\n\nPakistan ended its dominion status and adopted a [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|republican constitution]] in 1956, which proclaimed an Islamic republic. The populist leader H. S. Suhrawardy of East Pakistan was appointed as the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]]. As soon as he became the prime minister, Suhrawardy initiated a legal work reviving the joint electorate system. There was a strong opposition and resentment to the joint electorate system in West Pakistan. The Muslim League had taken the cause to the public and began calling for implementation of separate electorate system. In contrast to West Pakistan, the joint electorate was highly popular in East Pakistan. The tug of war with the Muslim League to establish the appropriate electorate caused problems for his government.\n\nThe constitutionally obliged National Finance Commission Program (NFC Program) was immediately suspended by Prime Minister Suhrawardy despite the reserves of the four provinces of the West Pakistan in 1956. Suhrawardy advocated for the USSR-based Five-Year Plans to centralize the national economy. In this view, the East Pakistan's economy was quickly centralized and all major economic planning shifted to West Pakistan.\n\nEfforts leading to centralizing the economy was met with great resistance in West Pakistan when the elite monopolist and the business community angrily refused to oblige to his policies. The business community in Karachi began its political struggle to undermine any attempts of financial distribution of the US$10 million ICA aid to the better part of the East Pakistan and to set up a consolidated national shipping corporation. In the financial cities of West Pakistan, such as Karachi, Lahore, Quetta, and Peshawar, there were series of major labour strikes against the economic policies of Suhrawardy supported by the elite business community and the private sector.\n\nFurthermore, in order to divert attention from the controversial One Unit Program, Prime Minister Suhrawardy tried to end the crises by calling a small group of investors to set up small business in the country. Despite many initiatives and holding off the NFC Award Program, Suhrawardy's political position and image deteriorated in the four provinces in West Pakistan. Many nationalist leaders and activists of the Muslim League were dismayed with the suspension of the constitutionally obliged NFC Program. His critics and Muslim League leaders observed that with the suspension of NFC Award Program, Suhrawardy tried to give more financial allocations, aids, grants, and opportunity to East-Pakistan than West Pakistan, including West Pakistan's four provinces. During the last days of his Prime ministerial years, Suhrawardy tried to remove the economic disparity between the Eastern and Western wings of the country but to no avail. He also tried unsuccessfully to alleviate the food shortage in the country.\n\nSuhrawardy strengthened relations with the United States by reinforcing Pakistani membership in the [[Central Treaty Organization]] and Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Suhrawardy also promoted relations with the [[People\u2019s Republic of China]].\nHis contribution in formulating the 1956 constitution of Pakistan was substantial as he played a vital role in incorporating provisions for civil liberties and universal adult franchise in line with his adherence to parliamentary form of liberal democracy.\n\n===Era of Ayub Khan===\n[[File:Queenelizabeth-chittagongG1.jpg|thumb|[[Elizabeth II]], seen here visiting Chittagong in 1961, was East Pakistan's queen until 1956.]]\nIn 1958, President [[Iskandar Mirza]] enacted martial law as part of a [[military coup]] by the [[Pakistan Army]]'s chief [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]]. Roughly after two weeks, President Mirza's relations with Pakistan Armed Forces deteriorated leading Army Commander General Ayub Khan relieving the president from his presidency and forcefully exiling President Mirza to the United Kingdom. General Ayub Khan justified his actions after appearing on national radio declaring that: \"the armed forces and the people demanded a clean break with the past...\". Until 1962, the martial law continued while Field Marshal Ayub Khan purged a number of politicians and civil servants from the government and replaced them with military officers. Ayub called his regime a \"revolution to clean up the mess of black marketing and corruption\". Khan replaced Mirza as president and became the country\u2019s [[Strongman (politics)|strongman]] for eleven years. Martial law continued until 1962 when the government of Field Marshal Ayub Khan commissioned a constitutional bench under Chief Justice of Pakistan Muhammad Shahabuddin, composed of ten senior justices, each five from East Pakistan and five from West Pakistan. On 6 May 1961, the commission sent its draft to President Ayub Khan. He thoroughly examined the draft while consulting with his cabinet.\n\nIn January 1962, the cabinet finally approved the text of the [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|new constitution]], promulgated by President Ayub Khan on 1 March 1962, which came into effect on 8 June 1962. Under the 1962 constitution, Pakistan became a [[presidential republic]]. [[Universal suffrage]] was abolished in favor of a system dubbed 'Basic Democracy'. Under the system, an [[electoral college]] would be responsible for electing the president and national assembly. The 1962 constitution created a gubernatorial system in West and East Pakistan. Each provinces ran their own separate provincial gubernatorial governments. The constitution defined a division of powers between the central government and the provinces. [[Fatima Jinnah]] received strong support in East Pakistan during her failed bid to unseat Ayub Khan in the [[Pakistani presidential election, 1965|1965 presidential election]].\n\nDacca was declared as the ''second capital'' of Pakistan in 1962. It was designated as the legislative capital and [[Louis Kahn]] was tasked with designing a national assembly complex. Dacca's population increased in the 1960s. Seven natural gas fields were tapped in the province. The petroleum industry developed as the Eastern Refinery was established in the port city of Chittagong.\n\n===Six Points===\n[[File:Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Announcing 6 Points At Lahore.jpg|thumb|[[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] announcing the Six Points]]\nIn 1966, Awami League leader [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] announced the [[six point movement]] in [[Lahore]]. The movement demanded greater provincial autonomy and the restoration of democracy in Pakistan. Rahman was indicted for [[treason]] during the [[Agartala Conspiracy Case]] after launching the six point movement. He was released in the [[1969 uprising in East Pakistan]], which ousted Ayub Khan from the presidency. Below includes the historical six points:-\n{{quote|\n* The Constitution should provide for a Federation of Pakistan in its true sense based on the [[Lahore Resolution]], and the parliamentary form of government with supremacy of a Legislature directly elected on the basis of universal adult franchise.\n* The federal government should deal with only two subjects: Defence and Foreign Affairs, and all other residual subjects should be vested in the federating states.\n* Two separate, but freely convertible currencies for two wings should be introduced; or if this is not feasible, there should be one currency for the whole country, but effective constitutional provisions should be introduced to stop the flight of capital from East to West Pakistan. Furthermore, a separate Banking Reserve should be established and separate fiscal and monetary policy be adopted for East Pakistan.\n* The power of taxation and revenue collection should be vested in the federating units and the federal centre would have no such power. The federation would be entitled to a share in the state taxes to meet its expenditures.\n* There should be two separate accounts for the foreign exchange earnings of the two wings; the foreign exchange requirements of the federal government should be met by the two wings equally or in a ratio to be fixed; indigenous products should move free of duty between the two wings, and the constitution should empower the units to establish trade links with foreign countries.\n* East Pakistan should have a separate military or paramilitary force, and Navy headquarters should be in East Pakistan.|}}\n\n===Final years===\n[[File:1971 Instrument of Surrender.jpg|thumb|Surrender of Pakistan]]\nAyub Khan was replaced by general [[Yahya Khan]] who became the [[Chief Martial Law Administrator]]. Khan organized the [[Pakistani general election, 1970]]. The [[1970 Bhola cyclone]] was one of the deadliest natural disasters of the 20th century. The cyclone claimed half a million lives. The disastrous effects of the cyclone caused huge resentment against the federal government. After a decade of military rule, East Pakistan was a hotbed of [[Bengali nationalism]]. There were open calls for [[self-determination]].\n\nWhen the federal general election was held, the Awami League emerged as the single largest party in the Pakistani parliament. The League won 167 out of 169 seats in East Pakistan, thereby crossing the half way mark of 150 in the 300-seat [[National Assembly of Pakistan]]. In theory, this gave the League the right to form a government under the [[Westminster]] tradition. But the League failed to win a single seat in West Pakistan, where the Pakistan Peoples Party emerged as the single largest party with 81 seats. The [[military junta]] stalled the transfer of power and conducted prolonged negotiations with the League. A [[civil disobedience]] movement erupted across East Pakistan demanding the convening of parliament. Rahman announced a struggle for independence from Pakistan during a speech on 7 March 1971. Between 7\u201326 March, East Pakistan was virtually under the popular control of the Awami League. On Pakistan's Republic Day on 23 March 1971, the first [[flag of Bangladesh]] was hoisted in many East Pakistani households. The [[Pakistan Army]] launched a crackdown on 26 March, including [[Operation Searchlight]] and the [[1971 Dhaka University massacre]]. This led to the [[Bangladeshi Declaration of Independence]].\n\nAs the Bangladesh Liberation War and the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]] continued for nine months, East Pakistani military units like the [[East Bengal Regiment]] and the [[Bangladesh Rifles|East Pakistan Rifles]] defected to form the [[Bangladesh Forces]]. The [[Provisional Government of Bangladesh]] allied with neighboring India which intervened in the final two weeks of the war and secured the [[surrender of Pakistan]].\n\n====Role of the Pakistani military====\nWith Ayub Khan ousted from office in 1969, Commander of the Pakistani Army, [[General Yahya Khan]] became the country's second ruling chief martial law administrator. Both Bhutto and [[Shaikh Mujibur Rahman|Mujib]] strongly disliked General Khan, but patiently endured him and his government as he had promised to hold an election in 1970. During this time, strong nationalistic sentiments in East Pakistan were perceived by the Pakistani Armed Forces and the central military government. Therefore, Khan and his military government wanted to divert the nationalistic threats and violence against non-East Pakistanis. The [[Evolution of Pakistan Eastern Command plan|Eastern Military High Command]] was under constant pressure from the Awami League, and requested an active duty officer to control the command under such extreme pressure. The high [[flag rank]] officers, junior officers and many high command officers from the Pakistan's Armed Forces were highly cautious about their appointment in East-Pakistan, and the assignment of governing East Pakistan and appointment of an officer was considered highly difficult for the Pakistan High Military Command.\n[[File:Yahya Khan (cropped version).jpg|left|thumb|[[Yahya Khan]]]]\n[[File:Zulfikar Ali Bhutto 1971.jpg|thumb|[[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] in 1971]]\nEast Pakistan's Armed Forces, under the [[military administration]]s of [[Major-General]] Muzaffaruddin and [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Sahabzada Yaqub Khan]], used an excessive amount of show of military force to curb the [[1969 uprising in East Pakistan|uprising]] in the province. With such action, the situation became highly critical and civil control over the province slipped away from the government. On 24 March, dissatisfied with the performance of his generals, Yahya Khan removed General Muzaffaruddin and General Yaqub Khan from office on 1 September 1969.<!-- Which 24 March or 1 September? --> The appointment of a military administrator was considered quite difficult and challenging with the crisis continually deteriorating. Vice-Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan, [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Naval Staff]] of [[Pakistan Navy]], had previously served as political and military adviser of East Pakistan to former [[President of Pakistan|President]] Ayub Khan. Having such a strong background in administration, and being an expert on East Pakistan affairs, General Yahya Khan appointed [[Vice-Admiral]] [[Syed Mohammad Ahsan]] as [[Martial law|Martial Law Administrator]], with absolute authority in his command. He was relieved as Chief of Naval Staff, and received extension from the government. On 1 September Admiral Ahsan assumed the command of the Eastern Military High Command, and became a unified commander of Pakistan Armed Forces in East Pakistan. Under his command, the Pakistani Armed Forces were removed from the cities and deployed along the border. The rate of violence in East Pakistan dropped, nearly coming to an end. Civil rule improved and stabilised in East Pakistan under Martial Law Administrator Admiral Ahsan's era.\n\nThe tense relations between East and West Pakistan reached a climax in 1970 when the Awami League, the largest East Pakistani political party, led by [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], (Mujib), won a landslide victory in the national elections in East Pakistan. The party won 160 of the 162 seats allotted to East Pakistan, and thus a majority of the 300 seats in the Parliament. This gave the Awami League the constitutional right to form a government without forming a coalition with any other party. Khan invited Mujib to [[Rawalpindi]] to take the charge of the office, and negotiations took place between the military government and the Awami Party. Bhutto was shocked with the results, and threatened his fellow [[Pakistan Peoples Party|Peoples Party]] members if they attended the inaugural session at the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]], famously saying he would \"break the legs\" of any member of his party who dared enter and attend the session. However, fearing East Pakistani separatism, Bhutto demanded Mujib to form a coalition government. After a secret meeting held in [[Larkana]], Mujib agreed to give Bhutto the office of presidency with Mujib as prime minister. General Yahya Khan and his military government were kept unaware of these developments and under pressure from his own military government, refused to allow Rahman to become the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]]. This increased agitation for greater autonomy in East Pakistan. The Military Police arrested Mujib and Bhutto and placed them in [[Adiala Jail]] in Rawalpindi. The news spread like a fire in both East and West Pakistan, and the struggle for independence began in East Pakistan.\n\nThe senior high command officers in Pakistan Armed Forces, and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, began to pressure General Yahya Khan to take armed action against Mujib and his party. Bhutto later distanced himself from Yahya Khan after he was arrested by Military Police along with Mujib. Soon after the arrests, a high level meeting was chaired by Yahya Khan. During the meeting, high commanders of Pakistan Armed Forces unanimously recommended an armed and violent military action. East Pakistan's Martial Law Administrator [[Vice Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan|Admiral Ahsan]], unified commander of Eastern Military High Command (EMHC), and Air Marshal [[Mitty Masud]], Commander of Eastern Air Force Command (EAFC), were the only officers to object to the plans. When it became obvious that a military action in East Pakistan was inevitable, Admiral Ahsan resigned from his position as martial law administrator in protest, and immediately flew back to [[Karachi]], West Pakistan. Disheartened and isolated, Admiral Ahsan took early retirement from the Navy and quietly settled in Karachi. Once [[Operation Searchlight]] and [[Operation Barisal]] commenced, Air Marshal Masud flew to West Pakistan, and unlike Admiral Ahsan, tried to stop the violence in East Pakistan. When he failed in his attempts to meet General Yahya Khan, Masud too resigned from his position as Commander of Eastern Air Command, and took retirement from Air Force.\n\nLieutenant-General Sahabzada Yaqub Khan was sent into East Pakistan in emergency, following a major blow of the resignation of Vice Admiral Ahsan. General Yaqub temporarily assumed the control of the province, as he was made the unified commander of Pakistan Armed Forces. General Yaqub mobilised the entire major forces in East Pakistan, and were re-deployed in East Pakistan.\n\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman made a declaration of independence at [[Dhaka | Dacca]] on 26 March 1971. All major Awami League leaders including elected leaders of National Assembly and Provincial Assembly fled to neighbouring India and an [[Provisional Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh|exile government]] was formed headed by Mujibur Rahman. While he was in Pakistan Prison, Syed Nazrul Islam was the acting president with Tazuddin Ahmed as the prime minister. The exile government took oath on 17 April 1971 at Mujib Nagar, within East Pakistan territory of Kustia district and formally formed the government. Colonel MOG Osmani was appointed the Commander in Chief of [[Bangladesh Forces|Liberation Forces]] and whole East Pakistan was divided into eleven sectors headed by eleven sector commanders. All sector commanders were Bengali officers who had defected from the Pakistan Army. This started the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in which the [[Mukti Bahini|freedom fighters]], joined in December 1971 by 400,000 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian soldiers]], faced the [[Pakistani Armed Forces]] of 365,000 plus [[Paramilitary forces of Pakistan|Paramilitary]] and [[Razakars (Bangladesh)|collaborationist forces]]. An additional approximately 25,000 ill-equipped civilian volunteers and police forces also sided with the Pakistan Armed Forces. Bloody [[guerrilla warfare]] ensued in East Pakistan.\n\nThe Pakistan Armed Forces were unable to counter such threats. Poorly trained and inexperienced in guerrilla tactics, Pakistan Armed Forces and their assets were defeated by the Bangladesh Liberation Forces. On April 1971, Lieutenant-General Tikka Khan succeeded General Yaqub Khan as Commander of unified forces. General Tikka Khan led the massive violent and [[massacre]] campaigns in the region. He is held responsible for killing hundreds of thousands of Bengali people in East Pakistan, mostly civilians and unarmed peoples. For his role, General Tikka Khan gained the title as \"Butcher of Bengal\". General Khan faced an international reaction against Pakistan, and therefore, General Tikka was removed as Commander of Eastern front. He installed a civilian administration under Abdul Motaleb Malik on 31 August 1971, which proved to be ineffective. However, during the meeting, with no high officers willing to assume the command of East Pakistan, Lieutenant-General [[Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi]] volunteered for the command of East Pakistan. Inexperienced and the large magnitude of this assignment, the government sent Vice-Admiral [[Mohammad Shariff]] as second-in-command of General Niazi. Admiral Shariff served as the deputy unified commander of Pakistan Armed Forces in East Pakistan. However, General Niazi proved to be a failure and ineffective ruler. Therefore, General Niazi and Air Marshal Enamul Haque, Commander of Eastern Air Force Command (EAFC), failed to launch any operation in East Pakistan against Indian or its allies. Except Admiral Shariff who continued to press pressure on Indian Navy until the end of the conflict. Admiral Shariff's effective plans made it nearly impossible for Indian Navy to land its naval forces on the shores of East Pakistan. The Indian Navy was unable to land forces in East Pakistan and the Pakistan Navy was still offering resistance. The [[Indian Army]], entered East Pakistan from all three directions of the province. The Indian Navy then decided to wait near the Bay of Bengal until the Army reached the shore.\n\nThe Indian Air Force dismantled the capability of Pakistan Air Force in East Pakistan. Air Marshal Enamul Haque, Commander of Eastern Air Force Command (EAFC), failed to offer any serious resistance to the actions of the Indian Air Force. For most part of the war, the IAF enjoyed complete dominance in the skies over East Pakistan.\n\nOn 16 December 1971, the Pakistan Armed Forces surrendered to the [[Mitro Bahini|joint liberation forces]] of [[Mukti Bahini]] and the [[Indian army]], headed by Lieutenant-General [[Jagjit Singh Arora]], the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the Eastern Command of the Indian Army. Lieutenant General [[Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi|AAK Niazi]], the last unified commander of Pakistan Armed Forces' Eastern Military High Command, signed the [[Instrument of Surrender (1971)|Instrument of Surrender]] at about 4:31 pm. Over 93,000 personnel, including Lt. General Niazi and Admiral Shariff, were taken as [[prisoners of war]].\n\nOn 16 December 1971, East Pakistan was liberated from Pakistan as the newly independent state of [[Bangladesh]]. The Eastern Military High Command, civilian institutions and paramilitary forces were disbanded.\n\n==Geography==\nIn contrast to the desert and rugged mountainous terrain of West Pakistan, East Pakistan featured the [[Bengal delta|world's largest delta]], 700 rivers and tropical hilly jungles.\n\n===Administrative geography===\nEast Pakistan inherited districts from British Bengal. In 1960, Lower Tippera was renamed as Comilla. In 1969, new districts were created with Tangail separated from Mymensingh and Patuakhali from Barisal. East Pakistan's districts are listed in the following.\n[[File:Dominion of Pakistan & Indian Controlled Kashmir (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|400px|East and West Pakistan]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The [[Chittagong Tea Auction]] was established in 1949 as the region was home to the world's largest tea plantations. The [[Dhaka Stock Exchange|East Pakistan Stock Exchange Association]] was established in 1954. Many wealthy Muslim immigrants from India, Burma and former British colonies settled in East Pakistan. The [[Ispahani family]], Africawala brothers and the Adamjee family were pioneers of industrialization in the region. Many of modern Bangladesh's leading companies were born in the East Pakistan period.\n\nAn airline founded in British Bengal, [[Orient Airways]], launched the vital air link between East and West Pakistan with [[DC-3]] aircraft on the [[Dacca]]-[[Kolkata|Calcutta]]-[[Delhi]]-[[Karachi]] route. Orient Airways later evolved into [[Pakistan International Airlines]], whose first chairman was the East Pakistan-based industrialist [[Mirza Ahmad Ispahani]].\n\nBy the 1950s, East Bengal surpassed West Bengal in having the largest [[jute]] industries in the world. The [[Adamjee Jute Mills]] was the largest jute processing plant in history and its location in Narayanganj was nicknamed the ''[[Dundee]] of the East''. The Adamjees were descendants of [[Adamjee Haji Dawood|Sir Haji Adamjee Dawood]], who made his fortune in [[British Burma]].\n\n[[Natural gas]] was discovered in the northeastern part of East Pakistan in 1955 by the [[Burmah Oil Company]]. Industrial use of natural gas began in 1959. The [[Shell Oil Company]] and [[Pakistan Petroleum]] tapped 7 gas fields in the 1960s. The industrial seaport city of Chittagong hosted the headquarters of [[Padma Oil Company|Burmah Eastern]] and [[Jamuna Oil Company|Pakistan National Oil]]. Iran, an erstwhile leading oil producer, assisted in establishing the [[Eastern Refinery]] in Chittagong.\n\nThe [[Comilla Model]] of the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development (present-day [[Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development]]) was conceived by [[Akhtar Hameed Khan]] and replicated in many developing countries.\n\nIn 1965, Pakistan implemented the [[Kaptai Dam]] hydroelectric project in the southeastern part of East Pakistan with American assistance. It was the sole hydroelectric dam in East Pakistan. The project was controversial for displacing over 40,000 indigenous people from the area.\n\nThe centrally located metropolis Dacca witnessed significant urban growth.\n<gallery>\nFile:Central Dacca in East Pakistan.jpg|Central business district in Dacca, 1960s\nFile:Chittagong port 1960.jpg|Chittagong Port in 1960\nFile:Dacca East Pakistan 1967.jpg|Baitul Mukarram Market Area, Dacca, 1967\nFile:Pakistani rupee pre-1971.jpg|Pakistani banknotes included [[Bengali script]] until 1971\nFile:East Pakistan helicopter poster.jpg|A poster of the [[East Pakistan Helicopter Service]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Economic discrimination and disparity===\nAlthough East Pakistan had a larger population, West Pakistan dominated the divided country politically and received more money from the common budget. According to the [[World Bank]], there was much economic discrimination against East Pakistan, including higher government spending on West Pakistan, financial transfers from East to West and the use of the East's foreign exchange surpluses to finance the West's imports.\n\nThe discrimination occurred despite fact that East Pakistan generated a major share of Pakistan's exports.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto; width:550px;text-align:center;\"\n\n|-\n\n!width=16%| Year\n\n!width=28%| Spending on West Pakistan (in millions of [[Pakistani rupee]]s)\n\n!width=28%| Spending on East Pakistan (in millions of Pakistani rupees)\n\n!width=28%| Amount spent on East as percentage of West\n\n|-\n\n| 1950\u201355 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 11,290 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5,240 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 46.4\n\n|-\n\n| 1955\u201360 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 16,550 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5,240 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 31.7\n\n|-\n\n| 1960\u201365|| style=\"text-align:right;\"|33,550 ||align=\"right\"| 14,040 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 41.8\n\n|-\n\n| 1965\u201370 ||align=\"right\"|51,950 ||align=\"right\"| 21,410 || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 41.2\n\n|-\n\n| '''Total''' ||align=\"right\"|'''113,340''' ||align=\"right\"| '''45,930''' || style=\"text-align:right;\"| '''40.5'''\n\n|-\n\n| colspan=\"4\" | <small>''Source: Reports of the Advisory Panels for the Fourth Five Year Plan 1970\u201375, Vol. I,<br /> published by the planning commission of Pakistan.''</small>\n\n|}\n\nThe annual rate of growth of the gross domestic product per capita was 4.4% in the West Pakistan versus 2.6% in East Pakistan from 1960 to 1965. Bengali politicians pushed for more autonomy, arguing that much of Pakistan's export earnings were generated in East Pakistan from the exportation of Bengali jute and tea. As late as 1960, approximately 70% of Pakistan's export earnings originated in East Pakistan, although this percentage declined as international demand for jute dwindled. By the mid-1960s, East Pakistan was accounting for less than 60% of the nation's export earnings, and by the time Bangladesh gained its independence in 1971, this percentage had dipped below 50%. In 1966, Mujib demanded that separate foreign exchange accounts be kept and that separate trade offices be opened overseas. By the mid-1960s, West Pakistan was benefiting from Ayub's \"Decade of Progress\" with its successful green revolution in wheat and from the expansion of markets for West Pakistani textiles, while East Pakistan's standard of living remained at an abysmally low level. Bengalis were also upset that West Pakistan, the seat of the national government, received more foreign aid.\n\nEconomists in East Pakistan argued of a \"Two Economies Theory\" within Pakistan itself, which was founded on the Two Nation Theory with India. The so-called Two Economies Theory suggested that East and West Pakistan had different economic features which should not be regulated by a federal government in Islamabad.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.epw.in/journal/2016/28/book-reviews/birth-bangladesh.html|title=Birth of Bangladesh|date=5 June 2015|publisher=|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=51|issue=28}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics and culture==\n[[File:TheDailyIttefaq.png|thumb|[[The Daily Ittefaq]] edited by [[Tofazzal Hossain]] was the leading Bengali newspaper in Pakistan]]\n[[File:Flag of Bangladesh (1971).svg|thumb|The first Bangladeshi flag was hoisted on 23 March 1971 across East Pakistan, as a protest on Republic Day]]\nEast Pakistan was home to 55% of Pakistan's population. The largest ethnic group of the province were [[Bengalis]], who in turn were the largest ethnic group in Pakistan. [[Bengali Muslims]] formed the predominant majority, followed by [[Bengali Hindus]], [[Bengali Buddhists]] and [[Bengali Christians]]. East Pakistan also had many tribal groups, including the Chakmas, [[Marma people|Marmas]], [[Tanchangya people|Tangchangyas]], [[Garo people|Garos]], [[Bisnupriya Manipuri people|Manipuris]], [[Tripuri people|Tripuris]], [[Santhal people|Santhals]] and [[Bawm people|Bawms]]. They largely followed the religions of [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]] and Hinduism. East Pakistan was home to immigrant Muslims from across the [[Indian subcontinent]], including West Bengal, [[Bihar]], [[Gujarat]], the [[Northwest Frontier Province]], [[Assam]], [[Orissa Province|Orissa]], the Punjab and Kerala. A small [[Armenians in Bangladesh|Armenian]] and [[History of the Jews in Bangladesh|Jewish]] minority resided in East Pakistan.\n\nThe [[Asiatic Society of Pakistan]] was founded in Old Dacca by [[Ahmad Hasan Dani]] in 1948. The [[Varendra Research Museum]] in [[Rajshahi]] was an important center of research on the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. The [[Bangla Academy]] was established in 1954.\n\nAmong East Pakistan's newspapers, ''[[The Daily Ittefaq]]'' was the leading Bengali language title; while ''[[Holiday (newspaper)|Holiday]]'' was a leading English title.\n\nAt the time of partition, East Bengal had 80 cinemas. The first movie produced in East Pakistan was The Face and the Mask in 1955. [[Pakistan Television]] established its second studio in Dacca after Lahore in 1965. [[Runa Laila]] was Pakistan's first pop star and became popular in India as well. [[Shabnam]] was a leading actress from East Pakistan. [[Feroza Begum (singer)|Feroza Begum]] was a leading exponent of Bengali classical [[Nazrul geeti]]. [[Jasimuddin]] and [[Abbasuddin Ahmed]] promoted Bengali folk music. [[Munier Chowdhury]], [[Syed Mujtaba Ali]], [[Nurul Momen]], [[Sufia Kamal]] and [[Shamsur Rahman (poet)|Shamsur Rahman]] were among the leading literary figures in East Pakistan. Several East Pakistanis were awarded the [[Sitara-e-Imtiaz]] and the [[Pride of Performance]].\n\n===Ethnic and linguistic discrimination===\nBengalis were hugely under-represented in Pakistan's bureaucracy and military. In the federal government, only 15% of offices were occupied by East Pakistanis. Only 10% of the military were from East Pakistan. Cultural discrimination also prevailed, causing the eastern wing to forge a distinct political identity. There was a bias against [[Bengali culture]] in state media, such as a ban on broadcasts of the works of Nobel laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]].\n\n==Military==\n{{Main article|Evolution of Pakistan Eastern Command plan|l1=Eastern Military High Command of East Pakistan}}\n[[File:India Bangladesh border US Army Map Service.jpg|right|thumb|The Indo-East Pakistan border as shown by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], c. 1960.]]\nSince its unification with Pakistan, the [[Structure of the Pakistan Army|East Pakistan Army]] had consisted of only one infantry brigade made up of two battalions, the 1st East Bengal Regiment and the [[Punjab Regiment (Pakistan)|1/14]] or 3/8 Punjab Regiment in 1948. These two battalions boasted only five rifle companies between them (an infantry battalion normally had 5 companies).<ref>Major Nasir Uddin, Juddhey Juddhey Swadhinata, pp49</ref> This weak brigade was under the command of Brigadier-General Ayub Khan (local rank Major-General \u2013 [[General Officer Commanding|GOC]] of 14th Army Division), together with the [[East Pakistan Rifles]], which was tasked with defending East Pakistan during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]].<ref>Major Nasir Uddin, Juddhey Juddhey Swadhinata, pp47, pp51</ref> The [[Pakistan Air Force|PAF]], [[Pakistan Marines|Marines]], and the [[Pakistan Navy|Navy]] had little presence in the region. Only one PAF combatant squadron, [[List of Pakistan Air Force Squadrons|No. 14 Squadron ''Tail Choppers'']], was active in East Pakistan. This combatant squadron was commanded by Air Force Major [[Parvaiz Mehdi Qureshi]], who later became a four-star general. The East Pakistan military personnel were trained in combat diving, demolitions, and guerrilla/anti-guerrilla tactics by the advisers from the [[Special Service Group Navy|Special Service Group (Navy)]] who were also charged with intelligence data collection and management cycle.\n\nThe East Pakistan Navy had only one active-duty combatant destroyer, the [[List of active ships of the Pakistan Navy|PNS ''Sylhet'']]; one submarine ''[[PNS Ghazi|Ghazi]]'' (which was repeatedly deployed in West); four gunboats, inadequate to function in deep water. The joint special operations were managed and undertaken by the Naval Special Service Group (SSG(N)) who were assisted by the army, air force and marines unit. The entire service, the Marines were deployed in East Pakistan, initially tasked with conducting exercises and combat operations in [[riverine]] areas and at near shoreline. The small directorate of [[Naval Intelligence of Pakistan|Naval Intelligence]] (while the headquarters and personnel, facilities, and directions were coordinated by West) had vital role in directing special and reconnaissance missions, and intelligence gathering, also was charged with taking reasonable actions to slow down the Indian threat. The armed forces of East Pakistan also consisted the paramilitary organisation, the ''[[Razakars (Pakistan)|Razakars]]'' from the intelligence unit of the [[ISI (Pakistan)|ISI's]] Covert Action Division (CAD). All of these armed forces were commanded by the unified command structure, the Eastern Military High Command, led by an officer of three-star rank equivalent.\n\n==Governors==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Tenure||Governor of East Pakistan<ref name=\"worldstatesmen\">{{cite web| url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Bangladesh.html| title=Bangladesh| author=Ben Cahoon, WorldStatesmen.org| accessdate=3 October 2007}}</ref>\n!Political Affiliation\n|-\n|14 October 1955 \u2013 March 1956||[[Amiruddin Ahmad]]|| [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim League]]\n|-\n|March 1956 \u2013 13 April 1958||[[A.

His parents, Edward and Inez Wilson, divorced when he was seven. The young naturalist grew up in several cities and towns, moving around with his father and his stepmother.\n\nIn the same year that his parents divorced, Wilson blinded himself in one eye in a fishing accident. He suffered for hours, but he continued fishing.<ref name=\"Edward O. Wilson 2006\" /> He did not complain because he was anxious to stay outdoors. He did not seek medical treatment.<ref name=\"Edward O. Wilson 2006\" /> Several months later, his right pupil clouded over with a [[cataract]].<ref name=\"Edward O.

Wilson 2006\" /> His reduced ability to observe mammals and birds led him to concentrate on [[insect]]s.\n\nAt nine, Wilson undertook his first expeditions at the [[Rock Creek Park]] in Washington, DC. He began to collect insects and he gained a passion for butterflies. He would capture them using nets made with brooms, coat hangers, and cheesecloth bags.<ref name=\"Edward O. Wilson 2006\" /> Going on these expeditions led to Wilson's fascination with ants. He describes in his autobiography how one day he pulled the bark of a rotting tree away and discovered [[Acanthomyops|citronella ants]] underneath.<ref name=\"Edward O. Wilson 2006\" /> The worker ants he found were \"short, fat, brilliant yellow, and emitted a strong lemony odor\".<ref name=\"Edward O. Wilson 2006\" /> Wilson said the event left a \"vivid and lasting impression on [him]\".<ref name=\"Edward O. Wilson 2006\" /> He also earned the [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] award and served as Nature Director of his [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] summer camp. At the age of 18, intent on becoming an [[entomologist]], he began by collecting [[Diptera|flies]], but the shortage of insect pins caused by World War II caused him to switch to [[ant]]s, which could be stored in vials. With the encouragement of Marion R. Smith, a myrmecologist from the [[National Museum of Natural History]] in Washington, Wilson began a survey of all the ants of [[Alabama]]. This study led him to report the first colony of [[fire ants]] in the US, near the port of Mobile.<ref>first-hand account,{{self-published source|date=April 2014}} Smithsonian Institution talk, April 22, 2010</ref>\n\n==Education==\nConcerned that he might not be able to afford to go to a university, Wilson tried to enlist in the United States Army.

He developed a theory of the \"[[taxon]] cycle\".<ref name=\"Academy of Achievement\"/>\n\nJust after completing is PhD in 1955, Wilson started supervising Stuart A.

In the 1960s he collaborated with mathematician and ecologist [[Robert MacArthur]]. Together, they tested the theory of species equilibrium on a tiny island in the Florida Keys. He eradicated all insect species and observed the re-population by new species. A book ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]'' about this experiment became a standard ecology text.<ref name=\"Academy of Achievement\"/>\n\nIn 1971, he published the book ''The Insect Societies'' about the biology of social insects like ants, bees, wasps and termites. In 1973, Wilson was appointed 'Curator of Insects' at the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]]. In 1975, he published the book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' applying his theories of insect behavior to vertebrates, and in the last chapter, humans. He speculated that evolved and inherited tendencies were responsible for hierarchical social organisation among humans. In 1978 he published ''[[On Human Nature]]'', which dealt with the role of biology in the evolution of human culture and won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for General Nonfiction.<ref name=\"Academy of Achievement\"/>\n\nIn 1981 after collaborating with Charles Lumsden, he published ''Genes, Mind and Culture'', a theory of [[gene-culture coevolution]].

He argued that all animal behavior, including that of humans, is the product of [[heredity]], environmental stimuli, and past experiences, and that [[free will]] is an illusion. He has referred to the biological basis of behaviour as the \"genetic leash\".<ref name=con>E. O. Wilson, Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, New York, Knopf, 1998.</ref>{{rp|127\u2013128}} The sociobiological view is that all animal social behavior is governed by [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] rules worked out by the laws of [[evolution]].

Humans, however, do possess reproductive independence so they can give birth to offspring without the need of a \"queen\", and in fact humans enjoy their maximum level of Darwinian fitness only when they look after themselves and their offspring, while finding innovative ways to use the societies they live in for their own benefit.<ref>{{Cite interview |title=Karl Marx was right, socialism works |last=Wilson |first=Edward O. |location=Harvard University |date=March 27, 1997 |url=http://www.froes.dds.nl/WILSON.htm}}</ref>\n\n===''Consilience'', 1998===\nIn his 1998 book ''[[Consilience (book)|Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]]'', Wilson discussed methods that have been used to unite the sciences, and might be able to unite the sciences with the humanities.

He held 42 patents and received numerous awards, including the first [[IEEE Medal of Honor|Medal of Honor]] awarded by the Institute of Radio Engineers (now IEEE), the French [[Legion of Honor]], the 1941 [[Franklin Medal]] and the 1942 [[Edison Medal]]. He was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]] and included in the [[International Telecommunication Union]]'s roster of great inventors.\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:EdwinHArmstrongHouse c1975.jpg|right|thumb|Armstrong's boyhood home, 1032 Warburton Avenue, overlooking the Hudson River in Yonkers, New York, c. 1975. It was demolished in November 1982 due to fire damage.]]\n\nArmstrong was born in the [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] district of New York City, the oldest of John and Emily (Smith) Armstrong's three children.<ref name=\"Columbia\"/> His father began working at a young age at the American branch of the [[Oxford University Press]], which published bibles and standard classical works, eventually advancing to the position of vice president.<ref name=\"nyt19540202\" /> His parents first met at the North Presbyterian Church, located at 31st Street and Ninth Avenue. His mother's family had strong ties to Chelsea, and an active role in church functions.<ref>{{harvnb|Lessing|1956|p=22}}</ref> When the church moved north, the Smiths and Armstrongs followed, and in 1895 the Armstrong family moved from their brownstone row house at 347 West 29th Street to a similar house at 26 West 97th Street in the [[Upper West Side]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lessing|1956|p=23}}</ref> The family was comfortably middle class.\n\nAt the age of eight, Armstrong contracted [[Sydenham's chorea]] (then known as [[Sydenham's chorea|St. Vitus' Dance]]), an infrequent but serious neurological disorder precipitated by rheumatic fever. For the rest of his life, Armstrong was afflicted with a physical tic exacerbated by excitement or stress. Due to this illness, he withdrew from public school and was home-tutored for two years.<ref>{{harvnb|Lessing|1956|p=26}}</ref> To improve his health, the Armstrong family moved to a house overlooking the Hudson River, at 1032 Warburton Avenue in [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]]. The Smith family subsequently moved next door.<ref>{{harvnb|Lessing|1956|p=24}}</ref> Armstrong's tic and the time missed from school led him to become socially withdrawn.\n\nFrom an early age, Armstrong showed an interest in electrical and mechanical devices, particularly trains.<ref name=\"Lessing-320\">{{harvnb|Lessing|1956|p=27}}</ref> He loved heights and constructed a makeshift backyard antenna tower that included a [[bosun's chair]] for hoisting himself up and down its length, to the concern of neighbors. Much of his early research was conducted in the attic of his parent's house.<ref name=\"Wu-126\">{{harvnb|Wu|2010|p=126}}</ref>\n\nIn 1909, Armstrong enrolled at [[Columbia University]] in New York City, where he became a member of the Epsilon Chapter of the [[Theta Xi]] engineering fraternity, and studied under Professor [[Mihajlo Pupin|Michael Pupin]] at the Hartley Laboratories, a separate research unit at Columbia. Another of his instructors, Professor John H. Morecroft, later remembered Armstrong as being intensely focused on the topics that interested him, but somewhat indifferent to the rest of his studies.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858044013914;view=1up;seq=274 \"What Everyone Should Know About Radio History: Part II\"] by Prof. J. H. Morecroft, ''Radio Broadcast'', August, 1922, pages 294-302.</ref> He was known for challenging conventional wisdom and being quick to question the opinions of both professors and peers. In one case, he recounted how he tricked an instructor he disliked into receiving a severe electrical shock.<ref>''Empire of the Air'' by Tom Lewis, 1991, pages 60-61.</ref> He also stressed the practical over the theoretical, stating that progress was more likely the product of experimentation and work based on physical reasoning than on mathematical calculation and formulae (known as part of \"[[mathematical physics]]\").\n\nArmstrong graduated from Columbia in 1913, earning an electrical engineering degree.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|title=Who Was Who in American History - the Military|date=1975|publisher=Marquis Who's Who|location=Chicago|isbn=0837932017|page=15}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Armstrong served in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] as a captain and later a major.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn 1934, he filled the vacancy left by John H.

H. Armstrong\" by Thomas Sykes, 1990, page 22.</ref> Unlike most engineers, Armstrong never became a corporate employee. He set up a self-financed independent research and development laboratory at Columbia, and owned his patents outright.\n\n==Early work==\n\n===Regenerative circuit===\n[[File:Armstrong circuit.png|right|thumb|350px|Armstrong's \"feed back\" circuit drawing, from ''Radio Broadcast'' vol. 1 no. 1 1922.]]\n\nArmstrong began working on his first major invention while still an undergraduate at Columbia. In late 1906, [[Lee de Forest]] had invented the three-element (triode) [[audion|\"grid Audion\"]] vacuum-tube. How vacuum tubes worked was not understood at the time.  De Forest's initial Audions did not have a high vacuum and developed a blue glow at modest plate voltages; De Forest improved the vacuum for Federal Telegraph.<ref>''DeForest Radio Co. v. General Electric Co.'', [https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/US/283/283.US.664.630.html 283 U.S. 664] (May 25, 1931). Fleming and Lilenfeld had advocated high vacuum. \"Of critical importance in the present controversy is the effect of the presence of gas within the tube.\"  \"In consequence, the low vacuum tube is more sensitive both as a detector and as an amplifier than a tube of high vacuum.\" \"August 20, 1912, the earliest date claimed for Langmuir, was rejected rightly, we think, by the District Court, which held that Langmuir was anticipated by Arnold in November, 1912. But before the earlier date, De Forest sought and obtained a high vacuum in the audions used as amplifiers, and observed that when the vacuum was too low the blue glow effect occurred at from 15 to 20 volts. In order to secure higher voltages from the audions used as amplifiers and to procure the requisite high vacuum, he had some of the bulbs re-exhausted while superheated. By August 1912, the Telegraph Company used De Forest amplifying audions at 54 volts, and by November, they were used by another at 67 1/2 volts. This was possible only because the tubes had thus been exhausted of gas, which would otherwise have ionized with blue glow at from 20 to 30 volts.\"</ref> By 1912, how vacuum tubes worked was understood, and the advantages of high vacuum tubes were appreciated.\n\nWhile growing up Armstrong had experimented with the early, temperamental, \"gassy\" Audions. Spurred by the later discoveries, he developed a keen interest in gaining a detailed scientific understanding of how vacuum-tubes worked. In conjunction with Professor Morecroft he used an [[oscillograph]] to conduct comprehensive studies.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002212112;view=1up;seq=1175 \"Operating Features of the Audion\"] by E. H. Armstrong, ''Electrical World'', December 12, 1914, pages 1149-1152.</ref> His breakthrough discovery was determining that employing [[Positive feedback#In electronics|positive feedback]] (also known as [[Regenerative circuit|\"regeneration\"]]) produced amplification hundreds of times greater than previously attained, with the amplified signals now strong enough so that receivers could use loudspeakers instead of headphones. Further investigation revealed that when the feedback was increased beyond a certain level a vacuum-tube would go into [[Electronic oscillator|oscillation]], thus could also be used as a continuous-wave radio transmitter.\n\nBeginning in 1913 Armstrong prepared a series of comprehensive demonstrations and papers that carefully documented his research,<ref name=\"Armstrong-audion\">{{cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1916.tb55188.x |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hwsqz1;view=1up;seq=275 |first=E. H. |last=Armstrong |authorlink=Edwin Howard Armstrong |title=Operating Features of the Audion |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=215\u2013243 |date=August 2, 1917}}</ref> and in late 1913 applied for patent protection covering the [[regenerative circuit]]. On October 6, 1914, U.S. patent 1,113,149 was issued for his discovery.<ref>Lewis (1991), pages 77, 87.</ref> Although Lee de Forest initially discounted Armstrong's findings, beginning in 1915 de Forest filed a series of competing patent applications that largely copied Armstrong's claims, now stating that he had discovered regeneration first, based on August 6, 1912 notebook entry, while working for the Federal Telegraph company, prior to the January 31, 1913 date recognized for Armstrong. The result was an interference hearing at the patent office to determine priority. De Forest was not the only other inventor involved \u2013 the four competing claimants included Armstrong, de Forest, General Electric's Langmuir, and Alexander Meissner, who was a German national, which led to his application being seized by the [[Office of Alien Property Custodian]] during World War I.<ref>''Ibid.'', page 192.</ref>\n\nFollowing the end of World War I Armstrong enlisted representation by the law firm of Pennie, Davis, Martin and Edmonds. In order to finance his legal expenses he began issuing non-transferable licenses for use of the regenerative patents to a select group of small radio equipment firms, and by November 1920 seventeen companies had been licensed.<ref>''Invention and Innovation in the Radio Industry'' by W. Rupert Maclaurin, 1949, page 122.</ref> These licensees paid 5% royalties on their sales which were restricted to only \"amateurs and experimenters\". Meanwhile, Armstrong reviewed his options for selling the commercial rights to his work. Although the obvious candidate was the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA), on October 5, 1920 the [[Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company]] took out an option for $335,000 for the commercial rights for both the regenerative and superheterodyne patents, with an additional $200,000 to be paid if Armstrong prevailed in the regenerative patent dispute. Westinghouse exercised this option on November 4, 1920.<ref>''Radio Manufacturers of the 1920's: Volume 3'' by Alan Douglas, 1991, page 3. Organized broadcasting barely existed when the initial \"amateur and experimental\" licenses where granted. By 1922 a \"broadcast boom\" in the U.S. saw a tremendous growth in the sale of radio receivers to the general public. Westinghouse tried to claim that these sales infringed on its rights, as they should be considered \"commercial\", but the courts did not agree. Thus, the companies that held these \"amateur and experimental\" license rights found they now had a very valuable asset.</ref>\n\nLegal proceedings related to the regeneration patent became separated into two groups of court cases. An initial court action was triggered in 1919 when Armstrong sued de Forest's company in district court, alleging infringement of patent 1,113,149. This court ruled in Armstrong's favor on May 17, 1921. But a second line of court cases, the result of the patent office interference hearing, would have a different outcome. The interference board had also sided with Armstrong, but he was unwilling to settle with de Forest for less than what he considered full compensation. Thus pressured, de Forest decided to continue his legal defense, and appealed the interference board decision to the District of Columbia district court. On May 8, 1924, that court ruled that it was de Forest who should be considered regeneration's inventor. Armstrong (along with much of the engineering community) was shocked by this course of events, and his side appealed this unexpected decision. But although the legal proceeding twice went before the U.S. Supreme Court, in 1928 and 1934, he was unsuccessful in overturning the decision.<ref>Douglas (1991), pages 193-198, 203.</ref>\n\nIn response to the second Supreme Court decision upholding de Forest as the inventor of regeneration, Armstrong attempted to return his 1917 IRE Medal of Honor, which had been awarded \"in recognition of his work and publications dealing with the action of the oscillating and non-oscillating audion\". However, the organization's board refused to let him, and issued a statement that it \"strongly affirms the original award\".\n\n===Superheterodyne circuit===\n\n[[File:Edwin H Armstrong in WWI 1922.png|thumb|right|Armstrong in his [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] uniform during [[World War I]]]]\nThe United States entered into World War I in April 1917, and later that year Armstrong was commissioned as a Captain in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]], and assigned to a laboratory in Paris, France to help develop radio communication for the Allied war effort. He returned to the United States in the fall of 1919, after being promoted to the rank of Major.<ref name=\"Lessing-320\" /> (During both world wars, Armstrong gave the U.S. military free use of his patents.)\n\nDuring this period Armstrong's most significant accomplishment was the development of a \"supersonic heterodyne\" \u2013 soon shortened to \"superheterodyne\" \u2013 radio receiver circuit.<ref name=\"nyt19540202\" /> This circuit made radio receivers more sensitive and selective and is still extensively used today. The key feature of the superheterodyne approach is the mixing of the incoming radio signal with a locally generated, different frequency signal within a radio set. This circuit is typically referred to as the mixer. The end result is a fixed, unchanging intermediate frequency, or I.F. signal which is more easily amplified and detected by subsequent circuit stages that follow the mixer. In 1919, Armstrong filed an application for a U.S. patent of the superheterodyne circuit which was issued the next year. This patent was subsequently sold to Westinghouse.<ref>MacLaurin (1949), page 106. \"Westinghouse then made an even more important move by purchasing [on May 22, 1920] for $335,000 the Armstrong patents on the regenerative and superheterodyne circuits.\"</ref> The patent would be challenged, however, triggering yet another patent office interference hearing.<ref name=\"who\">[http://antiqueradios.com/superhet/ \"Who Invented the Superheterodyne?\"] by Alan Douglas, originally published in ''The Legacies of Edwin Howard Armstrong'' from the \"Proceedings of the Radio Club of America\", Nov. 1990, Vol.64 no.3, pages 123-142. Page 139: \"L\u00e9vy broadened his claims to purposely create an interference, by copying Armstrong's claims exactly. The Patent Office would then have to choose between the two inventors.\"</ref> Armstrong ultimately lost this patent battle; although the outcome was less controversial than that involving the regeneration proceedings.<ref>Lewis (1991), page 205. \"...the case did not seem to affect Armstrong emotionally in the same way the regeneration suit did... Possibly he recognized the Frenchman did have some legitimate claim to the invention... Armstrong respected Levy in a way that he could not respect de Forest...\"</ref>\n\nThe challenger was [[Lucien L\u00e9vy]] of France who had also worked developing Allied radio communication during World War I. He had been awarded French patents in 1917 and 1918 that covered some of the same basic ideas used in Armstrong's superheterodyne receiver. AT&T, which was interested in radio development at this time, primarily for point-to-point extensions of its wired telephone exchanges, purchased the U.S. rights to L\u00e9vy's patent and contested Armstrong's grant. The subsequent court reviews continued until 1928, when the District of Columbia Court of Appeals disallowed all nine claims of Armstrong's patent, assigning priority for seven of the claims to L\u00e9vy, and one each to [[Ernst Alexanderson]] of General Electric and Burton W. Kendall of [[Bell Laboratories]].<ref>''The Continuous Wave: Technology and American Radio, 1900-1932'' by Hugh G. J. Aitken, 1985, page 467.</ref>\n\nAlthough most early radio receivers used regeneration Armstrong approached RCA's [[David Sarnoff]], whom he had known since giving a demonstration of his regeneration receiver in 1913, about the corporation offering superheterodynes as a superior offering to the general public.<ref>''History of Radio to 1926'' by Gleason L. Archer, 1938, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89074767138;view=1up;seq=343 page 297]: \"It appears that Armstrong first exhibited the device to the astute General Manager of RCA, David Sarnoff. Mr. Sarnoff had just concluded arrangements that involved ordering several millions' dollars worth of an improved type of radio... He was so impressed by the Armstrong invention that he at once halted these negotiations...\"</ref> (The ongoing patent dispute was not a hindrance, because extensive cross-licensing agreements signed in 1920 and 1921 between RCA, Westinghouse and AT&T meant that Armstrong could freely use the L\u00e9vy patent.) Superheterodyne sets were initially thought to be prohibitively complicated and expensive as the initial designs required multiple tuning knobs and used nine vacuum-tubes. However, in conjunction with RCA engineers, Armstrong developed a simpler, less costly design. RCA introduced its superheterodyne Radiola sets in the U.S. market in early 1924, and they were an immediate success, dramatically increasing the corporation's profits. These sets were considered so valuable that RCA would not license the superheterodyne to other U.S. manufacturing companies until 1930.<ref name=\"who\"/>\n\n===Super-regeneration circuit===\n\n[[Image:Edwin Armstrong at blackboard.jpg|thumb|Armstrong explaining the superregenerative circuit, New York, 1922]]\nThe regeneration legal battle had one serendipitous outcome for Armstrong. While he was preparing apparatus to counteract a claim made by a patent attorney, he \"accidentally ran into the phenomenon of super-regeneration\", where, by rapidly \"quenching\" the vacuum-tube oscillations, he was able to achieve even greater levels of amplification. A year later, in 1922, Armstrong sold his super-regeneration patent to RCA for $200,000 plus 60,000 shares of corporation stock, which was later increased to 80,000 shares in payment for consulting services. This made Armstrong RCA's largest shareholder, and he noted that \"The sale of that invention was to net me more than the sale of the regenerative circuit and the superheterodyne combined\".<ref>Maclaurin (1949). October 12, 1947 letter from Armstrong to the author, page 122.</ref> RCA envisioned selling a line of super-regenerative receivers until superheterodyne sets could be perfected for general sales, but it turned out the circuit was not selective enough to make it practical for broadcast receivers.\n\n==Wide-band FM radio==\n\n\"Static\" interference \u2013 extraneous noises caused by sources such as thunderstorms and electrical equipment \u2013 bedeviled early radio communication using [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) and perplexed numerous inventors attempting to eliminate it. Many ideas for static elimination were investigated, with little success. In the mid-1920s, Armstrong began researching whether he could come up with a solution. He initially, and unsuccessfully, attempted to resolve the problem by modifying the characteristics of existing AM transmissions.\n\nOne approach considered as a potential solution had been the use of [[frequency modulation]] (FM) transmissions, where, in order to encode audio, instead of varying (technically known as \"modulating\") the amplitude (strength) of a radio signal, as was done for AM transmissions, the frequency was varied. However, in 1922 [[John Renshaw Carson]] of AT&T, inventor of [[Single-sideband modulation]] (SSB), had published a ''[[Proceedings of the IRE]]'' paper which included a detailed mathematical analysis which showed that FM transmissions did not provide any improvement over AM.<ref>{{citation |first=J. R. |last=Carson |authorlink=John Renshaw Carson |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.101888973;view=1up;seq=65 |title=Notes on the theory of modulation |journal=Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers |volume=10 |issue=1 |date=February 1922 |pages=57\u201364 |doi=10.1109/jrproc.1922.219793}}</ref> Although the [[Carson bandwidth rule]] for FM is still important today, this review turned out to be incomplete, because it analyzed only what is now known as \"narrow-band\" FM.\n\nIn early 1928 Armstrong began researching the capabilities of frequency modulation. Although there were few others involved in FM research at this time, he did have knowledge of a project being conducted by RCA engineers, who were investigating whether FM shortwave transmissions were less susceptible to fading than AM. In 1931 these engineers constructed a successful FM shortwave link transmitting the Schmeling-Stribling fight broadcast from California to Hawaii, and noted at the time that the signals seemed to be less affected by static, but the project made little further progress.<ref>''Early FM Radio'' by Gary L. Frost, 2010, pages 72-73.</ref>\n\nWorking in secret in the basement laboratory of Columbia's Philosophy Hall, Armstrong slowly developed what eventually resulted in [[Audio frequency|wide-band]] FM, in the process discovering significant advantages over the earlier \"narrow-band\" FM transmissions. He was granted five U.S. patents covering the basic features of new system on December 26, 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fathom.com/seminars/10701020/session2.html |title=Air War: Legal Battles Over FM Radio |first=Dana M |last=Raymond |work=Fathom |publisher=Columbia University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515054100/http://www.fathom.com/seminars/10701020/session2.html |archivedate=May 15, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref> Initially, the primary claim was that his FM system was effective at filtering out the noise produced in receivers by vacuum tubes.<ref>Frost (2010), page 95.</ref>\n\nArmstrong had a standing agreement to give RCA the [[right of first refusal]] to his patents. In 1934 he made a presentation of his new system to RCA president Sarnoff. Sarnoff was somewhat taken aback by its complexity, as he had hoped it would be possible to eliminate static merely by adding a simple device to existing receivers. From May 1934 until October 1935 Armstrong conducted field tests of his FM technology from an RCA laboratory located on the 85th floor of the [[Empire State Building]] in New York City. An antenna attached to the building's spire transmitted signals for distances up to {{convert|80|mi|km}}.<ref name=\"Wu-125\">{{harvnb|Wu|2010|p=125}}</ref> These tests helped demonstrate FM's static-reduction and high-fidelity capabilities. However RCA, which was heavily invested in perfecting television broadcasting, chose not to invest in FM, and instructed Armstrong to remove his equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://users.erols.com/oldradio/eha65.htm |title=Beginning of Armstrong's FM station W2XMN at Alpine, NJ (1937) |first=Mike |last=Katzdorn |work= |publisher= |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nDenied the marketing and financial clout that RCA would have brought, Armstrong decided to finance his own development and form ties with smaller members of the radio industry, including [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith]] and [[General Electric]], to promote his invention. Armstrong thought that FM had the potential to replace AM stations within 5 years, which he promoted as a boost for the radio manufacturing industry, then suffering from the effects of the [[Great Depression]], since making existing AM radio transmitters and receivers obsolete would necessitate that stations buy replacement transmitters and listeners purchase FM-capable receivers.

For comparison, he played a jazz record using a conventional AM radio, then switched to an FM transmission. A [[United Press International|United Press]] correspondent was present, and recounted in a wire service report that: \"if the audience of 500 engineers had shut their eyes they would have believed the jazz band was in the same room. There were no extraneous sounds.\" Moreover, \"Several engineers said after the demonstration that they consider Dr. Armstrong's invention one of the most important radio developments since the first earphone crystal sets were introduced.\" Armstrong was quoted as saying he could \"visualize a time not far distant when the use of ultra-high frequency wave bands will play the leading role in all broadcasting\", although the article noted that \"A switchover to the ultra-high frequency system would mean the junking of present broadcasting equipment and present receivers in homes, eventually causing the expenditure of billions of dollars.\"<ref>\"New Radio Shown\" (UP), ''Bellingham (Washington) Herald'', June 17, 1936, page 2.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1930s, as technical advances made it possible to transmit on higher frequencies, the FCC investigated options for increasing the number of broadcasting stations, in addition to ideas for better audio quality, known as \"high-fidelity\". In 1937 it introduced what became known as the [[Apex (radio band)|Apex band]], consisting of 75 broadcasting frequencies from 41.02 to 43.98&nbsp;MHz. As on the standard broadcast band these were AM stations, but with higher quality audio \u2013 in one example, a frequency response from 20&nbsp;Hz to 17,000&nbsp;Hz +/-&nbsp;1&nbsp;dB \u2013 because station separations were 40&nbsp;kHz instead of the 10&nbsp;kHz spacings used on the original AM band.<ref>[http://www.theradiohistorian.org/Apex/Apex1.htm America's Apex Broadcasting Stations of the 1930's] by John Schneider.</ref> Armstrong worked to convince the FCC that a band of FM broadcasting stations would be a superior approach. That year he financed the construction of the first FM radio station, [[Armstrong Tower|W2XMN]] (later KE2XCC) at Alpine, New Jersey. FCC engineers had believed that transmissions using high frequencies would travel little farther than line-of-sight distances, limited by the horizon. However, when operating with 40 kilowatts on 42.8&nbsp;MHz, the station could be clearly heard {{convert|100|mi|km}} away, matching the daytime coverage of a full power 50-kilowatt AM station.<ref>{{cite journal|year=1940 |title=Armstrong, Edwin Howard |journal=Current Biography |pages=23\u201326 |publisher=The H. W. Wilson Company}}</ref>\n\nFCC studies comparing the Apex station transmissions with Armstrong's FM system concluded that his approach was superior. In early 1940, the FCC held hearings on whether to establish a commercial FM service. Following this review, the FCC announced the establishment of an FM band effective January 1, 1941, consisting of forty 200&nbsp;kHz-wide channels on a band from 42-50&nbsp;MHz, with the first five channels reserved for educational stations. Existing Apex stations were notified that they would not be allowed to operate after January 1, 1941 unless they converted to FM.\n\nAlthough there was interest in the new FM band by station owners, construction restrictions that went into place during World War II limited the growth of the new service. Following the end of World War II, the FCC moved to standardize its frequency allocations. One area of concern was the effects of [[Tropospheric propagation|tropospheric]] and [[Sporadic E propagation]], which at times reflected station signals over great distances, causing mutual interference. A particularly controversial proposal, spearheaded by RCA, was that the FM band needed to be shifted to higher frequencies in order to avoid this potential problem. This reassignment was fiercely opposed as unneeded by Armstrong, but in the end he lost. The FCC made its decision final on June 27, 1945.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/298622331|title=Device to make FM Radios Work Under FCC Ruling|last=AP|first=|date=June 27, 1945|work=The Miami News|access-date=2017-08-14|at=6-A|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> It allocated one hundred FM channels from 88\u2013108&nbsp;MHz, and assigned the former FM band to 'non government fixed and mobile' (42\u201344&nbsp;MHz), and [[Channel 1 (North American TV)|television channel 1]] (44\u201350&nbsp;MHz), curiously now sidestepping the interference concerns.<ref name=\":0\" /> A period of allowing existing FM stations to broadcast on both low and high bands ended at midnight on January 8, 1949, at which time any low band  transmitters had to be shut down, officially making obsolete 395,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/93688720|title=395,000 FM Radio Sets Must Be Replaced|last=INS|first=|date=June 27, 1945|work=Journal Gazette|access-date=2017-08-14|page=6|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> receivers that had already been purchased by the public for the original band.

The change was also thought to have been favored by AT&T, as the elimination of FM relaying stations would require radio stations to lease wired links from that company. Particularly galling was the FCC assignment of TV channel 1 to the 44-50&nbsp;MHz segment of the old FM band.  Channel 1 was later deleted, since periodic [[radio propagation]] would make local TV signals unviewable.\n\nAlthough the FM band shift was an economic setback, there was still reason for optimism, and a book published in 1946 by Charles A. Siepmann heralded FM stations as \"Radio's Second Chance\".<ref>''Radio's Second Chance'' by Charles A. Siepmann, 1946, pages 239-253.</ref> In late 1945, Armstrong contracted with John Orr Young, founding member of the public relations firm [[Young & Rubicam]], to conduct a national campaign promoting FM broadcasting, especially by educational institutions. Article placements promoting both Armstrong personally and FM were made with general circulation publications including ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.<ref>[http://scholarworks.rit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4076&context=theses \"A Case study of Edwin Howard Armstrong's public relations campaign for FM\"] (thesis) by Jessica Francis, December 14, 2012, pages 16, 19.</ref>\n\nIn 1940, RCA offered Armstrong $1,000,000 for a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use his FM patents. But he refused this offer, primarily because he felt this would be unfair to the other licensed companies, which had to pay 2% royalties on their sales. Over time this impasse with RCA would come to dominate Armstrong's life. RCA countered by conducting its own FM research, eventually developing what it claimed was a non-infringing FM system. The corporation also encouraged other companies to stop paying royalties to Armstrong. Outraged by this turn of events, in 1948 Armstrong filed suit against RCA and the National Broadcasting Company, accusing them of patent infringement and that they had \"deliberately set out to oppose and impair the value\" of his invention, for which he requested treble damages. Although he was confident that this suit would be successful and result in a major monetary award, the protracted legal maneuvering that followed eventually began to impair his finances, especially after his primary patents expired in late 1950.<ref>Lewis (1991), pages 247-278, 300-328.</ref>\n\n==FM Doppler radar==\n\nDuring World War II, Armstrong turned his attention to investigations of continuous wave FM [[Doppler radar]] funded by government contracts.<ref>[https://blogs.cul.columbia.edu/armstrongpapers/tag/robert-e-hull/ \u201cRadar.\u201d Comins J. \u201cMajor Armstrong: Scientist, Technologist, Philosopher, July 22, 2010.\u201d Retrieved 2018-06-14.]</ref> The relative slowness of FM radar, compared with the AM pulse radar then in use, was offset by an enormous increment in range that became increasingly important with the advent of aircraft capable of traveling at supersonic speeds. Although the War ended before this technology could be applied, it subsequently became the method of choice. The first clear test of its utility in extremely long-range target detection was carried out on January 10, 1946, when the Army Signal Corps' [[Project Diana]] successfully reflected radar waves off the moon using a transmitter and receiver designed by Armstrong.<ref>\u201cHow Diana touched the moon.\u201d Clark T.

The original design is credited to [[Brad McQuaid]], Steve Clover, and Bill Trost. It was [[video game developer|developed]] by Sony's [[989 Studios]] and its early-1999 spin-off [[Verant Interactive]], and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Sony Online Entertainment]] (SOE).<ref name=\"eqcomp1\">{{cite book |title=Everquest Companion: The Inside Lore of a Gameworld |last=Marks |first=Robert |year=2003 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Osborne Media |isbn=978-0-07-222903-5 }}</ref> \nSince its acquisition of Verant in late 1999, EverQuest was developed by Sony Online Entertainment.<ref name=\"Sony/Verant\">{{cite web | title=Announcement of Verant Merger | publisher=Verant | url=http://www.verant.com}}</ref>\n\nThe design and concept of ''EverQuest'' is heavily indebted to [[MUD|text-based MUDs]], in particular [[DikuMUD]], and as such ''EverQuest'' is considered a 3D evolution of the text MUD genre like some of the MMOs that preceded it, such as ''[[Meridian 59]]'' and ''[[The Realm Online]]''. John Smedley, Brad McQuaid, Steve Clover and Bill Trost, who jointly are credited with creating the world of ''EverQuest'', have repeatedly pointed to their shared experiences playing MUDs such as ''[[Sojourn (online game)|Sojourn]]'' and ''[[TorilMUD]]'' as the inspiration for the game.<ref name = \"bqjsnq\"/> Famed book cover illustrator [[Keith Parkinson]] created the box covers for earlier installments of EverQuest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keithparkinson.com/store_prints.php|title=Limited Edition Prints|publisher=Keith Parkinson Online|accessdate=Sep 10, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902021119/http://www.keithparkinson.com/store_prints.php|archivedate=2015-09-02|df=}}</ref>\n\nDevelopment of ''EverQuest'' began in 1996 when [[Sony Interactive Studios America]] (SISA) executive John Smedley secured funding for a 3D game like text-based MUDs following the successful launch of ''[[Meridian 59]]'' the previous year.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} To implement the design, Smedley hired programmers Brad McQuaid and Steve Clover, who had come to Smedley's attention through their work on the single player RPG ''Warwizard''. McQuaid soon rose through the ranks to become executive producer for the ''EverQuest'' franchise and emerged during development of ''EverQuest'' as a popular figure among the fan community through his in-game avatar, Aradune.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Other key members of the development team included Bill Trost, who created the history, lore and major characters of Norrath (including ''EverQuest'' protagonist Firiona Vie), Geoffrey \"GZ\" Zatkin, who implemented the spell system, and artist Milo D. Cooper, who did the original character modeling in the game.\n\nThe start of [[beta testing]] was announced by Brad McQuaid in November 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=rec.games.mud.announce/sya7IcOZ08g/A4E7JB8tONAJ|author=Brad McQuaid|year=1997|title=EverQuest -- Graphical MUD}}</ref>\n\n===Release===\n''EverQuest'' launched with modest expectations from Sony on 16 March 1999 under its [[Verant Interactive]] brand and quickly became successful. By the end of the year, it had surpassed competitor ''Ultima Online'' in number of subscriptions. Numbers continued rising rapidly until mid-2001 when growth slowed. [[Sony]]'s last reported subscription numbers were given as more than 430,000 players on 14 January 2004.<ref name=\"Champions Of Norrath Announcement\">Champions Of Norrath Announcement, [http://championsofnorrath.station.sony.com/headset.jsp Sony.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415215440/http://championsofnorrath.station.sony.com/headset.jsp |date=2008-04-15 }}</ref>\n\n''EverQuest'' initially launched with volunteer \"Guides\" who would act as basic customer service/support via 'petitions'. Issues could be forwarded to the Game Master assigned to the server or resolved by the volunteer. Other guides would serve in administrative functions within the program or assisting the Quest Troupe with dynamic and persistent live events throughout the individual servers. Volunteers were compensated with free subscription and expansions to the game. In 2003 the program changed for the volunteer guides taking them away from the customer service focus and placing them into their current roles as roving 'persistent characters' role-playing with the players.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn anticipation of [[PlayStation]]'s launch, Sony Interactive Studios America made the decision to focus primarily on console titles under the banner [[989 Studios]], while spinning off its sole computer title, ''EverQuest'', which was ready to launch, to a new computer game division named Redeye (renamed Verant Interactive). Executives initially had very low expectations for ''EverQuest'', but in 2000, following the surprising continued success and unparalleled profits of ''EverQuest'', Sony reorganized Verant Interactive into [[Sony Online Entertainment]] (SOE) with Smedley retaining control of the company.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nMany of the original ''EverQuest'' team, including Brad McQuaid and Steve Clover left SOE by 2002.<ref>{{cite interview |last=McQuaid |first=Brad  |interviewer= Morgan Ramsay |title= The Inside Story of How a Major MMO Went Wrong |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/13/the-inside-story-of-how-a-major-mmo-went-wrong |publisher= IGN |date= 14 February 2014 |access-date= 19 April 2017}}\n</ref>\n\n===Subscription numbers===\n\nWhile the exact statistics on ''EverQuest'' subscriptions are not public, computer games analyst [[Bruce Woodcock (computer games analyst)|Bruce Woodcock]] estimates, based on public sources such as press statements, that the game had 100,000 subscriptions in March 2000, one year after initial release, with an increase to more than 540,000 subscriptions by July 2003. However, the same analysis points at a sharp decline after mid-2005, back to less than 100,000 in May 2006. .<ref>{{cite web|last1=Woodcock|first1=Bruce|title=MMOG Active Subscriptions 21.0|url=http://mmogchart.com/Chart2.html|website=mmogchart.com|accessdate=6 November 2006|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103162327/http://mmogchart.com/Chart2.html|archivedate=3 November 2006|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Growth and sequels===\nThe first four expansions were released in traditional physical boxes at roughly one-year intervals. These were highly ambitious and offered huge new landmasses, new playable races and new classes. The expansion ''[[EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin|Shadows of Luclin]]'' (2001) gave a significant facelift to player character models, bringing the by-then dated 1999 graphics up to modern standards. However, non-player characters which do not correspond to any playable race-gender-class combination (such as vendors) were not updated, leading to the coexistence of 1999-era and 2001-era graphics in many locations. The expansion ''[[EverQuest: The Planes of Power|Planes of Power]]'' (2002) introduced The Plane of Knowledge, a hub zone from which players could quickly teleport to many other destinations. This made the pre-existing roads and ships largely redundant, and long-distance overland travel is now virtually unheard of.\n\n''EverQuest'' made a push to enter the European market in 2002 with the ''New Dawn'' promotional campaign, which not only established local servers in Germany, France and Great Britain but also offered localized versions of the game in German and French to accommodate players who prefer those languages to English. In the following year the game also moved beyond the PC market with a [[Mac OS X]] version.\n\nIn 2003 experiments began with digital distribution of expansions, starting with the ''[[Legacy of Ykesha]]''. From this point on expansions would be less ambitious in scope than the original four, but on the other hand the production rate increased to two expansions a year instead of one.\n\nThis year the franchise also ventured into the console market with ''[[EverQuest Online Adventures]]'', released for Sony's internet-capable [[PlayStation 2]]. It was the second MMORPG for this console, after ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]''. Story-wise it was a prequel, with the events taking place 500 years before the original ''EverQuest''. Other spin-off projects were the PC strategy game ''[[Lords of EverQuest]]'' (2003) and the co-op ''[[Champions of Norrath]]'' (2004) for the PlayStation 2.\n\nAfter these side projects, the first proper sequel was released in late [[2004 in video gaming|2004]], titled simply ''[[EverQuest II]]'' .<ref name=\"lore\">{{cite web|title=Stratics Official Game Lore|url=http://eq2.stratics.com/content/lore/lore_toc.php|quote=Five hundred years have passed since the Sleeper was awakened|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820001713/http://eq2.stratics.com/content/lore/lore_toc.php|archivedate=2008-08-20|df=}}</ref> The game is set 500 years after the original. ''EverQuest II'' faced severe competition from Blizzard's ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', which was released at virtually the same time and quickly grew to dominate the MMORPG genre.\n\n===Decline===\nSince the release of ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and other modern MMORPGs, there have been a number of signs that the EverQuest population is shrinking. The national ''New Dawn'' servers were discontinued in 2005 and merged into a general (English-language) European server.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tgdaily.com/games-and-entertainment-brief/1778-everquest-europe-joins-everquest-us |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324190133/http://www.tgdaily.com/games-and-entertainment-brief/1778-everquest-europe-joins-everquest-us |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe 2006 expansion [[The Serpent's Spine]] introduced the \"adventure-friendly\" city of Crescent Reach in which all races and classes are able (and encouraged) to start. Crescent Reach is supposed to provide a more pedagogic starting environment than the original 1999 cities, where players were given almost no guidance on what to do. The common starting city also concentrates the dwindling number of new players in a single location, making grouping easier. [[EverQuest: Seeds of Destruction|2008's Seeds of Destruction]] expansion introduced computer controlled companions called \"mercenaries\" that can join groups in place of human players; a response to the increasing difficulty of finding other players of appropriate level for group activities. As of ''Seeds'' the production rate also returned to one expansion a year instead of two.\n\nIn March 2012 EverQuest departed from the traditional monthly subscription business model by introducing three tiers of commitment: a completely [[free-to-play]] Bronze Level, a one-time fee Silver Level, and a subscription Gold Level.<ref name=\"F2P\">{{cite web | title=EverQuest Free to Play| accessdate=2012-02-01 |url=http://www.everquest.com/free/}}</ref> The same month saw the closure of [[EverQuest Online Adventures]]. Just a few months earlier [[EverQuest II]] had gone free-to-play and SOE flagship [[Star Wars Galaxies]] also closed.\n\nIn June of the same year SOE removed the ability to buy game subscription time with Station Cash without any warning to players. SOE apologized for this abrupt change in policy and reinstated the option for an additional week, after which it was removed permanently.<ref>[http://forums.station.sony.com/eq/posts/list.m?topic_id=187127 Non-recurring Subscriptions Removal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624044232/http://forums.station.sony.com/eq/posts/list.m?topic_id=187127 |date=2012-06-24 }} Official news and announcements - 2012-06-15</ref>\n\nNovember 2013 saw the closure of the sole Mac OS server Al'Kabor.\n\nIn February 2015 Sony sold its online entertainment division to private equity group [[Columbus Nova]], with Sony Online Entertainment subsequently renamed [[Daybreak Game Company]] (DBG). An initial period of uncertainty followed, with all projects such as expansions and sequels put on hold and staff laid off. The situation stabilized around the game's 16th anniversary celebrations, and a new expansion was released in November 2015.\n\nAs a result of the layoffs, customer service was severely curtailed.  The expansions DBG released consisted of about half the content that was released prior while the Everquest franchise was owned by Sony.  Each released expansion by DBG had numerous serious bugs, where either the events were not tuned correctly, players were allowed to do what they should not be allowed to do, or so buggy that the game was unplayable.\n\n===EverQuest Next===\nThe third iteration in the series, with the working title ''[[EverQuest Next]]'', was under development,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://eq2.zam.com/story.html?story=19260|title= SOE Confirms Development on EverQuest \"Next\" |accessdate=2009-09-13 | work=Allakhazam | date=2009-09-13}}</ref> with in-game screenshots, concept art, and information revealed at the SOE Fan Faire in August 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=EQ2Wire Coverage of EverQuest Next|url=http://eq2wire.com/2010/08/07/gallery-eqnext-screen-shots-and-concept-art-day-2|accessdate=2010-08-09|work=EQ2Wire|date=2010-08-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821113620/http://eq2wire.com/2010/08/07/gallery-eqnext-screen-shots-and-concept-art-day-2/|archivedate=2010-08-21|df=}}</ref> However, this early version of the game has since been scrapped and development cancelled.<ref>https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/11/11206518/everquest-next-canceled because the game simply wasn't fun</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n\nMany of the elements in ''EverQuest'' have been drawn from text-based [[MUD]] (Multi-User Dungeon) games, particularly [[DikuMUD]]s, which in turn were inspired by traditional [[role-playing game]]s such as ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.<ref name = \"bqjsnq\">{{cite book |last=Bartle |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Bartle|title=Designing Virtual Worlds |year=2003 |publisher= New Riders Games |isbn= 978-0-13-101816-7|title-link=Designing Virtual Worlds }}</ref> In ''EverQuest'', players create a character (also known as an [[Avatar (computing)#Avatars in games|avatar]], or colloquially as a ''char'' or ''toon'') by selecting one of 12 races in the game, which were humans, high-elves, wood-elves, half-elves, dark-elves, erudites, barbarians, dwarves, halflings, gnomes, ogres, and trolls. In the first expansion, lizard-people (Iksar) were introduced.  Cat-people (Vah Shir), frog-people (Froglok), and dragon-people (Drakkin) were all introduced in later expansions.<ref>http://wiki.project1999.com/Character_Races</ref> At creation, players select each character's adventuring occupation (such as a wizard, ranger, or cleric \u2014 called a ''class'' \u2014 [[EverQuest#Tank classes|see below]] for particulars), a patron deity, and starting city.  Customization of the character facial appearance is available at creation (hair, hair color, face style, facial hair, facial hair color, eye color, etc.).\n\n[[Image:Sand Giant - EverQuest - 1999.jpg|left|250px|thumb|A Sand Giant engaging a group in the Oasis of Marr, a desert zone. The low-polygon character models, low resolution, and simple user interface suggest this screenshot was taken between 1999 and 2002.]]\n\nPlayers move their character throughout the medieval fantasy world of Norrath, often fighting monsters and enemies for treasure and [[experience point]]s, and optionally mastering trade skills. As they progress, players advance in level, gaining power, prestige, spells, and abilities through valorous deeds such as entering overrun castles and keeps, defeating worthy opponents found within, and [[Looting (gaming)|looting]] their remains. Experience and prestigious equipment can also be obtained by completing quests given out by [[non-player character]]s found throughout the land.\n\n''EverQuest'' allows players to interact with other people through [[Role-playing|role-play]], joining player [[Clan (computer gaming)|guilds]], and dueling other players (in restricted situations \u2013 ''EverQuest'' only allows [[player versus player]] (PVP) combat on the PvP-specific server, specified arena zones and through agreed upon dueling).\n\nThe game-world of ''EverQuest'' consists of over five hundred zones.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest.vm |title=EverQuest - Massively Multiplayer Online Fantasy Role-Playing Game |publisher=Everquest.station.sony.com |accessdate=2011-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225042523/http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest.vm |archivedate=2011-12-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\nMultiple instances of the world exist on various servers. In the past, game server populations were visible during log-in, and showed peaks of more than 3000 players per server. The design of ''EverQuest'', like other [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, makes it highly amenable to cooperative play, with each player having a specific role within a given group.\n\n===Classes===\nThe fourteen classes of the original 1999 version of ''EverQuest'' were later expanded to include the Beastlord and Berserker classes with the ''[[EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin|Shadows of Luclin]]'' (2001) and ''[[EverQuest: Gates of Discord|Gates of Discord]]'' (2004) expansions, respectively.\n\nThe classes can be grouped into five general roles that share similar characteristics, as described below.\n\n====Tank classes====\nMembers of this group have a high number of [[hitpoints]] for their level, and can equip heavy armor. They have the ability to [[taunt#Video games|taunt]] enemies into focusing on them, either directly or through the use of aggravating spells and abilities. This is to keep their more lightly-armored companions alive and well, who may otherwise provoke the wrath of one or more deadly creatures.\n\n* '''Warrior''': the prototypical [[tank (computer gaming)|tank]] class, able to avoid and mitigate more damage than any other. In a way, this is offset by their inability to cast spells. Owing to their stalwart defensive prowess, the Warrior often has a crucial role as main tank of a group or raid party, absorbing or mitigating the sustained assaults of enraged and often numerous opponents. Their high hit points also allow them to take more punishment than most other classes before succumbing, which gives healers a greater chance to keep them, and thus the party, alive and well. In their role as tank or proverbial damage sponge, the Warrior uses their ''Taunt'' skill to keep dangerous enemies trained on them, rather than chasing down overly-aggressive wizards or rogues, who may come under attack after landing a devastating backstab or lightning strike. All these qualities may help engender a sense of trust in a well-known and well-armored warrior, who can generally go toe-to-toe with a powerful mob for longer than any other class.\n* '''Shadow Knight''': a durable tank class; this Warrior/Necromancer hybrid has vampiric and [[damage-over-time]] spells.  Shadow Knights have the unique ability to ''Harm Touch'' (do direct damage) every seventy-two minutes, the power of which increases in absolute terms but decreases relative to enemies' hit points as a player [[Experience point|levels up]]. Since this class is a hybrid, they must wait longer than the Necromancer to begin receiving spells, and longer yet for the more potent incantations such as ''Summon Corpse'' and ''Feign Death''.  Shadow Knights are, after some time, able to summon a weak skeleton pet, as well as summon a player's corpse that is in the same zone as them, a vital skill when things have gone amiss in some dungeon. Their ''Feign Death'' spell, similar to but slightly less reliable than one possessed by the monk class, can prove useful in dangerous situations.\n* [[Paladin (character class)|'''Paladin''']]: the virtuous counterpart to the Shadow Knight, a Paladin is a hybrid Warrior/Cleric.  They were originally able to ''[[laying on of hands|Lay on Hands]]'' (heal themselves or another player) once every seventy-two minutes (real-time); Lay on Hands is now available as an innate ability. At mid-levels, paladins can purchase some resurrection spells. Paladins are tough in melee with some healing, protective, and stun spells. At mid-range levels, they can purchase a \"pacify\" line of spells that allows them to function as a puller for a group.  Like Shadow Knights, Paladins have powers which enable them to do comparatively greater damage to undead opponents.\n\n====Damage dealers====\nThe following classes are able to deal high corporeal damage to opponents. Within the game, these classes are often referred to as 'DPS', which stands for Damage Per Second. There isn't a definitive top DPS class, as damage dealt will depend on numerous factors which vary from one encounter to another (such as the enemy's armor, its positioning, and its magic resistance). Another complication is that while Wizards can readily deal tremendous damage to enemies, their ability to do so is limited by their remaining mana pool, as well as how fast they are able to regenerate mana. That said, Berserkers, Rogues, and Wizards are three classes most commonly cited as the highest overall damage dealers.\n\nThese melee damage dealers have a medium number of hit points per level, but cannot wear the heaviest armors and are less likely than a tank class to be able to survive direct attacks for a sustained period of time.\n*'''Beastlord''': A unique class which combines some powers from the Monk and Shaman classes along with a powerful pet.  Beastlords can imbue their pets with powers, and engage opponents with either hand-to-hand melee skills, or with weapons. They can de-buff enemies with spells, and possess modest healing abilities. This diverse array of skills allows Beastlords to be effective solo adventurers at many levels as well as being handy in a group.\n* '''Berserker''': A specialist form of the melee type, the Berserker is primarily a medium-armored, high-damage dealer that uses two-handed weapons and who can hurl axes and other miscellanea, often stunning their enemies, or hampering their movement.\n* [[Monk (character class)#In Everquest|'''Monk''']]: As masters of martial arts, Monks are the hand-to-hand fighting experts who can learn to use one-handed and two-handed blunt weapons, making them powerful opponents in close-quarters combat.  Monks get many, if not all, combat skills (dual wield, double attack, triple attack, etc.) before any other class.  Monks have the ability to ''feign death'' with a high degree of reliability, and possess additional skills that enable them to be a strong pulling class.  They have the ability to heal themselves, with a moderate cooldown, with the ''Mend'' ability.\n* [[Ranger (character class)|'''Ranger''']]: A versatile hybrid class combining some of a Warrior's fighting prowess with a Druid's spellcasting, Rangers are able to deal large amounts of damage both from a ranged distance and in close quarters. Their most unusual ability is to [[Tracking (hunting)|track]] unseen NPCs, for which they are highly valued as pullers in outdoor zones. Rangers also have the ability to taunt, and they possess a harmony line of spells (like pacify, but which only works outdoors) which allow them to play the role of tank to a limited degree. They can make use of archery better than any other class. Their line of snare spells (which hampers an enemy's movement) is very useful in groups looking for quick experience, by preventing enemies from running away, as well as allowing the Ranger to effectively kite a hostile creature.\n* [[Thief (character class)|'''Rogue''']]: With their backstab ability, which multiplies damage done to an unguarded enemy's back, Rogues are able to inflict massive amounts of damage, provided that they are in a group that can keep the opponent facing away from the Rogue.  Later in life, with the help of alternate advancement abilities, rogues are able to backstab opponents even when facing them.  Rogues have the ability to make poisons, pick pockets, and pick locks.  Their abilities early on to sneak and hide allow them to walk past both living and [[undead]] [[mob (computer gaming)|mobs]] without being seen.\n\n====Casters====\nCaster classes have the lowest hit points per level and can only wear the lightest of armors. Casters draw their power from an internal pool of ''mana'', which takes some time to regenerate and thus demands judicious and efficient use of spells.\n* '''Wizard''': The primary [[Nuke (gaming)|nuking]] class; these casters are able to deal catastrophic damage to enemies over a very short time from a distance, particularly with their ''Manaburn'' skill, although the length of encounters often makes manaburn inefficient to use. Wizards are considered to be the masters of teleportation, and have appropriate spells to facilitate group travel to certain locations, including designated safe spots when things turn sour for the whole group.  A Wizard's direct damage spells are generally from the fire, frost, and magic schools.\n* '''Magician''': Usually referred to as Mages, Magicians are similar to the Wizard class but with slightly less direct-damage spell power. They are able to summon strong elemental pets, from the domains of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, each with unique strengths and weaknesses.  They have the ability to conjure pet armor and weapons, food, drink, and ''mod rods'', which allow players to convert their health into [[mana]].  Magicians can summon party members to different parts of a zone with the ''Call of the Hero'' spell, which can be helpful in [[raid (computer gaming)|raid]] zones.  Magicians' direct damage spells are generally from the fire school.\n* '''Necromancer''': These masters of death are able to summon, [[Buff (computer gaming)|buff]], and heal powerful undead pets, as well as use poison, magic, fire, and disease [[Damage-over-Time|damage-over-time]] spells.<ref name=\"EQPlayers Necro Spells\">{{cite web | title=Necromancer Spell Reference | publisher=Sony Online Entertainment | url=http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/goToPage.action?goToPageNumber=1&result=spellsearch&spellSearch.classId=11 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716105058/http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/goToPage.action?goToPageNumber=1&result=spellsearch&spellSearch.classId=11 | archivedate=2011-07-16 | df= }}</ref>  Necromancers are able to feign death, snare enemies, and summon players' corpses that are in the same zone. They have a potent arsenal in their spellbook, particularly with their ability to snare then fear their opponent, as well their ability to lifetap \u2013 taking the enemy's health and using it to restore their own. This allows the Necromancer to function effectively without the services of other players, perhaps more so than any other class.\n\n====Crowd control / utility====\nThese classes share the ability to prevent enemies from attacking the party, as well as improving mana regeneration for themselves, teammates, and in the Enchanter's case, anyone they come across.\n* '''Enchanter''': A ''caster'' class that has few hit points per level and can wear only the lightest forms of armor, Enchanters are ''crowd control'' experts and are the most proficient class at ''Charming'', ''Stunning'', and ''Mesmerizing'' enemies. They have the ability to ''Memory Blur'' an opponent (causing them to forget they had been attacked) or ''Pacify'' an opponent (making them oblivious to antagonists in the area, but which has a small chance of backfiring), both of which may be extremely useful in avoiding unwanted skirmishes. Enchanters have a wide range of utility spells, including the ''Clarity'' (AKA 'crack' due to many caster class players becoming 'hooked' on the increased mana regeneration that this spell provides and constantly seek enchanters to cast it on them, often offering generous amounts of in-game currency) line of spells, which when cast on a player allows them to regenerate mana at an improved rate.  In addition to being able to both increase players' rate of attack (with the ''Haste'' line of spells), and ''Slowing'' that of enemies, Enchanters may also cast ''Illusions'' on themselves and others, which may have no real benefit (other than conferring a new look) or may grant tangible benefits such as underwater breathing, flight, or a vampiric touch. Illusions also adjust a character's faction standing with in-game NPC's, however, this is only relevant in old world locations and largely ignored in the current game. Lastly, Enchanters possess the unique ''Rune'' line of spells, which creates a magical protective buffer against all forms of damage until it has been worn down. This class is also uniquely suited for the jewelcraft trade, because it is the only class able to enchant metals. Enchanters possess some rudimentary direct-damage and damage-over-time offensive spells, all in the Magic school of casting, although using mana in this way is not often efficient or effective.\n* '''Bard''': a [[Jack of all trades, master of none|jack-of-all-trades]] class with fair melee ability, good armor, and the ability to play songs that benefit all nearby comrades. They can use crowd control songs in order to pacify hostile opponents, or help regenerate health and mana for their comrades using a different set of songs. Bards possess the unique ability to 'fade' from their enemies' memories.  This makes the bard an excellent pulling class.  Bards possess lesser versions of many of the special abilities of other classes.  They are known for their ability early on to increase the movement speed of their party faster than any mount or movement buff. Bards can weave the effects of up to four songs at once to confer the greatest advantage to their group.  Bards themselves often do not receive the full benefit of their songs, but they can still be an effective solo class at many levels, especially with their strong kiting proficiency. The Bard is also the only class able to cast spells from items, while running.\n\n====Healers====\nPriest classes have medium level of hit points per level and have access to healing and \"[[Buff (video gaming)|buff]]\" spells.\n* [[Cleric (character class)|'''Cleric''']]: The most powerful healer in the game, and for the first few years of ''EverQuest'' the only class capable of resurrection with experience regained, and the only class with the spell ''Complete Heal''. As the game has changed, ''Complete Heal'' has become less effective compared to the cleric's many different lines of more powerful and quicker (albeit more mana-intensive) heals. Primarily healers, the cleric also has some \"death save\" spells, as \"Divine Intervention\" and can increase spell casting haste with \"Blessing of Loyalty\".  Clerics can wear the heaviest plate-mail type armors. Clerics are great solo classes due to the introduction of the \"Vow of Valor\" line of spells, which provides the cleric with increased melee damage and a high rate of self-regeneration, at the cost of halving their direct heals' power.<ref>{{cite web|title = Allakhazam|url = http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=9764|accessdate = 2011-10-13|postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to \".\" for the cite to end in a \".\", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>\n* [[Druid (character class)|'''Druid''']]: A priest class that can cast healing spells, teleport, snare (to slow down enemies movement rate), and moderately-powerful nuking and damage-over-time spells, as well as charming animals to use them as pets. Druids may only wear leather armor, and have a number of transportation spells that allow speedy movement throughout much of the gaming world. Their combined tracking and foraging skills make them accomplished trade-skillers. Druids can, just like shamans, resurrect other players after a fight, but with the same experienced regained as a paladin, or a lower level cleric.\n* [[Shaman (character class)|'''Shaman''']]: Shamans can take many roles, and are often considered as a \"utility\" class. They are excellent in soloing, group and raid situations. While raiding, a shaman will primarily heal and enhance the attack rate of melee fighters, as well as decreasing the ferocity of opponents.  Shamans, or \"Shammies\" may cannibalize their health to restore mana, which means that they are able to keep casting their spells for much longer times than clerics or druids. They wear chain armor, and can summon an animal pet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://help.station.sony.com/cgi-bin/soe.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=821&p_created=1087929631&p_sid=nuPTOuZj&p_accessibility=0&p_redirect=1&p_srch=1&p_lva=16680&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9NDAsNDAmcF9wcm9kcz0xJnBfY2F0cz0wJnBfcHY9MS4xJnBfY3Y9JnBfc2VhcmNoX3R5cGU9YW5zd2Vycy5zZWFyY2hfbmwmcF9wYWdlPTEmcF9zZWFyY2hfdGV4dD1jbGFzc2VzIHNoYW1hbg!!&p_li=&p_topview=1|title=Class and Race Specific Tradeskills}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Deities===\n\nThere are several deities in ''EverQuest'' who each have a certain area of responsibility and play a role in the backstory of the game setting. A wide array of armor and weapons are also deity-tied, making it possible for only those who worship that deity to wear/equip them. Additionally, deities determine, to some extent, where characters may and may not go without being attacked on sight by the deity's minions and devoted followers.\n\n===Zones===\n\nThe ''EverQuest'' universe is divided into more than five hundred zones.<ref name=\"Everquest Main Page\">{{cite web | title=SOE Everquest page | url=https://www.everquest.com/game-overview | publisher=Sony}}</ref> These zones represent a wide variety of geographical features, including plains, oceans, cities, deserts, and other planes of existence. One of the most popular zones in the game is the Plane of Knowledge, one of the few zones in which all races and classes can coexist harmoniously without interference.  The Plane of Knowledge is also home to portals to many other zones, including portals to other planes and to the outskirts of nearly every starting city.\n\n==Expansions==\n{{main|EverQuest expansions}}\nThere have been twenty-four expansions to the original game since release. Expansions are purchased separately and provide additional content to the game (for example: raising the maximum character level; adding new races, classes, zones, continents, quests, equipment, game features). When you purchase the latest expansion you receive all previous expansions you may not have previously purchased. Additionally, the game is updated through downloaded patches. The ''EverQuest'' expansions are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Title !! Release Date !!

These names were originally the deities of the world of Norrath. In technical terms, each game server is actually a [[computer cluster|cluster]] of server machines. Once a character is created, it can be played only on that server unless the character is transferred to a new server by the customer service staff, generally for a fee. Each server often has a unique community and people often include the server name when identifying their character outside of the game.\n\n===OS X===\n\nSOE devoted one server (Al'Kabor) to an OS X version of the game, which opened for beta testing in early 2003, and officially released on June 24, 2003. The game was never developed beyond the Planes of Power expansion, and contained multiple features and bugs not seen on PC servers, as a side-effect of the codebase having been split from an early Planes of Power date but not updated with the PC codebase.  In January 2012, SOE announced plans to shut down the server, but based on the passionate response of the player base, rescinded the decision and changed Al'Kabor to a free-to-play subscription model.<ref>[http://forums.station.sony.com/eq/posts/list.m?topic_id=183277 EQMac will carry on!]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, SOE forums</ref> At about the same time, SOE revised the Macintosh client software to run natively on Intel processors.

Kane Bayle was merged into Antonius Bayle.\n\nWith the advent of the ''New Dawn'' promotion, three additional servers were set up and maintained by Ubisoft: Venril Sathir (British), Sebilis (French) and Kael Drakkal (German). The downside of the servers was that while it was possible to transfer to them, it was impossible to transfer off.\n\nThe servers were subsequently acquired by SOE and all three were merged into Antonius Bayle server.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tgdaily.com/games-and-entertainment-brief/1778-everquest-europe-joins-everquest-us |title=Everquest Europe joins EverQuest US |publisher=TG Daily |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324190133/http://www.tgdaily.com/games-and-entertainment-brief/1778-everquest-europe-joins-everquest-us |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = 85 / 100<ref name=MC>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/everquest |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=October 1, 2017 |title=EverQuest for PC Reviews}}</ref>\n| Allgame = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"allgamereview\">{{cite web| url = http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=16457&tab=review| title =EverQuest - Review| author = Couper, Chris | publisher = [[AllGame]]| accessdate =March 21, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210153319/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=16457&tab=review|archivedate=December 10, 2014}}</ref>\n| CGM = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=CGM>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdmag.com/articles/019/024/everquest_review.html |date=1999 |accessdate=October 1, 2017 |publisher=''[[Computer Games Magazine]]'' |title=EverQuest Review}}</ref>\n| GamePro = 5 / 5<ref name=GPro>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050313102937/http://www.gamepro.com/computer/pc/games/reviews/789.shtml |url=http://www.gamepro.com/computer/pc/games/reviews/789.shtml |archivedate=March 13, 2005 |date=April 1999 |accessdate=October 1, 2017 |author=Amrich, Dan |publisher=[[GamePro]] |title=EverQuest Review for PC}}</ref>\n| GameRev = A-<ref name=GRev>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/games/pc/rpg/everquest.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817185641/http://www.gamerevolution.com/games/pc/rpg/everquest.htm |author=Baldric |date=April 1999 |accessdate=October 1, 2017 |publisher=Game Revolution |archivedate=August 17, 2000 |title=Everquest - PC Review}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 8.4 / 10<ref name=GSpot>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/everquest-review/1900-2535859/ |publisher=[[Gamespot]] |accessdate=October 1, 2017 |title=EverQuest Review |author=Kasavin, Greg |date=April 2, 1999}}</ref>\n| IGN = 8.4 / 10<ref name=IGN>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/27/everquest-3 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=October 1, 2017 |title=EverQuest |author=Blevins, Tal |date=March 27, 1999}}</ref>\n| PCGUS = 86%<ref>{{cite journal |journal=''PC Gamer'' |date=June 1999 |page=122 |title=Everquest Review |issue=61}}</ref>\n}}\n\nReviews of ''Everquest'' were mostly positive upon release in 1999, earning an 85 out of 100 score from aggregate review website [[Metacritic]].<ref name=MC/> Comparing it to other online role-playing titles at the time, critics routinely called it \"the best game in its class,\"<ref name=GSpot/> the \"most immersive and most addictive online RPG to date.\"<ref name=IGN/> Dan Amrich of ''[[GamePro]]'' magazine declared that \"the bar for online gaming has not so much been raised as obliterated,\" and that the game's developers had \"created the first true online [[killer application|killer app]].\"<ref name=GPro/> The reviewer would find fault with its repetitive gameplay in the early levels and lack of sufficient documentation to help new players, urging them to turn to [[fansite]]s for help instead.<ref name=GPro/> Greg Kasavin of [[GameSpot]] similarly felt that the game's combat was \"uninteresting\" but did note that, unlike earlier games in the genre, ''EverQuest'' offered the opportunity to play on servers that wouldn't allow players to fight each other unless they chose to, and that it heavily promoted cooperation.<ref name=GSpot/> Ultimately, the reviewer would declare that \"the combat may be a little boring, the manual may be horrible, the quest system half-baked, and the game not without its small share of miscellaneous [[software bug|bugs]].

Another change is the shape of the big toe.  Recent studies suggest that Australopithecines still lived part of the time in trees as a result of maintaining a grasping big toe.  This was progressively lost in Habilines.\n\nAnatomically, the evolution of bipedalism has been accompanied by a large number of skeletal changes, not just to the legs and pelvis, but also to the [[Human vertebral column|vertebral column]], feet and ankles, and skull.<ref>{{harvnb|Aiello|Dean|1990}}</ref> The [[femur]] evolved into a slightly more angular position to move the center of gravity toward the geometric center of the body. The knee and ankle joints became increasingly robust to better support increased weight. To support the increased weight on each vertebra in the upright position, the human vertebral column became S-shaped and the [[lumbar vertebrae]] became shorter and wider. In the feet the big toe moved into alignment with the other toes to help in forward locomotion. The arms and forearms shortened relative to the legs making it easier to run. The foramen magnum migrated under the skull and more anterior.<ref>{{harvnb|Kondo|1985}}</ref>\n\nThe most significant changes occurred in the pelvic region, where the long downward facing [[ilium (bone)|iliac blade]] was shortened and widened as a requirement for keeping the center of gravity stable while walking;<ref name=\"Srivastava2009\" /> bipedal hominids have a shorter but broader, bowl-like pelvis due to this. A drawback is that the birth canal of bipedal apes is smaller than in knuckle-walking apes, though there has been a widening of it in comparison to that of australopithecine and modern humans, permitting the passage of newborns due to the increase in cranial size but this is limited to the upper portion, since further increase can hinder normal bipedal movement.<ref>{{harvnb|Strickberger|2000|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=feMItLo5gwgC&pg=PA476 475\u2013476]}}</ref>\n\nThe shortening of the pelvis and smaller birth canal evolved as a requirement for bipedalism and had significant effects on the process of human birth which is much more difficult in modern humans than in other primates. During human birth, because of the variation in size of the pelvic region, the fetal head must be in a transverse position (compared to the mother) during entry into the birth canal and rotate about 90 degrees upon exit.<ref>{{harvnb|Trevathan|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Potlqpl-jxgC&pg=PA20 20]}}</ref> The smaller birth canal became a limiting factor to brain size increases in early humans and prompted a shorter gestation period leading to the relative immaturity of human offspring, who are unable to walk much before 12 months and have greater [[neoteny]], compared to other primates, who are mobile at a much earlier age.<ref name=\"Curry2008 Child of Earth\">{{harvnb|Curry|2008|pp=106\u2013109}}</ref> The increased brain growth after birth and the increased dependency of children on mothers had a big effect upon the female reproductive cycle,<ref>Zuk, Marlene (2014), \"Paleofantasy: What Evolution Really Tells Us About Sex, Diet, and How We Live\" (W.

It was chosen originally by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his classification system. The word \"human\" is from the Latin ''humanus'', the adjectival form of ''homo''. The Latin \"homo\" derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root *''dhghem'', or \"earth\".<ref>{{harvnb|American Heritage Dictionaries (editors)|2006}}</ref> Linnaeus and other scientists of his time also considered the great apes to be the closest relatives of humans based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[Anatomy|anatomical]] similarities.\n\n===Darwin===\nThe possibility of linking humans with earlier apes by descent became clear only after 1859 with the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', in which he argued for the idea of the evolution of new species from earlier ones. Darwin's book did not address the question of human evolution, saying only that \"Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Darwin | first = Charles | year = 1859 | title = On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life | edition=  [http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/charles-darwin-on-the-origin-of-species/original.pdf Full image view] 1st | page = 488 | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=text&pageseq=506 | bibcode = 1872Natur...5..318B | volume = 5 | journal = Nature | doi = 10.1038/005318a0 | issue = 121 }}</ref>\n\nThe first debates about the nature of human evolution arose between [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Richard Owen]]. Huxley argued for human evolution from apes by illustrating many of the similarities and differences between humans and apes, and did so particularly in his 1863 book ''[[Man's Place in Nature|Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]''. However, many of Darwin's early supporters (such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and [[Charles Lyell]]) did not initially agree that the origin of the mental capacities and the moral sensibilities of humans could be explained by [[natural selection]], though this later changed. Darwin applied the theory of evolution and [[sexual selection]] to humans when he published ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' in 1871.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1981}}</ref>\n\n===First fossils===\nA major problem in the 19th century was the lack of [[Transitional fossil|fossil intermediaries]].

By constructing a calibration curve of the ID of species' pairs with known divergence times in the fossil record, the data could be used as a [[molecular clock]] to estimate the times of divergence of pairs with poorer or unknown fossil records.\n\nIn their seminal 1967 paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Sarich and Wilson estimated the divergence time of humans and apes as four to five million years ago,<ref name=MolClock/> at a time when standard interpretations of the fossil record gave this divergence as at least 10 to as much as 30 million years. Subsequent fossil discoveries, notably \"Lucy\", and reinterpretation of older fossil materials, notably ''[[Sivapithecus|Ramapithecus]]'', showed the younger estimates to be correct and validated the albumin method.\n\nProgress in [[DNA sequencing]], specifically [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) and then [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosome DNA]] (Y-DNA) advanced the understanding of human origins.<ref>{{harvnb|M'charek|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=n-K436zeUY8C&pg=PA96 96]}}</ref><ref name=\"DeSalleTattersall2008\">{{harvnb|DeSalle|Tattersall|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bf4Sitw7YaIC&pg=PA146 146]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Trent|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=772BEp8ZyMYC&pg=PA6 6]}}</ref> Application of the [[molecular clock]] principle revolutionized the study of [[molecular evolution]].\n\nOn the basis of a separation from the orangutan between 10 and 20 million years ago, earlier studies of the molecular clock suggested that there were about 76 mutations per generation that were not inherited by human children from their parents; this evidence supported the divergence time between hominins and chimps noted above. However, a 2012 study in Iceland of 78 children and their parents suggests a mutation rate of only 36 mutations per generation; this datum extends the separation between humans and chimps to an earlier period greater than 7 million years ago ([[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]). Additional research with 226 offspring of wild chimp populations in 8 locations suggests that chimps reproduce at age 26.5 years, on average; which suggests the human divergence from chimps occurred between 7 and 13 million years ago. And these data suggest that ''Ardipithecus'' (4.5 Ma), ''Orrorin'' (6 Ma) and ''Sahelanthropus'' (7 Ma) all may be on the hominid [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]], and even that the separation may have occurred outside the [[East African Rift]] region.\n\nFurthermore, analysis of the two species' genes in 2006 provides evidence that after human ancestors had started to diverge from chimpanzees, interspecies mating between \"proto-human\" and \"proto-chimps\" nonetheless occurred regularly enough to change certain genes in the new [[gene pool]]:\n: A new comparison of the human and chimp genomes suggests that after the two lineages separated, they may have begun interbreeding... A principal finding is that the [[X chromosome]]s of humans and chimps appear to have [[genetic divergence|diverged]] about 1.2 million years more recently than the other chromosomes.\nThe research suggests:\n: There were in fact two splits between the human and chimp lineages, with the first being followed by interbreeding between the two populations and then a second split.

White's 1995 discovery of ''Ardipithecus ramidus'', which pushed back the fossil record to {{ma|4.2}}.\n\nIn 2000, [[Martin Pickford]] and [[Brigitte Senut]] discovered, in the [[Tugen Hills]] of [[Kenya]], a 6-million-year-old bipedal hominin which they named ''[[Orrorin|Orrorin tugenensis]]''.

Subsequently, genetics has been used to investigate and resolve these issues. According to the [[Sahara pump theory]] evidence suggests that genus ''Homo'' have migrated out of Africa at least three and possibly four times (e.g. ''Homo erectus'', ''Homo heidelbergensis'' and two or three times for ''Homo sapiens''). Recent evidence suggests these dispersals are closely related to fluctuating periods of climate change.<ref>Peter B.  deMenocal, (2016) \"Climate Shocks\" (Scientific American Vol 25, No 4)</ref>\n\nRecent evidence suggests that humans may have left Africa half a million years earlier than previously thought.  A joint Franco-Indian team has found human artifacts in the Siwalk Hills north of New Delhi dating back at least 2.6 million years.  This is earlier than the previous earliest finding of genus ''Homo'' at [[Dmanisi]], in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], dating to 1.85 million years.  Although controversial, tools found at a Chinese cave strengthen the case that  humans used tools as far back as 2.48 million years ago.<ref>Barras, Colin (2016), \"Stone Tools hint humans reached Asia much earlier\" (New Scientist 6 February 2016)</ref>  This suggests that the Asian \"Chopper\" tool tradition, found in Java and northern China may have left Africa before the appearance of the [[Acheulian]] hand axe.\n\n====Dispersal of modern ''Homo sapiens''====\nUp until the genetic evidence became available there were two dominant models for the dispersal of modern humans.  The [[Multiregional Evolution|multiregional hypothesis]] proposed that the genus ''Homo'' contained only a single interconnected population as it does today (not separate species), and that its evolution took place worldwide continuously over the last couple of million years.

By comparing the parts of the genome that are not under natural selection and which therefore accumulate mutations at a fairly steady rate, it is possible to reconstruct a genetic tree incorporating the entire human species since the last shared ancestor.\n\nEach time a certain mutation ([[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]) appears in an individual and is passed on to his or her descendants a haplogroup is formed including all of the descendants of the individual who will also carry that mutation. By comparing mitochondrial DNA which is inherited only from the mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in all modern humans, the so-called mitochondrial Eve, must have lived around 200,000 years ago.\n\n====Genetics====\n{{Main|Human evolutionary genetics|Human genetic variation}}\nHuman evolutionary genetics studies how one [[human genome]] differs from the other, the evolutionary past that gave rise to it, and its current effects.

Each of these have been argued to be a [[bipedal]] ancestor of later hominins but, in each case, the claims have been contested. It is also possible that one or more of these species are ancestors of another branch of African apes, or that they represent a shared ancestor between hominins and other apes.\n\nThe question then of the relationship between these early fossil species and the hominin lineage is still to be resolved. From these early species, the australopithecines arose around {{mya|4}} and diverged into [[Paranthropus|robust]] (also called ''[[Paranthropus]]'') and [[Australopithecus|gracile]] branches, one of which (possibly ''[[Australopithecus garhi|A. garhi]]'') probably went on to become ancestors of the genus ''Homo''. The australopithecine species that is best represented in the fossil record is ''Australopithecus afarensis'' with more than one hundred fossil individuals represented, found from Northern Ethiopia (such as the famous \"Lucy\"), to Kenya, and [[South Africa]]. Fossils of robust australopithecines such as ''Au. robustus'' (or alternatively ''[[Paranthropus robustus]]'') and ''Au./P. boisei'' are particularly abundant in South Africa at sites such as [[Kromdraai]] and [[Swartkrans]], and around [[Lake Turkana]] in Kenya.\n\nThe earliest member of the genus ''Homo'' is ''Homo habilis'' which evolved around {{Mya|2.8}}.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> ''Homo habilis'' is the first species for which we have positive evidence of the use of stone tools. They developed the [[Oldowan]] lithic technology, named after the Olduvai Gorge in which the first specimens were found. Some scientists consider ''[[Homo rudolfensis]]'', a larger bodied group of fossils with similar morphology to the original ''H. habilis'' fossils, to be a separate species while others consider them to be part of ''H. habilis''\u2014simply representing intraspecies variation, or perhaps even [[sexual dimorphism]]. The brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee, and their main adaptation was bipedalism as an adaptation to terrestrial living.\n\nDuring the next million years, a process of encephalization began and, by the arrival (about {{Mya|1.9}}) of ''Homo erectus'' in the fossil record, cranial capacity had doubled. ''Homo erectus'' were the first of the hominins to emigrate from Africa, and, from {{Mya|1.8|1.3}}, this species spread through Africa, Asia, and Europe. One population of ''H. erectus'', also sometimes classified as a separate species ''Homo ergaster'', remained in Africa and evolved into ''Homo sapiens''. It is believed that these species, ''H. erectus'' and ''H. ergaster'', were the first to use fire and complex tools.\n\nThe earliest transitional fossils between ''H. ergaster/erectus'' and archaic ''H. sapiens'' are from Africa, such as ''Homo rhodesiensis'', but seemingly transitional forms were also found at [[Dmanisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. These descendants of African ''H. erectus'' spread through Eurasia from ca. 500,000 years ago evolving into ''H. antecessor'', ''H. heidelbergensis'' and ''H. neanderthalensis''. The earliest fossils of [[anatomically modern humans]] are from the Middle Paleolithic, about 200,000 years ago such as the [[Omo remains]] of Ethiopia; later fossils from [[Skhul and Qafzeh hominids|Es Skhul]] cave in [[Israel]] and Southern Europe begin around 90,000 years ago ({{Mya|0.09}}).\n\nAs modern humans spread out from Africa, they encountered other hominins such as ''Homo neanderthalensis'' and the so-called Denisovans, who may have evolved from populations of ''Homo erectus'' that had left Africa around {{mya|2}}.

Molecular evidence suggests that between 8 and 4 million years ago, first the gorillas, and then the chimpanzees (genus ''Pan'') split off from the line leading to the humans. Human DNA is approximately 98.4% identical to that of chimpanzees when comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms (see [[human evolutionary genetics]]). The fossil record, however, of gorillas and chimpanzees is limited; both poor preservation\u2014rain forest soils tend to be acidic and dissolve bone\u2014and [[sampling bias]] probably contribute to this problem.\n\nOther hominins probably adapted to the drier environments outside the equatorial belt; and there they encountered antelope, hyenas, dogs, pigs, elephants, horses, and others. The equatorial belt contracted after about 8 million years ago, and there is very little fossil evidence for the split\u2014thought to have occurred around that time\u2014of the hominin lineage from the lineages of gorillas and chimpanzees.

When commenting on the absence of aggressive canine morphology in ''Ar. ramidus'' and the implications this has for the evolution of hominin social psychology, they wrote:\n\n{{quote|Of course ''Ar. ramidus''  differs significantly from bonobos, bonobos having retained a functional canine honing complex. However, the fact that ''Ar. ramidus'' shares with bonobos reduced sexual dimorphism, and a more paedomorphic form relative to chimpanzees, suggests that the developmental and social adaptations evident in bonobos may be of assistance in future reconstructions of early hominin social and sexual psychology. In fact the trend towards increased maternal care, female mate selection and self-domestication may have been stronger and more refined in  ''Ar. ramidus'' than what we see in bonobos.{{r|aramidus|page1=128}}}}\n\nThe authors argue that many of the basic human adaptations evolved in the ancient forest and woodland ecosystems of late [[Miocene]] and early [[Pliocene]] Africa. Consequently, they argue that humans may not represent evolution from a chimpanzee-like ancestor as has traditionally been supposed. This suggests many modern human adaptations represent [[phylogeny|phylogenetically]] deep traits and that the behavior and morphology of chimpanzees may have evolved subsequent to the split with the common ancestor they share with humans.\n\n===Genus ''Australopithecus''===\n{{Main|Australopithecus}}\nThe genus ''Australopithecus'' evolved in eastern Africa around 4 million years ago before spreading throughout the continent and eventually becoming extinct 2 million years ago.

Many of these relate to the superior adaptation to cold environments possessed by the Neanderthal populations. Their [[surface to volume ratio]] is an extreme version of that found amongst [[Inuit]] populations, indicating that they were less inclined to lose body heat than were AMH. From brain Endocasts, Neanderthals also had significantly larger brains. This would seem to indicate that the intellectual superiority of AMH populations may be questionable. More recent research by Eiluned Pearce, Chris Stringer, R. I. M. Dunbar, however, have shown important differences in Brain architecture. For example, in both the orbital chamber size and in the size of the [[occipital lobe]], the larger size suggests that the Neanderthal had a better visual acuity than modern humans.  This would give a superior vision in the inferior light conditions found in Glacial Europe.  It also seems that the higher body mass of Neanderthals had a correspondingly larger brain mass required for body care and control.<ref name=\"dunbar\">{{Cite journal|first1=Eiluned |last1=Pearce|first2= Chris|last2= Stringer|first3= R.

These differences may have been sufficient to give Neanderthal populations an environmental superiority to AMH populations from 75,000 to 45,000 years BP. With these differences, Neanderthal brains show a smaller area was available for social functioning. Plotting group size possible from endocrainial volume, suggests that AMH populations (minus occipital lobe size), had a [[Dunbars number]] of 144 possible relationships. Neanderthal populations seem to have been limited to about 120 individuals. This would show up in a larger number of possible mates for AMH humans, with increased risks of inbreeding amongst Neanderthal populations. It also suggests that humans had larger trade catchment areas than Neanderthals (confirmed in the distribution of stone tools). With larger populations, social and technological innovations were easier to fix in human populations, which may have all contributed to the fact that modern Homo sapiens replaced the Neanderthal populations by 28,000 BP.<ref name=\"dunbar\"/>\n[[File:Neandertaler reconst.jpg|upright|thumb|Dermoplastic reconstruction of a Neanderthal]]\nEarlier evidence from sequencing mitochondrial DNA suggested that no significant gene flow occurred between ''H. neanderthalensis'' and ''H. sapiens'', and that the two were separate species that shared a common ancestor about 660,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Krings |first1=Matthias |last2=Stone |first2=Anne |last3=Schmitz |first3=Ralf W. |last4=Krainitzki |first4=Heike |last5=Stoneking |first5=Mark |last6=P\u00e4\u00e4bo |first6=Svante |date=July 11, 1997 |title=Neandertal DNA sequences and the origin of modern humans |journal=[[Cell (journal)|Cell]] |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=19\u201330 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80310-4 |issn=0092-8674 |pmid=9230299 |display-authors=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Richard E. |last2=Malaspinas |first2=Anna-Sapfo |last3=Krause |first3=Johannes |last4=Briggs |first4=Adrian W. |last5=Johnson |first5=Philip L.F. |last6=Uhler |first6=Caroline |last7=Meyer |first7=Matthias |last8=Good |first8=Jeffrey M. |last9=Maricic |first9=Tomislav |last10=Stenzel |first10=Udo |last11=Pr\u00fcfer |first11=Kay |last12=Siebauer |first12=Michael |last13=Burbano |first13=Hern\u00e1n A. |last14=Ronan |first14=Michael |last15=Rothberg |first15=Jonathan M. |last16=Egholm |first16=Michael |last17=Rudan |first17=Pavao |last18=Brajkovi\u0107 |first18=Dejana |last19=Ku\u0107an |first19=\u017deljko |last20=Gu\u0161i\u0107 |first20=Ivan |last21=Wikstr\u00f6m |first21=M\u00e5rten |last22=Laakkonen |first22=Liisa |last23=Kelso |first23=Janet |last24=Slatkin |first24=Montgomery |last25=P\u00e4\u00e4bo |first25=Svante |date=August 8, 2008 |title=A Complete Neandertal Mitochondrial Genome Sequence Determined by High-Throughput Sequencing |journal=Cell |volume=134 |issue=3 |pages=416\u2013426 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.06.021 |issn=0092-8674 |pmc=2602844 |pmid=18692465 |display-authors=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Serre |first1=David |last2=Langaney |first2=Andr\u00e9 |last3=Chech |first3=Mario |last4=Teschler-Nicola |last5=Paunovic |last6=Mennecier |last7=Hofreiter |last8=Possnert |last9=P\u00e4\u00e4bo |date=March 2004 |title=No Evidence of Neandertal mtDNA Contribution to Early Modern Humans |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=2 |issue=3 |page=e57 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020057 |issn=1545-7885 |pmc=368159 |pmid=15024415 |display-authors=3}}</ref> However, a sequencing of the Neanderthal genome in 2010 indicated that Neanderthals did indeed interbreed with anatomically modern humans ''circa'' 45,000 to 80,000 years ago (at the approximate time that modern humans migrated out from Africa, but before they dispersed into Europe, Asia and elsewhere).<ref name=\"neandersequence\">{{cite news |last=Viegas |first=Jennifer |date=May 6, 2010 |title=Neanderthals, Humans Interbred, DNA Proves |url=http://news.discovery.com/human/evolution/neanderthal-human-interbreed-dna.htm |work=Discovery News |location=Silver Spring, MD |publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC. |accessdate=2015-04-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508221757/http://news.discovery.com/human/evolution/neanderthal-human-interbreed-dna.htm |archive-date=May 8, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  The genetic sequencing of a 40,000 year old [[Pe\u0219tera cu Oase|human skeleton from Romania]] showed that 11% of its genome was Neanderthal, and it was estimated that the individual had a Neanderthal ancestor 4-6 generations previously,<ref>{{cite web|last=Calloway|first=Ewan|title=Early European may have had Neanderthal great-great-grandparent|publisher=Nature|date=13 May 2015|access-date=27 July 2018}}</ref> in addition to a contribution from earlier interbreeding in the Middle East.

He compared bones and muscles of human and chimpanzee thumbs, finding that humans have 3 muscles which are lacking in chimpanzees. Humans also have thicker metacarpals with broader heads, allowing more precise grasping than the chimpanzee hand can perform.

Although [[selection pressure]] on some traits, such as resistance to smallpox, has decreased in modern human life, humans are still undergoing natural selection for many other traits. Some of these are due to specific environmental pressures, while others are related to lifestyle changes since the development of agriculture (10,000 years ago), urban civilization (5,000), and [[industrialization]] (250 years ago). It has been argued that human evolution has accelerated since the development of agriculture 10,000 years ago and civilization some 5,000 years ago, resulting, it is claimed, in substantial genetic differences between different current human populations.<ref>{{harvnb|Cochran|Harpending|2009}}</ref>\n\nParticularly conspicuous is variation in superficial characteristics, such as [[Afro-textured hair]], or the recent evolution of [[light skin]] and [[blond]] hair in some populations, which are attributed to differences in climate. Particularly strong selective pressures have resulted in [[high-altitude adaptation in humans]], with different ones in different isolated populations. Studies of the [[High-altitude adaptation in humans#Genetic basis|genetic basis]] show that some developed very recently, with Tibetans evolving over 3,000 years to have high proportions of an allele of [[EPAS1]] that is adaptive to high altitudes.\n\nOther evolution is related to [[endemic disease]]s: the presence of [[malaria]] selected for [[sickle cell trait]] (the [[heterozygote]] form of sickle cell gene), while the absence of malaria and the health effects of [[sickle-cell anemia]] select against this trait. For example, the population at risk of the severe debilitating disease [[kuru (disease)|kuru]] has significant over-representation of an immune variant of the [[PRNP|prion protein]] gene G127V versus non-immune alleles. The frequency of this [[Mutation|genetic variant]] is due to the survival of immune persons.<ref>{{cite news |author=Medical Research Council (UK) |authorlink=Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) |date=November 21, 2009 |title=Brain Disease 'Resistance Gene' evolves in Papua New Guinea community; could offer insights Into CJD |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091120091959.htm |work=ScienceDaily |location=Rockville, MD |publisher=ScienceDaily, LLC |accessdate=2009-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0809716| pmid = 19923577| year = 2009| last1 = Mead | first1 = S.| last2 = Whitfield | first2 = J.| last3 = Poulter | first3 = M.| last4 = Shah | first4 = P.| last5 = Uphill | first5 = J.| last6 = Campbell | first6 = T.| last7 = Al-Dujaily | first7 = H.| last8 = Hummerich | first8 = H.| last9 = Beck | first9 = J.| last10 = Mein | first10 = C.

It centered on the Egyptians' interaction with many [[deity|deities]] who were believed to be present in, and in control of, the world. Rituals such as prayers and offerings were efforts to provide for the gods and gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered on the [[pharaoh]], the ruler of Egypt, who was believed to possess a divine power by virtue of their position. They acted as the [[intermediary]] between their people and the gods and was obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain [[maat|order in the universe]]. The state dedicated enormous resources to Egyptian rituals and to the construction of the [[Egyptian temple|temples]].\n\nIndividuals could interact with the gods for their own purposes, appealing for their help through prayer or compelling them to act through magic. These practices were distinct from, but closely linked with, the formal rituals and institutions. The popular religious tradition grew more prominent in the course of Egyptian history as the status of the Pharaoh declined. Another important aspect was the belief in the afterlife and [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|funerary practices]]. The Egyptians made great efforts to ensure the survival of their [[Egyptian soul|souls]] after death, providing tombs, grave goods, and offerings to preserve the bodies and spirits of the deceased.\n\nThe religion had its roots in Egypt's prehistory and lasted for more than 3,000 years. The details of religious belief changed over time as the importance of particular gods rose and declined, and their intricate relationships shifted.  At various times, certain gods became preeminent over the others, including the sun god [[Ra]], the creator god [[Amun]], and the mother goddess [[Isis]]. For a brief period, in the [[Atenism|theology]] promulgated by the Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]], a single god, the [[Aten]], replaced the traditional pantheon. Ancient Egyptian religion and mythology left behind many writings and monuments, along with significant influences on ancient and modern cultures.\n\n==Theology==\nThe beliefs and rituals now referred to as \"ancient Egyptian religion\" were integral within every aspect of Egyptian culture. [[Ancient Egyptian language|The Egyptian language]] possessed no single term corresponding to the modern European concept of religion. Ancient Egyptian religion was not a monolithic institution, but consisted of a vast and varying set of beliefs and practices, linked by their common focus on the interaction between the world of humans and the world of the divine. The characteristics of the gods who populated the divine realm were inextricably linked to the Egyptians' understanding of the properties of the world in which they lived.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | pp = 1\u20135, 80}}\n\n===Deities===\n{{Main|Ancient Egyptian deities}}\n[[File:La Tombe de Horemheb cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The gods Osiris, Anubis, and Horus, in order from left to right]]\nThe Egyptians believed that the phenomena of nature were divine forces in and of themselves.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | pp = 63\u201364, 82}}  These deified forces included the elements, animal characteristics, or abstract forces.  The Egyptians believed in a pantheon of gods, which were involved in all aspects of nature and human society. Their religious practices were efforts to sustain and placate these phenomena and turn them to human advantage.<ref name = \"Allen 43\">{{Harvnb | Allen | 2000 | pp = 43\u201344}}.</ref> This [[polytheism|polytheistic]] system was very complex, as some deities were believed to exist in many different manifestations, and some had multiple mythological roles.  Conversely, many natural forces, such as the sun, were associated with multiple deities.  The diverse pantheon ranged from gods with vital roles in the universe to minor deities or \"demons\" with very limited or localized functions.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 30, 32, 89}}  It could include gods adopted from foreign cultures, and sometimes humans: deceased Pharaohs were believed to be divine, and occasionally, distinguished commoners such as [[Imhotep]] also became deified.{{Sfn | Silverman | 1991 | pp = 55\u201358}}\n\nThe depictions of the gods in [[Art of ancient Egypt|art]] were not meant as literal representations of how the gods might appear if they were visible, as the gods' true natures were believed to be mysterious. Instead, these depictions gave recognizable forms to the abstract deities by using symbolic imagery to indicate each god's role in nature.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | p = 53}}  Thus, for example, the funerary god [[Anubis]] was portrayed as a [[jackal]], a creature whose scavenging habits threatened the preservation of the body, in an effort to counter this threat and employ it for protection.  His black skin was symbolic of the color of [[mummy|mummified]] flesh and the fertile black soil that Egyptians saw as a symbol of [[resurrection]]. This iconography was not fixed, and many of the gods could be depicted in more than one form.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 28, 187\u201389}}\n\nMany gods were associated with particular regions in Egypt where their cults were most important. However, these associations changed over time, and they did not mean that the god associated with a place had originated there. For instance, the god [[Montu]] was the original patron of the city of Thebes. Over the course of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], however, he was displaced in that role by Amun, who may have arisen elsewhere. The national popularity and importance of individual gods fluctuated in a similar way.{{Sfn | Teeter | 2001 | pp = 340\u201344}}\n\n[[File:Amun-Ra head.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Amun-Ra kamutef, wearing the plumed headdress of Amun and the sun disk representing Ra]]\n\n===Associations between deities===\nThe Egyptian gods had complex interrelationships, which partly reflected the interaction of the forces they represented. The Egyptians often grouped gods together to reflect these relationships. Some groups of deities were of indeterminate size, and were linked by their similar functions. These often consisted of minor deities with little individual identity. Other combinations linked independent deities based on the symbolic meaning of [[numbers in Egyptian mythology]]; for instance, pairs of deities usually represent the duality of opposite phenomena. One of the more common combinations was a family triad consisting of a father, mother, and child, who were worshipped together. Some groups had wide-ranging importance. One such group, the [[Ennead]], assembled nine deities into a theological system that was involved in the mythological areas of creation, kingship, and the afterlife.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 74\u201379}}\n\nThe relationships between deities could also be expressed in the process of [[syncretism]], in which two or more different gods were linked to form a composite deity.  This process was a recognition of the presence of one god \"in\" another when the second god took on a role belonging to the first.  These links between deities were fluid, and did not represent the permanent merging of two gods into one; therefore, some gods could develop multiple syncretic connections.{{Sfn | Dunand | Zivie-Coche | 2005 | pp = 27\u201328}} Sometimes, syncretism combined deities with very similar characteristics. At other times it joined gods with very different natures, as when Amun, the god of hidden power, was linked with [[Ra]], the god of the sun. The resulting god, Amun-Ra, thus united the power that lay behind all things with the greatest and most visible force in nature.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 33\u201335}}\n\n===Unifying tendencies===\nMany deities could be given epithets that seem to indicate that they were greater than any other god, suggesting some kind of unity beyond the multitude of natural forces. In particular, this is true of a few gods who, at various times in history, rose to supreme importance in Egyptian religion. These included the royal patron [[Horus]], the sun god [[Ra]], and the mother goddess [[Isis]].{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 36, 67}}  During the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550\u20131070 BC), Amun held this position. The theology of the period described in particular detail Amun's presence in and rule over all things, so that he, more than any other deity, embodied the all-encompassing power of the divine.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | pp = 189\u201392, 241\u201342}}\n\nBecause of theological statements like this, many past Egyptologists, such as {{ill|Siegfried Morenz|de}}, believed that beneath the polytheistic traditions of Egyptian religion there was an increasing belief in a unity of the divine, moving toward [[monotheism]]. Instances in Egyptian literature where \"god\" is mentioned without reference to any specific deity would seem to give this view added weight. However, in 1971 [[Erik Hornung]] pointed out that the traits of an apparently supreme being could be attributed to many different gods, even in periods when other gods were preeminent, and further argued that references to an unspecified  \"god\" are meant to refer flexibly to any deity. He therefore argued that, while some individuals may have [[henotheism|henotheistically]] chosen one god to worship, Egyptian religion as a whole had no notion of a divine being beyond the immediate multitude of deities. Yet the debate did not end there; [[Jan Assmann]] and [[James P. Allen]] have since asserted that the Egyptians did to some degree recognize a single divine force. In Allen's view, the notion of an underlying unity of the divine coexisted inclusively with the polytheistic tradition. It is possible that only the Egyptian theologians fully recognized this underlying unity, but it is also possible that ordinary Egyptians identified the single divine force with a single god in particular situations.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 36\u201339}}{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | pp = 10\u201311}}\n\n===Atenism===\n{{main |Atenism}}\nDuring the New Kingdom the pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] abolished the official worship of other gods in favor of the sun-disk [[Aten]]. This is often seen as the first instance of true monotheism in history, although the details of Atenist theology are still unclear and the suggestion that it was monotheistic is disputed. The exclusion of all but one god from worship was a radical departure from Egyptian tradition and some see Akhenaten as a practitioner of [[monolatry]] rather than monotheism,<ref>{{Citation | first = Dominic | last = Montserrat | author-link = Dominic Montserrat | title = Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt | publisher = Routledge | year = 2000 | ISBN = 0-415-18549-1 | pages = 36ff}}.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Najovits|first=Simson|title= Egypt, trunk of the tree | volume = 2 |year=2003|publisher=Algora|isbn=978-0-87586-256-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrR848g3gp8C&pg=PA88 |pages=131\u201344}}</ref> as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshipping any but the Aten. Under Akhenaten's successors Egypt reverted to its traditional religion, and Akhenaten himself came to be reviled as a heretic.{{Sfn | Dunand | Zivie-Coche | 2005 | p = 35}}{{Sfn | Allen | 2000 | p = 198}}\n\n==Other important concepts==\n\n===Cosmology===\n[[File:Geb, Nut, Shu.jpg|thumb|280px|The air god Shu, assisted by other gods, holds up Nut, the sky, as Geb, the earth, lies beneath.]]\nThe Egyptian conception of the universe centered on ''[[Maat]]'', a word that encompasses several concepts in English, including \"truth\", \"justice\", and \"order.\"  It was the fixed, eternal order of the universe, both in the cosmos and in human society. It had existed since the creation of the world, and without it the world would lose its cohesion. In Egyptian belief, Maat was constantly under threat from the forces of disorder, so all of society was required to maintain it. On the human level this meant that all members of society should cooperate and coexist; on the cosmic level it meant that all of the forces of nature\u2014the gods\u2014should continue to function in balance.<ref name= \"Allen 115\">{{Harvnb | Allen | 2000 | pp = 115\u201317}}.</ref> This latter goal was central to Egyptian religion. The Egyptians sought to maintain Maat in the cosmos by sustaining the gods through offerings and by performing rituals which staved off disorder and perpetuated the cycles of nature.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | pp = 4\u20135}}<ref name=\"Shafer 2\">{{Harvnb | Shafer | 1997 | pp = 2\u20134}}.</ref>\n\nThe most important part of the Egyptian view of the cosmos was the conception of time, which was greatly concerned with the maintenance of Maat. Throughout the linear passage of time, a cyclical pattern recurred, in which Maat was renewed by periodic events which echoed the original creation. Among these events were the annual Nile flood and the succession from one king to another, but the most important was the daily journey of the sun god Ra.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | pp = 68\u201379}}{{Sfn | Allen | 2000 | pp = 104, 127}}\n\nWhen thinking of the shape of the cosmos, the Egyptians saw the earth as a flat expanse of land, personified by the god [[Geb]], over which arched the sky goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]]. The two were separated by Shu, the god of air. Beneath the earth lay a parallel [[underworld]] and undersky, and beyond the skies lay the infinite expanse of [[Nu (mythology)|Nu]], the chaos that had existed before creation.{{Sfn | Lesko | 1991 | pp = 117\u201321}}{{Sfn | Dunand | Zivie-Coche | 2005 | pp = 45\u201346}}  The Egyptians also believed in a place called the [[Duat]], a mysterious region associated with death and rebirth, that may have lain in the underworld or in the sky.  Each day, Ra traveled over the earth across the underside of the sky, and at night he passed through the Duat to be reborn at dawn.<ref>Allen, James P., \"The Cosmology of the Pyramid Texts\", in {{Harvnb | Simpson | 1989 | pp = 20\u201326}}.</ref>\n\nIn Egyptian belief, this cosmos was inhabited by three types of sentient beings. One was the gods; another was the spirits of deceased humans, who existed in the divine realm and possessed many of the gods' abilities. Living humans were the third category, and the most important among them was the pharaoh, who bridged the human and divine realms.{{Sfn | Allen | 2000 | p = 31}}\n\n[[File:RamsesIIEgypt.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Colossal statue of the Pharaoh [[Ramesses II]]]]\n\n===Divine pharaoh===\n{{see also|Pharaoh}}\nEgyptologists have long debated the degree to which the Pharaoh was considered a god. It seems most likely that the Egyptians viewed royal authority itself as a divine force.  Therefore, although the Egyptians recognized that the Pharaoh was human and subject to human weakness, they simultaneously viewed him as a god, because the divine power of kingship was incarnated in him. He therefore acted as intermediary between Egypt's people and the gods.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 54\u201356}}  He was key to upholding Maat, both by maintaining justice and harmony in human society and by sustaining the gods with temples and offerings. For these reasons, he oversaw all state religious activity.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | pp = 5\u20136}}  However, the Pharaoh's real-life influence and prestige could differ from that depicted in official writings and depictions, and beginning in the late New Kingdom his religious importance declined drastically.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | p = 55}}<ref>Van Dijk, Jacobus, \u201cThe Amarna Period and the Later New Kingdom\", in {{Harvnb | Shaw | 2000 | pp = 311\u201312}}.</ref>\n\nThe king was also associated with many specific deities. He was identified directly with Horus, who represented kingship itself, and he was seen as the son of Ra, who ruled and regulated nature as the Pharaoh ruled and regulated society.  By the New Kingdom he was also associated with Amun, the supreme force in the cosmos.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 69, 95, 184}}  Upon his death, the king became fully deified. In this state, he was directly identified with Ra, and was also associated with [[Osiris]], god of death and rebirth and the mythological father of Horus.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 60\u201363}}  Many mortuary temples were dedicated to the worship of deceased pharaohs as gods.<ref name=\"Shafer 2\"/>\n\n===Afterlife<!--linked from 'Ancient Egyptian burial customs'-->===\nThe Egyptians had elaborate beliefs about death and the afterlife. They believed that humans possessed a ''[[Egyptian soul#Ka|ka]]'', or life-force, which left the body at the point of death. In life, the ''ka'' received its sustenance from food and drink, so it was believed that, to endure after death, the ''ka'' must continue to receive offerings of food, whose spiritual essence it could still consume. Each person also had a ''[[Egyptian soul#Ba|ba]]'', the set of spiritual characteristics unique to each individual.{{Sfn | Allen | 2000 | pp = 79\u201380}}  Unlike the ''ka'', the ''ba'' remained attached to the body after death. Egyptian funeral rituals were intended to release the ''ba'' from the body so that it could move freely, and to rejoin it with the ''ka'' so that it could live on as an ''[[Egyptian soul#Akh|akh]]''. However, it was also important that the body of the deceased be preserved, as the Egyptians believed that the ''ba'' returned to its body each night to receive new life, before emerging in the morning as an ''akh''.{{Sfn | Allen | 2000 | pp = 94\u201395}}\n\nIn early times the deceased pharaoh was believed to [[The Indestructibles#Cosmogony|ascend to the sky and dwell among the stars]].{{Sfn | Taylor | 2001 | p = 25}}  Over the course of the [[Old Kingdom]] (c. 2686\u20132181 BC), however, he came to be more closely associated with the daily rebirth of the sun god [[Ra]] and with the underworld ruler [[Osiris]] as those deities grew more important.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 90, 94\u201395}}\n\n===Judgment {{anchor |Weighing of the Heart}}===\nIn the fully developed afterlife beliefs of the New Kingdom, the soul had to avoid a variety of supernatural dangers in the [[Duat]], before undergoing a final judgment, known as the \"Weighing of the Heart\", carried out by Osiris and by the [[Assessors of Maat]]. In this judgment, the gods compared the actions of the deceased while alive (symbolized by the heart) to Maat, to determine whether he or she had behaved in accordance with Maat. If the deceased was judged worthy, his or her ''ka'' and ''ba'' were united into an ''akh''.{{Sfn | Fleming | Lothian | 1997 | p = 104}}  Several beliefs coexisted about the ''akh''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s destination. Often the dead were said to dwell in the realm of Osiris, a lush and pleasant land in the [[underworld]].{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 160\u201361}} The solar vision of the afterlife, in which the deceased soul traveled with Ra on his daily journey, was still primarily associated with royalty, but could extend to other people as well. Over the course of the Middle and New Kingdoms, the notion that the ''akh'' could also travel in the world of the living, and to some degree magically affect events there, became increasingly prevalent.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2005 | pp = 209\u201310, 398\u2013402}}\n\n==Writings==\n{{see also|Ancient Egyptian literature}}\nWhile the Egyptians had no unified religious scripture, they produced many religious writings of various types. Together the disparate texts provide a very extensive, but still incomplete, understanding of Egyptian religious practices and beliefs.{{Sfn | Traunecker | 2001 | pp = 1\u20135}}\n\n===Mythology===<!--This section is linked from [[Ancient Egyptian creation myths]]-->\n{{main |Egyptian mythology}}\n[[File:Book of Gates Barque of Ra cropped.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Ra]] (at center) travels through the underworld in his barque, accompanied by other gods{{Sfn |Wilkinson |2003 | pp = 222\u2013223}}]]\nEgyptian myths were metaphorical stories intended to illustrate and explain the gods' actions and roles in nature. The details of the events they recounted could change to convey different symbolic perspectives on the mysterious divine events they described, so many myths exist in different and conflicting versions.{{Sfn | Tobin | 2001 | pp = 464\u201368}}  Mythical narratives were rarely written in full, and more often texts only contain episodes from or allusions to a larger myth.{{Sfn | Pinch | 1995 | p = 18}}  Knowledge of Egyptian mythology, therefore, is derived mostly from hymns that detail the roles of specific deities, from ritual and magical texts which describe actions related to mythic events, and from funerary texts which mention the roles of many deities in the afterlife. Some information is also provided by allusions in secular texts.{{Sfn | Traunecker | 2001 | pp = 1\u20135}}  Finally, Greeks and Romans such as [[Plutarch]] recorded some of the extant myths late in Egyptian history.{{Sfn | Fleming | Lothian | 1997 | p = 26}}\n\nAmong the significant Egyptian myths were the [[Ancient Egyptian creation myths|creation myths]]. According to these stories, the world emerged as a dry space in the primordial ocean of chaos.  Because the sun is essential to life on earth, the first rising of Ra marked the moment of this emergence. Different forms of the myth describe the process of creation in various ways: a transformation of the primordial god [[Atum]] into the elements that form the world, as the creative speech of the intellectual god [[Ptah]], and as an act of the hidden power of Amun.{{Sfn | Allen | 2000 | pp = 143\u201345, 171\u201373, 182}}  Regardless of these variations, the act of creation represented the initial establishment of maat and the pattern for the subsequent cycles of time.<ref name=\"Shafer 2\"/>\n\nThe most important of all Egyptian myths was the [[myth of Osiris and Isis]].{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | p = 124}}  It tells of the divine ruler Osiris, who was murdered by his jealous brother [[Set (mythology)|Set]], a god often associated with chaos.{{Sfn | Fleming | Lothian | 1997 | pp = 76, 78}}  Osiris' sister and wife [[Isis]] resurrected him so that he could conceive an heir, Horus.  Osiris then entered the underworld and became the ruler of the dead.  Once grown, Horus fought and defeated Set to become king himself.{{Sfn | Quirke | Spencer | 1992 | p = 67}}  Set's association with chaos, and the identification of Osiris and Horus as the rightful rulers, provided a rationale for Pharaonic succession and portrayed the Pharaohs as the upholders of order.  At the same time, Osiris' death and rebirth were related to the Egyptian agricultural cycle, in which crops grew in the wake of the Nile inundation, and provided a template for the resurrection of human souls after death.{{Sfn | Fleming | Lothian | 1997 | pp = 84, 107\u2013108}}\n\nAnother important mythic motif was the journey of Ra through the Duat each night. In the course of this journey, Ra met with Osiris, who again acted as an agent of regeneration, so that his life was renewed. He also fought each night with [[Apep]], a serpentine god representing chaos. The defeat of Apep and the meeting with Osiris ensured the rising of the sun the next morning, an event that represented rebirth and the victory of order over chaos.{{Sfn | Fleming | Lothian | 1997 | pp = 33, 38\u201339}}\n\n===Ritual and magical texts===\nThe procedures for religious rituals were frequently written on papyri, which were used as instructions for those performing the ritual.  These ritual texts were kept mainly in the temple libraries. Temples themselves are also inscribed with such texts, often accompanied by illustrations. Unlike the ritual papyri, these inscriptions were not intended as instructions, but were meant to symbolically perpetuate the rituals even if, in reality, people ceased to perform them.{{Sfn | Dunand | Zivie-Coche | 2005 | pp = 93\u201399}}  Magical texts likewise describe rituals, although these rituals were part of the spells used for specific goals in everyday life. Despite their mundane purpose, many of these texts also originated in temple libraries and later became disseminated among the general populace.{{Sfn | Pinch | 1995 | p = 63}}\n\n===Hymns and prayers===\nThe Egyptians produced numerous prayers and hymns, written in the form of poetry. Hymns and prayers follow a similar structure and are distinguished mainly by the purposes they serve. Hymns were written to praise particular deities.<ref name=\"Foster\">{{Harvnb | Foster | 2001 | loc = vol. II, pp. 312\u201317}}.</ref> Like ritual texts, they were written on papyri and on temple walls, and they were probably recited as part of the rituals they accompany in temple inscriptions.{{Sfn | Dunand | Zivie-Coche | 2005 | p = 94}}  Most are structured according to a set literary formula, designed to expound on the nature, aspects, and mythological functions of a given deity.<ref name=\"Foster\"/> They tend to speak more explicitly about fundamental theology than other Egyptian religious writings, and became particularly important in the New Kingdom, a period of particularly active theological discourse.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | p = 166}}  Prayers follow the same general pattern as hymns, but address the relevant god in a more personal way, asking for blessings, help, or forgiveness for wrongdoing. Such prayers are rare before the New Kingdom, indicating that in earlier periods such direct personal interaction with a deity was not believed possible, or at least was less likely to be expressed in writing. They are known mainly from inscriptions on statues and [[stelae]] left in sacred sites as [[votive offering]]s.<ref name=\"Ockinga\">Ockinga, Boyo, \"Piety\", in {{Harvnb | Redford | 2001 | loc = vol. III, pp. 44\u201346}}.</ref>\n\n===Funerary texts===\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian funerary texts}}\n[[File:BD Hunefer cropped 1.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Section of the Book of the Dead for the scribe [[Hunefer]], depicting the Weighing of the Heart.]]\nAmong the most significant and extensively preserved Egyptian writings are [[Ancient Egyptian funerary texts|funerary texts]] designed to ensure that deceased souls reached a pleasant afterlife.{{Sfn | Allen | 2000 | p = 315}}  The earliest of these are the [[Pyramid Texts]]. They are a loose collection of hundreds of spells inscribed on the walls of royal pyramids during the Old Kingdom, intended to magically provide pharaohs with the means to join the company of the gods in the afterlife.{{Sfn | Hornung | 1999 | pp = 1\u20135}}  The spells appear in differing arrangements and combinations, and few of them appear in all of the pyramids.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | p = 93}}\n\nAt the end of the Old Kingdom a new body of funerary spells, which included material from the Pyramid Texts, began appearing in tombs, inscribed primarily on coffins. This collection of writings is known as the [[Coffin Texts]], and was not reserved for royalty, but appeared in the tombs of non-royal officials.{{Sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp = 194\u201395}}  In the New Kingdom, several new funerary texts emerged, of which the best-known is the [[Book of the Dead]].  Unlike the earlier books, it often contains extensive illustrations, or vignettes.{{Sfn | Hornung | 1999 | pp = xvii, 14}}  The book was copied on papyrus and sold to commoners to be placed in their tombs.{{Sfn | Quirke | Spencer | 1992 | p = 98}}\n\nThe Coffin Texts included sections with detailed descriptions of the underworld and instructions on how to overcome its hazards. In the New Kingdom, this material gave rise to several \"books of the netherworld\", including the [[Book of Gates]], the [[Book of Caverns]], and the [[Amduat]].{{Sfn | Allen | 2000 | pp = 316\u201317}}  Unlike the loose collections of spells, these netherworld books are structured depictions of Ra's passage through the Duat, and by analogy, the journey of the deceased person's soul through the realm of the dead. They were originally restricted to pharaonic tombs, but in the Third Intermediate Period they came to be used more widely.{{Sfn | Hornung | 1999 | pp = 26\u201327, 30}}\n\nAs Egypt  became more modernized, its archaic practices were substituted with new and efficient scientific techniques. Some of these scientific advancements were related to the development of mummification. By enhancing their advanced practice of mummification, the Egyptians were able to reach a new level of excellency concerning afterlife.\n\n==Practices==\n[[File:Philae, First Pylon and Columnade, Aswan, Egypt, Oct 2004.jpg|300px|thumb|right|First [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]] and colonnade of the Temple of [[Isis]] at [[Philae]].]]\n\n===Temples===\n{{main |Egyptian temple}}\nTemples existed from the beginning of Egyptian history, and at the height of the civilization they were present in most of its towns. They included both mortuary temples to serve the spirits of deceased pharaohs and temples dedicated to patron gods, although the distinction was blurred because divinity and kingship were so closely intertwined.<ref name= \"Shafer 2\"/> The temples were not primarily intended as places for worship by the general populace, and the common people had a complex set of religious practices of their own. Instead, the state-run temples served as houses for the gods, in which physical images which served as their intermediaries were cared for and provided with offerings. This service was believed to be necessary to sustain the gods, so that they could in turn maintain the universe itself.<ref name=\"Wilkinson 42\">{{Harvnb | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 42\u201344}}.</ref> Thus, temples were central to Egyptian society, and vast resources were devoted to their upkeep, including both donations from the monarchy and large estates of their own.  Pharaohs often expanded them as part of their obligation to honor the gods, so that many temples grew to enormous size.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2000 | pp = 8\u20139, 50}}  However, not all gods had temples dedicated to them, as many gods who were important in official theology received only minimal worship, and many household gods were the focus of popular veneration rather than temple ritual.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2000 | p = 82}}\n\nThe earliest Egyptian temples were small, impermanent structures, but through the Old and Middle Kingdoms their designs grew more elaborate, and they were increasingly built out of stone. In the New Kingdom, a basic temple layout emerged, which had evolved from common elements in Old and Middle Kingdom temples. With variations, this plan was used for most of the temples built from then on, and most of those that survive today adhere to it. In this standard plan, the temple was built along a central processional way that led through a series of courts and halls to the sanctuary, which held a statue of the temple's god. Access to this most sacred part of the temple was restricted to the pharaoh and the highest-ranking priests. The journey from the temple entrance to the sanctuary was seen as a journey from the human world to the divine realm, a point emphasized by the complex mythological symbolism present in temple architecture.{{Sfn | Dunand | Zivie-Coche | 2005 | pp = 72\u201382, 86\u201389}}  Well beyond the temple building proper was the outermost wall. In the space between the two lay many subsidiary buildings, including workshops and storage areas to supply the temple's needs, and the library where the temple's sacred writings and mundane records were kept, and which also served as a center of learning on a multitude of subjects.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2000 | pp = 72\u201375}}\n\nTheoretically it was the duty of the pharaoh to carry out temple rituals, as he was Egypt's official representative to the gods. In reality, ritual duties were almost always carried out by priests. During the Old and Middle Kingdoms, there was no separate class of priests; instead, many government officials served in this capacity for several months out of the year before returning to their secular duties. Only in the New Kingdom did professional priesthood become widespread, although most lower-ranking priests were still part-time. All were still employed by the state, and the pharaoh had final say in their appointments.{{sfn|Shafer|1997|p=9}} However, as the wealth of the temples grew, the influence of their priesthoods increased, until it rivaled that of the pharaoh. In the political fragmentation of the [[Third Intermediate Period]] (c. 1070\u2013664 BC), the high priests of Amun at Karnak even became the effective rulers of [[Upper Egypt]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp= 9, 25\u201326}} The temple staff also included many people other than priests, such as musicians and chanters in temple ceremonies. Outside the temple were artisans and other laborers who helped supply the temple's needs, as well as farmers who worked on temple estates. All were paid with portions of the temple's income. Large temples were therefore very important centers of economic activity, sometimes employing thousands of people.{{sfn|Wilkinson | 2000 | pp = 92\u201393}}\n\n===Official rituals and festivals===\nState religious practice included both temple rituals involved in the cult of a deity, and ceremonies related to divine kingship. Among the latter were [[coronation of the pharaoh|coronation ceremonies]] and the [[sed festival]], a ritual renewal of the pharaoh's strength that took place periodically during his reign.<ref name=\"Thompson\">Thompson, Stephen E., \"Cults: Overview\", in Redford 2001, vol. I, 326\u2013332</ref> There were numerous temple rituals, including rites that took place across the country and rites limited to single temples or to the temples of a single god. Some were performed daily, while others took place annually or on rarer occasions.<ref name=\"Wilkinson 95\">{{harvnb|Wilkinson | 2000|p= 95}}</ref> The most common temple ritual was the morning offering ceremony, performed daily in temples across Egypt. In it, a high-ranking priest, or occasionally the pharaoh, washed, anointed, and elaborately dressed the god's statue before presenting it with offerings. Afterward, when the god had consumed the spiritual essence of the offerings, the items themselves were taken to be distributed among the priests.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>\n\nThe less frequent temple rituals, or festivals, were still numerous, with dozens occurring every year. These festivals often entailed actions beyond simple offerings to the gods, such as reenactments of particular myths or the symbolic destruction of the forces of disorder.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2005|pp= 93\u201395}}; {{harvnb|Shafer| 1997| p= 25}}</ref> Most of these events were probably celebrated only by the priests and took place only inside the temple.<ref name=\"Wilkinson 95\"/> However, the most important temple festivals, like the [[Opet Festival]] celebrated at Karnak, usually involved a procession carrying the god's image out of the sanctuary in a model barque to visit other significant sites, such as the temple of a related deity. Commoners gathered to watch the procession and sometimes received portions of the unusually large offerings given to the gods on these occasions.{{sfn|Shafer| 1997| pp= 27\u201328}}\n\n===Animal cults===\n[[File:Apis bull on coffin.jpg|thumb|150px|The Apis bull]]\nAt many sacred sites, the Egyptians worshipped individual animals which they believed to be manifestations of particular deities. These animals were selected based on specific sacred markings which were believed to indicate their fitness for the role. Some of these cult animals retained their positions for the rest of their lives, as with the [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis bull]] worshipped in Memphis as a manifestation of Ptah. Other animals were selected for much shorter periods. These cults grew more popular in later times, and many temples began raising stocks of such animals from which to choose a new divine manifestation.{{sfn|Dunand|Zivie-Coche |2005| pp =  21, 83}} A separate practice developed in the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty]], when people began mummifying any member of a particular animal species as an offering to the god whom the species represented. Millions of mummified [[cat]]s, birds, and other creatures were buried at temples honoring Egyptian deities.{{sfn|Quirke | Spencer| 1992| pp = 78, 92\u201394}}<ref name=Owen2004>{{Cite journal| title = Egyptian Animals Were Mummified Same Way as Humans| url = https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/09/0915_040915_petmummies.html| year = 2004| author = Owen, James| journal = National Geographic News| accessdate = 2010-08-06| postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Egyptian oracles are known mainly from the New Kingdom and afterward, though they probably appeared much earlier. People of all classes, including the king, asked questions of oracles, and, especially in the late New Kingdom their answers could be used to settle legal disputes or inform royal decisions.<ref>Kruchten, Jean-Marie, \"Oracles\", in {{harvnb|Redford| 2001| pp= 609\u2013611}}</ref> The most common means of consulting an oracle was to pose a question to the divine image while it was being carried in a festival procession, and interpret an answer from the barque's movements. Other methods included interpreting the behavior of cult animals, drawing lots, or consulting statues through which a priest apparently spoke. The means of discerning the god's will gave great influence to the priests who spoke and interpreted the god's message.{{sfn|Frankfurter| 1998| pp= 145\u2013152}}\n\n===Popular religion===\nWhile the state cults were meant to preserve the stability of the Egyptian world, lay individuals had their own religious practices that related more directly to daily life.{{sfn|Sadek| 1988| pp= 1\u20132}} This popular religion left less evidence than the official cults, and because this evidence was mostly produced by the wealthiest portion of the Egyptian population, it is uncertain to what degree it reflects the practices of the populace as a whole.<ref name=\"Wilkinson 46\">{{harvnb|Wilkinson| 2003| pp= 46}}</ref>\n\nPopular religious practice included ceremonies marking important transitions in life. These included birth, because of the danger involved in the process, and [[naming ceremony|naming]], because the name was held to be a crucial part of a person's identity. The most important of these ceremonies were those surrounding death (see \"Funerary practices\" below), because they ensured the soul's survival beyond it.{{sfn|Dunand | Zivie-Coche| 2005| pp= 128\u2013131}} Other religious practices sought to discern the gods' will or seek their knowledge. These included the interpretation of dreams, which could be seen as messages from the divine realm, and the consultation of oracles. People also sought to affect the gods' behavior to their own benefit through magical rituals (see \"Magic\" below).<ref>Baines, in {{harvnb|Shafer| 1991| pp= 164\u2013171}}</ref>\n\nIndividual Egyptians also prayed to gods and gave them private offerings. Evidence of this type of personal piety is sparse before the New Kingdom. This is probably due to cultural restrictions on depiction of nonroyal religious activity, which relaxed during the Middle and New Kingdoms. Personal piety became still more prominent in the late New Kingdom, when it was believed that the gods intervened directly in individual lives, punishing wrongdoers and saving the pious from disaster.<ref name=\"Ockinga\"/> Official temples were important venues for private prayer and offering, even though their central activities were closed to laypeople. Egyptians frequently donated goods to be offered to the temple deity and objects inscribed with prayers to be placed in temple courts. Often they prayed in person before temple statues or in shrines set aside for their use.<ref name=\"Wilkinson 46\"/> Yet in addition to temples, the populace also used separate local chapels, smaller but more accessible than the formal temples. These chapels were very numerous, and probably staffed by members of the community.<ref>Lesko, Barbara S. \"Cults: Private Cults\", in Redford 2001, vol. I, pp. 336\u2013339</ref> Households, too, often had their own small shrines for offering to gods or deceased relatives.{{sfn|Sadek |1988| pp= 76\u201378}}\n\nThe deities invoked in these situations differed somewhat from those at the center of state cults. Many of the important popular deities, such as the fertility goddess [[Taweret]] and the household protector [[Bes]], had no temples of their own. However, many other gods, including Amun and Osiris, were very important in both popular and official religion.{{sfn|David| 2002| pp= 273, 276\u2013277}} Some individuals might be particularly devoted to a single god. Often they favored deities affiliated with their own region, or with their role in life. The god [[Ptah]], for instance, was particularly important in his cult center of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], but as the patron of craftsmen he received the nationwide veneration of many in that occupation.{{sfn|Traunecker| 2001| p= 98}}\n\n===Magic===\n{{main|Heka_(god)|l1=Heka}}\nThe word \"magic\" could be used to translate the Egyptian term ''heka'', which meant, as [[James P. Allen]] puts it, \"the ability to make things happen by indirect means\".{{sfn|Allen| 2000| pp= 156\u2013157}} Heka was believed to be a natural phenomenon, the force which was used to create the universe and which the gods employed to work their will. Humans could also use it, however, and magical practices were closely intertwined with religion. In fact, even the regular rituals performed in temples were counted as magic.{{Sfn | Pinch | 1995 | pp = 9\u201317}}  Individuals also frequently employed magical techniques for personal purposes.  Although these ends could be harmful to other people, no form of magic was considered inimical in itself.  Instead, magic was seen primarily as a way for humans to prevent or overcome negative events.<ref>Baines, in {{Harvnb | Shafer | 1991 | p = 165}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Wedjat (Udjat) Eye of Horus pendant.jpg|thumb|170px|Amulet in the shape of the [[Eye of Horus]], a common magical symbol]]\nMagic was closely associated with the priesthood. Because temple libraries contained numerous magical texts, great magical knowledge was ascribed to the lector priests who studied these texts. These priests often worked outside their temples, hiring out their magical services to laymen. Other professions also commonly employed magic as part of their work, including doctors, scorpion-charmers, and makers of magical amulets.  It is also likely that the peasantry used simple magic for their own purposes, but because this magical knowledge would have been passed down orally, there is limited evidence of it.{{Sfn | Pinch | 1995 | pp = 51\u201363}}\n\nLanguage was closely linked with heka, to such a degree that [[Thoth]], the god of writing, was sometimes said to be the inventor of heka.{{Sfn | Pinch | 1995 | pp = 16, 28}}  Therefore, magic frequently involved written or spoken incantations, although these were usually accompanied by ritual actions. Often these rituals invoked the power of an appropriate deity to perform the desired action, using the power of heka to compel it to act. Sometimes this entailed casting the practitioner or subject of a ritual in the role of a character in mythology, thus inducing the god to act toward that person as it had in the myth. Rituals also employed [[sympathetic magic]], using objects believed to have a magically significant resemblance to the subject of the rite. The Egyptians also commonly used objects believed to be imbued with heka of their own, such as the magically protective [[amulet]]s worn in great numbers by ordinary Egyptians.{{Sfn | Pinch | 1995 | pp = 73\u201378}}\n\n===Funerary practices===\n{{main |Ancient Egyptian funerary practices}}\nBecause it was considered necessary for the survival of the soul, preservation of the body was a central part of Egyptian funerary practices. Originally the Egyptians buried their dead in the desert, where the arid conditions [[mummified]] the body naturally. In the Early Dynastic Period, however, they began using tombs for greater protection, and the body was insulated from the [[desiccation|desiccating]] effect of the sand and was subject to natural decay. Thus the Egyptians developed their elaborate [[embalming]] practices, in which the corpse was artificially desiccated and wrapped to be placed in its coffin.{{Sfn | Quirke | Spencer | 1992 | pp = 86\u201390}}  The quality of the process varied according to cost, however, and those who could not afford it were still buried in desert graves.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 300\u20131}}\n\n[[File:Opening of the mouth ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Opening of the Mouth ceremony being performed before the tomb]]\nOnce the mummification process was complete, the mummy was carried from the deceased person's house to the tomb in a funeral procession that included his or her friends and relatives, along with a variety of priests. Before the burial, these priests performed several rituals, including the [[Opening of the mouth ceremony]] intended to restore the dead person's senses and give him or her the ability to receive offerings. Then the mummy was buried and the tomb sealed.{{Sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp = 187\u201393}}  Afterward, relatives or hired priests gave food offerings to the deceased in a nearby mortuary chapel at regular intervals.  Over time, families inevitably neglected offerings to long-dead relatives, so most mortuary cults only lasted one or two generations.{{Sfn | Taylor | 2001 | p = 95}}  However, while the cult lasted, the living sometimes wrote letters asking deceased relatives for help, in the belief that the dead could affect the world of the living as the gods did.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | p = 282}}\n\nThe first Egyptian tombs were [[mastaba]]s, rectangular brick structures where kings and nobles were entombed. Each of them contained a subterranean burial chamber and a separate, above ground chapel for mortuary rituals. In the Old Kingdom the mastaba developed into the [[pyramid]], which symbolized the primeval mound of Egyptian myth. Pyramids were reserved for royalty, and were accompanied by large mortuary temples sitting at their base. Middle Kingdom pharaohs continued to build pyramids, but the popularity of mastabas waned.  Increasingly, commoners with sufficient means were buried in rock-cut tombs with separate mortuary chapels nearby, an approach which was less vulnerable to tomb robbery.  By the beginning of the New Kingdom even the pharaohs were buried in such tombs, and they continued to be used until the decline of the religion itself.{{Sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp = 141\u201355}}\n\nTombs could contain a great variety of other items, including statues of the deceased to serve as substitutes for the body in case it was damaged.{{Sfn | Fleming | Lothian | 1997 | pp = 100\u20131}}  Because it was believed that the deceased would have to do work in the afterlife, just as in life, burials often included small models of humans to do work in place of the deceased.{{Sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp = 99\u2013103}}  The tombs of wealthier individuals could also contain furniture, clothing, and other everyday objects intended for use in the afterlife, along with amulets and other items intended to provide magical protection against the hazards of the spirit world.{{Sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp = 107\u201310, 200\u201313}}  Further protection was provided by funerary texts included in the burial. The tomb walls also bore artwork, including images of the deceased eating food which were believed to allow him or her to magically receive sustenance even after the mortuary offerings had ceased.{{Sfn | Quirke | Spencer | 1992 | pp = 97\u201398, 112}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Predynastic and Early Dynastic periods===\n[[File:Narmer-Tjet2.JPG|thumb|[[Narmer]], a Predynastic ruler, accompanied by men carrying the standards of various local gods]]\nThe beginnings of Egyptian religion extend into prehistory, though evidence for them comes only from the sparse and ambiguous archaeological record. Careful burials during the [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic period]] imply that the people of this time believed in some form of an afterlife. At the same time, animals were ritually buried, a practice which may reflect the development of [[zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] deities like those found in the later religion.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 12\u201315}}  The evidence is less clear for gods in human form, and this type of deity may have emerged more slowly than those in animal shape. Each region of Egypt originally had its own patron deity, but it is likely that as these small communities conquered or absorbed each other, the god of the defeated area was either incorporated into the other god's mythology or entirely subsumed by it. This resulted in a complex pantheon in which some deities remained only locally important while others developed more universal significance.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | p = 31}}{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 50\u201352}}\n\nThe [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] began with the unification of Egypt around 3000&nbsp;BC. This event transformed Egyptian religion, as some deities rose to national importance and the cult of the divine pharaoh became the central focus of religious activity.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | p = 15}}  Horus was identified with the king, and his cult center in the Upper Egyptian city of [[Nekhen]] was among the most important religious sites of the period. Another important center was [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], where the early rulers built large funerary complexes.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2000 | pp = 17\u201319}}\n\n===Old and Middle Kingdoms===\nDuring the Old Kingdom, the priesthoods of the major deities attempted to organize the complicated national pantheon into groups linked by their mythology and worshipped in a single cult center, such as the [[Ennead]] of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] which linked important deities such as [[Atum]], Ra, Osiris, and [[Set (mythology)|Set]] in a single creation myth.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 51, 81\u201385}}  Meanwhile, pyramids, accompanied by large mortuary temple complexes, replaced [[mastabas]] as the tombs of pharaohs. In contrast with the great size of the pyramid complexes, temples to gods remained comparatively small, suggesting that official religion in this period emphasized the cult of the divine king more than the direct worship of deities. The funerary rituals and architecture of this time greatly influenced the more elaborate temples and rituals used in worshipping the gods in later periods.{{Sfn | Dunand | Zivie-Coche | 2005 | pp = 78\u201379}}\n\n[[File:Pyramide Djedkare elevation.jpg|thumb|left|The pyramid complex of [[Djedkare Isesi]]]]\nEarly in the Old Kingdom, Ra grew in influence, and his cult center at Heliopolis became the nation's most important religious site.<ref>{{Harvnb | Malek | 2000 | pp = 92\u201393, 108\u20139}}.</ref>  By the Fifth Dynasty, Ra was the most prominent god in Egypt, and had developed the close links with kingship and the afterlife that he retained for the rest of Egyptian history.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 90\u201391, 112}}  Around the same time, [[Osiris]] became an important afterlife deity. ''The Pyramid Texts,'' first written at this time, reflect the prominence of the solar and Osirian concepts of the afterlife, although they also contain remnants of much older traditions.<ref>{{Harvnb | Malek | 2000 | p = 113}}.</ref> The texts are an extremely important source for understanding early Egyptian theology.{{sfn|David| 2002| p= 92}}\n\nIn the 22nd century BC, the Old Kingdom collapsed into the disorder of the First Intermediate Period. Eventually rulers from Thebes reunified the Egyptian nation in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2055\u20131650 BC). These Theban pharaohs initially promoted their patron god [[Montu]] to national importance, but during the Middle Kingdom, he was eclipsed by the rising popularity of [[Amun]].{{Sfn | David | 2002 | p = 154}}  In this new Egyptian state, personal piety grew more important and was expressed more freely in writing, a trend which continued in the New Kingdom.<ref name = \"Shaw 180\">Callender, Gae, \"The Middle Kingdom\", in {{Harvnb | Shaw | 2000 | pp = 180\u201381}}.</ref>\n\n===New Kingdom===\nThe Middle Kingdom crumbled in the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] (c. 1650\u20131550 BC), but the country was again reunited by Theban rulers, who became the first pharaohs of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]. Under the new regime, [[Amun]] became the supreme state god. He was syncretized with Ra, the long-established patron of kingship, and his [[Precinct of Amun-Ra|temple at Karnak]] in Thebes became Egypt's most important religious center.  Amun's elevation was partly due to the great importance of Thebes, but it was also due to the increasingly professional priesthood. Their sophisticated theological discussion produced detailed descriptions of Amun's universal power.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 181\u201384, 186}}{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | pp = 166, 191\u201392}}\n\nIncreased contact with outside peoples in this period led to the adoption of many Near Eastern deities into the pantheon. At the same time, the subjugated [[Nubia]]ns absorbed Egyptian religious beliefs, and in particular, adopted Amun as their own.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 276, 304}}\n\n[[File:La salle dAkhenaton (1356-1340 av J.C.) (Mus\u00e9e du Caire) (2076972086).jpg|right|thumb|Akhenaten and his family worshipping the Aten]]\nThe New Kingdom religious order was disrupted when [[Akhenaten]] acceded, and replaced Amun with the [[Aten]] as the state god. Eventually he eliminated the official worship of most other gods, and moved Egypt's capital to a new city at [[Amarna]]. This part of Egyptian history, the [[Amarna period]], is named after this.  In doing so, Akhenaten claimed unprecedented status: only he could worship the Aten, and the populace directed their worship toward him. The Atenist system lacked well-developed mythology and afterlife beliefs, and the Aten seemed distant and impersonal, so the new order did not appeal to ordinary Egyptians.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 215\u201318, 238}}  Thus, many probably continued to worship the traditional gods in private. Nevertheless, the withdrawal of state support for the other deities severely disrupted Egyptian society.{{Sfn | Van Dijk | 2000 | pp = 287, 311}}  Akhenaten's successors restored the traditional religious system, and eventually they dismantled all Atenist monuments.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 238\u201339}}\n\nBefore the Amarna period, popular religion had trended toward more personal relationships between worshippers and their gods. Akhenaten's changes had reversed this trend, but once the traditional religion was restored, there was a backlash. The populace began to believe that the gods were much more directly involved in daily life. Amun, the supreme god, was increasingly seen as the final arbiter of human destiny, the true ruler of Egypt. The pharaoh was correspondingly more human and less divine. The importance of oracles as a means of decision-making grew, as did the wealth and influence of the oracles' interpreters, the priesthood. These trends undermined the traditional structure of society and contributed to the breakdown of the New Kingdom.{{Sfn | Van Dijk | 2000 | pp = 289, 310\u201312}}<ref>{{Citation | last = Assmann | title = State and Religion in the New Kingdom}}, in {{Harvnb | Simpson | 1989 | pp = 72\u201379}}.</ref>\n\n===Later periods===\n{{further|Decline of ancient Egyptian religion}}\nIn the 1st millennium BC, Egypt was significantly weaker than in earlier times, and in several periods foreigners seized the country and assumed the position of pharaoh. The importance of the pharaoh continued to decline, and the emphasis on popular piety continued to increase. Animal cults, a characteristically Egyptian form of worship, became increasingly popular in this period, possibly as a response to the uncertainty and foreign influence of the time.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 312\u201317}}  Isis grew more popular as a goddess of protection, magic, and personal salvation, and became the most important goddess in Egypt.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 51, 146\u201349}}\n\n[[File:Serapis Pio-Clementino Inv689.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Serapis]]\nIn the 4th century BC, Egypt became a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] kingdom under the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] (305\u201330 BC), which assumed the pharaonic role, maintaining the traditional religion and building or rebuilding many temples. The kingdom's Greek ruling class identified the Egyptian deities with their own.{{Sfn | Peacock | 2000 | pp = 437\u201338}}  From this cross-cultural syncretism emerged [[Serapis]], a god who combined Osiris and Apis with characteristics of Greek deities, and who became very popular among the Greek population. Nevertheless, for the most part the two belief systems remained separate, and the Egyptian deities remained Egyptian.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 325\u201328}}\n\nPtolemaic-era beliefs changed little after Egypt became a [[Egypt (Roman province)|province]] of the [[Roman Empire]] in 30 BC, with the Ptolemaic kings replaced by distant emperors.{{Sfn | Peacock | 2000 | pp = 437\u201338}}  The cult of Isis appealed even to Greeks and Romans outside Egypt, and in Hellenized form it spread across the empire.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | p = 326}}  In Egypt itself, as the empire weakened, official temples fell into decay, and without their centralizing influence religious practice became fragmented and localized. Meanwhile, [[Christianity]] spread across Egypt, and in the third and fourth centuries AD, edicts by Christian emperors and [[iconoclasm]] by local Christians eroded traditional beliefs. While it persisted among the populace for some time, Egyptian religion slowly faded away.{{Sfn | Frankfurter | 1998 | pp = 23\u201330}}\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:Th oltar.JPG|thumb|200px|Altar to [[Thoth]] of a [[Kemetism|Kemetic]] follower.]]\nEgyptian religion produced the temples and tombs which are ancient Egypt's most enduring monuments, but it also influenced other cultures. In pharaonic times many of its symbols, such as the [[sphinx]] and [[winged sun|winged solar disk]], were adopted by other cultures across the Mediterranean and Near East, as were some of its deities, such as [[Bes]].  Some of these connections are difficult to trace.  The Greek concept of [[Elysium]] may have derived from the Egyptian vision of the afterlife.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | p = 392}}  In late antiquity, the Christian conception of [[Hell]] was most likely influenced by some of the imagery of the Duat. Egyptian beliefs also influenced or gave rise to several [[esotericism|esoteric]] belief systems developed by Greeks and Romans, who considered Egypt as a source of mystic wisdom. [[Hermeticism]], for instance, derived from the tradition of secret magical knowledge associated with [[Thoth]].{{Sfn | Hornung | 2001 | pp = 1, 9\u201311, 73\u201375}}\n\n====Modern times====\nTraces of ancient beliefs remained in Egyptian folk traditions into modern times, but its influence on modern societies greatly increased with the [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria]] in 1798 and their seeing the monuments and images. As a result of it, Westerners began to study Egyptian beliefs firsthand, and Egyptian religious motifs were adopted into Western art.{{Sfn | Hornung | 2001 | p = 75}}{{Sfn | Fleming | Lothian | 1997 | pp = 133\u201336}}  Egyptian religion has since had a significant [[Egyptian influence in popular culture|influence in popular culture]].

The study of learning processes, from both [[cognitive]] and [[behavioral]] perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in [[intelligence]], [[cognitive]] development, affect, [[motivation]], self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational settings across the lifespan.<ref name=Snowman>Snowman, Jack (1997). Educational Psychology: What Do We Teach, What Should We Teach?. \"Educational Psychology\", 9, 151-169</ref>\n\nEducational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by [psychology], bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between [[medicine]] and [[biology]]. It is also informed by [[neuroscience]]. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialities within educational studies, including [[instructional design]], [[educational technology]], curriculum development, [[organizational learning]], [[special education]], [[classroom management]], and student motivation. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to [[cognitive science]] and the [[learning sciences]]. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks.<ref name=lucas>Lucas, J.L.; Blazek, M.A. & Riley, A.B. (2005). The lack of representation of educational psychology and school psychology in introductory psychology textbooks. ''Educational Psychology'', 25, 347\u201351.</ref>\n\nThe field of educational psychology involves the study of [[memory]], conceptual processes, and individual differences (via cognitive psychology) in conceptualizing new strategies for learning processes in humans. Educational psychology has been built upon theories of [[operant conditioning]], [[Functional psychology|functionalism]], [[structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]], [[constructivism (psychological school)|constructivism]], [[humanistic psychology]], [[Gestalt psychology]], and [[information processing]].<ref name=\"Snowman\"/>\n\nEducational psychology has seen rapid growth and development as a profession in the last twenty years.<ref name=Farrell>Farrell, P. (2010). School psychology: Learning lessons from history and moving forward. School Psychology International, 31(6), 581-598.</ref> [[School psychology]] began with the concept of intelligence testing leading to provisions for special education students, who could not follow the regular classroom curriculum in the early part of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Farrell\"/> However, \"school psychology\" itself has built a fairly new profession based upon the practices and theories of several psychologists among many different fields. Educational psychologists are working side by side with psychiatrists, social workers, teachers, speech and language therapists, and counselors in attempt to understand the questions being raised when combining behavioral, cognitive, and social psychology in the classroom setting.<ref name=\"Farrell\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nEducational psychology is a fairly new and growing field of study. Though it can date back as early as the days of Plato and Aristotle, it was not identified as a specific practice. It was unknown that everyday teaching and learning in which individuals had to think about individual differences, assessment, development, the nature of a subject being taught, problem solving, and transfer of learning was the beginning to the field of educational psychology. These topics are important to education and as a result it is important to understanding human cognition, learning, and social perception.<ref name=\"Berliner\">{{cite journal|last=Berliner|first=David|title=The 100-Year Journey Of Educational Psychology|url=http://www.wou.edu/~girodm/611/Berliner_100years.pdf}}</ref>\n\n====Plato and Aristotle====\n\nEducational [[psychology]] dates back to the time of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] researched individual differences in the field of [[education]], training of the body and the cultivation of psycho-motor skills, the formation of good character, the possibilities and limits of moral [[education]]. Some other educational topics they spoke about were the effects of music, poetry, and the other arts on the development of individual, role of teacher, and the relations between teacher and student.<ref name=\"Berliner\"/>  Plato saw knowledge as an innate ability, which  evolves through experience and understanding of the world. Such a statement has evolved into a continuing argument of [[nature]] vs. nurture in understanding conditioning and learning today. [[Aristotle]] observed the phenomenon of \"association.\" His four laws of association included succession, contiguity, similarity, and contrast. His studies examined recall and facilitated learning processes.<ref name=Lott>[[Toomas Lott]] (2011). \"Plato on the Rationality of Belief, Trames\", 15, 339-364.</ref>\n\n====John Locke====\n\n[[John Locke]] was considered one of the most influential philosophers in post-renaissance Europe in about mid 1600s. Locke was called \"Father of English Psychology\". One of Locke's most important works was written in 1690, named ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. In this essay, he introduced the term \"tabula rasa\" meaning \"blank slate.\" Locke explained that learning was primarily understood through experience only, and we were all born without knowledge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.niu.edu/acad/psych/Millis/History/2003/locke.htm}}</ref>\n\nHe followed by contrasting Plato's theory of innate learning processes. Locke believed the mind was formed by experiences, not innate ideas. Locke introduced this idea as \"empiricism,\" or the understanding that knowledge is only built on knowledge and experience.\n\nIn the late 1600s, John Locke advanced the hypothesis that people learn primarily from external forces.  He believed that the mind was like a blank tablet (tabula rasa), and that successions of simple impressions give rise to complex ideas through association and reflection.  Locke is credited with establishing \"[[empiricism]]\" as a criterion for testing the validity of knowledge, thus providing a conceptual framework for later development of experimental methodology in the natural and social sciences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/history.html|title=The History of Educational Psychology|last=|first=|date=|website=cortland.edu|publisher=|access-date=May 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Before 1890===\nPhilosophers of education such as Juan Vives, Johann Pestalozzi, Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel, and Johann Herbart had examined, classified and judged the methods of education centuries before the beginnings of psychology in the late 1800s.\n\n====Juan Vives====\n\n[[Juan Vives]] (1493\u20131540) proposed induction as the method of study and believed in the direct [[observation]] and investigation of the study of [[nature]]. His studies focus of humanistic [[learning]], which opposed scholasticism and was influenced by a variety of sources including [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[politics]], [[religion]], and [[history]].<ref name=zimmerman2>[[Barry Zimmerman|Zimmerman, B.J.]] & [[Dale Schunk|Schunk, D.H.]] (Eds.) (2003). ''Educational psychology: A century of contributions''. Mahwah, NJ, US: Erlbaum.</ref> He was one of the first to emphasize that the location of the school is important to [[learning]].<ref name=vives>Vives, J, & Watson, F. (1913). On education : a translation of the de tradendis disciplinis of juan luis vives . Cambridge : The University Press.</ref> He suggested that the school should be located away from disturbing noises; the air quality should be good and there should be plenty of food for the students and teachers.<ref name=\"vives\"/> Vives emphasized the importance of understanding individual differences of the students and suggested practice as an important tool for learning.<ref name=\"vives\"/>\n\nVives introduced his educational ideas in his writing, \"De anima et vita\" in 1538. In this publication, Vives explores moral [[philosophy]] as a setting for his educational ideals; with this, he explains that the different parts of the soul (similar to that of Aristotle's ideas) are each responsible for different operations, which function distinctively. The first book covers the different \"souls\": \"The Vegatative Soul;\" this is the soul of [[nutrition]], growth, and reproduction, \"The Sensitive Soul,\" which involves the five external senses; \"The Cogitative soul,\" which includes internal senses and [[cognitive]] facilities. The second book involves functions of the rational soul: mind, will, and memory. Lastly, the third book explains the analysis of emotions.<ref name=Casini>[[Casini, Lorenzo]] (2010). \"Quid sit anima\": Juan Luis Vives on the soul and its relation to the body\". Renaissance Studies, 24, 496- 517</ref>\n\n====Johann Pestalozzi====\n\n[[Johann Pestalozzi]] (1746\u20131827), a Swiss educational reformer, emphasized the child rather than the content of the school.<ref name=glover>Glover, J, & Ronning, R. (Ed.). (1987).</ref> Pestalozzi fostered an educational reform backed by the idea that early education was crucial for children, and could be manageable for mothers. Eventually, this experience with early education would lead to a \"wholesome person characterized by morality.\"<ref name=Horlacher>Horlacher, Rebekka (2011). Schooling as a means of popular education: Pestalozzi's method as a popular education experiment. \"Paedagogica Historica\": 47, 65-75</ref> Pestalozzi has been acknowledged for opening institutions for education, writing books for mother's teaching home education, and elementary books for students, mostly focusing on the kindergarten level. In his later years, he published teaching manuals and methods of teaching.<ref name=Horlacher/>\n\nDuring the time of [[The Enlightenment]], Pestalozzi's ideals introduced \"educationalisation.\" This created the bridge between social issues and education by introducing the idea of social issues to be solved through education. Horlacher describes the most prominent example of this during The Enlightenment to be \"improving agricultural production methods.\"<ref name=Horlacher/>\n\n====Johann Herbart====\n\nJohann Herbart (1776\u20131841) is considered the father of educational [[psychology]].<ref name=hergenhahn>Hergenhahn, B.R. (2009). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.</ref>  He believed that [[learning]] was influenced by interest in the subject and the teacher.<ref name=\"hergenhahn\"/> He thought that teachers should consider the students' existing mental sets\u2014what they already know\u2014when presenting new information or material.<ref name=\"hergenhahn\"/> Herbart came up with what are now known as the formal steps. The 5 steps that teachers should use are:\n\n# Review material that has already been learned by the student<ref name=\"hergenhahn\"/>\n# Prepare the student for new material by giving them an overview of what they are learning next<ref name=\"hergenhahn\"/>\n# Present the new material.<ref name=\"hergenhahn\"/>\n# Relate the new material to the old material that has already been learned.<ref name=\"hergenhahn\"/>\n# Show how the student can apply the new material and show the material they will learn next.<ref name=\"hergenhahn\"/>\n\n===1890\u20131920===\nThere were three major figures in educational psychology in this period: William James, G. Stanley Hall, and John Dewey. These three men distinguished themselves in general psychology and educational psychology, which overlapped significantly at the end of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Berliner|first=David|title=The 100- Year Journey of Educational Psychology|url=http://www.wou.edu/~girodm/611/Berliner_100years.pdf}}</ref> \n\n====William James (1842\u20131910)====\n\n[[File:William James, philosopher.jpg|thumb|upright|William James]]\nThe period of 1890\u20131920 is considered the golden era of educational psychology where aspirations of the new discipline rested on the application of the scientific methods of observation and experimentation to educational problems. From 1840 to 1920 37 million people immigrated to the United States.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> This created an expansion of elementary schools and secondary schools. The increase in immigration also provided educational psychologists the opportunity to use intelligence testing to screen immigrants at Ellis Island.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> [[Darwinism]] influenced the beliefs of the prominent educational psychologists.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> Even in the earliest years of the discipline, educational psychologists recognized the limitations of this new approach. The pioneering American psychologist [[William James]] commented that: \n{{quote|Psychology is a science, and teaching is an art; and sciences never generate arts directly out of themselves. An intermediate inventive mind must make that application, by using its originality\".<ref name=james>[[William James|James, W.]] (1983). ''Talks to teachers on psychology and to students on some of life's ideals''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. (Original work published 1899)</ref>}}\nJames is the father of psychology in America but he also made contributions to educational psychology.  In his famous series of lectures ''Talks to Teachers on Psychology'', published in 1899, James defines education as \"the organization of acquired habits of conduct and tendencies to behavior\".<ref name=\"james\"/>  He states that teachers should \"train the pupil to behavior\"<ref name=\"james\"/> so that he fits into the social and physical world. Teachers should also realize the importance of habit and instinct. They should present information that is clear and interesting and relate this new information and material to things the student already knows about.<ref name=\"james\"/> He also addresses important issues such as attention, memory, and association of ideas.\n\n====Alfred Binet====\n\n[[Alfred Binet]] published ''Mental Fatigue'' in 1898, in which he attempted to apply the experimental method to educational psychology.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/>  In this experimental method he advocated for two types of experiments, experiments done in the lab and experiments done in the classroom.  In 1904 he was appointed the Minister of Public Education.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> This is when he began to look for a way to distinguish children with developmental disabilities.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> Binet strongly supported special education programs because he believed that \"abnormality\" could be cured.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/>  The Binet-Simon test was the first intelligence test and was the first to distinguish between  \"normal children\" and those with developmental disabilities.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/>  Binet believed that it was important to study individual differences between age groups and children of the same age.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> He also believed that it was important for teachers to take into account individual students strengths and also the needs of the classroom as a whole when teaching and creating a good learning environment.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> He also believed that it was important to train teachers in observation so that they would be able to see individual differences among children and adjust the curriculum to the students.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> Binet also emphasized that practice of material was important.  In 1916 [[Lewis Terman]] revised the Binet-Simon so that the average score was always 100.<ref name=\"hergenhahn\"/> The test became known as the Stanford-Binet and was one of the most widely used tests of intelligence.  Terman, unlike Binet, was interested in using intelligence test to identify gifted children who had high intelligence.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> In his longitudinal study of gifted children, who became known as the Termites, Terman found that gifted children become gifted adults.<ref name=\"hergenhahn\"/>\n\n====Edward Thorndike====\n\n[[Edward Thorndike]] (1874\u20131949) supported the scientific movement in education. He based teaching practices on empirical evidence and measurement.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> Thorndike developed the theory of [[instrumental conditioning]] or the law of effect.   The law of effect states that associations are strengthened when it is followed by something pleasing and associations are weakened when followed by something not pleasing. He also found that [[learning]] is done a little at a time or in increments, [[learning]] is an automatic process and all the principles of [[learning]] apply to all mammals. Thorndike's research with [[Robert Woodworth]] on the theory of transfer found that learning one subject will only influence your ability to [[learn]] another subject if the subjects are similar.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> This discovery led to less emphasis on learning the [[classics]] because they found that studying the classics does not contribute to overall general intelligence.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> Thorndike was one of the first to say that individual differences in [[cognitive]] tasks were due to how many stimulus response patterns a person had rather than a general intellectual ability.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/>  He contributed word dictionaries that were [[scientifically]] based to determine the words and definitions used.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> The dictionaries were the first to take into consideration the users maturity level.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/>  He also integrated pictures and easier pronunciation guide into each of the definitions.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> Thorndike contributed [[arithmetic]] books based on [[learning theory (education)|learning theory]]. He made all the problems more realistic and relevant to what was being studied, not just to improve the general [[intelligence]].<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> He developed tests that were standardized to measure performance in school related subjects.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> His biggest contribution to testing was the CAVD intelligence test which used a multidimensional approach to intelligence and the first to use a ratio scale.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> His later work was on programmed instruction, mastery learning and computer-based learning:\n{{quote|If, by a miracle of mechanical ingenuity, a book could be so arranged that only to him who had done what was directed on page one would page two become visible, and so on, much that now requires personal instruction could be managed by print.<ref name=thorndike>[[Edward Thorndike|Thorndike, E.L.]] (1912). ''Education: A first book''. New York: MacMillan.</ref>}}\n\n====John Dewey====\n\n[[John Dewey]] (1859\u20131952) had a major influence on the development of [[progressive education]] in the United States. He believed that the classroom should prepare children to be good citizens and facilitate creative intelligence.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> He pushed for the creation of practical classes that could be applied outside of a school setting.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> He also thought that education should be student-oriented, not subject-oriented. For Dewey, education was a social experience that helped bring together generations of people. He stated that students learn by doing. He believed in an active mind that was able to be educated through observation, problem solving and enquiry. In his 1910 book ''How We Think'', he emphasizes that material should be provided in a way that is stimulating and interesting to the student since it encourages original thought and problem solving.<ref name=Dewey>Dewey J. (1910). How we think. New York  D.C. Heath & Co.</ref>  He also stated that material should be relative to the student's own experience.<ref name=\"Dewey\"/>\n{{quote|\"The material furnished by way of information should be relevant to a question that is vital in the students own experience\"<ref name=\"Dewey\"/>}}\n\n====Jean Piaget====\n\n[[Jean Piaget]] (1896\u20131980) was one of the most powerful researchers in the area of developmental psychology during the 20th century. He developed the theory of [[cognitive]] development.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> The [[theory]] stated that intelligence developed in four different stages. The stages are the sensorimotor stage from birth to 2 years old, the preoperational state from 2 years old to 7 years old, the concrete operational stage from 7 years old to 10 years old, and formal operational stage from 11 years old and up.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> He also believed that learning was constrained to the child's cognitive development. Piaget influenced educational psychology because he was the first to believe that cognitive development was important and something that should be paid attention to in education.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/>  Most of the research on Piagetian theory was carried out by American educational psychologists.\n\n===1920\u2013present===\nThe number of people receiving a high school and college education increased dramatically from 1920 to 1960.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> Because very few jobs were available to teens coming out of eighth grade, there was an increase in high school attendance in the 1930s.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> The progressive movement in the United State took off at this time and led to the idea of [[progressive education]]. John Flanagan, an educational psychologist, developed tests for combat trainees and instructions in combat training.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/>  In 1954 the work of Kenneth Clark and his wife on the effects of segregation on black and white children was influential in the Supreme Court case [[Brown v. Board of Education]].<ref name=\"hergenhahn\"/> From the 1960s to present day, educational psychology has switched from a behaviorist perspective to a more cognitive based perspective because of the influence and development of [[cognitive psychology]] at this time.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/>\n\n====Jerome Bruner====\n\n[[Jerome Bruner]] is notable for integrating [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s [[cognitive]] approaches into educational [[psychology]].<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> He advocated for [[discovery learning]] where teachers create a [[problem solving]] environment that allows the student to question, [[explore]] and experiment.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> In his book ''The Process of Education'' Bruner stated that the structure of the material and the [[cognitive]] abilities of the person are important in [[learning]].<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> He emphasized the importance of the subject matter. He also believed that how the subject was structured was important for the student's understanding of the subject and it is the goal of the teacher to structure the subject in a way that was easy for the student to understand.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/>  In the early 1960s Bruner went to [[Africa]] to teach math and science to school children, which influenced his view as schooling as a [[cultural]] institution.  Bruner was also influential in the development of MACOS, Man a Course of Study, which was an educational program that combined [[anthropology]] and [[science]].<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> The program explored human evolution and social behavior.  He also helped with the development of the head start program. He was interested in the influence of culture on education and looked at the impact of poverty on educational development.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/>\n\n====Benjamin Bloom====\n\n[[Benjamin Bloom]] (1903\u20131999) spent over 50 years at the [[University of Chicago]], where he worked in the department of education.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> He believed that all students can learn. He developed [[taxonomy of educational objectives]].<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> The objectives were divided into three domains: cognitive, affective, and psychomotor. The cognitive domain deals with how we think.<ref name=clark>Clark, D. (n.d.). Bloom's taxonomy of learning domains. Retrieved from http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/bloom.html</ref> It is divided into categories that are on a continuum from easiest to more complex.<ref name=\"clark\"/> The categories are knowledge or recall, comprehension application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation.<ref name=\"clark\"/>  The affective domain deals with emotions and has 5 categories.<ref name=\"clark\"/> The categories are receiving phenomenon, responding to that phenomenon, valuing, organization, and internalizing values.<ref name=\"clark\"/> The psychomotor domain deals with the development of motor skills, movement and coordination and has 7 categories, that also goes from simplest to complex.<ref name=\"clark\"/> The 7 categories of the psychomotor domain are perception, set, guided response, mechanism, complex overt response, adaptation, and origination.<ref name=\"clark\"/> The taxonomy provided broad educational objectives that could be used to help expand the curriculum to match the ideas in the taxonomy.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/>  The taxonomy is considered to have a greater influence internationally than in the United States. Internationally, the taxonomy is used in every aspect of education from training of the teachers to the development of testing material.<ref name=\"zimmerman2\"/> Bloom believed in communicating clear learning goals and promoting an active student.

It resides as an important research topic in educational psychology. A student is thought to interpret a problem by assigning it to a [[schema (psychology)|schema]] retrieved from long-term memory. A problem students run into while reading is called \"activation.\" This is when the student's representations of the text are present during working memory. This causes the student to read through the material without absorbing the information and being able to retain it. When working memory is absent from the reader's representations of the working memory they experience something called \"deactivation.\" When deactivation occurs, the student has an understanding of the material and is able to retain information. If deactivation occurs during the first reading, the reader does not need to undergo deactivation in the second reading. The reader will only need to reread to get a \"gist\" of the text to spark their [[memory]]. When the problem is assigned to the wrong schema, the student's attention is subsequently directed away from features of the problem that are inconsistent with the assigned schema.<ref name=kalyuga>Kalyuga, S.; Chandler, P.; Tuovinen, J. & [[John Sweller|Sweller, J.]] (2001). When problem solving is superior to studying worked examples. ''Journal of Educational Psychology'', 93, 579\u201388.</ref> The critical step of finding a mapping between the problem and a pre-existing schema is often cited as supporting the centrality of [[analogical]] thinking to problem solving.\n\n====Cognitive view of intelligence====\n[[File:Figural Relationships.svg|right|thumb|An example of an item from a cognitive abilities test]]\nEach person has an individual profile of characteristics, abilities and challenges that result from predisposition, learning and development. These manifest as individual differences in [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], [[creativity]], [[cognitive style]], [[motivation]] and the capacity to process information, communicate, and relate to others. The most prevalent disabilities found among school age children are [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[learning disability]], [[dyslexia]], and [[speech disorder]]. Less common disabilities include [[intellectual disability]], [[hearing impairment]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[epilepsy]], and [[blindness]].<ref name=woolfolk/>\n\nAlthough theories of [[intelligence]] have been discussed by philosophers since [[Plato]], intelligence testing is an invention of educational psychology, and is coincident with the development of that discipline. Continuing debates about the nature of intelligence revolve on whether [[intelligence]] can be characterized by a single [[factor analysis|factor]] known as [[general intelligence factor|general intelligence]],<ref name=spearman1904>Spearman, C. (1904) \"General intelligence\" objectively determined and measured. ''American Journal of Psychology'', 15, 201\u201393.</ref> multiple factors (e.g., [[Howard Gardner|Gardner's]] [[theory of multiple intelligences]]<ref>Gardner, Howard. (1983) ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences''. New York: Basic Books.</ref>), or whether it can be measured at all. In practice, standardized instruments such as the [[Stanford-Binet IQ test]] and the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]]<ref>Wechsler, D. (1949). ''The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.'' New York: Psychological Corp.</ref> are widely used in economically developed countries to identify children in need of individualized educational treatment. Children classified as [[gifted]] are often provided with accelerated or enriched programs. Children with identified deficits may be provided with enhanced education in specific skills such as [[phonological awareness]]. In addition to basic abilities, the individual's personality [[trait theory|traits]] are also important, with people higher in [[conscientiousness]] and [[hope]] attaining superior academic achievements, even after controlling for intelligence and past performance.<ref>Day, L.; Hanson, K.; Maltby, J.; Proctor, C.L. & Wood, A.M.

This is so because education and the psychology of cognitive development converge on a number of crucial assumptions. First, the psychology of cognitive development defines human cognitive competence at successive phases of development. Education aims to help students acquire knowledge and develop skills which are compatible with their understanding and problem-solving capabilities at different ages. Thus, knowing the students' level on a developmental sequence provides information on the kind and level of knowledge they can assimilate, which, in turn, can be used as a frame for organizing the subject matter to be taught at different school grades. This is the reason why [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]] was so influential for education, especially mathematics and science education.<ref>Furth, H.G. & Wachs, H. (1975). ''Thinking goes to school: Piaget's theory in practice''. Oxford: Oxford University Press</ref> In the same direction, the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] suggest that in addition to the concerns above, sequencing of concepts and skills in teaching must take account of the processing and [[working memory]] capacities that characterize successive age levels.<ref>Demetriou, A. & Valanides, N. (1998). A three level of theory of the developing mind: Basic principles and implications for instruction and assessment. In R.J. Sternberg & W.M. Williams (Eds.), ''Intelligence, instruction, and assessment'' (pp. 149\u201399). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.</ref><ref name=\"Demetriou, A. 2010\">Demetriou, A.; Spanoudis, G. & Mouyi, A.

Vuletic (Eds.), ''The Developmental Relations between Mind, Brain, and Education: Essays in honor of Robbie Case''. New York: Springer.</ref>\n   \nSecond, the psychology of [[cognitive development]] involves understanding how [[cognitive]] change takes place and recognizing the factors and processes which enable cognitive competence to develop. [[Education]] also capitalizes on [[cognitive]] change, because the construction of knowledge presupposes effective teaching methods that would move the student from a lower to a higher level of understanding. Mechanisms such as reflection on actual or [[Mind|mental]] actions vis-\u00e0-vis alternative solutions to problems, tagging new concepts or solutions to symbols that help one recall and mentally manipulate them are just a few examples of how mechanisms of cognitive development may be used to facilitate learning.<ref name=\"Demetriou, A. 2010\"/><ref>Case, R. (1985). ''Intellectual development: Birth to adulthood.'' New York: Academic Press.</ref>\n\nFinally, the psychology of cognitive development is concerned with individual differences in the organization of cognitive processes and abilities, in their rate of change, and in their mechanisms of change. The principles underlying intra- and inter-individual differences could be educationally useful, because knowing how students differ in regard to the various dimensions of cognitive development, such as processing and representational capacity, self-understanding and self-regulation, and the various domains of understanding, such as mathematical, scientific, or verbal abilities, would enable the teacher to cater for the needs of the different students so that no one is left behind.<ref name=\"Demetriou, A. 2010\"/><ref>Case, R.

London: Routledge.</ref>\n\n===Constructivist===\n{{Main|Constructivism (learning theory)|l1=Constructivism}}\nConstructivism is a category of learning theory in which emphasis is placed on the agency and prior \"knowing\" and experience of the learner, and often on the social and cultural determinants of the learning process. Educational psychologists distinguish individual (or psychological) constructivism, identified with [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]], from [[social constructivism (learning theory)|social constructivism]]. A dominant influence on the latter type is [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s work on sociocultural learning, describing how interactions with adults, more capable peers, and cognitive tools are internalized to form mental constructs. Elaborating on Vygotsky's theory, [[Jerome Bruner]] and other educational psychologists developed the important concept of [[instructional scaffolding]], in which the social or information environment offers supports for learning that are gradually withdrawn as they become internalized.<ref name=\"educational psychology\">Seifert, Kelvin & Sutton, Rosemary.

Piaget hypothesized that infants are born with a schema operating at birth that he called \"reflexes\". Piaget  identified four stages in cognitive development. The four stages are sensorimotor stage, pre-operational stage, concrete operational stage and formal operational stage.<ref name=Huitt>{{cite journal|last1=Huitt|first1=W|last2=Hummel |first2=J|title=Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development|journal=Educational Psychology Interactive|year=2003|url=http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/cognition/piaget.html}}</ref>\n\n==Conditioning and learning==\n\n[[Image:Kugleramme.jpg|thumb|left|An [[abacus]] provides concrete experiences for learning abstract concepts.]]\nTo understand the characteristics of learners in [[child]]hood, [[adolescence]], [[adulthood]], and [[old age]], educational psychology develops and applies theories of human [[developmental psychology|development]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/action/science/teaching-learning/index.aspx|title=Educational Psychology Promotes Teaching and Learning|website=apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-29}}</ref> Often represented as stages through which people pass as they mature, developmental theories describe changes in mental abilities ([[cognition]]), social roles, moral reasoning, and beliefs about the nature of knowledge.\n\nFor example, educational psychologists have conducted research on the instructional applicability of [[cognitive development|Jean Piaget's theory of development]], according to which children mature through four stages of cognitive capability. Piaget hypothesized that children are not capable of abstract logical thought until they are older than about 11 years, and therefore younger children need to be taught using concrete objects and examples. Researchers have found that transitions, such as from concrete to abstract logical thought, do not occur at the same time in all domains. A child may be able to think abstractly about mathematics, but remain limited to concrete thought when reasoning about human relationships. Perhaps Piaget's most enduring contribution is his insight that people actively construct their understanding through a self-regulatory process.<ref name=woolfolk>Woolfolk, A.E.; Winne, P.H. & Perry, N.E. (2006). ''Educational Psychology'' (3rd Canadian ed.). Toronto, Canada: Pearson.</ref>\n\nPiaget proposed a developmental theory of [[moral reasoning]] in which children progress from a na\u00efve understanding of [[morality]] based on behavior and outcomes to a more advanced understanding based on intentions. Piaget's views of moral development were elaborated by [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] into a [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stage theory of moral development]]. There is evidence that the moral reasoning described in stage theories is not sufficient to account for moral behavior. For example, other factors such as [[modeling (psychology)|modeling]] (as described by the [[social cognitive theory of morality]]) are required to explain [[bullying]].\n\n[[Rudolf Steiner]]'s model of [[child development]] interrelates physical, emotional, cognitive, and moral development<ref name=\"uwe.ac.uk RR645 1.5 Findings\">Woods, Ashley and Woods, [http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR645.pdf ''Steiner Schools in England'', University of West of England, Bristol: Research Report RR645], section 1.5, \"Findings from the survey and case studies\"</ref> in developmental stages similar to those later described by [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]].<ref>Carrie Y. Nordlund, \"Art Experiences in Waldorf Education,\" Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Missouri-Columbia, May 2006</ref>\n\nDevelopmental theories are sometimes presented not as shifts between qualitatively different stages, but as gradual increments on separate dimensions. Development of [[epistemological]] beliefs (beliefs about knowledge) have been described in terms of gradual changes in people's belief in: certainty and permanence of knowledge, fixedness of ability, and credibility of authorities such as teachers and experts. People develop more sophisticated beliefs about knowledge as they gain in education and maturity.<ref name=cano>Cano, F. (2005). Epistemological beliefs and approaches to learning: Their change through secondary school and their influence on academic performance. ''British Journal of Educational Psychology'', 75, 203\u201321.</ref>\n\n===Motivation===\n[[Motivation]] is an internal state that activates, guides and sustains behavior. Motivation can have several impacting effects on how students learn and how they behave towards subject matter:<ref>{{cite web|last=Omrod|first=Jeanne|title=Educational Theme: Motivation in the Classroom|url=http://www.greeneeducationfoundation.org/documents/GEF_2012-2013_Educational_Theme.pdf|publisher=Green Education Foundation}}</ref> \n* Provide direction towards goals\n* Enhance cognitive processing abilities and performance\n* Direct behavior toward particular goals\n* Lead to increased effort and energy\n* Increase initiation of and persistence in activities\n\nEducational psychology research on motivation is concerned with the [[volition (psychology)|volition]] or [[will (philosophy)|will]] that students bring to a task, their level of interest and [[intrinsic motivation]], the personally held [[goal setting|goals]] that guide their behavior, and their belief about the causes of their success or failure. As intrinsic motivation deals with activities that act as their own rewards, extrinsic motivation deals with motivations that are brought on by consequences or punishments. A form of [[attribution theory]] developed by [[Bernard Weiner]]<ref name=weiner>[[Bernard Weiner|Weiner, B.]] (2000). Interpersonal and intrapersonal theories of motivation from an attributional perspective. ''Educational Psychology Review'', 12, 1\u201314.</ref> describes how students' beliefs about the causes of academic success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. For example, when students attribute failure to lack of ability, and ability is perceived as uncontrollable, they experience the emotions of [[shame]] and [[embarrassment]] and consequently decrease effort and show poorer performance. In contrast, when students attribute failure to lack of effort, and effort is perceived as controllable, they experience the emotion of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and consequently increase effort and show improved performance.<ref name=\"weiner\"/>\n\nThe [[self-determination theory]] (SDT) was developed by psychologists [[Edward L. Deci|Edward Deci]] and Richard Ryan. SDT focuses on the importance of [[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic and extrinsic motivation]] in driving human behavior and posits inherent growth and development tendencies. It emphasizes the degree to which an individual's behavior is self-motivated and self-determined. When applied to the realm of education, the self-determination theory is concerned primarily with promoting in students an interest in learning, a value of education, and a confidence in their own capacities and attributes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Deci|first=Edward L.|title=Motivation and Education: The Self-Determination Perspective|journal=Educational Psychologist|year=1991|volume=26|issue=3 & 4|pages=325\u2013346|doi=10.1207/s15326985ep2603&4_6}}</ref>\n\nMotivational theories also explain how [[goal theory|learners' goals]] affect the way they engage with academic tasks.<ref name=elliot>Elliot, A.J. (1999). Approach and avoidance motivation and achievement goals. ''Educational Psychologist'', 34, 169\u201389.</ref> Those who have ''mastery goals'' strive to increase their ability and knowledge. Those who have ''performance approach goals'' strive for high grades and seek opportunities to demonstrate their abilities. Those who have ''performance avoidance'' goals are driven by fear of failure and avoid situations where their abilities are exposed. Research has found that mastery goals are associated with many positive outcomes such as persistence in the face of failure, preference for challenging tasks, [[creativity]] and [[intrinsic motivation]]. Performance avoidance goals are associated with negative outcomes such as poor [[attention|concentration]] while studying, disorganized studying, less self-regulation, shallow information processing and [[Anxiety (mood)#Test and performance|test anxiety]]. Performance approach goals are associated with positive outcomes, and some negative outcomes such as an unwillingness to seek help and shallow information processing.<ref name=\"elliot\"/>\n\n[[Locus of control]] is a salient factor in the successful academic performance of students. During the 1970s and '80s, [[Cassandra B. Whyte]] did significant educational research studying locus of control as related to the academic achievement of students pursuing higher education coursework. Much of her educational research and publications focused upon the theories of [[Julian B. Rotter]] in regard to the importance of internal control and successful academic performance.<ref name=\"Whyte80\">Whyte, C. (1980). An Integrated Counseling and Learning Assistance Center. New Directions Sourcebook. Jossey-Bass, Inc. San Francisco.</ref> Whyte reported that individuals who perceive and believe that their hard work may lead to more successful academic outcomes, instead of depending on luck or fate, persist and achieve academically at a higher level. Therefore, it is important to provide education and counseling in this regard.<ref>Whyte, C. (1978). Effective Counseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen.

New York, USA: Addison-Wesley Longman.</ref>]]\n[[Instructional design]], the systematic design of materials, activities and interactive environments for learning, is broadly informed by educational psychology theories and research. For example, in defining learning goals or objectives, instructional designers often use a [[taxonomy of educational objectives]] created by [[Benjamin Bloom]] and colleagues.<ref name=Anderson/> Bloom also researched [[mastery learning]], an instructional strategy in which learners only advance to a new learning objective after they have mastered its prerequisite objectives.

''Educational Researcher'', 13 (6), 4\u201316.</ref> discovered that a combination of mastery learning with one-to-one tutoring is highly effective, producing learning outcomes far exceeding those normally achieved in classroom instruction. [[Robert M. Gagn\u00e9|Gagn\u00e9]], another psychologist, had earlier developed an influential method of [[task analysis]] in which a terminal learning goal is expanded into a hierarchy of learning objectives<ref name=gronlund>Gronlund, N.E.

Educational Psychologists whom reside in the K- 12 setting focus the majority of their time with Special Education students. It has been found that students with disabilities learning through technology such as IPad applications and videos are more engaged and motivated to learn in the classroom setting. Liu et al. explain that learning-based technology allows for students to be more focused, and learning is more efficient with learning technologies. The authors explain that learning technology also allows for students with social- emotional disabilities to participate in distance learning.<ref name=Liu>Liu, Gi Zen; Wu, No- Wei; Chen, Ye- Wen.

They then must go to graduate school to study education psychology, counseling psychology, and/ or school counseling. Most students today are also receiving their doctorate degrees in order to hold the \"psychologist\" title. Educational psychologists work in a variety of settings. Some work in university settings where they carry out research on the cognitive and social processes of human development, learning and education. Educational psychologists may also work as consultants in designing and creating educational materials, classroom programs and online courses.Educational psychologists who work in k\u201312 school settings (closely related are [[school psychologist]]s in the US and Canada) are trained at the [[master's degree|master's]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] levels. In addition to conducting assessments, school psychologists provide services such as academic and behavioral intervention, counseling, teacher consultation, and crisis intervention. However, school psychologists are generally more individual-oriented towards students.<ref name= Love>Love, P. (2009). Educational psychologists: the early search for an identity.

The study of [[education]] generally combines the studies of [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[ethics]] with theoretical approaches. Smeyers and Depaepe explain that historically, the study of education and child rearing have been associated with the interests of policymakers and practitioners within the educational field, however, the recent shift to [[sociology]] and [[psychology]] has opened the door for new findings in education as a [[social science]]. Now being its own academic discipline, educational psychology has proven to be helpful for social science researchers.<ref name=Smeyers>Smeyers, Paul; Depaepe, Marc.

This involves observing, creating, and understanding a distribution of data based upon the studies subject matter. Researchers use particular variables to interpret their data distributions from their research and employ statistics as a way of creating data tables and analyzing their data. [[Psychology]] has moved from the \"common sense\" reputations initially posed by Thomas Reid to the methodology approach comparing independent and dependent variables through natural [[observation]], [[experiment]]s, or combinations of the two.

EFTPOS technology originated in the [[United States]] in 1981 and was adopted by other countries.  In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], it is also the brand name of a specific system used for such payments; these systems are mainly country specific and do not interconnect.\n\nDebit and credit cards are [[paper embossing|embossed]] plastic cards complying with [[ISO/IEC 7810]] ID-1 standard. The cards have an embossed [[bank card number]] conforming with the [[ISO/IEC 7812]] numbering standard.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|Debit card#United States}}\n\nEFTPOS technology originated in the United States in 1981 and was rolled out in 1982. Initially, a number of nationwide systems were set up, such as ''Interlink'', which were limited to participating correspondent banking relationships, not being linked to each other. Consumers and merchants were slow to accept it, and there was minimal marketing. As a result, growth and market penetration of EFTPOS was minimal in the US up to the turn of the century.\n\nIn a short time, other countries adopted the EFTPOS technology, but these systems too were limited to the national borders. Each country adopted various interbank co-operative models. In Australia, in 1984 Westpac was the first major Australian bank to implement an EFTPOS system, at BP petrol stations. The other major banks implemented EFTPOS systems during 1984, initially with petrol stations. The banks' existing debit and credit cards (but only allowed to access debit accounts) were used in the EFTPOS systems. In 1985, the State Bank of Victoria developed the capacity to host connect individual ATMS and helped create the ATM (Financial) Network.  Banks started to link their EFTPOS systems to provide access for all customers across all EFTPOS devices. Cards issued by all banks could then be used at all EFTPOS terminals nationally, but debit cards issued in other countries could not. Prior to 1986, the Australian banks organized a widespread uniform credit card, called [[Bankcard]], which had been in existence since 1974. There was a dispute between the banks whether Bankcard (or credit cards in general) should be permitted into the proposed EFTPOS system. At that time several banks were actively promoting MasterCard and Visa credit cards. Store cards and proprietary cards were shut out of the new system.\n\nIn New Zealand, [[Bank of New Zealand]] started issuing EFTPOS debit cards in 1985 with the first merchant terminals being installed in [[Filling station|petrol stations]].\n\n=== First Mobile EFTPOS ===\n\nIn 1996, mobile EFTPOS arrived, with  hotels in Kuala Lumpur installing systems in 1997<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Citibank's 'mobile' service for customers|last=|first=|date=1997-09-04|work=The Star|access-date=}}</ref> and the first example of a pizza delivery in Singapore accepting Visa card via cellular payment in 1998 <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Home-delivered pizza now paid by credit card|last=|first=|date=June 1998|work=Singtel Staff Magazine|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Now, you can also charge your pizza|last=|first=|date=1998-04-29|work=The Straits Times|access-date=}}</ref>(a collaboration between Signet, Visa, Citi Bank, and Dynamic Data Systems) beginning the rollout of mobile systems in Asia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Visa plays the mobility card|last=Cornell|first=Andrew|date=1998-04-28|work=The Australian Financial Review|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=DDS sights Asian Eftpos market|last=Cornell|first=Andrew|date=1998-04-24|work=The Australian Financial Review|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Mobile drive in Asia-Pacific|last=|first=|date=June 1998|work=Electronic Payments International|access-date=}}</ref> By 2004 Cellular based Eftpos infrastructure had really taken off, and by 2010 Cellular Eftpos had become the standard for the Global market.\n\nSince 2002 the use of EFTPOS has grown significantly, and it has become the standard payment method, displacing the use of cash. Subsequently, networks facilitating the process of money transfer and payment settlement between the consumer and the merchant grew from a small number of nationwide systems to the majority of payment processing transactions. For EFTPOS, USA based systems allow the use of debit cards or credit cards.\n\n== Australia ==\n[[File:Eftpos australia new logo.png|thumb|Australian eftpos logo]]\n{{main|Debit card#Australia}}\n\nIn Australia, debit and credit cards are the most common non-cash payment methods at \u201cpoints of sale\u201d (POS) or via [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]].<ref name=cecs>APCA: [http://apca.com.au/payment-systems/cards-accepting-devices Cards and Accepting Devices]</ref><ref>[http://www.boq.com.au/business_merchant_eftpos.htm EFTPOS.

The EFTPOS system in Australia is managed by Eftpos Payments Australia Ltd,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/corporate/about|title=eftpos - the way Australia pays|publisher=eftpos Payments Australia Ltd|accessdate=2013-01-30}}</ref> which also sets the EFTPOS [[interchange fee]].<ref name=ifee>[http://www.rba.gov.au/payments-system/reforms/debit-card-systems/submissions-pro-interchg-stds/epal-23102009-1.pdf Proposed changes to the interchange fees standard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428094413/http://www.rba.gov.au/payments-system/reforms/debit-card-systems/submissions-pro-interchg-stds/epal-23102009-1.pdf |date=2012-04-28 }}</ref> For credit cards to be accepted by a merchant a separate agreement must be entered into with each credit card company, each of which has its own flexible merchant fee rate.\n\nThe clearing arrangements for EFTPOS are managed by [[Australian Payments Clearing Association]] (APCA). The system for ATM and EFTPOS interchanges is called Issuers and Acquirers Community (formerly Consumer Electronic Clearing System; CECS)<ref name=cecs /> also called CS3. CECS required authorisations from the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC), which was obtained in 2001 and reaffirmed in 2009.<ref>[http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/906923 ACCC reap proves CECS]</ref> ATM and EFTPOS clearances are the made under individual bilateral arrangements between the institutions involved.<ref>[http://austlii.edu.au/~alan/bflr-2000.html Australian Payment System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407004414/http://austlii.edu.au/~alan/bflr-2000.html |date=2012-04-07 }}</ref>\n\n===Debit cards===\nAustralian financial institutions provide their customers with a plastic card, which can be used as a debit card or as an [[ATM card]], and sometimes as a credit card. The card merely provides the means by which a customer's linked bank or other accounts can be accessed using an EFTPOS terminal or ATM. These cards can also be used on some [[vending machine]]s and other automatic payment mechanisms, such as ticket vending machines. Australian debit cards cannot be used for [[online banking|online]] and [[telephone banking]] transactions, unless they are also a credit card.\n\nEach Australian bank has given a different name to its debit cards, such as:\n* [[Commonwealth Bank|Commonwealth Bank of Australia]]: Keycard\n* [[Westpac|Westpac Banking Corporation]]: Handycard\n* [[National Australia Bank]]: FlexiCard\n* [[ANZ Bank]]: Access card\n* [[Bendigo Bank]]: Cashcard\n\nSome banks offer alternative debit card facilities to their customers using the Visa or MasterCard clearance system. For example, [[St George Bank]] offers a Visa Debit Card,<ref>[http://www.stgeorge.com.au/personal/bank-accounts/transaction-accounts/visa-debit-card Visa Debit Card - St.George Bank]. Stgeorge.com.au. Retrieved on 2013-09-27.</ref> as does the National Australia Bank. The main difference with regular debit cards is that these cards can be used outside Australia where the respective credit card is accepted.\n\nThose merchants that enter the EFTPOS payment system must accept [[debit card]]s issued by any Australian bank, and some also accept various [[credit card]]s and other cards. Some merchants set minimum transaction amounts for EFTPOS transactions, which can be different for debit and credit card transactions. Some merchants impose a surcharge on the use of EFTPOS. These can vary between merchants and on the type of card being used, and generally are not imposed on debit card transactions, and widely not on MasterCard and a Visa credit card transactions.\n\nA feature of a debit card is that an EFTPOS transaction will only be accepted if there is an available credit balance in the bank cheque or savings account linked to the card.\n\nAustralian debit cards normally cannot be used outside Australia.  They can only be used outside Australia if they carry the MasterCard/Maestro/Cirrus or Visa/Plus or other similar logos, in which case the non-Australian transaction will be processed through those transaction systems. Similarly, non-Australian debit and credit cards can only be used at Australian EFTPOS terminals or ATMs if they have these logos or the MasterCard or Visa logos. Diners Club and/or American Express cards will be accepted only if the merchant has an agreement with those card companies, or increasingly, if the merchant has modern alternative payment options available for those cards, such as through Paypal. The [[Discover Card]] is accepted in Australia as a Diners Club card [http://uat2.dinersclub.com.au/merchants.htm].\n\nIn addition, credit card companies issue [[Stored-value card|prepaid card]]s which act like generic gift cards, which are anonymous and not linked to any bank accounts. These cards are accepted by merchants who accept credit cards and are processed through the EFTPOS terminal in the same way as credit cards.\n\n===Cash out===\nA number of merchants permit customers using a debit card to withdraw cash as part of the EFTPOS transaction.<ref name=NabEftpos>[http://www.nab.com.au/Personal_Finance/0,,9493,00.html Nab \u2014 Eftpos<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref> In Australia, this facility (known as [[debit card cashback]] in many other countries) is known as \"cash out\". For the merchant, cash out is a way of reducing their net cash takings, saving on banking of cash. There is no additional cost to the merchant in providing cash out because banks charge a merchant a debit card transaction fee per EFTPOS transaction,<ref name=ifee /> and not on the transaction value. Cash out is a facility provided by the merchant, and not the bank, so the merchant can limit or vary how much cash can be withdrawn at a time, or suspend the facility at any time. When available, cash out is convenient for the customer, who can bypass having to visit a bank branch or ATM. Cash out is also cheaper for the customer, since only one bank transaction is involved. For people in some remote areas, cash out may be the only way they can withdraw cash from their personal accounts.  However, most merchants who provide the facility set a relatively low limit on cash out, generally $50, and some also charge for the service. Some merchants in Australia only allow cash out with the purchase of goods; other merchants allow cash out whether or not customers buy any goods. Cash out is not available in association with credit card sales because on credit card transactions the merchant is charged a percentage commission based on the transaction value, and also because cash withdrawals are treated differently from purchase transactions by the credit card company. (However, though inconsistent with a merchant's agreement with each credit card company, the merchant may treat a cash withdrawal as part of an ordinary credit card sale.)\n\n===Cardholder verification===\nEFTPOS transactions involving a debit, credit or prepaid card are primarily authenticated via the entry of a [[personal identification number]] (PIN) at the [[point of sale]]. Historically, these transactions were authenticated by the merchant using the cardholder's signature, as signed on their receipt. However, merchants had become increasingly lax in enforcing this verification, resulting in an increase in fraud. Australian banks have since deployed chip and PIN technology using the global [[EMV]] card standard; as of 1 August 2014, Australian merchants no longer accept signatures on transactions by domestic customers at point of sale terminals.<ref name=\"cnet-emvaus\">{{cite web|title=PINs now replace signatures on Australian card transactions|url=https://www.cnet.com/au/news/australian-credit-cards-boost-security-as-chip-and-pin-deadline-approaches/|website=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"zdnet-nomoresig\">{{cite web|title=Credit card signatures to be phased out in Australia|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/credit-card-signatures-to-be-phased-out-in-australia/|website=ZDNet|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs a further security measure, if a user enters an incorrect PIN three times, the card may be locked out of EFTPOS and require reactivation over the phone or at a bank branch. In the case of an ATM, the card will not be returned, and the cardholder will need to visit the branch to retrieve the card, or request a new card to be issued.\n\nAll debit cards now have a [[Magnetic stripe card#Financial cards|magnetic stripe]]{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} on which is encoded the card's service codes, consisting of three-digit values.  These codes are used to convey instructions to merchant terminals on how a card should be processed. The first digit indicates if a card can be used internationally or is valid for domestic use only. It is also used to signal if the card is chip-enabled. The second digit indicates if the transaction must be sent online for authorization always or if transactions that are below floor limit can take place without authorization.  The third digit is used to indicate the preferred card verification method (e.g. PIN) and the environment where the card can be used (e.g. at point of sale only). Merchant terminals are required to recognize and act on service codes or send all transactions for online authorization.<ref>[http://www.visa-asia.com/ap/au/merchants/productstech/visadebit.shtml Visa Australia | Visa Debit]. Visa-asia.com. Retrieved on 2013-09-27.</ref>\n\n===Contactless smart card===\nIn the late 2000s, MasterCard and Visa introduced [[contactless payment|contactless]] smart debit cards under the brand names MasterCard [[PayPass]] and Visa [[payWave]]. These payments are made using either electronic payment networks separate from the regular EFTPOS payment networks, or newer EFTPOS with tap sensors, and is an alternative to the previous swipe or chip systems. These networks are operated by MasterCard and Visa, and not by the banks as is the EFTPOS network, through EFTPOS Payments Australia Limited (ePAL).\n\nThese cards are based on [[EMV technology]] and contain a [[RFID]] chip and antenna loop embedded in the plastic of the card. To pay using this system, a customer passes the card within 4&nbsp;cm of a reader at a merchant checkout. Using this method, for transactions under $100, the customer does not need to authenticate his or her identity by PIN entry or signature, as on a regular EFTPOS machine. For transactions over $100, PIN verification is required.\n\nThe facility is only available for cards branded with the MasterCard PayPass or Visa payWave logos, indicating that they have the system-permitted embedded chip. ANZ has launched ATM solution based on Visa payWave in 2015, where the consumer tap the card on a reader at the ATM and insert a PIN to finalize the cash withdrawals, and not all merchants offer the facility. Bank debit cards and other credit cards do not currently offer a contactless payment facility. ePAL is developing a contactless payment system for debit cards based on EMV technology as well as an extension of debit cards for use for on-line transactions, and a [[mobile payment]] system.<ref>[http://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/docs/annual-reports/annual-report-2011.pdf Eftpos Annual Report 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323232617/http://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/docs/annual-reports/annual-report-2011.pdf |date=2012-03-23 }}</ref> Using contactless debit cards on tap-and-go terminals routes the transaction through the more expensive credit card system instead of the EFTPOS route, adding to the cost to the merchant, and ultimately the consumer.<ref>[https://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/the-hidden-cost-of-the-tap-and-go-boom-20171007-gywcuj.html?_ga=2.230829725.344188306.1520894086-422518476.1516576290 The hidden cost of the tap-and-go boom]</ref>\n\n=== History ===\nThe name and logo for EFTPOS in Australia were originally owned by the [[National Australia Bank]] and were [[trade mark]]s from 1986 until 1991. The ownership was for convenience and all the banks used the name and logo (commonly called \"fat-E\") on their cards and advertising.\n\nIn 1991 dialup EFTPOS was conceived by Key Corp (John Wood) and deployment of dialup commenced in 1993. Until 1993, communications, connections and transactions between banks, ATM banks and EFTPOS devices where conducted via leased lines (a specific power assisted communication line that detects any attempt to tamper with it) but in 1993 mobile wireless EFTPOS was conceived by Dynamic Data Systems (H. Daniel Elbaum). In 1995 Dynamic Data Systems and the banking industry worked together to implement, certify and introduce protocols and standards for cellular networks, and by 1998 the use of mobile EFTPOS began to appear in Australia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=A boost for EFTPOS|last=Cornell|first=Andrew|date=January 1997|work=Electronic Payments International|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.decisive.com.au/html/110598_10.html|title=Optus to develop GSM-based mobile EFTPOS system|last=Sainsbury|first=Michael|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980612141247/http://www.decisive.com.au/html/110598_10.html|archive-date=1998-06-12|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 Commonwealth Bank and MasterCard ran a six-month trial of the [[contactless smart card]] system [[PayPass]] in [[Sydney]] and [[Wollongong]],<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.commbank.com.au/about-us/news/media-releases/2006/050406-news-tap-n-go.aspx\n  | title = Commonwealth Bank unveils \"Tap N Go\u2122\" payment technology\n  | publisher = Commonwealth Bank of Australia\n  | date = 5 April 2006\n  | accessdate = 2011-09-11 }}</ref> \nsupplementing the traditional EFTPOS swipe or chip system.

In either case it is generally considered a \"clumsy forgery\" and an attempt to seek to fill the \"gap\" suggested by Colossians 4:16.<ref>''Miracle and mission'' Page 151 James A.

Paul apparently dictated all his epistles through a secretary (or [[amanuensis]]), but wrote the final few paragraphs of each letter by his own hand.<ref>Harris, p. 316-320.

In the present case he writes a whole paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed sentences. He writes it, too, in large, bold characters (Gr. ''pelikois grammasin''), that his handwriting may reflect the energy and determination of his soul.\"</ref> Many survived and are included in the [[New Testament]], but others are known to have been lost.

It is mentioned by various writers from the fourth century onwards, notably by [[Pope]] [[Gregory the Great]], to whose influence may ultimately be due the frequent occurrence of it in Bibles written in England; for it is more common in English Bibles than in others.

Many inmates arriving at Jasenovac were scheduled for systematic extermination. An important criterion for selection was the duration of a prisoner's anticipated detention. Strong men who were capable of labour and sentenced to less than three years of incarceration were allowed to live. All inmates with indeterminate sentences or sentences of three years or more were immediately scheduled for execution, regardless of their level of fitness.<ref>[[#State-Commission|State Commission, 1946]], pp. 9\u201311, 46\u201347</ref> Some of the mass executions were mechanical according to Nazi methodology.

Despite the lethal effects of carbon monoxide, this was seen as unsuitable for use in the East due to the cost of transporting the carbon monoxide in cylinders.<ref name = \"warning\"/>\n\nEach extermination camp operated differently, yet each had designs for quick and efficient industrialized killing. While H\u00f6ss was away on an official journey in late August 1941 his deputy, [[Karl Fritzsch]], tested out an idea. At Auschwitz clothes infested with lice were treated with crystallised prussic acid. The crystals were made to order by the [[IG Farben]] chemicals company for which the brand name was Zyklon-B. Once released from their container, Zyklon-B crystals in the air released a lethal cyanide gas. Fritzch tried out the effect of Zyklon B on Soviet POWs, who were locked up in cells in the basement of the bunker for this experiment. H\u00f6ss on his return was briefed and impressed with the results and this became the camp strategy for extermination as it was also to be at Majdanek. Besides gassing, the camp guards continued killing prisoners via mass shooting, starvation, torture, etc.<ref>{{cite book|author=Borkin, Joseph|title=The Crime and Punishment of IG Farben|location=New York|publisher=Free Press|year=1978|isbn=978-0-02-904630-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Gassings ===\n{{See also|The Holocaust#Gas chambers|Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|Criticism of Holocaust denial#Use of gas chambers}}\nSS ''[[Obersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Kurt Gerstein]], of the Institute for Hygiene of the Waffen-SS, told a Swedish diplomat during the war of life in a death camp.

The \"difficult\" prisoners were led to a site out of view to be killed off discreetly.\n\nA prisoner ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' (Special Detachment) effected in the processes of extermination; they encouraged the Jews to undress without a hint of what was about to happen. They accompanied them into the gas chambers outfitted to appear as shower rooms (with nonworking water nozzles, and tile walls); and remained with the victims until just before the chamber door closed. To psychologically maintain the \"calming effect\" of the delousing deception, an SS man stood at the door until the end. The ''Sonderkommando'' talked to the victims about life in the camp to pacify the suspicious ones, and hurried them inside; to that effect, they also assisted the aged and the very young in undressing.<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 164\u2013165, 321\u2013322.</ref>\n\nTo further persuade the prisoners that nothing harmful was happening, the ''Sonderkommando'' deceived them with small talk about friends or relations who had arrived in earlier transports. Many young mothers hid their infants beneath their piled clothes fearing that the delousing \"disinfectant\" might harm them. Camp Commandant H\u00f6ss reported that the \"men of the Special Detachment were particularly on the look-out for this\", and encouraged the women to take their children into the \"shower room\". Likewise, the ''Sonderkommando'' comforted older children who might cry \"because of the strangeness of being undressed in this fashion\".<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 164\u2013165, 322\u2013323.</ref>\n\nYet, not every prisoner was deceived by such [[psychological warfare|psychological]] tactics; Commandant H\u00f6ss spoke of Jews \"who either guessed, or knew, what awaited them, nevertheless&nbsp;...

For example, widely published images in America were mostly of typhoid victims and Soviet POWs at the Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps&nbsp;\u2013 the first to be liberated by American troops and the most available imagery in America. In early news reports and for years afterwards these images were often used by the news media somewhat inaccurately in conjunction with descriptions of extermination camps and Jewish suffering.

The term is often historically used to refer specifically to [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunications]] from the [[Catholic Church]], but it is also used more generally to refer to similar types of institutional religious exclusionary practices and [[shunning]] among other religious groups. For instance, many [[Protestant]] denominations, such as the [[Lutheran Church]]es, have similar practices of excusing congregants from church communities, while [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], as well as the [[Churches of Christ]], use the term \"disfellowship\" to refer to their form of excommunication. The [[Amish]] have also been known to excommunicate members that were either seen or known for breaking rules, or questioning the church.\n\nThe word ''excommunication'' means putting a specific individual or group out of [[Communion (Christian)|communion]]. In some denominations, excommunication includes spiritual [[Damnation|condemnation]] of the member or group. Excommunication may involve [[Exile|banishment]], [[shunning]], and [[shaming]], depending on the group, the offense that caused excommunication, or the rules or norms of the religious community. The grave act is often revoked in response to sincere [[penance]], which may be manifested through public recantation, sometimes through the [[Sacrament of Confession]], [[piety]] or through [[mortification of the flesh]].\n\n== Christianity ==\n{{religious text primary|section|date=July 2017}}\nIn {{bibleverse||Matthew|18:15-17|ESV}} Jesus says that an offended person should first draw the offender's fault to the offender's attention privately; then, if the offender refuses to listen, bring one or two others, that there may be more than a single witness to the charge; next, if the offender still refuses to listen, bring the matter before the church, and if the offender refuses to listen to the church, treat the offender as \"a [[Gentile]] and a tax collector\".\n\n{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|5:1-8}} directs the church at Corinth to excommunicate a man for sexual immorality (incest). In {{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|2:5-11|ESV}}, the man, having repented and suffered the \"punishment by the majority\" is restored to the church. Fornication is not the only ground for excommunication, according to the apostle: in {{bibleverse-nb|1|Corinthians|5:11|ESV}}, Paul says, \"I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler - not even to eat with such a one.\"\n\nIn {{bibleverse||Romans|16:17|KJV}}, Paul writes to \"mark those who cause divisions contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them.\" Also, in {{bibleverse|2|John|1:10-11|KJV}}, the writer advises believers that \"whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into ''your'' house [\u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03af\u03b1\u03bd, residence or abode, or \"inmates of the house\" (family)], neither bid him God speed: for he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.\"\n<!--The information here about Phillip Schaff's publication has been removed, as have other dubious references to \"ancient works of interest\".

The excommunications for apostasy, heresy or schism were reserved to the Apostolic see in special manner, though they could be solved by the bishop (though not the general vicar) in his stead (can. 2314 \u00a7 2). The possible excommunication of someone not the Confessor who disclosed something under the Seal of the Confessional was reserved to no one; the excommunication for unlawful episcopal consecrations did not then exist (but there was a ''latae sententiae'' suspension), as neither did the possible excommunication (and certain suspension) of a priest who does have faculties but absolves a penitent he knows to be unrepenting.

It is not expulsion from the churches. This can happen for such reasons as not having confessed within that year; excommunication can also be imposed as part of a penitential period. It is generally done with the goal of restoring the member to full communion. Before an excommunication of significant duration is imposed, the bishop is usually consulted. The Orthodox churches do have a means of expulsion, by pronouncing [[anathema]], but this is reserved only for acts of serious and unrepentant heresy. As an example of this, the Second Council of Constantinople in 553, in its eleventh capitula, declared: \"If anyone does not anathematize Arius, Eunomius, Macedonius, Apollinarius Nestorius, Eutyches and Origen, as well as their heretical books, and also all other heretics who have already been condemned and anathematized by the holy, catholic and apostolic church and by the four holy synods which have already been mentioned, and also all those who have thought or now think in the same way as the aforesaid heretics and who persist in their error even to death: let him be anathema.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xii.vii.html |title=NPNF2-14.

The Lutheran definition, in its earliest and most technical form, would be found in [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Luther's Small Catechism|Small Catechism]], defined beginning at Questions No. 277-283, in \"The Office of Keys.\" Luther endeavored to follow the process that Jesus laid out in the 18th chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. According to Luther, excommunication requires:\n\n::1. The confrontation between the subject and the individual against whom he has sinned.\n::2. If this fails, the confrontation between the subject, the harmed individual, and two or three witnesses to such acts of sin.\n::3. The informing of the pastor of the subject's congregation.\n::4. A confrontation between the pastor and the subject.\n\nMany Lutheran denominations operate under the premise that the entire congregation (as opposed to the pastor alone) must take appropriate steps for excommunication, and there are not always precise rules, to the point where individual congregations often set out rules for excommunicating laymen (as opposed to clergy). For example, churches may sometimes require that a [[vote]] must be taken at Sunday services; some congregations require that this vote be unanimous.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lutheransonline.com/servlet/lo_ProcServ/dbpage=page&mode=display&gid=20051505062631281101111555&pg=20051578012321128501111555 |title=Risen Savior Lutheran Church, Orlando, FL \u2014 Constitution |publisher=Lutheransonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511024600/http://www.lutheransonline.com/servlet/lo_ProcServ/dbpage%3Dpage%26mode%3Ddisplay%26gid%3D20051505062631281101111555%26pg%3D20051578012321128501111555 |archive-date=11 May 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Church of Sweden]] and the [[Church of Denmark]], excommunicated individuals are turned out from their parish in front of their congregation.<ref name=\"Burder1841\"/> They are not forbidden, however, to attend church and participate in other acts of devotion, although they are to sit in a place appointed by the priest (which was at a distance from others).<ref name=\"Burder1841\">{{cite book|last=Burder|first=William|title=Religious Ceremonies and Customs|accessdate=24 May 2018|year=1841|language=English |pages=308\u2013309}}</ref>\n\nThe Lutheran process, though rarely used, has created unusual situations in recent years due to its somewhat [[democratic process|democratic]] excommunication process.

The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] sees it as the third step after \"admonition\" and \"suspension from the sacrament of the Lord's Supper for a season.\"<ref>[[Westminster Confession of Faith]], xxx.4.</ref> Yet, [[John Calvin]] argues in his ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' that church censures do not \"consign those who are excommunicated to perpetual ruin and damnation,\" but are designed to induce repentance, reconciliation and restoration to communion. Calvin notes, \"though ecclesiastical discipline does not allow us to be on familiar and intimate terms with excommunicated persons, still we ought to strive by all possible means to bring them to a better mind, and recover them to the fellowship and unity of the Church.\"<ref>[[John Calvin]], ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.vi.xiii.html IV.12.10].</ref>\n\nAt least one modern Reformed theologian argues that excommunication is not the final step in the disciplinary process. [[Jay E. Adams]] argues that in excommunication, the offender is still seen as a brother, but in the final step they become \"as the heathen and tax collector\" ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 18:17). Adams writes, \"Nowhere in the Bible is excommunication (removal from the fellowship of the Lord's Table, according to Adams) equated with what happens in step 5; rather, step 5 is called \"removing from the midst, handing over to Satan,\" and the like.\"<ref>[[Jay E. Adams]], ''Handbook of Church Discipline'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1986), 74.</ref>\n\nFormer Princeton president and theologian, Jonathan Edwards, addresses the notion of excommunication as \"removal from the fellowship of the Lord's Table\" in his treatise entitled \"The Nature and End of Excommunication\". Edwards argues that \"Particularly, we are forbidden such a degree of associating ourselves with (excommunicants), as there is in making them our guests at our tables, or in being their guests at their tables; as is manifest in the text, where we are commanded to have no company with them, no not to eat\". Edwards insists, \"That this respects not eating with them at the Lord's supper, but a common eating, is evident by the words, that the eating here forbidden, is one of the lowest degrees of keeping company, which are forbidden. Keep no company with such a one, saith the apostle, no not to eat \u2014 as much as to say, no not in so low a degree as to eat with him. But eating with him at the Lord's supper, is the very highest degree of visible Christian communion. Who can suppose that the apostle meant this: Take heed and have no company with a man, no not so much as in the highest degree of communion that you can have? Besides, the apostle mentions this eating as a way of keeping company which, however, they might hold with the heathen. He tells them, not to keep company with fornicators. Then he informs them, he means not with fornicators of this world, that is, the heathens; but, saith he, \"if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, etc. with such a one keep no company, no not to eat.\" This makes it most apparent, that the apostle doth not mean eating at the Lord's table; for so, they might not keep company with the heathens, any more than with an excommunicated person.\"\n\n===Methodism===\nIn the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], individuals were able to be excommunicated following \"trial before a jury of his peers, and after having had the privilege of an appeal to a higher court.\"<ref name=\"Simpson1883\"/> Nevertheless, an excommunication could be lifted after sufficient [[penance]].<ref name=\"Simpson1883\">{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Matthew|title=Cyclopaedia of Methodism: Embracing Sketches of Its Rise, Progress, and Present Condition, with Biographical Notices and Numerous Illustrations|accessdate=24 May 2018|year=1883|publisher=L.H.

Practically, that meant membership in the church entailed a commitment to try to live according to norms of Christian behavior widely held by the Anabaptist tradition.\n\nIn the ideal, discipline in the Anabaptist tradition requires the church to confront a notoriously erring and unrepentant church member, first directly in a very small circle and, if no resolution is forthcoming, expanding the circle in steps eventually to include the entire church congregation. If the errant member persists without repentance and rejects even the admonition of the congregation, that person is excommunicated or excluded from church membership. Exclusion from the church is recognition by the congregation that this person has separated himself or herself from the church by way of his or her visible and unrepentant sin. This is done ostensibly as a final resort to protect the integrity of the church. When this occurs, the church is expected to continue to pray for the excluded member and to seek to restore him or her to its fellowship. There was originally no ''inherent'' expectation to [[shunning|shun]] (completely sever all ties with) an excluded member, however differences regarding this very issue led to early schisms between different Anabaptist leaders and those who followed them.\n\n====Amish====\n[[Jakob Ammann]], founder of the [[Amish]] sect, believed that the shunning of those under the ban should be systematically practiced among the [[Anabaptists#Switzerland|Swiss Anabaptists]] as it was in the north and as was outlined in the [[Dordrecht Confession]]. Ammann's uncompromising zeal regarding this practice was one of the main disputes that led to the schism between the Anabaptist groups that became the Amish and those that eventually would be called Mennonite. Recently more moderate Amish groups have become less strict in their application of excommunication as a discipline. This has led to splits in several communities, an example of which is the Swartzetruber Amish who split from the main body of Old Order Amish because of the latter's practice of lifting the ban from members who later join other churches. In general, the Amish will excommunicate baptized members for failure to abide by their [[Ordnung]] (church rules) as it is interpreted by the local Bishop if certain repeat violations of the Ordnung occur.\n\nExcommunication among the Old Order Amish results in shunning or ''the Meidung'', the severity of which depends on many factors, such as the family, the local community as well as the type of Amish. Some Amish communities cease shunning after one year if the person joins another church later on, especially if it is another Mennonite church. At the most severe, other members of the congregation are prohibited almost all contact with an excommunicated member including social and business ties between the excommunicant and the congregation, sometimes even marital contact between the excommunicant and spouse remaining in the congregation or family contact between adult children and parents.\n\n====Mennonites====\nIn the [[Mennonite|Mennonite Church]] excommunication is rare and is carried out only after many attempts at reconciliation and on someone who is flagrantly and repeatedly violating standards of behavior that the church expects. Occasionally excommunication is also carried against those who repeatedly question the church's behavior or who genuinely differ with the church's theology as well, although in almost all cases the dissenter will leave the church before any discipline need be invoked. In either case, the church will attempt reconciliation with the member in private, first one on one and then with a few church leaders. Only if the church's reconciliation attempts are unsuccessful, the congregation formally revokes church membership. Members of the church generally pray for the excluded member.\n\nSome regional conferences (the Mennonite counterpart to [[dioceses]] of other denominations) of the Mennonite Church have acted to expel member congregations that have openly welcomed non-celibate homosexuals as members. This internal [[Mennonite#Sexual, marriage, and family mores|conflict regarding homosexuality]] has also been an issue for other moderate denominations, such as the [[American Baptist Churches USA|American Baptists]] and [[United Methodist Church|Methodists]].\n\nThe practice among [[Old Order Mennonite]] congregations is more along the lines of Amish, but perhaps less severe typically. An Old Order member who disobeys the ''[[Ordnung]]'' (church regulations) must meet with the leaders of the church. If a church regulation is broken a second time there is a confession in the church. Those who refuse to confess are excommunicated. However upon later confession, the church member will be reinstated. An excommunicated member is placed under [[shunning|the ban]]. This person is not banned from eating with their own family. Excommunicated persons can still have business dealings with church members and can maintain marital relations with a marriage partner, who remains a church member.\n\n====Hutterites====\nThe separatist, communal, and self-contained [[Hutterites]] also use excommunication and shunning as form of church discipline. Since Hutterites have communal ownership of goods, the effects of excommunication could impose a hardship upon the excluded member and family leaving them without employment income and material assets such as a home. However, often arrangements are made to provide material benefits to the family leaving the colony such as an automobile and some transition funds for rent, etc. One Hutterite colony in Manitoba (Canada) had a protracted dispute when leaders attempted to force the departure of a group that had been excommunicated but would not leave. About a dozen lawsuits in both Canada and the United States were filed between the various Hutterite factions and colonies concerning excommunication, shunning, the legitimacy of leadership, communal property rights, and fair division of communal property when factions have separated.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints {{anchor|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}===<!-- This section is linked from [[Shunning]] -->\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}\n{{Main|Disciplinary council}}\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) practices excommunication as penalty for those who commit serious [[sin]]s, ''i.e.'', actions that significantly impair the name or moral influence of the church or pose a threat to other people. According to the church leadership ''[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook]]'', the purposes of church discipline are (1) to save the souls of transgressors, (2) to protect the innocent, and (3) to safeguard the purity, integrity, and good name of the church.\n\nThe LDS Church also practices the lesser sanctions of private counsel and caution, informal probation, formal probation, and disfellowshipment.\n\nDisfellowshipped is used for serious sins that do not rise to the level of excommunication. Disfellowshipment denies some privileges but does not include a loss of church membership. Once disfellowshipped, persons may not take the [[sacrament (Latter Day Saints)|sacrament]] or enter church [[temple (LDS Church)|temples]], nor may they offer public prayers or sermons. Disfellowshipped persons may continue to attend most church functions and are permitted to wear [[temple garment]]s, pay tithes and offerings, and participate in church classes if their conduct is orderly. Disfellowshipment typically lasts for one year, after which one may be reinstated as a member in good standing.\n\nIn the more grievous or recalcitrant cases, excommunication becomes a disciplinary option. Excommunication is generally reserved for what are seen as the most serious [[sin]]s, including committing serious [[crime]]s such as murder, child abuse, and incest; committing [[adultery]]; involvement in or teaching of [[polygamy]]; involvement in [[homosexuality|homosexual]] conduct; [[apostasy]]; participation in an [[abortion]]; teaching false doctrine; or openly criticizing church leaders. A 2006 revision to the ''Handbook'' states that formally joining another church constitutes apostasy and is an excommunicable offense; however, merely attending another church does not constitute apostasy.\n\nAn excommunication can occur only after a formal [[disciplinary council]].<ref>The procedure followed by a church disciplinary council is described in church handbooks and the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book= 102|verse=9|range=-18}}</ref> Formerly called a \"church court,\" the councils were renamed to avoid focusing on guilt and instead to emphasize the availability of repentance.\n\nThe decision to excommunicate a [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] holder is generally the province of the leadership of a [[Stake (Mormonism)|stake]]. In such a disciplinary council, the stake presidency and stake [[High council (Mormonism)|high council]] attend. The twelve members of the high council are split in half: one group represents the member in question and is charged with \"prevent[ing] insult or injustice\"; the other group represents the church as a whole. The member under scrutiny is invited to attend the disciplinary proceedings, but the council can go forward without him. In making a decision, the leaders of the high council consult with the stake presidency, but the decision about which discipline is necessary is the stake president's alone. It is possible to appeal a decision of a stake disciplinary council to the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]].\n\nFor females and for male members not initiated into the Melchizedek priesthood, a [[ward (LDS Church)|ward]] disciplinary council is held. In such cases, a [[bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] determines whether excommunication or a lesser sanction is warranted. He does this in consultation with his two counselors, with the bishop making the final determination after prayer. The decision of a ward disciplinary council can be appealed to the stake president.\n\nThe following list of variables serves as a general set of guidelines for when excommunication or lesser action may be warranted, beginning with those more likely to result in severe sanction:{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n#Violation of covenants: [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|Covenants]] are made in conjunction with specific [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] in the LDS Church. Violated covenants that might result in excommunication are usually those surrounding marriage covenants, temple covenants, and priesthood covenants.\n#Position of trust or authority: The person's position in the church hierarchy factors into the decision. It is considered more serious when a sin is committed by an [[area seventy]]; a stake, [[mission president|mission]], or [[temple president]]; a [[bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]]; a [[patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|patriarch]]; or a [[Mormon missionary|full-time missionary]].\n#Repetition: Repetition of a sin is more serious than a single instance.\n#Magnitude: How often, how many individuals were impacted, and who is aware of the sin factor into the decision.\n#Age, maturity, and experience: Those who are young in age, or immature in their understanding, are typically afforded leniency.\n#Interests of the innocent: How the discipline will impact innocent family members may be considered.\n#Time between transgression and confession: If the sin was committed in the distant past, and there has not been repetition, leniency may be considered.\n#Voluntary confession: If a person voluntarily confesses the sin, leniency is suggested.\n#Evidence of repentance: Sorrow for sin, and demonstrated commitment to repentance, as well as faith in Jesus Christ all play a role in determining the severity of discipline.\n\nNotices of excommunication may be made public, especially in cases of apostasy, where members could be misled; however, the specific reasons for individual excommunications are typically kept confidential and are seldom made public by church leadership.\n\nThose who are excommunicated lose their church membership and the right to partake of the [[Sacrament (Mormonism)|sacrament]]. Such persons are usually allowed to attend church meetings but participation is limited: they cannot offer public prayers or preach sermons and cannot enter [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]]. Excommunicated members are also barred from wearing or purchasing [[temple garment]]s and from paying [[tithe]]s. Excommunicated members may be re-baptized after a waiting period and sincere [[repentance]], as judged by a series of interviews with church leaders.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last =Burton\n  | first =Theodore M.\n  | author-link = Theodore M.

They interpret these verses to mean that any baptized believer who engages in \"gross sins\" is to be expelled from the congregation and shunned.\n\nWhen a member confesses to, or is accused of, a ''serious sin'', a ''judicial committee'' of at least three [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Elders|elders]] is formed. This committee investigates the case and determines the magnitude of the sin committed. If the person is deemed guilty of a disfellowshipping offense, the committee then decides, on the basis of the person's attitude and \"works befitting repentance\" ({{bibleverse||Acts|26:20}}), whether the person is to be considered repentant. The \"works\" may include trying to correct the wrong, making apologies to any offended individuals, and compliance with earlier counsel. If deemed guilty but repentant, the person is not disfellowshipped but is formally ''reproved'' and has ''restrictions'' imposed, which preclude the individual from various activities such as presenting talks, offering public prayers or making comments at religious meetings. If the person is deemed guilty and unrepentant, he or she will be disfellowshipped. Unless an appeal is made within seven days, the disfellowshipping is made formal by an announcement at the congregation's next [[Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Midweek meeting|Service Meeting]]. Appeals are granted to determine if procedural errors are felt to have occurred that may have affected the outcome.\n\nDisfellowshipping is a severing of friendly relationships between all Jehovah's Witnesses and the disfellowshipped person. Interaction with extended family is typically restricted to a minimum, such as presence at the reading of wills and providing essential care for the elderly. Within a household, typical family contact may continue, but without spiritual fellowship such as family Bible study and religious discussions. Parents of disfellowshipped minors living in the family home may continue to attempt to convince the child about the group's teachings. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that this form of discipline encourages the disfellowshipped individual to conform to biblical standards and prevents the person from influencing other members of the congregation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|journal=Our Kingdom Ministry|title=Display Christian Loyalty When a Relative Is Disfellowshipped|pages=3\u20134|date=August 2002}}</ref>\n\nAlong with breaches of the Witnesses' moral code, openly disagreeing with the teachings Jehovah's Witnesses is considered grounds for shunning.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> These persons are labeled as \"apostates\" and are described in Watch Tower Society literature as \"mentally diseased\".<ref name=\"WT-w06\">''The Watchtower'', 15 January 2006, pages=21&ndash;25</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=July 2011|page=16|title=Will You Heed Jehovah\u2019s Clear Warnings?|quote=Well, apostates are \u201cmentally diseased,\u201d and they seek to infect others with their disloyal teachings.}}</ref> Descriptions of \"apostates\" appearing in the Witnesses literature have been the subject of investigation in the UK to determine if they violate religious hatred laws.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/28/jehovahs-witness-magazine_n_985479.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Benjamin | last=Hart | title=Jehovah's Witness Magazine Brands Defectors 'Mentally Diseased' | date=28 September 2011}}</ref> Sociologist Andrew Holden claims many Witnesses who would otherwise defect because of disillusionment with the organization and its teachings, remain affiliated out of fear of being shunned and losing contact with friends and family members.<ref name=Pratt>Pratt, International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, 1:192.</ref> Shunning employs what is known ''as relational aggression'' in psychological literature.

Disfellowshipping can occur for moral reasons, changing beliefs, or (in some ecclesias) for not attending [[Eucharist|communion]] (referred to as \"the emblems\" or \"the breaking of bread\").<ref>A distinction can be detected between these three reasons in that which of the three applies is usually made clear in the notice which the ecclesia will post in the Ecclesial News section of The Christadelphian.

See Booker G. ''1 & 2 Thessalonians'', Nicholls A.H.''Letters to Timothy and Titus'', Birmingham</ref>\n\n* Behavioural cases. Many cases regarding moral issues tend to involve relational matters such as marriage outside the faith, divorce and remarriage (which is considered adultery in some circumstances by some ecclesias), or homosexuality.<ref>Generally Christadelphians do not consider remarriage as adultery, but adultery is often at the root of a marriage breakup. See ''Reflections on Marriage and Divorce'', The Christadelphian, Birmingham.</ref> Reinstatement for moral issues is determined by the ecclesia's assessment of whether the individual has \"turned away\" from (ceased) the course of action considered immoral by the church. This can be complex when dealing with cases of divorce and subsequent remarriage, with different positions adopted by different ecclesias, but generally within the main \"Central\" grouping, such cases can be accommodated.<ref>Carter, J. Marriage and Divorce, CMPA Birmingham 1955</ref> Some minority \"fellowships\" do not accommodate this under any circumstances.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n* Doctrinal cases. Changes of belief on what Christadelphians call \"first principle\" doctrines are difficult to accommodate unless the individual agrees to not teach or spread them, since the body has a documented Statement of Faith which informally serves as a basis of ecclesial membership and interecclesial fellowship. Those who are disfellowshipped for reasons of differing belief rarely return, because they are expected to conform to an understanding with which they do not agree. Holding differing beliefs on fundamental matters is considered as error and [[apostasy]], which can limit a person's salvation. However, in practice disfellowship for doctrinal reasons is now unusual.<ref>e.g. ''News from the Ecclesias'', in The Christadelphian, in a typical year (Jan.-Dec. 2006) contained only two suspensions for doctrinal reasons in the UK, both indicating that the member had already left of his/her own choice.</ref>\n\nIn the case of adultery and divorce, the passage of time usually means a member can be restored if he or she wants to be. In the case of ongoing behaviour, cohabitation, homosexual activity, then the terms of the suspension have not been met.\n\nThe mechanics of \"refellowship\" follow the reverse of the original process; the individual makes an application to the \"ecclesia\", and the \"Arranging Brethren\" give a recommendation to the members who vote.<ref>Christadelphians interpret the \"epitimia of the majority\" 2Co.2:6 in different ways; some consider it the majority of all members, some the majority of elders. See Whittaker H.A., ''Second Corinthians'', Biblia</ref> If the \"Arranging Brethren\" judge that a vote may divide the ecclesia, or personally upset some members, they may seek to find a third party ecclesia which is willing to \"refellowship\" the member instead. According to the Ecclesial Guide a third party ecclesia may also take the initiative to \"refellowship\" another meeting's member. However this cannot be done unilaterally, as this would constitute [[heteronomy]] over the [[autonomy]] of the original ecclesia's members.<ref>An exception noted in Roberts' Ecclesial Guide is where the original meeting is known for having a position out of step with other ecclesias. In practice however such cases are extremely unusual and the attempt to refellowship another ecclesia's member when the original ecclesia considers that they have not \"mended their ways\" may cause an interecclesial breach. The original ecclesia may notify the Christadelphian Magazine that the third party ecclesia is interfering in their own discipline of their own member, and news of refellowship will be blocked from News From the Ecclesias, and consequently the community as a whole will not recognise the refellowship. See Booker, G. ''Biblical Fellowship'' Biblia, Perry, A. ''Fellowship Matters'' Willow Books.</ref>\n\n===Society of Friends (Quakers)===\nAmong many of the [[Quakers|Society of Friends]] groups (Quakers) one is ''read out of meeting'' for behaviour inconsistent with the sense of the meeting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Free Quaker Meeting House|publisher=Independence Hall Association|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|url=http://www.ushistory.org/tour/free-quaker-meeting-house.htm}}</ref> However it is the responsibility of each meeting, quarterly meeting, and yearly meeting, to act with respect to their own members. For example, during the Vietnam War many Friends were concerned about Friend [[Richard Nixon]]'s position on war which seemed at odds with their beliefs; however, it was the responsibility of Nixon's own meeting, the East Whittier Meeting of [[Whittier, California]], to act if indeed that meeting felt the leaning.<ref name=\"Peter\">{{cite web|author=Blood-Paterson, Peter|year=1998|title=Holy Obedience: Corporate Discipline and Individual Leading|publisher=New York Yearly Meeting|url=http://www.nyym.org/leadings/holy_obedience.html|access-date=16 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201204008/http://www.nyym.org/leadings/holy_obedience.html|archive-date=1 December 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They did not.<ref name=\"Mayer\">{{Cite book|author=Mayer, Milton Sanford|year=1975|title=The Nature of the Beast|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=O7O29dFrtfUC&pg=PA310 310&ndash;315]|isbn=978-0-87023-176-6}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, before the founding of abolitionist societies, Friends who too forcefully tried to convince their coreligionists of the evils of slavery were read out of meeting.  Benjamin Lay was read out of the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting for this.<ref name=\"Peter\" /> During the American Revolution over 400 Friends were read out of meeting for their military participation or support.<ref name=\"Mayer\" />\n\n===Iglesia ni Cristo===\n[[Iglesia ni Cristo]] practices a form expulsion similar to excommunication in Catholicism, expelling members it deems to have gravely sinned or gone against the teachings and doctrines of the church. The Sanggunian, the church's council, has jurisdiction to expel members from the church. People expelled by the church are referred to as ''dismissed'' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''tiwalag''). Offenses that may be grounds for expulsion include marrying a non-member and becoming pregnant out of wedlock.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Doyo|first1=Ceres|title=\u2018Tiwalag\u2019|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/87364/tiwalag|accessdate=9 November 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=6 August 2015}}</ref> An expelled member can be re-admitted by pledging obedience to the church and its values and teachings.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|title=Iglesia ni Cristo can re-admit expelled Manalo kin|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100272-iglesia-cristo-readmit-expelled-manalo-kin|accessdate=9 November 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=23 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Unitarian-Universalism ==\n\n[[Unitarian Universalism]], being a [[liberal religion|liberal religious]] group and a [[Congregationalist polity|congregational]] denomination, has a wide diversity of opinions and sentiments. Nonetheless, Unitarian Universalists have had to deal with disruptive individuals. Congregations which had no policies on disruptive individuals have sometimes found themselves having to create such policies, up to (and including) expulsion.<ref name=\"uua.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uua.org/interconnections/21966.shtml|title=Policies for Handling Disruptive People|author=Donald E. Skinner|work=UUA.org}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1990s, several churches were using the West Shore UU Church's policy as a model. If someone is threatening, disruptive, or distracting from the appeal of the church to its membership, a church using this model has three recommended levels of response to the offending individual. While the first level involves dialogue between a committee or clergy member and the offender, the second and third levels involve expulsion, either from the church itself or a church activity.<ref name=\"uua.org\"/><ref>http://www.uua.org/sites/live-new.uua.org/files/documents/congservices/safecongs/disruptive_policy.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uufdekalb.org/member-center/policies-bylaws/safe-congregation-policy|title=Safe Congregation Policy|work=uufdekalb.org}}</ref>\n\n== Buddhism ==\n{{main|Patimokkha in Theravada Buddhism}}\nThere is no direct equivalent to excommunication in [[Buddhism]]. However, in the [[Theravadan]] monastic community monks can be expelled from monasteries for heresy or other acts. In addition, the monks have four vows, called the four defeats, which are abstaining from sexual intercourse, stealing, murder, and refraining from lying about spiritual gains (e.g., having special power or ability to perform miracles). If even one is broken, the monk is automatically a layman again and can never become a monk in his or her current life.\n\nMost Japanese Buddhist sects hold ecclesiastical authority over their followers and have their own rules for expelling  members of the sangha, lay or bishopric.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The lay [[Japanese Buddhist]] organization [[S\u014dka Gakkai]] was expelled from the [[Nichiren Shoshu]] sect in 1991 (1997).\n\n== Hinduism ==\n[[Hinduism]] has been too diverse to be seen as a monolithic religion, and with a conspicuous absence of any listed dogma or ecclesia (organised church), has no concept of excommunication and hence no Hindu may be ousted from the Hindu religion, although a person may easily lose [[caste]] status for a very wide variety of infringements of caste prohibitions.  This may or may not be recoverable.  However, some of the modern organized sects within Hinduism may practice something equivalent to excommunication today, by ousting a person from their own sect.\n\nIn medieval and early-modern times (and sometimes even now) in South Asia, excommunication from one's ''[[caste]]'' (''jati'' or ''varna'') used to be practiced (by the caste-councils) and was often with serious consequences, such as abasement of the person's caste status and even throwing him into the sphere of the [[Dalit (outcaste)|untouchables]] or [[bhangi]]. In the 19th century, a Hindu faced excommunication for going abroad, since it was presumed he would be forced to break caste restrictions and, as a result, become polluted.<ref name=\"Britannica - Outcaste\">{{citation | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/435540/outcaste |title=Outcaste |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nAfter excommunication, it would depend upon the caste-council whether they would accept any form of repentance (ritual or otherwise) or not. Such current examples of excommunication in Hinduism are often more political or social rather than religious, for example the excommunication of lower castes for refusing to work as scavengers in Tamil Nadu.<ref name=\"Article-TheHindu\">{{citation | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/article1074200.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Imprisoned for life | date=9 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nAn earlier example of excommunication in Hinduism is that of [[Shastri Yagnapurushdas]], who voluntarily left and was later  expelled from the [[Vadtal Gadi]] of the [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]] by the then Vadtal acharya in 1906. He went on to form his own institution, ''Bochasanwasi Swaminarayan Sanstha'' or ''BSS'' (now [[BAPS]]) claiming [[Gunatitanand Swami]] was the rightful spiritual successor to [[Swaminarayan]].<ref name=\"isbn0-691-12048-X\">{{cite book |author= |title=The camphor flame: popular Hinduism and society in India |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=2004 |page=172 |isbn=0-691-12048-X}}</ref><ref name=\"isbn052165422X\">{{cite book | author=Raymond Brady Williams | title=Introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location= | year=2001 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tPkexi2EhAIC&pg=|isbn=0-521-65422-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=26 March 2011}} Page 54</ref>\n\n== Islam ==\n{{Main|Takfir}}\nExcommunication as it exists in Christian faiths does not exist in [[Islam]]. Moreover, there is a clear mandate within the Quran stating there is no compulsion in religion therefore one cannot force another to believe. Ergo, no one has authority over doctrinal matters.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Asad |first1=Muhammad |title=No compulsion in Islam |url=https://muhammadasad.com/2/256}}</ref> The nearest approximation is ''takfir'', a declaration that an individual or group is ''[[kafir]]'' (or ''kuffar'' in plural), a non-believer. This does not prevent an individual from taking part in any Islamic rite or ritual, and since the matter of whether a person is ''kafir'' is a rather subjective matter, a declaration of ''takfir'' is generally considered null and void if the target refutes it or if the Islamic community in which he or she lives refuses to accept it.\n\n''Takfir'' has usually been practiced through the courts.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} More recently,{{When|date=June 2009}} cases have taken place where individuals have been considered kuffar.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} These decisions followed lawsuits against individuals, mainly in response to their writings that some have viewed as anti-Islamic. The most famous cases are of [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Nasr Abu Zayd]], and [[Nawal El-Saadawi]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The repercussions of such cases have included divorce, since under traditional interpretations of Islamic law, Muslim women are [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|not permitted to marry]] non-Muslim men.\n\nHowever, ''takfir'' remains a highly contentious issue in Islam, primarily because there is no universally accepted authority in Islamic law. Indeed, according to classical commentators, the reverse seems to hold true, in that [[Muhammad]] reportedly equated the act of declaring someone a ''kafir'' itself to blasphemy if the accused individual maintained that he was a Muslim.\n\n== Judaism ==\n{{Main|Herem (censure)}}\n''[[Herem (censure)|Cherem]]'' is the highest ecclesiastical censure in [[Judaism]]. It is the total exclusion of a person from the [[Jew]]ish community. Except for cases in the [[Charedi]] community, ''cherem'' stopped existing after [[The Enlightenment]], when local Jewish communities lost their political autonomy, and Jews were integrated into the gentile nations in which they lived.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} A ''[[siruv]]'' order, equivalent to a [[contempt of court]], issued by a [[Rabbinical court]] may also limit religious participation.\n\nRabbinical conferences of movements do expel members from time to time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/323587/when-reform-leaders-downplay-charges-of-rabbis-behaving-badly/|title=When Reform Leaders Downplay Charges of Rabbis Behaving Badly|date=2 November 2015|work=The Forward}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/06/12/news-opinion/united-states/rabbi-marc-schneier-blames-rca-expulsion-on-mail|title=Hamptons rabbi blames expulsion on mail snafu, not affair|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20121104/cityandregion/121109641/1057|title=Expelled rabbi's role in High Holy Day service condemned|work=www.buffaloNews.com|access-date=6 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121155211/http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=%2F20121104%2Fcityandregion%2F121109641%2F1057|archive-date=21 November 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> but sometimes choose the lesser penalty of censuring the offending rabbi.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/27/nyregion/rabbi-is-censured-not-expelled-by-her-conservative-colleagues.html</ref> Between 2010 and 2015, the [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]] [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] expelled six rabbis, the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] [[Rabbinical Council of America]] expelled three, and the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jewish]] [[Rabbinical Assembly]] expelled one, suspended three, and caused one to resign without eligibility for reinstatement.<ref name=\"forward.com\">{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/309828/whos-investigating-the-rabbis-who-cross-the-line/|title=Who's Investigating Rabbis Who Cross the Line?|date=11 June 2015|work=The Forward}}</ref> While the CCAR and RCA were relatively shy about their reasons for expelling rabbis, the RA was more open about its reasons for kicking rabbis out.
