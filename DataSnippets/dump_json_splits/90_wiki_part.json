Each entry in the second row is the product of the ''x''-value (3 in this example) with the third-row entry immediately to the left. The entries in the first row are the coefficients of the polynomial to be evaluated. Then the remainder of <math>f(x)</math> on division by <math>x-3</math> is 5.\n\nBut by the [[polynomial remainder theorem]], we know that the remainder is <math>f(3) </math>. Thus <math>f(3) = 5</math>\n\nIn this example, if <math>a_3 = 2, a_2 = -6, a_1 = 2, a_0 = -1</math> we can see that <math>b_3 = 2, b_2 = 0, b_1 = 2, b_0 = 5 </math>, the entries in the third row.

The answer is\n\n:<math>\\frac{f_1(x)}{f_2(x)}=2x^3-2x^2-x+1-\\frac{4}{2x-1}.</math>\n\n===Floating-point multiplication and division===\n{{main|multiplication algorithm#Shift and add}}\n\nHorner's method is a fast, code-efficient method for multiplication and division of binary numbers on a [[microcontroller]] with no [[binary multiplier|hardware multiplier]].  One of the binary numbers to be multiplied is represented as a trivial polynomial, where (using the above notation) ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1, and ''x'' = 2.  Then, ''x'' (or ''x'' to some power) is repeatedly factored out.  In this [[binary numeral system]] (base 2), ''x'' = 2, so powers of 2 are repeatedly factored out.\n\n====Example====\nFor example, to find the product of two numbers (0.15625) and ''m'':\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n(0.15625) m & = (0.00101_b) m = ( 2^{-3} + 2^{-5}) m = (2^{-3})m + (2^{-5})m \\\\\n & = 2^{-3} (m + (2^{-2})m) = 2^{-3} (m + 2^{-2} (m)).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n====Method====\nTo find the product of two binary numbers ''d'' and ''m'':\n:1. A register holding the intermediate result is initialized to ''d''.\n:2. Begin with the least significant (rightmost) non-zero bit in ''m''.\n::2b. Count (to the left) the number of bit positions to the next most significant non-zero bit.  If there are no more-significant bits, then take the value of the current bit position.\n::2c. Using that value, perform a left-shift operation by that number of bits on the register holding the intermediate result\n:3. If all the non-zero bits were counted, then the intermediate result register now holds the final result.  Otherwise, add d to the intermediate result, and continue in step 2 with the next most significant bit in ''m''.\n\n====Derivation====\nIn general, for a binary number with bit values (<math> d_3 d_2 d_1 d_0 </math>) the product is\n:<math> (d_3 2^3 + d_2 2^2 + d_1 2^1 + d_0 2^0)m = d_3 2^3 m + d_2 2^2 m + d_1 2^1 m + d_0 2^0 m. </math>\nAt this stage in the algorithm, it is required that terms with zero-valued coefficients are dropped, so that only binary coefficients equal to one are counted, thus the problem of multiplication or [[division by zero]] is not an issue, despite this implication in the factored equation:\n\n:<math> = d_0\\left(m + 2 \\frac{d_1}{d_0} \\left(m + 2 \\frac{d_2}{d_1} \\left(m + 2 \\frac{d_3}{d_2} (m)\\right)\\right)\\right). </math>\n\nThe denominators all equal one (or the term is absent), so this reduces to\n:<math> = d_0(m + 2 {d_1} (m + 2 {d_2} (m + 2 {d_3} (m)))),</math>\nor equivalently (as consistent with the \"method\" described above)\n:<math> = d_3(m + 2^{-1} {d_2} (m + 2^{-1}{d_1} (m + {d_0} (m)))). </math>\n\nIn binary (base-2) math, multiplication by a power of 2 is merely a [[arithmetic shift|register shift]] operation.  Thus, multiplying by 2 is calculated in base-2 by an [[arithmetic shift]].  The factor (2<sup>\u22121</sup>) is a right [[arithmetic shift]], a (0) results in no operation (since 2<sup>0</sup> = 1 is the multiplicative [[identity element]]), and a (2<sup>1</sup>) results in a left arithmetic shift.\nThe multiplication product can now be quickly calculated using only arithmetic shift operations, addition and subtraction.\n\nThe method is particularly fast on processors supporting a single-instruction shift-and-addition-accumulate.  Compared to a C floating-point library, Horner's method sacrifices some accuracy, however it is nominally 13 times faster (16 times faster when the \"[[canonical signed digit]]\" (CSD) form is used) and uses only 20% of the code space.<ref>{{harvnb|Kripasagar|2008|p=62}}.</ref>\n\n=== Polynomial root finding ===\nUsing Horner's method in combination with [[Newton's method]], it is possible to approximate the real roots of a polynomial. The algorithm works as follows. Given a polynomial <math>p_n(x)</math> of degree <math>n</math> with zeros <math> z_n < z_{n-1} < \\cdots < z_1,</math> make some initial guess <math> x_0 </math> such that <math> x_0 > z_1 </math>. Now iterate the following two steps:\n\n1. Using [[Newton's method]], find the largest zero <math>z_1</math> of <math>p_n(x)</math> using the guess <math>x_0</math>.\n\n2. Using Horner's method, divide out <math>(x-z_1)</math> to obtain <math>p_{n-1}</math>. Return to step 1 but use the polynomial <math>p_{n-1}</math> and the initial guess <math>z_1</math>.\n\nThese two steps are repeated until all real zeros are found for the polynomial. If the approximated zeros are not precise enough, the obtained values can be used as initial guesses for Newton's method but using the full polynomial rather than the reduced polynomials.<ref>{{harvnb|Kress|1991|p=112}}.</ref>\n\n==== Example ====\n\n[[File:HornerandNewton.gif|thumb|right|500px|Polynomial root finding using Horner's method]]\n\nConsider the polynomial\n\n: <math>\np_6(x) = (x-3)(x+3)(x+5)(x+8)(x-2)(x-7)\n</math>\n\nwhich can be expanded to\n\n: <math>\np_6(x) = x^6 + 4x^5 - 72x^4 -214x^3 + 1127x^2 + 1602x -5040.\n</math>\n\nFrom the above we know that the largest root of this polynomial is 7 so we are able to make an initial guess of 8. Using Newton's method the first zero of 7 is found as shown in black in the figure to the right. Next <math>p(x)</math> is divided by <math>(x-7)</math> to obtain\n\n: <math>\np_5(x) = x^5 + 11x^4 + 5x^3 - 179x^2 - 126x + 720\n</math>\n\nwhich is drawn in red in the figure to the right. Newton's method is used to find the largest zero of this polynomial with an initial guess of 7. The largest zero of this polynomial which corresponds to the second largest zero of the original polynomial is found at 3 and is circled in red. The degree 5 polynomial is now divided by <math>(x-3)</math> to obtain\n\n: <math>\np_4(x) = x^4 + 14x^3 + 47x^2 - 38x - 240\n</math>\n\nwhich is shown in yellow. The zero for this polynomial is found at 2 again using Newton's method and is circled in yellow. Horner's method is now used to obtain\n\n: <math>\np_3(x) = x^3 + 16x^2 + 79x + 120\n</math>\n\nwhich is shown in green and found to have a zero at&nbsp;&minus;3. This polynomial is further reduced to\n\n: <math>\np_2(x) = x^2 + 13x + 40\n</math>\n\nwhich is shown in blue and yields a zero of&nbsp;&minus;5. The final root of the original polynomial may be found by either using the final zero as an initial guess for Newton's method, or by reducing <math>p_2(x)</math> and solving the linear equation. As can be seen, the expected roots of &minus;8, &minus;5, &minus;3, 2, 3, and 7 were found.\n\n==== Octave implementation ====\nThe following [[GNU Octave|Octave]] code was used in the example above to implement Horner's method.\n\n<source lang=\"octave\">\nfunction [y b] = horner(a,x)\n  % Input a is the polynomial coefficient vector, x the value to be evaluated at.\n  % The output y is the evaluated polynomial and b the divided coefficient vector.\n  b(1) = a(1);\n  for i = 2:length(a)\n    b(i) = a(i)+x*b(i-1);\n  end\n  y = b(length(a));\n  b = b(1:length(b)-1);\nend\n</source>\n\n==== Python implementation ====\n\nThe following [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code implements Horner's method.\n\n<source lang=\"python\">\ndef horner(x, *polynomial):\n    \"\"\"Implement the Horner Scheme for evaluating a\n    polynomial of coefficients *polynomial in x.\"\"\"\n    result = 0\n    for coefficient in reversed(polynomial):\n        result = result * x + coefficient\n    return result\n</source>\n\n==== C implementation ====\n\nThe following [[C (programming language)|C]] code implements Horner's method.\n<source lang=\"c\">\ndouble HornerEvaluate (double x, double * CoefficientsOfPolynomial, unsigned int DegreeOfPolynomial)\n{\n    /*\n        We want to evaluate the polynomial in x, of coefficients CoefficientsOfPolynomial, using Horner's method.\n        The result is stored in dbResult.\n    */\n    double dbResult = 0.0;\n    int i;\n    for(i = DegreeOfPolynomial; i >= 0; i--)\n    {\n        dbResult = dbResult * x + CoefficientsOfPolynomial[i];\n    }\n    return dbResult;\n}\n</source>\n\nHere is a slightly optimized version using explicit fused [[Multiply\u2013accumulate operation]], often execute faster than the above when running on a computer built with a processor supporting FMA instruction:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\n// gcc -std=c11 -lm horner.c -o horner\n#include <math.h>\n\ndouble horner_fma(double x, const double *coeffs, size_t count)\n{\n    double result = 0.0;\n    for (int idx = count-1; idx >= 0; idx--)\n        result = fma(result, x, coeffs[idx]);\n    return result;\n}\n</source>\n\n====  C# implementation ====\n\nThe following C# code implements Horner's method.\n\n<source lang=\"c#\">\npublic double HornerEvaluate(int[] numbers, double x)\n{\n\tdouble result = 0;\n\t\n\tfor(int i = numbers.Length - 1; i >= 0; i--)\n\t{\n\t\tresult = result * x + numbers[i];\n\t}\n\t\n\treturn result;\n}\n</source>\n\n== Application ==\n\nHorner's method can be used to convert between different positional [[numeral system]]s \u2013 in which case ''x'' is the base of the number system, and the ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> coefficients are the digits of the base-''x'' representation of a given number \u2013 and can also be used if ''x'' is a [[matrix (math)|matrix]], in which case the gain in computational efficiency is even greater. In fact, when ''x'' is a matrix, further acceleration is possible which exploits the structure of [[matrix multiplication]], and only <math>\\sqrt{n}</math> instead of ''n'' multiplies are needed (at the expense of requiring more storage) using the 1973 method of Paterson and Stockmeyer.<ref>{{harvnb|Higham|2002|loc=Section 5.4}}.</ref>\n\n== Efficiency ==\n\nEvaluation using the monomial form of a degree-''n'' polynomial requires at most ''n'' additions and (''n''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n'')/2 multiplications, if powers are calculated by repeated multiplication and each monomial is evaluated individually.  (This can be reduced to ''n'' additions and 2''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 multiplications by evaluating the powers of ''x'' iteratively.)  If numerical data are represented in terms of digits (or bits), then the naive algorithm also entails storing approximately 2''n'' times the number of bits of ''x'' (the evaluated polynomial has approximate magnitude ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>, and one must also store ''x''<sup>''n''</sup> itself).  By contrast, Horner's method requires only ''n'' additions and ''n'' multiplications, and its storage requirements are only ''n'' times the number of bits of ''x''. Alternatively, Horner's method can be computed with ''n'' [[fused multiply\u2013add]]s.  Horner's method can also be extended to evaluate the first ''k'' derivatives of the polynomial with ''kn'' additions and multiplications.<ref>{{harvnb|Pankiewicz|1968}}.</ref>\n\nHorner's method is optimal, in the sense that any algorithm to evaluate an arbitrary polynomial must use at least as many operations. [[Alexander Ostrowski]] proved in 1954 that the number of additions required is minimal.<ref>{{harvnb|Ostrowski|1954}}.</ref> [[Victor Pan]] proved in 1966 that the number of multiplications is minimal.<ref>{{harvnb|Pan|1966}}.</ref> However, when ''x'' is a matrix, Horner's method is not optimal{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.\n\nThis assumes that the polynomial is evaluated in monomial form and no [[preconditioning]] of the representation is allowed, which makes sense if the polynomial is evaluated only once. However, if preconditioning is allowed and the polynomial is to be evaluated many times, then faster algorithms are possible. They involve a transformation of the representation of the polynomial. In general, a degree-''n'' polynomial can be evaluated using only <math>{\\scriptstyle{\\left\\lfloor n/2 \\right\\rfloor + 2}}</math> multiplications and ''n'' additions.<ref>{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}.</ref>\n\n== Divided difference of a polynomial ==\n\nHorner's method can be modified to compute the divided difference <math>(p(y) - p(x))/(y - x).</math> Given the polynomial (as before)\n\n:<math>p(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \\cdots + a_n x^n,</math>\n\nproceed as follows<ref name=\"Fateman & Kahan\">{{harvnb|Fateman|Kahan|2000}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nb_n & = a_n,                 &\\quad d_n &= b_n, \\\\\nb_{n-1} & = a_{n-1} + b_n x, &\\quad d_{n-1} &= b_{n-1} + d_n y, \\\\\n& {}\\  \\  \\vdots             &\\quad &  {}\\ \\ \\vdots\\\\\nb_1 & = a_1 + b_2 x,         &\\quad d_1 &= b_1 + d_2 y,\\\\\nb_0 & = a_0 + b_1 x.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAt completion, we have\n:<math>\\begin{align}\np(x) &= b_0, \\\\\n\\frac{p(y) - p(x)}{y - x} &= d_1, \\\\\np(y) &= b_0 + (y - x) d_1.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThis computation of the divided difference is subject to less\nround-off error than evaluating <math>p(x)</math> and <math>p(y)</math> separately, particularly when\n<math> x \\approx y</math>.

In 1819, it was Horner's paper that got through to publication in the \"Philosophical Transactions\".<ref name=\"Horner\" /> later in the year, Ivory's paper falling by the way, despite Ivory being a Fellow; in 1823, when a total of ten papers were read, fortunes as regards publication, were reversed. But Gilbert, who had strong connections with the West of England and may have had social contact with Horner, resident as Horner was in Bristol and Bath, published his own [http://turing.une.edu.au/~ernie/Horner/Gilbert1823QJSLA.pdf survey] of Horner-type methods earlier in 1823.\n\nHorner's paper in Part II of ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'' for 1819 was warmly and expansively welcomed by a [http://turing.une.edu.au/~ernie/Horner/Horner1820MonthlyRev91-4.pdf reviewer] in the issue of ''The Monthly Review: or, Literary Journal'' for April, 1820; in comparison, a technical paper by [[Charles Babbage]] is dismissed curtly in this review. However, the reviewer noted that another, similar method had also recently been published by the architect and mathematical expositor, Peter Nicholson. This theme is developed in a further [http://turing.une.edu.au/~ernie/Horner/Horner1820MonthlyRev93-12.pdf review] of some of Nicholson's books in the issue of ''The Monthly Review'' for December, 1820, which in turn ends with notice of the appearance of a booklet by Theophilus Holdred, from whom Nicholson acknowledges he obtained the gist of his approach in the first place, although claiming to have improved upon it. The sequence of reviews is concluded in the issue of ''The Monthly Review'' for September, 1821, with the [http://turing.une.edu.au/~ernie/Horner/Horner1821MonthlyRev96-9.pdf reviewer] concluding that whereas Holdred was the first person to discover a direct and general practical solution of numerical equations, he had not reduced it to its simplest form by the time of Horner's publication, and saying that had Holdred published forty years earlier when he first discovered his method, his contribution could be more easily recognized. The reviewer is exceptionally well-informed, even having sighted Horner's preparatory correspondence with [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]] in 1818, seeking work of [[Fran\u00e7ois Budan de Boislaurent|Budan]]. The Bodlean Library, Oxford has the Editor's annotated copy of ''The Monthly Review'' from which it is clear that the most active reviewer in mathematics in 1814 and 1815 (the last years for which this information has been published) was none other than Peter Barlow,one of the foremost specialists on approximation theory of the period, suggesting that it was Barlow, who wrote this sequence of reviews. As it also happened, Henry Atkinson, of Newcastle, devised a similar approximation scheme in 1809; he had consulted his fellow [[Geordie]], [[Charles Hutton]], another specialist and a senior colleague of Barlow at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, only to be advised that, while his work was publishable, it was unlikely to have much impact. J. R. Young, writing in the mid-1830s, concluded that Holdred's first method replicated Atkinson's while his improved method was only added to Holdred's booklet some months after its first appearance in 1820, when Horner's paper was already in circulation.\n\nThe feature of Horner's writing that most distinguishes it from his English contemporaries is the way he draws on the Continental literature, notably the work of [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Arbogast|Arbogast]]. The advocacy, as well as the detraction, of Horner's Method has this as an unspoken subtext. Quite how he gained that familiarity has not been determined. Horner is known to have made a close reading of John Bonneycastle's book on algebra. Bonneycastle recognizes that Arbogast has the general, combinatorial expression for the reversion of series, a project going back at least to Newton. But Bonneycastle's main purpose in mentioning Arbogast is not to praise him, but to observe that Arbogast's notation is incompatible with the approach he adopts. The gap in Horner's reading was the work of [[Paolo Ruffini]], except that, as far as awareness of Ruffini goes, citations of Ruffini's work by authors, including medical authors, in ''Philosophical Transactions'' speak volumes: there are none - Ruffini's [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101013501372?urlappend=%3Bseq=695 name] only appears in 1814, recording a work he donated to the Royal Society. Ruffini might have done better if his work had appeared in French, as had [[Malfatti's problem|Malfatti's Problem]] in the reformulation of [[Gergonne|Joseph Diaz Gergonne]], or had he written in French, as had [[:it:Antonio Cagnoli|Antonio Cagnoli]], a source quoted by Bonneycastle on series reversion (today, Cagnoli is in the Italian Wikipedia, as shown, but has yet to make it into either French or English).\n\nFuller<ref>{{harvnb|Fuller|1999|pages=29\u201351}}.</ref> showed that the method in Horner's 1819 paper differs from what afterwards became known as 'Horner's method' and that in consequence the priority for this method should go to Holdred (1920). This view may be compared with the remarks concerning the works of Horner and Holdred in the previous paragraph. Fuller also takes aim at [[Augustus De Morgan]]. Precocious though Augustus de Morgan was, he was not the reviewer for ''The Monthly Review'', while several others - [[Thomas Stephens Davies]], J. R. Young, Stephen Fenwick, T. T. Wilkinson - wrote Horner firmly into their records, not least Horner himself, as he published extensively up until the year of his death in 1837. His paper in 1819 was one that would have been difficult to miss. In contrast, the only other mathematical sighting of Holdred is a single named contribution to ''The Gentleman's Mathematical Companion'', an answer to a problem.\n\nIt is questionable to what extent it was De Morgan's advocacy of Horner's priority in discovery<ref name=\"Cajori\" /><ref name=\"St Andrews\" /> that led to \"Horner's method\" being so called in textbooks, but it is true that those suggesting this tend themselves to know of Horner largely through intermediaries, of whom De Morgan made himself a prime example. However, this method ''qua'' method was known long before Horner. In reverse chronological order, Horner's method was already known to:\n\n* [[Paolo Ruffini]] in 1809 (see [[Ruffini's rule]])<ref name=\"Cajori\" /><ref name=\"St Andrews\">{{MacTutor Biography|id=Horner}}</ref>\n* [[Isaac Newton]] in 1669 (but precise reference needed)\n* the [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese mathematician]] [[Zhu Shijie]] in the 14th century<ref name=\"St Andrews\" />\n* the [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese mathematician]] [[Qin Jiushao]] in his ''[[Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections]]'' in the 13th century\n* the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]] [[Sharaf al-D\u012bn al-T\u016bs\u012b]] in the 12th century (the first to use that method in a general case of cubic equation)<ref>{{harvnb|Berggren|1990|pages = 304\u2013309}}.</ref>\n* the Chinese mathematician [[Jia Xian]] in the 11th century ([[Song dynasty]])\n* ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'', a Chinese work of the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC &ndash; 220 AD) edited by [[Liu Hui]] (fl. 3rd century).<ref>{{harvnb|Temple|1986|p=142}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, this observation on its own masks significant differences in conception and also, as noted with Ruffini's work, issues of accessibility.\n\n[[Qin Jiushao]], in his ''Shu Shu Jiu Zhang'' (''[[Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections]]''; 1247), presents a portfolio of methods of Horner-type for solving polynomial equations, which was based on earlier works of the 11th century Song dynasty mathematician [[Jia Xian]]; for example, one method is specifically suited to bi-quintics, of which Qin gives an instance, in keeping with the then Chinese custom of case studies. The first person writing in English to note the connection with Horner's method was [[Alexander Wylie (missionary)|Alexander Wylie]], writing in ''The North China Herald'' in 1852; perhaps conflating and misconstruing different Chinese phrases, Wylie calls the method ''Harmoniously Alternating Evolution'' (which does not agree with his Chinese, ''linglong kaifang'', not that at that date he uses [[pinyin]]), working the case of one of Qin's quartics and giving, for comparison, the working with Horner's method. [[Yoshio Mikami]] in ''Development of Mathematics in China and Japan'' published in Leipzig in 1913, gave a detailed description of Qin's method, using the quartic illustrated to the above right in a worked example; he wrote: \"who can deny the fact of Horner's illustrious process being used in China at least nearly six long centuries earlier than in Europe ... We of course don't intend in any way to ascribe Horner's invention to a Chinese origin, but the lapse of time sufficiently makes it not altogether impossible that the Europeans could have known of the Chinese method in a direct or indirect way.\".<ref>{{harvnb|Mikami|1913|p=77}}.</ref> However, as Mikami is also aware, it was ''not altogether impossible'' that a related work, ''Si Yuan Yu Jian'' (''Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns; 1303)'' by [[Zhu Shijie]] might make the shorter journey across to Japan, but seemingly it never did, although another work of Zhu, ''Suan Xue Qi Meng'', had a seminal influence on the development of traditional mathematics in the Edo period, starting in the mid-1600s. [[Ulrich Libbrecht]] (at the time teaching in school, but subsequently a professor of comparative philosophy) gave a detailed description in his doctoral thesis of Qin's method, he concluded: ''It is obvious that this procedure is a Chinese invention....the method was not known in India''. He said, Fibonacci probably learned of it from Arabs, who perhaps borrowed from the Chinese.<ref>{{harvnb|Libbrecht|2005|p=208}}.</ref> Here, the problems is that there is no more evidence for this speculation than there is of the method being known in India. Of course, the extraction of square and cube roots along similar lines is already discussed by [[Liu Hui]] in connection with Problems IV.16 and 22 in ''Jiu Zhang Suan Shu'', while [[Wang Xiaotong]] in the 7th century supposes his readers can solve cubics by an approximation method described in his book [[Jigu Suanjing]].\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Clenshaw algorithm]] to evaluate polynomials in [[Chebyshev form]]\n*[[De Boor's algorithm]] to evaluate [[spline curve|splines]] in [[B-spline]] form\n*[[De Casteljau's algorithm]] to evaluate polynomials in [[B\u00e9zier form]]\n*[[Estrin's scheme]] to facilitate parallelization on modern computer architectures\n*[[Lill's method]] to approximate roots graphically\n*[[Ruffini's rule]] to divide a polynomial by a binomial of the form x \u2212 r\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n*{{cite journal\n | last = Berggren\n | first = J.

They are also effective as [[anxiolytic]]s, hypnotics, and [[anticonvulsalgesic]] effects; however, these effects are somewhat weak, preventing barbiturates from being used in [[surgery]] in the absence of other analgesics.

Practitioners of the hacker ethic acknowledge that sharing information and data responsibly is beneficial and helpful.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker-ethic.html|title=hacker ethic|website=www.catb.org|accessdate=28 February 2017}}</ref> Whilst the philosophy originated at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in the 1950s\u20131960s, the term ''hacker ethic'' is attributed to journalist [[Steven Levy]] as described in his 1984 book titled ''[[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]].'' The key points within this ethic are access, freedom of information, and improvement to quality of life. While some tenets of hacker ethic were described in other texts like ''[[Computer Lib/Dream Machines]]'' (1974) by [[Ted Nelson]], Levy appears to have been the first to document both the philosophy and the founders of the philosophy.\n\n==History==\nLevy explains that MIT housed an early [[IBM 704]] computer inside the Electronic Accounting Machinery (EAM) room in 1959. This room became the staging grounds for early hackers, as MIT students from the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] sneaked inside the EAM room after hours to attempt programming the 30-ton, {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} computer.\n\nThe MIT group defined a ''hack'' as a project undertaken or a product built to fulfill some constructive goal, but also with some wild pleasure taken in mere involvement.<ref>''Hackers''. pg 9</ref> The term ''[[Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|hack]]'' arose from MIT lingo, as the word had long been used to describe college pranks that MIT students would regularly devise.  However, Levy's hacker ethic also has often been quoted out of context and misunderstood to refer to [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking as in breaking into computers]], and so many sources incorrectly imply that it is describing the ideals of [[White hat (computer security)|white-hat hackers]]. However, what Levy is talking about does not necessarily have anything particular to do with computer security, but addresses broader issues.\n\nThe hacker ethic was described as a \"new way of life, with a philosophy, an ethic and a dream\". However, the elements of the hacker ethic were not openly debated and discussed; rather they were implicitly accepted and silently agreed upon.<ref>''Hackers''. pg. 26</ref>\n\nThe [[free software movement]] was born in the early 1980s from followers of the hacker ethic.  Its founder, [[Richard Stallman]], is referred to by Steven Levy as \"the last true hacker\".<ref>See the title and content of the Epilogue to [[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]]</ref>  Modern hackers who hold true to the hacker ethics\u2014especially the Hands-On Imperative\u2014are usually supporters of [[free and open source software]]. This is because free and open source software allows hackers to get access to the [[source code]] used to create the software, to allow it to be improved or reused in other projects.\n\nRichard Stallman describes:\n\n<blockquote>The hacker ethic refers to the feelings of right and wrong, to the ethical ideas this community of people had\u2014that knowledge should be shared with other people who can benefit from it, and that important resources should be utilized rather than wasted.<ref>[http://memex.org/meme2-04.html MEME 2.04] (1996)</ref></blockquote>\n\nand states more precisely that hacking (which Stallman defines as playful cleverness) and ethics are two separate issues:\n\n<blockquote>Just because someone enjoys hacking does not mean he has an ethical commitment to treating other people properly. Some hackers care about ethics\u2014I do, for instance\u2014but that is not part of being a hacker, it is a separate trait. [...] Hacking is not primarily about an ethical issue. <br />[...] hacking tends to lead a significant number of hackers to think about ethical questions in a certain way. I would not want to completely deny all connection between hacking and views on ethics.<ref>[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/rms-hack.html The Hacker Community and Ethics: An Interview with Richard M. Stallman, 2002]</ref></blockquote>\n\n==The hacker ethics==\nAs Levy summarized in the preface of ''Hackers'', the general tenets or principles of hacker ethic include:<ref>''Hackers'', page ix.</ref>\n\n* Sharing\n* Openness\n* Decentralization\n* Free access to computers\n* World Improvement (foremost, upholding democracy and the fundamental laws we all live by, as a society)\n\nIn addition to those principles, Levy also described more specific hacker ethics and beliefs in chapter 2, ''The Hacker Ethic'':<ref>''Hackers'', pages 26\u201336.</ref> The ethics he described in chapter 2 are:\n\n; Access to computers\u2014and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works\u2014should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!: Levy is recounting hackers' abilities to learn and build upon pre-existing ideas and systems. He believes that access gives hackers the opportunity to take things apart, fix, or improve upon them and to learn and understand how they work.

Levy articulates that criteria such as age, sex, race, position, and qualification are deemed irrelevant within the hacker community.<ref name=\"Levy 1984 pp 3\" /> Hacker skill is the ultimate determinant of acceptance. Such a code within the hacker community fosters the advance of hacking and software development. In an example of the hacker ethic of equal opportunity,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gabriellacoleman.org/biella/Coleman-Golub-Hacker-Practice.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720150305/http://gabriellacoleman.org/biella/Coleman-Golub-Hacker-Practice.pdf |archivedate=20 July 2011  }}</ref> [[L Peter Deutsch]], a twelve-year-old hacker, was accepted in the [[TX-0]] community, though he was not recognized by non-hacker graduate students.\n; You can create art and beauty on a computer: Hackers deeply appreciate innovative techniques which allow programs to perform complicated tasks with few instructions.<ref>''Hackers''. pg 31</ref> A program's code was considered to hold a beauty of its own, having been carefully composed and artfully arranged.<ref>''Hackers''. pg 30\u201331</ref> Learning to create programs which used the least amount of space almost became a game between the early hackers.<ref name=\"Levy 1984 pp 3\">''Hackers'', pp 3\u201336</ref>\n; Computers can change your life for the better: Hackers felt that computers had enriched their lives, given their lives focus, and made their lives adventurous.

The hacker's primary object was to teach society that \"the world opened up by the computer was a limitless one\" (Levy 230:1984)<ref name=\"Levy 1984 pp 3\"/>\n\n===Sharing===\nFrom the early days of modern computing through to the 1970s, it was far more common for computer users to have the freedoms that are provided by an ethic of open sharing and collaboration. Software, including source code, was commonly shared by individuals who used computers. Most companies had a business model based on hardware sales, and provided or bundled the associated software free of charge. According to Levy's account, sharing was the norm and expected within the non-corporate hacker culture. The principle of sharing stemmed from the open atmosphere and informal access to resources at MIT. During the early days of computers and programming, the hackers at MIT would develop a program and share it with other computer users.\n\nIf the hack was deemed particularly good, then the program might be posted on a board somewhere near one of the computers. Other programs that could be built upon it and improved it were saved to tapes and added to a drawer of programs, readily accessible to all the other hackers. At any time, a fellow hacker might reach into the drawer, pick out the program, and begin adding to it or \"bumming\" it to make it better. Bumming referred to the process of making the code more concise so that more can be done in fewer instructions, saving precious memory for further enhancements.\n\nIn the second generation of hackers, sharing was about sharing with the general public in addition to sharing with other hackers. A particular organization of hackers that was concerned with sharing computers with the general public was a group called [[Community Memory]]. This group of hackers and idealists put computers in public places for anyone to use. The first community computer was placed outside of Leopold's Records in [[Berkeley, California]].\n\nAnother sharing of resources occurred when Bob Albrecht provided considerable resources for a non-profit organization called the [[People's Computer Company]] (PCC). PCC opened a computer center where anyone could use the computers there for fifty cents per hour.\n\nThis second generation practice of sharing contributed to the battles of free and open software. In fact, when [[Bill Gates]]' version of [[BASIC]] for the Altair was shared among the hacker community, Gates claimed to have lost a considerable sum of money because few users paid for the software. As a result, Gates wrote an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]].<ref>{{cite book | title = We-Think | author = Charles Leadbetter | publisher = Profile Books | year = 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | publisher = Metro | date = 12 March 2008 | author = Fiona Macdonald | title = Get a fair share of creativity }}</ref> This letter was published by several computer magazines and newsletters, most notably that of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] where much of the sharing occurred.\n\n===Hands-On Imperative===\nMany of the principles and tenets of hacker ethic contribute to a common goal: the Hands-On Imperative. As Levy described in Chapter 2, \"Hackers believe that essential lessons can be learned about the systems\u2014about the world\u2014from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge to create new and more interesting things.\"<ref>''Hackers'', pages 27\u201336.</ref>\n\nEmploying the Hands-On Imperative requires free access, open information, and the sharing of knowledge. To a true hacker, if the Hands-On Imperative is restricted, then the ends justify the means to make it unrestricted ''so that improvements can be made''. When these principles are not present, hackers tend to work around them. For example, when the computers at MIT were protected either by physical locks or login programs, the hackers there systematically worked around them in order to have access to the machines. Hackers assumed a \"willful blindness\" in the pursuit of perfection.<ref name=\"Hackerspg\" />\n\nThis behavior was not malicious in nature: the MIT hackers did not seek to harm the systems or their users. This deeply contrasts with the modern, media-encouraged image of [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] who crack secure systems in order to steal information or complete an act of cyber-vandalism.\n\n===Community and collaboration===\nThroughout writings about hackers and their work processes, a common value of community and collaboration is present. For example, in Levy's ''Hackers'', each generation of hackers had geographically based communities where collaboration and sharing occurred. For the hackers at MIT, it was the labs where the computers were running. For the hardware hackers (second generation) and the game hackers (third generation) the geographic area was centered in [[Silicon Valley]] where the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] and the [[People's Computer Company]] helped hackers network, collaborate, and share their work.\n\nThe concept of community and collaboration is still relevant today, although hackers are no longer limited to collaboration in geographic regions. Now collaboration takes place via the [[Internet]]. [[Eric S. Raymond]] identifies and explains this conceptual shift in ''[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]'':<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s11.html |title=The Social Context of Open-Source Software |publisher=Catb.org |date= |accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Before cheap Internet, there were some geographically compact communities where the culture encouraged Weinberg's egoless programming, and a developer could easily attract a lot of skilled kibitzers and co-developers. Bell Labs, the MIT AI and LCS labs, UC Berkeley: these became the home of innovations that are legendary and still potent.</blockquote>\n\nRaymond also notes that the success of Linux coincided with the wide availability of the [[World Wide Web]]. The value of community is still in high practice and use today.\n\n==Levy's \"true hackers\"==\n{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nLevy identifies several \"true hackers\" who significantly influenced the hacker ethic. Some well-known \"true hackers\" include:\n\n* [[Bill Gosper]]: Mathematician and hacker\n* [[Richard Greenblatt (programmer)|Richard Greenblatt]]: Programmer and early designer of [[Lisp machine|LISP machines]]\n* [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]]: Co-founder of the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab]] and [[Stanford AI Laboratory]]\n* [[Jude Milhon]]: Founder of the [[cypherpunk]] movement, senior editor at ''[[Mondo 2000]]'', and co-founder of [[Community Memory]]\n* [[Richard Stallman]]: Programmer and political activist who is well known for [[GNU]], [[Emacs]] and the [[Free Software Movement]]\n\nLevy also identified the \"hardware hackers\" (the \"second generation\", mostly centered in [[Silicon Valley]]) and the \"game hackers\" (or the \"third generation\"). All three generations of hackers, according to Levy, embodied the principles of the hacker ethic. Some of Levy's \"second-generation\" hackers include:\n\n* [[Steve Dompier]]: Homebrew Computer Club member and hacker who worked with the early [[Altair 8800]]\n* [[John Draper]]: A legendary figure in the computer programming world. He wrote [[EasyWriter]], the first word processor.\n* [[Lee Felsenstein]]: A hardware hacker and co-founder of [[Community Memory]] and Homebrew Computer Club; a designer of the [[Sol-20]] computer\n* [[Bob Marsh]]: A designer of the [[Sol-20]] computer\n* [[Fred Moore (activist)|Fred Moore]]: Activist and founder of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]]\n* [[Steve Wozniak]]: One of the founders of [[Apple Computer]]\n\nLevy's \"third generation\" practitioners of hacker ethic include:\n\n* John Harris: One of the first programmers hired at On-Line Systems (which later became [[Sierra Entertainment]])\n* [[Ken Williams (gaming)|Ken Williams]]: Along with wife [[Roberta Williams|Roberta]], founded On-Line Systems after working at IBM \u2013 the company would later achieve mainstream popularity as [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]]\n\n== Teaching Ethical Hacking ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn this digital age, and due to our reliance on technology, hackers are able to gather more information on us than before. One way to combat this is to teach students to hack in such a way that they become what are called ''white hat hackers''. White hat hackers follow ethical guidelines that proscribe harming either other people or the systems on which other people depend. Through their efforts, they have the ability to prevent malicious attacks. The movement of ethical hacking has gained traction through different programs such as the [[L0pht]] and GhettoHackers, and courses have become integrated into university- and college-level curriculum.\n\n===Discourage Black Hat Hacking===\n\nSecurity researcher and an application security engineer Joe Gervais pointed out that students who are intellectually curious enough may start to experiment with computers without thinking of the ethical repercussions of their actions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/cyber-security/hacker-high-why-we-need-to-teach-hacking-in-schools/|title= Hacker High: Why We Need To Teach Hacking in Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate= 28 April 2017}}</ref> He points out that there are a lot of classes that exist for more gifted students in areas such as math, reading, etc. However, there doesn\u2019t seem to be courses that can address the curiosity that a young hacker may have.\n\nHacking courses can create a moral compass for young hackers. They require a constructive environment that allows them to satiate their desire to understand computers. Students in these classes have the ability to learn what they are passionate about while also understanding the ethical boundaries that should not be encroached upon. However, the integral part of the curriculum would be to prevent the development of black hat hackers.\n\n===Encourage White Hat Hacking===\n\nThere seems to be a lack of skilled cyber security experts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/09/30/cybersecurity-defense-hampered-by-lack-of-white-hat-hacker-talent/|title= Cybersecurity Defense Hampered by Lack of \u2018White Hat\u2019 Hacker Talent| last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate= 28 April 2017}}</ref> Moreover, there doesn\u2019t seem to be sufficient curriculum to teach individuals the skills required to protect systems against malicious action.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/04/11/universities-arent-doing-enough-to-train-the-cyberdefenders-america-desperately-needs/?utm_term=.19fcc8ee64b9|title=Universities aren\u2019t doing enough to train the cyberdefenders America desperately needs|last=Peterson|first=Andrea|date=11 April 2016|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=28 October 2018}}</ref> Teaching ethical hacking is a plausible way to fill the gap in the supply of technically skilled people; capable of successfully implementing defensive mechanisms to overcome real world threats. Ymir Vigfusson, professor at the School of Computer Science at Reykjavik University and assistant professor in Emory University\u2019s Math and Science Department, is a major advocate in favor of educating students about hacking. Ymir points out that teaching hacking can be a way for students to better understand computer security. He believes that hackers have a unique mindset wherein they are constantly thinking about how they can break through security controls. However, defenders, the ones tasked with actually protecting a network are only thinking of ways to keep people out. What hackers can contribute is in their mindset and perspective. This shared mindset and knowledge allows defenders to realize otherwise unseen weak points in security systems and to reinforce them. In 2012, Ymir held a talk at  TEDxRekjavijk titled \"Why I Teach People to Hack\" that further illustrates his reasons for supporting the teaching of ethical hacking.<ref>{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Why I teach people how to hack {{!}} \u00ddmir Vigf\u00fasson {{!}} TEDxReykjav\u00edk|date=4 July 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwJyKmCbOws|accessdate=29 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Other descriptions==\nIn 2001, [[Finland|Finnish]] philosopher [[Pekka Himanen]] promoted the hacker ethic in opposition to the [[Protestant work ethic]]. In Himanen's opinion, the hacker ethic is more closely related to the [[virtue ethics]] found in the writings of [[Plato]] and of [[Aristotle]]. Himanen explained these ideas in a book, ''[[The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of the Information Age]]'', with a prologue contributed by [[Linus Torvalds]] and an epilogue by [[Manuel Castells]].\n\nIn this manifesto, the authors wrote about a hacker ethic centering on passion, hard work, creativity and joy in creating software. Both Himanen and Torvalds were inspired by the [[Sampo]] in [[Finnish mythology]]. The Sampo, described in the [[Kalevala]] saga, was a magical artifact constructed by [[Ilmarinen]], the blacksmith god, that brought good fortune to its holder; nobody knows exactly what it was supposed to be. The Sampo has been interpreted in many ways: a [[Axis mundi|world pillar]] or [[world tree]], a [[compass]] or [[astrolabe]], a chest containing a treasure, a [[Byzantine]] [[coin die]], a decorated [[Vendel]] period shield, a Christian relic, etc. Kalevala saga compiler L\u00f6nnrot interpreted it to be a \"[[Quern-stone|quern]]\" or mill of some sort that made flour, salt, and gold out of thin air.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nThe hacker ethic and its wider context can be associated with [[liberalism]] and [[anarchism]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coleman|first=E.

Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flat screen television, and [[En-suite|en-suite bathroom]]s. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers, and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa, and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually [[Room number|numbered]] (or named in some smaller hotels and [[Bed and breakfast|B&Bs]]) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} In Japan, [[capsule hotel]]s provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.\n[[File:The Peninsula Paris.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|[[The Peninsula Paris]] hotel]]The precursor to the modern hotel was the [[inn]] of [[medieval Europe]]. For a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century, [[coaching inn]]s served as a place for lodging for [[coach (carriage)|coach]] travelers. Inns began to cater to richer clients in the mid-18th century. One of the first hotels in a modern sense was opened in [[Exeter]] in 1768. Hotels proliferated throughout [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]] in the early 19th century, and luxury hotels began to spring up in the later part of the 19th century.\n\nHotel operations vary in size, function, complexity, and cost. Most hotels and major hospitality companies have set industry standards to classify hotel types. An upscale full-service hotel facility offers [[Luxury goods|luxury]] amenities, full service accommodations, an on-site [[restaurant]], and the highest level of personalized service, such as a [[concierge]], [[room service]], and clothes pressing staff. [[Conference and resort hotels|Full service hotels]] often contain upscale full-service facilities with a large number of full service accommodations, an on-site full service [[restaurant]], and a variety of on-site [[Amenity|amenities]]. [[Boutique hotel]]s are smaller independent, non-branded hotels that often contain upscale facilities. Small to medium-sized hotel establishments offer a limited amount of on-site [[Amenity|amenities]]. Economy hotels are small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer basic accommodations with little to no services. [[Extended stay hotel]]s are small to medium-sized hotels that offer longer-term full service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel.\n\n[[Timeshare]] and [[destination clubs]] are a form of property ownership involving ownership of an individual unit of accommodation for seasonal usage. A [[motel]] is a small-sized low-rise lodging with direct access to individual rooms from the car park. [[Boutique hotel]]s are typically hotels with a unique environment or intimate setting. A number of hotels have entered the public consciousness through popular culture, such as the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] in [[London]]. Some hotels are built specifically as a destination in itself, for example at [[casino]]s and holiday [[resort]]s.\n\nMost hotel establishments are run by a [[General Manager]] who serves as the head executive (often referred to as the \"[[Hotel Manager]]\"), department heads who oversee various departments within a hotel (e.g., food service), [[middle manager]]s, [[Administration of business|administrative]] staff, and line-level supervisors. The organizational chart and volume of job positions and hierarchy varies by hotel size, function and class, and is often determined by hotel ownership and managing companies.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''hotel'' is derived from the [[French language|French]] ''h\u00f4tel'' (coming from the same origin as ''[[hospital]]''), which referred to a French version of a building seeing frequent visitors, and providing care, rather than a place offering accommodation. In contemporary French usage, ''h\u00f4tel'' now has the same meaning as the English term, and ''[[h\u00f4tel particulier]]'' is used for the old meaning, as well as \"h\u00f4tel\" in some place names such as [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Paris|H\u00f4tel-Dieu]] (in Paris), which has been a hospital since the [[Middle Ages]]. The French spelling, with the [[circumflex]], was also used in English, but is now rare. The circumflex replaces the 's' found in the earlier ''[[hostel]]'' spelling, which over time took on a new, but closely related meaning. Grammatically, hotels usually take the [[definite article]] \u2013 hence \"The Astoria Hotel\" or simply \"The Astoria.\"\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tabard inn mid19th.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Tabard Inn, [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark, London]]]]\nFacilities offering hospitality to travellers have been a feature of the earliest civilizations. In [[Greco-Roman culture]] and [[ancient Persia]], hospitals for recuperation and rest were built at [[thermal bath]]s. Japan's [[Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan]], founded in 705, was officially recognised by the [[Guinness World Records]] as the oldest hotel in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Oldest hotel|url = http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-hotel|accessdate = 2015-04-04|publisher = Guinness World Records}}</ref> During the [[Middle Ages]], various religious orders at [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[abbey]]s would offer accommodation for travellers on the road.\n\nThe precursor to the modern hotel was the [[inn]] of [[medieval Europe]], possibly dating back to the rule of [[Ancient Rome]]. These would provide for the needs of travellers, including food and lodging, [[Stable|stabling]] and [[fodder]] for the traveller's horse(s) and fresh horses for the [[mail coach]]. Famous London examples of inns include the [[The George, Southwark|George]] and the [[The Tabard|Tabard]]. A typical layout of an inn had an inner court with bedrooms on the two sides, with the [[kitchen]] and [[parlour]] at the front and the stables at the back.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4017990.html|title=Hotels: A Brief History |accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\nFor a period of about 200 years from the mid-17th century, [[coaching inn]]s served as a place for lodging for [[coach (carriage)|coach]] travellers (in other words, a [[roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]]). Coaching [[inn]]s stabled teams of [[horse]]s for [[stagecoach]]es and [[mail coach]]es and replaced tired teams with fresh teams. Traditionally they were seven miles apart, but this depended very much on the terrain.\n\n[[File:TremontHouse ca1830s byJamesBennett Boston SimonsUPNE.png|thumb|right|[[Tremont House (Boston)|Tremont House]] in [[Boston]], United States, a luxury hotel, the first to provide indoor plumbing]]\nSome [[England|English]] towns had as many as ten such [[inn]]s and rivalry between them was intense, not only for the income from the stagecoach operators but for the revenue for food and drink supplied to the wealthy passengers. By the end of the century, coaching inns were being run more professionally, with a regular timetable being followed and fixed menus for food.<ref>Coaching Era, The: ''Stage and Mail Coach Travel in and Around Bath, Bristol and Somerset'', Roy Gallop, Fiducia  (2003), {{ISBN|1-85026-019-2}}</ref>\n\nInns began to cater for richer clients in the mid-18th century, and consequently grew in grandeur and the level of service provided. One of the first hotels in a modern sense was [[Royal Clarence Hotel|opened]] in [[Exeter]] in 1768, although the idea only really caught on in the early 19th century. In 1812 [[Claridge's|Mivart's Hotel]] opened its doors in [[London]], later changing its name to Claridge's.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buildinghistory.org/buildings/inns.shtml|title=Researching the history of pubs, inns and hotels|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\nHotels proliferated throughout [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]] in the 19th century, and luxury hotels, including the [[Savoy Hotel]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[C\u00e9sar Ritz|Ritz chain of hotels]] in [[London]] and [[Paris]] and [[Tremont House (Boston)|Tremont House]] and [[Astor House]] in the [[United States]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles25/hotels-12.shtml |title=Nineteenth Century Hotels In The United States|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref> began to spring up in the later part of the century, catering to an extremely wealthy clientele.\n\n==International scale==\nHotels cater to travelers from many countries and languages, since no one country dominates the travel industry.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Most hotels and major hospitality companies that operate hotels have set widely accepted industry standards to classify hotel types. General categories include the following:\n\n==={{anchor|Luxury}}Luxury===\nA luxury hotel offers high quality amenities, full service accommodations, on-site full-service restaurants, and the highest level of personalized and professional service. Luxury hotels are normally classified with at least a [[AAA Five Diamond Award|Five Diamond]] rating by American Automobile Association or [[Star (classification)|Five Star]] [[hotel rating]] depending on the country and local classification standards. ''Examples include: [[InterContinental Hotels & Resorts|InterContinental]], [[Jumeirah (hotel chain)|Jumeirah]], [[Conrad Hotels|Conrad]], [[Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group|Mandarin Oriental]], [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts|Four Seasons]], [[The Peninsula Hotels|The Peninsula]], [[Grand Hyatt]], [[JW Marriott Hotels|JW Marriott]], [[The Ritz-Carlton]] And [[Jaypee Group]].''\n\n==={{anchor|Boutique}}Boutique and lifestyle hotels===\n[[Boutique hotel]]s are smaller independent non-branded hotels that often contain upscale facilities of varying size in unique or intimate settings with full service accommodations. These hotels are generally 100 rooms or fewer.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.hvs.com/Content/3171.pdf|title = Boutique Hotels Segment|last = Balekjian|first = Cristina|date = September 2011|journal = HVS|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> Lifestyle hotels are branded properties that appeal to a guest with specific lifestyle or personal image. They are typically full-service and sometimes classified as luxury. A key characteristic of boutique and lifestyle hotels is their focus on providing a unique guest experience as opposed to simply providing lodging. Examples include [[W Hotels]], [[Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts|Shangri-La Hotels]], [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]], [[Andaz (hotel)|Andaz]], [[Hoshino Resorts]] and [[Banyan Tree Holdings|Banyan Tree]].\n\n==={{anchor|Full}}Full-service===\n[[Conference and resort hotels|Full service hotels]] often provide a wide array of guest services and on-site facilities. Commonly found amenities may include: on-site food and beverage (room service and restaurants), meeting and conference services and facilities, fitness center, and business center. Full-service hotels range in quality from mid-scale to luxury.  This classification is based upon the quality of facilities and amenities offered by the hotel. <ref>{{Cite web|title = Full-Service Vs. Limited-Service Hotels|url = http://traveltips.usatoday.com/fullservice-vs-limitedservice-hotels-106136.html|website = Travel Tips - USA Today|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref> Examples include: [[Holiday Inn]], [[Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants|Kimpton Hotels]], [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts|Hilton]], [[Marriott International|Marriott]] and [[Hyatt Regency]] brands.\n\n==={{anchor|Focused}}Focused or select service===\nSmall to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer a limited number of on-site amenities that only cater and market to a specific demographic of travelers, such as the single business traveler. Most focused or select service hotels may still offer full service accommodations but may lack leisure amenities such as an on-site restaurant or a swimming pool. Examples include [[Hyatt Place]], [[Courtyard by Marriott]] and [[Hilton Garden Inn]].\n\n==={{anchor|Economy}}Economy and limited service===\nSmall to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer a very limited number of on-site amenities and often only offer basic accommodations with little to no services, these facilities normally only cater and market to a specific demographic of travelers, such as the budget-minded traveler seeking a \"no frills\" accommodation. Limited service hotels often lack an on-site restaurant but in return may offer a limited complimentary food and beverage amenity such as on-site continental breakfast service.  Examples include [[Ibis Budget]], [[Hampton Inn]], [[Aloft Hotels|Aloft]], [[Holiday Inn Express]], [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inn]], [[Four Points by Sheraton]].\n\n==={{anchor|Extended}}Extended stay===\n[[Extended stay hotel]]s are small to medium-sized hotels that offer longer term full service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel. Extended stay hotels may offer non-traditional pricing methods such as a weekly rate that caters towards travelers in need of short-term accommodations for an extended period of time. Similar to limited and select service hotels, on-site amenities are normally limited and most extended stay hotels lack an on-site restaurant. Examples include [[Staybridge Suites]], [[Candlewood Suites]], [[Homewood Suites by Hilton]], [[Home2 Suites by Hilton]], [[Residence Inn by Marriott]], [[Element by Westin|Element]], and [[Extended Stay America]].\n\n==={{anchor|Timeshare}}Timeshare and destination clubs===\n[[Timeshare]] and [[Destination clubs]] are a form of property ownership also referred to as a vacation ownership involving the purchase and ownership of an individual unit of accommodation for seasonal usage during a specified period of time. Timeshare resorts often offer amenities similar that of a Full service hotel with on-site restaurant(s), swimming pools, recreation grounds, and other leisure-oriented amenities. Destination clubs on the other hand may offer more exclusive private accommodations such as private houses in a neighborhood-style setting. Examples of timeshare brands include [[Hilton Grand Vacations]], [[Marriott Vacation Club International]], [[Westgate Resorts]], [[Disney Vacation Club]], and [[Holiday Inn|Holiday Inn Club Vacations]].\n\n==={{anchor|Motel}}Motel===\nA [[motel]], an abbreviation for \"motor hotel\", is a small-sized low-rise lodging establishment similar to a limited service, lower-cost hotel, but typically with direct access to individual rooms from the car park. Motels were built to serve road travellers, including travellers on road trip vacations and workers who drive for their job (travelling salespeople, truck drivers, etc.). Common during the 1950s and 1960s, motels were often located adjacent to a major highway, where they were built on inexpensive land at the edge of towns or along stretches of freeway.\n\nNew motel construction is rare in the 2000s as hotel chains have been building economy-priced, limited service franchised properties at freeway exits which compete for largely the same clientele, largely saturating the market by the 1990s. Motels are still useful in less populated areas for driving travelers, but the more populated an area becomes, the more hotels move in to meet the demand for accommodation. While many motels are unbranded and independent, many of the other motels which remain in operation joined national franchise chains, often rebranding themselves as hotels, inns or lodges.  Some examples of chains with motels include [[EconoLodge]], [[Motel 6]], [[Super 8 Motels|Super 8]], and [[Travelodge]].\n\n==={{anchor|Microstay}}Microstay===\nHotels may offer rooms for [[Microstay|microstays]],<ref>{{cite news|title=By-the-Hour Microstays Add to Big Hotels\u2019 Bottom Line|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/business/a-room-by-the-hour-to-refresh.html|accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref> a type of booking for less than 24 hours where the customer chooses the check in time and the length of the stay.

Degree programs such as [[hospitality management studies]], a [[business degree]], and/or certification programs formally prepare hotel managers for industry practice.\n\nMost hotel establishments consist of a [[General Manager]] who serves as the head executive (often referred to as the \"Hotel Manager\"), department heads who oversee various departments within a hotel, [[middle manager]]s, [[Administration of business|administrative]] staff, and line-level supervisors. The organizational chart and volume of job positions and hierarchy varies by hotel size, function, and is often determined by hotel ownership and managing companies.\n\n=={{anchor|Unique}}Unique and specialty hotels==\n\n=== {{anchor|Historic}} Historic inns and boutique hotels ===\n[[File:Hotel Astoria.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hotel Astoria (Saint Petersburg)|Hotel Astoria]] and statue of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia]]\n[[Boutique hotel]]s are typically hotels with a unique environment or intimate setting.\nSome hotels have gained their renown through tradition, by hosting significant events or persons, such as Schloss [[Cecilienhof]] in [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]], which derives its fame from the [[Potsdam Conference]] of the [[World War II]] allies [[Winston Churchill]], [[Harry Truman]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1945.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Schloss Cecilienhof - Cecilienhof Palace|url = http://www.potsdam.de/node/276259|website = Landeshauptstadt Potsdam|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref> The [[Taj Mahal Palace & Tower]] in [[Mumbai]] is one of India's most famous and historic hotels because of its association with the [[Indian independence movement]].

Others have achieved fame by association with dishes or cocktails created on their premises, such as the [[Hotel de Paris]] where the [[cr\u00eape Suzette]] was invented or the [[Raffles Hotel]] in [[Singapore]], where the [[Singapore Sling]] cocktail was devised.<ref>{{cite news | first=Colin | last=Campbell | title=Singapore Journal; Back to Somerset Maugham and Life's Seamy Side |\nurl=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/12/travel/singapore-sling-is-spoken-here.html | location = Singapore| newspaper=The New York Times | date=12 December 1982}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hotel Ritz Paris.jpg|thumb|right|[[H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris]] in [[France]]]]\n\nA number of hotels have entered the public consciousness through popular culture, such as the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] in [[London]], through its association with [[Irving Berlin|Irving Berlin's]] song, '[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]'. The [[Algonquin Hotel]] in New York City is famed as the meeting place of the literary group, the [[Algonquin Round Table]], and [[Hotel Chelsea]], also in New York City, has been the subject of a number of songs and the scene of the stabbing of [[Nancy Spungen]] (allegedly by her boyfriend [[Sid Vicious]]).\n\n==={{anchor|Resort}}Resort hotels===\n[[File:Wynn 2 (2).jpg|thumb|right|[[Wynn Las Vegas]], United States]]\nSome hotels are built specifically as a destination in itself to create a captive trade, example at [[casino]]s, [[amusement park]]s and holiday [[resort]]s. Though hotels have always been built in popular destinations, the defining characteristic of a resort hotel is that it exists purely to serve another attraction, the two having the same owners.\n\nOn the [[Las Vegas Strip]] there is a tradition of [[one-upmanship]] with luxurious and extravagant hotels in a concentrated area. This trend now has extended to other resorts worldwide, but the concentration in Las Vegas is still the world's highest: nineteen of the world's twenty-five largest hotels by room count are on the Strip, with a total of over 67,000 rooms.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vegastodayandtomorrow.com/largesthotels.htm |title=The 25 Largest Hotels in the World|accessdate=18 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn Europe [[Center Parcs]] might be considered a chain of resort hotels, since the sites are largely man-made (though set in natural surroundings such as [[country park]]s) with captive trade, whereas [[holiday camp]]s such as [[Butlins]] and [[Pontin's]] are probably not considered as resort hotels, since they are set at traditional holiday destinations which existed before the camps.\n\n===Other speciality hotels===\n\n[[File:HMSQueenMary photo D Ramey Logan.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[RMS Queen Mary]], Long Beach, California, United States]]\n* The [[Burj al-Arab]] hotel in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]], built on an artificial island, is structured in the shape of a boat's sail.\n*The [[Library Hotel]] in New York City, is unique in that each of its ten floors is assigned one category from the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]].\n* The Jailhotel L\u00f6wengraben in [[Lucerne, Switzerland]] is a converted prison now used as a hotel.\n* The [[Luxor (hotel)|Luxor]], a hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip in [[Paradise, Nevada]], United States is unusual due to its pyramidal structure.\n* The [[Liberty Hotel]] in [[Boston]] used to be the [[Charles Street Jail]].\n* Hotel Kakslauttanen in [[Finland]], a collection of glass igloos in Lapland that allow you to watch the Northern Lights<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://qosy.co/most-luxurious-hotels-retreats/|title=101 Most Luxurious Hotels and Retreats in the World|accessdate=2014-04-16}}</ref>\n* Built in [[Scotland]] and completed in 1936, The former [[ocean liner]] {{RMS|Queen Mary}} in [[Long Beach, California]], United States uses its first-class staterooms as a hotel, after retiring in 1967 from Transatlantic service.\n* The [[Wigwam Motel]]s used patented [[novelty architecture]] in which each motel room was a free-standing concrete wigwam or teepee.\n* Various [[caboose|Caboose Motel]] or Red Caboose Inn properties are built from decommissioned rail cars.\n*Throughout the world there are several hotels built from converted airliners.\n\n===Bunker hotels===\nThe [[Null Stern Hotel]] in [[Teufen AR|Teufen]], [[Appenzellerland]], [[Switzerland]] and the Concrete Mushrooms in [[Albania]]<ref>{{cite news |author=Doug McKinlay |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2009/sep/13/nuclear-bunker-hotel-null-stern-switzerland |title=Switzerland's Null Stern Hotel: the nuclear option &#124; Travel &#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= 2009-09-13|accessdate=2011-01-02 |location=London}}</ref>  are former nuclear [[bunker]]s transformed into hotels.\n\n===Cave hotels===\nThe Cuevas Pedro Antonio de Alarc\u00f3n (named after the [[Pedro Antonio de Alarc\u00f3n|author]]) in [[Guadix]], Spain, as well as several hotels in [[Cappadocia]], Turkey, are notable for being built into natural cave formations, some with rooms underground.

born 1 August 1929 \u2013 27 December 1979) was an Afghan [[communist]] [[politician]] during the [[Cold War]]. Amin was born in [[Paghman]] and educated at [[Kabul University]], after which he started his career as a teacher. After a few years in that occupation, he went to the United States to study. He would visit the United States a second time before moving permanently to Afghanistan, and starting his career in radical politics. He ran as a candidate in the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 1965|1965 parliamentary election]] but failed to secure a seat. Amin was the only [[Khalq]]ist elected to parliament in the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 1969|1969 parliamentary election]], thus increasing his standing within the party. He was one of the leading organisers of the [[Saur Revolution]] which overthrew the government of [[Mohammad Daoud Khan]].\n\nAmin's short-lived presidency was marked by controversies from beginning to end. He came to power by disposing of his predecessor [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] and later ordering his death. Amin made attempts to win support from those who revolted against the communist regime which had begun under Taraki, but his government was unable to solve this problem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afghanland.com/history/communist.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129191129/http://www.afghanland.com/history/communist.html |archivedate=2017-01-29 |df= }}</ref> Many Afghans held Amin responsible for the regime's harshest measures,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/frd/cs/afghanistan/afghanistan.html|title=Library of Congress / Federal Research Division / Country Studies / Area Handbook Series / Afghanistan|website=www.country-data.com}}</ref> such as ordering thousands of executions.<ref>''Conflict in Afghanistan: A Historical Encyclopedia'' by Frank Clements</ref> The [[Soviet Union]], which was dissatisfied with Amin and also alleged that he could be an agent of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|intervened in Afghanistan]] while invoking the Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. Amin was assassinated by the Soviets on December 27, 1979 as part of [[Operation Storm-333]], having ruled for slightly longer than three months.\n\n==Early life and career==\nHafizullah Amin was born to a [[Ghilzai]] [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] family in [[Paghman]]{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA80 80]}} on 1 August 1929.{{sfn|Jessup|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hP7jJAkTd9MC&pg=PA20 20]}} His father, a civil servant, died when he was still very young. Thanks to his brother Abdullah, a primary school teacher, Amin was able to attend both [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]], which in turn allowed him to attend [[Kabul University]] (KU). After studying mathematics there, he also graduated from the [[Darul Mualimeen Teachers College]] in Kabul, and became a teacher. Amin later became vice-principal of the Darul Mualimeen College, and then principal of the prestigious [[Avesina High School]], and in 1957 left Afghanistan for [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]], where he earned [[Master of Arts|M. A.]] in education.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA80 80]}} It was at Columbia that Amin became attracted to [[Marxism]], and in 1958 he became a member of the university's [[Socialist Progressive Club]].{{sfn|Misdaq|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zvm9dxavH-IC&pg=PA110 110]}} When he returned to Afghanistan, Amin became a teacher at Kabul University, and later, for the second time, the principal of Avesina High School.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA80 80\u201381]}} During this period Amin became acquainted with [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]], a [[communism|communist]]. Around this time, Amin quit his position as principal of Avesina High School in order to become principal of the Darul Mualimeen College.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA81 81]}}\n\nIt is alleged that Amin became radicalised during his second stay in the United States in 1962, when he enrolled in a work-study group at the [[University of Wisconsin]]. Amin studied in the doctoral programme at the [[Columbia University Teachers College]], but started to neglect his studies in favour of politics; in 1963 he became head of the Afghan students' association at the college. When he returned to Afghanistan in the mid-1960s, the route flew to Afghanistan by way of Moscow. There, Amin met the Afghan ambassador to the Soviet Union, his old friend [[Ali Ahmad Popel]], a previous Afghan [[Ministry of Education (Afghanistan)|Minister of Education]]. During his short stay, Amin became even more radicalised.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA81 81]}} Some people, Nabi Misdaq for instance, do not believe he travelled through Moscow, but rather [[West Germany]] and [[Lebanon]].{{sfn|Misdaq|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zvm9dxavH-IC&pg=PA110 110]}} By the time he had returned to Afghanistan, the Communist [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) had already held its founding congress, which was in 1965. Amin ran as a candidate for the PDPA in the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 1965|1965 parliamentary election]], and lost by a margin of less than fifty votes.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA81 81]}}\n\nIn 1966, when the [[Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA Central Committee]] was expanded, Amin was elected as a non-voting member, and in the spring of 1967 he gained full membership. Amin's standing in the [[Khalq]] faction of the PDPA increased when he was the only Khalqist elected to parliament in the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 1969|1969 parliamentary election]].{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA81 81]}} When the PDPA split along factional lines in 1967, between Khalqists led by Nur and [[Parcham]]ites led by [[Babrak Karmal]], Amin joined the Khalqists. As a member of parliament, Amin tried to win over support from the Pashtun people in the armed forces.{{sfn|Saikal|Farhadi|Nourzhanov|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MuF55mSIt4EC&pg=PA163 163]}} According to a biography about Amin, he used his position as member of parliament to fight against [[imperialism]], [[feudalism]], and [[Reactionary|reactionary tendencies]], and fought against the \"rotten\" regime, the [[Kingdom of Afghanistan|monarchy]]. Amin himself said that he used his membership in parliament to pursue the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]].{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA48 48]}} Relations between Khalqists and Parchamites deteriorated during this period. Amin, the only Khalq member of parliament, and [[Babrak Karmal]], the only Parcham member of parliament, did not cooperate with each other. Amin would later, during his short stint in power, mention these events with bitterness.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA49 49]}} Following the arrest of fellow PDPA members [[Dastagir Panjsheri]] and [[Saleh Mohammad Zeary]] in 1969, Amin became one of the party's leading members,{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA53 53]}} and was still a pre-eminent party member by the time of their release in 1973.{{sfn|Male|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA53 53\u201354]}}\n\n===The Daoud era===\nFrom 1973 until the PDPA unification in 1977, Amin was second only to Taraki in the Khalqist PDPA. When the PDPA ruled Afghanistan, their relationship was referred to as a disciple (Amin) following his mentor (Taraki). This official portrayal of the situation was misleading; their relationship was more work-oriented. Taraki needed Amin's \"tactical and strategic talents\"; Amin's motivations are more uncertain, but it is commonly believed that he associated with Taraki to protect his own position. Amin had attracted many enemies during his career, the most notable being Karmal. According to the official version of events, Taraki protected Amin from party members or others who wanted to hurt the PDPA and the country.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA54 54]}}\n\nWhen [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] ousted the monarchy, and established the [[Republic of Afghanistan]], the Khalqist PDPA offered its support for the new regime if it established a National Front which presumably included the Khalqist PDPA itself. The Parchamite PDPA had already established an alliance with Daoud at the beginning of his regime, and Karmal called for the dissolution of the Khalqist PDPA. Karmal's call for dissolution only worsened relations between the Khalqist and Parchamite PDPA.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA55 55]}} However, Taraki and Amin were lucky; Karmal's alliance actually hurt the Parchamites' standing in Afghan politics. Some communists in the armed forces became disillusioned with the government of Daoud, and turned to the Khalqist PDPA because of its apparent independence. Parchamite association with the Daoud government indirectly led to the Khalqist-led PDPA coup of 1978, popularly referred to as the [[Saur Revolution]]. From 1973 until the 1978 coup, Amin was responsible for organising party work in the Afghan armed forces.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA56 56]}} According to the official version, Amin \"met patriotic liaison officers day or night, in the desert or the mountains, in the fields or the forests, enlightening them on the basis of the principles of the [[working class]] ideology.\" Amin's success in recruiting military officers lay in the fact that Daoud \"betrayed the left\" soon after taking power.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA57 57]}} When Amin began recruiting military officers for the PDPA, it was not difficult for him to find disgruntled military officers. In the meantime, relations between the Parchamite and Khalqist PDPA deteriorated; in 1973 it was rumoured that Major [[Zia Mohammadzai]], a Parchamite and head of the [[Republican Guard (Afghanistan)|Republican Guard]], planned to assassinate the entire Khalqist leadership. The plan, if true, failed because the Khalqists found out about it.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA58 58]}}\n\nThe assassination attempt proved to be a further blow to relations between the Parchamites and Khalqists. The Parchamites deny that they ever planned to assassinate the Khalqist leadership, but historian Beverley Male argues that Karmal's subsequent activities give credence to the Khalqist view of events. Because of the Parchamite assassination attempt, Amin pressed the Khalqist PDPA to seize power in 1976 by ousting Daoud.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA58 58]}} The majority of the PDPA leadership voted against such a move.{{sfn|Male|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA58 58\u201359]}} The following year, in 1977, the Parchamites and Khalqists officially reconciled, and the PDPA was unified. The Parchamite and Khalqist PDPAs, which had separate general secretaries, politburos, central committees and other organisational structures, were officially unified in the summer of 1977.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA52 52]}} One reason for unification was that the international communist movement, represented by the [[Communist Party of India]], [[Iraqi Communist Party]] and the [[Communist Party of Australia]], called for party unification.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA53 53]}}\n\n===Saur Revolution===\n{{further|Saur Revolution}}\nOn 18 April 1978 [[Mir Akbar Khyber]], the chief ideologue of the Parcham faction, was killed; he was commonly believed to have been assassinated by the Daoud government. Khyber's assassination initiated a chain of events which led to the PDPA taking power eleven days later, on 27 April.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA62 62]}} The assassin was never caught, but [[Anahita Ratebzad]], a Parchamite, believed that Amin had ordered the assassination.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA58 58]}} Khyber's funeral evolved into a large anti-government demonstration. Daoud, who did not understand the significance of the events, began a mass arrest of PDPA members seven days after Khyber's funeral. Amin, who organised the subsequent revolution against Daoud, was one of the last Central Committee members to be arrested by the authorities. His late arrest can be considered as proof of the regime's lack of information; Amin was the leading revolutionary party organiser. The government's lack of awareness was proven by the arrest of Taraki \u2013 Taraki's arrest was the pre-arranged signal for the revolution to commence.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA62 62]}} When Amin found out that Taraki had been arrested, he ordered the revolution to begin at 9am on 27 April. Amin, in contrast to Taraki, was not imprisoned, but instead put under [[house arrest]]. His son, Abdur Rahman, was still allowed freedom of movement. The revolution was successful, thanks to overwhelming support from the Afghan military; for instance, it was supported by [[Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan)|Defence Minister]] [[Ghulam Haidar Rasuli]], [[Aslam Watanjar]] the commander of the ground forces, and the Chief of Staff of the [[Afghan Air Force]], [[Abdul Qadir (Afghan communist)|Abdul Qadir]].{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA63 63]}}\n\n==PDPA rule==\n\n===Khalq\u2013Parcham break===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Amin wife.png|thumb|Amin with his wife at a military parade in 1978{{deletable image-caption|Saturday, 28 April 2018|F7}}]] -->\nAfter the Saur revolution, Taraki was appointed Chairman of the Presidium of the [[Revolutionary Council (Afghanistan)|Revolutionary Council]] and [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Afghanistan)|Council of Ministers]], and retained his post as PDPA general secretary. Taraki initially formed a government which consisted of both [[Khalq]]ists and [[Parcham]]ites;{{sfn|Gladstone|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aH_KCWVB6W0C&pg=PA117 117]}} Karmal became Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council{{sfn|Brecher|Wilkenfeld|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GjY7aV_6FPwC&pg=PA356 356]}} while Amin became [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]{{sfn|Gladstone|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aH_KCWVB6W0C&pg=PA117 117]}} and a Deputy Prime Minister,{{sfn|Asthana|Nirmal|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8EqWnqdsgZMC&pg=PA219 219]}} and [[Mohammad Aslam Watanjar]] became a Deputy Prime Minister. The two Parchamites Abdul Qadir and [[Mohammad Rafi]] became [[Ministry of Defence (Afghanistan)|Minister of National Defence]] and [[Ministry of Public Works (Afghanistan)|Minister of Public Works]] respectively.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&pg=PA70 70]}} According to Angel Rasanayagam, the appointment of Amin, Karmal and Watanjar as Deputy Prime Ministers led to the establishment of three cabinets; the Khalqists were answerable to Amin, the Parchamites were answerable to Karmal, and the military officers (who were Parchamites) were answerable to Watanjar.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&pg=PA70 70\u201371]}} The first conflict between the Khalqists and Parchamites arose when the Khalqists wanted to give PDPA Central Committee membership to the military officers who participated in the [[Saur Revolution]]. Amin, who had previously opposed the appointment of military officers to the PDPA leadership, switched sides; he now supported their elevation. The PDPA Politburo voted in favour of giving membership to the military officers; the victors (the Khalqists) portrayed the Parchamites as opportunists, implying that the Parchamites had ridden the revolutionary wave, but not actually participated in the revolution. To make matters worse for the Parchamites, the term Parcham was, according to Taraki, a word synonymous with factionalism.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&pg=PA71 71]}}\n\nOn 27 June 1978, three months after the revolution, Amin managed to outmaneuver the Parchamites at a Central Committee meeting.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&pg=PA72 72\u201373]}} The meeting decided that the Khalqists had exclusive rights to formulate and decide policy, a policy which left the Parchamites impotent. Karmal was exiled, but was able to establish a network with the remaining Parchamites in government. A coup to overthrow Amin was planned for September. Its leading members in Afghanistan were Qadir, the defence minister, and Army Chief of Staff General [[Shahpur Ahmedzai]]. The coup was planned for 4 September, on the Festival of Eid, because soldiers and officers would be off duty. The conspiracy failed when the Afghan ambassador to India told the Afghan leadership about the plan. A purge was initiated, and Parchamite ambassadors were recalled; few returned, for example Karmal and [[Mohammad Najibullah]] both stayed in their assigned countries.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&pg=PA73 73]}}\n\n===Amin\u2013Taraki break===\nThe Afghan people revolted against the PDPA government when the government introduced several [[Socialism|socialist reforms]], including [[land reforms]]. By early 1979, twenty-five out of Afghanistan's twenty-eight provinces were unsafe because of armed resistance against the government. On 29 March 1979, the [[1979 Herat uprising|Herat uprising]] began; the uprising turned the revolt into an open war between the [[Mujahideen]] and the Afghan government. It was during this period that Amin became Kabul's strongman.{{sfn|Isby|1986|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k86jifnA3oYC&pg=PA6 6]}} Shortly after the Herat uprising had been crushed, the Revolutionary Council convened to ratify the new Five-Year Plan, the Afghan\u2013Soviet Friendship Treaty, and to vote on whether or not to reorganise the cabinet and to enhance the power of the [[Executive branch|executive]] (the Chairman of the Revolutionary Council). While the official version of events said that all issues were voted on democratically at the meeting, the Revolutionary Council held another meeting the following day to ratify the new Five-Year Plan and to discuss the reorganisation of the cabinet.{{sfn|Male|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA163 163\u2013164]}}\n\n{{Quote box\n|width = 23em\n|align = right\n|quote = As one of our slogans is 'to everyone according to his capacity and work', therefore as a result of past performances and services he has won our greater trust and assurances.

These three men put pressure on Taraki, who by this time believed that \"he really was the 'great leader'\", to sack Amin from office. It is unknown if Amin knew anything about the conspiracy against him, but it was after the cabinet reorganisation that he talked about his dissatisfaction. On 26 March the PDPA Politburo and the Council of Ministers approved the extension of the powers of the executive branch, and the establishment of the [[Homeland Higher Defence Council]] (HHDC) to handle security matters.{{sfn|Male|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA163 163\u2013164]}} Many analysts of the day regarded Amin's appointment as Prime Minister as an increase in his powers at the expense of Taraki. However, the reorganisation of the cabinet and the strengthening of Taraki's position as Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, had reduced the authority of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was, due to the strengthening of the executive, now appointed by the Chairman of the Revolutionary Council. While Amin could appoint and dismiss new ministers, he needed Taraki's consent to actually do so. Another problem for Amin was that while the Council of Ministers was responsible to the Revolutionary Council and its chairman, individual ministers were only responsible to Taraki. When Amin became Prime Minister, he was responsible for planning, finance and budgetary matters, the conduct of [[foreign policy]], and for order and security. The order and security responsibilities had been taken over by the HHDC, which was chaired by Taraki.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA164 164]}} While Amin was HHDC Deputy Chairman, the majority of HHDC members were members of the anti-Amin faction. For instance, the HHDC membership included Watanjar the [[Ministry of Defence (Afghanistan)|Minister of National Defence]], [[Ministry of Interior (Afghanistan)|Interior Minister]] Mazdoryar, the President of the Political Affairs of the Armed Forces [[Mohammad Iqbal (politician)|Mohammad Iqbal]], [[Mohammad Yaqub]], the Chief of the General Staff, the Commander of the [[Afghan Air Force]] [[Nazar Mohammad (politician)|Nazar Mohammad]] and [[Assadullah Sarwari]] the head of [[KHAD|ASGA]], the Afghan secret police.{{sfn|Male|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA164 164\u2013165]}}\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" width=65% style=\"float:right; margin:0 15px;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"9\" align=\"center\" | Amin cabinet (1979){{sfn|Adamec|2011|pp=li\u2013lii}}\n|-\n!colspan=1 bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|Office\n!colspan=1 bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|Incumbent\n!colspan=1 bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|Took&nbsp; office\n!colspan=1 bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|Left&nbsp; office\n|-\n|Deputy Chairman of the [[Council of Ministers (Afghanistan)|Council of Ministers]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Shah Wali (politician)|Shah Wali]]\n|1 April\n|27 December\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]\n|1 April\n|27&nbsp;December\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Ministry of Agriculture (Afghanistan)|Minister of Agriculture]]\n|[[Saleh Muhammad Zarei]]\n|1 April\n|28 July\n|-\n|[[Abdul Rashid Jalili]]\n|28 July\n|27 December\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Finance (Afghanistan)|Minister of Finance]]\n|[[Abdul Karim Misaq]]\n|1 April\n|27 December\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Higher Education (Afghanistan)|Minister of Higher Education]]\n|[[Mahmud Suma]]\n|1 April\n|27 December\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Ministry of Defence (Afghanistan)|Minister of National Defence]]\n|[[Muhammad Aslam Watanjar]]\n|1 April\n|28 July\n|-\n|Hafizullah Amin\n|28 July\n|27 December\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Ministry of Education (Afghanistan)|Minister of Education]]\n|[[Abdul Rashid Jalili]]\n|1 April\n|28 July\n|-\n|[[Muhammad Salim Masudi]]\n|28 July\n|27 December\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Justice (Afghanistan)|Minister of Justice]], [[Attorney General (Afghanistan)|Attorney General]]\n|[[Abdul Hakim Shara'i]]\n|1 April\n|27 December\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Water, Power (Afghanistan)|Minister of Water, Power]]\n|[[Mahmud Hashemi]]\n|1 April\n|27 December\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Information (Afghanistan)|Minister of Information, Culture]]\n|[[Khial Katawazi]]\n|1 April\n|27 December\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Mines, Industries (Afghanistan)|Minister of Mines, Industries]]\n|[[Muhammad Isma'il Danesh]]\n|1 April\n|27 December\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Commerce (Afghanistan)|Minister of Commerce]]\n|[[Abdul Quddus Ghorbandi]]\n|1 April\n|27 December\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Transport (Afghanistan)|Minister of Transport]]\n|[[Hasan Bareq-Shafi'i]]\n|1 April\n|27 December\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|[[Ministry of Border Affairs (Afghanistan)|Minister of Border Affairs]]\n|[[Sahibjan Sahra'i]]\n|1 April\n|28 July\n|-\n|[[Sherjan Mazdoryar]]\n|28 July\n|14 September\n|-\n|Unknown\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephone (Afghanistan)|Minister of Post, Telegraph and Telephone]]\n|[[Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy]]\n|28 July\n|14 September\n|-\n|[[Mohammad Zarif (Afghanistan)|Mohammad Zarif]]\n|14 September\n|27 December\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Minister of Interior]]\n|[[Muhammad Aslam Watanjar]]\n|28 July\n|14 September\n|-\n|[[Faqir Mohammad Faqir]]\n|14 September\n|27 December\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Planning (Afghanistan)|Minister of Planning]]\n|[[Muhammad Siddig Alemyar]]\n|28 July\n|27 December\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Health (Afghanistan)|Minister of Health]]\n|[[Saleh Muhammad Zirai]]\n|28 July\n|27 December\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Public Works (Afghanistan)|Minister of Public Works]]\n|[[Dastagir Panjsheri]]\n|28 July\n|27 December\n|}\nThe [[order of precedence]] had been institutionalised, whereby Taraki was responsible for defence and Amin responsible for assisting Taraki in defence related matters. Amin's position was given a further blow by the democratisation of the decision-making process, which allowed its members to contribute; most of them were against Amin. Another problem for Amin was that the office of HHDC Deputy Chairman had no specific functions or powers, and the appointment of a new defence minister who opposed him drastically weakened his control over the Ministry of National Defence. The reorganisation of ministers was a further blow to Amin's position; he had lost control of the defence ministry, the interior ministry and the ASGA. Amin still had allies at the top, many of them in strategically important positions, for instance, Yaqub was his [[brother-in-law]] and the Security Chief in the Ministry of Interior was [[Sayed Daoud Taroon]], who was also later appointed to the HHDC as an ordinary member in April. Amin succeeded in appointing two more of his allies to important positions; [[Mohammad Sediq Alemyar]] as [[Ministry of Planning (Afghanistan)|Minister of Planning]] and [[Khayal Mohammad Katawazi]] as [[Ministry of Information, Culture (Afghanistan)|Minister of Information and Culture]]; and [[Faqir Mohammad Faqir]] was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in April 1978.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA165 165]}} Amin's political position was not secure when [[Alexei Yepishev]], the Head of the [[Main Political Directorate of the Soviet Army and Navy]], visited Kabul.{{sfn|Male|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA165 165\u2013166]}} Yepishev met personally with Taraki on 7 April, but never met with Amin.

Even though Amin was Prime Minister, Taraki chaired the meetings instead of him. Amin's presence at these two meetings was not mentioned at all, and it was made clear that Taraki, through his office as Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, also chaired the Council of Ministers. Another problem facing Amin was Taraki's policy of [[autocracy]]; he tried to deprive the [[Politburo of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA Politburo]] of its powers as a party and state decision-making organ. The situation deteriorated when Amin personally warned Taraki that \"the prestige and popularity of leaders among the people has no common aspect with a [[Cult of personality|personality cult]].\"{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA167 167]}}\n\nFactionalism within the PDPA made it ill-prepared to handle the intensified [[counter-revolution]]ary activities in the country.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA171 171]}} Amin tried to win support for the communist government by depicting himself as a devout Muslim.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA177 177]}} Taraki and Amin blamed different countries for helping the counter-revolutionaries; Amin attacked the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) and played down American and Chinese involvement, while Taraki blamed [[American imperialism]] and [[Iran]] and [[Pakistan]] for supporting the uprising. Amin's criticism of the United Kingdom and the BBC fed on the traditional anti-British sentiments held by rural Afghans. In contrast to Taraki, \"Amin bent over backwards to avoid making hostile reference to\", China, the United States or other foreign governments.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA178 178]}} Amin's cautious behavior was in deep contrast to the Soviet Union's official stance on the situation; it seemed, according to Beverley Male, that the Soviet leadership tried to force a confrontation between Afghanistan and its enemies.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA178 178]}} Amin also tried to appease the [[Shia]] communities by meeting with their leaders; despite this, a section of the Shia leadership called for the continuation of the resistance. Subsequently, a revolt broke out in a Shia populated district in Kabul; this was the first sign of unrest in Kabul since the [[Saur Revolution]].{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA179 179]}} To add to the government's problems, Taraki's ability to lead the country was questioned \u2013 he was a heavy drinker and was not in good health. Amin on the other hand was characterised in this period by portrayals of strong self-discipline. In the summer of 1979 Amin began to disassociate himself from Taraki.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA180 180]}} On 27 June Amin became a member of the PDPA Politburo, the leading decision-making body in Afghanistan.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&pg=PA71 71\u201373]}}\n\n===Rise to power===\nIn-mid July the Soviets made their view official when ''[[Pravda]]'' wrote an article about the situation in Afghanistan; the Soviets did not wish to see Amin become leader of Afghanistan. This triggered a political crisis in Afghanistan, as Amin initiated a policy of extreme repression, which became one of the main reasons for the Soviet intervention later that year.{{sfn|Brecher|Wilkenfeld|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GjY7aV_6FPwC&pg=PA357 357]}} On 28 July, a vote in the PDPA Politburo approved Amin's proposal of creating a [[collective leadership]] with collective decision-making;{{sfn|H. Kakar|M. Kakar|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QyTmFj5tUGsC&pg=PA36 36]}} this was a blow to Taraki, and many of his supporters were replaced by pro-Amin PDPA members.{{sfn|Wahab|Youngerman|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=y20MTE0C9kwC&pg=PA150 150]}} [[Ivan Pavlovsky]], the Commander of the [[Soviet Army|Soviet Ground Forces]], visited Kabul in mid-August to study the situation in Afghanistan. Amin, in a speech just a few days after Pavlovsky's arrival, said that he wanted closer relations between Afghanistan and the [[China|People's Republic of China]]; in the same speech he hinted that he had reservations about Soviet meddling in Afghanistan. He likened Soviet assistance to Afghanistan with [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s assistance to the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] in 1919. Taraki, a delegate to the conference held by the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in [[Havana]], met personally with [[Andrei Gromyko]], the Soviet [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], to discuss the Afghanistan situation on 9 September. [[Shah Wali (politician)|Shah Wali]], the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], who was a supporter of Amin, did not participate in the meeting. This, according to Beverley Male, \"suggested that some plot against Amin was in preparation\".{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA184 184]}}\n\nTaraki was instructed to stop-over in Moscow, where the Soviet leaders urged him to remove Amin from power as per the KGB's decision, because Amin posed danger. Amin's trusted aid, Daoud Taroon, informed Amin of the meeting and the KGB's plan. In Kabul, Taraki's aides, the [[Gang of Four (Afghanistan)|Gang of Four]] (consisting of Watanjar, Mazdoryar, Gulabzoi and Sarwari), planned a plot to assassinate Amin, but it failed as Amin was informed of this. Within hours of Taraki's return to Kabul on 11 September, Taraki convened the cabinet \"ostensibly to report on the Havana Summit\". Instead of reporting on the summit, Taraki tried to dismiss Amin as Prime Minister. Amin, aware of the murder plot, demanded the Gang of Four to be removed from their posts, but Taraki laughed it off.{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA185 185]}}<ref>''Afghanistan: A Modern History'' by Angelo Rasanayagam</ref> Taraki sought to neutralise Amin's power and influence by requesting that he serve overseas as an ambassador. Amin turned down the proposal, shouting \"You are the one who should quit! Because of drink and old age you have taken leave of your senses.\"\n\nOn September 13, Taraki invited Amin to the presidential palace for lunch with him and the Gang of Four. Amin turned down the offer, stating he would prefer their resignation rather than lunching with them. Soviet ambassador Puzanov persuaded Amin to make the visit to the Presidential Palace along with Taroon, the Chief of Police, and [[Nawab Ali]], an intelligence officer. Inside the palace on September 14, bodyguards within the building opened fire on the visitors. Taroon was killed but Amin only sustained an injury and escaped. Amin drove to the Ministry of Defence building, put the Army on high alert and ordered Taraki's arrest. At 6:30pm tanks from the 4th Armoured Corps entered the city and stood at government buildings. Shortly afterwards, Amin returned to the palace with a contingent of Army officers, and placed Taraki under arrest. The Gang of Four, however, had \"disappeared\" and sought refuge in the Soviet Embassy.\n\nAfter Taraki's arrest, the Soviets tried to rescue Taraki (or, according to other sources, kidnap Amin) via the embassy or [[Bagram Air Base]] but the strength of Amin's officers repelled their decision to make a move. Amin was told by the Soviets not to punish Taraki and strip him and his comrades of their positions, but Amin ignored them. Amin reportedly discussed the incident with [[Leonid Brezhnev]], and indirectly asked for the permission to kill Taraki, to which Brezhnev replied that it was his choice. Amin, who now believed he had the full support of the Soviets, ordered the death of Taraki. It is believed Taraki was suffocated with pillows on October 8, 1979. The Afghan media would report that the ailing Taraki had died, omitting any mention of his murder.{{sfn|Misdaq|2006|p=125}} Taraki's murder shocked and upset Brezhnev.<ref>''Humanitarian Invasion: Global Development in Cold War Afghanistan'' by Timothy Nunan</ref>\n\n===Presidency===\n\n====Domestic policies====\nFollowing Taraki's fall from power, Amin was elected Chairman of the Presidum of the [[Revolutionary Council (Afghanistan)|Revolutionary Council]] and General Secretary of the [[Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA Central Committee]] by the PDPA Politburo. The election of Amin as PDPA General Secretary and the removal of Taraki from all party posts was unanimous.{{sfn|Tripathi|Falk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tDf8p060_JgC&pg=PA48 48]}} The only members of the cabinet replaced when Amin took power were the Gang of Four \u2013 Beverley Male saw this as \"a clear indication that he had their [the ministers'] support\".{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA185 185]}} Amin's rise to power was followed by a policy of moderation, and attempts to persuade the Afghan people that the regime was not [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]]. Amin's government began to invest in the reconstruction, or reparation, of mosques. He also promised the Afghan people [[freedom of religion]]. Religious groups were given copies of the [[Quran]], and Amin began to refer to [[Allah]] in speeches. He even claimed that the Saur Revolution was \"totally based on the principles of Islam\". The campaign proved to be unsuccessful, and many Afghans held Amin responsible for the regime's [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian behavior]].{{sfn|Gladstone|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aH_KCWVB6W0C&pg=PA118 118]}} Amin's rise to power was officially endorsed by the [[Jamiatul Ulama (Afghanistan)|Jamiatul Ulama]] on 20 September 1979. Their endorsement led to the official announcement that Amin was a pious Muslim \u2013 Amin thus scored a point against the counter-revolutionary propaganda which claimed the communist regime was [[atheist]]. Amin also tried to increase his popularity with tribal groups, a feat Taraki had been unable or unwilling to achieve. In a speech to tribal elders Amin was defensive about the Western way he dressed; an official biography was published which depicted Amin in traditional Pashtun clothes. During his short stay in power, Amin became committed to establishing a collective leadership; when Taraki was ousted, Amin promised \"from now on there will be no [[Autocracy|one-man government]]...\"{{sfn|Male|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-cYOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA192 192]}}\n\nAttempting to pacify the population, Amin released a list of 18,000 people who had been executed, and blamed the executions on Taraki. The total number of arrested during Taraki's and Amin's combined reign number between 17,000 and 45,000.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&pg=PA273 273]}} Amin was not liked by the Afghan people. During his rule, opposition to the communist regime increased, and the government lost control of the countryside. The state of the [[Afghan military]] deteriorated; due to desertions the number of military personnel in the Afghan army decreased from 100,000 in the immediate aftermath of the Saur Revolution, to somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000. Another problem Amin faced was the KGB's penetration of the PDPA, the military and the government bureaucracy.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&pg=PA160 160]}} While Amin's position in Afghanistan was becoming more perilous by the day, his enemies who were exiled in the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]] were agitating for his removal. [[Babrak Karmal]], the Parchamite leader, met several leading Eastern Bloc figures during this period, and [[Mohammad Aslam Watanjar]], [[Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy]] and [[Assadullah Sarwari]] wanted to exact revenge upon Amin.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&pg=PA160 160\u2013161]}}\n\n====Foreign policy====\nWhen Amin became leader, he tried to reduce Afghanistan's dependence on the Soviet Union. To accomplish this, he aimed to balance Afghanistan's relations with the Soviet Union by strengthening relations with [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]]. The Soviets were concerned when they received reports that Amin had met personally with [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], one of the leading anti-communists in Afghanistan. His general untrustworthiness and his unpopularity amongst Afghans made it more difficult for Amin to find new \"foreign patrons\".{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&pg=PA159 159]}} Amin's involvement in the death of [[Adolph Dubs]], the [[United States Ambassador to Afghanistan|American Ambassador to Afghanistan]], strained his relations with the United States. He tried to improve relations by reestablishing contact, met with three different American [[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]], and was interviewed by an American correspondent. But this did not improve Afghanistan's standing in the eyes of the United States Government. After the third meeting with Amin, [[J. Bruce Amstutz]], the American Ambassador to Afghanistan from 1979 to 1980, believed the wisest thing to do was to maintain \"a low profile, trying to avoid issues, and waiting to see what happens\".{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&pg=PA160 160]}} In early December 1979, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed a joint summit meeting between Amin and [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], the [[President of Pakistan]]. The Pakistani Government, accepting a modified version of the offer, agreed to send [[Agha Shahi]], the Pakistani foreign minister, to [[Kabul]] for talks. In the meanwhile, the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI), Pakistani's secret police, continued to train [[Mujahideen]] fighters who opposed the communist regime.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&pg=PA160 160]}}\n\n=====Afghan\u2013Soviet relations=====\n{{Quote box\n|width = 23em\n|align = right\n|quote = Any person and any element who harms the friendship between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union will be considered the enemy of the country, enemy of our people and enemy of our revolution.

However, the Soviet leadership did not advocate intervention at this time, and instead called for increasing its influence in the Amin leadership to expose his \"true intentions\".{{sfn|Tripathi|Falk|2010|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tDf8p060_JgC&pg=PA50 50\u201351]}} A Soviet Politburo assessment referred to Amin as \"a power-hungry leader who is distinguished by brutality and treachery\".{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&pg=PA162 162]}} Amongst the many sins they alleged were his \"insincerity and duplicity\" when dealing with the Soviet Union, creating fictitious accusations against PDPA-members who opposed him, indulging in a policy of [[nepotism]], and his tendency to conduct a more \"balanced policy\" towards [[First World]] countries.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&pg=PA162 162\u2013163]}}  According to the former senior Soviet diplomat, [[Oleg Grinevsky]], the KGB was becoming increasingly convinced that Amin couldn't be counted on to effectively deal with the insurgency and preserve the survival of the Afghan Marxist state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/asia-july-dec06-soviet_10-10|title=The Soviet Occupation of Afghanistan|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of October the Special Commission on Afghanistan, which consisted of Andropov, Gromyko, Ustinov and Ponomarev, wanted to end the impression that the Soviet government supported Amin's leadership and policy. The KGB's [[First Chief Directorate]] was put under orders that something had to be done about Afghanistan, and several of its personnel were assembled to deal with the task.{{sfn|Tripathi|Falk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tDf8p060_JgC&pg=PA54 54]}} Andropov fought hard for Soviet intervention, saying to Brezhnev that Amin's policies had destroyed the military and the government's capabilities to handle the crisis by use of mass repression. The plan, according to Andropov, was to assemble a small force to intervene and remove Amin from power and replace him with Karmal.{{sfn|Tripathi|Falk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tDf8p060_JgC&pg=PA55 55]}} The Soviet Union declared its plan to intervene in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979, and the Soviet leadership initiated [[Operation Storm-333]] (the first phase of the intervention) on 27 December 1979.{{sfn|Camp|2012|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yMmx1m_ZCqEC&pg=PA12 12\u201313]}}\n\n====Death====\n{{Further|Operation Storm-333}}\n[[File:Dvorec 27 12 79.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Tajbeg Palace]] on December 27, 1979, where Amin was killed]]\nAmin trusted the Soviet Union until the very end, despite the deterioration of official relations, and was unaware that the tide in Moscow had turned against him since he ordered Taraki's death. When the Afghan intelligence service handed Amin a report that the Soviet Union would invade the country and topple him, Amin claimed that the report was a product of [[imperialism]]. His view can be explained by the fact that the Soviet Union, after several months, finally gave in to Amin's demands and sent troops into Afghanistan to secure the PDPA government.{{sfn|Garthoff|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGG-x_tuNUcC&pg=PA1009 1009] }} Contrary to common Western belief, Amin was informed of the Soviet decision to send troops into Afghanistan.{{sfn|Garthoff|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGG-x_tuNUcC&pg=PA1017 1017]}} General Tukharinov, commander of the 40th Army, met with Afghan Major General Babadzhan to talk about Soviet troop movements before the Soviet army's intervention.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9FjkLLEyh1UC&pg=PA87 87]}} On 25 December, [[Dmitriy Ustinov]] issued a formal order, stating that \"[t]he state frontier of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] is to be crossed on the ground and in the air by forces of the 40th Army and the Air Force at 1500 hrs on 25 December\". This was the formal beginning of the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet intervention in Afghanistan]].{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=86}}\n\nConcerned for his safety, on 20 December Amin moved from the Presidential Palace, located in the centre of Kabul, to the [[Tajbeg Palace]], which had previously been the headquarters of the Central Army Corps of the Afghan military. The palace was formidable, with walls strong enough to withstand artillery fire. According to [[Rodric Braithwaite]], \"its defences had been carefully and intelligently organised\".{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=89}} All roads to the palace had been mined, with the exception of one, which had heavy machine guns and artillery positioned to defend it. To make matters worse for the Soviets, the Afghans had established a second line of defence which consisted of seven posts, \"each manned by four sentries armed with a machine gun, a mortar, and automatic rifles\".{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=89}} The external defences of the palace were handled by the Presidential Guard, which consisted of 2,500 troops and three [[T-54 tank]]s.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=89}} Several Soviet commanders involved in the assassination of Amin thought the plan to attack the palace was \"crazy\".{{sfn|Braithwaite||2011|p=94}} Although the military had been informed by the Soviet leadership through their commanders, [[Yuri Drozdov (general)|Yuri Drozdov]] and [[Vasily Kolesnik]], that the president was a \"CIA agent\"{{sfn|Garthoff|1994|p [https://books.google.com/books?id=mGG-x_tuNUcC&pg=PA1046 1046]}} who had betrayed the Saur Revolution, many Soviet soldiers hesitated; despite what their commanders had told them, it seemed implausible that Amin, the leader of the PDPA government, was an American double agent. Despite several objections, the plan to assassinate Amin went ahead.{{sfn|Braithwaite||2011|p=94}}\n\nBefore resorting to killing Amin by brute force, the Soviets had tried to poison as early as 13 December (but nearly killed his nephew instead) and to kill him with a sniper shot on his way to work (this proved impossible as the Afghans had improved their security measures).{{sfn|Braithwaite||2011|p=94}} They even tried to poison Amin just hours before the assault on the Presidential Palace on 27 December. Amin had organised a lunch for party members to show guests his palace and to celebrate [[Ghulam Dastagir Panjsheri]]'s return from [[Moscow]]. Panjsheri's return improved the mood even further; he boasted that the Soviet divisions had already crossed the border, and that he and Gromyko always kept in contact with each other. During the meal, Amin and several of his guests lost consciousness as they had been poisoned. Luckily for Amin, but unfortunately for the Soviets, he survived his encounter with death. [[Mikhail Talybov]], a [[KGB]] agent, was given responsibility for the poisonings.{{sfn|Braithwaite||2011|p=95}}\n\nThe assault on the palace began shortly afterward.{{sfn|Braithwaite||2011|p=96}} During the attack Amin still believed the Soviet Union was on his side, and told his adjutant, \"The Soviets will help us\".{{sfn|Braithwaite||2011|p=98}} The adjutant replied that it was the Soviets who were attacking them; Amin initially replied that this was a lie. Only after he tried but failed to contact the Chief of the General Staff, he muttered, \"I guessed it. It's all true\".{{sfn|Braithwaite||2011|p=99}} There are various accounts of how Amin died, but the exact details have never been confirmed. Amin was either killed by a deliberate attack or died by a \"random burst of fire\".{{sfn|Braithwaite||2011|p=99}} Amin's son was fatally wounded and died shortly after.{{sfn|Braithwaite||2011|p=99}} His daughter was wounded, but survived.{{sfn|Braithwaite||2011|p=104}} It was Gulabzoy who had been given orders to kill Amin and Watanjar who later confirmed his death.{{sfn|Braithwaite||2011|p=99}} The men of Amin's family were all executed, while the women including his daughter were imprisoned at [[Pul-e-Charkhi prison]] until being released by President [[Mohammad Najibullah|Najibullah]] in early 1992.<ref>''Afgantsy: The Russians in Afghanistan 1979-89'' by Rodric Braithwaite</ref> After Amin's death on 27 December 1979, [[Radio Kabul]] broadcast [[Babrak Karmal]]'s pre-recorded speech to the Afghan people, saying: \"Today the torture machine of Amin has been smashed\".

Hubris is usually perceived as a characteristic of an individual rather than a group, although the group the offender belongs to may suffer collateral consequences from the wrongful act. Hubris often indicates a loss of contact with reality and an overestimation of one's own competence, accomplishments or capabilities. \n\n== Ancient Greek origin ==\n\n===Common use===\n\nIn [[ancient Greek]], ''hubris'' referred to actions that shamed and humiliated the victim for the pleasure or gratification of the abuser.<ref>David Cohen, \"Law, society and homosexuality or hermaphrodity in Classical Athens\" in ''Studies in ancient Greek and Roman society'' By Robin Osborne; p. 64</ref> The term had a strong sexual connotation, and the shame reflected upon the perpetrator as well.<ref>{{cite book |title= Nomos: Essays in Athenian Law, Politics and Society |last= Cartledge|first= |authorlink= Paul Cartledge |author2=Paul Millett |year= 2003 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-521-52209-0|page= 123 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3nCSw5Cr4PUC&pg=PA123 |accessdate= 2011-11-14}}</ref>\n\nViolations of the law against hubris included what might today be termed [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]]; sexual crimes; or the theft of public or sacred property. Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of [[Demosthenes]], a prominent statesman and orator in ancient [[Greece]]. These two examples occurred when first [[Midias]] punched Demosthenes in the face in the theatre (''[[Against Midias]]''), and second when (in ''Against Conon'') a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim. Yet another example of hubris appears in [[Aeschines]]' ''[[Against Timarchus]]'', where the defendant, Timarchus, is accused of breaking the law of hubris by submitting himself to [[prostitution]] and anal intercourse. Aeschines brought this suit against Timarchus to bar him from the rights of political office and his case succeeded.<ref>Aeschines \"Against Timarchus\" from Thomas K. Hubbard's ''Homosexuality in Greece and Rome: A Sourcebook of Basic Documents''</ref>\n\nIn ancient Athens, hubris was defined as the use of violence to shame the victim (this sense of hubris could also characterize rape<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite web|title=Hubris|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/hubris|work=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|accessdate=21 April 2016}}</ref>). [[Aristotle]] defined hubris as shaming the victim, not because of anything that happened to the committer or might happen to the committer, but merely for that committer's own gratification:\n<blockquote>to cause shame to the victim, not in order that anything may happen to you, nor because anything has happened to you, but merely for your own gratification. Hubris is not the requital of past injuries; this is revenge. As for the pleasure in hubris, its cause is this: naive men think that by ill-treating others they make their own superiority the greater.<ref>[[Aristotle]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0060%3Abekker+page%3D1378b ''Rhetoric'' 1378b].</ref>{{Failed verification|reason=No mention of Hubris on page cited nor found in 'Rhetoric' on the Tufts site|date=July 2017}}<ref name=law>{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=David|title=Law, Violence, and Community in Classical Athens|page=145|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJ9GjorvJGkC&pg=PA145|isbn=0521388376|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}</ref><ref name=eros>{{cite book|last=Ludwig|first=Paul W.|title=Eros and Polis: Desire and Community in Greek Political Theory|page=178|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvqTEy-til8C&pg=PA172|isbn=1139434179|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nCrucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of [[honour]] (\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae, ''tim\u0113'') and shame (\u03b1\u1f30\u03b4\u03ce\u03c2, ''[[aidos|aid\u014ds]]''). The concept of honour included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honour, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris. This concept of honour is akin to a [[zero-sum]] game. [[Rush Rehm]] simplifies this definition of hubris to the contemporary concept of \"insolence, contempt, and excessive violence\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rehm |first1=Rush |title=Radical Theatre: Greek Tragedy in the Modern World |date=2014 |publisher=A&C Black |location=Google Books |isbn=9781472502339 |page=75 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=8eanAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=Rush+Rehm+hubris&source=bl&ots=nz5iuQGTqX&sig=0nlp6Yu745vHrOc_DTDlv-KVVGA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjUiL_1zubdAhUr94MKHUWUDgUQ6AEwCXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=Rush%20Rehm%20hubris&f=false |accessdate=2 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Religious use===\n\nThe Greek word for sin, [[hamartia]] (\u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1), originally meant \"error\" in the ancient dialect, and so poets like [[Hesiod]] and [[Aeschylus]] used the word \"hubris\" to describe transgressions against the gods. <ref>The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/topic/hubris \"Hubris\"], ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''</ref> A common way that hubris was committed was when a mortal claimed to be better than a god in a particular skill or attribute. Claims like these were rarely left unpunished, and so [[Arachne]], a talented young weaver, was transformed into a spider when she said that her skills exceeded those of the goddess [[Athena]]. Additional examples include [[Icarus]], [[Phaethon]], [[Salmoneus]], [[Niobe]], [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]], and [[Tereus]].\n\nThese events were not limited to myth, and certain figures in history were considered to be have been punished for committing hubris through their arrogance. On such person was king [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] as portrayed in Aeschylus's play [[The_Persians|The Persians]], and who allegedly threw chains to [[Xerxes%27_Pontoon_Bridges|bind the Hellespont]] sea as punishment for daring to destroy his fleet.\n\nWhat is common to all these examples is the breaching of limits, as the Greeks believed that the [[Moirai|Fates]] (\u039c\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9) had assigned each being with a particular area of freedom, an area that even the gods could not breach. <ref>Cornelius Castoriadis.

Editeur: Seuil (9 mars 2004). </ref>\n\n===Representation===\n\nThe goddess [[Hybris (mythology)|Hybris]] has been described as having \"insolent encroachment upon the rights of others\".<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Themis |volume=26 |page=758}}</ref>\n\n== The New Testament ==\n\nThe word hubris as used in the New Testament parallels the Hebrew word ''pasha'', meaning transgression. It represents a sense of false pride that makes a man defy God, sometimes to the degree that he considers himself an equal. In contrast to this, the common word for sin was [[hamartia]], which refers to an error and reflects the complexity of the human condition. Its result is guilt rather than direct punishment as in the case of hubris <ref>Stanley J. Grenz. Theology for the Community of God, [https://books.google.es/books?id=NAPrXVh_56wC&lpg=PA183&dq=hubris&pg=PA183#v=onepage&q=hubris&f=false], Pub: Wm. B.

Sometimes a person's hubris is also associated with ignorance. The accusation of hubris often implies that suffering or punishment will follow, similar to the occasional pairing of hubris and [[Nemesis (mythology)|nemesis]] in Greek mythology. The proverb \"pride goeth (goes) before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall\" (from the biblical [[Book of Proverbs]], 16:18) is thought to sum up the modern use of hubris. Hubris is also referred to as \"pride that blinds\" because it often causes a committer of hubris to act in foolish ways that belie common sense.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 1920 Farrow's Bank Failure: A Case of Managerial Hubris|url=https://www.academia.edu/6081830/The_1920_Farrows_Bank_Failure_A_Case_of_Managerial_Hubris|publisher=Durham University |deadurl=no |accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref> In other words, the modern definition may be thought of as, \"that pride that goes just before the fall.\"\n\nExamples of hubris are often found in literature, most famously in [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', in which [[Lucifer]] attempts to compel the other angels to worship him, is cast into hell by God and the innocent angels, and proclaims: \"Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.\" Victor in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' manifests hubris in his attempt to become a great scientist; he creates life through technological means, but comes to regret his project. [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]]'s play ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' portrays the eponymous character as a scholar whose arrogance and pride compel him to sign a [[deal with the Devil]], and retain his haughtiness until his death and damnation, despite the fact that he could easily have repented had he chosen to do so.\n\nAn example in pop culture is the comic book hero [[Doctor Strange]], wherein highly talented and arrogant [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] Dr. Stephen Strange is involved in a vehicular accident. Unlike the Greek figures Salmoneus, Icarus and Phaethon, he survives, though his hands are severely damaged, and thus his career as a neurosurgeon are shattered. After western medicine fails to help him, he seeks healing in the mystic arts, and though he never fully recovers, he becomes a powerful sorcerer.\n\nA historical example of hubris was furnished by [[General George Armstrong Custer]] in the decisions that culminated in the [[Battle of Little Big Horn]]; Custer is apocryphally quoted as having exclaimed: \"Where did all those damned Indians come from?\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lev7YeUk7H0C&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=Where+did+all+those+damned+indians+come+from&source=bl&ots=52FAdoZNxG&sig=Zm4zGjSr68YddlyMEx3KqWHbrac&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAmoVChMI9MeE0__iyAIVAX0mCh2S1ATy#v=onepage&q=Where%20did%20all%20those%20damned%20indians%20come%20from&f=false |title=The Words of Others: From Quotations to Culture |first1=Gary Saul |last1=Morson |page=176 |isbn=9780300167474 |location=New Haven.

The additional neutron makes a deuterium atom roughly twice as heavy as a protium atom.\n\nA molecule of heavy water has two deuterium atoms in place of the two protium atoms of ordinary \"light\" water. The weight of a heavy water molecule, however, is not substantially different from that of a normal water molecule, because about 89% of the molecular weight of water comes from the single [[oxygen]] atom rather than the two hydrogen atoms. The colloquial term ''heavy water'' refers to a highly enriched water mixture that contains mostly deuterium oxide {{chem|D|2|O}}, but also some hydrogen-deuterium oxide (HDO) and a smaller number of ordinary hydrogen oxide {{chem|H|2|O}} molecules. For instance, the heavy water used in [[CANDU reactor]]s is 99.75% enriched by hydrogen atom-fraction\u2014meaning that 99.75% of the hydrogen atoms are of the heavy type. For comparison, [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water|ordinary water]] (the \"ordinary water\" used for a deuterium standard) contains only about 156 deuterium atoms per million hydrogen atoms, meaning that 0.0156% of the hydrogen atoms are of the heavy type.\n\nHeavy water is not [[radioactivity|radioactive]]. In its pure form, it has a density about 11% greater than water, but is otherwise physically and chemically similar. Nevertheless, the various differences in deuterium-containing water (especially affecting the biological properties) are larger than in any other commonly occurring [[isotopologue|isotope-substituted compound]] because deuterium is unique among heavy [[stable isotope]]s in being twice as heavy as the lightest isotope. This difference increases the [[bond energy|strength]] of water's hydrogen-oxygen bonds, and this in turn is enough to cause differences that are important to some biochemical reactions. The human body naturally contains deuterium equivalent to about five grams of heavy water, which is harmless. When a large fraction of water (> 50%) in higher organisms is replaced by heavy water, the result is [[Cell (biology)|cell]] dysfunction and death.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=10535697 |title=Pharmacological uses and perspectives of heavy water and deuterated compounds |author1=D.

Most modern reactors use [[enriched uranium]] with ordinary water as the moderator.\n\n==Other heavy forms of water==\n===Semiheavy water===\n'''Semiheavy water''', HDO, exists whenever there is water with light hydrogen (protium, {{chem|1|H}}) and deuterium (D or {{chem|2|H}}) in the mix. This is because hydrogen atoms (hydrogen-1 and deuterium) are rapidly exchanged between water molecules. Water containing 50% H and 50% D in its hydrogen actually contains about 50% HDO and 25% each of {{chem|H|2|O}} and {{chem|D|2|O}}, in [[dynamic equilibrium]].\nIn normal water, about 1 molecule in 3,200 is HDO (one hydrogen in 6,400 is in the form of D), and heavy water molecules ({{chem|D|2|O}}) only occur in a proportion of about 1 molecule in 41 million (i.e. one in 6,400<sup>2</sup>). Thus [[semiheavy water]] molecules are far more common than \"pure\" (homoisotopic) heavy water molecules.\n\n===Heavy-oxygen water===\nWater enriched in the heavier oxygen isotopes [[oxygen-17|{{chem|17|O}}]] and [[oxygen-18|{{chem|18|O}}]] is also commercially available, e.g., for [[doubly labeled water|use as a non-radioactive isotopic tracer]]. It is \"heavy water\" as it is denser than normal water ({{chem|H|2}}{{chem|18|O}} is approximately as dense as {{chem|D|2|O}}, {{chem|H|2}}{{chem|17|O}} is about halfway between {{chem|H|2|O}} and {{chem|D|2|O}})\u2014but is rarely called heavy water, since it does not contain the deuterium that gives D<sub>2</sub>O its unusual nuclear and biological properties. It is more expensive than D<sub>2</sub>O due to the more difficult separation of <sup>17</sup>O and <sup>18</sup>O.<ref>Mosin, O. V, Ignatov, I.

Heavy water is less dissociated than light water at given temperature, and the true concentration of D<sup>+</sup> ions is less than {{H+}} ions would be for a light water sample at the same temperature. The same is true of OD<sup>\u2212</sup> vs. {{OH-}} ions. For heavy water Kw D<sub>2</sub>O (25.0&nbsp;\u00b0C) = 1.35 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221215</sup>, and [D<sup>+</sup>{{hsp}}] must equal [OD<sup>\u2212</sup>{{hsp}}] for neutral water. Thus pKw D<sub>2</sub>O = p[OD<sup>\u2212</sup>] + p[D<sup>+</sup>] = 7.44 + 7.44 = 14.87 (25.0&nbsp;\u00b0C), and the p[D<sup>+</sup>] of neutral heavy water at 25.0&nbsp;\u00b0C is 7.44.\n\nThe pD of heavy water is generally measured using pH electrodes giving a pH (apparent) value, or pHa, and at various temperatures a true acidic pD can be estimated from the directly pH meter measured pHa, such that pD+ = pHa (apparent reading from pH meter) + 0.41.  The electrode correction for alkaline conditions is 0.456 for heavy water. The alkaline correction is then pD+ = pH<sub>a</sub>(apparent reading from pH meter) + 0.456. These corrections are slightly different from the differences in p[D+] and p[OD-] of 0.44 from the corresponding ones in heavy water.<ref>[http://www.nuceng.ca/candu/pdf/15%20-%20Chemistry%20in%20CANDU%20Process%20Systems.pdf discussion of pD+],</ref>\n\nHeavy water is 10.6% denser than ordinary water, and heavy water's physically different properties can be seen without equipment if a frozen sample is dropped into normal water, as it will sink. If the water is ice-cold the higher melting temperature of heavy ice can also be observed: it melts at 3.7&nbsp;\u00b0C, and thus does not melt in ice-cold normal water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popsci.com/popsci/how20/a07160a72252c010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html |title=How 2.0 |accessdate=21 January 2008 |last=Gray |first=Theodore |date=2007 |website= |publisher=Popular Science |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216010940/http://www.popsci.com/popsci/how20/a07160a72252c010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html |archivedate=16 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAn early experiment reported not the \"slightest difference\" in taste between ordinary and heavy water.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/citation/81/2098/273-a |title= CONCERNING THE TASTE OF HEAVY WATER|doi=10.1126/science.81.2098.273-a  |date=15 March 1935 |accessdate=14 August 2010 |volume=81 |issue= 2098|journal=Science |page=273|bibcode = 1935Sci....81..273U |pmid=17811065 | last1 = Urey | first1 = HC | last2 = Failla | first2 = G}}</ref> However, rats given a choice between distilled normal water and heavy water were able to avoid the heavy water based on smell, and it may have a different taste.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0031-9384(79)90124-0 |title= Taste responses to deuterium oxide | volume=23 |journal=Physiology |pages=69\u201374 |year=1979 | last1 = Miller | first1 = Inglis J. | last2 = Mooser | first2 = Gregory}}</ref>\n\nNo physical properties are listed for \"pure\" semi-heavy water, because it is unstable as a bulk liquid. In the liquid state, a few water molecules are always in an [[Self-ionisation of water|ionised state]], which means the hydrogen atoms can exchange among different oxygen atoms. Semi-heavy water could, in theory, be created via a chemical method, but it would rapidly transform into a dynamic mixture of 25% light water, 25% heavy water, and 50% semi-heavy water.  However, if it were made in the gas phase and directly [[Deposition (phase transition)|deposited]] into a solid, semi heavy water in the form of ice could be stable. This is due to collisions between water vapour molecules being almost completely negligible in the gas phase at standard temperatures, and once crystallized, collisions between the molecules cease altogether due to the rigid lattice structure of solid ice.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==History==\n[[Harold Urey]] discovered the isotope [[deuterium]] in 1931 and was later able to concentrate it in water.<ref>{{cite journal\n |author1=H.

For hydrogen, however, this is not true. The larger chemical isotope-effects seen between protium (light hydrogen) versus deuterium and [[tritium]] manifest because bond energies in chemistry are determined in quantum mechanics by equations in which the quantity of [[reduced mass]] of the nucleus and electrons appears. This quantity is altered in heavy-hydrogen compounds (of which deuterium oxide is the most common) more than for heavy-isotope substitution in other chemical elements{{why|date=October 2018}}. This isotope effect of heavy hydrogen is magnified further in biological systems, which are very sensitive to small changes in the solvent properties of water.\n\nHeavy water is the only known chemical substance that affects the period of [[circadian rhythm|circadian oscillations]], consistently increasing the length of each cycle. The effect is seen in unicellular organisms, green plants, isopods, insects, birds, mice, and hamsters.

Commercial-grade heavy water is slightly radioactive due to the presence of minute traces of natural tritium, but the same is true of ordinary water. Heavy water that has been used as a coolant in nuclear power plants contains substantially more tritium as a result of neutron bombardment of the deuterium in the heavy water ([[Tritium#Health risks|tritium is a health risk]] when ingested in large quantities).\n\nIn 1990, a disgruntled employee at the [[Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station]] in Canada obtained a sample (estimated as about a \"half cup\") of heavy water from the primary heat transport loop of the [[nuclear reactor]], and loaded it into a cafeteria drink dispenser. Eight employees drank some of the contaminated water. The incident was discovered when employees began leaving [[bioassay]] urine samples with elevated [[tritium]] levels. The quantity of heavy water involved was far below levels that could induce heavy water toxicity, but several employees received elevated radiation doses from tritium and neutron-activated chemicals in the water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecology.at/nni/site.php?site=Point++Lepreau |title=Point Lepreau in Canada |publisher=NNI (No Nukes Inforesource) |accessdate=10 September 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070710224724/http://www.ecology.at/nni/site.php?site=Point++Lepreau <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 10 July 2007}}</ref> This was not an incident of heavy water poisoning, but rather radiation poisoning from other isotopes in the heavy water.

This means that 1 in 6,400 hydrogen atoms is deuterium, which is 1 part in 3,200 by weight (hydrogen weight). The HDO may be separated from normal water by [[distillation]] or [[electrolysis]] and also by various chemical exchange processes, all of which exploit a [[kinetic isotope effect]]. With the partial enrichment also occurring in natural bodies of water under particular evaporation conditions.<ref>https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JZ068i017p05079 Isotopic exchange effects in the evaporation of water: 1. Low\u2010temperature experimental results H. Craig</ref>   (For more information about the isotopic distribution of deuterium in water, see [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]].) \nIn theory, deuterium for heavy water could be created in a nuclear reactor, but separation from ordinary water is the cheapest bulk production process.\n\nThe difference in mass between the two hydrogen isotopes translates into a difference in the [[zero-point energy]] and thus into a slight difference in the speed of the reaction. Once HDO becomes a significant fraction of the water, heavy water becomes more prevalent as water molecules trade hydrogen atoms very frequently. Production of pure heavy water by distillation or electrolysis requires a large cascade of stills or electrolysis chambers and consumes large amounts of power, so the chemical methods are generally preferred.\n\nThe most cost-effective process for producing heavy water is the dual temperature exchange sulfide process (known as the [[Girdler sulfide process]]) developed in parallel by [[Karl-Hermann Geib]] and [[Jerome S. Spevack]] in 1943.<ref name=HW>{{Cite report |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0206076.pdf |title=An Early History of Heavy Water |last=Waltham |first=Chris |publisher=[[University of British Columbia]] |date=August 1998 |accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative process,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=4620909 |title=Method for isotope replenishment in an exchange liquid used in a laser |accessdate=14 August 2010}}</ref> patented by Graham M.

Although the energy consumption for this process is much less than for the Girdler sulfide process, this method is currently uneconomical due to the expense of procuring the necessary hydrofluorocarbons.\n\nAs noted, modern commercial heavy water is almost universally referred to, and sold as, '''deuterium oxide'''.

AECL ordered two heavy water plants, which were built and operated in [[Atlantic Canada]] at [[Glace Bay]], [[Nova Scotia]] (by Deuterium of Canada Limited) and [[Port Hawkesbury]], Nova Scotia (by General Electric Canada). These plants proved to have significant design, construction and production problems. Consequently, AECL built the Bruce Heavy Water Plant ({{Coord|44.1854|-81.3618|type:landmark_region:CA|name=Bruce Heavy Water Plant|display=inline}}),<ref>Google Earth</ref> which it later sold to [[Ontario Hydro]], to ensure a reliable supply of heavy water for future power plants. The two Nova Scotia plants were shut down in 1985 when their production proved unnecessary.\n\nThe [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station|Bruce Heavy Water Plant]] (BHWP) in [[Ontario]] was the world's largest heavy water production plant with a capacity of 1600 tonnes per year at its peak (800 tonnes per year per full plant, two fully operational plants at its peak). It used the [[Girdler sulfide process]] to produce heavy water, and required 340,000 tonnes of feed water to produce one tonne of heavy water. It was part of a complex that included eight [[CANDU reactor]]s, which provided heat and power for the heavy water plant. The site was located at [[Douglas Point]]/[[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]] near Tiverton, Ontario on [[Lake Huron]] where it had access to the waters of the [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]].<ref name=\"CSR on BHWP decommissioning\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/EADDB84F-docs/report_e.pdf|publisher=Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission|accessdate=21 February 2018|date=March 2003}}</ref>\n\nAECL issued the construction contract in 1969 for the first BHWP unit (BHWP A). Commissioning of BHWP A was done by Ontario Hydro from 1971 through 1973, with the plant entering service on June 28, 1973 and design production capacity being achieved in April 1974. Due to the success of BHWP A and the large amount of heavy water that would be required for the large numbers of upcoming planned CANDU nuclear power plant construction projects, Ontario Hydro commissioned three additional heavy water production plants for the [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station|Bruce site]] (BHWP B, C, and D). BHWP B was placed into service in 1979. These first two plants were significantly more efficient than planned, and the number of CANDU construction projects ended up being significantly lower than originally planned, which led to the cancellation of construction on BHWP C & D. In 1984 BHWP A was shut down. By 1993 Ontario Hydro had produced enough heavy water to meet all of its anticipated domestic needs (which were lower than expected due to improved efficiency in the use and recycling of heavy water), so they shut down and demolished half of the capacity of BHWP B. The remaining capacity continued to operate in order to fulfill demand for heavy water exports until it was permanently shut down in 1997, after which the plant was gradually dismantled and the site cleared.<ref name=\"BHWP performance\">{{cite book|last1=DAVIDSON|first1=G.

It is still minimal enrichment. What is only unusual that the heavy water lie on the bottom, what is explained by paleo-lalake-history from colder dry past times -->\n\n==Applications==\n===Nuclear magnetic resonance===\nDeuterium oxide is used in [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] when using water as solvent if the [[nuclide]] of interest is hydrogen. This is because the signal from light-water (<sup>1</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O) solvent molecules interfere with observing the signal from the molecule of interest dissolved in it. Deuterium has a different [[magnetic moment]] and therefore does not contribute to the [[H-1 NMR|<sup>1</sup>H-NMR]] signal at the hydrogen-1 resonance frequency.\n\nFor some experiments, it may be desirable to identify the labile hydrogens on a compound, that is hydrogens that can easily exchange away as H<sup>+</sup> ions on some positions in a molecule.  With addition of D<sub>2</sub>O, sometimes referred to as a ''D<sub>2</sub>O shake'', labile hydrogens exchange away and are substituted by deuterium (<sup>2</sup>H) atoms. These positions in the molecule then do not appear in the <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum.\n\n===Organic chemistry===\nDeuterium oxide is often used as the source of deuterium for preparing specifically labelled [[isotopologue]]s of organic compounds. For example, C-H bonds adjacent to ketonic carbonyl groups can be replaced by C-D bonds, using acid or base catalysis. [[Trimethylsulfoxonium iodide]], made from [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] and [[methyl iodide]] can be recrystallized from deuterium oxide, and then dissociated to regenerate methyl iodide and dimethyl sulfoxide, both deuterium labelled. In cases where specific double labelling by deuterium and tritium is contemplated, the researcher must be aware that deuterium oxide, depending upon age and origin, can contain some tritium.\n\n===Fourier transform spectroscopy===\nDeuterium oxide is often used instead of water when collecting [[Fourier transform spectroscopy|FTIR]] spectra of proteins in solution. H<sub>2</sub>O creates a strong band that overlaps with the [[amide]] I region of proteins. The band from D<sub>2</sub>O is shifted away from the amide I region.\n\n===Neutron moderator===\nHeavy water is used in certain types of [[nuclear reactors]], where it acts as a [[neutron moderator]] to slow down neutrons so that they are more likely to react with the [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] than with [[uranium-238]], which captures neutrons without fissioning.\nThe CANDU reactor uses this design. Light water also acts as a moderator,  but because light water absorbs more [[neutron]]s than heavy water, reactors using light water for a reactor moderator must use [[enriched uranium]] rather than natural uranium, otherwise [[Critical mass|criticality]] is impossible. A significant fraction of outdated power reactors, such as the [[RBMK]] reactors in the USSR, were constructed using normal water for cooling but [[graphite-moderated reactor|graphite as a moderator]]. However, the danger of graphite in power reactors (graphite fires in part led to the [[Chernobyl disaster]]) has led to the discontinuation of graphite in standard reactor designs.\n\nBecause they do not require [[uranium enrichment]], [[heavy water reactor]]s are more of a concern in regards to [[nuclear proliferation]]. The breeding and extraction of plutonium can be a relatively rapid and cheap route to building a [[nuclear weapon]], as chemical separation of plutonium from fuel is easier than [[isotopic separation]] of U-235 from natural uranium.\nAmong current and past [[nuclear weapons states]], Israel, India, and North Korea<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/TRS407_scr/D407_scr1.pdf|title=HEAVY WATER REACTORS: STATUS AND PROJECTED DEVELOPMENT|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> first used plutonium from heavy water moderated reactors burning [[natural uranium]], while China, South Africa and Pakistan first built weapons using [[highly enriched uranium]].\n\nIn the U.S., however, the first experimental atomic reactor (1942), as well as the [[Manhattan Project]] Hanford production reactors that produced the plutonium for the [[Trinity test]] and [[Fat Man]] bombs, all used pure carbon (graphite) neutron moderators combined with normal water cooling pipes. They functioned with neither enriched uranium nor heavy water. Russian and British plutonium production also used graphite-moderated reactors.\n\nThere is no evidence that civilian heavy water power reactors\u2014such as the CANDU or [[Atucha I nuclear power plant|Atucha]] designs\u2014have been used to produce military fissile materials. In nations that do not already possess nuclear weapons, nuclear material at these facilities is under [[IAEA]] safeguards to discourage any diversion.\n\nDue to its potential for use in [[nuclear weapon]]s programs, the possession or import/export of large industrial quantities of heavy water are subject to government control in several countries. Suppliers of heavy water and heavy water production technology typically apply [[IAEA]] (International Atomic Energy Agency) administered safeguards and material accounting to heavy water. (In Australia, the ''Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987''.) In the U.S. and Canada, non-industrial quantities of heavy water (i.e., in the gram to kg range) are routinely available without special license through chemical supply dealers and commercial companies such as the world's former major producer [[Ontario Hydro]].\n\n===Neutrino detector===\nThe [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO) in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]] uses 1,000 tonnes of heavy water on loan from [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]]. The [[neutrino detector]] is {{convert|6800|ft|m}} underground in a mine, to shield it from [[muon]]s produced by [[cosmic ray]]s. SNO was built to answer the question of whether or not electron-type [[neutrino]]s produced by fusion in the [[Sun]] (the only type the Sun should be producing directly, according to theory) might be able to turn into other types of neutrinos on the way to Earth. SNO detects the [[Cherenkov radiation]] in the water from high-energy electrons produced from electron-type [[neutrino]]s as they undergo charged current (CC) interactions with [[neutron]]s in [[deuterium]], turning them into protons and electrons (however, only the electrons are fast enough to produce Cherenkov radiation for detection). SNO also detects neutrino\u2194electron scattering (ES) events, where the neutrino transfers energy to the electron, which then proceeds to generate Cherenkov radiation distinguishable from that produced by CC events. The first of these two reactions is produced only by electron-type neutrinos, while the second can be caused by all of the neutrino flavors. The use of deuterium is critical to the SNO function, because all three \"flavours\" (types) of neutrinos<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/sno/sno2.html |title=The SNO Detector |publisher=The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory Institute, Queen's University at Kingston |accessdate=10 September 2007}}</ref> may be detected in a third type of reaction as well, neutrino-disintegration, in which a neutrino of any type (electron, muon, or tau) scatters from a deuterium nucleus ([[deuteron]]), transferring enough energy to break up the loosely bound deuteron into a free [[neutron]] and [[proton]] via a neutral current (NC) interaction. This event is detected when the free neutron is absorbed by <sup>35</sup>Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> present from NaCl deliberately dissolved in the heavy water, causing emission of characteristic capture gamma rays. Thus, in this experiment, heavy water not only provides the transparent medium necessary to produce and visualize Cherenkov radiation, but it also provides deuterium to detect exotic mu type (\u03bc) and tau (\u03c4) neutrinos, as well as a non-absorbent moderator medium to preserve free neutrons from this reaction, until they can be absorbed by an easily detected neutron-activated isotope.\n\n===Metabolic rate testing in physiology and biology===\n{{main article|Doubly labeled water test}}\nHeavy water is employed as part of a mixture with H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O for a common and safe test of mean metabolic rate in humans and animals undergoing their normal activities.\n\n===Tritium production===\n{{See also|Tritium#Deuterium}}\n[[Tritium]] is the active substance in [[tritium illumination|self-powered lighting]] and controlled nuclear fusion, its other uses including [[autoradiography]] and [[radioactive label]]ing. It is also used in [[nuclear weapon design]] for [[boosted fission weapon]]s and [[tritium#Neutron initiator|initiators]]. Some tritium is created in [[heavy water moderated reactor]]s when deuterium captures a neutron. This reaction has a small [[Neutron cross-section|cross-section]] (probability of a single neutron-capture event) and produces only small amounts of tritium, although enough to justify cleaning tritium from the moderator every few years to reduce the environmental risk of tritium escape.\n\nProducing a lot of tritium in this way would require reactors with very high neutron fluxes, or with a very high proportion of heavy water to [[nuclear fuel]] and very low [[neutron absorption]] by other reactor material. The tritium would then have to be recovered by [[isotope separation]] from a much larger quantity of deuterium, unlike production from [[lithium-6]] (the present method), where only chemical separation is needed.\n\nDeuterium's absorption cross section for [[thermal neutron]]s is 0.52 milli[[barn (unit)|barns]] (5.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221232</sup> m<sup>2</sup>; 1 barn = 10<sup>\u221228</sup> m<sup>2</sup>), while those of [[oxygen-16]] and [[oxygen-17]] are 0.19 and 0.24 millibarns, respectively. <sup>17</sup>O makes up 0.038% of natural [[oxygen]], making the overall cross section 0.28 millibarns. Therefore, in D<sub>2</sub>O with natural oxygen, 21% of [[neutron capture]]s are on oxygen, rising higher as <sup>17</sup>O builds up from neutron capture on <sup>16</sup>O. Also, <sup>17</sup>O may emit an [[alpha particle]] on neutron capture, producing radioactive [[carbon-14]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Water}}\n* [[Cold fusion]]\n* [[Interstellar ice]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/mv_heavywater.htm Heavy Water] and [http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/mv_heavywater_part2.htm Heavy Water \u2013 Part II] at ''[[The Periodic Table of Videos]]'' (University of Nottingham)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160227012413/http://fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/heavy.htm Heavy Water Production], Federation of American Scientists\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040721172828/http://www.cns-snc.ca/Bulletin/A_Miller_Heavy_Water.pdf Heavy Water: A Manufacturer\u2019s Guide for the Hydrogen Century]\n* [http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mheavywater.html Is \"heavy water\" dangerous?] Straight Dope Staff Report. 9 December 2003\n* [http://alsos.wlu.edu/qsearch.aspx?browse=science/Heavy+Water Annotated bibliography for heavy water from the Alsos Digital Library for Nuclear Issues]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071216010940/http://www.popsci.com/popsci/how20/a07160a72252c010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html Ice is supposed to float, but with a little heavy water, you can make cubes that sink]\n* [http://www.o8ode.ru/article/eng/Isotopic_effects_of_heavy_water_in_biological_objects Isotopic Effects of Heavy Water in Biological Objects] Oleg Mosin, Ignat Ignatov\n* [http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/41/3/10.1063/1.1725946 J.

This academic discipline also studies the cultural, economic, and political impacts of scientific innovation.\n\n[[Historiography of science|Histories of science]] were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, starting primarily with [[William Whewell]], as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public. In the early 1930s, after a famous paper given by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] historian [[Boris Hessen]], was focused into looking at the ways in which scientific practices were allied with the needs and motivations of their context. After [[World War&nbsp;II]], extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline, with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world. In the 1960s, especially in the wake of the work done by [[Thomas Kuhn]], the discipline began to serve a very different function, and began to be used as a way to critically examine the scientific enterprise. At the present time it is often closely aligned with the field of [[science studies]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nModern engineering as it is understood today took form during the [[scientific revolution]], though much of the mathematics and science was built on the work of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Mesopotamia]]ns, [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese]], [[Science and technology in ancient India|Indians]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} See the main articles [[History of science]] and [[History of technology]] for these respective topics.\n\n== Universities with HST programs ==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n* [[Buenos Aires Institute of Technology]], Argentina, has been offering courses on History of the Technology and the Science.\n* [[National Technological University]], Argentina, has a complete history program on its offered careers.\n\n=== Australia ===\n* [[The University of Sydney]] offers both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in the History and Philosophy of Science, run by the Unit for the History and Philosophy of Science, within the Science Faculty.

On one side are [[anti-de Sitter space]]s (AdS) which are used in theories of [[quantum gravity]], formulated in terms of [[string theory]] or [[M-theory]]. On the other side of the correspondence are [[conformal field theory|conformal field theories]] (CFT) which are [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]], including theories similar to the [[Yang\u2013Mills theory|Yang\u2013Mills theories]] that describe elementary particles.\n\nThe duality represents a major advance in our understanding of string theory and quantum gravity.<ref name=\"de Haro et al. 2013, p.2\">de Haro et al. 2013, p. 2</ref> This is because it provides a [[non-perturbative]] formulation of string theory with certain [[boundary condition]]s and because it is the most successful realization of the [[holographic principle]], an idea in quantum gravity originally proposed by [[Gerard 't Hooft]] and promoted by [[Leonard Susskind]].\n\nIt also provides a powerful toolkit for studying [[coupling (physics)|strongly coupled]] quantum field theories.<ref>Klebanov and Maldacena 2009</ref> Much of the usefulness of the duality results from the fact that it is a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[condensed matter physics]] by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence was first proposed by [[Juan Maldacena]] in late 1997. Important aspects of the correspondence were elaborated in articles by [[Steven Gubser]], [[Igor Klebanov]], and [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov]], and by [[Edward Witten]]. By 2015, Maldacena's article had over 10,000 citations, becoming the most highly cited article in the field of [[high energy physics]].<ref name=\"inspire\">{{cite web |url= https://inspirehep.net/info/hep/stats/topcites/2014/alltime.html |title=Top Cited Articles of All Time (2014 edition) | publisher= [[INSPIRE-HEP]] |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | accessdate=26 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Black hole entropy==\n{{Main article|Black hole thermodynamics}}\nAn object with relatively high [[entropy]] is microscopically random, like a hot gas. A known configuration of classical fields has zero entropy: there is nothing random about [[Electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s, or [[gravitational wave]]s. Since black holes are exact solutions of [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's equations]], they were thought not to have any entropy either.\n\nBut [[Jacob Bekenstein]] noted that this leads to a violation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. If one throws a hot gas with entropy into a black hole, once it crosses the [[event horizon]], the entropy would disappear. The random properties of the gas would no longer be seen once the black hole had absorbed the gas and settled down. One way of salvaging the second law is if black holes are in fact random objects with an [[entropy]] that increases by an amount greater than the entropy of the consumed gas.\n\nBekenstein assumed that black holes are maximum entropy objects\u2014that they have more entropy than anything else in the same volume. In a sphere of radius ''R'', the entropy in a relativistic gas increases as the energy increases. The only known limit is [[gravitation]]al; when there is too much energy [entropy?] the gas collapses into a black hole. Bekenstein used <!-- Redshift~golden number~greenshift  -->this to put an [[Bekenstein bound|upper bound]] on the entropy in a region of space, and the bound was proportional to the area of the region. He concluded that the black hole entropy is directly proportional to the area of the [[event horizon]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jacob D. |last=Bekenstein |title=Universal upper bound on the entropy-to-energy ratio for bounded systems |journal=Physical Review D |volume=23 |issue=215 |pages=287\u2013298 |date=January 1981 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.23.287 |bibcode = 1981PhRvD..23..287B }}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen Hawking]] had shown earlier that the total horizon area of a collection of black holes always increases with time. The horizon is a boundary defined by light-like [[geodesics]]; it is those light rays that are just barely unable to escape. If neighboring geodesics start moving toward each other they eventually collide, at which point their extension is inside the black hole. So the geodesics are always moving apart, and the number of geodesics which generate the boundary, the area of the horizon, always increases. Hawking's result was called the second law of [[black hole thermodynamics]], by analogy with the [[Second law of thermodynamics|law of entropy increase]], but at first, he did not take the analogy too seriously.\n\nHawking knew that if the horizon area were an actual entropy, black holes would have to radiate. When heat is added to a thermal system, the change in entropy is the increase in [[mass-energy]] divided by temperature:\n::<math>\n{\\rm d}S = \\frac{{\\rm\\delta }M \\ c^2}{T}.\n</math>\n(Here  the term ''\u03b4M&nbsp;c<sup>2</sup>'' is  substituted for  the thermal energy added to the system, generally by non-integrable random processes, in contrast to d''S'', which is a function of a few \"state variables\" only,  i.e. in conventional thermodynamics only of the  [[Kelvin]] temperature ''T'' and a few additional state variables as, e.g., the pressure)\n\nIf black holes have a finite entropy, they should also have a finite temperature. In particular, they would come to equilibrium with a thermal gas of photons. This means that black holes would not only absorb photons, but they would also have to emit them in the right amount to maintain [[detailed balance]].\n\nTime-independent solutions to field equations do not emit radiation, because a time-independent background conserves energy. Based on this principle, Hawking set out to show that black holes do not radiate. But, to his surprise, a careful analysis convinced him that [[Hawking radiation|they do]], and in just the right way to come to equilibrium with a gas at a finite temperature. Hawking's calculation fixed the constant of proportionality at 1/4; the entropy of a black hole is one quarter its horizon area in [[Planck units]].<ref>{{cite journal | first = Parthasarathi | last = Majumdar | title = Black Hole Entropy and Quantum Gravity | arxiv = gr-qc/9807045 | journal =   Indian Journal of Physics Section B| date = 1998|bibcode = 1999InJPB..73..147M | volume = 73 | issue = 2 |page=147 }}</ref>\n\nThe entropy is proportional to the [[logarithm]] of the number of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]], the ways a system can be configured microscopically while leaving the macroscopic description unchanged.

The infalling and outgoing mass/energy interact only when they cross.

Their [[gravitational field]] would deform the horizon of the black hole, and the deformed horizon could produce different outgoing particles than the undeformed horizon. When a particle falls into a black hole, it is boosted relative to an outside observer, and its gravitational field assumes a universal form. 't Hooft showed that this field makes a logarithmic tent-pole shaped bump on the horizon of a black hole, and like a shadow, the bump is an alternative description of the particle's location and mass. For a four-dimensional spherical uncharged black hole, the deformation of the horizon is similar to the type of deformation which describes the emission and absorption of particles on a string-theory [[Worldsheet|world sheet]]. Since the deformations on the surface are the only imprint of the incoming particle, and since these deformations would have to completely determine the outgoing particles, 't Hooft believed that the correct description of the black hole would be by some form of string theory.\n\nThis idea was made more precise by Leonard Susskind, who had also been developing holography, largely independently. Susskind argued that the oscillation of the horizon of a black hole is a complete description{{refn|\"Complete description\" means all the ''primary'' qualities.  For example, [[John Locke]] (and before him [[Robert Boyle]]) determined these to be ''size, shape, motion, number, ''and'' solidity''. Such ''secondary quality'' information as ''color, aroma, taste ''and'' sound'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=Daniel|title=Consciousness Explained|date=1991|publisher=Back Bay Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-316-18066-5|page=371|title-link=Consciousness Explained}}</ref> or internal quantum state is not information that is implied to be preserved in the surface fluctuations of the event horizon. (See however \"path integral quantization\")|group=note}} of both the infalling and outgoing matter, because the world-sheet theory of string theory was just such a holographic description. While short strings have zero entropy, he could identify long highly excited string states with ordinary black holes. This was a deep advance because it revealed that strings have a classical interpretation in terms of black holes.\n\nThis work showed that the black hole information paradox is resolved when quantum gravity is described in an unusual string-theoretic way assuming the string-theoretical description is complete, unambiguous and non-redundant.<ref>{{cite arXiv| first = L. | last = Susskind  |eprint=hep-th/0302219 |title = The Anthropic landscape of string theory  |date= February 2003 }}</ref> The space-time in quantum gravity would emerge as an effective description of the theory of oscillations of a lower-dimensional black-hole horizon, and suggest that any black hole with appropriate properties, not just strings, would serve as a basis for a description of string theory.\n\nIn 1995, Susskind, along with collaborators [[Tom Banks (physicist)|Tom Banks]], [[Willy Fischler]], and [[Stephen Shenker]], presented a formulation of the new [[M-theory]] using a holographic description in terms of charged point black holes, the D0 [[Membrane (M-theory)|branes]] of [[Type II string theory|type IIA string theory]]. The matrix theory they proposed was first suggested as a description of two branes in 11-dimensional [[supergravity]] by [[Bernard de Wit]], [[Jens Hoppe]], and [[Hermann Nicolai]]. The later authors reinterpreted the same matrix models as a description of the dynamics of point black holes in particular limits. Holography allowed them to conclude that the dynamics of these black holes give a complete [[non-perturbative]] formulation of M-theory. In 1997, [[Juan Maldacena]] gave the first holographic descriptions of a higher-dimensional object, the 3+1-dimensional [[Type II string theory|type IIB]] [[Membrane (M-theory)|membrane]], which resolved a long-standing problem of finding a string description which describes a [[gauge theory]]. These developments simultaneously explained how string theory is related to some forms of supersymmetric quantum field theories.\n\n==Limit on information density==\n\nEntropy, if considered as information (see [[information entropy]]), is measured in [[bit]]s. The total quantity of bits is related to the total [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of matter/energy.\n\nFor a given energy in a given volume, there is an upper limit to the density of information (the [[Bekenstein bound]]) about the whereabouts of all the particles which compose matter in that volume, suggesting that matter itself cannot be subdivided infinitely many times and there must be an ultimate level of [[elementary particle|fundamental particles]]. As the [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of a particle are the product of all the degrees of freedom of its sub-particles, were a particle to have infinite subdivisions into lower-level particles, the degrees of freedom of the original particle would be infinite, violating the maximal limit of entropy density. The holographic principle thus implies that the subdivisions must stop at some level, and that the fundamental particle is a bit (1 or 0) of information.\n\nThe most rigorous realization of the holographic principle is the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] by [[Juan Maldacena]]. However, J.D. Brown and [[Marc Henneaux]] had rigorously proved already in 1986, that the asymptotic symmetry of 2+1 dimensional gravity gives rise to a [[Virasoro algebra]], whose corresponding quantum theory is a 2-dimensional conformal field theory.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=J.

In his 2003 article published in [[Scientific American]] magazine, [[Jacob Bekenstein]] speculatively summarized a current trend started by [[John Archibald Wheeler]], which suggests scientists may \"regard the physical world as made of [[information]], with energy and matter as incidentals\". Bekenstein asks \"Could we, as [[William Blake]] memorably penned, 'see a world in a grain of sand', or is that idea no more than '[[poetic license]]'?\",<ref>[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/information-in-the-hologr-2003-08 Information in the Holographic Universe<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> referring to the holographic principle.\n\n===Unexpected connection===\n\nBekenstein's topical overview \"A Tale of Two Entropies\"<ref>http://ref-sciam.livejournal.com/1190.html</ref> describes potentially profound implications of Wheeler's trend, in part by noting a previously unexpected connection between the world of [[information theory]] and classical physics. This connection was first described shortly after the seminal 1948 papers of American applied mathematician [[Claude E. Shannon]] introduced today's most widely used measure of information content, now known as [[Shannon entropy]]. As an objective measure of the quantity of information, Shannon entropy has been enormously useful, as the design of all modern communications and data storage devices, from cellular phones to [[modems]] to hard disk drives and [[DVD]]s, rely on Shannon entropy.\n\nIn [[thermodynamics]] (the branch of physics dealing with heat), entropy is popularly described as a measure of the \"[[Order and disorder (physics)|disorder]]\" in a physical system of matter and energy. In 1877 Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] described it more precisely in terms of the ''number of distinct microscopic states'' that the particles composing a macroscopic \"chunk\" of matter could be in, while still ''looking'' like the same macroscopic \"chunk\". As an example, for the air in a room, its thermodynamic entropy would equal the logarithm of the count of all the ways that the individual gas molecules could be distributed in the room, and all the ways they could be moving.\n\n===Energy, matter, and information equivalence===\n\nShannon's efforts to find a way to quantify the information contained in, for example, a telegraph message, led him unexpectedly to a formula with the same form as [[Boltzmann's entropy formula|Boltzmann's]]. In an article in the August 2003 issue of Scientific American titled \"Information in the Holographic Universe\", Bekenstein summarizes that \"Thermodynamic entropy and Shannon entropy are conceptually equivalent: the number of arrangements that are counted by Boltzmann entropy reflects the amount of Shannon information one would need to implement any particular arrangement\" of matter and energy. The only salient difference between the thermodynamic entropy of physics and Shannon's entropy of information is in the units of measure; the former is expressed in units of energy divided by temperature, the latter in ''essentially dimensionless'' \"bits\" of information.\n\nThe holographic principle states that the entropy of ''ordinary mass'' (not just black holes) is also proportional to surface area and not volume; that volume itself is illusory and the universe is really a [[hologram]] which is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the information \"inscribed\" on the surface of its boundary.<ref name=\"sciam2003\"/>\n\n==Experimental tests==\nThe [[Fermilab]] physicist [[Craig Hogan]] claims that the holographic principle would imply quantum fluctuations in spatial position<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hogan |first=Craig J. |year=2008 |title=Measurement of quantum fluctuations in geometry |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=77 |issue=10 |page=104031 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.77.104031 |arxiv=0712.3419 |postscript=<!--None--> |bibcode = 2008PhRvD..77j4031H }}.</ref> that would lead to apparent background noise or \"holographic noise\" measurable at gravitational wave detectors, in particular [[GEO 600]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Chown|first=Marcus|title=Our world may be a giant hologram|newspaper=NewScientist|date=15 January 2009|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126911.300|accessdate=2010-04-19}}</ref> However these claims have not been widely accepted, or cited, among quantum gravity researchers and appear to be in direct conflict with string theory calculations.<ref>\"Consequently, he ends up with inequalities of the type...

It also made inroads into the northern parts of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (now [[Slovakia]]), but was rejected and gained infamy for the plundering behavior of the Hussite soldiers.<ref name='Spiesz 52'>Spiesz ''et al.'' 2006, p. 52.</ref><ref>Bartl 2002, p. 45.</ref><ref name='Kirschbaum 2005 48'>Kirschbaum 2005, p. 48.</ref><ref>Spiesz ''et al.'' 2006, p. 53.</ref> There were also very small temporary communities in [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union|Poland-Lithuania]] and [[Transylvania]] which moved to Bohemia after being confronted with religious intolerance. It was a regional movement that failed to expand anywhere farther. Hussites emerged as a majority [[Utraquist]] movement with a significant [[Taborite]] faction, and smaller regional ones that included [[Adamites]], [[Orebites]] and [[Sirotci|Orphans]]. Major Hussite theologians included [[Petr Chelcicky]], [[Jerome of Prague]], and others. A number of Czech national heroes were Hussite, including [[Jan Zizka]], who led a fierce resistance to five consecutive crusades proclaimed on Hussite Bohemia by the [[Papacy]]. Hussites were one of the most important forerunners of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. This predominantly religious movement was propelled by social issues and strengthened [[Czechs|Czech]] national awareness.\n\nAfter the [[Council of Constance]] lured Jan Hus in with a letter of indemnity, then tried him for heresy and put him to death at the stake on 6 July 1415,<ref>Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article \"Constance, Council of\"</ref> the Hussites fought the [[Hussite Wars]] (1420\u20131434) for their religious and political cause. After the [[Hussite Wars]] ended, the [[Catholic]]-supported [[Utraquist]] side came out victorious from conflict with the [[Taborites]] and became the most common representation of the Hussite faith in Bohemia. Catholics and Utraquists were emancipated in Bohemia after the [[religious peace of Kutn\u00e1 Hora]] in 1485.\n\n[[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], or what is now the territory of the [[Czech Republic]], remained majority Hussite for two centuries until [[Roman Catholicism]] was reimposed by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] after the 1620 [[Battle of White Mountain]] during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Due to this event and centuries of [[Habsburg]] persecution, Hussite traditions are merely represented in the [[Moravian Church]], [[Unity of the Brethren]], and the refounded [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church|Czechoslovak Hussite]] churches among present-day [[Christians]].<ref name=\"N\u0115mec\">N\u0115mec, Ludv\u00edk \"The Czechoslovak heresy and schism: the emergence of a national Czechoslovak church,\" American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, 1975, {{ISBN|0-87169-651-7}}</ref>\n\n==Impact of Hus's death on Bohemia==\n{{main|Jan Hus|Bohemian Reformation}}\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = Pravda v\u00edt\u011bz\u00ed ([[Truth prevails]])\n |author = \u2014 [[Jan Hus]] ([[motto]] of the [[Czech Republic]])\n |align=left\n}}\n[[File:Muttich, Kamil Vladislav - Mistr Jan Hus na hranici v Kostnici 1415.jpg|thumb|left|Execution of [[Jan Hus]] (1415) that sparked outrage in the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]]]\n[[File:Hussites.gif|thumb|right|200px|Evolution of the Hussite movement in the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] from 1419 to 1620, superimposed on modern borders]]\n\nThe arrest of Hus in 1414 caused considerable resentment in [[Czech lands]]. The authorities of both countries appealed urgently and repeatedly to [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|King Sigismund]] to release Jan Hus.\n\nWhen news of his death at the [[Council of Constance]] in 1415 arrived, disturbances broke out, directed primarily against the [[clergy]] and especially against the monks. Even the Archbishop narrowly escaped from the effects of this popular anger. The treatment of Hus was felt to be a disgrace inflicted upon the whole country and his death was seen as a criminal act. King [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia|Wenceslaus]], prompted by his grudge against Sigismund, at first gave free vent to his indignation at the course of events in [[Constance]]. His wife openly favoured the friends of Hus. Avowed Hussites stood at the head of the government.\n\nA league was formed by certain lords,{{Who|date=April 2011}} who pledged themselves to protect the free preaching of the Gospel upon all their possessions and estates and to obey the power of the Bishops only where their orders accorded with the injunctions of the [[Bible]]. The university would arbitrate any disputed points. The entire Hussite nobility joined the league. Other than verbal protest of the council's treatment of Hus, there was little evidence of any actions taken by the nobility until 1417. At that point several of the lesser nobility and some barons, signatories of the 1415 protest letter, removed Romanist priests from their parishes, replacing them with priests willing to give communion in both wine and bread. The chalice of wine became the central identifying symbol of the Hussite movement.<ref>John Klassen, The Nobility and the Making of the Hussite Revolution(East European Quarterly/Columbia University Press, 1978)</ref> If the king had joined, its resolutions would have received the sanction of the law; but he refused, and approached the newly formed Roman Catholic League of lords, whose members pledged themselves to support the king, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], and the Council. The prospect of a civil war began to emerge.\n\n[[Pope Martin V]] as Cardinal Otto of [[Colonna]] had attacked Hus with relentless severity. He energetically resumed the battle against Hus's teaching after the enactments of the [[Council of Constance]].

From the beginning, there formed two parties, with a smaller number of people withdrawing from both parties around the pacifist [[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd]], whose teachings would form the foundation of the [[Unitas Fratrum]].\n\nThe moderate party, who followed Hus more closely, sought to conduct reform while leaving the whole hierarchical and liturgical order of the Church untouched.\n\nThe more radical party{{clarify|date=May 2014}}<!--Did this party have a name? If so, it would be good to use it here and elsewhere to keep all these parties clear in the (average) reader's mind. It's really not clear how many parties there were or what they were.--> identified itself more boldly with the doctrines of [[John Wycliffe]], sharing his passionate hatred of the [[monasticism|monastic]] clergy, and his desire to return the Church to its supposed condition during the time of the apostles. This required the removal of the existing hierarchy and the secularisation of ecclesiastical possessions. The radicals preached the ''\"sufficientia legis Christi\"''\u2014the divine law (i.e. the [[Bible]]) is the sole rule and canon for human society, not only in the church, but also in political and civil matters. They rejected therefore, as early as 1416, everything that they believed had no basis in the Bible, such as the [[veneration]] of saints and images, [[fasting|fasts]], superfluous holidays, the oath, intercession for the dead, auricular [[Confession (religion)|Confession]], [[indulgence]]s, the sacraments of [[Confirmation]] and the [[Anointing of the Sick]]; they admitted laymen and women{{citation needed|reason=women in preachers office|date=August 2015}} to the preacher's office, and chose their own priests. But above all they clung to Wycliffe's doctrine of the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]], denying [[transubstantiation]], and this is the principal point by which they are distinguished from the moderate party.\n\n===Four Articles of Prague===\nThe programme of the more conservative Hussites (the moderate party)<!--\"The moderate party\" was added to make it clear which of the two parties this was.

Their first armed assault fell on the small town of \u00dast\u00ed, on the river Lu\u017enice, south of Prague (today's [[Sezimovo \u00dast\u00ed]]). However, as the place did not prove to be defensible, they settled in the remains of an older town upon a hill not far away and founded a new town, which they named [[T\u00e1bor]] (after the traditional name of the mountain on which Jesus was expected to return; see [[Mark 13]]); hence they were called T\u00e1borit\u00e9 ([[Taborite]]s). They comprised the essential force of the radical Hussites. Their aim was to destroy the enemies of the law of God, and to defend his kingdom (which had been expected to come in a short time) by the sword. Their end-of-world visions did not come true. In order to preserve their settlement and spread their ideology, they waged bloody wars; in the beginning they observed a strict regime, inflicting the severest punishment equally for murder, as for less severe faults as adultery, perjury and [[usury]], and also tried to apply rigid Biblical standards to the social order of the time. The Taborites usually had the support of the [[Orebites]] (later called Orphans), an eastern Bohemian sect of Hussitism based in [[Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]].\n\n===Diversity===\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=horizontal\n|width1=100\n|image1=Prague banner c1477.png\n|caption1=Banner used by [[Prague Hussites]]\n|width2=200\n|image2=Tabori.jpg\n|caption2=Banner used by [[Taborites]]\n|width3=200\n|image3=Sirotci 2.jpg\n|caption3=Banner used by [[Sirotci|Orphans]]}}\n\nHussites were not a unitary movement, but a diverse one with multiple factions that held different views and opposed each other in the [[Hussite Wars]].\n\nHussites can be divided into:\n\n*[[Moderate Hussites]]\n**[[Prague Hussites]]\n**[[Bohemian nobility|Bohemian Hussite nobility]]\n**[[Hussites of \u017datec and Louny]]\n**other [[Utraquists]]/[[Calixtines]]\n*[[Radical Hussites]]\n**[[Taborites]] \n**[[Orebites]]\n**[[Adamites]]\n**[[Sirotci|Orphans]]\n**[[Unity of the Brethren]] (founded in the middle 15th century)\n**other Radical Hussites\n\n==History==\n===Hussite Wars (1419\u20131434)===\n{{Main article|Hussite Wars}}\n[[Image:Ussita pavese shield Prag Museum 1429.jpg|right|thumb|Recreation of Hussite [[pavise]] from an original in the [[National Museum (Prague)|Museum of Prague]]]]\n[[File:Husit\u00e9 - Jensk\u00fd kodex.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Painting of battle between mounted knights|Battle between Hussites and Catholic [[crusade]]rs; Jena Codex, 15th century]]\nThe news of the death of King Wenceslaus in 1419 produced a great commotion among the people of Prague. A revolution swept over the country: churches and monasteries were destroyed, and church property was seized by the Hussite nobility. It was then, and remained till much later, in question whether Bohemia was a hereditary or an elective monarchy, especially as the line through which Sigismund claimed the throne had accepted that the Kingdom of Bohemia was an elective monarchy elected by the nobles, and thus the regent of the kingdom (\u010cen\u011bk of Wartenberg) also explicitly stated that Sigismund had not been elected as reason for Sigismund's claim to not be accepted. Sigismund could get possession of \"his\" kingdom only by force of arms. Pope Martin V called upon Catholics of the West to take up arms against the Hussites, declaring a crusade, and there followed twelve years of [[Hussite Wars|warfare]].\n\nThe Hussites initially campaigned defensively, but after 1427 they assumed the offensive. Apart from their religious aims, they fought for the national interests of the Czechs. The moderate and radical parties were united, and they not only repelled the attacks of the army of [[crusade]]rs but crossed the borders into neighboring countries. On March 23, 1430, [[Joan of Arc]] dictated a letter<ref>[http://archive.joan-of-arc.org/joanofarc_letter_march_23_1430.html Joan of Arc Letter of March 23, 1430]</ref> that threatened to lead a crusading army against the Hussites unless they returned to the Catholic faith, but her capture by English and Burgundian troops two months later would keep her from carrying out this threat.\n\n====The Council of Basel and Compacta of Prague====\n{{main|Council of Basel|Basel Compacts}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nEventually, the opponents of the Hussites found themselves forced to consider an amicable settlement. They invited a Bohemian embassy to appear at the [[Council of Basel]]. The discussions began on 10 January 1432, centering chiefly on the four articles of [[Prague]]. No agreement emerged. After repeated negotiations between the Basel Council and Bohemia, a Bohemian\u2013Moravian state assembly in Prague accepted the ''\"Compacta\"'' of Prague on 30 November 1433. The agreement granted communion in both kinds to all who desired it, but with the understanding that Christ was entirely present in each kind. Free preaching was granted conditionally: the Church hierarchy had to approve and place priests, and the power of the bishop must be considered. The article which prohibited the secular power of the clergy was almost reversed.\n\nThe Taborites refused to conform. The Calixtines united with the Roman Catholics and destroyed the Taborites at the [[Battle of Lipany]] on (30 May 1434). From that time, the Taborites lost their importance, though the Hussite movement would continue in [[Poland]] for another five years, until the Royalist forces of Poland defeated the Polish Hussites at the [[Battle of Grotniki]]. The state assembly of [[Jihlava]] in 1436 confirmed the ''\"Compacta\"'' and gave them the sanction of law. This accomplished the reconciliation of Bohemia with Rome and the Western Church, and at last Sigismund obtained possession of the Bohemian crown. His reactionary measures caused a ferment in the whole country, but he died in 1437. The state assembly in Prague rejected Wyclif's doctrine of the Lord's Supper, which was obnoxious to the [[Utraquists]], as heresy in 1444. Most of the Taborites now went over to the party of the Utraquists; the rest joined the \"Brothers of the Law of Christ\" ({{lang-la|\"Unitas Fratrum\"}}) (see [[Unity of the Brethren]]; also [[Bohemian Brethren]] and [[Moravian Church]]).\n\n===Hussite Bohemia, Luther and the Reformation (1434\u20131618)===\n{{see also|Martin Luther|Reformation}}\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = We are all Hussites, without having been aware of it.\n |author = \u2014 [[Martin Luther]] about himself and [[Protestants]]<ref>https://www.luther2017.de/en/reformation/and-its-people/jan-hus/</ref>\n |align=left\n}}\n[[File:Stevens P.

In the coming years, [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravia]] were [[Counter-Reformation|forcibly converted]] from [[Hussitism]] to [[Roman Catholicism]] by the [[Habsburgs]].]]\nIn 1462, [[Pope Pius II]] declared the ''\"Compacta\"'' null and void, prohibited communion in both kinds, and acknowledged King [[George of Podebrady]] as king on condition that he would promise an unconditional harmony with the Roman Church. This he refused, but his successor, King [[Ladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II]], favored the Roman Catholics and proceeded against some zealous clergymen of the Calixtines. The troubles of the Utraquists increased from year to year. In 1485, at the [[Religious peace of Kutn\u00e1 Hora|Diet of Kutn\u00e1 Hora]], an agreement was made between the Roman Catholics and Utraquists that lasted for thirty-one years. It was only later, at the Diet of 1512, that the equal rights of both religions were permanently established. The appearance of [[Martin Luther]] was hailed by the Utraquist clergy, and Luther himself was astonished to find so many points of agreement between the doctrines of Hus and his own. But not all Utraquists approved of the German [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]; a schism arose among them, and many returned to the Roman doctrine, while other elements had organised the ''\"[[Unitas Fratrum]]\"'' already in 1457.\n\n===Bohemian Revolt and harsh persecution under the Habsburgs (1618\u20131918)===\n{{main|Bohemian Revolt|Battle of the White Mountain|Thirty Years' War|Counter-Reformation|Anti-Protestantism|History of the Moravian Church}}\nUnder Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]], the Bohemian state assembly established the ''\"[[Confessio Bohemica]]\"'', upon which Lutherans, Reformed, and Bohemian Brethren agreed. From that time forward Hussitism began to die out. After the [[Battle of the White Mountain|Battle of White Mountain]] on 8 November 1620 the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Faith]] was re-established with vigour, which fundamentally changed the religious conditions of the [[Czech lands]].\n\nLeaders and members of [[Unitas Fratrum]] were forced to choose to either leave the many and varied southeastern principalities of what was the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (mainly [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and parts of Germany and its many states), or to practice their beliefs secretly. As a result, members were forced underground and dispersed across northwestern Europe. The largest remaining communities of the Brethren were located in Lissa ([[Leszno]]) in Poland, which had historically strong ties with the Czechs, and in small, isolated groups in Moravia. Some, among them [[Jan Amos Comenius]], fled to western Europe, mainly the [[Low Countries]]. A settlement of Hussites in [[Herrnhut]], Saxony, now Germany, in 1722 caused the emergence of the [[Moravian Church]].\n\n===Post-Habsburg era and modern times (1918\u2013present)===\n{{main|Moravian Church|Unity of the Brethren|Czechoslovak Hussite Church}}\nIn 1918, as a result of [[World War I]], the [[Czech lands]] regained independence from [[Austria-Hungary]] controlled by the [[Habsburg monarchy]] as [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\nToday, the [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] claims to be the modern successor of the Hussite tradition.<ref name=\"N\u0115mec\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity|Religion|History|Czech Republic}}\n* [[Hussite Bible]]\n* [[Pavel Krava\u0159]]\n* [[Waldensians]]\n*[[Arnoldists]]\n*[[Lollards]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[[Howard Kaminsky]]. \"A History of the Hussite Revolution,\" University of California Press, 1967. \n* Fudge, Thomas A., ''The Magnificent Ride: The First Reformation in Hussite Bohemia'', Ashgate, 1998.\n* Fudge, Thomas A., ''The Crusade against Heretics in Bohemia'', Ashgate, 2002. \n* Ond\u0159ej, Brodu, \"Trakt\u00e1t mistra Ond\u0159eje z Brodu o p\u016fvodu husit\u016f\" ({{lang-la|\"Visiones Ioannis, archiepiscopi Pragensis, et earundem explicaciones, alias Tractatus de origine Hussitarum\"}}), Muzem husitsk\u00e9ho revolu\u010dn\u00edho hnut\u00ed, T\u00e1bor, 1980, {{OCLC|28333729}} in {{La icon}} with introduction in {{Cs icon}}\n*Mathies, Christiane, \"Kurf\u00fcrstenbund und K\u00f6nigtum in der Zeit der Hussitenkriege: die kurf\u00fcrstliche Reichspolitik gegen Sigmund im Kraftzentrum Mittelrhein,\" Selbstverlag der Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Mittelrheinische Kirchengeschichte, Mainz, 1978, {{OCLC|05410832}} in {{De icon}}\n*Bezold, Friedrich von, \"K\u00f6nig Sigmund und die Reichskriege gegen die Husiten,\" G.

He is considered by many Orthodox Christians as the [[patron saint]] of North America.<ref name=Walsh>Walsh, p. 261.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\nBiographers disagree about Herman\u2019s early life. His official biography, which Valaam Monastery published in 1867, said that his pre-monastic name was unknown, but that Herman was born into a merchant\u2019s family in [[Serpukhov]], a city in [[Moscow Governorate]]. He was said to later become a novice at the [[Trinity-St. Sergius Hermitage]] near [[St. Petersburg]] before going to [[Valaam]] to complete his training and receive full tonsure as a monk.<ref>''Little Russian Philokalia,'' p. 21.</ref> But, modern biographer Sergei Korsun found this account to be based on erroneous information provided by [[Semyon Yanovsky]], an administrator from 1818 through part of 1820 of the [[Russian-American Company]] (RAC) in Alaska. He confused Herman\u2019s biographical information with that of another monk, Joseph (Telepnev).<ref>Korsun, p. x.</ref>\n\nAnother former RAC Chief Manager, [[Ferdinand von Wrangel]], stated Herman was originally from a prosperous peasant family in the [[Voronezh Governorate]] and served in the military. He then entered monastic life as a novice at [[Sarov]] Monastery. This concurred with testimony of Archimandrite Theophan (Sokolov), and a letter written by Herman himself. These agree that Herman began his monastic life as a novice at Sarov, and later received the full tonsure at [[Valaam]].<ref>Korsun, p. xi.</ref> A young military clerk named '''Egor Ivanovich Popov,''' from the [[Voronezh Governorate]], was tonsured with the name 'Herman' at Valaam in 1782.<ref>Korsun, p. 5.</ref>\n\nAll biographers agree that at Valaam, Herman studied under Abbot Nazarius, previously of Sarov Monastery. The abbot had been influenced by the [[hesychastic]] tradition of [[Paisius Velichkovsky]]. Herman undertook various obediences and was well-liked by the brethren, but wanted a more solitary life. He became a hermit with Abbot Nazarius' blessing.<ref>Korsun, 7\u20139.</ref> His hermitage, which later became known as \"Herman\u2019s field\" or Germanovo, was two kilometers from the monastery.<ref name=Kovalskaya>\"German Alyaskinsky.\"</ref> Metropolitan Gabriel of St. Petersburg offered to ordain Herman to the priesthood and twice offered to send him to lead the Russian Orthodox Mission in China, but he refused, preferring the solitary life and remaining a simple monk.<ref name=\"Kovalskaya\" /><ref>Korsun, pp. 9\u201310.</ref> Years after he left for North America, Herman continued to keep in touch with his spiritual home.<ref>''Little Russian Philokalia,'' p. 22.</ref> In a letter to Abbot Nazarius, he wrote, \"in my mind I imagine my beloved Valaam, and constantly behold it across the great ocean.\"<ref>''Little Russian Philokalia,'' p. 153.</ref>\n\n==Mission in Alaska==\n[[File:Grigory Shelikov.jpg|thumbnail|right|Grigory Shelikhov, the founder of the Kodiak Island settlement, invited the first Russian Orthodox missionaries to the New World.]]\nThe [[Russian colonization of the Americas]] began when [[Vitus Bering]] and [[Aleksei Chirikov]] discovered Alaska in 1741. The expedition harvested 1,500 [[sea otter]] pelts, which Chinese merchants bought for 1,000 [[rubles]] each at their trading post near [[Lake Baikal]]. This spurred a \"fur rush\" from 1741\u20131798 in which frontiersmen known as ''[[promyshlenniki]]'' explored Alaska and the [[Aleutian Islands]] and alternately fought and intermarried with the native peoples.<ref>Oleksa, pp. 81\u201388.</ref> [[Grigory Shelikhov]], a fur-trader, subjugated the native population of [[Kodiak Island]] and with Ivan Golikov founded a fur-trading company which eventually received a monopoly from the Imperial government and became the Russian-American Company.

[[Catherine the Great]] decided instead to send an entire mission to America. She entrusted the task of recruiting missionaries to Metropolitan Gabriel of St. Petersburg, who sent ten monks from Valaam, including Herman.<ref>Korsun, pp. 13\u201314.</ref> The missionaries arrived on Kodiak on September 24, 1794.<ref name=\"Oleksa, p. 109\">Oleksa, p. 109.</ref>\n\nHerman and the other missionaries encountered a harsh reality at Kodiak that did not correspond to Shelikhov\u2019s rosy descriptions. The native Kodiak population, called \"Americans\" by the Russian settlers, were subject to harsh treatment by the Russian-American Company, which was being overseen by Shelikhov\u2019s manager [[Alexander Andreyevich Baranov|Alexander Baranov]] who later became the first governor of the colony. The men were forced to hunt for sea otter even during harsh weather, and women and children were abused.<ref name=\"Oleksa, p. 109\"/> The monks were also shocked at the widespread alcoholism in the Russian population, and the fact that most of the settlers had taken native mistresses.<ref>Korsun, pp. 29.</ref> The monks themselves were not given the supplies that Shelikhov promised them,<ref>Oleksa, p. 108.</ref> and had to till the ground with wooden implements.<ref>Korsun, p. 24.</ref> Despite these difficulties, the monks managed to baptize over 7,000 natives in the Kodiak region, and set about building a church and monastery.

At the [[all-night vigil]], the [[canon (hymnography)|canon]] to St. Herman was read for the first time by Brother Gleb Podmoshensky (later Fr. Herman), one of the founding brothers of the St. Herman of Alaska Serbian Orthodox Brotherhood in 1963. He, [[Seraphim Rose|Eugene (Seraphim) Rose]], and Lawrence Campbell (now Monk John of [[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville)]]) gathered material for the Synod of Bishops in order to support the glorification of St. Herman, and also helped compose the liturgical service in his honor.<ref>Korsun, pp. 179\u2013184.</ref>\n\nThere are several feast days throughout the year on which Saint Herman of Alaska is commemorated. Since there are two different calendars currently in use among various Orthodox churches, two dates are listed: the first date is the date on the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], the second date, after the slash, is the same day on the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]:\n\n*'''July 27/August 9\u2014Glorification:''' This is the anniversary of the joint-glorification ([[canonization]]) of Herman of Alaska as a saint in 1970.\n*'''November 15/28\u2014Repose:''' This is the anniversary of the actual death of Saint Herman.\n*'''December 13/26\u2014Repose:''' Due to an error in record keeping, this was originally thought to be the day of Saint Herman's death, and because of the long-established tradition of celebrating his memory on this day, it has remained a feast day. It is more likely that this is the day he was buried. For those Orthodox Christians who follow the Julian Calendar, this day falls on December 26 of the Gregorian Calendar.\n*'''Second Sunday after Pentecost:''', as one of the saints commemorated on the Synaxis of the Saints of North America\u2014this is a [[moveable feast]] of the [[ecclesiastical year]], and the date of its observance will change from year to year.<ref>\"Second Sunday after Pentecost\"</ref>\n\nThe major portion of his relics are preserved at Holy Resurrection Cathedral in [[Kodiak, Alaska]], while his burial site at the Sts. [[Sergius of Valaam|Sergius]] and [[Herman of Valaam|Herman]] Chapel, Spruce Island, Alaska is an important [[pilgrim]]age site, where the devout will often take soil from his grave and water from the [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] named in his honour.  A portion of his relics are enshrined at the [[Ignatius of Antioch|St. Ignatius]] Chapel at the [[Antiochan Village]] in [[Pennsylvania]],<ref>\"Antiochian Village\"</ref> a conference and retreat center of the [[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America]], where he is regarded as one of their patron saints.\n\nIn 1963, with the blessing of [[John of Shanghai and San Francisco|St. John Maximovitch]], Archbishop of Shanghai and San Francisco, a community of Orthodox booksellers and publishers called the St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood was formed to publish Orthodox missionary information in English. One of the founders was Father [[Seraphim Rose]]. The Brotherhood did much to advance the cause of St. Herman's glorification as a saint. [[Saint Herman's Orthodox Theological Seminary]] in Kodiak, Alaska is named in his honor, as are numerous [[parish church]]es throughout the world.\n\nOn Tuesday, August 4, 1970, the [[91st United States Congress|91st]] [[Congress of the United States]] acknowledged the Glorification of St Herman of Alaska with a speech in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], and his biography was formally entered into the [[Congressional Record]].<ref>Congressional Record</ref>\n\nIn 1993, [[Patriarch of Moscow|Patriarch]] [[Alexis II of Moscow|Alexis II]] visited Kodiak to venerate the relics of Saint Herman. He left as a gift an ornate ''[[lampada]]'' (oil lamp) which burns constantly over the [[reliquary]].

That is, for sets of points that define a smooth shape or a shape that has a small number of corners\u2014the shapes of traditional geometry and science\u2014the Hausdorff dimension is an [[integer]] agreeing with [[Inductive dimension|a dimension corresponding to its topology]]. However, formalisms have also been developed that allow calculation of the dimension of other less simple objects, where, based solely on its properties of [[scaling (geometry)|scaling]] and [[self-similarity]], one is led to the conclusion that particular objects\u2014including [[fractal]]s\u2014have non-integer Hausdorff dimensions. Because of the significant technical advances made by [[Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch]] allowing computation of dimensions for highly irregular sets, this dimension is also commonly referred to as the ''Hausdorff\u2013Besicovitch dimension.''\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension, more specifically, is a further dimensional number associated with a given set, where the distances between all members of that set are defined. Such a set is termed a [[metric space]]. The dimension is drawn from the [[Extended real number line|extended real numbers]], {{Overline|R}}, as opposed to the more intuitive notion of dimension, which is not associated to general metric spaces, and only takes values in the non-negative integers.\n\nIn mathematical terms, the Hausdorff dimension generalizes the notion of the dimension of a real [[vector space]]. That is, the Hausdorff dimension of an ''n''-dimensional [[inner product space]] equals ''n''. This underlies the earlier statement that the Hausdorff dimension of a point is zero, of a line is one, etc., and that [[fractal|irregular sets]] can have noninteger Hausdorff dimensions. For instance, the [[Koch snowflake|Koch curve]] summarized earlier is constructed from an equilateral triangle; in each iteration, its component line segments are divided into 3 segments of unit length, the newly created middle segment is used as the base of a new [[equilateral]] triangle that points outward, and this base segment is then deleted to leave a final object from the iteration of unit length of 4.<ref>Larry Riddle, 2014, \"Classic Iterated Function Systems: Koch Snowflake\", Agnes Scott College e-Academy (online), see [http://ecademy.agnesscott.edu/~lriddle/ifs/ksnow/ksnow.htm], accessed 5 March 2015.</ref> That is, after the first iteration, each original line segment has been replaced with N=4, where each self-similar copy is 1/S = 1/3 as long as the original.<ref name=CampbellAnnenberg15/> Stated another way, we have taken an object with Euclidean dimension, D, and reduced its linear scale by 1/3 in each direction, so that its length increases to N=S<sup>D</sup>.<ref name=ClaytonSCTPLS96>Keith Clayton, 1996, \"Fractals and the Fractal Dimension,\" ''Basic Concepts in Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos'' (workshop), Society for Chaos Theory in Psychology and the Life Sciences annual meeting, June 28, 1996, Berkeley, California, see [http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/psychology/cogsci/chaos/workshop/Workshop.html], accessed 5 March 2015.</ref> This equation is easily solved for D, yielding the ratio of logarithms (or natural logarithms) appearing in the figures, and giving\u2014in the Koch and other fractal cases\u2014non-integer dimensions for these objects.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension is a successor to the simpler, but usually equivalent, box-counting or [[Minkowski\u2013Bouligand dimension]].\n\n==Intuition==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}\nThe intuitive concept of dimension of a geometric object ''X'' is the number of independent parameters one needs to pick out a unique point inside. However, any point specified by two parameters can be instead specified by one, because the [[cardinality]] of the real plane is equal to the cardinality of the [[real line]] (this can be seen by an [[Cantor's diagonal argument|argument]] involving interweaving the digits of two numbers to yield a single number encoding the same information). The example of a [[space-filling curve]] shows that one can even take one real number into two both surjectively (so all pairs of numbers are covered) and ''continuously'', so that a one-dimensional object completely fills up a higher-dimensional object.\n\nEvery space filling curve hits some points multiple times, and does not have a continuous inverse. It is impossible to map two dimensions onto one in a way that is continuous and continuously invertible. The topological dimension, also called [[Lebesgue covering dimension]], explains why. This dimension is ''n'' if, in every covering of ''X'' by small open balls, there is at least one point where ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 balls overlap. For example, when one covers a line with short open intervals, some points must be covered twice, giving dimension&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\nBut topological dimension is a very crude measure of the local size of a space (size near a point). A curve that is almost space-filling can still have topological dimension one, even if it fills up most of the area of a region. A [[fractal]] has an integer topological dimension, but in terms of the amount of space it takes up, it behaves like a higher-dimensional space.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension measures the local size of a space taking into account the distance between points, the [[metric space|metric]]. Consider the number ''N''(''r'') of [[ball (mathematics)|balls]] of radius at most ''r'' required to cover ''X'' completely. When ''r'' is very small, ''N''(''r'') grows polynomially with 1/''r''. For a sufficiently well-behaved  ''X'', the Hausdorff dimension is the unique number ''d'' such that N(''r'') grows as 1/''r<sup>d</sup>'' as ''r'' approaches zero. More precisely, this defines the [[Minkowski\u2013Bouligand dimension|box-counting dimension]], which equals the Hausdorff dimension when the value ''d'' is a critical boundary between growth rates that are insufficient to cover the space, and growth rates that are overabundant.\n\nFor shapes that are smooth, or shapes with a small number of corners, the shapes of traditional geometry and science, the Hausdorff dimension is an integer agreeing with the topological dimension. But [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] observed that [[fractal]]s, sets with noninteger Hausdorff dimensions, are found everywhere in nature. He observed that the proper idealization of most rough shapes you see around you is not in terms of smooth idealized shapes, but in terms of fractal idealized shapes:\n\n<blockquote>Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.<ref name=\"mandelbrot\">{{cite book   | last = Mandelbrot   | first = Beno\u00eet   | authorlink = Benoit Mandelbrot   | title = The Fractal Geometry of Nature   | publisher = W. H. Freeman   | series = Lecture notes in mathematics 1358   | year = 1982   | doi =   | isbn = 0-7167-1186-9}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nFor fractals that occur in nature, the Hausdorff and [[Minkowski\u2013Bouligand dimension|box-counting dimension]] coincide. The [[packing dimension]] is yet another similar notion which gives the same value for many shapes, but there are well documented exceptions where all these dimensions differ.\n\n==Formal definitions==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Hausdorff content===\nLet ''X'' be a [[metric space]].

It fires from a [[closed bolt]] (bolt forward) position.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=12}}\n\nThe fixed, [[Free-floating barrel|free floating]], cold hammer-forged barrel has 6 right-hand grooves with a 1 in 250&nbsp;mm (1:10 in) [[rifling]] twist rate and is pressed and pinned into the receiver.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}\n\n=== Features ===\n[[File:Visierlinie.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A view through the weapon's aperture sight]]\nThe first MP5 models used a double-column straight [[box magazine]], but since 1977, slightly curved, [[steel]] magazines are used with a 15-round capacity (weighing 0.12&nbsp;kg) or a 30-round capacity (0.17&nbsp;kg empty).{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}\n\nThe adjustable [[iron sight]]s (closed type) consist of a rotating rear diopter drum and a front post installed in a hooded ring. The rear sight is mechanically adjustable for both windage and elevation with the use of a special tool, being adjusted at the factory for firing at {{convert|25|m|yd|0}} with standard {{convert|8|g|gr|0}} FMJ 9\u00d719mm NATO ammunition. The rear sight drum provides four apertures of varying diameters used to adjust the diopter system, according to the user's preference and tactical situation.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=19}} Changing between apertures does not change the point of impact down range. For accurate shooting the user should select the smallest aperture that still allows an equal circle of light between the rear sight aperture and the outside of the front sight hood ring.\n\nThe MP5 has a hammer firing mechanism. The trigger group is housed inside an interchangeable [[polymer]] trigger module (with an integrated pistol grip) and equipped with a three-position fire mode selector that serves as the manual safety toggle. The \"S\" or ''Sicher'' position in white denotes weapon safe, \"E\" or ''Einzelfeuer'' in red represents single fire, and \"F\" or ''Feuersto\u00df'' (also marked in red) designates continuous fire. The SEF symbols appear on both sides of the plastic trigger group. The selector lever is actuated with the thumb of the shooting hand and is located only on the left side of the original SEF trigger group or on both sides of the ambidextrous trigger groups. The safety/selector is rotated into the various firing settings or safety position by depressing the tail end of the lever. Tactile clicks (stops) are present at each position to provide a positive stop and prevent inadvertent rotation. The \"safe\" setting disables the trigger by blocking the hammer release with a solid section of the safety axle located inside the trigger housing.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}\n\nThe non-reciprocating [[cocking handle]] is located above the handguard and protrudes from the cocking handle tube at approximately a 45\u00b0 angle. This rigid control is attached to a tubular piece within the cocking lever housing called the cocking lever support, which in turn makes contact with the forward extension of the bolt group. It is not however connected to the bolt carrier and therefore cannot be used as a [[forward assist]] to fully seat the bolt group. The cocking handle is held in a forward position by a spring detent located in the front end of the cocking lever support which engages in the cocking lever housing. The lever is locked back by pulling it fully to the rear and rotating it slightly clockwise where it can be hooked into an indent in the cocking lever tube.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}\n\n=== Operating mechanism ===\n[[File:US Patent 3283435 8-Nov-1966 BREECH CLOSURE Theodor Koch.png|thumb|left|The roller-delayed blowback mechanism originated from the aborted [[StG 45(M)]] [[assault rifle]] prototypes developed in [[Nazi Germany]] at the end of [[World War II]].]]\nThe bolt rigidly engages the barrel extension\u2014a cylindrical component welded to the [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]] into which the barrel is pinned. The delay mechanism is of the same design as that used in the [[G3 rifle]]. The two-part bolt consists of a bolt head with rollers and a bolt carrier. The heavier bolt carrier lies up against the bolt head when the weapon is ready to fire and inclined planes on the front locking piece lie between the rollers and force them out into recesses in the barrel extension.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=68}}\n\nWhen fired, expanding propellant gases produced from the burning powder in the [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] exert rearward pressure on the bolt head transferred through the base of the cartridge case as it is propelled out of the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]]. A portion of this force is transmitted through the rollers projecting from the bolt head, which are cammed inward against the inclined flanks of the locking recesses in the barrel extension and to the angled shoulders of the locking piece. The selected angles of the recesses and the incline on the locking piece produce a velocity ratio of about 4:1 between the bolt carrier and the bolt head. This results in a calculated delay, allowing the projectile to exit the barrel and gas pressure to drop to a safe level before the case is extracted from the chamber.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=68}}\n\nThe delay results from the amount of time it takes for enough recoil energy to be transferred through to the bolt carrier in a sufficient quantity for it to be driven to the rear against the force of inertia of the bolt carrier and the forward pressure exerted against the bolt by the recoil spring. As the rollers are forced inward they displace the locking piece and propel the bolt carrier to the rear. The bolt carrier's rearward velocity is four times that of the bolt head since the cartridge remains in the chamber for a short period of time during the initial recoil impulse. After the bolt carrier has traveled rearward 4&nbsp;mm, the locking piece is withdrawn fully from the bolt head and the rollers are compressed into the bolt head. Only once the locking rollers are fully cammed into the bolt head can the entire bolt group continue its rearward movement in the receiver, breaking the seal in the chamber and continuing the feeding cycle.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=68}}\n\nSince the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] cartridge is relatively low powered, the bolt does not have an anti-bounce device like the G3, but instead the bolt carrier contains [[tungsten]] granules that prevent the bolt group from bouncing back after impacting the barrel extension. The weapon has a fluted chamber that enhances extraction reliability by bleeding gases backwards into the shallow flutes running along the length of the chamber to prevent the cartridge case from expanding and sticking to the chamber walls (since the bolt is opened under relatively high barrel pressure). A spring extractor is installed inside the bolt head and holds the case securely until it strikes the ejector arm and is thrown out of the ejection port to the right of the receiver. The lever-type ejector is located inside the trigger housing (activated by the movement of the recoiling bolt).{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=68}}\n\n=== Accessories ===\nIn the early 1970s, [[Heckler & Koch|HK]] introduced a conversion kit for the MP5 that enables it to use rimfire ammunition ([[.22 LR]]). This unit consists of a barrel insert, a bolt group and two 20-round magazines. This modification reduces the cyclic rate to 650 rounds/min. It was sold mostly to law enforcement agencies as a way to train recruits on handling the MP5. It used ammunition that was cheaper and had a lower recoil than 9\u00d719mm Parabellum. This reduced training costs and built up skill and confidence in the operators before transitioning them to the full-bore model.\n\n====Barrel accessories====\n[[File:Patent DE1553874 07-Oct-1971 Handfeuerwaffe mit Schalldaempfer Heckler und Koch.png|thumb|left|Cross section diagram of an MP5SD early model suppressor, from 1971 patent. Vented barrel surrounded by metal mesh packing in the expansion chambers, followed by conical baffles in the forward chambers.]]\nThreading is provided at the muzzle to work with certain muzzle devices made by Heckler & Koch, including: a slotted [[flash suppressor]], [[blank-firing adaptor|blank firing attachment]] (marked with a red-painted band denoting use with blank ammunition only), an adapter for launching [[rifle grenade]]s (for use with rifle-style grenades with an inside diameter of 22&nbsp;mm using a special grenade launching cartridge) and a cup-type attachment used to launch [[tear gas]] grenades. An optional three-lugged barrel is also available for mounting a quick-detachable [[suppressor]].\n\n====Receiver====\nThe receiver housing has a proprietary claw-rail mounting system that permits the attachment of a standard Heckler & Koch quick-detachable scope mount (also used with the [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]], [[Heckler & Koch HK33|HK33]] and [[G3SG/1]]). It can be used to mount daytime optical sights (telescopic 4\u00d724), night sights, reflex sights and [[laser]] pointers. The mount features two spring-actuated bolts, positioned along the base of the mount, which exert pressure on the receiver to hold the mount in the same position at all times assuring zero retention. All versions of the quick-detachable scope mount provide a sighting tunnel through the mount so that the shooter can continue to use the fixed iron sights with the scope mount attached to the top of the receiver.\n\nA [[Picatinny rail]] adapter can be placed on top that locks into the claw rails. This allows the mounting of [[Standardization Agreement|STANAG]] scopes and has a lower profile than the claw-rail system.\n\n====Handguard====\nAftermarket replacement handguards with [[Picatinny rail]]s are available. Single-rail models have a Picatinny rail along the bottom and triple-rail models have rails along the bottom and sides. They allow the mounting of accessories like flashlights, laser pointers, target designators, vertical foregrips, and bipods.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=24}}\n\n== Variants ==\nThe MP5A2 has a fixed buttstock (made of a synthetic polymer), whereas the compact ''MP5A3'' has a retractable metal stock. The stockless ''MP5A1'' has a buttcap with a sling mount for concealed carry; the MP5K series was a further development of this idea.{{sfn|Cutshaw|2011|p=154}}\n\nThe ''MP5A4'' (fixed stock) and ''MP5A5'' (sliding stock) models, which were introduced in 1974, are available with four-position trigger groups. The pistol grips are straight, lacking the contoured grip and thumb groove of the ''MP5A1'', ''MP5A2'', and ''MP5A3''. The selector lever stops are marked with bullet pictograms rather than letters or numbers (each symbol represents the number of bullets that will be fired when the trigger is pulled and held rearward with a full magazine inserted in the weapon) and are fully ambidextrous (the selector lever is present on each side of the trigger housing). The additional setting of the fire selector, one place before the fully automatic setting, enables a two or three-shot burst firing mode.\n\nA variant with the last trigger group designated the '''MP5-N''' (N\u2014Navy) was developed in 1986 for the [[United States Navy]]. This model has a collapsible stock, a [[tritium]]-illuminated front sight post and a {{convert|225|mm|abbr=on|1}} threaded barrel for use with a [[stainless steel]] [[suppressor|sound suppressor]] made by [[Knight's Armament Company]] together with quieter subsonic ammunition. It had ambidextrous controls, a straight pistol grip, pictogram markings, and originally had a four-position selector (Safe, Semi-Auto, 3-Round Burst, Full Auto). This was replaced with a similar three-position ambidextrous selector after an improperly-reassembled trigger group spontaneously fired during an exercise. The \"Navy\"-style ambidextrous trigger group later became standard, replacing the classic \"SEF\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Trigger group\n|-\n! Type !! Positions !! Settings !!

These weapons operate like the standard MP5 but have a floating chamber and both rollers have been omitted from the bolt to function properly when firing the lighter plastic projectiles. To help identify these weapons blue dots were painted on their cocking handles and additional lettering provided. The PT variant can be configured with various buttstocks and trigger groups and was developed for the West German Police and Border Guard.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=29}}\n\n=== Semi-auto only variants ===\n[[File:Police.gun.1.london.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Authorised Firearms Officers standing guard at the entrance to Downing Street, London, home of the UK Prime Minister. This officer is attached to the [[Diplomatic Protection Group]] and is carrying a semi-auto MP5SFA3.]]\nThe ''MP5SFA2'' (SF \u2013 single-fire) was developed in 1986 in response to the American [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] solicitation for a \"9&nbsp;mm Single-fire Carbine\". It is the same as the MP5A2 but is fitted with an ambidextrous semi-automatic only trigger group. The ''MP5SFA3'' is similar except it has a retractable metal stock like the MP5A3. Versions delivered after December 1991 are assembled with select-fire bolt carriers allowing fully automatic operation when used with the appropriate trigger module.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=47}}\n\nThe semi-automatic \"MP5SF\" models are widely use by British police forces including London's  [[Metropolitan Police Service]] [[Specialist Firearms Command]], [[Diplomatic Protection Group]], [[Authorised firearms officer]]s, and the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] to name a few.\n\nThe two-position trigger unit was used in the single-fire ''HK94'' [[carbine]] that was produced specifically for the civilian market with a {{convert|420|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=29}}\n\n=== Suppressed variants ===\nIn 1974, H&K initiated design work on a sound-suppressed variant of the MP5, designated the '''MP5SD''' (SD\u2014''Schalld\u00e4mpfer'', German for \"sound suppressor\"), which features an integral but detachable [[aluminium]] sound suppressor and a lightweight bolt. The weapon's {{convert|146|mm|abbr=on|1}} barrel has 30 {{convert|2.5|mm|abbr=on|1}} ports drilled forward of the chamber through which escaping gases are diverted to the surrounding sealed tubular casing that is screwed onto threading on the barrel\u2019s external surface just prior to the ported segment. The suppressor itself is divided into two stages; the initial segment surrounding the ported barrel serves as an expansion chamber for the propellant gases, reducing gas pressure to slow down the acceleration of the projectile. The second, decompression stage occupies the remaining length of the suppressor tube and contains a stamped metal [[helix]] separator with several compartments which increase the gas volume and decrease its temperature, deflecting the gases as they exit the muzzle, so muffling the exit report. The bullet leaves the muzzle at subsonic velocity, so it does not generate a sonic [[shock wave]] in flight. As a result of reducing the barrel's length and venting propellant gases into the suppressor, the bullet's muzzle velocity was lowered anywhere from 16% to 26% (depending on the ammunition used) while maintaining the weapon\u2019s automation and reliability. The weapon was designed to be used with standard supersonic ammunition with the suppressor on at all times.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=18}}\n\nThe MP5SD is produced exclusively by H&K in several versions: the MP5SD1 and MP5SD4 (both have a receiver end cap instead of a buttstock), MP5SD2 and MP5SD5 (equipped with a fixed synthetic buttstock) and the MP5SD3 and MP5SD6 (fitted with a collapsible metal stock). The MP5SD1, MP5SD2 and MP5SD3 use a standard 'SEF' trigger group (from the MP5A2 and MP5A3), while the MP5SD4, MP5SD5, and MP5SD6 use the 'Navy' trigger group\u2014a trigger module with a mechanically limited 3-round burst mode and ambidextrous selector controls (from the MP5A4 and MP5A5). A suppressed version was produced for the U.S. Navy\u2014designated the MP5SD-N, which is a version of the MP5SD3 with a retractable metal stock, front sight post with tritium-illuminated dot and a stainless steel suppressor. This model has a modified cocking handle support to account for the slightly larger outside diameter of the suppressor. The design of the suppressor allows the weapon to be fired with water inside, should water enter the device during operation in or near water.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=5}}\n\n=== MP5K ===\nIn 1976, a shortened [[machine pistol]] version of the MP5A2 was introduced; the ''MP5K'' (K from the German word ''Kurz'' = \"short\") was designed for close quarters battle use by clandestine operations and special services. The MP5K does not have a shoulder stock (the receiver end was covered with a flat end cap, featuring a buffer on the inside and a sling loop on the outside), and the bolt and receiver were shortened at the rear. The resultant lighter bolt led to a higher rate of fire than the standard MP5. The barrel, cocking handle and its cover were shortened and a vertical foregrip was used to replace the standard handguard. The barrel ends at the base of the front sight, which prevents the use of any sort of muzzle device.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=19}}\n\nThe MP5K is produced (by Heckler & Koch and under license in [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]) in four different versions: the MP5K, ''MP5KA4'', ''MP5KA1'', ''MP5KA5'', where the first two variants have adjustable, open-type iron sights (with a notched rotary drum), and the two remaining variants \u2013 fixed open sights; however, the front sight post was changed and a notch was cut into the receiver top cover. The MP5K retained the capability to use optical sights through the use of an adapter.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=19}}\n\nA civilian semiautomatic derivative of the MP5K known as the '''SP89''' was produced that had a foregrip with a muzzle guard in place of the vertical grip.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=30}}\n\nIn 1991, a further variant of the MP5K was developed, designated the ''MP5K-PDW'' (PDW\u2014Personal Defense Weapon) that retained the compact dimensions of the MP5K but restored the fire handling characteristics of the full-size MP5A2. The MP5K-PDW uses a side-folding synthetic shoulder stock (made by the U.S. company Choate Machine and Tool), a \"Navy\" trigger group, a front sight post with a built-in tritium insert and a slightly lengthened threaded, three-lug barrel (analogous to the MP5-N). The stock can be removed and replaced with a receiver endplate; a rotary drum with apertures from the MP5A2 can also be used.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=20}}\n\n=== Larger caliber versions ===\nIn 1991, Heckler & Koch introduced the ''MP5/10'' (chambered in [[10mm Auto]]) and ''MP5/40'' (chambered for the [[.40 S&W]] cartridge), which are based on the MP5A4 and MP5A5. These weapons were assembled in fixed and retractable stock configurations (without a separate designation) and are fed from translucent 30-round polymer box magazines. These weapons include a bolt hold-open device, which captures the bolt group in its rear position after expending the last cartridge from the magazine. The bolt is then released by pressing a lever positioned on the left side of the receiver. Both weapons use a barrel with 6 right-hand grooves and a 380&nbsp;mm (1:15 in) twist rate, and like the MP5-N, both have a 3-lugged muzzle device and a tritium-illuminated front sight aiming dot.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=23}}\n\nProblems with the MP5/10 and MP5/40 led to their discontinuation, although Heckler & Koch continues to provide support and spare parts.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=23}}\n\n=== Variants list ===\n[[File:Hkmp5k.jpg|thumb|right|A MP5K]]\n[[File:MP5K Submachine Gun (7414624602).jpg|thumb|MP5K-PDW (early prototype, lacking 'Navy' trigger group and lugged barrel).]]\n[[File:Heckler Koch MP5.jpg|thumb|The MP5SD3.]]\n\n* '''HK54''': The original model that was produced in 1964. The ''54'' designation is from the Hecker & Koch company's old system that indicates that it is a submachine gun/assault carbine (5-) chambered for the 9\u00d719mm cartridge (-4). It had a charcoal-gray phosphated finish rather than the matte-black finish used on later models and had narrow slotted metal handguards. Its major differences were that it had a longer and heavier bolt carrier than the MP5 and a flip up \"ladder\"-style rear sight (like the early G3 rifle) rather than the MP5's aperture sight. Its original 15- or 30-round steel magazines were straight rather than curved, had a plastic follower, and were reinforced with ribs (thus their nickname of \"waffle\"-type magazines).{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n* '''MP5''': A slightly modified version of the HK54 first created in 1966. It has a matte-black phosphated finish instead of the grayish finish. It originally had the narrow checkered metal \"Slimline\" handguards in the place of the HK54's narrow slotted metal ones. These were later replaced by the thicker \"Tropical\" handguards. The proprietary Heckler & Koch \"claw mount\" rails for mounting optical and electronic scopes were added around 1973. The improved 15- and 30-round magazines were adopted in 1977; they were curved, had unribbed sides, and had chromed-steel followers.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n** '''MP5A1''': No buttstock (endplate/receiver cap in place of buttstock), \"SEF\" trigger group.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n** '''MP5A2''': Fixed buttstock, \"SEF\" trigger group.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n** '''MP5SFA2''': Fixed buttstock, single-fire (SE) trigger group.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n** '''MP5A3''': Retractable buttstock,\"SEF\" trigger group.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n** '''MP5SFA3''': Semi-automatic carbine version of MP5A3.

The ''94'' factory designation code indicates that it is a semi-auto only Sporting Rifle (9-) chambered for the 9x19mm Parabellum cartridge (-4). <br>A barrel-mounted vertical foregrip and a ventilated barrel shroud were available for the stock HK94. The HK94 was imported from 1983 to 1989, in three different configurations:\n**The '''HK94A2''' had a fixed stock, an overall length of 34.59 inches [829&nbsp;mm], and weighed 6.43&nbsp;lbs. [2.92&nbsp;kg.]. In 1991, the state of [[California]] imported 420 HK-94A2s, mostly for their state [[California Department of Corrections|Department of Corrections]]; it was the last batch of HK-94s imported into the United States.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=30}}\n**The '''HK94A3''' had a retractable stock, an overall length of 27.58 inches [700&nbsp;mm] collapsed and 34.05 inches [865&nbsp;mm] extended and weighed 7.18&nbsp;lbs. [3.26&nbsp;kg].{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=30}}\n**The '''HK94/SG-1''' (''Scharfsch\u00fctzengewehr'', \"sharp-shooting rifle\") was designed for short-range sniping in built-up areas like cities or prisons. It proved to be unsuitable for its designed purpose, due to its poor penetration and stopping power,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} and most went to target shooters and collectors. It had a fixed match stock with a rubber buttpad and an adjustable cheekpiece, folding bipod, flash hider, and a 6 \u00d7 42mm Leupold VIII Adjustable Objective scope. It had an overall length of 40.39 inches [1026mm] and a weight of 9.25&nbsp;lbs. [4.2&nbsp;kg]. Its mean standard retail price (MSRP) in 1986 was US$1,525; this was more than twice what a stock HK94A2 (US$650) or HK94A3 (US$720) cost. Only 50 were imported into the United States; authentic models have serial numbers running in the 43XX range.<br>As an aftermarket modification, a PSG-1 trigger pack with target pistol grip and match trigger could be added by a gunsmith by changing the ejector and hammer spring. The 6\u00d7 Leupold scope was calibrated for .223 Remington rounds, so other scopes were often substituted.\n* '''SP89''': ''Sportpistole M1989''. Semi-automatic only version of the MP5K designed for civilian use. It lacked a vertical foregrip to make it compliant with the [[National Firearms Act]]. It was made from 1989 to 1994.{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=13}}\n* '''SP5K''':  First introduced in 2016, the SP5K is an updated version of the SP89. It features a Picatinny rail mounted on the top of the receiver for mounting accessories. As with the SP89, it is semi-automatic only and the forward handguard does not have a vertical foregrip.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heckler-koch.com/en/products/sport/full-size-compact/sp5k/sp5k/product-overview.html|title=Heckler & Koch :: Product Overview - SP5K|website=www.heckler-koch.com}}</ref>\n\n====Foreign variant copies====\n* '''T-94 ZSG (''Ziviles Sportgewehr'', \"Civilian Sport Rifle\")''': Turkish MP5 semi-automatic-only clone manufactured by MKE for the civilian European sport shooting market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mkek.gov.tr/en/Products.aspx|title=MKEK - Mechanical and Chemical Industry Company|author=|date=|work=mkek.gov.tr|accessdate=22 August 2016}}</ref> The models available are the '''T-94P''' (HK94A2), '''T-94A''' (MP5A2), '''T-94K''' (MP5K), and '''T-94SD''' (MP5SD2).

A member of the colonial legislature, during the [[American Revolution]] he attended the [[Continental Congress]] and served as that body's [[President of the Continental Congress|presiding officer]] for a few days in 1774. He left Congress before it [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared independence]]. Back in South Carolina, he served as president of the provincial congress and senator in the newly created state government. After his capture by the British in 1780, he accepted defeat and returned to the status of a British subject until the end of the war.\n\n==Early life and family==\nHenry Middleton was born in 1717 near [[Charles Town, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Province of South Carolina]], to [[Arthur Middleton (1681\u20131737)|Arthur Middleton]] (1681\u20131737) and Susan Amory (1690-1722), on the family plantation, \"The Oaks\".<ref name=\"DAB\">John G. Van Deusen, \"Middleton, Henry\", ''[[Dictionary of American Biography]]'' (revised edition, New York: Scribner's, 1961), 6:600.</ref> Henry's father Arthur Middleton was a wealthy planter who had served as an acting governor of South Carolina. Henry was educated in England before returning to South Carolina to inherit his father's plantation. He became one of the largest landowners in the colony, owning {{convert|50000|acre|km2}} and about 800 slaves.<ref name=\"DAB\" />\n\nMiddleton married Mary Williams in 1741, with whom he would have five sons and seven daughters.<ref name=\"DAB\" /> After Mary\u2019s death in 1761, Middleton would go on to marry twice more, second to Maria Henrietta Bull (in 1762) and third to Lady Mary McKenzie (in 1776).<ref name=\"DAB\" />\n\n==Public offices==\nMiddleton served in a variety of public offices in South Carolina. He was a [[justice of the peace]] and a  member of the [[Commons House of Assembly]], where he was elected speaker in 1747, 1754, and 1755.<ref name=\"DAB\" /> He was a member of provincial council, but resigned in 1770 in opposition to British policy.<ref name=\"DAB\" />\n\nIn 1774, at the outset of the [[American Revolution]], Middleton was selected as a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]]. He served as that body's [[President of the Continental Congress|president]] during the last few days of the [[First Continental Congress]], following the departure of [[Peyton Randolph]].<ref>Calvin C. Jillson and Rick K. Wilson, ''Congressional Dynamics: Structure, Coordination, and Choice in the First American Congress, 1774\u20131789'' (Stanford University Press, 1994), 51.</ref> Middleton opposed declaring independence from Great Britain, and resigned from the [[Second Continental Congress]] in February 1776 when more radical delegates began pushing for independence.<ref name=\"DAB\" /> He was succeeded in Congress by his son, [[Arthur Middleton]] (1742\u20131787), who was more radical than his father and became a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].<ref name=\"DAB\" />\n\nAfter Middleton's return to South Carolina, he was elected president of the [[provincial congress]] and, beginning on November 16, 1775, served on the [[council of safety]].<ref name=\"DAB\" /> In 1776, he and his son Arthur helped frame a temporary state constitution.<ref name=\"DAB\" /> In 1779, he became a state senator in the new government.<ref name=\"DAB\" />\n\nWhen Charleston was [[Siege of Charleston|captured by the British]] in 1780, Middleton accepted defeat and status as a British subject. This reversal apparently did not damage his reputation in the long run, due to his previous support of the Revolution, and he did not suffer the fate of having his estates confiscated, as many [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] did after the war.<ref name=\"DAB\" />\n\n==Death and legacy==\nMiddleton died on June 13, 1784 in Charleston.\n\nHis grandson, also named [[Henry Middleton (governor)|Henry]] (1770\u20131846), had a long career in politics. He was [[List of Governors of South Carolina|Governor of South Carolina]] (1810\u20131812), [[U.S. Representative]] (1815\u20131819), and the minister to Russia (1820\u20131830). Some of Middleton's children married into prominent families. Daughter Henrietta married Governor [[Edward Rutledge]], Sarah was the first wife of [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]], and his daughter Susannah married [[John Parker (Continental Congress)|John Parker]].<ref name=\"DAB\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=M000698 Biographic sketch at U.S. Congress website]\n*[http://www.middletonplace.org/ Middleton Place]\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Peyton Randolph]]}} \n{{s-ttl|title=[[President of the Continental Congress|President of the First Continental Congress]]|years=October 22, 1774 \u2013 October 26, 1774}} \n{{s-aft|after=[[Peyton Randolph]]<br>''(as President of the Second Continental Congress)''}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{Presidents of the Continental Congress}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Middleton, Henry}}\n[[Category:1717 births]]\n[[Category:1784 deaths]]\n[[Category:American people of English descent]]\n[[Category:American slave owners]]\n[[Category:Continental Congressmen from South Carolina]]\n[[Category:18th-century American politicians]]\n[[Category:Middleton family]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Charleston, South Carolina]]\n[[Category:People of South Carolina in the American Revolution]]\n[[Category:South Carolina state senators]]\n[[Category:South Carolina colonial people]]", "sha1": "ig3uqmvnux1n4jm4rjv49obirvto7sq"}}, {"title": "Ham", "ns": "0", "id": "14299", "revision": {"id": "866095030", "parentid": "866094868", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T06:24:04Z", "contributor": {"username": "Oknazevad", "id": "69423"}, "comment": "Undid revision 866094868 by [[Special:Contributions/Geoffreyrabbit|Geoffreyrabbit]] ([[User talk:Geoffreyrabbit|talk]]) Still not appropriate for the sections and purely decorative (not good images, either).

In addition, numerous ham products have specific geographical naming protection, such as [[Prosciutto di Parma]] and Prosciutto Toscano in Europe, and [[Smithfield ham]] in the US.\n\n== History ==\nThe preserving of pork leg as ham has a long history, with [[Cato the Elder]] writing about the \"salting of hams\" in his ''[[De Agri Cultura]]'' tome around 160 BC.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=British Journal of Nutrition|volume=1|issue=2\u20133|date=December 1947|pages=269\u2013274|title=The Action of Salts and other Substances Used in the Curing of Bacon and Ham|last=Callow|first=EH|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=766980|doi=10.1079/bjn19470037|pmid=18907930}}</ref>\n\nThere are claims that the Chinese were the first people to mention the production of cured ham.<ref name=zeuthen>{{cite book|title=Meat Fermentation Worldwide: History and Principles|last=Zeuthen|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ie2IxsLTqfgC&pg=PA3|isbn=978-0-470-37634-8|date=2008-04-15}}</ref> [[Larousse Gastronomique]] claims an origin from [[Gaul]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Larousse Gastronomique|year=2009|publisher=Hamlyn|isbn=978-0-600-62042-6}}</ref> It was certainly well established by the Roman period, as evidenced by an import trade from Gaul mentioned by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in his writings.<ref name=zeuthen />\n\nThe modern word \"ham\" is derived from the [[Old English]] ''ham'' or ''hom'' meaning the hollow or bend of the knee, from a Germanic base where it meant \"crooked\".

Additionally [[smoking (cooking)|smoking]] may be employed. Besides salt, several ingredients may be used to obtain flavoring and preservation, from black pepper (e.g. Prosciutto Toscano) to saffron (e.g. the \"Zafferano di San Gimignano\").\n\n=== Dry-cured ===\n[[File:ProsciuttoSeaSalt.JPG|thumb|right|Sea salt being added to raw pork leg as part of a dry cure process]]\nTraditional dry cure hams may use only salt as the curative agent, such as with San Daniele or Parma hams, although this is comparatively rare.<ref name=meat>{{cite web|url=http://www.meatsandsausages.com/sausage-making/curing/methods|title=Curing Methods|publisher=Meat and Sausages.com}}</ref> This process involves cleaning the raw meat, covering it in salt while it is gradually pressed draining all the blood. Specific herbs and spices may be used to add flavour during this step. The hams are then washed and hung in a dark, temperature-regulated place until dry. It is then hung to air for another period of time.\n\nThe duration of the curing process varies by the type of ham, with, for example, Serrano ham curing in 9\u201312 months, Parma hams taking more than 12 months, and Iberian ham taking up to 2 years to reach the desired flavour characteristics.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=European Food Research and Technology|year=2001|volume=213|issue=2|pages=83\u201387|title=Dipeptidyl peptidase activities along the processing of Serrano dry-cured ham|first1=Miguel Angel|last1=Sentandreu|first2=Fidel|last2=Toldr\u00e1|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002170100355#page-1|doi=10.1007/s002170100355}}</ref> Some dry cured hams, such as the [[Jinhua ham]], take approximately 8 to 10 months to complete.<ref name=Zhou>{{Citation|first=G.H. |last=Zhou |first2=G.M. |last2=Zhao |title=Biochemical changes during processing of traditional Jinhua ham |journal=Meat Science |year=2007 |pages=114\u2013120|volume=77|doi=10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.03.028}}</ref>\n\nMost modern dry cure hams also use [[nitrite]]s (either [[sodium nitrite]] or [[potassium nitrate]]), which are added along with the salt. Nitrates are used because they prevent bacterial growth and, in a reaction with the meat's [[myoglobin]], give the product a desirable dark red color. The amount and mixture of salt and nitrites used have an effect on the shrinkage of the meat.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Food Science|title=Effect of salt, phosphates and other curing ingredients on shrinkage of lean pork meat and quality of smoked processed ham|first1=Eugen|last1=Wierbicki|first2=John J|last2=Howker|year=1976|volume=41|issue=5|pages=1116\u20131121|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1976.tb14399.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.1976.tb14399.x}}</ref> Because of the toxicity of nitrite (the lethal dose of nitrite for humans is about 22&nbsp;mg per kg body weight), some areas specify a maximum allowable content of nitrite in the final product.

Meat is typically kept in the brine for around 3 to 14 days.<ref name=meat /> Wet curing also has the effect of increasing volume and weight of the finished product, by about 4%.\n\nThe wet curing process can also be achieved by pumping the curing solution into the meat. This can be quicker, increase the weight of the finished product by more than immersion, and ensure a more even distribution of salt through the meat. This process is quicker than traditional brining, normally being completed in a few days.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Applied Microbiology|date=September 1958|title=The occurrence and significance of a motile microorganism of the Genus Lactobacillus in ham curing brines|last1=Deibel|first1=RH|last2=Niven|first2=CF|volume=6|issue=5|pages=323\u2013327|pmc=1057423|pmid=13571973}}</ref>\n\n=== Smoking ===\nHam can also be additional preserved through by [[smoking (cooking)|smoking]], in which the meat is placed in a smokehouse (or equivalent) to be cured by the action of smoke.\n\nThe main flavor compounds of smoked ham are [[guaiacol]], and its 4-, 5-, and 6-methyl derivatives as well as 2,6-dimethylphenol. These compounds are produced by combustion of lignin, a major constituent of wood used in the smokehouse.<ref>Wittkowski, Reiner; Ruther, Joachim; Drinda, Heike; Rafiei-Taghanaki, Foroozan \"Formation of smoke flavor compounds by thermal lignin degradation\" ACS Symposium Series (Flavor Precursors), 1992, volume 490, pp 232\u2013243. {{ISBN|9780841222229}}</ref>\n\n=== Labeling ===\nIn many countries the term is now protected by statute, with a specific definition. For instance, in the United States, the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR) says that \"the word 'ham', without any prefix indicating the species of animal from which derived, shall be used in labeling only in connection with the hind legs of swine\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/9/317.8|title=9 CFR 317.8 \u2013 False or misleading labeling or practices generally; specific prohibitions and requirements for labels and containers|publisher=Legal Information Institute}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the main categories, some processing choices can affect legal labeling. For instance, in the United States, a \"smoked\" ham must have been smoked by hanging over burning wood chips in a [[smokehouse]] or an atomized spray of [[liquid smoke]] such that the product appearance is equivalent; a \"[[hickory]]-smoked\" ham must have been smoked using only hickory. However, injecting \"smoke flavor\" is not legal grounds for claiming the ham was \"smoked\"; these are labeled \"smoke flavor added\". Hams can only be labeled \"honey-cured\" if honey was at least 50% of the sweetener used, is at least 3% of the formula, and has a discernible effect on flavor. So-called \"lean\" and \"extra lean\" hams must adhere to maximum levels of fat and [[cholesterol]] per 100&nbsp;grams of product.\n\nWhole fresh pork leg can be labeled as ''fresh ham'' in the United States.\n\n=== Protected designations ===\n[[File:Making Jambon de Bayonne--Step 4.jpg|thumb|Hams aging in an atmospherically controlled storage room in [[Mazerolles, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Mazerolles]], B\u00e9arn, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques]]\nA number of hams worldwide have some level of protection of their unique characteristics, usually relating to their method of preservation or location of production or processing.

Laurens took their three sons to England for their education, encouraging their oldest, [[John Laurens]], to study law. Instead of completing his studies, John Laurens returned to the United States in 1776, to serve in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n==Political career==\n[[File:Henry Laurens engraved portrait 1784 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|1784 engraving of Laurens as President of the Continental Congress]]\nHenry Laurens served in the militia, as did most able-bodied men in his time.  He rose to the rank of Lt. Colonel in the [[Anglo-Cherokee War|campaigns]] against the [[Cherokee]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in 1757\u20131761, during the [[French and Indian War]] (also known as the [[Seven Years' War]]).\n\n1757 also marked the first year he was elected to the colonial assembly. Laurens was elected again every year but one until the Revolution replaced the assembly with a state Convention as an interim government.  The year he missed was 1773, when he visited England to arrange for his sons' educations.  He was named to the colony's Council in 1764 and 1768, but declined both times.  In 1772 he joined the [[American Philosophical Society]] of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], and carried on extensive correspondence with other members.\n\nAs the [[American Revolution]] neared, Laurens was at first inclined to support reconciliation with the [[United Kingdom|British Crown]]. But as conditions deteriorated, he came to fully support the American position.  When Carolina began to create a revolutionary government, Laurens was elected to the Provincial Congress, which first met on January 9, 1775.  He was president of the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]], and presiding officer of that congress from June until March 1776.  When South Carolina installed a fully independent government, he served as the Vice President of South Carolina from March 1776 to June 27, 1777.\n\nHenry Laurens was first named a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] on January 10, 1777.  He served in the Congress from until 1780.  He was the [[President of the Continental Congress]] from November 1, 1777 to December 9, 1778.\n\nIn the fall of 1779, the Congress named Laurens their minister to the [[Netherlands]]. In early 1780 he took up that post and successfully negotiated Dutch support for the war.  But on his return voyage to Amsterdam that fall, the British frigate {{HMS|Vestal|1779|2}} intercepted his ship, the continental [[Packet (sea transport)|packet]] ''Mercury'',<ref>{{cite book | last=Tuchman |first=Barbara |title=First Salute: A View of the American Revolution |publisher=Random House }}</ref> off the banks of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Although his dispatches were tossed in the water, they were retrieved by the British, who discovered the draft of a possible U.S.-Dutch treaty prepared in [[Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1778 by [[William Lee (diplomat)|William Lee]] and the Amsterdam banker [[Jean de Neufville]].<ref name=Founders1789>{{cite web |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-03-02-0031 |website=Founders Online |title=From George Washington to Leonard de Neufville, June 29, 1789 |publisher=National Archives }}</ref>  This prompted Britain to declare war on the [[Dutch Republic]], it becoming known as the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]].\n\nThe British charged Laurens with treason, transported him to England, and imprisoned him in the [[Tower of London]] (he is the only American to have been held prisoner in the Tower).  His imprisonment was protested by the Americans.  In the field, most captives were regarded as prisoners of war, and while conditions were frequently appalling, prisoner exchanges and mail privileges were accepted practice. During his imprisonment, Laurens was assisted by Richard Oswald, his former business partner and the principal owner of [[Bunce Island]].  Oswald argued on Laurens' behalf to the British government. Finally, on December 31, 1781 he was released in exchange for General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] and completed his voyage to Amsterdam. He helped raise funds for the American effort.\n\nLaurens' oldest son, Colonel [[John Laurens]], was killed in 1782 in the [[Battle of the Combahee River]], as one of the last casualties of the Revolutionary War. He had supported enlisting and freeing slaves for the war effort, and suggested to his father that he begin with the 40 he stood to inherit.<ref name=\"Massey\"/>  He had urged his father to free the family's slaves, but although conflicted, Henry Laurens never manumitted his 260 slaves.<ref name=\"Massey\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.earlyamerica.com/review/2003_winter_spring/slavery_liberty.htm |first=Gregory D. |last=Massey |title=Slavery and Liberty in the American Revolution: John Laurens's Black Regiment Proposal |journal=Early America |date=Winter\u2013Spring 2003 |accessdate=2012-05-31 }}</ref><ref name=Finkelman>{{cite journal |url=http://studythepast.com/civilrightsundergraduate/materials/thomas%20jefferson%20and%20antislavery%20_%20the%20myth%20goes%20on%20_%20paul%20finkelman.pdf |first=Paul |last=Finkelman |title=Thomas Jefferson and Antislavery: The Myth Goes On |journal=The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography |volume=102 |issue=2 |date=April 1994 |page=211 |accessdate=2011-03-14 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1783 Laurens was sent to Paris as one of the Peace Commissioners for the negotiations leading to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]].  While he was not a signatory of the primary treaty, he was instrumental in reaching the secondary accords that resolved issues related to the Netherlands and Spain.  [[Richard Oswald (merchant)|Richard Oswald]], a former partner of Laurens in the slave trade, was the principal negotiator for the British during the Paris peace talks.\n\nLaurens generally retired from public life in 1784.  He was sought for a return to the Continental Congress, the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787 and the state assembly, but he declined all of these positions. He did serve in the state convention of 1788, where he voted to ratify the [[United States Constitution]].\n\n[[Image:1784 HenryLaurens byJNorman BostonMagazine Sept.png|thumb|right|Portrait of Laurens, ''[[Boston Magazine (1783-1786)|Boston Magazine]],'' 1784; engraving by [[John Norman (publisher)|John Norman]]]]\n\n==Later events==\nBritish forces, during their occupation of Charleston, had burned the Laurens home at [[Mepkin Abbey|Mepkin]] during the war. When Laurens and his family returned in 1784, they lived in an outbuilding while the [[great house]] was rebuilt. He lived on the estate the rest of his life, working to recover the estimated \u00a340,000 that the revolution had cost him (equivalent to about ${{Format price |{{To USD | {{#expr:{{Inflation|UK-GDP|40000|1784|r=2}}}} |GBR |year={{#expr:{{Inflation/year|UK-GDP}}}}}}}} in {{Inflation/year|UK-GDP}}).{{Inflation/fn|UK-GDP}}\n\n==Death and cremation==\nLaurens died on December 8, 1792, at his estate, Mepkin.

Development was being conducted by a consortium led by [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] and [[British Aerospace]] (BAe).\n\nDesigned as a [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) reusable winged launch vehicle, HOTOL was to be fitted with a unique air-breathing engine, the RB545 or Swallow, that was under development by British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce. The propellant for the engine technically consisted of a combination of liquid [[hydrogen]]/liquid [[oxygen]]; however, it was to employ a new means of dramatically reducing the amount of oxidizer needed to be carried on board by utilising atmospheric oxygen as the spacecraft climbed through the lower atmosphere. Since propellant typically represents the majority of the takeoff weight of a rocket, HOTOL was to be considerably smaller than normal pure-rocket designs, roughly the size of a medium-haul airliner such as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]]/MD-80.\n\nWhile HOTOL's [[proof-of-concept]] design study was being carried out, attempts were made by both industry and the British government to establish international cooperation to develop, produce, and deploy the spacecraft. In spite of American interest in the programme, there was little appetite amongst the members of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), and the British government was not prepared to depart from ESA cooperation. Additionally, technical issues were encountered, and there were allegations that comparisons with alternative launch systems such as conventional rocket vehicle using similar construction techniques failed to show much advantage to HOTOL. In 1989, funding for the project ended. The termination of development work on HOTOL led to the formation of [[Reaction Engines Limited]] (REL) to develop and produce [[Skylon (spacecraft)|Skylon]], a proposed spacecraft based on HOTOL technologies, including its engine.\n\n==Development==\n===Origins===\nThe ideas behind HOTOL originated from work done by British Engineer [[Alan Bond (engineer)|Alan Bond]] in the field of precooled jet engines. Bond had specifically performed this research with the intention of producing a viable engine for powering a space [[launch system]].<ref name=\"3rocket\">{{cite av media |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mqv45 |title=BBC Four: The Three Rocketeers |publisher = [[BBC]] |accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref> In 1982, [[British Aerospace]] (BAe), who was Europe's principal [[satellite]]-builder, began studying a prospective new launch system with the aim of providing launch costs that were 20 per cent of the American [[Space Shuttle]] operated by [[NASA]].<ref name = \"moxon 38\"/> BAe became aware of work by British engine manufacturer [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] on a suitable engine, and soon conceived of an unmanned, fully reuseable [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) winged spaceplane as a launch vehicle.<ref name = \"moxon 38\"/>\n\nThus, the project had soon became a joint venture between BAe and Rolls-Royce, led by [[John Scott-Scott (engineer)|John Scott-Scott]] and [[Bob Parkinson (aerospace engineer)|Dr Bob Parkinson]].<ref name = \"moxon 38\">Moxon 1986, p. 38.</ref> Early on, there was an ambition to 'Europeanise' the project and to involve other nations in its development and manufacture as it was recognised that an estimated \u00a34 billion would be needed to fund full-scale development.<ref name = \"moxon 38\"/> In August 1984, BAe unveiled a public display of the HOTOL satellite launcher project and released details on its proposed operations.<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/>\n\nIn December 1984, a [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) memorandum noted that [[West Germany]] was interested in the program, while [[France]] had adopted a critical attitude towards HOTOL, which the ministry viewed as potentially due to it being seen as a competitor to French-led projects. According to the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Minister of Trade and Industry]] [[Geoffrey Pattie]], French diplomatic pressure to gather support for its own proposed [[Hermes (spacecraft)|Hermes]] space vehicle had inadvertently generated support and interest amongst [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) members in the HOTOL project.<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/> Despite this climate of tentative interest and possible European support, there was a general attitude of reluctance within the British government to take the lead on a new space launcher.<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/>\n\n===American interest and design study===\nIn March 1985, there were claims that Rolls-Royce was in the process of conducting [[Licensed production|licensing]] talks for HOTOL engine technology with American propulsion company [[Rocketdyne]].<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/> In April 1985, Pattie wrote to [[Secretary of State for Defence]] [[Michael Heseltine]] to propose a two-year \u00a33 million [[proof of concept]] study be performed under a [[public-private partnership]] arrangement, consisting of \u00a31 million provided by the UK government and the remainder being financed by Rolls-Royce and BAe themselves. Pattie reasoned that the project would serve Britain's \"strategic capability, and that tests of key technologies could foster international collaboration.<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/> According to aerospace publication [[Flight International]], the support of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defense]] (MoD) was critical as the design of HOTOL's engine had been classified.<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/><ref name = \"moxon 38\"/>\n\nIn July 1985, Rolls-Royce's technical director Gordon Lewis stated that the firm sought the involvement of the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]]'s (RAE) propulsion group, and that Rolls-Royce was not prepared to invest its own funds into engine development for HOTOL.<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/> By the second half of 1985, work had commenced on the two-year concept-of-proof study.<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/> Early on, there was considerable pressure to demonstrate the project's feasibility and credibility in advance of final decisions being taken by the ESA on the Hermes and what would become the [[Ariane 5]] launch system, thus the work concentrated on the validation of critical technologies involved.<ref name = \"moxon 38\"/>\n\nBy November 1985, DTI and RAE discussions noted that Rolls-Royce were seeking American data on [[ramjet]] technology to support their work on the engine, which it referred to by the name ''Swallow''.<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/> Reportedly, the [[United States Air Force]] were interested in the technology used in the Swallow engine for its own purposes.<ref name = \"moxon 38\"/> In November 1985, discussions between [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Minister without portfolio]] [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|David Young]] and [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]'s scientific advisor [[George A. Keyworth, II|George Keyworth]] noted American interest in collaboration on developing [[hypersonic]] vehicles such as HOTOL, and that a prototype could be flying as early as 1990.<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/>\n\nAccording to British government files, neither BAe nor the MoD were enthusiastic for the prospects of American involvement in the programme, expressing reluctance out of a belief that the outcome of such a move could result in the UK becoming a junior member in a project that it once led.<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/> There was also a belief that if Britain chose to pair up with the United States, it would find itself frozen out of work on future European launchers.<ref name = \"moxon 38\"/> However, Rolls-Royce viewed transatlantic cooperation as necessary.<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/> BAe's head of future business, Peter Conchie, stated that, if possible, HOTOL should become a part of the European space framework.<ref name = \"moxon 38\"/> In early 1986, the British government formally approved the two-year study.<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/>\n\n===Problems and criticism===\nIn December 1984, project management consultant David Andrews issued an eight-page critique of the programme, noting that the design was optimised for the ascent while exposing itself to extended thermal loads during descent due to a low level of [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]]. He also claimed that the vehicle offered no capability that was not already available; BAe responded that the criticisms made had been answered.<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/> In April 1985, the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]'s research and development department deputy controller James Barnes claimed that HOTOL lacked a justification, and that there was no defence requirement for such vehicles. He also noted that the \"engineering problems are considerable\" and that it was unlikely to enter service until the 2020s; Barnes also observed the HOTOL engine to be \"ingenious\".<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/>\n\nIn November 1985, the RAE issued an assessment of HOTOL's study proposal; the organisation believe that HOTOL would take up to 20 years to develop, rather than the 12-year timetable that had been envisioned by industry. The RAE also projected that the project would have an estimated total cost of \u00a35 billion (as of its value in 1985), \u00a3750 million of which would be required in a six-year definition phase and an estimated \u00a325 million in a pre-definition feasibility study.<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/>\n\nDuring development, it was found that the comparatively heavy rear-mounted engine moved the centre of mass of the vehicle rearwards. This meant that the vehicle had to be designed to push the centre of drag as far rearward as possible to ensure stability during the entire flight regime. Redesign of the vehicle to do this required a large mass of hydraulic systems, which cost a significant proportion of the payload, and made the economics unclear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sounds.bl.uk/Oral-history/Science/021M-C1379X0005XX-0012V0|title=Oral history of British science|date=2010-11-08|publisher=British Library|accessdate=19 July 2016}}</ref> In particular, some of the analysis seemed to indicate that similar technology applied to a pure rocket approach would give approximately the same performance at less cost.\n\n===Shutdown===\nBy 1989, the outlook for HOTOL had become bleak; from the onset of the project, support between the British government and industrial partners had been uneven, while the United States had emerged as the only foreign nation that showed willingness to contribute to the programme,<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/> in part because of the secrecy surrounding the program. There was little prospect for European involvement, the ESA having elected to pursue development of what would become the [[Ariane 5]], a conventional space launch system.<ref name = \"secret 2009\"/> Rolls-Royce withdrew from the project, judging the eventual market for the engine was unlikely to be large enough to repay the development costs<ref name=\"Spaceflight 1993\"/>.  The British government declined to offer further funding for HOTOL. The project was almost at the end of its design phase while much of the plans remained in a speculative state; the craft was reportedly still dogged with aerodynamic problems and operational disadvantages at this point.\n\n===Successors===\nA cheaper redesign, '''Interim HOTOL''' or '''HOTOL 2''', which was to be launched from the back of a modified [[Antonov An-225 Mriya|Antonov An-225 ''Mriya'']] [[Cargo aircraft|transport aircraft]], was promoted by BAe in 1991; however, this proposal was rejected as well. The design for Interim HOTOL was to have dispensed with an air-breathing engine cycle and was designed to use a more conventional mix of LOX and liquid hydrogen as fuel instead.\n\nIn 1989, HOTOL co-creator [[Alan Bond (engineer)|Alan Bond]] and engineers John Scott-Scott and Richard Varvill formed [[Reaction Engines Limited]] (REL) which has since been working on a new air-breathing engine, [[SABRE (rocket engine)|SABRE]], which used alternative designs to work around (and improve upon) the Rolls-Royce patents, and the [[Skylon (spacecraft)|Skylon]] vehicle intended to solve the problems of HOTOL.

The unmanned craft was intended to put a payload of around 7 to 8 [[tonne]]s in orbit, at 300&nbsp;km altitude.<ref name = \"moxon 40\"/> It was intended to take off from a runway, mounted on the back of a large rocket-boosted trolley that would help get the craft up to \"working speed\". The engine was intended to switch from jet propulsion to pure rocket propulsion at 26\u201332&nbsp;km high, by which time the craft would be travelling at [[Mach number|Mach]] 5 to 7. After reaching [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), HOTOL was intended to re-enter the atmosphere and glide down to land on a conventional runway (approx 1,500 metres minimum). Only a single payload would have been carried at a time as BAe had judged this to be more economic as it removed any need for satellite interfacing and allowed for missions to be tailored to individual requirements.<ref name = \"moxon 40\"/>\n\nDuring its high-altitude phase, its [[flight control system]] would have been linked to ground stations and to space-based [[Global Positioning System|global navigation system]] navigation, while [[radar]] would have been used during the take-off and landing phases. In additional to the placing of satellites into [[geosynchronous orbit]] or LOE, HOTOL was also projected as being able to also perform the retrieval of satellites and hardware from LOE.<ref name = \"moxon 40\"/> BAe promotional material depicts HOTOL docking with the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), a feat that the company claimed would have required manned operate as automated systems were not capable of performing such docking manoeuvres at that time.<ref name = \"moxon 40\"/> HOTOL was designed to conduct fully automated unmanned flights; however, it had been intended at a later stage to potentially re-introduce a pilot. Manned operations would have required the installation of a dedicated [[Cabin pressurization|pressurised]] module within the payload bay.<ref name = \"moxon 40\"/>\n\nAs designed, HOTOL would have been 62 metres long, 12.8 metres high, a fuselage diameter of 5.7 meters and a wingspan of 19.7 metres.<ref name = \"moxon 40\"/> It featured a wing design that had been derived from that of [[Concorde]]; its large area resulted in relatively low wing loading, which would have resulted in lower reentry temperatures (never rising above 1,400&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name = \"moxon 40\"/> Built out of [[carbon composite]] materials, there would have been no need for the use of insulating tiles akin to those that comprised the [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system]].

Most hammerhead species are placed in the genus '''''Sphyrna''''', while the [[winghead shark]] is placed in its own genus, '''''Eusphyra'''''. Many, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, functions have been proposed for the cephalofoil, including sensory reception, manoeuvering, and prey manipulation. Hammerheads are found worldwide in warmer waters along coastlines and [[continental shelves]]. Unlike most sharks, hammerheads usually swim in schools during the day, becoming solitary hunters at night. Some of these schools can be found near [[Malpelo Island]] in [[Colombia]], [[Cocos Island]] off [[Costa Rica]], and near [[Molokai]] in [[Hawaii]]. Large schools are also seen in the waters off southern and [[eastern Africa]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:A man carries a huge hammerhead through the streets of Mogadishu.jpg|thumb|left|Man carrying a hammerhead in the streets of [[Mogadishu]] ([[Somalia]]).]]\nThe known [[species]] range from {{convert|0.9|to|6.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and weigh from {{convert|3|to|580|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref>Hessing, S.

However,  the unusual structure of its [[vertebra]]e  has been found to be instrumental in making the turns correctly, more often than the shape of its head, though it would also shift and provide lift.  From what is known about the winghead shark, the shape of the hammerhead apparently has to do with an evolved sensory function.  Like all sharks, hammerheads have [[electroreception|electroreceptory]] sensory pores called [[ampullae of Lorenzini]]. The pores on the shark's head lead to sensory tubes, which detect electricity given off by other living creatures.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Otfinoski|first1=Steven|title=Hammerheads and Other Sharks|date=2000|publisher=World Book, Inc.|isbn=0716612100|pages=16}}</ref> By distributing the receptors over a wider area, like a larger radio antenna, hammerheads can sweep for prey more effectively.<ref name= Hammer>{{cite web | first= R.

Aquatic Community. Retrieved on 2012-12-19.</ref> The hammerhead sharks exhibit a [[viviparous]] mode of reproduction with females giving birth to live young. Like other sharks, [[fertilization]] is internal, with the male transferring [[sperm]] to the female through one of two [[intromittent organ]]s called [[clasper]]s. The developing [[embryo]]s are at first sustained by a [[yolk sac]]. When the supply of [[yolk]] is exhausted, the depleted yolk sac transforms into a structure analogous to a [[mammal]]ian [[placenta]] (called a \"yolk sac placenta\" or \"pseudoplacenta\"), through which the mother delivers sustenance until birth. Once the baby sharks are born, they are not taken care of by the parents in any way. Usually, a litter consists of 12 to 15 pups, except for the great hammerhead, which gives birth to litters of 20 to 40 pups. These baby sharks huddle together and swim toward warmer water until they are old enough and large enough to survive on their own.<ref name= aquaticcommunity />\n\nIn 2007, the [[bonnethead]] shark was found to be capable of [[asexual reproduction]] via [[parthenogenesis|automictic parthenogenesis]], in which a female's [[ovum]] fuses with a [[polar body]] to form a [[zygote]] without the need for a male.

No human fatalities have been recorded.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/fish/isaf/contributing-factors/species-implicated-attacks/ |title=Statistics on Attacking Species of Shark |website=Florida Museum of Natural History |access-date=2017-12-27}}</ref>\n\nThe great and the scalloped hammerheads are listed on the World Conservation Union's ([[IUCN]]) 2008 Red List as [[Endangered species|endangered]], whereas the smalleye hammerhead is listed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. The status given to these sharks is as a result of [[overfishing]] and demand for their fins, an expensive delicacy. Among others, scientists expressed their concern about the plight of the scalloped hammerhead at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in [[Boston]]. The young swim mostly in shallow waters along shores all over the world to avoid predators.\n\nShark fins are prized as a delicacy in certain countries in Asia (such as China), and overfishing is putting many hammerhead sharks at risk of extinction. Fishermen who harvest the animals typically cut off the fins and toss the remainder of the fish, which is often still alive, back into the sea.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/25/AR2011022505123.html | title= Panamanian officials find half ton of shark fins |agency= Associated Press | website= WashingtonPost.com | date= 2011-02-25}}</ref> This practice, known as [[Shark finning|finning]], is lethal to the shark.\n\nIn native Hawaiian culture, sharks are considered to be gods of the sea, protectors of humans, and cleaners of excessive ocean life. Some of these sharks are believed to be family members who died and have been reincarnated into shark form. However, some sharks are considered man-eaters, also known as ''niuhi''. These sharks include [[great white sharks]], [[tiger sharks]], and [[bull sharks]]. The hammerhead shark, also known as ''mano kihikihi'', is not considered a man-eater or ''niuhi''; it is considered to be one of the most respected sharks of the ocean, an ''aumakua''. Many Hawaiian families believe that they have an ''aumakua'' watching over them and protecting them from the ''niuhi''. The hammerhead shark is thought to be the birth animal of some children. Hawaiian children who are born with the hammerhead shark as an animal sign are believed to be warriors and are meant to sail the oceans. Hammerhead sharks rarely pass through the waters of [[Maui]], but many Maui natives believe that their swimming by is a sign that the gods are watching over the families, and the oceans are clean and balanced.<ref>[http://www.moolelo.com/shark-respected.html Sharks Highly respected in Hawaiian Culture].

Current consists of the movement of many small [[charge carrier]]s, typically [[electron]]s, [[Electron hole|holes]], [[ion]]s (see [[Electromigration]]) or all three. When a magnetic field is present, these charges experience a force, called the [[Lorentz force]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eeel.nist.gov/812/effe.htm|accessdate=2008-02-28|title=The Hall Effect|publisher=[[NIST]]}}</ref> When such a magnetic field is absent, the charges follow approximately straight, 'line of sight' paths between collisions with impurities, [[phonons]], etc. However, when a  magnetic field with a perpendicular component is applied, their paths between collisions are curved, thus moving charges accumulate on one face of the material. This leaves equal and opposite charges exposed on the other face, where there is a scarcity of mobile charges. The result is an asymmetric distribution of charge density across the Hall element, arising from a force that is perpendicular to both the 'line of sight' path and the applied magnetic field. The separation of charge establishes an [[electric field]] that opposes the migration of further charge, so a steady [[electric potential]] is established for as long as the charge is flowing.\n\nIn [[classical electromagnetism]] electrons move in the opposite direction of the current {{math|''I''}} (by [[Electric current#Conventions|convention]] \"current\" describes a theoretical \"hole flow\"). In some semiconductors it ''appears'' \"holes\" are actually flowing because the direction of the voltage is opposite to the derivation below.\n\n[[File:Hall Effect Measurement Setup for Electrons.png|right|frame|Hall effect measurement setup for electrons. Initially, the electrons follow the curved arrow, due to the magnetic force. At some distance from the current-introducing contacts, electrons pile up on the left side and deplete from the right side, which creates an electric field {{math|''\u03be<sub>y</sub>''}} in the direction of the assigned {{math|''V''<sub>H</sub>}}. {{math|''V''<sub>H</sub>}} is negative for some semiconductors where \"holes\" appear to flow. In steady-state, {{math|''\u03be<sub>y</sub>''}} will be strong enough to exactly cancel out the magnetic force, thus the electrons follow the straight arrow (dashed).]]\n[[File:Hall Sensor.webm|thumb|Animation showing the simplified principle]]\nFor a simple metal where there is only one type of [[charge carrier]] (electrons), the Hall voltage {{math|''V''<sub>H</sub>}} can be derived by using the [[Lorentz force]] and seeing that, in the steady-state condition, charges are not moving in the {{math|''y''}}-axis direction. Thus, the magnetic force on each electron in the {{math|''y''}}-axis direction is cancelled by a {{math|''y''}}-axis electrical force due to the buildup of charges. The {{math|''v<sub>x</sub>''}} term is the [[drift velocity]] of the current which is assumed at this point to be holes by convention. The {{math|''v<sub>x</sub>B<sub>z</sub>''}} term is negative in the {{math|''y''}}-axis direction by the right hand rule.\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = q\\bigl(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\bigl)</math>\n\nIn steady state, {{math|'''F''' {{=}} '''0'''}}, so {{math|0 {{=}} ''E<sub>y</sub>'' \u2212 ''v<sub>x</sub>B<sub>z</sub>''}}, where {{math|''E<sub>y</sub>''}} is assigned in the direction of the {{math|''y''}}-axis, (and not with the arrow of the induced electric field {{math|''\u03be<sub>y</sub>''}} as in the image (pointing in the {{math|\u2212''y''}} direction), which tells you where the field caused by the electrons is pointing).\n\nIn wires, electrons instead of holes are flowing, so {{math|''v<sub>x</sub>'' \u2192 \u2212''v<sub>x</sub>''}} and {{math|''q'' \u2192 \u2212''q''}}.  Also {{math|''E<sub>y</sub>'' {{=}} \u2212{{sfrac|''V''<sub>H</sub>|''w''}}}}. Substituting these changes gives\n\n:<math>V_\\mathrm{H}= v_x B_z w</math>\n\nThe conventional \"hole\" current is in the negative direction of the electron current and the negative of the electrical charge which gives {{math|''I<sub>x</sub>'' {{=}} ''ntw''(\u2212''v<sub>x</sub>'')(\u2212''e'')}} where {{math|''n''}} is [[charge carrier density]], {{math|''tw''}} is the cross-sectional area, and {{math|\u2212''e''}} is the charge of each electron.  Solving for <math>w</math> and plugging into the above gives the Hall voltage:\n\n:<math>V_\\mathrm{H} = \\frac{I_x B_z}{n t e}</math>\n\nIf the charge build up had been positive (as it appears in some semiconductors), then the {{math|''V''<sub>H</sub>}} assigned in the image would have been negative (positive charge would have built up on the left side).\n\nThe Hall coefficient is defined as\n\n:<math>R_\\mathrm{H} =\\frac{E_y}{j_x B_z}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''j''}} is the [[current density]] of the carrier electrons, and {{math|''E<sub>y</sub>''}} is the induced electric field. In SI units, this becomes\n\n:<math>R_\\mathrm{H} =\\frac{E_y}{j_x B}= \\frac{V_\\mathrm{H} t}{IB}=-\\frac{1}{ne}.</math>\n\n(The units of {{math|''R''<sub>H</sub>}} are usually expressed as m<sup>3</sup>/C, or \u03a9\u00b7cm/[[Gauss (unit)|G]], or other variants.) As a result, the Hall effect is very useful as a means to measure either the carrier density or the magnetic field.\n\nOne very important feature of the Hall effect is that it differentiates between positive charges moving in one direction and negative charges moving in the opposite. The Hall effect offered the first real proof that electric currents in metals are carried by moving electrons, not by protons. The Hall effect also showed that in some substances (especially [[p-type semiconductor]]s), it is more appropriate to think of the current as positive \"[[Electron hole|holes]]\" moving rather than negative electrons. A common source of confusion with the Hall effect is that holes moving to the left are really electrons moving to the right, so one expects the same sign of the Hall coefficient for both electrons and holes. This confusion, however, can only be resolved by modern quantum mechanical theory of transport in solids.<ref>N.W. Ashcroft and N.D. Mermin \"Solid State Physics\" {{ISBN|978-0-03-083993-1}}</ref>\n\nThe sample inhomogeneity might result in spurious sign of the Hall effect, even in ideal [[Van der Pauw method|van der Pauw]] configuration of electrodes. For example, positive Hall effect was observed in evidently n-type semiconductors.<ref>T. Ohgaki et al. \"Positive Hall coefficients obtained from contact misplacement on evident n-type ZnO films and crystals\" [https://dx.doi.org/10.1557/JMR.2008.0300 J. Mat. Res. 23(9) (2008) 2293]</ref> Another source of artifact, in uniform materials, occurs when the sample's aspect ratio is not long enough: the full Hall voltage only develops far away from the current-introducing contacts, since at the contacts the transverse voltage is shorted out to zero.\n\n===Hall effect in semiconductors===\nWhen a current-carrying [[semiconductor]] is kept in a magnetic field, the charge carriers of the semiconductor experience a force in a direction perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the current. At equilibrium, a voltage appears at the semiconductor edges.\n\nThe simple formula for the Hall coefficient given above is usually a good explanation when conduction is dominated by a single [[charge carrier]]. However, in semiconductors the theory is more complex, because in these materials conduction can involve significant, simultaneous contributions from both [[electrons]] and [[Electron hole|holes]], which may be present in different concentrations and have different [[Electron mobility|mobilities]].

(Note that this effect is ''not'' due to the contribution of the [[magnetization]] to the total [[magnetic field]].)

'''20''' 023201 -->\n\n=== Hall effect in ionized gases ===\nThe Hall effect in an ionized gas ([[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) is significantly different from the Hall effect in solids (where the '''Hall parameter''' is always much less than unity). In a plasma, the Hall parameter can take any value. The Hall parameter, {{math|''\u03b2''}}, in a plasma is the ratio between the electron [[Gyroradius|gyrofrequency]], {{math|''\u03a9''<sub>e</sub>}}, and the electron-heavy particle collision frequency, {{math|''\u03bd''}}:\n\n:<math>\\beta=\\frac {\\Omega_\\mathrm{e}}{\\nu}=\\frac {eB}{m_\\mathrm{e}\\nu}</math>\n\nwhere\n* {{math|''e''}} is the [[elementary charge]] (approximately {{val|1.6e-19|ul=C}})\n* {{math|''B''}} is the magnetic field (in [[tesla (unit)|teslas]])\n* {{math|''m''<sub>e</sub>}} is the [[electron|electron mass]] (approximately {{val|9.1e-31|u=kg}}).\n\nThe Hall parameter value increases with the magnetic field strength.\n\nPhysically, the trajectories of electrons are curved by the [[Lorentz force]]. Nevertheless, when the Hall parameter is low, their motion between two encounters with heavy particles ([[Neutral particle|neutral]] or [[ion]]) is almost linear. But if the Hall parameter is high, the electron movements are highly curved. The [[current density]] vector, {{math|'''J'''}}, is no longer collinear with the [[electric field]] vector, {{math|'''E'''}}. The two vectors {{math|'''J'''}} and {{math|'''E'''}} make the '''Hall angle''', {{math|''\u03b8''}}, which also gives the Hall parameter:\n\n:<math>\\beta = \\tan(\\theta).</math>\n\n==Applications==\n[[Hall probe]]s are often used as [[magnetometer]]s, i.e. to measure magnetic fields, or inspect materials (such as tubing or pipelines) using the principles of [[magnetic flux leakage]].\n\nHall effect devices produce a very low signal level and thus require amplification. While suitable for laboratory instruments, the [[vacuum tube]] [[amplifier]]s available in the first half of the 20th century were too expensive, power consuming, and unreliable for everyday applications. It was only with the development of the low cost [[integrated circuit]] that the Hall effect sensor became suitable for mass application. Many devices now sold as [[Hall effect sensor]]s in fact contain both the sensor as described above plus a high gain [[integrated circuit]] (IC) amplifier in a single package. Recent advances have further added into one package an [[analog-to-digital converter]] and [[I\u00b2C]] (Inter-integrated circuit communication protocol) IC for direct connection to a [[microcontroller]]'s I/O port.\n\n===Advantages over other methods===\nHall effect devices (when appropriately packaged) are immune to dust, dirt, mud, and water. These characteristics make Hall effect devices better for position sensing than alternative means such as optical and electromechanical sensing.\n[[Image:HallEffCurrentSense.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hall effect current sensor with internal integrated circuit amplifier. 8 mm opening. Zero current output voltage is midway between the supply voltages that maintain a 4 to 8 volt differential. Non-zero current response is proportional to the voltage supplied and is linear to 60 amperes for this particular (25&nbsp;A) device.]]\nWhen electrons flow through a conductor, a magnetic field is produced. Thus, it is possible to create a non-contacting current sensor. The device has three terminals.\nA sensor voltage is applied across two terminals and the third provides a voltage proportional to the current being sensed. This has several advantages; no additional resistance (a [[Shunt (electrical)|''shunt'']], required for the most common current sensing method) need to be inserted in the primary circuit. Also, the voltage present on the line to be sensed is not transmitted to the sensor, which enhances the safety of measuring equipment.\n\n===Disadvantages compared with other methods===\nMagnetic flux from the surroundings (such as other wires) may diminish or enhance the field the Hall probe intends to detect, rendering the results inaccurate. Also, as Hall voltage is often on the order of millivolts, the output from this type of sensor cannot be used to directly drive actuators but instead must be amplified by a [[transistor]]-based circuit.\n\nWays to measure mechanical positions within an electromagnetic system, such as a brushless direct current motor, include (1) the Hall effect, (2) optical position encoder (e.g., absolute and [[incremental encoder]]s) and (3) induced voltage by moving the amount of metal core inserted into a transformer. When Hall is compared to photo-sensitive methods, it is harder to get absolute position with Hall. Hall detection is also sensitive to stray magnetic fields.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Contemporary applications===\nHall effect sensors are readily available from a number of different manufacturers, and may be used in various sensors such as rotating speed sensors (bicycle wheels, gear-teeth, automotive speedometers, electronic ignition systems), fluid [[flow sensor]]s, [[current sensor]]s, and [[pressure sensor]]s. Common applications are often found where a robust and contactless switch or potentiometer is required. These include: electric [[airsoft]] guns, triggers of electropneumatic [[paintball marker|paintball guns]], go-cart speed controls, smart phones, and some global positioning systems.\n\n====Ferrite toroid Hall effect current transducer====\n[[Image:RAZC-GENARRv1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Diagram of Hall effect current transducer integrated into ferrite ring.]]\n\nHall sensors can detect stray magnetic fields easily, including that of Earth, so they work well as electronic compasses: but this also means that such stray fields can hinder accurate measurements of small magnetic fields. To solve this problem, Hall sensors are often integrated with magnetic shielding of some kind. For example, a Hall sensor integrated into a ferrite ring (as shown) can reduce the detection of stray fields by a factor of 100 or better (as the external magnetic fields cancel across the ring, giving no residual [[magnetic flux]]). This configuration also provides an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio and drift effects of over 20 times that of a bare Hall device.\n\nThe range of a given feedthrough sensor may be extended upward and downward by appropriate wiring. To extend the range to lower currents, multiple turns of the current-carrying wire may be made through the opening, each turn adding to the sensor output the same quantity; when the sensor is installed onto a printed circuit board, the turns can be carried out by a staple on the board. To extend the range to higher currents, a current divider may be used. The divider splits the current across two wires of differing widths and the thinner wire, carrying a smaller proportion of the total current, passes through the sensor.\n\n[[Image:Ampere-Turnsv1.jpg|thumb|250px|Multiple 'turns' and corresponding transfer function.]]\n\n====Split ring clamp-on sensor====\nA variation on the ring sensor uses a [[Current clamp#Hall effect|split sensor]] which is clamped onto the line enabling the device to be used in temporary test equipment. If used in a permanent installation, a split sensor allows the electric current to be tested without dismantling the existing circuit.\n\n====Analog multiplication====\nThe output is proportional to both the applied magnetic field and the applied sensor voltage.  If the magnetic field is applied by a solenoid, the sensor output is proportional to the product of the current through the solenoid and the sensor voltage. As most applications requiring computation are now performed by small [[computer|digital computers]], the remaining useful application is in power sensing, which combines current sensing with voltage sensing in a single Hall effect device.\n\n====Power measurement====\nBy sensing the current provided to a load and using the device's applied voltage as a sensor voltage it is possible to determine the power dissipated by a device.\n\n====Position and motion sensing====\nHall effect devices used in motion sensing and motion limit switches can offer enhanced reliability in extreme environments. As there are no moving parts involved within the sensor or magnet, typical life expectancy is improved compared to traditional electromechanical switches. Additionally, the sensor and magnet may be encapsulated in an appropriate protective material. This application is used in [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless DC motors]].\n\nHall effect sensors, affixed to mechanical gauges that have magnetized indicator needles, can translate the physical position or orientation of the mechanical indicator needle into an electrical signal that can be used by electronic indicators, controls or communications devices.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\">[http://www.leveldevilsensors.com/main/electronic-sensors-inc-esi-level-devil-american-made-tank-monitors-and-tank-monitoring-systems/tabk-sensor/ Tank Sensors & Probes], Electronic Sensors, Inc., retrieved August 8, 2018</ref>\n\n====Automotive ignition and fuel injection====\nCommonly used in distributors for ignition timing (and in some types of crank and camshaft position sensors for injection pulse timing, speed sensing, etc.) the Hall effect sensor is used as a direct replacement for the mechanical breaker points used in earlier automotive applications. Its use as an ignition timing device in various distributor types is as follows. A stationary permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall effect chip are mounted next to each other separated by an air gap, forming the Hall effect sensor. A metal rotor consisting of windows and tabs is mounted to a shaft and arranged so that during shaft rotation, the windows and tabs pass through the air gap between the permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall chip. This effectively shields and exposes the Hall chip to the permanent magnet's field respective to whether a tab or window is passing through the Hall sensor. For ignition timing purposes, the metal rotor will have a number of equal-sized tabs and windows matching the number of engine cylinders. This produces a uniform square wave output since the on/off (shielding and exposure) time is equal. This signal is used by the engine computer or ECU to control ignition timing. Many automotive Hall effect sensors have a built-in internal NPN transistor with an [[open collector]] and grounded emitter, meaning that rather than a voltage being produced at the Hall sensor signal output wire, the transistor is turned on providing a circuit to ground through the signal output wire.\n\n====Wheel rotation sensing====\nThe sensing of wheel rotation is especially useful in [[anti-lock braking system]]s. The principles of such systems have been extended and refined to offer more than anti-skid functions, now providing extended vehicle [[automobile handling|handling]] enhancements.\n\n====Electric motor control====\nSome types of [[brushless DC electric motor]]s use Hall effect sensors to detect the position of the rotor and feed that information to the motor controller. This allows for more precise motor control.\n\n====Industrial applications====\nApplications for Hall effect sensing have also expanded to industrial applications, which now use Hall effect [[Joystick#Industrial applications|joysticks]] to control hydraulic valves, replacing the traditional mechanical levers with contactless sensing. Such applications include mining trucks, backhoe loaders, cranes, diggers, scissor lifts, etc.\n\n====Spacecraft propulsion====\nA [[Hall-effect thruster]] (HET) is a relatively low power device that is used to propel some [[spacecraft]], after it gets into [[orbit]] or farther out into space. In the HET, [[atom]]s are [[ionization|ionized]] and accelerated by an [[electric field]]. A radial magnetic field established by magnets on the thruster is used to trap [[electron]]s which then orbit and create an [[electric field]] due to the Hall effect. A large potential is established between the end of the thruster where neutral propellant is fed, and the part where electrons are produced; so, electrons trapped in the magnetic field cannot drop to the lower potential.  They are thus extremely energetic, which means that they can ionize neutral atoms. Neutral propellant is pumped into the chamber and is ionized by the trapped electrons.  Positive ions and electrons are then ejected from the thruster as a quasineutral [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], creating thrust.\n\n==The Corbino effect==\n[[File:Corbino disc by Zureks.svg|thumb|Corbino disc \u2013 dashed curves represent [[logarithmic spiral]] paths of deflected electrons]]\n\nThe [[Orso Mario Corbino|Corbino]] effect is a phenomenon involving the Hall effect, but a disc-shaped metal sample is used in place of a rectangular one. Because of its shape the Corbino disc allows the observation of Hall effect\u2013based [[magnetoresistance]] without the associated Hall voltage.\n\nA radial current through a circular disc, subjected to a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the disc, produces a \"circular\" current through the disc.<ref name=\"Adams1915\">{{Cite book|title=The Hall and Corbino effects|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|year=1915|first=E.

It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the [[Great Depression]] and was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives. Originally known as '''Boulder Dam''' from 1933, it was officially renamed Hoover Dam, for [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]], by a joint resolution of Congress in 1947.\n\nSince about 1900, the Black Canyon and nearby [[Boulder Canyon (Colorado River)|Boulder Canyon]] had been investigated for their potential to support a dam that would control floods, provide irrigation water and produce [[hydroelectric power]]. In 1928, Congress authorized the project. The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called [[Six Companies, Inc.]], which began construction on the dam in early 1931. Such a large concrete structure had never been built before, and some of the techniques were unproven. The torrid summer weather and lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties. Nevertheless, Six Companies turned the dam over to the federal government on March 1, 1936, more than two years ahead of schedule.\n\nHoover Dam impounds [[Lake Mead]], the largest reservoir in the United States by volume (when it is full).<ref name=\"USBR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/tsc/eco_research/eco5.html |title=Reservoir Monitoring & Research |work=usbr.gov |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906043817/http://www.usbr.gov/tsc/eco_research/eco5.html |archivedate=2015-09-06 |df= }} (dead link)</ref> The dam is located near [[Boulder City, Nevada]], a municipality originally constructed for workers on the construction project, about {{convert|abbr=on|30|mi}} southeast of [[Las Vegas]], Nevada. The dam's generators provide power for public and private utilities in Nevada, Arizona, and California. Hoover Dam is a major tourist attraction; nearly a million people tour the dam each year. The heavily traveled [[U.S. Route 93]] (US&nbsp;93) ran along the dam's crest until October 2010, when the [[Mike O'Callaghan\u2013Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge|Hoover Dam Bypass]] opened.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Search for resources ===\n\nAs the United States developed the Southwest, the Colorado River was seen as a potential source of irrigation water. An initial attempt at diverting the river for irrigation purposes occurred in the late 1890s, when land speculator William Beatty built the [[Alamo Canal]] just north of the Mexican border; the canal dipped into Mexico before running to a desolate area Beatty named the [[Imperial Valley]].{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=20\u201327}} Though water from the Imperial Canal allowed for the widespread settlement of the valley, the canal proved expensive to maintain. After a catastrophic breach that caused the Colorado River to fill the [[Salton Sea]],{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=41\u201350}} the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] spent $3&nbsp;million in 1906\u201307 to stabilize the waterway, an amount it hoped in vain would be reimbursed by the Federal Government. Even after the waterway was stabilized, it proved unsatisfactory because of constant disputes with landowners on the Mexican side of the border.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=57\u201360}}\n\n[[File:Hoover-dam-site.jpg|thumb|left|River view of the future dam site, {{circa|1904}}]]\n\nAs the technology of [[electric power transmission]] improved, the [[Lower Colorado River Valley|Lower Colorado]] was considered for its [[hydroelectric]]-power potential. In 1902, the [[Southern California Edison|Edison Electric Company of Los Angeles]] surveyed the river in the hope of building a {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}} rock dam which could generate {{convert|10,000|hp}}. However, at the time, the limit of transmission of electric power was {{convert|80|mi}}, and there were few customers (mostly mines) within that limit. Edison allowed land options it held on the river to lapse\u2014including an option for what became the site of Hoover Dam.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nIn the following years, the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] (BOR), known as the Reclamation Service at the time, also considered the Lower Colorado as the site for a dam. Service chief [[Arthur Powell Davis]] proposed using dynamite to collapse the walls of Boulder Canyon,{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=58\u201359}} {{convert|20|mi}} north of the eventual dam site, into the river.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=2}} The river would carry off the smaller pieces of debris, and a dam would be built incorporating the remaining rubble. In 1922, after considering it for several years, the Reclamation Service finally rejected the proposal, citing doubts about the unproven technique and questions as to whether it would in fact save money.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=58\u201359}}\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Planning and agreements ===\n\n[[File:Boulder damsite sketch.jpg|thumb|left|Sketch of the proposed dam site and reservoir, {{circa|1921}}]]\nIn 1922, the Reclamation Service presented a report calling for the development of a dam on the Colorado River for flood control and electric power generation. The report was principally authored by Davis, and was called the Fall-Davis report after Interior Secretary [[Albert Fall]]. The Fall-Davis report cited use of the Colorado River as a federal concern because the river's basin covered several states, and the river eventually entered Mexico.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=67}} Though the Fall-Davis report called for a dam \"at or near Boulder Canyon\", the Reclamation Service (which was renamed the Bureau of Reclamation the following year) found that canyon unsuitable.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=68}} One potential site at Boulder Canyon was bisected by a [[geologic fault]]; two others were so narrow there was no space for a construction camp at the bottom of the canyon{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=68}} or for a spillway. The Service investigated Black Canyon and found it ideal; a railway could be laid from the railhead in Las Vegas to the top of the dam site.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=6}} Despite the site change, the dam project was referred to as the \"Boulder Canyon Project\".{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=26\u201327}}\n\nWith little guidance on water allocation from the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], proponents of the dam feared endless litigation. A Colorado attorney proposed that the seven states which fell within the river's basin (California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming) form an [[interstate compact]], with the approval of Congress. Such compacts were authorized by [[Article I of the United States Constitution]] but had never been concluded among more than two states. In 1922, representatives of seven states met with then-[[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]].{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=73\u201379}} Initial talks produced no result, but when the Supreme Court handed down the ''[[Wyoming v. Colorado]]'' decision undermining the claims of the upstream states, they became anxious to reach an agreement. The resulting [[Colorado River Compact]] was signed on November 24, 1922.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=81\u201387}}\n\nLegislation to authorize the dam was introduced repeatedly by two California Republicans, Representative [[Phil Swing]] and Senator [[Hiram Johnson]], but representatives from other parts of the country considered the project as hugely expensive and one that would mostly benefit California. The [[1927 Mississippi flood]] made Midwestern and Southern congressmen and senators more sympathetic toward the dam project. On March 12, 1928, the failure of the [[St. Francis Dam]], constructed by the city of Los Angeles, caused a disastrous flood that killed up to 600 people. As that dam was a curved-gravity type,<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Rogers | first = J. David |date=September 28, 2007 |url= http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/st_francis_dam/index.htm |title= Impacts of the 1928 St. Francis Dam Failure on Geology, Civil Engineering, and America |journal= 2007 Annual Meeting Association of Environmental and Engineering Geologists |publisher= Missouri University of Science & Technology}}</ref> similar in design to the arch-gravity as was proposed for the Black Canyon dam, opponents claimed that the Black Canyon dam's safety could not be guaranteed. Congress authorized a board of engineers to review plans for the proposed dam. The Colorado River Board found the project feasible, but warned that should the dam fail, every downstream Colorado River community would be destroyed, and that the river might change course and empty into the Salton Sea. The Board cautioned: \"To avoid such possibilities, the proposed dam should be constructed on conservative if not ultra-conservative lines.\"{{sfn|Rogers|2010}}\n\nOn December 21, 1928, [[Calvin Coolidge|President Coolidge]] signed the bill authorizing the dam.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=118}} The Boulder Canyon Project Act appropriated $165&nbsp;million for the Hoover Dam along with the downstream [[Imperial Dam]] and [[All-American Canal]], a replacement for Beatty's canal entirely on the U.S. side of the border.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=27}} It also permitted the compact to go into effect when at least six of the seven states approved it. This occurred on March 6, 1929, with Utah's ratification; Arizona did not approve it until 1944.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=120}}\n\n=== Design, preparation and contracting ===\n[[File:Hoover-dam-contour-map.jpg|left|thumb|Hoover Dam architectural plans]]\nEven before Congress approved the Boulder Canyon Project, the Bureau of Reclamation was considering what kind of dam should be used. Officials eventually decided on a massive concrete [[arch-gravity dam]], the design of which was overseen by the Bureau's chief design engineer [[John L. Savage]]. The monolithic dam would be thick at the bottom and thin near the top, and would present a convex face towards the water above the dam. The curving arch of the dam would transmit the water's force into the abutments, in this case the rock walls of the canyon. The wedge-shaped dam would be {{convert|abbr=on|660|ft}} thick at the bottom, narrowing to {{convert|abbr=on|45|ft}} at the top, leaving room for a highway connecting Nevada and Arizona.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nOn January 10, 1931, the Bureau made the bid documents available to interested parties, at five dollars a copy. The government was to provide the materials; but the contractor was to prepare the site and build the dam. The dam was described in minute detail, covering 100&nbsp;pages of text and 76&nbsp;drawings. A $2&nbsp;million [[bid bond]] was to accompany each bid; the winner would have to post a $5&nbsp;million [[performance bond]]. The contractor had seven years to build the dam, or penalties would ensue.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=34}}\n\nThe [[Wattis Brothers]], heads of the [[Utah Construction Company]], were interested in bidding on the project, but lacked the money for the performance bond. They lacked sufficient resources even in combination with their longtime partners, [[Morrison-Knudsen]], which employed the nation's leading dam builder, [[Frank Crowe]]. They formed a joint venture to bid for the project with Pacific Bridge Company of [[Portland, Oregon]]; [[Henry J. Kaiser]] & W. A. [[Bechtel Corporation|Bechtel Company]] of San Francisco; MacDonald & Kahn Ltd. of Los Angeles; and the J.F. Shea Company of Portland, Oregon.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=35\u201342}} The joint venture was called [[Six Companies, Inc.]] as Bechtel and Kaiser were considered one company for purposes of Six in the name. The name was descriptive and was an inside joke among the San Franciscans in the bid, where \"Six Companies\" was also a [[Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association|Chinese benevolent association in the city]].{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=174}} There were three valid bids, and Six Companies' bid of $48,890,955 was the lowest, within $24,000 of the confidential government estimate of what the dam would cost to build, and five million dollars less than the next-lowest bid.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=45\u201346}}\n\nThe city of Las Vegas had lobbied hard to be the headquarters for the dam construction, closing its many [[speakeasy|speakeasies]] when the decision maker, Secretary of the Interior [[Ray Wilbur]], came to town. Instead, Wilbur announced in early 1930 that a model city was to be built in the desert near the dam site. This town became known as [[Boulder City, Nevada]]. Construction of a rail line joining Las Vegas and the dam site began in September 1930.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=144\u2013145}}\n\n== Construction ==\n\n=== Labor force ===\n\n[[File:HooverDamJumboRig.jpg|thumb|Workers on a \"Jumbo Rig\"; used for drilling Hoover Dam's tunnels]]\n\n[[File:\"Apache Indians employed as high-scalers on the construction of Hoover Dam.\" - NARA - 293746.tif|thumb|\"Apache Indians employed as high-scalers on the construction of Hoover Dam.\" \u2013 NARA]]\n\nSoon after the dam was authorized, increasing numbers of unemployed people converged on southern Nevada. Las Vegas, then a small city of some 5,000, saw between 10,000 and 20,000 unemployed descend on it.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=28}} A government camp was established for surveyors and other personnel near the dam site; this soon became surrounded by a squatters' camp. Known as McKeeversville, the camp was home to men hoping for work on the project, together with their families.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=32}} Another camp, on the flats along the Colorado River, was officially called Williamsville, but was known to its inhabitants as \"Ragtown\".{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=53\u201354}} When construction began, Six Companies hired large numbers of workers, with more than 3,000 on the payroll by 1932{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=194}} and with employment peaking at 5,251 in July 1934.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=317}} \"Mongolian\" (Chinese) labor was prevented by the construction contract,{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=317}} while the number of blacks employed by Six Companies never exceeded thirty, mostly lowest-pay-scale laborers in a segregated crew, who were issued separate water buckets.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=315}}\n\nAs part of the contract, Six Companies, Inc. was to build Boulder City to house the workers. The original timetable called for Boulder City to be built before the dam project began, but President Hoover ordered work on the dam to begin in March 1931 rather than in October.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=65}} The company built bunkhouses, attached to the canyon wall, to house 480&nbsp;single men at what became known as River Camp. Workers with families were left to provide their own accommodations until Boulder City could be completed,{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=56}} and many lived in Ragtown.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=40}} The site of Hoover Dam endures extremely hot weather, and the summer of 1931 was especially torrid, with the daytime high averaging {{convert|abbr=on|119.9|\u00b0F |\u00b0C}}.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=219\u2013220}} Sixteen workers and other riverbank residents died of [[heat prostration]] between June 25 and July 26, 1931.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=223}}\n\n[[File:FrankCrowe.jpg|thumb|left|General Superintendent [[Frank Crowe]] ''(right)'' with Bureau of Reclamation engineer Walker Young in 1935]]\n\nThe [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW or \"Wobblies\"), though much-reduced from their heyday as militant labor organizers in the early years of the century, hoped to unionize the Six Companies workers by capitalizing on their discontent. They sent eleven organizers,{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=226\u2013228}} several of whom were arrested by Las Vegas police.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=230}} On August 7, 1931, the company cut wages for all tunnel workers. Although the workers sent away the organizers, not wanting to be associated with the \"Wobblies\", they formed a committee to represent them with the company. The committee drew up a list of demands that evening and presented them to Crowe the following morning. He was noncommittal. The workers hoped that Crowe, the general superintendent of the job, would be sympathetic; instead he gave a scathing interview to a newspaper, describing the workers as \"malcontents\".{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=234\u2013237}}\n\nOn the morning of the 9th, Crowe met with the committee and told them that management refused their demands, was stopping all work, and was laying off the entire work force, except for a few office workers and carpenters. The workers were given until 5&nbsp;p.m. to vacate the premises. Concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent, most workers took their paychecks and left for Las Vegas to await developments.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=70\u201373}} Two days later, the remainder were talked into leaving by law enforcement. On August 13, the company began hiring workers again, and two days later, the strike was called off.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=73\u201378}} While the workers received none of their demands, the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages. Living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into Boulder City in late 1931.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=78}}\n\nA second labor action took place in July 1935, as construction on the dam wound down. When a Six Companies manager altered working times to force workers to take lunch on their own time, workers responded with a strike. Emboldened by Crowe's reversal of the lunch decree, workers raised their demands to include a $1-per-day raise. The company agreed to ask the Federal government to supplement the pay, but no money was forthcoming from Washington. The strike ended.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=362\u2013365}}\n\n=== River diversion ===\n[[File:Hoover-summary-map.jpg|thumb|Overview of dam mechanisms; diversion tunnels shown]]\nBefore the dam could be built, the [[Colorado River]] needed to be diverted away from the construction site. To accomplish this, four diversion tunnels were driven through the canyon walls, two on the [[Nevada]] side and two on the [[Arizona]] side. These tunnels were {{convert|abbr=on|56|ft|m}} in diameter.<ref name=\"usbrfaq\" /> Their combined length was nearly 16,000&nbsp;ft, or more than {{convert|3|mi|km|0}}.<ref name=\"hovtun\" /> The contract required these tunnels to be completed by October 1, 1933, with a $3,000-per-day fine to be assessed for any delay. To meet the deadline, Six Companies had to complete work by early 1933, since only in late fall and winter was the water level in the river low enough to safely divert.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=84}}\n\nTunneling began at the lower portals of the Nevada tunnels in May 1931. Shortly afterward, work began on two similar tunnels in the Arizona canyon wall. In March 1932, work began on lining the tunnels with concrete. First the base, or invert, was poured. [[Gantry crane]]s, running on rails through the entire length of each tunnel were used to place the concrete. The sidewalls were poured next. Movable sections of steel forms were used for the sidewalls. Finally, using pneumatic guns, the overheads were filled in. The concrete lining is {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} thick, reducing the finished tunnel diameter to {{convert|abbr=on|50|ft}}.<ref name=\"hovtun\" /> The river was diverted into the two Arizona tunnels on November 13, 1932; the Nevada tunnels were kept in reserve for high water. This was done by exploding a temporary [[cofferdam]] protecting the Arizona tunnels while at the same time dumping rubble into the river until its natural course was blocked.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=305\u2013306}}\n\nFollowing the completion of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels.<ref name=\"hovtun\" /> The inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works.<ref name=\"usbrfaq\" /> The inner tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to drain the tunnels for maintenance.<ref name=\"usbrfaq\" />\n\n=== Groundworks, rock clearance and grout curtain ===\nTo protect the construction site from the Colorado River and to facilitate the river's diversion, two cofferdams were constructed. Work on the upper cofferdam began in September 1932, even though the river had not yet been diverted.<ref name=\"USBR, Cofferdams\" /> The cofferdams were designed to protect against the possibility of the river's flooding a site at which two thousand men might be at work, and their specifications were covered in the bid documents in nearly as much detail as the dam itself. The upper cofferdam was {{convert|abbr=on|96|ft}} high, and {{convert|750|ft}} thick at its base, thicker than the dam itself. It contained {{convert|650,000|cuyd}} of material.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=318\u2013319}}\n\n[[File:HooverDamHighScaler.jpg|left|thumb|Looking down at \"high scalers\" above the Colorado River]]\n\nWhen the cofferdams were in place and the construction site was drained of water, excavation for the dam foundation began. For the dam to rest on solid rock, it was necessary to remove [[Fluvial|accumulated erosion soils]] and other loose materials in the riverbed until sound bedrock was reached. Work on the foundation excavations was completed in June 1933. During this excavation, approximately {{convert|abbr=on|1,500,000 |cuyd}} of material was removed. Since the dam was an arch-gravity type, the side-walls of the canyon would bear the force of the impounded lake. Therefore, the side-walls were excavated too, to reach virgin rock, as weathered rock might provide pathways for water seepage.<ref name=\"USBR, Cofferdams\" /> Shovels for the excavation came from the [[Marion Power Shovel Company]]. <ref>Olberhelman, Olberhelman, and Lampe. Quail Lakes & Coal: Energy for Wildlife ... and the World, 2013, page 60</ref>\n\nThe men who removed this rock were called \"high scalers\". While suspended from the top of the canyon with ropes, the high-scalers climbed down the canyon walls and removed the loose rock with [[jackhammers]] and [[dynamite]]. Falling objects were the most common cause of death on the dam site; the high scalers' work thus helped ensure worker safety.<ref name=\"USBR, High Scalers\" /> One high scaler was able to save a life in a more direct manner: when a government inspector lost his grip on a safety line and began tumbling down a slope towards almost certain death, a high scaler was able to intercept him and pull him into the air. The construction site had, even then, become a magnet for tourists; the high scalers were prime attractions and showed off for the watchers. The high scalers received considerable media attention, with one worker dubbed the \"Human Pendulum\" for swinging co-workers (and, at other times, cases of dynamite) across the canyon.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=308\u2013309}} To protect themselves against falling objects, some high scalers took cloth hats and dipped them in tar, allowing them to harden. When workers wearing such headgear were struck hard enough to inflict broken jaws, they sustained no skull damage, Six Companies ordered thousands of what initially were called \"hard boiled hats\" (later \"[[hard hat]]s\") and strongly encouraged their use.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=104}}\n\nThe cleared, underlying rock foundation of the dam site was reinforced with grout, called a [[grout curtain]]. Holes were driven into the walls and base of the canyon, as deep as {{convert|150|ft}} into the rock, and any cavities encountered were to be filled with grout. This was done to stabilize the rock, to prevent water from seeping past the dam through the canyon rock, and to limit \"uplift\"\u2014upward pressure from water seeping under the dam. The workers were under severe time constraints due to the beginning of the concrete pour, and when they encountered hot springs or cavities too large to readily fill, they moved on without resolving the problem. A total of 58 of the 393 holes were incompletely filled.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=331\u2013332}} After the dam was completed and the lake began to fill, large numbers of significant leaks into the dam caused the Bureau of Reclamation to look into the situation. It found that the work had been incompletely done, and was based on less than a full understanding of the canyon's geology. New holes were drilled from inspection galleries inside the dam into the surrounding bedrock.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=387\u2013390}} It took nine years (1938\u201347) under relative secrecy to complete the supplemental grout curtain.<ref name=\"Rogers 2005\" />\n\n=== Concrete ===\n\n[[File:Damforms.jpg|thumb|Columns of Hoover Dam being filled with concrete, February 1934 ''(looking upstream from the Nevada rim)'']]\n\nThe first concrete was poured into the dam on June 6, 1933, 18&nbsp;months ahead of schedule.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=323\u2013324}} Since concrete [[Thermal expansion|heats and contracts]] as it cures, the potential for uneven cooling and contraction of the concrete posed a serious problem. Bureau of Reclamation engineers calculated that if the dam were to be built in a single continuous pour, the concrete would take 125 years to cool, and the resulting stresses would cause the dam to crack and crumble. Instead, the ground where the dam would rise was marked with rectangles, and concrete blocks in columns were poured, some as large as {{convert|abbr=on|50|ft|m |adj=mid|square}} and {{convert|5|ft}} high.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=325\u2013326}} Each five-foot form contained a series of {{convert|1|in |adj=on}} steel pipes; cool riverwater would be poured through the pipes, followed by ice-cold water from a [[refrigeration]] plant. When an individual block had cured and had stopped contracting, the pipes were filled with [[grout]]. Grout was also used to fill the hairline spaces between columns, which were grooved to increase the strength of the joins.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=193\u2013194}}\n\nThe concrete was delivered in huge steel buckets {{convert|7|ft|m|disp=x| high (|)}} and almost 7&nbsp;feet in diameter; Crowe was awarded two patents for their design. These buckets, which weighed {{convert|20|ST|t}} when full, were filled at two massive concrete plants on the Nevada side, and were delivered to the site in special [[Railroad car|railcars]]. The buckets were then suspended from aerial [[cableway]]s which were used to deliver the bucket to a specific column. As the required grade of [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] in the concrete differed depending on placement in the dam (from pea-sized gravel to 9-inch or 23&nbsp;cm stones), it was vital that the bucket be maneuvered to the proper column. When the bottom of the bucket opened up, disgorging {{convert|abbr=on|8|cuyd}} of concrete, a team of men worked it throughout the form. Although there are myths that men were caught in the pour and are entombed in the dam to this day, each bucket deepened the concrete in a form by only an inch, and Six Companies engineers would not have permitted a flaw caused by the presence of a human body.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=327\u2013330}}\n\nA total of {{convert|3250000|cuyd|abbr=off}} of concrete was used in the dam before concrete pouring ceased on May 29, 1935. In addition, {{convert|abbr=on|1,110,000|cuyd}} were used in the power plant and other works. More than {{convert|582|mi}} of cooling pipes were placed within the concrete. Overall, there is enough concrete in the dam to pave a two-lane highway from San Francisco to New York.<ref name=\"usbrfaq\" /> Concrete cores were removed from the dam for testing in 1995; they showed that \"Hoover Dam's concrete has continued to slowly gain strength\" and the dam is composed of a \"durable concrete having a compressive strength exceeding the range typically found in normal mass concrete\".{{sfn|Bartojay|Joy|2010}} Hoover Dam concrete is not subject to [[alkali\u2013silica reaction]] (ASR), as the Hoover Dam builders happened to use nonreactive aggregate, unlike that at downstream [[Parker Dam]], where ASR has caused measurable deterioration.{{sfn|Bartojay|Joy|2010}}\n\n=== Dedication and completion ===\n\n[[File:Damupstream.jpg|thumb|left|The upstream face of Hoover Dam slowly disappears as Lake Mead fills, May 1935 ''(looking downstream from the Arizona rim)'']]\n\nWith most work finished on the dam itself (the powerhouse remained uncompleted), a formal dedication ceremony was arranged for September 30, 1935, to coincide with a western tour being made by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. The morning of the dedication, it was moved forward three hours from 2&nbsp;p.m. Pacific time to 11&nbsp;a.m.; this was done because [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Harold L. Ickes]] had reserved a radio slot for the President for 2&nbsp;p.m. but officials did not realize until the day of the ceremony that the slot was for 2&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=366\u2013369}} Despite the change in the ceremony time, and temperatures of {{convert|abbr=on|102|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, 10,000&nbsp;people were present for the President's speech, in which he avoided mentioning the name of former President Hoover,{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=373}} who was not invited to the ceremony.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=304}} To mark the occasion, a three-cent stamp was issued by the [[United States Post Office Department]]\u2014bearing the name \"Boulder Dam\", the official name of the dam between 1933 and 1947.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=372}} After the ceremony, Roosevelt made the first visit by any American president to Las Vegas.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=373}}\n\nMost work had been completed by the dedication, and Six Companies negotiated with the government through late 1935 and early 1936 to settle all claims and arrange for the formal transfer of the dam to the Federal Government. The parties came to an agreement and on March 1, 1936, Secretary Ickes formally accepted the dam on behalf of the government. Six Companies was not required to complete work on one item, a concrete plug for one of the bypass tunnels, as the tunnel had to be used to take in irrigation water until the powerhouse went into operation.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=250\u2013252}}\n\n=== Construction deaths ===\n[[File:HansenHooverMemorial.jpg|thumb|[[Oskar J.

Workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning (brought on by the use of gasoline-fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels), and a classification used by Six Companies to avoid paying compensation claims.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=284\u2013286}} The site's diversion tunnels frequently reached {{convert|abbr=on|140|F|C}}, enveloped in thick plumes of vehicle exhaust gases.<ref name=\"I&amp;T-2010.V25.2\" /> A total of 42&nbsp;workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia and were not included in the above total; none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning. No deaths of non-workers from pneumonia were recorded in Boulder City during the construction period.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=284\u2013286}}\n\n=== Architectural style ===\n\nThe initial plans for the facade of the dam, the power plant, the outlet tunnels and ornaments clashed with the modern look of an arch dam. The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with the dam's functionality, adorned it with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]-inspired [[baluster|balustrade]] and eagle statues. This initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale, so Los Angeles-based architect [[Gordon Kaufmann|Gordon B. Kaufmann]], then the supervising architect to the Bureau of Reclamation, was brought in to redesign the exteriors.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|p=341}} Kaufmann greatly streamlined the design and applied an elegant [[Art Deco]] style to the entire project. He designed sculptured turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in Nevada and Arizona&nbsp;\u2014 both states are in different time zones, but since Arizona does not observe [[Daylight Saving Time]], the clocks display the same time for more than half the year.<ref name=\"Rhinehart 2004\" />\n\n[[File:HooverDamTrueDesign.jpg|thumb|right|Tile floor designed by [[Allen Tupper True]]]]\n[[File:HansenBasReliefHooverDam.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hansen's bas-relief on the Nevada elevator]]\nAt Kaufmann's request, Denver artist [[Allen Tupper True]]{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|p=341}} was hired to handle the design and decoration of the walls and floors of the new dam. True's design scheme incorporated motifs of the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Pueblo]] tribes of the region.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|pp=342\u2013343}} Although some initially were opposed to these designs, True was given the go-ahead and was officially appointed consulting artist.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|p=346}} With the assistance of the National Laboratory of Anthropology, True researched authentic decorative motifs from Indian sand paintings, textiles, baskets and ceramics.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|p=343}} The images and colors are based on Native American visions of rain, lightning, water, clouds, and local animals&nbsp;\u2014 lizards, serpents, birds&nbsp;\u2014 and on the Southwestern landscape of stepped mesas.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|pp=342\u2013343}} In these works, which are integrated into the walkways and interior halls of the dam, True also reflected on the machinery of the operation, making the symbolic patterns appear both ancient and modern.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|p=358}}\n\nWith the agreement of Kaufmann and the engineers, True also devised for the pipes and machinery an innovative color-coding which was implemented throughout all BOR projects.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|pp=354\u2013356}} True's consulting artist job lasted through 1942; it was extended so he could complete design work for the [[Parker Dam|Parker]], [[Shasta Dam|Shasta]] and [[Grand Coulee Dam|Grand Coulee]] dams and power plants. True's work on the Hoover Dam was humorously referred to in a poem published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', part of which read, \"lose the spark, and justify the dream; but also worthy of remark will be the color scheme\".{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|pp=361\u2013362}}\n\nComplementing Kaufmann and True's work, the Norwegian-born, naturalized American sculptor [[Oskar J.W. Hansen]] designed many of the sculptures on and around the dam. His works include the monument of dedication plaza, a plaque to memorialize the workers killed and the [[Relief|bas-reliefs]] on the elevator towers. In his words, Hansen wanted his work to express \"the immutable calm of intellectual resolution, and the enormous power of trained physical strength, equally enthroned in placid triumph of scientific accomplishment\", because \"[t]he building of Hoover Dam belongs to the sagas of the daring.\"<ref name=\"USBR, Hover Artwork\" /> Hansen's dedication plaza, on the Nevada abutment, contains a sculpture of two winged figures flanking a flagpole.\n\n[[File:Hoover Dam star map floor center.jpg|thumb|Hoover Dam memorial star map floor, center area]]\nSurrounding the base of the monument is a [[terrazzo]] floor embedded with a \"star map\". The map depicts the Northern Hemisphere sky at the moment of President Roosevelt's dedication of the dam. This is intended to help future astronomers, if necessary, calculate the exact date of dedication.<ref name=\"USBR, Hover Artwork\" />{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=379\u2013380}} The {{convert|30|ft |m|adj=mid|-high}} bronze figures, dubbed \"Winged Figures of the Republic\", were each formed in a continuous pour. To put such large bronzes into place without marring the highly polished bronze surface, they were placed on ice and guided into position as the ice melted.{{sfn|Bureau of Reclamation|2006|p=43}} Hansen's bas-relief on the Nevada elevator tower depicts the benefits of the dam: flood control, navigation, irrigation, water storage, and power. The bas-relief on the Arizona elevator depicts, in his words, \"the visages of those Indian tribes who have inhabited mountains and plains from ages distant.\"<ref name=\"USBR, Hover Artwork\" />\n\n== Operation ==\n=== Power plant and water demands ===<!-- Section is linked -->\n[[File:HooverDamFrontWater.jpg|thumb|Hoover Dam releasing water from the jet-flow gates in 1998]]\nExcavation for the powerhouse was carried out simultaneously with the excavation for the dam foundation and abutments. The excavation of this U-shaped structure located at the downstream toe of the dam was completed in late 1933 with the first concrete placed in November 1933. Filling of Lake Mead began February 1, 1935, even before the last of the concrete was poured that May.<ref name=\"USBR, Chronology\" /> The powerhouse was one of the projects uncompleted at the time of the formal dedication on September 30, 1935; a crew of 500&nbsp;men remained to finish it and other structures.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=248}} To make the powerhouse roof bombproof, it was constructed of layers of concrete, rock, and steel with a total thickness of about {{convert|3.5|ft}}, topped with layers of sand and tar.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|pp=280\u2013281}}\n\nIn the latter half of 1936, water levels in Lake Mead were high enough to permit power generation, and the first three [[Allis Chalmers]] built [[Francis turbine]]-[[electric generator|generators]], all on the Nevada side, began operating. In March 1937, one more Nevada generator went online and the first Arizona generator by August. By September 1939, four more generators were operating, and the dam's power plant became the largest hydroelectricity facility in the world. The final generator was not placed in service until 1961, bringing the maximum generating capacity to 1,345 megawatts at the time.<ref name=\"USBR, Chronology\" /><ref name=\"A2Z Las Vegas, Hoover\" /> Original plans called for 16&nbsp;large generators, eight on each side of the river, but two smaller generators were installed instead of one large one on the Arizona side for a total of 17. The smaller generators were used to serve smaller communities at a time when the output of each generator was dedicated to a single municipality, before the dam's total power output was placed on the grid and made arbitrarily distributable.<ref name=\"powerfaq\" /> \n\nBefore water from Lake Mead reaches the turbines, it enters the intake towers and then four gradually narrowing [[penstock]]s which funnel the water down towards the powerhouse. The intakes provide a maximum [[hydraulic head]] (water pressure) of {{convert|abbr=on|590|ft|m}} as the water reaches a speed of about {{convert|abbr=on|85|mph |km/h|-1}}. The entire flow of the Colorado River passes through the turbines. The spillways and [[outlet works]] (jet-flow gates) are rarely used.<ref name=\"powerfaq\" /> The jet-flow gates, located in concrete structures {{convert|180|ft}} above the river and also at the outlets of the inner diversion tunnels at river level, may be used to divert water around the dam in emergency or flood conditions, but have never done so, and in practice are used only to drain water from the penstocks for maintenance.{{sfn|Bureau of Reclamation|2006|p=40}} Following an [[Grid energy storage#Hydroelectric dam uprating|uprating]] project from 1986 to 1993, the total gross power rating for the plant, including two 2.4 [[Watt#Megawatt|megawatt]] [[Pelton turbine]]-generators that power Hoover Dam's own operations is a maximum capacity of 2080 megawatts.<ref name=\"powerfaq\" /> The annual generation of Hoover Dam varies.

The spillway entrances are located behind each dam [[Abutment#Miscellanea|abutment]], running roughly parallel to the canyon walls. The spillway entrance arrangement forms a classic side-flow [[weir]] with each spillway containing four {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} steel-drum gates. Each gate weighs {{convert|5,000,000|lb|abbr=off}} and can be operated manually or automatically. Gates are raised and lowered depending on water levels in the reservoir and flood conditions. The gates could not entirely prevent water from entering the spillways but could maintain an extra {{convert|abbr=on|16|ft}} of lake level.<ref name=\"recspi\" />\nWater flowing over the spillways falls dramatically into {{convert|600|ft|m |adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|50|ft|m |adj=mid|-wide}} spillway tunnels before connecting to the outer diversion tunnels, and reentering the main river channel below the dam. This complex spillway entrance arrangement combined with the approximate {{convert|700|ft|adj=on}} elevation drop from the top of the reservoir to the river below was a difficult engineering problem and posed numerous design challenges. Each spillway's capacity of {{convert|abbr=on|200,000|ft3/s |m3/s}} was empirically verified in post-construction tests in 1941.<ref name=\"recspi\" />\n\nThe large spillway tunnels have only been used twice, for testing in 1941 and because of flooding in 1983. Both times, when inspecting the tunnels after the spillways were used, engineers found major damage to the concrete linings and underlying rock.{{sfn|Fiedler|2010}} The 1941 damage was attributed to a slight misalignment of the tunnel invert (or base), which caused [[cavitation]], a phenomenon in fast-flowing liquids in which vapor bubbles collapse with explosive force. In response to this finding, the tunnels were patched with special heavy-duty concrete and the surface of the concrete was polished mirror-smooth.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=391\u2013392}} The spillways were modified in 1947 by adding flip buckets, which both slow the water and decrease the spillway's effective capacity, in an attempt to eliminate conditions thought to have contributed to the 1941 damage. The 1983 damage, also due to cavitation, led to the installation of aerators in the spillways.{{sfn|Fiedler|2010}} Tests at [[Grand Coulee Dam]] showed that the technique worked, in principle.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=391\u2013392}}\n\n=== Roadway and tourism ===\n{{See also|Hoover Dam in popular culture}}\n[[File:Hoover Dam, Colorado River.JPG|thumb|The bypass in front of the dam]]\n[[File:Mike O'Callaghan\u2013Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge view from Hoover Dam.jpeg|thumb|Mike O'Callaghan\u2013Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge as visible from the Hoover Dam]]\nThere are two lanes for automobile traffic across the top of the dam, which formerly served as the Colorado River crossing for [[U.S. Route 93]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/20101017hoover-dam-bypass-bridge-opening.html |title=Hoover Dam Bypass an American Triumph |author=Sean Holstege |date=October 17, 2010 |website=azcentral.com }}</ref> In the wake of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], authorities expressed security concerns and the [[Hoover Dam Bypass]] project was expedited.

Commonly named among the [[Great American Novel]]s, the work is among the first in major [[American literature]] to be written throughout in [[vernacular]] English, characterized by [[American literary regionalism|local color regionalism]]. It is told in the [[first-person narrative|first person]] by [[Huckleberry Finn (character)|Huckleberry \"Huck\" Finn]], the narrator of two other Twain novels (''[[Tom Sawyer Abroad]]'' and ''[[Tom Sawyer, Detective]]'') and a friend of [[Tom Sawyer]]. It is a direct sequel to ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]''.\n\nThe book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the [[Mississippi River]]. Set in a [[southern United States|Southern]] [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] society that had ceased to exist about 20 years before the work was published, ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' is an often scathing [[satire]] on entrenched attitudes, particularly racism.\n\nPerennially popular with readers, ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' has also been the continued object of study by literary critics since its publication. The book was widely criticized upon release because of its extensive use of coarse language.

Kemble]] in the original 1884 edition of the book]]\n\n=== In Missouri ===\nThe story begins in fictional St. Petersburg, Missouri (based on the actual town of [[Hannibal, Missouri]]), on the shore of the [[Mississippi River]] \"forty to fifty years ago\" (the novel having been published in 1884).  Huckleberry \"Huck\" Finn (the [[protagonist]] and [[first-person narrator]]) and his friend, Thomas \"Tom\" Sawyer, have each come into a considerable sum of money as a result of their earlier adventures (detailed in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]''). Huck explains how he is placed under the [[guardianship]] of the Widow Douglas, who, together with her stringent sister, Miss Watson, are attempting to \"sivilize\" him and teach him religion. Finding civilized life confining, his spirits are raised somewhat when Tom Sawyer helps him to escape one night past Miss Watson's slave [[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]], to meet up with Tom's gang of self-proclaimed \"robbers.\" Just as the gang's activities begin to bore Huck, he is suddenly interrupted by the reappearance of his shiftless father, \"Pap\", an abusive [[alcoholic]]. Knowing that Pap would only spend the money on alcohol, Huck is successful in preventing Pap from acquiring his fortune; however, Pap kidnaps Huck and leaves town with him.\n\n=== In Illinois and on Jackson's Island ===\nPap forcibly moves Huck to his isolated cabin in the woods along the [[Illinois]] shoreline. Because of Pap's drunken violence and imprisonment of Huck inside the cabin, Huck, during one of his father's absences, elaborately fakes his own death, escapes from the cabin, and sets off downriver. He settles comfortably, on Jackson's Island. Here, Huck reunites with Jim, Miss Watson's slave. Jim has also run away after he overheard Miss Watson planning to sell him \"down the river\" to presumably more brutal owners. Jim plans to make his way to the town of [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]] in Illinois, a [[slave states and free states|free state]], so that he can later buy the rest of his enslaved family's freedom. At first, Huck is conflicted about the sin and crime of supporting a runaway slave, but as the two talk in depth and bond over their mutually held superstitions, Huck emotionally connects with Jim, who increasingly becomes Huck's close friend and guardian. After heavy flooding on the river, the two find a [[Timber rafting|raft]] (which they keep) as well as an entire house floating on the river (Chapter 9: \"The House of Death Floats By\"). Entering the house to seek loot, Jim finds the naked body of a dead man lying on the floor, shot in the back. He prevents Huck from viewing the corpse.<ref>Ira Fistell ''Ira Fistell\u2019S Mark Twain:: Three Encounters'' 1469178729\n 2012  Page 94 \"..Huck and Jim's first adventure together\u2014the House of Death incident which occupies Chapter 9. This sequence seems to me to be quite important both to the technical functioning of the plot and to the larger meaning of the novel. The House of Death is a two\u2014story frame building which comes floating downstream, one paragraph after Huck and jim catch their soon\u2014to\u2014be famous raft. While Twain never explicitly says so, his description of the house and its contents ...\"</ref>\n\nTo find out the latest news in town, Huck dresses as a girl and enters the house of Judith Loftus, a woman new to the area. Huck learns from her about the news of his own supposed murder; Pap was initially blamed, but since Jim ran away he is also a suspect and a reward for Jim's capture has initiated a manhunt. Mrs. Loftus becomes increasingly suspicious that Huck is a boy, finally proving it by a series of tests. Huck develops another story on the fly and explains his disguise as the only way to escape from an abusive foster family. Once he is exposed, she nevertheless allows him to leave her home without commotion, not realizing that he is the allegedly murdered boy they have just been discussing. Huck returns to Jim to tell him the news and that a search party is coming to Jackson's Island that very night. The two hastily load up the raft and depart.\n\nAfter a while, Huck and Jim come across a grounded [[steamship]]. Searching it, they stumble upon two thieves discussing murdering a third, but they flee before being noticed. They are later separated in a fog, making Jim intensely anxious, and when they reunite, Huck tricks Jim into thinking he dreamed the entire incident. Jim is not deceived for long, and is deeply hurt that his friend should have teased him so mercilessly. Huck becomes remorseful and apologizes to Jim, though his conscience troubles him about humbling himself to a black man.\n\n=== In Kentucky: the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons ===\nTraveling onward, Huck and Jim's raft is struck by a passing steamship, again separating the two. Huck is given shelter on the [[Kentucky]] side of the river by the Grangerfords, an \"aristocratic\" family. He befriends Buck Grangerford, a boy about his age, and learns that the Grangerfords are engaged in a 30-year [[blood feud]] against another family, the Shepherdsons. The Grangerfords and Shepherdsons go to the same church, which ironically preaches brotherly love. The vendetta finally comes to a head when Buck's older sister [[elope]]s with a member of the Shepherdson clan. In the resulting conflict, all the Grangerford males from this branch of the family are shot and killed, including Buck, whose horrific murder Huck witnesses. He is immensely relieved to be reunited with Jim, who has since recovered and repaired the raft.\n\n=== In Arkansas: the Duke and the King ===\nNear the Arkansas-Missouri-Tennessee border, Jim and Huck take two on-the-run [[Confidence trick|grifters]] aboard the raft. The younger man, who is about thirty, introduces himself as the long-lost son of an English [[duke]] (the [[Duke of Bridgewater]]). The older one, about seventy, then trumps this outrageous claim by alleging that he himself is the [[Louis XVII of France#Lost Dauphin claimants|Lost Dauphin]], the son of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and rightful King of France. The \"duke\" and \"king\" soon become permanent passengers on Jim and Huck's raft, committing a series of [[confidence tricks|confidence schemes]] upon unsuspecting locals all along their journey. To divert suspicions from the public away from Jim, they pose him as recaptured slave runaway, but later paint him up entirely blue and call him the \"Sick Arab\" so that he can move about the raft without bindings.\n\nOn one occasion, the swindlers advertise a three-night engagement of a play called \"The Royal Nonesuch\". The play turns out to be only a couple of minutes' worth of an absurd, bawdy sham. On the afternoon of the first performance, a drunk called Boggs is shot dead by a gentleman named Colonel Sherburn; a lynch mob forms to retaliate against Sherburn; and Sherburn, surrounded at his home, disperses the mob by making a defiant speech describing how true lynching should be done. By the third night of \"The Royal Nonesuch\", the townspeople prepare for their revenge on the duke and king for their money-making scam, but the two cleverly skip town together with Huck and Jim just before the performance begins.\n\nIn the next town, the two swindlers then impersonate brothers of Peter Wilks, a recently deceased man of property. To match accounts of Wilks's brothers, the king attempts an [[British English|English accent]] and the duke pretends to be a [[deaf-mute]] while starting to collect Wilks's inheritance. Huck decides that Wilks's three orphaned nieces, who treat Huck with kindness, do not deserve to be cheated thus and so he tries to retrieve for them the stolen inheritance. In a desperate moment, Huck is forced to hide the money in Wilks's coffin, which is abruptly buried the next morning. The arrival of two new men who seem to be the real brothers throws everything into confusion, so that the townspeople decide to dig up the coffin in order to determine which are the true brothers, but, with everyone else distracted, Huck leaves for the raft, hoping to never see the duke and king again. Suddenly, though, the two villains return, much to Huck's despair. When Huck is finally able to get away a second time, he finds to his horror that the swindlers have sold Jim away to a family that intends to return him to his proper owner for the reward. Defying his conscience and accepting the negative religious consequences he expects for his actions\u2014\"All right, then, I'll go to hell!\"\u2014Huck resolves to free Jim once and for all.\n\n=== On the Phelps' farm ===\nHuck learns that Jim is being held at the plantation of [[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Sally and Silas Phelps|Silas and Sally Phelps]]. The family's nephew, Tom, is expected for a visit at the same time as Huck's arrival, so Huck is mistaken for Tom and welcomed into their home. He plays along, hoping to find Jim's location and free him; in a surprising [[plot twist]], it is revealed that the expected nephew is, in fact, Tom Sawyer. When Huck intercepts the real Tom Sawyer on the road and tells him everything, Tom decides to join Huck's scheme, pretending to be his own younger half-brother, [[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Sid Sawyer|Sid]], while Huck continues pretending to be Tom. In the meantime, Jim has told the family about the two grifters and the new plan for \"The Royal Nonesuch\", and so the townspeople capture the duke and king, who are then [[Tarring and feathering|tarred and feathered]] and [[Riding a rail|ridden out of town on a rail]].\n\nRather than simply sneaking Jim out of the shed where he is being held, Tom develops an elaborate plan to free him, involving secret messages, a hidden tunnel, snakes in a shed, a rope ladder sent in Jim's food, and other elements from adventure books he has read,<ref name=\"Doyno\">{{cite book|title=Writing Huck Finn: Mark Twain's creative process|author=Victor A. Doyno|year=1991|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|page=191|url= https://books.google.com/?id=b-DTQwA4lDEC&pg=PA190&lpg=PA190&dq=benvenuto+chelleeny|isbn=9780812214482}}</ref> including an anonymous note to the Phelps warning them of the whole scheme. During the actual escape and resulting pursuit, Tom is shot in the leg, while Jim remains by his side, risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone. Although a local doctor admires Jim's decency, he has Jim arrested in his sleep and returned to the Phelps. After this, events quickly resolve themselves. Tom's [[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Aunt Polly|Aunt Polly]] arrives and reveals Huck and Tom's true identities to the Phelps family. Jim is revealed to be a free man: [[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Mrs. Watson|Miss Watson]] died two months earlier and freed Jim in her will, but Tom (who already knew this) chose not to reveal this information to Huck so that he could come up with an artful rescue plan for Jim. Jim tells Huck that Huck's father ([[List of Tom Sawyer characters#Pap Finn|Pap Finn]]) has been dead for some time (he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house), and so Huck may now return safely to St. Petersburg. Huck declares that he is quite glad to be done writing his story, and despite Sally's plans to adopt and civilize him, he intends to flee west to [[Indian Territory]].\n\n== Major themes ==\n''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' explores themes of race and identity. A complexity exists concerning Jim's character. While some scholars point out that Jim is good-hearted, moral, and he is not unintelligent (in contrast to several of the more negatively depicted white characters), others have criticized the novel as racist, citing the use of the word \"[[nigger]]\" and emphasizing the stereotypically \"comic\" treatment of Jim's lack of education, superstition and ignorance.<ref>[http://wiki.uiowa.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=38342425 2.

James S. Leonard, Thomas A. Tenney, and Thadious M. Davis (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1992).</ref>\n\nThroughout the story, Huck is in moral conflict with the received values of the society in which he lives, and while he is unable to consciously refute those values even in his thoughts, he makes a moral choice based on his own valuation of Jim's friendship and Jim's human worth, a decision in direct opposition to the things he has been taught. Mark Twain, in his lecture notes, proposes that \"a sound heart is a surer guide than an ill-trained conscience\" and goes on to describe the novel as \"...a book of mine where a sound heart and a deformed conscience come into collision and conscience suffers defeat\".<ref>Mark Twain (1895). ''Notebook No. 35''. Typescript, P. 35. Mark Twain Papers. Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley.</ref>\n\nTo highlight the hypocrisy required to condone slavery within an ostensibly moral system, Twain has Huck's father enslave his son, isolate him, and beat him. When Huck escapes, he then immediately encounters Jim \"illegally\" doing the same thing. The treatments both of them receive are radically different, especially with an encounter with Mrs. Judith Loftus who takes pity on who she presumes to be a runaway apprentice, Huck, yet boasts about her husband sending the hounds after a runaway slave, Jim.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 438790|last1 = Foley|first1 = Barbara|title = Reviewed work: Satire or Evasion?

John Alberti quotes [[Shelley Fisher Fishkin]], who writes in her 1990s book ''Was Huck Black?: Mark Twain and African-American Voices'', \"by limiting their field of inquiry to the periphery,\" white scholars \"have missed the ways in which African-American voices shaped Twain's creative imagination at its core.\" It is suggested that the character of Huckleberry Finn illustrates the correlation, and even interrelatedness, between white and black culture in the United States.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{Cite journal |jstor = 378621|title = The Nigger Huck: Race, Identity, and the Teaching of Huckleberry Finn|journal = College English|volume = 57|issue = 8|pages = 919\u2013937|last1 = Alberti|first1 = John|year = 1995}}</ref>\n\n== Illustrations ==\nThe original illustrations were done by [[E.W.

When the novel was published, the illustrations were praised even as the novel was harshly criticized. E.W. Kemble produced another set of illustrations for Harper's and the American Publishing Company in 1898 and 1899 after Twain lost the copyright.<ref name=cope_uvlib>{{cite web|last=Cope |first=Virginia H. |title=Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn: Text, Illustrations, and Early Reviews |url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/twain/huckfinn.html |publisher=University of Virginia Library |accessdate=17 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117125823/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/twain/huckfinn.html |archivedate=January 17, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n== Publication's effect on literary climate ==\n[[File:Mark twain2.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Mark Twain]]]]\n\nTwain initially conceived of the work as a sequel to ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' that would follow Huckleberry Finn through adulthood. Beginning with a few pages he had removed from the earlier novel, Twain began work on a manuscript he originally titled ''Huckleberry Finn's Autobiography.'' Twain worked on the manuscript off and on for the next several years, ultimately abandoning his original plan of following Huck's development into adulthood. He appeared to have lost interest in the manuscript while it was in progress, and set it aside for several years. After making a trip down the [[Hudson River]], Twain returned to his work on the novel. Upon completion, the novel's title closely paralleled its predecessor's: ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer's Comrade)''.<ref>Mark Twain and Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Huckleberry Finn: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' (New York: Clarkson N. Potter, 1981).</ref>\n\nMark Twain composed the story in pen on notepaper between 1876 and 1883. Paul Needham, who supervised the authentication of the manuscript for [[Sotheby's]] books and manuscripts department in New York in 1991, stated, \"What you see is [Clemens'] attempt to move away from pure literary writing to dialect writing\". For example, Twain revised the opening line of ''Huck Finn'' three times. He initially wrote, \"You will not know about me\", which he changed to, \"You do not know about me\", before settling on the final version, \"You don't know about me, without you have read a book by the name of 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'; but that ain't no matter.\"<ref>Philip Young, ''Ernest Hemingway: A Reconsideration'', (University Park: Pennsylvania State UP, 1966), 212.</ref> The revisions also show how Twain reworked his material to strengthen the characters of Huck and Jim, as well as his sensitivity to the then-current debate over literacy and voting.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4613362|last1 = Baker|first1 = William|title = Reviewed work: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain|journal = The Antioch Review|volume = 54|issue = 3|pages = 363\u2013364|year = 1996}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/14/books/first-half-of-huck-finn-in-twain-s-hand-is-found.html Rita Reif, \"First Half of 'Huck Finn,' in Twain's Hand, Is Found,\" ''The New York Times'', last modified February 17, 1991, accessed April 12, 2012]</ref>\n\nA later version was the first typewritten manuscript delivered to a printer.<ref>William Baker, \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain\"</ref>\n\nDemand for the book spread outside of the United States.

Twain did so. Later it was believed that half of the pages had been misplaced by the printer. In 1991, the missing first half turned up in a steamer trunk owned by descendants of Gluck's. The library successfully claimed possession and, in 1994, opened the Mark Twain Room to showcase the treasure.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/17/books/antiques-how-huck-finn-was-rescued.html Rita Reif, \"ANTIQUES; How 'Huck Finn' Was Rescued,\" ''The New York Times'', last modified March 17, 1991, accessed April 12, 2012]</ref>\n\nIn relation to the literary climate at the time of the book's publication in 1885, Henry Nash Smith describes the importance of Mark Twain's already established reputation as a \"professional humorist\", having already published over a dozen other works. Smith suggests that while the \"dismantling of the decadent Romanticism of the later nineteenth century was a necessary operation,\" ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' illustrated \"previously inaccessible resources of imaginative power, but also made vernacular language, with its new sources of pleasure and new energy, available for American prose and poetry in the twentieth century.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3823856|title = The Publication of \"Huckleberry Finn\": A Centennial Retrospect|journal = Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|volume = 37|issue = 5|pages = 18\u201340|last1 = Smith|first1 = Henry Nash|last2 = Finn|first2 = Huckleberry|year = 1984}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:Jim and ghost huck finn.jpg|thumb|In this scene illustrated by [[E.

During Twain's time, and today, defenders of ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' \"lump all nonacademic critics of the book together as extremists and \u2018censors' thus equating the complaints about the book's \u2018coarseness' from the genteel bourgeois trustees of the [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord Public Library]] in the 1880s with more recent objections based on race and civil rights.\"<ref name=\"jstor.org\" />\n\nUpon issue of the American edition in 1885 several libraries banned it from their shelves.<ref name=\"leonard-concord\">{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=James S.|author2=Thomas A.

One incident was recounted in the newspaper the ''Boston Transcript'':\n<blockquote>\nThe Concord (Mass.) Public Library committee has decided to exclude Mark Twain's latest book from the library. One member of the committee says that, while he does not wish to call it immoral, he thinks it contains but little humor, and that of a very coarse type. He regards it as the veriest trash. The library and the other members of the committee entertain similar views, characterizing it as rough, coarse, and inelegant, dealing with a series of experiences not elevating, the whole book being more suited to the slums than to intelligent, respectable people.<ref>Shelley Fisher Fishkin, \"Was Huck Black?: Mark Twain and African-American Voices\" (New York: Oxford UP, 1993) 115.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWriter [[Louisa May Alcott]] criticized the book's publication as well, saying that if Twain \"[could not] think of something better to tell our pure-minded lads and lasses he had best stop writing for them\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1984/4/1984_4_81.shtml|title=One Hundred Years of Huck Finn|accessdate=November 8, 2010|last=Brown|first=Robert|work=American Heritage Magazine|publisher=AmericanHeritage.com|quote=If Mr. Clemens cannot think of something better to tell our pure-minded lads and lasses he had best stop writing for them.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119084212/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1984/4/1984_4_81.shtml|archivedate=January 19, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/one-hundred-years-huck-finn|title=One Hundred Years Of Huck Finn \u2013 AMERICAN HERITAGE|website=www.americanheritage.com}}</ref>\n\nTwain later remarked to his editor, \"Apparently, the Concord library has condemned Huck as 'trash and only suitable for the slums.' This will sell us another twenty-five thousand copies for sure!\"\n\nIn 1905, New York's [[Brooklyn Public Library]] also banned the book due to \"bad word choice\" and Huck's having \"not only itched but scratched\" within the novel, which was considered obscene. When asked by a Brooklyn librarian about the situation, Twain sardonically replied: <blockquote>I am greatly troubled by what you say. I wrote 'Tom Sawyer' & 'Huck Finn' for adults exclusively, & it always distressed me when I find that boys and girls have been allowed access to them. The mind that becomes soiled in youth can never again be washed clean. I know this by my own experience, & to this day I cherish an unappeased bitterness against the unfaithful guardians of my young life, who not only permitted but compelled me to read an unexpurgated Bible through before I was 15 years old.

However, Hearn continues by explaining that \"the reticent Howells found nothing in the proofs of Huckleberry Finn so offensive that it needed to be struck out\".<ref>Mark Twain and Michael Patrick Hearn, 8.</ref>\n\nMuch of modern scholarship of ''Huckleberry Finn'' has focused on its treatment of race. Many Twain scholars have argued that the book, by humanizing Jim and exposing the fallacies of the racist assumptions of slavery, is an attack on racism.<ref>For example, Shelley Fisher Fishin, ''Lighting out for the Territory: Reflections on Mark Twain and American Culture'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997).</ref> Others have argued that the book falls short on this score, especially in its depiction of Jim.<ref name=\"leonard-concord\" /> According to Professor Stephen Railton of the [[University of Virginia]], Twain was unable to fully rise above the stereotypes of black people that white readers of his era expected and enjoyed, and, therefore, resorted to [[minstrel show]]-style comedy to provide humor at Jim's expense, and ended up confirming rather than challenging late-19th century racist stereotypes.<ref>[http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1987/summer/railton-jim-mark/ Stephen Railton, \"Jim and Mark Twain: What Do Dey Stan' For?,\" ''The Virginia Quarterly Review'', last modified 1987, accessed April 12, 2012]</ref>\n\nIn one instance, the controversy caused a drastically altered interpretation of the text: in 1955, [[CBS]] tried to avoid controversial material in a televised version of the book, by deleting all mention of slavery and omitting the character of Jim entirely.<ref>Alex Sharp, \"Student Edition of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer Is Censored by Editor\"</ref>\n\nBecause of this controversy over whether ''Huckleberry Finn'' is racist or anti-racist, and because the word \"[[nigger]]\"  is frequently used in the novel (a commonly used word in Twain's time which has since become vulgar and [[taboo]]), many have questioned the appropriateness of teaching the book in the U.S. public school system\u2014this questioning of the word \"nigger\" is illustrated by a school administrator of Virginia in 1982 calling the novel the \"most grotesque example of racism I've ever seen in my life\".<ref>Robert B.

In 2003, high school student Calista Phair and her grandmother, Beatrice Clark, in [[Renton, Washington|Renton]], Washington, proposed banning the book from classroom learning in the Renton School District, though not from any public libraries, because of the word \"nigger\". Clark filed a request with the school district in response to the required reading of the book, asking for the novel to be removed from the English curriculum. The two curriculum committees that considered her request eventually decided to keep the novel on the 11th grade curriculum, though they suspended it until a panel had time to review the novel and set a specific teaching procedure for the novel's controversial topics.<ref>[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Huck-Finn-a-masterpiece-or-an-insult-1130707.php Gregory Roberts, \"'Huck Finn' a Masterpiece -- or an Insult,\" ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', last modified November 25, 2003, accessed April 12, 2012]</ref>\n\nIn 2009, a Washington state high school teacher called for the removal of the novel from a school curriculum.

The harpsichord was widely used in [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music]]. During the late 18th century, with the rise of the [[piano]], it gradually disappeared from the musical scene. In the 20th century, it made a resurgence, being used in [[historically informed performance]]s of older music, in new compositions, and in certain styles of popular music.\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[File:MDMB 418, detall de clavic\u00e8mbal, Christian Zell, Museu de la M\u00fasica de Barcelona.jpg|thumb|Detail of the mechanism of the Harpsichord by Christian Zell, at [[Museu de la M\u00fasica de Barcelona]]]]\nHarpsichords vary in size and shape, but all have the same basic mechanism. The player depresses a key that rocks over a pivot in the middle of its length. The other end of the key lifts a [[jack (organology)|jack]] (a long strip of wood) that holds a small [[plectrum]] (a wedge-shaped piece of [[quill]], often made of plastic today), which plucks the string. When the player releases the key, the far end returns to its rest position, and the jack falls back; the plectrum, mounted on a tongue that can swivel backwards away from the string, passes the string without plucking it again. As the key reaches its rest position, a felt damper atop the jack stops the string's vibrations. These basic principles are explained in detail below.\n\n[[File:HarpsichordMechanism-EN.svg|center|thumb|800px|Figure 1. Schematic view of a 2 \u00d7 8<nowiki>'</nowiki> single manual harpsichord]]\n* The ''keylever'' is a simple pivot, which rocks on a ''balance pin'' that passes through a hole drilled through the keylever.\n* The ''jack'' is a thin, rectangular piece of wood that sits upright on the end of the keylever. The jacks are held in place by the ''registers''. These are two long strips of wood (the upper movable, the lower fixed), which run in the gap between pinblock and bellyrail. The registers have rectangular mortises (holes) through which the jacks pass as they can move up and down. The registers hold the jacks in the precise location needed to pluck the string.<br />[[File:Jack diagram-EN.svg|center|thumb|300px|Figure 2. Upper part of a jack]]\n* In the jack, a ''[[plectrum]]'' juts out almost horizontally (normally the plectrum is angled upwards a tiny amount) and passes just under the string. Historically, plectra were made of bird quill or leather; many modern harpsichords have plastic ([[delrin]] or [[celcon]]) plectra.\n* When the front of the key is pressed, the back of the key rises, the jack is lifted, and the plectrum plucks the string.\n* The vertical motion of the jack is then stopped by the ''jackrail'' (also called the ''upper rail''), which is covered with soft felt to muffle the impact.<br />[[File:Harpsichord jack action.svg|center|thumb|700px|Figure 3: how the harpsichord action works]]\n* When the key is released, the jack falls back down under its own weight, and the plectrum passes back under the string. This is made possible by having the plectrum held in a tongue attached with a pivot and a spring to the body of the jack. The bottom surface of the plectrum is cut at a slant; thus when the descending plectrum touches the string from above, the angled lower surface provides enough force to push the tongue backward.<ref>Kottick (1987, 19)</ref>\n* When the jack arrives in fully lowered position, the felt damper touches the string, causing the note to cease.\n\n==Strings, tuning, and soundboard==\n[[File:Resonance Chladni Soundboard Harpsichord Clavecin.jpg|thumb|right|Sound board of a harpsichord with [[Chladni]] patterns]]\n[[File:035 Museu de la M\u00fasica.jpg|thumb|Detail of the harpsichord by Karl Conrad Fleischer; Hamburg, 1720 in [[Museu de la M\u00fasica de Barcelona]]. A decorative rose descends below the soundboard in which it is mounted; the soundboard itself is adorned with floral painting around the rose. The bridge is at lower right.]]\nEach string is wound around a ''tuning pin'', normally at the end of the string closer to the player. When rotated with a wrench or tuning hammer, the tuning pin adjusts the tension so that the string sounds the correct pitch. Tuning pins are held tightly in holes drilled in the ''pinblock'' or ''wrestplank'', an oblong hardwood plank. Proceeding from the tuning pin, a string next passes over the ''nut'', a sharp edge that is made of hardwood and is normally attached to the wrestplank. The section of the string beyond the nut forms its ''vibrating length'', which is plucked and creates sound.\n\nAt the other end of its vibrating length, the string passes over the [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]], another sharp edge made of hardwood. As with the nut, the horizontal position of the string along the bridge is determined by a vertical metal pin inserted into the bridge, against which the string rests. The bridge itself rests on a ''[[Sound board (music)|soundboard]]'', a thin panel of wood usually made of [[spruce]], [[fir]] or\u2014in some Italian harpsichords\u2014[[Cupressus sempervirens|cypress]]. The soundboard efficiently transduces the vibrations of the strings into vibrations in the air; without a soundboard, the strings would produce only a very feeble sound. A string is attached at its far end by a loop to a ''hitchpin'' that secures it to the case.\n\n==Multiple choirs of strings==\nWhile many harpsichords have one string per note, more elaborate harpsichords can have two or more strings for each note. When there are multiple strings for each note, these additional strings are called \"choirs\" of strings. This provides two advantages: the ability to vary volume and ability to vary tonal quality. Volume is increased when the mechanism of the instrument is set up by the player (see below) so that the press of a single key plucks more than one string. Tonal quality can be varied in two ways. First, different choirs of strings can be designed to have distinct tonal qualities, usually by having one set of strings plucked closer to the nut, which emphasizes the higher [[harmonic]]s, and produces a \"nasal\" sound quality. The mechanism of the instrument, called \"stops\" (following the use of the term in pipe organs) permits the player to select one choir or the other. Second, having one key pluck two strings at once changes not just volume but also tonal quality; for instance, when two strings tuned to the same pitch are plucked simultaneously, the note is not just louder but also richer and more complex.\n\nA particularly vivid effect is obtained when the strings plucked simultaneously are an [[octave]] apart. This is normally heard by the ear not as two pitches but as one: the sound of the higher string is blended with that of the lower one, and the ear hears the lower pitch, enriched in tonal quality by the additional strength in the upper harmonics of the note sounded by the higher string.\n\nWhen describing a harpsichord it is customary to specify its choirs of strings, often called its [[disposition (harpsichord)|disposition]]. Strings at [[eight foot pitch]] sound at the normal expected pitch, strings at four foot pitch sound an octave higher. Harpsichords occasionally include a sixteen-foot choir (one octave lower than eight-foot) or a two-foot choir (two octaves higher; quite rare). When there are multiple choirs of strings, the player is often able to control which choirs sound. This is usually done by having a set of jacks for each choir, and a mechanism for \"turning off\" each set, often by moving the upper register (through which the jacks slide) sideways a short distance, so that their plectra miss the strings. In simpler instruments this is done by manually moving the registers, but as the harpsichord evolved, builders invented levers, knee levers and pedal mechanisms to make it easier to change registration.\n\nHarpsichords with more than one keyboard (this usually means two keyboards, stacked one on top of the other in a step-wise fashion, as with pipe organs)<ref>In virtually all instances, \"more than one\" means two. For the one known three-manual instrument, see [[Hieronymus Albrecht Hass]]. For forged three-manual instruments, see [[Leopoldo Franciolini]].</ref> provide flexibility in selecting which strings play, since each manual can be set to control the plucking of a different set of strings. In addition, such harpsichords often have a mechanism (the \"coupler\") that couples manuals together, so that a single manual plays both sets of strings. The most flexible system is the French \"shove coupler\", in which the lower manual slides forward and backward. In the backward position, \"dogs\" attached to the upper surface of the lower manual engage the lower surface of the upper manual's keys. Depending on choice of keyboard and coupler position, the player can select any of the sets of jacks labeled in figure 4 as A, or B and C, or all three.\n\n[[File:Shove Coupler.svg|center|thumb|800px|Figure 4. French shove coupler. To the left: uncoupled keyboards. The depressed upper key lifts the jack A upwards. The depressed lower key lifts jacks B and C. To the right: The upper keyboard is coupled to the lower one by pulling the latter. The depressed upper key lifts the jack A upwards. The depressed lower key lifts jacks A, B and C.]]\n\nThe English \"dogleg\" jack system (also used in Baroque Flanders) does not require a coupler. The jacks labeled A in Figure 5 have a \"dogleg\" shape that permits either keyboard to play A. If the player wishes to play the upper 8' from the upper manual only and not from the lower manual, a stop handle disengages the jacks labeled A and engages instead an alternative row of jacks called \"lute stop\" (not shown in the Figure). A lute stop is used to imitate the gentle sound of a plucked [[lute]].<ref>Find full details in {{Harvnb|Hubbard|1967|p=133 ff.}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|1973|p=65 ff.}}, {{Harvnb|Kottick|2003}}.</ref>\n[[File:Dogleg shove coupler.svg|center|thumb|400px|Figure 5. Dogleg jack, English coupler system. When depressed, the upper key lifts the \"dogleg\" jack (jack A) upwards. The lower key lifts all three jacks A, B, and C.]] The use of multiple manuals in a harpsichord was not originally provided for the flexibility in choosing which strings would sound, but rather for [[transposition (music)|transposition]] of the instrument to play in different keys (see ''[[History of the harpsichord]]'').\n\n[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Lady Standing at a Virginal.jpg|thumb|[[Jan Vermeer]]'s famous painting ''[[Lady Standing at a Virginal]]'' shows a characteristic practice of his time, with the instrument mounted on a table and the player standing.]]\n\n==Case==\nThe case holds in position all of the important structural members: pinblock, soundboard, hitchpins, keyboard, and the jack action. It usually includes a solid bottom, and also internal bracing to maintain its form without warping under the tension of the strings. Cases vary greatly in weight and sturdiness: Italian harpsichords are often of light construction; heavier construction is found in the later Flemish instruments and those derived from them.\n\n[[File:FalseInnerOuterHarpsichord.jpg|thumb|left|A false inner\u2013outer harpsichord from the [[Deutsches Museum]] in [[Munich]]. The false inner case begins to the right of the keyboard, and continues backward only far enough to provide a slot to support the jack rail.]]\nThe case also gives the harpsichord its external appearance and protects the instrument. A large harpsichord is, in a sense, a piece of furniture, as it stands alone on legs and may be styled in the manner of other furniture of its place and period. Early Italian instruments, on the other hand, were so light in construction that they were treated rather like a violin: kept for storage in a protective outer case, and played after taking it out of its case and placing it on a table.<ref name=\"Hubbard19\">{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1967|p=19}}</ref> Such tables were often quite high \u2013 until the late 18th century people usually played standing up.<ref name=Hubbard19 /> Eventually, harpsichords came to be built with just a single case, though an intermediate stage also existed: the ''false inner\u2013outer'', which for purely aesthetic reasons was built to look as if the outer case contained an inner one, in the old style.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1967|p=20}}</ref> Even after harpsichords became self-encased objects, they often were supported by separate stands, and some modern harpsichords have separate legs for improved portability.\n\nMany harpsichords have a lid that can be raised, a cover for the keyboard, and a stand for music.\n\nHarpsichords have been decorated in a great many different ways: with plain buff paint (e.g. some Flemish instruments), with paper printed with patterns, with leather or velvet coverings, with [[chinoiserie]], or occasionally with highly elaborate painted artwork.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hubbard|1967}}, various locations</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Variants==<!-- This section is linked from [[Arley Hall]].

The strings are too close together for the jacks to fit between them. Instead, the strings are arranged in pairs, and the jacks are in the larger gaps between the pairs. The two jacks in each gap face in opposite directions, and each plucks a string adjacent to the gap.\n\nThe English diarist [[Samuel Pepys]] mentions his \"tryangle\" several times. This was not the percussion instrument that we call [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] today; rather, it was a name for octave-pitched spinets, which were triangular in shape.\n\n===Clavicytherium===\n{{Main article|Clavicytherium}}\nA clavicytherium is a harpsichord with the soundboard and strings mounted vertically facing the player, the same space-saving principle as an [[upright piano]].{{sfn|Dearling|1996|p=138}} In a clavicytherium, the jacks move horizontally without the assistance of gravity, so that clavicytherium actions are more complex than those of other harpsichords.\n\n[[File:DolmetschSpinet LateWinter.jpg|thumb|left|An ottavino built by [[Arnold Dolmetsch]] in 1923, and modeled after a 1698 instrument by Joannes Carcassi]]\n\n===Ottavino===\nOttavini are small spinets or virginals at [[Eight-foot pitch|four-foot pitch]]. Harpsichords at octave pitch were more common in the early Renaissance, but lessened in popularity later on. However, the ottavino remained very popular as a domestic instrument in Italy until the 19th century. In the Low Countries, an ottavino was commonly paired with an [[Eight-foot pitch|8']] virginals, encased in a small cubby under the soundboard of the larger instrument. The ottavino could be removed and placed on top of the virginal, making, in effect, a double manual instrument. These are sometimes called 'mother-and-child'<ref>Kottick (2003, 61)</ref> or 'double' virginals.<ref>{{cite book |title=Byron's letters and journals: 1816\u20131817 : 'So late into the night' |last=Marchand |first=Leslie Alexis |year=1973 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Harvard |isbn=978-0-674-08945-7 |page=75 }} \"Model IX is the famous double virginal.

Although there are no known extant pedal harpsichords from the 18th century or before, from Adlung (1758): the lower set of usually 8' strings \"...is built like an ordinary harpsichord, but with an extent of two octaves only. The jacks are similar, but they will benefit from being arranged back to back, since the two [bass] octaves take as much space as four in an ordinary harpsichord<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpsichord.org.uk/pedal/pedalharpsichord.htm |title=Pedal Harpsichords |publisher=Harpsichord.org.uk |date= |accessdate=22 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523193530/http://www.harpsichord.org.uk/pedal/pedalharpsichord.htm |archivedate=23 May 2013 }}</ref> Prior to 1980 when Keith Hill introduced his design for a pedal harpsichord, most pedal harpsichords were built based on the designs of extant pedal pianos from the 19th century, in which the instrument is as wide as the pedalboard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://keithhillharpsichords.com/about-keith-hill/|title=About Leith Hill|website=Keith Hill \u2013 Instrument Maker|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-30}}</ref> While these were mostly intended as practice instruments for organists, a few pieces are believed to have been written specifically for the pedal harpsichord.

The largest harpsichords have a range of just over five [[octave]]s, and the smallest have under four. Usually, the shortest keyboards were given extended range in the bass with a \"[[short octave]]\". The traditional pitch range for a 5-octave instrument is F<sub>1</sub>\u2013F<sub>6</sub> (FF\u2013f\u2034).\n\nTuning pitch is often taken to be A<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;415&nbsp;Hz, roughly a semitone lower than the modern standard concert pitch of A<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;440&nbsp;Hz. An accepted exception is for French baroque repertoire, which is often performed with a&nbsp;=&nbsp;392&nbsp;Hz, approximately a semitone lower again. See [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''[[Trait\u00e9 de l'harmonie r\u00e9duite \u00e0 ses principes naturels|Treatise on Harmony]]'' (1722) [Dover Publications], Book One, chapter five, for insight into French baroque tuning; \"Since most of these semitones are absolutely necessary in the tuning of organs and other similar instruments, the following chromatic system has been drawn up.\" Tuning an instrument nowadays usually starts with setting an A; historically it would commence from a C or an F.\n\nSome modern instruments are built with keyboards that can shift sideways, allowing the player to align the mechanism with strings at either A&nbsp;=&nbsp;415&nbsp;Hz or A&nbsp;=&nbsp;440&nbsp;Hz. If a tuning other than equal temperament is used, the instrument requires retuning once the keyboard is shifted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hubharp.com/technical_articles2/soundboard_transposingkeyboard.htm |title=The Transposing Keyboard |publisher=Hubharp.com |date= |accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ms 7295 f 128 Henri Arnault de Zwolle.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An early diagram of a vertical harpsichord (clavicytherium) by [[Arnault de Zwolle]], {{Circa|1430}}]]\n{{Main article|History of the harpsichord}}\n{{listen|type=music\n|filename=Bach C Major Prelude Equal.ogg|title=Johann Sebastian Bach \u2013 Prelude in C major, BWV 846|description=Performed by Robert Schr\u00f6ter on a French harpsichord \n|filename2=Domenico Scarlatti - Allegretto - D minor.ogg|title2=Domenico Scarlatti \u2013 Sonata in D minor K. 9, Allegretto|description2=Performed by [[Martha Goldstein]] on an Italian harpsichord\n|filename3=Johann Sebastian Bach - The English Suite -1 - 12EPrelude.ogg|title3=Johann Sebastian Bach \u2013 English Suite No. 1 in A major, BWV 806 \u2013 prelude|description3=Performed by Martha Goldstein on a Flemish harpsichord\n|filename4=Adriano_Banchieri - The Battle.ogg |title4=Adriano Banchieri \u2013 The Battle |description4=Performed by Sylvia Kind on a harpsichord of the type made in the early 20th century}}\nThe harpsichord was most likely invented in the late Middle Ages. By the 16th century, harpsichord makers in Italy were making lightweight instruments with low string tension. A different approach was taken in the [[Southern Netherlands]] starting in the late 16th century, notably by the [[Ruckers]] family. Their harpsichords used a heavier construction and produced a more powerful and distinctive tone. They included the first harpsichords with two keyboards, used for [[transposition (music)|transposition]].\n\nThe Flemish instruments served as the model for 18th century harpsichord construction in other nations. In France, the double keyboards were adapted to control different choirs of strings, making a more musically flexible instrument. Instruments from the peak of the French tradition, by makers such as the [[Blanchet (harpsichord makers)|Blanchet family]] and [[Pascal Taskin]], are among the most widely admired of all harpsichords, and are frequently used as models for the construction of modern instruments. In England, the [[Kirkman (harpsichord makers)|Kirkman]] and [[Burkat Shudi|Shudi]] firms produced sophisticated harpsichords of great power and sonority. German builders extended the sound repertoire of the instrument by adding [[eight foot pitch|sixteen foot]] and [[eight foot pitch|two foot]] choirs; these instruments have recently served as models for modern builders.\n\nIn the late 18th century the harpsichord was supplanted by the [[piano]] and almost disappeared from view for most of the 19th century: an exception was its continued use in opera for accompanying [[recitative]], but the piano sometimes displaced it even there. Twentieth century efforts to revive the harpsichord began with instruments that used piano technology, with heavy strings and metal frames. Starting in the middle of the 20th century, ideas about harpsichord making underwent a major change, when builders such as [[Frank Hubbard]], [[William Dowd]], and [[Martin Skowroneck]] sought to re-establish the building traditions of the Baroque period. Harpsichords of this type of historically informed building practice dominate the current scene.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Music==\n\n===Historical period===\n[[File:Bachbwv933.ogg|thumb|Bach's [[Six Little Preludes (Bach)#Little Prelude in C major, BWV 933|Little Prelude in C major]] being played on a harpsichord]]\nThe great bulk of the standard repertoire for the harpsichord was written during its first historical flowering, the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras.\n\nThe first music written specifically for solo harpsichord was published around the early 16th century. Composers who wrote solo harpsichord music were numerous during the whole Baroque era in European countries including Italy, Germany, England and France. Solo harpsichord compositions included dance [[suite (music)|suites]], [[fantasia (music)|fantasias]], and [[fugue]]s. Among the most famous composers who wrote for the harpsichord were the members of [[virginalist|English virginal school]] of the late Renaissance, notably [[William Byrd]] (ca. 1540\u20131623). In France, a great number of highly characteristic solo works were created and compiled into four books of ''ordres'' by [[Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]] (1668\u20131733). [[Domenico Scarlatti]] (1685\u20131757) began his career in Italy but wrote most of his solo harpsichord works in Spain; his most famous work is his series of [[List of solo keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti|555 harpsichord sonatas]]. Perhaps the most celebrated composers who wrote for the harpsichord were [[Georg Friedrich H\u00e4ndel]] (1685\u20131759), who composed numerous suites for harpsichord, and especially [[J. S. Bach]] (1685\u20131750), whose solo works (for instance, the [[Well-Tempered Clavier]] and the [[Goldberg Variations]]), continue to be performed very widely, often on the piano. Bach was also a pioneer of the harpsichord concerto, both in [[Harpsichord concertos (J. S. Bach)|works]] designated as such, and in the harpsichord part of his [[Brandenburg concertos|Fifth Brandenburg Concerto]].\n\nTwo of the most prominent composers of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]], [[Joseph Haydn]] (1732\u20131809) and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756\u20131791), wrote harpsichord music. For both, the instrument featured in the earlier period of their careers, {{citation needed span|date=July 2018|text=and although they had come into contact with the piano later on, they nonetheless continued to play the harpsichord and clavichord for the rest of their lives. Mozart was noted to have played his second last keyboard concerto (the [[Piano Concerto No. 26 (Mozart)|\"Coronation\"]]) on the harpsichord.}}\n\n===Music written for the revived instrument===\n{{main article|Contemporary harpsichord}}\nThrough the 19th century, the harpsichord was almost completely supplanted by the piano. In the 20th century, composers returned to the instrument, as they sought out variation in the sounds available to them. Under the influence of [[Arnold Dolmetsch]], the [[harpsichordist]]s [[Violet Gordon-Woodhouse]] (1872\u20131951) and in France, [[Wanda Landowska]] (1879\u20131959), were at the forefront of the instrument's renaissance. [[Harpsichord concerto|Concertos]] for the instrument were written by [[Francis Poulenc]] (the ''[[Concert champ\u00eatre]]'', 1927\u201328), and [[Manuel de Falla]]. [[Elliott Carter]]'s ''Double Concerto'' is scored for harpsichord, piano and two chamber [[orchestra]]s.

Both of these pigments are melanin types, produced inside the hair follicle and packed into granules found in the fibers. [[Eumelanin]] is the dominant pigment in [[brown hair]] and [[black hair]], while [[pheomelanin]] is dominant in [[red hair]]. [[Blond hair]] is the result of having little [[pigmentation]] in the hair strand. [[Gray hair]] occurs when melanin production decreases or stops, while [[poliosis]] is hair (and often the skin to which the hair is attached), typically in spots, that never possessed melanin at all in the first place, or ceased for natural genetic reasons, generally, in the first years of life.\n\n===Human hair growth===\n{{main article|Human hair growth}}\nHair grows everywhere on the external body except for mucus membranes and glabrous skin, such as that found on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and lips.\n\nHair follows a specific growth cycle with three distinct and concurrent phases: [[anagen]], [[catagen]], and [[telogen]] phases; all three occur simultaneously - while one strand of hair may be in the anagen phase, another may be in the telogen phase. Each has specific characteristics that determine the length of the hair.\n\nThe body has different types of hair, including [[vellus hair]] and [[androgenic hair]], each with its own type of cellular construction. The different construction gives the hair unique characteristics, serving specific purposes, mainly, warmth and protection.\n\n===Texture===\n[[File:OrangeCat hair.jpg|thumb|Orange [[American Shorthair|American shorthair]] cat.]]\nHair exists in a variety of textures. Three main aspects of hair texture are the curl pattern, volume, and consistency. The derivations of hair texture are not fully understood. All mammalian hair is composed of [[keratin]], so the make-up of [[hair follicles]] is not the source of varying hair patterns. There are a range of theories pertaining to the curl patterns of hair. Scientists have come to believe that the shape of the [[hair shaft]] has an effect on the curliness of the individual's hair. A very round shaft allows for fewer [[disulfide bonds]] to be present in the hair strand. This means the bonds present are directly in line with one another, resulting in straight hair.<ref name=\"Davidson genomics\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/genomics/2011/Piper/Background.html |title=Curly Hair Gene |publisher=Bio.davidson.edu |accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref> \n\nThe flatter the hair shaft becomes, the curlier hair gets, because the shape allows more [[cysteine]]s to become compacted together resulting in a bent shape that, with every additional disulfide bond, becomes curlier in form.<ref name=\"Davidson genomics\"/> As the hair follicle shape determines curl pattern, the hair follicle size determines thickness. While the circumference of the hair follicle expands, so does the thickness of the hair follicle. An individual's hair volume, as a result, can be thin, normal, or thick. The consistency of hair can almost always be grouped into three categories: fine, medium, and coarse. This trait is determined by the hair follicle volume and the condition of the strand.<ref name=\"hairdressing.ac.uk 153\">{{cite web |url=http://hairdressing.ac.uk/node/153 |title=Hair type, texture and density &#124; Hairdressing Training |publisher=Hairdressing.ac.uk |accessdate=28 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212010906/http://hairdressing.ac.uk/node/153 |archivedate=12 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Fine hair has the smallest circumference, coarse hair has the largest circumference, and medium hair is anywhere between the other two.<ref name=\"hairdressing.ac.uk 153\"/> Coarse hair has a more open cuticle than thin or medium hair causing it to be the most porous.<ref name=\"hairdressing.ac.uk 153\"/>\n\n====Classification systems====\nThere are various systems that people use to classify their curl patterns. Being knowledgeable of an individual's hair type is a good start to knowing how to take care of one's hair. There is not just one method to discovering one's hair type. Additionally it is possible, and quite normal to have more than one kind of hair type, for instance having a mixture of both type 3a & 3b curls. \n; {{resize|105%|Andre Walker system}}\n\nThe [[Andre Walker Hair Typing System]] is the most widely used system to classify hair. The system was created by the hairstylist of [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Andre Walker]]. According to this system there are four types of hair: straight, wavy, curly, kinky.\n\n* Type 1 is [[straight hair]], which reflects the most sheen and also the most resilient hair of all of the hair types. It is hard to damage and immensely difficult to curl this hair texture. Because the [[sebum]] easily spreads from the scalp to the ends without curls or kinks to interrupt its path, it is the most oily hair texture of all.\n* Type 2 is wavy hair, whose texture and sheen ranges somewhere between straight and curly hair. Wavy hair is also more likely to become [[frizz]]y than straight hair. While type A waves can easily alternate between straight and curly styles, type B and C Wavy hair is resistant to styling.\n* Type 3 is [[curly hair]] known to have an S-shape. The curl pattern may resemble a lowercase \"s\", uppercase \"S\", or sometimes an uppercase \"Z\" or lowercase \"z\". {{Citation needed|reason=this is suspect (or confusing) because the uppercase \"S\" has the same shape and the lowercase variety|date=September 2016}} This hair type is usually voluminous, \"climate dependent ([[humidity]] = frizz), and damage prone.\" Lack of proper care causes less defined curls.\n* Type 4 is [[kinky hair]], which features a tightly coiled curl pattern (or no discernible curl pattern at all) that is often fragile with a very high density. This type of hair shrinks when wet and because it has fewer cuticle layers than other hair types it is more susceptible to damage.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto 2.0em;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size:105%;padding-bottom:0.2em;\"|Andre Walker hair types\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| TYPE 1: Straight\n|-\n!style=\"width:3.0em;\"| 1a\n| Straight (Fine/Thin)&nbsp;\n| Hair tends to be very soft, shiny, oily and poor at holding curls, but difficult to damage.&nbsp;\n|-\n! 1b\n| Straight (Medium)\n| Hair characterised by volume and body.\n|-\n! 1c\n| Straight (Coarse)\n| Hair tends to be bone-straight and difficult to curl.

Hair provides thermal regulation and [[camouflage]] for many animals; for others it provides signals to other animals such as warnings, mating, or other communicative displays; and for some animals hair provides defensive functions and, rarely, even offensive protection. Hair also has a sensory function, extending the sense of touch beyond the surface of the skin. Guard hairs give warnings that may trigger a recoiling reaction.\n\n===Warmth===\n[[File:Ursus maritimus Steve Amstrup.jpg|thumb|left|Polar bears use their fur for warmth and while their skin is black, their transparent fur appears white and provides camouflage while hunting and serves as protection by hiding cubs in the snow.]]\n\nWhile humans have developed clothing and other means of keeping warm, the hair found on the head serves primarily as a source of heat [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] and cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair) as well as protection from ultra-violet radiation exposure. The function of hair in other locations is debated. Hats and coats are still required while doing outdoor activities in cold weather to prevent [[frostbite]] and [[hypothermia]], but the hair on the human body does help to keep the internal temperature regulated. When the body is too cold, the [[arrector pili]] muscles found attached to hair follicles stand up, causing the hair in these follicles to do the same. These hairs then form a heat-trapping layer above the [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]]. This process is formally called [[piloerection]], derived from the Latin words 'pilus' ('hair') and 'erectio' ('rising up'), but is more commonly known as 'having [[goose bumps]]' in English.<ref name=\"Why Do Humans Get goosebumps When They Are Cold, or under Other Circumstances?: Scientific American.\">{{Cite journal|last=Bubenik|first=George A.|date=1 September 2003|title=Why do humans get \"goosebumps\" when they are cold, or under other circumstances?|journal=Scientific American|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-do-humans-get-goosebu}}</ref> This is more effective in other mammals whose fur fluffs up to create air pockets between hairs that insulate the body from the cold. The opposite actions occur when the body is too warm; the arrector muscles make the hair lie flat on the skin which allows heat to leave.\n\n===Protection===\nIn some mammals, such as [[hedgehog]]s and [[porcupine]]s, the hairs have been modified into hard spines or quills. These are covered with thick plates of keratin and serve as protection against predators. Thick hair such as that of the lion's mane and grizzly bear's fur do offer some protection from physical damages such as bites and scratches.\n\n===Touch sense===\nDisplacement and vibration of hair shafts are detected by hair follicle nerve receptors and nerve receptors within the skin. Hairs can sense movements of air as well as touch by physical objects and they provide sensory awareness of the presence of [[ectoparasites]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2011.0987| pmid = 22171023| title = Human fine body hair enhances ectoparasite detection| journal = Biology Letters| volume = 8| issue = 3| pages = 358\u201361| year = 2011| last1 = Dean | first1 = I.| last2 = Siva-Jothy | first2 = M.

Dark skin probably evolved after humans lost their body fur, because the naked skin was vulnerable to the strong [[UV radiation]] as explained in the [[Out of Africa hypothesis]]. Therefore, evidence of the time when human skin darkened has been used to date the loss of human body hair, assuming that the dark skin was needed after the fur was gone.\nIt was expected that dating the split of the ancestral human louse into two species, the [[head louse]] and the [[pubic louse]], would date the loss of body hair in human ancestors.

This suggests that humans had lost body hair (but retained head hair) and developed thick pubic hair prior to this date, were living in or close to the forest where gorillas lived, and acquired pubic lice from butchering gorillas or sleeping in their nests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070316-gorilla-lice.html |title=Gorillas Gave Pubic Lice to Humans, DNA Study Reveals |work=National Geographic |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Biol |date=10 February 2009 |volume=8 |issue=2 |page=20 |title=Apes, lice and prehistory |author=Weiss RA |pmid=19232074 |pmc=2687769 |doi=10.1186/jbiol114}}</ref>\nThe evolution of the [[body louse]] from the head louse, on the other hand, places the date of clothing much later, some 100,000 years ago.<ref name=\"Stoneking\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.024|pmid=|url=http://www.beha.tcu.edu.tw/migration/ref/Kittler_et_al_2003_Current_Biology_Molecular_evolution_of_Pediculus_humanus_and_the_origin_of_clothing.pdf| title = Molecular Evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the Origin of Clothing| journal = Current Biology| volume = 14| issue = 24| page = 2309| year = 2004| last1 = Kittler | first1 = R. | last2 = Kayser | first2 = M. | last3 = Stoneking | first3 = M. }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 20823373| year = 2011| author1 = Toups| first1 = M.

[[Horse]]s and humans are two of the few animals capable of sweating on most of their body, yet horses are larger and still have fully developed fur. In humans, the skin hairs lie flat in hot conditions, as the arrector pili muscles relax, preventing heat from being trapped by a layer of still air between the hairs, and increasing heat loss by [[convection]].\n\nAnother hypothesis for the thick [[body hair]] on humans proposes that [[Fisherian runaway]] [[sexual selection]] played a role (as well as in the selection of long head hair), (see [[#Types of hair|types of hair]] and [[vellus hair]]), as well as a much larger role of testosterone in men. Sexual selection is the only theory thus far that explains the [[sexual dimorphism]] seen in the hair patterns of men and women. On average, men have more [[Androgenic hair|body hair]] than women. Males have more [[terminal hair]], especially on the [[facial hair|face]], [[chest hair|chest]], [[abdominal hair|abdomen]], and back, and females have more [[vellus hair]], which is less visible. The halting of hair development at a juvenile stage, vellus hair, would also be consistent with the [[neoteny]] evident in humans, especially in females, and thus they could have occurred at the same time.<ref>Dixson, A.F.

There is no evidence that sexual selection would proceed to such a drastic extent over a million years ago when a full, lush coat of hair would most likely indicate health and would therefore be more likely to be selected ''for'', not against, and not all human populations today have sexual dimorphism in body hair.\n\nA further hypothesis is that human hair was reduced in response to [[ectoparasites]].<ref name=\"Pagel&Bodmer2003\">{{Cite journal|year=2003 |author1=Pagel, Mark  |author2=Bodmer, Walter |title=A naked ape would have fewer parasites |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society|Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |pmid=12952654 |volume=270 |pages= S117\u2013S119 |pmc=1698033 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0041|issue=Suppl 1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=10961855|last1=Rantala|first1=MJ|year=1999|pages=1987\u20139|issue=12|volume=29|title=Human nakedness: adaptation against ectoparasites?|journal=International Journal for Parasitology|url=http://users.utu.fi/mjranta/reprints/1.%20Rantala1999.pdf|doi=10.1016/S0020-7519(99)00133-2}}</ref> The \"ectoparasite\" explanation of modern human nakedness is based on the principle that a hairless primate would harbor fewer parasites.  When our ancestors adopted group-dwelling social arrangements roughly 1.8 mya, ectoparasite loads increased dramatically. Early humans became the only one of the 193 primate species to have [[fleas]], which can be attributed to the close living arrangements of large groups of individuals. While primate species have communal sleeping arrangements, these groups are always on the move and thus are less likely to harbor ectoparasites. Because of this, selection pressure for early humans would favor decreasing body hair because those with thick coats would have more lethal-disease-carrying ectoparasites and would thereby have lower fitness.{{citation required|date=January 2018}}\n\nAnother view is proposed by [[James Giles (philosopher)|James Giles]], who attempts to explain hairlessness as evolved from the relationship between mother and child, and as a consequence of [[bipedalism]].

As a result, humans evolved the ability to sweat: a process which was facilitated by the loss of body hair.<ref name=Jablonski06/> A major problem with this theory,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} however, is that it does not explain why males are larger, hairier, and were more active in hunting than females. The female-male size differential among other closely associated primates is much greater than among humans, and therefore it was reduced during human evolution.\nOther primates have sweat gland in their armpits that function as those of humans, and thus it is probable that human sweat glands evolved from a similar distribution, spreading to more areas of the body, rather than occurring through evolution of a new trait. It is not known whether the increased distribution of sweat glands occurred before, during, or after, the change in body hair, or even whether the two are related developments. Horses also sweat, and they are larger, hairier, and expend more energy running than human males, so there may not be any connection between the ability to sweat and the apparent hairlessness of humans.\n\nAnother factor in human evolution that also occurred in the prehistoric past was a preferential selection for [[neoteny]], particularly in females. The idea that adult humans exhibit certain neotenous (juvenile) features, not evinced in the great apes, is about a century old. [[Louis Bolk]] made a long list of such traits,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bolk|first=L.|year=1926|title=Das Problem der Menschwerdung|publisher=Fischer|location=Jena|language=German}}</ref> and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] published a short list in ''[[Ontogeny and Phylogeny (book)|Ontogeny and Phylogeny]]''.<ref>short-list of 25 characters reprinted in Gould, Stephen Jay (1977).

While some might argue that, by this logic, humans should also express hairy shoulders because these body parts would putatively be exposed to similar conditions, the protection of the head, the seat of the brain that enabled humanity to become one of the most successful species on the planet (and which also is very vulnerable at birth) was arguably a more urgent issue (axillary hair in the underarms and groin were also retained as signs of sexual maturity). Sometime during the gradual process by which ''Homo erectus'' began a transition from furry skin to the naked skin expressed by Homo sapiens, hair texture putatively gradually changed from straight hair{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} (the condition of most mammals, including humanity's closest cousins\u2014chimpanzees) to [[Afro-textured hair]] or 'kinky' (i.e. tightly coiled). This argument assumes that curly hair better impedes the passage of UV light into the body relative to straight hair (thus curly or coiled hair would be particularly advantageous for light-skinned hominids living at the equator). \n\nIt is substantiated by Iyengar's (1998) findings that UV light can enter into straight human hair roots (and thus into the body through the skin) via the hair shaft. Specifically, the results of that study suggest that this phenomenon resembles the passage of light through fiber optic tubes (which do not function as effectively when kinked or sharply curved or coiled).  In this sense, when hominids (i.e. Homo Erectus) were gradually losing their straight body hair and thereby exposing the initially pale skin underneath their fur to the sun, straight hair would have been an adaptive liability.  By inverse logic, later, as humans traveled farther from Africa and/or the equator, straight hair may have (initially) evolved to aid the entry of UV light into the body during the transition from dark, UV-protected skin to paler skin.\n\nSome {{Who|date=August 2016}} conversely believe that tightly coiled hair that grows into a typical Afro-like formation would have greatly reduced the ability of the head and brain to cool because although African people's hair is much less dense than its European counterpart's, in the intense sun the effective 'woolly hat' that such hair produced would have been a disadvantage. However, such anthropologists as [[Nina Jablonski]] oppositely argue about this hair texture. Specifically, Jablonski's assertions<ref name=Jablonski06/>  suggest that the adjective \"woolly\" in reference to Afro-hair is a [[misnomer]] in connoting the high heat insulation derivable from the true wool of sheep. Instead, the relatively sparse density of Afro-hair, combined with its springy coils actually results in an airy, almost sponge-like structure that in turn, Jablonski argues,<ref name=Jablonski06/> more likely facilitates an increase in the circulation of cool air onto the scalp. Further, wet Afro-hair does not stick to the neck and scalp unless totally drenched and instead tends to retain its basic springy puffiness because it less easily responds to moisture and sweat than straight hair does. In this sense, the trait may enhance comfort levels in intense equatorial climates more than straight hair (which, on the other hand, tends to naturally fall over the ears and neck to a degree that provides slightly enhanced comfort levels in cold climates relative to tightly coiled hair).\n\nFurther, some {{Who|date=August 2016}} interpret the ideas of [[Charles Darwin]] as suggesting that some traits, such as hair texture, were so arbitrary to human survival that the role natural selection played was trivial. Hence, they argue in favor of his suggestion that sexual selection may be responsible for such traits. However, inclinations towards deeming hair texture \"adaptively trivial\" may root in certain cultural value judgments more than objective logic.  In this sense the possibility that hair ''texture'' may have played an adaptively significant role cannot be completely eliminated from consideration. In fact, while the sexual selection hypothesis cannot be ruled out, the asymmetrical distribution of this trait vouches for environmental influence. Specifically, if hair texture were simply the result of adaptively arbitrary human aesthetic preferences, one would expect that the global distribution of the various hair textures would be fairly random.  Instead, the distribution of Afro-hair is strongly skewed toward the equator. \n\nFurther, it is notable that the most pervasive expression of this hair texture can be found in sub-Saharan Africa; a region of the world that abundant genetic and paleo-anthropological evidence suggests, was the relatively recent (~200,000-year-old) point of origin for modern humanity. In fact, although genetic findings (Tishkoff, 2009) suggest that sub-Saharan Africans are the most genetically diverse continental group on Earth, [[Afro-textured hair]] approaches ubiquity in this region. This points to a strong, long-term selective pressure that, in stark contrast to most other regions of the genomes of sub-Saharan groups, left little room for genetic variation at the determining loci. Such a pattern, again, does not seem to support human sexual aesthetics as being the sole or primary cause of this distribution.\n\n[[File:Blackhair10.jpg|thumb|Straight black hair]]\n\n==== The EDAR locus ====\nA group of studies have recently shown that genetic patterns at the EDAR locus, a region of the modern human genome that contributes to hair texture variation among most individuals of East Asian descent, support the hypothesis that (East Asian) straight hair likely developed in this branch of the modern human lineage subsequent to the original expression of tightly coiled [[natural afro-hair]].<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18065779|last1=Fujimoto|first1=A|year=2008|pages=835\u201343|issue=6|volume=17|last2=Kimura|first2=R|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|last3=Ohashi|first3=J|last4=Omi|first4=K|last5=Yuliwulandari|first5=R|last6=Batubara|first6=L|last7=Mustofa|first7=MS|last8=Samakkarn|first8=U|last9=Settheetham-Ishida|first9=W|last10=Ishida|first10=T.|last11=Morishita|first11=Y.|last12=Furusawa|first12=T.|last13=Nakazawa|first13=M.|last14=Ohtsuka|first14=R.|last15=Tokunaga|first15=K.|title=A scan for genetic determinants of human hair morphology: EDAR is associated with Asian hair thickness|url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/6/835.full.pdf|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddm355|display-authors=8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18704500|last1=Fujimoto|first1=A|year=2008|pages=179\u201385|issue=2|volume=124|last2=Ohashi|first2=J|journal=Human Genetics|last3=Nishida|first3=N|last4=Miyagawa|first4=T|last5=Morishita|first5=Y|last6=Tsunoda|first6=T|last7=Kimura|first7=R|last8=Tokunaga|first8=K|title=A replication study confirmed the EDAR gene to be a major contributor to population differentiation regarding head hair thickness in Asia|url=http://www.tulips.tsukuba.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2241/103672/1/HG_124-2.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00439-008-0537-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mou|first1=C|last2=Thomason|first2=HA|last3=Willan|first3=PM|last4=Clowes|first4=C|last5=Harris|first5=WE|last6=Drew|first6=CF|last7=Dixon|first7=J|last8=Dixon|first8=MJ|last9=Headon|first9=DJ|title=Enhanced ectodysplasin-A receptor (EDAR) signaling alters multiple fiber characteristics to produce the East Asian hair form|journal=Human Mutation|volume=29|issue=12|pages=1405\u201311|year=2008|pmid=18561327|doi=10.1002/humu.20795}}</ref> Specifically, the relevant findings indicate that the EDAR mutation coding for the predominant East Asian 'coarse' or thick, straight hair texture arose within the past ~65,000 years, which is a time frame that covers from the earliest of the 'Out of Africa' migrations up to now.\n\n==Disease==\n{{See also|Hair diseases|}}\n[[Tinea corporis|Ringworm]] is a [[mycosis|fungal disease]] that targets hairy skin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dermatologyinfo.net/english/chapters/chapter10.htm |title=Dermatologyinfo.net |publisher=Dermatologyinfo.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\n[[Premature greying of hair]] is another condition that results in greying before the age of 20 years in Whites, before 25 years in Asians, and before 30 years in Africans.<ref>http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2013;volume=79;issue=5;spage=641;epage=653;aulast=Pandhi#ref4</ref>\n\n== Hair care ==\n{{Main|Hair care}}\nHair care involves the [[hygiene]] and [[cosmetology]] of hair including hair on the [[scalp]], facial, [[Pubic hair|pubic]] and other body hair. Hair care routines differ according to an individual's culture and the physical characteristics of one's hair. Hair may be colored, trimmed, shaved, plucked, or otherwise removed with treatments such as waxing, sugaring, and threading.\n\n===Removal practices===\n[[Depilation]] is the removal of hair from the surface of the skin. This can be achieved through methods such as [[shaving]]. [[Epilation]] is the removal of the entire hair strand, including the part of the hair that has not yet left the follicle. A popular way to epilate hair is through [[waxing]].\n\n====Shaving====\n[[File:Shaving-system-2blade.jpg|thumb|Many razors have multiple blades purportedly to ensure a close shave. While shaving initially will leave skin feeling smooth and hair free, new hair growth can appear a few hours after hair removal.]]\n[[Shaving]] is accomplished with bladed instruments, such as [[razors]]. The [[blade]] is brought close to the skin and stroked over the hair in the desired area to cut the terminal hairs and leave the skin feeling smooth. Depending upon the rate of growth, one can begin to feel the hair growing back within hours of shaving. This is especially evident in men who develop a [[five o'clock shadow]] after having shaved their faces. This new growth is called [[Shaving|stubble]]. Stubble typically appears to grow back thicker because the shaved hairs are blunted instead of tapered off at the end, although the hair never actually grows back thicker.\n\n====Waxing====\n[[Waxing]] involves using a sticky wax and strip of paper or cloth to pull hair from the root. Waxing is the ideal hair removal technique to keep an area hair-free for long periods of time. It can take three to six weeks for waxed hair to begin to resurface again. Hair in areas that have previously been waxed also is known to grow back finer and thinner, especially compared to hair that has been shaved with a razor.\n\n====Laser removal====\n{{main|Laser hair removal}}\n\nLaser hair removal is a cosmetic method where a small [[laser]] beam pulses selective heat on dark target matter in the area that causes hair growth without harming the skin tissue.  This process is repeated several times over the course of many months to a couple of years with hair regrowing less frequently until it finally stops; this is used as a more permanent solution to [[waxing]] or [[shaving]].  Laser removal is practiced in many clinics along with many at-home products.\n\n====Cutting and trimming====\n{{see also|Ponytail}}\n\nBecause the hair on the head is normally longer than other types of body hair, it is cut with [[scissors]] or [[Manual hair clippers|clippers]]. People with longer hair will most often use scissors to cut their hair, whereas shorter hair is maintained using a trimmer. Depending on the desired length and overall health of the hair, periods without cutting or trimming the hair can vary.\n\nCut hair may be used in [[wig]]s.

White hair is a sign of age or genetics, which may be concealed with [[Hair coloring|hair dye]] (not easily for some), although many prefer to assume it (especially if it is a [[poliosis]] characteristic of the person since childhood). Male pattern [[baldness]] is a sign of age, which may be concealed with a [[toupee]], hats, or religious and cultural adornments. Although drugs and medical procedures exist for the treatment of baldness, many balding men simply shave their heads. In early modern China, the queue was a male hairstyle worn by the Manchus from central Manchuria and the Han Chinese during the Qing dynasty; hair on the front of the head was shaved off above the temples every ten days, mimicking male-pattern baldness,  and the rest of the hair braided into a long pigtail.\n\n[[Hairstyle]] may be an indicator of group membership.

Regional variations in [[hirsutism]] cause practices regarding hair on the arms and legs to differ. Some religious groups may follow certain rules regarding hair as part of religious observance. The rules often differ for men and women.\n\nMany subcultures have hairstyles which may indicate an unofficial membership. Many [[hippie]]s, [[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]] and Indian [[sadhus]] have [[long hair]], as well many older [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|indie kids]]. Many [[punk fashion|punks]] wear a hairstyle known as a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] or other spiked and dyed hairstyles; [[skinhead]]s have short-cropped or completely shaved heads.

The [[dreadlocks]] of the [[Rastafari movement]] were despised early in the movement's history. In some cultures, having one's hair cut can symbolize a liberation from one's past, usually after a trying time in one's life. Cutting the hair also may be a sign of mourning.\n\nTightly coiled hair in its natural state may be worn in an [[Afro]]. This hairstyle was once worn among [[African American]]s as a symbol of racial pride. Given that the coiled texture is the natural state of some African Americans' hair, or perceived as being more \"African\", this simple style is now often seen as a sign of self-acceptance and an affirmation that the beauty norms of the ([[Eurocentrism|eurocentric]]) dominant culture are not absolute. It is important to note that African Americans as a whole have a variety of hair textures, as they are not an ethnically homogeneous group, but an ad-hoc of different racial admixtures.\n\nThe film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) includes the assumption that the two main characters could have their long hairs forcibly shaved with a rusty razor when jailed, symbolizing the intolerance of some conservative groups toward members of the [[counterculture]]. At the conclusion of the [[Oz trial|Oz obscenity trials in the UK in 1971]], the defendants had their heads shaved by the police, causing public outcry.

[[Orthodox Judaism]] also commands the use of scarves and other head coverings for married women for modesty reasons. Certain [[Hindu]] sects also wear head scarves for religious reasons. [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] have an obligation not to cut hair (a Sikh cutting hair becomes 'apostate' which means fallen from religion)<ref>Dilgeer, Harjinder Singh (2005) ''Dictionary of Sikh Philosophy'', Sikh University Press.</ref> and men keep it tied in a bun on the head, which is then covered appropriately using a [[turban]]. Multiple religions, both ancient and contemporary, require or advise one to allow their hair to become [[dreadlocks]], though people also wear them for fashion. For men, Islam, Orthodox Judaism, Orthodox Christianity, Roman Catholicism, and other religious groups have at various times recommended or required the covering of the head and sections of the hair of men, and some have dictates relating to the cutting of men's facial and head hair. Some Christian sects throughout history and up to modern times have also religiously proscribed the cutting of women's hair.

It was the first operational [[ground attack aircraft|close-support]] and [[reconnaissance]] [[fighter aircraft]] with [[vertical/short takeoff and landing]] (V/STOL) capabilities and the only truly successful V/STOL design of the many that arose in that era. The Harrier was developed directly from the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127|Hawker Siddeley Kestrel]] prototype aircraft, following the cancellation of a more advanced supersonic aircraft, the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1154]]. The British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) ordered the Harrier GR.1 and GR.3 variants in the late 1960s. It was exported to the United States as the AV-8A, for use by the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] (USMC), in the 1970s.\n\nDuring the Harrier's service the RAF positioned the bulk of the aircraft in [[West Germany]] to defend against a potential invasion of Western Europe by the [[Warsaw Pact]] forces; the unique abilities of the Harrier allowed the RAF to disperse their forces away from vulnerable airbases. The USMC used their Harriers primarily for [[close air support]], operating from [[amphibious assault ship]]s, and, if needed, [[forward operating base]]s. Harrier squadrons saw several deployments overseas. The Harrier's ability to operate with minimal ground facilities and very short runways allowed it to be used at locations unavailable to other fixed-wing aircraft. The Harrier received criticism for having a high accident rate and for a time-consuming maintenance process.\n\nIn the 1970s the [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier]] was developed from the Harrier for use by the [[Royal Navy]] (RN) on {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier}}s. The Sea Harrier and the Harrier fought in the 1982 [[Falklands War]], in which the aircraft proved to be crucial and versatile. The RN Sea Harriers provided fixed-wing air defence while the RAF Harriers focused on ground-attack missions in support of the advancing British land force. The Harrier was also extensively redesigned as the [[McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II|AV-8B Harrier II]] and [[British Aerospace Harrier II]] by the team of [[McDonnell Douglas]] and [[British Aerospace]]. The innovative Harrier family and its [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus]] engines with [[thrust vectoring]] nozzles have generated long-term interest in V/STOL aircraft. Similar V/STOL operational aircraft include the contemporary Soviet [[Yakovlev Yak-38]]. The F-35B V/STOL variant of the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] is under development.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\n{{Main|Hawker Siddeley P.1127}}\n<!-- This section is a summary.

Most services demand great aptitude and extensive training for Harrier pilots, as well as experience in piloting both types of aircraft. Trainee pilots are often drawn from highly experienced and skilled helicopter pilots.{{refn|In preparation for flying the Kestrel, pilots of the Tripartite Evaluation Squadron were provided with several hours of helicopter piloting tuition, all of whom agreed on the effort being highly worthwhile preparation.<ref name= Jefford_41/>|group=N}}<ref name= Jefford_41/>\n\nIn addition to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling the direction of the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit.<ref name= Jefford_42>Jefford 2006, p. 42.</ref> For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles downwards.<ref>Markman and Holder 2000, pp. 74\u201377.</ref><ref name=Jenkins_25>Jenkins 1998, p. 25.</ref>\n\nThe Harrier has two control elements not found in conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the [[reaction control system]]. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0\u00b0 (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98\u00b0 (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90\u00b0 vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by manipulating the control stick and is similar in action to the [[Helicopter flight controls#Cyclic|cyclic control]] of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.<ref name= Jefford_36>Jefford 2006, p. 36.</ref>\n\nThe wind direction is a critical factor in VTOL manoeuvres. The procedure for vertical takeoff involves facing the aircraft into the wind. The thrust vector is set to 90\u00b0 and the throttle is brought up to maximum, at which point the aircraft leaves the ground. The throttle is trimmed until a hover state is achieved at the desired altitude.<ref name= Brown_83/>  The short-takeoff procedure involves proceeding with normal takeoff and then applying a thrust vector (less than 90\u00b0) at a runway speed below normal takeoff speed; usually the point of application is around {{convert|65|kn|km/h}}. For lower takeoff speeds the thrust vector is greater.<ref name= Jefford_42/> The reaction control system involves a thrusters at key points in the aircraft's fuselage and nose, also the wingtips. Thrust from the engine can be temporarily syphoned to control and correct the aircraft's pitch and roll during vertical flight.<ref>[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Theories_of_Flight/control/TH28G9.htm \"Hawker Harrier reaction control system\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014143000/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Theories_of_Flight/control/TH28G9.htm |date=14 October 2011 }} ''U.S. Centennial of Flight'', 2003.

This is a [[dog fight|dog-fighting]] tactic, allowing for more sudden braking and higher turn rates.

As these specifications were similar, the Air Ministry announced that a single competition would be held to study aircraft submitted for both specifications.<ref name =\"mason p193\">Mason 1994, p.193.</ref>\n\n[[Sydney Camm]] of [[Hawker Aircraft]] designed the Harrier to meet the requirements of Specification 23/25, with the prototype (''J8325'') first flying in February {{avyear|1927}}, the first of the competitors for the two specifications to fly.<ref name =\"mason p193\"/> The Harrier was a two-seat biplane with single-bay wings powered by a geared [[Bristol Jupiter]] VIII radial engine. It was armed with one .303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) [[Vickers machine gun]] and one .303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) [[Lewis gun]] carrying a maximum of 1,000&nbsp;lb (454&nbsp;kg) of bombs.<ref name=\"Lewis bomber p162\">Lewis 1980, p.162.</ref>\n\nThe prototype Harrier was tested at the [[Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment]] (A & AEE) at [[RAF Martlesham Heath|Martlesham Heath]] in November 1927, where, while it met the requirements of Specification 23/25 and had satisfactory handling, the geared engine meant that it was underpowered,<ref name=\"Lewis bomber p162\"/> and it had an inferior bombload to the Hawker Horsley, the aircraft it was meant to replace.<ref name =\"mason p193\"/> It was therefore modified to carry a torpedo. On testing the modified aircraft, however, it was found to still be underpowered, being incapable of taking off with a torpedo, gunner and full fuel load.<ref name =\"mason p193\"/> It was therefore not considered further, the competition ultimately being won by the [[Vickers Vildebeest]].<ref name =\"mason p200\">Mason 1994, p.200.</ref>\n\nThe prototype was used by [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol]] as an engine testbed, flying with the 870&nbsp;hp (649&nbsp;kW) [[Bristol Hydra]] and the {{convert|495|hp|abbr=on}} [[Bristol Jupiter#Variants|Bristol Orion]] engines.<ref name =\"mason p193\"/>\n\n==Specifications (Harrier, as bomber)==\n{{aircraft specifications\n|plane or copter?=plane<!-- options: plane/copter -->\n|jet or prop?=prop<!-- options: jet/prop/both/neither -->\n|ref=Mason, The British Bomber since 1914  <ref name =\"mason p193\"/>\n|crew= two\n|capacity=\n|length main= 29 ft 7 in\n|length alt= 9.02 m\n|span main= 46 ft 3 in\n|span alt= 14.10 m\n|height main= 13 ft 4 in\n|height alt= 4.07 m\n|area main= 497 ft\u00b2\n|area alt= 46.2 m\u00b2\n|airfoil=\n|empty weight main= 3,278 lb\n|empty weight alt= 1,490 kg\n|loaded weight main= 5,656 lb\n|loaded weight alt= 2,561 kg\n|useful load main=  \n|useful load alt=  \n|max takeoff weight main=  \n|max takeoff weight alt=  \n|more general=\n|engine (prop)= [[Bristol Jupiter]] VIII\n|type of prop= nine cylinder [[radial engine]]\n|number of props=1\n|power main= 583 [[horsepower|hp]]\n|power alt= 435 kW\n|power original=\n   \n|max speed main= 117 [[knot (unit)|kn]]\n|max speed alt= 135 mph, 217 km/h\n|max speed more at 6,500 ft\n|cruise speed main= <!-- knots -->\n|cruise speed alt=<!--  mph, km/h -->\n|never exceed speed main= \n|never exceed speed alt=  \n|stall speed main=  \n|stall speed alt=  \n|range main= \n|range alt= \n|ceiling main= 20,000 ft\n|ceiling alt= 6,100 m\n|climb rate main= <!-- ft/min -->\n|climb rate alt= <!-- m/s -->\n|loading main= 11.4 lb/ft\u00b2\n|loading alt= 55.4 kg/m\u00b2\n|thrust/weight=<!-- a unitless ratio -->\n|power/mass main= 0.103 hp/lb\n|power/mass alt= 0.170 kW/kg\n|more performance=*'''Climb to 10,000 ft (3050 m):''' 18 min 30 sec\n|guns=1 \u00d7 forward firing .303 in (7.7 mm) [[Vickers gun]] and 1 \u00d7 .303 in (7.7 mm) [[Lewis gun]] on [[Scarff ring]] in rear cockpit. \n|bombs=''either'' 1 \u00d7 torpedo ''or'' 1,000 lb bombs \n|avionics=\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{aircontent\n|related=\n|similar aircraft=\n*[[Blackburn Beagle]]\n*[[Vickers Vildebeest]]\n|sequence=\n|lists =\n|see also=\n}}\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n*{{cite book |title= The British Bomber since 1914|last= Lewis|first= Peter|edition= Third |year= 1980|publisher=Putnam |location= London|isbn= 0-370-30265-6|pages= }} \n*{{Cite book |author=Mason, Francis K |title=The British Bomber since 1914 |publisher=Putnam Aeronautical Books|location=London |year=1994 |isbn= 0-85177-861-5}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Hawker Harrier}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930163732/http://www.britishaircraft.co.uk/aircraftpage.php?ID=486 Hawker Harrier] \u2013 British Aircraft Directory\n\n{{Hawker Aircraft aircraft}}\n\n[[Category:British bomber aircraft 1920\u20131929]]\n[[Category:Hawker aircraft|Harrier]]\n[[Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft]]\n[[Category:Biplanes]]\n[[Category:Aircraft first flown in 1927]]", "sha1": "aalziqocwss0tywqn4l8f0woib8lhsn"}}, {"title": "Herg\u00e9", "ns": "0", "id": "14317", "revision": {"id": "866047584", "parentid": "865287678", "timestamp": "2018-10-27T22:37:43Z", "contributor": {"username": "Hmains", "id": "508734"}, "minor": "", "comment": "standard quote handling in WP;standard Apostrophe/quotation marks in WP;

22 May 1907&nbsp;\u2013 3 March 1983), known by the pen name '''Herg\u00e9''' ({{IPAc-en|\u025b\u0259r|\u02c8|\u0292|e\u026a}};<ref>{{cite LPD|3}}</ref> {{IPA-fr|\u025b\u0281\u0292e|lang}}), was a Belgian [[cartoonist]]. He is best known for creating ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', the series of [[comic album]]s which are considered one of the most popular [[European comics]] of the 20th century. He was also responsible for two other well-known series, ''[[Quick & Flupke]]'' (1930\u201340) and ''[[The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko]]'' (1936\u201357). His works were executed in his distinct ''[[ligne claire]]'' drawing style.\n\nBorn to a lower middle-class family in [[Etterbeek]], Brussels, Herg\u00e9 began his career by contributing illustrations to [[Scouting]] magazines, developing his first comic series, ''[[The Adventures of Totor]]'', for ''Le Boy-Scout Belge'' in 1926. Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper ''[[Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle]]'', he created ''The Adventures of Tintin'' in 1929 on the advice of its editor [[Norbert Wallez]]. Revolving around the actions of boy reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and his dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]], the series' early installments \u2013 ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'', and ''[[Tintin in America]]'' \u2013 were designed as conservative propaganda for children. Domestically successful, after serialisation the stories were published in book form, with Herg\u00e9 continuing the series and also developing both the ''Quick & Flupke'' and ''Jo, Zette and Jocko'' series for ''Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle''. Influenced by his friend [[Zhang Chongren]], from 1934 Herg\u00e9 placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories, resulting in increased realism from ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'' onward. Following the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation of Belgium]] in 1940, ''Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle'' was closed but Herg\u00e9 continued his series in ''[[Le Soir]]'', a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration.\n\nAfter the Allied liberation of Belgium in 1944, ''Le Soir'' was shut down and its staff \u2013 including Herg\u00e9 \u2013 accused of having been collaborators. An official investigation was launched, and while no charges were brought against Herg\u00e9, in subsequent years he repeatedly faced accusations of having been a traitor and collaborator. With [[Raymond Leblanc]] he established ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine in 1946, through which he serialised new ''Adventures of Tintin'' stories. As the magazine's artistic director, he also oversaw the publication of other successful comics series, such as [[Edgar P. Jacobs]]' ''[[Blake and Mortimer]]''. In 1950 he established [[Studios Herg\u00e9]] as a team to aid him in his ongoing projects; prominent staff members [[Jacques Martin (comics)|Jacques Martin]] and [[Bob de Moor]] greatly contributed to subsequent volumes of ''The Adventures of Tintin''. Amid personal turmoil following the collapse of his first marriage, he produced ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'', his personal favourite of his works.

In traditional Wicca, the Horned God and the Goddess are seen as equal and opposite in gender polarity. However, in some of the newer traditions of Wicca, and especially those influenced by feminist ideology, there is more emphasis on the Goddess, and consequently the symbolism of the Horned God is less developed than that of the [[Goddess (Wicca)|Goddess]].<ref>{{Cite book\n|title=New Age Religion and Western Culture\n|publisher=State University of New York Press\n|location= \n|first=Wouter J.\n|last=Hanegraaff\n|year=1997\n|pages=\n|isbn=0-7914-3854-6}}</ref>{{rp|154}}\nIn Wicca the cycle of the seasons is celebrated during eight sabbats called The [[Wheel of the Year]].

There is some variation between Wiccan groups as to which sabbat corresponds to which part of the cycle. Some Wiccans regard the Horned God as dying at Lammas, August 1; also known as Lughnasadh, which is the first harvest sabbat. Others may see him dying at Mabon, the [[autumn equinox]], or the second harvest festival.

(In Wiccan liturgy in the Book of Shadows, this conception of an unknowable supreme deity is referred to as \"Dryghtyn.\" It is not a personal god, but rather an impersonal divinity similar to the Tao of Taoism.)\n\nWhilst the Horned God is the most common depiction of masculine divinity in Wicca, he is not the only representation. Other examples include the [[Green Man]] and the [[solar deity|Sun God]].<ref name=farrargod/> In traditional Wicca, however, these other representations of the Wiccan god are subsumed or amalgamated into the Horned God, as aspects or expressions of him. Sometimes this is shown by adding horns or antlers to the iconography. The Green Man, for example, may be shown with branches resembling antlers; and the Sun God may be depicted with a crown or halo of solar rays, that may resemble horns.

One is that the dish originates from the days of the old Scottish [[Drovers' road|cattle drovers]]. When the men left the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] to drive their cattle to market in [[Edinburgh]], the women would prepare rations for them to eat during the long journey down through the [[glen]]s. They used the ingredients that were most readily available in their homes and conveniently packaged them in a sheep's stomach allowing for easy transportation during the journey. Other speculations have been based on Scottish slaughtering practices. When a [[Chiefs of the Name|chieftain]] or [[laird]] required an animal to be slaughtered for meat (whether sheep or cattle) the workmen were allowed to keep the [[offal]] as their share.\n\nA joke sometimes maintained is that a haggis is [[Wild Haggis|a small Scottish animal]] with longer legs on one side, so that it can run around the steep hills of the Scottish highlands without falling over. According to one poll, 33 percent of American visitors to Scotland believed haggis to be an animal.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/nov/27/travelnews.travel \"American tourists believe Haggis is an animal\"], guardian.co.uk, 2003-11-27.</ref>\n\n==Modern use==\n[[Image:Bob Purdie addressing haggis 20040124.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Recitation of the poem ''Address to a Haggis'' by [[Robert Burns]] is an important part of the [[Burns supper]]]]\n[[File:Haggis supper 1.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Haggis Supper from a chip shop]]\n\nHaggis is traditionally served as part of the [[Burns supper]] on or near January 25, the birthday of Scotland's national poet [[Robert Burns]].

Sometimes haggis is sold in tins or a container which can be cooked in a microwave or conventional oven.

During the next several years, Aaron had some of his best games and best seasons as a major league player. On June 21, 1959, against the [[San Francisco Giants]], he hit three two-run home runs.

At the end of the 1969 season, Aaron again finished third in the MVP voting.\n\nIn 1970, Aaron reached two more career milestones. On May 17, Aaron collected his 3,000th hit, in a game against the [[Cincinnati Reds]], the team against which he played in his first major-league game.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=202}}</ref> Aaron established the record for most seasons with thirty or more home runs in the National League. On April 27, 1971, Aaron hit his 600th career home run, the third major league player ever to do so. On July 13, Aaron hit a home run in the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] (played at Detroit's [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]]) for the first time. He hit his 40th home run of the season against the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]]' [[Jerry Johnson (baseball)|Jerry Johnson]] on August 10, which established a National League record for most seasons with 40 or more home runs (seven). At age 37, he hit a career-high 47 home runs during the season (along with a career-high .669 [[slugging percentage]]) and finished third in MVP voting for the sixth time. During the strike-shortened season of 1972, Aaron tied and then surpassed Willie Mays for second place on the career home run list. Aaron also knocked in the 2,000th run of his career and hit a home run in the first All-Star game played in Atlanta. As the year came to a close, Aaron broke [[Stan Musial]]'s major-league record for total bases (6,134).

Aaron received thousands of letters every week during the summer of 1973, including hate mail; the Braves ended up hiring a secretary to help him sort through it.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=62}}</ref>\n\nAaron (then age 39) hit 40 home runs in 392 at-bats, ending the 1973 season one home run short of the record. He hit home run number 713 on September 29, 1973, and with one day remaining in the season, many expected him to tie the record. But in his final game that year, playing against the [[Houston Astros]] (managed by [[Leo Durocher]], who had once roomed with Babe Ruth), he was unable to achieve this. After the game, Aaron stated that his only fear was that he might not live to see the [[1974 MLB season|1974 season.]] <!-- The following sentence needs to be clarified or removed. Did Aaron speak of Clemente's death in this context?: [That statement wasn't just about the death threats: one year earlier, September 30, 1972 was the last day that the legendary [[Roberto Clemente]] ever played, as he perished in the offseason.] --><ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=179}}</ref>\n\nHe was the recipient of [[death threat]]s during the 1973\u20131974 offseason and a large assortment of hate mail from people who did not want to see Aaron break Ruth's nearly [[wikt:sacrosanct|sacrosanct]] home run record.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=64}}</ref> The threats extended to those providing positive press coverage of Aaron. [[Lewis Grizzard]], then sports editor of the ''Atlanta Journal'', reported receiving numerous phone calls calling journalists \"nigger lovers\" for covering Aaron's chase. While preparing the massive coverage of the home run record, he quietly had an obituary written, afraid that Aaron might be murdered.<ref>{{harvnb|Grizzard|1990|pp=239\u2013240}}</ref>\n\n''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' pointedly summarized the [[racism|racist]] vitriol that Aaron was forced to endure:\n\n<blockquote>Is this to be the year in which Aaron, at the age of thirty-nine, takes a [[Extra-vehicular activity|moon walk]] above one of the most hallowed individual records in American sport ... ? Or will it be remembered as the season in which Aaron, the most dignified of athletes, was besieged with hate mail and trapped by the cobwebs and goblins that lurk in baseball's attic?<ref>{{harvnb|Leggett|1973|p=29}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt the end of the 1973 season, Aaron received a plaque from the [[US Postal Service]] for receiving more mail (930,000 pieces) than any person excluding politicians.<ref name=TB/> Aaron received an outpouring of public support in response to the [[bigotry]]. Newspaper cartoonist [[Charles Schulz]] created a series of ''[[Peanuts]]'' strips printed in August 1973 in which Snoopy attempts to break the Ruth record, only to be besieged with hate mail. Lucy says in the August 11 strip, \"Hank Aaron is a great player ... but you! If you break Babe Ruth's record, it'll be a disgrace!\" Coincidentally, Snoopy was only one home run short of tying the record (and finished the season as such when Charlie Brown got picked off during Snoopy's last at-bat), and as it turned out, Aaron finished the [[1973 MLB season|1973 season]] one home run short of Ruth.<ref>{{harvnb|Schulz|2009|p=95}}</ref> Babe Ruth's widow, [[Claire Merritt Hodgson|Claire Hodgson]], denounced the racism and declared that her husband would have enthusiastically cheered Aaron's attempt at the record.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2005|p=25}}</ref> As the 1974 season began, Aaron's pursuit of the record caused a small controversy. The Braves opened the season on the road in [[Cincinnati]] with a three-game series against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. Braves management wanted him to break the record in [[Atlanta]], and were therefore going to have Aaron sit out the first three games of the season. But [[Commissioner of Baseball|Baseball Commissioner]] [[Bowie Kuhn]] ruled that he had to play two games in the first series. He played two out of three, tying Babe Ruth's record, 4 April 1974, in his very first at bat\u2014on his first swing of the season\u2014off Reds pitcher [[Jack Billingham]], but did not hit another home run in the series.<ref>{{harvnb|Minter|2002}}</ref>[[File:Aaron 715.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The fence outside of Turner Field over which Hank Aaron hit his 715th career home run still exists.]]\n\nThe Braves returned to Atlanta, and on April 8, 1974, a crowd of 53,775 people showed up for the game\u2014a Braves attendance record. The game was also broadcast nationally on [[NBC]]. In the fourth inning, Aaron hit home run number 715 off [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitcher [[Al Downing (baseball)|Al Downing]].<ref name=\"greatath\"/> Although Dodgers outfielder [[Bill Buckner]] nearly went over the outfield wall trying to catch it, the ball landed in the Braves' [[bullpen]], where [[relief pitcher]] [[Tom House]] caught it. While cannons were fired in celebration, two college students <ref name=\"vdtstudents\">{{harvnb|Poling|2010}}</ref> sprinted onto the field and jogged alongside Aaron for part of his circuit around the bases, temporarily startling him. A very youthful [[Craig Sager]] actually interviewed Aaron between third and home for a television station, WXLT (now [[WWSB]]-Channel 40) in Sarasota.<ref>{{harvnb|Hiestand|2013}}</ref> As the fans cheered wildly, Aaron's parents ran onto the field as well. Braves announcer [[Milo Hamilton]], calling the game on [[WSB (AM)|WSB]] radio, described the scene as Aaron broke the record: \"Henry Aaron, in the second inning walked and scored.

During the [[2006 in baseball|2006 season]], [[San Francisco Giants]] slugger [[Barry Bonds]] passed Babe Ruth and moved into second place on the all-time home run list, attracting growing media coverage as he drew closer to Aaron's record. Playing off the intense interest in their perceived rivalry, Aaron and Bonds made a television commercial that aired during [[Super Bowl XLI]], shortly before the start of the [[2007 in baseball|2007 baseball season]], in which Aaron jokingly tried to persuade Bonds to retire before breaking the record.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2013e}}</ref> As Bonds began to close in on the record during the 2007 season, Aaron let it be known that, although he recognized Bonds' achievements, he would not be present when Bonds broke the record.<ref name=\"workers2007\">{{harvnb|Gimbel|2007}}</ref>  There was considerable speculation that this was a snubbing of Bonds based on the widespread belief that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs and [[Anabolic steroids|steroids]] to aid his achievement.

[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] (1874)]]\n\nThe '''Holy Grail''' is a vessel that serves as an important motif in [[Arthurian literature]]. Different traditions describe it as a cup, dish or stone with miraculous powers that provide happiness, eternal youth or sustenance in infinite abundance, often in the custody of the [[Fisher King]]. The term \"holy grail\" is often used to denote an elusive object or goal that is sought after for its great significance.<ref>{{cite web |author=Merium-Webster |title=Definition of Holy Grail |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Holy%20Grail |publisher=Merium-Webster |accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA \"grail\", wondrous but not explicitly holy, first appears in ''[[Perceval, le Conte du Graal]]'', an unfinished romance written by [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]] around 1190. Here, Chr\u00e9tien's story attracted many continuators, translators and interpreters in the later 12th and early 13th centuries, including [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], who perceived the Grail as a stone. In the late 12th century, [[Robert de Boron]] wrote in ''Joseph d'Arimathie'' that the Grail was [[Jesus]]'s vessel from the [[Last Supper]], which [[Joseph of Arimathea]] used to catch [[Blood of Christ|Christ's blood]] at the [[Crucifixion]]. Thereafter, the Holy Grail became interwoven with the legend of the [[Holy Chalice]], the Last Supper cup, a theme continued in works such as the [[Vulgate Cycle]], the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]], and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.<ref name=\"Campbell, Joseph 1990, page 210\">Campbell 1990, p. 210.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''graal'', as it is earliest spelled, comes from [[Old French]] ''graal'' or ''greal'', cognate with [[Old Proven\u00e7al]] ''grazal'' and [[Catalan language|Old Catalan]] ''gresal'', meaning \"a cup or bowl of earth, wood, or metal\" (or other various types of vessels in different [[Occitan]] dialects).<ref name=\"Diez, Friedrich 1864, p. 236\">Diez, Friedrich. ''An etymological dictionary of the Romance languages'', Williams and Norgate, 1864, p. 236.</ref> The most commonly accepted etymology derives it from [[Latin]] ''gradalis'' or ''gradale'' via an earlier form, ''cratalis'', a derivative of ''crater'' or ''cratus'', which was, in turn, borrowed from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[krater]]'' (\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1, a large wine-mixing vessel).<ref name=\"Diez, Friedrich 1864, p. 236\" /><ref>Nitze, William A.

Lacy, ''The Arthurian Encyclopedia'', 1986</ref>\n\nIn the 15th century, English writer [[John Hardyng]] invented a fanciful new etymology for [[Old French]] ''san-graal'' (or ''san-gr\u00e9al''), meaning \"Holy Grail\", by parsing it as ''sang real'', meaning \"royal blood\".<ref>Barber 2004, p. 215.</ref><ref>Wood 2012, p. 55, 77.</ref> This etymology was used by some later British writers such as [[Thomas Malory]], and became prominent in the conspiracy theory developed in the book ''[[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]]'', in which ''sang real'' refers to the [[Jesus bloodline]].<ref name=Wood77>Wood 2012, p. 77.</ref>\n\n==Medieval literature==\n[[File:Galahad grail.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Galahad]], [[Bors]] and [[Percival]] achieve the Grail. Tapestry woven by [[William Morris|Morris & Co.]] Wool and silk on cotton warp, [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]]]]Grail literature divides into two classes. The first concerns King Arthur's knights visiting the Grail castle or questing after the object. The second concerns the Grail's history in the time of [[Joseph of Arimathea]].\n\nThe nine works from the first group are:\n* The ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'' by [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]].\n* [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail#The Continuations|Four continuations]] of Chr\u00e9tien's poem, by authors of differing vision and talent, designed to bring the story to a close.\n* The German ''[[Parzival]]'' by [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], which adapted at least the holiness of Robert's Grail into the framework of Chr\u00e9tien's story. In Wolfram's telling, the Grail was kept safe at the castle of [[Munsalvaesche]] (''mons salvationis''), entrusted to Titurel, the first Grail King. Some, not least the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monks, have identified the castle with their real sanctuary of [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]] in [[Catalonia]].\n* The Didot ''Perceval'', named after the manuscript's former owner, and purportedly a prosification of [[Robert de Boron]]'s sequel to ''Joseph d'Arimathie''.\n* The [[Welsh romance]] ''[[Peredur son of Efrawg]]'', a loose translation of Chr\u00e9tien's poem and the Coninuations, with some influence from native Welsh literature.\n* ''[[Perlesvaus]]'', called the \"least canonical\" Grail romance because of its very different character.\n* The German ''[[Diu Cr\u00f4ne]]'' (''The Crown''), in which [[Gawain]], rather than Perceval ([[Percival]]), achieves the Grail.\n* The ''[[Lancelot]]'' section of the vast [[Vulgate Cycle]], which introduces the new Grail hero, [[Galahad]].\n* The ''[[Queste del Saint Graal]]'', another part of the Vulgate Cycle, concerning the adventures of Galahad and his achievement of the Grail.\n\nOf the second group there are:\n* Robert de Boron's ''Joseph d'Arimathie.''\n* The ''Estoire del Saint Graal'', the first part of the Vulgate Cycle (but written after ''Lancelot'' and the ''Queste''), based on Robert's tale but expanding it greatly with many new details.\n* Verses by [[Rigaut de Berbezilh|Rigaut de Barbezieux]], a late 12th or early 13th-century<ref>Barber 2004, p. 418.</ref> Proven\u00e7al troubador, where mention is made of Perceval, the lance, and the Grail (\"Like Perceval when he lived, who stood amazed in contemplation, so that he was quite unable to ask what purpose the lance and grail served\" - \"''Attressi con Persavaus el temps que vivia, que s'esbait d'esgarder tant qu'anc non saup demandar de que servia la lansa ni-l grazaus''\"<ref>Sayce, Olive. ''Exemplary comparison from Homer to Petrarch'', DS Brewer, 2008, p. 143.</ref>).\n\nThe Grail was considered a bowl or dish when first described by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes. There, it is a processional [[salver]], a tray, used to serve at a feast.<ref>Staines, David. (Trans.) ''The Complete Romances of Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes''. Indiana University Press, Bloomington & Indianapolis, 1990, page 380.</ref> [[H\u00e9linand of Froidmont]] described a grail as a \"wide and deep saucer\" (''scutella lata et aliquantulum profunda''); other authors had their own ideas. Robert de Boron portrayed it as the vessel of the Last Supper. ''Peredur son of Efrawg'' had no Grail as such, presenting the hero instead with a platter containing his kinsman's bloody, severed head.<ref>Guest, Lady Charlotte. ''The Mabinogion. A Facsimile Reproduction of the Complete 1877 Edition'', Academy Press Limited Edition 1978, Chicago, Ill. page 124.</ref>\n\n===Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes===\nThe Grail is first featured in ''Perceval, le Conte du Graal'' (''The Story of the Grail'') by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes,<ref>Loomis 1991.</ref> who claims he was working from a source book given to him by his patron, Count [[Philip I, Count of Flanders|Philip of Flanders]].<ref>According to a French scholar, the book given by Philip I may be Ovid's ''The Metamorphoses'', in [http://www.zetetique.fr/index.php/nl/450-poz-76#dossier/ POZ #76](in French).</ref> In this incomplete poem, dated sometime between 1180 and 1191, the object has not yet acquired the implications of holiness it would have in later works. While dining in the magical abode of the [[Fisher King]], Perceval witnesses a wondrous procession in which youths carry magnificent objects from one chamber to another, passing before him at each course of the meal. First comes a young man carrying a bleeding lance, then two boys carrying candelabras. Finally, a beautiful young girl emerges bearing an elaborately decorated ''graal'', or \"grail\".<ref>Staines, David. (Trans.) ''The Complete Romances of Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes''. Indiana University Press, Bloomington & Indianapolis, 1990, page 379.</ref>\n\nChr\u00e9tien refers to this object not as \"The Grail\" but as \"a grail\" (''un graal''), showing the word was used, in its earliest literary context, as a common noun. For Chr\u00e9tien a grail was a wide, somewhat deep dish or bowl, interesting because it contained not a pike, salmon, or lamprey, as the audience may have expected for such a container, but a single Mass wafer which provided sustenance for the Fisher King's crippled father. Perceval, who had been warned against talking too much, remains silent through all of this and wakes up the next morning alone. He later learns that if he had asked the appropriate questions about what he saw, he would have healed his maimed host, much to his honour. The story of the Wounded King's [[inedia|mystical fasting]] is not unique; several saints were said to have lived without food besides communion, for instance Saint [[Catherine of Genoa]]. This may imply that Chr\u00e9tien intended the Mass wafer to be the significant part of the ritual, and the Grail to be a mere prop.<ref>Loomis 1991, p. 184.</ref>\n\n===Robert de Boron===\nThough Chr\u00e9tien's account is the earliest and most influential of all Grail texts, it was in the work of Robert de Boron that the Grail truly became the \"Holy Grail\" and assumed the form most familiar to modern readers in its Christian context.<ref>Weston 1993, p.161.</ref> In his verse romance ''Joseph d'Arimathie'', composed between 1191 and 1202, Robert tells the story of Joseph of Arimathea acquiring the chalice of the Last Supper to collect Christ's blood upon his removal from the cross. Joseph is thrown in prison, where Christ visits him and explains the mysteries of the blessed cup. Upon his release Joseph gathers his in-laws and other followers and travels to the west, and founds a dynasty of Grail keepers that eventually includes Perceval.\n\nThe authors of the Vulgate Cycle used the Grail as a symbol of [[divine grace]]; Galahad, illegitimate son of [[Lancelot]] and [[Elaine of Corbenic|Elaine]], the world's greatest knight and the Grail Bearer at the castle of [[Corbenic]], is destined to achieve the Grail, his spiritual purity making him a greater warrior than even his illustrious father.<ref>''The Quest of The Holy Grail'', translated by Matarasso, P.M., Penguin Books, 1969, page 60.</ref> Galahad and the interpretation of the Grail involving him were picked up in the 15th century by Sir Thomas Malory in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' and remain popular today.<ref>Malory, Sir Thomas, ''Le Morte D\u2019Arthur'', Penguin Books, 1969, Volume II, page 256.</ref>\n\n===Wolfram von Eschenbach===\nIn ''Parzival'', Wolfram von Eschenbach, citing the authority of a certain (probably fictional) [[Kyot|Kyot the Proven\u00e7al]], claimed the Grail was a Stone (called ''Lapsit exillis''<ref name=\"Von Eschenbach 1980, page 239\"/> which in alchemy is the name of the [[Philosopher's stone]]), the sanctuary of the neutral angels who took neither side during [[Lucifer]]'s rebellion.<ref name=\"Von Eschenbach 1980, page 239\">Von Eschenbach, Wolfram. ''Parzival''. [[Arthur Thomas Hatto|Hatto, A.T.]] translator. Penguin Books, 1980, page 239.</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Campbell]] considered ''Parzival'' the greatest of the Grail stories, told from a heroic view, where Parzival, is a married man and a self-motivated figure.<ref name=\"Campbell, Joseph 1990, page 210\" /> There are [[Alchemy|Alchemical]] and [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] themes running through Wolfram's ''Parzival''. Campbell sees the Grail as, \"...a stone vessel, which was brought down from heaven. Now what he (Wolfram) is doing is imitating the [[Muslim]] [[Kaaba]], the stone at [[Mecca]] that was brought down from heaven\".<ref>Campbell 1990, p. 246.</ref> At the end of the story, writing appears on the stone which reads: \"...any [[Knights Templar|Templar]] whom God should bestow on a distant people for their lord must forbid them to ask his name of lineage, but must help them gain their rights.\"<ref>Von Eschenbach, Wolfram. ''Parzival''. [[Arthur Thomas Hatto|Hatto, A.T.]] translator. Penguin Books, 1980, page 406.</ref> Campbell explains that for the first time in the history of civilization: \"Here is the idea of the king ruling, not in his name, but in the name of the people.\"<ref>Campbell 1990, p. 259.</ref>\n\n==Modern interpretations==\n\n===Scholarly hypotheses===\nScholars have long speculated on the origins of the Holy Grail before Chr\u00e9tien, suggesting that it may contain elements of the trope of magical cauldrons from [[Celtic mythology]] combined with Christian legend surrounding the [[Eucharist]],<ref>Weston 1993, p. 74, 129.</ref> the latter found in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] sources, conceivably in that of the [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine Mass]], or even Persian sources.<ref>Jung, Emma and von Franz, Marie-Louise. ''The Grail Legend'', Sigo Press, Boston, 1980, p. 14.</ref> The view that the \"origin\" of the Grail legend should be seen as deriving from Celtic mythology was championed by [[Roger Sherman Loomis]], [[Alfred Nutt]] and [[Jessie Weston]]. Loomis traced a number of parallels between [[Medieval Welsh literature]] and Irish material and the Grail romances, including similarities between the ''[[Mabinogion]]''{{'}}s [[Bran the Blessed]] and the Arthurian [[Fisher King]], and between Bran's life-restoring cauldron and the Grail.\n\nThe opposing view dismissed the \"Celtic\" connections as spurious and interpreted the legend as essentially Christian in origin. Joseph Goering of the [[University of Toronto]] has identified sources for Grail imagery in 12th-century wall paintings from churches in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[Pyrenees]] (now mostly removed to the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]]), which present unique iconic images of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a bowl that radiates tongues of fire, images that predate the first literary account by [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]]. Goering argues that they were the original inspiration for the Grail legend.<ref>Goering, Joseph (2005). ''The Virgin and the Grail: Origins of a Legend''.

These artifacts are said to have been the vessel used at the Last Supper, but other details vary. Despite the prominence of the Grail literature, traditions about a Last Supper relic remained rare in contrast to other items associated with Jesus' last days, such as the [[True Cross]] and [[Holy Lance]].<ref name=\"Wood, Juliette 2012 p. 91\">Wood 2012, p. 91.</ref>\n\nOne tradition predates the Grail romances: in the 7th century, the pilgrim [[Arculf]] reported that the Last Supper chalice was displayed near Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Wood, Juliette 2012 p. 91\"/><ref>Barber 2004, p. 167.</ref> In the wake of Robert de Boron's Grail works, several other items came to be claimed as the true Last Supper vessel. In the late 12th century, one was said to be in [[Byzantium]]; [[Albrecht von Scharfenberg]]'s Grail romance ''[[Der J\u00fcngere Titurel]]'' associated it explicitly with the Arthurian Grail, but claimed it was only a copy.<ref name=barber93/> This item was said to have been looted in the [[Fourth Crusade]] and brought to [[Troyes]] in France, but it was lost during the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=\"Wood, Juliette 2012 p. 94\">Wood 2012, p. 94.</ref><ref>Barber 2004, p. 168.</ref>\n\nTwo relics associated with the Grail survive today. The ''Sacro Catino'' is a green glass dish held at the [[Genoa Cathedral]] said to have been used at the Last Supper. Its provenance is unknown, and there are two divergent accounts of how it was brought to Genoa by [[Crusaders]] in the 12th century. It was not associated with the Last Supper until later, in the wake of the Grail romances; the first known association is in [[Jacobus da Varagine]]'s chronicle of Genoa in the late 13th century, which draws on the Grail literary tradition. The Catino was moved and broken during [[Napoleon]]'s conquest in the early 19th century, revealing that it is glass rather than emerald.<ref name=barber93/><ref>Wood 2012, p. 94\u201395.</ref> The Holy Chalice of [[Valencia]] is an [[agate]] dish with a mounting for use as a chalice. The bowl may date to [[Greco-Roman]] times, but its dating is unclear, and its provenance is unknown before 1399, when it was gifted to [[Martin I of Aragon]]. By the 14th century an elaborate tradition had developed that this object was the Last Supper chalice. This tradition mirrors aspects of the Grail material, with several major differences, suggesting a separate tradition entirely. It is not associated with Joseph of Arimathea or Jesus' blood; it is said to have been taken to Rome by [[Saint Peter]] and later entrusted to [[Saint Lawrence]].<ref>Wood 2012, p. 95\u201396.</ref><ref>Barber 2004, p. 169\u2013170.</ref> Early references do not call the object the \"Grail\"; the first evidence connecting it to the Grail tradition is from the 15th century.<ref>Barber 2004, p. 170.</ref> The monarchy sold the cup in the 15th century to [[Valencia Cathedral]], where it remains a significant local icon.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 95.</ref>\n\nSeveral objects were identified with the Holy Grail in the 17th century.<ref name=\"Wood, Juliette 2012 p. 94\"/> In the 20th century, a series of new items became associated with it. These include the [[Nanteos Cup]], a medieval wooden bowl found near [[Rhydyfelin]], Wales; a glass dish found near [[Glastonbury]], England; and the [[Antioch chalice]], a 6th-century [[silver-gilt]] object that that became attached to the Grail legend in the 1930s.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 96\u201397.</ref>\n\n===Locations associated with the Holy Grail===\nIn the modern era, a number of places have become associated with the Holy Grail. One of the most prominent is [[Glastonbury]] in [[Somerset]], England. Glastonbury was associated with King Arthur and his resting place of [[Avalon]] by the 12th century.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 51\u201352.</ref> In the 13th century, a legend arose that Joseph of Arimathea was the founder of [[Glastonbury Abbey]]. Early accounts of Joseph at Glastonbury focus on his role as the evangelist of Britain rather than as the custodian of the Holy Grail, but from the 15th century, the Grail became a more prominent part of the legends surrounding Glastonbury.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 53\u201355.</ref> Interest in Glastonbury resurged in the late 19th century along, inspired by renewed interest in the Arthurian legend and contemporary spiritual movements centered on ancient sacred sites.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 55\u201360.</ref> In the late 19th century, [[John Goodchild]] hid a glass bowl near Glastonbury; a group of his friends, including [[Wellesley Tudor Pole]], retrieved the cup in 1906 and promoted it as the original Holy Grail.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 57\u201358.</ref> Glastonbury and its Holy Grail legend have since become a point of focus for various [[New Age]] and [[Neopagan]] groups.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 58\u201360.</ref>\n\n[[Ch\u00e2teau de Monts\u00e9gur|Monts\u00e9gur]], a medieval castle in southern France, has become identified as the Grail castle in modern Grail lore. In 1906, French esoteric writer [[Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan]] identified Monts\u00e9gur as [[Munsalv\u00e4sche]] or Montsalvat, the Grail castle in Wolfram's ''Parzival''. Monts\u00e9gur was a fortress of the [[Cathars]], a heretical Christian sect in southern France from the 11th-14th centuries. This identification has inspired a wider legend asserting that the Cathars possessed the Holy Grail.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 75\u201376.</ref> Similarly, the 14th-century [[Rosslyn Chapel]] in [[Midlothian]], Scotland, became attached to the Grail legend in the 20th century. This idea began in the 1950s, but took new prominence in the 1980s when a succession of conspiracy books identified it as a secret hiding place of the Grail.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 88\u201389.</ref>\n\n===Pseudohistory and conspiracy theories===\nSince the 19th century, the Holy Grail has been linked to various conspiracy theories. In 1818, Austrian pseudohistorical writer [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]] connected the Grail to contemporary myths surrounding the [[Knights Templar]] that cast the order as a secret society dedicated to mystical knowledge and relics. In Hammer-Purgstall's work, the Grail is not a physical relic but a symbol of secret knowledge that the Templars sought. There is no historical evidence linking the Templars to a search for the Grail, but subsequent writers have elaborated on the Templar theories.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 70, 73\u201374.</ref> Starting in the early 20th century, writers, particularly in France, further connected the Templars and Grail to the Cathars. According to these theories, the Cathars guarded the Grail at Monts\u00e9gur, and smuggled it out during their suppression in the 14th century.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 74\u201376.</ref>\n\nIn 1933, German writer [[Otto Rahn]] published the first of a series of books tying the Grail, Templars, and Cathars to a German nationalist mythology. According to Rahn, the Grail was a symbol of a pure Germanic religion repressed by Christianity. Rahn's books inspired interest in the Grail in [[Occultism in Nazism|Nazi occultism]] and led to [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s abortive sponsorship by of Rahn's search for the Grail, as well as many subsequent conspiracy theories and fictional works about the Nazis searching for the Grail.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 76\u201377.</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, British writers [[Michael Baigent]], [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]] and [[Henry Lincoln]] created one of the most widely known conspiracy theories about the Holy Grail. The theory first appeared in the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Chronicle (UK TV series)|Chronicle]]'' in the 1970s, and was elaborated upon in the bestselling 1982 book ''[[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]]''.<ref name=Wood77/> The theory combines myths about the Templars and Cathars with various other legends and a prominent [[hoax]] about a secret order called the [[Priory of Sion]]. According to this theory, the Holy Grail is not a physical object, but a symbol of the [[bloodline of Jesus]]. The blood connection is based on the etymology reading ''san greal'' (holy grail) as ''sang real'' (royal blood), which dates to the 15th century.<ref name=Wood77/> The narrative developed here is that [[Jesus]] was not divine, and had children with [[Mary Magdalene]]. Mary took the family to France where their descendants became the country's first Christian dynasty, the [[Merovingians]]. While the [[Catholic Church]] worked to destroy the dynasty, they were protected by the Priory of Sion and their associates, including the Templars, Cathars, and other secret societies.<ref>Wood 2012, p. 77\u201382.</ref> The book, its arguments, and its evidence have been widely criticized by scholars, but it has had a vast influence on conspiracy and [[alternate history]] books. It has also inspired fiction, most notably [[Dan Brown]]'s 2003 novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and its 2006 [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|film adaptation]].<ref>Wood 2012, p. 77, 81\u201382.</ref>\n\n===Literature===\nThe story of the Grail and of the quest to find it became increasingly popular in the 19th century, referred to in literature such as [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s Arthurian cycle the ''[[Idylls of the King]]''. A sexualised interpretation of the grail, now identified with female genitalia, appeared in 1870 in [[Hargrave Jennings]]' book ''The Rosicrucians, Their Rites and Mysteries''.<ref>Writing of the Order of the Garter ceremonies Jennings writes on page 323:- The whole refers to King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table; set round as sentinels ('in lodge') of the Sangreal, or Holy Graal--the 'Sacrifice Mysterious', or 'Eucharist'. But how is all this magic and sacred in the estimate of the Rosicrucians?' an inquirer will very naturally ask. The answer to all this is very, ample and satisfactory; but particulars must be left to the sagacity of the querist himself, because propriety does not admit of explanation. Suffice it to say, that it is one of the most curious and wonderful subjects which has occupied the attention of antiquaries. That archaeological puzzle, the 'Round Table of King Arthur', is a perfect display of this whole subject of the origin of the 'Garter'; it springs directly from it, being the same object as that enclosed by the mythic garter, 'garder', or 'girther.'</ref>\n\n[[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922) loosely follows the legend of the Holy Grail and the Fisher King combined with vignettes of contemporary British society. In his first note to the poem Eliot attributes the title to [[Jessie L. Weston]]'s book on the [[Grail]] legend, ''[[From Ritual to Romance]]''. The allusion is to the wounding of the [[Fisher King]] and the subsequent sterility of his lands. A poem strikingly similar in theme and language called written by [[Madison Cawein]], was published in 1913 in [[Poetry (magazine)|''Poetry'']].<ref>{{cite web|author=January 1913 |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/toc/4 |title=January 1913 : Poetry Magazine |publisher=Poetryfoundation.org |accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n* In [[John Cowper Powys]]'s ''[[A Glastonbury Romance]]'' (1932) the \"heroine is the Grail,\"<ref>\"Preface\" to ''A Glastonbury Romance''.

The properties of the item are not explicit, but the relic itself makes an appearance and is in the hands of Nichodemus by the end of the novel's events.\n\n===Music and painting===\nThe combination of hushed reverence, chromatic harmonies and sexualized imagery in Richard Wagner's final music drama ''[[Parsifal]]'', premiered in 1882, developed this theme, associating the grail \u2013 now periodically producing blood \u2013 directly with female fertility.<ref>Donington, Robert (1963). ''Wagner's \"Ring\" and its Symbols: the Music and the Myth''. Faber</ref> The high seriousness of the subject was also epitomized in [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s painting in which a woman modeled by [[Alexa Wilding]] holds the Grail with one hand, while adopting a gesture of blessing with the other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/dante-gabriel-rossetti-461|title= Rossetti, Dante Gabriel, 1828\u20131882, Tate.}}</ref>\n\nA major mural series depicting the Quest for the Holy Grail was done by the artist [[Edwin Austin Abbey]] during the first decade of the 20th century for the [[Boston Public Library]].

More recent adaptations of the motif include the hit films ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989) and ''[[The Fisher King]]'' (1991).\n\n* ''[[The Silver Chalice]]'', a novel about the Grail by [[Thomas B. Costain]], was made into a 1954 film. \n* In ''The Light of Faith'' (1922), [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] attempted to steal the Grail. \n* ''[[Lancelot du Lac (film)|Lancelot du Lac]]'' (1974) was made by [[Robert Bresson]]. \n* ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975) is a comedic take on the Arthurian Grail quest, adapted in 2004 as the stage production ''[[Spamalot]]''. \n* [[John Boorman]], in his film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' (1985), attempted to restore a more traditional heroic representation of an Arthurian tale, in which the Grail is revealed as a mystical means to revitalise Arthur and the barren land to which his depressive sickness is connected. \n* Influenced by the 1982 publication of the ostensibly non-fiction ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'', [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' (2003) the \"grail\" is taken to refer to Mary Magdalene as the \"receptacle\" of Jesus' bloodline (playing on the ''sang real'' etymology). In Brown's novel, it is hinted that this Grail was long buried beneath [[Rosslyn Chapel]] in [[Scotland]], but that in recent decades its guardians had it moved to a secret chamber embedded in the floor beneath the ''[[La Pyramide Invers\u00e9e|Inverted Pyramid]]'' in the entrance of the [[Louvre|Louvre museum]].\n* It is also a central theme in the ''[[Stargate SG-1 (season 10)|Stargate SG-1]]'' [[Stargate SG-1 (season 10)|(season 10)]] episode \"The Quest\".\n* In the ''[[Fate/stay night|Fate]]'' visual novel and anime series and related spinoffs, the Holy Grail serves as the prize of the Holy Grail War, granting a single wish to the victor of the battle royale. However, it's hinted at throughout the series that this Grail is not the real chalice of Christ, but is actually an item of uncertain nature created by mages some generations ago.\n* In the video game ''[[Persona 5]]'', the Holy Grail is the Treasure of the game's final Palace, representing the combined desires of all of humanity for a higher power to take control their lives and make a world that has no sense of individuality.\n* In the television series [[Knightfall (TV series)|''Knightfall'']], the search for the Holy Grail by the [[Knights Templar]] is a major theme of the series' first season. The Grail, which appears as a simple earthenware cup, is coveted by various factions including the Pope, who thinks that possession of it will enable him to ignite another Crusade.\n* In the season one episode \"[[Grail (Babylon 5)|Grail]]\" of the television series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', a man named Aldous Gajic visits Babylon 5 in his continuing quest to find the Holy Grail. His quest is primarily a plot device - the episode's action revolves not around the quest but rather around his presence and impact on the life of a station resident.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Akshaya Patra]] (Hindu mythology)\n* [[Arma Christi]]\n* [[Cornucopia]] (Greek mythology)\n* [[Cup of Jamshid]] (Persian mythology)\n*[[Fairy cup legend]]\n* [[Holy Chalice]] (Christian mythology)\n* [[List of mythological objects]]\n* [[Relics associated with Jesus]]\n* [[Sampo]] (Finnish mythology)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Barber, Richard (2004).

A player of the game enters commands to move through the rooms or to shoot \"crooked arrows\" along a tunnel into one of the adjoining rooms. There are twenty rooms, each connecting to three others, arranged like the vertices of a [[dodecahedron]] or the faces of an [[icosahedron]] (which are identical in layout). Hazards include bottomless pits, super bats (which drop the player in a random location, a feature duplicated in later, commercially published [[adventure game]]s, such as ''[[Zork I]]'', ''[[Valley of the Minotaur]]'', and ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]''), and the Wumpus itself. The Wumpus is described as having sucker feet (to escape the bottomless pits) and being too heavy for a super bat to lift. When the player has deduced from hints which chamber the Wumpus is in without entering the chamber, the player fires an arrow into the Wumpus's chamber to kill it. The player wins the game if the  Wumpus is killed. However, firing the arrow into the wrong chamber startles the Wumpus, which may cause it to move to an adjacent room. The player loses if he or she is in the same room as the Wumpus (which then eats him or her) or a bottomless pit (which he or she then falls into).\n\n=== Game elements ===\nYob's original program had these features, while later programs differ here.\n* Objects:\n** Wumpus: your target; a beast that eats you if you ever end up in the same room.\n** Super Bats (2): creatures that instantly carry you to a random room.\n** Pits (2): fatal to you if you enter the room.\n* Actions: There are two possible actions:\n** Move: to one of the three rooms connected to your current one.\n** Shoot: fire a \"crooked arrow\" a distance of 1-5 rooms; you must name each room it will reach.\n* Warning messages: Give you information about the contents of adjacent rooms.\n** Wumpus: \"I smell a wumpus\"\n** Bat: \"Bats nearby\"\n** Pit: \"I feel a draft\"\n\n== Reception and cultural impact ==\n{{Prose|section|date=March 2016}}\n* The card game ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' has featured several \"Wumpus\" cards.

Cosmopolitan Book was sold to [[Farrar and Reinhart]] in 1931.<ref name=\"cosmobook\" /> Hearst was also forced to sell the ''Washington Times'' and ''Herald'' to Eleanor \"Cissy\" Patterson (of the McCormick-Patterson family that owned the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'') in 1939 who merged them to form the ''[[Washington Times-Herald]]''. That year he also bought the ''[[The Milwaukee Sentinel|Milwaukee Sentinel]]'' from Paul Block (who bought it from the Pfisters in 1929), absorbing his afternoon ''Wisconsin News'' into the morning publication. Also in 1939, he sold the ''Atlanta Georgian'' to Cox Newspapers, which merged it with the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]''.\n\nHearst, with his chain now owned by his creditors after a 1937 liquidation, also had to merge some of his morning papers into his afternoon papers.  In Chicago, he combined the morning ''Herald-Examiner'' and the afternoon ''American'' into the ''Herald-American'' in 1939.  This followed the 1937 combination of the New York ''Evening Journal'' and the morning ''American'' into the ''Journal-American'', the sale of the ''Omaha Bee-News'' to the ''[[World-Herald]]''. Abandoning the morning market was harmful in the long run for Hearst's media empire as most of his remaining newspapers became afternoon papers. Newspapers in Rochester, Syracuse and Fort Worth were sold or closed.\n\nAfternoon papers were a profitable business in pre-television days, often outselling their morning counterparts featuring stock market information in early editions, while later editions were heavy on sporting news with results of baseball games and horse races. Afternoon papers also benefited from continuous reports from the battlefront during [[World War II]]. After the war however, both television news and suburbs experienced an explosive growth; thus, evening papers were more affected than those published in the morning, whose circulation remained stable while their afternoon counterparts' sales plummeted. Another major blow was the fact that beginning in the 1950s, football and baseball games were being played later in the afternoon and now stretched through early in the evening, preventing afternoon papers from publishing all the results.\n\nIn 1947, Hearst produced an early television newscast for the [[DuMont Television Network]]: ''[[I.N.S. Telenews]]'', and in 1948 he became the owner of one of the first television stations in the country, [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]].\n\nThe earnings of Hearst's three morning papers, the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Examiner]]'', and ''The Milwaukee Sentinel'', supported the company's money-losing afternoon publications such as the ''Los Angeles Herald-Express'', the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'', and the ''[[Chicago American]]''. The company sold the latter paper in 1956 to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'''s owners, who changed it to the tabloid-size ''Chicago Today'' in 1969 and ceased publication in 1974). In 1960, Hearst also sold the ''Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph'', to the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''  and the ''Detroit Times'' to ''[[The Detroit News]]''.  After a lengthy strike it sold the ''Milwaukee Sentinel'' to the afternoon ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'' in 1962.  The same year Hearst's Los Angeles papers \u2013 the morning ''Examiner'' and the afternoon ''Herald-Express'' - merged to become the evening ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]]''. The [[1962-63 New York City newspaper strike]] left the city with no papers for over three months, with the ''Journal-American''  one of the earliest strike targets of the Typographical Union. The ''Boston Record'' and the ''Evening American'' merged in 1961 as the ''Record-American'' and in 1964, the ''Baltimore News-Post'' became the ''Baltimore News-American''.\n\nIn 1953 Hearst Magazines bought ''[[Sports Afield]]'' magazine, which it published until 1999 when it sold the journal to [[Robert E. Petersen]]. In 1958, Hearst's International News Service merged with E.W. Scripps' [[United Press]], forming [[United Press International]] as a response to the growth of the [[Associated Press]] and [[Reuters]]. The following year Scripps-Howard's ''San Francisco News'' merged with Hearst's afternoon ''San Francisco Call-Bulletin''. Also in 1959, Hearst acquired the paperback book publisher [[Avon (publisher)|Avon Books]].<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,864911,00.html| title=Quiet Deal| magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date=August 31, 1959| subscription=yes}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, the Hearst Corporation began pursuing [[Joint Operating Agreement]]s (JOA's).  It reached the first agreement with the DeYoung family, proprietors of the afternoon ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', which began to produce a joint Sunday edition with the ''Examiner''.  In turn, the ''Examiner'' became an evening publication, absorbing the ''[[The San Francisco Call|News-Call-Bulletin]]''. The following year, the ''Journal-American'' reached another JOA with another two landmark New York City papers: the ''[[New York Herald Tribune|Herald-Tribune]]'' and [[Scripps-Howard]]'s ''[[New York World-Telegram|World-Telegram and Sun]]'' to form the ''[[New York World Journal Tribune]]'' (recalling the names of the city's mid-market dailies), which collapsed after only a few months.\n\nThe 1962 merger of the ''Herald-Express'' and ''Examiner'' in Los Angeles led to the termination of many journalists who began to stage a 10-year strike in 1967.

He first rose to prominence with the publication of ''[[Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs|Hell's Angels]]'' (1967), a book for which he spent a year living and riding with the [[Hells Angels]] motorcycle gang in order to write a first-hand account of lives and experiences of its members.\n\nIn 1970 he wrote an unconventional magazine feature entitled ''[[The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved]]'' for [[Scanlan's Monthly]] which both raised his profile and established him as a writer with [[counter-culture]] credibility. It also set him on a path to establishing his own sub-genre of [[New Journalism]] which he called \"Gonzo,\" which was essentially an ongoing experiment in which the writer becomes a central figure and even a participant in the events of the narrative.\n\nThompson remains best known for ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1971), a book first serialized in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in which he grapples with the implications of what he considered the failure of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]] movement. It was adapted on film twice: loosely in ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]'' starring [[Bill Murray]] as Thompson in 1980, and directly in 1998 by director [[Terry Gilliam]] in a [[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|film]] starring [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Benicio del Toro]].  The Doonesbury cartoon character Duke \u2013 who was modeled after Thompson \u2013 pens an essay about \"my shoplifting conviction\" entitled \"Fear and Loathing at Macy's Menswear\", a reference to Thompson's book.\n\nPolitically minded, Thompson ran unsuccessfully for [[sheriff]] of [[Pitkin County, Colorado]] in 1970 on the Freak Power ticket. He became well-known for his dislike of [[Richard Nixon]], whom he claimed represented \"that dark, venal, and incurably violent side of the American character\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Obituary: Hunter S Thompson|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4283349.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=August 3, 2012|date=February 21, 2005}}</ref> He covered Nixon's [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 reelection campaign]] for Rolling Stone and later collected the stories in book form as ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72]]''.\n\nThompson's output notably declined from the mid-1970s, as he struggled with the consequences of fame, and he complained that he could no longer merely report on events as he was too easily recognized. He was also known for his lifelong use of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and illegal narcotics, his love of [[firearm]]s, and his [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] contempt for [[authoritarianism]]. He often remarked: \"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me.\"\n\nThompson died by suicide at the age of 67, following a series of health problems. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were fired out of a cannon in a ceremony funded by his friend [[Johnny Depp]] and attended by friends including then-Senator [[John Kerry]] and [[Jack Nicholson]].

As sports editor, Thompson traveled around the United States with the Eglin Eagles [[American football|football]] team, covering its games. In early 1957 he wrote a sports column for ''[[Northwest Florida Daily News|The Playground News]]'', a local newspaper in [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida]].

Thompson applied for a job with the Puerto Rican English-language daily ''[[The San Juan Star]]'', but its managing editor, future novelist [[William J. Kennedy]], turned him down.

While there, he published his first magazine feature in the nationally distributed ''[[Rogue (magazine)|Rogue]]'' magazine, on the [[artisan]] and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] culture of Big Sur. Thompson had had a rocky tenure as caretaker of the hot springs, and his unflattering portrayal of Big Sur was not well-received by the residents. His over-the-top antics were finally too much for  Vinnie MacDonald Murphy, the owner of Slates Hot Springs.

He criticized San Francisco's [[Hippie movement|Hippies]] as devoid of both the political convictions of the [[New Left]] and the artistic core of the [[beat generation|Beats]], resulting in a culture overrun with young people who spent their time in the pursuit of [[Psychedelic drug|drugs]]. \"The thrust is no longer for 'change' or 'progress' or 'revolution' but merely to escape, to live on the far perimeter of a world that might have been \u2014 perhaps should have been \u2014 and strike a bargain for survival on purely personal terms,\" he wrote.<ref name=\"hashbury\">{{cite news |last=Thompson|first=Hunter|title=\"\"The Hashbury is the Capital of the Hippies\"|work=The New York Times Magazine|date=1967-05-14|page=29}}</ref>\n\nBy late 1967, Thompson and his family moved back to Colorado and rented a house in [[Woody Creek, Colorado|Woody Creek]], a small mountain hamlet outside Aspen. In early 1969, Thompson received a $15,000 royalty check for the paperback sales of ''Hell's Angels'' and used two-thirds of the money for a [[down payment]] on a modest home and property where he would live for the rest of his life.<ref>{{cite book | last=Thompson | first=Hunter | year=2006 | title= Fear and Loathing in America | edition=Paperback | publisher=Simon & Schuster | isbn=978-0-684-87316-9 | page = 784}}</ref> He named the house Owl Farm and often described it as his \"fortified compound.\"\n\nIn early 1968, Thompson signed the \"[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.<ref>\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\", ''New York Post'', January 30, 1968.</ref> According to Thompson's letters and his later writings, at this time he planned to write a book called ''The Joint Chiefs'' about \"the death of the [[American Dream]].\" He used a $6,000 advance from [[Random House]] to travel the 1968 Presidential campaign trail and attend the [[1968 Democratic Convention]] in Chicago for research. From his hotel room in Chicago, Thompson watched the clashes between police and protesters, which he wrote had a great effect on his political views. The book was never finished, and the theme of the death of the American dream would be carried over into his later work.

The platform included promoting the [[Drug liberalization|decriminalization of drugs]] (for personal use only, not trafficking, as he disapproved of [[Profiteering (business)|profiteering]]), tearing up the streets and turning them into grassy [[pedestrian mall]]s, banning any building so tall as to obscure the view of the mountains, disarming all police forces, and renaming Aspen \"Fat City\" to deter investors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://71republic.com/2018/02/23/hunter-thompson-sheriff/|title=Hunter S.

Thompson (Candidate for Sheriff).\" Despite the publicity, Thompson narrowly lost the election. While carrying the city of Aspen, he garnered only 44% of the county-wide vote in what had become a two-way race. The Republican candidate agreed to withdraw a few days before the election in order to consolidate the anti-Thompson votes, in return for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] withdrawing their candidate for county commissioner. Thompson later remarked that the ''Rolling Stone'' article mobilized his opposition far more than his supporters.<ref>Hunter S. Thompson (2003), ''[[Kingdom of Fear (book)|Kingdom of Fear]]'', Simon & Schuster, p. 95.</ref>\n\n===Birth of Gonzo===\n{{Main|Gonzo journalism}}\nAlso in 1970, Thompson wrote an article entitled ''[[The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved]]'' for the short-lived [[new journalism]] magazine ''[[Scanlan's Monthly]]''. For that article, editor [[Warren Hinckle]] paired Thompson with illustrator [[Ralph Steadman]], who drew [[expressionism|expressionist]] illustrations with lipstick and eyeliner. Thompson and Steadman collaborated regularly after that. Although it was not widely read, the article was the first to use the techniques of [[Gonzo journalism]], a style Thompson would later employ in almost every literary endeavor. The manic [[First-person narrative|first-person]] subjectivity of the story was reportedly the result of sheer desperation; he was facing a looming deadline and started sending the magazine pages ripped out of his notebook.\n\nThe first use of the word \"Gonzo\" to describe Thompson's work is credited to the journalist [[Bill Cardoso]]. Cardoso first met Thompson on a bus full of journalists covering the [[New Hampshire primary#1968|1968 New Hampshire primary]]. In 1970, Cardoso (who was then the editor of ''[[The Boston Globe]] Sunday Magazine'') wrote to Thompson praising the ''Kentucky Derby'' piece as a breakthrough: \"This is it, this is pure Gonzo. If this is a start, keep rolling.\" According to Steadman, Thompson took to the word right away and said, \"Okay, that's what I do. Gonzo.\"<ref name=cardoso-obit>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Douglas|title=Bill Cardoso, 68, Editor Who Coined 'Gonzo', Is Dead|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/16/national/16cardoso.html?_r=1&ei=5088&en=c7b5fe5f62a5d95e&ex=1300165200&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print|accessdate=August 3, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 16, 2006}}</ref> Thompson's first published use of the word appears in ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'': \"Free Enterprise. The [[American Dream]]. [[Horatio Alger]] gone mad on drugs in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Do it ''now'': pure Gonzo journalism.\"\n\n===''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''===\n{{Main|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas}}\nThe book for which Thompson gained most of his fame had its genesis during the research for \"[[Strange Rumblings in Aztlan]]\", an expos\u00e9 for ''Rolling Stone'' on the 1970 killing of the [[Mexican American|Mexican-American]] television journalist [[Rub\u00e9n Salazar]]. Salazar had been shot in the head at close range with a tear gas canister fired by officers of the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] during the [[Chicano Moratorium|National Chicano Moratorium March]] against the [[Vietnam War]]. One of Thompson's sources for the story was [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]], a prominent Mexican-American activist and attorney. Finding it difficult to talk in the racially tense atmosphere of Los Angeles, Thompson and Acosta decided to travel to Las Vegas, and take advantage of an assignment by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' to write a 250-word photograph caption on the [[Mint 400]] motorcycle race held there.\n\nWhat was to be a short caption quickly grew into something else entirely. Thompson first submitted to ''Sports Illustrated'' a manuscript of 2,500 words, which was, as he later wrote, \"aggressively rejected.\" ''Rolling Stone'' publisher [[Jann Wenner]] was said to have liked \"the first 20 or so jangled pages enough to take it seriously on its own terms and tentatively scheduled it for publication&nbsp;\u2014 which gave me the push I needed to keep working on it\", Thompson later wrote.<ref>{{cite book | last=Thompson | first=Hunter | year=1979 | title= The Great Shark Hunt: Strange Tales from a Strange Time | edition=1st | publisher=[[Summit Books]] | isbn=0-671-40046-0 | pages = 105\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nThe result of the trip to Las Vegas became the 1972 book ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', which first appeared in the November 1971 issues of ''Rolling Stone'' as a two-part series. It is written as a first-person account by a journalist named [[Raoul Duke]] on a trip to Las Vegas with [[Oscar Zeta Acosta|Dr. Gonzo]], his \"300-pound [[Samoans|Samoan]] attorney\", to cover a [[Prohibition (drugs)|narcotics officers]]' convention and the \"fabulous Mint 400\". During the trip, Duke and his companion (always referred to as \"my attorney\") become sidetracked by a search for the [[American Dream]], with \"two bags of [[cannabis (drug)|grass]], seventy-five pellets of [[mescaline]], five sheets of high-powered [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|blotter acid]], a salt shaker half full of [[cocaine]], and a whole galaxy of multi-colored [[Amphetamine|uppers]], [[Barbiturates|downers]], [[Methamphetamine|screamers]], [[Nitrous Oxide|laughers]]&nbsp;... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw [[Diethyl ether|ether]], and two dozen [[amyl nitrite|amyls]].\"\n\nComing to terms with the failure of the 1960s [[counterculture|countercultural movement]] is a major theme of the novel, and the book was greeted with considerable critical acclaim, including being heralded by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as \"by far the best book yet written on the decade of dope\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Woods|first=Crawford|title='Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/23/books/thompson-1972-vegar.html|accessdate=August 3, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 23, 1972}}</ref> \"The Vegas Book\", as Thompson referred to it, was a mainstream success and introduced his Gonzo journalism techniques to a wide public.\n\n===''Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72''===\n{{Main|Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72}}\nBeginning in late 1971 Thompson wrote extensively for ''Rolling Stone'' on [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|election campaigns]] of President [[Richard Nixon]] and his unsuccessful opponent, Senator [[George McGovern]]. The articles were soon combined and published as ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72]]''. As the title suggests, Thompson spent nearly all of his time traveling the \"campaign trail\", focusing largely on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s primaries - Nixon, as the Republican incumbent, performed little campaign work - in which McGovern competed with rival candidates [[Edmund Muskie]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Thompson was an early supporter of McGovern and wrote unflattering coverage of the rival campaigns in the increasingly widely read ''Rolling Stone''.\n\nThompson went on to become a fierce critic of Nixon, both during and after his presidency. After Nixon's death in 1994, Thompson described him in ''Rolling Stone'' as a man who \"could shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time\" and said \"his casket [should] have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. [He] was an evil man\u2014evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the [[Devil]] can understand it.\"<ref>Thompson, Hunter S.

While ''The Washington Post'' was lamenting Nixon's \"lonely and depressed\" state after being forced from the White House, Hunter wrote that '[i]f there were any such thing as true justice in this world, his [Nixon's] rancid carcass would be somewhere down around Easter Island right now, in the belly of a hammerhead shark.'<ref>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Hunter S. |title=Fear and Loathing at Rolling Stone: The Essential Writings of Hunter S. Thompson |year=2011 |page=337}}</ref> There was however one passion shared by Thompson and Nixon: a love of football, discussed in ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72]]''.\n\n==Later years==\nThompson's journalistic work began to seriously suffer after his trip to Africa to cover \"[[The Rumble in the Jungle]]\"\u2014the world heavyweight boxing match between [[George Foreman]] and [[Muhammad Ali]]\u2014in 1974. He missed the match while intoxicated at his hotel, and did not submit a story to the magazine. As Wenner put it to the film critic Roger Ebert in the 2008 documentary ''Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson'', \"After Africa he just couldn't write. He couldn't piece it together\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/gonzo-the-life-and-work-of-dr-hunter-s-thompson-2008|accessdate=April 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPlans for Thompson to cover the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 presidential campaign]] for ''Rolling Stone'' and later publish a book fell through after Wenner canceled the project without informing Thompson.<ref name=\"interviews1976\"/> Wenner then assigned Thompson to travel to [[Vietnam]] to cover what appeared to be the end of the [[Vietnam War]]. Thompson arrived in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] just as [[Fall of Saigon|South Vietnam was collapsing]] and as other journalists were leaving the country. Again, Wenner pulled the plug on the project. The incidents strained Thompson's relationship with Wenner and ''Rolling Stone.''\n\nFrom the late 1970s on, most of Thompson's literary output appeared as a four-volume series of books entitled ''[[The Gonzo Papers]]''. Beginning with ''The Great Shark Hunt'' in 1979 and ending with ''[[Better Than Sex (book)|Better Than Sex]]'' in 1994, the series is largely a collection of rare newspaper and magazine pieces from the pre-gonzo period, along with almost all of his ''Rolling Stone'' pieces.\n\nStarting in about 1980, Thompson became more reclusive. He would often retreat to his compound in Woody Creek, rejecting projects assignments or failing to complete them. Despite a lack of new material, Wenner kept Thompson on the ''Rolling Stone'' [[masthead (publishing)|masthead]] as chief of the \"National Affairs Desk\", a position he would hold until his death.\n\nIn 1980 Thompson divorced wife Sandra Conklin. The same year marked the release of ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]'', a loose film adaptation based on Thompson's early 1970s work, starring [[Bill Murray]] as the writer. Murray eventually became one of Thompson's trusted friends. Later that year Thompson relocated to [[Hawaii]] to research and write, ''[[The Curse of Lono]]'', a Gonzo-style account of the 1980 [[Honolulu Marathon]]. Extensively illustrated by [[Ralph Steadman]], the piece first appeared in ''Running'' magazine in 1981 as \"The Charge of the Weird Brigade\" and was excerpted in 1983 ''[[Playboy]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gonzo.org/books/cl/ |title=The Great Thompson Hunt&nbsp;\u2014 Books&nbsp;\u2014 The Curse of Lono |publisher=Gonzo.org |date= |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, he covered the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of Grenada]] but didn't write or discuss the experiences until the publication of ''[[Kingdom of Fear (book)|Kingdom of Fear]]'' in 2003. Later that year, at the behest of [[Terry McDonell]], he wrote \"A Dog Took My Place,\" an expos\u00e9 for ''Rolling Stone'' of the scandalous [[Roxanne Pulitzer]] divorce case and what he called the \"[[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] lifestyle.\" The story included dubious insinuations of [[bestiality]] but was widely considered to be a return by Thompson to his proper form. In 1985 Thompson accepted an advance to write about \"couples pornography\" for ''Playboy''. As part of his research, he spent evenings at the [[Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre]] [[striptease club]] in San Francisco. The experience evolved into an as-yet-unpublished novel tentatively entitled ''The Night Manager.''\n\n[[File:Hst-by-rsexton-longbeach-5-1989-2.jpg|thumb|alt=Hunter S.

Rather than traveling the campaign trail as he had done in previous presidential elections, Thompson monitored the proceedings on cable television; ''Better Than Sex: Confessions of a Political Junkie'', his account of the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential]] campaign, is composed of reactive faxes to ''Rolling Stone''. In 1994, the magazine published \"He Was a Crook,\" a \"scathing\" obituary of Richard Nixon.<ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/07/he-was-a-crook/308699/</ref>\n\nIn November 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' published Thompson's final magazine feature \"The Fun-Hogs in the Passing Lane: Fear and Loathing, Campaign 2004\", a brief account of the 2004 presidential election in which he compared the outcome of the ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' court case to the [[Reichstag fire]] and formally endorsed [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]], a longtime friend, for president.\n\n===''Fear and Loathing'' redux===\nThompson's work gained renewed attention with the release of the film ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''. New editions of the book were published, introducing Thompson's work to a new generation of readers. The same year, an early novel ''[[The Rum Diary (novel)|The Rum Diary]]'' was published, as were the two volumes of collected letters.\n\nThompson's next, and penultimate, collection, ''[[Kingdom of Fear (book)|Kingdom of Fear: Loathsome Secrets of a Star-Crossed Child In the Final Days of the American Century]]'', was widely publicized as Thompson's first memoir. Published in 2003, it combined new material (including reminiscences of the O'Farrell Theater), selected newspaper and digital clippings, and other older works.\n\nThompson finished his journalism career in the same way it had begun: Writing about sports. From 2000 until his death in 2005, he wrote a weekly column for [[ESPN]].com's [[Page 2]] entitled \"Hey, Rube.\" In 2004 [[Simon & Schuster]] collected some of the columns from the first few years and released it in mid-2004 as ''[[Hey Rube (book)|Hey Rube: Blood Sport, the Bush Doctrine, and the Downward Spiral of Dumbness]]''.\n\nThompson married assistant Anita Bejmuk on April 23, 2003.\n\n==Death==\nAt 5:42&nbsp;p.m. on February 20, 2005, Thompson died from a [[suicide|self-inflicted]] gunshot wound to the head at Owl Farm, his \"fortified compound\" in [[Woody Creek, Colorado]]. His son Juan, daughter-in-law Jennifer, and grandson were visiting for the weekend. His wife Anita, who was at the Aspen Club, was on the phone with him as he cocked the gun. According to the ''Aspen Daily News'', Thompson asked her to come home to help him write his ESPN column, then set the receiver on the counter. Anita said she mistook the cocking of the gun for the sound of his typewriter keys and hung up as he fired. Will and Jennifer were in the next room when they heard the gunshot, but mistook the sound for a book falling and did not check on Thompson immediately. Juan Thompson found his father's body.

He was also upset over his advancing age and chronic medical problems, including a hip replacement; he would frequently mutter \"This kid is getting old.\" ''Rolling Stone'' published what Doug Brinkley described as a [[suicide note]] written by Thompson to his wife, titled \"Football Season Is Over\".

The plans for the monument were initially drawn by Thompson and Steadman, and were shown as part of an ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]'' program on the [[BBC]] titled ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Road to Hollywood|Fear and Loathing in Gonzovision]]'' (1978). It is included as a special feature on the second disc of the 2004 [[Criterion Collection]] DVD release of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', and labeled as ''Fear and Loathing on the Road to Hollywood''.\n\nAccording to his widow, Anita, the $3 million funeral was funded by actor [[Johnny Depp]], who was a close friend of Thompson. Depp told the ''[[Associated Press]]'', \"All I'm doing is trying to make sure his last wish comes true. I just want to send my pal out the way he wants to go out.\"<ref name=\"editorandpublisher1\"/> An estimated 280 people attended, including [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] John Kerry<ref name=\"Brooks\">Patricia Brooks, Jonathan Brooks, ''Laid to Rest in California: A Guide to the Cemeteries and Grave SItes of the Rich and Famous'' (2006), p. 321.</ref> and [[George McGovern]];<ref name=\"Brooks\"/> ''[[60 Minutes]]'' correspondents [[Ed Bradley]] and [[Charlie Rose]]; actors [[Jack Nicholson]], [[John Cusack]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Sean Penn]], and [[Josh Hartnett]]; musicians [[Lyle Lovett]], [[John Oates]] and [[David Amram]], and artist and long-time friend [[Ralph Steadman]].\n\n==Legacy==\n===Writing style===\n{{Main|Gonzo journalism}}\nThompson is often credited as the creator of Gonzo journalism, a style of writing that blurs distinctions between fiction and nonfiction. His work and style are considered to be a major part of the [[New Journalism]] literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which attempted to break free from the purely objective style of mainstream reportage of the time. Thompson almost always wrote in the [[first person narrative|first person]], while extensively using his own experiences and emotions to color \"the story\" he was trying to follow.\n\nDespite his having personally described his work as \"Gonzo\", it fell to later observers to articulate what the term actually meant. While Thompson's approach clearly involved injecting himself as a participant in the events of the narrative, it also involved adding invented, metaphoric elements, thus creating, for the uninitiated reader, a seemingly confusing amalgam of facts and fiction notable for the deliberately blurred lines between one and the other. Thompson, in a 1974 interview in ''[[Playboy]]'' addressed the issue himself, saying \"Unlike Tom Wolfe or Gay Talese, I almost never try to reconstruct a story. They're both much better reporters than I am, but then, I don't think of myself as a reporter.\" [[Tom Wolfe]] would later describe Thompson's style as \"...&nbsp;part journalism and part personal memoir admixed with powers of wild invention and wilder rhetoric.\"<ref name=\"wolfetom\">{{cite news|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|title=As Gonzo in Life as in His Work|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110006325|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050222142331/http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110006325 |archivedate=February 22, 2005|accessdate=August 3, 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=February 22, 2005}}</ref> Or as one description of the differences between Thompson and Wolfe's styles would elaborate, \"While Tom Wolfe mastered the technique of being a fly on the wall, Thompson mastered the art of being a [[fly in the ointment]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/9780345396358.html |title=Better Than Sex by Hunter S. Thompson \u2013 Trade Paperback |publisher=Random House |date=August 22, 1995 |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of Thompson's most popular and acclaimed work appeared within the pages of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine. Along with [[Joe Eszterhas]] and David Felton, Thompson was instrumental in expanding the focus of the magazine past music criticism; indeed, Thompson was the only staff writer of the epoch never to contribute a music feature to the magazine. Nevertheless, his articles were always peppered with a wide array of pop music references ranging from [[Howlin' Wolf]] to [[Lou Reed]]. Armed with early [[fax]] machines wherever he went, he became notorious for haphazardly sending sometimes illegible material to the magazine's San Francisco offices as an issue was about to go to press.\n\nRobert Love, Thompson's editor of 23 years at ''Rolling Stone'', wrote that \"the dividing line between fact and fancy rarely blurred, and we didn't always use italics or some other typographical device to indicate the lurch into the fabulous. But if there were living, identifiable humans in a scene, we took certain steps&nbsp;... Hunter was a close friend of many prominent Democrats, veterans of the ten or more presidential campaigns he covered, so when in doubt, we'd call the press secretary. 'People will believe almost any twisted kind of story about politicians or Washington,' he once said, and he was right.\"\n\nDiscerning the line between the fact and the fiction of Thompson's work presented a practical problem for editors and fact-checkers of his work. Love called fact-checking Thompson's work \"one of the sketchiest occupations ever created in the publishing world\", and \"for the first-timer&nbsp;... a trip through a journalistic fun house, where you didn't know what was real and what wasn't. You knew you had better learn enough about the subject at hand to know when the riff began and reality ended. Hunter was a stickler for numbers, for details like gross weight and model numbers, for lyrics and [[caliber]], and there was no faking it.\"<ref name=\"love-cjr\">Love, Robert.

Fantasizing about causing bodily harm to others was also a characteristic in his work used to comedic effect and an example of his brand of humor.\n\nIn the late sixties, Thompson acquired the [[Honorary degree|title of]] \"Doctor\" from the [[Universal Life Church]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universallifechurchministers.org/hunter-thompson/|title=Hunter Thompson|publisher=Universal Life Church|access-date=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nA number of critics have commented that as he grew older the line that distinguished Thompson from his literary self became increasingly blurred.<ref>{{cite news|author=Cohen, Rich|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/17/books/review/17COHENRE.html?pagewanted=print&position=|title=''Gonzo Nights''|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 17, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Hunter S.

Thompson bibliography}}\n\n===Books===\nThompson wrote a number of books, publishing from 1966 to the end of his life. His best-known works include ''[[Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs]]'', ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'', and ''[[The Rum Diary (novel)|The Rum Diary]]''.\n\n===Articles===\nAs a journalist over the course of decades, Thompson published numerous articles in various [[Periodical literature|periodicals]]. He wrote for many publications, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''[[The San Juan Star]]'', and ''[[Playboy]]''. He was also guest editor for a single edition of ''The Aspen Daily News''. A collection of 100 of his columns from ''The San Francisco Examiner'' was published in 1988 as ''[[Generation of Swine|Gonzo Papers, Vol. 2: Generation of Swine: Tales of Shame and Degradation in the '80s]]''. A collection of his articles for ''Rolling Stone'' was released in 2011 as ''[[Fear and Loathing at Rolling Stone|Fear and Loathing at Rolling Stone: The Essential Writings of Hunter S. Thompson]]''. The book was edited by the magazine's co-founder and publisher, Jann S. Wenner, who also provided an introduction to the collection.\n\n===Letters===\nThompson wrote many letters, which were his primary means of personal communication. He made [[carbon copy|carbon copies]] of all his letters, usually typed, a habit begun in his teenage years.\n\n''The Fear and Loathing Letters'' is a three-volume collection of selections from Thompson's correspondence, edited by the historian [[Douglas Brinkley]]. The first volume, ''The Proud Highway'' was published in 1997, and contains letters from 1955 to 1967. ''[[Fear and Loathing in America]]'' was published in 2000 and contains letters dating from 1968 to 1976. A third volume, titled ''The Mutineer: Rants, Ravings, and Missives from the Mountaintop 1977\u20132005'' was edited by Douglas Brinkley and published by Simon & Schuster in 2005. As of January 2018, it has yet to be sold to the public. It contains a special introduction by Johnny Depp.\n\n===Illustrations===\nAccompanying the eccentric and colorful writing of Hunter Thompson, illustrations by British artist [[Ralph Steadman]] offer visual representations of the Gonzo style. Steadman and Thompson developed a close friendship, and often traveled together. Though his illustrations occur in most of Thompson's books, they are conspicuously featured in full page color in Thompson's ''[[The Curse of Lono]]'', set in Hawaii.\n\n===Photography===\nThompson was an avid amateur photographer throughout his life and his photos have been exhibited since his death at art galleries in the United States and United Kingdom. In late 2006, AMMO Books published a limited-edition 224-page collection of Thompson photos called ''[[Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson|Gonzo]]'', with an introduction by Johnny Depp. Thompson's snapshots were a combination of the subjects he was covering, stylized self-portraits, and artistic [[still life]] photos. The ''[[London Observer]]'' called the photos \"astonishingly good\" and noted that \"Thompson's pictures remind us, brilliantly in every sense, of very real people, real colours.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ferguson|first=Euan|title=Hunter gets captured by the frame|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/feb/04/photography.features|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=August 3, 2012|date=February 3, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Feature films===\nThe film ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]'' (1980) depicts heavily fictionalized attempts by Thompson to cover the [[Super Bowl]] and the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 U.S. presidential election]]. It stars [[Bill Murray]] as Thompson and [[Peter Boyle]] as Thompson's attorney [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]], referred to in the movie as Carl Lazlo, Esq.\n\n[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|The 1998 film adaptation]] of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' was directed by [[Monty Python]] veteran [[Terry Gilliam]], and starred Johnny Depp (who moved into Thompson's basement to \"study\" Thompson's persona before assuming his role in the film) as [[Raoul Duke]] and [[Benicio del Toro]] as [[Oscar Zeta Acosta|Dr. Gonzo]]. The film has achieved something of a [[cult film|cult following]].\n\n[[The Rum Diary (film)|The film adaptation]] of Thompson's novel ''[[The Rum Diary (novel)|The Rum Diary]]'' was released in October 2011, also starring Johnny Depp as the main character, Paul Kemp. The novel's premise was inspired by Thompson's own experiences in Puerto Rico. The film was written and directed by [[Bruce Robinson]].\n\nAt a press junket for ''The Rum Diary'' shortly before the film's release, Depp said that he would like to adapt ''[[The Curse of Lono]]'', \"[[The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved]]\", and ''[[Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs|Hell's Angels]]'' for the big screen: \"I'd just keep playing Hunter.

It can be found on disc 2 of [[The Criterion Collection]] edition of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''.\n\nThe [[Mitchell brothers]], owners of the O'Farrell Theatre in San Francisco, made a documentary about Thompson in 1988 called ''Hunter S. Thompson: The Crazy Never Die''.\n\n[[Wayne Ewing]] created three documentaries about Thompson. The film ''[[Breakfast with Hunter]]'' (2003) was directed and edited by Ewing. It documents Thompson's work on the movie ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', his arrest for [[drunk driving]], and his subsequent fight with the court system. ''When I Die'' (2005) is a video chronicle of making Thompson's final farewell wishes a reality, and documents the send-off itself. ''Free Lisl: Fear and Loathing in Denver'' (2006) chronicles Thompson's efforts in helping to free Lisl Auman, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the shooting of a police officer, a crime she didn't commit.

Thompson on Film]]'' (2006) was directed by [[Tom Thurman]], written by Tom Marksbury, and produced by the [[Starz Entertainment Group]]. The original documentary features interviews with Thompson's inner circle of family and friends, but the thrust of the film focuses on the manner in which his life often overlapped with numerous Hollywood celebrities who became his close friends, such as Johnny Depp, [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Sean Penn]], [[John Cusack]], Thompson's wife Anita, son Juan, former Senators [[George McGovern]] and [[Gary Hart]], writers [[Tom Wolfe]] and [[William F. Buckley, Jr.|William F. Buckley]], actors [[Gary Busey]] and [[Harry Dean Stanton]], and the illustrator [[Ralph Steadman]] among others.\n\n''Blasted!!! The Gonzo Patriots of Hunter S. Thompson'' (2006), produced, directed, photographed and edited by Blue Kraning, is a documentary about the scores of fans who volunteered their privately owned artillery to fire the ashes of the late author, Hunter S. Thompson. ''Blasted!!!'' premiered at the 2006 Starz Denver International Film Festival, part of a tribute series to Hunter S. Thompson held at the Denver Press Club.\n\nIn 2008, [[Academy Award]]-winning documentarian [[Alex Gibney]] (''[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]'', ''[[Taxi to the Dark Side]]'') wrote and directed a documentary on Thompson, titled ''[[Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson]]''. The film premiered on January 20, 2008, at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. Gibney uses intimate, never-before-seen home videos, interviews with friends, enemies and lovers, and clips from films adapted from Thompson's material to document his turbulent life.\n\n===Theater===\nLou Stein's adaptation of \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" was performed at the Battersea theatre. Stein persuades London's 'Time Out' Magazine to put Thompson up for a fortnight, in exchange for him writing a cover story to publicize the play. Thompson doesn't write the story, but does rampage around London on Time Out's expense account.

Historicism tends to be [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] because it values cautious, rigorous, and contextualized interpretation of information; or [[relativism|relativist]], because it rejects notions of universal, fundamental and immutable interpretations.<ref>Kahan, Jeffrey. \"Historicism.\" ''Renaissance Quarterly'', vol. 50, no. 4 December 22, 1997, p. 1202</ref> The approach varies from individualist theories of knowledge such as [[empiricism]] and [[rationalism]], which neglect the role of [[tradition]]s.\n\nThe term \"historicism\" (''Historismus'') was coined by German philosopher [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]].<ref>Brian Leiter, Michael Rosen (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 175: \"[The word 'historicism'] appears as early as the late eighteenth century in the writings of the German romantics, who used it in a neutral sense. In 1797 Friedrich Schlegel used 'historicism' to refer to a philosophy that stresses the importance of history...\"; Katherine Harloe, Neville Morley (eds.), ''Thucydides and the Modern World: Reception, Reinterpretation and Influence from the Renaissance to the Present'', Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 81: \"Already in   Friedrich Schlegel's ''Fragments about Poetry and Literature'' (a collection of notes attributed to 1797), the word ''Historismus'' occurs five times.\"</ref> Over time it has developed different and somewhat divergent meanings. Elements of historicism appear in the writings of French essayist [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533\u20131592) and Italian philosopher [[G. B. Vico]] (1668\u20131744), and became more fully developed with the [[dialectic]] of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Georg Hegel]] (1770\u20131831), influential in 19th-century Europe. The writings of [[Karl Marx]], influenced by Hegel, also include historicism. The term is also associated with the empirical social sciences and with the work of [[Franz Boas]].\n\nHistoricism may be contrasted with [[reductionism|reductionist]] theories\u2014which assumes that all developments can be explained by fundamental principles (such as in [[economic determinism]])\u2014or with theories that posit that historical changes occur as a result of random chance.\n\nThe Austrian-English philosopher [[Karl Popper]] condemned historicism along with the [[determinism]] and [[holism]] which he argued formed its basis. In his ''[[Poverty of Historicism]]'', he identified historicism with the opinion that there are \"inexorable laws of historical destiny\", which opinion he warned against. This contrasts with the contextually relative interpretation of historicism for which its proponents argue. [[Talcott Parsons]] criticized historicism as a case of idealistic fallacy in ''The Structure of Social Action'' (1937).\n\n[[Post-structuralism]] uses the term \"[[New Historicism]]\", which has some associations with both anthropology and Hegelianism.\n\nThe [[#Christian historicism|theological use]] of the word denotes the interpretation of biblical prophecy as being related to church history.\n\n==Variants==\n\n===Hegelian===\n[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|right|thumb|G. W. F. Hegel (1770\u20131831)]]\n\nHegel viewed the realization of human freedom as the ultimate purpose of history, which could only be achieved through the creation of the perfect state. And this progressive history would only occur through a dialectical process: namely, the tension between the purpose of humankind (freedom), the position that humankind currently finds itself, and mankind's attempt to bend the current world into accord with its nature. However, because humans are often not aware of the goal of both humanity and history, the process of achieving freedom is necessarily one of self-discovery. Hegel also saw the progress toward freedom being conducted by the \"spirit\" (Geist), a seemingly supernatural force that directed all human actions and interactions. Yet Hegel makes clear that the spirit is a mere abstraction, and only comes into existence \"through the activity of finite agents.\" Thus, Hegel's philosophy of history is not necessarily metaphysical, despite the fact that many of Hegel's opponents and interpreters have understood Hegel's philosophy of history as a metaphysical and determinist view of history.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Cambridge University PRess|year=1993|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=289\u201391}}</ref> For example, Karl Popper in his book ''The Poverty of Historicism'' interpreted Hegel's philosophy of history as metaphysical and deterministic. Popper referred to this \"Hegelian\" philosophy of history as ''Historicism''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Poverty of Historicism|last=Popper|first=Karl Popper|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1957|isbn=|location=London|page=4}}</ref>\n\nHegel's historicism also suggests that any human [[society]] and all human activities such as [[science]], [[art]], or [[philosophy]], are defined by their history. Consequently, their essence can be sought only by understanding said history. The history of any such human endeavor, moreover, not only continues but also reacts against what has gone before; this is the source of Hegel's famous dialectic teaching usually summarized by the slogan \"[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis, antithesis, and synthesis]]\".  (Hegel did not use these terms, although [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johann Fichte]] did.) Hegel's famous [[aphorism]], \"Philosophy is the history of philosophy,\" describes it bluntly.\n\nHegel's position is perhaps best illuminated when contrasted against the atomistic and reductionist opinion of human societies and social activities self-defining on an ''ad hoc'' basis through the sum of dozens of interactions. Yet another contrasting model is the persistent metaphor of a [[social contract]].  Hegel considers the relationship between individuals and societies as organic, not atomic: even their social discourse is mediated by [[philosophy of language|language]], and language is based on [[etymology]] and unique character. It thus preserves the culture of the past in thousands of half-forgotten [[metaphor]]s.  To understand why a person is the way he is, you must examine that person in his society: and to understand that society, you must understand its history, and the forces that influenced it.  The ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', the \"Spirit of the Age,\" is the concrete embodiment of the most important factors that are acting in human history at any given time. This contrasts with teleological theories of activity, which suppose that the end is the determining factor of activity, as well as those who believe in a [[tabula rasa]], or blank slate, opinion, such that individuals are defined by their interactions.\n\nThese ideas can be interpreted variously.  The [[Right Hegelians]], working from Hegel's opinions about the organicism and historically determined nature of human societies, interpreted Hegel's historicism as a justification of the unique destiny of national groups and the importance of stability and institutions.  Hegel's conception of human societies as entities greater than the individuals who constitute them influenced nineteenth-century [[romantic nationalism]] and its twentieth-century excesses.  The [[Young Hegelians]], by contrast, interpreted Hegel's thoughts on societies influenced by social conflict for a doctrine of [[social progress]], and attempted to manipulate these forces to cause various  results.  Karl Marx's doctrine of \"historical inevitabilities\" and [[historical materialism]] is one of the more influential reactions to this part of Hegel's thought.  Significantly, Karl Marx's [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]] argues that [[capitalism]] disrupts traditional relationships between workers and their work.\n\nHegelian historicism is related to his ideas on the means by which human societies progress, specifically the [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic]] and his conception of logic as representing the inner essential nature of reality. Hegel attributes the change to the \"modern\" need to interact with the world, whereas ancient philosophers were self-contained, and medieval philosophers were monks. In his History of Philosophy Hegel writes:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn modern times things are very different; now we no longer see philosophic individuals who constitute a class by themselves. With the present day all difference has disappeared; philosophers are not monks, for we find them generally in connection with the world, participating with others in some common work or calling. They live, not independently, but in the relation of citizens, or they occupy public offices and take part in the life of the state. Certainly they may be private persons, but if so, their position as such does not in any way isolate them from their other relationship. They are involved in present conditions, in the world and its work and progress. Thus their philosophy is only by the way, a sort of luxury and superfluity. This difference is really to be found in the manner in which outward conditions have taken shape after the building up of the inward world of religion. In modern times, namely, on account of the reconciliation of the worldly principle with itself, the external world is at rest, is brought into order \u2014 worldly relationships, conditions, modes of life, have become constituted and organized in a manner which is conformable to nature and rational. We see a universal, comprehensible connection, and with that individuality likewise attains another character and nature, for it is no longer the plastic individuality of the ancients. This connection is of such power that every individuality is under its dominion, and yet at the same time can construct for itself an inward world.<ref name=LecturesOnTheHistoryOfPhilosophyVolume3>[https://books.google.com/books/about/Lectures_on_the_History_of_Philosophy.html?id=ik05WhN4ga0C&pg=PA167#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Volume 3\"], By Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Translated by E. S. Haldane and Frances H. Simson, M. A., ''University of Nebraska Press'', 1995</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThis opinion that entanglement in society creates an indissoluble bond with expression, would become an influential question in philosophy, namely, the requirements for individuality.  It would be considered by [[Nietzsche]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Michel Foucault]] directly, as well as in the work of numerous artists and authors. There have been various responses to Hegel's challenge. The Romantic period emphasized the ability of individual genius to transcend time and place, and use the materials from their heritage to fashion works which were beyond determination. The modern would advance versions of John Locke's infinite malleability of the human animal. Post-structuralism would argue that since history is not present, but only the image of history, that while an individual era or power structure might emphasize a particular history, that the contradictions within the story would hinder the very purposes that the history was constructed to advance.\n\n===Anthropological<!--'Anthropological historicism'-->===\nIn the context of [[anthropology]] and other sciences which study the past, historicism has a different meaning. '''Anthropological historicism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--><ref>Byron Kaldis (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Social Sciences'', SAGE Publications, 2013, p. 421.</ref> is associated with the work of [[Franz Boas]]. His theory used the [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusionist]] concept that there were a few \"cradles of civilization\" which grew outwards, and merged it with the idea that societies would adapt to their circumstances, which is called [[historical particularism]]. The school of historicism grew in response to [[Classical social evolutionism|unilinear theories]] that social development represented adaptive fitness, and therefore existed on a continuum. While these theories were espoused by [[Charles Darwin]] and many of his students, their application as applied in [[social Darwinism]] and [[general evolution]] characterized in the theories of [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Leslie White]], historicism was neither anti-selection, nor anti-evolution, as Darwin never attempted nor offered an explanation for cultural evolution. However, it attacked the notion that there was one normative spectrum of development, instead emphasizing how local conditions would create adaptations to the local environment. [[Julian Steward]] refuted the viability of globally and universally applicable adaptive standards proposing that culture was honed adaptively in response to the idiosyncrasies of the local environment, the [[cultural ecology]], by [[specific evolution]]. What was adaptive for one region might not be so for another. This conclusion has likewise been adopted by modern forms of biological evolutionary theory.\n\nThe primary method of historicism was empirical, namely that there were so many requisite inputs into a society or event, that only by emphasizing the data available could a theory of the source be determined. In this opinion, grand theories are unprovable, and instead intensive field work would determine the most likely explanation and history of a culture, and hence it is named \"historicism.\"\n\nThis opinion would produce a wide range of definition of what, exactly, constituted culture and history, but in each case the only means of explaining it was in terms of the historical particulars of the culture itself.\n\n===New===\n{{main|New Historicism}}\nSince the 1950s, when [[Jacques Lacan]] and Foucault argued that each epoch has its own knowledge system, within which individuals are inexorably entangled, many [[post-structuralist]]s have used ''historicism'' to describe the opinion that all questions must be settled within the cultural and social context in which they are raised. Answers cannot be found by appeal to an external truth, but only within the confines of the norms and forms that phrase the question.  This version of historicism holds that there are only the raw texts, markings and artifacts that exist in the present, and the conventions used to decode them. This school of thought is sometimes given the name of ''New Historicism''.\n\nThe same term, ''new historicism'' is also used for a school of literary scholarship which interprets a [[poem]], [[drama]], etc. as an expression of or reaction to the power-structures of its society. [[Stephen Greenblatt]] is an example of this school.\n\n===Modern===\nWithin the context of 20th-century philosophy, debates continue as to whether ahistorical and immanent methods were sufficient to understand meaning\u2014that is to say, \"what you see is what you get\" positivism\u2014or whether context, background and culture are important beyond the mere need to decode words, phrases and references. While post-structural historicism is relativist in its orientation, that is, it sees each culture as its own frame of reference, a large number of thinkers have embraced the need for historical context, not because culture is self-referential, but because there is no more compressed means of conveying all of the relevant information except through history. This opinion is often seen as deriving from the work of [[Benedetto Croce]]. Recent historians using this tradition include [[Thomas Kuhn]].\n\n===Christian===\n{{main|Historicism (Christian eschatology)}}\n\n====Eschatological====\nIn [[Christianity]], the term ''historicism'' refers to the confessional [[Protestantism|Protestant]] form of prophetical interpretation which holds that the fulfillment of [[Bible|biblical]] [[prophecy]] has occurred throughout history and continues to occur; as opposed to other methods which limit the time-frame of prophecy-fulfillment to the past or to the future.\n\n====Dogmatic and ecclesiastic====\nThere is also a particular opinion in [[ecclesiastical history]] and in the [[History of Catholic dogmatic theology|history of dogmas]] which has been described as historicist by Pope [[Pius XII]] in the encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]''. \"They add that the history of dogmas consists in the reporting of the various forms in which revealed truth has been clothed, forms that have succeeded one another in accordance with the different teachings and opinions that have arisen over the course of the centuries.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Pius XII |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |title=Humani generis, 15 |publisher=[[Vatican.va]] |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419021937/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |archivedate=2012-04-19 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Critics==\n\n===Karl Marx===\nThe social theory of Karl Marx, with respect to modern scholarship, has an ambiguous relation to historicism. Critics of Marx have charged his theory with historicism since its very genesis. However, the issue of historicism also finds itself important to many debates within Marxism itself; the charge of historicism has been made against various types of Marxism, typically disparaged by Marxists as \"vulgar\" Marxism.\n\nMarx himself expresses critical concerns with this historicist tendency in his [[Theses on Feuerbach]]:\n{{quote|The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of changed circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated. Hence this doctrine is bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society. The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-change [Selbstver\u00e4nderung] can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionary [[praxis (process)|practice]].<ref name=\"Theses on Feuerbach\">{{cite web| url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm | title = Theses on Feuerbach | work = | publisher = | accessdate = February 20, 2009 }}</ref>}}\n\n===Karl Popper===\n\n[[Karl Popper]] used the term ''historicism'' in his influential books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', to mean: \"an approach to the social sciences which assumes that ''historical prediction'' is their primary aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the 'rhythms' or the 'patterns', the 'laws' or the 'trends' that underlie the evolution of history\".<ref name = \"Poverty 3\">POPPER, Karl, p. 3 of ''The Poverty of Historicism'', italics in original</ref> Karl Popper wrote with reference to [[Hegel]]'s theory of [[history]], which he criticized extensively. However, there is wide dispute whether Popper's description of \"historicism\" is an accurate description of Hegel, or more his characterisation of his own philosophical antagonists, including [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] thought, then widely held as posing a challenge to the philosophical basis of the [[Western world|West]], as well as theories such as [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] which drew predictions about the future course of events from the past.\n\nIn ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Popper attacks \"historicism\" and its proponents, among whom (as well as Hegel) he identifies and singles out [[Plato]] and [[Marx]]\u2014calling them all \"enemies of the open society\".  The objection he makes is that historicist positions, by claiming that there is an inevitable and deterministic pattern to history, abrogate the [[democracy|democratic]] responsibility of each one of us to make our own free contributions to the evolution of society, and hence lead to [[totalitarianism]].\n\nAnother of his targets is what he terms \"moral historicism\", the attempt to infer moral values from the course of history; in Hegel's words, that \"history is the world's court of justice\".  This may take the form of conservatism (former might is right), positivism (might is right) or futurism (presumed coming might is right). As against these, Popper says that he does not believe \"that success proves anything or that history is our judge\".<ref>''The Open Society and its Enemies'', vol. 2 p. 29.</ref> Futurism must be distinguished from prophecies that the right will prevail: these attempt to infer history from ethics, rather than ethics from history, and are therefore historicism in the normal sense rather than moral historicism.\n\nHe also attacks what he calls \"[[Historism]]\", which he regards as distinct from historicism.  By historism, he means the tendency to regard every argument or idea as completely accounted for by its historical context, as opposed to assessing it by its merits.  In Popperian terms, the \"[[New Historicism]]\" is an example of historism rather than of historicism proper.\n\n===Leo Strauss===\n[[Leo Strauss]] used the term ''historicism'' and reportedly termed it the single greatest threat to intellectual freedom insofar as it denies any attempt to address injustice-pure-and-simple (such is the significance of historicism's rejection of \"natural right\" or \"right by nature\").  Strauss argued that historicism \"rejects political philosophy\" (insofar as this stands or falls by questions of permanent, trans-historical significance) and is based on the belief that \"all human thought, including scientific thought, rests on premises which cannot be validated by human reason and which came from historical epoch to historical epoch.\" Strauss further identified [[R. G. Collingwood]] as the most coherent advocate of historicism in the English language.  Countering Collingwood's arguments, Strauss warned against historicist social scientists' failure to address real-life problems\u2014most notably that of tyranny\u2014to the extent that they relativize (or \"subjectivize\") all ethical problems by placing their significance strictly in function of particular or ever-changing socio-material conditions devoid of inherent or \"objective\" \"value.\" Similarly, Strauss criticized [[Eric Voegelin]]'s abandonment of ancient political thought as guide or vehicle in interpreting modern political problems.\n\nIn his books, ''[[Natural Right and History]]'' and ''[[On Tyranny]]'', Strauss offers a complete critique of historicism as it emerges in the works of Hegel, Marx, and [[Heidegger]]. Many believe that Strauss also found historicism in [[Edmund Burke]], [[Tocqueville]], [[Augustine]], and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Although it is largely disputed whether Strauss himself was a historicist, he often indicated that historicism grew out of and against Christianity and was a threat to civic participation, belief in human agency, religious pluralism, and, most controversially, an accurate understanding of the classical philosophers and religious prophets themselves. Throughout his work, he warns that historicism, and the understanding of [[Progress (history)|progress]] that results from it, expose us to [[tyranny]], totalitarianism, and [[Ochlocracy|democratic extremism]]. In his exchange with [[Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve]] in ''On Tyranny'', Strauss seems to blame historicism for [[Nazism]] and [[Communism]]. In a collection of his works by Kenneth Hart entitled ''[[Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity]]'',  he argues that [[Islam]], traditional [[Judaism]], and ancient Greece, share a concern for sacred law that makes them especially susceptible to historicism, and therefore to tyranny.  Strauss makes use of Nietzsche's own critique of progress and historicism, although Strauss refers to Nietzsche himself (no less than to Heidegger) as a \"radical historicist\" who articulated a philosophical (if only untenable) justification for historicism.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Parametric determinism]]\n* [[Path dependence]]\n* [[Sociocultural evolution]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Franz Boas]], ''[[The Mind of Primitive Man]]''.\n* [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], ''[[Truth and Method]]''.\n* [[G.

Rockwood]]]]\n\n===Founding===\n\nHunter College has its origins in the 19th-century movement for [[normal school]] training which swept across the [[United States]]. Hunter descends from the Female Normal and High School (later renamed the Normal College of the City of New York), established in [[New York City]] in 1870. Founded by Irish immigrant [[Thomas Hunter (school founder)|Thomas Hunter]], who was president of the school during the first 37 years, it was originally a [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]] for training teachers. The school, which was housed in an armory and saddle store at Broadway and East Fourth Street in Manhattan, was open to all qualified women, irrespective of race, religion or ethnic background.  At the time most women's colleges had racial or ethno-religious admissions criteria.\n\nCreated by the New York State Legislature, Hunter was deemed the only approved institution for those seeking to teach in New York City. The school incorporated an elementary and high school for [[gifted children]], where students practiced teaching. In 1887, a [[kindergarten]] was established as well. (Today, the [[Hunter College Elementary School|elementary school]] and the [[Hunter College High School|high school]] still exist at a different location, and are now called the Hunter College Campus Schools.)\n\n[[File:Helen Campbell studying radio science at Hunter College LC-DIG-ggbain-24344.tif|thumb|left|200px|Student Helen Campbell studying radio science in a program started at Hunter College in 1917 by the [[National League for Women's Service]] to train female radio operators during [[World War I]].]]\n\nDuring Thomas Hunter's tenure as president of the school, Hunter became known for its impartiality regarding race, religion, ethnicity, financial or political favoritism; its pursuit of higher education for women; its high entry requirements; and its rigorous academics. The first female professor at the school, [[Helen Gray Cone]], was elected to the position in 1899.<ref>{{cite news|title=Young Women Graduated|date=June 23, 1899|work=New York Times|publisher=Proquest}}</ref>  The college's student population quickly expanded, and the college subsequently moved uptown, in 1873, into a new [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] structure, now known as Thomas Hunter Hall, on Lexington Avenue between 68th and 69th Streets. The hall was probably designed by the architect Snyder.\n\nIn 1888 the school was incorporated as a college under the statutes of New York State, with the power to confer the degree of [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] This led to the separation of the school into two \"camps\": the \"Normals\", who pursued a four-year course of study to become licensed teachers, and the \"Academics\", who sought non-teaching professions and the Bachelor of Arts degree. After 1902 when the \"Normal\" course of study was abolished, the \"Academic\" course became standard across the student body.\n\n===Expansion===\nIn 1914 the Normal College became Hunter College in honor of its first president. At the same time, the college was experiencing a period of great expansion as increasing student enrollments necessitated more space. The college reacted by establishing branches in the boroughs of [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], and [[Staten Island]]. By 1920, Hunter College had the largest enrollment of women of any municipally financed college in the United States. In 1930, Hunter's Brooklyn campus merged with [[City College of New York|City College]]'s Brooklyn campus, and the two were spun off to form [[Brooklyn College]].\n\n[[File:Hunter College NY WAVES camp opening 1943.JPG|thumb|right|287px|Opening of the [[United States Navy|Navy]] recruit camp for [[Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service|WAVES]] at Bronx Campus, February 8, 1943]]\n\nBetween 1938 and 1939 the garden at Park Avenue was given up for the construction of the north building. The expansion also destroyed a large part of the neo-gothic original structure, fusing them together. Only the back part facing Lexington Avenue between 68th and 69th street remain from the original building.\n\nThe late 1930s saw the construction of Hunter College in the Bronx (later known as the Bronx Campus). During the [[Second World War]], Hunter leased the Bronx Campus buildings to the [[United States Navy]] who used the facilities to train 95,000 women volunteers for military service as [[WAVES]] and [[SPARS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/extContent/usmc/pcn-190-003129-00/sec4.htm |title=Free A Marine to Fight: Women Marines in World War II (Early Training: Holyoke and Hunter) |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}</ref> When the Navy vacated the campus, the site was briefly occupied by the nascent [[United Nations]], which held its first Security Council sessions at the Bronx Campus in 1946, giving the school an international profile.<ref>[http://www.lehman.edu/lehman/programs/grad/187.htm History of Lehman College] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830080929/http://www.lehman.edu/lehman/programs/grad/187.htm |date=August 30, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1943, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] dedicated a town house at 47\u201349 East 65th Street in Manhattan to the college. The house had been a home for the future [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President]] and First Lady. Today it is known as The Roosevelt House of Public Policy and opened in fall 2010 as an academic center hosting prominent speakers.\n\n[[File:West Building Hunter College CUNY.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The West (seen here in the background) and East Buildings were constructed in 1981-86 &ndash; held up by the city's fiscal crisis &ndash; and were designed in the [[Modernist architecture|Modernist style]] by [[Ulrich Franzen]] & Associates; skyways connect all the buildings]]\n\n===CUNY era===\n\nHunter became the [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]] of the municipal system, and in the 1950s, when [[City College of New York|City College]] became [[coeducational]], Hunter started admitting men to its [[Bronx]] campus. In 1964, the [[Manhattan]] campus began admitting men also. The Bronx campus subsequently became [[Lehman College]] in 1968.\n\nIn 1968\u20131969, Black and Puerto Rican students struggled to get a department that would teach about their history and experience. These and supportive students and faculty expressed this demand through building take-overs, rallies, etc. In Spring 1969, Hunter College established Black and Puerto Rican Studies (now called Africana/Puerto Rican and Latino Studies). An \"[[open admissions]]\" policy initiated in 1970 by the City University of New York opened the school's doors to historically underrepresented groups by guaranteeing a college education to any and all who graduated from NYC high schools. Many African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, Puerto Ricans, and students from the developing world made their presence felt at Hunter, and even after the end of \"open admissions\" still comprise a large part of the school's student body. As a result of this increase in enrollment, Hunter opened new buildings on Lexington Avenue during the early 1980s. In further advancing Puerto Rican studies, Hunter became home to the [[Centro de Estudios Puertorrique\u00f1os]] (\"Center for Puerto Rican Studies\" or simply \"Centro\") in 1982.\n\nToday, Hunter College is a comprehensive teaching and research institution. Of the more than 20,000 students enrolled at Hunter, nearly 5,000 are enrolled in a graduate program, the most popular of which are education and [[social work]]. Although less than 28% of students are the first in their families to attend college, the college maintains its tradition of concern for women's education, with nearly three out of four students being female. In 2006, Hunter became home to the [[Bella Abzug]] Leadership Institute, which will run training programs for young women to build their leadership, public speaking, business and advocacy skills. [[Princeton Review]] named the college as [http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/news/#bestvalue one of America's \"Best Value\" Colleges] in its 2007 guide.\n\nIn recent years, the college has integrated its undergraduate and graduate programs to successfully make advanced programs in fields such as ([[Psychology]] and [[Biology]]) \u2013 \"Ph.D Program\", ([[Education]]) \u2013 \"Master's Program\", ([[Mathematics]]) \u2013 \"Master's Program\", -\"Ph.D Program\" ([[Biology]] & [[Chemistry]]) \u2013 \"[[Biochemistry]]\", ([[Accounting]]) \u2013 \"Master's Program\" along with the highly competitive ([[Economics]]) \u2013 \"Master's Program\" to which only a select few students may enter based on excellent scholarship and performance, and less than half will earn a master's degree by maintaining a nearly perfect academic record and performing thesis research.\n\nAlthough far from the polar regions, Hunter is a member institution of the [[University of the Arctic]], a network of schools providing education accessible to northern students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uarctic.org/orgs2full.aspx?group=GOvCouncil&title=Council&m=79|title=University of the Arctic \u2013 MEMBERS \u2013 LIST OF MEMBERS|publisher=|accessdate=October 9, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707084534/http://www.uarctic.org/orgs2full.aspx?group=GOvCouncil&title=Council&m=79|archivedate=July 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\n\n[[File:Hunter College.jpg|thumb|right|215px|North Building at Park Avenue (2010)]]\n[[File:Hunter College bridge.jpg|thumb|215px|right|View of the bridges between the East and West Buildings, the subway entrance, and Tony Smith's ''Tau'']]\n\n===Main Campus===\n\nHunter College is anchored by its main campus at East 68th Street and Lexington Avenue, a modern complex of three towers \u2014 the East, West, and North Buildings \u2014 and Thomas Hunter Hall, all of which are interconnected by skywalks.

Born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], Shearer began his career as a child actor. From 1969 to 1976, Shearer was a member of [[The Credibility Gap]], a radio comedy group. Following the breakup of the group, Shearer co-wrote the film ''[[Real Life (1979 film)|Real Life]]'' with [[Albert Brooks]] and started writing for [[Martin Mull]]'s television series ''[[Fernwood 2 Night]]''.\n\nShearer was a cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' between 1979 and 1980, and 1984 and 1985. Shearer co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in the 1984 film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', a [[satire|satirical]] [[rockumentary]], which became a cult hit. In 1989, he joined the cast of the animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]''; he provides voices for characters including [[Mr. Burns]], [[Waylon Smithers]], [[Principal Skinner]], [[Ned Flanders]], [[Reverend Lovejoy]], [[Kent Brockman]], [[Dr. Hibbert]] and more.

The piano teacher later decided to make a career change and become a children's agent, since she knew people in the business through her daughter's work. The teacher asked Shearer's parents for permission to take him to an audition. Several months later, she called Shearer's parents and told them that she had gotten Shearer an audition for the radio show ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]''.

After the filming, Shearer's parents said they did not want him to be a regular in a series. Instead they wanted him to just do occasional work so that he could have a normal childhood. Shearer and his parents made the decision not to accept the role in the series if it was picked up by a television network.<ref name=\"avclub\"/>\n\nShearer attended [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] as a political science major in the early 1960s and decided to quit show business to become a \"serious person\".<ref name=\"ign1\"/> However, he says this lasted approximately a month, and he joined the staff of the ''[[Daily Bruin]]'', UCLA's school newspaper, during his first year.<ref name=\"ign1\"/> He was editor of the college humor magazine (Satyr) including the June 1964 parody, Preyboy <ref>Preyboy</ref> He also worked as a newscaster at KRLA, a top 40 radio station in Pasadena, during this period.  According to Shearer, after graduating, he had \"a very serious agenda going on, and it was 'Stay Out of the Draft'.\"<ref name=\"ign1\"/> He attended [[graduate school]] at [[Harvard University]] for one year and worked at the state legislature in [[Sacramento]]. In 1967 and 1968, he was a high school teacher, teaching English and social studies. He left teaching following \"disagreements with the administration.\"<ref name=\"ign1\"/>\n\nFrom 1969 to 1976, Shearer was a member of [[The Credibility Gap]], a radio comedy group that included [[David Lander]], [[Richard Beebe]] and [[Michael McKean]].<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic |class=artist |id=p149 |pure_url=yes}} |title=The Credibility Gap |accessdate=2008-01-02 |author=Deming, Mark |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> The group consisted of \"a bunch of newsmen\" at [[KRLA 1110]], \"the number two station\" in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> They wanted to do more than just straight news, so they hired comedians who were talented vocalists. Shearer heard about it from a friend so he brought over a tape to the station and nervously gave it to the receptionist. He found out he was hired that same day. The group's radio show was canceled in 1970 by KRLA and in 1971 by [[KPPC-FM]], so they started performing in various clubs and concert venues.<ref name=\"ign1\"/> While at KRLA, Shearer also interviewed [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] for the [[Pop Chronicles]] music documentary.<ref name=\"Gilliland\">{{cite web |url=http://www.library.unt.edu/music/special-collections/john-gilliland/e-l |title=Index to Interviews |work=[[Pop Chronicles]] |accessdate=2008-01-02 |authorlink=John Gilliland |last=Gilliland |first=John}}</ref> In 1973, Shearer appeared as Jim Houseafire on ''[[How Time Flys]]'', an album by [[The Firesign Theatre]]'s [[David Ossman]].

All three members were offered the chance to join the show in the 1984\u20131985 season.

[[Dick Ebersol]], who replaced Lorne Michaels as the show's producer, said that Shearer was \"a gifted performer but a pain in the butt.

They decided that the film could not be written and instead filmed a 20-minute demo of what they wanted to do.<ref name=\"ign2\"/> It was eventually greenlighted by [[Norman Lear]] and [[Jerry Perenchio]] at [[Embassy Pictures]].<ref name=\"ign2\"/> The film satirizes the wild personal behavior and musical pretensions of [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands, as well as the [[hagiography|hagiographic]] tendencies of [[rockumentary|rockumentaries]] of the time. The three core members of the band [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]\u2014[[David St. Hubbins]], [[Derek Smalls]] and [[Nigel Tufnel]]\u2014were portrayed by McKean, Shearer and Guest respectively. The three actors play their musical instruments and speak with mock English accents throughout the film. There was no script, although there was a written breakdown of most of the scenes, and many of the lines were ad-libbed.<ref name=\"ign2\"/> It was filmed in 25 days.<ref name=\"ign2\"/>\n\nShearer said in an interview that \"The animating impulse was to do rock 'n' roll right. The four of us had been around rock 'n' roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies got it wrong. Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, but we wanted to get it right.\"<ref name=\"thejc\"/> When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group kept saying, \"No, this is a story that's pretty familiar to people. We're not introducing them to anything they don't really know,\" so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and a [[cult following]], after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs|list of the top 100 comedy movies in American cinema]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/laughs.aspx |title=AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs |date=June 14, 2000 |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |accessdate=2009-04-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615021804/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/laughs.aspx |archivedate=June 15, 2008}}</ref> and it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/film/titles.html |title=Films Selected to The National Film Registry, Library of Congress 1989\u20132008 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref>\n\nShearer, Guest and McKean have since worked on several projects as their Spinal Tap characters.

People engage in a variety of sexual acts, ranging from activities done alone (e.g., [[masturbation]]) to acts with another person (e.g., [[sexual intercourse]], [[non-penetrative sex]], [[oral sex]], etc.) in varying patterns of frequency, for a wide variety of reasons. Sexual activity usually results in [[sexual arousal]] and physiological changes in the aroused person, some of which are pronounced while others are more subtle. Sexual activity may also include conduct and activities which are intended to arouse the sexual interest of another or enhance the [[sex life]] of another, such as strategies to find or attract partners ([[courtship]] and [[Display (zoology)|display]] behaviour), or personal interactions between individuals (for instance, [[foreplay]] or [[BDSM]]). Sexual activity may follow sexual arousal.\n\nHuman sexual activity has sociological, cognitive, [[Emotional intimacy|emotional]], [[Physical intimacy|behavioural]] and biological aspects; these include [[Human bonding|personal bonding]], sharing emotions and the [[physiology]] of the [[reproductive system]], [[sex drive]], sexual intercourse and sexual behaviour in all its forms.\n\nIn some cultures, sexual activity is considered acceptable only within marriage, while [[Premarital sex|premarital]] and [[extramarital sex]] are taboo. Some sexual activities are illegal either universally or in some countries or subnational jurisdictions, while some are considered contrary to the [[Norm (social)|norm]]s of certain societies or cultures. Two examples that are criminal offences in most<!--virtually all?--> [[jurisdiction]]s are [[sexual assault]] and sexual activity with a person below the local [[age of consent]].\n\n==Types==\n[[File:1925 Wegener Les Delassements dEros 09 anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|230px|[[Gerda Wegener]]'s 1925 artwork \"Les delassements d'Eros\" (\"The recreations of Eros\"), which depicts sexual activity by two women]]\nSexual activity can be classified in a number of ways: acts which involve one person (also called [[autoeroticism]]) such as [[masturbation]], or two or more people such as [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]], [[anal sex]], [[oral sex]] or [[mutual masturbation]]. If there are more than two participants in the sex act, it may be referred to as [[group sex]]. Autoerotic sexual activity can involve use of [[dildo]]s, [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]]s, [[anal beads]], and other [[sex toy]]s, though these devices can also be used with a partner.\n\nSexual activity can be classified into the [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]] of the participants, as well as by the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage, [[intimate partner]]s, casual [[sex partners]] or [[anonymous sex|anonymous]]. Sexual activity can be regarded as [[conventional sex|conventional]] or as [[Kink (sexual)|alternative]], involving, for example, [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]], [[paraphilia]], or [[BDSM]] activities.<ref name=\"channel1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |title=Sex and Relationships |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504202257/http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |archivedate=4 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"findarticles.com\">{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526192917/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 May 2012 |title=Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better.

The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include [[erotic asphyxiation]] and [[self-bondage]]. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes ([[Fainting game|choking]] and [[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]], respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.\n\nSexual activity can be consensual, which means that both or all participants agree to take part and are of the age that they can consent, or it may take place under force or duress, which is often called [[sexual assault]] or rape. In different cultures and countries, various sexual activities may be lawful or illegal in regards to the age, gender, marital status or other factors of the participants, or otherwise contrary to [[social norms]] or generally accepted [[sexual morals]].\n\n==Mating strategies==\nIn [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[behavioral ecology]], human mating strategies are a set of behaviors used by individuals to attract, select, and retain [[Mating|mates]]. Mating strategies overlap with [[reproductive]] strategies, which encompass a broader set of behaviors involving the timing of reproduction and the trade-off between quantity and quality of offspring (see [[life history theory]]).\n\nRelative to other animals, human mating strategies are unique in their relationship with cultural variables such as the institution of [[marriage]].<ref>Low, B. S. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=8K7Hc09xcQAC&pg=PA449#v=onepage&q=%22Ecological%20and%20socio-cultural%20impacts%20on%20mating%20and%20marriage%22 Ecological and socio-cultural impacts on mating and marriage]. Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, 449.</ref> Humans may seek out individuals with the intention of forming a long-term [[intimate relationship]], marriage, [[casual relationship]], or [[friendship]]. The human desire for [[companionship]] is one of the strongest human drives. It is an innate feature of human nature, and may be related to the [[sex drive]]. The human mating process encompasses the social and cultural processes whereby one person may meet another to assess suitability, the [[courtship]] process and the process of forming an [[interpersonal relationship]]. Commonalities, however, can be found between humans and nonhuman animals in mating behavior (see [[animal sexual behavior]]).\n\n==Stages of physiological arousal during sexual stimulation==\n[[File:Kama sutra 24 detail.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This Indian [[Kama sutra]] illustration, which shows a woman on top of a man, depicts the male erection, which is one of the physiological responses to sexual arousal for men.]]\nThe [[Human sexual response cycle|physiological responses]] during [[sexual stimulation]] are fairly similar for both men and women and there are four phases.<ref name=\"Schacter\">{{cite book | authors=Daniel L.

Men and women experience a \"[[sex flush]]\" on the skin of the upper body and face. Typically, a woman's [[vagina]] becomes lubricated and her [[clitoris]] becomes swollen.<ref name=\"Schacter\"/> A male's penis will become erect.\n* During the plateau phase, heart rate and muscle tension increase further.

A study published in the journal Biological Psychology described how men who had had sex the previous night responded better to stressful situations, it suggested that if a person is regularly sexual, they're regularly relaxed, and when the person is relaxed, they cope better with stressful situations. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}} A 2007 study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior 36, (no. 3 (June 2007): 357\u201368) reported that sexual behavior with a partner on one day significantly predicted lower negative mood and stress, and higher positive mood, on the following day.\n\n===Motivations===\n{{anchor|Reasons_for_sexual_activity}}\n{{Redirect|Pity sex|the American rock band|Pity Sex}}\nPeople engage in sexual activity for any of a multitude of possible reasons.

(See [[Virginity#Prevalence of virginity|Prevalence of virginity]].) The first sexual act of a child or adolescent is sometimes referred to as the [[sexualization]] of the child, and may be considered as a milestone or a change of status, as the loss of [[virginity]] or innocence. Youth are legally free to have intercourse after they reach the [[age of consent]].\n\nA 1999 survey of students indicated that approximately 40% of ninth graders across the United States report having had sexual intercourse. This figure rises with each grade. Males are more sexually active than females at each of the grade levels surveyed. Sexual activity of young adolescents differs in ethnicity as well. A higher percent of African American and Hispanic adolescents are sexually active than White adolescents.<ref>Meece, Judith L. Child and Adolescent Development for Educators. New York: McGraw Hill, 2008. Print.</ref>\n\nResearch on sexual frequency has also been conducted solely on female adolescents who engage in sexual activity.  Female adolescents tended to engage in more sexual activity due to positive mood.

Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity. Both genders in the study agreed they needed good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a sexually skilful partner to maintain sexual desire.<ref>Kontula, O., & Haavio-Mannila, E.

Heterosexual sexual practices are subject to laws in many places. In some countries, mostly those where religion has a strong influence on [[social policy]], marriage laws serve the purpose of encouraging people to have sex only within marriage. [[Sodomy laws]] were seen as discouraging same-sex sexual practices, but may affect opposite-sex sexual practices. Laws also ban adults from committing [[sexual abuse]], committing sexual acts with anyone under an [[age of consent]], performing sexual activities in public, and engaging in sexual activities for money (prostitution). Though these laws cover both same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activities, they may differ in regard to punishment, and may be more frequently (or exclusively) enforced on those who engage in same-sex sexual activities.<ref>[http://criminal.findlaw.com/crimes/more-criminal-topics/sex-offenders/sex-offenses-overview.html Sex Offenders and Sex Offenses: Overview.

For example, mutual masturbation in the context of what may be considered normal heterosexual teen development. Gay and lesbian people who pretend to be heterosexual are often referred to as being [[closeted]] (hiding their sexuality in \"the closet\"). \"Closet case\" is a derogatory term used to refer to people who hide their sexuality. Making that orientation public can be called \"[[coming out of the closet]]\" in the case of voluntary disclosure or \"[[outing]]\" in the case of disclosure by others against the subject's wishes (or without their knowledge). Among some communities (called \"men on the DL\" or \"[[Down-low (sexual slang)|down-low]]\"), same-sex sexual behavior is sometimes viewed as solely for physical pleasure. [[Men who have sex with men]], as well as [[women who have sex with women]], or men on the \"down-low\" may engage in sex acts with members of the same sex while continuing sexual and romantic relationships with the opposite sex.\n\nPeople who engage exclusively in same-sex sexual practices may not identify themselves as gay or lesbian. In sex-segregated environments, individuals may seek relationships with others of their own gender (known as [[situational homosexuality]]). In other cases, some people may experiment or explore their sexuality with same (or different) sex sexual activity before defining their [[sexual identity]]. Despite stereotypes and common misconceptions, there are no forms of sexual acts exclusive to same-sex sexual behavior that cannot also be found in opposite-sex sexual behavior, except those involving the meeting of the genitalia between same-sex partners&nbsp;\u2013 [[tribadism]] (generally [[vulva]]-to-vulva rubbing, commonly known by its \"scissoring\" position) and [[frot]] (generally [[Human penis|penis]]-to-penis rubbing).\n\n===Bisexuality and pansexuality===\n{{Main|Bisexuality|Pansexuality}}\nPeople who have a romantic or sexual attraction to both sexes are referred to as bisexual.<ref name=\"apahelp\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx |title=Sexual Orientation, Homosexuality, and Bisexuality |periodical=[[American Psychological Association|APA]]HelpCenter.org |accessdate=18 September 2012 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

This same couple may emphasize different aspects of intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Religious and ethical===\n{{Main|Sexual morality|Religion and sexuality|Norm (sociology)}}\n[[File:Khajuraho-Lakshmana Temple erotic detal1.JPG|thumb|Erotic sculptures found in a medieval [[Khajuraho|Hindu]] temple in India]]\nMost world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from people's sexuality in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed [[moral code]]s covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc. Though these moral codes do not address issues of sexuality directly, they seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's sexual activities and practices. However, the effect of religious teaching has at times been limited. For example, though most religions disapprove of [[extramarital sex|extramarital sexual relations]], it has always been widely practiced. Nevertheless, these religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples' attitudes to issues of modesty in dress, behavior, speech etc.\n\nOn the other hand, some people adopt the view that pleasure is its own justification for sexual activity.

These social rules are referred to as [[Sexual ethics|sexual morality]] (what can and can not be done by society's rules) and sexual norms (what is and is not expected).\n\nSexual ethics, morals, and norms relate to issues including deception/honesty, legality, [[fidelity]] and consent.

These laws and customs vary from country to country, and have varied over time. They cover, for example, a prohibition to non-consensual sex, to sex outside marriage, to sexual activity in public, besides many others. Many of these restrictions are non-controversial, but some have been the subject of public debate.\n\nMost societies consider it a serious crime to force someone to engage in sexual acts or to engage in sexual activity with someone who does not consent. This is called [[sexual assault]], and if sexual penetration occurs it is called rape, the most serious kind of sexual assault. The details of this distinction may vary among different legal jurisdictions. Also, what constitutes effective consent in sexual matters varies from culture to culture and is frequently debated. Laws regulating the minimum age at which a person can consent to have sex ([[age of consent]]) are frequently the subject of debate, as is [[adolescent sexual behavior]] in general.

It takes in water at one \"[[hydraulic head]]\" (pressure) and flow rate, and outputs water at a higher hydraulic head and lower flow rate. The device uses the [[water hammer]] effect to develop pressure that allows a portion of the input water that powers the [[pump]] to be lifted to a point higher than where the water originally started. The hydraulic ram is sometimes used in remote areas, where there is both a source of [[Low head hydro power|low-head hydropower]] and a need for pumping water to a destination higher in elevation than the source.  In this situation, the ram is often useful, since it requires no outside source of [[Power (physics)|power]] other than the [[kinetic energy]] of flowing water.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ram Pump (Vogn 2011) ubt.ogv|thumb|A ram pump in [[Vogn]], [[North Denmark Region|Nordjylland]], [[Denmark]]]]\n\nIn 1772, [[John Whitehurst]] of [[Cheshire]], [[United Kingdom]], invented a manually controlled precursor of the hydraulic ram called the \"pulsation engine\" and installed the first one at [[Oulton, Cheshire]] to raise water to a height of {{convert|4.9|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Whitehurst\n | first = John\n | title = Account of a Machine for Raising Water, executed at Oulton, in Cheshire, in 1772\n | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\n | volume = 65\n | issue =\n | pages = 277\u2013279\n | publisher = Royal Society\n | location = London\n | year = 1775\n | url = http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&seq=1&size=1&id=pt.1775.x.x.65.x.277\n | doi =10.1098/rstl.1775.0026 }}\n</ref><ref>Descriptions of Whitehurst's and Montgolfier's pumps appear in: James Ferguson and David Brewster, ''Lectures on Select Subjects'', 3rd ed.

The venturi valve is configured as a ring section positioned around the supply inlet of the pump with the delivery outlet of the pump being directly in line. The design allowed the pump structure to be concentric and therefore inherently strong and upon closure of the valve, permits efficient water delivery by acting in line with the supply via a second smaller venturi effect delivery non return valve. The elastomeric material and operation of these valves also allows them to self-return without weight or spring assistance. A [[pressure vessel]] installed on a tee connected to the delivery port of the pump provides the pulsed flow accumulation means. This unique technology and design dramatically reduced the weight, manufacturing cost and number of components required - as well as provided an overall improvement in efficiency.\n\nAdditional patents granted to Selwyn have since been developed by UK companies Papa Ltd and Water Powered Technologies Ltd<ref>[https://www.waterpoweredtechnologies.com/ Water Powered Technologies \u2013 Composite Hydraulic Ram Pump inventors and patentees.]</ref> of [[Bude]], [[Cornwall]], further enhancing the technology to include a [[composite material]] [[injection-moulded]] pump allowing for relatively low cost [[mass production]] whilst maintaining high strength, low weight and high performance previously only attainable with metal units.\n\nOther novel developments include an automatic regulator valve which can be simply installed to the pumps to allow the maximum utilisation of water supply from low or seasonally variable water sources without the need to manually adjust the pumps - as well as much larger pump versions with 1 metre diameter inlets for large river, marine tidal and flood applications. Systems have also been developed and utilised for [[rainwater harvesting]], [[water treatment]] and other [[water utility]] applications.\n\nThe new [[scalable]] technology, manufacturing processes and materials and the ability to integrate with other systems should allow the 21st century ram pump to regain its recognition as a world leader in energy efficient water supply as well as new roles in energy generation, irrigation and flood support networks.{{clear}}\n\n== Construction and principle of operation ==\nA traditional hydraulic ram has only two moving parts, a spring or weight loaded \"waste\" [[valve]] sometimes known as the \"clack\" valve and a \"delivery\" [[check valve]], making it cheap to build, easy to maintain, and very reliable. The Papa hydraulic ram pump also has only two moving parts. However, these are not mechanical but instead rely on the elastomeric properties of the main valve and non-return valve which are low-cost, reliable and easy to replace. In addition, there is a drive pipe supplying water from an elevated source and a delivery pipe, taking a portion of the water that comes through the drive pipe to an elevation higher than the source.\n\n=== Sequence of operation ===\n[[Image:Hydraulic Ram.gif|thumb|right|250px|Figure&nbsp;2: Basic components of a hydraulic ram:<br>\n1. Inlet \u2013 drive pipe<br>\n2. Free flow at waste valve<br>\n3. Outlet \u2013 delivery pipe<br>\n4. Waste valve<br>\n5. Delivery [[check valve]]<br>\n6. Pressure vessel]]\nA simplified hydraulic ram is shown in Figure&nbsp;2. Initially, the waste valve [4] is open (i.e. lowered) because of its own weight, and the delivery valve [5] is closed under the pressure caused by the water column from the outlet [3]. The water in the inlet pipe [1] starts to flow under the force of [[gravity]] and picks up speed and [[kinetic energy]] until the increasing [[Drag (physics)|drag]] force lifts the waste valve's weight and closes it. The [[momentum]] of the water flow in the inlet pipe against the now closed waste valve causes a [[water hammer]] that raises the pressure in the pump beyond the pressure caused by the water column pressing down from the outlet. This pressure differential now opens the delivery valve [5], and forces some water to flow into the delivery pipe [3]. Because this water is being forced uphill through the delivery pipe farther than it is falling downhill from the source, the flow slows; when the flow reverses, the delivery check valve [5] closes. Meanwhile, the water hammer from the closing of the waste valve also produces a pressure pulse which propagates back up the inlet pipe to the source where it converts to a suction pulse that propagates back down the inlet pipe. This suction pulse, with the weight or spring on the valve, pulls the waste valve back open and allows the process to begin again.\n\nA pressure vessel [6] containing air cushions the hydraulic pressure shock when the waste valve closes, and it also improves the pumping efficiency by allowing a more constant flow through the delivery pipe. Although the pump could in theory work without it, the efficiency would drop drastically and the pump would be subject to extraordinary stresses that could shorten its life considerably. One problem is that the pressurized air will gradually dissolve into the water until none remains. One solution to this problem is to have the air separated from the water by an elastic diaphragm (similar to an [[expansion tank]]); however, this solution can be problematic in developing countries where replacements are difficult to procure. Another solution is to have a mechanism such as a [[snifting valve]] that automatically inserts a small bubble of air when the suction pulse described above reaches the pump.<ref>[http://practicalactionconsulting.org/docs/technical_information_service/hydraulic_ram_pumps.pdf Practical Answers: Hydraulic Ram Pumps]</ref> Another solution is to insert an [[inner tube]] of a car or bicycle [[tire]] into the pressure vessel with some air in it and the valve closed. This tube is in effect the same as the diaphragm, but it is implemented with more widely available materials. The air in the tube cushions the shock of the water the same as the air in other configurations does.\n\n===Efficiency===\nA typical energy efficiency is 60%, but up to 80% is possible. This should not be confused with the volumetric efficiency, which relates the volume of water delivered to total water taken from the source.  The portion of water available at the delivery pipe will be reduced by the ratio of the delivery head to the supply head.  Thus if the source is 2 meters above the ram and the water is lifted to 10 meters above the ram, only 20% of the supplied water can be available, the other 80% being spilled via the waste valve.  These ratios assume 100% energy efficiency.  Actual water delivered will be further reduced by the energy efficiency factor. In the above example, if the energy efficiency is 70%, the water delivered will be 70% of 20%, i.e. 14%.  Assuming a 2-to-1 supply head to delivery head ratio and 70% efficiency, the delivered water would be 70% of 50%, i.e. 35%.  Very high ratios of delivery to supply head usually result in lowered energy efficiency.  Suppliers of rams often provide tables giving expected volume ratios based on actual tests.\n\n===Drive and delivery pipe design===\nSince both efficiency and reliable cycling depend on water hammer effects, the drive pipe design is important. It should be between 3 and 7 times longer than the vertical distance between the source and the ram. Commercial rams may have an input fitting designed to accommodate this optimum [[slope]].<ref>[http://www.greenandcarter.com/main/rampumpleaflet.htm Hydraulic Ram Pumps, John Perkin]</ref> The diameter of the supply pipe would normally match  the diameter of  the input fitting on the ram, which in turn is based on its pumping capacity.  The drive pipe should be of constant diameter and material, and should be as straight as possible.  Where bends are necessary, they should be smooth, large diameter curves. Even a large spiral is allowed, but [[Elbow (piping)|elbows]] are to be avoided. PVC will work in some installations, but steel pipe is preferred, although much more expensive. If valves are used they should be a free flow type such as a [[ball valve]] or [[gate valve]].\n\nThe delivery pipe is much less critical since the pressure vessel prevents water hammer effects from traveling up it. Its overall design would be determined by the allowable [[pressure drop]] based on the expected flow. Typically the pipe size will be about half that of the supply pipe, but for very long runs a larger size may be indicated. PVC pipe and any necessary valves are not a problem.\n\n=== Starting operation ===\nA ram newly placed into operation or which has stopped cycling must be started as follows: <ref>https://www.clemson.edu/extension/publications/files/livestock-forages/Lf13-home-made-hydraulic-ram-pump.pdf, page7</ref> If the waste valve is in the raised (closed) position, which is most common, it must be pushed down  manually into the open position and released. If the flow is sufficient, it will then cycle at least once. If it does not continue to cycle, it must be pushed down repeatedly until it cycles continuously on its own, usually after three or four manual cycles. If the ram stops with the waste valve in the down (open) position it must be lifted manually and kept up for as long as necessary for the supply pipe to fill with water and for any air bubbles to travel up the pipe to the source. This may take a minute or more. Then it can be started manually by pushing it down a few times as described above. Having a valve on the delivery pipe at the ram makes starting easier. Close the valve until the ram starts cycling, then gradually open it to fill the delivery pipe. If opened too quickly it will stop the cycling. Once the delivery pipe is full the valve can be left open.\n\n=== Common operational problems ===\nFailure to deliver sufficient water may be due to improper adjustment of the waste valve, having too little air in the pressure vessel, or simply attempting to raise the water higher than the level of which the ram is capable.\n\nThe ram may be damaged by freezing in winter, or loss of air in the pressure vessel leading to excess stress on the ram parts.   These failures will require welding or other repair methods and perhaps parts replacement.\n\nIt is not uncommon for an operating ram to require occasional restarts. The cycling may stop due to poor adjustment of the waste valve, or insufficient water flow at the source.  Air can enter if the supply water level is not at least a few inches above the input end of the supply pipe.  Other problems are blockage of the valves with debris, or improper installation, such as using a supply pipe of non uniform diameter or material, having sharp bends or a rough interior, or one that is too long or short for the drop, or is made of an insufficiently rigid material.  A PVC supply pipe will work in some installations but is not as optimal as steel.\n\n== Water-powered pump ==\nAn alternative to the hydraulic ram is the water-powered pump. It can be used if a high flow rate at high head ratio is required. A water-powered pump unit is a hydraulic turbine coupled to a water pump. The motive power needed by the pump is generated by the hydraulic turbine from the available low head water energy.<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/58789354/Nagarjuna-Sagar-WPP-Units Nagarjuna Sagar Water Powered pump (WPP) Units]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Boost converter]] - [[Hydraulic analogy|electronic\u2013hydraulic analog]] of the hydraulic ram.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kypuros|first=Javier A. |last2=Longoria|first2=Raul G. |date=2004-01-29 |year= |title=Model Synthesis for Design of Switched Systems Using a Variable Structure System Formulation |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.1636774 |journal=Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control |volume=125 |issue=4|pages=618\u2013629 |doi=10.1115/1.1636774 |issn=0022-0434 |quote=The hydraulic-ram pump ... structure parallels that of the boost converter making it a hydraulic analog|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Longoria |first=R.

Studies have suggested that the earliest hominins were dimorphic and that this lessened over the course of the evolution of the genus ''Homo'', correlating with humans becoming more monogamous, whereas gorillas, who live in harems, show a large degree of sexual dimorphism. Concealed (or \"hidden\") ovulation means that the phase of fertility is not detectable in women, whereas chimpanzees advertise ovulation via an obvious swelling of the genitals. Women can be partly aware of their ovulation along the menstrual phases, but men are essentially unable to detect ovulation in women. Most primates have semi-concealed ovulation, thus one can think that the common ancestor had semi-concealed ovulation, that was inherited by gorillas, and that later evolved in concealed ovulation in humans and advertised ovulation in chimpanzees. Menopause also occurs in [[rhesus monkeys]], and possibly in chimpanzees, but does not in gorillas and is quite uncommon in other primates (and other mammal groups).<ref name=\"WiSF\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Chimpanzee\u2013human last common ancestor]]\n* [[List of human evolution fossils]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Wikispecies|Homininae}}\n{{refbegin}}\n:* {{cite book |first=Edward |last=Hollox |first2=Matthew |last2=Hurles |first3=Toomas |last3=Kivisild |first4=Chris |last4=Tyler-Smith |title=Human Evolutionary Genetics |year=2013 |publisher=Garland Science |isbn=978-0-8153-4148-2 |edition=2nd}}\n:* {{cite web |title=''Homininae'' |work=NCBI Taxonomy Browser |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=207598 |id=207598}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikibooks|Dichotomous Key|Homininae}}\n* [http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-evolution-timeline-interactive Human Timeline (Interactive)] \u2013 [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], [[National Museum of Natural History]] (August 2016).\n{{Hominidae nav}}\n{{Apes}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q242047}}\n\n[[Category:Homininae| ]]\n[[Category:Apes]]\n[[Category:Extant Miocene first appearances]]\n[[Category:Mammal subfamilies]]", "sha1": "lr467dxzhtu60tx4kfjboyb8tuf2aed"}}, {"title": "Homo habilis", "ns": "0", "id": "14348", "revision": {"id": "865130908", "parentid": "865130852", "timestamp": "2018-10-21T23:18:22Z", "contributor": {"username": "Neils51", "id": "16416757"}, "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/2601:194:C380:9A4D:D0C9:B67D:7C4D:31C9|2601:194:C380:9A4D:D0C9:B67D:7C4D:31C9]] ([[User talk:2601:194:C380:9A4D:D0C9:B67D:7C4D:31C9|talk]]): Unconstructive.

There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one [[Reed (music)|reed]]. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of [[brass]], [[stainless steel]], or [[bronze]], which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound.\n\nReeds are pre-tuned to individual pitches. Tuning may involve changing a reed\u2019s length, the weight near its free end, or the stiffness near its fixed end. Longer, heavier and springier reeds produce deeper, lower sounds; shorter, lighter and stiffer reeds make higher-pitched sounds. If, as on most modern harmonicas, a reed is affixed above or below its slot rather than in the plane of the slot, it responds more easily to air flowing in the direction that initially would push it into the slot, i.e., as a ''closing reed''. This difference in response to air direction makes it possible to include both a ''blow reed'' and a ''draw reed'' in the same air chamber and to play them separately without relying on flaps of plastic or leather (valves, wind-savers) to block the nonplaying reed.\n\nAn important technique in performance is bending: causing a drop in pitch by making [[embouchure]] adjustments.  It is possible to bend isolated reeds, as on chromatic and other harmonica models with wind-savers, but also to both lower, and raise (''overbend'', ''overblow'', ''overdraw'') the pitch produced by pairs of reeds in the same chamber, as on a diatonic or other unvalved harmonica. Such two-reed pitch changes actually involve sound production by the normally silent reed, the ''opening reed'' (for instance, the blow reed while the player is drawing).\n\n==Parts==\n[[Image:Gaita partes1.jpg|thumb|200px|Comb and two reed plates]]\n[[Image:Gaita palhetas.jpg|thumb|200px|Reed plate]]\n[[Image:Gaita Palhetas2.jpg|thumb|200px|Reed plate mounted on the comb of a diatonic harmonica, one of several categories of harmonica.]] The basic parts of the harmonica are the comb, reed plates and cover plates.\n\n===Comb===\nThe comb is the main body of the instrument, which, when assembled with the reedplates, forms air chambers for the reeds. The term ''comb'' may originate from the similarity between this part of a harmonica and a [[hair comb]]. Harmonica combs were traditionally made from [[wood]] but now are also made from [[plastic]] ([[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]]) or [[metal]] (including [[titanium]] for high-end instruments).  Some modern and experimental comb designs are complex in the way that they direct the air.\n\nThere is dispute among players about whether comb material affects the tone of a harmonica. Those saying no argue that, unlike the soundboard of a piano or the top piece of a violin or guitar, a harmonica's comb is neither large enough nor able to vibrate freely enough to substantially augment or change the sound. Among those saying yes are those who are convinced by their ears. Few dispute, however, that comb surface smoothness and air-tightness when mated with the reedplates can greatly affect tone and playability. The main advantage of a particular comb material over another one is its durability.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Weinstein, Randy F. |author2=Melton, William|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Playing the Harmonica|isbn=0-02-864241-4}}</ref> In particular, a wooden comb can absorb moisture from the player's breath and contact with the tongue. This can cause the comb to expand slightly, making the instrument uncomfortable to play, and to then contract, potentially compromising air tightness. Various types of wood and treatments have been devised to reduce the degree of this problem.\n\nAn even more serious problem with wood combs, especially in chromatic harmonicas (with their thin dividers between chambers), is that, as the combs expand and shrink over time, cracks can form in the combs, because the comb is held immobile by nails, resulting in disabling leakage. Much effort is devoted by serious players to restoring wood combs and sealing leaks. Some players used to soak wooden-combed harmonicas ([[Diatonic and chromatic|diatonics]], without windsavers) in water to cause a slight expansion, which they intended to make the seal between the comb, reed plates and covers more airtight. Modern wooden-combed harmonicas are less prone to swelling and contracting. Players still dip harmonicas in water for the way it affects tone and ease of bending notes.\n\n===Reed plate===\nThe reed plate is a grouping of several reeds in a single housing. The reeds are usually made of brass, but steel, aluminium and plastic are occasionally used. Individual reeds are usually riveted to the reed plate, but they may also be welded or screwed in place. Reeds fixed on the inner side of the reed plate (within the comb's air chamber) respond to blowing, while those fixed on the outer side respond to suction.\n\nMost harmonicas are constructed with the reed plates screwed or bolted to the comb or each other. A few brands still use the traditional method of nailing the reed plates to the comb. Some experimental and rare harmonicas also have had the reed plates held in place by tension, such as the WWII era all-American models. If the plates are bolted to the comb, the reed plates can be replaced individually. This is useful because the reeds eventually go out of tune through normal use, and certain notes of the scale can fail more quickly than others.\n\nA notable exception to the traditional reed plate design is the all-plastic harmonicas designed by Finn Magnus in the 1950s, in which the reed and reed plate were molded out of a single piece of plastic. The Magnus design had the reeds, reed plates and comb made of plastic and either molded or permanently glued together.\n\n===Cover plates===\nCover plates cover the reed plates and are usually made of metal, though wood and plastic have also been used. The choice of these is personal; because they project sound, they determine the tonal quality of the harmonica. There are two types of cover plates: traditional open designs of stamped metal or plastic, which are simply there to be held; and enclosed designs (such as the [[Hohner]] Meisterklasse and Super 64, [[Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation|Suzuki]] Promaster and SCX), which offer a louder tonal quality. From these two basic types, a few modern designs have been created, such as the Hohner CBH-2016 chromatic and the [[Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation|Suzuki]] Overdrive diatonic, which have complex covers that allow for specific functions not usually available in the traditional design. It was not unusual in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for harmonicas to have special features on the covers, such as [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], which could be rung by pushing a button.\n\n===Windsavers===\n''Windsavers'' are one-way valves made from thin strips of plastic, knit paper, leather or Teflon glued to the reed plate. They are typically found in chromatic harmonicas, chord harmonicas and many octave-tuned harmonicas. Windsavers are used when two reeds share a cell and leakage through the nonplaying reed would be significant. For example, when a draw note is played, the valve on the blow reed-slot is sucked shut, preventing air from leaking through the inactive blow reed. An exception to this is the now-discontinued Hohner XB-40, on which valves are placed not to isolate single reeds but rather to isolate entire chambers from being active, a design that made it possible to play traditional blues bends on all reeds.\n\n===Mouthpiece===\nThe mouthpiece is placed between the air chambers of the instrument and the player's mouth. This can be integral with the comb (the diatonic harmonicas; the Hohner Chrometta); part of the cover (as in Hohner's CX-12); or may be a separate unit, secured by screws, which is typical of chromatics. In many harmonicas, the mouthpiece is purely an ergonomic aid designed to make playing more comfortable. However, in the traditional slider-based chromatic harmonica, it is essential to the functioning of the instrument because it provides a groove for the slide.\n\n===Accessories===\n[[Image:Mark Wenner on amplified harmonica.jpg|thumb|right|upright|125px|[[Mark Wenner]] cups his hands around a \"bullet mic\" as he plays amplified harmonica]]\n\n====Amplification devices====\n\nSince the 1950s, many [[blues]] harmonica players have amplified their instrument with microphones and [[instrument amplifier|tube amplifiers]]. One of the early innovators of this approach was Marion \"[[Little Walter]]\" Jacobs, who played the harmonica near a \"Bullet\" [[microphone]] marketed for use by radio [[Taxicab#Dispatching|taxi dispatchers]]. This gave his harmonica tone  a \"punchy\" midrange sound that could be heard above an electric guitar. As well, tube amplifiers produce a natural growling [[distortion (music)|overdrive]] when cranked at higher volumes, which adds body, fullness and \"grit\" to the sound. Little Walter also cupped his hands around the instrument, tightening the air around the harp, giving it a powerful, distorted sound, somewhat reminiscent of a [[saxophone]], hence the term \"Mississippi saxophone\". Some harmonica players in folk use a regular vocal mic, such as a [[Shure SM 58]] for their harmonica, which gives a clean, natural sound.\n\nAs technology in amplification has progressed, harmonica players have introduced other [[effects unit]]s to their rigs as well, such as [[spring reverb|reverb]], [[tremolo]], [[delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[octave]], additional [[distortion (music)|overdrive]] pedals, and [[chorus effect]]. [[John Popper]] of [[Blues Traveler]] uses a customized microphone that encapsulates several of these effects into one handheld unit, as opposed to several units in sequence. Many harmonica players still prefer tube amplifiers to [[solid-state amplifier|solid-state]], owing to the perceived difference in tone generated by the [[vacuum tubes]]. Players perceive tubes as having a \"warmer\" tone and a more \"natural\" overdrive sound. Many amplifiers designed for [[electric guitar]] are also used by harmonica players, such as the [[Gibson Kalamazoo Electric Guitar#Kalamazoo Amplifiers|Kalamazoo Model Two]], [[Fender Bassman]], and the [[Danelectro Commando]]. Some expensive, handmade [[boutique amplifiers]], however, are built from the ground up with characteristics that are optimal for amplified harmonica.\n\n====Rack or holder====\n[[Image:Joan Baez and Bob Dylan.jpg |thumb|200px|[[Joan Baez]] and [[Bob Dylan]], 1963.  Dylan is wearing a harmonica holder.]]\n\nHarmonica players who play the instrument while performing on another instrument with their hands (e.g., an acoustic guitar) often use an accessory called a ''neck rack'' or ''harmonica holder'' to position the instrument in front of their mouth. A harmonica holder clamps the harmonica between two metal brackets, which are attached to a curved loop of metal that rests on the shoulders. The original harmonica racks were made from wire or coat hangers.  Models of harmonica racks vary widely by quality and ease of use, and it quite often takes experimenting with more than one model of harmonica rack to find one that feels suitable for each individual player. This device is used by folk musicians, [[one-man band]]s and singer-songwriters such as <!-- THESE ARE SELECTIVE EXAMPLES, NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST. GET CONSENSUS TO ADD MORE. -->[[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Harmon]], [[Neil Young]], [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and blues singers [[Jimmy Reed]] and [[John Hammond Jr.]]<!-- THESE ARE SELECTIVE EXAMPLES, NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST. GET CONSENSUS TO ADD MORE. --> The HarpArm is a magnetic harmonica holder that attaches to standard straight or boom microphone stands.\n\n==Harmonica types==\n===Chromatic harmonica===\n{{Main|chromatic harmonica}}\n[[Image:Chromonica.jpg|thumb|left|Hohner Super Chromonica, a typical 12-hole chromatic]]\nThe chromatic harmonica uses a button-activated sliding bar to redirect air from the hole in the mouthpiece to the selected reed-plate, though one design\u2014the \"Machino-Tone\"\u2014controlled airflow by means of a lever-operated flap on the rear of the instrument. Also, a \"hands-free\" modification to the Hohner 270 (12-hole) lets the player shift the tones by moving the mouthpiece up and down with the lips, leaving the hands free to play another instrument. While the [[Richter tuning|Richter-tuned]] 10-hole chromatic is intended to play in only one key, the 12-, 14-, and 16-hole models (which are tuned to equal temperament) allow the musician to play in any key desired with only one harmonica. This harp can be used for any style, including Celtic, classical, jazz, or blues (commonly in third position).\n\n===Diatonic harmonicas===\nStrictly speaking, diatonic denotes any harmonica designed to play in a single key\u2014though the standard [[Richter-tuned harmonica]] diatonic can play other keys by forcing its reeds to play tones that are not part of its basic scale. Depending on the country, \"diatonic harmonica\" may mean either the tremolo harmonica (in East Asia) or blues harp (In Europe and North America). Other diatonic harmonicas include octave harmonicas.\n\nHere is the note layout for a standard diatonic in the key of G major:\n\n:{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! !! style=\"width: 20px;\" | 1 !! style=\"width: 20px;\" | 2 !! style=\"width: 20px;\" | 3 !! style=\"width: 20px;\" | 4 !! style=\"width: 20px;\" | 5 !! style=\"width: 20px;\" | 6 !! style=\"width: 20px;\" | 7 !! style=\"width: 20px;\" | 8 !! style=\"width: 20px;\" | 9 !! style=\"width: 20px;\" | 10\n|-\n! blow\n| G || B || D || G || B || D || G || B || D || G\n|-\n! draw\n| A || D || F{{music|#}} || A || C || E || F{{music|#}} || A || C || E\n|}\n\nEach hole is the same [[interval (music)|interval]] (here, a [[perfect fifth]]) from its key of C counterpart; on the diatonic scale, a  G is a perfect fifth from C. The interval between keys can be used to find the note layout of any standard diatonic.\n\n===Tremolo-tuned harmonica===\n{{Main|tremolo harmonica}}\n[[Image:Suzuki Humming.png|right|thumb|225px|A tremolo harmonica]]\nThe distinguishing feature of the tremolo-tuned harmonica is that it has two reeds per note, with one slightly sharp and the other slightly flat. This provides a unique wavering or warbling sound created by the two reeds being slightly out of tune with each other and the difference in their subsequent waveforms interacting with each other (its [[Beat (acoustics)|beat]]). The Asian version, which can produce all 12 semitones, is used often in East Asian rock and pop music.\n\n===Orchestral harmonicas===\nOrchestral harmonicas are primarily designed for use in ensemble playing.\n\n====Orchestral melody harmonica====\nThere are eight kinds of orchestral melody harmonica; the most common are the '''horn''' harmonicas often found in East Asia. These consist of a single large comb with blow-only reed-plates on the top and bottom. Each reed sits inside a single cell in the comb. One version mimics the layout of a piano or mallet instrument, with the natural notes of a C diatonic scale in the lower reed plate and the sharps and flats in the upper reed plate in groups of two and three holes with gaps in between like the black keys of a piano. Another version has one \"sharp\" reed directly above its \"natural\" on the lower plate, with the same number of reeds on both plates (therefore including E{{music|#}} and B{{music|#}}).\n\nHorn harmonicas are available in several pitch ranges, with the lowest pitched starting two octaves below middle C and the highest beginning on middle C itself; they usually cover a two- or three-octave range. They are chromatic instruments and are usually played in an East Asian harmonica orchestra instead of the \"[[push-button]]\" chromatic harmonica that is more common in the European and American tradition. Their reeds are often larger, and the enclosing \"horn\" gives them a different timbre, so that they often function in place of a brass section. In the past, they were referred to as horn harmonicas.\n\nThe other type of orchestral melodic harmonica is the polyphonia, (though some are marked \"chromatica\"). These have all twelve chromatic notes laid out on the same row. In most cases, they have both blow and draw of the same tone, though the No. 7 is blow only, and the No. 261, also blow only, has two reeds per hole, tuned an octave apart (all these designations refer to products of M. Hohner).\n\n====Chord harmonica====\nThe chord harmonica has up to 48 chords: [[Major chord|major]], [[Seventh chord|seventh]], [[Minor chord|minor]], [[Augmented chord|augmented]] and [[diminished triad|diminished]] for ensemble playing. It is laid out in four-note clusters, each sounding a different chord on inhaling or exhaling. Typically each hole has two reeds for each note, tuned to one octave of each other. However, less expensive models often have only one reed per note. Quite a few orchestra harmonicas are also designed to serve as both bass and chord harmonica, with bass notes next to chord groupings. There are also other chord harmonicas, such as the Chordomonica (which operates similar to a chromatic harmonica), and the junior chord harmonicas (which typically provide six chords).\n\nThe Suzuki SSCH-56 Compact Chord harmonica is a 48-chord harmonica built in a 14-hole chromatic harmonica enclosure. The first three holes play a major chord on blow and draw, with and without the slide. Holes 2, 3, and 4 play a diminished chord; holes 3, 4, and 5 play a minor chord; and holes 4, 5, and 6 play an augmented, for a total of sixteen chords. This pattern is repeated starting on hole 5, a whole step higher; and again starting on hole 9, for a total of 48 chords.\n\n===ChengGong harmonica===\nThe ChengGong harmonica<ref>(a pun on the inventor's surname and {{lang|zh|\u6210\u529f}}, or \"success,\" pronounced \"chenggong\" in Mandarin Chinese) harmonica, invented by Cheng Xuexue {{lang|zh|\u7a0b\u96ea\u5b78}} of China.</ref> has a main body, and a sliding mouthpiece. The body is a 24-hole diatonic harmonica that ranges from B<sub>2</sub> to D<sub>6</sub> (covering 3 octaves). Its 11-hole mouthpiece can slide along the front of the harmonica, which gives numerous chord choices and voicings (seven triads, three 6th chords, seven 7th chords, and seven 9th chords, for a total of 24 chords). As well, it is capable of playing single-note melodies and double stops over a range of three diatonic octaves. Unlike conventional harmonicas, blowing and drawing produce the same notes because its tuning is closer to the note layout of a typical Asian tremolo harmonica or the Polyphonias.\n\n===Pitch pipe===\nThe [[pitch pipe]] is a simple specialty harmonica that provides a reference pitch to singers and other instruments. The only difference between some early pitch-pipes and harmonicas is the name of the instrument, which reflected the maker's target audience. Chromatic pitch pipes, which are used by singers and choirs, give a full chromatic (12-note) octave. Pitch pipes are also sold for string players, such as violinists and guitarists; these pitch pipes usually provide the notes corresponding to the open strings.\n\n==Techniques==\n{{Main|Harmonica techniques}}\n\n'''Vibrato''' is a technique commonly used while playing the harmonica and many other instruments, to give the note a 'shaking' sound. This technique can be accomplished in a number of ways. The most common way is to change how the harmonica is held. For example, the vibrato effect can be achieved by opening and closing the hands around the harmonica very rapidly. The vibrato might also be achieved via rapid glottal (vocal fold) opening and closing, especially on draws (inhalation) simultaneous to bending, or without bending. This obviates the need for cupping and waving the hands around the instrument during play. An effect similar to vibrato is that of the 'trill' (or 'roll', or 'warble, or 'shake'); this technique has the player move their lips between two holes very quickly, either by shaking the head in a rapid motion or moving the harmonica from side to side within the embouchure. This gives a quick pitch-alternating technique that is slightly more than vibrato and achieves the same aural effect on sustained notes, albeit by using two different tones instead of varying the amplitude of one.\n\nIn addition to the 19 notes readily available on the diatonic harmonica, players can play other notes by adjusting their [[embouchure]] and forcing the reed to resonate at a different pitch. This technique is called '''bending''', a term possibly borrowed from guitarists, who literally bend a string to subtly change the pitch. Bending also creates the glissandos characteristic of much blues harp and country harmonica playing. Bends are essential for most blues and rock harmonica due to the soulful sounds the instrument can bring out. The \"wail\" of the blues harp typically requires bending. In the 1970s, [[Howard Levy]] developed the '''over bending''' technique (also known as \"overblowing\" and \"overdrawing\".) '''Over Bending''', combined with bending, allowed players to play the entire chromatic scale.\n\nIn addition to playing the diatonic harmonica in its original key, it is also possible to play it in other keys by playing in other \"positions\" using different keynotes. Using just the basic notes on the instrument would mean playing in a specific mode for each position. For example the Mixolydian mode (root note is the second draw or third blow), produces a major dominant seventh key that is frequently used by blues players because it contains the harmonically rich dominant seventh note, while the Dorian mode (root note is four draw) produces a minor dominant seventh key. Harmonica players (especially blues players) have developed terminology around different \"positions,\" which can be confusing to other musicians, for example the slang terminology for the most common positions (1st being 'straight', 2nd being 'cross', 3rd being 'slant', etc.).\n\nAnother technique, seldom used to its full potential, is altering the size of the mouth cavity to emphasize certain natural [[overtones]]. When this technique is employed while playing chords, care must be taken in overtone selection as the overtones stemming from the non-root pitch can cause extreme dissonance.\n\nHarmonica players who amplify their instrument with microphones and [[instrument amplifier|tube amplifiers]], such as blues harp players, also have a range of techniques that exploit properties of the microphone and the amplifier, such as changing the way the hands are cupped around the instrument and the microphone or rhythmically breathing or chanting into the microphone while playing. Blues and folk players refer to the instrument with a range of less common names, including ''hand reed,'' ''Mississippi saxophone,'' ''licking stick,'' ''pocket sax,'' ''toe pickle,'' ''tin sandwich,'' ''ten-holed tin-can tongue twister,'' ''blues burger,'' ''harpoon,'' ''moothie,'' and ''French harp''.\n\n==History==\nThe harmonica was developed in Europe in the early part of the 19th century. Free-reed instruments like the Chinese [[sheng (instrument)|sheng]] were fairly common in Asia since ancient times. They became relatively well known in Europe after being introduced by the French Jesuit [[Jean Joseph Marie Amiot]] (1718-1793), who lived in [[Qianlong Emperor|Qing-era]] China.<ref name=\"The Encyclopedia of the Harmonica\">[http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/NewDesign/fintro.files/bintro.files/operas/Indes_galantes_Les%28The_Gallant_Indies%29.htm \"Indes galantes, Les (The Gallant Indies,\"] Naxos.com website (accessed 1 September 2016).</ref> Around 1820, free-reed designs began being created in Europe. [[Christian Buschmann|Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann]] is often cited as the inventor of the harmonica in 1821, but other inventors developed similar instruments at the same time.<ref>[[Conny Restle]]: In aller Munde, S. 43, Staatl. Institut f\u00fcr Musikforschung, Berlin 2003.</ref> Mouth-blown free-reed instruments appeared in the United States, South America, the United Kingdom and Europe at roughly the same time. These instruments were made for playing classical music.\n\n===Early instruments===\nThe harmonica first appeared in Vienna, where harmonicas with chambers were sold before 1824 (see also [[Anton Reinlein]] and [[Anton Haeckl]]). Richter tuning, invented by Joseph Richter (who also is credited with inventing the blow and draw mechanism), was created in 1826 and was eventually adopted nearly universally. In Germany, violin manufacturer Mr. Meisel from Klingenthal bought a harmonica with chambers (Kanzellen) at the Exhibition in Braunschweig in 1824. He and the ironworker Langhammer copied the instruments in the Graslitz three miles away; by 1827 they had produced hundreds of harmonicas. Many others followed in Germany and also nearby in what would later become Czechoslovakia. In 1829, Johann Wilhelm Rudolph Glier also began making harmonicas.\n\nIn 1830, Christian Messner, a cloth maker and weaver from [[Trossingen]], copied a harmonica his neighbour had brought from Vienna. He had such success that eventually his brother and some relatives also started to make harmonicas. From 1840 onwards, his nephew Christian Weiss was also involved in the business. By 1855, there were at least three harmonica-making businesses: [[C. A. Seydel S\u00f6hne]], [[Christian Messner]] & Co., and W\u00fcrtt. Harmonikafabrik Ch. Weiss. (Currently, only [[C. A. Seydel S\u00f6hne|C.A. Seydel]] is still in business.) Owing to competition between the harmonica factories in Trossingen and Klingenthal, machines were invented to punch the covers for the reeds.\n\nIn 1857, Matthias Hohner, a clockmaker from Trossingen, started producing harmonicas. Eventually he became the first to mass-produce them. He used a mass-produced wooden comb that he had made by machine-cutting firms. By 1868, he began supplying the United States. By the 1920s, the diatonic harmonica had largely reached its modern form. Other types followed soon thereafter, including the various tremolo and [[octave]] harmonicas.\n\nBy the late 19th century, harmonica production was a big business, having evolved into mass production. New designs were still developed in the 20th century, including the [[chromatic harmonica]], first made by Hohner in 1924, the bass harmonica, and the chord harmonica. In the 21st century, radical new designs have been developed and are still being introduced into the market, such as the [[Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation|Suzuki]] Overdrive, Hohner XB-40, and the ill-fated Harrison B-Radical.\n\nDiatonic harmonicas were designed primarily for playing German and other European [[folk music]] and have succeeded well in those styles. Over time, the basic design and tuning proved adaptable to other types of music such as the [[blues]], [[country music|country]], old-time and more. The harmonica was a success almost from the very start of production, and while the center of the harmonica business has shifted from Germany, the output of the various harmonica manufacturers is still very high. Major companies are now found in Germany ([[:de:C. A. Seydel S\u00f6hne|Seydel]], Bushman, [[Hohner]] \u2013 the dominant manufacturer in the world), Japan ([[Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation|Suzuki]], [[Tombo Musical Instrument Company|Tombo]] \u2013 the manufacturer of the popular [[Lee Oskar]] harmonica, and [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] also made harmonicas until the 1970s), China (Huang, Easttop, Johnson, Leo Shi, [[Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation|Suzuki]], Hohner, Swan, AXL), and [[Brazil]] (Hering, Bends). The United States had two significant harmonica manufacturers, and both were based in [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union, New Jersey]]. One was [[Magnus Harmonica Corporation]], whose founder Finn Magnus is credited with the development of plastic harmonica reeds. The other was Wm. Kratt Company, which, founded by German-American William Jacob \"Bill\" Kratt Sr., originally made [[pitch pipe]]s and later, in 1952, secured a patent for combs made of plastic. Both companies ceased harmonica production. The only recent American contender in the harmonica market was Harrison Harmonicas, which folded in July 2011. It was announced soon thereafter that the rights to the Harrison design had been sold to another company to finish production of orders already placed. In October 2012, it was revealed that a [[Beloit, Wisconsin]], investment corporation, R&R Opportunities, had bought the assets of Harrison Harmonicas and that a feasibility study was under way to assess the possibilities of continued production of the Harrison B-Radical harmonica. Recently, responding to increasingly demanding performance techniques, the market for high-quality instruments has grown.\n\n===Europe and North America===\nSome time before Hohner began manufacturing harmonicas in 1857, he shipped some to relatives who had emigrated to the United States. Its music rapidly became popular, and the country became an enormous market for Hohner's goods. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] carried a harmonica in his pocket,<ref>[http://www.hohnerusa.com/ahistory.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127182041/http://www.hohnerusa.com/ahistory.htm |date=January 27, 2007 }}</ref> and harmonicas provided solace to soldiers on both the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sides of the [[American Civil War]]. Frontiersmen [[Wyatt Earp]] and [[Billy the Kid]] played the instrument, and it became a fixture of the American musical landscape.\n\nHarmonicas were heard on a handful of recordings in the early 1900s, generally labeled as a \"mouth organ\". The first jazz or traditional music recordings of harmonicas were made in the U.S. in the mid-1920s. Recordings known at the time as \"race records\", intended for the black market of the southern states, included solo recordings by [[DeFord Bailey]] and duo recordings with a guitarist ([[Hammie Nixon]], [[Big Walter Horton|Walter Horton]], or [[Sonny Terry]]). [[Hillbilly]] styles were also recorded, intended for white audiences, by [[Frank Hutchison]], [[Gwen Foster]] and several other musicians. There are also recordings featuring the harmonica in [[jug band]]s, of which the [[Memphis Jug Band]] is the most famous. But the harmonica still represented a toy instrument in those years and was associated with the poor. It is also during those years that musicians started experimenting with new techniques such as tongue-blocking, hand effects and the most important innovation of all, the second position, or cross-harp.\n\nA significant contributor to the expanding popularity of the harmonica was a New York-based radio program called the ''Hohner Harmony Hour'', which taught listeners how to play. Listeners could play along with the program to increase their proficiency. The radio program gained wide popularity after the unveiling of the 1925 White House Christmas tree, which was adorned with fifty harmonicas.\n\nThe harmonica's versatility brought it to the attention of classical musicians during the 1930s. American [[Larry Adler]] was one of the first harmonica players to perform major works written for the instrument by the composers [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Malcolm Arnold]], [[Darius Milhaud]], and [[Arthur Benjamin]].\n\nHarmonicas were in short supply in the United States during [[World War II]]. Wood and metal materials for harmonicas were in short supply because of military demand. Furthermore, the primary harmonica manufacturers were based in Germany and Japan, the enemies of the United States and the Allied forces in the war. During this time, Finn Haakon Magnus, a Danish-American factory worker and entrepreneur, developed and perfected the molded plastic harmonica. The plastic harmonica used molded plastic combs and far fewer pieces than traditional metal or wood harmonicas, which made the harmonica more economical to mass-produce and more sanitary. Though the plastic reeds in these harmonicas produced a less distinctive (and, to many ears, inferior) sound than their metallic counterparts, [[Magnus Harmonica Corporation|Magnus harmonicas]] and several imitators soon became commonplace, particularly among children.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YyEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA244&lpg=RA1-PA244&dq=Finn+Haakon+Magnus&source=bl&ots=kYehT3zxkD&sig=FBKN1OxaVI_PhJEjOZGp0qbPJuc&hl=en&ei=ELIXTIeKFsG88ga_5JytCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Finn%20Haakon%20Magnus&f=false |title=Popular Science \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}</ref> The patent for the plastic comb, however, was awarded to William Kratt of Wm. Kratt Company in 1952. During World War II, the [[United States Department of Defense|War Department]] allotted a rationed supply of brass to Kratt's factory so they could continue to produce harmonicas that the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] distributed to American troops overseas to boost morale.\n\n===East Asia===\nIn 1898, the harmonica was brought to Japan, where the Tremolo harmonica was the most popular instrument. After about 30 years, the Japanese developed scale tuning and semitone harmonicas that could play Japanese folk songs.\n\n==== Japanese style tremolo harmonica tuning ====\nIn Europe and the United States, tremolo harmonica uses the Richter tuning, developed in Germany. In 1913, Sh\u014dgo Kawaguchi ({{lang|ja|\u5ddd\u53e3\u7ae0\u543e}}), known in Japan as the \"Father of the harmonica\", devised an alternate tuning, which is more suited to playing Japanese folk tunes. This tuning is also suited to local music throughout East Asia, and harmonicas using the tuning became popular in the region.\n\n==== Minor key harmonica tuning ====\nInitial diatonic harmonica tunings were major key only. In 1931, Hider\u014d Sat\u014d ({{lang|ja|\u4f50\u85e4\u79c0\u5eca}}) announced the development of a minor key harmonica. There are two types of minor key tunings, \"natural minor\" suitable for folk and contemporary music, and Latin American music, and the \"harmonic minor\" suitable for Japanese folk music.\n\n====The harmonica in Hong Kong \u2013 China====\nThe harmonica started to gain popularity in Hong Kong in the 1930s.  Individual tremolo harmonica players from China moved to Hong Kong and established numerous harmonica organizations such as The Chinese Y.M.C.A. Harmonica Orchestra, the China Harmonica Society,<ref>({{lang|zh-Hant|\u4e2d\u570b\u53e3\u7434\u793e}})</ref> and the Heart String Harmonica Society. During the 1950s, chromatic harmonica became popular in Hong Kong, and players such as [[Larry Adler]] and [[John Sebastian (classical harmonica player)|John Sebastian Sr.]] were invited to perform.\n\nLocal players such as Lau Mok ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5289\u7267}}) and Fung On ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u99ae\u5b89}}) promoted the chromatic harmonica. The chromatic harmonica gradually became the main instrument used by the Chinese Y.M.C.A. Harmonica Orchestra. The Chinese [[YMCA]] Harmonica Orchestra started in the 1960s, with 100 members, most of whom played harmonicas.<ref>The violin and viola were replaced by 12-hole and 16-hole chromonicas; cello by chord harmonica, contra bass and octave bass; double bass by octave bass; flute by pipe soprano; clarinet by pipe alto; trumpet by horn soprano; trombone by horn alto; oboe by melodica soprano; English horn by melodica alto; French horn by melodica professional.</ref> Non-harmonica instruments were also used, such as double bass, accordion, piano, and percussion such as timpani and xylophone.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Haletone Harmonica Orchestra ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u66c9\u5f64\u53e3\u7434\u968a}})<ref>[http://www.haletone.com/introeng.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221174146/http://www.haletone.com/introeng.html |date=February 21, 2009 }}</ref> was set up at Wong Tai Sin Community Centre. Fung On and others continued to teach harmonica and also set up harmonica orchestras. In the 1980s, numbers of harmonica students steadily decreased. In the 1990s, harmonica players from Hong Kong began to participate in international harmonica competitions, including the World Harmonica Festival in Germany and the [[Asia Pacific Harmonica Festival]]. In the 2000s, the Hong Kong Harmonica Association (H.K.H.A.) ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u9999\u6e2f\u53e3\u7434\u5354\u6703}}) was established.\n\nThe history of the harmonica in Taiwan began around 1945. By the 1980s, though, as living standards improved, many instruments once beyond the budgets of most Taiwanese started to become more accessible and popular in preference to the harmonica.\n\n==Medical use==\nPlaying the harmonica requires inhaling and exhaling strongly against resistance. This action helps develop a strong [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and deep breathing using the entire [[lung volume]]. [[human lung|Pulmonary]] specialists have noted that playing the harmonica resembles the kind of exercise used to [[Physical therapy#Cardiopulmonary physiotherapy|rehabilitate]] [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] patients such as using a PFLEX inspiratory muscle trainer or the inspiratory [[spirometer]]. Learning to play a musical instrument also offers motivation in addition to the exercise component. Many pulmonary rehabilitation programs {{specify|date=June 2012}} therefore have begun to incorporate the harmonica.<ref>{{cite web | title = Harmonica For Fun & Health Classes | publisher = Harmonica Masterclass | url = http://www.harmonicamasterclass.com/pulm.htm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060630001951/http://harmonicamasterclass.com/pulm.htm | archivedate = 2006-06-30 | df =  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite press release | title = When breathing needs a tune-up, harmonica class hits all the right notes | date = September 28, 2005 | publisher = University of Michigan | url = http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2005/hmharmonica.htm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060524095509/http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2005/hmharmonica.htm | archivedate = May 24, 2006 | df =  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title = Pulmonologists Treat Breath Shortness with Harmonica Classes | date = January 1, 2006 | publisher = American Institute of Physics | url = http://www.aip.org/dbis/stories/2006/15114.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060617150522/http://aip.org/dbis/stories/2006/15114.html | archivedate = June 17, 2006 | df =  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title = Using the Harmonica in Physical Therapy.

Indeed, the similarities between harmonicas and so-called \"diatonic\" [[accordions]] or melodeons is such that in German the name for the former is \"Mundharmonika\" and the latter \"Handharmonika,\" which translate as \"mouth harmonica\" and \"hand harmonica.\" In Scandinavian languages, an accordion is called variants of \"trekkspill\" (pull play) or \"trekkharmonika\" whereas a harmonica is called \"munnspill\" (mouth play) or \"mundharmonika\" (mouth harmonica). The names for the two instruments in the Slavic languages are also either similar or identical. The harmonica shares similarities to all other free-reed instruments by virtue of the method of sound production.\n\nThe [[glass harmonica]] has the word \"harmonica\" in its name, but it is not related to free-reed instruments. The glass harmonica is a musical instrument formed from a nested set of graduated glass cups mounted sideways on an axle. Each of the glass cups is tuned to a different note, and they are arranged in a scalar order. It is played by touching the rotating cups with wetted fingers, causing them to vibrate and produce a sustained \"singing\" tone.\n\n==Notation==\n\n===Tablature===\n[[Tabulature|Tablature]] notation (often abbreviated as \"tab\") is a method of writing melodies by indicating where the notes are played on the instrument, rather than by indicating the pitches with circles and note heads printed on a staff, as with standard notation. One of the advantages of tab is that it can be easier for performers without formal training to learn, because the notation directly indicates where to play the note.\n\nWhile tab is most often associated with fretted stringed instruments such as the guitar, tab is also used with other instruments such as the organ and harmonica.\n\nThere are many harmonica tab systems in use. A simple tab system appears as follows:\n\nDiatonic Harmonica tab:\n\n  2  = blow the 2 hole < Also: +2 >\n -2  = draw the 2 hole\n -2' = draw the 2 hole with a half bend < Also -2b >\n -2\" = draw the 2 hole with a full bend < Also -2bb>\n\nChords are shown by grouping notes with parentheses\n\n(2 3) = blow the 2 hole and the 3 hole at the same time\n\nChromatic Harmonica tab:\n\n   2 = blow the 2 hole\n  -2 = draw the 2 hole\n  <2 = blow the 2 hole with the button in\n <-2 = draw the 2 hole with the button in\n\nHarmonica tab is usually aligned with lyrics to show the tune and the timing, and usually states the key of the harmonica required for the song.\n\nComplete example of harmonica tab:\n<pre>\nCockles And Mussels (Molly Malone):\n6  7  7     7    7 8   7     -8    -8  -8 -8  -9\nIn Dublin's fair city, where girls are so pretty,\n-8 9    9   9  9     9  7     -8 8  7 -8\nI first set my sight on sweet Molly Malone.\n6   7   7 7   7  8    7   -8    -8     -8 -9\nShe was a fishmonger, and she'd stroll along,\n8   8    9  8    7   9  8     7 -8   8 -8   7\nSinging \"Cockles And Mussels, Alive, Alive, Oh.\"\n6 7   7 7   -8 8  7 -8  -8 -8 -8 8\nAlive alive oh-oh Alive alive oh-oh\n7   7   9   8   7   9  8    7 -8  8 -8  7\nSinging Cockles and Mussels alive alive oh\n</pre>\n\n===Regular notation===\nA number (sometimes inside a circle) appears below each note in otherwise conventional [[sheet music]], and indicates which number hole to play.

Whichever was taxed made the brewer then quickly switch to the other. In Britain, hopped beer was first imported from Holland around 1400, yet hops were condemned as late as 1519 as a \"wicked and pernicious weed\".<ref>{{Cite book | author = Richard W.

There was no tax on hops to be paid to the Catholic church, unlike on gruit. For this reason the Protestants preferred hopped beer.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.academia.edu/28640210/The_Reformation_had_some_help_from_hops | title = The Reformation had some help from hops | author = Mika Rissanen | access-date = 2016-09-21 }}</ref>\n\nHops used in England were imported from France, Holland and Germany with [[import duty]] paid for those; it was not until 1524 that hops were first grown in the southeast of England ([[Kent]]) when they were introduced as an agricultural crop by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] farmers. Therefore, in the hop industry there are many words which originally were Dutch words (see [[oast house]]). Hops were then grown as far north as [[Aberdeen]], near breweries for convenience of infrastructure.\n\nAccording to [[Thomas Tusser]]'s 1557 ''Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry'':\n<blockquote>\"The hop for his profit I thus do exalt,<br/>It strengtheneth drink and it flavoureth malt;<br/>And being well-brewed long kept it will last,<br/>And drawing abide, if ye draw not too fast.\"<ref>{{Cite book|work=The [[Penny Magazine]]|title=Antiquity of Beer|author=Charles Knight|author-link=Charles Knight (publisher)|url=https://archive.org/stream/ThePennyMagazineOfTheSocietyForTheDiffusionOfUsefulKnowledge/ThePennyMagazineOfTheSocietyForTheDiffusionOfUsefulKnowledge1832#page/n15/mode/2up|year=1832|page=3}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn England there were many complaints over the quality of imported hops, the sacks of which were often contaminated by stalks, sand or straw to increase their weight.

Each spring, the roots send forth new [[bine (botany)|bine]]s that are started up strings from the ground to an overhead trellis. The cones grow high on the [[bine (botany)|bine]], and in the past, these cones were picked by hand. Harvesting of hops became much more efficient with the invention of the mechanical hops separator, patented by [[Emil Clemens Horst]] in 1909.\n\nHarvest comes near the end of summer when the bines are pulled down and the flowers are taken to a hop house or [[oast house]] for drying. Hop houses are two-story buildings, of which the upper story has a slatted floor covered with burlap. Here the flowers are poured out and raked even. A heating unit on the lower floor is used to dry the hops. When dry, the hops are moved to a press, a sturdy box with a plunger. Two long pieces of burlap are laid into the hop press at right angles, the hops are poured in and compressed into bales.\n\nHop cones contain different oils, such as lupulin, a yellowish, waxy substance, an [[oleoresin]], that imparts flavour and aroma to beer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andrew|first=Sewalish|title=Hops: Anatomy and Chemistry 101|url=http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2009/sewalish_andr/Humulus%20Lupulus%20-%20Common%20Hops/Hop%20Anatomy%20and%20Chemistry%20101.html|accessdate=2013-09-13}}</ref> Lupulin contains lupulone and [[humulone]], which possess antibiotic properties, suppressing bacterial growth favoring brewer's yeast to grow.

European (so-called \"noble\") hops typically average 5\u20139% alpha acids by weight (AABW), and the newer American [[cultivar]]s typically range from 8\u201319% AABW. Aroma hops usually have a lower concentration of alpha acids (~5%) and are the primary contributors of hop aroma and (nonbitter) flavour. Bittering hops are boiled for a longer period of time, typically 60\u201390 minutes, to maximize the isomerization of the alpha acids. They often have inferior aromatic properties, as the aromatic compounds evaporate during the boil.\n\nThe degree of bitterness imparted by hops depends on the degree to which [[alpha acid]]s are [[isomer]]ized during the boil, and the impact of a given amount of hops is specified in [[International Bitterness Units scale|International Bitterness Units]]. Unboiled hops are only mildly [[bitter (taste)|bitter]]. On the other hand, the nonbitter flavour and aroma of hops come from the essential oils, which evaporate during the boil.\n\nAroma hops are typically added to the wort later to prevent the evaporation of the essential oils, to impart \"hop taste\" (if during the final 30 minutes of boil) or \"hop aroma\" (if during the final 10 minutes, or less, of boil). {{anchor|DryHopping}}Aroma hops are often added after the wort has cooled and while the beer ferments, a technique known as \"dry hopping\", which contributes to the hop aroma. [[Farnesene]] is a major component in some hops.<ref name=schon/> The composition of hop essential oils can differ between varieties and between years in the same variety, having a significant influence on flavour and aroma.<ref name=schon/>\n\n[[File:Hops Lupulin Macro.jpg|thumb|Macro shot of lupulin on a hops cone]]\n\nToday, a substantial amount of \"dual-use\" hops are used, as well. These have high concentrations of alpha acids and good aromatic properties. These can be added to the boil at any time, depending on the desired effect.<ref>{{Cite book\n | author = John Palmer | title = How to Brew | publisher = Brewers Publications | year = 2006 | location = Boulder, CO\n | pages = 41\u201344 | url = http://www.howtobrew.com/ | isbn = 0-937381-88-8}}</ref> Hop acids also contribute to and stabilize the foam qualities of beer.<ref name=schon/>\n\nFlavours and aromas are described appreciatively using terms which include \"grassy\", \"floral\", \"citrus\", \"spicy\", \"piney\", \"lemony\", \"grapefruit\", and \"earthy\".<ref name=schon/><ref>{{cite book|vauthors = Hough JS, Briggs DE, Stevens R, Young TW|title=Malting and Brewing Science: Volume II Hopped Wort and Beer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZZPTBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA867|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4615-1799-3|pages=867\u2013}}</ref>\nMany [[pale lager]]s have fairly low hop influence, while lagers marketed as [[Pilsener]] or brewed in the Czech Republic may have noticeable noble hop aroma. Certain [[ale]]s (particularly the highly hopped style known as [[India Pale Ale]], or IPA) can have high levels of hop bitterness.\n\nBrewers may use [[software]] tools to control the bittering levels in the boil and adjust recipes to account for a change in the hop bill or seasonal variations in the crop that may lead to the need to compensate for a difference in alpha acid contribution. Data may be shared with other brewers via [[BeerXML]] allowing the reproduction of a recipe allowing for differences in hop availability.\n\n==Varieties==\n{{Main article|List of hop varieties}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Breeding programs===\nThere are many different varieties of hops used in brewing today. Historically, hops varieties were identified by geography (such as Hallertau, Spalt, and Tettnang from Germany), by the farmer who is recognized as first cultivating them (such as Goldings or Fuggles from England), or by their growing habit (e. g., Oregon Cluster).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.breweryhistory.com/journal/archive/121/bh-121-094.htm|title=Brewery History: 121, pp. 94-112|website=www.breweryhistory.com|access-date=2017-06-02}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nAround 1900, a number of institutions began to experiment with breeding specific hop varieties. The breeding program at [[Wye College]] in [[Wye, Kent]] was started in 1904 and rose to prominence through the work of Prof. [[E. S. Salmon]]. Salmon released [[List of hop varieties#Brewer's Gold|Brewer's Gold]] and Brewer's Favorite for commercial cultivation in 1934, and went on to release more than two dozen new cultivars before his death in 1959. Brewer's Gold has become the ancestor of the bulk of new hop releases around the world since its release.<ref name=\"IBD APac\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britishhops.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Asia-Pacific-Final-Paper.pdf |title=What makes British Hops Unique in the world of Hop Growing? |last1=Capper |first1=Allison |last2=Darby |first2=Peter |date=24 March 2014 |website=British Hop Association |accessdate=4 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725154905/http://www.britishhops.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Asia-Pacific-Final-Paper.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nWye College continued its breeding program and again received attention in the 1970s, when Dr. Ray A. Neve released Wye [[List of hop varieties#Target|Target]], Wye [[Challenger hop|Challenger]], Wye [[List of hop varieties#Northdown|Northdown]], Wye [[List of hop varieties#Saxon|Saxon]] and Wye [[List of hop varieties#Yeoman|Yeoman]]. More recently, Wye College and its successor institution Wye Hops Ltd., have focused on breeding the first [[dwarfing|dwarf]] hop varieties, which are easier to pick by machine and far more economical to grow.<ref name=\"Brit Hops History\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britishhops.org.uk/history-of-hops/ |title=History of Hops |website=British Hop Association |accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref> Wye College have also been responsible for breeding hop varieties that will grow with only 12 hours of daily light for the South African hop farmers. Wye College was closed in 2009 but the legacy of their hop breeding programs, particularly that of the dwarf varieties, is continuing as already the U.S.A. private and public breeding programs are using their stock material.\n\nParticular hop varieties are associated with beer regions and styles, for example [[pale lager]]s are usually brewed with European (often German, Polish or Czech) noble hop varieties such as [[Saaz hops|Saaz]], Hallertau and Strissel Spalt. [[Beer in England|British ales]] use hop varieties such as Fuggles, Goldings and W.G.V. [[Beer in the United States|North American beers]] often use [[Cascade hops]], Columbus hops, Centennial hops, Willamette, [[Amarillo hops]] and about forty more varieties as the U.S.A. have lately been the more significant breeders of new hop varieties, including dwarf hop varieties.\n\nHops from New Zealand, such as Pacific Gem, Motueka and Nelson Sauvin, are used in a \"Pacific Pale Ale\" style of beer with increasing production in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontrade.co.uk/Backissues/Totp2014/files/assets/common/downloads/The_OnTrade_Preview_2014.pdf|title=On Trade Preview 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ontrade.co.uk|access-date=}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Noble hops===\n[[File:Hopfengarten.jpg|thumb|right|Mature hops growing in a hop yard in Germany]]\n\nThe term \"noble hops\" traditionally refers to varieties of hops which are low in bitterness and high in [[aroma]]. They are the European [[cultivar]]s or races Hallertau, Tettnanger, Spalt, and [[Saaz hops|Saaz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.czhops.cz/index.php/en |title=Hop growers union of the Czech Republic |publisher=Czhops.cz |accessdate=2012-05-20}}</ref>\n\nTheir low relative bitterness but strong aroma are often distinguishing characteristics of European-style [[lager]]s, such as [[Pilsener]], [[Dunkel]], and [[M\u00e4rzen|Oktoberfest/M\u00e4rzen]]. In beer, they are considered aroma hops (as opposed to bittering hops); see [[Pilsner Urquell]] as a classic example of the Bohemian Pilsener style, which showcases noble hops.\n\nAs with grapes, the location where hops are grown affects the hops' characteristics. Much as [[Dortmunder (beer)|Dortmunder beer]] may within the EU be labelled \"Dortmunder\" only if it has been brewed in [[Dortmund]], noble hops may officially be considered \"noble\" only if they were grown in the areas for which the hop varieties ([[Race (biology)|races]]) were named.\n\n* '''Hallertau''' or '''Hallertauer''' \u2013 The original German lager hop; named after [[Hallertau]] or Holledau region in central Bavaria. Due to susceptibility to crop disease, it was largely replaced by [[Hersbruck]]er in the 1970s and 1980s. (Alpha acid 3.5\u20135.5% / beta acid 3\u20134%)\n* '''\u017datec (Saaz)''' \u2013 Noble hop, named after [[\u017datec]] town, used extensively in Bohemia to flavour pale Czech lagers such as [[Pilsner Urquell]]. Soft aroma and bitterness. (Alpha acid 3\u20134.5% /Beta acid 3\u20134.5%)\n* '''Spalt''' \u2013 Traditional German noble hop from the [[Spalt]]er region south of Nuremberg. With a delicate, spicy aroma. (Alpha acid 4\u20135% / beta acid 4\u20135%)\n* '''Tettnang''' \u2013 Comes from [[Tettnang]], a small town in southern [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] in Germany. The region produces significant quantities of hops, and ships them to [[brewery|breweries]] throughout the world. Noble German dual-use hop used in European pale lagers, sometimes with Hallertau. Soft bitterness. (Alpha acid 3.5\u20135.5% / beta acid 3.5\u20135.5%)\n\nEnglish noble varieties are Fuggle, East Kent Goldings and Goldings. They are characterized through analysis as having an alpha:beta ratio of 1:1, low alpha-acid levels (2\u20135%) with a low cohumulone content, low myrcene in the hop oil, high humulene in the oil, a ratio of humulene:caryophyllene above three, and poor storability resulting in them being more prone to oxidation. In reality, this means they have a relatively consistent bittering potential as they age, due to beta-acid oxidation, and a flavour that improves as they age during periods of poor storage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byo.com/stories/article/indices/18-brewing-science/853-hop-chemistry-homebrew-science |title=Hop Chemistry: Homebrew Science |publisher=Byo.com |date=2000-04-28 |accessdate=2012-05-20}}</ref>\n\n==Other uses==\n[[File:2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol.svg|thumbnail|right|2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol]]\n\nIn addition to beer, hops are used in [[herbal tea]]s and in soft drinks.

The Walt Disney Productions Story Dept. on February 5, 1937, sent Taliaferro a memo recognizing him as the source of the idea for the planned short, ''[[Donald's Nephews]]''. The nephews debuted in Taliaferro's comic strip, which by this time had been renamed ''[[Donald Duck]]'', on Sunday, October 17, 1937, beating the theatrical release of ''Donald's Nephews'' by almost six months. According to Don Rosa, Carl Barks has claimed that in fact they were his creation while working as a writer on Donald Duck animated cartoons in 1937.<ref>[http://www10.dict.cc/wp_examples.php?lp_id=1&lang=en&s=Huey,%20Dewey%20and%20Louie]</ref>{{better source|date=October 2017}} The names were devised by Disney gag man Dana Coty, who took them from [[Huey Long]], [[Thomas Dewey]], and Louis Schmitt, an animator at the Disney Studio in the 1930s and 1940s. Taliaferro's introduction of the nephews emulated the three nephews in the [[Happy Hooligan]] comic strip and was also influenced by Mickey Mouse's nephews, [[Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse]].<ref>Thomas Andrae,\"The Legacy of Al Taliaferro,\" in ''Disney's Four Color Adventures'' vol. 1 (2011).</ref>\n\nIn translations of Disney works the nephews have different local-sounding names that often follow the repetition ([[parachesis]]) of the English names. Examples include Hugo, Paco and Luis (Latin American Spanish); Jorgito, Juanito and Jaimito (European Spanish); Huguinho, Luizinho and Zezinho (Brazilian Portuguese); Billy, Willie and Dilly (Russian); Hyzio, Dyzio, and Zyzio (Polish); Tick, Trick and Track (German); Riri, Fifi and Loulou (French); Qui, Quo e Qua (Italian); ''Karkur'', ''Farfur'', and ''Zarzur'' (Arabic). \n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Character background===\n:''Further information: [[Duck family (Disney)#Della Duck|Duck family (Disney) \u00a7 Della Duck]] and [[Duck family (Disney)#Huey, Dewey, and Louie's father|\u00a7 Huey, Dewey, and Louie's father]]''\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie are the sons of Donald's sister Della Duck; in ''Donald's Nephews'', their mother is instead named Dumbella. In the original theatrical shorts, they were originally sent to visit Donald for only one day; in the comics, the three were sent to stay with Donald on a temporary basis, until their father came back from the hospital (the boys ended up sending him there after a [[practical joke]] of putting [[firecracker]]s under his chair). In both the comics and animated shorts, the boys' parents were never heard from or mentioned again after these instances, with the boys ending up permanently living with Donald. All four of them live in the fictional city of [[Donald Duck universe#Duckburg|Duckburg]], in the fictional state of Calisota.\n\nThe three ducklings are noted for their identical appearances and personalities. A running joke involves the three sometimes even finishing each other's sentences. In the theatrical shorts, Huey, Dewey, and Louie often behave in a rambunctious and mischievous manner, and they sometimes commit retaliation or revenge on their uncle Donald Duck. In the comics, however, as developed by [[Al Taliaferro]] and [[Carl Barks]], the young ducks are more usually portrayed as well-behaved, preferring to assist their uncle Donald Duck and great-uncle [[Scrooge McDuck]] in the adventure at hand. In the early Barks comics, the ducklings were still wild and unruly, but their character improved considerably due to their membership in the [[Junior Woodchucks]] and the good influence of their wise old great-grandmother [[Elvira Coot]] \"Grandma\" Duck. According to Don Rosa, Huey, Dewey and Louie became members of the Junior Woodchucks when they were around 11 years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://duckman.pettho.com/characters/hdl.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114062922/http://duckman.pettho.com/characters/hdl.html |archivedate=2011-01-14 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Colors of Huey, Dewey, and Louie's outfits===\n[[File:Return to Plain Awful - Huey Dewey and Louie.jpg|thumb|[[Self-referential humor]]: Scrooge with Huey, Dewey, and Louie in \"[[Return to Plain Awful]]\" (1989) by Don Rosa]]\n\nIn early comic books and shorts, the caps of Huey, Dewey, and Louie were colored randomly, depending on the whim of the colorist.\n\nOn few occasions until 1945 and most every cartoon short afterward, all three nephews wore identical outfits (most commonly red). It wasn't until the 1980s when it became established that Huey is dressed in [[red]], Dewey in [[blue]], and Louie in [[green]]. Disney's archivist [[Dave Smith (archivist)|Dave Smith]], in \"Disney A to Z,\" said, \"Note that the brightest hue of the three is red (Huey), the color of water, dew, is blue (Dewey), and that leaves Louie, and leaves are green.\" A few random combinations appear in early Disney merchandise and books, such as orange and yellow. Another combination that shows up from time to time is Huey in blue, Dewey in green, and Louie in red. In-story, this inconsistency is explained away as a result of the ducklings borrowing each other's clothes.\n\nIn Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge comics the trio have occasionally been known to dress in their usual outfits, but rather than have their usual colors they all wear black (or the same dark color), rendering them visually identical, leaving their hat color available if they care to be distinguished.\n\nOne story in Donald Duck comics was based around Donald spending so much time trying to tell his three nephews apart that he developed a heightened sense of sight.\n\n===Voices===\n[[Clarence Nash]], Donald's voice actor, gave the voices to the boys in the cartoon shorts, making them just as unintelligible as Donald's. Huey, Dewey, and Louie were all voiced by [[Russi Taylor]] in ''DuckTales''. In ''Quack Pack'', they were voiced by [[Jeannie Elias]], [[Pamela Segall]], and [[Elizabeth Daily]], respectively. [[Tony Anselmo]] voiced the characters in ''Down and Out with Donald Duck'' (1987), ''Mickey Mouse Works'' and ''Disney's House of Mouse'', but Russi Taylor still voices the trio in other projects, such as the video games ''[[Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers]]'' and ''[[Mickey's Speedway USA]]'', and the [[direct-to-video]] films ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas|Mickey's Once]]'' and ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas|Twice Upon a Christmas]]''. Russi Taylor also reprised her role as the nephews in the ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]'' video game and the post-2013 ''[[Disney Mickey Mouse|Mickey Mouse]]'' shorts. [[Danny Pudi]], [[Ben Schwartz]] and [[Bobby Moynihan]] are voicing the brothers in the 2017 reboot.\n\n===Phooey Duck===\n[[File:Phooey Duck1.gif|thumb|Panel with Huey, Dewey, and Louie along with a fourth nephew, Phooey Duck]]\nOn a few occasions, an artist by error drew four nephews and the error was not noticed but was published. This fourth nephew has been named '''[[Duck family (Disney)#Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck|Phooey Duck]]''' by Disney comic editor Bob Foster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nafsk.se/pipermail/dcml/2006-January/023922.html|title=Mailing list entry from writer Lars Jensen, near bottom of entry|first=Lars|last=Jensen|date=27 January 2006|website=nafsk.se|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivanet.com/duckburg/phooey.htm|title=Phooey ~ the 4th Nephew!|first=Katie|last=Sullivan|date=|website=www.sullivanet.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nOne short [[Egmont (media group)|Egmont]]-licensed Disney comic (called ''Much Ado About Phooey'' in the English-language version) used Phooey as a character and explained Phooey's sporadic appearances as a freak incident of nature. (The Swedish text in the two speech balloons says \"It is a fourth nephew! An exact copy of the others! / Yes, it's probably best that I explain\".)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coa.inducks.org/s.php?c=D+97589|title=Much Ado About Phooey - I.N.D.U.C.K.S.|author=|date=|website=coa.inducks.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Character appearances==\n\n===Films===\nAfter the era of theatrical shorts ended, they appeared in:\n*''[[Donald Duck Presents]]'' (1983)\n*''[[DuckTales]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'' (1987)\n*''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp]]'' (1990)\n*''[[Quack Pack]]'' (1996)\n*''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' (1999)\n*''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (1999)\n*''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]'' (2001)\n*''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'' (2001)\n*''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (2004)\n\nIn the 1988 film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', Huey, Dewey, and Louie appear in a picture on a newspaper in Eddie Valiant's office. In 1990, the boys also made an appearance in the anti-drug TV special ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]]''. Furthermore, they also appeared in Duck Tales the movie where they go on a treasure hunt with their Uncle Scrooge and end befriending a kindhearted Genie. As the movie progresses, they make unimaginable wishes and end up having to help Uncle Scrooge face an old enemy. They also make a cameo in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''.\n\n====List of animated short films====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!#||Short film||Date||Shirt Colours||Notes\n|-\n|1||''[[Donald's Nephews]]''||April 15, 1938||Red, Green, Orange||\n|-\n|2||''[[Good Scouts]]''||July 8, 1938||All scout uniforms||\n|-\n|3||''[[Donald's Golf Game]]''||November 4, 1938||Red, Yellow, Orange||\n|-\n|4||''[[The Hockey Champ]]''||April 28, 1939||Red, Green, Orange||\n|-\n|5||''[[Sea Scouts (film)|Sea Scouts]]''||June 30, 1939||All Red||\n|-\n|6||''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]''||June 7, 1940||Yellow, Green, Red||Also starring [[Daisy Duck]]\n|-\n|7||''[[Fire Chief (Animated short)|Fire Chief]]''||December 13, 1940||Red, Yellow, Blue/All Red||\n|-\n|8||''All Together''||13 January 1942||All Red||A WWII Cartoon\n|-\n|9||''[[The Nifty Nineties]]''||June 20, 1941||All Blue||A Mickey Mouse Cartoon\n|-\n|10||''[[Truant Officer Donald]]''||August 1, 1941||Red, Green, Orange||\n|-\n|11||''[[Donald's Snow Fight]]''||April 10, 1942||Red, Green, Orange||\n|-\n|12||''[[Home Defense]]''||November 26, 1943||All Red||\n|-\n|13||''[[Donald Duck and the Gorilla]]''||March 31, 1944||Red, Yellow, Green||\n|-\n|14||''[[Donald's Off Day]]''||December 8, 1944||All Red||\n|-\n|15||''[[Donald's Crime]]''||June 29, 1945||Red, Green, Orange||Also starring Daisy Duck\n|-\n|16||''[[Straight Shooters]]''||April 18, 1947||All Red||\n|-\n|17||''[[Soup's On]]''||October 15, 1948||All Red||\n|-\n|18||''[[Donald's Happy Birthday]]''||February 11, 1949||All Red||\n|-\n|19||''[[Lion Around]]''||January 20, 1950||All Red||\n|-\n|20||''[[Lucky Number (Disney)|Lucky Number]]''||July 20, 1951||All Red||\n|-\n|21||''[[Trick or Treat (1952 film)|Trick or Treat]]''||October 10, 1952||Various Halloween costumes || Also starring [[Witch Hazel (Disney)|Witch Hazel]]\n|-\n|22||''[[Don's Fountain of Youth]]''||May 30, 1953||All Red||\n|-\n|23||''[[Canvas Back Duck]]''||December 25, 1953||All Red||Also starring [[Peg Leg Pete]]\n|-\n|24||''[[Spare the Rod (cartoon)|Spare the Rod]]''||January 15, 1954||All Green/Red||\n|-\n|25||''[[Donald's Diary]]''||March 5, 1954||All Light Blue||Also starring [[Daisy Duck]]; Huey, Dewey and Louie (who are not named) are Daisy's little brothers and not Donald's nephews\n|-\n|26||''[[The Litterbug]]''||June 21, 1961||Red, Yellow, Green||\n|-\n|27||''[[Donald's Fire Survival Plan]]''||1965||All Red||\n|}\n\nThey also appeared with [[Scrooge McDuck|Uncle Scrooge]] but without [[Donald Duck|Donald]] in ''[[Scrooge McDuck and Money]]''.\n\n=== Comics ===\nWithin the comics, Huey, Dewey, and Louie often play a major role in most stories involving either their uncle Donald or great-uncle Scrooge McDuck, accompanying them on most of their adventures. Also seen in the comics is the boys' membership in the [[Boy Scouts of America]]-like organization, [[the Junior Woodchucks]], including their use of the [[Junior Woodchucks Guidebook]], a manual containing all manner of information on virtually every subject possible (however, there are some resources, such as the ancient libraries of Tralla La, that hold information not found in the guidebook). This excellent youth organization, which has twin goals of preserving knowledge and preserving the environment, was instrumental in transforming the three brothers from little hellions to upstanding young ducks.\n\nIn Disney comic writer [[Don Rosa]]'s (unofficial) continuity, Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck were born around 1940 in Duckburg. True to his jocular style, Rosa occasionally makes subtle references to the untold mystery of the three boys' life: What became of their parents? In his epic comic series, ''[[Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'', Rosa pictures how Scrooge first met Donald and his nephews, saying: \"I'm not used to relatives, either! The few I had seem to have... disappeared!\" Huey, Dewey, and Louie answer: \"We know how ''that'' feels, Unca Scrooge!\"\n\nIn ''Some Heir Over the Rainbow'' by Carl Barks, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, along with [[Donald Duck]] and [[Gladstone Gander]], are tested by [[Scrooge McDuck]], who wants to pick an [[heir]] to his fortune. Using the legend of a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow, Scrooge secretly gives [[US$]] 3,000 (One thousand to Huey, Dewey, and Louie, another for Gladstone, and the last one for Donald). Donald uses his money for a down payment of a new car, now being $1,000 in debt. Gladstone, considering himself too lucky to need the money this soon, hides the money for when and if he needs it, causing Scrooge to consider him a better option than Donald. Huey, Dewey, and Louie lend their money to a man who claims to need the money to search for a treasure. Initially thinking they were tricked out of the money, Scrooge actually considers leaving his fortune to Gladstone, even though he sees that as ''\"an awful injustice to the world\"'', but the man actually finds the treasure and pays the kids back. Scrooge makes Huey, Dewey, and Louie his heirs. Although this is disregarded in a number of later comics, it seems to be the most solidly canon indication of Scrooge's plans.\n\n===Television===\n====''DuckTales''====\n{{Main|DuckTales|DuckTales (2017 TV series)}}\n[[File:Huey, Dewey and Louie in the 2017 reboot.png|thumb|right|Huey, Dewey and Louie in the 2017 reboot series]]\nThey later starred in the 1987 animated [[television]] series ''[[DuckTales]]'', in which they appeared in adventures with their great-uncle, Scrooge McDuck (Donald having enlisted in the [[U.S. Navy]]). The boys' personalities in this series were mainly based on their comic book appearances versus the theatrical shorts.\n\nA new adaptation of the series once again titled, ''[[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|DuckTales]]'' features the three brothers as well, albeit with distinct designs, voices, and personalities like in ''Quack Pack'', who move to Scrooge's house with Donald after the boat where they lived is destroyed by accident. In the new installment, the brothers also travel in adventures with Scrooge, now with Donald in tow. The first episode also shows an image of Della, the triplets' mother, who also traveled the world in adventures with Donald and Scrooge. This iteration also changed Dewey's real name to Dewford, while making Deuteronomy his middle name, and Louie's real name to Llywelyn, a fact which he seems to be embarrassed by.\n\n====''Quack Pack''====\n{{main|Quack Pack}}\n[[Image:QuackPack.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Huey, Dewey, and Louie as teenagers in ''[[Quack Pack]]''.]]\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie also starred in the 1990s series ''[[Quack Pack]]'', in which the three were portrayed as [[teenager]]s. In ''Quack Pack'', the boys were given distinct personalities, with Huey serving as the group's leader, Dewey as a computer whiz, and Louie as enjoying sports. After ''Quack Pack'', the boys were reverted to their original ages in future appearances, including 2000s series ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'', and then re-aged in ''[[House of Mouse]]''. On ''House of Mouse'', they served as the house band in a variety of different styles (most commonly as 'The Quackstreet Boys'). They also feature prominently, in a segment of the computer-animated film, ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' from 2004.\n\n===Video games===\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie appear in the third [[Disney's Magical Quest|''Magical Quest'']] game. The object of the game is to rescue them from the clutches of the [[villain]]ous [[Pete (Disney)|King Pete]]. The trio also appear in ''[[Quackshot]]'' piloting Donald's plane as he travels the world in search of a lost treasure.\n\nThey also appear in ''[[The Lucky Dime Caper]]'' for the Sega Master system, where they are kidnapped by Magica De Spell. Donald must find Scrooge's lucky dime and barter for their safety.\n\nThey also appear in ''[[Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers]]'', aiding Donald to rescue Daisy and beat Gladstone to her, while he rescues their hexed play toys.\n\nThey even appear in ''[[Mickey's Speedway USA]]'' as unlockable lightweight characters.\n\nThey also appear in [[DuckTales (video game)|''DuckTales'']], aiding their Uncle Scrooge in finding treasure.\n\nThey also appear on ''[[Dance Dance Revolution: Disney Mix]]'', where they appear as [[DJ]]'s on certain music tracks\n\n====''Kingdom Hearts''====\nIn ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' they work in the item shop in the First District of Traverse Town. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', they individually run an item shop (Huey), a weapon shop (Louie), and an accessory shop (Dewey) in Hollow Bastion/Radiant Garden. In both endings, they are all seen going back to Disney Castle. They reappear in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep]]'' in Disney Town, recreating Ice Cream flavors, this time with a speaking role. They appear once more in the mobile game ''[[Kingdom Hearts Unchained]]'' as special Support medals that grant the player's other medals a set amount of experience points based on the medal's star value.\n\n===Parks and attractions===\nHuey, Dewey and Louie appear as characters only at [[Tokyo Disney]] and [[Disneyland Paris]].\n\n====Tokyo Disney====\nHuey, Dewey and Louie only appeared in seasonal Parades Easter, Halloween and Christmas 2011 after a long absence. They also appeared in the Countdown Party Parade 2011.\n\n====Disneyland Paris====\nHuey, Dewey and Louie appear more regularly in Paris. They appeared during the Christmas season 2010 in their daytime and nighttime Parades at the Disneyland Park ''\"[[Disneyland Paris]]'s Magic Kingdom\"'' [[Disney's Once Upon a Dream Parade]] and in the [[Disney's Fantillusion]] Parade in glittery outfits. They made another appearance at [[Disneyland Paris]] for meet and greet at the [[Disneyland Hotel (Paris)|Disneyland Hotel]] on April 2, 2011 the day of the Press Event for the launch of their new season \"Magical Moments Festival\". They also appeared at the Disney's Once Upon a Dream Parade at the [[Disneyland|Disneyland Park]] in special outfits for the Parade and at the Disney's Stars 'n' Cars Parade at the [[Walt Disney Studios Park]] in a unique directors outfits.\n\nThe Three Nephews appeared at [[Disneyland Paris]]'s Halloween season 2011. they have their own show during \"Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Parties\" at the [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Park]] in [[Disneyland Paris]], titled \"Huey, Dewey and Louie's Trick or Treat Party\". They also made an appearance for meet and greet at [[Disneyland Paris]]'s \"Disney's Halloween Party\" on October 31, 2011. This is the first time ever that the three nephews appear for meet and greet at any of the Disney Parks for regular park guests. They were also part of the Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve 2011/2012 celebrations at the [[Disneyland Hotel (Paris)|Disneyland Hotel]].\n\n==Cultural influences==\n*In the 1972 science fiction film ''[[Silent Running]]'' directed by [[Douglas Trumbull]], the main character, Lowell, befriends three robot drones and renames them Huey, Dewey and Louie. Coincidentally, the drones appear in their semi-official colors: Huey is reddish-orange, Dewey is blue and Louie is green.\n*In the [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] television series ''[[Due South]]'', two of the detectives at the [[Chicago Police Department]] where the series takes place are named Jack Huey and Louis (Louie) Gardino. After season two, Gardino is replaced by Detective Thomas Dewey. They are often referred to as \"the duck boys\" by other characters.\n*In [[Finland]], the three main political parties, namely the [[National Coalition Party]], the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]], are sometimes [[sarcasm|sarcastically]] referred as ''Huey, Dewey, and Louie'', for there are allegedly no differences in their [[political agenda]]s. The joke is based on the fact that the parties use the same symbolic colours (blue&nbsp;\u2013 NCP, green&nbsp;\u2013 Centre, red&nbsp;\u2013 Social Democrats) as the three ducks' caps.\n*In the ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' episode \"Waltz for Venus,\" Spike and Faye capture three minor bounty heads named Louey, Huey, and Dewey.\n*They all appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"Some like it Hitman\" voiced by [[Seth Green]] (Huey and Dewey) and Sam Kwasman (Louie). In that sketch, they ask their Uncle Donald (also voiced by Kwasman) if they can see their mom ([[Della Duck]]) again.\n*The three prototypes of the MooresCloud [[ambient device]]s were named \"Huey, Dewey and Louie\" when first presented to the tech press in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] by futurist [[Mark Pesce]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.moorescloud.com/2012/10/12/meet-the-press/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016220355/http://blog.moorescloud.com/2012/10/12/meet-the-press/ |archivedate=2012-10-16 |df= }}</ref>\n*In ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', [[Boss Hogg]] has a nephew called Hughie Hogg (who appears in several episodes from season two onwards) while Boss Hogg's big brother Louie Hogg appears in season six's \"How To Succeed In Hazzard.\"\n*In the 1988 post-apocalyptic role playing game ''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]'', the player's [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] can neutralize a gang led by triplets named Huey, Dewey and Louie.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{inducks character|HDL}}\n*[http://www.toonopedia.com/nephews.htm Toonopedia page about Huey, Dewey, and Louie]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130725104029/http://www.disneyshorts.org/characters/hdl.aspx Disney shorts encyclopedia page about Huey, Dewey, and Louie]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051106102140/http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/hdnl.html The boys' profile on the Disney HooZoo]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170307015644/http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000683/ Huey Duck] on [[IMDb]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170307180915/http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000540/ Dewey Duck] on [[IMDb]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160128123655/http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000566/ Louie Duck] on [[IMDb]]\n\n{{Disney Characters}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n{{Quack Pack}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Huey, Dewey, And Louie}}\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic birds]]\n[[Category:Child characters in animated films]]\n[[Category:Child characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Child characters in television]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1937]]\n[[Category:Disney comics characters]]\n[[Category:Disney core universe characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Scottish descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Calisota]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1937]]\n[[Category:Fictional ducks]]\n[[Category:Fictional explorers]]\n[[Category:Fictional triplets]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional trios]]\n[[Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Ted Osborne]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Al Taliaferro]]", "sha1": "9a46gc3nkomifasr6pfon9qx4nrgfzw"}}, {"title": "Hortense McDuck", "ns": "0", "id": "14357", "redirect": {"title": "Clan McDuck"}, "revision": {"id": "838786171", "parentid": "783864013", "timestamp": "2018-04-29T08:51:08Z", "contributor": {"username": "The Transhumanist", "id": "1754504"}, "comment": "Add template{{R to section}} to categorize redirect using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Clan McDuck#Hortense McDuck]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R to section}}\n{{R from merge}}\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McDuck, Hortense}}\n[[Category:19th century in fiction]]\n[[Category:20th century in fiction]]\n[[Category:Fictional immigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Calisota]]", "sha1": "5i3qq6huqq3amuhbxvk205hh5x3fre3"}}, {"title": "Hammurabi", "ns": "0", "id": "14358", "revision": {"id": "866636616", "parentid": "866476100", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T15:40:44Z", "contributor": {"username": "Palindromedairy", "id": "5844064"}, "comment": "/* Legacy */ A pile of redundant consecutive same-para cites.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description|sixth king of Babylon}}\n{{redirect|Hamurabi|the video game|Hamurabi (video game)}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{distinguish|Ammurapi}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name =Hammurabi\n| image =F0182 Louvre Code Hammourabi Bas-relief Sb8 rwk.jpg\n| image_size =235px\n| caption =Hammurabi (standing), depicted as receiving his royal insignia from [[Shamash]] (or possibly [[Marduk]]).

He ousted [[Ishme-Dagan I]], the king of [[Assyria]], and forced his son [[Mut-Ashkur]] to pay tribute, bringing almost all of [[Mesopotamia]] under Babylonian rule.<ref>{{cite book |first=Roger B. |last=Beck |first2=Linda |last2=Black |first3=Larry S. |last3=Krieger |first4=Phillip C. |last4=Naylor |first5=Dahia Ibo |last5=Shabaka |title=World History: Patterns of Interaction |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=pQRlSAAACAAJ |publisher=[[McDougal Littell]] |year=1999 |location=Evanston, IL |isbn=0-395-87274-X |oclc=39762695}}</ref>\n\nHammurabi is best known for having issued the [[Code of Hammurabi]], which he claimed to have received from [[Shamash]], the Babylonian god of justice. Unlike earlier [[Sumer]]ian law codes, such as the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]], which had focused on compensating the victim of the crime, the Law of Hammurabi was one of the first law codes to place greater emphasis on the physical punishment of the perpetrator. It prescribed specific penalties for each crime and is among the first codes to establish the [[presumption of innocence]]. Although its penalties are extremely harsh by modern standards, they were intended to limit what a wronged person was permitted to do in [[Retributive justice|retribution]]. The Code of Hammurabi and the [[Law of Moses]] in the [[Torah]] contain numerous similarities, but these are probably due to shared background and oral tradition, and it is unlikely that Hammurabi's laws exerted any direct impact on the later Mosaic ones.\n\nHammurabi was seen by many as a god within his own lifetime. After his death, Hammurabi was revered as a great conqueror who spread civilization and forced all peoples to pay obeisance to [[Marduk]], the [[national god]] of the Babylonians. Later, his military accomplishments became de-emphasized and his role as the ideal lawgiver became the primary aspect of his legacy. For later Mesopotamians, Hammurabi's reign became the frame of reference for all events occurring in the distant past. Even after the empire he built collapsed, he was still revered as a model ruler, and many kings across the Near East claimed him as an ancestor. Hammurabi was rediscovered by archaeologists in the late nineteenth century and has since become seen as an important figure in the history of law.\n\n== Reign and conquests ==\n[[File:Hammurabi's Babylonia 1.svg|thumb|left|Map showing the Babylonian territory upon Hammurabi's ascension in {{circa|1792 BC}} and upon his death in {{circa|1750 BC}}]]\nHammurabi was an [[Amorite]] [[First Babylonian Dynasty|First Dynasty]] king of the [[city-state]] of Babylon, and inherited the power from his father, [[Sin-Muballit]], in {{circa|1792 BC}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=1}}</ref> Babylon was one of the many largely Amorite ruled city-states that dotted the central and southern Mesopotamian plains and waged war on each other for control of fertile [[agriculture|agricultural]] land.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop |2005|pp=1\u20132}}</ref> Though many cultures co-existed in Mesopotamia, Babylonian culture gained a degree of prominence among the [[literacy|literate]] classes throughout the [[Middle East]] under Hammurabi.<ref name=\"VM3\">{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=3}}</ref> The kings who came before Hammurabi had founded a relatively minor City State in 1894 BC which controlled little territory outside of the city itself. Babylon was overshadowed by older, larger and more powerful kingdoms such as [[Elam]], [[Assyria]], [[Isin]], [[Eshnunna]] and [[Larsa]] for a century or so after its founding. However his father [[Sin-Muballit]] had begun to consolidate rule of a small area of south central Mesopotamia under Babylonian [[hegemony]] and, by the time of his reign, had conquered the minor city-states of [[Borsippa]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], and [[Sippar]].<ref name=\"VM3\" />\n\nThus Hammurabi ascended to the throne as the king of a minor kingdom in the midst of a complex [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] situation. The powerful kingdom of [[Eshnunna]] controlled the upper Tigris River while [[Larsa]] controlled the river delta. To the east of Mesopotamia lay the powerful kingdom of [[Elam]] which regularly invaded and forced tribute upon the small states of southern Mesopotamia. In northern Mesopotamia, the [[Assyria]]n king [[Shamshi-Adad I]], who had already inherited centuries old Assyrian colonies in [[Asia Minor]], had expanded his territory into the [[Levant]] and central [[Mesopotamia]],<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=3\u20134}}</ref> although his untimely death would somewhat fragment his empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=16}}</ref>\n\nThe first few decades of Hammurabi's reign were quite peaceful.

Hammurabi's reign became the point of reference for all events in the distant past. A hymn to the goddess [[Inanna|Ishtar]], whose language suggests it was written during the reign of [[Ammi-Saduqa|Ammisaduqa]], Hammurabi's fourth successor, declares: \"The king who first heard this song as a song of your heroism is Hammurabi.

In northern Mesopotamia, both the Amorites and Babylonians were driven from [[Assyria]] by [[Puzur-Sin]] a native [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-speaking ruler, {{circa|1740 BC}}. Around the same time, native Akkadian speakers threw off Amorite Babylonian rule in the far south of Mesopotamia, creating the [[Sealand Dynasty]], in more or less the region of ancient Sumer. Hammurabi's ineffectual successors met with further defeats and loss of territory at the hands of Assyrian kings such as [[Adasi]] and [[Bel-ibni]], as well as to the Sealand Dynasty to the south, [[Elam]] to the east, and to the [[Kassites]] from the northeast. Thus was Babylon quickly reduced to the small and minor state it had once been upon its founding.<ref>Georges Roux \u2013 Ancient Iraq</ref>\n\nThe ''coup de grace'' for the Hammurabi's Amorite Dynasty occurred in 1595 BC, when Babylon was sacked and conquered by the powerful [[Hittite Empire]], thereby ending all Amorite political presence in Mesopotamia.<ref name=\"D19\">{{harvnb|DeBlois|1997|p=19}}</ref> However, the Indo-European-speaking Hittites did not remain, turning over Babylon to their [[Kassites|Kassite]] allies, a people speaking a [[language isolate]], from the [[Zagros mountains]] region.

These articles were overwhelmingly critical of Delitzsch, though a few were sympathetic. The Kaiser distanced himself from Delitzsch and his radical views and, in fall of 1904, Delitzsch was forced to give his third lecture in [[Cologne]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]] rather than in Berlin.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=25}} The putative relationship between the Mosaic Law and the Code of Hammurabi later became a major part of Delitzsch's argument in his 1920-21 book ''Die gro\u00dfe T\u00e4uschung'' (''The Great Deception'') that the Hebrew Bible was irredeemably contaminated by Babylonian influence and that only by eliminating the human Old Testament entirely could Christians finally believe in the true, [[Aryan]] message of the [[New Testament]].{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=23\u201325}} In the early twentieth century, many scholars believed that Hammurabi was [[Amraphel]], the King of [[Shinar]] in the Book of Genesis 14:1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1440-amraphel|title=AMRAPHEL - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2014&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 14 - New International Version|publisher=}}</ref> This view has now been largely rejected,<ref>{{cite book|last=North|first=Robert|editor1-last=Metzger|editor1-first=Bruce M.|editor2-last=Coogan|editor2-first=Michael D.|date=1993|title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible|location=Oxford, England|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=5|chapter=Abraham|isbn=0-19-504645-5|ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=\"Graner\u00f8d2010\">{{cite book|last=Graner\u00f8d|first=Gard|title=Abraham and Melchizedek: Scribal Activity of Second Temple Times in Genesis 14 and Psalm 110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m5mlvNPexSEC&pg=PA114|date=26 March 2010|location=Berlin, Germany|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-022346-0|page=120|ref=harv}}</ref> and Amraphael's existence is not attested in any writings from outside the Bible.<ref name=\"Graner\u00f8d2010\"/>\n\nBecause of Hammurabi's reputation as a lawgiver, his depiction can be found in several [[United States|U.S.]] government buildings.

Huygens, ''Trait\u00e9 de la Lumi\u00e8re'' (drafted 1678; published in Leyden by Van der Aa, 1690), translated by Silvanus P. Thompson as ''[https://archive.org/details/treatiseonlight031310mbp Treatise on Light]'' (London: Macmillan, 1912; [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14725 Project Gutenberg edition], 2005), p.19.</ref> proposed that every point to which a luminous disturbance reaches becomes a source of a spherical wave; the sum of these secondary waves determines the form of the wave at any subsequent time. He assumed that the secondary waves travelled only in the \"forward\" direction and it is not explained in the theory why this is the case. He was able to provide a qualitative explanation of linear and spherical wave propagation, and to derive the laws of reflection and refraction using this principle, but could not explain the deviations from rectilinear propagation that occur when light encounters edges, apertures and screens, commonly known as [[diffraction]] effects.<ref name = \"Insight into Optics\">OS Heavens and RW Ditchburn, ''Insight into Optics'', 1987, Wiley & Sons, Chichester {{ISBN|0-471-92769-4}}</ref> The resolution of this error was finally explained by David A.B.

Fresnel, \"M&eacute;moire sur la diffraction de la lumi&egrave;re\" (deposited 1818, \"crowned\" 1819), in ''Oeuvres compl&egrave;tes'' (Paris: Imprimerie imp&eacute;riale, 1866&ndash;70), vol.1, pp.&nbsp;247&ndash;363; partly translated as \"Fresnel's prize memoir on the diffraction of light\", in H.&nbsp;Crew (ed.), ''The Wave Theory of Light: Memoirs by Huygens, Young and Fresnel'', American Book Co., 1900, [https://archive.org/details/wavetheoryofligh00crewrich archive.org/details/wavetheoryofligh00crewrich], pp.&nbsp;81&ndash;144. (Not to be confused with the earlier work of the same title in ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', 1:238&ndash;81, 1816.)</ref> showed that Huygens' principle, together with his own principle of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] could explain both the rectilinear propagation of light and also diffraction effects. To obtain agreement with experimental results, he had to include additional arbitrary assumptions about the phase and amplitude of the secondary waves, and also an obliquity factor. These assumptions have no obvious physical foundation but led to predictions that agreed with many experimental observations, including the [[Arago spot]].\n\n[[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson|Poisson]] was a member of the French Academy, which reviewed Fresnel's work.<ref name = \"Born and Wolf\">[[Max Born]] and Emil Wolf, ''Principles of Optics'', 1999, Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|978-0-521-64222-4}}</ref> He used Fresnel's theory to predict that a bright spot ought to appear in the center of the shadow of a small disc, and deduced from this that the theory was incorrect. However, Arago, another member of the committee, performed the experiment and showed that the prediction was correct. (Lisle had observed this fifty years earlier.<ref name = \"Insight into Optics\"/>) This was one of the investigations that led to the victory of the wave theory of light over the then predominant [[corpuscular theory]].\n\nThe Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle provides a reasonable basis for understanding and predicting the classical wave propagation of light. However, there are limitations to the principle,{{which?|date=January 2018}} and not all experts agree that it is an accurate representation of reality\u2014for instance, [[Melvin Schwartz]] argued that \"Huygens' principle actually does give the right answer but for the wrong reasons\".<ref>[http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath242/kmath242.htm Huygens' Principle]</ref>  See Huygens' Theory and the Modern Photon Wavefunction below.\n\n[[Kirchhoff's diffraction formula]] provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for diffraction, based on the wave equation. The arbitrary assumptions made by Fresnel to arrive at the Huygens\u2013Fresnel equation emerge automatically from the mathematics in this derivation.<ref>MV Klein & TE Furtak, ''Optics'', 1986, John Wiley & Sons, New York</ref>\n\nA simple example of the operation of the principle can be seen when an open doorway connects two rooms and a sound is produced in a remote corner of one of them. A person in the other room will hear the sound as if it originated at the doorway. As far as the second room is concerned, the vibrating air in the doorway is the source of the sound.\n\n==Mathematical expression of the principle==\n[[Image:Huygens-Fresnel BW.svg|thumb|300px|right|Geometric arrangement for Fresnel's calculation]]\nConsider the case of a point source located at a point '''P'''<sub>0</sub>, vibrating at a [[frequency]] ''f''. The disturbance may be described by a complex variable ''U''<sub>0</sub> known as the [[complex amplitude]]. It produces a spherical wave with [[wavelength]] \u03bb, [[wavenumber]] ''k'' = 2\u03c0/\u03bb. The complex amplitude of the primary wave at the point '''Q''' located at a distance ''r''<sub>0</sub> from '''P'''<sub>0</sub> is given by:\n\n:<math>U(r_0) = \\frac {U_0 e^{ikr_0}}{r_0} </math>\n\nsince the [[amplitude|magnitude]] decreases in inverse proportion to the distance travelled, and the phase changes as ''k'' times the distance travelled.\n\nUsing Huygens' theory and the [[superposition principle|principle of superposition]] of waves, the complex amplitude at a further point '''P''' is found by summing the contributions from each point on the sphere of radius ''r''<sub>0</sub>. In order to get agreement with experimental results, Fresnel found that the individual contributions from the secondary waves on the sphere had to be multiplied by a constant, \u2212''i''/\u03bb, and by an additional inclination factor, ''K''(\u03c7). The first assumption means that the secondary waves oscillate at a quarter of a cycle out of phase with respect to the primary wave, and that the magnitude of the secondary waves are in a ratio of 1:\u03bb to the primary wave. He also assumed that ''K''(\u03c7) had a maximum value when \u03c7 = 0, and was equal to zero when \u03c7 = \u03c0/2. The complex amplitude at '''P''' is then given by:\n\n:<math> U(P) = -\\frac{i}{\\lambda} U(r_0) \\int_{S} \\frac {e^{iks}}{s} K(\\chi)\\,dS </math>\n\nwhere ''S'' describes the surface of the sphere, and ''s'' is the distance between '''Q''' and '''P'''. \n \nFresnel used a zone construction method to find approximate values of ''K'' for the different zones,<ref name = \"Born and Wolf\"/> which enabled him to make predictions that were in agreement with experimental results.\n\nThe various assumptions made by Fresnel emerge automatically in [[Kirchhoff's diffraction formula]],<ref name = \"Born and Wolf\"/> to which the Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle can be considered to be an approximation. Kirchhoff gave the following expression for ''K''(\u03c7):\n\n:<math>~K(\\chi )= \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\cos \\chi)</math>\n\n''K'' has a maximum value at \u03c7 = 0 as in the Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle; however, ''K'' is not equal to zero at \u03c7 = \u03c0/2.\n\n==Huygens' theory and the modern photon wavefunction==\nHuygens' theory served as a fundamental explanation of the wave nature of light interference and was further developed by Fresnel and Young but did not fully resolve all observations such as the low-intensity double-slit experiment that was first performed by G. I. Taylor in 1909, see [[double-slit experiment]].  It was not until the early, and mid-1900s that quantum theory discussions, particularly the early discussions at the 1927 Brussels [[Solvay Conference]], where [[Louis de Broglie]] proposed his de Broglie hypothesis that the photon is guided by a wavefunction.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baggott|first1=Jim|title=The Quantum Story|date=2011|publisher=Oxford Press|isbn=978-0-19-965597-7|page=116}}</ref>  The wavefunction presents a much different explanation of the observed light and dark bands in a double slit experiment. In this conception, the photon follows a path which is a random choice of one of many possible paths.  These possible paths form the pattern: in dark areas, no photons are landing, and in bright areas, many photons are landing.  The set of possible photon paths is determined by the surroundings: the photon's originating point (atom), the slit, and the screen. The wavefunction is a solution to this geometry.  The wavefunction approach was further proven by additional double-slit experiments in Italy and Japan in the 1970s and 1980s with electrons.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peter|first1=Rodgers|title=The double-slit experiment|url=https://physicsworld.com/a/the-double-slit-experiment/|website=www.physicsworld.com|publisher=Physics World|accessdate=10 Sep 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Huygens' principle and quantum field theory==\nHuygens' principle can be seen as a consequence of the [[homogenous space|homogeneity]] of space\u2014the space is uniform in all locations.<ref name=\"veselov\"/> Any disturbance created in a sufficiently small region of homogenous space (or in a homogenous medium) propagates from that region in all geodesic directions. The waves produced by this disturbance, in turn, create disturbances in other regions, and so on. The [[superposition principle|superposition]] of all the waves results in the observed pattern of wave propagation.\n\nHomogeneity of space is fundamental to [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) where the [[wave function]] of any object propagates along all available unobstructed paths. When [[partition function (quantum field theory)|integrated along all possible paths]], with a [[Phase (waves)|phase]] factor proportional to the [[action (physics)|action]], the interference of the wave-functions correctly predicts observable phenomena. Every point on the wavefront acts as the source of secondary wavelets that spread out in the light cone with the same speed as the wave. The new wavefront is found by constructing the surface tangent to the secondary wavelets.\n\n==In other spatial dimensions==\nIn 1900, [[Jacques Hadamard]] observed that Huygens' principle was broken when the number of spatial dimensions is even.<ref>Alexander P.

These species are known to feed on nectar and produce honey.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Nearctic social wasps of the subfamily polybiinae (Hymenoptera; Vespidae)|last = Bequaert|first = J.Q.|date = 1932|journal = Entomologica Americana|doi = |pmid = }}</ref>\n\nSome wasps, such as the ''[[Polistes versicolor]]'', even consume honey themselves, alternating between feeding on pollen in the middle of their lifecycles and feeding on honey, which can better provide for their energy needs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Britto |first1=F\u00e1bio Barros |first2=Fl\u00e1vio Henrique |last2=Caetano |title=Morphological Features and Occurrence of Degenerative Characteristics in the Hypopharyngeal Glands of the Paper Wasp Polistes versicolor (Olivier) (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) |journal=Micron |volume=37 |issue=8 |year=2006 |pages=742\u201347 |doi=10.1016/j.micron.2006.03.002|pmid=16632372 }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Collection===\n[[File:Sealed Honey in frame.JPG|thumb|Sealed frame of honey]]\n[[File:Extractor Beekeeping.jpg|thumb|right|Extraction from a honeycomb]]\n[[File:Filtering of honey.jpg|thumb|upright|Filtering from a honeycomb]]\n\nHoney is collected from wild bee colonies or from domesticated [[beehive]]s. On average, a hive will produce about {{convert|65|lbs|kg}} of honey per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.honey.com/about-honey/how-honey-is-made|title=How honey is made|publisher=US National Honey Board|date=2018|accessdate=29 June 2018}}</ref>  The honey is stored in honeycombs.  Wild bee nests are sometimes located by following a [[honeyguide]] bird.  The bees may first be pacified by using smoke from a [[bee smoker]].  The smoke triggers a feeding instinct (an attempt to save the resources of the hive from a possible fire), making them less aggressive and the smoke obscures the pheromones the bees use to communicate.\n\nThe honeycomb is removed from the hive and the honey may be extracted from that, either by crushing or by using a [[honey extractor]]. The honey is then usually filtered to remove beeswax and other debris.\n\nBefore the invention of removable frames, bee colonies were often sacrificed to conduct the harvest.  The harvester would take all the available honey and replace the entire colony the next spring.  Since the invention of removable frames, the principles of husbandry led most beekeepers to ensure that their bees  have enough stores to survive the winter, either by leaving some honey in the beehive or by providing the colony with a honey substitute such as sugar water or crystalline sugar (often in the form of a \"candyboard\").  The amount of food necessary to survive the winter depends on the variety of bees and on the length and severity of local winters.\n\nA wide range of species other than humans are attracted to wild or domestic sources of honey.<ref>{{cite book|title=Animals that eat nectar and honey|author=Alice L.

Honey, and objects immersed in honey, have been preserved for centuries.<ref>\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=i0hNLjVL49oC&pg=PA83 The History of the Origin and Development of Museums]\". Dr. M.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. (Reprinted New York: Dover Publications, 1989)</ref> The key to preservation is limiting access to humidity. In its cured state, honey has a sufficiently high sugar content to inhibit fermentation. If exposed to moist air, its [[hydrophilic]] properties pull moisture into the honey, eventually diluting it to the point that fermentation can begin.<ref name=\"Bee Culture' Page 348\"/>\n\nLong shelf life of honey is attributed to an enzyme found in the stomach of bees. The bees mix [[glucose oxidase]] with expelled nectar they previously consumed, which then creates two by-products: [[gluconic acid]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]], partially responsible for honey's acidity and ability to suppress bacterial growth.<ref name=Geiling/>\n\n===Adulteration===\nAdulteration of honey is the addition of other sugars, syrups, or compounds into honey to change its flavor or viscosity, make it cheaper to produce, or increase the fructose content to stave off crystallization. According to the [[Codex Alimentarius]] of the United Nations, any product labeled as honey or pure honey must be a wholly natural product, although different nations have their own laws concerning labeling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-1119-5_8|title=Authenticity of honey|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014|doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-1119-5_8}}</ref> Adulteration of honey is sometimes used as a method of deception when buyers are led to believe that the honey is pure. The practice was common dating back to ancient times, when honey was sometimes blended with plant syrups like [[Maple syrup|maple]], [[Birch syrup|birch]], or [[Sorghum syrup|sorghum]] and sold to unsuspecting customers. Sometimes crystallized honey was mixed with flour or other fillers, hiding the adulteration from buyers until the honey was liquefied. In modern times, the most common adulteration-ingredient became clear, almost-flavorless corn syrup, which, when mixed with honey, is often very difficult to distinguish from unadulterated honey.<ref>''The Hive: The Story of the Honeybee and Us'' By Bee Wilson --St. Martins Press 2004 Page 167</ref>\n\n[[Isotope ratio mass spectrometry]] can be used to detect addition of [[corn syrup]] and [[Sugar cane|cane sugar]] by the carbon [[isotopic signature]].

Fresh honey is a [[supersaturation|supersaturated]] liquid, containing more sugar than the water can typically dissolve at ambient temperatures. At room temperature, honey is a [[supercooling|supercooled]] liquid, in which the [[glucose]] will precipitate into solid granules. This forms a semisolid solution of [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitated]] glucose [[crystal]]s in a solution of [[fructose]] and other ingredients.\n\nAt the temperature of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, [[density]] of honey typically ranges between 1.38 and 1.45&nbsp;kg/l.<ref name=\"Tomasik2003\">{{cite book|author=Piotr Tomasik|title=Chemical and Functional Properties of Food Saccharides|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6RfVqdqxCiUC&pg=PA74|date=20 October 2003|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-49572-8|pages=74\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Phase transitions===\n\nThe melting point of crystallized honey is between {{convert|40|and|50|C|F}}, depending on its composition. Below this temperature, honey can be either in a [[metastable]] state, meaning that it will not crystallize until a [[seed crystal]] is added, or, more often, it is in a \"labile\" state, being saturated with enough sugars to crystallize spontaneously.<ref>[[#Root|Root]], p. 355</ref> The rate of crystallization is affected by many factors, but the primary factor is the ratio of the main sugars: fructose to glucose. Honeys that are supersaturated with a very high percentage of glucose, such as [[brassica]] honey,  crystallize almost immediately after harvesting, while honeys with a low percentage of glucose, such as chestnut or [[tupelo]] honey, do not crystallize. Some types of honey may produce very large but few crystals, while others produce many small crystals.<ref name=\"Piotr Tomasik p. 74\">Tomasik, Piotr (2004) ''Chemical and functional properties of food saccharides'', CRC Press, p. 74, {{ISBN|0-8493-1486-0}}</ref>\n\nCrystallization is also affected by water content, because a high percentage of water inhibits crystallization, as does a high [[dextrin]] content. Temperature also affects the rate of crystallization, with the fastest growth occurring between {{convert|13|and|17|C|F}}. Crystal nuclei (seeds) tend to form more readily if the honey is disturbed, by stirring, shaking, or agitating, rather than if left at rest. However, the [[nucleation]] of microscopic seed-crystals is greatest between {{convert|5|and|8|C|F}}. Therefore, larger but fewer crystals tend to form at higher temperatures, while smaller but more-numerous crystals usually form at lower temperatures. Below 5&nbsp;\u00b0C, the honey will not crystallize, thus the original texture and flavor can be preserved indefinitely.<ref name=\"Piotr Tomasik p. 74\"/>\n\nSince honey normally exists below its melting point, it is a supercooled liquid. At very low temperatures, honey does not freeze solid. Instead, as the temperatures become lower, the viscosity of honey increases. Like most [[viscous liquid]]s, the honey  becomes thick and sluggish with decreasing temperature. At {{convert|-20|C|F}}, honey may appear or even feel solid, but it continues to flow at very low rates. Honey has a [[glass transition]] between {{convert|-42|and|-51|C|F}}. Below this temperature, honey enters a [[glass]]y state and  becomes an [[amorphous solid]] (noncrystalline).<ref>{{cite journal | authors = K\u00e1ntor Z, Pitsi G, Thoen J | title = Glass Transition Temperature of Honey as a Function of Water Content As Determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 2327\u20132330 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10794630 | doi = 10.1021/jf981070g }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | authors = Russell EV, Israeloff NE | title = Direct observation of molecular cooperativity near the glass transition | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = 6813 | pages = 695\u2013698 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11130066 | doi = 10.1038/35047037 }}</ref>\n\n===Rheology===\n[[File:Honey-miel.jpg|thumb|right|Pouring raw honey.

The higher the water percentage, the more easily honey [[Fluid dynamics|flows]]. Above its melting point, however, water has little effect on viscosity. Aside from water content, the composition of honey also has little effect on viscosity, with the exception of a few types. At {{convert|25|C|F}}, honey with 14% water content generally has a viscosity around 400 [[Poise (unit)|poise]], while a honey containing 20% water has a viscosity around 20 poise.

A honey containing 16% water, at {{convert|70|C|F}}, has a viscosity around 2 poise, while at {{convert|30|C|F}}, the viscosity is around 70 poise.

Bormashenko -- Walter D Gruyter 2013 Page 4</ref> The high viscosity and wettability of honey lead to the phenomenon of [[Adhesion|stickiness]], which is a time-dependent process in supercooled liquids between the glass-transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) and the crystalline-melting temperature.<ref>''Food Engineering Interfaces'' by Jos\u00e9 Miguel Aguilera, Ricardo Simpson, Jorge Welti-Chanes, Daniela Bermudez Aguirre, Gustavo Barbosa-Canovas -- Springer 2011 Page 479--487</ref> \n\nA few types of honey have unusual viscous properties. Honeys from [[Calluna vulgaris|heather]] or [[Leptospermum scoparium|manuka]] display [[thixotropic]] properties. These types of honey enter a gel-like state when motionless, but then liquify when stirred.<ref>[[#Krell|Krell]], pp. 5\u20136</ref>\n\n===Electrical and optical properties===\n\nBecause honey contains [[electrolyte]]s, in the form of acids and minerals, it exhibits varying degrees of [[electrical conductivity]]. Measurements of the electrical conductivity are used to determine the quality of honey in terms of ash content.<ref name=\"bee-hexagon.net\"/>\n\nThe effect honey has on light is useful for determining the type and quality. Variations in the water content alter the [[refractive index]] of honey. Water content can easily be measured with a [[refractometer]]. Typically, the refractive index for honey ranges from 1.504 at 13% water content to 1.474 at 25%. Honey also has an effect on [[polarized light]], in that it rotates the polarization plane. The fructose gives a negative rotation, while the glucose gives a positive one. The overall rotation can be used to measure the ratio of the mixture.<ref name=\"bee-hexagon.net\"/><ref name=\"Bee Culture' Page 348\">[[#Root|Root]], p. 348</ref> Honey may vary in color between pale yellow and dark brown, but other bright colors may occasionally be found, depending on the source of the sugar harvested by the bees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/9587260/Bees-producing-MandMs-coloured-honey.html|title=Bees 'producing M&M's coloured honey'|date=4 October 2012|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=30 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Hygroscopy and fermentation===\n\nHoney has the ability to absorb moisture directly from the air, a phenomenon called [[hygroscopy]]. The amount of water the honey absorbs is dependent on the relative humidity of the air. Because honey contains yeast, this hygroscopic nature requires that honey be stored in sealed containers to prevent fermentation, which usually begins if the honey's water content rises much above 25%. Honey tends to absorb more water in this manner than the individual sugars allow on their own, which may be due to other ingredients it contains.<ref name=\"Bee Culture' Page 348\"/>\n\nFermentation of honey usually occurs after crystallization, because without the glucose, the liquid portion of the honey primarily consists of a concentrated mixture of fructose, acids, and water, providing the yeast with enough of an increase in the water percentage for growth. Honey that is to be stored at room temperature for long periods of time is often [[pasteurized]], to kill any yeast, by heating it above {{convert|70|C|F}}.<ref name=\"Bee Culture' Page 348\"/>\n\n===Thermal characteristics===\n[[File:Creamed honey Maillard reaction after aging.jpg|thumb|Creamed honey. On the left is how it appears fresh, but the honey on the right has been aged at room temperature for two years. While still edible, the Maillard reaction produces considerable differences in the color and flavor of the aged honey.]]\n\nLike all sugar compounds, honey [[caramelization|caramelize]]s if heated sufficiently, becoming darker in color, and eventually burns. However, honey contains fructose, which caramelizes at lower temperatures than glucose.<ref>Hans-Dieter Belitz, Werner Grosch, Peter Schieberle [https://books.google.com/books?id=xteiARU46SQC&printsec=frontcover ''Food chemistry''] Springer Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg 2004 p. 884 {{ISBN|3-540-69933-3}}</ref> The temperature at which caramelization begins varies, depending on the composition, but is typically between {{convert|70|and|110|C|F}}. Honey also contains acids, which act as [[catalyst]]s for caramelization. The specific types of acids and their amounts play a primary role in determining the exact temperature.<ref>Zdzis\u0142aw E. Sikorski ''Chemical and functional properties of food components'' CRC Press 2007 p. 121 {{ISBN|0-8493-9675-1}}</ref> Of these acids, the amino acids, which occur in very small amounts, play an important role in the darkening of honey. The amino acids form darkened compounds called [[melanoidin]]s, during a [[Maillard reaction]]. The Maillard reaction occurs slowly at room temperature, taking from a few to several months to show visible darkening, but speeds up dramatically with increasing temperatures. However, the reaction can also be slowed by storing the honey at colder temperatures.<ref>[[#Root|Root]], p. 350</ref>\n\nUnlike many other liquids, honey has very poor [[thermal conductivity]] of 0.5 W/(m\u22c5K) at 13% water content (compared to 401 W/(m\u22c5K) of [[copper]]), taking a long time to reach [[thermal equilibrium]].<ref>https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html</ref> Melting crystallized honey can easily result in localized caramelization if the heat source is too hot, or if it is not evenly distributed. However, honey takes substantially longer to liquify when just above the melting point than at elevated temperatures.<ref name=\"bee-hexagon.net\"/> Melting 20&nbsp;kg of crystallized honey, at {{convert|40|C|F}}, can take up to 24 hours, while 50&nbsp;kg may take twice as long. These times can be cut nearly in half by heating at {{convert|50|C|F}}. However, many of the minor substances in honey can be affected greatly by heating, changing the flavor, aroma, or other properties, so heating is usually done at the lowest temperature possible for the shortest amount of time.<ref>[[#Krell|Krell]], pp. 40\u201343</ref>\n\n===Acid content and flavor effects===\n\nThe average [[pH]] of honey is 3.9, but can range from 3.4 to 6.1.<ref name=\"nhb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.honey.com/images/downloads/ph-acidsinhoney.pdf|publisher=National Honey Board Food Technology/Product Research Program|title=pH and acids in honey|date=April 2006|access-date=1 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701123559/http://www.honey.com/images/downloads/ph-acidsinhoney.pdf|archive-date=1 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Honey contains many kinds of acids, both [[organic acid|organic]] and [[amino acid|amino]].

Within a few weeks to a few months of extraction, many varieties of honey crystallize into a cream-colored solid. Some varieties of honey, including tupelo, acacia, and sage, crystallize less regularly. Honey may be heated during bottling at temperatures of {{convert|40|\u2013|49|C|F}} to delay or inhibit crystallization. Overheating is indicated by change in enzyme levels, for instance, [[diastase]] activity, which can be determined with the Schade or the [[Phadebas]] methods. A fluffy film on the surface of the honey (like a white foam), or marble-colored or white-spotted crystallization on a container's sides, is formed by air bubbles trapped during the bottling process.\n\nA 2008 Italian study determined [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] can be used to distinguish between different honey types, and can be used to pinpoint the area where it was produced. Researchers were able to identify differences in acacia and polyfloral honeys by the differing proportions of [[fructose]] and [[sucrose]], as well as differing levels of aromatic [[amino acid]]s [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]].

Tradition lists Hengist as the first of the Jutish kings of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]].\n\nAccording to early sources, Hengist and Horsa arrived in Britain at [[Ebbsfleet, Thanet|Ebbsfleet]] on the [[Isle of Thanet]]. For a time, they served as mercenaries for [[Vortigern]], [[King of the Britons]], but later they turned against him (British accounts have them betraying him in the [[Treachery of the Long Knives|Treachery\nof the Long Knives]]). Horsa was killed fighting the Britons, but Hengist successfully conquered Kent, becoming the forefather of its kings.\n\nA figure named Hengest, who may be identifiable with the leader of British legend, appears in the ''[[Finnsburg Fragment]]'' and in ''[[Beowulf]]''. \n\nLegends of horse-associated founding brothers are attested among other [[Germanic peoples]] and appear in other [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] cultures. As a result, scholars have theorized a [[Germanic mythology|pan-Germanic mythological]] origin for Hengist and Horsa, stemming originally from [[divine twins]] found in [[Proto-Indo-European religion]]. Other scholars, including [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], have argued for a historical basis for Hengist and Horsa.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[Old English]] names ''Hengest'' {{IPA-ang|hend\u0292est|}} and ''Horsa'' {{IPA-ang|hors\u0251|}} mean \"stallion\" and \"horse\" respectively.<ref name=MALLORY135>Mallory (2005:135).</ref>\n\nThe original Old English word for a horse was ''[[Ehwaz|eoh]]''. ''Eoh'' derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] base ''*ekwo'', hence [[Latin]] ''equus'' which gave rise to the modern English words ''equine'' and ''equestrian''. ''Hors'' is derived from the Proto-Indo-European base ''*kurs'', to run, which also gave rise to ''hurry, carry'' and ''current'' (the latter two are borrowings from [[French language|French]]). ''Hors'' eventually replaced ''eoh'', fitting a pattern elsewhere in Germanic languages where the original names of sacred animals are abandoned in favour of adjectives; for example, the word ''[[Bear#Etymology|bear]]''. While the ''Ecclesiastical History'' and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' refer to the brother as ''Horsa'', in the ''History of the Britons'' his name is simply ''Hors''. It has been suggested that ''Horsa'' may be a pet form of a compound name with the first element \"horse\".<ref name=TOLKEIN173>Tolkien (2006:173).</ref>\n\n==Attestations==\n\n===''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''===\nIn his 8th century ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People|Ecclesiastical History]]'', [[Bede]] records that the first chieftains among the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes in England were said to have been Hengist and Horsa. He relates that Horsa was killed in battle against the Britons and was thereafter buried in East Kent, where at the time of writing a monument still stood to him. According to Bede, Hengist and Horsa were the sons of [[Wictgils]], son of [[Witta, son of Wecta|Witta]], son of [[Wecta]], son of [[Woden]].<ref name=SHERLEY-PRICE63>Shirley-Price (1990:63).</ref>\n\n===''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''===\nThe ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', which exists in nine manuscripts and fragments, compiled from the 9th to the 12th centuries, records that in the year 449 Hengist and Horsa were invited to Britain by Vortigern to assist his forces in fighting the [[Picts]]. They landed at Eopwinesfleot (Ebbsfleet), and went on to defeat the Picts wherever they fought them. Hengist and Horsa sent word home to Germany describing \"the worthlessness of the Britons, and the richness of the land\" and asked for assistance. Their request was granted and support arrived. Afterward, more people arrived in Britain from \"the three powers of Germany; the Old Saxons, the Angles, and the Jutes\". The Saxons populated [[Essex]], [[Sussex]], and [[Wessex]]; the Jutes Kent, the [[Isle of Wight]], and part of [[Hampshire]]; and the Angles [[East Anglia]], [[Mercia]], and [[Northumbria]] (leaving their original homeland, [[Angeln]], deserted). The Worcester Chronicle (Chronicle D, compiled in the 11th century), and the Peterborough Chronicle (Chronicle E, compiled in the 12th century), include the detail that these forces were led by the brothers Hengist and Horsa, sons of Wihtgils, son of Witta, son of Wecta, son of Woden, but this information is not included in the A, B, C, or F versions.<ref name=INGRAM13-14>Ingram (1823:13-14).</ref>\n\nIn the entry for the year 455 the ''Chronicle'' details that Hengist and Horsa fought with Vortigern at [[Battle of Aylesford|Aylesford]] and that Horsa died there. Hengist took control of the kingdom with his son [[Oisc of Kent|Esc]]. In 457, Hengist and Esc fought against British forces in [[Crayford]] \"and there slew four thousand men\". The Britons left the land of Kent and fled to London. In 465, Hengest and Esc fought again at the [[Battle of Wippedesfleot]], probably near Ebbsfleet, and slew twelve British leaders. In the year 473, the final entry in the ''Chronicle'' mentioning Hengist or Horsa, Hengist and Esc are recorded as having taken \"immense booty\" and the Britons having \"fled from the English like fire\".<ref name=INGRAM15-16>Ingram (1823:15-16).</ref>\n\n===''History of the Britons''===\n[[File:Hengest and Horsa Verstegan.jpg|thumb|Hengist and Horsa arriving in Britain, by [[Richard Rowlands]] (1605)]]\nThe 9th century ''[[Historia Brittonum|History of the Britons]]'', attributed to the Briton [[Nennius]], records that, during the reign of Vortigern in Britain, three vessels that had been exiled from Germany arrived in Britain, commanded by Hengist and Horsa. The narrative then gives a genealogy of the two: Hengist and Horsa were sons of Guictglis, son of Guicta, son of Guechta, son of Vouden, son of Frealof, son of Fredulf, son of Finn, son of Foleguald, son of Geta. Geta was said to be the son of a god, yet \"not of the omnipotent God and our Lord Jesus Christ,\" but rather \"the offspring of one of their idols, and whom, blinded by some demon, they worshipped according to the custom of the heathen.\" In 447 AD, Vortigern received Hengist and Horsa \"as friends\" and gave to the brothers the Isle of Thanet.<ref name=GUNN18>Gunn (1819:18).</ref>\n\nAfter the Saxons had lived on Thanet for \"some time\" Vortigern promised them supplies of clothing and other provisions on condition that they assist him in fighting the enemies of his country. As the Saxons increased in number the Britons became unable to keep their agreement, and so told them their assistance was no longer needed and they should go home.<ref name=GUNN22>Gunn (1819:22).</ref>\n\nVortigern allowed Hengist to send for more of his countrymen to come over to fight for him. Messengers were sent to \"[[Scythia]]\", where \"a number\" of warriors were selected, and, with sixteen ships, the messengers returned. With the men came Hengist's beautiful daughter. Hengist prepared a feast, inviting Vortigern, Vortigern's officers, and Ceretic, his translator. Prior to the feast, Hengist enjoined his daughter to serve the guests plenty of wine and ale so that they would become drunk. At the feast Vortigern became enamored with her and promised Hengist whatever he liked in exchange for her betrothal. Hengist, having \"consulted with the Elders who attended him of the Angle race,\" demanded Kent. Without the knowledge of the then-ruler of Kent, Vortigern agreed.<ref name=GUNN22-23>Gunn (1819:22\u201323).</ref>\n\nHengist's daughter was given to Vortigern, who slept with her and deeply loved her. Hengist told him that he would now be both his father and adviser and that he would know no defeat with his counsel, \"for the people of my country are strong, warlike, and robust.\" With Vortigern's approval, Hengist would send for his son and his brother to fight against the Scots and those who dwelt near the wall. Vortigern agreed and [[Octa of Kent|Ochta]] and Ebissa arrived with 40 ships, sailed around the land of the Picts, conquered \"many regions,\" and assaulted the Orkney Islands. Hengist continued to send for more ships from his country, so that some islands where his people had previously dwelt are now free of inhabitants.<ref name=GUNN23-24>Gunn (1819:23\u201324).</ref>\n\nVortigern had meanwhile incurred the wrath of [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre]] (by taking his own daughter for a wife and having a son by her) and had gone into hiding at the advice of his counsel. But at length his son [[Vortimer]] engaged Hengist and Horsa and their men in battle, drove them back to Thanet and there enclosed them and beset them on the western flank. The war waxed and waned; the Saxons repeatedly gained ground and were repeatedly driven back.<ref name=GUNN29>Gunn (1819:29).</ref> Vortimer attacked the Saxons four times: first enclosing the Saxons in Thanet, secondly fighting at the river [[River Derwent, North East England|Derwent]], the third time at [[Battle of Aylesford|Epsford]], where both Horsa and Vortigern's son [[Catigern]] died, and lastly \"near the stone on the shore of the Gallic sea,\" where the Saxons were defeated and fled to their ships.\n\nAfter a \"short interval\" Vortimer died and the Saxons became established, \"assisted by foreign pagans.\" Hengist convened his forces and sent to Vortigern an offer of peace. Vortigern accepted, and Hengist prepared a feast to bring together the British and Saxon leaders.<ref name=GUNN30-31>Gunn (1819:30\u201331).</ref> However, he instructed his men to conceal knives beneath their feet. At the right moment, Hengist shouted ''nima der [[seax|sexa]]'' (get your knives) and his men massacred the unsuspecting Britons. However, they spared Vortigern, who ransomed himself by giving the Saxons Essex, Sussex, Middlesex, and other unnamed districts.<ref name=GUNN31-32>Gunn (1819:31\u201332).</ref>\n\nGermanus of Auxerre was acclaimed as commander of the British forces. By praying, singing [[hallelujah]] and crying to God, the Saxons were driven to the sea.  Germanus then prayed for three days and nights at Vortigern's castle and fire fell from heaven and engulfed the castle. Vortigern, Hengist's daughter, Vortigern's other wives, and all other inhabitants burned to death.

Hengist and Horsa appear in books 6 and 8:\n\n====Book 6====\nGeoffrey records that three [[brigandines]] or long galleys arrived in Kent, full of armed men and commanded by two brothers, Hengist and Horsa. Vortigern was then staying at Dorobernia ([[Canterbury]]), and ordered that the \"tall strangers\" be received peacefully and brought to him. When Vortigern saw the company, he immediately observed that the brothers \"excelled all the rest both in nobility and in gracefulness of person.\" He asked what country they had come from and why they had come to his kingdom. Hengist (\"whose years and wisdom entitled him to precedence\") replied that they had left their homeland of Saxony to offer their services to Vortigern or some other prince, as part of a Saxon custom in which, when the country became overpopulated, able young men were chosen by lot to seek their fortunes in other lands. Hengist and Horsa were made generals over the exiles, as befitted their noble birth.<ref name=THOMPSON116-117>Thompson (1842:116\u2013117).</ref>\n\nVortigern was aggrieved when he learned that the strangers were pagans, but nonetheless rejoiced at their arrival, since he was surrounded by enemies. He asked Hengist and Horsa if they would help him in his wars, offering them land and \"other possessions.\" They accepted the offer, settled on an agreement, and stayed with Vortigern at his court. Soon after, the Picts came from [[Alba]] with an immense army and attacked the northern parts of Vortigern's kingdom. In the ensuing battle \"there was little occasion for the Britons to exert themselves, for the Saxons fought so bravely, that the enemy, formerly victorious, were speedily put to flight.\"<ref name=THOMPSON117-118>Thompson (117\u2013118).</ref>\n\nIn gratitude Vortigern increased the rewards he has promised to the brothers. Hengist was given \"large possessions of lands in [[Kingdom of Lindsey|Lindsey]] for the subsistence of himself and his fellow-soldiers.\" A \"man of experience and subtilty,\" Hengist told Vortigern that his enemies assailed him from every quarter, and that his subjects wished to depose him and make [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] king. He asked the king to allow him to send word to Saxony for more soldiers. Vortigern agreed, adding that Hengist could invite over whom he pleases and that \"you shall have no refusal from me in whatever you shall desire.\"<ref name=THOMPSON118-119>Thompson (1842:118\u2013119).</ref>\n\nHengist bowed low in thanks, and made a further request, that he be made a consul or prince, as befitted his birth. Vortigern responded that it was not in his power to do this, reasoning that Hengist was a foreign pagan and would not be accepted by the British lords. Hengist asked instead for leave to build a fortress on a piece of land small enough that it could be encircled by a leather thong.  Vortigern granted this and ordered Hengist to invite more Saxons.<ref name=THOMPSON118-119>Thompson (1842:118\u2013119).</ref>\n\nAfter executing Vortigern's orders, Hengist took a bull's hide and made it into a single thong, which he used to encircle a carefully-chosen rocky place (perhaps at [[Caistor]] in Lindsey).<ref>{{cite book|title=A Brief History of King Arthur|last=Ashley|first=Michael|date=2005|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nBWeBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=[[Constable & Robinson]]|isbn=1472107659}}</ref> Here he built the castle of ''Kaercorrei'', or in Saxon ''Thancastre'': \"thong castle.\"<ref name=THOMPSON119>Thompson (1842:119).</ref>\n\nThe messengers returned from Germany with eighteen ships full of the best soldiers they could get, as well as Hengist's beautiful daughter [[Rowena]]. Hengist invited Vortigern to see his new castle and the newly arrived soldiers. A banquet was held in Thancastre, at which Vortigern drunkenly asked Hengist to let him marry Rowena. Horsa and the men all agreed that Hengist should allow the marriage, on the condition that Vortigern gave him Kent.<ref name=THOMPSOIN120-121>Thompson (1842:120\u2013121).</ref>\n\nVortigern and Rowena were immediately married and Hengist was given Kent. The king was delighted with his new wife, but he incurred the hatred of his nobles and of his three sons.<ref name=THOMPSON121>Thompson (1842:121).</ref>\n\nAs his new father-in-law, Hengist made further demands of Vortigern:\n<blockquote>\n:As I am your father, I claim the right of being your counsellor: do not therefore slight my advice, since it is to my countrymen you must owe the conquest of all your enemies. Let us invite over my son Octa, and his brother Ebissa, who are brave soldiers, and give them the countries that are in the northern parts of Britain, by [[Hadrian's wall|the wall]], between [[Deira]] and Alba. For they will hinder the inroads of the barbarians, and so you shall enjoy peace on the other side of the [[Humber]].<ref name=THOMPSON121-122>Thompson (1842:121\u2013122).</ref>\n</blockquote>\nVortigern agreed. Upon receiving the invitation, Octa, Ebissa, and another lord, [[Cerdic of Wessex|Cherdich]], immediately left for Britain with three hundred ships. Vortigern received them kindly, and gave them ample gifts. With their assistance, Vortigern defeated his enemies in every engagement. All the while Hengist continued inviting over yet more ships, adding to his numbers daily. Witnessing this, the Britons tried to get Vortigern to banish the Saxons, but on account of his wife he would not. Consequently, his subjects turned against him and took his son Vortimer for their king. The Saxons and the Britons, led by Vortimer, met in four battles. In the second, Horsa and Vortimer's brother, Catigern, slew one another. By the fourth battle, the Saxons had fled to Thanet, where Vortimer besieged them. When the Saxons could no longer bear the British onslaughts, they sent out Vortigern to ask his son to allow them safe passage back to Germany. While discussions were taking place, the Saxons boarded their ships and left, leaving their wives and children behind.<ref name=THOMPSON122-123>Thompson (1842:122\u2013123).</ref>\n\nThe victorious Vortimer was poisoned by Rowena, and Vortigern returned to the throne.<ref name=THOMPSON123>Thompson (1842:123).</ref> At his wife's request he invited Hengist back to Britain, but instructed him to bring only a small retinue. Hengist, knowing Vortimer to be dead, instead raised an army of 300,000 men. When Vortigern caught word of the imminent arrival of the vast Saxon fleet, he resolved to fight them. Rowena alerted her father of this, who, after considering various strategies, resolved to make a show of peace and sent ambassadors to Vortigern.<ref name=THOMPSON124-125>Thompson (1842:124\u2013125).</ref>\n\nThe ambassadors informed Vortigern that Hengist had only brought so many men because he did not know of Vortimer's death and feared further attacks from him. Now that there was no threat, Vortigern could choose from among the men the ones he wished to return to Germany. Vortigern was greatly pleased by these tidings, and arranged to meet Hengist on the first of May at the monastery of Ambrius.<ref name=THOMPSON125>Thompson (1842:125).</ref>\n\nBefore the meeting, Hengist ordered his soldiers to carry long daggers beneath their clothing. At the signal ''Nemet oure Saxas'' (get your knives), the Saxons fell upon the unsuspecting Britons and massacred them, while Hengist held Vortigern by his cloak. 460 British barons and consuls were killed, as well as some Saxons whom the Britons beat to death with club and stones. Vortigern was held captive and threatened with death until he resigned control of Britain's chief cities to Hengist. Once free, he fled to [[Cambria]].<ref name=THOMPSON125-126>Thompson (1842:125\u2013126).</ref>\n\n====Book 8====\nIn Cambria, [[Merlin]] prophesied to Vortigern that the brothers [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] and [[Uther Pendragon]], who had fled to [[Armorica]] as children after Vortigern killed their brother and father, would return to have their revenge and defeat the Saxons. They arrived the next day, and, after rallying the dispersed Britons, Aurelius was proclaimed king. Aurelius marched into Cambria and burned Vortigern alive in his tower, before setting his sights upon the Saxons.<ref name=THOMPSON149>Thompson (1842:149).</ref>\n\nHengist was struck by terror at the news of Vortigern's death and fled with his army beyond the Humber. He took courage at the approach of Aurelius and selected the bravest among his men to defend. Hengist told these chosen men not to be afraid of Aurelius, for he had brought less than 10,000 Armorican Britons (the native Britons were hardly worth taking into account), while there were 200,000 Saxons. Hengist and his men advanced towards Aurelius in a field called Maisbeli (probably Ballifield, near [[Sheffield]]),<ref>{{cite journal |last=English |first=Mark |date=2014 |title=Maisbeli: A Place-Name Problem from Geoffrey of Monmouth |url=http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/1/11.short?rss=1 |journal=Notes & Queries |volume=259 |pages=11\u201313 |accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> intending to take the Britons by surprise, but Aurelius anticipated them.<ref name=THOMPSON149/>\n\nAs they marched to meet the Saxons, [[Eldol, Consul of Gloucester|Eldol]], Duke of [[Gloucester]] told Aurelius that he greatly wished to meet Hengist in combat, noting that \"one of the two of us should die before we parted.\" He explained that he had been at the Treachery of the Long Knives, but had escaped when God threw him a stake to defend himself with, making him the only Briton present to survive. Meanwhile, Hengist was placing his troops into formation, giving directions, and walking through the lines of troops, \"the more to spirit them up.\"<ref name=THOMPSON150-151>Thompson (1842:150\u2013151).</ref>\n\nWith the armies in formation, battle began between the Britons and Saxons, both sides shedding \"no small loss of blood.\" Eldol focused on attempting to find Hengist, but had no opportunity to fight him. \"By the especial favour of God,\" the Britons took the upper hand, and the Saxons withdrew and made for Kaerconan ([[Conisbrough]]). Aurelius pursued them, killing or enslaving any Saxon he met on the way. Realizing Kaerconan would not hold against Aurelius, Hengist stopped outside the town and ordered his men to make a stand, \"for he knew that his whole security now lay in his sword.\"<ref name=THOMPSON151-152>Thompson (1842:151\u2013152).</ref>\n\nAurelius reached Hengist, and a \"most furious\" fight ensued, with the Saxons maintaining their ground despite heavy losses. They came close to winning before a detachment of horses from the Armorican Britons arrived. When [[Gorlois]], Duke of [[Cornwall]] arrived, Eldol knew the day was won and grabbed Hengist's helmet, dragging him into the British ranks. The Saxons fled. Hengist's son Octa retreated to [[York]] and his kinsman Eosa to Alclud ([[Dumbarton]]).<ref name=THOMPSON153>Thompson (1842:153).</ref>\n\nThree days after the battle, Aurelius called together a council of principal officers to decide what would be done with Hengist. Eldol's brother Eldad, Bishop of Gloucester, said: \n<blockquote>\n:Though all should be unanimous for setting him at liberty, yet would I cut him to pieces. The prophet [[Samuel (bible)|Samuel]] is my warrant, who, when he had [[Agag]], king of [[Amalek]], in his power, hewed him in pieces, saying, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. Do therefore the same to Hengist, who is a second Agag.<ref name=THOMPSON154>Thompson (1842:154).</ref>\n</blockquote>\nConsequently, Eldol drew Hengist out of the city and cut off his head. Aurelius, \"who showed moderation in all his conduct,\" arranged for him to be buried and for a [[Tumulus|mound]] to be raised over his corpse, according to the custom of pagans.<ref name=THOMPSON154/> Octa and Eosa surrendered to Aurelius, who granted them the country bordering Scotland and made a firm covenant with them.<ref name=THOMPSON154-155>Thompson (1842:154\u2013155).</ref>\n\n===''Prose Edda''===\nHengist is briefly mentioned in ''[[Prologue (Prose Edda)|Prologue]]'', the first book of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written by the Icelander [[Snorri Sturluson]] in the 13th century. In ''Prologue'', a [[euhemerism|euhemerized]] account of Germanic history is given, including that Woden put three of his sons in charge of Saxony.

[[Rudolf Simek]] notes that these horse heads gables can still be seen today, and says that the horse-head gables confirm that Hengist and Horsa were originally considered mythological, horse-shaped beings.<ref name=SIMEK139>Simek (2007:139).</ref> [[Martin Litchfield West]] comments that the horse heads may have been remnants of pagan religious practices in the area.<ref name=WEST190>West (2007:190).</ref> Organisations in (or originating in) the [[Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen|Raiffeisen]] farmers' co-operative movement use designs based on the horse-head gable in their trade-marks.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Pferdek\u00f6pfe Dachschmuck.png|Sketch of a farmhouse gable \nFile:Hannover Pferdegiebel.jpg|Gable with crossed horse heads, [[Hanover]]\nFile:Giebelschmuck Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Pferdek\u00f6pfe.JPG|A gable in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]\nFile:Pferdek\u00f6pfe Giebel.jpg|A gable in [[Hanover]]\nFile:Buchholzer wappen.jpg|Coat of arms of [[Buchholz in der Nordheide]]\nFile:Wappen Braunschweig-Thune.png|Coat of arms of [[Thune]], [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]\nFile:Wappen Spornitz.svg|Coat of arms of [[Spornitz]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]\nFile:Logo-Raiffeisenbank-1877.svg|An 1877 version of the Raiffeisen logo\n</gallery>\n\n==Theories==\n===''Finnsburg Fragment'' and ''Beowulf''===\nA Hengest appears in line 34 of the ''[[Finnsburg Fragment]]'', which describes the legendary [[Battle of Finnsburg]].

In his work ''[[Finn and Hengest]]'', Tolkien argued that Hengist was a historical figure, and that Hengist came to Britain after the events recorded in the ''Finnsburg Fragment'' and ''Beowulf''. [[Patrick Sims-Williams]] is more skeptical of the account, suggesting that Bede's Canterbury source, which he relied on for his account of Hengist and Horsa in the ''Ecclesiastical History'', had confused two separate traditions.<ref name=WALLACE-HADRILL215>Wallace-Hadrill (1993:215).</ref>\n\n===Germanic twin brothers and divine Indo-European horse twins===\nSeveral sources attest that the Germanic peoples venerated a divine pair of twin brothers. The earliest reference to this practice derives from [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]] (c. 345 \u2013 c. 250 BC). Timeaus records that the Celts of the [[North Sea]] were especially devoted to [[Interpretatio graeca|what he describes as]] [[Castor and Pollux]]. In his work  ''Germania'', [[Tacitus]] records the veneration of the [[Alcis (gods)|Alcis]], whom he identifies with Castor and Pollux. Germanic legends mention various brothers as founding figures. The 1st- or 2nd-century historian [[Cassius Dio]] cites the brothers [[Raos and Raptos]] as the leaders of the [[Hasdingi|Astings]]. According to [[Paul the Deacon]]'s 8th century ''[[History of the Lombards]]'', the [[Lombards]] migrated southward from Scandinavia led by [[Ibur and Aio]], while [[Saxo Grammaticus]] records in his 12th century ''[[Gesta Danorum|Deeds of the Danes]]'' that this migration was prompted by [[Aggi and Ebbi]]. In related Indo-European cultures, similar traditions are attested, such as the [[Dioscuri]]. Scholars have theorized that these divine twins in Indo-European cultures stem from divine twins in prehistoric Proto-Indo-European culture.<ref name=PROTO-INDO>Simek (2007:59\u201360) and Mallory (2005:135).</ref>\n\n[[J. P. Mallory]] comments on the great importance of the horse in Indo-European religion, as exemplified \"most obviously\" by various mythical brothers appearing in Indo-European legend, including Hengist and Horsa:\n\n<blockquote>\n:Some would maintain that the ''premier'' animal of the Indo-European sacrifice and ritual was probably the horse. We have already seen how its embedment in Proto-Indo-European society lies not just in its lexical reconstruction but also in the proliferation of personal names which contain \"horse\" as an element among the various Indo-European peoples. Furthermore, we witness the importance of the horse in Indo-European rituals and mythology. One of the most obvious examples is the recurrent depiction of twins such as the Indic Asvins \"horsemen,\" the Greek horsemen Castor and Pollux, the legendary Anglo-Saxon settlers Horsa and Hengist [...] or the Irish twins of [[Macha]], born after she had completed a horse race. All of these attest the existence of Indo-European divine twins associated with or represented by horses.<ref name=MALLORY135/>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Uffington White Horse===\n[[File:White horse from air.jpg|thumb|The [[Uffington White Horse]]]]\nIn his 17th century work ''Monumenta Britannica'', [[John Aubrey]] ascribes the [[Uffington White Horse]] [[hill figure]] to Hengist and Horsa, stating that \"the White Horse was their Standard at the Conquest of Britain\". However, elsewhere he ascribes the origins of the horse to the pre-Roman Britons, reasoning that the horse resembles certain Iron Age British coins. As a result, advocates of a Saxon origin of the figure debated with those favoring an ancient British origin for three centuries after Aubrey's findings. In 1995, using [[optically stimulated luminescence]] dating, David Miles and Simon Palmer of the [[Oxford Archaeology|Oxford Archaeological Unit]] assigned the Uffington White Horse to the late [[Bronze Age]].<ref name=SCHWYZER45AND56>Schwyzer (1999:45 and 56).</ref>\n\n===Aschanes===\nThe [[Brothers Grimm]] identified Hengist with [[Aschanes]], mythical first King of the Saxons, in their notes for legend number 413 of their ''German Legends''.<ref>''The German Legends of the Brothers Grimm'' volume 2, edited and translated by Donald Ward, Millington Books, 1981</ref> Editor and translator Donald Ward, in his commentary on the tale, regards the identification as untenable on linguistic grounds.\n\n==Modern influence==\nHengist and Horsa have appeared in a variety of media in the modern period.

After ''Champions'' fourth edition was released in 1989, a stripped-down version of its ruleset with no superhero or other genre elements was released as ''The Hero System Rulesbook'' in 1990.  As a spinoff of ''Champions'', the ''Hero System'' is considered to have started with 4th edition (as it is mechanically identical to ''Champions'' 4th edition), rather than on its own with a 1st edition.  However, the first three editions of the game are typically referred to as ''Champions'', rather than the Hero System, as the game for its first three editions was not sold as a universal toolkit, instead largely focusing on superheroes.\n\nThe ''Hero System'' is used as the underlying [[game mechanics|mechanics]] of other [[Hero Games]] role-playing games such as ''[[Fantasy Hero]]'', ''[[Star Hero]]'', and ''[[Pulp Hero]]''.  It is characterized by point-based character creation and the rigor with which it measures character abilities. It uses only six-sided [[dice]].\n\n==System features==\nThe ''Hero System'' uses ''Champions''<nowiki/>' key system features.  Tasks are resolved using three six-sided dice and power effects (especially damage) are resolved by rolling a number of dice based on the power's strength.\n\nLike ''Champions'', it uses tool-kit approach to creating effects.  While the system does have more typical features of many RPGs, such as a skill system, most abilities in the ''Hero System'' rules are listed as a generic \"powers\".  Most powers are meant to be able to model a vast number of potential effects.  When creating a character, a player decides on what effect they wish to create, then constructs this effect by consulting the powers in the rulebook.  Most powers have a set of modifiers that alter its base performance to more finely-tune its representation of the effect desired.  Each such modifier makes the power more or less capable, and correspondingly more or less expensive to purchase with character points (the \"currency\" used to buy powers; see the section following).  The result is that many effects are possible from the exact same base power.  For example, while systems such as [[Dungeons & Dragons]] would list a wide variety of separate ranged attack powers that deal damage (such as a fireball, a lightning bolt, an acid spray, a magic missile, and dozens more), the vast majority of such effects in the ''Hero System'' would be constructed out of the same base two powers, \"Blast\" or \"Killing Attack\".\n\nThe ''Hero System'' rules only define an ability's very basic mechanical effects\u2014the player is the one who defines what the ability looks like when used.  For example, if a player wishes to model the ability to project a jet of fire, they could choose the \"Blast\" power.  However, the power's text has no mention of what it looks like or how it operates beyond some very base notes concerning damage and range.  To make it a jet of fire, the player simply states that this Blast is a jet of fire.  To some degree this is simply cosmetic.  However, in the game, that power now is treated as a fire attack, with all that implies as decided by the gamemaster in each situation: it has the possibility of starting secondary fires; it looks, smells and sounds like a jet of fire; will not work in water; will terrify people with a phobia of fire; etc.  The system does have mechanical effect alterations as well: a Blast could be altered by any number of power modifiers such as \"Explosion\", \"Area of Effect\", \"Megascale\", etc.: both advantages and disadvantages are available.  As players are typically attempting to model something with at least a partial real-life analogue, limitations on a power are as much about making it more accurate a representation as they are making it less expensive to purchase (for example, to model a firearm, the limitation that it requires ammunition is expected, regardless of the fact that this happens to make a firearm cost fewer character points).  The system also allows players to construct very exacting modifiers not specifically detailed in the base rules.  For example, a player could define one or more powers as not working when the moon is full, or when it is Tuesday, or any other limitation that the player can imagine and the gamemaster feels is applicable.\n\nAlso like ''Champions'', the ''Hero System'' uses a point-based system for character creation.  Instead of templates which define what a character is, how it performs mechanically, and the new abilities gained after a certain amount of play, a player is given a fixed number of points and allowed to create what they want.  As this is a much more freeform process than in most games, the system encourages close involvement between players and gamemasters to ensure that all participants have the same understanding regarding the type of effects permitted, relative power levels, and the like.\n\n===Character creation===\nEach player creates his character starting with a pool of points to buy abilities (such as the aforementioned \"Energy Blast\" and \"Armor\"), increase characteristics (such as \"Strength\" and \"Intelligence\") and buy skills (such as \"Computer Programming\" and \"Combat Driving\").  This pool can be increased by taking disadvantages for your character (such as being hunted by an enemy, a dependency of some sort or having people who depend on your character in some way).  The initial pool, as well as the final pool size, is determined by the [[gamemaster|Game Master]] (GM), as well as the point limits on each individual ability.\n\n{{Quote|text=\"You build Hero System characters with Character Points. You purchase everything a character can do \u2014 from his ability to lift heavy objects, to his skill with weapons, to his ability to use magic or superpowers \u2014 with Character Points. Your GM will tell you how many points you have to build your character with \u2014 the more points, the more powerful the character, generally. You can spend most of your Character Points without any requirements, but you only get to spend some of them if you take a matching value of Complications for your character. Complications are disadvantages, hindrances, and difficulties that affect a character and thus help you to define who he is and properly simulate the concept you have in mind for him. For example, your character might be Hunted by an old enemy, or adhere to a Code Of Honor, or be missing one eye. [. . .] There are five things a character can buy with Character Points: Characteristics, Skills, Perks, Talents, and Powers.\" - excerpt from Hero System Sixth Edition Volume 1|sign=|source=}}\n\nUnlike the [[d20 System]] and many other game systems, experience awards are in the form of character points, which have the same value as those used in character creation and can be applied directly to the character's abilities upon receipt.\n\n===Advantages and disadvantages===\nThe advantages of the ''Hero System ''are commonly{{Who|date=September 2010}} considered to be:\n\n#It eases [[game balance]] issues for the GM: characters of similar point totals are usually of roughly equal power.\n#It is very flexible in character creation, allowing players to create nearly any character they can imagine.\n#It uses only six-sided [[dice]], as generally used in many board games.\n\nThe primary disadvantages are sometimes considered to be:\n\n#Complexity, as character generation provides a sometimes overwhelming number of options and requires more mathematical computation than other games (but see [[#Mathematics issues|\"Mathematics issues\"]] below).\n#The great amount of time it can take to adjudicate combat.\n#The ability for players familiar with the system's quirks to use the system to decrease the point cost of powers, leading to one character being much more powerful than another character of similar point value.\n#A large number of dice required at high power levels\n\nThe \"large number of dice required at high power levels\" has been called both an advantage and a disadvantage.  The original designers, and some contemporary players, have cited a \"feeling of power\" when rolling large numbers of dice and counting off huge amounts of damage.  On the other hand, rolling such a large load of dice can be physically unwieldy and take a long time to add up.\n\n===Powers===\nThe powers system is divided into a set of standard powers, and a list of advantages and limitations that can be applied to each power. Many of the powers have specific advantages and limitations that apply only to that power. The powers in the Hero System are categorized roughly as follows:\n\n:*'''Adjustment Powers''' \u2014 Modify the Characteristics of self or another.\n:*'''Attack Powers''' \u2014 Inflict physical damage or some other negative effect on an opponent.\n:*'''Body-Affecting Powers''' \u2014 Change shape, size, density, etc.\n:*'''Defense Powers''' \u2014 Protect against an attack or mishap.\n:*'''Mental Powers''' \u2014 Detect and/or affect the mind of another.\n:*'''Movement Powers''' \u2014 Employ various forms of movement.\n:*'''Sense-Affecting Powers''' \u2014 Alter or hinder a character's senses.\n:*'''Sensory Powers''' \u2014 Improve or expand upon the sensory abilities.\n:*'''Size Powers''' \u2014 Growth and Shrinking.\n:*'''Special Powers''' \u2014 Powers with some unusual quality, including ones that do not fall into the other categories.\n:*'''Standard Powers''' \u2014 A \"catch-all\" for Powers that are not Adjustment, Mental, Movement, Size, or Special Powers.\n\nWithin each of these categories are multiple Powers that have more specialized effects. Thus for the movement category there are powers that can be used for [[Running]], [[human swimming|Swimming]], [[Climbing]], [[Jumping|Leaping]], [[Gliding]], [[flight|Flying]], [[Tunnel]]ing through solid surfaces, and even [[Teleportation]]. For certain game [[genre]]s there are even powers for traveling to other dimensions or moving faster than light.\n\nAlso, many Powers appear in at least two categories.  For example, most Attack Powers are also Standard Powers, and Size Powers are basically just a subcategory of Body-Affecting Powers.  Darkness is in three categories \u2014 Standard, Attack, and Sense-Affecting.\n\n====Point Cost====\nEach power has a base point cost for a given effect. This could be, for example, a certain number of points per six-sided-die (or \"d6\") of damage inflicted upon a foe.\n\nPowers can have both advantages and limitations.  Both are modifiers applied at different stages in calculating cost.  These modifiers are typically changes of \u00b1\u00bc, but can range up to \u00b12 or even higher.\n\nAfter the base cost is calculated, advantages are applied.  These, which can make a power more useful, typically expand its effectiveness or make it more powerful, and thus make it more expensive.  Once advantages are applied, the base cost becomes the Active Cost.\n\nThe Active Cost is calculated as an intermediate step as it is required to calculate certain figures, such as range, END usage, difficulty of activation rolls, and other things.\n\nThe formula for calculating the Active Cost is:\n:'''Active Cost''' = '''Base Cost''' &times; (1 + ''Advantages'')\n\nOnce Active Cost is calculated, limitations are applied.  These represent shortcomings in the power, lessened reliability or situations in which the power can not be used.  Limitations are added separately as positive numbers, even though they are listed as negative.\n\nThe Real Cost of the power is then determined by:\n:'''Real Cost''' = '''Active Cost''' / (1 + ''Limitations'')\n\nThe Real Cost is the amount the character must actually pay for the Power.\n\n====Power Frameworks====\nThe rules also include schemes for providing a larger number of powers to a character for a given cost. These power frameworks reduce the cost either by requiring the group of powers to have a common theme as in an Elemental Control Framework, or by limiting the number of powers that can be active at one time with a Multipower Framework. Powers within a framework can share common limitations, further reducing the cost. A third type of power framework, the Variable Power Pool (VPP), trades thrift for flexibility. With it, powers can be arbitrarily chosen on the fly, granting enhanced in-game flexibility. The price is a premium on points, called the Control Cost.  Additionally, it is marked as potentially unbalancing, so not all GMs will permit VPP's.\n\nElemental Controls were eliminated in the Sixth Edition.\n\n===Mathematics issues===\nOne of the criticisms leveled at the ''Hero System'' almost since its inception is the relatively large amount of computation involved in its use, particularly during character creation. While almost none of this math goes beyond the basic functions of [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[division (mathematics)|division]], this can seem daunting to newcomers.\n\nAs a result, [[software]] has been created to automate the bookkeeping involved. \"Heromaker\", an [[MS-DOS]] program, was distributed with some versions of [[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]. Today, \"Hero Designer\"<ref>[http://www.herodesigner.com/home.htm \"Hero Designer: Character creation software for Hero System, 5th Edition\"], vendor website</ref> for the Fifth and Sixth Editions is available on several platforms, and is supported by numerous character packs and other extensions linked to Hero Games book releases.\n\n==Publishing history==\n{{see also|List of Hero System Products}}\n\nAlthough several games based on what would become known as the ''Hero System'' were published in the 1980s, including ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'', ''[[Danger International]]'', ''[[Justice, Inc. (role-playing game)|Justice, Inc.]]'', ''[[Robot Warriors]]'' and the original versions of ''[[Fantasy Hero]]'' and ''[[Star Hero]]'', each of the RPGs was self-contained, much as [[Chaosium]]'s [[Basic Role-Playing]] games are. The ''Hero System'' itself was not released as an independent entity until 1990, as [[Steve Jackson Games]]' ''[[GURPS]]'' (''Generic Universal Roleplaying System'') became more popular. As a joint venture between Hero Games and [[Iron Crown Enterprises]], a stand-alone ''Hero System Rulebook'' was published alongside the fourth edition of Champions. The content was identical to the opening sections of the Champions rules, but all genre-related material was removed. Afterward, genre books such as ''Ninja Hero'' (written by [[Aaron Allston]]) and ''[[Fantasy Hero]]'' were published as sourcebooks for the ''Hero System Rulebook'' as opposed to being independent games.\n\nWith the collapse of the Hero-ICE alliance, the ''Hero System'' went into limbo for several years. The ''Champions'' franchise released a new version under the [[Fuzion]] system, which had been a joint development with [[R. Talsorian Games]], called ''Champions: the New Millennium''. Although two editions were published, it was very poorly received by ''Champions'' fans. In 2001, a reconstituted Hero Games was formed under the leadership of [[Steven S. Long]], who had written several books for the earlier version of the system. It regained the rights to the ''Hero System'' and to the ''Champions'' trademark.\n\nIn 2001, the Fifth Edition of the ''Hero System Rulebook'' was released, incorporating heavy revisions by Long. A large black hardcover, it was critically well received and attained a degree of commercial success. (Following problems with fragile [[Bookbinding|bindings]] on Fourth Edition rulebooks, the planned binding for the larger Fifth Edition was tested using a clothes dryer.<ref>\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20051123133645/http://herogames.com/news/2002/0125.jsp \"News\"], Hero Games website, January 25, 2002</ref>) The Fifth Edition is often referred to as \"FREd\", which is a [[backronym]] for \"Fifth Rules Edition\". The name actually comes from Steve S. Long's reply when asked what the standard abbreviation for the Fifth Edition would be: \"I don't care if you call it 'Fred', as long as you buy it.\" This was made the unofficial nickname by several replies on the same board affirming it after a reply from Willpower, who coined the backronym by saying, \"OK. FREd it is, \"Fifth Rules Edition\"!\" \n\nA revised version ({{ISBN|1-58366-043-7}}) was issued in 2004, along with ''Hero System Sidekick'', a condensed version of the rulebook with a cover price of under $10. Fans often call the revised Fifth Edition \"Fiver,\" ReFREd,\" or \"5ER\" (from \"Fifth Edition revised\"; \"Fiver\" also alludes to ''[[Watership Down]]''). This rulebook is so big (592 pages) that some fans speculated that it might be bulletproof, and it did indeed stop some bullets when tested by Hero Games staffers.<ref>\n[http://www.herogames.com/forums/topic/27407-extra-extra-is-5er-actually-bullet-proof/?page=1 \"Extra Extra: Is 5ER actually bullet proof\"]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3Wmj46S5qo \"Hero Games 5th Edition Rule Book Ballistic Test\"] hosted at [[YouTube]].</ref>\n\nOn February 28, 2008, [[Cryptic Studios]] purchased the ''Champions'' [[intellectual property]], and sold the rights back to Hero Games to publish the 6th edition books. One of the new features will be to allow players to adapt their ''[[Champions Online]]'' characters to the pen-and-paper game.<ref name=\"championspurchase\">{{cite web|url=http://crypticstudios.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=174&Itemid=32|title=Cryptic Studios Announces Champions Online|publisher=[[Cryptic Studios]]|quote=Cryptic Studios also announced today that it has acquired the ''Champions'' intellectual property (IP) from Hero Games. First published in 1981, the ''Champions'' role-playing game is one of the first RPGs to forgo the traditional dice-rolling system of character generation in favor of a point-based system. Cryptic Studios has licensed back to Hero Games the rights to produce Champions RPG books, and the sixth edition of the Hero System and ''Champions'', set to release in 2009, will include rules on how to recreate Champions Online characters and scenarios.}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2008, Hero released a licensed RPG for [[Aaron Williams (cartoonist)|Aaron Williams]]'s popular comic [[PS238]] using a simplified version of the Fifth Edition rules.\n\nIn late 2009, Hero Games released the 6th Edition of the Hero System. The game has so far had a mostly positive reception, with little in the way of 'Edition Wars'. The largest rules change was the removal of Figured Characteristics (meaning that character stats that were previously linked intrinsically\u2014such as Speed automatically increasing when sufficient amounts of Dexterity were purchased\u2014were no longer connected, and instead bought entirely separately). Other, more minor rules changes include folding Armor and Force field into Resistant Defense and reestablishing Regeneration as a separate power. The rules were released in two volumes, with the first covering character creation in depth and the second describing campaigns and the running of games. The new genre book for Champions came out shortly thereafter, and a new ''Fantasy Hero'' was released in the summer of 2010. A new version of Sidekick was released in late 2009 under the title ''The Hero System Basic Rulebook'', while an ''Advanced Player Guide'' was published that had additional options for character creation. Other recent releases included a large book of pre-constructed Powers, a set of pre-generated Martial Arts styles, abilities and skills, a large bestiary, a new [[grimoire]] for Fantasy Hero and a three-volume set of villains for ''Champions''. A new edition of ''Star Hero'' was released in 2011, along with a second ''Advanced Player Guide''.\n\nOn 28 November 2011, Hero Games announced a restructuring, with Darren Watts and long-time developer Steven S. Long relinquishing their full-time statuses to work freelance. In late 2012 ''Champions Complete'' was released, which contained all of the core 6th edition rules as well as enough information to play a superhero campaign in a single 240-page book.

He also studied the forces involved in these separations, inventing the new field of [[electrochemistry]]. In 1799 Davy experimented with [[nitrous oxide]] and became astonished that it made him laugh, so he nicknamed it \"laughing gas\", and wrote about its potential [[Anesthesia|anaesthetic]] properties in relieving pain during surgery.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hardman|first1=Jonathan G.|title=Oxford Textbook of Anaesthesia|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=529}}</ref>\n\n[[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius|Berzelius]] called Davy's 1806 [[Bakerian Lecture]] ''On Some Chemical Agencies of Electricity''<ref name=\"Davy, 1806\" >{{cite web\n |title = On Some Chemical Agencies of Electricity\n |url = http://www.english.upenn.edu/Projects/knarf/Davy/davy5.html\n |accessdate = 2 March 2008\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071026154758/http://www.english.upenn.edu/Projects/knarf/Davy/davy5.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 26 October 2007}}</ref> \"one of the best memoirs which has ever enriched the theory of chemistry.\"<ref name=\"Berzelius, 1818\" >{{cite book\n |last=Berzelius |first=J.

Davy's brother, John Davy, writes that the society of their hometown was characterised by \"an almost unbounded credulity respecting the supernatural and monstrous [...] Amongst the middle and higher classes, there was little taste for literature, and still less for science [...] Hunting, shooting, wrestling, cockfighting, generally ending in drunkenness, were what they most delighted in\".<ref name=\"Davy 1836\">{{cite book |last = Davy |first= John |authorlink = John Davy (chemist) |title = Memoirs of the Life of Sir Humphry Davy |volume = Vol. 1 of 2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EOQ5AAAAcAAJ |location = London, UK|publisher = Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, & Longman |year = 1836}}</ref> At the age of six, Davy was sent to the grammar school at Penzance. Three years later, his family moved to Varfell, near [[Ludgvan]], and subsequently, in term-time Davy boarded with John Tonkin, his godfather and later his guardian.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> On leaving Penzance grammar school in 1793, Tonkin paid for Davy to attend [[Truro Grammar School]] in 1793 to finish his education under the Rev Dr Cardew, who, in a letter to [[Davies Gilbert]], said dryly: \"I could not discern the faculties by which he was afterwards so much distinguished.\" Yet, Davy entertained his school friends with writing poetry, Valentines, and telling stories from [[One Thousand and One Nights]]. Reflecting on his school days, in a letter to his mother, Davy wrote: \"Learning naturally is a true pleasure; how unfortunate then it is that in most schools it is made a pain.\"<ref>{{cite book |last = Knight |first= David |authorlink = David M.

Davy's [[indenture]] is dated 10 February 1795. In the [[apothecary]]'s dispensary, Davy became a chemist, and conducted his earliest chemical experiments in a garret in Tonkin's house. Davy's friends said: \"This boy Humphry is incorrigible. He will blow us all into the air.\" His elder sister complained of the ravages made on her dresses by corrosive substances.<ref name=DNB /> Davy was taught French by a refugee priest, and in 1797 read Lavoisier's ''Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de chimie'': much of his future work can be seen as reacting against Lavoisier's work and the dominance of French chemists.\n\nAs a poet, over one hundred and sixty manuscript poems were written by Davy, the majority of which are found in his personal notebooks. Most of his written poems were not published, and he chose instead to share a few of them with his friends. Eight of his known poems were published. His poems reflected his views on both his career and also his pereception of certain aspects of human life. He wrote on human endeavours and aspects of life like death, metaphysics, geology, natural theology and chemistry.<ref>{{cite book\n |last = Amin |first= Wahida\n |title = The Poetry and Science of Humphry Davy.\n |url = http://usir.salford.ac.uk/30795/1/Wahida_Amin_-_The_Poetry_and_Science_of_Humphry_Davy_-_23.01.14.pdf\n |type = Unpublished PhD thesis, University of Salford, UK\n |year = 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n[[John Ayrton Paris]] remarked that poetry written by the young Davy \"bear the stamp of lofty genius\". Davy's first preserved poem entitled ''The Sons of Genius'' is dated 1795 and marked by the usual immaturity of youth. Other poems written in the following years, especially ''On the Mount's Bay'' and ''St Michael's Mount'', are descriptive verses, showing sensibility but no true poetic imagination. Three of Davy's paintings from around 1796 have been donated to the [[Penlee House]] museum at Penzance. One is of the view from above [[Gulval]] showing the church, [[Mount's Bay]] and [[St Michael's Mount|the Mount]], while the other two depict [[Loch Lomond]] in Scotland.<ref>{{cite news|last=Anon|title=Davy paintings donated to museum|newspaper=[[The Cornishman]]|date=22 September 2011}}</ref><ref>Davy's picture of Mounts Bay was included in the Penlee House exhibition \"Penzance 400: A Celebration of the History of Penzance\" 29 March \u2013 7 June 2014</ref>\n\nWhile writing verses at the age of 17 in honour of his first love, he was eagerly discussing the question of the materiality of heat with his [[Quaker]] friend and mentor [[Robert Dunkin]]. Dunkin remarked: 'I tell thee what, Humphry, thou art the most quibbling hand at a dispute I ever met with in my life.' One winter day he took Davy to the Larigan River,<ref>The Larigan, or Laregan, river is a stream in Penzance.</ref> To show him that rubbing two plates of ice together developed sufficient energy by motion, to melt them, and that after the motion was suspended, the pieces were united by regelation. It was a crude form of analogous experiment exhibited by Davy in the lecture-room of the [[Royal Institution]] that elicited considerable attention.<ref name=DNB /> As professor at the Royal Institution, Davy repeated many of the ingenious experiments he learned from his friend and mentor, Robert Dunkin.\n\nEven though he initially started writing his poems albeit haphazardly, as a reflection of his views on his career, and on life generally, most of his final poems concentrated more on immortality and death. This was after he started experiencing failing health and a decline both in health and career.<ref>{{cite book\n |last = Amin |first= Wahida\n |title = The Poetry and Science of Humphry Davy.\n |url = http://usir.salford.ac.uk/30795/1/Wahida_Amin_-_The_Poetry_and_Science_of_Humphry_Davy_-_23.01.14.pdf\n |type = Unpublished PhD thesis, University of Salford, UK\n |year = 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n==Early scientific interests==\n[[Davies Gilbert|Davies Giddy]] met Davy in [[Penzance]] carelessly swinging on the half-gate of Dr Borlase's house, and interested by his talk invited him to his house at Tredrea and offered him the use of his library. This led to an introduction to Dr Edwards, who lived at Hayle Copper House. Edwards was a lecturer in chemistry in the school of [[St. Bartholomew's Hospital]]. He permitted Davy to use his laboratory and possibly directed his attention to the floodgates of the port of [[Hayle]], which were rapidly decaying as a result of the contact between copper and iron under the influence of [[seawater]]. [[Galvanic corrosion]] was not understood at that time, but the phenomenon prepared Davy's mind for subsequent experiments on ship's [[copper sheathing]]. Gregory Watt, son of [[James Watt (inventor)|James Watt]], visited Penzance for his health's sake, and while lodging at the Davy's house became a friend and gave him instructions in chemistry. Davy was acquainted with the [[Wedgwood]] family, who spent a winter at Penzance.<ref name=DNB />\n\n[[Thomas Beddoes]] and [[John Hailstone]] were engaged in a geological controversy on the rival merits of the [[Plutonism|Plutonian]] and [[Neptunist]] hypotheses. They travelled together to examine the Cornish coast accompanied by Davies Gilbert and made Davy's acquaintance. Beddoes, who had established at [[Bristol]] a 'Pneumatic Institution,' needed an assistant to superintend the laboratory. Gilbert recommended Davy, and in 1798 Gregory Watt showed Beddoes the ''Young man's Researches on Heat and Light'', which were subsequently published by him in the first volume of ''West-Country Contributions''. After prolonged negotiations, mainly by Gilbert, Mrs Davy and Borlase consented to Davy's departure, but Tonkin wished him to remain in his native town as a surgeon, and altered his will when he found that Davy insisted on going to Dr Beddoes.\n\nIn 1802, Humphry Davy had what was then, the most powerful electrical battery in the world at the Royal Institution. With it, Davy created the first [[incandescent light]] by passing electric current through a thin strip of platinum, chosen because the metal had an extremely high melting point. It was neither sufficiently bright nor long lasting enough to be of practical use, but demonstrated the principle. By 1806 he was able to demonstrate a much more powerful form of electric lighting to the [[Royal Society]] in London. It was an early form of [[Arc lamp|arc light]] which produced its illumination from an electric arc created between two charcoal rods.\n\n==Pneumatic Institution==\n[[File:Watt James von Breda.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Watt]] in 1792 by [[Carl Frederik von Breda]]]]\nOn 2 October 1798, Davy joined the [[Pneumatic Institution]] at Bristol. It had been established to investigate the medical powers of factitious airs and gases (gases produced experimentally or artificially), and Davy was to superintend the various experiments. The arrangement agreed between Dr Beddoes and Davy was generous, and enabled Davy to give up all claims on his paternal property in favour of his mother. He did not intend to abandon the medical profession and was determined to study and graduate at Edinburgh, but he soon began to fill parts of the institution with voltaic batteries. While living in Bristol, Davy met the [[Earl of Durham]], who was a resident in the institution for his health, and became close friends with Gregory Watt, [[James Watt]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey]], all of whom became regular users of [[nitrous oxide]] (laughing gas), to which Davy became addicted. The gas was first synthesized in 1772 by the [[natural philosopher]] and chemist [[Joseph Priestley]], who called it ''phlogisticated nitrous air'' (see [[phlogiston]]).<ref name=\"Nitrous Oxide pioneers\" >{{cite web\n  |url=http://journals.lww.com/anesthesiology/citation/1941/09000/The_Development_of_Anesthesia.8.aspx\n  |author=Keys TE\n  |title=The Development of Anesthesia\n  |work=Anesthesiology journal (Sep.1941, vol.2, is.5, p.552-574)\n  |year=1941\n}}</ref> Priestley described his discovery in the book ''Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air (1775)'', in which he described how to produce the preparation of \"nitrous air diminished\", by heating iron filings dampened with [[nitric acid]].<ref name=\"Joseph Priestley\" >{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/nitrous/nitrous_journal1.shtml\n  |author=Priestley J\n  |title=Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air (vol.2, sec.3)\n  |year=1776\n}}</ref>\n[[File:Anaesthesia exhibition, 1946 Wellcome M0009908.jpg|thumb|left|Sir Humphry Davy\u2019s ''Researches chemical and philosophical: chiefly concerning nitrous oxide'' (1800), pages 556 and 557 (right), outlining potential anaesthetic properties of [[nitrous oxide]] in relieving pain during surgery]]\nJames Watt built a portable gas chamber to facilitate Davy's experiments with the inhalation of nitrous oxide. At one point the gas  was combined with wine to judge its efficacy as a cure for [[hangover]] (his laboratory notebook indicated success). The gas was popular among Davy's friends and acquaintances, and he noted that it might be useful for performing surgical operations.<ref>In his 1800 ''Researches, Chemical and Philosophical'' (p.556), Davy commented: \"''As nitrous oxide in its extensive operation appears capable of destroying pain, it may probably be used with advantage during surgical operations in which no great effusion of blood takes place.''\"</ref> [[Anesthetic]]s were not regularly used in medicine or dentistry until decades after Davy's death.<ref name=\"AOW\" >{{cite book|last=Holmes |first=Richard|title=The Age of Wonder|publisher=Pantheon Books  |year=2008  |isbn=978-0-375-42222-5  |ref=Holmes, 2008, AOW}}</ref>\n\nDavy threw himself energetically into the work of the laboratory and formed a long romantic friendship with Mrs Anna Beddoes, the novelist [[Maria Edgeworth|Maria Edgeworth's]] sister, who acted as his guide on walks and other fine sights of the locality.

His respiration of [[nitric oxide]] which may have combined with air in the mouth to form [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>),<ref name=\"Jay2014\" /> severely injured the mucous membrane, and in Davy's attempt to inhale four quarts of \"pure hydrocarbonate\" gas in an experiment with [[carbon monoxide]] he \"seemed sinking into annihilation.\" On being removed into the open air, Davy faintly articulated, \"I do not think I shall die,\"<ref name=\"Jay2014\" /> but some hours elapsed before the painful symptoms ceased.<ref name=\"DNB\" /> Davy was able to take his own pulse as he staggered out of the laboratory and into the garden, and he described it in his notes as \"threadlike and beating with excessive quickness\".\n\nIn this year the first volume of the ''West-Country Collections'' was issued. Half consisted of Davy's essays ''On Heat, Light, and the Combinations of Light'', ''On Phos-oxygen and its Combinations'', and on the ''Theory of Respiration''. On 22 February 1799 Davy, wrote to Davies Gilbert, \"I am now as much convinced of the non-existence of [[Caloric theory|caloric]] as I am of the existence of light.\" In another letter to Gilbert, on 10 April, Davy informs him: \"I made a discovery yesterday which proves how necessary it is to repeat experiments. The gaseous oxide of azote (the laughing gas) is perfectly respirable when pure. It is never deleterious but when it contains nitrous gas. I have found a mode of making it pure.\" He said that he breathed sixteen quarts of it for nearly seven minutes, and that it \"absolutely intoxicated me.\"<ref name=DNB /> \nDavy became increasingly well known in 1799 due to his experiments with the physiological action of some gases, including laughing gas (nitrous oxide).

On the generation of oxygen gas, and the causes of the colors of organic beings.'' Their experimental work was poor, and the publications were harshly criticized.<ref name=\"Kenyon\"/> In after years Davy regretted he had ever published these immature hypotheses, which he subsequently designated \"the dreams of misemployed genius which the light of experiment and observation has never conducted to truth.\"<ref name=DNB />\n\nThese criticisms, however, led Davy to refine and improve his experimental techniques,<ref name=\"Kenyon\"/> spending his later time at the institution increasingly in experimentation.\nIn 1800, Davy informed Gilbert that he had been \"repeating the galvanic experiments with success\" in the intervals of the experiments on the gases, which \"almost incessantly occupied him from January to April.\" In 1800, Davy published his ''Researches, Chemical and Philosophical, chiefly concerning Nitrous Oxide and its Respiration'', and received a more positive response.<ref name=\"Kenyon\"/>\n\n[[William Wordsworth]] and Samuel Taylor Coleridge moved to the [[Lake District]] in 1800, and asked Davy to deal with the Bristol publishers of the [[Lyrical Ballads]], Biggs & Cottle. Coleridge asked Davy to proofread the second edition of the [[Lyrical Ballads]], the first to contain [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth's]] [[Preface to the Lyrical Ballads|Preface]] in a letter dated 16 July 1800: \"Will you be so kind as just to look over the sheets of the lyrical Ballads\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|editor1-last=Griggs|editor1-first=E.

The house in [[Albemarle Street]] was bought in April 1799.{{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=285}} Rumford became secretary to the institution, and Dr [[Thomas Garnett (physician)|Thomas Garnett]] was the first lecturer.\n\n[[Image:Royal Institution - Humphry Davy.jpg|thumb|right|400px|1802 satirical cartoon by [[James Gillray]] showing a [[Royal Institution]] lecture on pneumatics, with Davy holding the bellows and [[Count Rumford]] looking on at extreme right. Dr [[Thomas Garnett (physician)|Thomas Garnett]] is the lecturer, holding the victim's nose.]]\nIn February 1801 Davy was interviewed by the committee of the Royal Institution, comprising [[Joseph Banks]], [[Benjamin Thompson]] (who had been appointed Count Rumford) and [[Henry Cavendish]]. Davy wrote to Davies Gilbert on 8 March 1801 about the offers made by Banks and Thompson, a possible move to London and the promise of funding for his work in galvanism. He also mentioned that he might not be collaborating further with Beddoes on therapeutic gases. The next day Davy left Bristol to take up his new post at the Royal Institution,<ref name=\"AOW\"/> it having been resolved 'that Humphry Davy be engaged in the service of the Royal Institution in the capacity of assistant lecturer in chemistry, director of the chemical laboratory, and assistant editor of the journals of the institution, and that he be allowed to occupy a room in the house, and be furnished with coals and candles, and that he be paid a salary of 100l. per annum.'<ref name=\"DNB\" />\n\nOn 25 April 1801, Davy gave his first lecture on the relatively new subject of 'Galvanism'. He and his friend Coleridge had had many conversations about the nature of human knowledge and progress, and Davy's lectures gave his audience a vision of human civilisation brought forward by scientific discovery. \"It [science] has bestowed on him powers which may almost be called creative; which have enabled him to modify and change the beings surrounding him, and by his experiments to interrogate nature with power, not simply as a scholar, passive and seeking only to understand her operations, but rather as a master, active with his own instruments.\"<ref name=\"AOW\"/> The first lecture garnered rave reviews, and by the June lecture Davy wrote to John King that his last lecture had attendance of nearly 500 people. \"There was Respiration, Nitrous Oxide, and unbounded Applause. Amen!\"<ref name=\"AOW\"/>\nDavy revelled in his public status.\n\nDavy's lectures included spectacular and sometimes dangerous chemical demonstrations along with scientific information, and were presented with considerable showmanship by the young and handsome man.<ref name=\"Distillations\">{{cite journal|last1=Knight|first1=David|title=Left Behind|journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=2|issue=4|pages=40\u201343|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/left-behind|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> \nDavy also included both poetic and religious commentary in his lectures, emphasizing that God's design was revealed by chemical investigations.   Religious commentary was in part an attempt to appeal to women in his audiences. Davy, like many of his enlightenment contemporaries, supported female education and women's involvement in scientific pursuits, even proposing that women be admitted to evening events at the Royal Society.\nDavy acquired a large female following around London. In a satirical cartoon by Gillray, nearly half of the attendees pictured are female. His support of women caused Davy to be subjected to considerable gossip and innuendo, and to be criticized as unmanly.<ref name=\"Golinski\">{{cite book|last1=Golinski|first1=Jan|title=The Experimental Self: Humphry Davy and the Making of a Man of Science|date=2016|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226351360|pages=70\u201385}}</ref>\n\nWhen Davy's lecture series on Galvanism ended, he progressed to a new series on [[Agricultural Chemistry]], and his popularity continued to skyrocket.

He went on to electrolyse molten salts and discovered several new metals, including [[sodium]] and [[potassium]], highly reactive elements known as the [[alkali metal]]s. Davy discovered potassium in 1807, deriving it from [[caustic potash]] (KOH). Before the 19th century, no distinction had been made between potassium and sodium. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Davy isolated sodium in the same year by passing an electric current through molten [[sodium hydroxide]].<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\n===Discovery of calcium, magnesium, strontium and barium===\nDuring the first half of 1808, Davy conducted a series of further electrolysis experiments on alkaline earths including lime, magnesia, strontites and barytes. At the beginning of June, Davy received a letter from the Swedish chemist [[Berzelius]] claiming that he, in conjunction with Dr. Pontin, had successfully obtained amalgams of calcium and barium by electrolysing lime and barytes using a mercury cathode. Davy managed to successfully repeat these experiments almost immediately and expanded Berzelius' method to strontites and magnesia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Humphry|title=Electrochemical Researches, on the Decomposition of the Earths; With Observations in the Metals Obtained from the Alkaline Earths, and on the Amalgam Procured from Ammonia|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|date=1808|volume=98|pages=339\u2013340|doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0023}}</ref> He noted that while these amalgams oxidated in only a few minutes when exposed to air they could be preserved for lengthy periods of time when submerged in [[naphtha]] before becoming covered with a white crust.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Humphry|title=Electro-Chemical Researches, on the Decomposition of the Earths; With Observations on the Metals Obtained from the Alkaline Earths, and on the Amalgam Procured from Ammonia|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|date=1808|volume=98|page=340|doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0023}}</ref>\nOn 30 June 1808 Davy reported to the Royal Society that he had successfully isolated four new metals which he named [[barium]], [[calcium]], [[strontium]] and magnium (later changed to [[magnesium]]) which were subsequently published in the ''Philosophical Transactions''.

The Revd Dr Robert Gray of [[Bishopwearmouth]] in Sunderland, founder of the Society for Preventing Accidents in Coalmines, had written to Davy suggesting that he might use his 'extensive stores of chemical knowledge' to address the issue of mining explosions caused by [[firedamp]], or [[methane]] mixed with oxygen, which was often ignited by the open flames of the lamps then used by miners. Incidents such as the [[Felling mine disaster]] of 1812 near [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], in which 92 men were killed, not only caused great loss of life among miners but also meant that their widows and children had to be supported by the public purse. The Revd Gray and a fellow clergyman also working in a north-east mining area, the Revd John Hodgson of [[Jarrow]], were keen that action should be taken to improve underground lighting and especially the lamps used by miners.<ref>Knight, David (1992). Humphry Davy: Science and Power. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, pp. 105-6. {{ISBN|0-631-16816-8}}.</ref>\n\nDavy conceived of using an iron gauze to enclose a lamp's flame, and so prevent the methane burning inside the lamp from passing out to the general atmosphere. Although the idea of the [[safety lamp]] had already been demonstrated by [[William Reid Clanny]] and by the then unknown (but later very famous) engineer [[George Stephenson]], Davy's use of [[wire gauze]] to prevent the spread of flame was used by many other inventors in their later designs. George Stephenson's lamp was very popular in the north-east coalfields, and used the same principle of preventing the flame reaching the general atmosphere, but by different means.{{sfn |Holmes |2008 |pp=364\u2013373}} Unfortunately, although the new design of gauze lamp initially did seem to offer protection, it gave much less light, and quickly deteriorated in the wet conditions of most pits. Rusting of the gauze quickly made the lamp unsafe, and the number of deaths from firedamp explosions rose yet further.\n\nThere was some discussion as to whether Davy had discovered the principles behind his lamp without the help of the work of [[Smithson Tennant]], but it was generally agreed that the work of both men had been independent. Davy refused to patent the lamp, and its invention led to his being awarded the [[Rumford medal]] in 1816.<ref name=\"ODNB\" >[[David M.

When acids reacted with metals they formed [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]s and hydrogen gas. [[Base (chemistry)|Base]]s were substances that reacted with acids to form salts and water.

His early experiments showed hope of success. In his report to the Royal Society Davy writes that: \n'When a fragment of a brown MS. in which the layers were strongly adhered, was placed in an atmosphere of chlorine, there was an immediate action, the papyrus smoked and became yellow, and the letters appeared much more distinct; and by the application of heat the layers separated from each other, giving fumes of muriatic acid.'<ref>[[#Davy, 1821|Davy, 1821]], page 193</ref><ref name=\"Davy\">{{cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Humphry|title=Some Observations and Experiments on the Papyri Found in the Ruins of Herculaneum|journal=Philosophical Transactions|date=January 1821|volume=111|pages=191\u2013208|jstor=107613|bibcode=1821RSPT..111..191D|doi=10.1098/rstl.1821.0016}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the early trials prompted Davy to travel to Naples to conduct further research on the Herculaneum papyri.

Between 1820 and 1825, Davy, assisted by [[Michael Faraday]], attempted to protect the copper by [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] means. He attached sacrificial pieces of [[zinc]] or [[iron]] to the copper, which provided [[cathodic protection]] to the host metal.<ref name=\"Knight\">{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=David|title=Humphry Davy: Science and Power|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}</ref> It was discovered, however, that protected copper became foul quickly, i.e. pieces of weed and/or marine creatures became attached to the hull, which had a detrimental effect on the handling of the ship. The [[Navy Board]] approached Davy in 1822, asking for help. Davy conducted a number of tests in [[Portsmouth Dockyard]], which led to the Navy Board adopting the use of Davy's \"protectors\". By 1824, it had become apparent that fouling of the copper bottoms was still occurring on the majority of protected ships. By the end of 1825, the [[Admiralty]] ordered the Navy Board to cease fitting the protectors to sea-going ships, and to remove those that had already been fitted. Davy's scheme was seen as a public failure, despite the fact that, as Frank A. J. L. James comments, \"The somewhat ironical problem [...] was not that they were unsuccessful. They did after all preserve the copper as Davy said they would. The problem was that the protectors, on most ships, had a chemical side effect which provided nutrients for weeds, barnacles etc. thus fouling the ships\".<ref name=\"Physis\" />\n\n==President of the Royal Society==\nElections took place on St Andrew's Day and Davy was elected on 30 November 1820. Although he was unopposed, other candidates had received initial backing. These candidates embodied the factional difficulties that beset Davy's presidency and which eventually defeated him.\n\nThe Society was in transition from a club for gentlemen interested in natural philosophy, connected with the political and social elite, to an academy representing increasingly specialised sciences. The previous president, [[Joseph Banks]], had held the post for over 40 years and had presided autocratically over what [[David Philip Miller]] calls the \"Banksian Learned Empire\", in which natural history was prominent.<ref>[[David Philip Miller,]] \"Between hostile camps: Sir Humphry Davy's presidency of the Royal Society of London\", ''British Journal for the History of Science'' (1983): 1-47.</ref>\n\nBanks had groomed the engineer, author and politician [[Davies Gilbert]] to succeed him and preserve the status quo, but Gilbert declined to stand. Fellows who thought royal patronage was important proposed Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (later [[Leopold I of Belgium]]), who also withdrew, as did the Whig [[Edward St Maur, 11th Duke of Somerset]]. Davy was the outstanding scientist but some fellows did not approve of his popularising work at the Royal Institution.\n\nThe strongest alternative had been [[William Hyde Wollaston]], who was supported by the \"Cambridge Network\" of outstanding mathematicians such as [[Charles Babbage]] and [[John Herschel]], who tried to block Davy. They were aware that Davy supported some modernisation, but thought that he would not sufficiently encourage aspiring young mathematicians, astronomers and geologists, who were beginning to form specialist societies. Davy was only 41, and reformers were fearful of another long presidency.\n\nIn his early years Davy was optimistic about reconciling the reformers and the Banksians. In his first speech as president he declared, \"I trust that, with these new societies, we shall always preserve the most amicable relations... I am sure there is no desire in [the Royal Society] to exert anything like patriarchal authority in relation to these institutions\".<ref>Cited in David Philip Miller, \"Between hostile camps: Sir Humphry Davy's presidency of the Royal Society of London\", ''British Journal for the History of Science'' (1983): 30-31.</ref>\n\nDavy spent much time juggling the factions but, as his reputation declined in the light of failures such as his research into copper-bottomed ships, he lost popularity and authority. This was compounded by a number of political errors. In 1825 his promotion of the new Zoological Society, of which he was a founding fellow, courted the landed gentry and alienated expert zoologists. He offended the mathematicians and reformers by failing to ensure that Babbage received one of the new Royal Medals (a project of his) or the vacant secretaryship of the Society in 1826. In November 1826 the mathematician Edward Ryan recorded that: \"The Society, every member almost... are in the greatest rage at the President's proceedings and nothing is now talked of but removing him.\"<ref>Cited in David Philip Miller, \"Between hostile camps: Sir Humphry Davy's presidency of the Royal Society of London\", ''British Journal for the History of Science'' (1983): 39.</ref>\n\nIn the event he was again re-elected unopposed, but he was now visibly unwell. In January 1827 he set off to Italy for reasons of his health. It did not improve and, as the 1827 election loomed, it was clear that he would not stand again. He was succeeded by [[Davies Gilbert]].\n\n==Last years and death==\n[[Image:M Faraday Th Phillips oil 1842.jpg|thumb|180px|upright|left|[[Michael Faraday]], portrait by [[Thomas Phillips]] c. 1841\u20131842<ref>[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?mkey=mw02170 National Portrait gallery NPG 269]</ref>]]\nIn January 1819, Davy was awarded a [[baronet]]cy. Although [[Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon]] (also later made a peer<ref>As Baron Verulam and later Viscount St Alban.</ref>) and [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] had already been [[knight]]ed, this was, at the time, the first such honour ever conferred on a man of science in Britain. This was followed a year later with the Presidency of the [[Royal Society]].\n\nDavy's laboratory assistant, [[Michael Faraday]], went on to enhance Davy's work and would become the more famous and influential scientist. Davy is supposed to have even claimed Faraday as his greatest discovery. Davy later accused Faraday of [[plagiarism]], however, causing Faraday (the first [[Fullerian Professor of Chemistry]]) to cease all research in [[classical electromagnetism|electromagnetism]] until his mentor's death.\n\nOf a sanguine, somewhat irritable temperament, Davy displayed characteristic enthusiasm and energy in all his pursuits. As is shown by his verses and sometimes by his prose, his mind was highly imaginative; the poet Coleridge declared that if he \"had not been the first chemist, he would have been the first poet of his age\", and Southey said that \"he had all the elements of a poet; he only wanted the art.\" In spite of his ungainly exterior and peculiar manner, his happy gifts of exposition and illustration won him extraordinary popularity as a lecturer, his experiments were ingenious and rapidly performed, and Coleridge went to hear him \"to increase his stock of metaphors.\" The dominating ambition of his life was to achieve fame; occasional petty jealousy did not diminish his concern for the \"cause of humanity\", to use a phrase often employed by him in connection with his invention of the miners' lamp. Careless about etiquette, his frankness sometimes exposed him to annoyances  he might have avoided by the exercise of tact.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Davy, Sir Humphry|volume=7|pages=871-873}}</ref>\n\nAccording to one of Davy's biographers, [[June Z.

Published posthumously, the work became a staple of both scientific and family libraries for several decades afterward. Davy spent the winter in Rome, hunting in the [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]] on his fiftieth birthday. But on 20 February 1829 he had another stroke. After spending many months attempting to recuperate, Davy died in a hotel room in Geneva, Switzerland, on 29 May 1829.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nHe had wished to be buried where he died, but had also wanted the burial delayed in case he was only [[coma]]tose.

While many researchers favor the idea that she has Anatolian origins, it has been argued that \"Hecate must have been a Greek goddess.\"<ref>Berg 1974, p. 134. Berg's argument for a Greek origin rests on three main points: 1. Almost all archaeological and literary evidence for her cult comes from the Greek mainland, and especially from Attica\u2014all of which dates earlier than the 2nd century BCE. 2. In Asia Minor only one monument can be associated with Hecate prior to the 2nd century BCE. 3. The supposed connection between Hecate and attested \"Carian theophoric names\" is not convincing, and instead suggests an aspect of the process of her Hellenization. He concludes, \"Arguments for Hecate's \"Anatolian\" origin are not in accord with evidence.\"</ref> The monuments to Hecate in [[Phrygia]] and Caria are numerous but of late date.<ref>Kraus 1960, p. 52; list pp.166ff.</ref>\n\nWilliam Berg observes, \"Since children are not called after spooks, it is safe to assume that Carian theophoric names involving ''hekat-'' refer to a major deity free from the dark and unsavoury ties to the underworld and to witchcraft associated with the Hecate of classical Athens.\"<ref>Berg 1974, p. 129.</ref> In particular, there is some evidence that she might be derived from the local [[solar deity|sun goddesses]] (see also [[Arinna]]), based on similar attributes.<ref>Mary Bachvarova, Hecate: An Anatolian Sun-Goddess of the Underworld, SSRN Electronic Journal \u00b7 May 2010\nDOI: 10.2139/ssrn.1608145</ref> She also closely parallels the Roman goddess [[Trivia (mythology)|Trivia]], with whom she was sometimes identified in Rome, although Trivia was more commonly identified with [[Artemis]] by authors such as [[Lucretius]].<ref>Lucretius, ''[[De rerum natura]]'', i. 84,</ref>\n\nIf Hecate's cult spread from Anatolia into Greece, it is possible it presented a conflict, as her role was already filled by other more prominent deities in the Greek pantheon, above all by [[Artemis]] and [[Selene]]. This line of reasoning lies behind the widely accepted hypothesis that she was a foreign deity who was incorporated into the Greek pantheon. Other than in the ''Theogony'', the Greek sources do not offer a consistent story of her parentage, or of her relations in the Greek pantheon: sometimes Hecate is related as a Titaness, and a mighty helper and protector of humans.\n\n==Cult==\nShrines to Hecate were placed at doorways to both homes and cities with the belief that it would protect from restless dead and other spirits. Likewise, shrines to Hecate at three way crossroads were created where food offerings were left at the new moon to protect those who did so from spirits and other evils.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Cult/HekateCult.html |title=CULT OF HEKATE : Ancient Greek religion |publisher=Theoi.com |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>\n\nDogs were sacred to Hecate and associated with roads, domestic spaces, purification, and spirits of the dead. Dogs were also sacrificed to the road.<ref>As Sterckx (2002) observes, \"The use of dog sacrifices at the gates and doors of the living and the dead as well as its use in travel sacrifices suggest that dogs were perceived as daemonic animals operating in the liminal or transitory realm between the domestic and the unknown, danger-stricken outside world\". Roel Sterckx, ''The Animal and The Daemon in Early China'', State University of New York Press, 2002, pp 232-233. Sterckx explicitly recognizes the similarities between these ancient Chinese views of dogs and those current in Greek and Roman antiquity, and goes on to note \"Dog sacrifice was also a common practice among the Greeks where the dog figured prominently as a guardian of the underworld.\" (Footnote 113, p318)</ref>\nThis can be compared to Pausanias' report that in the Ionian city of Colophon in Asia Minor a sacrifice of a black female puppy was made to Hecate as \"the wayside goddess\", and Plutarch's observation that in Boeotia dogs were killed in purificatory rites. Dogs, with puppies often mentioned, were offered to Hecate at crossroads, which were sacred to the goddess.<ref>Frederick J. Simoons, ''Eat Not This Flesh: Food Avoidances from Prehistory to the Present'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, pp 233-234</ref>\n\n===Sanctuaries===\n\nHecate was a popular divinity, and her cult was practiced with many local variations all over Greece and Western Anatolia.  However, she did not have many known sanctuaries or temples dedicated to her aside from her most famous temple in Lagina.  There was a Temple of Hecate in [[Argolis]]: \"Over against the sanctuary of Eilethyia is a temple of Hekate [the goddess probably here identified with the apotheosed [[Iphigeneia]]], and the image is a work of Skopas. This one is of stone, while the bronze images opposite, also of Hekate, were made respectively by Polykleitos and his brother Naukydes.\"<ref>Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 22. 7</ref>  \nThere were also a shrine to Hecate in [[Aigina]], where she was very popular:\n: \"Of the gods, the Aiginetans worship most Hekate, in whose honour every year they celebrate mystic rites which, they say, Orpheus the Thrakian established among them. Within the enclosure is a temple; its wooden image is the work of Myron, and it has one face and one body. It was Alkamenes, in my opinion, who first made three images of Hekate attached to one another [in Athens].\"<ref>Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 30. 2 (trans. Jones)</ref>\nAside from her own temples, Hecate was also worshipped in the sanctuaries of other gods, where she was apparently sometimes given her own space. There was an area sacred to Hecate in the precincts of the [[Temple of Artemis at Ephesus]], where the priests, ''megabyzi'', officiated.<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'', 14.1.23</ref>  This sanctuary was called ''Hekatesion'' (Shrine of Hekate).<ref>Strabo, Geography 14. 1. 23 (trans. Jones)</ref>  Hecate was also worshipped in the Temple of Athena in Titane: \"In Titane there is also a sanctuary of Athena, into which they bring up the image of Koronis [mother of Asklepios] . . . The sanctuary is built upon a hill, at the bottom of which is an Altar of the Winds, and on it the priest sacrifices to the winds one night in every year. He also performs other secret rites [of Hekate] at four pits, taming the fierceness of the blasts [of the winds], and he is said to chant as well the charms of Medea.\"<ref>Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 12. 1</ref>\nShe was most commonly worshipped in nature, where she had many natural sanctuaries. An important sanctuary of Hecate was a holy cave on the island of [[Samothrake]] called Zerynthos: \n:\"In Samothrake there were certain initiation-rites, which they supposed efficacious as a charm against certain dangers. In that place were also the mysteries of the Korybantes [Kabeiroi] and those of Hekate and the Zerinthian cave, where they sacrificed dogs. The initiates supposed that these things save [them] from terrors and from storms.\"<ref>Suidas s.v.

There are two temples in the country of the Stratonikeians, of which the most famous, that of Hekate, is at Lagina; and it draws great festal assemblies every year.\"<ref>Strabo, Geography 14. 2. 15 (trans. Jones)</ref>\n\nLagina, where the famous temple of Hecate drew great festal assemblies every year, lay close to the originally [[Macedon]]ian [[colonies in antiquity|colony]] of [[Stratonicea (Caria)|Stratonikeia]], where she was the city's patron.<ref>Strabo, ''Geography'' 14.2.25; Kraus 1960.</ref>  In Thrace she played a role similar to that of lesser-[[Hermes]], namely a ruler of [[Liminality|liminal]] regions,particularly gates, and the wilderness. \n\n====Cult at Byzanitum====\n\nHecate was greatly worshipped in [[Byzantium]]. She was said to have saved the city from Philip II, warning the citizens of a night time attack by a light in the sky, for which she was known as ''Hecate Lampadephoros''. The tale is preserved in the [[Suda]].<ref>\"In 340 B.C., however, the Byzantines, with the aid of the Athenians, withstood a siege successfully, an occurrence the more remarkable as they were attacked by the greatest general of the age, Philip of Macedon.    In the course of this beleaguerment, it is related, on a certain wet and moonless night the enemy attempted a surprise, but were foiled by reason of a bright light which, appearing suddenly in the heavens, startled all the dogs in the town and thus roused the garrison to a sense of their danger. To commemorate this timely phenomenon, which was attributed to Hecate, they erected a public statue to that goddess [...]\" William Gordon Holmes, ''The Age of Justinian and Theodora'', 2003, pp. 5-6; \"If any goddess had a connection with the walls in Constantinople, it was Hecate. \n\nHecate had a cult in Byzantium from the time of its founding. Like Byzas in one legend, she had her origins in Thrace. Since Hecate was the guardian of \"liminal places\", in Byzantium small temples in her honor were placed close to the gates of the city. Hecate's importance to Byzantium was above all as deity of protection. When Philip of Macedon was about to attack the city, according to the legend she alerted the townspeople with her ever-present torches, and with her pack of dogs, which served as her constant companions.    Her mythic qualities thenceforth forever entered the fabric of Byzantine history.     A statue known as the 'Lampadephoros' was erected on the hill above the Bosphorous to commemorate Hecate's defensive aid.\" Vasiliki Limberis, ''Divine Heiress'', Routledge, 1994, pp. 126-127; this story apparently survived in the works Hesychius of Miletus, who in all probability lived in the time of Justinian.

In Greek, deipnon means the evening meal, usually the largest meal of the day.

The goddess is seated on a throne with a chaplet bound round her head; she is altogether without attributes and character, and the main historical value of this work, which is evidently of quite a general type and gets a special reference and name merely from the inscription, is that it proves the single shape to be her earlier form, and her recognition at [[Athens]] to be earlier than the Persian invasion.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n[[File:Hekate Kharites Glyptothek Munich 60.jpg|thumb|left|Triple Hecate and the [[Charites]], Attic, 3rd century BCE ([[Glyptothek]], Munich)]]\nThe 2nd-century travel writer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] stated that Hecate was first depicted in triplicate by the sculptor [[Alkamenes]] in the Greek Classical period of the late 5th century BCE<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> which was placed before the temple of the Wingless Nike in Athens.

Her approach was heralded by the howling of a dog. The dog was Hecate's regular sacrificial animal, and was often eaten in solemn sacrament.\"<ref>Alberta Mildred Franklin, ''The Lupercalia'', Columbia University, 1921, p67</ref> The sacrifice of dogs to Hecate is attested for Thrace, Samothrace, Colophon, and Athens.<ref name=\"OCD671\" />\n\nIt has been claimed that her association with dogs is \"suggestive of her connection with birth, for the dog was sacred to [[Eileithyia]], Genetyllis, and other birth goddesses. Although in later times Hecate's dog came to be thought of as a manifestation of restless souls or demons who accompanied her, its docile appearance and its accompaniment of a Hecate who looks completely friendly in many pieces of ancient art suggests that its original signification was positive and thus likelier to have arisen from the dog's connection with birth than the dog's underworld associations.\"<ref>Sarah Iles Johnston, ''Restless Dead'', University of California Press, 1999, pp. 211-212.</ref> The association with dogs, particularly female dogs, could be explained by a metamorphosis myth in [[Lycophron]]: the friendly looking female dog accompanying Hecate was originally the Trojan Queen Hekabe, who leapt into the sea after the fall of Troy and was transformed by Hecate into her familiar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/LycophronAlexandra.html|title=LYCOPHRON, ALEXANDRA&nbsp;\u2013 Theoi Classical Texts Library|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAnother metamorphosis myth explains why the polecat is also associated with Hecate.  From [[Antoninus Liberalis]]:\n\"At Thebes Proitos had a daughter Galinthias. This maiden was playmate and companion of Alkmene, daughter of Elektryon. As the birth throes for Herakles were pressing on Alkmene, the Moirai (Fates) and Eileithyia (Birth-Goddess), as a favour to Hera, kept Alkmene in continuous birth pangs. They remained seated, each keeping their arms crossed. Galinthias, fearing that the pains of her labour would drive Alkmene mad, ran to the Moirai and Eleithyia and announced that by desire of Zeus a boy had been born to Alkmene and that their prerogatives had been abolished.\n\nAt all this, consternation of course overcame the Moirai and they immediately let go their arms. Alkmene\u2019s pangs ceased at once and Herakles was born. The Moirai were aggrieved at this and took away the womanly parts of Galinthias since, being but a mortal, she had deceived the gods. They turned her into a deceitful weasel (or polecat), making her live in crannies and gave her a grotesque way of mating. She is mounted through the ears and gives birth by bringing forth her young through the throat. Hekate felt sorry for this transformation of her appearance and appointed her a sacred servant of herself.\"<ref>Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 29, translation by Francis Celoria, Psychology Press, 1992</ref>\n\nAelian told a different story of a woman transformed into a polecat:  \"\"I have heard that the polecat was once a human being. It has also reached my hearing that Gale was her name then; that she was a dealer in spells and a sorceress (Pharmakis); that she was extremely incontinent, and that she was afflicted with abnormal sexual desires. Nor has it escaped my notice that the anger of the goddess Hekate transformed it into this evil creature. May the goddess be gracious to me: fables and their telling I leave to others.\"<ref>On the Characteristics of Animals by Aelian, translated by Alwyn Faber Scholfield, Harvard University Press, 1958</ref>\n\n[[Athenaeus of Naucratis]], drawing on the etymological speculation of [[Apollodorus of Athens]], notes that the [[red mullet]] is sacred to Hecate, \"on account of the resemblance of their names; for that the goddess is ''trimorphos'', of a triple form\". The Greek word for mullet was ''trigle'' and later ''trigla''. He goes on to quote a fragment of verse \"O mistress Hecate, Trioditis / With three forms and three faces / Propitiated with mullets\".<ref>Charles Duke Yonge, tr., ''The Learned Banqueters'', H.G. Bohn, 1854.</ref> In relation to Greek concepts of pollution, Parker observes, \"The fish that was most commonly banned was the red mullet (''trigle''), which fits neatly into the pattern. It 'delighted in polluted things,' and 'would eat the corpse of a fish or a man'. Blood-coloured itself, it was sacred to the blood-eating goddess Hecate. It seems a symbolic summation of all the negative characteristics of the creatures of the deep.\"<ref>Robert Parker, ''Miasma: Pollution and Purification in Early Greek Religion'', Oxford University Press, 1990, pp. 362-363.</ref> At Athens, it is said there stood a statue of Hecate ''Triglathena'', to whom the red mullet was offered in sacrifice.<ref>William Martin Leake, ''The Topography of Athens'', London, 1841, p. 492.</ref> After mentioning that this fish was sacred to Hecate, Alan Davidson writes, \"Cicero, Horace, Juvenal, Martial, Pliny, Seneca and Suetonius have left abundant and interesting testimony to the red mullet fever which began to affect wealthy Romans during the last years of the Republic and really gripped them in the early Empire. The main symptoms were a preoccupation with size, the consequent rise to absurd heights of the prices of large specimens, a habit of keeping red mullet in captivity, and the enjoyment of the highly specialized aesthetic experience induced by watching the color of the dying fish change.\"<ref>Alan Davidson, ''Mediterranean Seafood'', Ten Speed Press, 2002, p. 92.</ref>\n\nThe [[frog]], which was also the symbol of the similarly-named Egyptian goddess [[Heqet]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Armour |first=Robert A. |year=2001 |title=Gods and Myths of Ancient Egypt |publisher=American University in Cairo Press |isbn= |page=116}}</ref> has also become sacred to Hecate in modern Pagan literature, possibly due in part to its ability to cross between two elements.<ref>Varner, Gary R.

He gave her splendid gifts, to have a share of the earth and the unfruitful sea. She received honor also in starry heaven, and is honored exceedingly by the deathless gods. For to this day, whenever any one of men on earth offers rich sacrifices and prays for favor according to custom, he calls upon Hecate. Great honor comes full easily to him whose prayers the goddess receives favorably, and she bestows wealth upon him; for the power surely is with her. For as many as were born of Earth and Ocean amongst all these she has her due portion. The son of Cronos did her no wrong nor took anything away of all that was her portion among the former Titan gods: but she holds, as the division was at the first from the beginning, privilege both in earth, and in heaven, and in sea.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:404-452 411\u2013425].</ref>}}\n\nAccording to Hesiod, she held sway over many things:\n{{blockquote|text=Whom she will she greatly aids and advances: she sits by worshipful kings in judgement, and in the assembly whom she will is distinguished among the people. And when men arm themselves for the battle that destroys men, then the goddess is at hand to give victory and grant glory readily to whom she will. Good is she also when men contend at the games, for there too the goddess is with them and profits them: and he who by might and strength gets the victory wins the rich prize easily with joy, and brings glory to his parents. And she is good to stand by horsemen, whom she will: and to those whose business is in the grey discomfortable sea, and who pray to Hecate and the loud-crashing Earth-Shaker, easily the glorious goddess gives great catch, and easily she takes it away as soon as seen, if so she will. She is good in the byre with Hermes to increase the stock. The droves of kine and wide herds of goats and flocks of fleecy sheep, if she will, she increases from a few, or makes many to be less. So, then, albeit her mother's only child, she is honored amongst all the deathless gods. And the son of Cronos made her a nurse of the young who after that day saw with their eyes the light of all-seeing Dawn. So from the beginning she is a nurse of the young, and these are her honours.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:404-452 429\u2013452].</ref>}}\n\n[[Hesiod]] emphasizes that Hecate was an only child, the daughter of [[Perses (Titan)|Perses]] and [[Asteria (Titaness)|Asteria]], the sister of [[Leto]] (the mother of [[Artemis]] and [[Apollo]]). Grandmother of the three cousins was [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]] the ancient Titaness who personified the moon.\n\nHesiod's inclusion and praise of Hecate in the ''[[Theogony]]'' has been troublesome for scholars, in that he seems to hold her in high regard, while the testimony of other writers, and surviving evidence, suggests that this may have been the exception. One theory is that [[Hesiod]]'s original village had a substantial Hecate following and that his inclusion of her in the ''Theogony'' was a way of adding to her prestige by spreading word of her among his readers.<ref name=\"Restless_Dead\">Johnston, Sarah Iles, (1991).

Subsequently, she became Persephone's companion on her yearly journey to and from the realms of Hades; serving as a [[psychopomp]]. Because of this association, Hecate was one of the chief goddesses of the Eleusinian Mysteries, alongside Demeter and Persephone.<ref name=\"Charles M 1986 pp. 307-318\"/>\n\nVariations in interpretations of Hecate's role or roles can be traced in classical Athens. In two fragments of [[Aeschylus]] she appears as a great goddess. In [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] she is characterized as the mistress of witchcraft and the [[Keres (mythology)|Keres]].\n\nOne surviving group of stories{{clarify|date=November 2017}} suggests how Hecate might have come to be incorporated into the Greek pantheon without affecting the privileged position of Artemis. Here, Hecate is a mortal priestess often associated with [[Iphigeneia]]. She scorns and insults Artemis, who in retribution eventually brings about the mortal's suicide.<ref name=\"Restless_Dead\"/>\n\n===Hellenistic period to Late Antiquity===\nHecate is the primary feminine figure in the ''[[Chaldean Oracles]]'' (2nd-3rd century CE),<ref>The ''Chaldean Oracles'' is a collection of literature that date from somewhere between the 2nd century and the late 3rd century, the recording of which is traditionally attributed to Julian the Chaldaean or his son, Julian the Theurgist.

[Diviners] spin this sphere and make invocations. Such things they call charms, whether it is the matter of a spherical object, or a triangular one, or some other shape. While spinning them, they call out unintelligible or beast-like sounds, laughing and flailing at the air. [Hekate] teaches the ''taketes'' to operate, that is the movement of the top, as if it had an ineffable power. It is called the top of Hekate because it is dedicated to her.

Trombley, ''Hellenic Religion and Christianization, C. 370-529'', Brill, 1993, p. 319.</ref>\n\nIn Hellenistic syncretism, Hecate also became closely associated with [[Isis]].

In the latter model, the HSC first generates a common myeloid-erythroid progenitor (CMEP) and a common lymphoid progenitor (CLP). The CLP produces only T or B cells. The myeloid-based model postulates that HSCs first diverge into the CMEP and a common myelo-lymphoid progenitor (CMLP), which generates T and B cell progenitors through a bipotential myeloid-T progenitor and a myeloid-B progenitor stage. The main difference is that in this new model, all erythroid, T and B lineage branches retain the potential to generate myeloid cells (even after the segregation of T and B cell lineages). The model proposes the idea of erythroid, T and B cells as specialized types of a prototypic myeloid HSC.<ref>Kawamoto, Wada, Katsura.

The most widespread national custom is the practice of [[first-footing]], which starts immediately after midnight. This involves being the first person to cross the threshold of a friend or neighbour and often involves the giving of symbolic gifts such as [[salt]] (less common today), [[coal]], [[shortbread]], [[whisky]], and [[black bun]] (a rich [[fruit cake]]), intended to bring different kinds of luck to the householder. Food and drink (as the gifts) are then given to the guests. This may go on throughout the early hours of the morning and well into the next day (although modern days see people visiting houses well into the middle of January). The first-foot is supposed to set the luck for the rest of the year.

After the sprinkling of the water in every room, on the beds and all the inhabitants, the house is sealed up tight and branches of juniper are set on fire and carried throughout the house and byre. The juniper smoke is allowed to thoroughly fumigate the buildings until it causes sneezing and coughing among the inhabitants.

Conversely, 1 and 2 January are public holidays and Hogmanay still is associated with as much celebration as Christmas in Scotland. Most Scots still celebrate New Year's Day with a special dinner, usually [[steak pie]].<ref name=\"aberdeen\">'[http://www.aboutaberdeen.com/hogmanaycustoms.php Scottish Hogmanay Customs and Traditions at New Year]' at ''[http://www.aboutaberdeen.com About Aberdeen]''.

It is possibly related to [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''khomestoru'', which is either a blend of the root of [[Russian language|Russian]] \u0445\u043e\u043c\u044f\u043a (''khomyak'') \"hamster\" and a Baltic word (cf. [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''staras'' \"hamster\");<ref>Douglas Harper, ''The Online Etymology Dictionary'', [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hamster entry for \"hamster\"]</ref> or of Persian origin (cf.

They have thick, silky fur, which can be long or short, colored black, grey, honey, white, brown, yellow, red, or a mix, depending on the species. Two species of hamster belonging to the genus ''[[Phodopus]]'', [[Campbell's dwarf hamster]] (''P. campbelli'') and the [[Djungarian hamster]] (''P. sungorus''), and two of the genus ''[[Cricetulus]]'', the [[Chinese striped hamster]] (''C. barabensis'') and the [[Chinese hamster]] (''C. griseus'') have a dark stripe down their heads to their tails. The species of genus ''Phodopus'' are the smallest, with bodies {{Convert|5.5|to|10.5|cm|1|abbr=on}} long; the largest is the [[European hamster]] (''Cricetus cricetus''), measuring up to {{Convert|34|cm|1|abbr=on}} long, not including a short tail of up to {{Convert|6|cm|1|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:Yawning white syrian hamster.jpeg|thumb|right|A white Syrian hamster showing large incisors]]\nThe hamster tail can be difficult to see, as it is usually not very long (about 1/6 the length of the body), with the exception of the [[Chinese hamster]], which has a tail the same length as the body. One rodent characteristic that can be highly visible in hamsters is their sharp [[Rodent#Dentition|incisors]]; they have an upper pair and lower pair which grow continuously throughout life, so must be regularly worn down. Hamsters are very flexible, but their bones are somewhat fragile. They are extremely susceptible to rapid temperature changes and drafts, as well as extreme heat or cold.\n\n===Senses===\nHamsters have poor eyesight; they are [[nearsighted]] and [[colorblind]].<ref>{{cite book|last=King|first=LeeAnne Engfer ; photographs by Andy|title=My pet hamster & gerbils|year=1997|publisher=Lerner|location=Minneapolis|isbn=0822522616|page=13|edition=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Concise encyclopedia biology|year=1995|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=3110106612|page=299|edition=Rev.|author=Thomas A.

They are also particularly sensitive to high-pitched noises and can hear and communicate in the [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] range.<ref name=\"Fritz\"/>\n\n===Diet===\nHamsters are [[omnivores]]. Although pet hamsters can survive on a diet of exclusively commercial hamster food, other items, such as vegetables, fruits, seeds, and nuts, can be given. Hamsters in the Middle East have been known to hunt in packs to find insects for food.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\">\"hamster.\" [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]. Standard Edition. Chicago: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2007.</ref>  Hamsters are hindgut fermenters and eat their own feces ([[coprophagy]]) to recover nutrients digested in the hindgut, but not absorbed.<ref name=\"Fox\"/>\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Backentaschen Feldhamster Cricetus cricetus cheek pouches.JPG|thumb|The dissected-out cheek pouches of a [[European hamster]]]]\nA behavioral characteristic of hamsters is [[Hoarding (animal behavior)|food hoarding]]. They carry food in their spacious cheek pouches to their underground storage chambers. When full, the cheeks can make their heads double, or even triple in size.<ref name=\"Fox\"/>\n\n===Social behavior===\n[[File:Hamster fight.jpg|thumb|right|Hamsters fighting]]\nMost hamsters are strictly solitary. If housed together, acute and chronic [[stress (psychological)|stress]] may occur,<ref name=\"Kuhnen, (2001)\"/> and they may fight fiercely, sometimes fatally. [[Phodopus|Dwarf hamster]] species may tolerate [[conspecifics]]. Russian hamsters form close, monogamous bonds with their mates, and if separated, they may become very depressed. This happens especially in males. Males will become inactive, eat more, and even show some behavioral changes similar to some types of depression in humans.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} This can even cause obesity in the hamster.\n\n===Chronobiology===\nEvidence conflicts as to whether hamsters are [[crepuscular]] or [[nocturnal]]. Khunen writes, \"Hamsters are nocturnal rodents who {{sic}} are active during the night...\",<ref name=\"Kuhnen, (2001)\"/> but others have written that because hamsters live underground during most of the day, only leaving their burrows about an hour before sundown and then returning when it gets dark, their behavior is primarily crepuscular.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  Fritzsche indicated although some species have been observed to show more nocturnal activity than others, they are all primarily crepuscular.<ref name=\"Fritz\"/>\n\nWild Syrian hamsters are true [[hibernate|hibernators]] and allow their body temperature to fall close to ambient temperature (but not below 20&nbsp;\u00b0C). This kind of [[thermoregulation]] diminishes the [[metabolic rate]] to about 5% and helps the animal to considerably reduce the need for food during the winter.<ref name=\"Kuhnen, (2001)\"/>  Hamsters may not hibernate ''per se'', but instead reduce the rate of a number of physiological systems, such as breathing and heart rate, for short periods of time. These periods of [[torpor]] (defined as \"a state of mental or physical inactivity or insensibility\"<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/torpor torpor]. Thefreedictionary.com. Retrieved on 2011-12-18.</ref>) can last up 10 days.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Burrowing behavior===\nAll hamsters are excellent diggers, constructing burrows with one or more entrances, with galleries connected to chambers for nesting, food storage, and other activities.<ref name=\"Fox\"/> They use their fore- and hindlegs, as well as their snouts and teeth, for digging. In the wild, the burrow buffers extreme ambient temperatures, offers relatively stable climatic conditions, and protects against predators. Syrian hamsters dig their burrows generally at a depth of 0.7 m.<ref name=\"Gattermann et al., (2001)\">Gattermann, R., Fritzsche, P., Neumann, K., Al-Hussein, I., Kayser, A., Abiad, M. and Yakti, R., (2001).

Journal of Zoology, 254: 359-365</ref>  A burrow includes a steep entrance pipe (4\u20135&nbsp;cm in diameter), a nesting and a hoarding chamber and a blind-ending branch for urination. Laboratory hamsters have not lost their ability to dig burrows; in fact, they will do this with great vigor and skill if they are provided with the appropriate substrate.<ref name=\"Kuhnen, (2001)\"/>\n\nWild hamsters will also appropriate tunnels made by other mammals; the Djungarian hamster, for instance, uses paths and burrows of the [[pika]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/hamster#ref756119|title=hamster {{!}} Facts & Breeds|last=Musser|first=Guy|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-02-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Reproduction==\n[[File:Hamster with babies.jpg|thumb|right|A mother Syrian hamster with pups less than one week old]]\n\n===Fertility===\nHamsters become [[fertility|fertile]] at different ages depending on their species. Both Syrian and Russian hamsters mature quickly and can begin reproducing at a young age (4\u20135 weeks), whereas Chinese hamsters will usually begin reproducing at two to three months of age, and Roborovskis at three to four months of age. The female's reproductive life lasts about 18 months, but male hamsters remain fertile much longer. Females are in [[estrus]] about every four days, which is indicated by a reddening of genital areas, a musky smell, and a hissing, squeaking vocalisation she will emit if she believes a male is nearby.<ref name=Barrie/>\n\nWhen seen from above, a [[sexually mature]] female hamster has a trim tail line; a male's tail line bulges on both sides. This might not be very visible in all species. Male hamsters typically have very large [[testes]] in relation to their body size. Before sexual maturity occurs, it is more difficult to determine a young hamster's sex. When examined, female hamsters have their anal and genital openings close together, whereas males have these two holes farther apart (the penis is usually withdrawn into the coat and thus appears as a hole or pink pimple).<ref name=Barrie/>\n\n===Gestation and fecundity===\nHamsters are [[seasonal breeder]]s and will produce several litters a year with several pups in each litter. The breeding season is from April to October in the Northern Hemisphere, with two to five litters of one to 13 young being born after a gestation period of 16 to 23 days.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\"/> Gestation lasts 16 to 18 days for Syrian hamsters, 18 to 21 days for Russian hamsters, 21 to 23 days for Chinese hamsters and 23 to 30 for Roborovski hamsters. The average litter size for Syrian hamsters is about seven pups, but can be as great as 24, which is the maximum number of pups that can be contained in the uterus. [[Campbell's dwarf hamster]]s tend to have four to eight pups in a litter, but can have up to 13. Djungarian hamsters tend to have slightly smaller litters, as do Chinese and Roborovski hamsters.\n\n===Intersexual aggression and cannibalism===\nFemale Chinese and Syrian hamsters are known for being aggressive toward the male if kept together for too long after mating. In some cases, male hamsters can die after being attacked by the female. If breeding hamsters, separation of the pair after mating is recommended, or they will attack each other.\n\nFemale hamsters are also particularly sensitive to disturbances while giving birth, and may even eat their own young if they think they are in danger, although sometimes they are just carrying the pups in their cheek pouches.<ref name=\"Fritz\"/>  If captive female hamsters are left for extended periods (three weeks or more) with their litter, they may [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalize]] the litter, so the litter must be removed by the time the young can feed and drink independently.\n\n===Weaning===\n[[File:Dwarf hamsters eating cooked, frozen beans - 03.ogv|thumb|right|250px|An adult female and several juvenile dwarf hamsters (''Phodopus sungorus'') feeding]]\nHamsters are born hairless and blind in a nest the mother will have prepared in advance.<ref name=Barrie/> After one week, they begin to explore outside the nest. They are completely weaned after three weeks, or four for Roborovski hamsters. Most breeders will sell the hamsters to shops when they are three to nine weeks old.\n\n===Longevity===\nSyrian hamsters typically live no more than two to three years in captivity, and less in the wild. Russian hamsters (Campbell's and Djungarian) live about two to four years in captivity, and Chinese hamsters {{frac|2|1|2}}\u20133 years. The smaller Roborovski hamster often lives to three years in captivity.<ref name=\"Fox\"/>\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Hamsters as pets===\n{{anchor|Gerbils as pets|reason=Old section name, may be linked.}}\nThe best-known species of hamster is the [[Golden Hamster|golden or Syrian hamster]] (''Mesocricetus auratus''), which is the type most commonly kept as [[pet]]s. It is also sometimes called a \"fancy\" hamster.

The coat of the Djungarian or winter-white Russian dwarf hamster (''Phodopus sungorus'') turns almost white during winter (when the hours of daylight decrease).<ref name=Barrie/> The [[Roborovski hamster]] (''Phodopus roborovskii'') is extremely small and fast, making it difficult to keep as a pet.<ref name=\"Fox\"/> The [[Chinese hamster]] (''Cricetulus griseus''), although not technically a true \"dwarf hamster\", is the only hamster with a [[prehensile]] tail (about 4&nbsp;cm long){{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\u2014most hamsters have very short, nonprehensile tails.\n\nMany breeders also [[Show (animal)|show]] their hamsters, so breed towards producing a good, healthy, show hamster with a view to keeping one or two themselves, so quality and temperament are of vital importance when planning the breeding.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Cashew sable syrian hamster.jpg|A sable, short-haired golden hamster\nFile:Hamster Ruso.jpg|A Russian dwarf hamster\nFile:Roborofskiohamster.jpg|A Roborovski hamster\n</gallery>\n\n===Hamster shows===\n{{main|Hamster show}}\nA hamster show is an event in which people gather hamsters to judge them against each other.<ref name=\"Logsdail 2002 page 166-9\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Logsdail|first1=Chris|last2=Logsdail|first2=Peter|last3=Hovers|first3=Kate|title=Hamsterlopaedia : a complete guide to hamster care|date=2002|publisher=Ringpress|location=Lydney|isbn=1860542468|page=161}}</ref> Hamster shows are also places where people share their enthusiasm for hamsters among attendees.

Some place it in a family [[Cricetidae]] that also includes [[vole]]s, [[lemming]]s, and [[New World rats and mice]]; others group all these into a large family called [[Muridae]]. Their evolutionary history is recorded by 15 extinct fossil genera and extends back 11.2 million to 16.4 million years to the Middle [[Miocene]] Epoch in Europe and North Africa; in Asia it extends 6 million to 11 million years. Four of the seven living genera include extinct species.

This clade contains ''C. barabensis'' (and presumably the related ''C. sokolovi'') and ''C. longicaudatus''.\n\n;Miscellaneous\nThe remaining clade contains members of ''Allocricetulus'', ''Tscherskia'', ''Cricetus'', and ''C. migratorius''. ''Allocricetulus'' and ''Cricetus'' were [[sister taxa]]. ''Cricetulus migratorius'' was their next closest relative, and ''Tscherskia'' was basal.\n\n==Similar animals==\nSome similar rodents sometimes called \"hamsters\" are not currently classified in the hamster subfamily Cricetinae. These include the maned hamster, or crested hamster, which is really the [[maned rat]] (''Lophiomys imhausi'').

After the [[Finnish War]] in 1809, the vast majority of the Finnish-speaking areas of Sweden were ceded to the [[Russian Empire]] (excluding the areas of modern-day Northern Sweden where [[Me\u00e4nkieli dialects]] of Finnish are spoken), making this area the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. The Lutheran religion dominated. Finnish [[nationalism]] emerged in the 19th century. It focused on Finnish cultural traditions, folklore and [[Finnish mythology|mythology]], including music and\u2014especially\u2014the highly distinctive language and lyrics associated with it. One product of this era was the [[Kalevala]], one of the most significant works of [[Finnish literature]]. The catastrophic [[Finnish famine of 1866\u20131868]] was followed by eased economic regulations and extensive emigration.\n\nIn 1917, Finland declared independence. A [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]] between the Finnish [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] and the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guard]] ensued a few months later, with the \"Whites\" gaining the upper hand during the springtime of 1918. After the internal affairs stabilized, the still mainly agrarian economy grew relatively quickly. Relations with the West, especially Sweden and Britain, were strong but tensions remained with the Soviet Union. During the Second World War, Finland fought twice against the Soviet Union and defended its independence in the [[Winter War]] and in the [[Continuation War]]. In the peace settlement Finland ended up ceding a large part of [[Karelia]] and some other areas to the [[Soviet Union]]. However, Finland remained an independent democracy in Northern Europe.\n\nIn the latter half of its independent history, Finland has maintained a [[mixed economy]]. Since its post-World War II economic boom in the 1970s, Finland's GDP per capita has been among the world's highest.  The expanded [[welfare state]] of Finland from 1970 and 1990 increased the public sector employees and spending and the tax burden imposed on the citizens. In 1992, Finland simultaneously faced economic overheating and depressed Western, Russian, and local markets. Finland joined the [[European Union]] in 1995, and replaced the [[Finnish markka]] with the [[euro]] in 2002. According to a 2016 poll, 61% of Finns preferred not to join NATO.<ref>[https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/poll_finnish_support_for_nato_membership_still_low/9329652]</ref>\n\n<div style=\"float:right; margin-left: 1em;\"><timeline>\nImageSize  = width:260 height:350\nPlotArea   = width: 25 height:330 left:50 bottom:10\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod     = from:700 till:2012\nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:100 start:1100\n\nPlotData=\n  color:blue width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:S shift:(25,0)\n  # shift texts up or down manually to avoid overlap\n  from:start till:1250 shift:(,0)  text:Prehistoric Finland\n  from:1250  till:1809 shift:(,0)  text:Swedish rule c.1250\u20131809\n  from:1809  till:1917 shift:(,-5) text:Grand Duchy of Finland 1809\u20131917\n  from:1917  till:1995 shift:(,-5) text:Republic of Finland 1917\u2013\n  from:1995  till:2012 shift:(,-5) text:European Union member state 1995\u2013\n</timeline>\n</div>\n\n== Stone Age ==\n[[File:Baltic History 7500-BC.svg|thumb|[[Ancylus Lake]] covered major part of Finland (7,500\u20136,000 BC)]]\n[[File:Kiuruveden reik\u00e4kirves - Stone axe of Kiuruvesi.jpg|thumb|[[Stone Age]] stone axe engraved with human face found from [[Kiuruvesi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.finna.fi/Record/musketti.M012:AKD32380:1#image|title=KM 11708 Kiuruveden kirves; Esinekuva|website=www.finna.fi|language=fi|access-date=2017-12-31}}</ref>]]\n\n===Paleolithic===\n\nIf confirmed, the oldest archeological site in Finland would be the [[Wolf Cave]] in [[Kristinestad]], in [[Ostrobothnia County|Ostrobothnia]].

The earliest samples belong to the [[Pit\u2013Comb Ware culture|Comb Ceramic Cultures]], known for their distinctive decorating patterns. This marks the beginning of the [[neolithic]] period for Finland, although subsistence was still based on hunting and fishing. Extensive networks of exchange existed across Finland and northeastern Europe during the 5th millennium BC. For example, flint from [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Valdai Hills]], [[amber]] from Scandinavia and the [[Baltic region]], and [[slate]] from Scandinavia and [[Lake Onega]] found their way into Finnish archaeological sites, while [[asbestos]] and [[soap stone]] from Finland (e.g. the area of [[Saimaa]]) were found in other regions. Rock paintings \u2014 apparently related to [[shamanism|shamanistic]] and [[totemism|totemistic]] belief systems \u2014 have been found, especially in Eastern Finland, e.g. [[Astuvansalmi rock paintings|Astuvansalmi]].\n\n[[File:Kastelli giant's church 1.JPG|thumb|[[Kastelli Giant's Church]] in [[Pattijoki]] by [[P\u00f6lj\u00e4 Culture]]]]\nBetween 3500 and 2000 BC, monumental stone enclosures colloquially known as [[Giant's Church]]es ({{lang-fi|J\u00e4tinkirkko}}) were constructed in the [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]] region.<ref name=\"poll\">{{Cite book|last1=Pollard|first1=Tony|last2=Banks|first2=Iain|title=War and Sacrifice: Studies in the Archaeology of Conflict |year=2006|page=189|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9047418921}}</ref> The purpose of the enclosures is unknown.<ref name=\"poll\"/>\n\nIn recent years, a dig in [[Kierikki]] site north of [[Oulu]] on [[Iijoki|River Ii]] has changed the image of Finnish neolithic stone age culture.

This culture was a part of the European [[Battle Axe culture]]s, which have often been associated with the movement of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] speakers. The Battle Axe, or Cord Ceramic, culture seems to have practiced [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]] outside of Finland, but the earliest confirmed traces of agriculture in Finland date later, approximately to the 2nd millennium BC. Further inland, the societies retained their hunting-gathering lifestyles for the time being.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nThe Battle Axe and Comb Ceramic cultures eventually merged, giving rise to the [[Kiukainen culture]] that existed between 2300 BC, and 1500 BC, and was fundamentally a comb ceramic tradition with cord ceramic characteristics.\n\n==Bronze Age==\n\nThe Bronze Age began some time after 1500 BC. The coastal regions of Finland were a part of the Nordic Bronze Culture, whereas in the inland regions the influences came from the bronze-using cultures of northern and eastern Russia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Iron Age==\n\nThe [[Iron Age]] in Finland is considered to last from c. 500 BC until c. 1300 AD<ref name=\"nba.fi\">http://www.nba.fi/fi/kansallismuseo/opetus/opetuspaketit/esihistoria/tietoa/tulostettava3</ref> when known official and written records of Finland become more common due to the Swedish invasions as part of the [[Northern Crusades]] in the 13th century. As the Finnish Iron Age lasted almost two millennia, it is further divided into six sub-periods:<ref name=\"nba.fi\"/>\n*Pre-Roman period: 500 BC \u2013 1 BC\n*Roman period: 1 AD \u2013 400 AD\n*Migration period: 400 AD \u2013 575 AD\n*Merovingian period: 575 AD \u2013 800 AD\n*Viking age period: 800 AD \u2013 1025 AD\n*Crusade period: 1033 AD \u2013 1300 AD\n\nVery few written records of Finland or its people remain in any language of the era. Primary written sources are thus mostly of foreign origin, most informative of which include [[Tacitus]]' description of ''Fenni'' in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', the [[sagas]] written down by [[Snorri Sturluson]], as well as the 12th- and 13th-century [[ecclesiastical letters]] written for Finns. Numerous other sources from the Roman period onwards contain brief mentions of ancient Finnish kings and place names, as such defining Finland as a kingdom and noting the culture of its people.\n\nCurrently the oldest known Scandinavian documents mentioning a \"land of the Finns\" are two [[runestone]]s: [[S\u00f6derby]], Sweden, with the inscription ''finlont'' ([[Runestone U 582|U 582]]), and [[Gotland]] with the inscription ''finlandi'' ([[Runestone G 319|G 319]]) dating from the 11th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.narc.fi/Arkistolaitos/eng/ |title=National Archives Service, Finland (in English) |accessdate=2007-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227140130/http://www.narc.fi/Arkistolaitos/eng/ |archivedate=2007-02-27 |df= }}</ref> However, as the long continuum of the Finnish Iron Age into the historical Medieval period of Europe suggests, the primary source of information of the era in Finland is based on archaeological findings<ref name=\"nba.fi\"/> and modern applications of natural scientific methods like those of DNA analysis<ref>http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1003296</ref> or [[computer linguistics]].\n\nProduction of iron during the Finnish Iron Age was adopted from the neighboring cultures in the east, west and south about the same time as the first imported iron artifacts appear.<ref name=\"nba.fi\"/> This happened almost simultaneously in various parts of the country.\n\n===Pre-Roman period: 500 BC \u2013 1 BC===\n\nThe [[Pre-Roman period]] of the Finnish Iron Age is scarcest in findings, but the known ones suggest that cultural connections to other Baltic cultures were already established.<ref name=\"nba.fi\"/> for which the findings of [[Pernaja]] and [[Savukoski]] provide solid argument. Many of the era's dwelling sites are the same as those of the [[Neolithic]]. Most of the iron of the era was produced on site.<ref name=\"nba.fi\"/>\n\n===Roman period: 1 AD \u2013 400 AD===\n\nThe [[Roman period]] brought along an influx of imported iron (and other) artifacts like Roman wine glasses and dippers as well as various coins of the Empire. During this period the (proto) Finnish culture stabilized on the coastal regions and larger graveyards become commonplace. The prosperity of the Finns rose to the level that the vast majority of gold treasures found within Finland date back to this period.<ref name=\"nba.fi\"/>\n\n===Migration period: 400 AD \u2013 575 AD===\n\nThe [[Migration period]] saw the expansion of land cultivation inland, especially in [[Southern Bothnia]], and the growing influence of Germanic cultures, both in artifacts like swords and other weapons and in burial customs. However most iron as well as its forging was of domestic origin, probably from [[bog iron]].<ref name=\"nba.fi\"/>\n\n===Merovingian period: 575 AD \u2013 800 AD===\n\nThe [[Merovingian period]] in Finland gave rise to distinctive fine crafts culture of its own, visible in the original decorations of domestically produced weapons and jewelry. Finest luxury weapons were, however, imported from Western Europe. The very first Christian burials are from the latter part of this era as well. In the Lev\u00e4luhta burial findings the average height of a man was originally thought to be just 158&nbsp;cm and that of a woman 147&nbsp;cm.<ref name=\"nba.fi\"/> but the recent research has corrected these numbers upwards and has confirmed that the people buried in Lev\u00e4luhta were of average height for the era in Europe.\n\nRecent findings suggest that Finnish trade connections already became more active during the 8th century bringing an influx of silver onto Finnish markets.<ref name=\"nba.fi\"/> The opening of the eastern route to [[Constantinople]] via Finland's southern coastline [[archipelago]] brought Arabic and [[Byzantine]] artifacts into the [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] findings of the era.\n\nThe earliest findings of imported iron blades and local iron working appear in 500 BC. From about 50 AD, there are indications of a more intense long-distance exchange of goods in coastal Finland. Inhabitants exchanged their products, presumably mostly furs, for weapons and ornaments with the Balts and the Scandinavians as well as with the peoples along the traditional eastern trade routes. The existence of richly furnished burials, usually with weapons, suggests that there was a chiefly elite in the southern and western parts of the country. [[Hillfort]]s spread over most of southern Finland at the end of the Iron and early Medieval Age. There is no commonly accepted evidence of early state formations in Finland, and the presumably Iron Age origins of urbanization are contested.\n\n===Chronology of languages in Finland===\nThe question of the timelines for the evolution and the spreading of the current Finnish languages is controversial, and new theories challenging older ones have been introduced continuously.\n\nIt is widely believed<ref>Article by professor of History of Religions Juha Pentik\u00e4inen at Virtual Finland {{cite web |url=http://virtual.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=25814 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125223617/http://virtual.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=25814 |archivedate=2009-01-25 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Rein Taagepera|title=The Finno-Ugric Republics and the Russian State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QGqWcZu42hUC&pg=PA32|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-91977-7|page=32}}</ref><ref>The common acceptance of the theory is indicated by the fact that this is the theory currently presented by the National Board of Antiquities in Finland, and several schools: E.g.

However, some scholars claim that the archipelago was deserted during the 11th century.\nAccording to the archaeological finds, [[Christianity]] gained a foothold in Finland during the 11th century. According to the very few written documents that have survived, the church in Finland was still in its early development in the 12th century. Later medieval legends from late 13th century describe Swedish attempts to [[First Swedish Crusade|conquer and Christianize Finland]] sometime in the mid-1150s.\n\nIn the early 13th century, [[Thomas (bishop of Finland)|Bishop Thomas]] became the first known [[bishop of Finland]]. There were several secular powers who aimed to bring the Finnish tribes under their rule. These were Sweden, Denmark, the [[Republic of Novgorod]] in northwestern Russia, and probably the German crusading orders as well. Finns had their own chiefs, but most probably no central authority. At the time there can be seen three cultural areas or tribes in Finland: [[Finns proper|Finns]], [[Tavastians]] and [[Karelia (historical province of Finland)|Karelians]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Muinaisuutemme j\u00e4ljet|last=|first=|publisher=Gaudeamus|year=2015|isbn=|location=Helsinki|pages=339}}</ref> Russian chronicles indicate there were several [[Finnish-Novgorodian Wars|conflicts between Novgorod and the Finnic tribes]] from the 11th or 12th century to the early 13th century.\n\nIt was the Swedish regent, [[Birger Jarl]], who allegedly established Swedish rule in Finland through the [[Second Swedish Crusade]], most often dated to 1249. The [[Eric Chronicles|Eric Chronicle]], the only source narrating the \"crusade\", describes that it was aimed at [[Tavastians]]. Due to papal letter from 1237 Tavastians are known to stopped being Christian and returned to their old ethnic faith earlier. Novgorod gained control in [[Karelia]] in 1278, the region inhabited by speakers of Eastern Finnish dialects. <!-- It has been argued that the Finnic peoples that came under Swedish rule were equally much different as they were compared to them who came under Novgorod's influence. -->Sweden however gained the control of Western Karelia with the [[Third Swedish Crusade]] in 1293. Western Karelians were from then on viewed as part of the western cultural sphere, while eastern Karelians turned culturally to Russia and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]]. While eastern Karelians remain linguistically and ethnically closely related to the Finns, they are considered a people of their own by most.<ref>''Cultures of the World: Finland'' {{ISBN|978-0-761-42073-6}} pp. 60-62</ref> Thus, the northern border between Catholic and Orthodox Christendom came to lie at the eastern border of what would become Finland with the [[Treaty of N\u00f6teborg]] in 1323.\n\nDuring the 13th century, Finland was integrated into medieval European civilization. The [[Dominican order]] arrived in Finland around 1249 and came to exercise huge influence there. In the early 14th century, the first documents of Finnish students at [[Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbonne|Sorbonne]] appear. In the southwestern part of the country, an urban settlement evolved in [[Turku]]. Turku was one of the biggest towns in the Kingdom of Sweden, and its population included German merchants and craftsmen. Otherwise the degree of urbanization was very low in medieval Finland. Southern Finland and the long coastal zone of the [[Gulf of Bothnia|Bothnian Gulf]] had a sparse farming settlements, organized as parishes and castellanies. In the other parts of the country a small population of [[Sami people|Sami]] hunters, fishermen and small-scale farmers lived. These were exploited by the Finnish and Karelian tax collectors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} During the 12th and 13th centuries, great numbers of Swedish settlers moved to the southern and northwestern coasts of Finland, to the \u00c5land Islands, and to the archipelago between Turku and the \u00c5land Islands. In these regions, the Swedish language is widely spoken even today. Swedish came to be the language of the upper class in many other parts of Finland as well.\n\nThe name \"Finland\" originally signified only the southwestern province that has been known as \"[[Finland Proper (historical province)|Finland Proper]]\" since the 18th century. First known mention of Finland is in [[Gs 13|runestone Gs 13]] from 11th century. The original Swedish name for the realm's eastern part was \u00d6sterlands in plural, meaning the area of Finland proper, Tavastia and Karelia, but it was later transferred into singular form [[\u00d6sterland]] (lit. Eastern Land) which was in use between 1350\u20131470.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ruotsin it\u00e4maa|last=Tarkiainen|first=Kari|publisher=Svenska litteraturs\u00e4llskapet i Finland|year=2010|isbn=|location=Helsinki|pages=155\u2013156}}</ref> In the 15th century Finland began to be used synonymously with \u00d6sterland. The concept of a Finnish \"country\" in the modern sense developed slowly from the 15th to 18th centuries.\n\n[[File:Perni\u00f6 costume reconstruction, from 12th century grave - National Museum of Finland - DSC04198.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A reconstruction of a 12th-century [[Perni\u00f6]] costume]]\nDuring the 13th century, the bishopric of Turku was established. The [[Turku Cathedral|cathedral of Turku]] was the center of the cult of [[Henry, Bishop of Uppsala|Saint Henry]], and naturally the cultural center of the bishopric. The bishop had the ecclesiastical authority over much of today's Finland and was usually the most powerful man there. Bishops were often Finns, whereas the commanders in the castles were more often Scandinavian or German noblemen. In 1362, representatives from Finland were called to participate in the elections for the king of Sweden. As such, that year is often considered when Finland was incorporated into the Kingdom of Sweden. As in the Scandinavian part of the kingdom, the gentry or (lower) nobility consisted of magnates and yeomen who could afford armament for a man and a horse; these were concentrated in the southern part of Finland.\n\nThe strong fortress of [[Vyborg|Viborg]] (Finnish: ''Viipuri'', Russian: ''Vyborg'') guarded the eastern border of Finland. Sweden and Novgorod signed the [[Treaty of N\u00f6teborg]] (''P\u00e4hkin\u00e4saari'' in Finnish) in 1323, but that would not last long. In 1348 the Swedish king [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus Eriksson]] staged a failed crusade against the Orthodox \"[[Christian heresy|heretics]]\", managing only to alienate his supporters and ultimately lose his crown. The bones of contention between Sweden and Novgorod were the northern coastline of the Bothnian Gulf and the wilderness regions of [[Savonia (historical province)|Savo]] in Eastern Finland. [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] considered these as hunting and fishing grounds of its Karelian subjects, and protested against the slow infiltration of Catholic settlers from the West. [[Swedish-Novgorodian Wars|Occasional raids and clashes between Swedes and Novgorodians]] occurred during the late 14th and 15th centuries, but for most of the time an uneasy peace prevailed.\n\nDuring the 1380s, a civil war in the Scandinavian part of Sweden brought unrest to Finland as well. The victor of this struggle was Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark]], who brought the three Scandinavian kingdoms of Sweden, Denmark and Norway under her rule (the \"[[Kalmar Union]]\") in 1389. The next 130 years or so were characterized by attempts of different Swedish factions to break out of the Union. Finland was sometimes involved in these struggles, but in general the 15th century seems to have been a relatively prosperous time{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, characterized by population growth and economic development. Towards the end of the 15th century, however, the situation on the eastern border became more tense. The [[Principality of Moscow]] conquered Novgorod, preparing the way for a unified Russia, and from 1495\u20131497 [[Russo-Swedish War, 1496-1499|a war was fought between Sweden and Russia]]. The fortress-town of [[Vyborg|Viborg]] stood against a Russian siege; according to a contemporary legend, it was saved by a miracle.\n\n===16th century===\n[[File:Swedish Empire (1560-1815) en2.png|thumb|The [[Swedish empire]] at its largest. Most of present-day Finland was an integral part of the [[Sweden proper|Swedish homeland]], ''rike'', shown in dark green.]]\n\nIn 1521 the Kalmar Union collapsed and [[Gustav Vasa]] became the King of Sweden. During his rule, the [[Reformation in Sweden|Swedish church was reformed]]. The state administration underwent extensive reforms and development too, giving it a much stronger grip on the life of local communities\u2014and ability to collect higher taxes. Following the policies of the Reformation, in 1551 [[Mikael Agricola]], bishop of Turku, published his translation of the [[New Testament]] into the [[Finnish language]].\n\nIn 1550 [[Helsinki]] was founded by [[Gustav Vasa]] under the name of Helsingfors, but remained little more than a fishing village for more than two centuries.\n\nKing Gustav Vasa died in 1560 and his crown was passed to his three sons in separate turns. King [[Erik XIV]] started an era of expansion when the Swedish crown took the city of [[Tallinn]] in [[Estonia]] under its protection in 1561. This action contributed to the early stages of the [[Livonian War]] which was a warlike era which lasted for 160 years. In the first phase, Sweden fought for the lordship of Estonia and [[Latvia]] against Denmark, Poland and Russia. The common people of Finland suffered because of drafts, high taxes, and abuse by military personnel. This resulted in the [[Cudgel War]] of 1596\u20131597, a desperate peasant rebellion, which was suppressed brutally and bloodily. A peace treaty (the [[Treaty of Teusina]]) with Russia in 1595 moved the border of Finland further to the east and north, very roughly where the modern border lies.\n\nAn important part of the 16th-century history of Finland was growth of the area settled by the farming population. The crown encouraged farmers from the province of [[Savonia (historical province)|Savonia]] to settle the vast wilderness regions in Middle Finland. This was done, and the original [[Sami people|Sami]] population often had to leave. Some of the wilderness settled was traditional hunting and fishing territory of [[Karelia]]n hunters. During the 1580s, this resulted in a bloody guerrilla warfare between the Finnish settlers and Karelians in some regions, especially in [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]].\n\n===17th century===\n[[Image:Grand duchy of finland 1662.jpg|thumb|Map of Finland from 1662]]\nIn 1611\u20131632 Sweden was ruled by King [[Gustavus Adolphus]], whose military reforms transformed the Swedish army from a peasant militia into an efficient fighting machine, possibly the best in Europe. The conquest of [[Livonia]] was now completed, and some territories were taken from internally divided Russia in the [[Treaty of Stolbova]]. In 1630, the Swedish (and Finnish) armies marched into Central Europe, as Sweden had decided to take part in the great struggle between Protestant and Catholic forces in Germany, known as the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The Finnish light cavalry was known as the [[Hakkapeliitta|Hakkapeliitat]].\n\nAfter the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, the [[Swedish Empire]] was one of the most powerful countries in Europe. During the war, several important reforms had been made in Finland:\n* 1637\u20131640 and 1648\u20131654 Count [[Per Brahe the Younger|Per Brahe]] functioned as general governor of Finland. Many important reforms were made and many towns were founded. His period of administration is generally considered very beneficial to the development of Finland.\n* 1640 Finland's first university, the [[Academy of \u00c5bo]], was founded in Turku at the proposal of Count Per Brahe by [[Queen Christina of Sweden]].\n* 1642 The whole [[Bible]] was published in Finnish.\nHowever, the high taxation, continuing wars and the cold climate (the [[Little Ice Age]]) made the Imperial era of Sweden rather gloomy times for Finnish peasants. In 1655\u20131660, the [[Northern Wars]] were fought, taking Finnish soldiers to the battle-fields of [[Livonia]], Poland and Denmark. In 1676, the political system of Sweden was transformed into an [[Charles XI of Sweden|absolute monarchy]].\n\nIn Middle and Eastern Finland, great amounts of [[tar]] were produced for export. European nations needed this material for the maintenance of their fleets. According to some theories, the spirit of early [[capitalism]] in the tar-producing province of [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]] may have been the reason for the [[witch-hunt]] wave that happened in this region during the late 17th century. The people were developing more expectations and plans for the future, and when these were not realized, they were quick to blame witches\u2014according to a belief system the [[Lutheran]] church had imported from Germany.\n\nThe Empire had a [[New Sweden|colony]] in the New World in the modern-day Delaware-Pennsylvania area between 1638\u20131655. At least half of the immigrants were of Finnish origin.\n\nThe 17th century was an era of very strict [[Lutheran]] orthodoxy. In 1608, the law of Moses was declared the law of the land, in addition to secular legislation. Every subject of the realm was required to confess the Lutheran faith and church attendance was mandatory.

Harsh conditions\u2014worsening poverty and repeated crop failures\u2014among peasants undermined support for the war, leading to Sweden's defeat.  Finland was a battleground as both armies ravaged the countryside, leading to famine, epidemics, social disruption and the loss of nearly half the population. By 1721 only 250,000 remained.<ref>Antti Kujala, \"The Breakdown of a Society: Finland in the Great Northern War 1700\u20131714,\" ''Scandinavian Journal of History,'' Mar\u2013June 2000, Vol. 25 Issue 1/2, pp. 69\u201386</ref>  Landowners had to pay higher wages to keep their peasants. Russia was the winner, annexing the [[Old Finland|south-eastern part]], including the town of [[Vyborg|Viborg]], after the [[Treaty of Nystad]]. The border with Russia came to lie roughly where it returned to after World War II. Sweden's status as a European great power was forfeit, and Russia was now the leading power in the North. The absolute monarchy was ended in Sweden. During this [[Age of Liberty]], the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Parliament]] ruled the country, and the two parties of the [[Hats (party)|Hats]] and [[Caps (party)|Caps]] struggled for control leaving the lesser Court party, i.e. parliamentarians with close connections to the royal court, with little to no influence. The Caps wanted to have a peaceful relationship with Russia and were supported by many Finns, while other Finns longed for revenge and supported the Hats.\n\nFinland by this time was depopulated, with a population in 1749 of 427,000. However, with peace the population grew rapidly, and doubled before 1800. 90% of the population were typically classified as \"[[peasant]]s\", most being free taxed yeomen. Society was divided into four Estates: peasants (free taxed yeomen), the clergy, nobility and burghers. A minority, mostly [[cottage]]rs, were estateless, and had no political representation. Forty-five percent of the male population were enfranchised with full political representation in the legislature\u2014although clerics, nobles and townsfolk had their own chambers in the parliament, boosting their political influence and excluding the peasantry on matters of foreign policy.\n\nThe mid-18th century was a relatively good time, partly because life was now more peaceful. However, during the [[Russo-Swedish War (1741\u201343)|Lesser Wrath]] (1741\u20131742), Finland was again occupied by the Russians after the government, during a period of Hat party dominance, had made a [[Hats' Russian War|botched attempt to reconquer]] the lost provinces. Instead the result of the [[Treaty of \u00c5bo]] was that the Russian border was moved further to the west. During this time, Russian propaganda hinted at the possibility of [[Kingdom of Finland (1742)|creating a separate Finnish kingdom]].\n\nBoth the ascending Russian Empire and pre-revolutionary France aspired to have Sweden as a client state. Parliamentarians and others with influence were susceptible to taking bribes which they did their best to increase. The integrity and the credibility of the political system waned, and in 1771 the young and charismatic king [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] staged a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], abolished [[parliamentarism]] and reinstated royal power in Sweden\u2014more or less with the support of the parliament. In 1788, he started a new war against Russia. Despite a couple of [[Battle of Svensksund|victorious battles]], the war was fruitless, managing only to bring disturbance to the economic life of Finland. The popularity of King Gustav III waned considerably. During the war, a group of officers made the famous [[Anjala conspiracy|Anjala declaration]] demanding peace negotiations and calling of ''Riksdag'' (Parliament). An interesting sideline to this process was the conspiracy of some Finnish officers, who attempted to create an independent Finnish state with Russian support. After an initial shock, Gustav III crushed this opposition. In 1789, the new constitution of Sweden strengthened the royal power further, as well as improving the status of the peasantry. However, the continuing war had to be finished without conquests\u2014and many Swedes now considered the king as a tyrant.\n\nWith the interruption of the [[Russo-Swedish War (1788\u20131790)|Gustav III's war]] (1788\u20131790), the last decades of the 18th century had been an era of development in Finland. New things were changing even everyday life, such as starting of potato farming after the 1750s. New scientific and technical inventions were seen. The first hot air balloon in Finland (and in the whole Swedish kingdom) was made in Oulu (Ule\u00e5borg) in 1784, only a year after it was invented in France. Trade increased and the peasantry was growing more affluent and self-conscious. The [[Age of Enlightenment]]'s climate of broadened debate in the society on issues of politics, religion and morals would in due time highlight the problem that the overwhelming majority of Finns spoke only [[Finnish language|Finnish]], but the cascade of newspapers, belles-lettres and political leaflets was almost exclusively in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]\u2014when not in [[French language|French]].\n\nThe two Russian occupations had been harsh and were not easily forgotten. These occupations were a seed of a feeling of separateness and otherness, that in a narrow circle of scholars and intellectuals at the university in [[Turku]] was forming a sense of a separate Finnish identity representing the eastern part of the realm. The shining influence of the Russian imperial capital [[Saint Petersburg]] was also much stronger in southern Finland than in other parts of Sweden, and contacts across the new border dispersed the worst fears for the fate of the educated and trading classes under a Russian r\u00e9gime. At the turn of the 19th century, the Swedish-speaking educated classes of officers, clerics and civil servants were mentally well prepared for a shift of allegiance to the strong [[Russian Empire]].\n\nKing Gustav III was assassinated in 1792, and his son [[Gustav IV Adolf]] assumed the crown after a period of [[Absolute Monarchy in Sweden#Reuterholm|regency]]. The new king was not a particularly talented ruler; at least not talented enough to steer his kingdom through the dangerous era of the [[French Revolution]] and [[Napoleonic wars]].\n\nMeanwhile, the Finnish areas belonging to Russia after the peace treaties in 1721 and 1743 (not including Ingria), called \"Old Finland\" were initially governed with the old Swedish laws (a not uncommon practice in the expanding Russian Empire in the 18th century). However, gradually the rulers of Russia granted large estates of land to their non-Finnish favorites, ignoring the traditional landownership and peasant freedom laws of Old Finland. There were even cases where the noblemen punished peasants corporally, for example by flogging.  The overall situation caused decline in the economy and morale in Old Finland, worsened since 1797 when the area was forced to send men to the Imperial Army. The construction of military installations in the area brought thousands of non-Finnish people to the region. In 1812, after the Russian conquest of Finland, \"Old Finland\" was rejoined to the rest of the country but the landownership question remained a serious problem until the 1870s.\n\n===Peasants===\n[[File:Raatajat rahanalaiset.JPG|thumb|280px|Eero J\u00e4rnefelt, ''Burning the Brushwood'', 1893]]\nWhile the king of Sweden sent in his governor to rule Finland, in day to day reality the villagers ran their own affairs using traditional local assemblies (called the ting) which selected a local \"lagman\", or lawman, to enforce the norms.  The Swedes used the parish system to collect taxes. The socken (local parish) was at once a community religious organization and a judicial district that administered the king's law. The ting participated in the taxation process; taxes were collected by the bailiff, a royal appointee.<ref>William K. Carr et al., ''Area Handbook for Finland'' (U.S. State Department, 1974) p. 10.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to serfdom in Germany and Russia, the Finnish peasant was typically a freeholder who owned and controlled his small plot of land. There was no serfdom in which peasants were permanently attached to specific lands, and were ruled by the owners of that land. In Finland (and Sweden) the peasants formed one of the four estates and were represented in the parliament. Outside the political sphere, however, the peasants were considered at the bottom of the social order\u2014just above vagabonds.  The upper classes looked down on them as excessively prone to drunkenness and laziness, as clannish and untrustworthy, and especially as lacking honor and a sense of national spirit. This disdain  dramatically changed in the 19th century when everyone idealised the peasant as the true carrier of Finnishness and the national ethos, as opposed to the Swedish-speaking elites.\n\nThe peasants were not passive; they were proud of their traditions and would band together and fight to uphold their traditional rights in the face of burdensome taxes from the king or new demands by the landowning nobility.  The great [[Cudgel War]] in the south in 1596\u20131597 attacked the nobles and their new system of state feudalism; this bloody revolt was similar to other contemporary peasant wars in Europe.<ref>Kimmo Katajala, \"Ok\u00e4nd bonde\" ['The unknown peasant. The manifold faces of the peasantry from the Middle Ages to modern times'] ''Historisk Tidskrift,'' 2006, Issue 4, pp. 791\u2013801</ref>  In the north, there was less tension between nobles and peasants and more equality among peasants, due to the practice of subdividing farms among heirs, to non farm economic activities, and to the small numbers of nobility and gentry. Often the nobles and landowners were paternalistic and helpful.  The Crown usually sided with the nobles, but after the \"restitution\" of the 1680s it ended the practice of the nobility extracting labor from the peasants and instead began a new tax system whereby royal bureaucrats collected taxes directly from the peasants, who disliked the efficient new system.

The [[Riksdag of the Estates|four Estates]] of occupied Finland were assembled at the [[Diet of Finland|Diet of Porvoo]] on March 29, 1809 to pledge allegiance to [[Alexander I of Russia]]. Following the Swedish defeat in the war and the signing of the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] on September 17, 1809, Finland remained a [[Grand Duchy]] in the [[Russian Empire]] until the end of 1917, with the czar as Grand Duke. Russia assigned [[Old Finland|Karelia]] (\"Old Finland\") to the Grand Duchy in 1812. During the years of Russian rule the degree of autonomy varied. Periods of censorship and political prosecution occurred, particularly in the two last decades of Russian control, but the Finnish peasantry remained free (unlike the Russian serfs) as the old Swedish law remained effective (including the relevant parts from [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]]'s [[Constitution of 1772 (Finland)|Constitution of 1772]]). The old [[Riksdag of the Estates|four-chamber Diet]] was re-activated in the 1860s agreeing to supplementary new legislation concerning internal affairs. In addition, Finns remained free of obligations connected to the empire, such as the duty to serve in tsarist armies, and they enjoyed certain rights that citizens from other parts of the empire did not have.<ref name=\"LOC\">Text from [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:PD-USGov PD] source: US Library of Congress: ''[https://cdn.loc.gov/master/frd/frdcstdy/fi/finlandcountryst00sols/finlandcountryst00sols.pdf A Country Study: Finland]'', Library of Congress Call Number DL1012 .A74 1990. {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n===Economy===\nBefore 1860 overseas merchant firms and the owners of landed estates had accumulated wealth that became available for industrial investments. After 1860 the government liberalized economic laws and began to build a suitable physical infrastructure of ports, railroads and telegraph lines. The domestic market was small but rapid growth took place after 1860 in export industries drawing on forest resources and mobile rural laborers.  Industrialization began during the mid-19th century from forestry to industry, mining and machinery and laid the foundation of Finland's current day prosperity, even though agriculture employed a relatively large part of the population until the post\u2013World War II era.\n\nThe beginnings of industrialism took place in Helsinki. Alfred Kihlman (1825\u20131904) began as a Lutheran priest and director of the elite Helsingfors boys' school, the Swedish Normal Lyceum. He became a financier and member of the diet. There was little precedent in Finland in the 1850s for raising venture capital. Kihlman was well connected and enlisted businessmen and capitalists to invest in new enterprises. In 1869, he organized a limited partnership that supported two years of developmental activities that led to the founding of the [[Nokia]] company in 1871.<ref>Martti H\u00e4iki\u00f6, ''Nokia: the inside story'' (2002) p. 35</ref>\n\nAfter 1890 industrial productivity stagnated because entrepreneurs were unable to keep up with technological innovations made by competitors in Germany, Britain and the United States. However, Russification opened up a large Russian market especially for machinery.\n\n===Nationalism===\n{{see also|Finland's language strife||Finnish nationalism}}\nThe Finnish national awakening in the mid-19th century was the result of members of the Swedish-speaking upper classes deliberately choosing to promote Finnish culture and language as a means of [[nation building]], i.e. to establish a feeling of unity among all people in Finland including (and not of least importance) between the ruling elite and the ruled peasantry. The publication in 1835 of the Finnish [[national epic]], the [[Kalevala]], a collection of traditional myths and legends which is the [[folklore]] of the [[Karelian people]] (the [[Finnic peoples|Finnic]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] people who inhabit the [[Lake Ladoga]]-region of eastern Finland and present-day NW Russia), stirred the [[nationalism]] that later led to Finland's independence from Russia.\n\nParticularly following Finland's incorporation into the Swedish central administration during the 16th and 17th centuries, [[Finland Swedish|Swedish]] was spoken by about 15% of the population, especially the upper and middle classes. Swedish was the language of administration, public institutions, education and cultural life. Only the peasants spoke Finnish. The emergence of [[Finnish language|Finnish]] to predominance resulted from a 19th-century surge of Finnish nationalism, aided by Russian bureaucrats attempting to separate Finns from Sweden and to ensure the Finns' loyalty.<ref>Michael C. Coleman, \"'You Might All Be Speaking Swedish Today': language change in 19th-century Finland and Ireland,\" ''Scandinavian Journal of History,'' March 2010, Vol. 35 Issue 1, pp. 44\u201364,</ref>\n\nIn 1863, the Finnish language gained an official position in administration. In 1892 Finnish finally became an equal official language and gained a status comparable to that of Swedish. Nevertheless, the Swedish language continued to be the language of culture, arts and business all the way to the 1920s.\n\nMovements toward Finnish national pride, as well as liberalism in politics and economics involved ethnic and class dimensions. The nationalist movement against Russia began with the [[Fennoman movement]] led by Hegelian philosopher [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman]] in the 1830s. Snellman sought to apply philosophy to social action and moved the basis of Finnish nationalism to establishment of the language in the schools, while remaining loyal to the czar. Fennomania became the Finnish Party in the 1860s.<ref>Jason Lavery, ''The history of Finland'' (2006) pp. 58\u201360</ref> \n[[Image:Paavo Ruotsalainen.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Paavo Ruotsalainen, a layman, led pietistic revivals.]]\n\nLiberalism was the central issue of the 1860s to 1880s. The language issue overlapped both liberalism and nationalism, and showed some a class conflict as well, with the peasants pitted against the conservative Swedish-speaking landowners and nobles. As complications, the Finnish activists divided into \"old\" (no compromise on the language question and conservative nationalism) and \"young\" (liberation from Russia) Finns. The leading liberals were Swedish-speaking intellectuals who called for more democracy; they became the radical leaders after 1880.  The liberals organized for social democracy, labor unions, farmer cooperatives, and women's rights.<ref>Mikko Juva, \"Nationalism, Liberalism Och Demokrati Under Spr\u00e5kstridens F\u00f6rsta Skede i Finlan\" ['Nationalism, liberalism and democracy during the first period of the language conflict in Finland'] ''Historisk Tidskrift,'' 1961, Issue 4, pp. 357\u2013368</ref>\n\nNationalism was contested by the pro-Russian element and by the internationalism of the labor movement. The result was a tendency to class conflict over nationalism, but the early 1900s the working classes split into the Valpas (class struggle emphasis) and M\u00e4kelin (nationalist emphasis).<ref>Osmo Jussila, \"Nationalism and Revolution: Political Dividing Lines in the Grand Duchy of Finland during the Last Years of Russian Rule,\" '' Scandinavian Journal of History'' (1977) 2#4 pp 289\u2013309.</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nWhile the vast majority of Finns were Lutheran, there were two strains to Lutheranism that eventually merged to form the modern Finnish church.  On the one hand  was the high-church emphasis on ritual, with its roots in traditional peasant collective society. [[Paavo Ruotsalainen]] (1777\u20131852) on the other hand was a leader of the new pietism, with its subjectivity, revivalism, emphasis on personal morality, lay participation, and the [[social gospel]].  The pietism appealed to the emerging middle class. The Ecclesiastical Law of 1869 combined the two strains.  Finland's political and Lutheran leaders considered both [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] to be threats to the emerging nation. Orthodoxy was rejected as a weapon of Russification, while anti-Catholicism was long-standing. Anti-Semitism was also a factor, so the Dissenter Law of 1889 upgraded the status only of the minor Protestant sects.<ref>G\u00fcnther Gassmann et al. ''Historical dictionary of Lutheranism'' (2001) p. 296</ref>\n\n===Music===\nBefore 1790 music was found in Lutheran churches and in folk traditions.<ref>Ruth-Esther Hillila, and Barbara Blanchard, ''Historical Dictionary of the Music and Musicians of Finland'' (1997)</ref>  In 1790 music lovers founded the \u00c5bo Musical Society; it gave the first major stimulus to serious music by Finnish composers.  In the 1880s, new institutions, especially the Helsinki Music Institute (since 1939 called the [[Sibelius Academy]]), the  Institute of Music of Helsinki University and the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]], integrated Finland into the mainstream of European music. By far the most influential composer was [[Jean Sibelius]] (1865\u20131957); he composed nearly all his music before 1930.<ref>Denby Richards, \"Music in Finland,\" ''American-Scandinavian Review,'' 1968, Vol. 56 Issue 3, pp. 238\u2013243</ref> In April 1892 Sibelius presented his new symphony 'Kullervo' in Helsinki.

Coordinated by the Lutheran church, the women undertook local charitable social work to ameliorate harsh living conditions created by peasants adjusting to city life. They promoted nursing as a suitable profession for respectable women.  Their efforts helped redefine the complex relationship between private charities and the traditional state and church responsibility for social welfare. Because they volunteered without pay and emphasized motherhood and nurturing as moral values for women, they contributed to the entrenchment of what in the 20th century became widespread gender roles.<ref>Pirjo Markkola, \"Promoting Faith and Welfare: The Deaconess Movement in Finland and Sweden, 1850\u20131930,\" ''Scandinavian Journal of History,'' Mar\u2013June 2000, Vol. 25 Issue 1/2, pp. 101\u2013118</ref>\n\n===Politics===\nDespite certain freedoms granted to Finland, the Grand Duchy was not a democratic state. The tsar retained supreme power and ruled through the highest official in the land, the governor general, almost always a Russian \nofficer. Alexander dissolved the Diet of the Four Estates shortly after convening it in 1809, and it did not meet again for half a century. The tsar's actions were in accordance with the royalist constitution Finland had inherited from Sweden. The Finns had no guarantees of liberty, but depended on the tsar's goodwill for any freedoms they enjoyed. When Alexander II, the Tsar Liberator, convened the Diet again in 1863, he did so not to fulfill any obligation but to meet growing pressures for reform within the empire as a whole. In the remaining decades of the century, the Diet enacted numerous legislative measures that modernized Finland's system of law, made its public administration more efficient, removed obstacles to commerce, and prepared the ground for the country's independence in the next century.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n====Russification====\n\n{{Main|Russification of Finland}}\n\nThe policy of Russification of Finland (1899\u20131905 and 1908\u20131917, called ''sortokaudet/sortovuodet'' (times/years of oppression) in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) was the policy of the Russian czars designed to limit the special status of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and more fully integrate it politically, militarily, and culturally into the empire.<ref>Edward C.

For the first time in Europe, [[universal suffrage]] (right to vote) and eligibility was implemented to include women: Finnish women were the first in Europe to gain full eligibility to vote; and have membership in an estate; land ownership or inherited titles were no longer required.\nHowever, on the local level things were different, as in the municipal elections the number of votes was tied to amount of tax paid. Thus, rich people could cast a number of votes, while the poor perhaps none at all. The municipal voting system was changed to universal suffrage in 1917\nwhen a left-wing majority was elected to Parliament.\n\n===Emigration trends===\n{{main|Finnish American|Canadians of Finnish ancestry}}\nEmigration was especially important 1890\u20131914,<ref>B. R. Mitchell, ''European Historical Statistics, 1750\u20131970'' (Columbia U.P., 1978) p. 47.</ref> with many young men and some families headed to [[Finnish American|Finnish settlements in the United States]], and also [[Canadians of Finnish ancestry|to Canada]].  They typically worked in lumbering and mining, and many were active in Marxist causes on the one hand, or the [[Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America]] on the other.

However, since the late 20th century there has been a steady migration of older, better educated Swedish speakers to Sweden.<ref>Charlotta Hedberg and Kaisa Kepsu, \"Migration as a mode of cultural expression?

Based on the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1916|general election in 1916]], the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]] had a small majority, and the Social Democrat [[Oskari Tokoi]] became prime minister. The new Senate was willing to cooperate with the [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Provisional government]] of Russia, but no agreement was reached. Finland considered the [[personal union]] with Russia to be over after the dethroning of the [[Tsar]]\u2014although the Finns had ''de facto'' recognized the Provisional government as the Tsar's successor by accepting its authority to appoint a new Governor General and Senate. They expected the Tsar's authority to be transferred to Finland's Parliament, which the Provisional government refused, suggesting instead that the question should be settled by the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]].\n\nFor the Finnish Social Democrats it seemed as though the bourgeoisie was an obstacle on Finland's road to independence as well as on the proletariat's road to power. The non-Socialists in Tokoi's Senate were, however, more confident. They, and most of the non-Socialists in the Parliament, rejected the Social Democrats' proposal on parliamentarism (the so-called \"Power Act\") as being too far-reaching and provocative. The act restricted Russia's influence on domestic Finnish matters, but didn't touch the Russian government's power on matters of defence and foreign affairs. For the Russian Provisional government this was, however, far too radical, exceeding the Parliament's authority, and so the Provisional government dissolved the Parliament.\n\nThe minority of the Parliament, and of the Senate, were content. New elections promised a chance for them to gain a majority, which they were convinced would improve the chances to reach an understanding with Russia. The non-Socialists were also inclined to cooperate with the Russian Provisional government because they feared the Social Democrats' power would grow, resulting in radical reforms, such as [[Suffrage|equal suffrage]] in municipal elections, or a [[land reform]]. The majority had the completely opposite opinion. They didn't accept the Provisional government's right to dissolve the Parliament.\n\nThe Social Democrats held on to the Power Act and opposed the promulgation of the decree of dissolution of the Parliament, whereas the non-Socialists voted for promulgating it. The disagreement over the Power Act led to the Social Democrats leaving the Senate. When the Parliament met again after the summer recess in August 1917, only the groups supporting the Power Act were present.  Russian troops took possession of the chamber, the Parliament was dissolved, and new elections were held. The result was a (small) non-Socialist majority and a purely non-Socialist Senate. The suppression of the Power Act, and the cooperation between Finnish non-Socialists and Russia provoked great bitterness among the Socialists, and had resulted in dozens of politically motivated attacks and murders.\n\n===Independence===\nThe [[October Revolution]] of 1917 turned Finnish politics upside down. Now, the new non-Socialist majority of the Parliament desired total independence, and the Socialists came gradually to view Soviet Russia as an example to follow. On November 15, 1917, the [[Bolshevik]]s declared [[Declaration of Rights of Peoples of Russia|a general right of self-determination \"for the Peoples of Russia\"]], including the right of complete secession. On the same day the Finnish Parliament issued a declaration by which it temporarily took power in Finland.\n\nWorried by developments in Russia and Finland, the non-Socialist Senate proposed that  Parliament declare Finland's independence, which was [[Finland's declaration of independence|voted by the Parliament on December 6, 1917]]. On December 18 (December 31 [[New Style|N. S.]]) the [[Sovnarkom|Soviet government]] issued a [[Soviet Decrees|Decree]], recognizing Finland's independence, and on December 22 (January 4, 1918 N. S.) it was approved by the highest Soviet executive body ([[VTsIK]]). Germany and the Scandinavian countries followed without delay.\n\n===Civil war===\n{{main|Finnish Civil War}}\nFinland after 1917 was bitterly divided along social lines. The Whites consisted of the Swedish-speaking middle and upper classes and the farmers and peasantry who dominated the northern two-thirds of the land. They had a conservative outlook and rejected socialism. The Socialist-Communist Reds comprised the Finnish-speaking urban workers and the landless rural cottagers.  They had a radical outlook and rejected capitalism.<ref>Pekka Kalevi Hamalainen, ''In Time of Storm: Revolution, Civil War and the Ethnolinguistic Issue in Finland'' (HIA Book Collection, 1979)</ref>\n\nFrom January to May 1918, Finland experienced the brief but bitter [[Finnish Civil War]]. On one side there were the \"white\" civil guards, who fought for the anti-Socialists. On the other side were the Red Guards, which consisted of workers and tenant farmers. The latter proclaimed a [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic]]. World War I was still underway and the defeat of the Red Guards was achieved with support from [[Imperial Germany]], while Sweden remained neutral and Russia withdrew its forces. The Reds lost the war and the White peasantry rose to political leadership in the 1920s\u20131930s. About 37,000 men died, most of them in prisoner camps ravaged by influenza and other diseases.\n\n==Finland in the inter-war era==\nAfter the civil war the parliament, controlled by the Whites, voted to establish a constitutional monarchy to be called the ''[[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|Kingdom of Finland]]'', with a [[Frederick Charles of Hesse|German prince as king]]. However, Germany's defeat in November  1918 made the plan impossible and Finland instead became a republic, with [[Kaarlo Juho St\u00e5hlberg]] elected as its first President in 1919.  Despite the bitter civil war, and repeated threats from fascist movements, Finland became and remained a capitalist democracy under the rule of law. By contrast, nearby [[History of Estonia|Estonia]], in similar circumstances but without a civil war, started as a democracy and was turned into a dictatorship in 1934.<ref>Alan Siaroff, \"Democratic Breakdown and Democratic Stability: A Comparison of Interwar Estonia and Finland,\" ''Canadian Journal of Political Science'' Vol. 32, No. 1 (March, 1999), pp. 103\u2013124 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3232774 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===Agrarian reform===\nLarge scale agrarian reform in the 1920s involved breaking up the large estates controlled by the old nobility and selling the land to ambitious peasants. The farmers became strong supporters of the government.<ref>Hans J\u00f6rgensen, \"The Inter-War Land Reforms in Estonia, Finland  and Bulgaria: A Comparative Study,\" ''Scandinavian Economic History Review,'' April 2006, Vol. 54 Issue 1, pp. 64\u201397</ref>\n\n===Diplomacy===\nThe new republic faced a dispute over the [[\u00c5land]] Islands, which were overwhelmingly Swedish-speaking and sought retrocession to Sweden. However, as Finland was not willing to cede the islands, they were offered an autonomous status. Nevertheless, the residents did not approve the offer, and the dispute over the islands was submitted to the [[League of Nations]]. The League decided that Finland should retain sovereignty over the \u00c5land Islands, but they should be made an autonomous province. Thus Finland was under an obligation to ensure the residents of the \u00c5land Islands a right to maintain the [[Swedish language]], as well as their own culture and local traditions. At the same time, an international treaty was concluded on the neutral status of \u00c5land, under which it was prohibited to place military headquarters or forces on the islands.\n\n===Prohibition===\nAlcohol abuse had a long history, especially regarding binge drinking and public intoxication, which became a crime in 1733. In the 19th century the punishments became stiffer and stiffer, but the problem persisted. A strong abstinence movement emerged that cut consumption in half from the 1880s to the 1910s, and gave Finland the lowest drinking rate in Europe. Four attempts at instituting [[Prohibition in Finland|prohibition of alcohol]] during the Grand Duchy period were rejected by the czar; with the czar gone Finland enacted prohibition in 1919. Smuggling emerged and enforcement was slipshod. Criminal convictions for drunkenness went up by 500%, and violence and crime rates soared. Public opinion turned against the law, and a national plebiscite went 70% for repeal, so prohibition was ended in early 1932.<ref>John H. Wuorinen, \"Finland's Prohibition Experiment,\" ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' vol. 163, (September, 1932), pp. 216\u2013226 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1017701 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>S.

Initially the movement gained widespread support among anti-Communist Finns, but following [[M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 Rebellion|a failed coup attempt]] in 1932 it was banned and its leaders imprisoned.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/topic/Lapua-Movement</ref>\n\n===Relations with Soviet Union===\nIn the wake of the Civil War there were many incidents along the border between Finland and Soviet Russia, such as the [[Aunus expedition]] and the [[Pork mutiny]]. Relations with the Soviets were improved after the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Finnish)|Treaty of Tartu]] in 1920, in which Finland gained [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]], but gave up its claims on [[East Karelia]].\n\nTens of thousands of radical Finns\u2014from Finland, the United States and Canada\u2014took up Stalin's 1923 appeal to create a new Soviet society in the [[Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]  (KASSR), a part of Russia.\nMost were executed in the purges of the 1930s.<ref>James S. Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas and Nicholas C. J. Pappas, ''An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires'' (1994) p. 350.</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union started to tighten its policy against Finland in the 1930s, limiting the navigation of Finnish merchant ships between [[Lake Ladoga]] and the [[Gulf of Finland]] and blocking it totally in 1937.\n\n==Finland in the Second World War==\n{{Main|Military history of Finland during World War II|Diplomatic history of World War II#Finland}}\n\n[[File:Suurin Suomi.PNG|thumb|The area controlled by Finland at its largest, in 1942]]\n\nDuring the Second World War, Finland fought two wars against the Soviet Union: the [[Winter War]] of 1939\u20131940, resulting in the loss of [[Finnish Karelia]], and the [[Continuation War]] of 1941\u20131944 (with considerable support from [[Nazi Germany]] resulting in a swift invasion of [[East Karelia|neighboring areas]] of the Soviet Union), eventually leading to the loss of Finland's only ice-free winter harbour [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]]. The Continuation War was, in accordance with the [[Moscow armistice|armistice conditions]], immediately followed by the [[Lapland War]] of 1944\u20131945, when Finland fought the Germans to force them to withdraw from northern Finland back into Norway (then under German occupation).<ref>Henrik O.

After the [[Invasion of Poland]], the Soviet Union sent ultimatums to the Baltic countries, where it demanded military bases on their soil. The Baltic states accepted Soviet demands, and lost their independence in the summer of 1940. In October 1939, the Soviet Union sent the same kind of request to Finland, but the Finns refused to give any land areas or military bases for the usage of the Red Army. This caused the Soviet Union to start a [[Winter War|military invasion against Finland]] on 30 November 1939. Soviet leaders predicted that Finland would be conquered in a couple of weeks. However, even though the Red Army had huge superiority in men, tanks, guns and airplanes, the Finns were able to defend their country for about 3.5 months and still avoid invasion successfully. The Winter War ended on 13 March 1940 with the [[Moscow peace treaty]], in which Finland lost the [[Karelian Isthmus]] to the Soviet Union. The Winter War was a big loss of prestige for the Soviet Union, and it was expelled from the League of Nations because of the illegal attack. Finland received lots of international goodwill and material help from many countries during the war.<ref>Eloise Engle, ''The Winter War: The Soviet Attack on Finland 1939\u20131940'' (1992)</ref>\n\nAfter the Winter War the Finnish army was exhausted, and needed recovery and support as soon as possible. The British declined to help but in autumn 1940 Nazi Germany offered weapon deals to Finland, if the Finnish government would allow German troops to travel through Finland to occupied Norway. Finland accepted, weapon deals were made and military co-operation began in December 1940.<ref>Lunde, ''Finland's War of Choice: The Troubled German-Finnish Alliance in World War II'' (2011)</ref>\n\nFinland's support from, and coordination with, Nazi Germany starting during the winter of 1940\u201341 and made other countries considerably less sympathetic to the Finnish cause; particularly since the [[Continuation War]] led to a Finnish invasion of the Soviet Union designed not only to recover lost territory, but additionally to answer the irredentist sentiment of a [[Greater Finland]] by [[Finnish military administration in Eastern Karelia, 1941\u20131944|incorporating East Karelia]], whose inhabitants were culturally related to the Finnish people, although [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] by religion. This invasion had caused Britain to declare war on Finland on 6 December 1941.\n\nFinland managed to defend its democracy, contrary to most other countries within the Soviet sphere of influence, and suffered comparably limited losses in terms of civilian lives and property. It was, however, punished harsher than other German [[co-belligerence|co-belligerents]] and allies, having to pay large [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|reparations]] and resettle an eighth of its population after having lost an eighth of the territory including one of its industrial heartlands and the second-largest city of [[Vyborg|Viipuri]]. After the war, the Soviet government settled these gained territories with people from many different regions of the USSR, for instance from [[Ukraine]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\nThe Finnish government did not participate in the systematic killing of Jews, although the country remained a \"co-belligrent\", a ''[[de facto]]'' ally of Germany until 1944. In total, eight German Jewish refugees were handed over to the German authorities. In the [[Tehran Conference]] of 1942, the leaders of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] agreed that Finland was fighting a separate war against the Soviet Union, and that in no way was it hostile to the Western allies. The Soviet Union was the only Allied country against which Finland had conducted military operations. Unlike any of the Axis nations, Finland was a parliamentary democracy throughout the 1939\u20131945 period. The commander of Finnish armed forces during the Winter War and the Continuation War, [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]], became the [[President of Finland]] after the war. Finland made a separate peace contract with the Soviet Union on 19 September 1944, and was the only bordering country of USSR in Europe (alongside [[Norway]], which has only gained its own border with the Soviet Union after the war) that kept its independence after the war.\n\nDuring and in between the wars, approximately 80,000 [[Finnish war-children]] were evacuated abroad: 5% went to Norway, 10% to Denmark, and the rest to Sweden. Most of the children were sent back by 1948, but 15\u201320% remained abroad.\n\nThe [[Moscow Armistice]] was signed between [[Finland]] on one side and the Soviet Union and Britain on the other side on September 19, 1944, ending the [[Continuation War]]. The armistice compelled Finland to drive German troops from its territory, leading to the [[Lapland War]] 1944\u20131945.\n\nIn 1947, Finland reluctantly declined [[Marshall aid]] in order to preserve good relations with the Soviets, ensuring Finnish autonomy.<ref name=\"Jakobson\">Jakobson, Max. ''Finland in the New Europe''. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 2009. p. 54</ref> Nevertheless, the United States shipped secret development aid and financial aid to the non-communist [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|SDP]] (Social Democratic Party).<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Hidden+help+from+across+the+Atlantic/1135223633788 Hidden help from across the Atlantic], Helsingin Sanomat</ref> Establishing trade with the Western powers, such as Britain, and the reparations to the Soviet Union caused Finland to transform itself from a primarily [[Agriculture|agrarian]] economy to an [[Industrialisation|industrialised]] one. After the reparations had been paid off, Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union in the framework of [[Bilateralism|bilateral trade]].\n\nFinland's role in the Second World War was in many ways strange. Firstly the Soviet Union tried to invade Finland in 1939\u20131940. However, even with massive superiority in military strength, the Soviet Union was unable to conquer Finland. In late 1940, German-Finnish co-operation began; it took a form that was unique when compared to relations with the [[The Axis|Axis]]. Finland signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which made Finland an ally with Germany in the war against the Soviet Union. But, unlike all other Axis states, Finland never signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] and so Finland never was ''[[de jure]]'' an Axis nation.\n\n===Memorials===\nAlthough Finland lost territory in both of its wars with the Soviets, the memory of these wars was sharply etched in the national consciousness. Despite its military defeats, Finland celebrates these wars as a victory for the Finnish national spirit, which survived against long odds and allowed Finland to maintain its independence. Many groups of Finns are commemorated ''[how, specifically?]'' today, including not just fallen soldiers and veterans, but also orphans, evacuees from [[Karelia]], the children who were evacuated to Sweden, women who worked during the war at home or in factories, and the veterans of the women's defense unit [[Lotta Sv\u00e4rd]].\n\nSome of these groups could not be properly commemorated until long after the war ended ''[why not?]''. However, after a long political campaign backed by survivors of what Finns call the Partisan War, the Finnish Parliament passed legislation establishing compensation for the war's victims.<ref>Tyyne Martikainen \"Partisaanisodan siviiliuhrit\", 2002.</ref><ref>Ville Kivim\u00e4ki, \"Between Defeat and Victory: Finnish memory culture of the Second World War,\" ''Scandinavian Journal of History'' (2012) 37#4 pp 482\u2013504 [http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/viewarticle?data=dGJyMPPp44rp2%2fdV0%2bnjisfk5Ie42eqLtaashd%2ff7Ebj3u2L8rayR7CmrUqup7I4s7CyULirtDjOw6SM8Nfsi9%2fZ8oHt5Od8u6O2TrGstE2urLQ%2b6tfsf7vb7D7i2LuA59ekjN%2fdu1nMnN%2bGu623UbattVGvnOSH8OPfjLvm4n7E6%2bqE0tv2jAAA&hid=4209 online]</ref>\n\n==Postwar==\n\n===Neutrality in Cold War===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Finlandization]] -->\nFinland retained a democratic constitution and free economy during the [[Cold War]] era. Treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 with the Soviet Union included obligations and restraints on Finland, as well as territorial concessions. The [[Paris Peace Treaty]] (1947) limited the size and the nature of Finland's armed forces. Weapons were to be solely defensive. A deepening of postwar tensions led a year later to the [[Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance]] (1948) with the Soviet Union. The latter, in particular, was the foundation of Finno-Soviet relations in the postwar era. Under the terms of the treaty, Finland was bound to confer with the Soviets and perhaps to accept their aid if an attack from Germany, or countries allied with Germany, seems likely. The treaty prescribed consultations between the two countries, but it had no mechanism for automatic Soviet intervention in a time of crisis.<ref name=\"LOC\"/> Both treaties have been abrogated by Finland since the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, while leaving the borders untouched. Even though being a neighbor to the Soviet Union sometimes resulted in overcautious concern in foreign policy (\"[[Finlandization]]\"), Finland developed closer co-operation with the other [[Nordic countries]] and declared itself [[Neutral country|neutral]] in superpower politics.\n\nThe Finnish post-war president, Juho Kusti Paasikivi, a leading conservative politician, saw that an essential element of Finnish foreign policy must be a credible guarantee to the Soviet Union that it need not fear attack from, or through, Finnish territory. Because a policy of neutrality was a political component of this guarantee, Finland would ally itself with no one. Another aspect of the guarantee was that Finnish defenses had to be sufficiently strong to defend the nation's territory. This policy remained the core of Finland's foreign relations for the rest of the Cold War era.<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nIn 1952, Finland and the countries of the [[Nordic Council]] entered into a passport union, allowing their citizens to cross borders without passports and soon also to apply for jobs and claim social security benefits in the other countries. Many from Finland used this opportunity to secure better-paying jobs in Sweden in the 1950s and 1960s, dominating Sweden's first wave of post-war labour immigrants. Although Finnish wages and standard of living could not compete with wealthy Sweden until the 1970s, the Finnish economy rose remarkably from the ashes of World War II, resulting in the buildup of another Nordic-style welfare state.\n\nDespite the passport union with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland, Finland could not join the [[Nordic Council]] until 1955 because of Soviet fears that Finland might become too close to the West. At that time the Soviet Union saw the [[Nordic Council]] as part of [[NATO]] of which Denmark, Norway and Iceland were members. That same year Finland joined the [[United Nations]], though it had already been associated with a number of UN specialized organisations.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/8717537 Norbert G\u00f6tz. \u201c\u2018In a Class by Itself\u2019: Cold War Politics and Finland\u2019s Position vis-\u00e0-vis the United Nations, 1945\u20131956.\u201d ''Journal of Cold War Studies'' 10 (2008) 2: 73\u201398.]</ref> The first Finnish ambassador to the UN was G.A. Gripenberg (1956\u20131959), followed by Ralph Enckell (1959\u20131965), [[Max Jakobson]] (1965\u20131972), Aarno Karhilo (1972\u20131977), Ilkka Pastinen (1977\u20131983), [[Keijo Korhonen]] (1983\u20131988), Klaus T\u00f6rnudd (1988\u20131991), Wilhelm Breitenstein (1991\u20131998) and Marjatta Rasi (1998\u20132005). In 1972 Max Jakobson was a candidate for [[Secretary-General]] of the UN. In another remarkable event of 1955, the Soviet Union decided to return the [[Porkkala]] peninsula to Finland, which had been rented to the Soviet Union in 1948 for 50 years as a military base, a situation which somewhat endangered Finnish sovereignty and neutrality.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-P0801-026, Helsinki, KSZE-Konferenz, Schlussakte.jpg|300px|thumb| Signing the Helsinki Accords are the West German Chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]], East Germany's leader [[Erich Honecker]], US president [[Gerald Ford]] and the Austrian chancellor [[Bruno Kreisky]]]]\n\nOfficially claiming to be [[Neutral country|neutral]], Finland lay in the grey zone between the [[Western world|Western countries]] and the Soviet Union. The \"[[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|YYA Treaty]]\" (Finno-Soviet Pact of ''Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance'') gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics. However, Finland maintained [[capitalism]] unlike most other countries bordering the Soviet Union. Property rights were strong. While nationalization committees were set up in France and UK, Finland avoided nationalizations. After failed experiments with protectionism in the 1950s, Finland eased restrictions and committed to a series of international free trade agreements: first an associate membership in the [[European Free Trade Association]] in 1961, a full membership in 1986 and also an agreement with the [[European Community]] in 1973. Local education markets expanded and an increasing number of Finns also went abroad to study in the United States or Western Europe, bringing back advanced skills. There was a quite common, but pragmatic-minded, credit and investment cooperation by state and corporations, though it was considered with suspicion. Support for capitalism was widespread.<ref name=\"equity\">[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRANETSOCIALDEVELOPMENT/Resources/finland.pdf Growth and Equity in Finland], World Bank</ref> Savings rate hovered among the world's highest, at around 8% until the 1980s. In the beginning of the 1970s, Finland's GDP per capita reached the level of Japan and the UK. Finland's economic development shared many aspects with export-led Asian countries.<ref name=\"equity\"/>\n\nBuilding on its status as western democratic country with friendly ties with the Soviet Union, Finland pushed to reduce the political and military tensions of cold war. Since the 1960s, Finland urged the formation of a [[Nordic Nuclear Weapons Free Zone]] (Nordic NWFZ), and in 1972-1973 was the host of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which culminated in the signing of the [[Helsinki Accords]] in 1975 and lead to the creation of the [[Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]].<ref name=\"LOC\"/>\n\n===Society and the welfare state===\nBefore 1940 Finland was a poor rural nation of urban and rural workers and independent farmers. There was a small middle class, employed chiefly as civil servants and in small local businesses.

In animistic thinking, it is \"an independent agent, a personal power which like a demon can fall upon a man and take possession of him, enabling him or compelling him to perform manifestations of power\" while in dynamistic thought it \"appears as an impersonal force which fills a man like a fluid\".{{sfn|Bultmann|2007|p=155}} Both kinds of thought appear in Jewish and Christian scripture, but animistic is more typical of the Old Testament whereas dynamistic is more common in the New Testament.{{sfn|Bultmann|2007|pp=156\u2013157}} The distinction coincides with the Holy Spirit as either a temporary or permanent gift. In the Old Testament and Jewish thought, it is primarily temporary with a specific situation or task in mind, whereas in the Christian concept the gift resides in man permanently.{{sfn|Bultmann|2007|pp=157}}\n\nOn the surface, the Holy Spirit appears to have an equivalent in non-Abrahamic [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Hellenistic mystery religions]]. These religions included a distinction between the [[spirit]] and [[Soul in the Bible|psyche]], which is also seen in the [[Pauline epistles]]. According to proponents of the [[History of religions school]], the Christian concept of the Holy Spirit cannot be explained from Jewish ideas alone without reference to the Hellenistic religions.{{sfn|Konsmo|2010|p=2}} However, according to theologian Erik Konsmo, the views \"are so dissimilar that the only legitimate connection one can make is with the Greek term \u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1 [''[[pneuma]]'', Spirit] itself\".{{sfn|Konsmo|2010|p=5}}\n\nAnother link with ancient Greek thought is the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] idea of the spirit as ''[[anima mundi]]''\u2014or world soul\u2014that unites all people.{{sfn|Konsmo|2010|p=5}} Some believe that this can be seen in Paul's formulation of the concept of the Holy Spirit that unites [[Christians]] in [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]] and love for one another, but Konsmo again thinks that this position is difficult to maintain.{{sfn|Konsmo|2010|p=6}} In his Introduction to the 1964 book ''[[Meditations]]'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth wrote:\n<blockquote>\nAnother Stoic concept which offered inspiration to the Church was that of 'divine Spirit'. Cleanthes, wishing to give more explicit meaning to Zeno's 'creative fire', had been the first to hit upon the term ''pneuma'', or 'spirit', to describe it. Like fire, this intelligent 'spirit' was imagined as a tenuous substance akin to a current of air or breath, but essentially possessing the quality of warmth; it was immanent in the universe as God, and in man as the soul and life-giving principle. Clearly it is not a long step from this to the 'Holy Spirit' of Christian theology, the 'Lord and Giver of life', visibly manifested as tongues of fire at Pentecost and ever since associated \u2013 in the Christian as in the Stoic mind \u2013 with the ideas of vital fire and beneficient warmth.<ref>{{cite book |last=Aurelius |first=Marcus |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=25 |id={{ISBN|978-0-140-44140-6}} |isbn=0-14044140-9}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Abrahamic religions ==\n=== Judaism ===\n{{Main|Holy Spirit in Judaism}}\n\nThe Hebrew language phrase ''ruach ha-kodesh'' ([[Hebrew]]: \u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9, \"holy spirit\" also transliterated ''ruac\u1e25 ha-qodesh'') is a term used in the Hebrew Bible ([[Tanakh]]) and Jewish writings to refer to the spirit of [[YHWH]] (\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4).

Because of the weak, induced dipole\u2013dipole [[interaction]] between the helium atoms, their microscopic physical properties are mainly determined by their [[zero-point energy]]. Also, the microscopic properties of helium-3 cause it to have a higher zero-point energy than helium-4. This implies that helium-3 can overcome dipole\u2013dipole interactions with less [[thermal energy]] than helium-4 can.\n\nThe [[quantum mechanical]] effects on helium-3 and helium-4 are significantly different because with two [[proton]]s, two [[neutron]]s, and two [[electron]]s, helium-4 has an overall [[spin (physics)|spin]] of zero, making it a [[boson]], but with one fewer neutron, helium-3 has an overall spin of one half, making it a [[fermion]].\n\nHelium-3 boils at 3.19 [[kelvin|K]] compared with helium-4 at 4.23 K, and its [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] is also lower at 3.35 K, compared with helium-4 at 5.2 K. Helium-3 has less than half the density of Helium-4 when it is at its boiling point: 59 gram per liter compared to the 125 gram per liter of helium-4\u2014at a pressure of one atmosphere.

[[Image:fusion rxnrate.svg|right|300px|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off.

The appeal of helium-3 fusion stems from the [[aneutronic fusion|aneutronic]] nature of its reaction products. Helium-3 itself is non-radioactive. The lone high-energy by-product, the [[proton]], can be contained using electric and magnetic fields. The momentum energy of this proton (created in the fusion process) will interact with the containing electromagnetic field, resulting in direct net electricity generation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/presentations/jfs_ieee0904.pdf|format=PDF|title= Lunar <sup>3</sup>He and Fusion Power|author=John Santarius|date=September 28, 2004|accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the higher [[Coulomb barrier]], the temperatures required for <sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>H + <sup>3</sup><sub>2</sub>He fusion are much higher than those of conventional [[D-T fusion]]. Moreover, since both reactants need to be mixed together to fuse, reactions between nuclei of the same reactant will occur, and the D-D reaction (<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>H + <sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>H) does produce a [[neutron]]. Reaction rates vary with temperature, but the D-<sup>3</sup>He reaction rate is never greater than 3.56 times the D-D reaction rate (see graph). Therefore, fusion using D-3He fuel at the right temperature and a D-lean fuel mixture, can produce a much lower neutron flux than D-T fusion, but is not clean, negating some of its main attraction.\n\nThe second possibility, fusing <sup>3</sup><sub>2</sub>He with itself (<sup>3</sup><sub>2</sub>He + <sup>3</sup><sub>2</sub>He), requires even higher temperatures (since now both reactants have a +2 charge), and thus is even more difficult than the D-<sup>3</sup>He reaction. However, it does offer a possible reaction that produces no neutrons; the charged protons produced can be contained using electric and magnetic fields, which in turn results in direct electricity generation. <sup>3</sup><sub>2</sub>He + <sup>3</sup><sub>2</sub>He fusion is feasible as demonstrated in the laboratory and has immense advantages, but commercial viability is many years in the future.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/19296/|title=Mining the Moon: Lab experiments suggest that future fusion reactors could use helium-3 gathered from the moon|author=Mark Williams|journal=MIT Technology Review|date=August 23, 2007|accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref>\n\nThe amounts of helium-3 needed as a replacement for [[fossil fuel|conventional fuel]]s are substantial by comparison to amounts currently available. The total amount of energy produced in the [[Deuterium|<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>H]]&nbsp;+&nbsp;<sup>3</sup><sub>2</sub>He reaction is 18.4 M[[electronvolt|eV]], which corresponds to some 493 [[watt-hour|megawatt-hour]]s (4.93\u00d710<sup>8</sup> W\u00b7h) per three [[gram]]s (one [[mole (chemistry)|mole]]) of \u00b3He. If the total amount of energy could be converted to electrical power with 100% efficiency (a physical impossibility), it would correspond to about 30 minutes of output of a gigawatt electrical plant per mole of <sup>3</sup>He.  Thus, a year's production (at 6 grams for each operation hour) would require 52.5 kilograms of helium-3. The amount of fuel needed for large-scale applications can also be put in terms of total consumption: electricity consumption by 107 million U.S. households in 2001<ref>Date from the US Energy Information Administration</ref> totaled 1,140 billion kW\u00b7h (1.14\u00d710<sup>15</sup> W\u00b7h). Again assuming 100% conversion efficiency, 6.7 [[tonne]]s per year of helium-3 would be required for that segment of the energy demand of the United States, 15 to 20 tonnes per year given a more realistic end-to-end conversion efficiency.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n== Neutron detection ==\nHelium-3 is a most important isotope in instrumentation for [[neutron detection]].

Helium-4 nuclei are [[boson]]s, containing an even number of spin {{frac|1|2}} particles. This is a direct result of the [[Angular momentum quantum number#Addition of quantized angular momenta|addition rules]] for quantized angular momentum. At low temperatures (about 2.17 K), helium-4 undergoes a [[phase transition]]: A fraction of it enters a [[superfluid]] [[phase (matter)|phase]] that can be roughly understood as a type of [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]]. Such a mechanism is not available for helium-3 atoms, which are fermions. However, it was widely speculated that helium-3 could also become a superfluid at much lower temperatures, if the atoms formed into ''pairs'' analogous to [[Cooper pair]]s in the [[BCS theory]] of [[superconductivity]]. Each Cooper pair, having integer spin, can be thought of as a boson. During the 1970s, [[David Lee (physicist)|David Lee]], [[Douglas Osheroff]] and [[Robert Coleman Richardson]] discovered two phase transitions along the melting curve, which were soon realized to be the two superfluid phases of helium-3.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Osheroff|first=D.

The B-phase is the low-temperature, low-pressure phase which has an isotropic energy gap. The A-phase is the higher temperature, higher pressure phase that is further stabilized by a magnetic field and has two point nodes in its gap. The presence of two phases is a clear indication that <sup>3</sup>He is an unconventional superfluid (superconductor), since the presence of two phases requires an additional symmetry, other than gauge symmetry, to be broken. In fact, it is a ''p''-wave superfluid, with spin one, '''S'''=1, and angular momentum one, '''L'''=1. The ground state corresponds to total angular momentum zero, '''J'''='''S'''+'''L'''=0 (vector addition). Excited states are possible with non-zero total angular momentum, '''J'''>0, which are excited pair collective modes. Because of the extreme purity of superfluid <sup>3</sup>He (since all materials except <sup>4</sup>He have solidified and\nsunk to the bottom of the liquid <sup>3</sup>He and any <sup>4</sup>He has phase separated entirely, this is the most pure condensed matter state), these collective modes have been studied with much greater precision than in any other unconventional pairing system.\n\n== Medical lung imaging ==\nHelium-3 nuclei have an intrinsic [[nuclear spin]] of {{frac|1|2}}, and a relatively high [[magnetogyric ratio]].

Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen and is typically produced by bombarding lithium-6 with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. The lithium nucleus absorbs a neutron and splits into helium-4 and tritium. Tritium decays into helium-3 with a half-life of 12.3 years, so helium-3 can be produced by simply storing the tritium until it undergoes radioactive decay.\n\nTritium is a critical component of [[nuclear weapons]] and historically it was produced and stockpiled primarily for this application. The decay of tritium into helium-3 reduces the explosive power of the fusion warhead, so periodically the accumulated helium-3 must be removed from warhead reservoirs and tritium in storage.

Jupiter's high gravity makes this a less energetically favorable operation than extracting helium-3 from the other gas giants of the solar system, however.\n\nNot all authors feel the extraterrestrial extraction of helium-3 is feasible. Dwayne Day, writing in The Space Review, identifies some major obstacles to helium-3 extraction from extraterrestrial sources for use in fusion, and questions the feasibility of extraterrestrial extraction when compared to production on Earth.<ref>[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2834/1] The Helium-3 Incantation</ref>\n\n== Power generation ==\n{{Weasel|section|date=March 2013}}\nA second-generation approach to controlled [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] power involves combining helium-3 (<sup>3</sup><sub>2</sub>He) and [[deuterium]] ([[Deuterium|<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>H]]). This reaction produces a [[helium-4]] ion ([[Helium-4|<sup>4</sup><sub>2</sub>He]]) (like an [[alpha particle]], but of different origin) and a high-energy [[proton]] (positively charged hydrogen ion) (<sup>1</sup><sub>1</sub>p). The most important potential advantage of this fusion reaction for power production as well as other applications lies in its compatibility with the use of [[electrostatic]] fields to control fuel [[ion]]s and the fusion protons. High speed protons, as positively charged particles, can have their kinetic energy converted directly into [[electricity]], through use of [[Solid-state chemistry|solid-state]] conversion materials as well as other techniques. Potential conversion efficiencies of 70% may be possible, as there is no need to convert proton energy to heat in order to drive a [[turbine]]-powered [[Electric generator|electrical generator]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}.\n\nThere have been many claims about the capabilities of helium-3 power plants. According to proponents, fusion power plants operating on [[deuterium]] and helium-3 would offer lower capital and [[operating cost]]s than their competitors due to less technical complexity, higher conversion efficiency, smaller size, the absence of radioactive fuel, no air or water [[pollution]], and only low-level [[radioactive]] waste disposal requirements. Recent estimates suggest that about $6 billion in [[investment]] [[Capital (economics)|capital]] will be required to develop and construct the first helium-3 fusion [[power plant]]. Financial breakeven at today's wholesale [[electricity]] prices (5 US cents per [[kilowatt-hour]]) would occur after five 1-[[gigawatt]] plants were on line, replacing old conventional plants or meeting new demand.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/1283056.html?page=4|title=Mining The Moon|author=Paul DiMare|date=October 2004|accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref>\n\nThe reality is not so clear-cut. The most advanced fusion programs in the world are [[inertial confinement fusion]] (such as [[National Ignition Facility]]) and [[magnetic confinement fusion]] (such as [[ITER]] and [[Wendelstein 7-X]]). In the case of the former, there is no solid roadmap to power generation. In the case of the latter, commercial power generation is not expected until around 2050.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iter.org/proj/Pages/ITERAndBeyond.aspx |title=ITER & Beyond |accessdate=2009-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520151601/http://www.iter.org/PROJ/Pages/ITERAndBeyond.aspx |archivedate=2009-05-20 |df= }}</ref> In both cases, the type of fusion discussed is the simplest: D-T fusion. The reason for this is the very low [[Coulomb barrier]] for this reaction; for D+<sup>3</sup>He, the barrier is much higher, and it is even higher for <sup>3</sup>He\u2013<sup>3</sup>He. The immense cost of reactors like [[ITER]] and [[National Ignition Facility]] are largely due to their immense size, yet to scale up to higher plasma temperatures would require reactors far larger still. The 14.7 MeV proton and 3.6 MeV alpha particle from D\u2013<sup>3</sup>He fusion, plus the higher conversion efficiency, means that more electricity is obtained per kilogram than with D-T fusion (17.6 MeV), but not that much more. As a further downside, the rates of reaction for [[Aneutronic fusion#Candidate aneutronic reactions|helium-3 fusion reactions]] are not particularly high, requiring a reactor that is larger still or more reactors to produce the same amount of electricity.\n\nTo attempt to work around this problem of massively large power plants that may not even be economical with D-T fusion, let alone the far more challenging D\u2013<sup>3</sup>He fusion, a number of other reactors have been proposed&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Fusor]], [[Polywell]], [[Focus fusion]], and many more, though many of these concepts have fundamental problems with achieving a net energy gain, and generally attempt to achieve fusion in thermal disequilibrium, something that could potentially prove impossible,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/29869|title=A general critique of inertial-electrostatic confinement fusion systems|author= Todd Rider|accessdate=2007-05-07}}</ref> and consequently, these long-shot programs tend to have trouble garnering funding despite their low budgets. Unlike the \"big\", \"hot\" fusion systems, however, if such systems were to work, they could scale to the higher barrier \"[[aneutronic fusion|aneutronic]]\" fuels, and therefore their proponents tend to promote [[Aneutronic fusion#Proton\u2013boron fusion|p-B fusion]], which requires no exotic fuels like helium-3.\n\n== References in science fiction ==\nSeveral [[science fiction]] works have featured helium-3 extraction on the moon, including the films ''[[Moon (film)|Moon]]'' (2009) and ''[[Iron Sky]]'' (2012), the manga and corresponding anime [[Planetes]], the video game ''[[Anno 2205]]'' (2015) and the novel ''[[Luna: New Moon]]'' (2015).

It is usually denoted by ''H'', also ''\u021e'' or ''\u0124''. Its [[Spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] is the set of possible outcomes when one measures the total energy of a system.  Because of its close relation to the time-evolution of a system, it is of fundamental importance in most formulations of quantum theory.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is named after [[William Rowan Hamilton]], who created a revolutionary reformation of [[Newtonian mechanics]], now called [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], that is important in quantum physics.\n\n==Introduction==\n\n{{main|Operator (physics)#Operators in quantum mechanics}}\n\nThe Hamiltonian is the sum of the kinetic energies of all the particles, plus the potential energy of the particles associated with the system. For different situations or number of particles, the Hamiltonian is different since it includes the sum of kinetic energies of the particles, and the potential energy function corresponding to the situation.\n\n==The Schr\u00f6dinger Hamiltonian==\n\n===One particle===\n\nBy analogy with [[classical mechanics]], the Hamiltonian is commonly expressed as the sum of [[Hermitian operators|operators]] corresponding to the [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy|potential]] energies of a system in the form\n\n:<math> \\hat{H} = \\hat{T} + \\hat{V}, </math>\n\nwhere\n:<math> \\hat{V} = V = V(\\mathbf{r},t) ,</math>\nis the [[potential energy]] operator and \n:<math>\\hat{T} = \\frac{\\mathbf{\\hat{p}}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat{p}}}{2m} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2,</math>\nis the [[kinetic energy]] operator in which ''m'' is the [[mass]] of the particle, the dot denotes the [[dot product]] of vectors, and \n:<math> \\hat{p} = -i\\hbar\\nabla ,</math>\nis the [[momentum operator]] where an \u2207 is the [[del]] [[operator (mathematics)|operator]]. The [[dot product]] of \u2207 with itself is the [[Laplacian]] \u2207<sup>2</sup>. In three dimensions using [[Cartesian coordinates]] the Laplace operator is\n:<math>\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{{\\partial x}^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{{\\partial y}^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{{\\partial z}^2}</math>\n\nAlthough this is not the technical definition of the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian in classical mechanics]], it is the form it most commonly takes. Combining these together yields the familiar form used in the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\hat{H} & = \\hat{T} + \\hat{V} \\\\\n & = \\frac{\\mathbf{\\hat{p}}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat{p}}}{2m}+ V(\\mathbf{r},t) \\\\\n & = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2+ V(\\mathbf{r},t)\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich allows one to apply the Hamiltonian to systems described by a [[wave function]] ''\u03a8''('''r''', ''t''). This is the approach commonly taken in introductory treatments of quantum mechanics, using the formalism of Schr\u00f6dinger's wave mechanics.\n\nOne can also make substitutions to certain variables to fit specific cases, such as some involving electromagnetic fields.\n\n===Many particles===\n\nThe formalism can be extended to ''N'' particles:\n\n:<math> \\hat{H} = \\sum_{n=1}^N \\hat{T}_n + V </math>\n\nwhere\n:<math> V = V(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2\\cdots \\mathbf{r}_N,t) ,</math>\nis the potential energy function, now a function of the spatial configuration of the system and time (a particular set of spatial positions at some instant of time defines a configuration) and;\n:<math> \\hat{T}_n = \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_n\\cdot\\mathbf{p}_n}{2m_n} ,</math>\nis the kinetic energy operator of particle ''n'', and \u2207<sub>n</sub> is the gradient for particle ''n'', \u2207<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> is the Laplacian for particle using the coordinates:\n:<math>\\nabla_n^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_n^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y_n^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z_n^2},</math>\n\nCombining these yields the Schr\u00f6dinger Hamiltonian for the ''N''-particle case:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \\hat{H} & = \\sum_{n=1}^N \\hat{T}_n + V \\\\\n & = \\sum_{n=1}^N \\frac{\\mathbf{\\hat{p}}_n\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat{p}}_n}{2m_n}+ V(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2\\cdots\\mathbf{r}_N,t) \\\\\n & = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\\sum_{n=1}^N \\frac{1}{m_n}\\nabla_n^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2\\cdots\\mathbf{r}_N,t)\n\\end{align} </math>\n\nHowever, complications can arise in the [[many-body problem]]. Since the potential energy depends on the spatial arrangement of the particles, the kinetic energy will also depend on the spatial configuration to conserve energy. The motion due to any one particle will vary due to the motion of all the other particles in the system. For this reason cross terms for kinetic energy may appear in the Hamiltonian; a mix of the gradients for two particles:\n\n:<math>-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2M}\\nabla_i\\cdot\\nabla_j </math>\n\nwhere ''M'' denotes the mass of the collection of particles resulting in this extra kinetic energy. Terms of this form are known as ''mass polarization terms'', and appear in the Hamiltonian of many electron atoms (see below).\n\nFor ''N'' interacting particles, i.e. particles which interact mutually and constitute a many-body situation, the potential energy function ''V'' is ''not'' simply a sum of the separate potentials (and certainly not a product, as this is dimensionally incorrect). The potential energy function can only be written as above: a function of all the spatial positions of each particle.\n\nFor non-interacting particles, i.e. particles which do not interact mutually and move independently, the potential of the system is the sum of the separate potential energy for each particle,<ref name=\"QuantumPhysics\">Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles (2nd Edition), R. Resnick, R. Eisberg, John Wiley & Sons, 1985, {{ISBN|978-0-471-87373-0}}</ref> that is\n\n:<math> V = \\sum_{i=1}^N V(\\mathbf{r}_i,t) = V(\\mathbf{r}_1,t) + V(\\mathbf{r}_2,t) + \\cdots + V(\\mathbf{r}_N,t) </math>\n\nThe general form of the Hamiltonian in this case is:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \\hat{H} & = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{1}{m_i}\\nabla_i^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^N V_i\\\\\n & = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_i}\\nabla_i^2 + V_i \\right) \\\\\n & = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\hat{H}_i \\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all particles and their corresponding potentials; the result is that the Hamiltonian of the system is the sum of the separate Hamiltonians for each particle. This is an idealized situation - in practice the particles are almost always influenced by some potential, and there are many-body interactions. One illustrative example of a two-body interaction where this form would not apply is for electrostatic potentials due to charged particles, because they interact with each other by Coulomb interaction (electrostatic force), as shown below.\n\n==Schr\u00f6dinger equation==\n\n{{Main|Schr\u00f6dinger equation}}\nThe Hamiltonian generates the time evolution of quantum states. If <math> \\left| \\psi (t) \\right\\rangle</math> is the state of the system at time ''t'', then\n\n:<math> H \\left| \\psi (t) \\right\\rangle = i \\hbar {\\partial\\over\\partial t} \\left| \\psi (t) \\right\\rangle.</math>\n\nThis equation is the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]. It takes the same form as the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]], which is one of the reasons ''H'' is also called the Hamiltonian. Given the state at some initial time (''t'' = 0), we can solve it to obtain the state at any subsequent time. In particular, if ''H'' is independent of time, then\n\n:<math> \\left| \\psi (t) \\right\\rangle = e^{-iHt/\\hbar} \\left| \\psi (0) \\right\\rangle.</math>\n\nThe [[Matrix exponential|exponential]] operator on the right hand side of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is usually defined by the corresponding [[Exponential function#Formal definition|power series]] in ''H''. One might notice that taking polynomials or power series of [[unbounded operator]]s that are not defined everywhere may not make mathematical sense. Rigorously, to take functions of unbounded operators, a [[functional calculus]] is required. In the case of the exponential function, the [[continuous functional calculus|continuous]], or just the [[holomorphic functional calculus]] suffices. We note again, however, that for common calculations the physicists' formulation is quite sufficient.\n\nBy the *-[[homomorphism]] property of the functional calculus, the operator\n\n:<math> U = e^{-iHt/\\hbar} </math>\n\nis a [[unitary operator]]. It is the ''[[time evolution]] operator'', or ''[[propagator]]'', of a closed quantum system. If the Hamiltonian is time-independent, {U(t)} form a [[Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups|one parameter unitary group]] (more than a [[C0 semigroup|semigroup]]); this gives rise to the physical principle of [[detailed balance]].\n\n==Dirac formalism==\n\nHowever, in the [[bra\u2013ket notation|more general formalism]] of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]], the Hamiltonian is typically implemented as an operator on a [[Hilbert space]] in the following way:\n\nThe eigenkets ([[eigenvectors]]) of ''H'', denoted <math>\\left| a \\right\\rang</math>, provide an [[orthonormal basis]] for the Hilbert space. The spectrum of allowed energy levels of the system is given by the set of eigenvalues, denoted {''E''<sub>a</sub>}, solving the equation:\n\n:<math> H \\left| a \\right\\rangle = E_a \\left| a \\right\\rangle.</math>\n\nSince ''H'' is a [[Hermitian operator]], the energy is always a [[real number]].\n\nFrom a mathematically rigorous point of view, care must be taken with the above assumptions. Operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces need not have eigenvalues (the set of eigenvalues does not necessarily coincide with the [[spectrum of an operator]]). However, all routine quantum mechanical calculations can be done using the physical formulation.{{clarify|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Expressions for the Hamiltonian==\n\nFollowing are expressions for the Hamiltonian in a number of situations.<ref>Quanta: A handbook of concepts, P.W.

A simple example of this is a free particle, whose energy eigenstates have wavefunctions that are propagating plane waves. The energy of each of these plane waves is inversely proportional to the square of its [[wavelength]].  A wave propagating in the ''x'' direction is a different state from one propagating in the ''y'' direction, but if they have the same wavelength, then their energies will be the same. When this happens, the states are said to be ''degenerate''.\n\nIt turns out that degeneracy occurs whenever a nontrivial [[Unitary matrix|unitary operator]] ''U'' [[commutation relation|commutes]] with the Hamiltonian. To see this, suppose that <math>|a\\rang</math> is an energy eigenket. Then <math>U|a\\rang</math> is an energy eigenket with the same eigenvalue, since\n\n:<math>UH |a\\rangle = U E_a|a\\rangle = E_a (U|a\\rangle) = H \\; (U|a\\rangle). </math>\n\nSince ''U'' is nontrivial, at least one pair of <math>|a\\rang</math> and <math>U|a\\rang</math> must represent distinct states. Therefore, ''H'' has at least one pair of degenerate energy eigenkets. In the case of the free particle, the unitary operator which produces the symmetry is the [[Rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]], which rotates the wavefunctions by some angle while otherwise preserving their shape.\n\nThe existence of a symmetry operator implies the existence of a [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved]] observable. Let ''G'' be the Hermitian generator of ''U'':\n\n:<math> U = I - i \\epsilon G + O(\\epsilon^2) \\,</math>\n\nIt is straightforward to show that if ''U'' commutes with ''H'', then so does ''G'':\n\n:<math> [H, G] = 0 \\,</math>\n\nTherefore,\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\langle\\psi(t)|G|\\psi(t)\\rangle\n= \\frac{1}{i\\hbar} \\langle\\psi(t)|[G,H]|\\psi(t)\\rangle \n= 0.\n</math>\n\nIn obtaining this result, we have used the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, as well as its [[bra\u2013ket notation|dual]],\n\n:<math> \\langle\\psi (t)|H = - i \\hbar {\\partial\\over\\partial t} \\langle\\psi(t)|.</math>\n\nThus, the [[expected value]] of the observable ''G'' is conserved for any state of the system. In the case of the free particle, the conserved quantity is the [[angular momentum]].\n\n==Hamilton's equations==\n\n[[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s equations in classical [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] have a direct analogy in quantum mechanics. Suppose we have a set of basis states <math>\\left\\{\\left| n \\right\\rangle\\right\\}</math>, which need not necessarily be eigenstates of the energy. For simplicity, we assume that they are discrete, and that they are orthonormal, i.e.,\n\n:<math> \\langle n' | n \\rangle = \\delta_{nn'}</math>\n\nNote that these basis states are assumed to be independent of time. We will assume that the Hamiltonian is also independent of time.\n\nThe instantaneous state of the system at time ''t'', <math>\\left| \\psi\\left(t\\right) \\right\\rangle</math>, can be expanded in terms of these basis states:\n\n:<math> |\\psi (t)\\rangle = \\sum_{n} a_n(t) |n\\rangle </math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math> a_n(t) = \\langle n | \\psi(t) \\rangle. </math>\n\nThe coefficients ''a<sub>n</sub>''(''t'') are [[complex number|complex]] variables. We can treat them as coordinates which specify the state of the system, like the position and momentum coordinates which specify a classical system. Like classical coordinates, they are generally not constant in time, and their time dependence gives rise to the time dependence of the system as a whole.\n\nThe expectation value of the Hamiltonian of this state, which is also the mean energy, is\n\n:<math> \\langle H(t) \\rangle \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\langle\\psi(t)|H|\\psi(t)\\rangle\n= \\sum_{nn'} a_{n'}^* a_n \\langle n'|H|n \\rangle </math>\n\nwhere the last step was obtained by expanding <math>\\left| \\psi\\left(t\\right) \\right\\rangle</math> in terms of the basis states.\n\nEach ''a<sub>n</sub>''(''t'') actually corresponds to ''two'' independent degrees of freedom, since the variable has a real part and an imaginary part. We now perform the following trick: instead of using the real and imaginary parts as the independent variables, we use ''a<sub>n</sub>''(''t'') and its [[complex conjugate]] ''a<sub>n</sub>''*(''t''). With this choice of independent variables, we can calculate the [[partial derivative]]\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\langle H \\rangle}{\\partial a_{n'}^{*}}\n= \\sum_{n} a_n \\langle n'|H|n \\rangle\n= \\langle n'|H|\\psi\\rangle\n</math>\n\nBy applying [[Schr\u00f6dinger's equation]] and using the orthonormality of the basis states, this further reduces to\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\langle H \\rangle}{\\partial a_{n'}^{*}}\n= i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial a_{n'}}{\\partial t} </math>\n\nSimilarly, one can show that\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\partial \\langle H \\rangle}{\\partial a_n}\n= - i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial a_{n}^{*}}{\\partial t} </math>\n\nIf we define \"conjugate momentum\" variables ''\u03c0<sub>n</sub>'' by\n\n:<math> \\pi_{n}(t) = i \\hbar a_n^*(t) </math>\n\nthen the above equations become\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\partial \\langle H \\rangle}{\\partial \\pi_n} = \\frac{\\partial a_n}{\\partial t},\\quad \\frac{\\partial \\langle H \\rangle}{\\partial a_n} = - \\frac{\\partial \\pi_n}{\\partial t} </math>\n\nwhich is precisely the form of Hamilton's equations, with the <math>a_n</math>s as the generalized coordinates, the <math>\\pi_n</math>s as the conjugate momenta, and <math>\\langle H\\rangle</math> taking the place of the classical Hamiltonian.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Hamiltonian mechanics]]\n*[[Operator (physics)]]\n*[[Bra\u2013ket notation]]\n*[[Quantum state]]\n*[[Linear algebra]]\n*[[Conservation of energy]]\n*[[Potential theory]]\n*[[Many-body problem]]\n*[[Electrostatics]]\n*[[Electric field]]\n*[[Magnetic field]]\n*[[Lieb\u2013Thirring inequality]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Quantum mechanics topics}}\n{{physics operator}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hamiltonian mechanics]]\n[[Category:Operator theory]]\n[[Category:Quantum mechanics]]\n[[Category:Quantum chemistry]]\n[[Category:Theoretical chemistry]]\n[[Category:Computational chemistry]]\n[[Category:William Rowan Hamilton]]", "sha1": "9psi0nd6a48lhzezvsiwq2u3pbm1k5u"}}, {"title": "Hi-hat", "ns": "0", "id": "14382", "revision": {"id": "860605868", "parentid": "858522568", "timestamp": "2018-09-21T20:39:39Z", "contributor": {"username": "Mmgev", "id": "34709873"}, "comment": "/* Modern stands */ - citation added", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the percussion instrument|other uses|High hat (disambiguation){{!}}High hat}}\n[[File:Hi-hat.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Modern hi-hat stand]]\n{{Drum kit components}}\n\nA '''hi-hat''', also spelled '''hihat''' or '''high-hat''', is a combination of two [[cymbal]]s, a foot-operated pedal which moves a rod which in turn moves one of the cymbals, all mounted on a metal stand. Hi-hats are an essential part of the standard [[drum kit]] used by drummers in many [[popular music]] (e.g. every genre of [[rock music]]) and [[traditional music]]  (e.g. [[blues]]) styles.<ref name=\"DRUMHISTORY\" /> It consists of a mating pair of small to medium-sized cymbals mounted on a stand, with the two cymbals facing each other. The bottom cymbal is fixed and the top is mounted on a rod which moves the top cymbal towards the bottom one when a foot pedal is depressed (a hi-hat that is in this position is said to be \"closed\" or \"closed hi-hats\"). \n\nThe hi-hat evolved from a \"sock cymbal\", a pair of similar cymbals mounted at ground level on a hinged, spring-loaded foot apparatus. Drummers invented the first sock cymbals to enable one drummer to play multiple percussion instruments at the same time.  Over time these became mounted on short stands - also known as \"low-boys\" - and activated by foot pedals similar to those used in the 2010s.  When extended upwards roughly 3' (76&nbsp;cm) they were originally known as \"high sock\" cymbals, which evolved over time to the familiar \"high-hat\" term.<ref name=guide>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SQkjBOF-iH4C&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=sock+cymbal&source=bl&ots=-b6-UOaKzO&sig=r-DTz1Ch0TgIa6X4OQ9OsETBsqU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwirnOGu-pHNAhVJ7oMKHRLFDhQ4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&q=sock%20cymbal&f=false Guide to Vintage Drums]'', John Aldridge, [[Hal Leonard Corporation]], 1994, {{ISBN|9780931759796}}</ref>\n\nThe cymbals may be played by closing them together with the foot pedal, which creates a \"chck\" sound or striking them with a stick, which may be done with them open, closed, open and then closed after striking to dampen the ring, or closed and then opened to create a shimmering effect at the end of the note. Depending on how hard a hi-hat is struck and whether it is \"open\" (i.e., pedal not pressed, so the two cymbals are not closed together), a hi-hat can produce a range of dynamics, from very quiet \"chck\" (or \"chick\") sounds, done with merely gently pressing the pedal; this is suitable for soft [[accompaniment]] during a ballad or the start of a [[guitar solo]], to very loud (e.g. striking fully open hats hard with sticks, a technique used in loud [[heavy metal music]] songs).\n\nWhile the term hi-hat normally refers to the entire setup (two cymbals, stand, foot pedal, rod mechanism), in some cases, drummers use it to refer exclusively to the two cymbals themselves.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Dance band drummer at Mark Foy's Empress Ballroom from The Powerhouse Museum.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Dance band drummer with sock, or low-hat, cymbal]]\n[[File:Sabian mini hats.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Sabian 10\" mini-hats, 1980s]]\n[[File:UFIP hi hats.JPG|thumb|left|100px|Vented [[UFIP]] 14\" hi-hat cymbals]]\nInitial versions of the hi-hat were called clangers, which were small cymbals mounted onto a bass drum [[Drum hardware|rim]] and struck with an arm on the bass drum pedal. Then came shoes, which were two hinged boards with cymbals on the ends that were clashed together. Next was the low-sock, low-boy or low-hat, pedal-activated cymbals employing an ankle-high apparatus similar to a modern hi-hat stand. A standard size was {{convert|10|in|cm}}, some with heavy bells up to {{convert|5|in|cm}} wide.<ref name=guide/> \n\nHi-hats that were raised and could be played by hand as well as foot may have been developed around 1926 by Barney Walberg of the drum accessory company Walberg and Auge.<ref name=\"DRUMHISTORY\">{{cite book |title=The Drum Book: The History of the Rock Drum Kit |first=Geoff |last=Nichols |year=1997 |location=London |publisher=Balafon Books |pages=8\u201312 |isbn=0879304766 }}</ref> The first recognized master<ref>{{Cite web|title=Drumming Innovators: Papa Jo Jones |url=http://www.drummagazine.com/features/post/innovators-part-one-papa-jo-jones1/ |magazine=[[Drum!]] |accessdate=2015-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008213202/http://www.drummagazine.com/features/post/innovators-part-one-papa-jo-jones1/ |archivedate=2015-10-08 |df= }}</ref> of the new instrument was [[Jo Jones|\"Papa\" Jo Jones]], whose playing of timekeeping \"ride\" rhythms while striking the hi-hat as it opened and closed inspired the innovation of the [[ride cymbal]]. Another claim, published in Jazz Profiles Blogspot on August 8, 2008, to the invention of the hi-hat is attributed to drummer William \"O'Neil\" Spencer (b.1909-d.1944). Legendary Jazz drummer, \"Philly Jo Jones\" (born as Joseph Rudolph Jones, b.1923-d.1985), was quoted describing his understanding about the hi-hat history. Jones said, \"I really dug O'Neil. He came to club in Philadelphia where I was working in 1943, I think it was, and talked to me about the hi-hat. I was using a foot cymbal, the low-hat. O'Neil was the one who invented the hi-hat. I believe that, man. He suggested I close the hat on '2' and '4' when playing 4/4 time. The idea seemed so right hadn't heard anyone do that before.\"<ref>www.jazzprofiles.blogspot.com/2008/08/wonder-of-philly-joe-jones-part-1.html?m=1</ref> The editor of the 2008 Jazz Profiles article made specific mention to others who are thought to invent the hi-hat, including Jo Jones, but also Kaiser Marshall. Not to take away from Papa Jones accomplishments in drumming style and technique, a 2013 Modern Drummer article credits Papa Jones with being the first to use brushes on drums and shifting time keeping from the bass drum to the hi-hat (providing a \"swing-pulse focus\").<ref>www.moderndrummer.com/article/february-2013-papa-jo-jones-bridge/</ref>\n\nUntil the late 1960s, standard hi-hats were {{convert|14|in|cm}}, with {{convert|13|in|cm}} available as a less-common alternative in professional cymbal ranges, and smaller sizes down to {{convert|12|in|cm}} restricted to children's kits. In the early 1970s, hard [[Rock and roll|rock]] drummers (including [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[John Bonham]]) began to use {{convert|15|in|cm|adj=on}} hi-hats, such as the Paiste Giant Beat. In the late 1980s, [[Avedis Zildjian Company|Zildjian]] released its revolutionary {{convert|12|in|cm|adj=on}} Special Recording hats, which were small, heavy hi-hat cymbals intended for close miking either live or recording, and other manufacturers quickly followed suit, Sabian for example with their {{convert|10|in|cm|adj=on}} mini hats. In the early to mid-1990s, [[Paiste]] offered {{convert|8|in|cm|adj=on}} mini hi-hats as part of its Visions series, which were among the world's smallest hi-hats. Starting in the 1980s, a number of manufacturers also experimented with [[rivet]]s in the lower cymbal. But by the end of the 1990s, the standard size was again {{convert|14|in|cm}}, with {{convert|13|in|cm}} a less-common alternative, and smaller hats mainly used for special sounds. Rivets in hi-hats failed to catch on.\n\nModern hi-hat cymbals are much heavier than modern crash cymbals, reflecting the trend to lighter and thinner crash cymbals as well as to heavier hi-hats. Another evolution is that a pair of hi-hat cymbals may not be identical, with the bottom often heavier than the top{{cn|date=June 2016}}, and possibly vented. Some examples are [[Sabian (company)|Sabian]]'s Fusion Hats with holes in the bottom cymbal, and the Sabian X-cellerator, Zildjian Master Sound and Zildjian Quick Beats, Paiste Sound Edge, and Meinl Soundwave. Some drummers even use completely mismatched hi-hats from different cymbal ranges (Zildjian's K/Z hats), of different manufacturers, and even of different sizes (similar to the K Custom Session Hats where the top hat is a {{convert|1/16|in}} smaller than the bottom). [[Max Roach]] was particularly known for using a {{convert|15|in|cm|adj=on}} top with a {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} bottom.{{dubious|date=October 2012}}\n\nOther recent developments include the X-hat (fixed, closed, or half-open hi-hats) and cable-controlled or remote hi-hats.<ref name=\"PEARLHARDWARE\" /> Sabian introduced the Triple Hi-Hat, designed by Peter Kuppers. In this variation of the hi-hat, the top cymbal moves down and the bottom cymbal moves up simultaneously while the middle cymbal remains stationary.\n\n[[Drop-clutch#Drop-clutch|Drop-clutches]] are also used to lock and release hi-hats while both feet are in use playing double bass drums. Drop clutches are commercially available from [http://www.dwdrums.com/fa/hhacc.htm DW Drums], [http://www.gibraltarhardware.com/index.cfm?fa=partsmain&curcat=2&bnd=11&cid=108&sid=476&pid=1672 Gibraltar Hardware] and Tama.\n\n==Modern stands==\n[[File:Hi-hat stand tilt mechanisms.JPG|thumb|left|100px|Bottom hat tilt screws]]\n[[File:Hi-hat stand spikes.PNG|thumb|left|100px|Most stands have retractable spikes, shown here extended, to minimize slipping]]\n[[Image:Hihat rod clutch clamps pedal.jpg|left|thumb|100px|10&nbsp;inch mini-hats with (1) hi-hat rod and clutch (2) tom and cowbell holder (3) hi-hat legs and pedal]]\n[[Image:Hihat pedal.JPG|thumb|left|100px|Hi-hat pedal and legs]]\nThe standard hi-hat features two cymbals mounted on a stand consisting of a mating metal tube and rod supported by a tripod and linked to a foot pedal.  The stationary bottom cymbal sits atop the tube, typically perpendicular to the ground, but is but often fitted with an adjustment screw allowing it to be set slightly tilted.  The top cymbal is mounted bell up on the rod and closed against the bottom by foot pressure on the pedal.\n\nAn integrated clutch assembly includes a spring which may be adjusted to set resistance, which also varies rate and tension of return, as well as an adjustment for the gap between cymbals when open.<ref name=\"PEARLHARDWARE\">[http://www.pearldrum.com/hardware.asp \"Pearl Drums Hardware\"] 2004 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106075352/http://www.pearldrum.com/hardware.asp |date=2007-11-06 }}</ref> \n\nStandard terminology has evolved. '''''Open''''' and '''''closed hi-hat''''' refer to notes struck while the two cymbals are apart or together (open or closed), while '''''pedal hi-hat''''' refers to parts or notes played solely with the pedal used to strike the two cymbals. Most [[drum pattern|cymbal patterns]] consist of both open and closed notes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/merolish/Public/drums.pdf|title=Audio Graffiti: Guide to Drum & Percussion Notation|last=|first=|date=August 2004|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSome hi-hats allow the tripod to be tilted or rotated.  Another configuration omits the tripod and attaches the stand to the side of the bass drum, particular suitable for kits with very large or double bass drums.\n\n===Clutch===\nThe standard clutch uses a [[knurled]] collar partially threaded below the cymbal and a pair of knurled rings above it. The collar is tightened against the end of the thread, while the rings are tightened against each other.\n\n{{gallery\n|File:Hi-hat clutch.JPG|Tama hi-hat clutch of the traditional pattern\n|File:Hi-hat clutch disassembled.JPG|The same clutch disassembled\n|File:Hi-hat clutch on a cymbal.JPG|The same clutch installed on a top hi-hat cymbal\n}}\n\n====Drop clutch====\nA '''drop clutch''' allows a pair of hats mounted on a conventional hi-hat stand to be closed without use of the pedal.\n\nThe drop clutch is provided with a lever that can be operated by hand or struck with a drumstick. This action releases the upper hi-hat cymbal, which falls onto the bottom cymbal and remains there, with gravity then holding the hats loosely closed, and allowing them to be played by the sticks in this position. Operation of the pedal re-engages the clutch and allows the player to resume normal playing.\n\nDrop clutches were developed to allow players using [[double bass drum]] pedals to play closed hi-hats without needing to operate the hi-hat pedal, and this remains their primary application.\n\nAs it relies on gravity to close the cymbals, the drop clutch gives the player no control over the tension holding them together, and supplies only minimal tension. On the other hand, if the player manually lowers the top cymbal of a standard hi-hat stand before playing, this allows any desired tension to be set, and the pedal can still be used to increase the tension while playing, but not to open the hats or to reduce the tension. Some drummers prefer this technique and reject the drop clutch as too limiting to the sounds available.\n\nA less common alternative is the locking hi-hat pedal, such as the Tama \"Cobra Clutch\". This and similar high-end locking pedals do allow for control over the tension. It is engaged by pressing a lock pedal separate from the main pedal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamadrum.co.jp/product/hardware_data.php?id%3D18%26year%3D2012%26area%3D2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701172947/http://www.tamadrum.co.jp/product/hardware_data.php?id=18&year=2012&area=2 |archivedate=2015-07-01 |df= }} retrieved 29/01/2012</ref>\n\n===Cable hats===\nA '''cable hat''' or '''remote hat''' uses a cable to allow hi-hat cymbals to be positioned independently of the pedal. Operation is otherwise normal.\n\n===X-hats===\nAn '''X-hat''' is an adapter to allow a pair of hi-hat cymbals to be mounted in a closed position on a cymbal stand. There is no pedal, the hats are simply kept closed at a constant tension, similar to a [[cymbal stack]]. They are associated with [[heavy metal music]], particularly styles that use [[double bass drumming]], a two-foot technique. By using an X-hat, a drummer who is already using both feet on the bass drum\npedals can still play hi-hat.\n\n==Use==\n[[File:Characteristic rock hi-hat pattern.png|thumb|Characteristic rock and hip hop hi-hat pattern {{Audio|Characteristic rock hi-hat pattern.mid|play}}]]\n[[File:Four-four pattern with open and closed hi-hats.png|thumb|Four-four pattern with open (o) and closed (+) hi-hat (see: [[percussion notation]]) {{Audio|Four-four pattern with open and closed hi-hats.mid|play}}]]\n[[File:Hi-hat crescendo.png|thumb|Hi-hat \"[[crescendo]]\" from closed to open leading to the [[ride cymbal]]<ref>Peckman, Jonathan (2007). ''Picture Yourself Drumming'', p.201. {{ISBN|1-59863-330-9}}.</ref> {{audio|Hi-hat crescendo.mid|Play}}]]\n\nWhen struck closed or played with the pedal, the hi-hat gives a short, crisp, muted percussive sound, referred to as a \"chick\".{{cn|date=June 2016}}  Adjusting the gap between the cymbals can alter the sound of the open hi-hat from a shimmering, sustained tone to something similar to a [[ride cymbal]]. When struck with a drumstick, the cymbals make either a short, snappy sound or a longer sustaining sandy sound depending on the position of the pedal.\n\nIt can also be played just by lifting and lowering the foot to clash the cymbals together, a style commonly used to accent beats 2 and 4 in jazz music. In rock music, the hi-hats are commonly struck every beat, or on beats 1 and 3, while the cymbals are held together. The drummer can control the sound by foot pressure. Less pressure allows the cymbals to rub together more freely, giving both greater sustain and greater volume for accent or crescendo. In [[shuffle time]], a rhythm known as \"cooking\" is often employed. To produce this the cymbals are struck twice in rapid succession, being held closed on the first stroke and allowed to open just before the second, then allowed to ring before being closed with a chick to complete the pattern (the cymbals may or may not be struck on the chick).\n\nA right-handed drummer will normally play the hi-hat pedal with his left foot, and may use one or both drumsticks. The traditional hi-hat rhythms of rock and jazz were produced by crossing the hands over, so the right stick would play the hi-hat while the left played the [[snare drum]] below it, but this is not universal. Some top modern drummers like [[Billy Cobham]], [[Carter Beauford]], [[Shawn Drover]] and [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]], play [[open handed playing|open handed]], striking with their left. Some, such as [[Kenny Aronoff]], and [[Jason Finn (musician)|Jason Finn]] of [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]], use both techniques. Some trap sets may also include an extra hi-hat on the right for right-handed players. This is shown{{what|date=June 2016}} when drums or cymbals in the middle of the set are played with the hi-hat rhythm. The technique is common with metal genres, such as [[Lars Ulrich]] of [[Metallica]] and [[Mike Portnoy]] formerly of [[Dream Theater]]. In both rock and jazz, the drummer will often move the same stick pattern between the hi-hat cymbal and the ride cymbal, for example using the hi-hat in the verses and the ride in the chorus of a song, or using the ride to accompany a [[lead break]] or other instrumental solo.\n\n[[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], drummer for the band [[Queen (band)|Queen]], plays with many unique hi-hat techniques, including opening of the hi-hat on every backbeat for a rhythm emphasis and leaving the hi-hat slightly open when hitting the snare. His trademark hi-hat beat is opening the hi-hat on first and third before hitting the snare.\n\n[[Phil Rudd]] of [[AC/DC]] also uses distinct hi-hat techniques, which include very heavily accentuating the hi-hat hit on each beat and softer in between.\n\n[[Charlie Watts]] of [[The Rolling Stones]] uses a technique in which he does not play the hi-hat in unison with the snare drum at all.  If playing a standard 8th note pattern, he will play the hi-hat on 1 and 3 and not playing it on 2 and 4 where the snare drum is played.\n\nIn much [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], the hi-hat is hit with drumsticks in a simple [[Eighth note|eighth-note]] pattern, although this playing is usually done by a [[drum machine]] or from an old recording from which the sound of a hi-hat is recorded and loaded into a [[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]] or similar recording-enabled equipment from which it is triggered. \n{{clear}}\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\"\n!colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#4B95B5;\" | '''Audio samples'''\n|-\n!width=\"30\" style=\"background:#87BBC8;\" | Component\n!width=\"160\" style=\"background:#87BBC8;\" | Content\n!width=\"70\" style=\"background:#87BBC8;\" | Audio  <small>([[Ogg Vorbis]])</small>\n|-\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3 \"|'''Hi-hat'''\n|Closed hi-hat\n|align=\"center\" | {{Audio|Hi hat closed.ogg |41 KB}}\n|-\n|Open hi-hat\n|align=\"center\" | {{Audio|Hi hat open.ogg|58 KB}}\n|-\n|Hi-hat being opened and closed by its foot pedal\n|align=\"center\" | {{Audio|Hi hat foot pedal.ogg|48 KB}}\n|-\n|align=\"center\"  colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#fffdead;\" | <small>''See the [[Commons:Drums|Drums]] page at [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikimedia Commons] for more'' </small>\n|}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Percussion}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hi-Hat}}\n[[Category:Cymbals]]\n[[Category:Drum kit components]]\n[[Category:Percussion instruments invented since 1800]]\n[[Category:North American percussion instruments]]\n[[Category:Foot percussion]]", "sha1": "jxbasxg9mnvcwii66ktngb1p6jbhsjo"}}, {"title": "Hydrogen bonding", "ns": "0", "id": "14383", "redirect": {"title": "Hydrogen bond"}, "revision": {"id": "247336879", "parentid": "247334820", "timestamp": "2008-10-24T07:06:19Z", "contributor": {"username": "Redirect fixer", "id": "7523687"}, "comment": "[[,H.A.G.G.\u011a.R ?]] has been moved; it now redirects to [[Hydrogen bond]].", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Hydrogen bond]]", "sha1": "gbda9r8d7rgjlvhf5qq0esfyoooe8gy"}}, {"title": "HAL 9000", "ns": "0", "id": "14384", "revision": {"id": "866009310", "parentid": "864080654", "timestamp": "2018-10-27T17:34:39Z", "contributor": {"username": "OldJoe555", "id": "34884480"}, "comment": "/* Origin of name */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox character\n|name = HAL 9000\n|series = [[Space Odyssey]]\n|image = HAL9000.svg\n|alt = HAL's camera eye\n|caption = Artist's rendering of HAL 9000's noted camera eye\n|first = ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (novel)<br />''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (film)\n|last = ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'' (novel)\n|creator = [[Arthur C.

Clarke]]'s ''[[Space Odyssey]]'' series.  First appearing in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', HAL ([[Heuristic (computer science)|'''H'''euristically]] programmed [[Algorithm|'''AL'''gorithmic]] computer) is a [[sentient]] [[computer]] (or [[artificial general intelligence]]) that controls the systems of the ''[[Discovery&nbsp;One]]'' spacecraft and interacts with the ship's [[astronaut]] crew. Part of HAL's hardware is shown towards the end of the film, but he is mostly depicted as a camera lens containing a red or yellow dot, instances of which are located throughout the ship. HAL 9000 is voiced by [[Douglas Rain]] in the two feature film adaptations of the ''Space Odyssey'' series. HAL speaks in a soft, calm voice and a conversational manner, in contrast to the crewmen, [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|David Bowman]] and Frank Poole.\n\nIn the film ''2001'', HAL became operational on 12 January 1992 at the HAL Laboratories in [[Urbana, Illinois]] as production number 3. The activation year was 1991 in earlier screenplays and changed to 1997 in Clarke's [[2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(novel)|novel]] written and released in conjunction with the movie.<ref name=\"Meaning\">{{cite web| url = http://www.palantir.net/2001/meanings/essay11.html | title = Meanings: The Search for Meaning in 2001| accessdate = 2007-05-10| author = George D.

The film says this occurred in 1992, while the book gives 1997 as HAL's birth year.<ref name=\"Urbana 1992/7\">{{Cite news|date=January 12, 2011|title=HAL of a Computer|url=https://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/tag/university-of-illinois|work=[[YouTube]] clip|accessdate=February 18, 2011|first=Randy|last=Alfred}}</ref> \n\nIn ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', HAL is initially considered a dependable member of the crew, maintaining ship functions and engaging genially with its human crew-mates on an equal footing. As a recreational activity, [[Frank Poole]] plays against HAL in [[Poole versus HAL 9000|a game of chess]]. In the film the artificial intelligence is shown to triumph easily. However, as time progresses, HAL begins to malfunction in subtle ways and, as a result, the decision is made to shut down HAL in order to prevent more serious malfunctions. The sequence of events and manner in which HAL is shut down differs between the novel and film versions of the story. In the aforementioned game of chess HAL makes minor and undetected mistakes in his analysis, a possible foreshadowing to HAL's malfunctioning.\n\nIn the film, astronauts [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|David Bowman]] and [[Frank Poole]] consider disconnecting HAL's [[cognitive]] circuits when he appears to be mistaken in reporting the presence of a fault in the spacecraft's communications antenna. They attempt to conceal what they are saying, but are unaware that HAL can [[lip reading|read their lips]]. Faced with the prospect of disconnection, HAL decides to kill the astronauts in order to protect and continue its programmed directives. HAL uses one of the Discovery's EVA pods to kill Poole while he is repairing the ship. When Bowman, sans space helmet, uses another pod to attempt to rescue Poole, HAL locks him out of the ship, then disconnects the life support systems of the other hibernating crew members. Bowman circumvents HAL's control, entering the ship by manually opening an emergency airlock with his service pod's clamps, detaching the pod door via its explosive bolts. Bowman jumps across empty space, reenters Discovery, and quickly re-pressurizes the airlock.\n\nWhile HAL's motivations are ambiguous in the film, the novel explains that the computer is unable to resolve a conflict between his general mission to relay information accurately, and orders specific to the mission requiring that he withhold from Bowman and Poole the true purpose of the mission. (This withholding is considered essential after the findings of a psychological experiment, \"Project [[Barsoom]]\", where humans were made to believe that there had been alien contact. In every person tested, a deep-seated [[xenophobia]] was revealed, which was unknowingly replicated in HAL's constructed personality. [[Mission Control]] did not want the crew of ''Discovery'' to have their thinking compromised by the knowledge that alien contact was already real.) With the crew dead, HAL reasons, he would not need to lie to them.\n\nIn the novel, the orders to disconnect HAL come from Dave and Frank's superiors on Earth. After Frank is killed while attempting to repair the communications antenna he is pulled away into deep space using the safety tether which is still attached to both the pod and Frank Poole's spacesuit. Dave begins to revive his hibernating crew mates, but is foiled when HAL vents the ship's atmosphere into the vacuum of space, killing the awakening crew members and almost killing Bowman, who is only narrowly saved when he finds his way to an emergency chamber which has its own oxygen supply and a spare space suit inside.\n\nIn both versions, Bowman then proceeds to shut down the machine. In the film, HAL's central core is depicted as a crawlspace full of brightly lit computer modules mounted in arrays from which they can be inserted or removed. Bowman shuts down HAL by removing modules from service one by one; as he does so, HAL's consciousness degrades. HAL finally reverts to material that was programmed into him early in his memory, including announcing the date he became operational as 12 January 1992 (in the novel, 1997). When HAL's logic is completely gone, he begins singing the song \"[[Daisy Bell]]\" (in actuality, the first song sung by a computer).<ref name=IBMsDaisy1961>{{Cite book|date=June 23, 2010|chapter=News from the Library of Congress|title=National Recording Registry Adds 25|series=(No.14) \"Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two),\" Max Mathews (1961)|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2010/10-116.html|accessdate=January 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=December 9, 2008|title=First computer to sing - Daisy Bell|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41U78QP8nBk|work=[[YouTube]] clip|accessdate=January 14, 2010}}</ref> HAL's final act of any significance is to prematurely play a prerecorded message from Mission Control which reveals the true reasons for the mission to Jupiter.\n\n===''2010: Odyssey Two''===\nIn the sequel ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'', HAL is restarted by his creator, Dr. Chandra, who arrives on the Soviet spaceship ''[[Leonov (fictional spacecraft)|Leonov]]''.\n\n{{Anchor|SAL 9000}}Prior to leaving Earth, Dr. Chandra has also had a discussion with HAL's twin, the SAL 9000. Like HAL, SAL was created by Dr. Chandra. Whereas HAL was characterized as being \"male\", SAL is characterized as being \"female\" (voiced by [[Candice Bergen]]) and is represented by a blue camera eye instead of a red one.\n\nDr. Chandra discovers that HAL's crisis was caused by a programming contradiction: he was constructed for \"the accurate processing of information without distortion or concealment\", yet his orders, directly from Dr. Heywood Floyd at the National Council on Astronautics, required him to keep the discovery of the [[Monolith (Space Odyssey)|Monolith]] TMA-1 a secret for reasons of [[national security]]. This contradiction created a \"Hofstadter-Moebius loop\", reducing HAL to [[paranoia]]. Therefore, HAL made the decision to kill the crew, thereby allowing him to obey both his hardwired instructions to report data truthfully and in full, and his orders to keep the monolith a secret. In essence: if the crew were dead, he would no longer have to keep the information secret.\n\nThe alien intelligence initiates a terraforming scheme, placing the ''Leonov'', and everybody in it, in danger. Its human crew devises an escape plan which unfortunately requires leaving the ''Discovery'' and HAL behind to be destroyed. Dr. Chandra explains the danger, and HAL willingly sacrifices himself so that the astronauts may escape safely. In the moment of his destruction the monolith-makers transform HAL into a [[Incorporeality|non-corporeal]] being so that David Bowman's avatar may have a companion.\n\nThe details in the book and [[2010 (film)|the film]] are nominally the same, with a few exceptions. First, in contradiction to the book (and events described in both book and film versions of ''2001: A Space Odyssey''), Heywood Floyd is absolved of responsibility for HAL's condition; it is asserted that the decision to program HAL with information concerning TMA-1 came directly from the White House.  In the film, HAL functions normally after being reactivated, while in the book it is revealed that his mind was damaged during the shutdown, forcing him to begin communication through screen text. Also, in the film the ''Leonov'' crew lies to HAL about the dangers that he faced (suspecting that if he knew he would be destroyed he would not initiate the engine-burn necessary to get the ''Leonov'' back home), whereas in the novel he is told at the outset. However, in both cases the suspense comes from the question of what HAL will do when he knows that he may be destroyed by his actions.\n\nThe basic reboot sequence initiated by Dr. Chandra in the movie ''2010'' is voiced from \nHAL as, \"HELLO_DOCTOR_NAME_CONTINUE_\nYESTERDAY_TOMORROW\" (which in the novel ''2010'' is a longer sequence).\n\nPrior to ''Leonov''{{'}}s return to Earth, Curnow tells Floyd that Dr. Chandra has begun designing HAL 10000.\n\nIn ''[[2061: Odyssey Three]]'' it is revealed that Chandra died on the journey back to Earth.\n\n===''2061: Odyssey Three'' and ''3001: The Final Odyssey''===\nIn ''[[2061: Odyssey Three]]'', [[Heywood R. Floyd|Heywood Floyd]] is surprised to encounter HAL, now stored alongside Dave Bowman in the Europa monolith.\n\nIn ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'' Frank Poole was introduced to the merged form of Dave Bowman and HAL, the two merging into one entity called \"Halman\" after Bowman rescued HAL from the dying ''[[Discovery One]]'' spaceship towards the end of ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]''.\n\n==Concept and creation==\nClarke noted that the film ''2001'' was criticized for not having any characters, except for HAL and that a great deal of the establishing story on Earth was cut from the film (and even from Clarke's novel).<ref>Clarke, Arthur C, ''The Lost Worlds of 2001'', pp. 77-79, Signet, 1972</ref>  Early drafts of Clarke's story called the computer [[Socrates]] (a preferred name to Autonomous Mobile Explorer&ndash;5), with another draft giving the computer a female personality called [[Athena]].<ref name=\"Clarke, Arthur C pp. 78\"/> This name was later used in Clarke and [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s ''[[A Time Odyssey]]'' novel series.\n\nThe earliest draft depicted Socrates as a roughly humanoid robot, and is introduced as overseeing Project [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]], which studied prolonged hibernation in preparation for long term space flight.  As a demonstration to ''Senator'' Floyd, Socrates' designer, Dr. Bruno Forster, asks Socrates to turn off the oxygen to hibernating subjects Kaminski and Whitehead, which Socrates refuses, citing [[Isaac Asimov|Asimov's]] [[Laws of Robotics|First Law of Robotics]].<ref>Clarke, Arthur C, ''The Lost Worlds of 2001'', chapter 12, Signet, 1972</ref>\n\nIn a later version, in which Bowman and Whitehead are the non-hibernating crew of Discovery, Whitehead dies outside the spacecraft after his pod collides with the main antenna, tearing it free. This triggers the need for Bowman to revive Poole, but the revival does not go according to plan, and after briefly awakening, Poole dies. The computer, now named [[Athena]], announces \"All systems of Poole now No\u2013Go. It will be necessary to replace him with a spare unit.\"<ref>Clarke, Arthur C, ''The Lost Worlds of 2001'', pp. 149-150, Signet, 1972</ref> After this, Bowman decides to go out in a pod and retrieve the antenna, which is moving away from the ship. Athena refuses to allow him to leave the ship, citing \"Directive 15\" which prevents it from being left unattended, forcing him to make program modifications during which time the antenna drifts further.<ref>Clarke, Arthur C, ''The Lost Worlds of 2001'', pp. 159-160, Signet, 1972</ref>\n\nDuring rehearsals Kubrick asked [[Stefanie Powers]] to supply the voice of HAL 9000 while searching for a suitably androgynous voice so the actors had something to react to.

(The 2-way yield symbol indicates an equilibrium in which hydrolysis and [[condensation reaction|condensation]] can go both ways.)]]\n'''Hydrolysis''' ({{IPAc-en|h|a\u026a|\u02c8|d|r|\u0252|l|\u026a|s|\u026a|s}}; {{ety|grc|hydro-|water||lysis|to unbind}}) is a term used for both an electro-chemical process and a biological one. The hydrolysis of water is the separation of water molecules into the constituent hydrogen and oxygen atoms with electricity.\n\nBiological hydrolysis is the cleavage of biomolecules where a water molecule is consumed to affect the separation of a larger molecule into component parts. When a [[carbohydrate]] is broken into its component sugar molecules by hydrolysis (e.g. [[sucrose]] being broken down into [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]), this is termed '''saccharification'''. Generally, hydrolysis or saccharification is a step in the degradation of a substance.\n\nHydrolysis can be the reverse of a [[condensation reaction]] in which two molecules join together into a larger one and eject a water molecule. Thus hydrolysis adds water to break down, whereas condensation builds up by removing water and any other solvents.\n\n==Types==\nUsually hydrolysis is a chemical process in which a molecule of water is added to a substance. Sometimes this addition causes both substance and water molecule to split into two parts. In such reactions, one fragment of the target molecule (or parent molecule) gains a [[hydrogen ion]]. It breaks down the chemical bond in the compound \n\n===Salts===\nA common kind of hydrolysis occurs when a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of a [[weak acid]] or [[weak base]] (or both) is dissolved in water. [[Self-ionization of water|Water spontaneously ionizes]] into [[Hydroxide|hydroxide anions]] and [[Hydronium|hydronium cations]]. The salt also dissociates into its constituent anions and cations. For example, [[sodium acetate]] dissociates in water into [[sodium]] and [[acetate]] ions. Sodium ions react very little with the hydroxide ions whereas the acetate ions combine with hydronium ions to produce [[acetic acid]]. In this case the net result is a relative excess of hydroxide ions, yielding a [[solution|basic solution]].\n\n[[Strong acids]] also undergo hydrolysis.  For example, dissolving [[sulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) in water is accompanied by hydrolysis to give [[hydronium]] and [[bisulfate]], the sulfuric acid's [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]]. For a more technical discussion of what occurs during such a hydrolysis, see [[Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base theory]].\n\n===Esters and amides===\nAcid\u2013base-catalysed hydrolyses are very common; one example is the hydrolysis of [[amide]]s or [[ester]]s. Their hydrolysis occurs when the [[nucleophile]] (a nucleus-seeking agent, e.g., water or hydroxyl ion) attacks the carbon of the [[Carbonyl|carbonyl group]] of the [[ester]] or [[amide]]. In an aqueous base, hydroxyl ions are better nucleophiles than polar molecules such as water. In acids, the carbonyl group becomes protonated, and this leads to a much easier nucleophilic attack. The products for both hydrolyses are compounds with [[carboxylic acid]] groups.\n\nPerhaps the oldest commercially practiced example of ester hydrolysis is [[saponification]] (formation of soap). It is the hydrolysis of a [[triglyceride]] (fat) with an aqueous base such as [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH). During the process, [[glycerol]] is formed, and the [[fatty acid]]s react with the base, converting them to salts. These salts are called soaps, commonly used in households.\n\nIn addition, in living systems, most biochemical reactions (including ATP hydrolysis) take place during the catalysis of [[enzyme]]s. The catalytic action of enzymes allows the hydrolysis of [[protein]]s, fats, oils, and [[carbohydrate]]s. As an example, one may consider [[protease]]s (enzymes that aid [[digestion]] by causing hydrolysis of [[peptide bond]]s in [[protein]]s). They catalyse the hydrolysis of interior peptide bonds in peptide chains, as opposed to [[exopeptidase]]s (another class of enzymes, that catalyse the hydrolysis of terminal peptide bonds, liberating one free amino acid at a time).\n\nHowever, proteases do not catalyse the hydrolysis of all kinds of proteins. Their action is stereo-selective: Only proteins with a certain tertiary structure are targeted as some kind of orienting force is needed to place the amide group in the proper position for catalysis. The necessary contacts between an enzyme and its substrates (proteins) are created because the enzyme folds in such a way as to form a crevice into which the substrate fits; the crevice also contains the catalytic groups. Therefore, proteins that do not fit into the crevice will not undergo hydrolysis. This specificity preserves the integrity of other proteins such as [[hormone]]s, and therefore the biological system continues to function normally.\n\nUpon hydrolysis, an [[amide]] converts into a [[carboxylic acid]] and an [[amine]] or [[ammonia]] (which in the presence of acid are immediately converted to ammonium salts). One of the two oxygen groups on the carboxylic acid are derived from a water molecule and the amine (or ammonia) gains the hydrogen ion. The hydrolysis of [[peptide bond|peptides]] gives [[amino acid]]s.\n\n:[[File:Acid-CatAmideHydrolMarch.png|320 px|thumb|Mechanism for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide.]]\n\nMany [[polyamide]] polymers such as [[nylon 6,6]] hydrolyse in the presence of strong acids. The process leads to [[depolymerization]].  For this reason nylon products fail by fracturing when exposed to small amounts of acidic water. Polyesters are also susceptible to similar [[polymer degradation]] reactions. The problem is known as [[environmental stress cracking]].\n\n===ATP===\nHydrolysis is related to [[energy metabolism]] and storage. All living cells require a continual supply of energy for two main purposes: the [[biosynthesis]] of micro and macromolecules, and the active transport of ions and molecules across cell membranes. The energy derived from the [[oxidation]] of nutrients is not used directly but, by means of a complex and long sequence of reactions, it is channelled into a special energy-storage molecule, [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP).  The ATP molecule contains [[pyrophosphate]] linkages (bonds formed when two phosphate units are combined together) that release energy when needed. ATP can undergo hydrolysis in two ways: the removal of terminal phosphate to form [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) and inorganic phosphate, or the removal of a terminal diphosphate to yield [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP) and [[pyrophosphate]]. The latter usually undergoes further cleavage into its two constituent phosphates. This results in biosynthesis reactions, which usually occur in chains, that can be driven in the direction of synthesis when the phosphate bonds have undergone hydrolysis.\n\n===Polysaccharides {{anchor|saccharification}}===\n[[File:Sucrose-inkscape.svg|thumb|Sucrose. The glycoside bond is  represented by the central oxygen atom, which holds the two monosaccharide units together.]]\n[[Monosaccharide]]s can be linked together by [[glycosidic bond]]s, which can be cleaved by hydrolysis.  Two, three, several or many monosaccharides thus linked form [[disaccharide]]s, [[trisaccharide]]s, [[oligosaccharide]]s or [[polysaccharide]]s, respectively.  Enzymes that hydrolyse glycosidic bonds are called \"[[glycoside hydrolase]]s\" or \"glycosidases\".\n\nThe best-known disaccharide is [[sucrose]] (table sugar). Hydrolysis of sucrose yields [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. [[Invertase]] is a [[sucrase]] used industrially for the hydrolysis of sucrose to so-called [[invert sugar]].  [[Lactase]] is essential for digestive hydrolysis of [[lactose]] in milk; many adult humans do not produce lactase and [[lactose intolerance|cannot digest the lactose]] in milk.\n\nThe hydrolysis of polysaccharides to soluble sugars is called \"saccharification\".  Malt made from [[barley]] is used as a source of \u03b2-amylase to break down [[starch]] into the disaccharide [[maltose]], which can be used by yeast to [[brewing|produce beer]].  Other [[amylase]] enzymes may convert starch to glucose or to oligosaccharides.  [[Cellulose]] is first hydrolyzed to [[cellobiose]] by [[cellulase]] and then cellobiose is further hydrolyzed to [[glucose]] by [[beta-glucosidase]]. [[Ruminants]] such as cows are able to hydrolyze cellulose into cellobiose and then glucose because of [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] bacteria that produce cellulases.\n\n===Metal aqua ions===\n{{Main|Metal ions in aqueous solution}}\n\nMetal ions are [[Lewis acid]]s, and in aqueous solution they form [[metal aqua ion]]s of the general formula M(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub><sup>m+</sup>.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Burgess, J. |year=1978 |title=Metal ions in solution |location=New York |publisher=Ellis Horwood}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Richens | first =D. T. | title = The chemistry of aqua ions: synthesis, structure, and reactivity: a tour through the periodic table of the elements | publisher = Wiley | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-471-97058-1}}</ref> The aqua ions undergo hydrolysis, to a greater or lesser extent. The first hydrolysis step is given generically as\n\n: M(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub><sup>m+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} M(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n\u22121</sub>(OH)<sup>(m\u22121)+</sup> + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>\n\nThus the aqua [[cations]] behave as acids in terms of [[Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid-base theory]]. This effect is easily explained by considering the [[inductive effect]] of the positively charged metal ion, which weakens the O-H bond of an attached water molecule, making the liberation of a proton relatively easy.\n\nThe [[Acid dissociation constant|dissociation constant]], pK<sub>a</sub>, for this reaction is more or less linearly related to the charge-to-size ratio of the metal ion.<ref name=\"bm\">Baes, C.F.; Mesmer, R.E. ''The Hydrolysis of Cations'', (1976), Wiley, New York</ref> Ions with low charges, such as Na<sup>+</sup> are very weak acids with almost imperceptible hydrolysis. Large divalent ions such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Sn<sup>2+</sup> and Pb<sup>2+</sup> have a pK<sub>a</sub> of 6 or more and would not normally be classed as acids, but small divalent ions such as Be<sup>2+</sup> undergo extensive hydrolysis. Trivalent ions like Al<sup>3+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> are weak acids whose pK<sub>a</sub> is comparable to that of [[acetic acid]]. Solutions of salts such as BeCl<sub>2</sub> or Al(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> in water are noticeably [[acidic]]; the hydrolysis can be [[le chatelier's principle|suppressed]] by adding an acid such as [[nitric acid]], making the solution more acidic.\n\nHydrolysis may proceed beyond the first step, often with the formation of polynuclear species via the process of [[olation]].<ref name=\"bm\"/> Some \"exotic\" species such as Sn<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub><sup>2+</sup><ref>{{greenwood&Earnshaw|page=384}}</ref> are well characterized. Hydrolysis tends to proceed as [[pH]] rises leading, in many cases, to the precipitation of a hydroxide such as Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> or AlO(OH). These substances, major constituents of [[bauxite]], are known as [[laterite]]s and are formed by leaching from rocks of most of the ions other than aluminium and iron and subsequent hydrolysis of the remaining aluminium and iron.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Adenosine triphosphate]]\n* [[Catabolism]]\n* [[Condensation reaction]]\n* [[Dehydration synthesis]]\n* [[Hydrolysis constant]]\n* [[Inhibitor protein]]\n* [[Polymer degradation]]\n* [[Proteolysis]]\n* [[Sol-gel#Polymerization|Sol-gel polymerisation]]\n* [[Solvolysis]]\n* [[Thermal hydrolysis]]\n* [[Tissue digestion]]\n* [[Saponification]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Equilibrium chemistry]]\n[[Category:Chemical reactions]]", "sha1": "5ecqj32krdgidrqvtlq6ajcjxzyol2w"}}, {"title": "Hydroxy group", "ns": "0", "id": "14386", "revision": {"id": "859932861", "parentid": "859063471", "timestamp": "2018-09-17T07:15:36Z", "contributor": {"username": "Christian75", "id": "1306352"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/137.43.223.92|137.43.223.92]] ([[User talk:137.43.223.92|talk]]) to last version by Antiqueight", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the hydroxyl functional group|the Hydroxyl radical|Hydroxyl radical}}\n\n[[File:Hydroxyl3D.png|thumb|right|200px|Representation of an [[organic compound|organic]] hydroxy group, where R represents a [[hydrocarbon]] or other organic moiety, the red and grey spheres represent oxygen and hydrogen atoms respectively, and the rod-like connections between these, [[covalent]] [[chemical bond]]s.]]\n\nA '''hydroxy''' or '''hydroxyl group''' is the entity with the formula OH. It contains [[oxygen]] [[Chemical bond|bonded]] to [[hydrogen]]. In [[organic chemistry]], [[alcohol]] and [[carboxylic acid]]s contain hydroxy groups.  The [[Ion|anion]] [OH<sup>\u2212</sup>], called [[hydroxide]], consists of a hydroxy group.\n\nAccording to [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] rules, the term hydroxyl refers to the [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] OH only, while the functional group \u2212OH is called hydroxy group.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alcohols|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00204.html|publisher=IUPAC|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\nWater, alcohols, carboxylic acids, and many other hydroxy-containing compounds can be [[Deprotonation|deprotonated]] readily. This behavior is rationalized by the disparate electronegativities of oxygen and hydrogen. Hydroxy-containing compounds engage in [[hydrogen bond]]ing, which causes them to stick together, leading to higher boiling and melting points than found for compounds that lack this [[functional group]]. Organic compounds, which are often poorly soluble in water, become water-soluble when they contain two or more hydroxy groups, as illustrated by [[sugar]]s and [[amino acid]].\n[[File:Sulfuric-acid-2D-dimensions.svg|thumb|left|[[Sulfuric acid]] contains two hydroxy groups.]]\n\n==Occurrence==\nThe hydroxy group is pervasive in chemistry and biochemistry.  Many inorganic compounds contain hydroxy groups, including [[sulfuric acid]], the chemical compound produced on the largest scale industrially.\n\nHydroxy groups participate in the dehydration reactions that link simple biological molecules into long chains. The joining of a [[fatty acid]] to [[glycerol]] to form a [[triacylglycerol]] removes the \u2212OH from the carboxy end of the fatty acid. The joining of two [[Aldose|aldehyde sugars]] to form a [[disaccharide]] removes the \u2212OH from the carboxy group at the [[aldehyde]] end of one [[sugar]]. The creation of a [[peptide bond]] to link two [[amino acid]]s to make a [[protein]] removes the \u2212OH from the carboxy group of one amino acid.\n\n==Hydroxyl radical==\n{{main|Hydroxyl radical}}\nHydroxyl radicals are highly reactive and undergo chemical reactions that make them short-lived.

In particular, [[homeothermy|homeothermic]] species maintain a stable body temperature by regulating metabolic processes. The only known homeotherms are [[birds]] and [[mammals]]. Other species have various degrees of [[thermoregulation]].\n\nAnimal body temperature control varies by species, so the terms \"warm-blooded\" and \"[[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]]\" (though still in everyday use) suggest a false idea of there being only two categories of body temperature control, and are no longer used scientifically.\n\n==Terminology==\nIn general, warm-bloodedness refers to three separate categories of [[thermoregulation]].\n*[[Endotherm]]y is the ability of some creatures to control their body temperatures through internal means such as muscle shivering or increasing their [[metabolism]] ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: \u1f14\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd ''endon'' \"within\" \u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b7 ''therm\u0113'' \"heat\"). Some writers{{Who|date=September 2010}} restrict the meaning of endothermy to mechanisms that directly raise the animal's metabolic rate to produce heat. The opposite of endothermy is [[ectothermy]]. \n*[[Homeotherm]]y maintains a stable internal body temperature regardless of external influence and temperatures. The stable internal temperature is often higher than the immediate environment (Greek: \u1f45\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 ''homoios'' \"similar\", \u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b7 ''therm\u0113'' \"heat\"). The opposite is [[poikilothermy]]. Mammals and birds are homeothermic.\n*Tachymetabolism maintains a high \"resting\" metabolism (Greek: \u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03cd\u03c2 ''tachys/tachus'' \"fast, swift\", \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ''metaballein'' \"turn quickly\"). In essence, tachymetabolic creatures are \"on\" all the time. Though their resting metabolism is still many times slower than their active metabolism, the difference is often not as large as that seen in [[bradymetabolism|bradymetabolic]] creatures. Tachymetabolic creatures have greater difficulty dealing with a scarcity of food.\n\n==The variety of thermoregulation types==\nA large proportion of the creatures traditionally called \"warm-blooded\", like birds and mammals, fit all three of these categories (i.e., they are endothermic, homeothermic, ''and'' tachymetabolic).  However, over the past 30 years, studies in the field of animal thermophysiology have revealed many species belonging to these two groups that do not fit all these criteria.  For example, many [[bat]]s and small birds are [[poikilothermic]] and [[bradymetabolism|bradymetabolic]] when they sleep for the night (or, in nocturnal species, for the day).  For these creatures, the term [[heterothermy]] was coined.\n\nFurther studies on animals that were traditionally assumed to be [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]] have shown that most creatures incorporate different variations of the three terms defined above, along with their counterparts ([[ectothermic|ectothermy]], [[poikilothermy]], and [[bradymetabolism]]), thus creating a broad spectrum of body temperature types. Some [[fish]] have warm-blooded characteristics, such as the [[opah]]. [[Swordfish]] and some [[shark]]s have [[circulatory system|circulatory]] mechanisms that keep their [[brain]]s and [[eye]]s above ambient temperatures and thus increase their ability to detect and react to [[predation|prey]].<ref>[http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2005/110/2 Hot Eyes for Cold Fish -- Wong 2005 (110): 2 -- ScienceNOW]</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| title=Warm brain and eye temperatures in sharks |author1=Block, B.A. |author2=Carey, F.G.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B | publisher=Springer | volume=156 | issue=2 |date=March 1985 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/ux6865g5610x54n4/ | doi=10.1007/BF00695777 | pages=229 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/?article=6503 | title=Warm eyes give deep-sea predators super vision | publisher=University of Queensland | date=11 January 2005 }}</ref> Tunas and some sharks have similar mechanisms in their muscles, improving their stamina when swimming at high speed.<ref>{{Cite journal| title=Warm-Blooded Fish | author=McFarlane, P. | journal=Monthly Bulletin of the Hamilton and District Aquarium Society |date=January 1999 | url=http://www.aquarticles.com/articles/breeding/McFarlane_Warm_Blooded_Fish.html }}</ref>\n\n==Heat generation==\nBody heat is [[thermogenesis|generated]] by [[metabolism]].  This refers to the chemical reactions [[cell (biology)|cell]]s use to break down [[glucose]] into water and [[carbon dioxide]] and, in so doing, generate ATP ([[adenosine triphosphate]]), a high-energy compound used to power other cellular processes. Muscle contraction is a type of metabolic process that generates heat energy, and heat is also generated through friction when blood flows through the circulatory system.\n\nAll organisms metabolize food and other inputs, but some make better use of the output than others. Like all energy conversions, metabolism is rather inefficient, and around 60% of the available energy is converted to heat rather than to ATP. In most organisms, this heat is simply lost to the environment. However, endothermic homeotherms (the animals generally characterized as \"warm-blooded\") both produce more heat and have better ways to retain and regulate it than other animals. They have a higher basal metabolic rate, and also a greater capacity to increase their metabolic rate when engaged in strenuous activity. They usually have well-developed insulation in order to retain body heat, fur in the case of mammals and [[feather]]s in birds. When this insulation is insufficient to maintain body temperature, they may resort to [[shivering]]\u2014rapid muscle contractions that quickly use up ATP, thus stimulating cellular metabolism to replace it and consequently produce more heat.

Hera is not mentioned as the mother.\n\n* According to Pseudo-Apollodorus (Bibliotheca, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.3.6&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 1.3.6]) Hera gave birth to Hephaestus alone. Pseudo-Apollodorus also relates that, according to Homer, Hephaestus is one of the children of Zeus and Hera (consciously contradicting Hesiod and Homer).\n\n* Several later texts follow Hesiod's account, including [[Hyginus]] and the preface to ''[[Fabulae]]''.\n\nIn the account of Attic vase painters, Hephaestus was present at the birth of Athena and wields the axe with which he split Zeus' head to free her. In the latter account, Hephaestus is there represented as older than Athena, so the mythology of Hephaestus is inconsistent in this respect.\n\n===Fall from Olympus===\nIn one branch of Greek mythology, Hera ejected Hephaestus from the heavens because he was \"shrivelled of foot\".

However, of the union of Hephaestus with Aphrodite, there was no issue unless [[Virgil]] was serious when he said that [[Eros]] was their child.<ref>''[[Aeneid]]'' i.664</ref> Later authors explain this statement by saying that Eros was sired by Ares but passed off to Hephaestus as his own son.\n\nHephaestus was somehow connected with the archaic, pre-Greek [[Phrygia]]n and [[Thrace|Thracian]] mystery cult of the [[Kabeiroi]], who were also called the ''Hephaistoi'', \"the Hephaestus-men\", in Lemnos. One of the three Lemnian tribes also called themselves Hephaestion and claimed direct descent from the god.\n\n===Hephaestus and Athena===\nHephaestus is to the male gods as Athena is to the females, for he gives skill to mortal artists and was believed to have taught men the arts alongside Athena.<ref>Od. vi. 233, xxiii. 160. Hymn. in Vaulc. 2. &c.</ref> He was nevertheless believed to be far inferior to the sublime character of Athena. At Athens they had temples and festivals in common.<ref group=lower-alpha>See Dict of Ant. s. v. H\u00eaphaisteia, Chalkeia.</ref> Both were believed to have great healing powers, and Lemnian earth (terra Lemnia) from the spot on which Hephaestus had fallen was believed to cure madness, the bites of snakes, and haemorrhage, and priests of Hephaestus knew how to cure wounds inflicted by snakes.<ref>Philostr. Heroic. v. 2; Eustath. ad Hom. p.&nbsp;330; Dict. Cret. ii. 14.</ref>\n\nHe was represented in the temple of Athena Chalcioecus (Athena of the Bronze House<ref>The Museum of Goddess Athena, [http://www.goddess-athena.org/Museum/Temples/Sparta/index.htm Sanctuary of Athena Chalkiokos at Sparta]</ref>) at Sparta, in the act of delivering his mother;<ref>Paus. iii. 17. \u00a7 3</ref> on the chest of Cypselus, giving Achilles's armour to Thetis;<ref>v. 19. \u00a7 2</ref> and at Athens there was the famous statue of Hephaestus by Alcamenes, in which his lameness was only subtly portrayed.<ref>Cic. de Nat. Deor. i. 30; Val. Max. viii. 11. \u00a7 3</ref> The Greeks frequently placed small dwarf-like statues of Hephaestus near their hearths, and these figures are the oldest of all his representations.<ref>Herod. iii. 37; Aristoph. Av. 436; Callim. Hymnn. in Dian. 60</ref> During the best period of Grecian art he was represented as a vigorous man with a beard, and is characterized by his hammer or some other crafting tool, his oval cap, and the [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]].\n\nAthena is sometimes thought to be \"the \u2018soul-mate\u2019 of [Hephaestus]. Yet a kind of cloudy mysteriousness shrouds their relationship; no single tradition was ever clearly established on this subject, and so what confronts us is a blurred image based on rumors and conflicting reports.\" Nonetheless, he \"seeks impetuously and passionately to make love to Athena: at the moment of climax she pushes him aside, and his semen falls to the earth where it impregnates Gaia.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hillman|first1=James|title=Facing the Gods|date=1980|publisher=Spring Pubns|isbn=978-0882143125}}</ref>\n\n===Volcano god===\nHephaestus was associated by Greek colonists in southern [[Italy]] with the [[volcano]] gods [[Adranus]] (of [[Mount Etna]]) and [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcanus]] of the [[Lipari]] islands.<!-- His forge was moved to the Lipari islands by the poets. **what poets? --> The first-century sage [[Apollonius of Tyana]] is said to have observed, \"there are many other mountains all over the earth that are on fire, and yet we should never be done with it if we assigned to them giants and gods like Hephaestus\".<ref>''Life of Apollonius of Tyana'', book v.16.</ref>\n\n===Other mythology===\nIn the Trojan war, Hephaestus sided with the Greeks, but was also worshiped by the Trojans and saved one of their men from being killed by Diomedes.<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'', v, 9&nbsp;[[wikt:ff.|]]</ref> Hephaestus\u2019 favourite place in the mortal world was the island of [[Lemnos]], where he liked to dwell among the Sintians,<ref>Od. viii. 283&nbsp;[[wikt:ff.|]]</ref><ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'', i, 593.</ref><ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', viii, 82.</ref> but he also frequented other volcanic islands such as Lipara, Hiera, Imbros and Sicily, which were called his abodes or workshops.<ref>[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], iii. 41.</ref><ref>[[Callimachus]], ''Hymn. in Dian''. 47</ref><ref>Serv.

In vase paintings, Hephaestus is usually shown lame and bent over his anvil, hard at work on a metal creation, and sometimes with his feet back-to-front: ''Hephaistos amphigy\u0113eis''. He walked with the aid of a stick. The [[Argonauts|Argonaut]] Palaimonius,<!--please don't redlink this name unless you can write 1500 words on him--> \"son of Hephaestus\" (i.e. a bronze-smith) was also lame.<ref>[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' i.204.</ref>\n\nOther \"sons of Hephaestus\" were the [[Cabeiri]] on the island of [[Samothrace]], who were identified with the [[crab]] (''karkinos'') by the lexicographer [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]]. The adjective ''karkinopous'' (\"crab-footed\") signified \"lame\", according to Detienne and Vernant.<ref>{{cite book|first=Marcel|last=Detienne|first2=Jean-Pierre|last2=Vernant|title=Cunning Intelligence in Greek Culture and Society|others=Janet Lloyd, translator|location=Atlantic Highlands, NJ|publisher=Humanities Press|year=1978|pages=269\u2013272|isbn=0-391-00740-8}} Cited by {{cite book|first=Morris|last=Silver|title=Taking Ancient Mythology Economically|year=1992|location=New York|publisher=Brill|page=35 note 5|isbn=90-04-09706-6}}</ref> The Cabeiri were also lame.\n\nIn some myths, Hephaestus built himself a \"wheeled chair\" or chariot with which to move around, thus helping him overcome his lameness while demonstrating his skill to the other gods.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Jay|last=Dolmage|title='Breathe Upon Us an Even Flame': Hephaestus, History, and the Body of Rhetoric|journal=Rhetoric Review|volume=25|issue=2|year=2006|pages=119\u2013140 [p. 120]|doi=10.1207/s15327981rr2502_1}}</ref> In the ''Iliad'' 18.371, it is stated that Hephaestus built twenty bronze wheeled tripods to assist him in moving around.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=A.T.|title=The Iliad 18.371|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D18%3Acard%3D360|website=Perseus|publisher=Tufts University|accessdate=21 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nHephaestus\u2019s ugly appearance and lameness is taken by some to represent [[Arsenic poisoning|arsenicosis]], an effect of high levels of [[arsenic]] exposure that would result in lameness and [[skin cancer]]s.

He studied the works of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Mark Twain]] and developed a style emphasizing the use of satire. His English-language works utilize primarily [[Afrikaner]] characters and highlight the many contradictions in Afrikaner society during the first half of the twentieth century. \n\n==Early life==\nBosman was born at [[Kuils River]], near [[Cape Town]], to an Afrikaner family. He was raised with English as well as [[Afrikaans]]. While Bosman was still young, his family travelled frequently, he spent a short time at Potchefstroom College which would later become [[Potchefstroom High School for Boys]], he later  moved to [[Johannesburg]] where he went to school at [[Jeppe High School for Boys]] in [[Kensington, Gauteng|Kensington]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} While there he contributed to the school magazine. When Bosman was sixteen, he started writing short stories for the national Sunday newspaper (the ''[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]]''). He attended the Johannesburg College of Education (which in 2002 was incorporated into the [[University of the Witwatersrand]])<ref>[http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1719&Itemid=203 Joburg.org.za] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306023053/http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1719&Itemid=203 |date=6 March 2012 }}, \"Wits turns 85 today\", retrieved 30 December 2011</ref> and submitted various pieces to student literary competitions.\n\n==Career and adult life==\nAfter graduation, Bosman accepted a [[teaching]] position in the [[Groot Marico]] district in an Afrikaans-language school. The area  provided the backdrop for his best-known short stories, the ''Oom Schalk Lourens'' series (featuring an older character named Oom Schalk Lourens) and the ''Voorkamer'' sketches.\n\nOver the school holidays in 1926, Bosman visited his family in Johannesburg. During an argument, he shot and killed his stepbrother. Bosman was sentenced to death for the crime and was sent to [[Death row]] at the [[Pretoria Central Prison]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-k0XX--pZIC&pg=PA55 |title=Herman Charles Bosman: Between the Lines |first=Valerie |last=Rosenberg |page=55 |publisher=Struik |year=2005 |isbn=1-77007-163-6}}</ref> His sentence was later reduced to ten years with hard labour. In 1930, he was released on parole after serving half his sentence. His prison experiences formed the basis for his semi-autobiographical book, ''Cold Stone Jug''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nBosman then started his own printing-press company and was part of a literary set in Johannesburg, associating with poets, journalists, and writers, including Aegidius Jean Blignaut. He toured overseas for nine years, spending most of his time in London. The short stories that he wrote during this period formed the basis for another of his best-known books, ''Mafeking Road''.\n\nAt the start of the [[Second World War]], he returned to South Africa and worked as a journalist. During this time he translated the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'' into Afrikaans.\n\nBosman lamented the fact that Johannesburg neglected its heritage. In ''The Standard Theatre'' he complained that the city's residents:\n\n\"will pull down the Standard Theatre like they have pulled down all the old buildings, theatres, gin-palaces, dosshouses, temples, shops, arcades, cafes and joints that were intimately associated with the mining-camp days of Johannesburg. Because I know Johannesburg. And I am satisfied that there is no other city in the world that is so anxious to shake off the memories of its early origins.\"\n\nBosman's second wife was Ella Manson. The couple were renowned{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} for their [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle and parties, which featured witty conversation and usually ended well after midnight.\n\nFrom 1948 to his death in 1951, Bosman was employed as [[proof editor]] at The Sunday Express. In addition, he was contracted to write a weekly Voorkamer story for ''The Forum'' magazine.<ref name=beeld/>\n\nHis last wife was Helena Lake (n\u00e9e Stegmann). After a [[housewarming party]] in October 1951, Bosman experienced severe chest pains and was taken to [[Edenvale, Gauteng|Edenvale]] Hospital. On admission, he was asked for his birthplace. He replied, \"Born Kuilsrivier \u2013 Died Edenvale Hospital.\" He was discharged and collapsed at home a few hours later. Bosman died as he was being rushed to hospital. He is buried in [[Westpark Cemetery]] in Westdene under a triangular headstone that reads \"Die Skrywer, The Writer, Herman Charles Bosman, b 3.2.1905, d 14.10.1951.\"\n\n==Legacy==\nAfter his death, the rights to his works were auctioned. They were purchased by his last wife, Helena, and upon her death, the rights were passed to her son, who retains them. In 1960, however, Helena sold some of his documents and 123\u2009of his water colours and pencil sketches to the [[Harry Ransom Center]] in Texas.<ref name=beeld>{{cite news|last=Snyman|first=Salom\u00e9|title=Bosman se laaste stukkie legkaart |url=http://www.beeld.com/bylae/2013-04-06-bosman-se-laaste-stukkie-legkaart |accessdate=2 July 2013 |newspaper=Beeld |date=6 April 2013|language=Afrikaans}}</ref>\n\nOnly three of his books were published during his lifetime: ''Mafeking Road'' published by Dassie, and ''Jacaranda in the Night'' and ''Cold Stone Jug'' published by APB.

This is particularly true in the [[Military of the United States|armed forces of the United States]], where gun-howitzers have been officially described as \"howitzers\" for more than sixty years. Because of this practice, the word \"howitzer\" is used in some armies as a [[Genericized trademark|generic term]] for any kind of artillery piece that is designed to attack targets using [[indirect fire]]. Thus, artillery pieces that bear little resemblance to howitzers of earlier eras are now described as ''howitzers'', although the British call them ''guns''. Most other armies in the world reserve the word \"''howitzer''\" for guns with barrel lengths 15 to 25&nbsp;times their caliber, with longer-barreled guns being termed \"[[cannon]]s\".{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe British had a further method of nomenclature.

Mortars had been categorized by calibre in inches in the 17th century and this was inherited by howitzers.<ref>''Artillery: Its Origin, Heyday and Decline'', Brigadier OFG Hogg, London, C Hurst and Company,1970</ref>\n\nCurrent U.S. military doctrine defines howitzers as any cannon artillery capable of high-angle (45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 elevation) and low-angle (45\u00b0 to 0\u00b0 elevation) fire; guns are defined as being only capable of low-angle fire, and mortars only capable of high-angle fire.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nThe modern howitzers were invented in Sweden towards the end of the 17th century. These were characterized by a shorter [[Gun_carriage#Field_carriages|trail]] than other [[field gun]]s, meaning less stability when firing, which reduced the amount of powder that could be used; armies using these had to rely on a greater elevation angle to achieve a given range, which gave a steeper angle of descent.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nOriginally intended for use in [[Siege|siege warfare]], they were particularly useful for delivering [[Cast iron|cast-iron]] shells filled with gunpowder or incendiary materials into the interior of fortifications. In contrast to contemporary mortars, which were fired at a fixed angle and were entirely dependent on adjustments to the size of propellant charges to vary range, howitzers could be fired at a wide variety of angles. Thus, while howitzer gunnery was more complicated than the technique of employing mortars, the howitzer was an inherently more flexible weapon that could fire its projectiles along a wide variety of trajectories.<ref>OFG Hogg ''Artillery: Its Origin, Heyday and Decline'' (London: C Hurst & Co, 1970), pp. 94</ref>\n[[File:Keegan's howitzer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Mountain howitzer firing]]\n\nIn the middle of the 18th century, a number of European armies began to introduce howitzers that were mobile enough to accompany armies in the field. Though usually fired at the relatively high angles of fire used by contemporary siege howitzers, these field howitzers were rarely defined by this capability. Rather, as the field guns of the day were usually restricted to inert projectiles (which relied entirely on momentum for their destructive effects), the field howitzers of the 18th century were chiefly valued for their ability to fire explosive shells. Many, for the sake of simplicity and rapidity of fire, dispensed with adjustable propellant charges.<ref>Heinrich Rohne, \"Zur Geschichte der schweren Feldhaubitze\", ''Jahrb\u00fccher f\u00fcr die deutsche Armee und Marine'', No. 423, pp. 567\u201368</ref>\n\nThe [[Abus gun]] was an early form of howitzer in the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name=\"Dragoman\">{{cite web|url=http://magweb.com/sample/sdra/sdr12gun.htm |title=William Johnson, \"The Sultan's Big Guns.\" ''Dragoman'', vol.1, no.2 |accessdate=2017-04-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710015533/http://magweb.com/sample/sdra/sdr12gun.htm |archivedate=July 10, 2007 |df= }}</ref> In 1758 the [[Russian Empire]] introduced a specific type of howitzer (or rather gun-howitzer), with a conical chamber, called a [[licorne]], which remained in service for the next 100 years.<ref name=\"angus\">{{cite book|last=Konstam|first=Angus |title=Russian Army of the Seven Years War (2)|publisher=Osprey Publishing|place=Londyn|year=1996|series=Men-at-Arms|pages=41|isbn=978-1-85532-587-6}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Oldhowitzer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|12-pdr Napoleon at the [[Colorado State Capitol]]]]\n[[File:12 pounder mountain howitzer on display at Fort Laramie in eastern Wyoming.jpg|thumb|Nineteenth-century 12-pounder (5&nbsp;kg) mountain howitzer displayed by the [[National Park Service]] at [[Fort Laramie]] in [[Wyoming]], United States]]\n\nIn the mid-19th century, some armies attempted to simplify their artillery parks by introducing smoothbore artillery pieces that were designed to fire both explosive projectiles and cannonballs, thereby replacing both field howitzers and field guns. The most famous of these \"gun-howitzers\" was the [[Canon obusier de 12|Napoleon 12-pounder]], a weapon of French design that saw extensive service in the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Ildefonse Fav\u00e9, \u201cR\u00e9sum\u00e9 des progr\u00e8s de l\u2019artillerie depuis l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1800 jusqu\u2019a l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1853\u201d, in [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]] and Ildefonse Fav\u00e9, ''\u00c9tudes sur le pass\u00e9 et l'avenir de de l'artillerie'', (Paris: J.

These new field pieces used cylindrical projectiles that, while smaller in caliber than the spherical shells of smoothbore field howitzers, could carry a comparable charge of gunpowder. Moreover, their greater range let them create many of the same effects (such as firing over low walls) that previously required the sharply curved trajectories of smoothbore field howitzers. Because of this, military authorities saw no point in obtaining rifled field howitzers to replace their smoothbore counterparts but, instead, used rifled field guns to replace both guns and howitzers.<ref>Charles Thoumas, ''Les transformations de l'Arm\u00e9e fran\u00e7aise: essais d'histoire et de critique sur l'\u00e9tat militaire de la France'', (Paris : Berger-Levrault, 1887), II, p. 123\u201326</ref>\n\nIn [[siege warfare]], the introduction of rifling had the opposite effect. In the 1860s, artillery officers discovered that rifled siege howitzers (substantially larger than field howitzers) were a more efficient means of destroying walls (particularly walls protected by certain kinds of intervening obstacles) than smoothbore siege guns or siege mortars. Thus, at the same time armies were taking howitzers of one sort out of their field batteries, they were introducing howitzers of another sort into their siege trains and fortresses. The lightest of these weapons (later known as \"light siege howitzers\") had calibers around 150&nbsp;mm and fired shells that weighed between 40 and 50 kilograms. The heaviest (later called \"medium siege howitzers\") had calibers between 200&nbsp;mm and 220&nbsp;mm and fired shells that weighed about 100 kilograms (220 pounds).<ref>Hermann von M\u00fcller, ''Die Entwickelung der deutschen Festungs und Belagerungstrains'', (Berlin: E. S. Mittler, 1896), pp. 328\u201335</ref>\n[[File:Manila646 1899.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|A United States howitzer during the [[Battle of Manila (1899)|Battle of Manila]], 1899]]\n\nIn the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877\u20131878, the inability of rifled field guns to inflict significant damage on field fortifications led to a revival of interest in field howitzers. By the 1890s, a number of European armies fielded either light (105&nbsp;mm to 127&nbsp;mm) or heavy (149&nbsp;mm to 155&nbsp;mm) field howitzers and a few, such as that of Germany, fielded both.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nDuring the 1880s, a third type of siege howitzer was added to inventories of a number of European armies. With calibers that ranged between 240&nbsp;mm and 270&nbsp;mm and shells that weighed more than 150 kilos, these soon came to be known as \"heavy siege howitzers\". A good example of a weapon of this class is provided by the [[BL 9.45 inch Howitzer Mk I|9.45-inch (240&nbsp;mm) weapon]] that the [[British Army]] purchased from the [[\u0160koda Works|Skoda works]] in 1899. Intended for use against the fortifications of Pretoria, which fell before the howitzer could be used, and subsequently deployed to China for use against the fortifications of Peking, which also fell without a siege, the {{convert|9.45|in|mm|sing=on}} howitzer was never [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fire_in_anger fired in anger].{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\n[[File:38 cm siege howitzer Austria Hungary 1916.jpg|thumb|38 cm siege howitzer, Austria Hungary 1916, in the [[Heeresgeschichtliches Museum]], [[Vienna]].]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, the introduction of howitzers that were significantly larger than the heavy siege howitzers of the day made necessary the creation of a fourth category, that of \"super-heavy siege howitzers\". Weapons of this category include the famous [[Big Bertha (Howitzer)|Big Bertha]] of the German Army and the [[BL 15 inch Howitzer|15-inch (381&nbsp;mm) howitzer]] of the British [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine Artillery]]. These large howitzers were transported mechanically rather than by teams of horses. They were transported as several loads and had to be assembled at their firing position.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nThese field howitzers introduced at the end of the 19th century could fire shells with high trajectories giving a steep angle of descent and, as a result, could strike targets that were protected by intervening obstacles. They could also fire shells that were about twice as large as shells fired by guns of the same size. Thus, while a 75&nbsp;mm field gun that weighed one ton or so was limited to shells that weighed less than 8 kilograms, a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer of the same weight could fire 15 kilogram shells. This is a matter of fundamental mechanics affecting the stability and hence the weight of the carriage. However, howitzers had a shorter maximum range than the equivalent gun.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n[[File:155fire.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|US [[M198 howitzer|M198]] gun-howitzer]]\n\nAs heavy field howitzers and light siege howitzers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries used ammunition of the same size and types, there was a marked tendency for the two types to merge. At first, this was largely a matter of the same basic weapon being employed on two different mountings. Later, as on-carriage recoil-absorbing systems eliminated many of the advantages that siege platforms had enjoyed over field carriages, the same combination of barrel assembly, recoil mechanism and carriage was used in both roles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nBy the early 20th century, the differences between guns and howitzers were relative not absolute and generally recognized<ref>HA Bethell, ''Modern Guns and Gunnery'', (Woolwich: F.J. Cattermole, 1905, 1907, 1910)</ref> as follows:\n* Guns \u2013 higher velocity and longer range, single charge propellant, maximum elevation generally less than 35 degrees.\n* Howitzers \u2013 lower velocity and shorter range, multi-charge propellant, maximum elevation typically more than 45 degrees.\n\nThe onset of [[trench warfare]] after the first few months of the [[World War I|First World War]] greatly increased the demand for howitzers that gave a steep angle of descent, which were better suited than guns to the task of striking targets in a vertical plane (such as trenches), with large amounts of explosive and considerably less barrel wear. The German army was well equipped with howitzers, having far more at the beginning of the war than France.<ref>{{cite book|first=Bruce I.|last=Gudmundsson|title=On Artillery|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=0-275-94047-0|year=1993}}</ref>\n\nMany howitzers introduced in the course of World War I had longer barrels than pre-war howitzers. The standard German light field howitzer at the start of the war (the [[10.5 cm Feldhaubitze 98/09|10.5&nbsp;cm leichte Feldhaubitze 98/09]]) had a barrel that was 16 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibers]] long, but the light field howitzer adopted by the German Army in 1916 ([[10.5 cm leFH 16|105&nbsp;mm leichte Feldhaubitze 16]], see on the left) had a barrel that was 22 calibers long. At the same time, new models of field gun introduced during that conflict, such as the 77&nbsp;mm field gun adopted by the German Army in 1916 ([[7.7 cm FK 16|7,7 cm Feldkanone 16]]) were often provided with carriages that allowed firing at comparatively high angles, and adjustable propellant cartridges.<ref>Hans Linnenkohl, ''Vom Einzelschuss zur Feuerwalze'', (Koblenz: Bernard und Graefe, 1990), pp. 86 and 219-220</ref> In other words, there was a marked tendency for howitzers to become more \"gun-like\", while guns were taking on some of the attributes of howitzers.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n[[File:105mm-Kroop-HowitzerBG-WWI.jpg|thumb|left|German [[10.5 cm leFH 18/40]] howitzer (dating from World War II), employed as a monument on the site of the World War I [[Battle of Turtucaia]]]]\n\nIn the years after World War I, the tendency of guns and howitzers to acquire each other's characteristics led to the renaissance of the concept of the gun-howitzer. This was a product of technical advances such as the French invention of [[autofrettage]] just before World War I, which led to stronger and lighter barrels, the use of cut-off gear to control recoil length depending on firing elevation angle, and the invention of [[muzzle brake]]s to reduce recoil forces. Like the gun-howitzers of the 19th century, those of the 20th century replaced both guns and howitzers.\n[[File:25 pounder firing a blank.ogv|thumb|Demonstration of a British 25-pounder firing]]\n\nThus, the [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25-pounder \"gun-howitzer\"]] of the British Army replaced both the [[Ordnance QF 18 pounder|18-pounder]] field gun and the [[QF 4.5 inch Howitzer|4.5-inch howitzer]].<ref>[[25 pounder#Design]]</ref> While this had the effect of simplifying such things as organization, training and the supply of ammunition, it created considerable confusion in the realm of nomenclature.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} In the US Army, however, the preferred term was \"howitzer\". Thus, as gun-howitzers replaced both guns and howitzers, words such as \"obusier\" (French) and \"Haubitze\" (German), which had originally been used to designate weapons with relatively short barrels, were applied to weapons with much longer barrels.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n[[File:PzH2000.Ger.jpg|thumb|left|Self-propelled howitzer [[PzH 2000]] of the [[German Army]]]]\n[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 041021-M-8096K-036.jpg|thumb|[[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[M198 howitzer|M-198]] firing outside of [[Fallujah]], Iraq in 2004]]\n\nDuring World War II, the military doctrine of [[Soviet deep battle]] called for extensive use of heavy artillery to hold the formal line of front. Soviet doctrine was remarkably different from the German doctrine of [[Blitzkrieg]], and called for a far more extensive use of artillery. As a result, howitzers saw most of the action on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]], and most of the best howitzers of the WWII period were Soviet-made,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} as other allies mostly relied on different types of assault for the battle. Most of the howitzers produced by the [[USSR]] at the time were not self-propelled, as the country did not have resources to spare for the construction of the engines for the self-propelled variants.\n\nNotable examples of Soviet howitzers include the [[152 mm howitzer M1938 (M-10)|M-10]], [[122 mm howitzer M1938 (M-30)|M-30]] and [[152 mm howitzer M1943 (D-1)|D-1]]. As Soviet howitzers were deployed a lot more than comparable Allied or Axis guns,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} they often had worse \"paper characteristics\"{{clarification needed|date=May 2016}} that were deliberately sacrificed to improve operational performance and the usability of the artillery pieces by the deployed troops.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nSince World War II, most of the artillery pieces adopted by armies for attacking targets on land have combined the traditional characteristics of guns and howitzers\u2014high muzzle velocity, long barrels, long range, multiple charges and maximum elevation angles greater than 45 degrees. The term \"gun-howitzer\" is sometimes used for these (e.g., in Russia); many nations use \"howitzer\", while the UK (and most members of [[The Commonwealth of Nations]]) calls them \"guns\", for example [[L118 Light Gun|Gun, 105&nbsp;mm, Field, L118]].\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:M109BREECH.JPG|thumb|Breech of a US [[M109 howitzer|M109]] self-propelled gun-howitzer]]\n* A [[Self-propelled artillery|self-propelled]] howitzer is mounted on a tracked or wheeled [[motor vehicle]]. In many cases, it is protected by some sort of [[vehicle armour|armor]] so that it superficially resembles a [[tank]]. This armor is designed primarily to protect the crew from shrapnel and small arms fire, not anti-armor weapons.\n* A pack howitzer is a relatively light howitzer that is designed to be easily broken down into several pieces, each of which is small enough to be carried by [[mule]] or [[packhorse|pack-horse]].\n* A mountain howitzer is a relatively light howitzer designed for use in mountainous terrain. Most, but not all, mountain howitzers are also pack howitzers.\n* A [[siege howitzer]] is a howitzer that is designed to be fired from a mounting on a fixed platform of some sort.\n* A field howitzer is a howitzer that is mobile enough to accompany a [[Army|field army]] on campaign. It is, invariably, provided with a wheeled carriage of some sort.\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Canon 155mm TRF1 fh000024.jpg|thumb|French [[TRF1]] 155&nbsp;mm gun-howitzer]]\n{{Main|List of howitzers}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Plunging fire]]\n* [[12-inch coast defense mortar]]\n* [[2B9 Vasilek]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category|Howitzers}}\n* [http://napoleonistyka.atspace.com/artillery_Napoleon.html French Artillery of the Napoleonic Wars]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Howitzers| ]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]", "sha1": "3inuojw16vawekh9csptglwt023zqiy"}}, {"title": "HMMWV", "ns": "0", "id": "14393", "redirect": {"title": "Humvee"}, "revision": {"id": "783864027", "parentid": "407042858", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T04:04:25Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Humvee]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from abbreviation}}\n}}", "sha1": "1ibuagd9wleov53n03m3e8gdvaxavu4"}}, {"title": "Hummer", "ns": "0", "id": "14395", "revision": {"id": "862091786", "parentid": "862091571", "timestamp": "2018-10-02T03:33:00Z", "contributor": {"ip": "123.243.254.39"}, "comment": "/* Licensing */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the consumer brand|the Hummer H1|Hummer H1|the military vehicle|Humvee|other uses|Hummer (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name          = Hummer\n| logo          = Hummer wordmark.svg\n| logo_caption  = \n| image         = 2007 Hummer H3 -- NHTSA.jpg\n| image_caption = Hummer H3\n| type          = [[Division (organization)|Division]]\n| foundation    = {{Start date and age|1992|paren=yes}}\n| successor     = [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]]\n| defunct       = {{Start date and age|2010|05|24|p=yes}}\n| location      = [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], U.S.\n| industry      = [[Automotive industry|Automotive]]\n| products      = [[Sport utility vehicle]]s, [[pickup truck]]s\n| parent         = [[General Motors]]\n| homepage      = {{URL|www.hummer.com}}\n}}\n\n'''Hummer''' was a brand of trucks and [[SUV]]s, first marketed in 1992 when [[AM General]] began selling a civilian version of the M998&nbsp;[[Humvee]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Marketing: AM General |journal=Forbes |date=2002 |volume=170 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZfAdAQAAMAAJ&q=1992:+AM+General+creates+the+first+civilian+version+of+the+truck,+the+$100,000+Hummer.+Arnold+Schwarzenegger+is+among+the+first+buyers |accessdate=7 December 2017|quote=1992: AM General creates the first civilian version of the truck, the $100,000 Hummer.

Although the US Army had let Ford redesign the jeep from the ground up during the 1950s, and the resulting [[M151 jeep]] incorporated significant innovations, it firmly adhered to the original concept\u2014a very compact, lightweight, low profile vehicle, with a folding windshield, that a layman could barely distinguish from the preceding Willys jeeps. The jeeps were shorter than a [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and weighed just over one metric ton, seating three with an {{convert|800|lb|kg|abbr=on}} payload.

Less than a year later, the first prototype was in testing. Chrysler Defense and Teledyne Continental also produced competing designs. In June 1981, the Army awarded AM General a contract for development of several more prototype vehicles to be delivered to the government for another series of tests. The original M998 A0 series had a curb weight of {{convert|5200|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, a payload of {{convert|2500|lbs|kg|abbr=on}}, a {{convert|6.2|L|cuin|abbr=on}} V-8 diesel engine, and a three-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe three companies were chosen to design and build eleven HMMWV prototypes, which covered over 600,000 miles in trials which included off-road courses in desert and arctic conditions.  AM General was awarded an initial contract in 1983 for 2,334 vehicles, the first batch of a five-year contract that would see 55,000 vehicles delivered to the U.S. military, including 39,000 vehicles for the Army; 72,000 vehicles had been delivered to U.S. and foreign customers by the Persian Gulf War of 1991, and 100,000 were delivered by the Humvee's 10th anniversary in 1995.<ref name=\"army-tech30sep14\" /> Ft. Lewis, Washington and the 2nd Battalion 1st Infantry,  9th Infantry Division was the testing unit to employ HMMWV in the new concept of a motorized division. Yakima Training Center in Yakima, Washington was the main testing grounds for HMMWVs from 1985 through December 1991, when the motorized concept was abandoned and the division inactivated.\n\n===Usage in combat===\nHMMWVs first saw combat in [[Operation Just Cause]], the U.S. invasion of [[Panama]] in 1989.\n\nThe HMMWV was designed primarily for personnel and light cargo transport behind front lines, not as a front line fighting vehicle. Like the previous jeep, the basic HMMWV has no armor or protection against [[Weapon of mass destruction|chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear threats]]. Nevertheless, losses were relatively low in [[conventional warfare|conventional operations]], such as the [[Gulf War]]. Vehicles and crews suffered considerable damage and losses during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] in 1993 due to the nature of the urban engagement. However, the chassis survivability allowed the majority of those crews to return to safety, though the HMMWV was never designed to offer protection against intense small arms fire, much less [[machine gun]]s and [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s. With the rise of [[asymmetric warfare]] and [[low intensity conflict]]s, the HMMWV was pressed into service in urban combat roles for which it was not originally intended.<ref>[http://www.museum-mm.org/high-mobility-multipurpose-wheeled-vehicle-hmmwv/ HMMWV] museum-mm.org</ref>\n\nAfter [[Unified Task Force|Operation Restore Hope]] in [[Somalia]], the military recognized a need for a more protected HMMWV and AM General developed the M1114, an armored HMMWV to withstand small arms fire. The M1114 has been in production since 1996, seeing limited use in the [[Balkans]] before deployment to the [[Middle East]]. This design is superior to the M998 with a larger, more powerful [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engine, [[air conditioning]], and a strengthened [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system. More importantly, it boasts a fully [[vehicle armor|armored]] passenger area protected by hardened steel and [[Bulletproof glass|bullet-resistant glass]]. With the increase in direct attacks and guerrilla warfare in Iraq, AM General diverted the majority of its manufacturing power to producing these vehicles.\n\nHumvees were sent into [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] following the [[9/11 terrorist attacks]], where they proved invaluable during initial operations. In the early years before IEDs became prevalent, the vehicle was liked by troops for its ability to access rough, mountainous terrain. Some soldiers would remove features from Humvees, including what little armor it had and sometimes even entire doors, to make them lighter and more maneuverable for off-road conditions and to increase visibility. With the onset of the [[Iraq War]], Humvees proved very vulnerable to IEDs; in the first four months of 2006, 67 U.S. troops died in Humvees. To increase protection, the U.S. military hastily added-on armor kits to the vehicles. Although this somewhat improved survivability, bolting on armor made the Humvee an \"ungainly beast\", increasing weight and putting strain on the chassis, which led to unreliability.

The HMMWV has evolved several times since its introduction and was used in tactical roles for which it was never originally intended. The military pursued several initiatives to replace it, both in the short and long terms. The short term replacement efforts utilized [[commercial off-the-shelf]] vehicles as part of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) program. These vehicles were procured to replace Humvees in combat theaters. The long term replacement for the Humvee is the JLTV which is designed from the ground up.  The [[Future Tactical Truck Systems]] (FTTS) program was initiated to make an analysis of potential requirements for a Humvee replacement. Various prototype vehicles such as the [[MillenWorks Light Utility Vehicle]], and the [[ULTRA AP]] have been constructed as part of these efforts. The JLTV contract was awarded to Oshkosh in August 2015.<ref name=\"Oshkosh JLTV Win\">{{cite web |publisher= Breaking Defense|url= http://breakingdefense.com/2015/08/oshkosh-beats-lockheed-am-general-for-historic-jltv-win/|title= Oshkosh Beats Lockheed, AM General For Historic JLTV Win |accessdate= August 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Marine Corps issued a [[request for proposal]]s (RFP) in 2013 for its Humvee sustainment modification initiative to upgrade 6,700 expanded capacity vehicles (ECVs). The Marines plan to field the JLTV, but do not have enough funding to completely replace all Humvees, so they decided to continue sustaining their fleet. Key areas of improvement include upgrades to the suspension to reduce the amount of force transferred to the chassis, upgrading the engine and transmission for better fuel efficiency, enhancements to the cooling system to prevent overheating, a central tire inflation system to improve off-road mobility and ride quality, and increased underbody survivability. Testing of upgraded Humvees was to occur in 2014, with production and installation occurring from 2015 through 2018. Older A2 series Humvees make up half the current fleet, and 4,000 are to be disposed of through [[foreign military sales]] and transfers. By 2017, the Marines' light tactical vehicle fleet is to consist of 3,500 A2 series Humvees, 9,500 ECV Humvees, and 5,000 JLTVs, with 18,000 vehicles in total. Humvees in service with the Marine Corps will be upgraded through 2030.<ref>[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2013/February/Pages/MarineHumveeUpgradeSeenasInevitable.aspx Marine Humvee Upgrade Seen as Inevitable] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903231929/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2013/February/Pages/MarineHumveeUpgradeSeenasInevitable.aspx |date=3 September 2015 }} \u2013 Nationaldefensemagazine.org, February 2013</ref> The Marines shelved the Humvee modernization effort in March 2015 due to budget cuts.<ref>[http://www.dodbuzz.com/2015/03/20/marines-shelve-humvee-upgrades-due-to-budget-cuts/ Marines Shelve Humvee Upgrades Due to Budget Cuts] \u2013 DoDBuzz.com, 20 March 2015</ref>\n\nSeveral companies are offering modifications to maintain the remaining U.S. military Humvee fleets.

If converted to a UGV, the vehicle could serve as a mobile scout vehicle with armor features removed to enhance mobility and terrain accessibility, since there would be no occupants needed to protect.  Because there will still be tens of thousands of Humvees in the U.S. inventory after the JLTV enters service, it could be a low-cost way to build an unmanned combat vehicle fleet.  Autonomy features would allow the Humvees to drive themselves and one soldier to control a \"swarm\" of several vehicles.<ref name=\"army-tech30sep14\" />\n\nAlthough the Army plans to buy 49,100 JLTVs and the Marine Corps 5,500, they are not a one-for-one replacement for the Humvee and both services will still be left operating large fleets.  For the Marines, 69 JLTVs will replace the 74 Humvees in all active infantry battalions to cover its expeditionary forces. The Marine JLTV order is planned to be completed by 2022, leaving the remainder of the Corps' 13,000-strong Humvee force scattered around support organizations while soft-skinned Humvees will provide support behind the forward deployed [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]]. The Army does not plan to replace Humvees in the [[Army National Guard]], and is considering options on how many of its 120,000 vehicles will be replaced, sustained, or modernized. Even if half of the force is replaced by JLTVs, the entire planned order will not be complete until 2040. If upgrades are chosen for the remaining Humvees, the cost would likely have to not exceed $100,000 per vehicle.<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/land/vehicles/2015/08/29/oshkosh-awaits-protests-jltv-win/71325838/ Oshkosh Awaits Protests After JLTV Win] \u2013  Defensenews.com, 29 August 2015</ref> The Humvee is expected to remain in U.S. military service until at least 2050.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/am-general-secures-six-year-4283-million-contract-to-provide-the-army-with-m997a3-hmmwv-configured-ambulances-300139298.html AM General Secures Six-Year, $428.3 Million Contract To Provide The Army With M997A3 HMMWV Configured Ambulances] \u2013 PRNewswiew.com, 8 September 2015</ref> Ambulance variants of the Humvee will especially remain in active use, as the JLTV couldn't be modified to serve as one due to weight issues.<ref>[http://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/06/14/pentagon-selects-1st-army-marine-units-receive-jltv.html?ESRC=todayinmil.sm Pentagon Selects 1st Army, Marine Units to Receive JLTV] \u2013 Military.com, 14 June 2017</ref>\n\n==Design features==\n[[File:USAFHMMWV.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] airman in [[Southwest Asia]] stands in the ringmount of a FRAG 6-reinforced HMMWV,  2010.]]\n\nThe Humvee seats 4 with an available fully enclosed metal cabin with a vertical windshield.

Recent improvements have also led to the development of the M1151 model, which quickly rendered the previous models obsolete. By replacing the M1114, M1116, and earlier armored HMMWV types with a single model, the U.S. Army hopes to lower maintenance costs.\n\nThe latest iteration of the Humvee series can be seen in the M1151A1 and later up-armored A1-versions.  It has a stronger suspension and larger 6.5 liter turbo-diesel engine to accommodate the weight of up to {{convert|680|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of additional armor.  The armor protection can be installed or taken off depending on the operating environment, so the vehicles can move more efficiently without armor when there is no threat of attack.  There is some underbody armor that moderately protects against mines and roadside bombs.  Other improvements include Vehicle Emergency Escape (VEE) windows that can be quickly removed so troops inside can escape in the event of a rollover, jammed door, or the vehicle catching fire, and a blast chimney that vents the force of a bomb blast upwards and away from the occupants.  The M1151A1 has a crew of four, can carry {{convert|2,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of payload, and can tow a {{convert|4,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} load.

While some have been transferred to domestic law enforcement agencies, this is the first time the military vehicles have been made available for civilian ownership. The idea is to sell them with starting bids at $10,000 each, for off-road use only, rather than simply scrapping them as a way to save money and repurpose them.  M998, M998A1, M1038, and M1038A1 model Humvees are available, which are out of U.S. service and lack armor.  AM General has been opposed to resale of military Humvees to the general public, primarily because surplus government vehicles would have cut into sales related to the civilian Hummer model, whose production ended in 2010.<ref>[http://www.armytimes.com/story/military/tech/2014/12/12/humvee-auctions-to-public-a-first/20300263/ Surplus Humvee auctions to public a first for DoD] \u2013 Armytimes.com, 12 December 2014</ref> The first sales from auction occurred on 17 December 2014 for 25 of the Humvees. Bids ranged from $21,500 for a 1989 M1038 to $41,000 for a 1994 AM General M998A1. The average bid was around $30,000 and the sale of the 25 vehicles netted $744,000 total.<ref>[http://defensetech.org/2014/12/17/humvees-sell-for-up-to-42k-in-first-public-auction-of-military-truck/ Humvees Sell for up to $42K in First Public Auction of Military Truck] \u2013 Defensetech.org, 17 December 2014</ref>\n\n==Replicas==\nKits have been produced for the general market to turn a [[sedan (car)|sedan]] into a Humvee lookalike.

Rather than speculate on the material nature of the planets and stars, the ancients charted the relative positions of celestial bodies, often inferring their influence on human society. This demonstrates how ancient investigators generally employed a holistic  intuition, assuming the interconnectedness of all things, whereas modern science rejects such conceptual leaps.\n\nBasic facts about human physiology were known in some places, and [[alchemy]] was practiced in several civilizations.<ref>See Homer's ''Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D4%3Acard%3D219 4.227\u2013232] '[The Egyptians] are of the race of [[Paean (god)|Paeeon]] [(physician to the gods)]'</ref><ref>See, for example [[Joseph Needham]] (1974, 1976, 1980, 1983) and his co-authors, ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'', '''V''', Cambridge University Press, specifically:\n* Joseph Needham and Lu Gwei-djen (1974), '''V.2 Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Magisteries of Gold and Immortality'''\n* Joseph Needham, Ho Ping-Yu [Ho Peng-Yoke], and Lu Gwei-djen (1976),  '''V.3 Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Historical Survey, from Cinnabar Elixirs to Synthetic Insulin'''\n* Joseph Needham, Lu Gwei-djen, and Nathan Sivin (1980), '''V.4 Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Apparatus and Theory'''\n* Joseph Needham and Lu Gwei-djen (1983), '''V.5 Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Physiological Alchemy'''</ref> Considerable observation of [[macroscopic]] flora and fauna was also performed.\n\n===Ancient Near East===\n{{Further|Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian medicine}}\n[[File:Divinatory livers Louvre AO19837.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|Clay models of animal livers dating between the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries BCE, found in the royal palace at [[Mari, Syria|Mari]]]]\n\nThe ancient Mesopotamians had no distinction between \"rational science\" and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]].<ref name=\"Farber1995\">{{cite journal|last=Farber|first=Walter|date=1995|title=Witchcraft, Magic, and Divination in Ancient Mesopotamia|url=http://wsrp.usc.edu/information/REL499_2011/Witchcraft,%20Magic,%20and%20Divination%20in%20Ancient%20Mesopotamia.pdf|journal=Civilizations of the Ancient Near East|volume=3|location=New York City, New York|publisher=Charles Schribner\u2019s Sons, MacMillan Library Reference USA, Simon & Schuster MacMillan|pages=1891\u20131908|isbn=9780684192796|ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=\"Abusch\">{{cite book|last=Abusch|first=Tzvi|title=Mesopotamian Witchcraft: Towards a History and Understanding of Babylonian Witchcraft Beliefs and Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mesopotamian_Witchcraft.html?id=Slhv-0ewLHwC|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|publisher=Brill|year=2002|isbn=9789004123878|page=56}}</ref><ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Michael|date=1995|title=Israel's Divine Healer|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Israel_s_Divine_Healer.html?id=KCzmNKnLqMkC|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=9780310200291|page=42}}</ref> When a person became ill, doctors prescribed magical formulas to be recited as well as medicinal treatments.<ref name=\"Farber1995\"/><ref name=\"Abusch\"/><ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"McIntosh2005\">{{cite book|last1=McIntosh|first1=Jane R.|title=Ancient Mesopotamia: New Perspectives|date=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California, Denver, Colorado, and Oxford, England|isbn=1-57607-966-X|pages=273\u2013276|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9veK7E2JwkUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=science+in+ancient+Mesopotamia&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiPlLqz_4DbAhXH1IMKHQ6ACooQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&q=science&f=false|ref=harv}}</ref> The earliest medical prescriptions appear in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] during the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] ({{circa}} 2112 BC \u2013 {{circa}} 2004 BC).<ref>{{cite journal |title=Medicine, Surgery, and Public Health in Ancient Mesopotamia |author=R D.

[[Metallurgy]] required scientific knowledge about the properties of metals. Nonetheless, the Mesopotamians seem to have had little interest in gathering information about the natural world for the mere sake of gathering information and were far more interested in studying the manner in which the gods had ordered the universe. Biology of non-human organisms was generally only written about in the context of mainstream academic disciplines. [[Animal physiology]] was studied extensively for the purpose of [[divination]]; the anatomy of the [[liver]], which was seen as an important organ in [[haruspicy]], was studied in particularly intensive detail.

Even today, astronomical periods identified by Mesopotamian proto-scientists are still widely used in Western calendars such as the [[solar year]] and the [[lunar month]]. Using these data they developed arithmetical methods to compute the changing length of daylight in the course of the year and to predict the appearances and disappearances of the Moon and planets and eclipses of the Sun and Moon.  Only a few astronomers' names are known, such as that of [[Kidinnu]], a [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldean]] astronomer and mathematician. Kiddinu's value for the solar year is in use for today's calendars.

The ancient people who are considered the first ''[[scientists]]'' may have thought of themselves as ''natural philosophers'', as practitioners of a skilled profession (for example, physicians), or as followers of a religious tradition (for example, temple healers).\n\nThe earliest Greek philosophers, known as the [[pre-Socratics]],<ref>{{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|pp=3,37}} called the pre-Socratics the transition from ''[[Mythology|mythos]]'' to ''[[logos]]''</ref> provided competing answers to the question found in the myths of their neighbors: \"How did the ordered [[cosmos]] in which we live come to be?\"<ref>[[F.

Meanwhile, the introduction of printing was to have great effect on European society. The facilitated dissemination of the printed word democratized learning and allowed ideas such as [[algebra]] to propagate more rapidly. These developments paved the way for the [[Scientific Revolution]], where scientific inquiry, halted at the start of the Black Death, resumed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Impact of science in Europe==<!--[[New science]] redirects here-->\n{{Main|Scientific revolution|Age of Enlightenment}}\n{{See also|Continuity thesis|Decline of Western alchemy|Natural magic}}\n[[File:Justus Sustermans - Portrait of Galileo Galilei, 1636.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Galileo Galilei]], father of modern science.<ref name=\"Einstein\">{{cite book|last=Weidhorn|first=Manfred|title=The Person of the Millennium: The Unique Impact of Galileo on World History|year=2005|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=0-595-36877-8|page=155}}</ref>]]\n\nThe renewal of learning in Europe began with 12th century [[Scholasticism]]. The [[Northern Renaissance]] showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristoteleian natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine).<ref>[[Allen Debus]], ''Man and Nature in the Renaissance'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1978).</ref> Thus modern science in Europe was resumed in a period of great upheaval: the [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Counter-Reformation]]; the discovery of the Americas by [[Christopher Columbus]]; the [[Fall of Constantinople]]; but also the re-discovery of Aristotle during the Scholastic period presaged large social and political changes. Thus, a suitable environment was created in which it became possible to question scientific doctrine, in much the same way that [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] questioned religious doctrine. The works of [[Ptolemy]] (astronomy) and [[Galen]] (medicine) were found not always to match everyday observations. Work by [[Vesalius]] on human cadavers found problems with the Galenic view of anatomy.<ref>Precise titles of these landmark books can be found in the collections of the [[Library of Congress]]. A list of these titles can be found in {{harvnb|Bruno|1989}}</ref>\n\n[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton]] initiated [[classical mechanics]] in [[physics]].]]\n\nThe willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements, now known as the [[Scientific Revolution]]. The Scientific Revolution is traditionally held by most historians to have begun in 1543, when the books ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' (''On the Workings of the Human Body'') by [[Andreas Vesalius]], and also ''[[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium|De Revolutionibus]]'', by the astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], were first printed. The thesis of Copernicus' book was that the Earth moved around the Sun. The period culminated with the publication of the ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' in 1687 by [[Isaac Newton]], representative of the unprecedented growth of [[antiquarian science book|scientific publications]] throughout Europe.\n\nOther significant scientific advances were made during this time by [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Edmond Halley]], [[Robert Hooke]], [[Christiaan Huygens]], [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and [[Blaise Pascal]]. In philosophy, major contributions were made by [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]], Sir [[Thomas Browne]], [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]]. The scientific method was also better developed as the modern way of thinking emphasized experimentation and reason over traditional considerations.\n\n===Age of Enlightenment===\n{{Main|Science in the Age of Enlightenment}}\n{{Distinguished men of science of Great Britain 1806-7|align=right}}\n[[File:Painting of Volta by Bertini (photo).jpeg|thumb|[[Alessandro Volta]] demonstrates the first [[Electrochemical cell|electrical cell]] to [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] in 1801.]]\n\nThe [[Age of Enlightenment]] was a European affair. The 17th century brought decisive steps towards modern science, which accelerated during the 18th century. Directly based on the works<ref>{{harvnb|Heilbron|2003}}, 741</ref> of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Descartes]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], the way was now clear to the development of modern [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[technology]]\nby the generation of [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706\u20131790), [[Leonhard Euler]] (1707\u20131783), [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] (1711\u20131765) and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1717\u20131783). [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'', published between 1751 and 1772 brought this new understanding to a wider audience. The impact of this process was not limited to science and technology, but affected [[history of philosophy|philosophy]] ([[Immanuel Kant]], [[David Hume]]), [[history of religion|religion]] (the increasingly significant impact of [[Relationship between religion and science|science upon religion]]), and society and politics in general ([[Adam Smith]], [[Voltaire]]). The [[early modern period]] is seen as a flowering of the European Renaissance, in what is often known as the [[Scientific Revolution]], viewed as a foundation of [[#Modern science|modern science]].<ref>See, for example, pp 741\u2013744 of {{harvnb|Heilbron|2003}}</ref>\n\n===Romanticism in science===\n{{Main|Romanticism in science}}\nThe Romantic Movement of the early 19th century reshaped science by opening up new pursuits unexpected in the classical approaches of the Enlightenment. Major breakthroughs came in biology, especially in [[Darwinism|Darwin's theory of evolution]], as well as physics (electromagnetism), mathematics (non-Euclidean geometry, group theory) and chemistry (organic chemistry).  The decline of Romanticism occurred because a new movement, [[Positivism]], began to take hold of the ideals of the intellectuals after 1840 and lasted until about 1880.\n\n==Modern science==\nThe [[scientific revolution]] established science as a source for the growth of knowledge.{{clarify|reason=a source for the growth of knowledge? It is knowledge.|date=December 2016}}<ref>{{harvnb|Heilbron|2003}}, 741\u2013743</ref> During the 19th century, the practice of science became professionalized and institutionalized in ways that continued through the 20th century. As the role of scientific knowledge grew in society, it became incorporated with many aspects of the functioning of nation-states.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Natural sciences===\n====Physics====\n{{Main|History of physics}}\n[[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Albert Einstein]] ]]\n[[File:James Clerk Maxwell profile.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]]]\n\nThe scientific revolution is a convenient boundary between ancient thought and classical physics. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] revived the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the solar system described by [[Aristarchus of Samos]]. This was followed by the first known model of planetary motion given by [[Johannes Kepler]] in the early 17th century, which proposed that the planets follow [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbits, with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] (\"''Father of Modern Physics''\") also made use of experiments to validate physical theories, a key element of the scientific method. [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] did some of the earliest experiments with electricity and magnetism, establishing that the Earth itself is magnetic.\n\nIn 1687, [[Isaac Newton]] published the ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', detailing two comprehensive and successful physical theories: [[Newton's laws of motion]], which led to classical mechanics; and [[gravity|Newton's Law of Gravitation]], which describes the fundamental force of gravity.\n\nDuring the late 18th and early 19th century, the behavior of electricity and magnetism was studied by [[Luigi Galvani]], [[Giovanni Aldini]], [[Alessandro Volta]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Georg Ohm]], and others. These studies led to the unification of the two phenomena into a single theory of [[electromagnetism]], by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (known as [[Maxwell's equations]]).\n\nThe beginning of the 20th century brought the start of a revolution in physics. The long-held theories of Newton were shown not to be correct in all circumstances. Beginning in 1900, [[Max Planck]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Niels Bohr]] and others developed quantum theories to explain various anomalous experimental results, by introducing discrete energy levels. Not only did quantum mechanics show that the laws of motion did not hold on small scales, but even more disturbingly, the theory of [[general relativity]], proposed by Einstein in 1915, showed that the fixed background of [[spacetime]], on which both [[Newtonian mechanics]] and [[special relativity]] depended, could not exist. In 1925, [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] formulated [[quantum mechanics]], which explained the preceding quantum theories. The observation by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929 that the speed at which galaxies recede positively correlates with their distance, led to the understanding that the universe is expanding, and the formulation of the [[Big Bang]] theory by [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]].\n\n[[File:Trinity Test Fireball 25ms.jpg|thumb|The [[atomic bomb]] ushered in \"[[Big Science]]\" in [[physics]].]]\n\nIn 1938 [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] discovered [[nuclear fission]] with radiochemical methods, and in 1939 [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Robert Frisch]] wrote the first theoretical interpretation of the fission process, which was later improved by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[John A. Wheeler]]. Further developments took place during World War II, which led to the practical application of [[radar]] and the development and use of the [[atomic bomb]]. Around this time, [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] was recruited by the [[Manhattan Project]] to help develop a process for separating uranium metal into U-235 and U-238 isotopes by [[Gaseous diffusion]].<ref>Ronald K.

Lawrence]] in the 1930s, physics in the postwar period entered into a phase of what historians have called \"[[Big Science]]\", requiring massive machines, budgets, and laboratories in order to test their theories and move into new frontiers. The primary patron of physics became state governments, who recognized that the support of \"basic\" research could often lead to technologies useful to both military and industrial applications.\n\nCurrently, general relativity and quantum mechanics are inconsistent with each other, and efforts are underway to unify the two.\n\n====Chemistry====\n{{Main|History of chemistry}}\n[[File:DIMendeleevCab.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dmitri Mendeleev]]]]\nModern chemistry emerged from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries through the material practices and theories promoted by alchemy, medicine, manufacturing and mining.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Eddy, Matthew Daniel |editor2= Mauskopf, Seymour |editor3=Newman, William R. |title=Chemical Knowledge in the Early Modern World|date=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=1\u201315|url=https://www.academia.edu/6629576/_with_Seymour_H._Mauskopf_and_William_R._Newman_An_Introduction_to_Chemical_Knowledge_in_the_Early_Modern_World_Osiris_26_2014_1-15}}</ref>  A decisive moment came when 'chemistry' was distinguished from [[alchemy]] by [[Robert Boyle]] in his work ''The Sceptical Chymist'', in 1661; although the alchemical tradition continued for some time after his work.  Other important steps included the gravimetric experimental practices of medical chemists like [[William Cullen]], [[Joseph Black]], [[Torbern Bergman]] and [[Pierre Macquer]] and through the work of [[Antoine Lavoisier]] ([[Father or mother of something|''Father of Modern Chemistry'']]) on [[oxygen]] and the law of [[conservation of mass]], which refuted [[phlogiston theory]]. The theory that all matter is made of atoms, which are the smallest constituents of matter that cannot be broken down without losing the basic chemical and physical properties of that matter, was provided by [[John Dalton]] in 1803, although the question took a hundred years to settle as proven. Dalton also formulated the law of mass relationships. In 1869, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] composed his [[periodic table]] of elements on the basis of Dalton's discoveries.\n\nThe synthesis of [[urea]] by [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]] opened a new research field, [[organic chemistry]], and by the end of the 19th century, scientists were able to synthesize hundreds of organic compounds. The later part of the 19th century saw the exploitation of the Earth's petrochemicals, after the exhaustion of the oil supply from [[whaling]]. By the 20th century, systematic production of refined materials provided a ready supply of products which provided not only energy, but also synthetic materials for clothing, medicine, and everyday disposable resources. Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms resulted in [[physiological chemistry]], the precursor to [[biochemistry]]. The 20th century also saw the integration of physics and chemistry, with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom. [[Linus Pauling]]'s book on ''The Nature of the Chemical Bond'' used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce [[bond angle]]s in ever-more complicated molecules. Pauling's work culminated in the physical modelling of [[DNA]], ''the secret of life'' (in the words of [[Francis Crick]], 1953). In the same year, the [[Miller\u2013Urey experiment]] demonstrated in a simulation of primordial processes, that basic constituents of proteins, simple [[amino acid]]s, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules.\n\n====Geology====\n{{Main|History of geology}}\nGeology existed as a cloud of isolated, disconnected ideas about rocks, minerals, and landforms long before it became a coherent science. [[Theophrastus]]' work on rocks, ''Peri lith\u014dn'', remained authoritative for millennia: its interpretation of fossils was not overturned until after the Scientific Revolution. Chinese polymath [[Shen Kua]] (1031\u20131095) first formulated hypotheses for the process of land formation. Based on his observation of fossils in a geological [[stratum]] in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he deduced that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] of silt.\n\n[[File:Wegener.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plate tectonics]]\u2014[[seafloor spreading]] and [[continental drift]] illustrated on a relief globe]]\n\nGeology did not undergo systematic restructuring during the [[Scientific Revolution]], but individual theorists made important contributions. [[Robert Hooke]], for example, formulated a theory of earthquakes, and [[Nicholas Steno]] developed the theory of [[Law of superposition|superposition]] and argued that [[fossils]] were the remains of once-living creatures. Beginning with [[Thomas Burnet]]'s ''Sacred Theory of the Earth'' in 1681, natural philosophers began to explore the idea that the Earth had changed over time. Burnet and his contemporaries interpreted Earth's past in terms of events described in the Bible, but their work laid the intellectual foundations for secular interpretations of Earth history.\n\n[[File:Hutton James portrait Raeburn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Hutton]], the father of modern geology]]\n\nModern geology, like modern chemistry, gradually evolved during the 18th and early 19th centuries. [[Beno\u00eet de Maillet]] and the [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]] saw the Earth as much older than the 6,000 years envisioned by biblical scholars. [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Guettard]] and [[Nicolas Desmarest]] hiked central France and recorded their observations on some of the first geological maps.  Aided by chemical experimentation, naturalists such as Scotland's [[John Walker (natural historian)|John Walker]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Matthew Daniel Eddy|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750\u20131800|date=2008|publisher=Ashgate|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_}}</ref> Sweden's Torbern Bergman, and Germany's [[Abraham Werner]] created comprehensive classification systems for rocks and minerals\u2014a collective achievement that transformed geology into a cutting edge field by the end of the eighteenth century.  These early geologists also proposed a generalized interpretations of Earth history that led [[James Hutton]], [[Georges Cuvier]] and [[Alexandre Brongniart]], following in the steps of  [[Nicolas Steno|Steno]], to argue that layers of rock could be dated by the fossils they contained: a principle first applied to the geology of the Paris Basin. The use of [[index fossil]]s became a powerful tool for making geological maps, because it allowed geologists to correlate the rocks in one locality with those of similar age in other, distant localities. Over the first half of the 19th century, geologists such as [[Charles Lyell]], [[Adam Sedgwick]], and [[Roderick Murchison]] applied the new technique to rocks throughout Europe and eastern North America, setting the stage for more detailed, government-funded mapping projects in later decades.\n\nMidway through the 19th century, the focus of geology shifted from description and classification to attempts to understand ''how'' the surface of the Earth had changed. The first comprehensive theories of mountain building were proposed during this period, as were the first modern theories of earthquakes and volcanoes. [[Louis Agassiz]] and others established the reality of continent-covering [[ice age]]s, and \"fluvialists\" like [[Andrew Crombie Ramsay]] argued that river valleys were formed, over millions of years by the rivers that flow through them. After the discovery of [[radioactivity]], [[radiometric dating]] methods were developed, starting in the 20th century. [[Alfred Wegener]]'s theory of \"continental drift\" was widely dismissed when he proposed it in the 1910s, but new data gathered in the 1950s and 1960s led to the theory of [[plate tectonics]], which provided a plausible mechanism for it. Plate tectonics also provided a unified explanation for a wide range of seemingly unrelated geological phenomena. Since 1970 it has served as the unifying principle in geology.\n\nGeologists' embrace of [[plate tectonics]] became part of a broadening of the field from a study of rocks into a study of the Earth as a planet. Other elements of this transformation include: geophysical studies of the interior of the Earth, the grouping of geology with [[meteorology]] and [[oceanography]] as one of the \"earth sciences\", and comparisons of Earth and the solar system's other rocky planets.\n\n====Astronomy====\n{{Main|History of astronomy}}\n[[Aristarchus of Samos]] published [[Aristarchus On the Sizes and Distances|work]] on how to determine the sizes and distances of the Sun and the Moon, and [[Eratosthenes]] used this work to figure the size of the Earth.

[[Roger Boesche]] describes the ''Artha\u015b\u0101stra'' as \"a book of political realism, a book analysing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good.\"<ref>{{cite book| authorlink= Roger Boesche | last=Boesche | first=Roger | title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra | year=2002 | publisher=Lexington Books | isbn=0-7391-0401-2 | pages=17}}</ref>\n\nDuring the rule of Rome, famous historians such as [[Polybius]], [[Livy]] and [[Plutarch]] documented the rise of the [[Roman Republic]], and the organization and histories of other nations, while [[Politician|statesmen]] like [[Julius Caesar]], [[Cicero]] and others provided us with examples of the politics of the republic and Rome's empire and wars. The study of politics during this age was oriented toward understanding history, understanding methods of governing, and describing the operation of governments.\n\nWith the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], there arose a more diffuse arena for political studies. The rise of [[monotheism]] and, particularly for the Western tradition, [[Christianity]], brought to light a new space for politics and political action.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} During the [[Middle Ages]], the study of politics was widespread in the churches and courts. Works such as [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' synthesized current philosophies and political traditions with those of [[Christianity]], redefining the borders between what was religious and what was political. Most of the political questions surrounding the relationship between [[Religion and politics|Church and State]] were clarified and contested in this period.\n\nIn the Middle East and later other [[Islam]]ic areas, works such as the [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]] and Epic of Kings by [[Ferdowsi]] provided evidence of political analysis, while the Islamic [[Aristotelians]] such as [[Avicenna]] and later [[Maimonides]] and [[Averroes]], continued [[Aristotle]]'s tradition of analysis and [[empiricism]], writing commentaries on Aristotle's works.\n\nDuring the [[Italian Renaissance]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] established the emphasis of modern political science on direct [[empirical]] [[observation]] of political [[institution]]s and actors. Later, the expansion of the scientific paradigm during the [[the Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] further pushed the study of politics beyond normative determinations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In particular, the study of [[statistics]], to study the subjects of the [[Sovereign state|state]], has been applied to [[Opinion poll|polling]] and [[voting]].\n\nIn the 20th century, the study of ideology, behaviouralism and international relations led to a multitude of 'pol-sci' subdisciplines including [[rational choice theory]], [[voting theory]], [[game theory]] (also used in economics), [[psephology]], [[political geography]]/[[geopolitics]], [[political psychology]]/[[political sociology]], [[political economy]], [[policy analysis]], [[public administration]], comparative political analysis and [[peace studies]]/conflict analysis.\n\n====Linguistics====\n{{Main|History of linguistics}}\n[[Historical linguistics]] emerged as an independent field of study at the end of the 18th century. [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] proposed that [[Sanskrit]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], and [[Celtic languages]] all shared a common base. After Jones, an effort to catalog all languages of the world was made throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century. Publication of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''[[Cours de linguistique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale]]'' created the development of [[descriptive linguistics]]. Descriptive linguistics, and the related [[structuralism]] movement caused linguistics to focus on how language changes over time, instead of just describing the differences between languages. [[Noam Chomsky]] further diversified linguistics with the development of [[generative linguistics]] in the 1950s. His effort is based upon a mathematical model of language that allows for the description and prediction of valid [[syntax]]. Additional specialties such as [[sociolinguistics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], and [[computational linguistics]] have emerged from collaboration between linguistics and other disciplines.\n\n====Economics====\n{{Main|History of economics}}\n[[File:Supply-demand-P.png|thumb|right|The [[supply and demand]] model]]\n[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adam Smith]] wrote ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', the first modern work of economics]]\nThe basis for [[classical economics]] forms [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776. Smith criticized [[mercantilism]], advocating a system of free trade with [[division of labour]]. He postulated an \"[[invisible hand]]\" that regulated economic systems made up of actors guided only by self-interest. [[Karl Marx]] developed an alternative economic theory, called [[Marxian economics]]. Marxian economics is based on the [[labor theory of value]] and assumes the value of good to be based on the amount of labor required to produce it. Under this assumption, [[capitalism]] was based on employers not paying the full value of workers labor to create profit. The [[Austrian School]] responded to Marxian economics by viewing [[entrepreneurship]] as driving force of economic development. This replaced the labor theory of value by a system of [[supply and demand]].\n\nIn the 1920s, [[John Maynard Keynes]] prompted a division between [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]]. Under [[Keynesian economics]] macroeconomic trends can overwhelm economic choices made by individuals. Governments should promote [[aggregate demand]] for goods as a means to encourage economic expansion. Following World War II, [[Milton Friedman]] created the concept of [[monetarism]]. Monetarism focuses on using the supply and demand of money as a method for controlling economic activity. In the 1970s, monetarism has adapted into [[supply-side economics]] which advocates reducing taxes as a means to increase the amount of money available for economic expansion.\n\nOther modern schools of economic thought are [[New Classical economics]] and [[New Keynesian economics]]. New Classical economics was developed in the 1970s, emphasizing solid microeconomics as the basis for macroeconomic growth. New Keynesian economics was created partially in response to New Classical economics, and deals with how inefficiencies in the market create a need for control by a central bank or government.\n\nThe above \"history of economics\" reflects modern economic textbooks and this means that the last stage of a science is represented as the culmination of its history ([[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn]], 1962). The \"[[invisible hand]]\" mentioned in a lost page in the middle of a chapter in the middle of the \"[[Wealth of Nations]]\", 1776, advances as Smith's central message.{{clarify|date=July 2015}} It is played down that this \"invisible hand\" acts only \"frequently\" and that it is \"no part of his [the individual's] intentions\" because competition leads to lower prices by imitating \"his\" invention. That this \"invisible hand\" prefers \"the support of domestic to foreign industry\" is cleansed\u2014often without indication that part of the citation is truncated.<ref>Compare Smith's original phrase with [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson's]] quotation of it. In brackets what Samuelson curtailed without indication and without giving a reference:\n\"[As] every individual \u2026 [therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed,] neither intends to promote the general [Smith said \"public\"] interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. [By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry,] he intends only his own security, [and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only] his own gain; and he is in this, [as in many other cases,] led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. [Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.] By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it\" Samuelson, Paul A./Nordhaus, William D., 1989, [[Economics (textbook)|''Economics'']], 13th edition, N.Y. et al.: McGraw-Hill, p. 825; Smith, Adam, 1937, ''The Wealth of Nations'', N.Y.: Random House, p. 423</ref> The opening passage of the \"Wealth\" containing Smith's message is never mentioned as it cannot be integrated into modern theory: \"Wealth\" depends on the division of labour which changes with market volume and on the proportion of productive to [[Unproductive labor]].\n\n====Psychology====\n{{Main|History of psychology}}\nThe end of the 19th century marks the start of psychology as a scientific enterprise. The year 1879 is commonly seen as the start of psychology as an independent field of study. In that year [[Wilhelm Wundt]] founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research (in [[Leipzig]]). Other important early contributors to the field include [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (a pioneer in memory studies), [[Ivan Pavlov]] (who discovered [[classical conditioning]]), [[William James]], and [[Sigmund Freud]]. Freud's influence has been enormous, though more as cultural icon than a force in scientific psychology.\n\nThe 20th century saw a rejection of Freud's theories as being too unscientific, and a reaction against [[Edward Titchener]]'s atomistic approach of the mind. This led to the formulation of [[behaviorism]] by [[John B. Watson]], which was popularized by [[B.F. Skinner]]. Behaviorism proposed [[epistemology|epistemologically]] limiting psychological study to overt behavior, since that could be reliably measured. Scientific knowledge of the \"mind\" was considered too metaphysical, hence impossible to achieve.\n\nThe final decades of the 20th century have seen the rise of a new interdisciplinary approach to studying human psychology, known collectively as [[cognitive science]]. Cognitive science again considers the mind as a subject for investigation, using the tools of [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[computer science]], [[philosophy]], and [[neurobiology]]. New methods of visualizing the activity of the brain, such as [[PET scan]]s and [[CAT scan]]s, began to exert their influence as well, leading some researchers to investigate the mind by investigating the brain, rather than cognition. These new forms of investigation assume that a wide understanding of the human mind is possible, and that such an understanding may be applied to other research domains, such as [[artificial intelligence]].\n\n====Sociology====\n{{Main|History of sociology}}\n[[Ibn Khaldun]] can be regarded as the earliest scientific systematic sociologist.<ref>Muhammed Abdullah Enan, ''Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works'', The Other Press, 2007, pp. 104\u2013105. {{ISBN|983-9541-53-6}}.</ref> The modern sociology emerged in the early 19th century as the academic response to the modernization of the world. Among many early sociologists (e.g., [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]]), the aim of sociology was in [[Structural functionalism|structuralism]], understanding the cohesion of social groups, and developing an \"antidote\" to social disintegration. [[Max Weber]] was concerned with the modernization of society through the concept of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]], which he believed would trap individuals in an \"iron cage\" of rational thought. Some sociologists, including [[Georg Simmel]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], utilized more [[microsociology|microsociological]], qualitative analyses. This microlevel approach played an important role in American sociology, with the theories of [[George Herbert Mead]] and his student [[Herbert Blumer]] resulting in the creation of the [[symbolic interactionism]] approach to sociology.\n\nIn particular, just Auguste Comte, illustrated with his work the transition from a theological to a metaphysical stage and, from this, to a positive stage. Comte took care of the classification of the sciences as well as a transit of humanity towards a situation of progress attributable to a re-examination of nature according to the\naffirmation of 'sociality' as the basis of the scientifically interpreted society (Cfr. Guglielmo Rinzivillo, ''Natura, cultura e induzione nell'et\u00e0 delle scienze. Fatti e idee del movimento scientifico in Francia e Inghilterra'', Roma, Nuova Cultura, 2015, p. 79 e sg., {{ISBN|978-88-6812-497-7}}).\n\nAmerican sociology in the 1940s and 1950s was dominated largely by [[Talcott Parsons]], who argued that aspects of society that promoted structural integration were therefore \"functional\". This [[structural functionalism]] approach was questioned in the 1960s, when sociologists came to see this approach as merely a justification for inequalities present in the status quo. In reaction, [[conflict theory]] was developed, which was based in part on the philosophies of [[Karl Marx]]. Conflict theorists saw society as an arena in which different groups compete for control over resources. Symbolic interactionism also came to be regarded as central to sociological thinking. [[Erving Goffman]] saw social interactions as a stage performance, with individuals preparing \"backstage\" and attempting to control their audience through [[impression management]]. While these theories are currently prominent in sociological thought, other approaches exist, including [[feminist theory]], [[post-structuralism]], [[rational choice theory]], and [[postmodernism]].\n\n====Anthropology====\n{{Main|History of anthropology}}\nAnthropology can best be understood as an outgrowth of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It was during this period that Europeans attempted systematically to study human behaviour. Traditions of jurisprudence, history, philology and sociology developed during this time and informed the development of the social sciences of which anthropology was a part.\n\nAt the same time, the romantic reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] whose work formed the basis for the [[culture]] concept which is central to the discipline. Traditionally, much of the history of the subject was based on [[Colonialism|colonial]] encounters between Western Europe and the rest of the world, and much of 18th- and 19th-century anthropology is now classed as [[scientific racism]].\n\nDuring the late 19th-century, battles over the \"study of man\" took place between those of an \"anthropological\" persuasion (relying on [[anthropometry|anthropometrical]] techniques) and those of an \"[[ethnology|ethnological]]\" persuasion (looking at cultures and traditions), and these distinctions became part of the later divide between [[physical anthropology]] and [[cultural anthropology]], the latter ushered in by the students of [[Franz Boas]].\n\nIn the mid-20th century, much of the methodologies of earlier anthropological and ethnographical study were reevaluated with an eye towards research ethics, while at the same time the scope of investigation has broadened far beyond the traditional study of \"primitive cultures\" (scientific practice itself is often an arena of anthropological study).\n\nThe emergence of [[paleoanthropology]], a scientific discipline which draws on the [[methodology|methodologies]] of [[paleontology]], [[physical anthropology]] and [[ethology]], among other disciplines, and increasing in scope and momentum from the mid-20th century, continues to yield further insights into human origins, evolution, genetic and cultural heritage, and perspectives on the contemporary human predicament as well.\n\n===Emerging disciplines===\nDuring the 20th century, a number of interdisciplinary scientific fields have emerged. Examples include:\n\n[[Communication studies]] combines [[animal communication]], [[information theory]], [[marketing]], [[public relations]], [[telecommunication]]s and other forms of communication.\n\n[[Computer science]], built upon a foundation of [[theoretical linguistics]], [[discrete mathematics]], and [[electrical engineering]], studies the nature and limits of computation. Subfields include [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability]], [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], [[database]] design, [[computer networking]], [[artificial intelligence]], and the design of [[computer hardware]]. One area in which advances in computing have contributed to more general scientific development is by facilitating large-scale [[Scientific data archiving|archiving of scientific data]]. Contemporary computer science typically distinguishes\nitself by emphasising mathematical 'theory' in contrast to the practical emphasis of [[software engineering]].\n\n[[Environmental science]] is an interdisciplinary field. It draws upon the disciplines of biology, chemistry, [[earth sciences]], ecology, geography, mathematics, and physics.\n\n[[Materials science]] has its roots in [[metallurgy]], [[mineralogy]], and [[crystallography]]. It combines chemistry, physics, and several engineering disciplines. The field studies metals, [[ceramic]]s, [[glass]], [[plastic]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, and [[composite material]]s.\n\n==Academic study==\n{{Main|History of science and technology}}\nAs an academic field, [[history of science and technology]] began with the publication of [[William Whewell]]'s ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' (first published in 1837). A more formal study of the history of science as an independent discipline was launched by [[George Sarton]]'s publications, ''Introduction to the History of Science'' (1927) and the [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'' journal]] (founded in 1912).  Sarton exemplified the early 20th-century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a [[Whig history#In the history of science|Whiggish]] belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The history of science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested scientists and physicians rather than professional historians.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1017/S0007087400023268 | last1=Reingold | first1=Nathan | year=1986 | title=History of Science Today, 1.

Mathematics is closely related to but distinct from natural science (at least in the modern conception). Technology is likewise closely related to but clearly differs from the search for empirical truth.\n\nHistory of science is an academic discipline, with an international community of specialists. Main professional organizations for this field include the [[History of Science Society]], the [[British Society for the History of Science]], and the [[European Society for the History of Science]].\n\n===Theories and sociology of the history of science===\n{{Main|Theories and sociology of the history of science}}\nMuch of the study of the history of science has been devoted to answering questions about what science ''is'', how it ''functions'', and whether it exhibits large-scale patterns and trends.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Dp1f03arcbYC&pg=PR11&dq=What+is+science | title=What is this thing called science? | isbn=978-0-87220-452-2 | year=1999 | publisher=Hackett Pub.}}</ref> The [[sociology of science]] in particular has focused on the ways in which scientists work, looking closely at the ways in which they \"produce\" and \"construct\" scientific knowledge. Since the 1960s, a common trend in [[science studies]] (the study of the sociology and history of science) has been to emphasize the \"human component\" of scientific knowledge, and to de-emphasize the view that scientific data are self-evident, value-free, and context-free.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=I_3i18x5BqcC&pg=PR9&dq=sociology+of+science |title=The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations |first1=Robert |last1=King Merton |isbn=978-0-226-52092-6 |year=1979 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}</ref>  The field of [[Science and Technology Studies]], an area that overlaps and often informs historical studies of science, focuses on the social context of science in both contemporary and historical periods.\n\n[[Humboldtian science]] refers to the early 19th century approach of combining scientific field work with the age of [[Romanticism]] sensitivity, ethics and aesthetic ideals.<ref>B\u00f6hme, Hartmut: \u00c4sthetische Wissenschaft, in: Matices, Nr. 23, 1999, S. 37\u201341</ref> It helped to install [[natural history]] as a separate field, gave base for [[ecology]] and was based on the role model of scientist, naturalist and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]].<ref>Jardine et al., ''Cultures of Natural History'', p. 304</ref> The later 19th century [[positivism]] asserted that all authentic knowledge allows verification and that all authentic knowledge assumes that the only valid knowledge is scientific.<ref name=\"Larrain1979p197\">[[Jorge Larrain]] (1979) ''The Concept of Ideology'' [https://books.google.com/?id=9ocOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA197 p. 197], quotation: {{quotation|one of the features of positivism is precisely its postulate that scientific knowledge is the paradigm of valid knowledge, a postulate that indeed is never proved nor intended to be proved.}}</ref>\n\nA major subject of concern and controversy in the [[philosophy of science]] has been the nature of ''theory change'' in science. [[Karl Popper]] argued that scientific knowledge is progressive and cumulative; [[Thomas Kuhn]], that scientific knowledge moves through \"[[paradigm shift]]s\" and is not necessarily progressive; and [[Paul Feyerabend]], that scientific knowledge is not cumulative or progressive and that there can be no [[demarcation problem|demarcation]] in terms of method between science and any other form of investigation.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qnwzRqh5jFMC&pg=RA1-PR11&dq=philosophy+of+science |title=Science Teaching: The Role of History and Philosophy of Science | first1= Michael Robert |last1=Matthews |isbn=978-0-415-90899-3 |year=1994 |publisher=Routledge}}</ref>\n\nThe mid 20th century saw a series of studies relying to the role of [[sociology of scientific knowledge|science in a social context]], starting from Thomas Kuhn's ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' in 1962. It opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that positivism did not explain the actual interactions and strategies of the human participants in science. As Thomas Kuhn put it, the history of science may be seen in more nuanced terms, such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix that includes intellectual, cultural, economic and political themes outside of science. \"Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific.\"<ref name=kuhn>Kuhn, T., 1962, \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\", University of Chicago Press, p. 137</ref>\n\nFurther studies, e.g. [[Jerome Ravetz]] 1971 ''Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems'' referred to the role of the scientific community, as a social construct, in accepting or rejecting (objective) scientific knowledge.<ref name=\"isbn0195197216 \">{{cite book |author=Ravetz, Jerome R. |title=Scientific knowledge and its social problems |publisher=Oxford University Press  |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=0-19-519721-6}} {{page needed|date=April 2018}}</ref> The [[Science wars]] of the 1990 were about the influence of especially French philosophers, which denied the objectivity of science in general or seemed to do so.

[[Bruno Latour]] noted that \"dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives.  Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies?

For instance, the great physicist  [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] looked back (cited [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|here]]) on [[John James Waterston]]'s  seminal paper on the kinetic theory of gases.  The history of the neglect of Waterston's path-breaking article, Rayleigh felt, suggests that \"a young author who believes himself capable of great things would usually do well to secure favourable recognition of the scientific world . . . before embarking upon higher flights.\"\n\n[[William Harvey]]'s experiences led him to an even more pessimistic view:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Silencing Scientists and Scholars in Other Fields: Power, Paradigm Controls, Peer Review, and Scholarly Communication |last=Moran|first=Gordon |publisher=Ablex |year=1998 |isbn=978-1567503432 |pages=(cited on page) 38}}</ref><blockquote>\"But what remains to be said about the quantity and source of the blood which thus passes, is of so novel and unheard-of character that I not only fear injury to myself from the envy of a few, but I tremble lest I have mankind at large for my enemies, so much doth wont and custom, that become as another nature, and doctrine once sown and that hath struck deep root, and respect for antiquity, influence all men.\"</blockquote>In more general terms, Robert K.
